Dear Shri Ramkrishnan,

  

  I understand your interpretation of *sarena \[=Skt. svareṇa\]* in the passage you quote. I am not sure I agree with you that this refers to recitation with Vedic svaras. This, in my opinion, refers to the beautiful voice of the reciter, which is later appreciated with the words:kalyāṇiyāsi vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagaḷāya atthassa viññāpaniyā. Be that as it may, whatever the original form of Pali, it shows loss of syllables in forms like api>pi, iti>ti etc., which look like loss of unaccented syllables, and it is likely that that original language may have had accents. However, no such notion of recitational accent has survived in the Pali tradition. Effects of accents on the morphology of Sanskrit continue long after the accents themselves cease to be used in the pronunciation of Sanskrit. Something analogous may have happened in the case of Pali. While the accents of Sanskrit have been preserved in the Vedic literature, and hence we have a full knowledge of that accent system, the accents of Pali and Prakrits have not been preserved, and we can make only some conjectures based on what we notice in the morphologies of those languages. With best regards,
