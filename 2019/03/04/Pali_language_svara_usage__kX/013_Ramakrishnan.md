Satyan ji,  
  
Apologies if I was not clear. I do not postulate that the monk was speaking Pali. As I told you, the spoken language of the first generation of buddhists that had the pitch accents was certainly not any kind of Pali.  
  
Pali was never meant to be (or was) a 'spoken' language of any ethnicity. It is by definition the literary (purely written)language of the Pali canon (and derivative literature). There has never been a standalone spoken-Pali outside the Pali canon. So the language spoken by the first generation of buddhists in the given example was not Pali but an earlier language that had the tonal accents (and where it was optional to include or exclude them, as the quoted example makes clear).  
  
Please see my fourfold chronological classification of the language of the Buddhist Tripitaka. There is no Pali in the first two stages, Pali only takes birth in the 3rd stage and is almost extinct in the fourth stage. If you disagree with this fourfold classification, I would appreciate to know the reasons why.  
  
Regarding your comment that the svaras with which the text was being recited could be something else other than the tonal accents, in my opinion that would be extremely unlikely as the already known meanings of svara (or sara in Pali) are our only alternatives. 'Sarena
abhaṇi'cannot mean recited 'with vowels', therefore in my understanding it means 'recited with the pitch accents'.  
  
Thanks,  
Ramakrishnan
