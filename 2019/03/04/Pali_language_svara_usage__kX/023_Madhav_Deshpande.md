I can accept that *sara* in the Pali passage under discussion can contextually refer to "intonation" in a general sense, but I do not accept that it specifically refers to Vedic accents. Already, from the three accent system of the early Vedic texts, we come to two accent system of the Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa \[the so called bhāṣika-svara of the Bhāṣikasūtra\] and then Pāṇini saying that mantras are recited in *ekaśruti*, except in Japa, Nyūṅkha and Sāman recitals \[*yajñakarmaṇi ajapanyūṅkhasāmasu*\]. Buddha's time coming somewhere between Pāṇini and Aśoka, the gradual loss of accentuation in Indo-Aryan, including Sanskrit is evident. So, the chance that the language spoken by the Buddha in eastern India will have retained the three-accent system of the R̥gveda is almost nill. I also do not accept that the ancient Prakrits did not have a basis in spoken languages or that they were merely a result of the arrival of writing systems. Fully accurately or partially, the Ashokan inscriptions give us a dialect geography of Prakrits, which to a large extent is confirmed by the trends in the Prakrits found in literatures and Prakrit grammars. I do agree that writing systems often give us an approximation of the spoken language, but that is the best we have for all pre-modern periods.
