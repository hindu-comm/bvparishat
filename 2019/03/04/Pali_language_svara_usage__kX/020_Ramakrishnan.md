Namaste Satyan ji,  
  
Would you kindly share the source (or logic) of your interpretation of the word 'svara' as 'sentence stress', either in Pali or Sanskrit? I have not heard this interpretation anywhere else so it is a bit hard to understand how it could mean sentence stress.  
  
I do not believe it means any kind of stress, not even word stress, let alone sentence stress, the most straightforward meaning (of the cited words sara &sarabhañña in this context) is'intonation' i.e. the pitch/tone accent (of Old-Indic?). Svara literally means vowel, and the intonation (pitch accent) applies to vowels. It does not apply to words/sentences, and it does not mean 'stress' as far as I know.  
  
This tone/pitch accent only exists in Vedic as a mandatory/native feature (and it gradually becomes optional/scholarly in Classical Sanskrit). When I say Classical Sanskrit here, I am not restricting it purely to the Paninian Grammatical/Phonetic Standard dialect (i.e. the language that complies entirely with the Ashtadhyayi), but I am including all the contemporary spoken Old-Indic dialects which directly derive from late-Vedic historically (evidences of the existence of which are found all over in BCE texts), i.e. all the Old-Indic dialects that Panini must have used to standardize their grammar (one of which evidently was the dialect in which this intoned recital praised by the historical Buddha occured).  
  
My point here is only to emphasize that this recital was in Old-Indic; not in any kind of middle-Indic or Pali.  
  
Let me take this line of argument a bit deeper than what I have so far stated (for whatever it may be worth):  
  
In the conventional understanding, one may ask the question "why hasn't the Tripitaka made it clear that the recital was in a Sanskrit dialect (i.e. a dialect that could have accents optionally), rather than in Pali, if the bhikshu suddenly shifted to Sanskrit from Pali (or whichever middle Indic dialect that he was previously speaking to the Buddha in)".  
  
I would instead invert this question and say "Why does the Tripitaka, which narrates so many dialogues, have no sanskrit vs prakrit alternations in those dialogues; à la the prakrit dialogues in Sanskrit dramas)  
  
The reason why the Tripitaka, or any other co-eval early literature for that matter (including Sanskrit texts), do not make this distinction clear (between old-Indic and middle-Indic speech as narrated in the suttas) is because no such distinction appears to have existed until the early centuries CE and all historical speech narrated in the Pali canon was in Old-Indic, although it has been ultimately redacted/written in middle Indic (Pali).  
  
The evolution from Vedic to pre-standardized Middle-Indic (i.e. early Gandhari) and later to standardized middle-Indic (late Gandhari & Pali) is more or less a set of sudden/rapid (predominantly orthographic in the early stages) innovations rather than a gradual natural evolution of the spoken language. No evidences (either literary or grammatical) of any intermediary evolutionary stages between Old-Indic and middle-Indic have been attested in literature (because there was no such gradual evolution). Nor are such gradual evolutionary shifts from Old to Middle Indic likely to be found in the future if my understanding is correct. My surmise is that middle-Indic innovations largely arose in the 4th century BCE due to middle-Iranic influences on Old-Indic, and the arrival of writing in Aramaic/Kharosthi/Brahmi (from Persia proper to the newly Persianized NorthWest-India in the mid first millenium BCE) and attendant orthographical innovations.  
  
It would have been too obvious in the late centuries BCE that middle-Indic had no natural spoken existence (too obvious to even be worthy of a mention), although the evolution of scripts/writing were slow to catch up with the siksha treatises (leading to the emergence of artificial 'ghost'/paisaca languages like Gandhari, Pali and Ardha-Magadhi in the intervening period that are attested in writing but were not spoken phonetically).  
  
I think this incident (where theaṣṭakavarga/aṭṭhakavagga, being chronologically the earliest known text in the Pali canon,is chanted with intonation) is historical because it is very unlikely to have been inserted/redacted as such if it actually did not happen.
