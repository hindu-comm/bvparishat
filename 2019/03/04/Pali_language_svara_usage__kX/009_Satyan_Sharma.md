Thank you so much, for sharing this Sir. I still

have a doubt whether the word ‘sara’ (skt. svara) used here actually represents the three svaras (udatta etc.) or not. This intonation could also be just at the level of words and sentences and not at the level of syllables. As Panini mentions ‘rules’ of the non-vedic speech to specify the syllable on which the udatta accent should be placed (for eg. sutra 6.2.134), I am curious as to whether there is a textual evidence regarding the use of svaras within a word in Pali?

  

Regards

Satyan
