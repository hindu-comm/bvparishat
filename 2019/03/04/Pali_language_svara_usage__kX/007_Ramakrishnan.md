Satyan ji,

  

To add to what I said below yesterday, I have found the text from the pali canon which speaks about the first generation of buddhist monks reciting buddhist texts with the svaras.  
  
This text is titled the Soṇa-sutta, and mentions that there was a monk (calledSoṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa in Pali) who upon being asked by the Buddha, recited the oldest known text in the Pali canon (theaṭṭhakavagga) with svaras. Having heard the aṭṭhakavagga being recited clearly with svaras, the Buddha greatly applauded him for clearly pronouncing the text with a proper grasp of the meanings.  
  
As I said, this scenario fits the first stage (spoken language of the first generation of Buddhists) of my four-stage classification of Pali's history when it was not only possible but natural to use the svaras in the spoken language during the Buddha's lifetime.

  

Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
