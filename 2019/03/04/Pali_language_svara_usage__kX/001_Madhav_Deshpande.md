The Pali grammarians do not mention any of the Vedic svaras, although I have talked to several monks, some of whom were my classmates at the Pune University, and they told me that there were standardized ways of reciting the Pali sutras and they recited some for me. From a historical perspective, the effects such as loss or reduction of unstressed syllables and expansion of the stressed syllables that are seen in forms like अस्ति/स्त:/सन्ति, नौमि/नुव:/नुम: have some survivals in Pali forms. One sees reductions of api>pi, iti>ti, idānīm> dāni where accent-induced changes can be detected. But there is no explicit instructional use of Vedic accents in relation to Pali, as far as I know.
