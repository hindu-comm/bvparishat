Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  My description of *sarena* in Pali as referring to beautiful voice was not intended to give the literal meaning of the word *sarena,* but what this refers to in the context of the appreciation that follows:kalyāṇiyāsi vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagaḷāya atthassa viññāpaniyā. That appreciation seems to expressive qualities of the *vācā* of the monk. The none of the adjectives *kalyāṇi, visiṭṭhā, anelagalā, atthassaviññāpanī* refer to anything that we can call Vedic accents, but qualities like beautiful, distinctive, not slurring, and clearly communicating meaning. In the context of these adjectives, I described *sarena* as beautiful voice. In any case, as I mentioned in myprevious email, whatever the spoken language it was that formed the basis of Pali, it could have had accents in its spoken form, and some of this can be inferred from reductions like api>pi, iti>ti, iva>va etc.
With best regards,
