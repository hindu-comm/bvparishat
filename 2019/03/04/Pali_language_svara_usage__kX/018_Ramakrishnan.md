Dear Madhav ji,

  

Thanks again for your response.  
  
The word sara is again used in the same text in the phrase 'soṇassa sarabhaññapariyosāne abbhanumodi' (śravaṇasyasvara-bhāṇa?-paryavasāna- abhyanumud-) here again we see that it is not primarily his inherent voice that is being referred to but hisparyavasānaof the 'sarabhañña'recitation.

  
The meaning of the word 'sarabhañña'is listed in the Concise Pali-English Dictionary of A.P. Buddhadatta Mahathera as "\[nt．\]intoning； a particular mode of recitation".

  

Similarly, the Pali dictionary published by the Vipassana Research Institute also mentionssarabhaññaṃ as "A particular mode of reciting or intoning sacred compositions"  
  
I agree when you say the adjectives you mentioned reflect the qualities of the voice and the reciter (and not the accent), but they are simply a stock phrase (or a canned phrase) used over and over again in other suttas of the pali canon (even where the voice is not described as 'sara' in the other cases).  
  
For example in a text called theOvādasutta, we find this canned phrase again with the same adjectives (kalyāṇavāco hoti kalyāṇavākkaraṇo, poriyā vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagaḷāya atthassa viññāpaniyā....) where the voice or recitation is not described with the wordssarabhañña or sarena.

  

In another text called the Alaṃsutta, we again find the same stock phrase (dhammānudhammappaṭipanno ca hoti; kalyāṇavāco ca hoti kalyāṇavākkaraṇo, poriyā vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagaḷāya atthassa viññāpaniyā...) where again the recitation or voice is not described assarabhañña.  
  
Therefore, I do not believe these adjectives describe the 'sara' in this case but are just a stock phrase inserted into the text as in other cases where the Buddha praises a recitation (and apply regardless of whether the recitation was sarena or not).  
  
Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
