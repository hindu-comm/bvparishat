I am not aware of any evidence of Vedic svaras for Pali texts. Some Brahmin monks propose to recite the Pali texts (छन्दसो आरोपेम) either with Vedic accents or render them into Sanskrit of some form, and the Buddha is supposed to have forbidden this, and asked thathis monks communicate his teachings in the local languages. The wordings of these Pali passages have been disputed in research literature and there exist multiple interpretations. The term सर in Pali grammars refers only to vowels, and not to Vedic accents. The grammars of Pali \[Moggalāna and Kaccāyana\] are later than Buddhaghosa, who declares that Pali/Māgadhi is the original language of all beings \[सब्बसत्तानं मूलभासा / सर्वसत्त्वानां मूलभाषा\], and does not derive it from Sanskrit. The Pali grammarians follow the style of the Sanskrit grammarians \[more like Kātantra than Pāṇini\], but describe Pali as an independent language, while the Prakrit grammars describe Prakrits always in relation to Sanskrit. That is a significant difference between the Pali and the Prakrit grammatical traditions. The Pali grammars were composed outside of India in places like Sri Lanka and Burma, while the Prakrit grammars were all produced in India. The Pali that is available to us was already transported to Sri Lanka and codified there, and then transmitted further to Southeast Asia. It was preserved and studied in relative separation from India and Sanskrit.
