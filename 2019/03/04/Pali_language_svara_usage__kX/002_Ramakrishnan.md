Satyan ji,

  

What exactly do you mean by Pali? The reason I am asking you this question is because I recognize at least 4 broad stages in what you call Pali, and different people use different definitions, so it is better to be more precise:  

1.  The original **spoken** language comprising the actual spoken
    dialects used in the earliest stages of Buddhism by the first one
    generation of Buddhists. 2.  The pre-standardized **written** language of the earliest pre-Pali
    Tripitaka (which only contained the earliest texts of the current
    tripitaka). 3.  The linguistically standardized **written** language of the full
    Pali canon as we have it today. 4.  The late-Pali that we find in the **written** commentaries and
    subcommentaries to the Pali canon, and other historical chronicles,
    biographies & philosophical literature (such as the Dipavamsa,
    Visuddhimagga, Dhammasattha etc).  

I do not view the first two stages above as Pali, they can be viewed as the ancestors of Pali.  
  
As you can see from the above the Pali we have now is not (and has never been, as far as I know) a spoken language or vernacular dialect of any ethnicity. It is by definition the frozen literary register of the Pali tipitaka. However, Pali was based on an actual spoken language used by the first generation (or first few generations) of Buddhists.  
  
I have read a story (I think from a vinaya text) where some monks were trying to chant some Buddhist texts with Vedic accents, this would probably fit the stage 1 above. It would appear from this story that the accents had become archaic but could still be used naturally in the spoken language (this would have been the case in Panini's lifetime).

  

Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
