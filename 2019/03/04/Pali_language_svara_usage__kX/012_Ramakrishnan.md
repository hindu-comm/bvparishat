Madhav ji,

  
Many thanks for your observations on this. You have said "The term सर in Pali grammars refers only to vowels, and not to Vedic accents", and I agree.  
  
However, this does not mean that the use of the word sara (svara) in the existing Pali grammars (which as you have said are all dated more than a 1000 years after the lifetime of the first generation of Buddhists) must ipso facto always agree in meaning with the use of the same word in the Pali tripitaka.  
  
If we look at the text cited by me (the relevant extract from which I have quoted below), the phrase 'sarenaabhaṇi' ("recited with svaras") cannot mean "recited with vowels" (because that option does not exist to recite a text without vowels); therefore in this case it can only mean 'recited with the tonal accents. This must also mean that it was possible to omit the accents, and therefore there was a real option available to the reciter to include or omit them.  

  
āyasmā soṇo bhagavato paṭissutvā soḷasa aṭṭhakavaggikāni sabbāneva sarena abhaṇi. Atha kho bhagavā āyasmato soṇassa sarabhaññapariyosāne abbhanumodi: “sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu, suggahitāni te, bhikkhu, soḷasa aṭṭhakavaggikāni sumanasikatāni sūpadhāritāni, kalyāṇiyāsi vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagaḷāya atthassa viññāpaniyā  
  
To be sure, Pali does not use (and has never used in my understanding) tonal accents so there is no disagreement about that. I do not postulate that in this case thebhikṣuwas speaking any kind of Pali.  
  
However, it is equally clear that the language that the first generation monks spoke had the accents, and those who recited thus were appreciated by the Buddha himself for reciting well.  
  
-------------  
***Sakkāya niruttiyā:***  
  
I am aware of the 'Sakkāya niruttiyā' controversy, the controversy exists because the text is misinterpreted by some scholars. The issue in there is not a distinction or preference between sanskrit and prakrit. Let me explain:  
  
Twobhikṣusapproach the Buddha and tell him "etarahi, bhante, bhikkhū nānānāmā nānāgottā nānājaccā nānākulā pabbajitā. Te sakāya niruttiyā buddhavacanaṃ dūsentiHanda mayaṃ, bhante, buddhavacanaṃ chandaso āropemā".  
  
In this quote above, clearly the problem mentioned by thebhikṣusis not the existence of multiple languages or dialects. The problem posed is that the societal diversity ofbhikṣus(with various names, gotras,jātis and kulas) is indicative of people with differing levels of education/understanding, and when they become parivrājakas, their different levels of understanding leads them to (mis)interpret thebuddhavacana in their own peculiar ways. This is what is mentioned in the text, the text is not speaking of multiple languages at all.  
  
The buddhavacana is evidently already available in a specific dialect/language, and the problem posed by these nānāvidhabhikṣus is that due to the differences in their social backgrounds, they understand the already existing buddhavacana (in an already existing dialect) in their own peculiar ways. Now the solution these two enterprising bhikṣuspropose is if they redact the buddhavacanam in chandasaḥ(metric poetry), that would promote greater standardization in understanding (much like the texts used by the various vedicśākhas) as that would subject it to similar rigorous pedagogical standards and methods in their dissemination.The Buddha here, concerned that this solution would prevent wider dissemination of his teachings, objects to the idea and allows thenānāvidhabhikṣus to understand it in whichever way they could (their social and educational backgrounds notwithstanding).

  
This does not conflict with my earlier example where the Buddha praises the bhikṣu who utters a text with svaras for reciting it well.  
  
Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
