Dear Satyan ji,  
  
Thanks for the quote from the commentary forSarabhañña:"Sarabhaññe **kira** taraṅgavattadhotakavattagalitavattādīni dvattiṃsa vattāni atthi" - it does not seem to make much sense to me.

  

Please share your understanding of it. What is ataraṅga(wave?), dhautaka (rinsing/washing?), galita (oozing/trickling?) got to do withsarabhañña?  
  

The use of the word 'kira' (=kila), especially in the commentary, appears to indicate it is based on hearsay (kirasaddo anussavane), so I am not sure what to make of this. Perhaps the commentator is commenting based on hearsay as he himself is not sure of what it originally meant?  
  

If you look at another commentator (from the Majjhima Nikaya Tika), he says "sarena suttassa uccāraṇaṃ sarabhaññaṃ"which to me makes better sense but is not adding anything beyond the obvious.  
  
In another instance, the commentary says "Sarena abhāsīti suttussāraṇasarena abhāsi, sarabhaññavasena kathesīti attho.sarabhaññapariyosāneti ussāraṇāvasāne" which does not make much sense to me again. Is thisussāraṇa = uccāraṇa, or is it something else?  
  
I think based on the above, using the pali commentaries (that are nearly one millenium younger than the mula texts and dont appear to belong to a continuous commentarial tradition) to understand the mula text is best avoided as they appear more likely to mislead than elucidate.  
  
-----------  

  
About speaking Gandhari, Pali, Ardha Magadhi phonetically, first we need to establish that they were spoken languages before we establish that they were spoken/written phonetically or non-phonetically.  
  
Is it not interesting that these names (Gandhari, Pali, etc) themselves are modern names, there are no references in BCE literature to any such languages being spoken anywhere, there are no grammars, no dictionaries, no quotes, nothing. Paisaci is mentioned (and to me it approximately means gandhari) but even the name Paisaci is not found in BCE texts as the name of a spoken language, it is only named in CE literature as the name of a prakrit.  

  
If we compare the edicts of Ashoka, he has inscribed the same identical texts (in obviously the same language) at multiple geographical locations, but the spellings of the words differ. How do we establish which one was the standard spelling and which one was the non-standard spelling? That would probably lead us to infer that the spoken language was not represented phoneticaly in writing.  
  

Regards,

Ramakrishnan
