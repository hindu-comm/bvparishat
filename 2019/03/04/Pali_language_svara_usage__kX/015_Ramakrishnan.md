Dear Madhav ji,  
  
Thanks once again for your thoughts. You say the word sarena refers to the beautiful voice of the reciter, rather than the (optional) employment of svara (tone/pitch) in recitation.  
  
I am not sure if you mean to say svara would mean "good voice" or just "voice". If svara is supposed to specifically mean good voice, or specifically show the quality of the voice, then I havent come across such a sense anywhere (whether in Pali or Sanskrit), and I would be grateful if you point out such a usage.  
  
If sarena were to simply mean "with a voice" that would be even more odd.  
  
If it were a good voice, he would not have an option to use a good voice (as opposed to deliberately using a bad voice). Here the sense of the word is that he had an option to recite it with "sara" or not, and he did, that is what makes it worthy of mention. It appears that the Buddha was not impressed simply by the voice but by the manner of recitation, and it is that manner of recitation that is meant by the use of the word sarena.  
  
There are other texts in the Pali tripitaka that mention people with beautiful voices, but this word (sara) has not been used in such contexts. Good voice is usually calledkalyāṇa-vāk- in the tripitaka, not 'sarena'.  
  
Therefore it appears to me that sarena has a different sense than 'good voice'.

  
Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
