Dear Madhav ji,  
  
Many thanks for sharing your thoughts.  
  
Given that the language that the first generation of Buddhists spoke is very likely one or more dialects of late-Vedic, or derivative dialects of late-Vedic, I don't know what to make of your opinion that it need not refer to some sort of a vedic pitch/tone accent.  
  
I do not claim that the first generation of Buddhists spoke the Rgvedic mantra dialects (or followed their archaic system of accentuation). I am simply saying that their dialect was very likely an Old-Indic dialect, in which some form of historical Old-Indic tone/pitch accent was still possible (although probably not invariably used in common speech except in chanting the sacred texts during the lifetime of the first generation of Buddhists).

  

You have said the Buddha's time comes betweenPāṇiniandAśokawhich seems to slightly differ from my understanding - in my understanding the first generation of Buddhists precedePāṇini (very likely by less than a century), or perhapsPāṇiniwas a younger contemporary of the historical Buddha. The reasons why I believe this to be true are as follows:  

-   The wordnirvāṇa as far as I am aware is not attested in
    non-buddhist literature before the time of first generation
    Buddhists (the reason why I keep mentioning first generation
    Buddhists, instead of the Buddha, is because I have no idea of the
    historical Buddha's corporeal identity, and to therefore speak about
    the Buddha as a person without knowing anything about him from
    independent sources is not probably very productive. We can however
    talk of the first generation of Buddhists as a group without knowing
    their individual identities). -   SincePāṇini (in sūtra8.2.50)gives an irregular derivation for
    'nirvāṇa' (nirvāṇaḥ avāte), and hints that it means death (or rather
    the absence of breath - notingavāteis in the locative case), it is
    my understanding that he primarily had the death of the historical
    Buddha in mind, and this must have probably happened in his time or
    slightly before.  

You have also mentioned that the Buddha was from eastern India, this is entirely at variance with my understanding (that the Buddha lived primarily in the Punjab region, and also probably in Rajasthan & Gujarat) for the following reasons:  

-   Most or all of the early Buddhist reliquary sites are based in the
    Punjab region as far as I am aware.  
-   Gandhari is a western language, Pali is a western language, Sanskrit
    without doubt is originally a north-western language. These are the
    languages in which early buddhist texts are found in. -   There are many brahmins named 'Todeyya' (Skt: taudeya) mentioned in
    the tripitaka who live in the area of Kosala where the Buddha
    usually lives. One of them is mentioned in the tripitaka as the
    purohita of the Kosalan monarch Prasenajit (Pali: Pasenadi).Pāṇini
    not only knows the existence of this tūdī grāma but gives a rule (in
    sūtra 4.3.94) to explain that 'taudeya' is a person from this place.
    Thistūdīis mentioned with other north-western-Indian locations
    like śalātura,varmatī &kūcavāra.  
-   As per the tripiṭaka, the historical buddha was initially a disciple
    of Ārāḍa kālāpa (Pāli: Āḷāra Kālāma). The kālāpas are usually
    mentioned together with the kaṭhas, and Pāṇini has some sūtras
    mentioning them. The kātantra-vyākaraṇa is also called the kālāpa
    vyākaraṇa. So the historical buddha was educated by yajurvedins (if
    we go by the Pali canon) and he was evidently particularly close to
    the kaṭhas & kālāpas early on.  
-   The pali tripiṭaka mentions the buddha meeting pauṣkarasādi
    (pokkharasāti), a very famous brahmin living in Kosala who had
    received a town (called ukkaṭṭha in Pāli) as brahmadeya from the
    emperor (Prasenajit). This (pauṣkarasādi)is a personal name that
    seems quite popular in late-vedic India as it is mentioned in
    theśāñkhāyana āraṇyaka,taittirīya prātiśākhya etc. It is hard to
    assume that the loci of these texts were in eastern UP or Bihar in
    the time of the first generation buddhists, rather than in the
    (yajur)vedic heartland - the Punjab. -   Coming to Rajasthan, Aśoka's 2 edicts at Bairat saluting the saṅgha
    there (and not anywhere else as far as I know) probably means that
    he expected his edict to be seen there by a very large number of
    buddhist monks (probably more than anywhere else). Perhaps Rajasthan
    was a buddhist stronghold in his time, more than any other site in
    eastern India. -   If the understanding that Jains were living in the same area as
    early Buddhists is correct, Gujarat and Rajasthan were the
    strongholds of Jainism from its very inception, so we must give
    credence to the inference that Asoka saluting the sangha & talking
    about buddhism twice in his Bairat edicts rather than anywhere else
    is a pretry strong indication of it being a major buddhist
    stronghold before his time. I am not aware of Jains being
    particularly strong in the eastern UP or Bihar at any point of time. -   Most of Asoka's most popular major rock edicts are in western India
    (Kalsi, Mansehra, Girnar, Shahbazgarhi). The majority of his (and
    his predecessors') empire therefore was based in western India,
    Kalinga being a noteworthy exception.  
-   In my understanding [Girnar is
    Girivraja](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Girnar/@21.5117552,70.4947917,11.69z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x395806dad3001e03:0xdbf51c9e12a802b2!8m2!3d21.5178869!4d70.5502916!5m1!1e4)
    (because its topography appears to uniquely satisfy the meaning of
    the word girivraja), and Pali is apparently based on a language that
    was spoken in that region. Therefore Magadha was originally in my
    understanding somewhere close to (or in) southern Rajasthan and
    Gujarat. Kosala & Kekaya were located in the Punjab region (and may
    have been neighbouring kingdoms). Kaikeyi prakrit is also based in
    western punjab. -   In edict 5 of Aśoka's major rock edicts, only the Girnar version
    mentions 'Pāṭalipute' while all other copies elsewhere replace it
    with 'hida'. I take this to mean that only people in the vicinity of
    Girnar (i.e. Girivraja as above) would actually know
    wherePāṭaliputa was (as it was proximal to this site) so it was
    relevant only there. -   In my understanding prakritic innovations first arose not in eastern
    India, but in north-western India (Old-Gāndhārī, as evidenced in the
    Aśokan edicts, is the earliest known 'prakrit', and Kharoṣṭhī the
    earliest known script that it used). The earliest attestations of
    Prakritic innovations I'm aware of are in Pāṇini(cf. the words naṭa
    and maireya in the Aṣṭādhyāyī). -   The buddha lived in the pre-writing era, and all prakritic
    innovations occur immediately after the introduction of writing,
    first in Kharoṣṭhī and later in Brāhmī. There is no evidence I know
    of prākṛtic innovations (as gradual evolutionary sound shifts
    unconnected to writing) before the introduction of writing. Please
    can you share if you are aware of any evidence of 'evolutionary'
    prakritic sound shifts spread over centuries leading to gradual
    prakritization of the dialects leading upto Pāṇini and beyond?  
-   The Aśokan edicts are all in the same language/dialect, and as far
    as I am aware, do not show any regional dialectal features. If we
    take one small example - consider the word kṛta, it is invariably
    represented as kaṭa/kata or kiṭa/kita in the aśokan edicts
    (sometimes both forms are found within the same text). This would,
    in my mind, imply that the underlying spoken dialect had kṛta and it
    was alternatively written as kiṭa or kita or kaṭa or kata (and it
    didnt matter because they were all equally lossy given the
    non-phonetic script being used). Phonetic representation of
    Old-Indic was evidently impossible in the early centuries of
    writing.

Best regards,  
Ramakrishnan.
