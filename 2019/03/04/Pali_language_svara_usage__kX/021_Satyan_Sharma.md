My interpretation of 'sara' as sentence stress is based only on a possibility that it could mean things other than the 3 kind of svaras. There is an explanation of**sarena bhaṇanaṃ**where it is said "**Sarabhaññe kira taraṅgavattadhotakavattagalitavattādīni dvattiṃsa vattāni atthi"**(link<https://tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/vin02a3.att4.xml>). Here there is a mention of vattas (vrttas) like taranga, dhotaka and galita, which are 32 in total. I haven't yet found any such vrttas/vattas elsewhere. This might provide some insight into what has been meant by 'sara' in the sutta being discussed.

  

I am not sure if sudden or rapid innovations can lead to such a major change in a language. Also how do we establish that Gandhari, Pali, Ardhamagadhi languages weren't spoken phonetically?

  

Regards

Satyan
