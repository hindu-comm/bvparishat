We can recall the Shiva symbolism too. There are some verses in Siva-puranam (Parvati-khanda, ch 28) in which Parvati gives a retort to the 'fake' brahmachari. In the same context there are verses in Skanda puranam (2nd khanda, ch 25, verses 71-77). Shiva is pleased with Parvati and says - 'tapo-dravyena kriitashca'.

There may be verses in other puranas too.
