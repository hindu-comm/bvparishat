The translation of the verse is incorrrect. The mistake is probably due to the immediate previous half-verse, which goes  
  
pralīyante yathākālamūrmayaḥ sāgare yathā  
  
This is my guess, but Bibek Debroy can comment better. He is active on Twitter and you may reach out to him.  
  
As expected, the Hindi translation by Gita Press is accurate. The verse has a different reading in the Gita Press edition as  
  
viśvasṛgbhyastu bhūtebhyo mahābhūtāstu sarvaśaḥ  
bhūtebhyaścāpi pañcabhyo mukto gacchetparāṃ gatim  
  
The Gita Press translation can be seen under (verse 13, p. 6207)
