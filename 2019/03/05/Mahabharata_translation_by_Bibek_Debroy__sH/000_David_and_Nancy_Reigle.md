Dear Vidvāns,

  

The first ever complete English translation of the critical edition of the Mahābhārata was made by Bibek Debroy and published in ten volumes, 2010 to 2014. To have translated this entire huge text is an amazing accomplishment, and to have done it in just five years is even more amazing. The first ever English translation of the entire Mahābhārata, made by Kisari Mohan Ganguli and published by Pratap Chandra Roy, 1883-1896, took many more years to complete. It is the very speed with which Bibek Debroy translated this enormous text that has raised the following question in my mind: Is it possible to translate this much this fast and still be accurate? Since it is a translation of the critical edition of the Sanskrit, accuracy takes on particular importance.



As is well known, the Mahābhārata includes the world classic Bhagavad-gītā. It also includes the follow-up gītā known as the Anugītā. Besides these, my own particular interest is especially in the Mokṣa-dharma section of the Śānti-parvan, in which very old philosophical teachings are preserved. To have a critical Sanskrit edition of all these old teachings is a huge plus in determining just what they say. To have an English translation of them is a huge help, assuming that it is accurate.



So far, I have checked only one verse, and I must hope that it is not typical. It is from the Anugītā, 14.50.13 of the critical edition:



viśva-sṛgbhyas tu bhūtebhyo mahābhūtāni gacchati \|  
bhūtebhyaś cāpi pañcabhyo mukto gacchet prajāpatim \|\|



Bibek Debroy translates this, vol. 10, p. 447, as:



“Then, the elements that create the universe merge into the great elements. These five elements are freed and merge into Prajapati.”



I do not see how words in the fifth case, viśva-sṛgbhyas bhūtebhyas, “the elements that create the universe,” can be the subject of a sentence. Even if they were in the first case, the verb is singular, gacchati, not plural. I have checked the critical edition, and there is no variant reading gacchanti. Again in the second line, words in the fifth case, bhūtebhyas pañcabhyas, “five elements,” are taken as the subject. Again here, the verb is singular, gacchet, not plural. Moreover, these fifth case plural words are taken to agree with the first case singular muktaḥ, “are freed.” In fact, muktaḥ must be the subject here, “one who is freed,” going with the two singular verbs. So, in accordance with the grammar, I understand this verse as:



“One who is freed goes from the elements that create the universe to the great elements, and also from \[those\] five elements will go to (merge into) Prajāpati.”



Perhaps my understanding of this verse is wrong. Bibek Debroy certainly knows far more Sanskrit than I do. Yet, his disregard of simple Sanskrit grammar in this verse surprises me. Hopefully this verse is an isolated exception. I wonder how widespread this kind of thing is in his translations. Has anyone checked them further?



Thanks.
