Pranams to all,

  

One of my friends is looking for English translation of Anubhutiprakasa of Vidyaranyaswami (in print or soft copy).  

  

The only translation of Anubhutiprakasa in English seems to be that of Godabarisha Mishra published by University of Madras in 1992. This book is not available at Amazon or similar online book sites. - <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34319552>

  

Would it be available at University of Madras? Google search did not yield any useful information. Any info about its availability is welcome.

  

If someone from BVP has got a scanned copy of English translation of Anubhutiprakasa, please share it, since the book seems to be out of print.  

  

regards  
shankara
