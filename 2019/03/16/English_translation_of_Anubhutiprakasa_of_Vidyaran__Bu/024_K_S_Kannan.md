I guess I had written long ago about this.

A good many books published by our universities are inexpensive.

Yet most of them do not reach any bookshop.

Most people will never get to know of the publications.

The universities have no policy of incentives for the sale of books.

Unable to reach those in need, the books languish for years and finally vanish.

I had heard long ago that hundreds of copies of the massive 32-volumes set of  

Rgveda Samhita with Kannada translation (Mysore) were victims of termites.

  

You will get OUP and CUP publications in Bangalore book shops,

but none of Bangalore Uni and Mys Uni publications.
