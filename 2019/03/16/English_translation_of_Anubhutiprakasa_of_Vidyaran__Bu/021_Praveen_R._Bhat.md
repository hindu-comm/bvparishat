Its unfortunate that such books just sit out wearing on University bookstore shelves/boxes! I hope there was a way that these books made to stores such as Giri trading or Vedanta Book House, if not on online platforms. Aren't there any of the BVP members students/ teachers at Madras University (and other such), who may be able to influence the same? Just a thought.

  
Kind rgds,
