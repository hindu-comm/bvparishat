I am not familiar with the situation at the University of Madras publications department. However, a few of my publishers informed me that at some point the sale of a particular publication dwindled to such a low rate that their cost of holding the unsold copies exceeded any benefit from sales, and in some cases, the publishers sent me a few copies gratis and destroyed the remaining copies to save their cost of storage. This happened with publishers in the US, Europe and Japan.
