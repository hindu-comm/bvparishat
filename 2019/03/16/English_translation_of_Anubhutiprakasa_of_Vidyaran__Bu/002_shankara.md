Wakankarji,

  

I have started exploring all possible options. Request to BVP members is part of this effort.  

  

Since my friend is in Kerala, it is not practical for him to approach libraries in Chennai. Moreover he is not from academic circle. So, he does not have access to University libraries in Kerala. I do hope someone from BVP would have access to a soft copy of the book.  

  

My friend is also ready to buy second hand copy of the book, if someone is willing to sell.   

  

regards  
shankara
