Sri Narayana Prasad-ji,

  

It is not resurfacing of the deergha when another word is added.

  

Such samaasa is called siddhasamaasa . Which means that the samaasa is borrowed into the language (such as Telugu) after the samaasa is formed as per the Sanskrit word-combination rules. As such, the original long vowel at the end of the poorvapada remains as it is during the word-combination for samaasa formation.

  

kamalā+ dēvī -> kamalādēvī is formed in Sanskrit first and then it is borrowed into , say, Telugu and the long vowel in the so formed kamalādēvī then changes to kamalādēvi as per the Telugu norms.
