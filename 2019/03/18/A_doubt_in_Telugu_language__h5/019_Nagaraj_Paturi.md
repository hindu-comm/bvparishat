Dear Sri Radhakrishna Warrier-ji,

  

There is no need to reinvent the wheel. All these aspects are already exhaustively covered in the respective traditional grammars and contemporary/modern linguistic studies.

  

As pointed out by Dr Sivasenani garu, samaya- is the praatipadika and s(up) is the suffix and the word , prathamaa form ,in Sanskrit is samayah ,समयः

  

When Sanskrit words are borrowed into Indian languages as tatsamas, only the praatipdikaa part is borrowed and the suffix is dropped. The feature ('samskaara'?) of the borrowing language is added in the form of suffix of the respective language.

  

If you take the example of raamah of Sanskrit, praatipadika is raama . Tamil and Malayalam add the suffix -an to indicate human masculine singular. In Telugu -u- Du gets added. Traditional Telugu grammars treat - డు / -Du as the human masculine suffix. Contemporary linguists historically derive this suffix from the proto-Dravidian \* -an .

Kannada uses the praatipadika raama itself directly and alternatively uses -nu as the suffix. Both in the case of -Du of Telugu and -nu of Kannada, -u at the end of the word is believed to have got added for the convenience of pronunciation or to be in tune with the vowel ending nature of most words in the language.
