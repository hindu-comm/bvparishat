The whole discussion pertains to how Sanskrit words are borrowed into Telugu (and other south Indian languages).

  

Sanskrit words which undergo change only at the suffix level during borrowing are called tatsamas.

  

Younger list members should cultivate the approach of looking at sutras as ' covering' the usages not 'justifying' them.

  

Shortening the long vowel at the end of the Sanskrit words during borrowing seems to be the feature of all the south Indian languages

  

In Hindi and most north Indian languages , the long vowel at the end of the Sanskrit word is retained.
