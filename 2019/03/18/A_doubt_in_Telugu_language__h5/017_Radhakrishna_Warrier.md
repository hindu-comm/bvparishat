In tatsama Sanskrit borrowings, Malayalam, Telugu and Tamil seem to add suffices to the borrowed word. For example, let us take the Sanskrt word samaya (time). Malayalam, Telugu and Tamil borrow it as samayam.
Telugu sometimes goes to the extent of borrowing it as samayamu. Kannada, on the contrary, doesn’t add anything. It borrows the word as samaya. North Indian languages too, borrow it as samaya, but drop the last /a/ in pronunciation and say the word as samay. What is this suffix ‘am’ that Malayalam, Telugu and Tamil are adding? Why aren’t Kannada and north Indian languages adding this? Is 'samaya' really the 'pure' Sanskrit form?
