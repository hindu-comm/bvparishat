Yes, now that I read the Karṇāṭakaśabdānuśāsanam, it looks like those rules apply to Malayalam also. And I have to say that there are a few more words ending in long vowels in Malayalam, like śrī (श्री), bhrū (भ्रू = brow) etc.

Interesting that in the name Karṇāṭakaśabdānuśāsanam, the word Karṇāṭaka (कर्णाटक ಕರ್ಣಾಟಕ) uses a retroflex ṇ. This is how the word is written in Malayalam too (കർണാടകം Karṇāṭakaṃ). But in modern Kannada, I see that it is invariably written as Karnāṭaka (ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ कर्नाटक) except when it comes to the name of a particular bank (ಕರ್ಣಾಟಕ ಬ್ಯಾಂಕ್). In Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi etc., also it is written as Karnāṭaka (कर्नाटक, કર્નાટક). Was it ಕರ್ಣಾಟಕ in old Kannada?

Regarding Varaṇāsi and Vārāṇasi, this dual way or writing exists in Malayalam too. I suspect Varaṇāsi is a wrong transliteration of the Roman Varanasi. I don’t think that word exists in old literature.
