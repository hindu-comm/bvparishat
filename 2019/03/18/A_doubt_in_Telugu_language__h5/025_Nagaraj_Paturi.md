How words are borrowed as tatsamas into south Indian languages is related only to 'prathamaa' forms.

  

All other vibhakti pratyayas are, yes, is an interesting topic, not related to how words are borrowed as tatsamas but has got to do with the common features of these languages in the aspect of case marking suffixes (classified by traditional grammars as vibhakti pratyayas)too.

  

-ge in Kannada, -ku(n)/-ki(n) in Telugu, - kk(u) in Tamil and Malayalam all are derived from a proto form \* -kk .
