Thank you Shri Nagaraj Paturi-ji for the clear explanations. And sorry for my ignorant questions. My knowledge of grammar and languages is that of an average twelfth grader. I did not study any language, be it Malayalam, Hindi or English beyond the equivalent of 12th grade. After that it was science and engineering subjects only. The little Sanskrit that I know is because of the little Malayalam and Hindi I know. I know a little of a few other languages because I had the opportunity to interact with the speakers of those languages and also because I learnt those scripts out of interest.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
