Dear Scholars,

  

pranams!

  

I am confused about the usage of Telugu language. While in Sanskrit we use दीर्घ for some feminine genders like दुर्गा, भवानी, रमा, etc., and the same is followed in the Hindi language, what is the rule for the same in Telugu?

  

Which one is correct ? Is it భవానీ/భవాని ?

and also,

Is there any rule in Telugu vyakarana to justify the rule?  

  

thanks & regards,  

ANUPAMA
