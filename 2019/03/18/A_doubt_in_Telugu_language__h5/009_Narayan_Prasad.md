\<\<However, when another word is added, the long vowel resurfaces as in Kamalādēvi or Dēvīmāhātmyaṃ. ...

The only exception, as far as I know, is the word strī (woman).In this case the last vowel /ī/ is always long.\>\>

  

BTW, did you see my message on the parallel rule fromकर्णाटकशब्दानुशासनम् (1604 AD) ?
