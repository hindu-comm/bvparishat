Why only three languages (Malayalam, Telugu and Tamil) are adding the vibhakti pratyayas, - the nominative case affixes - to the tatsama borrowings?

  

The proper name Bhīma becomes Bhīmaṉ in Malayalam with the addition of the masculine singular suffix ṉ and Bhīmuḍu with the masculine singular suffx ḍu in Telugu. Bhīṣma becomes Bhīṣmar with the addition of the honorific plural suffix ‘r’ in Malayalam and Bhīṣmulu in Telugu with the addition of the honorific plural suffix ‘lu’. Prēma (love) becomes prēmam in both Malayalam and Telugu with the addition of the neuter gender suffix ‘m’. Why do Malayalam, Telugu and Tamil feel the need to add these suffices while Kannada and north Indian languages do not?

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
