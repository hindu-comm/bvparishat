Malayalam also, it seems, avoids word final long vowels.

For example, Sanskrit Kamalā becomes just Kamala with a short /a/ in Malayalam.

Dēvī becomes Dēvi. However, when another word is added, the long vowel resurfaces as in Kamalādēvi or Dēvīmāhātmyaṃ.

Pāṭhaśālā (school) becomes pāṭhaśāla

When it is felt that the long vowel is to be shown, a /v/ with saṃvṛta ukāraṃ (vŭ) is added, as

Brahmāvŭ for Lord Brahmā and 

Śarmāvŭ for Śarmā (modern trend is to say and write just Śarma with a short word final a).

The only exception, as far as I know, is the word strī (woman). In this case the last vowel /ī/ is always long.
