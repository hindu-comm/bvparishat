But, over here (न्यायबोधिनीविषयमाला), there's a slight difference in definition which also fits fine.

  

प्रतियोगिव्यधिकरण means प्रतियोगि-अधिकरणे अवृत्तिः। Like प्रतियोगि is कपिसंयोग। तदधिकरणं वृक्षः। तत्र ***मूलावच्छेदेन*** अवृत्तिः प्रतियोगि-कपिसंयोगः।

  

So basically I didn't get this definition. Who is pratiyigivyadhakarana now? The abhAva or Sadhya:- कपिसंयोग, विशिष्टसत्ता etc? **Who's VisheshaNa is Pratiyogi-VyadhikaraNa?**

  

This picture has shown the example of **द्रव्यं विशिष्टसत्तावान् द्रव्यत्वात्।**

I'm not understanding this. **If GuNa is adhikaraNa of vishiSHTa-sattA, then how is it PratiyogivyadhikaraNa? Vi.Satta exists in guNa so by which avachhedaka it doesn't exist?**

Like by mool as the avachhedaka, kapisanyoga is अवृत्ति in the वृक्ष, but by शाख as the अवच्छेदक, कपिसंयोग is वृत्ति in the वृक्ष।

  

**How is GuNa, adhikaraNa and vyadhikaraNa together and by which avachhedakas?**
