Thank you Anandji very much.

I got the answer after a lot of thinking.  
Actually Pratiyogi isn't vi.satta, but shuddhasatta, both have abheda.  
Vi.sattabhav=shu.sattabhava so Pratiyogi=shuddha satta.

Tad adhikaranam=gunakarma,  
tatra vritti=vi.sattabhav, atah vi.sattabhava pratiyigyadhikarana-avritti naasti.  
Atah vi.sattabhava nasti pratiyogivyadhikarana.  
Atah tannirupita-vrittvabhavo api dravye na sambhavati, iti avyaptih.

The thing is if gunakarma is not pratiyigivyadhakarana, then tannirupita-vrittitvahhava can't be taken into consideration. So avyaptih. It was very diffi to get this correct, for first i was taking the definition incorrect, as Pratiyogi-anadhikarana-vritti rather than pratiyigi-adhikaraNa-avritti.

And secondly i had taken Pratiyogi incorrect. So i wasn't able to get the avyApti.

Thank you very much for removing time to answer me Guro.

Natosmi.  
Rishi.
