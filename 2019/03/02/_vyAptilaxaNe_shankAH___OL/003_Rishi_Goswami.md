Thank you very much Sir.  
  
I had to look up many sources and actually finally recieved an answer I was looking for.  
  
प्रतियोगिव्यधिकरणत्वम् means प्रतियोग्यनधिकरणवृत्तित्वम् which is an adjective of साध्याभाव. Pratiyogi=vahni, it's anidhakarana=hrad, vrittitvam=saadhyaabhavasya.  
  
Like सामानाधिकरण्यं means तदधिकरणवृत्तित्वम्. Same way वैयधिकरण्य means तदनधिकरणवृत्तित्वम्. So I was understanding wrong, I just pratiyogitavyadhikarana means hrad. But Its hrad vritti abhav.  
  
Thank you again Sir.  
  
Regards  
Rishi.
