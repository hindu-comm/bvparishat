It is to rule out partially locatable properties such as kapisaMyoga that pratiyogivyadhikaraNa (abhAva) is specified in the vyApti definition. The abhAva of something, ghaTa for example, must not be collocated with its pratiyogin, ghaTa.

The point here is that hetu-adhikaraNam is hetutA-avacchedaka-vishiShTa-adhikaraNam. If this is not the case, then a valid inference, "it is a substance (dravya) because it has existence possessing difference from that of qualities and actions (guNakarma-anyatva)" will become too narrow (avyApti), because pure existence (shuddha sattva) is present in qualities and actions where there is an absence (abhAva) of substances. However, this is not correct, because the hetutA-avacchedaka here is vishiShTa-sattva (guNa-karma-anyatva-vishiShTa-sattva) and not shuddha sattva. Although shuddha sattva and vishiShTa sattva are not different (ontologically), the avacchedakas are different. Hence, the inference is correct.
