PratiyogivyadhikaraNa means the (atyanta-abhAva) must not share the locus (adhikaraNa) with the pratiyogin. This is added in the vyApti definition to deal with partially locatable properties such a kapi-saMyoga, where the absence (abhAva) and its pratiyogin can share the same locus (tree). The tree could have both kapi-saMyoga and its absence, since parts of the tree are not in contact with the monkey. Actually, Gangesha takes care to see to it that his definition of vyApti does not suffer from the defects of 1) not considering universally positive properties (kevalanvayi) and 2) not considering partially locatable properties, such as kapi-saMyoga.
