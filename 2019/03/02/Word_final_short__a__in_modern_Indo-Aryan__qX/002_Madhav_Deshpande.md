Dear ShriRadhakrishna Warrier,

  

I remember to have read in some research publication that this has to do with the shift of the typical final udātta of a nominal stem \[cf. फिषोऽन्त उदात्त:\] to the penultimate \[second to the last\] syllable, and the gradual shrinking and eventual loss of some of the unaccented vowels in Indo-Aryan. Will see if I can locate the publication. A rare case of the loss of the unaccented vowels in Sanskrit is in the forms स्त: and सन्ति where the initial unaccented "a" of the root is lost, while it is retained in अस्ति where the udātta falls on the "a".
Shrinking of the unaccented and expansion of the accented syllables is seen in forms like नौमि, नुव: नुम:, where "nau" is the udātta syllable, while "nu" is the anudātta syllable.
