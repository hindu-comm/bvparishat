Has it ever been investigated as to when it was that most Indo-Aryan languages (i.e., most languages of north India) began losing the word final hrasva (short) /a/ ? For example at what stage of language evolution was it that “Rāma” began to be pronounced as “Rām” in Indo-Aryan? Was this trend right there in the Prakrit stage? Did it happen when Prakrits began evolving into Apabhramśa-s? Or did it happen when Apabhramśa-s began evolving into modern Indo-Aryan languages? The modern Indo Aryan scripts continue to show the word final /a/ but just the pronunciation of this /a/ is lost – Lord Rama’s name is written as राम and never as राम् in any of the scripts of modern Indo-Aryan languages, but is invariably pronounced as राम्. In some cases, it is not just the word final short /a/, but short a’s within words have also been lost. For example, the name Kamalā is written correctly as Kamalā , but pronounced in most of the modern Indo-Aryan languages as Kamlā. I also find that not just short /a/ but most short vowels (like u or i) at the end of words have been lost in tadbhava words.

Interestingly this phenomenon seems to be there in Indo-Iranian too.
Word final short /a/ of Old Persian seems not to be retained in modern Persian.
