Thank you Prof. Deshpande. This is very interesting.

  

On another note, I feel that modern Punjabi is very tonal. I don't know if it is an inheritance from the Vedic accents (or tones?) udātta, anudātta and svarita. When I said tonal, it is not like the tonal nature of languages like Mandarin in which meaning of single words can change drastically depending on the tone. I tried to learn Mandarin, but was not able to differentiate the four tones of the language.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
