Dear Dr. Walter Slaje

  

Firstly, let me clarify the laughter was no arrogant laughter, but an innocent one. Something like the laughter of English speakers at the [German coast guard trainee joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0lWICH3rY).

  

I am no authority on English language or English pronunciation (either received pronunciation or American pronunciation). At the same time, I have not spent my life teaching English language, English literature and/or English phnetics/phonology. Prof. Robert Goldman is a distinguished professor of Sanskrit at Berkeley. He has co-authored the*Devavāṇīpraveśikā*whose first lesson is on Sanskrit phonology. Here is what Goldman and Goldman say on page 4 of the book:

  

*Similarly, aspirated voiced stops, which never occur in English, are a little difficult at first for English speakers. These sounds "gha," "jha," ''(;lha," "dha," and "bha" must be realized (despite their roman representation) each as one simple sound: a voiced stop accompanied by a discharge of air. They are not to be pronounced as two separate sounds, stop plus voiced "h." (See 1.18.b. 1 for pronunciation.)*

  

Is it too much to expect a person who teaches how to pronounce *th* and *bh* sounds in his book to also pronounce them correctly? Are we to assume that there was never any non-Indian or Indian speaker who ever corrected his pronunciation of *th* and *bh* sounds?

  

In this light, you comparing my English pronunciation with Goldman’s Sanskrit pronunciation is strange. I was not surprised when Vishvas used the expression*going off yourrockers*which means “to become crazy or mentally unsound; to become extremely foolish or foolhardy” for your reaction.Perhaps the pronunciation part touched a raw nerve in your case. Maybe your pronunciation of *th* and *bh*is also incorrect (I am not sure as I have not heard it, I would like to hear it though). I have heard some Westerners pronounce the sounds correctly. Here is a Swedish woman, Ananda Himani, speaking the word *yathā* with the *th* sound correctly pronounced at 1:51.

Compare this with Goldman singing the word*yathā*multiple times here starting at 1:13

My ears say Ananda Himani, who is not an academic, gets it correct and Goldman, author of*Devavāṇīpraveśikā*, does not.

I am very happy to work with you on my English and German pronunciation and your Sanskrit pronunciation. The latter is more important in my humble opinion.

  

Finally, I do not have a PhD, so please do not call me**Dr** Nityānand Miśra. My *hitopadeśa*for you would be to look up people up on Google or LinkedIn before assuming they have a PhD. Here is a video on [effective LinkedIn searching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsVg_vgLYTM).

  

Thanks, Nityananda
