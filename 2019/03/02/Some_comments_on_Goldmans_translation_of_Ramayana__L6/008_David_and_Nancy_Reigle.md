A Query to all,  

  

Recently a new English translation of the complete Valmiki Ramayana was published, made by Bibek Debroy. It is described as being only the second translation ever made from the critical edition (Goldman, et al., was the first). I wonder if anyone has checked its accuracy.  

  

Bibek Debroy also translated the whole Mahabharata, the first ever complete translation made from the critical edition. I recently had occasion to check a particular verse from it. The construal of this verse seemed to me to be quite inaccurate, taking the wrong word as the subject of the sentence.  

  

So I wondered if Bibek Debroy's translations of the critical editions of the great epics are considered to be reliable.

  

Best regards,
