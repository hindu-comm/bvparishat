Dear Dr. Roland Steiner

  

Thank you for your comments. I strongly disagree with your interpretation that there is an insinuation of“giving their wives to others” in the *Arthaśāstra* verse you cited. However, before I share my interpretation, allow me ask you the following question.

  

Keeping Kangle aside (and others aside), how do would**you** parse and translate the compound*strī-vyavahāriṇām*? Do you agree with Kangle or do you have a better translation?

  

I will share my parsing and translations after hearing your views. Let me return your favour of a hint by giving you a hint:*supyajātau ṇinistācchilye*

  

Look forward to your views,

  

Nityananda
