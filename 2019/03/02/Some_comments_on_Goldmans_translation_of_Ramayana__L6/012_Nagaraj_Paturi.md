Dr B V K Sastry avare,

  

Thanks for bringing this very important article from a very important scholar into discussion..

  

But I wish you started a separate thread for this.

  

I know that this article could involve some problems of translation too.

  

But its focus is more on the occurrence of a word or words for a tool called mirror. Its objective is to establish a later date for the early Upanishads.

  

I am starting a new thread on this.
