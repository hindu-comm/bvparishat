You are entitled to your views, but the interviews were not intended to mock Goldman, but offer criticism of his work. Your comments on *international reputation of India’s long-gone culture*reek not only of ignorance of Goldman’scritics but also of contempt. Your views portraying Goldman as bearing the burden of preserving international reputation of India’s culture and dismissing his critics as simply bad-mannered people are reminiscent of views held by Rudyard Kipling, who felt that some people had the *divine burden to reign God’s Empire on Earth*.

  

Pray, is the international reputation ofIndia’s culture more important than the culture itself? And Indians, who are much closer to India’s past culture, have no right to critique the so-called international torchbearers of India’s past culture?

If this is an allegedly scholarly list, as you say, why are you even here as a member? Why would you even care to respond?Are we to assume you are an alleged scholar? It would have been better had you tried to show that what are claimed as schoolboy errors are not errors. If you rather show what meanings have changed and when and try to specifically contradict the claims, that would be scholarly and not rants like these.

So now you are saying that people whose views you do not like have“mean traits”. Very good manners.
