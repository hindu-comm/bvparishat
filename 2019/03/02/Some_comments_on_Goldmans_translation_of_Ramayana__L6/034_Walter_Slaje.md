Well, let me say this: I am neither an acquaintance of Professor Goldman nor would I ever want to interfere in a serious academic discussion between Professor Goldman and someone else. Personally I am absolutely neutral in this matter and always ready to correct any evident errors. This is the way truth-seeking scholars would proceed under normal circumstances.

But these staged interviews give the impression of a prosecution with only the denouncer present and the accused absent. Publicly mocking a deserved scholar for one wrong articulation, who has dedicated a research life to Indian literature and who has achieved more for the international reputation of India's long-gone culture than any of his self-styled know-it-all critics, appears to me as the pinnacle of bad manners.

In my previous post I have retained the **original wording (except for the guffaws) of Dr Mishra and his administrator** – thankfully denounced by someone on this list as “racist stuff “­ ­ and have changed only a couple of characteristic sounds with a view to helping also others to understand the essence of this appalling posing, which is palpably meant as a public execution for the amusement of an applauding audience.

What we get from tasteless videos of the kind now in circulation on this allegedly scholarly list are not so much gloatingly and self-righteously insinuated “schoolboy errors” of “white” American scholars. What we actually witness can be reduced basically to bad behaviour. The lack of manners displayed here reminds one of two lads bathing themselves openly in the limelight of their self-centredness fully unaware of the way in which they expose themselves to the educated. In the present case it was done in the spirit of a Swadeshi Indology with the naive belief of Sanskrit in Indian genes with unchanged meanings inherited in an unchanging chain of tradition with no history.

The mean traits of blatant *ātma-stuti*, *para-nindā* and *abhimāna* are so obvious that I bid adieu to this thread.

  

Good bye,

WS
