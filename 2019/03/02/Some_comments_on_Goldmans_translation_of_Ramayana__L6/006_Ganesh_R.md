Dear Sri. Mishra mahodaya,

  

Thanks a lot for this thorough and brilliant analysis of Robert Goldman's translation. Your exposition, evidences and sources are so convincing. It is really a treat to hear your defense for the Gitaa press translation. I am thrilled by the way you justified our true scholars and tradition. May this service to surabhaarati continue well. I also congratulate infinity foundation for this video production.

  

With warm regards

  

Ganesh
