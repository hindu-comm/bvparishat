Dear Mr Misra,  
  
I can help you with the Mahābhārata quotation in Böhtlingk's  
"Sanskrit-Wörterbuch in kürzerer Fassung" (i.e., the small  
"Petersburger Wörterbuch" = pw) which you were not able to find, or in  
your words during the "video discussion" with Rajiv Malhotra (ca.  
22:50): "I could not trace it. This entry in both dictionaries \[pw and  
Monier-Williams\] is incorrect, it has to be deemed incorrect, it goes  
against established meaning, the citation is not traceable. So I have  
to say that it's an error in those dictionaries."

It goes without saying that in 1879 Böhtlingk could not make use of  
the critical edition. Hence, the entry "MBH. 12,104,6" for kṛtajña  
refers to the Bombay edition where one reads under 12.104.6 the  
following śloka:  
  
vyādhinā cābhipannasya mānasenetareṇa vā  
dharmajñaś ca kṛtajñaś ca tvadvidhaḥ śaraṇaṃ bhavet  
  
which corresponds to 12.105.6 of the critical edition:  
  
vyādhinā cābhipannasya mānasenetareṇa vā  
bahuśrutaḥ kṛtaprajñas tvadvidhaḥ śaraṇaṃ bhavet  
  
Best,  
  
Roland Steiner
