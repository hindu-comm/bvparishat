Dear Nityanand Misra,  
  
\> Keeping Kangle aside (and others aside), how do would \*you \*parse  
\> and translate the compound \*strī-  
\> vyavahāriṇām\*? Do you agree with Kangle or do you have a better translation?  
  
The relevant passage is Arthaśāstra 2.27.25 (ed. Kangle):  

  
etena  
naṭa-nartaka-gāyana-vādaka-vāg-jīvana-kuśīlava-plavaka-saubhika-cāraṇānāṃ  
strī-vyavahāriṇāṃ striyo gūḍhājīvāś ca vyākhyātāḥ //  
"By this are explained (rules for) the women of actors, dancers,  
singers, musicians, story-tellers, bards, rope-dancers, showmen and  
wandering minstrels, who deal in women, and (women) who follow a  
secret profession." (transl. Kangle)  
  

If I had not agreed with Kangle's translation, I would not have quoted  
it. The word formation of strīvyavahārin in Arthaśāstra 2.27.25 (ed.  
Kangle) is to be seen by analogy with surākiṇvavyavahārin "dealing in  
liquor and ferments" (Arthaśāstra 2.25.1) or kācavyavahārin "dealing  
in glass-ware" (Arthaśāstra 5.2.20) of the same text.  
  
Accordingly, strīvyavahārin means "dealing in women" which perfectly  
fits the context of this specific Arthaśāstra chapter (2.27) entitled  
gaṇikādhyakṣaḥ "superintendent of prostitutes". The context, as well  
as the actual language usage (especially in one and the same text), is  
decisive, at least for a historical interpretation, irrespective of  
Pāṇini 3.2.78 (supy ajātau ṇinis tācchilye).  
  
Moreover, one could compare (in their respective contexts):  
  
Manusmṛti 8.362:  
naiṣa cāraṇadāreṣu vidhir nātmopajīviṣu  
sajjayanti hi te nārīr nigūḍhāś cārayanti ca  
  
Baudhāyanadharmasūtra 2.2.4.3 (ed. Hultzsch):  
na tu cāraṇadāreṣu na raṅgāvatare \[ed. Pandeya: raṅgāvatāre\] vadhaḥ  
saṃsarjayanti tā hy etān niguptāṃś cālayanty api  
  
Yajñavalkyasmṛti 2.48:  
gopaśauṇḍikaśailūṣarajakavyādhayoṣitām  
ṛṇaṃ dadyāt patis teṣāṃ yasmād vṛttis tadāśrayā  
  
\* \* \*  
  
However, we should not forget the starting point of this thread. Sīta  
says to Rāma: śailūṣa iva māṃ rāma parebhyo dātum icchasi "Like a  

dancer/an actor (śailūṣa) you, Rāma, are willing to give me to others."  
  

1\. Sīta compares Rāma to an actor/dancer. 2. These dancers/actors are  
in the habit of giving their wives to others. The question is (if  
there is any question at all): Why is Sītā making such a statement in  
her specific situation? Everyone can answer this question for  
themselves. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing more to say  
about that. I permit myself to withdraw from this thread.  
  
Best,  
Roland Steiner
