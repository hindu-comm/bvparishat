It is comparatively simple. The second half of Rāmāyaṇa 2.27.8 (crit.  
ed.) reads (Sītā is speaking):  
  
śailūṣa iva māṃ rāma parebhyo dātum icchasi  
  
which could literally be translated as:  
  
"Like a dancer/an actor (śailūṣa) you, Rāma, are willing to give me to  
others."  
  
An interpreter would have to explain the meaning of the phrase "to  
give me to others" in the narrower context of this śloka and in the  
broader context of the beginning of sarga 2.27. Obviously, it is  
regarded as typical of this kind of dancers/actors "to give" (dātum)  
their wives "to others" (parebhyaḥ; cp. bhāryāṃ "wife" referring to  
Sītā in the first half of the same śloka). And Sītā is comparing Rāma  
to such an "actor/dancer". It goes without saying that her statement  
is not intended as a compliment, to say the least. I should also be  
clear that she must have a motive for making such a comparison which  
has its roots in her own personal situation as well as in Rāma's  
behaviour. Each plausible interpretation of the use of śailūṣaḥ  
("actor/dancer") and the phrase parebhyo dātum ("to give to others")  
in this śloka has to take Sīta's specific situation and motivation  
into account.  
  
The next step would be to get an idea of how actors/dancers were seen  
or depicted in ancient Indian literature with regard to their  
insinuated habit of "giving their wives to others". I'll give you a  
hint:  
  
Arthaśāstra 2.27 (ed. Kangle), title of the chapter:  
gaṇikādhyakṣaḥ "The superintendent of courtesans" (transl. Kangle)  
  
Arthaśāstra 2.27.25 (ed. Kangle):  
  
etena  
naṭa-nartaka-gāyana-vādaka-vāg-jīvana-kuśīlava-plavaka-saubhika-cāraṇānāṃ  
strī-vyavahāriṇāṃ striyo gūḍhājīvāś ca vyākhyātāḥ //  
"By this are explained (rules for) the women of actors, dancers,  
singers, musicians, story-tellers, bards, rope-dancers, showmen and  
wandering minstrels, who deal in women, and (women) who follow a  
secret profession." (transl. Kangle)  
  
The examples could be multiplied arbitrarily.
