Namaste Nityanand ji,

  

Very nice. I watched your video with my Guru ji Shri Rajiv M ji. Outstanding.

  

I wish you to expose all these authors who are well established and have created havoc on our narratives n sabhyata . Also if possible, circulate your videos with common man who have no net acess through various other mediums like magazine or pamphelets or T.V .

  

I am circulating your videos as much ad possible and orally educating people around me.

  

I want my Dharmic foundation back and my BHARAT back.

  

Dhanywaad.
