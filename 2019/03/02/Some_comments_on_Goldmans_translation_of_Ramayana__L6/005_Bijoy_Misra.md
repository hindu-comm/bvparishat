I admire Prof Paturi's post in recollecting the old thread!

We are working on "a few" words. If you read through, Goldman's translation

becomes increasingly absurd. Pollock is another "stalwart" in this business

of philology... They have no concept of रूढि and the cultural metaphors.  

I heard that Stephanie Jamieson whom I knew personally, has also fallen in the trap

of this absurdityin using dictionary to understand old literature! I have not seen her work yet!

At the same time, I must admit that the language conversion is an extremely hard task!
