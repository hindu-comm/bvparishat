Dr Slaje,

  

The errors are not just about pronouncing Sanskrit, but also about how it is written. Let me give an example. On the Indology list, around 2003, all of your colleagues rushed to defend Paul Courtright over his sexually pervert interpretations of Bhagavan Ganesha. Well, I got a hold of his PhD thesis on which the book was based. Here is the reference -

  

Paul Barber Courtright. ‘Ganesa and the Ganesa Festival in Maharashtra, A Study in Hindu Religious Celebration’. A Dissertation Presented to the Faculty of Princeton University in Candidacy for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Recommended for Acceptance by the Department of Religion, September 1974.

  

The prevalence of transliteration errors in almost every other page makes one wonder if the Courtright was even aware of correct pronunciations of Hindi and Marathi words and if he ever proof-read the text of his thesis, or if his Thesis committee members ever noticed these errors.

On Page 5, Atharva Veda is mis-spelt as ‘Athārva Veda’

On Page 14 and 17 etc., the Mahābhārata is mis-spelt as ‘Māhabhārata’

On Page 14 and 15, the Mānavagṛhyasūtra’ is mis-spelt as ‘Mānavagṛhasūtra’

On Page 16, the Yājnavalkyasmṛti is mis-spelt as ‘Yajnavālkyasmṛti’

On Page 18, Mahābhāṣya is mis-spelt as ‘Māhabhāsa’

On Page 18, Rāmāyaṇa is mis-spelt as ‘Rāmayāna’

On Page 19, Mahāpurāṇa is mis-spelt as ‘Māhapurāṇa’, Matsyapurāṇa as ‘Matsyapūraṇa’, Vāyupurāṇa as ‘Vayupurāṇa’.

On Page 20, Jaya is mis-spelt as ‘Jāyā’, Vijaya as ‘Vijāyā’

On Page 22, Śakti is mis-spelt as ‘Śaktī’.

On Page 24, Prahara is mis-spelt as ‘Prahāra’

There is no consistency of transliteration. Sometimes, vinaayaka should have been spelt as vināyaka but instead we see vinayaka (e.g., p. 14, 18). Let me leave it at that!

Let me tell you one thing if you care - our culture is not 'long gone.' We are NOT museum pieces that cannot talk back. A recent spat on this list prevents me from spilling more beans on you, but members of this very list can read the archives of other Indology list to see what I would term as your arrogant, rude behavior directed specifically towards scholars of Indian origin. While we appreciate you spearheading the Mokshopaya studies, the fact remains that you have disdain for living Hindus. Your virtue signalling below just reminds me of 'ulta chor kotwal ko danntay' adage in Hindi.  

  

Thank you.

  

Vishal Agarwal
