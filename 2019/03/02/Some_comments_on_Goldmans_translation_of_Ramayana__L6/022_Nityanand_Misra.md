Dear list members

Here is the third and final video in the series in which Icompare the translations of Valmiki Ramayana by Robert Goldman, Sheldon Pollock, et al. with Hindi and English translations by GitaPress. As earlier I find the Gita Press translations to be consistently better: more accurate, more reliable, and more faithful to the original text.

  

In addition, I point out to the unprofessional work byPrinceton Library of Asian Translations on the covers (title on each of the seven books uses the anusvara incorrectly, a basic error which beginners of Sanskrit make),the schoolboy errors that Pollock makes in his translations and annotation of the *Ayodhyākāṇḍa*, and the incorrect pronunciation of aspirated consonants *th* and *bh* by Robert Goldman. I also make an offer to Sheldon Pollock in the video: if he writes a book **in Sanskrit** and an Indian publisher of repute (MLBD, Chaukhambha, RSS, Gita Press) publishes it, I will proofread it for free.
