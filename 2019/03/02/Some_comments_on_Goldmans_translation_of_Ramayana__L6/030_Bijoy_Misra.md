Dear Dr Slaze,

You are being picky. While Sri Nityanand Misra should not have gotten into the nuances

of pronunciation, which have accent and geography built in, I would think that a scholar

recording himself/herself should be prepared enough. There are many in the west

record Sanskrit songs with some three days's class. I see that in India these days also.

Music and pronunciation have been a part of Indian traditional rigor.
You appear to have

sympathy for Goldman. If you analyze objectively, you would see the marketing aspect!

There is whole branch of Indian literature on pronunciation..  

Best regards,

BM
