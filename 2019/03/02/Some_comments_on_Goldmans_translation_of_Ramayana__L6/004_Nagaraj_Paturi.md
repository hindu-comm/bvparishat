In that thread at this post :<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/SCbhjYJaQJM/zaGx4qTzCQAJ>, there is a reference to an older thread on BVP where Prof. Goldman's obnoxious application of Psychoanalysis to Hanuman and his wrongs from Alankara S'aastra point of view in viewing S'ringara rasa in an episode where it doesn't fit etc. are discussed.
