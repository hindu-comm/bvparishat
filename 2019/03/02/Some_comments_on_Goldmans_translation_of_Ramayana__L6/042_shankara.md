Wakankarji,

  

As you might already know, Sita Ram Goel narrated the controversy that arose after John Muir published 'Matapariksha' and its critiques by Hindu scholars, in his 'History of Hindu–Christian Encounters, AD 304 to 1996'.

A more detailed description of Matapariksha controversy is found in Richard Fox Young's 'Resistant Hinduism'

BTW, the name of the young Marathi scholar who wrote the first critique of Matapariksha 'Sastra Tattva Vinirnaya' was Nilakantha Gore. This book was published by Scindi Oriental Institute in 1951, edited by S.L. Katre.

It was unfortunate that this young scholar got converted to Christianity within a few years and wrote a book called 'Shaddarsanadarpana' critiquing 6 darsanas of Hindu philosophy to prove superiority of Christian faith.
