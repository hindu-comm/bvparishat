While I appreciate others in this thread pointing out the quasi-pimp connotations of shailIsha, this above comment is just so silly. Unlike Goldman, who is teaching Sanskrit at a renowned university without even being able to speak the language properly, Nityanand Misra is not teaching American (or Austrian) English.  

  

In any case, even the claim that Nityanand cannot pronounce त in english is completely false; and furthermore, I don't know where Walter got the idea that the initial t in *translating*is not to be pronounced as *ṭ* - perhaps in Austria they say it that way? Most of the world indeed says "ṭ" - one can listen to how they say it at <https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/translate> . Then there is the obvious fact that there is no prescriptive shixA shAstra for English, that pronounciation varies with time and place to a far greater extant, and there are many times more people speaking English the Indian way than the quaint Austrian way.

  

I haven't watched the videos, but am getting the impression that Nityananda must be pointing out quite a few painful flaws in Goldman and Pollock's works so as to make their buddies go off their rockers. *
