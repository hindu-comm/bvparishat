Dear Sri Nithyanand Mishra, Shri Rajiv Malhotra, and others,

  

I saw the video on Robert Goldman, and agree with the conclusions. I also read the Sanskrit Ramayana Sarga under consideration. I want to use another meaning of "Sailush" as obtained from Sanskrit Dictionary @ sanskritdictionary.com.This isa slightly different point of view for Sri Nithyanand's and Rajivji's consideration. The word Sailush also means "one who beats time' for, say, a dance performance. (As in, 'Taalam' for a dance). As you all know, the background to Sita using this word for Rama is as follows: Rama comes home from Dasaratha's palace, and tells Sita that he is going to the forest for 14 years. Sita tells him she wants to go to forest with him. Rama refuses, and gives few reasons but Sita insists. Rama again tells her to live with his mother Kausalya in the palace. He says his brother Bharata will take care of her. Sita refuses and gives her reasons for wanting to go with Rama. When Rama insists for a third time, Sita is angry, and uses this word, 'Sailush' to imply that he is just a drum beater, who keeps repeating the same thing again and again. In fact, such a usage is common in Telugu language. If someone goes on repeating the same thing, we say you are sounding like a 'taalam', or 'aadinde aata'. (meaning playing the same thing over and over). Please examine if my explanation is a possible way of looking at the word Sailush. Any error is mine. Just a different POV, not using the meaning 'jaayaajeevi'.

  

I agree with Sri Nithyanand that Goldman has no clue on this word, and how it is used.Such people who denigrate Ramayana should be castigated.In fact, it is so far from the meaning of prostitution, that both Goldman and Audrey should be taken to court for misrepresenting the icon of an entire race in derogatory terms. I am also ashamed that us Hindus have not read these foreign writers critically.

  

Thanks for an interesting episode.

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
