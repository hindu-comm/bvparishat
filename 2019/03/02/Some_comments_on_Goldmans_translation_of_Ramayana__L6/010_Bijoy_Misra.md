An epic is not translated by using dictionary.  

Any effort to tell a story would miss the poetics in the poetry!

Slaughtering of words and bypassing unknown concepts would be common!

  

I did ask Pollock about poetry translations in his role as Editor of old

poetry books. He said he knew the language! That was a lame answer..

A poem is not a word arrangement.

  

I am preparing a local talk tomorrow on "Nature and Spirituality".

In preparing I remembered the old poem of William Wordsworth

that we had studied in High School.

  

Daffodils

by William Wordsworth

I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.



Continuous as the stars that shine

And twinkle on the milky way,

They stretched in never-ending line

Along the margin of a bay:

Ten thousand saw I at a glance,

Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.



The waves beside them danced, but they

Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:

A poet could not be but gay,

In such a jocund company:

I gazed'and gazed'but little thought

What wealth the show to me had brought:



For oft, when on my couch I lie

In vacant or in pensive mood,

They flash upon that inward eye

Which is the bliss of solitude;

And then my heart with pleasure fills,

And dances with the daffodils.

I dare if anyone can translate it into an Indian language without causing damage to the joy of the poet!

Valmiki is ten times more difficult!
