In the Vedic index of names by Arthur Macdonell he defines shailush as a man who lives "on the prostitution of his wife".

  

The link is -- <https://archive.org/details/vedicindexofname02macduoft/page/395>

  

He also mentioned the source as Saayanbhaashyam on Taittireeya Brahmana (3.4.2.1). You can see the bhaashya on shailush at the link --

Saayan says -- anyasmai svabhaaryaam pradaaya tena jiivitam -- he lives by exchanging his wife in return for money.

  

This is where the idea seems to have come from.
