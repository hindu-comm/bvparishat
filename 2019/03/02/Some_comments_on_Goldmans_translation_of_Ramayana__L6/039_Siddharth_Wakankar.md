Dear Scholars and Friends,

  

I am reminded of a very little.known Sanskrit work, written and published in three different editions from Calcutta between 1840 and 18610or so by Shri John Muir,famous for his translations of Original Sanskrit Texts.That work written in Sanskrit in the form of Gurushishyasamvaada, clearly states=in defence of Christianity and against Hinduism- as it's subtitle.I will give the exact details in a day or two.

He composed that book so that Sanskrit Pandits will read and re.act to the contents. As the Sanskrit scholars at that time were not so active,as some of us are today,to contradict the western scholars convincingly,we have only three scholars writing against that book.They were a 19 year old Sanskrit Pandit from Varanasi,viz.Narayanashastri Gore,Subaji Bapu and Bengali scholar,Harachandra Tarkapanchanan.

  

Looking to this indifference of the then Sanskrit Pandits,Mr.Muir published three editions of this book and other anti.hindu stuff in Hindi [etc.to](http://etc.to) distribute freely in the society

How many of Sanskrit scholars know this disturbing fact.

  

Now that Indian scholars are awake,the foreigners-most of whom have some ulterior motives- are feeling the punch.

  

That is all. Best luck to those scholars who are exposing such highly esteemed foreign scholars who are misrepresenting India and its literature.

  

Are some of these foreigners still of the opinion like Shri Max Muller that,we are doing our work,if Christianity or Church does not do anything,whose fault it is.

  

Thanks for patiently reading this small write.up.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
