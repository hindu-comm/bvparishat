So many things wrong in just the above paragraph -  

  
One wrong articulation?

Long gone culture?  

Know-it-all critics?  

achieved more for the international reputation of India's long-gone culture than any of his self-styled know-it-all critics?  



The above matters are too much to comment on, but just on the last point above, it would do well to recall just a couple of Goldie's contributions (all while shamelessly soliciting contributions from Indian government and Hindu temples) -  

  

\- analyzing the size changing abilities of Hanuman in terms of a penis becoming erect

\- consistently being on the anti-Hindu side of California Textbook hearings over the decades

allegedly scholarly list?

Just remember - we can see what goes in the Indology list managed by Audrey Turschke.

I still haven't watched the videos, but you seem to be describing yourself here :-D . You don't even know how to say "translate" and presume to lecture Indians on how English is spoken using that very example. Then you don't even acknowledge and fix your errors. So much for your lack of ātma-stuti, para-nindā and abhimāna.

Interesting caricature. AFAIU, the basis of Svadeshi indology is the fact that people like Sheldon Pollock, Audrey Turshke, Wendy Doniger etc.. misrepresent hindu tradition and culture; actively attack and malign Hindu culture, campaign against current Hindu interests and subvert Hindu anglophones. Their conclusion that we should present our native view to counter the likes of those you support seems quite reasonable. No one is forcing you to read any of it or watch any video pertaining to it.
