Absolutely brilliant Mishra Ji.  
We need more scholars like you. I have been reading Gita Press books since my childhood and found them to be brilliant and transformational. Also thanks for mentioning Karpaatri Maharaj—a brilliant sanyasi.  
We should also remember that scholars some times take the essence or the ultimate aim of the Vedic texts.  
We also have examples of Ramanujam —a mathematic genius whom the equations were revealed in a different realm of knowledge.  
  
Thanks for sharing and hope to be enlightened more.
