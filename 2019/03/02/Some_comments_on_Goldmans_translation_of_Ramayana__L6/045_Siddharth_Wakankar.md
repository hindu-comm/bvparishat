I convinced,on the basis of my research and pointed out to Prof. Young that Subaji Bapu who helped Wilkinson in editing Jyotisha works from Bibliotheca Indica ,Calcutta,is different from Somanath Vyas and he gracefully accepted his mistake and wrote back to me to that effect and corrected his observation.

  

This is what research does,as he pointed out in his letter to me.  

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
