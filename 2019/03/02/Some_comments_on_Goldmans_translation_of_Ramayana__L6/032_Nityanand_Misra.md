Dear Dr. Roland Steiner

  

You gave the examples of *surākiṇvavyavahārin* and *kācavyavahārin*. Now let us consider two examples below (listed in Monier-Williams, with the meanings from the same source)

  

*kūṭavyavahārin* = “a deceitful merchant” (not “dealing in deceit”), i.e. a dishonest dealer

*samudravyavahārin* = “trading by sea” (not “dealing in sea”), i.e. a sea-trader

  

In both these cases*kūṭa*and*samudra* are not the *karma*, but the*karaṇa* or *adhikaraṇa*. Using the rule *supyajātau ṇinistācchilye*, the word*strī-vyavahāriṇām* can be parsed as*strībhirvyavahartuṃ śīlaṃ yeṣāṃ teṣām*, meaning“of those whose nature is to deal with (=with the help of) women.” This is the sense implied by the Hindi translation of Gangaprasada Shastri (attached image). He saysस्त्रियों के द्वारा जीविका चलाने वाले, with no sense of *handing over* women to others in the word or compound.

  

Even if the context is that of *Gaṇikādhyakṣaḥ*, it does not necessarily imply that all these women were given/handed over for prostitution in the time of Chanakya or Valmiki. It would be very wrong to assume that without specific evidence. Is there any specific evidence to conclusively show that a *śailūṣī*was given/handed over for prostitution and not for singing/dancing? To take an example from recent Indian history, nautch girls, *domni*s, *tawaif*s, *kanjari*s, *nochi*s, and*devdasi*s were all different. It would be wrong to translate any of these terms as a prostitute. In modern times also there are a wide range of \[men and\] women who work in, for lack a better term, the adult entertainment industry. It is a wide range: singers, fully-dressed dancers (called *bar balas* in some parts of India), social escorts,erotic dancers, masseuses, adult movie actors, etc. Would be right to use the words *pimp* and *prostitute* blindly for all of these professions?

My point is not why Sita is saying this, but the specific translation of a *śailūṣa* as a pimp and a*śailūṣī* as a prostitute. What did dancers/actors hand over their wives for? The strong association of*śailūṣa* and*śailūṣī* with music and dance suggests handing over for music/dance entertainment (like that in the case of nautch girls), not prostitution. As the vācaspatyam says on*jāyājīva*:*jāyayā tannarttanavṛttyā jīvati*

  

Thanks, Nityananda
