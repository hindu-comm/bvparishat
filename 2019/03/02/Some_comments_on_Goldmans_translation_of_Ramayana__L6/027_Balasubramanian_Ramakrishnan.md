Well, if you had actually listened to Misra-ji, he points out later that he may be mispronouncing the zha in Tamil (vaazhai-pazham example), but if he were conducting research in Tamil for 40 years, he should be able to pronounce it.

  

Not sure where you got the idea Misra-ji is doing research on English literature/phonetics.

  

This one comment alone proves what I have seen consistently: white scholars say whatever they like, including racist stuff, and expect Indians to take it without protest. But on pointing out their mistakes they will lash out angrily with silly, tangential critiques like below. Congrats on providing me yet another data point.
