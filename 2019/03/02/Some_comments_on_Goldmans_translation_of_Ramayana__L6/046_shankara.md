Wakankarji,

  

If you have soft copy of your paper on Harachandra's critique of Matapariksha, please share it.

  

Religious dialogues and debates especially those that involve Hinduism is one of my favourite subjects. I have collected almost all books related to Matapariksha controversy that are available online.

  

Harachandra Tarkapanchanana's 'mataparikshottara' (also in the form of gurusishyasamvada) was published in Bengali script in 1840. It is available at Google books.  

  

regards  
shankara
