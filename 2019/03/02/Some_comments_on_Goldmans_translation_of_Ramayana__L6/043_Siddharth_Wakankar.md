Dear Shankar ji,

  

Prof.Richard Fox Young visited my place in Baroda in early 2000 and we had a long discussion about Matapariksha.In fact, he gave a copy of his Resistant Hinduism as well as of the first edition of Mata...by John Muir.

  

I do have a copy of the book by Shri Goel and managed to get a copy of Harachandra ms.from London and wrote a paper on it which was published from Santiniketan.

  

Only one original ms.of Mata..is deposited in Asiatic Society, Mumbai.

  

I am amazed by your overwhelmingly exhaustive memory and capacity to provide exact references.Hats off to you.

  

I did expect a post from you after my post and you did oblige.

  

Thanks and warm regards.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
