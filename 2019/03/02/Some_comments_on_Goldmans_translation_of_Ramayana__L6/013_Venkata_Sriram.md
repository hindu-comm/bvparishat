Namaste Misra ji,

  

I have seen the entire video...wonderful !

  

Swami Ramsukhdas Ji always used to encourage people around him to study Gita Press books only and he used to say that

गीता प्रेस् कि किताबें पडते समय मन को बहुत शान्ति मिलती है

  

I always prefer Gita Press books that are free from printing devils and also available at a very affordable price.

  

The entire Valmiki Ramayana Set I purchased for Rs.300/-. Seeing my enthusiasm, the volunteers gave me 'Gita - Sadhak Sanjeevani' by Ramsukhdas Ji

free of cost as a bonus !

  

rgs,

sriram
