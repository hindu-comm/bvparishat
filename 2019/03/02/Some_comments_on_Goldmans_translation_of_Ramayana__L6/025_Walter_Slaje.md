I have watched this video and stumbled over the passage 19:35 ff:



“\[...\] when I listen to it, I realize that Robert Goldman mispronounces *tha* as *ta* and *bha* as *ba*. So he cannot pronounce the aspirated consonant – “ha ha ha ha”. So the word is *babhrāja*, Goldman says *babrāja* \[...\]. Well I am not passing a judgment on him, but I am stating the fact. \[...\] I think I could possibly work up towards my pronunciation. \[...\] My *tha* and my *bha* is clear. Goldman’s *tha* is *ta*, Goldman’s *bha* is *ba*. Just stating facts.”





Now, when I listened to it, I realized that Nityanand Misra mispronounces *ta* (त) as *ṭa* (ट) and *da* (द) as *ḍa (*ड). So he cannot pronounce the dental consonant (no arrogant laughter). So the word is *translating*, *towards*, Nityanand Misra says *ṭranslaḍing, ṭowards* \[...\]. Well I am not passing a judgment on him, but I am stating the fact. \[...\] I think he could possibly work up *ṭowards* his pronunciation. \[...\] Goldman’s English त and द is clear. Misra’s English त is ट, Misra's English द is ड. Just stating facts.



If Dr Nityānand Miśra even himself “thinks he could possibly work up towards his pronunciation”, here is my *hitopadeśa*:
