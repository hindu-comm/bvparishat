"*Now, when I listened to it, I realized that Nityanand Misra mispronounces ta (त) as ṭa (ट) and da (द) as ḍa (ड). So he cannot pronounce the dental consonant (no arrogant laughter). So the word is translating, towards, Nityanand Misra says ṭranslaḍing, ṭowards \[...\]. Well I am not passing a judgment on him, but I am stating the fact. \[...\] I think he could possibly work up ṭowards his pronunciation. \[...\] Goldman’s English त and द is clear. Misra’s English त is ट, Misra's English द is ड. Just stating facts.*"

  

I don't think English language has dental*ta* (त) and dental*da* (द).
What it has are alveolar 'ta' and alveolar 'da'. and in American English, intervocalic alveolar 't' becomes alveolar 'd'. Water is pronounced like 'wader', butter like 'buder' and so on. "Translating" definitely becomes "translading" in standard American pronunciation. 
Also, importantly, the topic was *Sanskrit* pronunciation, not English pronunciation.
