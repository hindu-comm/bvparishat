Excellent Misra ji,

I heard your discussion with Rajiv ji. I admire it as a person currently teaching Ramayana with the commentaries you referred to. However, I am deliberately not referring to Goldman and others. I think it will be great if you to do a series of talks on the Ramayana, covering the whole text.  

Regards,

Dr. Aravinda Rao K
