Dear friends,

  

Continuing what I said before, I would say that an Indian University or an institution

should arrange a rigorous teach-in course on word use and metaphors. It could

help many of the new researchers also. Metaphors in English are word related

and local. "white as snow", not "white as swan", but then no face has anything

to do with "moon" or a "lotus". Just like I would have difficulty in explaining to

my mother the phrase "rubber meets the road!". I still have my ignorance in how

to phrase it precisely back at home. Some of the vernacular newspapers in India  

who use news-feeds do post literal translations that sound absurd.

  

Though I am now forty-five years in the US, I might have 1% familiarity of the local

cultural use of words. So I do have sympathy for Robert Goldman and others

who might never know the Indian use of the words. But there is a more fundamental

flaw in scholarship in assuming as though the words have static meanings. This is where

I totally differ with my linguist friends in the west. They derive words through propagation

and not think of the word production. There was declared injunction against the

research into word production when the French philosopher Voltaire proposed it

in eighteenth century. Such tacit injunction continues. Language training becomes

a test of memory than the expression of thought translation. The concept that the

thought has no words is unknown in the west.

  

It may take many decades or centuries before we understand the scientific basis

of formation of sound from a thought. Meanwhile all should agree that the words are

not literal, but they signal message. Such conviction has to emanate from India

itself with her multiple languages and diverse population. All messages are true,

it is not what we hear, but what we express. An expression is different than  

transmission or communication. The west may not catch up easily, because the  

idea of individuality is in conflict with uniformity. The latter is the root of imperialism!  

  

Let me hope the best.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
