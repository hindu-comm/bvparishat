Dear Shankar,

  

I have to search for it in my huge collection. In the meanwhile,pl. give your postal address,so that I can send its xerox copy to you.

  

Just let me have the details about the material on this subject which you have collected.

  

Now,I lost contact with Prof.Young who met me last in 2007,assuring me that he will again meet me in 2009 and we will visit Sehore in M. P. the place of Somanath Vyas,but...  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
