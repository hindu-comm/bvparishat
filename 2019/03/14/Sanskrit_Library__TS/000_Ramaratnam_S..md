We are in the process of building our Sanskrit Library. If we follow Dewy decimal classification, there is a number for Sanskrit literature and subsequent numbers for poetry prose etc. But further than this, classification becomes difficult since there are no numbers for Kalidasa, Bharavi etc. I will be grateful if any person dealing with cataloguing of Sanskrit books gives us guidance.
