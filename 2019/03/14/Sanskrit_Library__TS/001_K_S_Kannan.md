DDC does not do justice to Indian literature  

as it could take account of only the literature familiar to its designers.

A full scale attempt, therefore, to augment and enhance its coverage needs to be taken up

by people qualified in Sanskrit as well as Library Science.

  

A fit topic for PhD perhaps,  

given the vastness, variety, and intricacies of Sanskrit literature.

  

Indigenous schemata as of the 14 or 18 *vidyA-sthAna*-s may also be looked into.

I guess Prof. Varakhedi has re-edited Madhusudana Sarasvati's work.
