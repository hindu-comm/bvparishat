Self shaving is prohibited as per Sastra & one needs to get the shaving done by barber.  

Presently I am under pitru deeksha and shubham is over.

For gettting nivritti from deeksha I referred a book in grantha lipi & I am yet to conclude the day on which this can be done.

अशुभर्क्षे कृते क्षौरे क्षिप्रं कुर्यात् पुनश्शुभे \|  

  

What is the meaning ofअशुभर्क्षे...?

  

Does it mean that , " if shaving is already done due to a azhubham then immediately he should do shaving for zubham"

Request members for the help.
