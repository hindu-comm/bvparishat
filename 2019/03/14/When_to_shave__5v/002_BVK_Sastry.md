On \< What is the meaning ofअशुभर्क्षे...? \> : ashubha - Rukshe =
( If shaving is undertaken on ) an inauspicious - Nakshatra ( rising on that day).



The rise of nakshatra on a given day is to be seen in panchangam.

The shubha-ashubha relation of days nakshatra to the individuals nakshatra : is to be understood from the Jyotishi.

If shaving already done under compulsion of circumstances, the ' praayaschitta' is to be learnt from ' Dharma -Shaastra' and administered with the guidance of Purohita.

**Subject:** {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} When to shave?



Self shaving is prohibited as per Sastra & one needs to get the shaving done by barber.

Presently I am under pitru deeksha and shubham is over.

For gettting nivritti from deeksha I referred a book in grantha lipi & I am yet to conclude the day on which this can be done.

अशुभर्क्षे कृते क्षौरे क्षिप्रं कुर्यात् पुनश्शुभे \|



What is the meaning ofअशुभर्क्षे...?



Does it mean that , " if shaving is already done due to a azhubham then immediately he should do shaving for zubham"

Request members for the help.
