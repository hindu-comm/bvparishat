अशुभर्क्षे means , in the bad constellations, meaning shaving should be done in the prescribed constellations. If at all one happened to shave in the unprescribed constellations , he should shave again in the prescribed constellations.

  

क्षुरकर्मे विहितनक्षत्राणि मुहूर्त गणपतौ -

  

श्रवणत्रितये हस्तत्रितये रेवतीद्वये।

ज्येष्ठायां मृगशीर्षे च वैश्वे पुनर्वसुद्वये।।

क्षुरकर्म बुधैः प्रोक्तं त्यक्त्वा भौमं शनिं रविम्।

अनुराधामुफां चैव कृत्तिकां रोहिणीं मघाम्।।

  

The constellations Ashwini, Mrugasira, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Hasta, Chitra , Swati, Jyeshtha, Uttarashadha, Sharvan, Dhanishtha, Satabhisha and Revati are the prescribed ones for Hair-cut. Shaving and removing of the nails should be done in the above constellations only.

  

Krittika, Rohini, Magha, UttaraPhalguni and Anuradha should be avoided.
