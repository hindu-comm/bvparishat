Walter,  
Interesting post. Some queries :  
  
When Aurel Stein discovered RT, and subsequently, does anyone know how many "very old" copies of this work were extant ?  
  
Why would anyone preserve an unused work for 600+ years?  
  
Presuming more than one copy of RT existed in different parts of the country what might have caused this manuscript to be present in multiple locations?  
  
Shivraj

Dear Mr.  
Pillai,  
this gives me an opportunity to  
point to an inquisitive mind from the 12th  
century, Kalhaṇa, who wrote a history  
of Kashmir. Far from trustingly relying on earlier writers  
or on sacred lore, he made, as he  
says himself, an “effort  
in the present delineation of facts of the past towards  
rectifying in every  
respect what is erroneous“ (tasmād asmin bhūtārthavarṇane  
। sarvaprakāraṃ skhalite yojanāya  
mamodyamaḥ ॥ RT I 10 ॥).  
  
  
In his striving for historical  
facticity, he took great pains to ensure the reliability of  
his data by building  
on reason  
as the primary source of his knowledge, not on myths. He  
reports at some length on the  
sources consulted by him, their nature, accuracy, or  
inaccuracy, as the case  
may be, and on his troublesome efforts to rectify his  
predecessors’ errors by  
carefully checking their data against auxiliary source  
materials such as inscriptions  
and royal grants.  
  
  
Since you aptly mention the ideal  
of  
objectivity - ­ as is well known, ideals are only  
rarely sufficiently achieved  
due to human weaknesses -­, an important point is that  
Kalhaṇa demanded  
impartiality from a writer of  
history:  
  
“Disposing of \[this\] good  
quality \[mentioned  
earlier\], he alone deserves indeed praise, whose speech,  
on giving an account of past matters, refrains from  
affection and  
dislike, as \[would that\] of an  
impartial \[person\].”  
(ślāghyaḥ sa  
eva guṇavān rāgadveṣabahiṣkṛtā  
। bhūtārthakathane yasya stheyasyeva  
sarasvatī ॥ RT I 7 ॥).  
  
  
  
By his attitude and achievements,  
Kalhaṇa  
was clearly ahead of his time and he may indeed be seen as a  
forerunner of historical criticism, albeit  
without influence on, and also without  
recognition in, pre-modern India. All of his successors, Jonarāja,  
Śrīvara and Śuka were Kashmiris. Their historical  
reception, too, remained limited to the valley of Kashmir.  
Despite  
being a Mahākavi, Kalhaṇa received little attention from  
his  
fellow countrymen in the Indian plains until Aurel Stein  
brought his work to  
light by a monumental edition in 1892 (prepared from now  
lost manuscripts) and by  
an English translation in 1900. It was the edition of Stein  
which established Kalhaṇa’s  
fame also in India. Since  
Kalhaṇa  
  
was a seeker of historical truths, he presented the  
truths he had found about kingship in medieval India as  
impartially as he could. We know that the truth  
is not always beautiful, and more often than not it raises  
its ugly face also in  
Kalhaṇa’s history. This might be why he found little  
reception in the rest of  
India. It was all too  
real.
