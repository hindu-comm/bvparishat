Indian epistemology acquired it’s depth because of serious dialogues among philosophical systems. By the 10th century AD, a need was felt to develop a precise methodology of communication in order to understand one another’s position or point of view to make the dialogue meaningful. These attempts resulted in the flowering of the Navya Nyaya school. After it took shape, almost all systems of knowledge in India began to write their treatises employing the language of Navya Nyaya. As it were, it became a universal language of scientific discourse during the second millenium and continues to be so even today in some traditional educational institutions. All our intellectual achievements of the last 1000 years were influenced by the Navya Nyaya school.

However, our present Sanskrit education programmes do not offer any course on Navya Nyaya. As a result, several old works of our tradition lie neglected today.
