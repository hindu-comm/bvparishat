Thanks Prof. Deshpande for the nice and clear note onऌ. I wanted to add that ऌ was already on its way out from the Malayalam language two decades ago when I left India for north America. By now it should be more or less complete. Many in the younger generation might not know what ഌ (ऌ) is. Newspapers have started writing the word കൢപ്തം (kl̥ptam) as ക്ലിപ്തം (kliptam). I saw co-operative societies writingക്ലിപ്തം (kliptam) in their name boards as "XYZ Sahakaraṇa Saṅgham Kliptam" (XYZ Co operative Society Ltd.)

There is a parallel case. My older siblings had to learn at school the dīrgha ൠ and the dīrgha ൡ (long ॠ and long ॡ) but by my time these characters vanished from the school text books. I learnt these because my parents made us recite the entire varṇamālā every vidyārambham (vijayadaśami) day and we had to include these two long vowels in the recitation of the varṇamālā. I think these two long vowels are artificial creation of ancient Sanskrit grammarians and was not part of the language at any time.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
