First, how is the Devanagari character ऌ represented in Roman transliteration? A diacritical dot under ‘l’ (ḷ) is used for ळ and some people use a diacritical bar under ‘l’ (ḻ) for the transcription of the zha of Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu etc. (ഴ ழ ఴ- not sure if modern Telugu uses this). In this brief note, let me represent ऌ with ḽ.

What is the correct pronunciation of ḽ (ऌ)?

In Malayalam, we pronounce it to rhyme with the ṛ (ऋ) of ṛṣi (ऋषि) but there is no ‘r’ sound at all in its pronunciation. For example, in the word കൢപ്തം (kḽptam) meaning ‘limited’ the kḽ rhymes with the kṛ of kṛṣṇa (Krishna) but there is no ‘r’ sound – an approximate representation of the word would be kliptam.

I have heard many people, including some learned people pronounce ḽ like lṛ. I think this is the result of confusion because of the similarity of representation of these characters in Devanagari:

ऌ लृ

In the varṇamālā a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, and then ऌ; la, lā, li, lī, lu, lū and then लृ. So, these are not meant to be pronounced alike, in my humble view.
