Thanks, Shri Warrier, for pointing out the defference between the vowel ऌ in the Varṇamāla or in the Śivasūtra ऋऌक् and a possible ल्+ऋ> लृ (in your words:la, lā, li, lī, lu, lūand thenलृ). The first one does not contain any ऋ. The second one, though theoretically possible does not occur anywhere in the usage of Sanskrit, to the best of my knowledge. The first one, the vowel ऌ, as Patañjali has pointed out, does not occur anywhere other than the forms of the root kl̥p, forms like *kl̥pti*. It does occur in multiple places in Pāṇini's grammatical terminology. The vowel /l/ occurs in the American English pronunciation of words like the adjective "able," \[What this means is that in some English dialects when /l/ occurs at the end of a syllable, it is realized as as a vowel\],but I am not sure if the ancient Sanskrit pronunciation of the vowel ऌ was similar. By the time of Patañjali, the pronunciation of ऋ is explained as an r flanked by two svarabhaktis, rather than as a pure vowel. Something like that was probably the understanding of ऌ by the time of Patañjali, who commenting on the rule कृपो रो ल: says रश्रुतेर्लश्रुतिर्भवति. How the pronunciation was prior to the description by the grammarians can only be guessed. In any case, ऌ had very restricted occurrence in Sanskrit. No true words began with it (except something like ऌकार in grammatical texts), and the Prātiśākhyas clearly say that no words ended in ऌ (अन्-ऌकार: स्वर: पद्य:, Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā).
