Prof Korada,

I admire your erudite analysis.

I do take a scientific view. Human expression

is not controlled by grammar, it is cognitive and

neurological. Why human beings create suffixes

to create relationship is a challenging topic in

brain science (not attempted yet). Grammar  

only catalogs and codes it. Unfortunately the late

languages are "learned" and so they appear "coded".

There is a difference in translating a thought  

to expression and in communication. The latter

needs a binary transformation, the former is unitary,

and hence possibly universal (characteristic of man!).

Best regards,

BM
