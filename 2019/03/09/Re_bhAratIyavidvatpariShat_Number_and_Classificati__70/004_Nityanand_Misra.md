Rightly said. I may add that for the inimitable Dr. Slaje, good manners in Indology are the prerogative of Western academics. For example, Prof. Goldman [publicly calling](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-July/041704.html) a critic's works“wretched and ignorant” and claiming that a late Indian translator largely plagiarized his translation of theRāmāyaṇa would be the pinnacle of good manners. But when Goldman’stranslation, acclaimed as the “first reliably accurate English translation of the *Rāmāyaṇa*” \[sic\], and Sanskrit pronunciation is shown by a native to have errors, it is the pinnacle of bad manners. Doniger and Pollock ridiculing their Indian critics or saying things like there are no good Indian scholars left or no Indian scholar deserves to be published by a Western press is good manners, but natives having a laugh at the expense of Western academics or saying that an Indian publication like Gita Press produces superior translations are bad manners.

  

I mince no words: my view is that Dr. Slaje, like many other Western Sanskritists, is living in a fool’s paradise.
