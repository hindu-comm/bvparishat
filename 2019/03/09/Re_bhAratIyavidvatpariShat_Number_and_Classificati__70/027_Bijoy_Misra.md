That's where Goldman comes in. The text has to be interpreted at its time of creation, not mapped in a different time.  

But as I said before Tulasi has a whole different take.  

Valmiki's Rama is विष्णुसम, Tulasi's Rama is विष्णु अवतार

Valmiki has no religion in the text, Rama justifies action by arguing.  

Valmiki's Rama is respected as King Dasaratha's son,  

Tulasi's Rama is worshiped as Divinity by knowledgeable people where he goes.

The statement "multiple Ramayana" phrase is not only a  

misnomer it is erroneous from the literary point of view.

Various people have taken the plot and composed their own version.  

The word "Ramayana" belongs to Valmiki.

In Tulasi it is Ramacharitamanasa.  

Others may not be so careful..
