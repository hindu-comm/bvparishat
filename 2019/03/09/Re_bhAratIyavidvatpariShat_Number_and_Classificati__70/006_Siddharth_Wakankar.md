In my childhood,I heard that the western Sanskrit scholars were derogatively termed as white.skinned scholars and were ridiculed for their selfish and anti.hindu views and ulterior motives in studying and interpreting Sanskrit literature.

It seems this trait continues with some worthy exceptions .

  

Sometimes,some blinded indian scholars also are following in their footsteps,proving the line

  

तनसे आझाद हो गये मनसे गयी ना गुलामी.

  

What is the outcome of this tendency is unknown. It is a travesty of destiny.
