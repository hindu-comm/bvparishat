Dr BM,  
Valmiki's Ramayana in my understanding (e.g. look at the astronomical detail) has come down to us by transmission through different ages (acquiring many language mutations along the way). Even then, the narrative still belongs to tretA yuga; compared to that Tulsidasa has his reference set in kali yuga and the chasm between Rama and his framework is consequently much bigger.  
Dr Korada has put his thoughts in a new thread that covers many important points. Essential perspectives from - for example - even Jyotisha framework cannot be overlooked.
