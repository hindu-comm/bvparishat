Translation studies recognizes a wide range of translations as agreeable. Being firmly entrenched in a post-structuralism framework, there is no concept of 'correct' or 'incorrect' translation, the way the field is evolving. For instance, while translating the Bible, it is seen that translating lambs into seal pups is okay as long as seal pups play the same role in the culture of the destination language as lambs played in the Middle-eastern culture around the time of Christ. Fidelity to the original is no longer a central feature. So it is pretty much "anything goes". So it is more of transcrsation. It is precisely under this self-granted license that obnoxious translations are being done.

  

So, when mistakes are pointed out, there is not even a sense of shame in the translator, because fidelity to the original is no longer required in the translator's view-point. And the campaign to malign Indian culture goes on.

  

Hence, the effort to expose philology as a flawed framework is more relevant and effective.

  

How does it translate in practice? For Dr. Slaje it is bad manners on part of Sri Nityananda Mishra to point out errors of pronunciation, but the portrayal of Sri Rama, worshipped by millions, in a depraved manner is academic freedom. This is the deep flaw that needs to be exposed. This becomes the central issue and the the catalogue of mistakes become sahakaarins to the main thrust.
