Dear Prof. Paturi-ji,



I was touched and moved by your very kind post in a thread on a rather contentious topic. You are right that I don’t mind you sharing my views about two of my professors who, as was and still is typical in my limited experience, were quite sympathetic to the Hindu ideas that they taught. Yes, I well remember your apt words:



“It is heartening to see that there are stilla very big number of Sanskrit scholars in US, who still live the sensitivity encouraged by likes of Prof. Ingalls. Though uneventful journeys do not get reported as news,they are theones passengers love!”



Glad to hear your encouraging report of the conference you attended on “Rediscovering Mother Sita and Her Relevance Today.” Thank you also for quoting Robert Goldman’s full letter disagreeing with Audrey Truschke’s very inappropriate comment about Sītā. I suppose Audrey now regrets making that comment.



Regarding Robert Goldman’s translation of the Rāṃāyaṇa: You have raised an important question, as to whether someone who uses psychoanalysis regarding certain events in the Hanuman episodes, or who attributes the śṛṅgāra-rasa to an episode in which it cannot occur, can do an accurate translation of the book. This raises in my mind the question as to what extent have such things influenced the translation. I have today read in the Goldmans’ translation of this kāṇḍa some of the Hanuman episodes referred to, and I did not see anything in the translation that would reflect such views. All of the Goldmans’ translations were based heavily on the Indian pandit tradition, following their teachers.



The Goldman Rāṃāyaṇa translation is expensive, and is hard for people (including myself) to afford. For this reason, it may be that some who have criticized it do not know that they are in part criticizing the Indian pandit tradition. Goldman writes in his prefaces how heavily their translations are dependent on their Indian teachers. Since not everyone has access to these books, I will here quote some of his statements on this:



“First I should like to express my great debt of gratitude to my friend, colleague, and teacher, Pt. T. S. Śrīnivāsa Śāstrī of the Deccan College, Poona, who graciously, patiently, and learnedly read through the entire text of the *Bālakāṇḍa* and five Sanskrit commentaries on it during 1974-1975, clarifying for me dozens of points that seemed hopelessly obscure. His knowledge of the *Rāmāyaṇa* is breathtaking, and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that he knows the text virtually by heart. There is hardly a line of the translation and annotation that has not benefited in some way from his profound learning, deep insight into Sanskrit stylistics, and boundless generosity.” (vol. 1, 1984, p. xvi)



“In 1974-1975 I had the privilege and pleasure of reading the *Bālakāṇḍa* with Pandit Śrīnivāsa Śāstri of the Deccan College in Poona. He had read the entire epic through several times and knew it intimately. Day after day he would clearly and brilliantly elucidate for me words, phrases, and passages that had seemed utterly opaque. Yet, not infrequently, even he would find a passage lucid at first glance, remarking without hesitation, *ahaṃ vacmi*, ‘I’ll explain it,’ only to stare at it, examine four or five Sanskrit commentaries, and conclude by saying, *īśvaro veda*, ‘God knows!’” (vol. 1, 1984, p. 106, fn. 18)



“Of the dozens of learned scholars who assisted us in so many ways, there are two whose mention we must reserve until last; for their affection and generosity to us in connection with this project was superlative and far greater than we can in any sense hope to repay. These are our guru, Pt. T. Shrinivas Shastri, formerly of the Deccan College, Pune, and Mr. K. Venugopalan of the Sanskrit Dictionary Department of that same institution.

“Throughout the greater part of our eight-month stay in Pune, they graciously met with us for many hours each week to review, discuss, and clarify the many difficulties in the text and the commentaries we encountered during the course of our reading of the *Sundarakāṇḍa*. Śāstrī-ji was an unfailing source of profound learning and insight into the *Rāmāyāṇa*, its commentaries, and above all the vast array of *śāstraic* literature one has to master to be truly conversant with this encyclopedic epic. . . .

“To both of these men the present volume owes more than can be easily expressed in mere words. Although in their modesty they would perhaps deny it, much of what is good in this work is owed to their learning.” (vol. 5, 1996, p. xiv)



“First and foremost, we must express our gratitude to our friend, colleague, and guru, Dr. Ram Karan Sharma, the founder and former *kulapati* of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. During his many protracted visits to Berkeley, Dr. Sharma ungrudgingly spent many hours with us reading over difficult passages in the text and the commentaries, and sharing with us his profound reservoir of knowledge of a vast spectrum of the Sanskrit literary and śāstraic corpora. Time and again his knowledge and insight clarified a problem that had left us utterly at a loss. We gratefully acknowledge his learned and unstinting assistance, mindful always of the vedic injunction, ‘*gurudevo bhava*.’” (vol. 6, 2009, p. xiv)



“Let us then begin by recalling the help of several immensely learned Indian scholars whose knowledge and love of the *Rāmāyaṇa* was unparalleled. All of these *paṇḍitarājas* are, sadly, now no more. First, we would like to thank Pt. Dr. V. W. Paranjpe of the Deccan College, with whom we had the opportunity to read the Sanskrit epics with their commentaries over several years in Pune and Berkeley. Thanks are also due to scholars who advised me and others involved with the project who gave unstintingly of their knowledge and assistance. Chief among them are the immensely learned Sanskrit *sāhityaśāstrin* Dr. V. Raghavan; the extraordinary *vaiyākaraṇa* Dr. S. D. Joshi of Poona Vidyapith; and, of course, the great *Rāmāyaṇa* authority Dr. Umakant Shah of the M. S. University of Baroda, who was also the director and general editor of the critical edition.

“But our most profound and most affectionate gratitude belongs to Pt. T. Srinivas Shastri, who was long associated with the Dictionary Department of the Deccan College. For the years 1968-1970, 1974-1975, and 1992, we had the pleasure and privilege of reading and discussing the *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa* and many of its commentaries with him. His vast learning, exquisite Sanskrit, and boundless intellectual generosity set a standard that we can only hope to live up to. We would be remiss, also, if we were to fail to mention Mr. K. Venugopalan, also of the Deccan College Dictionary Project, who frequently sat in on our reading sessions with Shastri-ji and whose comments and clarifications, like many of those of the scholars mentioned above, contributed in countless ways to our understanding of this great work of literature and to our modest attempt to render it into a form that can be enjoyed by and, we hope, be of value to those who are not able to savor its riches in the original Sanskrit.” (vol. 7, 2017, pp. xviii-xix)

“Finally, and most of all, we offer our humble obeisance to the first and foremost of poets, *ṛṣi* Vālmīki himself, who has given the world the undying delight of his grand poetic history of Sītārāma.” (vol. 7, 2017, p. xx)



I do not know of any westerners who have a greater love for the Rāmāyaṇa than Robert and Sally Goldman. Because the Rāmāyaṇa was seen in academia more as a work of literature than a religious text, they did not have to maintain a scholarly demeanor of keeping a distance from it. They could, and did, embrace it openly. As Robert said at the beginning of this short video (“Famous Ramayana epic now in modern English” <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNoF5NaRE80>): “We love the text, not only because of its beauty—the language is very beautiful, the poetry is very lovely, emotions that are represented in it are very deep and compelling—the characters are very striking, and remain in one’s imagination forever.” Their genuine love for the Rāmāyaṇa has shown itself in them spending their entire lives on it, and I see this love for it reflected in the care with which they made their translation.



So, yes, in my opinion they can make, and indeed have made, an accurate translation of the Rāmāyaṇa.
