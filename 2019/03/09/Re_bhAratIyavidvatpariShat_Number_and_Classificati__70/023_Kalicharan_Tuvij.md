Namaste,

The only successful translation of Valmiki's Ramayana is Tulsidasa's Ramayana.  
And if we went by some other yardstick such as word-by-word appropriateness then Valmiki's Ramayana itself could probably become "a bad translation of itself". The text is simply not meant to be parsed like that.  
Gitapress translation is though still useful (and justified) in the sense it helps people access and appreciate the original for themselves.
