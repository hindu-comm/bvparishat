Dear Dr Tuvij,

I won't agree with this assertion. Tulasi follows Valmiki in the plot but makes his own version.

Valmiki's Rama is a good man, a prince (सत्यवान् धार्मिक वेदज्ञ
शुचिमान् ...), Tulasi's Rama is an

incarnation (सगुण ब्रह्म).

I started studying Tulasi for religious purposes (I had to perform as a priest before we had the Temple)

in the local community before I gravitated to Valmiki. Our next akhanda (26th year) is April 6-7.

I love Tulasi for his music, I admire Valmiki in poetry ( I don't know his music, he claims he had!)

Attaching the announcement (pardon the transliteration, the Temple Manager won't care!)

Best regards,

BM
