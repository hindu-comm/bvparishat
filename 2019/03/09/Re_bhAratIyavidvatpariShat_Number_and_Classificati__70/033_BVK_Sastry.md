Namaste

***BVK Sastry ( on** ***The feminine stem of rāma is certainly not rām**ī**, but rām**ā**.\>

 What is feminine form of person ' Rama'? should it be derived like ' deva to devi' or ' krishna to krishnaa / shiva to shivaa '?

 If ' रामा' is to be treated as feminine form of ' rAma', it would mean a ' lady of Rama' (His women/ related women to the designated individual); not necessarily ' feminine form of 'Rama'. It would be absurd communication. 

 If '' रामा' ' is to be treated as ' beautiful lady' as per kosha, then it is a standalone term, on its own merit ! ; and not a derived feminine gender formation.

'ramana ( husband) ' will not be the masculine base to derive the feminine form' ramanI (beautiful lady)'.

***BVK Sastry ( on** ***\< रामी च रामश्च रामौ is plainly wrong.> and \< Correct one is रामा च रामश्च रामौ!> I don't find the word रामी but रामा asसुन्दरी रमणी रामा कोपना सैव भामिनी ।। \>



 We may be entering here to the nuances of Paninian
grammar technicality in enabling the 'Samasa' between two terms
without clarifying their mutual relation and justified application of ' rules governing the ' dvandva' samasa' by ' Technical competence= Saamarthya of pada-vidhi'.



As given \< रामा च रामश्च रामौ ! > would mean compounding two
words: \< beautiful lady (रामा) and a person designated as Rama (राम) \>.

The connection between the compounding terms needs to be brought out . If the dissolution of the compound is by rules governing 'dvanda', then the final outcome cannot be interpreted to mean 'And' ( =cha-arthe) or ' grouping = (samucchaya). Why ? Because the compounding terms have no numeric (saMkhyA) or adjectival relations (visheshana-) . It is not just telling like ' beautiful women' and person called Rama' combined would yield a term 'rAmau' = ' two rAma's together'.



On the other hand if taking the adjectival relation, we need to invoke ' Tatpurusha or other samasa', then appropriate rule needs to be invoked; The ''ca-' construction cannot stand. The compounded term 'ramau' needs a different justification or rejection. The question is how to group together 'beautiful women and an individual Rama' to yield a singular designator.



On justifying ' रामी' - Samskruth grammarians ingenuities can always find different ways of explaining the final form ! and use of pratyaya's and rules/ exceptions. ( like kAmI from kAma and thenmaking kAmin and then derived form). But would it be worth all that intellectual exertion and defending an apashabda usage ? ? I am not sure.



Coming to the classical textual tradition ' rAmascha, rAmascha - etayoh samAharaH - can yield rAmau; meaning Two ramas, under the dwandva rule.

If it is many ' rama' persons , then outcome becomes 'rAmAH'- as a compound word, distinct from prathama- bahuvachana.



Look forward for grammarians to clarify the ' previous posts based on ' sAmarthya' and 'vivkShA'.



***BVK Sastry ( on***'quoting Prof. Koradas thread'.\< . I found the explanation in a thread of Korada itself. Hence it cannot be a mistake.> :



 The entire debate was on the ' artha' and why this context was forgotten?
