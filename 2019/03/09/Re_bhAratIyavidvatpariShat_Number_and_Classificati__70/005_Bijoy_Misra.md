I must confess that my interest in Indology was provoked by these

arbitrary adjectives thrown at each other among the western "academicians"

and more at the Indian counterparts in "scholarly" exchanges. This low level  

of insecure expression remains to be sanitized, I realize that manners and  

attitude refine slowly, Barbarism and violence are the inner call of the ego!

Literature on human conduct is lacking in the west. The schools teach

"individuality", and not "group living.". It is a long way to go in the path

of progress in society. "individuality" might be seeping into the Indian

society through the media corroding the long-established principle of  

mutual respect.
