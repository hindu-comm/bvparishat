Quoting Dr Korada from that thread :  
  
"Since तत्समशब्द-s are used in the translation of the epic into Indian vernaculars there may not be much problem .  
  
If at all one wants to translate into any other language such as French / English / Deutsche / Spanish etc. the translator be first trained for at least a couple of years in Sanskrit tradition and while doing his work he should adapt terms like - धर्म / योग / तपस् / स्वाध्याय / पुण्य etc , which are pregnant with meaning and offer footnotes / end notes -- so it will be transplanation rather than translation ."  
  
Indeed a golden rule for bare minimum requirements.
