Dear Dr. Misra,



Thank you for your personal advice to me regarding how to experience the poetry of a poetic text like the Rāmāyaṇa. Certainly I am in no position to evaluate translations of poetic texts in terms of their poetry, and I did not use this as a criterion in forming my opinion about the accuracy of the Goldman Rāmāyaṇa translation. It may be that the kind of translation you are advocating is more like a “transcreation,” as P. Lal called it, in his transcreations of almost all of the Mahābhārata that he was able to complete before he died.

  

Best regards,
