Dear Nagarajji,

Thank you for publishing this exchange. Many in the west are interested in rasa

without ever studying the original texts or analyzing the poetic context. I do not

know how rasa research has entered the west as a psychological aberration.

As I had suggested earlier, a well-grounded course by a good Indian

University could help educate many of the researchers who might have genuine

interest to study the theory. The basis of western thinking on the topic is

erroneous and many are victims of it without knowing.  

Best regards,

BM
