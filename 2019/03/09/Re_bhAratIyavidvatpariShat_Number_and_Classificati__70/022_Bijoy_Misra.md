Dear David,

What I realize that you never read Valmiki in its Devanagari script and do not have any concept of the

poetics or the use of words in expressing poetry. A poem is loudly read, recited and meditated.

This is also in western tradition, a music conductor dives into the composition in its entirety before

attempting to interpret (my son does opera for a living). I strongly advise you to try this before you  

comment on a text. Let us qualify ourselves to be a scholar on the topic that we may comment.  

Commentary is the not the use of syntax or appropriation of words. You need to understand rasa

as a concept, you need to experience it in poetry.  

  

Meeting scholars and getting generous time from them does not validate errors in concept or does

not condone the lack of expertise. It is a practice among many in the west to learn words from

others and then write books on their own. A student also needs qualification. It could need thirty years

of residence to be able to learn Sanskrit and understand the language.
Dr Goldman or anyone could  

send the manuscript for review with the scholars before going to press.  

  

It is a pity that India still reels through the exploitation that was imposed through several centuries of

occupation. Many of our friends in search of "doing something" began vandalizing the tradition. Some

of them still do. Appreciating ignorance is a part of our maturity and intellect, it is hard. "Liking"

something is not a qualification, "walking" is. Please walk quietly, you may learn. You could do

what's right.  

  

I am sorry that I might sound unfriendly in this mail, but observing such vandalism prompted me to  

digress from my work in space to study India. More I see, I get disturbed with the connotation, abuse

and the casualness. A poem is a woman, improper touching itself is an abuse. Many of people writing  

books on Indian material are not qualified to touch the text let alone write commentary. Apparently you  

yourself have produced some translations, I cannot say the quality or your audience.

  

While I admire your enthusiasm to learn, I wanted to convey the cultural implication of texts in India.

You may learn if you identify. The latter is not easy. "they do" is the textual commentary. That

is where the trap is. I gave a lecture last year here in Town Hall, sharing.
