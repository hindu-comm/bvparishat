sarvebhyo namaḥ  
  
I think the issue of rāmā & rāmī has been settled (as Dr. Korada Subrahmanyam has stated in detail twice in this thread).  
  
Both these endings (-ā &-ī)are therefore correct feminine forms but their use differs by context.  
  
. To give another example:  

-   gaṇaka means male mathematician -   gaṇakā means female mathematician-(ṭāP pratyaya as per Pāṇini) -   gaṇakī means wife of the male mathematician (the gaṇakī does not
    have to be a mathematician herself)-ṅīṢ pratyaya as per Pāṇini

If anyone disagrees with the aboveconclusion, please provide grammatical reasons.  
  
Dhanyo'smi,
