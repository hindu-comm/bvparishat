Dear Sri David-ji,

  

You made a mention of your individual mails to Sri Nityanand-ji in your previous post in the present thread. I too received individual mails from you from which I get to understand that you have absorbed many Hindu-Buddhist ideas into your personality and have a wholehearted respect for them. You expressed your disappointment and displeasure too with regard to some Indologists who look down upon Sanskrit and Sanskrit epics etc. (Prof. Robert Goldman or Sally Sutherland Goldman were obviously not one of those with whose ideas you disagreed). I think you don't mind my sharing your views about the two pro-Hindu professors here:

You also said,

With regard to the small number of Indologists who in your view are not ' typical of American Indologists' , you said,

You may remember that I reminded you my words expressing the same view of small number attracting more attention. My words were :

I recently attended a conference organisedby a US based organisationGlobal Peace Initiative of Women which works in the area of Climate Change and other Environmental issues. The very title of the conference is"Rediscovering Mother Sita and Her Relevance Today " .
Please note the word Mother Sita.

  

Dena Merriam , the convener and founder of GPIW wrote a book on Mother Sita and during its inauguration, she spoke of her personal experiences with Mother Sita.

  

During this conference, many western individuals analysed the topic with a great respect for Mother Sita with a good rigour of analysis.

  

Prof. Robert Goldman did not agree with Dr Audrey Truschke during the recent controversy and he said,

---------------------------

  

But what comes in the way of agreeing with your assertion that Prof. Robert Goldman's translation is the most accurate so far , is the Introduction to Volume V of their work. (You too quoted from their introduction, but of the first volume). He uses psychoanalysis to talk about certain events in the Hanuman episodes of the narrative. It is accessible at<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sFmsrEszbxgC&pg=PA52>

  

Sharing a snapshot of the relevant page.

  

At another place, he says there is S'ringara rasa in the episode where Hanuman is looking for Sita in the Ravana's quarters where women are sleeping.

  

Sharing a snapshot of that too here.

  

Commenting on that in this list, I said:

Such views of Prof. Goldman certainly come in the way of accepting that he can do an accurate translation of the book.
