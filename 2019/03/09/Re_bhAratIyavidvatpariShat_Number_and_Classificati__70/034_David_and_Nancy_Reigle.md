Dear Prof. Paturi-ji,



You have made an excellent summary of my email, thanks. I fully agree with your conclusion that the merit of the actual translation needs to be evaluated in its own right. Yes, indeed, if others see inaccuracy where I see accuracy, that is fair enough.



You make a very good point regarding the high cost of the Goldman translation versus the low cost of the Gita Press translation, making the Gita Press one the best choice for many people. I have always had a high regard for the accuracy of the Gita Press English translation; and although I have other translations, that is the one I would turn to before the Goldman translation of the critical edition was completed. The translator, Sri Cimmanlal Goswami, wrote in the Publisher’s Note to volume 1:



“In our translation we have tried to reproduce the meaning of the original as best as possible so as to enable the reader to follow the text word by word, and made it as close as possible, preserving even the grammatical peculiarities of the original and translating even indeclinables like ca, khalu, vai, hi, ha, nu and so on, which cannot be called redundant in the work of a Ṛṣi.”



What you bring up about Prof. Sheldon Pollock is a huge issue, one that has probably contributed mightily to whatever poor reception Goldman’s Rāmāyaṇa translation has had. As everyone on this list knows, statements made by Sheldon Pollock elicited a response from Sri Rajiv Malhotra in the form of his book, The Battle for Sanskrit. Many readers of that book came to look unfavorably upon everything that Pollock was associated with. Since Pollock translated volumes 2 and 3 for the 7-volume Rāmāyaṇa translation project edited by Robert Goldman, views about Pollock have perhaps automatically been extended also to Goldman. This seems to me very unfortunate.



I do not know Sheldon Pollock. I had never heard of his controversial views until Rajiv Malhotra’s book came under discussion. I have not examined his Rāmāyaṇa translations looking for influence of his views on them. It is possible that these translations were made before he developed the views in question. They were published in 1986 and 1991. I simply do not know. For that matter, I do not know Rosalind Lefeber, who translated volume 4 of the Rāmāyaṇa edited by Robert Goldman. Under the circumstances, it is best for me to clarify what I said about the accuracy of the Goldman Rāmāyaṇa translation, that it would specifically apply to the volumes done by Robert and Sally Goldman, namely, volumes 1, 5, 6, and 7.

  

Best regards,
