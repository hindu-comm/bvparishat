Dear members of the Bhāratīyavidvatpariṣat,  
  
I have compiled the most important arguments in connection with the phrase रामी च रामश्च रामौ:  
  
(1)

  
\> If 'रामा' is to be treated as feminine form of 'rAma', it would mean  
\> a 'lady of Rama' (His women/ related women to the  
\> designated individual); not necessarily 'feminine form of 'Rama'.  
\> It would be absurd communication.  
  

\(2\)

  
\> If ''रामा'' is to be treated as 'beautiful lady' as per kosha, then it is a standalone term,  

\> on its own merit!; and not a derived feminine gender formation.  
  
(3)

  
\> As given \<रामा च रामश्च रामौ !> would mean compounding two words:  
\> beautiful lady (रामा) and a person designated as Rama (राम)  
  

\(4\)

  
\> It is not just telling like 'beautiful women' and person called Rama'  
\> combined would yield a term 'rAmau' = 'two rAma's  
\> together'  
  

\(5\)

  
\> When two forms for the genitive form with feminine ending are possible  
\> for the same word, and one of the forms has  
\> potential to cause ambiguity, the other form which does not lead to such ambiguity is chosen.  
  
  

Let us take the dual form *śivau* ("Pārvatī and Śiva"). According to the arguments above, one must not parse *śivau* as *śivā ca śivaś ca,* because  
  
(1) *śivā* "as feminine form of" *śiva*, "it would mean a 'lady of'" *śiva* \[...\]. "It would be absurd communication."  
  
(2) "If" *śivā* "is to be treated as" 'a jackal' "as per kosha \[and according to its standard usage in Sanskrit literature\], then it is a standalone term, on its own merit!; and not a derived feminine gender formation."  
  
(3) "As given \<*śivā ca śivaś ca śivau*!> would mean compounding two words:" jackal (*śivā*) "and a person designated as" Śiva (*śiva*).  
  
(4) "It is not just telling like" 'jackal' "and person called" 'Śiva' "combined would yield a term" '*śivau*' "= 'two" śiva-s  
"together'".  
  
(5) "When two forms for the genitive form with feminine ending are possible for the same word, and one of the forms has potential to cause ambiguity, the other form which does not lead to such ambiguity is chosen."  
  
\* \* \*  
  
In Bhāravī's *Kirātārjunīya* (5.40) we come across the genitive dual *śivayoḥ*. Mallinātha comments: *śivā ca śivaś ca tayoḥ śivayor umāśaṅkarayoḥ / pumān striyā* (= Pāṇini 1.2.67) *ity* *ekaśeṣaḥ*. Obviously, Mallinātha does not have any grammatical and semantic difficulties using the regular feminine form *śivā* (*śivaḥ, śivā, śivam*) in spite of the common meaning of the noun *śivā* ("jackal"). Accordingly, he would certainly have analyzed *rāmā ca rāmaś ca tayoḥ rāmayor sītārāmayoḥ* by use of the regular feminine form rāmā (*rāmaḥ, rāmā, rāmam*).  
  
\[Also compare Apte s.v. *rāmā*: *ramate 'nayā ram karaṇe ghañ*.\]

  
  
  
\> On justifying ' रामी' - Samskruth grammarians ingenuities can always  
\> find different ways of explaining the final form !  
  

That speaks for itself.
