Roland,  
Since you don't seem to be agreeing with what some scholars have written perhaps you will be amenable in doing an experiment? This may or may not help resolve the matter at hand. YMMV.  
  
If you have contacts in India perhaps they can help answering these questions independently:  
a) What is a married lady or a mother from Jhala ( a rajput clan ) called? : Jhali Ji  
b) What is the wife of a Gupta ( a mercantile caste of India) called? : Guptani Ji  
c) What is the wife of a Gujar (a caste in India ) called?: Gujari Ji  
d) What is the wife of a Jhinwar (another caste in India ) called? Jhinwari Ji  
e) What is the wife of a Jat ( caste in India ) called? Jatni Ji  
  
Ji is just an honorific.
