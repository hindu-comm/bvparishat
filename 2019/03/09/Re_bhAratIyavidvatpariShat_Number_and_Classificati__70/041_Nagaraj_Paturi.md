Dear Prof. Misra,

  

Our love and respect for our language, literature and/or culture need not make us so aggressive in our tone towards even those who do not share the hatred towards the subject matter of their own discipline that we see in others and more over have a genuine love and respect for what they study with great rigour, intensity, width and depth and get transformed into living what they study.

  

Regards,
