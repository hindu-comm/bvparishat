Dear Sri Bijoy Misra,

  

Thank you for the information that there is a huge difference between the Hindi translation of the Valmiki Ramayana by the Gita Press and their English translation. Since I do not know Hindi, I was not aware of this. Is the Hindi translator the same person as the English translator, Cimmanlal Goswami?  

  

Also, does anyone know if the English translation now published by the Gita Press is complete? I purchased my copy many years ago, and at that time it ended with sarga 41 of the uttara-kanda, about halfway through this kanda. This was due to the death of the translator, Sri Cimmanlal Goswami. Perhaps someone later completed the translation.

  

Glad to learn of your forthcoming English translation of the Ramayana. From your posts here, I get the impression that you have a very high poetic sense. So your translation is likely to be quite different from previous translations. Wishing you all the best with it.

  

Best regards,
