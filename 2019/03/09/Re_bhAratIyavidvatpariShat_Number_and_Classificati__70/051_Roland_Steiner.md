Dear Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan,  

  
\> 1. rAmI ca rAmascha is wrong and only rAmA ca ramasca is correct, or  
\> 2. both are correct?  
  

I made two points: 1. The arguments against the  
correctness/suitableness of rāmā are untenable. 2. rāmā is the  
expected correct form. I leave everything else to your own and the  
list members' judgement.  
  
Not only for time reasons, I have to say goodbye to his thread now.  
  
Regards,  
Roland Steiner
