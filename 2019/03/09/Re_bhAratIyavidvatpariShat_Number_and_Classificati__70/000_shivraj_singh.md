Has anyone done any analysis on how many errors are there in Goldman's Ramayan translation?  
  
Is there any methodology on how to classify such translation errors?  
  
If we don't have any classification methodology is it possible to comeup with one?  
  
typos/spelling errors could be the most trivial category: Type 0 Error  
  
wrong translation of a word which doesn't impact the overall meaning of the shloka: Type 1 Error  
  
wrong translation of a word(s) which alters the meaning of the shloka : Type 2 Error.  
  
An example of Type 1 Error could be VR 2.7.5 (2.7.9 Gita Press edition ) which is being discussed in the other thread. In this shloka calling Ram's mother miserly may not seem to be a big deal but the same line has the word Sati for her. Is Sati for Ram's mother to be taken positively or negatively? If positively then how does miserly fit into this context?  
  
An example of Type 2 Error could be a translation by Dr Witzel of Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra(18.44) (Witzel, M. 1995. Rigvedic history: poets, chieftains and polities. In George Erdosy (ed.) The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia, pp. 307-52. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. Page 320-21) :  
  
Pra-n.a-yauh. pravavra-ja tasyaite Kuru--Pan\~cha-la-h. Ka-śi- -Videha- ity etad A-yavam pravrājam. Pratyan. Ama-vasus tasyaite Ga-ndha-rayas Parśvo Ara-t.t.a- itya etad A-ma-vasavam  
  
Witzel's translation:  
"Aya went eastwards. His (people) are the Kuru-Pancalas and Kasi Videha. This is the Ayava(migration).(His other people)stayed at home in the west. His people are the Gandhari, Parasu and Aratta. This is the Amavasava (group)."  
  
BB Lal's translation:  
"Ayu migrated eastwards. His (people) are the Kuru-Pancalas and the Kasi-Videhas. This is the Ayava (migration). Amavasu migrated westwards. His (people) are the Ghandhari, Parsu and Aratta. This is the Amavasu (migration)."  
  
And the reasons Lal gives for wrong translation of Witzel:  
"In the first part, i.e. in ‘prāṅayuh … pravrājam’ the verb used is ‘pravavrāja’, which means ‘migrated’. In the second part, i.e. in ‘pratyaṅamāvasuḥ …. amāvasam’ the verb is not repeated. However, according to the well known rules of grammar, it has got to be same as in the first part i.e. it has to be ‘pravavrāja’. As a result, the second part would mean that ‘Amāvasuh migrated westwards and his descendants are the Gāndhārī, Parśu and Araṭ̣ṭa.’ "  
  
This kind of error where the meaning of the shloka is altered would be a type 2 error.

Well, let  
me say this: I am neither an acquaintance of Professor  
Goldman nor would I ever  
want to interfere in a serious academic discussion between  
Professor Goldman  
and someone else. Personally I am absolutely neutral in this  
matter and always  
ready to correct any evident errors. This is the way  
truth-seeking scholars would  
proceed under normal  
circumstances.  
  
But these  
staged interviews give the impression of a prosecution with  
only the denouncer  
present and the accused absent. Publicly mocking a deserved  
scholar for one  
wrong articulation, who has dedicated a research life to  
Indian literature and who  
has achieved  
more  
  
for the international reputation of India's  
long-gone  
  
culture than any  
of his self-styled know-it-all critics, appears to me as the  
pinnacle of bad  
manners.  
  
In my previous  
post I have retained the original wording  
(except for the guffaws) of Dr Mishra and his  
administrator – thankfully  
denounced by someone on this list as “racist stuff “­  
­ and have changed  
only  
  
a  
couple of characteristic sounds with a view to helping also  
others to understand  
the essence of this appalling posing, which is palpably  
meant as a public  
execution for the amusement of an applauding  
audience.  
  
What we get  
from tasteless videos of the kind now in circulation on this  
allegedly  
scholarly list are not so much gloatingly and  
self-righteously insinuated “schoolboy  
errors” of “white” American scholars. What we actually  
witness can be reduced basically  
to bad behaviour. The lack of manners displayed here reminds  
one of two lads bathing  
themselves openly in the limelight of their self-centredness  
fully unaware of the  
way in which they expose themselves to the educated. In the  
present case it was  
done in the spirit of a Swadeshi Indology with the naive  
belief of Sanskrit in Indian  
genes with unchanged meanings inherited in an unchanging  
chain of tradition with no  
history.  
  
The mean traits  
of blatant ātma-stuti, para-nindā and  
abhimāna  
are so obvious that I bid adieu to this  
thread.  
Good bye,WS
