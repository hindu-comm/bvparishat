Prof Korada and friends,

The analysis presented while obvious is above the pay-grade of the

students, whose teachers have frozen them otherwise.

What we are witnessing the real-time display of shallowness and

lack of understanding on words. I discovered it with another published  

author some thirty years ago before I took upon myself to study Panini.

Quick conclusions without analysis are also entering the minds of

Indian scholars as I notice occasionally. Our latest hypothesis is

that the words are connected to our cognitive processing in the brain  

and not in our utterance!

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
