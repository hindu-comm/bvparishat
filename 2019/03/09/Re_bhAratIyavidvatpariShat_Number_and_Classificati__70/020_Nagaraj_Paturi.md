Dear Sri David-ji,

  

Glad to know that you are happy with my sharing your views.

  

Summary of your mail below is the following:

  

1\. Prof. Robert Goldman took help from several panditas as well acknowledged by him , so his translation is not against the pandita tradition of understanding Ramayana, moreover it is as per that tradition only.

  

2\. He has great admiration for Valmiki as a poet, so he can not do any damage to the poetic beauty of the kaavya.

  

3\. His psychoanalysis of Hanuman or wrong application of S'ringaara rasa where, as per the rasa s'aastra or the rasajnengita, it is not to be applied, does not necessarily mean that in the actual translation of the s'lokas where the events viewed through such wrong tools and wrong application of tools is used by him can be wrong.

  

With regard to # 3 above, yes there is a theoretical possibility merit of his translation need not necessarily be affected by his wrongs as mentioned above. This theoretical possibility has the other side also. There is a possibility of such a receiver of the book possibly committing mistakes in translation too. That means that the merits of the actual translation needs to be evaluated in its own right. You as one of the receivers of his translation, a highly learned, trained and well informed one at that, would like to attest that his translation is accurate. Fair enough. Others like Sri Nityanand-ji may see inaccuracies. Even that is enough fair.

  

------------

  

But the crucial issue here is this:

  

Even as per your view Prof. Goldman's translation is *not inferior to* the Gita Press one. Prof. Goldman's book is expensive and even you as per your own assertion can not afford it .

  

Gita Press book is highly affordable and sets a benchmark to which evaluators of books like Prof. Goldman's look up to. Then any prudent buyer would buy the Gita Press book.

  

But there is a weird tendency among many Indian buyers of books which is part of their tendency in buying other goods : imported alternatives for local products are preferred in spite of the local alternative being not inferior sometimes even superior to the imported alternative and extremely low priced compared to the imported alternative.

  

It is something like a person sitting just in a place which can easily access a pure water stream buying the water packedinside a bottle from the same stream by a business company.

  

---------------------------------------------------

  

Another important issue is

  

Admiring Ramayana for its poetry is found in Prof. Sheldon Pollock too. But he made many negative remarks about the book like " the book is an othering one" and about the language used in the book , Sanskrit , he calls toxic. That proves that admiring the book for its poetic beauty need not necessarily mean a cultural sensitivity towards its life among the people where it actually continues to live.

  

At(<https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/im-a-target-because-im-an-outsider-sanskrit-scholar-sheldon-pollock-5191995/>) cited recently by Dr Sivasenani garu, Prof. Sheldon Pollock had to confess, saying,

> >

> > 

But it may be noted that he says, "I don't think I would have written anything different. "

  

In the case of Prof. Goldman, he seems to have a greater cultural sensitivity than Prof. Pollock while both of them express equal appreciation for the poetic beauty of the kaavya. Sri Rajiv Malhotra looks at Prof. Pollock's expression of appreciation of poetic beauty of the kaavya as a ploy to trap people into his misinterpretations of the book for a political purpose.

  

-----------------------

  

One of the justifications for highlighting translation errors could be to remove the unnecessary and imprudent fascination for imported alternatives to the local great but more affordable products
