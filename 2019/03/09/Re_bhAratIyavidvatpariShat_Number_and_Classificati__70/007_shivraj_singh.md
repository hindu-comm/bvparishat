Our history can be useful in many contexts. In the 16th century Maharana Pratap of Chittor was fighting a lone battle against Akbar. Many rajput kings had become vassals of Akbar after having given their daughters to him. Thus Pratap had zero support from fellow Hindu kings of Rajasthan.  
  
Akbar sent many expeditions against Pratap but couldn't defeat or capture him. Once Abdur Rahim Khankhana was sent by Akbar against Pratap. Udaipur region has many hills nearby and ravines too. Amar Singh, Pratap's son, attacked Khankhana and dispersed a section of his army. Khankhana's wife and other ladies of his household were captured along with soldiers.  
  
Amar singh jubilantly came to meet his father. Pratap severely admonished Amar Singh that capturing even the enemies' womenfolk was adharm. Pratap's wives and their help took care of Khankhana's family that night and the next morning all of them were returned to Khankhana's camp unharmed. Khankhana was so touched he packed his bags and left Rajasthan and never ever took arms against Pratap. Being a great poet he eulogised Pratap in his poetry.  
  
This behaviour of Pratap was despite knowing fully well that the jauhar pratha in rajasthan started because of mistreatment of Hindu women at the hands of invading armies.  
  
जो दृढ राखै धर्म ने, तिहीं राखै करतार !  
  
Dharm here does not mean religion but the right path.  
There are many many such examples from our history.  
  
So having moral high ground should always remain our goal.  
  
Shivraj
