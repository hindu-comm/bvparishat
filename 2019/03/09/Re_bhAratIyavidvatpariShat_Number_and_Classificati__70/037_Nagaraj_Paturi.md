The minimum requirements include first and foremost a sound knowledge of Sanskrit grammar and word formation

  

Yes, that's right.  

  

That includes and implies the knowledge that feminine stem is not the term suited in the context but the word genitive form with feminine ending is the apt word here.

  

It is possible that in some cases, the genitive form with feminine ending may appear to be the same as the feminine stem.

  

When two forms for the genitive form with feminine ending are possible for the same word, and one of the forms has potential to cause ambiguity, the other form which does not lead to such ambiguity is chosen.
