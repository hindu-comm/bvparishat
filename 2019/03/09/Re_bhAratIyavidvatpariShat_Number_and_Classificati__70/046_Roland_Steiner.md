Dear Mr. Misra,  

  
\> The feminine ई in ownership is a popular use in old oDiA literature.  
  

Thank you for this hint. In Sanskrit rāmī, if related to ownership,  
would be the nominative singular masculine to the nominal stem rāmin  
(I do not know whether it is actually used in Sanskrit literature as a  
separate word; as a final member of a compound it is found in  
kṣaṇarāmin "a pigeon" \[for the literal meaning, see Monier-Williams  
s.v. kṣaṇa-rāmin\]).  
  
You will realize that neither its gender nor its meaning is suitable here.  
  
Regards,  
Roland Steiner
