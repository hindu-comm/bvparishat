The most important argument in connection with the phrase रामी च रामश्च रामौ: is -  

"तस्येदम् is for संबन्धसामान्य ( any relation ) -- whereas अपत्यम् etc are विशेषसंबन्ध"  
  

"sitA is rAmA"  
"Only sitA is rAmI"  
  
  
  
re Tulasidasa:  
The word translation itself implies "a movement into a separate spacetime". That Tulasidasa could do so into Kaliyuga is real credit.
