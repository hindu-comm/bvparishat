The general topic of this thread, errors in (or accuracy of) translations of Sanskrit texts, has always been of much interest to me. For more than forty years I have been collecting Sanskrit texts and their English translations, and quite often I have compared portions of the translations with their Sanskrit originals. The specific topic of this thread, errors in (or accuracy of) Goldman’s translation of the Rāmāyaṇa, is of course included in this interest of mine. So when Sri Nityananda Misra started a different thread on this topic, referring to videos of him on it, I read it and watched them with interest. Nityananda-ji knows that I have great respect for him, from previous personal correspondence, and no difference of opinion between us will change this.



In his post to this thread, Nityananda-ji noted with obvious disagreement that Goldman’s translation was acclaimed as the “first reliably accurate English translation of the *Rāmāyaṇa*.” It was not the publisher who gave this acclaim, nor was it from an academic review; and Nityananda-ji graciously refrained from naming the source. It was I who made this statement, in a post to the Indology list a few years ago. The whole statement, addressed to Robert Goldman, is: “The team from the Oriental Institute, Vadodara (Baroda), working from 1951 to 1975, gave the world the first critical edition of the Sanskrit *Rāmāyaṇa*. Your team gave the world the first reliably accurate English translation of the *Rāmāyaṇa*.” As may be seen, the statement about the translation is in juxtaposition with a statement about the critical edition. So there is at least the suggestion that the first reliably accurate English translation was in part a result of being based on the first critical edition of the Rāmāyaṇa. Nonetheless, even leaving aside the critical edition, I do not regard the translation made by Goldman, et al., as inferior to the Gita Press English translation in accuracy.



Critical reviews of translations of Sanskrit texts, meaning reviews that compare the translation with the Sanskrit text and evaluate the accuracy of the translation, have always been of much help to me. They are not common. The most well-known writer of critical reviews of translations of Sanskrit texts was the late J. W. de Jong, long-time editor of the Indo-Iranian Journal. A good example of one of his critical reviews is that of An Evaluation of the Vedāntic Critique of Buddhism, by Gregory J. Darling, attached. In this review, de Jong points out elementary errors made by Darling in his translations of Sanskrit phrases and sentences. We are fortunate to have a review made by de Jong of the first two volumes of the Rāmāyaṇa translation made by Robert Goldman and Sheldon Pollock, respectively (attached). In his usual manner, de Jong provides a list of translation errors that he noticed while comparing the two translations with the Sanskrit text. They are not many.



In the opening post of this thread, Sri Shivraj Singh asked if there is any methodology to classify translation errors, and tentatively proposed one utilizing three types of error:



typos/spelling errors could be the most trivial category: Type 0 Error  
  
wrong translation of a word which doesn't impact the overall meaning of the shloka: Type 1 Error  
  
wrong translation of a word(s) which alters the meaning of the shloka: Type 2 Error.



To these three I would add a fourth, the wrong construal of Sanskrit phrases and sentences, although this may be in part what Shivraj-ji meant by the third one, from the example given by him. This construal-type of error is much more serious than wrong translation of an individual word, since it changes the meaning of the whole sentence.



This last type of error is very rare in carefully made translations such as that of the Rāmāyaṇa made by Robert Goldman. If the Gita Press translation was critically analyzed, a few of these could no doubt be found in it, too; or for that matter, in any translation, no matter how carefully made. When a large number of translations of Sanskrit texts of various genres have been compared, such as was done by de Jong over the years, or even by myself on a much more limited basis, the conclusion reached is that Goldman’s translation of the Rāmāyaṇa ranks high in terms of accuracy.
