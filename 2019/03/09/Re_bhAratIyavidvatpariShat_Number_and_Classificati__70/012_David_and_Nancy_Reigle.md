Dear Dr. Misra,

  

First I should note that I am not a PhD., so not Dr. Reigle.

  

I hope you will not mind if I answer your query in the words of Robert Goldman. He states better than I could what he and his team tried to accomplish with their translation, and how it differs from previous translations of the Ramayana. These things are what make it, in my estimation, not inferior to the Gita Press English translation in accuracy. From vol. 1, p. 96:  

  

"Whatever their literary merit, and this varies radically, all of the translations so far made have been based upon a single version or recension of the text, either the vulgate or the Bengal version, and their authors have not been in a position to judge accurately the vital text-critical problems that the epic presents. None of them, moreover, has attempted to put before its audience the results of a close and critical reading of the extensive commentarial literature that has grown up around the poem. As a result, readers of previous translations have had to accept without criticism the translators' judgments on often very difficult questions of interpretation without even knowing where the problems are to be found, much less the issues raised by attempts to solve them."

  

Thus, in the first five volumes, the notes take up roughly the same number of pages as the translation, although in smaller print. By the time of vol. 6, the translation is about 375 pages and the notes are about 1050 pages. In vol. 7, the translation is about 220 pages and the notes are about 840 pages. So in most cases, especially in the last two volumes, questions of why a particular verse was translated in a particular way are dealt with in the notes, and alternatives may be seen there.

  

Best regards,
