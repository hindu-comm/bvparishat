Dharmaśāstra-s recognize twelve kinds of sons: *aurasa* (born from one’s own seed), *kṣetraja* (born of one’s wife by someone duly authorized), *datrima* (given away \[by parents in distress\] or adopted), *kṛtrima* (appointed), *gūḍha* (secretly born), *apaviddha* (abandoned), *kānīna* (born to a maiden), *sahoḍha* (received with the bride), *krītaka* (purchased), *paunarbhava* (born to a remarried woman), *svayaṃdatta* (self-offered), and *niṣāda* (outcaste) or *pāraśava* (living corpse). See Ganganath Jha (1999), Manusmṛti, With the ‘Manubhāṣya’ of Medhātithi: Text, Translation and Notes (Volume 7, English Translation, Part V: Discourses IX, X, XI & XII), Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 81-208-1155-0, pp. 150–157.

  

A *datrima* son is entitled to inheritance if I recall correctly.
