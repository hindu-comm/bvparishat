The point seems to be this.

What is done repetitively leads apparently to tautology.  

  

It is only when there are special needs that repetition is desirable.

The following verse lists 8 occasions where *punarukti* is no demerit:

*tadarthAtis'aye s'aighrye*

* dainye kope'vadhAraNe \|  
*

*vis"Ade vismaye hars"e*

* punaruktam na dus"yati \|\|*

  

(It is of course an altogether different matter in affairs of love:

*viramya punAramyate priyo jano nAsti punaruktam* !).

  

Grammatical examples illustrative of the warrantedness of repetitions as in *sarpa sarpa! yAhi yAhi!* etc.

need not detain us here (*vIpsA/abhyAsa/AmreDita* etc. in their own contexts).  

  

In poetics, there is no *dos"a* that cannot also be turned into a *guNa*.

  

But in reality, what is done repetitively can become a *mindless task*, leading but to **boredom**.

The essential import of *jAmitA* thus is (repetition, hence) boredom.

  

But most dictionaries miss this sense of boredom for the word *jAmitA*.

In rites and incantations, *kratu*-s and *mantra*-s,  

commentators take pains to show that there is no unwarranted repetition.

(Most commentaries, for example on *vis"Nu-sahasra-nAman (also* considered a *stotra-mahAmantra)*,  

strive to show that there is no *paunaruktya*, especially *arthataH)*.

Vedic texts cited above also emphasised this.
