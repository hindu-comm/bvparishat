I can make a wild semantic guess.

*yama(la)*=twin.

*yamau*= twins.

  

*ya* and *ja* are often replaceable even in the Vedic.

*jamau* (masculine), and *jAmI* (feminine) can also refer to twins.

*tayor bhAvaH = jAmitA =* sameness *=* what leads to boredom*.*

*  
*

This is only a wild guess.*  
*

Better derivations are welcome.
