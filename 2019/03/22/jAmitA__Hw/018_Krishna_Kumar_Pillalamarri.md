Dear All,

  

To my limited sense, this explanation by Dr. Kannan seems to be the best. I would use the English term "ennui" (pronounced annwee) to explain जामिता if need be. The despair about repetition seems better described by that word. People may correct me, ofcourse.

  

Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
