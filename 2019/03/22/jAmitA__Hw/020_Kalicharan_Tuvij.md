Namaste,  
  
Just another take on the conclusions arrived at by scholars:  
  
Hindi जम = to get stuck  
य denotes entry, यम = always in the state of entry (but never quite going through)  
  
यामी = mirror/equal (of यम)  
= First among all womanfolk (hence जामिता being representative of them), "always at the doors".  
Now, getting stuck in our evolution is the Hindu equivalent of नरक.  
And mantra-s, though paradoxically repetitive in nature, are in essence the very antidote of "getting stuck".
