My guesses, for what they are worth:

  

1\. *jAmi* as *bandhu* is understandable.

  

From *jAmi* as "sister", to *jAmi* as "*kula-strI*, to *jAmI* as "daughter/wife etc".,  

\- thus standing for womenfolk in general - are all cases of extension of meaning.

  

Bearing kinship with *yama*, twin, (cf. *geminus* L - note the *j* sound here too as in Gemini),  

the further extension of sense as standing for all kin (not just womenfolk or just twin,  

and akin to what we say as " a *kin*dred soul") is also a possible similar extension.

  

2\. *yAtR* is one who takes revenge, hence an enemy.

*yAtu* (Cf. Hindi *jAdU*) is black magic.  

Cf. *yAtu* as *raks"as* as in  

*"yAtudhAnaH puNyajanao nairRto yAtu-raks"asI"  
*

in ***amara-kos"a**) .*

Also, Cf. *yAtanA*, pain  

(Cf. the typical usage in Kannada: *yama-yAtane*.  

In Sanskrit itself we have *yAmyo yatanAH* as in *mukunda-mAlA*).

Cf. *yAtu naH padavI sais"A yAtunas' cAsya laks"maNa!*

*yAtukAmaM tayaivedaM yAtu kAmaM na hanyatAm \|\|*

\- from ***campU-rAmAyaNa*** 3.4).

*yAtya* as a resident of hell.

All these from *yata nikAropaskArayoH*.

The first sense has all the negative force.  

  

3\. Also Cf. *yAtavya*, an enemy to be attacked (though from root *yA*)

  

4\. Now, on the interchangeability of the *ya* and *ja* sounds:

*yos"A= jos"A,*

*yos"it=jos"it,*

*yAmi=jAmi,* and

*yAmI=jAmI*

Cf. *yAma=jAva* in Kannada*.*

One can multiply instances of *JamunA, jogI* etc*.  
*

*  
*

5\. *yAmika*=police (the one who strikes)

  

6\. Against all this background, ***jAmi*** (and *ajAmi*) as foe/**adversary**/combatant (and nonfoe) also is understandable.

Hence Sayana giving the two interpretations is justifiable, I suppose.

  

(7. I have not tried to discuss issues of homonymy and polysemy here.).
