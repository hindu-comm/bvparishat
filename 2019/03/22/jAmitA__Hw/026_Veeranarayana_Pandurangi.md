Vedic index gives the following definitions of Jami.

Mostly blood relationship which leads to similarity, that is repition.

  

जामि

  

Jāmi, a word which appears originally to have meant ‘related in blood,’ is not rarely used as an epithet of ‘sister’ (svasṛ), and sometimes even denotes ‘sister’ itself, the emphasis being on the blood-relationship.1 So it appears in a passage of the Atharvaveda,2 where ‘brotherless sisters’ (abhrātara iva jāmayaḥ) are referred to. The word is similarly used in the dispute occurring in the aitareya brāhmaṇa3 as to the precedence of rākā, or of the wives of the gods, in a certain rite. One party is there described as holding that the sister should be preferred (jāmyai vai pūrva-peyam)--apparently at a ceremonial family meal--to the wife, presumably as being of one blood with the husband, while the wife is not (being anyodaryā, ‘of another womb’).4 In the neuter5 the word means ‘relationship,’ like jāmi-tva, which also occurs in the Rigveda.6
