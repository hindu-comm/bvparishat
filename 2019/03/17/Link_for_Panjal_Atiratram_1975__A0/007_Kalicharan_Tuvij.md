Good to see the use of "ifs" and "buts" in the reply.

  

If "a person ate food", then the expectation is: "the person's hunger was satiated" and not: "the hunger remained since the food was insufficient" because you don't know if that was true.

So the expectation (based on given fact) is: horse dispersed from Indian subcontinent soon it joined with Asia (and the Himalayas born).

 The next expectation is: arya-s made use of local variants of horse (the so called "not true horse").

There is - as far as I know - no relation between guru (jupiter) and Indra. Or between zeus and dyaus.

Or did I miss reading Harry Potter while growing up?

  

  

There is a tons-of-similarity between the vocabs of India and Pakistan. The level is though secular, not religious. India, however, possess both secular and religious levels of the common words, and that's why the alien-from-mars knows for sure that India is the trunk and Pakistan is the branch.
