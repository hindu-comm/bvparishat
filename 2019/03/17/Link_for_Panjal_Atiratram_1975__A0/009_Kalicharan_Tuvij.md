Except I've read crackpot theories well enough.

If you mean the typo, rereadit withthe correction:

"There is no relation - as far as I know -between zeus and dyo, or between vretreghna and Indra."

  

Now, to make it dumb enough:why isvretreghna not related to Indra? Because Indra the word (the drinker of Indu)has religious layer connotations thatvretreghna hasn't (because vretreghna didn't kill a demon named vretra in his culture). So Indra is the trunk and vretreghna is the branch. Reversing this hierarchy amounts to cultural theft. Assisting in that amounts to a little more.
