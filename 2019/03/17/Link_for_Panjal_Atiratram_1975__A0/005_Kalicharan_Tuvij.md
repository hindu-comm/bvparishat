This is a news to me. I thought all odd-toed ungulates (e.g. horse) originated in Indian subcontinent. [goo.gl/UdE9xp](http://goo.gl/UdE9xp)  
Also religious ideas have to be deeply conservative in order to be transmitted from one culture to another. So vena-venus comparison (which is of religious import) doesn't hold at this level.
