Just because a pig-sized (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambaytherium>) animal close to the ancestor of horses and rhinos might have originated in India, it does not follow that the horse (it's descendent) originated in India. Even if it did, it hardly follows that the horse thrived in India anywhere as well as it did in the steppes. Even if it did, the relative climate and circumstances of Indian plate ( <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Plate> ) 50+million years ago when it was an island and himAlayas had not arisen can hardly be compared to its "recent" circumstances.

Wrong - religious transmissions often happens with significant mutations - Perkun of the Slavs corresponding to Parjanya, jupiter / zeus corresponding to dyaus or vretreghna corresponding one aspect of Indra are examples in this regard. or even more simply, consider rules of religious practice.
