नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

I was supervising the अतिरात्रम् (2012 at Bhasdracalam, Telamgana state ) - the measurements of cottages, fetching त्रेताग्नि from Trissur , Kerala , without कर्मलोप or any other problem and was giving lectures in Telugu, English and Hindi at the venue for 12 days on different topics (I reported the details here during Oct - Dec 2012 , roughly ).

Then it so happened that I had a glance at the three volume work of Sri Fritts Staal - अग्नि ।

He was helped by Profs - R N Dandekar , V Raghavan , E R Sreekrishna Sarma and others - members of an International Committee.

Preface -- " In translating the texts I received a great deal of assistance . My first thanks go to Prof wendy Doniger O'flaherty , who helped me with translations from Rgveda . **Neither of us in a specialist in Indo-European , one requirement for the traditional Vedic philologist .Both of us feel, however (as she says in the Introduction to her Anthology from the Rgveda:Penguin Classic,1981) that " there is so much in the Rgveda to interest and excite non-Vedists, it seems a shame to let it go on being the treasure of a tiny, exclusive group,, hidden as it is behibd the thorny wll of an ancient and cryptic language"**

  

In the beginning of the General Introduction he says --

**"More than three thousand years ago** , **nomads crossed the mountain ranges that separate Central Asia from Iran and the Indian subcontinet. Leaving behind the dry steppes of their ancestral home , they entered the fertile plains of the upper Indus and came in contact with remnants of an earlier civilization . These nomads imported the rudiments of their social their social and religious system along with their Indo-European language, which developed into Vedic, and later into Sanskrit."**

**  
**

As is obvious , these people are dare enough to call the आर्य-s of this पुण्यभूमि as nomads - even without , let alone पदवाक्यप्रमाणशास्त्र-s , fundamental knowledge of the दैवभाषा prepared to translate / comment on ऋग्वेद etc .

Do not teach this विद्या to everybody - says वेद -- अनसूयकाय etc.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
