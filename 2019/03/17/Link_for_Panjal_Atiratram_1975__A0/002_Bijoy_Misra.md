Dear Sundareswaranji,  

I had seen the footage with late Prof Stahl earlier. The description is added.

"Nomadic people entering India and producing the Vedas" as a  

beginning statement is controversial and has little to do with the ritual!

I don't know who is the new producer. Hopefully they can revise to

make it more accountable..  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
