Very interesting discussions on translation. Let me throw in my two cents. But I am no vidvān. Just a pāmara, introducing his pāmara vāṇi in this vidvat sadas.

Someone once asked me if I could translate this beautiful Tamil song into English:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChXIbg_2Zk>

என்ன தவம் செய்தனை யசோதா  
எங்கும் நிறை பரப்ரஹ்மம் அம்மா என்றழைக்க?

*Eṉṉa tavam ceytaṉai, Yaśōdā,*

*Eṅkum niṟai para brahmam ammā eṉṟaẓaikka*

What tapas (penance) did you do, O Yaśōdā, for the all-pervading Para Brahmam to call you “Amma” (mother)?

Unfortunately, I had to decline. My knowledge of Tamil is too elementary to translate these lofty lines by Pāpanāśam Śivaṉ. My English is also tathaiva.

My thoughts went into another direction as I noticed that the poet addresses Yaśōdā in singular second person sans respect.

In Malayalam and Tamil, nī (നീ நீ) is “you” singular without respect, equivalent to tū (तू) of Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and other north Indian languages. Interestingly ni means you in Chinese – Mandarin – also, as in the greeting nĭ hăo (你 好), “you good?”. But unless you say this with all the ārōhaṇa and avarōhaṇa, and perhaps some svarita, udātta and anudātta thrown in, the Chinese will not realize that you are greeting them saying nĭ hăo. 😊 But that is another topic for another day when I will put together a Mandaro-Malayalam Siddhāntam just as some people have put together Sumero-Tamil hypothesis.

Back to Malayalam/Tamil nī. When my son was a little boy he heard his Tamil neighbor calling his mother nī. He thought his friend was a having a bitter quarrel with his mother. He asked me why his friend was quarrelling with his mother. I had to tell my son that his friend was not quarreling with his mother. In Tamil, unlike Malayalam, it is quite natural to refer to one’s mother by the second person singular nī. In Malayalam, it would be treated as utter disrespect to the mother. I remembered that in Hindi too, it is not unusual to call one’s mother tū. Long, long ago when as a young man I worked in Gujarat, I noticed that my landlord’s son would often call his mother tū but the middle aged landlord would never call his own aging mother tū. Would always call her using the respectful tame (તમે). But then, the son called his mother “mummy” while the dad called his mother bā (બા / बा). There was a paradigm shift there. Back again to nī. The point is, if you literally translate any passage into Malayalam from Tamil, Hindi, or other languages in which the mother is referred to in the second person singular, it will not jibe with the Malayali readers. So the translator has to know this little cultural difference before attempting the translation. He or she will have to let go the nī and rephrase the sentences without it. Else the Malayali reader will not get the right meaning.

It is not yet two cents. Maybe just one cent. Another day and time for the full two cents.
