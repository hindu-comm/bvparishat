Thanks, Mr. Warrier, for your interesting and educative notings above.

In Kannada, spoken in villages of South Karnataka an old man or woman is often referred to in neuter gender! Parents and grandparents can also be referred to in neutergender. One can hear "appahogaite", "avvabandaite" etc. Sometimes Hindi-speaking people address even a child as "aap". I was told that it was meant to teach the child respectful speaking.

Regards,

Murthy
