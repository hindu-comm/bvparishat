Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

I don't have your original full text in front of me, but I assume that the cloud at the end of a kalpa is the one that is going to produce a pralaya, and hence it is so frightening. This may refer to the size and the dark color of the cloud. The Rākṣasīs guarding Sītā are described poetically as being so frightening. That is my best guess from the expression you have cited. With best wishes,
