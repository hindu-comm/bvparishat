Dear Prof. Korada,

I am grateful for the reference. I have seen such description in the Bhagavatam.

My question is if there is a reference work that creates the cosmological speculation.

I think it could be in Astrology literature. I am looking for the texts and the reference logic  

behind the description. It might also talk about the speculative physical phenomena,

so is my thought.

Best regards,

BM
