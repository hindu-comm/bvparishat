The Nirnayasagar edition has the same reading. The whole passage runs as

तत्र प्रविशतश्चापि कल्पान्तघनसप्रभा।। 48।।

अट्टहासं विमुञ्चन्ती नारी काप्युत्थिता पुरः।

जिघांसन्तीं ततस्तां तु ज्वलदग्निशिरोरुहाम्। ।49।।

सव्यमुष्टिप्रहारेण पराजित्य सुभैरवाम्।

प्रदोषकाले प्रविशं भीतयाहं तयोदितः।। 50।। (58th canto)

  

लङ्कापुरीराक्षसी is being described by Hanuman. She is further described as ज्वलदग्निशिरोरुहा and सुभैरवा. Can the phrase कल्पान्तघनसप्रभा be explained as कल्पान्तघनवत् सप्रभा सतटित् सभीषणतटित् ? This may go along with the phrase ज्वलदग्निशिरोरुहा and सुभैरवा?

As to the opinion

Since these terms are coming so frequently, I think there could be some astronomical speculations.

I don't know how frequent is the use in Mahabharata. I don't recall to have seen in SrimadBhagavatam.

The whole activity with widening sun, blazing fire and dense dark clouds puzzles me if purely poetic!

put forward by Prof. Bijoyji, I think, we have to be very careful and make it double sure that there are no such poetic descriptions of blazing fire and dense dark clouds in the Mahabharata, and the Purana-s, especially Srimadbhagavata.

We may remember the verses such as this one from the चम्पूरामायण -

सन्तापघ्नं ....... त्रिदशपरिषत् कालमेघं ददर्श।।
