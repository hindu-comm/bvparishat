Dear Scholars

References to Yuga, Kalpa, Pralaya, and long time scales of the order of Manvantara are plenty in the PuraNas. Manu's First Flood (Ogha) of the S'atapatha BrAhmaNa is recounted in the MB as *ItihAsam PurAtanam*. All flood legends in ancient Sanskrit are brought together by Suryakanta available at. These stories are obviously memories transmitted by the first survivors and amplified and modulated by their successors.

In a way all the Yugakshaya, Kalpaanta concepts are speculations about creation, existence of humans on earth as reaction to a great natural disaster affecting India in some ancient period (Probably the end of the Bronze Age). Usually it is postulated that the Flood is preceded by multiple Suns sucking away the water from Earth as a reaction to which, Brahman sends elephantine dark clouds to pour torrents of water.....
One can find the sum of the periods of all the 14 Manvantaras to estimate the beginning of Creation as per our ancients. The length of the ParArdha turns out to be of the order of 4 Billion years a fact that is acknowledged by Carl Sagan. Sun descended on Earth in the Svarocisha Manvantara as per Skanda PuraNa-Prabhasa Khanda. This would be \~1665 million years BP. More details with Text etc available at:
