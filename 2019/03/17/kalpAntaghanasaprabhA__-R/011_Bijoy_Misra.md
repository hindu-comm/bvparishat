Dear Prof. Iyengar,

Floods through the ice age and ice melting can be a legend. What i don't get is what speculation

can be for the fire and destruction, possibly massive volcanoes earthquakes etc.

I will study the references you have given. What interests me is that present astronomy projects

that the demise of the planetary system would happen by the sun expanding out in some time scale.

(this is an extension of late S. Chandrasekhar's theory).  

Best regards,

BM
