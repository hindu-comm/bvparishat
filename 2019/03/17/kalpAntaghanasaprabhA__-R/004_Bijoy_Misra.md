Madhavji,

Since these terms are coming so frequently, I think there could be some astronomical speculations.

I don't know how frequent is the use in Mahabharata. I don't recall to have seen in SrimadBhagavatam.

The whole activity with widening sun, blazing fire and dense dark clouds puzzles me if purely poetic!
