Dear Prof. Sundareswaran,

Please pardon my ignorance on astrological literature.  

Two phrases are seen युगान्त and कल्पान्त.

I have seen some description of युग and कल्प from the counting point of view.

The question is how the astrological calculations would define a युग or a कल्प.

Then we have to correlate that with the local planetary system.

I realize that huge amount of resources are being dedicated to apply astrology,

so my interest is to check any astronomy behind the "prediction".

In Valmiki's case, the sun in widening in युगान्त (Hanuman can assume a bigger size).

कल्पान्त is dark and dangerous (describing Lanka creatures terrorizing Sita).

In books I see a कल्प is much larger time scale than a युग.

How does one determine the time scales?

Best regards,

BM
