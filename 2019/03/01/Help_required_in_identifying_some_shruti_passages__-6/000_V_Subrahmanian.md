Namaste

  

In the commentary for the HanumannaTaka verse 'yam shaivaaH....', several shruti passages have been cited. Of these, except for the ones in respect of Vedantins, all the other passages are eluding my search.
I request scholars to kindly help identifying the same as to their source, veda, shaakhaa, upanishad, etc. The image of the commentary is attached with the passages in question underlined.

  

One possibility is that the commentator has cited the passages not verbatim but only stated their meaning, (not shabdatah but arthatah) but this is a remote possibility.

  

Thanks and regards
