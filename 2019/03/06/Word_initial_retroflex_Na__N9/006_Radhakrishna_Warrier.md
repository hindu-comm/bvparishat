So, it appears that word-initial /n/ in most words changed to /ṇ/ in Ardhamāgadhi Prakrit.

Could this use of word-initial /ṇ/ be an attempt to transcribe a word initial alveolar /ṉ/?

It is my experience that in modern Indian languages other than Malayalam, the word-initial dental /n/ is pronounced as alveolar /ṉ/.
Sanskrit namaḥ is pronounced as ṉamaḥ. In languages other than Malayalam, I think /n/ and /ṉ/ are allophones and speakers don’t realize the difference; they pronounce /n/ as alveolar /ṉ/ in all positions except when it forms the first part of a conjunct letter -- for example, the word nandan is pronounced as ṉandaṉ. The distinction between dental /n/ and alveolar /ṉ/ is maintained in written Tamil as ந and ன but this distinction has been lost in spoken Tamil. For example, the Tamil word for “I” is nāṉ (நான்) but this word is invariably pronounced as ṉāṉ (னான்).
