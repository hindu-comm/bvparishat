Yes, in Prakrits words can begin with ṇ. Sanskrit *nirgrantha* becomes *ṇigaṇṭha*, Sanskrit *jñāna* becomes *ṇāṇa*, and Sanskrit *namati* becomes *ṇamai*. This is very common in Ardhamāgadhi Prakrit, the language of the Jain canonical texts. The line you quote \[णमोअरिहंताणं-णमोसिद्धाणं-णमोआइरियाणं-णमोउवज्झायाणं-णमोलोएसव्वसाहूणं\] is from Jain texts.
