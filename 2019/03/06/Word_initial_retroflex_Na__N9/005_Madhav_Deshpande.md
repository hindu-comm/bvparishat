Dear Warrier Ji,

  

  I think this is a distinct possibility that analveolar /ṉ/ gets represented as an alternation between n/ṇ, though we don't have any Śikṣā texts describing the pronunciation of Prakrits. Some confusion beween n/ṇ even with respect to the pronunciation of the R̥gveda in the region of Magadha is manifest in the discussions in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka where there is a debate about whether the Saṃhitā is aṇakāra and aṣakāra, or saṇakāra and saṣakāra. Here, the Magadhavāsī Hrasva Māṇḍūkeya has the saṇakāra and saṣakāra Saṃhitā, while some others did not. Here, Śākalya follows the tradition of Māṇḍūkeya. The aṇakāra and aṣakāra Saṃhitā, mentioned in this debate, has not been transmitted to us. But its existence is hinted at. Not only the initial n, but even medial n can appear as ṇ in some ancient dialects from this region. For example, the Māgadhī Prakrit spoken by the character of Śakāra in the Mr̥cchakaṭika has वसन्तशेणा for the Sanskrit वसन्तसेना. Such a thing can happen in Ardhamāgadhī (jñāna \> ṇāṇa) and Pāli (jñāna \> ñāṇa).
