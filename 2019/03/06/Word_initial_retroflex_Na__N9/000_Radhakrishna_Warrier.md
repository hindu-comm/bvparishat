I believe that words beginning with the retroflex ṇ (ण) are non-existent in modern Indian languages. But decades ago, when I was working in north India, I saw words that begin with ṇ (ण), especially the word णम in a printed Jain religious text that a Jain colleague was holding. I asked him what language it was. Apparently, he didn’t know, but said it was Sanskrit. But the words in the text didn’t look like Sanskrit. Also, I was pretty sure that णम was not a Sanskrit word. At that time, however, I did not think much about it, though it all got stored in some part of my brain. Yesterday I was surfing the web with Jainism related topics and found this mantra online:

णमो अरिहंताणं -णमो सिद्धाण -णमो आइरियाणं -णमो उवज्झायाणं -णमो लोए सव्वसाहूणं

The website says it is Prakrit. I am not sure if Prakrit words begin with retroflex ṇ. What language is this? Is this an Apabhraṃśa language? णम is obviously a cognate of Sanskrit नमः.

It is quite interesting to find word initial ṇ (ण) in the Indic language milieu. I don’t think word initial ṇ (ण) existed either at the time of Vedic Sanskrit or at the time when Pali and other Prakrits were spoken languages. Languages of the Dravidian family also do not have words beginning with retroflex ṇ. And ṇ is no longer there as a word initial sound in modern Indian languages. At what period in the evolution of Indian languages did ṇ (ण) exist as a word initial sound?
