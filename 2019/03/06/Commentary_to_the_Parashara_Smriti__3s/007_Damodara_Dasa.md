I have already purchased the Hindi one and have started reading. It is  
a very good translation probably because the translator is a mimamsaka  
and the commentary contains good doses of Mimamsa, something similar  
to the Medhatithi on Manu samhita. I am satisfied with this hindi  
translation.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
