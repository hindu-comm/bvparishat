Namaste

  

Is there any commentary to the Parashara Smriti? This page mentions:

  

<http://www.pragyata.com/mag/parashar-smriti-the-lawbook-for-kaliyuga-389>  

  

//In Parashar Smriti, the law book for Kaliyuga, we find a commentary surprisingly relatable to the issues of our day and age.//

  

but no reference to the name of the commentary/commentator, etc. is given.

  

Could anyone please clarify if any commentary to this smriti is available?

  

Thanks
