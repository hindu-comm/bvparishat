It is a concurrent thread with Sri Nityanand Misra's observation on literal translation

with Prof. Paturi's reference to earlier material.

  

Discussion on numbers has not happened, it is more complex.

Concepts like one or zero need a measurement metric which has to be researched in the literature.

Hence I am looking for enthusiastic researchers with good training in Mathematics and number theory

along with usable knowledge in Sanskrit and Prakrit. I am forming a working group here,

the first meeting is coming Friday.
