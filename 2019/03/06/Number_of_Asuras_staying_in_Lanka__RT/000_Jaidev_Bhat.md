Dear BVP Members

  

The Valmiki Ramayan has the following verse -

  

दशकोटिसहस्राणि रक्षसाम् कामरूपिणाम् \|  

मांसशोणितभक्ष्याणाम् लङ्कापुरनिवासिनाम् \|\| ६-१९-१५ \|\|

  

The translation is given at <https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/yuddha/sarga19/yuddha_19_frame.htm>

  

"In the city of Lanka, are residing ten thousand crore demons, who can assume any form at will and who consume flesh and blood as their staple food."  

  

If we see the figure, it is a staggering ten thousand crore, which is **ONE HUNDRED BILLION (100000000000)**Asuras.

  

How can this figure be justified for a city like Lanka when today, the world population is only around **8 Billion?**

**  
**

Can the scholars please shed light on this? Or point out a link where this question is answered.

  

regards,

  

Jaidev Bhat.
