Dear Bijoy,  

"We call universe as "undivided" "  

No universe is not undevided. There are many divisions. However these  
divisions are Very difficult to count.  
The Consciousness is "undivided".  
  
In the undivided consciousness of the Self the distinction of in and  
out, here and there, etc. gets merged, and space, whose essence is  
this distinction, gets negatived.
