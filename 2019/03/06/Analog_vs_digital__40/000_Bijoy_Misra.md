Dear friends,

Since many are getting involved with the numbers, I thought to draw attention

on to the fundamental nature of creation of numbers. We call universe as

"undivided", because it is. I am looking for the concepts when the measurement

might have been conceived as an activity. In case people are mathematically

inclined, you can write to me privately for further elaboration.

Thank you.
