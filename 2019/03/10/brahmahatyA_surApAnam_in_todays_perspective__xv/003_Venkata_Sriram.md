Namaste,

  

Dharma Sastra says:

  

न सुरां पेबेत्

  

Which implies it's consumption is strictly prohibited. The intoxicants in any form is prohibited.

  

Since, allopathy medicines contain these, shiSTa brAhmaNAs doesn't take allopathy medicines and go for ayurveda. Kanchi Paramacharya strictly followed this.

  

The last (5th) mahApAtaka is the sahavAsa with the one who drinks. So, even if one is a teetotaller, but accompanies the people who drink in bars / restaurants,

he is committing the mahApAtaka. For eg., attending corporate parties / get-togethers now-a-days and throwing cocktail parties by CEO and we sitting beside them :)

  

rgs,

sriram
