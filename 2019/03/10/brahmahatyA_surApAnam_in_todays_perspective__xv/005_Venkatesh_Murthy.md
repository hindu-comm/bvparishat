This is true for Brahmins only. History is showing Kshatriyas and others always had intoxicating drinks with no restrictions. Because the body of a Brahmin is for Tapas only and not worldly enjoyment he has to very carefully avoid all drinks like these. It is a sin for him only if he drinks but others can drink.
