धन्यवादाः विद्वद्वर्य कोरादाजी।  
  
I am very pleased you answered my queries. But, I'm unsure what in the Manu Smriti is an interpolation and what is written by Shri Manu himself.  
  
For, in one place, he declares Surapanam as a Mahapataka and at another place how can he say "न मद्यपाने दोषः?"  
  
About Charaka Samhita and other Ayurvedic scriptures, cab we consider them as Pranamam in terms of Vedic Parampara is concerned?  
Charak Samhita deals with the benefits and harmfulness of all Padarthas, even Beef is mentioned, it's Gunas and Avagunas. It's more like a practical book based on Bhautika Padarthas (I can be wrong here), not related to the Adhidaivika Swarupa,Gunas ajd Avagunas of the Padarthas.  
  
Because Mamsa, Madya, and all these are Tamasic, increase lust, anger etc in body, they are not to be consumed by Mumukshus or Bhaktimargis/Vaishnavas. As these negative thoughts are badhaka in bhakti.  
  
Charaka Samhita are like mathematics and sciences derived from the Vedas but less to do with the Adhidaivika forms and religious perspective mentioned in Vedas, and they do not deal with Kartavya and Akartavya/Punya-Paapa like Dharmashastras.  
  
Sir, I mean not to argue with your high intellect and vast knowledge is beyond comparision and far beyond my reach, and if you say it, it means there is some schollarly research and authority. I mean only to humbly request and ask my doubts to you.  
  
I am still a little scared, for I do not want to be a Sinner, and that too not an ordinary sinner, a Mahapataki. the question is about being Bahirmukha from the Vedic Sanatana Path. I'm not worried of my Paraloka Gati, but I don't want to be Vedadrohi, Vedankndaka. At least I try my least to not commit these 5 sins,for we sin alot as humans, but at the least I prevent myself from the following 5.  
  
  
Bhooyo Bhooyo Dhanyavadah  
Rishi.
