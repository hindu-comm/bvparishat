Namaste Venkatji.

Thank you very much for helping me out Sir.  
Even though I didn't understand in entirety the recipes, but i got the context.

So in that case, Sura doesn't refer to the chemical substance ethyl alcohol/ethanol which is present in beer, grape wine and other drinks like vodka and (alcohol chemical) can be consumed in medicines? It wont be a sin then?

And if some beer isn't made through the said recipes,the substance is fit for drinking and is no sin. Is this what the shlok implies?

I don't know. I feel it strictly prohibits usage of liquor.and related products that are intoxicating, but I'm not sure, that's just what I feel.
