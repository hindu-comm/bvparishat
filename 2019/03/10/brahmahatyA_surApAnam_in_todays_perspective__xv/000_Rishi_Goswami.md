Haraye Namah.

Namaste to all schollars

My question is majorly related to the word Surapanam, where it is immediately after the highest level of sin, Brahmahatya.

So, it is equivalent or just next to the sin of killing a Brahman/Cow. (Brahma goes for cow as well, for Brahma means Vedas/Yajnas and for Yajna we need both a Hota and Cow for Havi. Brahmarpanam Brahmahavih...)

So my question is, like most Vaishnavas quit coffee and tea, don't have any type of alcohol, what should be taken as Surapanam in consideration today?

Is it alcohol, any intoxicated item or daru in general? We have so many items like Beer Shampoos, Medicines (like cough syrups), perfumes that contain alcohol,and caffeine to be so common nowadays.  
If Surapanam is any intoxicated item, we should ideally be leaving all of these items. Personally, i being a vaishnava have always stayed away from tea and coffee, any type of alcoholic medicines and perfumes as well.

I'm not sure what this word means, so I've heard many Hindus drinking Bhaang in Holi, in fact even Dauji (Balram) and Shiv have been eating Bhaang in folklore (not sure if this is approved Puranically).

So what is alcohol exactly? I mean chemically, or what is the substance by which daru/sura is made? So how should we assign the rules, taking in consideration the scenario today?

This time I'm asking this for personal following, not just for curiousity or schollarly opinion, because I really want to try and follow Dharma Yathashakti. And being a Hindu, at peast I should make sure I don't commit any if these five sins AT ALL, for these restrictions apply to each and every Vedic Sampradaya.  
So please do help and provide your take.

Natosmi.  
Rishi.
