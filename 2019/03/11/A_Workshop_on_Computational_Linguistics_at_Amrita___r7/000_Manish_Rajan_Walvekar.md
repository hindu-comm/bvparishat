Dear all,

Namaste!

Computational Linguistics is a blend of linguistics and technology. It is a multi-disciplinary field concerned with statistical, rule-based and grammatical modelling of natural languages from a computational perspective. This branch of linguistics applies computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of language and speech. A nascent and a highly potential area of research, it deals with the six basic levels of linguistics namely - Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics and Pragmatics. A specialized study of the field is important -nay- advantageous to delve into a wide array of subjects such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Sciences etc.

This workshop focuses not only on the computational aspect but also on the linguistic aspect of the subject.

Amrita Darshanam, ICSS, Bengaluru campus is organizing a workshop on the aforementioned subject, not only focusing on the technological part but also on the language part.
