Dear Members,

  

Namaste \_/\\\_

  

We are constructing a temple in a village in Gujarat. The temple is in its final construction phase. We are looking for guidance on how to arrange the deities. The primary arrangement would be in the 'C' shape.

  

We will be having Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha, Khodiyar Maa, Gayatri Maa, Saraswati Maa

  

Please guide on the arrangement, and any other suggestions regarding the color / direction or vastu if possible.

  

This temple is through local efforts hence any professional guidance is appreciated.

  

Thank you

  

Regards

Krunal
