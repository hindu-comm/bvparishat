Hello Askok,

This comes as no surprise to me at all. I have been mentioning about the outstanding work you have been doing in so many areas of Sanskrit to each and everyone I meet and at long last recognition which is long overdue has finally come through. Our happiness knows no bounds and in honouring you we (my husband and I) experience the greatest delight. Our heartiest congratulations to you and to Vidyut in particular who has been a pillar of support in all your endeavours.

Om

rukmani and rajamani
