Congratulations to Prof Aklujkar. Just now I heard this news in the Doordarshan Sanskrit bulletin of March 8th morning. They also transmitted a quite pleasing congratulatory speech by Hon Minister Mrs Sushma Swaraj. It was wonderful to hear about the World Sanskrit Award in Sanskrit itself.

  

Best wishes again to Prof Aklujkar.
