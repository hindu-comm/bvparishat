Humble pranams and heartycongratulations to Prof. Ashok Aklujkar ji. He deserves many more such awards for his steadfastness in traditional Sastra teaching&research by becoming a bridge between the East and the West.

  

BVP recalls, it is barely two months since it had conferred an award on him.

  

Regards
