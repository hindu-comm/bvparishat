Dear Members,

SVVU, Tirupati held a National Conference on Vedas in March 2015. I was invited to give a talk on Geography in the Vedas. I was given the freedom to talk about new scientific researches in relation to Vedas. Thus encouraged. instead of talking about what others have done, I presented my research on the word Iriṇa and what it means to Vedic Geography and obviously ancient history. A full paper was prepared at the request of the organizers for inclusion in the Proceedings. I am yet to see the printed book titled *Veda Vijñāna Taraṅgiṇī*. The title of the proceedings is attractive but the SV Vedic University lacks credibility in its administration as far as my experience goes.

Students of Vedas who are not against modern analytical approaches may find points of interest in my work. Main stream Indologists may not like my analysis as it affects their pet theories about Vedic history and geography.

I am here attaching the slides used for my talk. The full text of the talk prepared for the Proceedings is at
