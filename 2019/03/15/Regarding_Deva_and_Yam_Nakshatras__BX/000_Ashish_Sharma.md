Dear All

  

Taittiriya brahman has mentioned 2 sets of nakshatras: Deva Nakshatra and Yam Nakshatra. This has been mentioned in 1.5.2.9

  

**कृत्तिका प्रथमं विशाखे उत्तमं तानि देवनक्षत्राणि।**

**अनुराधा प्रथमं अपभरणीः उत्तमं तानि यमनक्षत्राणि।।**

  

Please explain that why the two sets of nakshatras has been called as Deva and Yam?

What is the significance of these nakshatras while doing Yajna and other karmas? What is the spiritual significance?

  

My advanced thanks to all.

  

  

Best Regards
