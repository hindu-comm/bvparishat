Dear Professor Korad Ji

  

My humble Pranaam to you.

  

  

After reading your reply, one query came in my mind.

  

As per taittiriya brahman, **anuradha and shattara are yam nakshatras.**

  

  

Hence how to equate yam and deva nakshatra with these punyahavaachanam?

  

Or how punyahavaachanam differentiate yam and deva nakshatras?

  

  

Please explain.

  

  

Regards

  

  

Ashish Sharma
