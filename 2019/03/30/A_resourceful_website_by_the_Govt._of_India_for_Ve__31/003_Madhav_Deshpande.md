Just looked at this website. Recordings of the the Vedic texts are wonderful. Would be nice to see details of the reciters and the regions where they are from. I could figure out that the R̥gveda recitation was from Kerala. Will try some other recordings. Thanks to IGNCA, and thanks to Shri Subrahmanian for sharing the link.
