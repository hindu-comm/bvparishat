Dear Subbu-ji,

  

Thanks for forwarding the web-site address. It has some useful reading material, including a Tamil translation of the taittirIya samhitA which I haven't seen before. Regarding the recordings, I took a quick listen to the taittirIya samhitA 4.5, which is the rudram. There are a number of recitation errors - unfortunately. The reciter says adhyavo!cadadhi, in sentence 11, i.e., transferring the svarita to vo instead of dhya. Almost immediately he says heDa I!mahe instead of heDa! Imahe. There is one more more error right after that, this is just in the first anuvAkam of probably the most popular vedic text in the South. I stopped listening to it after that. Perhaps there are some alternative svara traditions that I don't know about, but to my mind these seem like errors. The recitation is also not smooth, sounds very strained, but that's not a big issue by itself.

  

Ramakrishnan
