Namaste Subbuji, Ramaji,

  

Subbuji, thanks for pointing out a great resource at a single URL.

  

Ramaji, on your note, I too heard it now and found that the pronunciation of the akSharas and mAtrA doesn't sound shuddha either, let alone svaras! I may be wrong, but even beforeadhyavochadadhi, I think I hear mRDara instead of mRDaya and then bi-(and)-bharShyastave seem split. Could anyone confirm this please? I have a very bad habit (or issue) of picking up others' chanting errors and making them my own, which is why I had difficulty studying vedapATha in a group where individual students were to chant in front of other students!

  

Kind rgds,
