Dear Scholars,

  I have uploadedKarnataka Shabdanushasanam (1890), originally published in Kannada and Roman scripts by B. Lewis Rice, but the same was converted by me into the devanagari script in 1992. It is a Kannada grammar written in Sanskrit sutras by Bhattakalankadeva in 1604 AD. The vRtti and vyAkhyA are also in Sanskrit. I have converted only up to the vRtti part but I have indicated the sutra nos. also that are applicable in case of given examples, which are found in the vyAkhyA.

  I hope, it will be useful for those Sanskritists who cannot read in Kannada script, but are interested in having some idea about Kannada grammar.
