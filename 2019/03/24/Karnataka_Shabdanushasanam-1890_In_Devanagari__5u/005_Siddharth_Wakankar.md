Dear Shri Narayan Prasad,

  

I appreciate your zeal,enthusiasm and perseverance,the three most important qualities for a scholar/ researcher.

  

I also used to go for nearly two months from Vadodara to Dahilaxmi Library in Nadiad on every Sunday to copy down rare and unpublished Sanskrit manuscripts.That is how you have to be dedicated and sincere to pursue your passion.

  

By the way,I also admire you for your self study of Vyakarana.

  

May I know your exact academic background and profession, because,you seem to be a very voracious reader having varied interests.

  

Thanks for your kind words.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
