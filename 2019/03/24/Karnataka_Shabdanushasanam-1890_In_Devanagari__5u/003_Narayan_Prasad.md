Respected Prof. Kannan and Prof. Wakankar,

   Namaste.

   Thanks for your good words about the work and my effort to present it in devanagari script.

  

   I came to know about this work by two sources:

     (1) in January 1981 through the book "कन्नड भाषा प्रवेश" (1973) by श्री दिवेकर, pp.196-198 (pages attached). It says: "To show that Kannada is also an important language like Sanskrit, Bhattakalankadeva wrote, c.1604 AD, a प्रौढ कन्नड व्याकरण on the model of अष्टाध्यायी and महाभाष्य."

     (2) in 1990 or so, through"संस्कृत व्याकरणशास्त्र का इतिहास" (1984) by पं॰ युधिष्ठिर मीमांसक जी, पृ॰183-184 (pages attached). From it I came to know the nature of sUtra and the vRtti.

  

   Having learnt Panini (on my own) from August 1987, I was very eager to see the bookकर्णाटकशब्दानुशासनम्. I did not know where to get the book from. In January 1991 I became Life Member of BORI Library.
Fortunately, in December 1992 I found the book in BORI library itself. Since the book was published in 1890 and the pages were too brittle to be xeroxed, I decided to note down the sUtras and the vRtti. Coming from a Hindi belt, I was not used to write fast enough in Kannada script, I decided to note down in Devanagari. And in about 9 months I could complete the work. It took so much time, because I was employed and could visit BORI mainly on Saturday that was the day off for us. Not only that, on Saturdays the library remained open only from 7:30 AM to 10:30 AM and I could reach there by bus only at about 9 AM.

  

  Best regards

  Narayan Prasad
