\>Great effort and perseverence!

\>

\>I appreciate your zeal,enthusiasm and perseverance

  

Thank you, sirs.

  

\>By the way, I also admire you for your self study of Vyakarana.

  

Thank you sir. Formally, I studied Sanskrit only up to 11th standard in which we were taught only 5 lakaras out of total 11 in Skt grammar.

  

\>May I know your exact academic background and profession, because,you seem to be a very voracious reader having varied interests.

  

B.Tech. (Civil Engg.) from IIT Kharagpur (1980). Specialized in Hydraulic Engineering. Professionally worked in the same field and after 35 years of service in Central Govt., retired in 2015.

Also, Diploma in Russian Literature (1984), Diploma in German Language (1986), by attending evening classes, from University of Poona.

Attended French classes only for 2 months.

The rest I have learnt only from self-study.

  

Script has never been a problem for me. I am conversant with almost all the main Indian scripts. I have prepared a single editor through which I can type in 11 different scripts (by modifying an existing one that could be used to type only in 3 scripts - Devanagari, Roman and Russian).

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
