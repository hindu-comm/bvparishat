Yes...

Play was wonderful. Thanks to the team for giving the fantastic experience. Not only we, my son 3 years old Aanandavardhana also enjoyed a lot.

The combination of Angika and vachika was brilliant.

Appreciation to Kalagowri team for providing platform which has lot of positivity.This can be felt who is committed to art. The environment itself has brought a new light to the artmind whoever presented as audience.

The play is partially available to see in my Facebook live video. Plz excuse for not giving good quality. Here I am posting only the concluding ceremony. The rest of the videos are available in my FB account.
