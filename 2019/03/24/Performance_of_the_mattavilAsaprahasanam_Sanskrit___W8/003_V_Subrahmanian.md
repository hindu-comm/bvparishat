The performance was superb. The actors did a splendid job. Their dialogue delivery was very impressive. The audience was told that none of the actors had studied Sanskrit as a subject in their school or college. For an Engineering student team to do such a wonderful performance speaks volumes about the Director, the individual caliber of the actors and their commitment to the task.

  

Dr.R.Ganesh delivered a very appreciative talk and his words of encouragement and advice was well received by the actors and the entire team. He wished them well and enthused them to be ever committed to doing more and more Sanskrit dramas even after they take up a career in their field of academics later in life. The team did display that promise in them. 

  

I thank Sri Manish Rajan Walvekar for his great role in this performance. The video of the play will soon be uploaded and link provided here, I am told.

  

The Amrita Institute deserves accolades for their commitment to have Sanskrit as a part of the curriculum for the Engineering students for the first two years of their course.
