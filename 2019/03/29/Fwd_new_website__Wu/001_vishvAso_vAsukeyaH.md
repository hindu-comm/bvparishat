It is very heartening to see this site (glancing at <http://reformedhindupanchang.in/youbethejudge.html> ), which also reminds me of the writings and practices of a kauNDinyAyana family of nepal - <http://indiafacts.org/vedic-system-of-chronology/> .

  

If others here have examined this calendar, please let me know your observations. One of my goals is to grow the jyotisha software (<https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/jyotisha> ) to be capable of serving the needs of principled ritualists.
