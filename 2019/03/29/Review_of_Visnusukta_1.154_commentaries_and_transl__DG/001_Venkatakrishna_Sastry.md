Namaste

  

Very good paper reviewing the challenges that arises out of translating texts of tradition in the threefold inappropriate frames of 1. Language deviation 2. Context of text deviation and 3. Tradition deviation. All appreciations to Prof. Veeranarayana Pandurangi.

  

This paper would serve better if supplemented with two more points, as a comprehensive overview ( we call it poorva-paksha-sangraha) to make the scholarly appeal better, especially for global audience, who may not get the total message of samskruth texts used in expanding the views.

  

1\. Taking the position that western scholars are equally sympathetic and carry concerns for academic excellence, what factors did the wrstern translators miss/ overlook / construct differently from traditional schools? This is where PIE schools need response.

  

  

2. Given the pedagogy of language of text- construction, traditional schools have no difficulty in accepting a 700 bce grammar rule ( pf panini) used by a 1400 c.e. Commentator on a text earlier to 4000 b.c.e ( vedic text vishnu sukta). But this singular thread of linguistic connectivity and continuity is what is challenged continuously, since Prof. Max Mullers efforts of translations of sacred texts of east. So, we need a clarity on how traditional schools respond to Maxmullerian frame, the western advancements and improvisations on Macmuller ( and others) bringing out new translations. This is an area where Prof. sheldon pollock has strong writings ( philo... a special term identified by RM as Pollocks pedagogy for Sanskrit studies). This is where modern translators of 20th century need to be responded to.

  

It is not enough to say a note of rejection; a proper reason needs to be adduced.

  

Lookforward for scholars inputs.
