Respected Scholars,

Bharatiya Vidya Prakashan, Varanasihas published Setubandha kaavyamof Pravarasena. It looks to be a reprint of "kaavyamaalaaSeries". The first two cantos endas follows,"\[इति श्रीप्रवरसेनविरचिते दशमुखवधे महाकाव्ये \_\_\_ आश्वासकः समाप्तः ॥\]". From 3rd canto onwards, each canto ends as follows,"\[इति श्रीप्रवरसेनविरचिते *कालिदासकृते*दशमुखवधे महाकाव्ये

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ आश्वासकः परिसमाप्तः ॥\]. What is the background to
*कालिदासकृते*getting added? Iwould be grateful for any guidance.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy

[\[1\]](#m_-8883085143525518212__ftnref1) It is not clear why “कालिदासकृते” is added from Chapter 3 onwards.
