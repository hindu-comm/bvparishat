Shri Bijoyji.

  

Thanks for the conferred doctorate, but i don't have one as of now...in the interests of transparency.

  

  

Sir which interpretations do you find arbitrary and why?

If you are implying that other people might use the passage highlighted to write distortive pieces, all i can say is agenda driven people are as old as civilization and they will always find a way.

I have no axe to grind either way and the purpose of this discussion was merely to frame certain practices within a historical context of itihasa puranas.

  

Kind Regards.
