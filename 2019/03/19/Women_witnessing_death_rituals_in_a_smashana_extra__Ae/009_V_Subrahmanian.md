In Karnataka, as far as I have seen, among Brahmins this practice is not there. Women do not go to the cremation ground. Both Tamil and Kannada Brahmins (Trimatha-s) follow this rule. In fact in certain Kannada Brahmin families they prevent men who have living parents from going to the crematorium.
