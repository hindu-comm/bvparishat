Mr Ramesh.. I am not a vidvan.. and you know me.. even outside.. In many texts on preta pitru karyams, women are seen to have been permitted even to set fire in the chest urasi agnyaadhaanam.. in silence without chanting Vedamantras.. So the issue is very clear from the ritualistic point of view.. You can refer to most texts on shraddham and pitru karyam and this is clear..  
But I am not here to give quotes.. not because I cannot give... but I am not interested in this formally academic discussion.. I would advice you to refer to Deekshiteeyam or other texts or simply ask some
qualified purohita either in Palakkad or in your Gobi..  
  
Vaideeka karyams are usually decided by local practices and the texts followed locally.. and any practice is valid and dharmic unless it is contradictory to shruti.. And no shruti says women should not visit
smashaanam..
