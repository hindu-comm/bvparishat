In my native place Gobichettipalayam in Tamilnadu and other surroundings, women are permitted to come inside rudra bhoomi and do vakkarisi ( putting rice in the mouth) and see the entire proceedings especially in the brahmin clans.Only condition is that they will come wet with 9 yards saree with dishevelled hair split into two parts.

Same is equally true at Satyamangalam, Erode areas..  

In Chennai, they prohibited calling it as a great sin..

I agree with Dr. Korada garu we have to follow the देशाचार / शिष्टाचार ।
