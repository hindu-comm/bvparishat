Dear Dr Venkat and friends,  

I wish people don't make arbitrary interpretations from picked out sections  

or commentaries. These casual interests have led to heavy distortions.

It would be an excellent contribution if you dig out enough to compile a good

essay or a book on "Sociology in Valmiki's Ramayana"  

Best regards,

BM
