Following a dead body to the burial ground is different from paying respects to the dead in a battlefield before they are cremated. Usually dead soldiers are not carried back to the city bot their final rites are carried out in the battlefield where they fell or a short distance away. May be the purificatory rites otherwise performed are also not necessary in this case. In the Mahabharata also women visited the dead warriors.
