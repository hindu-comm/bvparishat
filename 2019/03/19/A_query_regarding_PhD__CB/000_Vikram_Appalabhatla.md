Revered Scholars,

  

Namaskaras, I am Vikram, MA in Advaita Vedanta.

  

I would like to do my PhD on 'Bhavartha Deepika' , a commentary on Gita by Saint Gnaneshwar Maharaj of Maharashtra.

  

As you all know, the source text would be in ancient Marathi language, and I do not possess any certification in Marathi language. Hence, is it possible for me to do my PhD in Sanskrit language?

  

Please guide me in this regard and please do suggest the other possibilities as well.

  

  

Dhanyavaadaah,

  

Vikram Appalabhatla.
