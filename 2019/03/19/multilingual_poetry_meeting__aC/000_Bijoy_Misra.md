Dear scholar friends,

  

What I am sharing is not necessarily scholarly, but it has

creative element in it. It is a group that has slowly built through

in order to hear voices from different countries of South Asia and  

different regions of India in poetic compositions. Once in a while  

we throw in Sanskrit, otherwise it is Urdu, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi,  

Gujarati, Bengali, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali,

Kashmiri, Assamese and Odia.

  

The group is called South Asian Poets of New England (SAPNE)  

and meets every quarter. An annual meeting happens in Harvard  

as a continuation of multi-language recitation events we began in  

1997\.

  

The video below is the 43rd quarterly meeting of SAPNE The topic is

"Voice of the Mothers and the Youth".

Best regards,
