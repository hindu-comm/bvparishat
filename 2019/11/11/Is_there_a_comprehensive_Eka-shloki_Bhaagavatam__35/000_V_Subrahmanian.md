There is a famous Eka shloki Bhagavatam:

  

Aadau Devakidevi-garba-jananam Gopee-grihe Vardhanam  
Maaya-pootani-jeevi-ta apa-haranam Govardhanadhaaranam  
Kamsachchedana-kauravaadi-hananam Kuntisutaa-paalanam  
Hyetat-Bhagavatam Purana Punya-kathitam SriKrishna-leelamritam  

  

Even though this is a condensation of only Krishna's leelaa, the other avataras told in the Bhagavatam are not alluded to in this condensation. If there is a shloka of that nature it would be interesting to read.
