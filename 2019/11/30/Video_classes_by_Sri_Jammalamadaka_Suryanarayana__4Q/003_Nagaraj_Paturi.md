Sri Jammalamadaka Suryanarayana who is teaching in these videos is highly articulate in English too. So members interested in learning Shastra through English may approach him for online classes.

  

His brother Jammalamadaka Srinivas who lives in Tirupati and is a member of BVP is equally articulate in English and can be approached for
learning Shastra through English online.
