Just like Rishi Goswami, I too would like to find out how to get notifications of Sanskrit lectures conducted by traditional scholars. While it's great to know that these scholars speak English fluently, I'd rather find a course in Sanskrit and use the teacher's good knowledge of English for occasional clarification. Is there a mailing list to join to be notified of such courses and lectures?
