Namaste,

  

Following results were obtained for shraavaNa bahula ashTamii tithi in the year 1655 AD, for the location of Ujjain (India), using the online calculator from<http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/>

This was the tithi prevailing at the sunrise time on Wednesday August 25th (Gregorian), that is, August 8th (Julian), AD 1655. However, this tithi lasted for a very short time after sunrise on that day. Which
means, this tithi began shortly after sunrise on the previous day (Tuesday). Depending on whether you were looking for the equivalent date for this tithi on the civilian calendar (which usually means the date which had this tithi prevailing at sunrise), or whether you were looking for the date on which a particular religions ceremony was held on this tithi or the date when this tithi started, your answer might be the date for either the Tuesday or the Wednesday. You can perhaps iterate the calculations varying the input parameters, to arrive at the date you need.
