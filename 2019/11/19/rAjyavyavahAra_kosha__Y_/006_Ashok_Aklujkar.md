Dear Shri Shankara,

  

Your translation is generally fine and serves what I see as the purpose for the present. Perhaps "एक विद्वान” should be replaced by“उस विद्वान्”, understood as referring to the compiler of the Rājya-vyavahāra-kośa (which would imply that the verse under discussion is written by someone other than the compiler of theRājya-vyavahāra-kośato introduce thework— somewhat like a modern foreword).

  

Pl let me know if my suggestion conflicts with what precedes and/or what follows the verse.

  

a.a.
