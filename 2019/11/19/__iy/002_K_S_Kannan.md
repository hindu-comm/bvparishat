Dear scholars,

  

I am not sure whether I raised this question earlier.

  

Have any attempts been made to document the *guru-s'is"ya-paramparA* in Indology in the West,  

starting from the days of Sir William Jones (or whoever made some significant beginnings)?

Of course, such a list of scholars in the East is also required,

and no significant scholar should be omitted.  

(We may tentatively have a very rough description of a scholar

as one who has contributed articles to journals, or authored books

in the past 250 years).  

  

An advantage with such a list in the former case (especially) is that  

it facilitates a perusal of the patterns and proliferation of typical fields and methodologies

(or even prejudices). And the works of many important modern scholars of India

often bear a stamp of the presuppositions or methods of interpretation

of their Western masters/guides.  

  

There surely are some Indian scholars, who, though trained in the West

are not sold to their thinking patterns. (Possibly, a scholar like KASubrahmanya Iyer

counts among them). But there are many who have written almost spitefully or sans regard  

for values of our heritage (perhaps even RGBhandarkar himself).  

How many, and who all, were trained in the West or under Western scholars?

There surely are those who are only partly influenced,

and it may become important to define "influence" also.  

  

Is it possible to put in one place the scholarly lineages as, say,  

\(a\) purely Western,  

\(b\) purely Indian (at least in the last century or so),  

\(c\) Indians trained under Westerners and toeing their line mostly, and

\(d\) Indians adhering to Indian value systems by and large, and

\(e\) all the rest that may not fit into the above groups?

(Of course, there could be special cases - as of Kielhorn who considered himself  

an heir to the vyAkaraNa tradition!)

  

(And there are many Western scholars who studied under Indian guru-s,

but never even acknowledged the same, cloaking it all under their typical  

arrogant note of "my native informer tells me..." etc.)  

  

This could perhaps be a theme for an MPhil/PhD work, or even for some Project,

depending on the length and breadth of investigation. If this has not so far been attempted,

it may go to serve some useful purposes.
