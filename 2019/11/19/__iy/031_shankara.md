Namaste,

  

This is not directly related to this thread, but not totally unrelated. I came across a website dedicated to Aahitaagni Rajwade and his works. The site is in initial stages and webmaster has plans to add more resources on the scholar.

  

At present Marathi commentaries by Aahitaagni Rajwade on Bhagavad Gita, Isavasyopanishad and Naasadiya Sukta are made available on the website.

regards  
shankara
