Dear Irene,

  

What you say looks quite probable.

  

Traditional scholars often remained indifferent to the alien rulers, or remained wary of them,

and the alien despots had unconcealed contempt for these scholars.

  

Inquisitions in Goa, beheadings in Varanasi, "the perfect genocide" in Kashmir - to sample but a few,

where all, pandits and scholars bore the brunt, and were devastated, butchered and crushed to death  

\- have their own sordid stories to tell. We do not know how many Nehemiah Gorehs were brought into being,

and how many libraries were burnt down. Inimical social climate repudiates, jeopardises and decimates  

all contrary proclivities, talents, and endeavours.  

  

Yet some attempt must be made to chronicle what little is left to study.

  

"Full many a gem of purest ray serene,  

The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:  

Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,  

And waste its sweetness on the desert air.  

  

Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast  

The little tyrant of his fields withstood;  

Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,  

Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood... "
