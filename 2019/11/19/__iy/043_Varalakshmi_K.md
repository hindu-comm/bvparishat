Sri Galagali Ramacharyulu founder of 'Madhuravani' Sanskrit magazine, composed three compositions in aswadhativrittam. His works are compiled and published in the form of a book called Madhuranjali, in which these three compositions are available.

1\. श्रीमदश्वधाटीकाव्यम्

2\. अश्वधाटीश्रीवेङ्कटेशाष्टकम्

3\. अश्वधाटीश्रीगुरुसार्वभौमस्तवाष्टकम्

I did my M.Phil research on his works.
