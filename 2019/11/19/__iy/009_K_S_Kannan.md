Undoubtedly this is a laudable attempt, and many thanks, sir, for drawing attention to this.

When even our Upanis"ad-s paid importance to the sequence "*atha vaMs'aH*" (BU),

the order must figure as important, ratherthan, or much more than, an alphabetical order.

  

Sequences can have consequences.
