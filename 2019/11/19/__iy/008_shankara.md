Sir,

  

'The Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars' -संस्कृत विद्वत् परिचायिका - published by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan fulfils your requirement to some extent. It contains bio-data of 5000 Sanskrit scholarswho were born between 1850 to 1990 A.D.   

  

<https://archive.org/details/InventoryOfSanskritScholars_201807>

  

The inventory contains the name of scholars, qualification, date of birth, place of birth, positions, teachers and disciples (GuruShishya-Parampara), numbers and titles of published books and research papers, addresses, awards and honors, foreign visits etc. and gives also a resume of their significant contributions to Sanskrit.

  

Let us hope, the detailed bio-data of these scholars are still preserved at Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan.  

  

regards  
shankara
