Even with a database there is no way of knowing in whose presence this  
given person stepped into that moment when one understands and becomes  
one with the object of knowledge. Subsequent work is often an attempt  
to set into words and proofs that instant.  
Example: go to Maths genealogy and look up Saul Lubkin. The database  
shows John Tate as the thesis supervisor. Tate, as you can see in the  
database, supervised many students, some of whom are prominent  
mathematicians of today (e.g. Ribet, Dwork, Gross, Lubkin), but most  
of whom are normal well-educated mathematicians. But no database could  
express the depth and the intensity of the influence Andre Weil had on  
Lubkin. Nor would a database show that Lubkin's is an extraordinary  
mind, whoever might have been his thesis advisor. Neither Weil nor  
Tate made this mind into what it is. Whereas there are many -  
certainly competent - mathematicians who were shaped by the thought of  
their PhD supervisors.  
This is why it seems to me that locating and reading the works is the  
key activity. A study of lineages is just the means to that end.
