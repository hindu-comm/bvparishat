Dear Irene,

  

  A beginning in that direction can be made by looking at existing accounts like the book काशी की पाण्डित्य परंपरा or Khiste's book विद्वच्चरितपञ्चकम्, and known histories of institutions like the Benares Sanskrit College \[later Varanaseya SamskritaVishvavidyalaya\], Calcutta Sanskrit College, Poona Sanskrit College \[later Deccan College\] etc. The history of the Vedaśāstrottejaka Sabhā published in Marathi is very informative. N. C. Kelkar published an account in Marathi of lineages of Marathi Vaidika Pandits. The detailed account of the Guruparamparā of Mahamahopadhyaya Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar going back to the great Nāgeśabhaṭṭa can be found in the Prastāvanā volume of his Marathi translation of the Mahābhāṣya. Similar institutional and individual histories can be traced in places like Mysore, Kumbhakonam, Tanjore, Madras etc. The recent book "The Sons of Sarasvati" by Professor C. Ravishankar, giving detailed biographical accounts of three Sanskrit pundits from 19th century Mysore is a great addition of such needed histories.
