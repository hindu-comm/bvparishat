Dear Dr. Kannan,

  

  Such information needs to be extracted from numerous felicitation and commemoration volumes and obituaries of scholars. Such information is there, but not all in one place. It will be a great project to collect such information. One such informative volume is the proceedings of the Whitney Memorial Meeting after Professor W,D. Whitney passed away. That gives information about the early Sanskrit academic tradition in the USA.
