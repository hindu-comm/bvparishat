Dr. Irene,

  

I heard of one great scholar from Bengal,whose works kept in a cupboard were not touched or allowed to be touched by the librarian.His name is Dr. Bata Krishna Ghosh,the author of many books, esp. Linguistic Introduction to Sanskrit.

  

This account was narrated to me by Prof.D.D. Mahulkar,one of the great mathematical linguistics of this era.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
