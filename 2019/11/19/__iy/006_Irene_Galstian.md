I would be very interested even in a list of prominent Indian Sanskritists of the late 19th- 20th centuries.  
In communist times, for example, there were phenomenal minds who werenâ€™t promoted formally because they stayed away from the party propaganda. The same could have been the case in India: an excellent scholar could have been well known to immediate students but not widely known because of the social climate.
