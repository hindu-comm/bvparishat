Dear Professor Deshpande,

  

Thank you for the priceless references and clues.

When you say 'known histories of institutions', could you please give some examples of titles? Apologies for the basic questions: this is a new area, so I need to assemble a small set of keywords to be able to search on my own and to gradually expand the search criteria.

Do you by any chance recall any part of the title of Kelkar's book?

Marathi sources are more accessible to me language-wise, so it makes sense to focus on these. Having compiled a list of scholars, the next step would be to locate and read their works.  

  

Best wishes,

Irene
