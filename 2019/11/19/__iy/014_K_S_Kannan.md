Yes, Prof. Deshpande, it will indeed be a great project.

Yes, it needs to be culled from the numerous FVs (Felicitation Volumes).

All the same, how many have died without anything like FVs!

Especially in our country.

  

To be able to capture the accomplishments of even one lineage  

would also be an accomplishment in itself. To draw then, first,  

the bare skeletons of the various lineages would also lay bare many things.

Things will all be bound up with socio-political issues too.

  

How the West was first enamoured with Sanskrit, glorified it enormously,

got disillusioned with it, or more truly developed prejudice against it,

struck at its roots at its homeland, came then to hold sway over it,  

and embark upon giving shape to it as it did to no other language/heritage/civilisation,

accompanied by the whys of all these - should indeed be quite engrossing if not also appalling.  

My generalisations may be rather broad, but I am only broadly speaking, after all.

The way different nationalities clashed even among Indologists

can fill some flesh and blood to the story of the evolution of Indology.

  

Sanskritists here in India did not remain untouched either by these developments,

and some were evidently swept off their feet, and some endeavoured to introspect.

Colossal scholars like Ananda Coomaraswamy strode across centuries and civilisations,

yet too soon they came to be ignored, though their ideas were by no means negated and nullified.

Replicas of Coomaraswamy's thoughts and expressions still figure in, or rather course through,  

in one form or the other, many of the writings of Wendy Doniger or Frederick Smith or Brian Smith or Sadashiv Dange,

\- though mostly not openly or commensurately acknowledged. A backlash seems to be gaining strength too

as many Indians, after being economically successful, are turning to discover their roots,

especially against the background of ABCDs (America-based confused Desis) getting directionless.

An alternate picture is provided by growing intricacies of Proto-Indo-European studies on the one hand,  

and an utter disapproval of the Aryan Invasion Theory on the other.  

  

Decoding of astounding bits of astronomical phenomena recorded in the Vedic, similarly,  

and the usurpation, and ingestion of many Yogic ideas into scientific theories and paradigms,  

foisting novel nomenclature to conceal such annexations for covering up plagiarisms galore  

as well as commercial booty, all again without due and proper acknowledgement;  

prejudices prevailing/growing even among geneticists in their accounts of either the  

Aryan-Dravidian Theory or the genesis of the Varna-Jati system  

betray the role of developments in science having a bearing on Indological trends and concerns.  

  

A study of the forces of history and politics behind these can perhaps afford interesting insights,

and a *simhAvalokana* would indeed be worth the effort, and may be expected to yield rich results.
