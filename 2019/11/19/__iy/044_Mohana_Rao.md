J K Mohana Rao  
  

SrI paLLe pUrNapraGYAchArya wrote a few ashTakams in aSvadhATi.

  

Also the famous daSAvatArastOtra of vAdirAjayati (who was a hayagrIva bhakta and who probably gave the name aSvadhATi which was known as mattEbha in mandAramaranda) is in this metre, which was sung by vidyAbhUShaNa, available on youtube.

  

Of course, even though aMbAshTakam is attributed to kAlidAsa, I think the kavikulatilaka never wrote it. May be an unknown poet or another poet with the name kAlidAsa. SyAmalAdaNDaka was also not by kAlidAsa.
