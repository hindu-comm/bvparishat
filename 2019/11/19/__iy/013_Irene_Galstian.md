Dear Professor Deshpande,

  

Thank you, that's very helpful. For example, where should I start if I want to trace Indian Vedic scholars? Samhitas and brahmanas mostly.

I'm after Indian scholars who either had traditional Indian teachers or non-Indian teachers whose treatment of the tradition was sensitive. I'm not under the illusion that somehow normal distribution has been switched off when it comes to traditionally trained scholars. Still, I'm keen to locate both the mainstream opinions and the outliers of both traditions.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
