Not answering exactly to the wording of the question:

  

Halbfass, Wilhelm. India and Europe. State University of New York Press (as I recall).

Windish, E.Geschichte der sanskrit-philologie und indischen altertumskunde. Strassburg. Trübner, K.J., 1917-1920

  

R.N. Dandekar and V. Raghavan wrote survey articles after they attended sessions of the International Association of Orientalists, mainly to identify trends for the benefit of Indian scholars. Details can be found in the Festschrifts published in their honour.
