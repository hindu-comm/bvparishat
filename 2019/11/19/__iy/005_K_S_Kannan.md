Dear Prof. Wakankar,

Thank you for the immensely useful information supplied.

I have seen both the significant works referred to by you.  

Yes, there are many books, mostly small ones, on many individual Indologist.

  

But what is perhaps needed is the lineages of scholars.

German scholars show certain trends, French ones show certain patterns etc.,

and sometimes there are admixtures. Certain fields are not taken up at all till a certain period,

and certain periods betray certain fashions. Now this effort could be rather comprehensive,

tracing influences, showing developments etc. The study of Vedic Syntax, for example,

since the last century to the most recent ones can show variations in themes and concerns

and tools and methods. So with the study of texts on astronomy/mathematics in Sanskrit,

or even Ayurveda, and Panini.

  

(Was there a work called 75 years of Indological Research, or some such title?)

  

Nothing matches a comprehensive work on this theme, and it is not easy to do.

Lineages documented can themselves trigger new ideas/lines of search.
