Dear Dr.Kannan,

  

A very important topic to work on.

  

There are books like German Indologists,published,i think,by the Max Muller Bhavan or so,Mumbai,where sketches of German scholars with their contributions and at times their teachers [etc.is](http://etc.is) given.

  

Secondly,G.A. Ganesan or Natesan from Madras published somewhere in early 1910s a very good book on Prominent Orientalists or so,wherein also we get vital info.

  

Dr.Amruta Natu,a young scholar from BORI, Pune, worked for her Ph. D. on George Buhler, under the able guidance of Prof. G. U. Thite.

  

I tried to collect information about the British Orientalists from the British Library,Mumbai,but could not get much response from them.

  

Hope,this may help you in this direction.

  

Best of luck in our efforts.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
