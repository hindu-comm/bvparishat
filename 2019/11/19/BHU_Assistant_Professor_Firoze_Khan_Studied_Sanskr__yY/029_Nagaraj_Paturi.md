\> 1. Is it a requirement that one has to be born to a Brahmin family to study ancient dharmagranthas?

-- 1. For studying *about*dharmagranthas, there is no bar on anyone.

  2. For training people in the dharma of the dharma granthas , the trainer must be a believer in the dharma of the dharma granthas. A believer in anything that considers the believers in dharma as ineligible for positive religious benefits such as meritorious consequences after death can not be accepted as a a believer in the dharma of the dharma granthas.
