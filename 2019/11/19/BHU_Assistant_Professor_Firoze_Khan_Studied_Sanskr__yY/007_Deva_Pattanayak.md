Inclusiveness is the Brahma Sabda used by pujaniya Acharya Khan.

The Dharmagurus should encourage Purbapahya on this throughout Bharat.

Let all speak with such inner conviction that satbuddhi prevail and sama bhava bring sat chit ananda to sarbatmas.

Every member of BVP in their individual capacities come forward publicly to not only say but act not only to persuade the few students to change their adharmic activities in making wrong statements for which the university must take action.

I have held only an adjunct position at an university but there are many illustrious professors who are members of BVP.

Please come forward with your opinions on this matter.

Time to bring in inclusiveness that rings in the age old statement Basundeva Kutumbekam.

  

Iswara Allah tero nam Apneku Aap de Sanmati.
