Smt Irene ji--  

  

This is not about Indians. Any person irrespective of geography or religion can study and teach shastra provided they do so out of motives of interest/love and not out of motives like that of Kumarila Bhatta.

Many study for the sake of refuting or from the perspective of reducing something profound to a modern idiom...think Wendy, Devdutt Pattnaik and Sheldon P.

  

The issue over here is not as simple as it seems.

  

1\. I am uncomfortable on why the man's Muslim identity has been widely publicised leading me to question if that is really the issue. The Indian MSM has been known to play such dirty tricks and I frankly do not trust journalists to be objective or fair when it comes to TRP or eyeballs since this is a life or death problem for them. In such cases the truth is the first casuality.

  

2\. Point 1 is even more pertinent since there are plently of muslims who have topped and got gold medals in Sanskrit. This includes men and women. So why is this an issue?

  

3\. The second post suggests that favoritism and an appointment when there were worthier names in the list seems a possibility.

  

4\. If Dr. Firoze was confident about his credentials, why does he play the "muslim" card instead of highlighting his academic credentials and his research work?

  

5\. If he really is a worthy candidate, the students should be put in their place by being asked to either put up or get out. There is another agitation in Delhi where JNU students who have been roosting on prime realestate paying a pittance. This has become a sort of fashion nowadays to protest for everything.

  

I am an outsider and not privy to internal politics, but from outside, the above is what I see..

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
