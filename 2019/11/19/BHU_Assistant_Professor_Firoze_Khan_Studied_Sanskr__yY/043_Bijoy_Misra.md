Thank you, Irene for an eloquent post.

One does not become an Eskimo by training. Living in polar region is different than traveling to there.

I don't become an Englishman by speaking English.  

Certain skills are cultural and nurtured by local geography and the local empiricism.  

In the practice of life there is more knowledge in cultural experience than parroting books.
