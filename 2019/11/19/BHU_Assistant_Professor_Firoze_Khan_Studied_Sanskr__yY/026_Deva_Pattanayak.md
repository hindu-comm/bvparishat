Every institution has its own vision, goals and objectives and is entitled to hire faculty and staff. External interference other than following UGC and HRD guidelines is not called for.

The authorities bear the responsibility of handling the demands of students.

  

Academic freedom is necessary.

This goes for all types of institution.

  

By the way one of the question of Yakhya to Judhistira was “who is a true Brahmin ” in the Mahabharata.

The correct answer is in favor of Professor Khan.

Dharma becomes stronger when questions are raised and answered scientifically.
