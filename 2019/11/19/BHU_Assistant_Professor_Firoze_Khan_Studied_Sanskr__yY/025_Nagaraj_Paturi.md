Is there a difference between Sahitya department as part of SVDV and
the Department of Sanskrit under the Faculty of Arts?

  

If there is no difference, is it not an unnecessary duplication and waste of resources and administrative and organizational redundancy to have two different departments?

  

If one argues that there is no duplication and waste of resources and administrative and organizational redundancy, then it implies that the
Sahitya department as part of SVDV shares the spirit of SVDV of which it is a part and that is what makes it different from the Department of Sanskrit under the Faculty of Arts.
