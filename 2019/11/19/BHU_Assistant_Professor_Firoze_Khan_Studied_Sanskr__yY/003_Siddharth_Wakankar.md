Malpractices and favouritism is the bane of scholarship almost in all the subjects and fields.I too heavily suffered because of that in Gujarat.

It seems the Sanskrit scholars are becoming a bit असंस्कृत and as you know,the media is totally partial and will focus only on those sensational aspects which will increase their viewership.

  

Less said is better,more said is worst.
