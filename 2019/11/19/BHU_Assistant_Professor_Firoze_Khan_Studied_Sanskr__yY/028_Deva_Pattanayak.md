Dear Venkat-ji

The basic issue is inclusiveness and to the degree it should be pursued.

In any pluralistic society one encounters persons raised in cultures not experienced by one. Should one follow a hands off or an open welcome attitude while not giving up established ways.

I will ask two questions here:

1\. Is it a requirement that one has to be born to a Brahmin family to study ancient dharmagranthas?

2\. What Is the ratio of non-Brahmin faculty to total faculty in the fields of Sanskrit and Philosophy?

Best regards

Deva
