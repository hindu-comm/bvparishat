Respected Vidvaansah!

  

The students in BHU are only protesting his appointment in SVDV. They have also proposed that he may be transferred to the Sanskrit department which is in the faculty of arts. Noone has questioned his scholarship or his ability. The conceptualization of Vedic Mahavidyalaya warrants people from Sanatan Dharma to study and teach the Dharm Vijnana.  

  

Pranaams.
