Dear Members,

  

Acharya Khan has not recruited to teach Sandhyaavandan. He was recruited to teach Sanskrit Sahitya in the department of Sahitya, SVDV.

  

Questions strikes to my mind are as follows:

Does religion stops you to study Sanskrit Shastras?

If that is the case, there are Eminent Scholars in the world who have mastered different Shastras irrespective of casteor religion.

  

When VC made it clear in his statement to the press that, recruitment was made according to UGC rules and regulations and BHU act.

  

Objection could have been raised if he was recruited to teach any other Shastra other than Sahitya.

We have a live example at BHU, a teacher who belongs to Hindu religion works at Department of Urdu, Faculty of Arts, BHU.

According to SVDV guidelines, if they don't encourage non-hindu candidates to teach at SVDV, BHU. They could have clearly mentioned in the BHU notification that only candidates who belong to Hindu religion are eligible to apply for the faculty position at BHU.

  

Any one can correct if my points are wrong.

  

  

Regards,

Praveen
