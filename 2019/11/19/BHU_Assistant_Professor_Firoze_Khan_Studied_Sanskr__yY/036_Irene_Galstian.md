Since this thread is always at the top of the list for past few days, I ended up reading it - and it seems that a key issue isn't being recognised. I apologise in advance if I've misunderstood any of the replies above.

  

Any human being can, through discipline and dedication, learn to read and understand - with exquisite subtlety - Sanskrit literature. But the SVDV Department seems to be a place where students who feel deeply about ritual and religious aspects have gathered to learn these aspects experientially, not theoretically. These students are also Indians, just as F. Khan is an Indian. For example, if a Muslim here in the UK wants a more strict Islamic education, he can go to one of the Islamic states and attend a conservative university there. But there's nowhere to 'export' these SVDV students, they are in the only land that gave birth to the religious views they want to learn and, more importantly, embody. If the students aren't willing to accept certain kinds of teachings from this teacher, the students must be heard. It's not a question of who is right or wrong, it's a question of living in a civilised way alongside people with different opinions. It seems well to admit that the university should have been clear that all SVDV faculty must be Hindus. Arguments that Sanskrit is 'only a language' display (at least to me - with apologies) a certain limited perception. As Prof Paturi indicated, there are good reasons to have Sahitya within SVDV and in Arts Faculty as separate options. Also please consider that treating the students and the dissenting SVDV faculty (who allegedly egg on the students) with respect is also a form of inclusiveness.

  

Overall, this preposterous, crudely fabricated story is a provocation to create problems between Hindu and Muslim Indians. I'm sure that people see through the ruse and view this pseudo-drama as the farce it is.
