\> 2. What Is the ratio of non-Brahmin faculty to total faculty in the fields of Sanskrit and Philosophy?

  

Philosophy and Sanskrit are two different university academic disciplines. It is a different matter that both are among the Humanities that are least preferred in the university social hierarchy of academic disciplines. Philosophy departments attract those who are ready for the least preference in the university social hierarchy in spite of having a great intellectual rigor. Brahmin or non-Brahmin does not play any role here.

  

Sanskrit departments as one of the the Humanities that are least preferred in the university social hierarchy of academic disciplines are not preferred by those who want a great financial or career advantage or PhD seats are jobs in affluent and developed countries.

  

The narrative of Sanskrit studies being not available for certain castes and gender is absolutely outdated. The story of Sanskrit studies in modern India is a completely a contradiction to the stereotype of Sanskrit studies being a field of Brahmin males. Arya Samaj and other movements, the government policies of affirmative action etc. have changed the scene in Sanskrit studies drastically. In fact, when Sanskrit studies are being offered on platter, encouraged thoroughly, there are allegations that the Brahmin studies are being thrust down the throats of the non-Brahmins. Now literature departments including Sanskrit departments are flooded more by women than men.

  

In Indian society, that is in a transition from traditional social order that based itself on the belief in the advantage of heriditary inheritance and right cum duty concept of occupations to a social order that is based on the preference given to individual choice for occupations over the advantages of traditional inheritance and right cum duty concept of occupations , there is currently a situation of a greater ratio in all contemporary forms of traditional occupations , from the individuals hailing from the families that had the traditional occupations as their family heredity. This is natural and expected in such a transition .
