BHU has a separate department for ‘Sanskrit language’ and literature under the Faculty of Arts, while Dr Firoz Khan has been appointed in the ‘Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan’. It was established by Madan Mohan Malaviya for protection of ‘Hindu Sanatan Dharma’ and give ‘scientific interpretation’ to Hinduism and its preservation. Where even today, education here is imparted like in Vedic gurukuls.

They study mantra, shloka, yagna, vaidik rituals, Purohit Karm, recitation, Bhagwat recitation, jyotish and karmakand. They are not only involved in the studies but it is also the source of their livelihood. Not all students studying there are studying for government jobs. However, some do go on to becoming Professor-Acharyas etc. by going through the method of study-teaching, but most of them spend their whole lives performing Purohit Karm and teaching and spreading knowledge and Vedas and Vedangs and ancient literature.
