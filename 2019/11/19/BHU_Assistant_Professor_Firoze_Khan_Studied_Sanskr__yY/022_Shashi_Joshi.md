The question should be - does the core beliefs of the new teacher believe in punarjanma.

  

Also, one must never forget niti-shAstra. Without which it is not possible to thrive in the world. adhyAtma talks of the other world, dharma talks of this world as well, but niti talks of how to surviveand conduct in this world practically.

For a long time in memory, Sanskrit has been equated to spirituality only. But before one dies, and tries to get mokSha, one has to live in this world, and that is better handled by niti.

  

  

Hint is enoughto the wise.  

  

There is difference between studying/learning and in teaching.

  

Try to flip the situation and imagine the normal reaction of all sides. Declared communist standing for public elections in US, even if citizen (maybe born in US, grew up in Russia, then comes back to US) will not be voted by many. \[Pls try to see the essence of the example, and not hairsplitting\]

  

BHU is not a primary school.

  

Language is nothing without the ideas it carries.

  

AchArya is one whose conduct itself teaches. When one's knowledge descends into one's daily conduct and ritual, then one is an AchArya.

  

Just because someone smiles, does namaste and talks nicely to one's wife/children doesn't mean there are no more limits/boundaries to their access. (For gender equality, you can flip the genders as well!)

  

When suitable, people equate Sanskrit to Hinduism, and inseparable from ir (specially when condemning teaching of Sanskrit in IIT or KVs), and when it really matters - teaching kAvya, dharma to students - one says Sanskrit is just a language! (Media statements)

  

Just because the administration did it on purpose, OR was not prepared for this, doesn't make it is right. Laws and even constitutions are changed and amended.

यस्य नास्ति स्वयं प्रज्ञा ...
