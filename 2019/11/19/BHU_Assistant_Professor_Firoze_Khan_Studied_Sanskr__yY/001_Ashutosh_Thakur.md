The issue is that It's a matter of favouritism where more meritorious, post-research candidates have been ignored and benefit given to F Khan. F Khan has been acquaintance & student of HoD,SVDV BHU when HoD was posted at Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Jaipur Campus, where F khan was also a student.The selection panel was selected by the HoD & he himself was part of panel. Even other members of the panel were handpicked by the HoD.  
It's legitimate on part of the students to demand fair enquiry in the appointment. Students are going to the extent of claiming that even a probe of 6 months phone call details between the HoD & F Khan will reveal the nexus.  
The students are alleging that appointment process was fixed by the HoD to select his favourite candidate for ulterior reasons.  
F Khan's muslim identity & consequential sympathy generated towards him in both ideological camps should not be a reason to shield him & the HoD from enquiry in a dubious appointment process.
