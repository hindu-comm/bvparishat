Actually it is about the basic belief. How can one say that Acharya Khan in his earlier life was not a learned sage.

If we believe in punerjanma , we have to give the benefitof the doubt especially when he was considered to be ten times better than the existing faculty of SVDV.

Is it not possible that a Brahmin this birth was a muslim in the earlier birth?

A Brahmin is one who has the ability to understand Brahman and not because of a Brahmin surname.
