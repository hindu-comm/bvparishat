Respected scholars ,

                  There are so many scholars and faculty of foreign universities exist here.

Its known by the issue that mr.khan ji is facing a trouble although he is a scholar and even after getting an appointment.

  

Taking his scholarship into consideration if any foreign university offers him the job as a faculty in the same subject that may resolve the issue.

  

Even he gets a respect from inside India because of representing Indian sastra outside the country.



If possible please someone do it.

If any wrong words from my side please pardon me.

  

Thank you.
