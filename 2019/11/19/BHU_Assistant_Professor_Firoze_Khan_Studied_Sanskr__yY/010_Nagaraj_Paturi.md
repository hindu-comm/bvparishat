For those who might want to know, SVDV is Sanskrit Vidyaa Dharma Vijnan.

  

This is the name of a School / Faculty .

  

School/Faculty is a group of departments.

  

SVDV, Sanskrit Vidyaa Dharma Vijnan.is a School /Faculty that claims itself to be committed to the study of Shast4as like Dharma Shastras, Aagamas and Tantras through Shaastric methods. Dharma Vijnan translates into religious science.

The Saahitya department to which the appointment in question is made, is part of SVDV.

  

The argument being made against this appointment is that the nature of this department is in consonance with that of SVDV of which it is a part.

  

There is a separàte department of Sanskrit under Faculty of Arts which does not share the ethos of SVDV.

  

The protesters are arguing that they are not against transferring the appointed person to that department.
