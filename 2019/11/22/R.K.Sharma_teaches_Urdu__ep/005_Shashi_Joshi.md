Apart from specialised[vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary "Vocabulary"), spoken Urdu is[mutually intelligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_intelligible "Mutually intelligible")with[Standard Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), another recognised register of Hindustani. The Urdu variant of Hindustani received recognition and patronage under[British rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj")when the[British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom")replaced the local official languages with English and Hindustani written in[Nastaʿlīq script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasta%CA%BFl%C4%ABq_script "Nastaʿlīq script"), as the official language in[North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India "North India")and[Northwestern India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_India "Northwestern India").^([\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-16)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-18))

  

Urdu, like[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), is a form of[Hindustani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_language "Hindustani language").^([\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-22)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-23)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-Qalamdaar2010-24))Some linguists have suggested that the earliest forms of Urdu evolved from the medieval (6th to 13th century)[Apabhraṃśa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apabhra%E1%B9%83%C5%9Ba "Apabhraṃśa")register of the preceding[Shauraseni language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shauraseni_language "Shauraseni language"), a[Middle Indo-Aryan language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Indo-Aryan_languages "Middle Indo-Aryan languages")that is also the ancestor of other modern Indo-Aryan languages.^([\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-25))

In Northern India (what is historically known as the region of[Hindustan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan "Hindustan")),[Khariboli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khariboli "Khariboli")was the native language. It belongs to the[Western Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hindi "Western Hindi")language class of Central Indo-Aryan languages.^([\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-Taj-26)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-27))The Turko-Afghan[Delhi Sultanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate "Delhi Sultanate")established Persian as its official language, a policy continued by the[Mughal Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire "Mughal Empire"), which extended over most of northern[South Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia "South Asia")from the 16th to 18th centuries and cemented[Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language "Persian language")influence on Hindustani.^([\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-28))

In cities such as Delhi, Khariboli began to acquire some Persian loanwords and continued to be called "Hindi" as well as "Urdu".^([\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-From_Hindi_to_Urdu:_A_Social_and_Political_History-29)[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-Taj-26)\[*[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute")–[discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Urdu#Dubious "Talk:Urdu")*\])From the 13th century until the end of the 18th century the language now known as Urdu was called*Hindi*,^([\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-From_Hindi_to_Urdu:_A_Social_and_Political_History-29)(p1))*Hindavi*,*Dehlavi*^([\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-From_Hindi_to_Urdu:_A_Social_and_Political_History-29)(pp21–22)), and*Lahori*.^([\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-30))By the end of the reign of[Aurangzeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb "Aurangzeb")in the early 18th century, the common language around Delhi began to be referred to as “Zaban-e-Urdu,”^([\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-31))a name derived from the[Turkic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages "Turkic languages")word*ordu*(army) or*orda*and is said to have arisen as the "language of the camp", or "*Zaban-i-Ordu*" (or natively "*Lashkari Zaban*"). The name*Urdu*was first used by the poet[Ghulam Hamadani Mushafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulam_Hamadani_Mushafi "Ghulam Hamadani Mushafi")around 1780.^([\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-32)[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-From_Hindi_to_Urdu:_A_Social_and_Political_History-29)(p18))As a literary language, Urdu took shape in courtly, elite settings.^([\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-Coatsworth2015-33)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-34))  

  

  

  

While Urdu retained the grammar and core vocabulary of the local Hindi dialect Khariboli, it adopted the[Nastaleeq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastaleeq "Nastaleeq")writing system^([\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-Taj-26))– which was develop as a style of Persian calligraphy.^([\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-35))Hindustani in Persian script was used by Muslims and Hindus, but was current chiefly in Muslim-influenced society.^([\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-mcgregor_912-36))Urdu replaced[Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language_in_South_Asia "Persian language in South Asia")as the official language in 1835 and was made co-official, along with English.^([\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-37))Urdu, which was often referred to by the British as “Hindustani,”^([\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-38))was promoted in British India by British policies to counter the previous emphasis on Persian.^([\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-39))This triggered a Hindu backlash in northwestern India, which argued that the language should be written in the native[Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari "Devanagari")script. This literary standard called "Hindi" replaced Urdu as the official language of[Bihar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar "Bihar")in 1881, establishing a sectarian divide of "Urdu" for Muslims and "Hindi" for Hindus, a divide that was formalised with the division of India and Pakistan after independence (though there are Hindu poets who continue to write in Urdu to this day, with post-independence examples including[Gopi Chand Narang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopi_Chand_Narang "Gopi Chand Narang")and[Gulzar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulzar "Gulzar")).  

  

  

  

Because of Urdu's similarity to[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), speakers of the two languages can easily understand one another if both sides refrain from using specialised vocabulary. The[syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax")(grammar),[morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics) "Morphology (linguistics)"), and the[core vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_vocabulary "Core vocabulary")are essentially identical. Thus linguists usually count them as one single language and contend that they are considered as two different languages for socio-political reasons.^([\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-49))

So basically Urdu was force adopted by Pakistan, like India should have adopted Sanskrit (or ended up adopting Hindi as national language - a unifying language)

  

  

Standard Urdu is often[contrasted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi#Standard_Hindi_and_Urdu "Hindi")with[Standard Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Hindi "Standard Hindi").^([\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-67))Apart from religious associations, the differences are largely restricted to the[standard forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_language "Standard language"): Standard Urdu is conventionally written in the[Nastaliq style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasta%CA%BFl%C4%ABq_script "Nastaʿlīq script")of the[Persian alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_alphabet "Persian alphabet")and relies heavily on Persian and Arabic as a source for technical and literary vocabulary,^([\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-Language_in_India-Bringing_Order_to_Linguistic_Diversity:_Language_Planning_in_the_British_Raj-68))whereas Standard Hindi is conventionally written in[Devanāgarī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari "Devanagari")and draws on[Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit").^([\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-Sikmirza-69))However, both have large numbers of Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit words, and most linguists consider them to be two standardised forms of the same language,^([\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-UC_Davis-Linguists-70)[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-Ethnologue_Report_for_Hindi-71))and consider the differences to be[sociolinguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolinguistics "Sociolinguistics"),^([\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-South_Asian_Voice-72))though a few classify them separately.^([\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-73))Old Urdu dictionaries also contain most of the Sanskrit words now present in Hindi.^([\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-74)[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu#cite_note-75))Mutual intelligibility decreases in literary and specialised contexts that rely on educated vocabulary. Further, it is quite easy in a longer conversation to distinguish differences in vocabulary and pronunciation of some Urdu[phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemes "Phonemes"). As a result of religious nationalism since the[partition of British India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India "Partition of India")and continued communal tensions, native speakers of both Hindi and Urdu frequently assert them to be distinct languages.
