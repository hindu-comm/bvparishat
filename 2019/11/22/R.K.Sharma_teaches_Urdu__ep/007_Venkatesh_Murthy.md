Namaste

  

I am not against Urdu language. But it is a pain to see people purposely using Persian and Arabic words in Hindi even when pure Hindi words are available to them. Example I gave was Sangeet. Why use Mausiqii word when Sangeet is available?

  

Kindly see the wikepedia article sentence -

  

Because of Urdu's similarity to[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), speakers of the two languages can easily understand one another if both sides refrain from using specialised vocabulary.
