How the media twists!!

1\. Urdu was born in India. Its sentence structure is Hindi. Only small vocab is Arabic/Persian.

  

2\. Urdu has nothing to do with religion.

  

3\. He teaches in Arts dept, where as Khan was being posted in religious studies dharma vigyan. Sharma is not teaching Koran or interpreting it.

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
