Sri Venkatesh Murthy-ji,

  

Sri Shashi Joshi-ji is absolutely correct in his above mentioned statement.

  

1\. Urdu and Hindi have different vocabulary not different sentence structure. Languages differing only in vocabulary, not in the sentence structure are quite often considered not as different languages. On that count , Urdu and Hindi are often not considered as two different languages.

  

2\. Urdu is not the language of Islam. That is, there is no one to one relationship between Urdu and Islam.

3\. It is anti-national to use the word anti-national at the drop of a hat even where it is not applicable.

  

4\. Not only certain versions of Hindi, most of the Indian languages have dialects which are characterizedby a big ratio of Arabic and Persian words.

  

5\. Sanskrit and Dhaarmic religious traditions have a one to one relationship, unlike Urdu and Islam.

  

6\. Studying Sanskrit , learning Sanskrit, speaking Sanskrit, studying about Dharma in Sanskrit books do not require allegiance to Dharma. Training people in Dharma requires allegiance to Dharma on the part of the trainer.

  

7\. Similarly training people in Islamic religion requires allegiance to Islamic religion on the part of the trainer.Studying Arabic , learning Arabic, speaking Arabic, studying about Islam in Arabic books do not require allegiance to Islam.

  

8\. Studying and teaching Urdu, in any case, is not the same as studying and teaching Arabic.
