This is not correct. A large vocabulary of Urdu is from Persian andArabic. I think if there is a choice they will always use Persian and Arabic words but not Sanskrit Tatsama and Tadbhava words. Example - They will avoid Sangeet word and say Mausiqii for music.

  

Now big problem is created by TV Media Channels. They are using more and more Urdu words in Hindi. If this continues the whole country will have to listen to only Urdu news and not Hindi news. I think only Doordarshan is using pure Hindi words.

  

The pseudo secular journalists have the courage to suggest PM Modi should use less and less Sanskrit words in his speeches.

But using Urdu words purposely in Hindi is a bad practice. It means they want to Arabise Hindi as much as possible. It may not be religious but it is anti-national because pure Hindi words preserve and protect our culture more than Arabic and Persian words. Thry

  

I am very surprised why they teach Urdu in BHU. It should be banned.

  

If you go to Israel the official language is Hebrew and though they are living in the middle of Arab nations they protect the Hebrew language. Not bringing in Arabic and Persian words like our TV journalists.
