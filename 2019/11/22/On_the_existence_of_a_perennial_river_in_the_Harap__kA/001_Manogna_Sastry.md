Thank you for sharing this Megh.

  

If I may add a paper to this, it would be the 2016 paper *Geochemistryof buried river sediments from Ghaggar Plains, NW India: Multi-proxy records of variations in provenance, paleoclimate, and paleovegetation patterns in the Late Quaternary* which also contains extensive analysis of the sediment of the basin, to add to the increasing body of evidence the ancient Sarasvati indeed did originate in the Higher Himalayas. It is also interesting from the point of view, of having a paper which used geological age prior to the addition of the Meghalayan, to make a comparison of the potential age of the sediments, with that of today's paper.

  

Regards,

Manogna
