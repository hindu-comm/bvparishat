Thank you very much, Shankaraji, first for the BORI link and then the archive link to Dvaitanirnayasiddhantasangraha.

  

Many thanks to Prof. Madhav Deshpande for providing the link to the scanned manuscript of Dharmadvaitanirnaya.

  

Also, thanks to other members of this group for their helpful comments.

  

This book, so far as I know, deals with deontic issues in the Dharmasastras and offers solutions based on Mimamsa principles. The word 'dvaita' refers to counter-rules, conflicting situations, etc.

  

Best regards,
