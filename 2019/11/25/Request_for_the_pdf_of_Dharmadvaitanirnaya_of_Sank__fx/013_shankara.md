Sir,

  

I provided the link to'Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Dharmasastras' only because that was the only book available in Google search for the term 'dharma-dvaita-nirnaya'. I don't know much about its author. But, I too have noticed that his books are full of plagiarised content.   

  

For instance, his 'Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas' in 5 vols is almost a copy of 'Puranic Encyclopedia' by Vettom Mani.  

  

regards  
shankara
