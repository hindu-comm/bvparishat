My curiosity was based on the use of this word 'Dharmaadvaita' by a 13th century by the legendary classical Telugu poet who authored the most part of the classical Telugu Mahabharata which is a transcreation of Vyasa's Mahabharata. (The other two authors being Nannaya earlier to him, the 11th century one and Errana, later to him, the 14th century one. Nannaya authored the first 21/2 parvas, Tikkana, the last 15 parvas Errana, the remainder of the third parva)

  

Tikkana in the avataarika = preface/introduction to his part of Mahabharata composition, says Vyasa authored Mahabharata while being absorbed in 'Dharmaadvaitasthiti' .

  

What he meant by this word has not been interpreted satisfactorily till now (like many such expressions of those times).

  

I thought the details of this book might help resolve the issue of interpretation of this intriguing expression.

  

From the details provided by Shankara-ji, the issue of

  

"the pros and cons of prohibited transactions such as gifting to someone a property which was promised to someone else."

  

matches with the topic of Mahabharata.

  

There seems to be a history of the usage of this expression, not to be brushed aside just like that.
