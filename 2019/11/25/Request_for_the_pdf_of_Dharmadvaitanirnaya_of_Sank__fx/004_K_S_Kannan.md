Dear Shankara,

The link you give takes us to an interesting work,

but it is also followed by a caution, which I hope is not prejudiced:

9 August 2019

Format: HardcoverVerified Purchase

This is a spurious book without details about the Editor, Contributors, Footnotes, Sources, or Bibliography. I strongly suspect this poor product is a copy-paste compilation from different web sources without acknowledging intellectual debt. So plagiarism at its worst. But not worth the money one pays. Very poorly organized and badly edited. When a bunch of college dropouts try to make quick bucks such trash gets published and sold even on Amazon. Now I know you have no one on board to tell you what is a book and what is not!

  

But that is by no means to say your info is not valid.  

Only sorry, how people, here the author of the ency., lose credibility by their flippancy.
