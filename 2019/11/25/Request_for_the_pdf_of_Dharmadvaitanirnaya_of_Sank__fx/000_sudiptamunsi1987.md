Dear Scholars,  
  
I am looking for the pdf of a text called Dharmadvaitanirnaya, authored by Sankarabhatta. The text was edited by J. R. Gharpure and published in the Hindu Law Texts series from Bombay in 1943.  
  
Any help in this regard would be most welcome.  
  
Thanks in advance.  
  
Best regards,  
Yours sincerely  
  
Sudipta Munsi
