Going by the description of the book as........Alternatives solved....etc. it appears to me that the book is about the vikalpa-s, alternatives, available in the shaastra to the performing of an action. One example is : उदिते जुहोति, अनुदिते जुहोति. This is an analogy in the Purvamimamsa, though. In day to day conduct of our affairs, we are sometimes faced with two or more alternatives and find it difficult to choose one and leave the other/s. If we get to see some contents of the book, maybe some more clarity can be had.
