Thank you, Shankara Ji, for finding this commemoration volume. MM DV Potdar was a very prominent scholar in Pune during my school/college days. I remember him presiding over a function to celebrate students who had earned prizes in the SSC exam \[including me winning the Jagannath ShankershetSanskrit Scholarship in 1962\], and I especially remember his extempore speech in Sanskrit. There was some occasion when I had to go and see him at his home, which was not too far from where I grew up. As a friend of my grand-father, Potdar gave him a copy of his book "मराठी गद्याचा इंग्रजी अवतार" discussing the appearance of Marathi prose works during the early British period, and I have this signed copy. Thanks onceagain.
