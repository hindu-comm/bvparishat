Conclusion

The process of analyzing and interpreting the sacred works of*śāstra*and Sanskrit literature is multi-layered. A thorough knowledge of the wider set of*grantha*s, along with the know-how of the various instruments of interpretation is very essential.*Bhāṣā*,*rīti*, and*bheda*are some of the useful tools in this journey. One cannot interpret or teach*śāstra*with just the knowledge of language. A lifelong indulgence in the practice of*Sanātana**Dharma*is critical for success in any such endeavor.
