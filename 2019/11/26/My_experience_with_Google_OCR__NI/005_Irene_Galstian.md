"How to do 25 pages at a time":

  

Here's a simple manual procedure any person can do.

Take your PDF and divide it into 25-page PDFs using either your own software or online services. Upload these to Google Drive. When uploaded, right-click on a 25-page PDF, choose 'open with Google Docs'.

Google Docs opens in another tab, and OCR happens automatically. Then you can download your OCR'd text as a .docx file, for example, for proofreading and other things.
