The OCR thread has becoming very large. Let me jot down my experience with Google OCR which I used for digitization of Sanskrit lexica.

  

1\. I wrote a script to split larger PDF into 25 pages PDFs.

2\. I upload it to Google Drive.

3\. On icon, right click and select 'Open with - Google Docs'.

4\. Google does the OCR and shows the result on screen. (Typical time lag is 1-2 minutes)

5\. I copy paste in a .txt file the OCRed data.

  

Advantages -

  

1\. I did some time analysis. Some of the scans did not allow Google OCR. So I had to get it manually typed. Typical time spent is 1:3 for OCR proof reading : De novo typing.

So yes, the OCR speeds up digitization at least by a factor of 3.

  

2\. Even if the OCR text is dirty, it helps ond to identify the passages in a given work. In one of my queries, a dirty OCR gave me a match for my query of unknown quotation. If that particular book was not scanned, there is no chance that I can exoect that Anatomy and Embryology are thoroughly discussed in Sangitaratnakara.

  

Disadvantages -

  

1\. Google OCR is bad when it comes to watermarked PDFs. It only identifies the watermark, and no other text.
