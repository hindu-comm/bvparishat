The conference is indefinitely postponed on account of underwhelming quantity and quality of papers received.

  

IGUC of Indic Academy considers this as a learning experience regarding the state of academics among Indic scholars in this crucial area of Indic traditions, cultures and knowledge systems.

  

While there seems to be a widespread of spirit of agreement with the centrality and significance of environmentalist aspects in Indic traditions, cultures and knowledge systems, there seems to be a bad need of developing this spirit into rigorous academic articulation and argument building , research and research paper preparation , dissertation writing etc.

  

IGUC of Indic Academy shall take it upon itself to work towards fulfilling this need through workshops, online courses etc. that may culminate towards a successful conference as planned now.
