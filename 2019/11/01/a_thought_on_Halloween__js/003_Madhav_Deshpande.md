As we speak, children in our neighborhood are coming to our door to get candy for Halloween. Our grandchildren are going in their own neighborhoods. For those who may not be familiar, the children say "Trick orTreat," meaning "give me a treat or I will play a trick on you." As it is practised in the US, this is a non-religious festival in which every family, irrespective of religion or ethnicity, participates. The children are very excited about getting dressed up like some animal or an astronaut or something, and the parents spend days preparing these outfits for their children. The schools also host Halloween parties for their students, and adults have their own Halloween parties. This is for pure fun. Lighted up carved pumpkins are placed at the entrances of homes, like Diwali lanterns in India.
Here are the carved pumpkin lights in front of our house at this time.
