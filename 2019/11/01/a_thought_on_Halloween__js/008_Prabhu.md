Interestingly कूष्माण्ड (कुष्माण्ड) means both pumpkin as well as a ghost/goblin.  
  
From kathAsaritsAgara:  
यक्षवेताल \_कूष्माण्ड\_ डाकिनीराक्षसादयः  
न तत्र प्रभविष्यन्ति यत्रैषा कीर्तयिष्यते //  
  
Also  
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack-o%27-lantern>  
  
“  
By those who made them, the lanterns were said to represent either spirits or supernatural beings,\[10\] or were used to ward off evil spirits.\[11\] For example, sometimes they were used by Halloween participants to frighten people,\[11\]\[12\]\[13\] and sometimes they were set on windowsills to keep harmful spirits out of one's home.\[12\] It has also been suggested that the jack-o'-lanterns originally represented Christian souls in purgatory, as Halloween is the eve of All Saints' Day (1 November)/All Souls' Day (2 November).\[14\]
