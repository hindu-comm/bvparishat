Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy-ji,

  

There is no similarity between the 'trick' of the 'trick or treat' and 'stealing' of the Holi/ Kamotsava in some parts of India or 'stealing' of Pangal / Makara Sankranti/ Bhogi festival in the Telugu speaking areas. 'Stealing' of the Holi/ Kamotsava in some parts of India or 'stealing' of Pangal / Makara Sankranti/ Bhogi festival in the Telugu speaking areas has nothing to do with taskaraaNaam pataye part of Rudra prasna.

  

'Trick' of 'Trick or Treat' has got to do with magical trick and /or (magic trick of) change of form. The tricks are believed / expected to be scary / creepy and are expected to be avoided by giving a treat.

  

There is no such fun-threatening / fun-blackmailing involved in the
'stealing' of the Holi/ Kamotsava in some parts of India or 'stealing' of Pangal / Makara Sankranti/ Bhogi festival in the Telugu speaking areas.

  

The 'stealing' of the Holi/ Kamotsava in some parts of India has got to do with fun and reveling through freaking out. But the 'stealing' or 'objects stolen' have their origin in burning the fall leaves and worn out stuff of s'is'ira ritu as part of welcoming vasanta ritu. Its a kind of forced helping in the end of the 9seasonal) year cleansing , enjoying the yelling by the forced neighbor. Such forced affections were part of Indian rustic community collectivism.

  

The fun-threatening / fun-blackmailing in the 'trick' of the 'trick or treat' can be compared to the fun-threatening / fun-blackmailing by folk -magician-artists folk scary guise artists who used to perform in front of houses or in street corners and used to ask for patronage / rewards (which is mistaken for 'begging' by culturally uprooted modern Indian onlookers) through fun-threatening / fun-blackmailing.

  

Secularizing or desacralizing the pagan traditions such as Halloween is the biggest threat faced by these traditions during modern times. Such
Secularizing or desacralizing is what changed the fertility ritual festivals such as Gorbha, daaNDiyaa etc. into partying performances and allowed replacement of sacred songs and dances with erotic DJ compositions. Batukamma festival of Telangana is in the beginning stages of such a transformation into DJ controlled partying dance. Incidentally Batukamma festival is similar to Gorbha, daaNDiyaa in being a fertility ritual festival.
