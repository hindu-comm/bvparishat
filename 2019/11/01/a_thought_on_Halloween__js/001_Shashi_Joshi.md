There is a lot to be said about Halloween, its origins, its later assimilation into Christianity.

This wiki link captures a lot -<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween>

Please read the whole article at leisure, and note a few things:

  

\- this day has roots in Celtic **harvest** (Diwali?)festival Samhain ( before Christianity)

\- It was also a day to remember the dead ancestors - shrAddha pakSha?

\- It marked the end of summer and start of winter (junction of light and dark, life and death)

\- Jack-o-lantern is like a trishanku (admitted not in heaven, nor in hell)

  

Like many other festivals and rituals, church assimilated it as well, by shifting its date of Saints day to Nov 1. They also converted old wise women (wiccan) to witches, which are ridiculed and hated to this day.

The current practices, scary disguises etc are only a few centuries old, and not part of the original festival.

  

  

  
  

Thanks,
