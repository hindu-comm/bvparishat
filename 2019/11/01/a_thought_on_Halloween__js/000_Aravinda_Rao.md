This morning I got a whats app message from my daughter showing how her sons wore some fancy dress, went round the houses and got a bunch of chocolates.

  

In our boyhood we used to do bhikshatan in the month of Shravan. This appears to be a vestige of the old practice of bhikshatan by the brahmachari-s. The young boy, newly elevated to the stage of brahmachari used to start his veda-adhyayan after the full moon day of Shravan. We are aware of the ceremony called upakarma, From that day, he was expected to do bhikshatan and live in the gurukulam.

  

Halloween, naturally, seems to be a similar practice, now done purposelessly.
