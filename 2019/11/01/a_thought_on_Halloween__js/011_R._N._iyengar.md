कूष्माण्ड / कूश्माण्ड appears in the Atharva veda parisishta as celestial objects 27 in number moving south. Most likely a meteor shower of considerable brightness. All these are associated with Daksha-yajna and naturally as the ferocious troupes following Shiva. The text says  

 कूश्माण्डवत्but this is taken in other literature as "name or notation for particular deities"  

(AVParis_52,11.5-12.1.5)

rāhuḥ somaḥ śanaiścaro bṛhaspatibudhau tathā/ aindra āgneyo yāmyaś ca nairṛtovāruṇas tathā \|\|  
vāyavyaś caiva saumyaś ca brāhmaś caivāṣṭamo grahaḥ/ navamaś caiva vijñeyodhūmaketur mahāgrahaḥ \|\|  
yugagrahā na cānye te tatrāṣṭau diggrahāḥ smṛtāḥ/ sanakṣatreṣu mārgeṣudṛśyante tu yugagrahāḥ \|\|  
vibhrāntamaṇḍalāḥ śeṣā dṛśyante khacarā grahaḥ/ mṛtyor niśvāsajāś cānyejñeyāḥ ṣoḍaśa ketavaḥ \|\|  
kūṣmāṇḍavad visaṃchannas triṇavā dakṣiṇe pathi/ ekādaśaiva vijñeyādvādaśādityasaṃbhavāḥ \|\|  
sūryavarcanirīkṣās te tejodhātumayā grahāḥ/ dakṣayajñe tu rudrasya krodhādanye tu niḥsṛtāḥ \|\|

  

 Yadavaprakasha author of his famous Vaijayanti kosha lists कूश्माण्ड among the names of rudragaNa in Svargakanda, Adidevaadhyaaya. I take this to be significant in understanding ancient sky pictures.

Maruts and Ketus (along with Rahu) were most likely the PUrvadevAh; all celestial objects/apparitions as per present understanding. As Upanishadic world view gained prominence, all the above were treated as forms of Brahman only, without denying them their Devata status, nor their physical form.
