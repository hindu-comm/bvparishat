Thank you Prabhu.

  

Having read this sloka relating to Betala and Kushmanda, and similarity to Halloween, the following thought occurs to me.

  

Is there any truth in the existence of creatures or spirits described as Jakhya, betala, asura and deva and daitya?

  

One conclusion may be all of them existed and even exist today but in orthogonal spaces.

Also out of different types of manabas only the type of humans we see today survived, others fell prey to the dharma of time.

  

Of Course, another answer is that these are differences in the nature of humans with and without their bodies.

  

Deva
