I think it is in the fourth sarga of the Shishupalavadha,while describing the Raivataka mountain. The verse starts with: दृष्टोपि शैलः स मुहुर्मुरारेः अपूर्ववत् विस्मयमाततान, क्षणे क्षणे [etc.us](http://etc.us) the second line.

  

Kindly correct,if necessary,as this is based in my memory.

  

Thanks and regards.
