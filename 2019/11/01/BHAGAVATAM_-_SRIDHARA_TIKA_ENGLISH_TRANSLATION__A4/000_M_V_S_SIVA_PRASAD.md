 RESPECTED SCHOLARS,

 IS THERE EXISTS ANY TRANSLATION OF THE SRIDHARIYA VYAKHYA OF BHAGAVATAM IN ENGLISH .  

IF EXISTS PLEASE TELL ME THE DETAILS OF THE PUBLISHER

OR

IF AVAILABLE IN PDF FILES YOU ARE REQUESTED TO PLACE THE LINKS OF PDFS ALSO.

  

I KNOW THAT THERE EXISTS BOTH HINDI AND GUJARATI TRANSLATIONS OF SRIDHARI VYAKHYA BUT SEARCHING FOR ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS.  

  

AS I KNOW THERE EXISTS ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF SUBODHINI VYAKHYA BUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF SRIDHARIYA VYAKHYA OF BHAGAVATAM.

  

SO YOU ARE REQUESTED TO PROVIDE ME THE INFORMATION  

  

THANK YOU
