Namaste Shashi ji



1. You have a focused question and you are aware of the intricacies also. You are now exploring the issue as 'Curiosity- Why' question.

Here below is my response point wise, not resorting to a long e-mail !



2a) *My query is regarding, why bhakta (bhaktaH = devotee, bhaktam = divided) could have these two very different meaning? What is the 'holistic reasoning' for these two meanings?*

* Any one of them can be taken as the real/root/base meaning (which in this case happens to be bhaj = to worship), then how does the other meaning come up? Specifically - divide. *

*^^^^^^^^^^^^^ *

**BVK Sastry on (2a)** : The common root ' bhaj' gets different meanings by 'pratyaya-prakriyaa' as per panini. The debate is noton the meaning of the root. The meaning of outcome from the process and affix added is the reason for different communications.

The four Panini sutras explain why there is a difference in the meaning of final output. This is not to rule out ' multiple meanings associated with one verb stem. Classical answer for the question would be to invoke 'dhatoonaaam anekaarthatvaat'. I would take one step outside of this and say this multi-valence is from Nirukta perspective to explain Vyakarana. It is NOT variance. It is one root- many branches and fruits model. WHY -is it so ? niruktakara attributes it to the level of consciousness of visioning meaning of roots. Modern schools have their linguistic models.

MW reference to Panini ( 4-2-54) does not get connected to the well known meaning or derivation of the term bhakta;

*-------------------------------*

**

*2b) And then related words -*

1. *bhaktaH = devotee , from bhaj = worship. No issues*

2. *bhakti - devotion. Okay*

3. *bhaktam - divided. How?*

4. *vibhakti - ?? WHat roles does vi- play? Is the meaning of bhakt here that of worship or divide? Is it divider of the types of shabdaroopa?*

5. *vibhajana - from bhaktam. okay from bhaktam = divided.*

*^^^^^^^^^^^^^ *

**BVK Sastry on (2b)** : Vibhakti is a technical undivided term in vyakarana. Panini 1-4-104. This means the split of vibhakti as vi-bhakti is not accepted. The role of vi as a upasarga is not envisaged here.

vibhaajana is a further processed term; and process modifies the meaning.

bhaktam is menaing due to the pratyaya added, rule noted above.



*-------------------------------*



2c) So, if we assume that bhaj = divide is the first/root/main/core meaning, then how does the meaning of devotee get attached to it? **I am not talking grammar, but how does such a very different meaning got attached? Is there a holistic connection? **



\[ An example of holistic connection is e.g. between bhuj = to eat, and bhujaH = arm, because one uses the arm to eat.

Even bhuj = 'to eat', and bhuj = 'to curve and bend' is connected, the arm bends at various places, even as we eat\]



If we assume that bhaj = worship is the first/root/main/core meaning, then how did the meaning of 'divide' get attached to it?



And if we assume that these two meanings are independently root/main/core meanings, then why is it so?

Why would a people choose same root to denote so varied unconnected meaning. Not even different gaNa.

*^^^^^^^^^^^^^ *

**BVK Sastry on (2c)** : If we are not talking of grammar, i have nothing to add. The debate on meaning (=artha) association of term with base term (Prakruti / Samjnaa/ praatipadika / ) is totally different from the debate on meaning extraction ( padaartha - nirukti) from a ' pada' which has a ( Prakruti-Pratyaya unification through a prakriyaa niyama).



Your illustration on ' bhuja' does not fall in to this model. No assumptions.

If ' holistic connection is to be debated, one needs to go to 'Shakti-vaada' : How a pada is associated with artha: and it goes far beyond the scope of this discussion and vyakarana.

*-------------------------------*





2d) I could of course consider the 'This is how it is, take it or leave it', then there won't be any discussions in life. There will be no curiosity left in life.

*^^^^^^^^^^^^^ *

**BVK Sastry on (2d)** : For curiosity pursuit, there are many more avenues; and you have made your choice.

*-------------------------------*



2e) Regarding my bringing in the word 'vi-bhakti', I know what the term means in grammar, but why is the word (vi)bhakti used to mean - 'dividing the kAraka'? bhakti only means devotion. But vibhakti is used to 

mean vibhAjana. I was not confusing it with any Gita shloka.

*^^^^^^^^^^^^^ *

**BVK Sastry on (2e)** : You are questioning an axiomatic technical term defined in Vyakarana- Panini 1-4-104. . Only Panini may be able to answer it; our thinking is only an inference, guess at best.

*-------------------------------*



2f ) So, I would request to dwell on the query and not the other implications (those could be other threads). And, no, I don't need any examples of how bhakta is used ( received few mails regarding that, thank you) I know the meaning of bhakta, both as divided and as devotee. But why is it so, that is my question.

*^^^^^^^^^^^^^ *

**BVK Sastry on (2f)** : The response was on the inappropriateness noticed in the reference quoted. Corruption in dictionary as lexicon entry with usage association hits vyakarana, kosha and kavya, all at once.

*-------------------------------*



**2g) It is easy to mis-read written words based on our own mood and bias/background, rather than what the writer may have intended.** And easier to type a long email putting forth what we are thinking.



 Rather than what the question is all about.

*^^^^^^^^^^^^^ *

**BVK Sastry on (2g)** : Hope point wise response meets your need; and also recognize why the issue was marked as a ' storm brewing in the tea cup'.

*-------------------------------*



2h) So, I clarify, I am asking why the same root verb dhAtu *bhaj* could have two very different unconnected meanings? Is there a known rationale? Do people have a view on it?

I hope such discussion will not cause the collapse of the Sanskrit language, but only make it more interesting and alive. :) :)



*^^^^^^^^^^^^^ *

**BVK Sastry on (2h)** : Explained above. Such discussion would certainly be worth, only if the intention is to understand why Panini discipline is called 'Vedanga, Pada-shaastra, Vak-yoga shaastra, Shabda-brahma darshana shaastra' - all put together. The discussion pushed off track by 'models of assumptions' and 'what if's like the example of ' bhaj- bhuj will surely be entertaining (vinoda-karana) even if it does not lead to any better understanding of the technicalities of the discipline. I am sure the generation of 80's to 2000's would have seen many such debates cross linking 'similar sounding terms' and offering explanations of creative thinking. The linguists called oakish ! ( Who is Oak ?What was the method ? - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._N._Oak> ).

Sastry ji (and others as well)

I appreciate your point that the online resource is 'revised and enlarged'. But that is not the point here.

Let me explain why.



From any Sanskrit dictionary we know that bhakta has at least two meanings - 1) divided, and 2) devotee.



That is all I am basing my post and query on.

This doesn't get changed by the fact whether the website is revised or whether I look at the print copy of the dictionary, which I have.



I was **not** referringto the usage examples in the online Apte link.



My query in the original post was thus: (I quote from the first post):

6. *bhaktaH = devotee , from bhaj = worship. No issues*

7. *bhakti - devotion. Okay*

8. *bhaktam - divided. How?*

9. *vibhakti - ?? WHat roles does vi- play? Is the meaning of bhakt here that of worship or divide? Is it divider of the types of shabdaroopa?*

10. *vibhajana - from bhaktam. okay from bhaktam = divided.*
