Respected members,

I greatly appreciate the help I have got with my previous queries.

  

I have had another query, this time about 'bhakta'.

I searched the BVP group for any previous discussion, and could not find any.

  

Apte's dictionary has this entry:

> 
> > भक्त bhakta भक्त*p. p.*\[भज्-क्त\]**1**Distributed, allotted, > assigned; वामहस्ताहृतं चान्नं भक्तं पर्युषितं च यत् > Mb.12.36.31.**-2**Divided.**-3**Served, worshipped.**-4**Engaged > in, attentive to.**-5**Attached or devoted to, loyal, faithful; > मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु Bg.9.34.**-6**Dressed, > cooked (as food).**-7**Forming a part of, belonging > to.**-8**Loved, liked (at the end of comp.).**-क्तः**A worshipper, > adorer, devotee, votary, faithful attendant; भक्तो$सि मे सखा चेति > Bg.4.3;7.23;9.31; भक्तानां त्रिविधानां च लक्षणं श्रूयतामिति । > तृणशय्यारतो भक्तो मन्नाम- गुणकीर्तिषु । मनो निवेशयेत् त्यक्त्वा > संसारसुखकारणम् ॥ Brav. P.**-क्तम् 1**A share, portion.
> > 

  

My query is regarding, why bhakta (bhaktaH = devotee, bhaktam = divided) could have these two very different meaning?

What is the 'holistic reasoning' for these two meanings?

Any one of them can be taken as the real/root/base meaning (which in this case happens to be bhaj = to worship), then how does the other meaning come up?

  

Specifically - divide.

And then related words -

1.  
2.  bhaktaH = devotee , from bhaj = worship. No issues 3.  bhakti - devotion. Okay 4.  bhaktam - divided. How?  
5.  vibhakti - ?? WHat roles does vi- play? Is the meaning of bhakt here
    that of worship or divide? Is it divider of the types of
    shabdaroopa? 6.  vibhajana - from bhaktam. okay from bhaktam = divided.

  

I have an inner feeling of how bhaktaH and bhaktam (worshiper, and divided) can be connected, but that is not on grammatical basis. I think that as long as the devotee sees bhagavAn as different (divided, dvaita) the devotee is bhakta (divided). The aim of true bhakti would then be to remove the bhakta and merge it with the bhagvAn. Till the division (perceived difference of me and It) remains, bhaktaH and bhakti will remain, and the work is not done yet.

  

I know it is not with grammatical basis.

And I also think I am wrong in deriving this as the basis for the two meanings, because:

the two usages of the word must have developed independently. I mean, it is not as if after bhaktam = divided was established, the bhaktaH = worshiper was coined or used. Or vice versa.

  

I would love be to enlightened in this matter.

  

I inquire with full shraddhA, as always.

But shraddhA doesn't exclude questioning.  

\[ I will start another thread on the meaning of shraddhA itself :) \]

  

  

  
  

Thanks,
