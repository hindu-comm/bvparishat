The Srimad Bhagavata tells us that scriptures, the Vedas themselves, become dumb and incapable of putting into form and shape the might and majesty and glory of the internal relation that God maintains with His devotee:aham bhakta paradhinaha(S.B. 9.4.36). This is a statement which God can make and man cannot understand: I am dependent on my devotee. Aham bhakta paradhinaha, says Narayana. Why should He be dependent on the*bhakta?*This is capable of being understood as a metaphorical statement of the perpetual care that God takes of the soul that is in union with Him. But it is necessary for us to understand what it is to be in union with Him.
