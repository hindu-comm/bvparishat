Let me ask why the same root should not be used in different meaning whether it connected or not connect.

For a scholar, as I know it is confirmed by usage. For example, हन हिंसागत्योः root enlists two meaning to kill, and to go. But it is used with the meaning हिंसा only and never used with the other meaning. Likewise the root दृशिर् प्रेक्षणे is enlisted with only single meaning to see. But but is used figuratively to know as in English as in दर्शन, philosophy. Further you are referring to the root while you are saying you are not concerned about usage or grammar. If you are aware of the usage of prefixes, there is a saying how meaning of a root is changed with prefixes and this has been a topic in Nirukta.

उपसर्गेण धात्वर्थो बलादन्यत्र नीयते । प्रहाराहारसंहारविहारपरिहारवत् ॥  

धात्वर्थं बाधते कश्चित् कश्चित् तमनुवर्तते ।

विशिनष्टि तमेवार्थम् उपसर्गगतिस्रिधा ॥

You don't consider grammar, dictionary or convention and still asking question only why.

  

The same root भज is used two meaningsभज भागसेवयोः as confirmed by usage in शब्दकल्पद्रुम. You can decide which one was earlier or later yourself by examining chronology of earliest usage of the meaning. May not be a readymade answer yet.

  

The one historical dictionary byDr.A.M Ghatage and Dr. S.D.Joshi

An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Sanskrit on Historical Principles (Set of 12 Books)may find answer which records the date of usage.

  

But it is still not crossed the letter अ yet.
