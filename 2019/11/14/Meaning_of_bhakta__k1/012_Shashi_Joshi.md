Sastry ji (and others as well)

I appreciate your point that the online resource is 'revised and enlarged'. But that is not the point here.

Let me explain why.  

  

From any Sanskrit dictionary we know that bhakta has at least two meanings - 1) divided, and 2) devotee.

  

That is all I am basing my post and query on.

This doesn't get changed by the fact whether the website is revised or whether I look at the print copy of the dictionary, which I have.

  

I was **not** referringto the usage examples in the online Apte link.

  

My query in the original post was thus: (I quote from the first post):

1.  *bhaktaH = devotee , from bhaj = worship. No issues  
    * 2.  *bhakti - devotion. Okay* 3.  *bhaktam - divided. How?* 4.  *vibhakti - ?? WHat roles does vi- play? Is the meaning of bhakt
    here that of worship or divide? Is it divider of the types of
    shabdaroopa?* 5.  *vibhajana - from bhaktam. okay from bhaktam = divided.*

  

  

So, if we assume that bhaj = divide is the first/root/main/core meaning, then how does the meaning of devotee get attached to it? I am not talking grammar, but how does such a very different meaning got attached? Is there a holistic connection?

If we assume that bhaj = worship is the first/root/main/core meaning, then how did the meaning of 'divide' get attached to it?

  

And if we assume that these two meanings are independently root/main/core meanings, then why is it so?

Why would a people choose same root to denote so varied unconnected meaning. Not even different gaNa.

  

I could of course consider the 'This is how it is, take it or leave it', then there won't be any discussions in life.

There will be no curiosity left in life.

  

  

Regarding my bringing in the word 'vi-bhakti', I know what the term means in grammar, but why is the word (vi)bhakti used to mean - 'dividing the kAraka'?

bhakti only means devotion. But vibhakti is used to mean vibhAjana. I was not confusing it with any Gita shloka.

  

So, I would request to dwell on the query and not the other implications (those could be other threads).  

And, no, I don't need any examples of how bhakta is used ( received few mails regarding that, thank you)

I know the meaning of bhakta, both as divided and as devotee.

But why is it so, that is my question.

  

**It is easy to mis-read written words based on our own mood and bias/background, rather than what the writer may have intended.**

And easier to type a long email putting forth what we are thinking.

Rather than what the question is all about.

  

So, I clarify, I am asking why the same root verb dhAtu *bhaj* could have two very different unconnected meanings?

Is there a known rationale?

Do people have a view on it?

  

I hope such discussion will not cause the collapse of the Sanskrit language, but only make it more interesting and alive. :) :)

  

  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
