These meanings are there in all dictionaries.

See column 2 as well.

  

  

c) How and where from you did get these mixed up usage models and meaning connections ?  

Which ones do you mean by 'these mixed up usage models.?

The following is from Apte.

From other posts, i notice that you are in to computer programming; and you understand what happens if you use an inappropriate program to open
unsupported unintended file format ?  

  

==> I am not sure what you were driving at by the 'in to computer programming' part :)

My youth or immaturity :) or both!

  

  

My aim of the post was sincere discussion. If it has been discussed already in the group, a quick link would have sufficed. I searched but couldn't find any discussion on this topic.

  

I am sorry if I offended you in any way by thinking 'outside the box', but at times, we can't help our curiosity. And when unable to reach a convincing conclusion by oneself, one tends to post on groups and forums of wiser people! That is the whole idea of such forums! :) Even if one reaches a conclusion, it is sometimes good to get feedback from others to confirm.

  

Why is it that with passing time we have less and less patience to post to explain than to post to criticize or dismiss :)

  

  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
