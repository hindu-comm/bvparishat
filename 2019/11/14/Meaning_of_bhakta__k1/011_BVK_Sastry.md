Namaste



The issues in the womb of this discussion are likely to go to be extremely stormy with deeper implications on the Nature, reliability of Web resources being referred to understand 'Samskrutham' ! Pl. dont get me wrong. I am all for improving the quality of web resources and tools for Samskruth learning. But the tools and output should not become the ' Procrustean bed for Samskruth' invoking the idea in the term suggested by Prof. KSK.



No hurt intended for anybody . The only thing i wish is ' Let not the efforts to use the web tools end up in mercy killing of Samskruth language Traditional Standards invoking anesthesia of polysemy'. This will not only destroy the language, but also the message of Srimad Bhagavad-gita which one values most.





***1. A little background to understand why this note of caution at the beginning itself***: The query by \<shashi- Nov 14,2019> started with a seemingly simple question: \<another query, this time about 'bhakta'.>. The reference invoked was Apte's Dictionary entries , which showed \< usage illustrations from resources>. The illustrations showed multiple meaning construction possibilities; and seeming mistaken pointing towards \<Bhukta= consumed; Vi-Bhakti= Grammar technicality:: both being inappropriately ported towards the interpretation of a Gita passage>. This triggered the search to see whether Apte had quoted the original usage links in the first publication. My check on the web resources for Apte / Monier Williams and the print book confirmed that Apte and MW did NOT provide the Samskruth entries of usage for this term. Therefore, I was prompted to ask for the WEB source of the quote invoked by Shashi.



2***. The web quote invoked for 'Bhakta'***: Shashi's quote comes from the web resource :
<https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/apte_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4&searchhws=yes>



This is 'REVISED and ENLARGED EDITION' of ORIGINAL TEXT. There is a difference between the entries for BHAKTA in the print/web original and the 'REVISED and ENLARGED EDIITON'. The links on home page
<https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/> to know more about the project, the rationale and people behind the REVISION and UPDATES, the Stakeholders responsible for this leads to ' Page Not found ' message



The REVISED and ENLARGED EDITION has insertions of the 'USAGE points', which are INAPPROPRIATE' by CONTEXT, DERIVATION and UTILITY-USAGE.

That is making the 'REVISED AND ENLARGED Dictionary' work like a ' Meaning- Pool-Mall' , created at the discretion of 'EDITOR-REVISOR'
allowing the elements put together to lead to confusion. This updating seemingly helpful for research, is in reality a damage to the
Samskruth Learning- Researching pedagogy. This model of EDITING and REVISING Dictionary, without clear notes on who did this, why and how it affects/ benefits the end user is undoing what the Good by
Traditional systems with a human Teacher intervention using 'KOSHA - VYAKARANA- NIRUKTA- PRAYOGA' framework and technicalities to firm up the meaning of the term, without confusion.

Hope the issue will be seen at the larger perspective involved here, beyond the \< one more query>, \< an entry in the dictionary>. We can go on snowballing this debate for the one lakh plus word entries in Mw and other dictionaries, increasing the cyber bit exchanges. This should be more clear to the programmers on what happens when an effort is made to open a file with a wrong program ! Or with a corrupted program, unsupported Or when a free working program loses all support and goes obsolete !
