Very important thread by OP.

As I see it, Bhakti equates to - experience through all its dimensions; an experience that is a realization, quantum in nature. That's how "division" comes along.

Related words are bhakta, bhaj, bhuj, bhAjan, bhajana, bhoga, etc.

Words also, through vibhakti, becomes quanta of information, and "map out" the world.

The problem, then, is not with the science of Sanskrit ("how come this means that, or that means that", etc); the problem is the ideologies we find ourselves trapped in.

When someone says something is nirAkAra, that something is already quantised with the information bit, nirAkAra. There is already a division being made between things that have AkAra, and things that have not. We may as well define nirAkAra as "kuki" and say: somethings have kuki and others don't have kuki.

To many all this seems limiting, language looks limiting. Bhakti looks limiting. The reality is that bhakti is liberating, it's ideology that limits.

Bhakti liberates and civilisations are built upon it. Ideologies limit, and armies of slaves are built on it.

Bhakti says "realise the least known god of the pantheon and you will be liberated." Ideology, the hypocrisy, says "everything is One", and makes slaves (intentionally?) out of everyone.
