Dear Paturi Ji,

“May I request him to help us understand ?”

As you asked me as above, in this regard it is as follows:

What is meaning of Bhakta, -There are slokas or verses in the Bhagavadgita suited to every aspirant. There are different themes for abhaktaor devotee, ajnanin, and araja yogin.The Eleventh and Twelfth Chapters are meant for two types of devotees,paraandapara. Those who arepara bhaktaswill be able to enjoy the majesty of the Eleventh Chapter. We are notpara bhaktas, we are all small fry.

However, the very advanced type of devotion, which is the subject of the Eleventh Chapter.the minor conditions of bhakti are mentioned in the Twelfth Chapter.So my contention is meaning of the term bhakta depends on contexts. There are many meaning of the term. in upanisads(shveta.), gita, bhagavatam, and in many other texts. it depends on one that in which context he needs to know the meaning of the term 'bhakta'. Bhakta is also used in the sense of 'Dasa" meaning slave.Everyone—whether a seeker of Truth, a servant of God, a yogi, abhakta, a devotee, whatever one is—should be conscious of this fact. We seek liberation, but liberation from what? From what are we expecting liberation? This question one cannot easily answer. Liberation from what? From the bondage of life. What is the bondage of life? Let anyone answer this question. If life is a bondage, who will get oneself involved in the world?
