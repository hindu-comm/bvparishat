By saying,

  

I know it is not with grammatical basis.

And I also think I am wrong in deriving this as the basis for the two meanings, because:

the two usages of the word must have developed independently. I mean, it is not as if after bhaktam = divided was established, the bhaktaH = worshiper was coined or used. Or vice versa.

  

you have answered your questions yourself.

  

In polysemy, sometimes the different meanings are connected to each other through metaphor. Sometimesthe root word itself may have different origins or the root word itself may in fact be two different homophonous words.

  

bhaj = serve, love , worship

  

bhaj = share, experience, have, manifest  

  

bhaj = divide

  

could be three different homophonous roots.
