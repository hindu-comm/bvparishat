Namaste Shashi



You have referred to the citation of \< Apte's dictionary has this entry: \> for \< **भक्त** \> and scripted some \< usage>
illustrations.



My questions:



a) Can you please share the scan image reference of Aptes dictionary where these usages are listed as you have noted ?

 I have checked the online resources listed at
<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/> . The entry seems missing.

 I have checked the print book of Apte (Samnskrit English Dictionary : page 397) The print text does not give the usage you have indicated. 



b) There is an entry ' Bakti' - at <https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/work/fflexphp/web1/index.php>
referred to in Monier Williams. Featuring on print page 743 - Column-1.

The usages you are referring does not seem to be mentioned there also.



 c) How and where from you did get these mixed up usage models and meaning connections ? The root question is :What is your understanding of 'Meaning fixation of a Word said to belong to Language Class :Samskrutham'?



From other posts, i notice that you are in to computer programming; and you understand what happens if you use an inappropriate program to open
unsupported unintended file format ?
