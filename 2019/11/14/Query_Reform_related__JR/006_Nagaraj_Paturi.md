उद्धरण comes close to upliftment.

  

Reformists used words like women's liberation.

  

विमोचन comes close to liberation.

  

Full form of reform is 'social reform' . There is no equivalent word in premodern Sanskrit.

  

There are historical developments in premodern Indian society that are being viewed as 'social reformation'. Since the participants or 'agents' of those changes themselves did not view those developments from such a perspective , they did not use an equivalent word.
