Namaste Megh Kalyanasundaram,



You have triggered a loaded question for deliberation. The details below may not give an answer; but it will certainly highlight the root problem and legacy of 'Sanskrit-English Lexicon meaning-mapping'.



1. The English term 'reform' is mapped by Google- Hindi Translators to ' sudhaar'. Based on this ' Su-Dhaarak/ Sudhaaranaa' . This could be one line of vocabulary construction. Google-Telugu provides 'sam-skaraNa' as the output. But it is NOT that simple. Google does not hold all pervading authority on translation of technical terms.



2. The shades of meaning associated with the term REFORM varies depending on how it is used in a sentence.



1. REFORM ( as a VERB) : 1.make changes in (something, typically a social, political, or economic institution or practice) in order to improve it. "an opportunity to reform and restructure an antiquated schooling model" synonyms: improve · make better · better · ameliorate · refine · mend · rectify · correct ·

2. REFORM ( as a NOUN). : 1.the action or process of reforming an institution or practice. "the reform of the divorce laws".

synonyms: improvement · betterment · amelioration · refinement · rectification ·

3. REFORM ( as an ADJECTIVE) : (Reform) 1.of, denoting, or pertaining to Reform Judaism.



3. You seem to be looking for the specific shade of meaning \<
English word 'reform,' in the context of changes to a religious/way-of-life tradition/school-of-thought.>. The third line of interpretation seems to be matching to your query for seeking a Samskruth term.



4. The closest term i can think of for this is ' dharma-shaastra- aachara-niyama -parishkaara'. India has seen three hundred Dharma shaastrakaaras between classical Manu smriti to Dharma-sindhu/ Nirnaya Sindhu of late period. The text compilers of these 'Dharma-shaastra-Smruti' compilers/ guideline providers do address the ' changes to a religious/way-of-life tradition/school-of-thought'.



5. Whether they call themselves to be ' providers of shaastra- parishakaara or 'aachaara-parishakaara'- the term they would prefer to describe their effort and guidance, the first occurrence of such a term is to be sought.



In my limited understanding, the shaastrakaaras position themselves under ' Smruti' category who provide new ways of ' religion-ritual practice in a given context and society'. They position their guidance as ' samskaara- prayoga-paddhati'.



Would this fit the 'Reform model of Religion, like Judaism? I do not agree. Smrutikaaras align the society to an ancient Vedic Sanatana Dharma values, with a context relevant ritual performance guidance. In this sense, they are not iconoclasts or ' protestant '. They are true conformist-connection providers.



6. The ' academic freedom holding scholars' have interpreted such efforts as ' religion-revolt', and branded the shifts in Indian 'religion-society' as 'Religion-Revolt- movements opposing the oppressive brahminical hegemony'! The anchor of this movement is marked to start from the time of Buddha - Mahavira'! and continuing through
Basava, Kabir, all through Ambedkar et al. There are political, religious shades of shadows in interpretation. If this were to be so, how would one explain ' buddha becoming a part of Vishnu avataara' and worshipped throughout larger part of far eastern religions ? Specially Thailand ??



This is typical model of writing with ' a love to wear ' a lens of Religion-colonial framed and colored' and promote ' religion- translation vocabulary of Dharmic traditions' to explain poorly translated ' traditional texts of Samskrutham'.



If one looks back to trace a reference line for this shift, it seems to start with Monier Williams Dictionary. ( one may go back further in time line to other works in German and other resources. It is a work cut out for research projects). You may find in BVP archieves my views on this
theme calling for a review of MW dictionary.



7. If we now start with MW -English to Sanskrit to look for
reverse translation of the term ' REFORM', what comes out is the confusion. See below:

Link is <https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWEScan/2020/web/webtc/indexcaller.php> . The output is as below:



# reform

[TABLE]

8. Another dictionary provides the following:
<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/BORScan/2020/web/webtc/indexcaller.php>



[TABLE]

10. I hope these references are sufficient to evidence the deep mismatch of English terms to Samskruth terms through reverse translation in (!) different periods and flavors by (European, German and Indian scholars). Albeit all of them, honest, serious lifelong students of Sanskrit. The terms highlighted do not mean the same to the 'Sanskrit only traditionalist; certainly not the reform in the sense you have asked.



11. The sanskrit term mapping in above lexicons for ' reform' is totally misgiving, misleading, misguiding on what ' Sanatana -Vedic- Dharma-Shaastra- Smruti' sampradaya has held on the point of ' Time sensitive reforms and refinements, localization and customization of
Dharma Value anchored Vedic practices, coming from Shrauta and Gruhya sutras in Indian (more specifically Brahminical Traditional ) communities.



 If one just relies on the translations from dictionary with an academic freedom to pick the term of choice to make up one's own sandwich theories on ' Vedic Tradition' ignoring the tradition, the outcome will be socially devastating, as it has happened now.



12. What then would ' Samskruth Smruti teams' call the 'reformers' as you have sought ? This would be an interesting reverse translation exercise to pursue.

 If one falls out of the practice guidelines prescribed by 'Shaastra-Vidhi', the ritual would be called ' A-Shaastra vihitam Ghoram ...... ( Gita chapter 17 : Sloka 15 and 16 )' : they would be called **'aasura- nischaya'**. The historicity of term goes back to a few millennia.



 The ways of 'Shaastra', are therefore, taken as ' not written on stone'. The competence to modify and issue new guidelines of practice- compatibility was by standards of ' Acharya, Rushi, Guru / Kula-Purohita'. All these are ' reformers' in the sense of ' Dharma- aacahra - Abhyaasa- Vichaara- sampradaaya - sadaachaara - tradition'; but not in the sense of ' religion'. The 'Dharma-adhikaari' = authority to ensure compliant practice was a part of State administration, through the mechanism of 'Raja-Purhoita/ Dharma-amatya/ Mantri/ Kings commitment to Raja Dharma for Prajaa'. Cultural anthropologists may say all this as apologetic explanation.



 All this may not sound as ' emotionally soft and palatable. I cannot take responsibility to tinker / sanitize/ change Gita terms ! Nor the documented evidence in the lexicons above.
