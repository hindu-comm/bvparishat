I am not aware of any pre-13th century usage of the Sanskrit word in the sense of reform, but in 18th-19th century Marathi, we see the word सुधारणा used in the sense of reform and सुधारक used in the sense of reformer. The expressions सामाजिक सुधारणा and समाज-सुधारक become very common during this period.
