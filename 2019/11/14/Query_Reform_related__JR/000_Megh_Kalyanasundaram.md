Namaste,

  

I am looking for any pre-13th century CE (textually-attested) instance of usage of any Sanskrit (or any other Bhāratīya language) word that corresponds to the English word 'reform,' in the context of changes to a religious/way-of-life tradition/school-of-thought.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

Best,

Megh
