Thank you for sharing this.

  

It was in somewhat similar vein that I mentioned texts considered by some to be related to the life of (respected) Basava (who apparently self-identified himself as literate in all four Vedas).

  

It is of interest to me to examine the veracity of assertions that:

  

1) reduce the notion of 'reform' (roughly, 'makechanges in (something, especially an institution or practice) in order to improve it.') to, for instance, only Anglican Protestant notions of it

  

2\) there really was absolutely no attempt to make changes in order to improve a social institution or practice. Again, to be clear, I am not looking for Anglican Protestant notions of 'reform' alone.

  

Hence, any pre-15th century single-word or two-word description, in any Indian language, of someone describing an improvement (to a social practice, let us say, but not necessarily limited to that) is still very welcome.

  

Best,

Megh
