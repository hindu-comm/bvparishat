Dear Friends

Yes. The Sivadharma has been printed of which I do have a copy. The learned editor has to be congratulated for this effort and for bringing out this ancient and very valuable text along with a Hindi translation for the first time.  

But the edition, as stated by the editor in the Hindi 'preface', is based mainly on the manuscript from the Adyar Library with some occasional comparison with the Lingapurana, Hemadri's Chaturvargachintamani, etc. as stated by him. The variant readings are not clearly recorded.  

Since it is not a critical edition I am now working on it and have started the work with more manuscripts especially from Nepal, from the French Institute of Pondicherry manuscript collection and others. Consequently I find more variants and better readings available in these manuscripts.  

  

I am also glad to know that the Sivadharmottara also has been printed with the Hindi translation in the same series and format.

  

Best wishes

Ganesan
