Namaskar to all.

I would like to point out an important issue. Like most of our temples and dieties, Ram Lala is also treated as a jurisdic entity, a Perpetual Minor who can be handed over to another party if suspected mishandling by government. Somewhat like how Courts chose who the custodians of the Minor should be.

Also, Govt can allot land to other communinites, appoint random trustees and intervene in the management and funds. Whereas the 5 acre land given, is under Waqf Board where govt cannot do anything or interfere with.

There are many logical fallacies as well, in the decision which have been criticized openly by Pujya Shri Nishchalanandji Shankaracharya.

SC says, the other complex should be made "in a prominent place inside Ayodhya". What does prominent mean and why has it been inserted?

I am of the opinion, that any prominent person, some lawyer like Subranian Swamy, or a famous advocate/judge/Aacharya or Samiti should minutely analyse the judgement, write an elaborate criticism showcasing discontent and suggesting what would be more suitable for restoring mutual peace.

This is not for changing the judgement or expecting any change, but it will be recorded in history, that Hindus did object and proposed their side/point of view. If this remains Akhandya and Aviruddha, it will be considered as Happily Accepted.

Ruling Party cannot do it itself, but someone prominent should do it in writing, in form of such a document which would be recorded in History and considered as Primary Source of Historical Proof.

Namaskara.  
Rishi.
