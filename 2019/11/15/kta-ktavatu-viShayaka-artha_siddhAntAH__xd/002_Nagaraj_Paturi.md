Dear Sri Rishi Goswami-ji,

  

1\. One important observation I have with regard to this is that these gatavaan type forms have become frequent, almost regular replacements for agacchat type forms in Samskrita Bharati Sanskrit.

  

2\. The convenience in this, I think, is that in stead of person-number-gender criteria for the agacchat type forms, gatavaan type forms number-gender criteria only. There is a common -kta form such as gata- in all the forms such as gatavaan, gatavatee etc. Learning and rememberingbecomes easier than the entire table of agacchat type forms.

  

3\. Coming to your question, the kridanta forms of this kind shift the focus/emphasis from the verb to the noun; kta , unambiguously to the karma kaaraka and ktavat ambibuously to katr and karmakaarakas.

  

4\. Your question seems to be around the ambiguity in ktavat forms.
