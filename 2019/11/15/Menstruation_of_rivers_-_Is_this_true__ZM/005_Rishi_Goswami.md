I'm not a manuscriptologist or researcher. So if the question deals with the authenticity of verses, it is questionable.

But if it is about the authenticity of Siddhanta, it is believable. If Rivers can Marry,they can give birth to sons and kill them, why not bleed? It is the Adhidaivika Swarupa the verses might be talking about.
