The first rains awash carry as a baggage a great deal of dirt.

  

This is taken as a *symbol -* of something higher, not just as some deterrent factor.

The fact is enough to repulse those given to cleanliness;

but those who are sensitive to higher issues,  

stop not at mere cleanliness.

  

But then there can be a hierarchy of factors too,

where what we feel as good enough may not actually be adequate,

and what we feel as negative may get overruled by something more positive.

  

The matter, in other words, is technical.

Technical issues are, after all, not to be resolved via common-sense arguments.
