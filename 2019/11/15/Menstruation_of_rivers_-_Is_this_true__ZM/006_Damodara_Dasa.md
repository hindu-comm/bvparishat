\>\> It is the Adhidaivika Swarupa the verses might be talking about.  
  

Exactly. This, I feel, should be our world-view. Adhidaivika svarupa  
may manifest in manifest world as adhibhautika i.e. in the form of  
waters etc.  
  
A crude example to try to understand:  
===============================  
If a king comes he comes with bog entourage and a common man is  
usually able to see the entourage (energy of the king). As the king  
moves the whole entourage moves and we say the king moved from point A  
to point B. Entourage is the manifestation of the king, who can be  
taken as the real person being talked about.  
===============================
