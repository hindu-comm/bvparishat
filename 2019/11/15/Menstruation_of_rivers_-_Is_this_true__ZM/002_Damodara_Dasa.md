Hare Krishna.

  

\>\> Is this true?

  

This very question is in question.

  

I would like to ask the questioner -- how would one come to conclusion "is this true or not?"

Who will decide "Is this true?"

Based on what criteria?

Based on which evidence or pramana, and which source of evidence?

How much can we rely on such a source of evidence?

And last but not the least -- how do presuppose that we have sufficient intelligence which cannot be mistaken to understand this?

  

Ardent followers of the Vedas overcome all these questions by accepting Vedas as eternal truth passed on through a chain of Teachers or acharyas as it is. So if Katyayana Smrti is valid smrti passed on by Katyayana and it is based on sruti, then "it is true," whether we may be able to understand it or not based on our pratyaksa and anumana.

  

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
