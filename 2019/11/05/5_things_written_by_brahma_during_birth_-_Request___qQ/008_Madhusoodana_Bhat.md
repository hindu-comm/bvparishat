In a astrology, there is a shloka where it explicitly states that  
Vidhatru (= Brahma) is scripting (=through akshara maalika) the future  
on the forehead (=lalate)  
and the astrologer reads the script through his divine eye called astrology.  
The shloka is as follows:  
Vidhatraa likhitaa rekhaa lalate(s)ksharamalikaa  
daivjnastvam vadet prajna: Horaa nirmala chakshusha  
  
(Kindly excuse my inability to type in devanagari script)
