आयुः कर्मं च वित्तञ्च विद्या निधनमेव च \|

पञ्चैतान्यापि सृज्यन्ते गर्भस्थस्यैव देहिनः \|\| हितोपदेश कथामुख २७ \|\|

  

First of all, it doesn't say it is written on any body part.

  

Secondly it is metaphorical, just like an anthropomorphic Lord Brahma as a creator. It stands for the creative force of the parama-tattva.

My humble opinion: don't take it to be literal, as to where is it written, on which body part, why only forehead or palm?  

  
  

Thanks,
