Namaste,

  

I am looking for collection of khila bhAgAH of all the vedas.

  

Moreover, is there is any exceptional rule that traivarNika ladies can

chant the khila portions. My teacher told me that khila-bhAga is an

exception, for instance, I have seen many traditional

families where shrIsUkta is chanted by ladies.

  

rgs,

sriram
