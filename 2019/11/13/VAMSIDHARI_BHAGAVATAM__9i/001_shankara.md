Namaste,

  

Madhusudana Sarasvati's commentary on the first verse of Srimad Bhagavatam is available in the following edition of Harililamrita of Vopadeva.

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.326566>

  

It is doubtful whether Vamisadhara's Bhagavata Adyapadya Vyakhyasati has ever been published. Those who have access to the corresponding NCC volume may kindly clarify.  

  

regards  
shankara
