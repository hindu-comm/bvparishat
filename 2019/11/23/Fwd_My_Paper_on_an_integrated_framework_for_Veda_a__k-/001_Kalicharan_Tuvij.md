Namaste.

Here are the main observations that could go against the premises made in the paper-

1\) Empirical evidence suggests that monotheisms are bottom up (there are so many tribal monotheisms around) and polytheism is top down (i.e. a basic decency to see that many monotheisms exist).

2\) Vaidika framework helps one see exactly what a particular "monotheistic" group is about. Humans are limited and so are their creations. Well, that's quantum mechanics, no?

3\) "devata-s are forces of nature". There is much wrong with this oft repeated statement. The thing is, forces and nature should be described in terms of devata-s not the other way around. This needs a language more abstract than maths. (Veda)
