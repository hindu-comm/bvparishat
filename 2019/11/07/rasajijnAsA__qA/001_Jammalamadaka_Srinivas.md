According to the commentary of the shlokas we know that rasa or taste is also pAnchabhaoutika like any dravya. That means there is a panchIkaraNa prakriya that they agree. So every rasa has pancha bhUthas viz. PRthivI, ap, tejas, vAyu and AkAsha in it. So the sloka elaborates the source bhUta for each rasa. There are two bhUtas, which are excessive in quantity for each rasa.

  

Madhura rasa is formed due to excessive disposition of PRthivI (earth) and ap (water).
