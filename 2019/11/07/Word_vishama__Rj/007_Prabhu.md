The word विशम cameup in a different context... no text was involved as such.  
Thats the reason for not posting any textual reference for विशम.  
  
Trying to recollect back the context where this word came up, I think the alluded meaning for विशम was something like “rest”.  
I was not fully convinced of that usage but did not have a chance to clarify then and there.

So I thought I could ask here in this group (where I bet almost all are more knowledgeable than me :-) ).

  

In the meantime, I could find विशम here:  

<http://www.andhrabharati.com/dictionary/sanskrit/>  
...but it does not provide the sources of usage.

  
Please see the attachments also.

  
Thanks and Regards  
Prabhu

  

PS: I always try to find and share(if found) the reference for any word usage that I need help with or if I could help.

One can look up my other posts to this group.
