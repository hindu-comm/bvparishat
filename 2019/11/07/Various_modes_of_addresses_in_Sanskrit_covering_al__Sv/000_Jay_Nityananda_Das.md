Respected Scholars,

  

Namo namah.

  

We are planing to make sanskrit popular within our community (step by step) and when circumstances get favorable enough, will try to make it as the lingau franca for our community.

  

Keeping that in mind, I like to know various modes of addresses in sanskrit covering all possible social relationships i.e which word(s)/mode of address should be used to address one's father, mother, husband, wife, sister(elder/younger), brother(elder/younger), brother's wife(bhabhi ji), grandfather, grandmother, an unknown gentleman/lady, teacher, teacher's wife etc.

  

One of my well-wishers suggested me to look into Bharat Muni's "Natya-sastra". Can I get some specific books/links/materials in this regard?

  

Thanks in advance,



das,

Jaya Nityananda Dasa
