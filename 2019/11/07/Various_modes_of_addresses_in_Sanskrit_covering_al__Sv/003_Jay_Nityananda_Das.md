Dear Subrahmanian ji,

  

Namaste, Hare Krsna.

  

Thank you for your kind response. I will try to check it out.

  

(By the grace of Sanskrit Bharati, New Delhi, I was blessed to spend nearly 5 months there to learn sambhashanam some eight years back. My teachers at Sanskrit Bharati were very kind and "hard" enough to impart training into learning as well as teaching sambhasanam to me. Glories to their endeavors!)

  

das,
