Friends,

Since there is interest, I am sharing the Nobel lecture by C V Raman

delivered Dec 11, 1930.

<https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/raman-lecture.pdf>

Interested people should read the whole of it like we study any text.

It is not difficult, he talks about every day experiences.

Crystal transmission has been known in Indian science, liquid transmission

is new.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
