Dear Sri Murthy,  

I have heard of his difficulties in Indian Institute of Science. By that time, the institution had turned itself into a

Government entity controlled by the State officials. The succeeding Director John Grant also resigned and wrote

"the Institute was just a Government office, the head of which did not possess responsibilities of action."

The concept of control is a peculiar legacy of the colonial times. It possibly continues in many shades.  

Among the people mentioned, I did meet K R Ramanathan at Physical Research Laboratory in connection with my  

own work in aeronomy. He was a very approachable person. I studied in Pune with R Ananthakrishnan who was a  

student to CV Raman at IISc. I would consider RA to be kindest person I have met in my life.

Best regards,

BM
