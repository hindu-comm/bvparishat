Dear all,

Namaste. I am Vandan and a student of Sanskrit. It has been quite a few weeks since I have joined this Google group/forum. For my doctoral project, my guide wants me to go through Surendranath Dasgupta's *AHistoryof IndianPhilosophy.* I found a version on [archive.org](http://archive.org); however, there is a significant amount of distorted pages. I was wondering if someone from this group can be grateful enough to help me with a betterversion of the same. Moreover, can someone suggest me some good books to refer for the doctoral thesis on the Vedāntaand Prasthānatrayī?

  

Thanks for having time to read and answer this email. Have a great day ahead!

  

Withregards,

Vandan R.
