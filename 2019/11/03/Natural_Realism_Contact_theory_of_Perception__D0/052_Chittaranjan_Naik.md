Namaste Prof Paturi-ji,

  

Thank you for the educative post on Indology. While I knew some of the approaches to literary criticism that you mention, I wasn't aware there were so many of them.

  

I agree with you that the concepts of paradigm and incommensurability have been more or less confined to the domain of science but I feel it would be fruitful to bring these concepts to bear upon Indology - not for creating another approach to Indology but for undertaking a critique of the entire field of (Western) Indology. I am a bit tied up this weekend, so I will post another message on Monday and try to expand on the theme.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
