"It would also mean that the finite time taken for light to travel from a distant star to our physical eyes is not part of the perceptual process and that the physical bodies we possess somehow do not interfere in the perceptual process."  

This is from Naik_ji 's writing. This exampleof delayed perception of star light is not only based on science, but the part that is left out that the star knew that so many light years later some one will be observing the light.

Actually the net perception is a shuttle combination of what has happened in the past as well as what is there to come.

  

While comparing western philosophy with that of Indian philosophy, it is perhaps important to bear in mind that in the west the reigning mentality is to make a new beginning rather than stay pinned to many ideas of the past that are not relevant today or even true. The winning mentality for mankind should be that it is ok to try new things without invisible strings of the past.
