Namaste Sri Murthy-ji,

  

I am happy you brought up the topic of experiment because the second part of my book, titled '***The Simultaneity Experiment'***, describes an experiment to adjudicate between the two competing theories. The experiment was first conceived in the year 2010 during a discussion held in the Advaitin Yahoogroup on the topic of perception. In the year 2017, i wrote it down in the form of a formal research paper with the intention of presenting it in a seminar that was planned to be held under the banner of ICPR. But the planned seminar never took place, and the paper has now become Part II of my book.

  

Let me clarify however that the experiment is not meant to verify the operative aspects of the contact theory of perception because the subtle sense organs (indriyas) that are said to participate in the process of perception are not gross physical objects, so their presence, or their operations, cannot be verified by empirical means. What the experiment seeks to achieve is to verify which of the empirical results as expected from the two competing theories would be shown to be correct. In the stimulus-response theory, perception would occur after a time lapse, i.e., after the signals from the objects have arrived at the gross physical sense organs are transmitted to the brain and then presented as a percept. In the contact theory of perception, there being conjunction of the subtle sense organ with the object, there would be no such time lapse. The presence or absence of time-lag is what the experiment seeks to verify.

  

The experiment would require a large flare to be created in outer space of such magnitude as to make it visible to the naked eye when seen from the earth. The perception of the flare would have to be with the naked eye without there being any intervening instruments – not even a telescope – in between the percipient and the object / event. I have argued in the book that the presence of an intervening telescope would not amount to a perception of the target object but would constitute an inferential cognition inasmuch as what is seen in the telescope would be a virtual image from which the presence of the target object would be inferred using the vyapti ‘*where there is an image in the telescope there is a corresponding object in space’*. In other words, what is perceived would be the *hetu* and the target object in space would be the *sadhya*; it is therefore important that the flare should be perceived with the naked eye alone.

  

I have discussed this experiment with some well-known traditional scholars, including the eminent scholar Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal, but I feel there needs to be a more formal discussion / debate conducted via articles published in academic journals before we can take further steps towards conducting the experiment. Also, the feasibility of conducting the experiment has to be ascertained both from the point of the technological prowess we currently possess and from the point of the limitations that would be imposed on it by the laws of physics.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
