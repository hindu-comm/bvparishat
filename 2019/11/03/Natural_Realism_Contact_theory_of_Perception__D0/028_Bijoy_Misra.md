Dear Sri Naik,

There is a general confusion to think that Indian tradition is relativistic.

Indian empiricism has an element of intuition and psychic energy built in to the theory.

We don't have a science for intuition yet. Please read Ramanujan-Hardy letters.

You should study Charaka well to appreciate the role of mind in the overall analysis.  

It is not all object space! I gave a lecture many years (two decades) ago at the inauguration

on MIT AI lab. I spoke about it. It remains unsolved.

Let me also request you to operate with scholarly arguments than using arbitrary qualifiers.

Best regards,

BM
