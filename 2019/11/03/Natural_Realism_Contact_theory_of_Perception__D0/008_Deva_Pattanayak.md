The direct realism may berelatedto the sixth sense. A tiger is lurking around before one actually spots it in a forest.

Here is a quote from an article by R.W. Boyer, that I came across which I have attached for your reference.

  

 "Again, in completely holistic Vedanta all objects and observers are nothing other than the universal Self. That ultimate reality is said to be directly verifiable in unity consciousness as the simultaneity of part/whole, reductivism/holism, individual/universal. It is expressed simply and fully in the Vedic statement: “Aham Brahmasmi (Brihad-Aranyak Upanishad, 1.4.10) "
