Namaste Chittaranjan ji,

  

Of course, if it was yet another 'upgrade', the task would have been easier. The trouble with 'upgrades' is that they are frustrating at the same time: there's something pitiful about yet another bigger and 'better' iPhone, and a frustrated being poking it with its fingers, while cursing autocorrect. Fragmented existence weighs heavily on one's life, even though human beings can just about survive in suboptimal states.

  

I'm curious about Mimamsa responses to your work and have subscribed to the thread not to miss new posts.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
