Dear Sri Venkatraman-ji,

  

Many thanks for expressing your interest in reading my book. All the quotations in the book are in English. None of them are in Devanagari script, so you may choose the Kindle or print version, whichever you prefer and find more convenient to read

  

I would welcome your valuable comments after you read the book.

  

With thanks and warms regards,

Chittaranjan
