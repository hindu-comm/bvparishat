Namaste,

  

IMHO 'advaita' is not an opinion or philosophy but a truth that one arrives ultimately. Until then wherever one is, is the fact for him. In that sense it is not in contradiction with any one. 'MAndUkya Upanishad, it's 'kArikas' by GP and the Bhaashyam by Sri Shankara has extensively covered all these. Any incongruencies in BS too.

  

If one is unable to pick up the messages in them, it is up to the person to step up his cognition, knowledge skills, chittasuddhi etcand try again. Like the Ophthalmologist checking the power oflenses for eyeglasses.

  

To grasp 'pRatibodha viditam matam' one will have to step back from objectification on whichScience and all other philosophies bases their inquiry. An unpreparedmind simply either refuse or failto understand the factthat the eyes can see others and not itself. But that understanding that one can 'see' others is enough to own up to the fact that hehas his own functioning eyes. So it is not a 'Brahman bhakthi' that is driving an 'advaitin'.Really speakingin 'advaitam' there is no onestanding separate to call 'Brahman' at all. 

  

So they are right in their perspectives and 'advaita' has no role there. It's like if one is travelling from Mumbai to Delhi by train and a person gets down at Surat claiming that to be Delhi, Advaitin tells him that it is Surat and NOT Delhi. Butthe person has all the freedom to alight at Surat. As and when he learns his mistake, he can board the next train. There is no problem and no hurry. Hopefully he will reach Delhi if he doesn't get down atRatlam Junction claiming it tobeDelhi .

  

In any case, these are very basic ideas that need to be straightened out early on inthe journey of a 'mumukshu'.

  

Regards
