Namaste Sri Amith-ji,

  

Thank you for posting the review of the book. I have been trying to get the book critically reviewed by some scholars since the last 3 months and am still awaiting to hear from them. Yours is the first review of the book and it has come from an unexpected direction. I am grateful to you for it. That the review is positive is an added bonus for me. :-)
But as you have indicated in the final sentence, I am open to criticism and the reader / reviewer need not agree with me. What is more important is that we begin a dialogue between our vidyas and contemporary theories so that the enormous intellectual wealth we are sitting on is brought out for contributing to the shaping of our future destiny instead of being confined to the museums.

  

Thank you once again.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
