Namaste Prof Paturi-ji,

  

I don't generally read books on Indology (I am not familiar with the various interpretive frameworks they use) but I have marked the *Nay Science* as one of the book that I must read.

  

Thank you for highlighting the aspect of my book which brings out the point that the Vedic concept of pratyaksha is different from the modern notion of empirical observation. The following entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy informs us that the 'observation reports' of science are actually complex mixtures of pratyaksha and inferential reasoning.

Regards,

Chittaranjan
