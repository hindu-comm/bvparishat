Namaste Irene-ji,

  

I would welcome your feedback on the book. Of course, there is no hurry, you may take your own time and provide it whenever you complete reading the book. The book introduces a different explanatory framework than that of science and it may take some time to get used to it. For example, the time-delay between the sighting and the hearing of a lightning in the sky seems to so obviously confirm the scientific theory of perception that it is difficult to think there can be an alternate explanation for it. In the Annexure to the second part of the book, I have shown how it can be explained from the standpoint of the Indian logical tradition without causing detriment to the contact theory of perception with its thesis of instantaneous perception. It is a classic case of two incommensurable paradigms in which the judgmental criteria of one does not apply to the other. It would be interesting to see how the notion of paradigms and incommensurability would apply to the field of Indology.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
