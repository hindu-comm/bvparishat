Namaste Sri Murthy-ji,

  

*"Given this escape clause, how can there be any meaningful discussion?"  
*

  

There can be. Today, there is no discussion on the instantaneous perception thesis of the contact theory because the time-lag has been taken to be a 'settled fact'. I have shown in the book (Part II) how the observer has been conflated with the measuring instrument and that the time-lag cannot be taken to be a 'settled fact'. So, irrespective of whether the experiment is feasible today or not, the arguments provided to show that there has been a conflation between the observer and the measuring instrument and that the claimed time-lag hasn't been actually demonstrated affords much scope for discussion.

  

The first part of the book is a detailed philosophical investigation of the the thread of ontology from the time of Descartes as seen from the standpoint of the Indian philosophical tradition. This too affords much scope for (meaningful) discussion. Also, as i have mentioned in another thread, i have drawn from Bhartrahari's philosophy of language to resolve two problems that have long perplexed Western philosophers namely (i) the relation between mind and matter and (ii) the mind-independency of objects having the datum of consciousness. There is certainly much in the book that we can discuss about.



Regards,

Chittaranjan
