Namaste Sri Murthy-ji,

  

One needs to keep in mind that the stimulus-response theory too hasn't been experimentally established in a coherent manner and that it is full of logical inconsistencies and conundrums, yet there is much discussion on it in academic journals. In Chapter II of my book, i have undertaken a detailed refutation of the stimulus-response theory and have shown the inconsistencies that arise between the theory and the Indirect Realism that is claimed to result from it. Should we continue to believe in an incoherent theory without subjecting it to an intellectual scrutiny? I do not believe this topic should be dismissed in such a cavalier manner.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
