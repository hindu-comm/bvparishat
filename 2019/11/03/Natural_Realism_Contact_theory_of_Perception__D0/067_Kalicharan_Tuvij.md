Overcoming unwillingness to respond in such threads, let me make an exception, for once.

1\) Advaita in particular, and vedAnta in general, cannot lay claim to be representatives of Hinduism. However, if such impressions are given, then no discussions can take place (i.e. people just let you be).

2\) So, success or failure of Advaita etc in coming to terms (or not) with modern Science has no bearing whatsoever on the state or wellbeing of Hinduism in general.

3\) Coming from non-vedantic standpoint (shared with the majority of Hindus), Advaita to me is a mere sect of Hinduism (empirically known, Yes?) involved in brahm(an) bhakti.

4\) The point above has traditionally led the expectation that an Advaitin should rather observe a vow of silence, not quite what is observed in the modem day affiliates (i.e. Advaitins being the most vocal; Kaliyuga effect?).

5\) A sect is like a tool tailored for a particular task. Brahm(an) bhakti is not meant to be misused like this.

6\) All the above is in addition to basic errors in understanding the technicalities (makes one angry) as pointed to by a member who is an astrophysicist.

7\) So my heartfelt best wishes to modern Advaitins in their struggles against "Western tradition" on one hand and "less enlightened Hindus" on the other.
