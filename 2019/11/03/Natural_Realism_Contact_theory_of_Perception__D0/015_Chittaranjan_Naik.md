Namaste,

  

I do not believe the implications of establishing the **Indian Contact Theory of Perception** has been fully recognized in academic circles today. The implications are staggering. They are of such proportions as to cause a radical change both in our scientific worldview as well as philosophical worldview. The kind of theory of perception we hold to be true radically impacts both the field of science as well as that of philosophy. In this post, I shall briefly point out the impact that it would have on the relativity theory of science.

  

In the contact theory of perception, perception occurs through contact of the senses with the object, i.e., at the instant of perception there is conjunction of the sense and the object. Thus, the object that is perceived would be existent at the instant of its perception because there cannot be contact or conjunction of the senses with an object that is non-existent. But this directly contradicts the commonly held belief that the distant stars we perceive are perceived as they had existed many years ago and that the star may not even be existent at the time it is perceived.

  

Also, in the Indian contact theory of perception, when two objects or events are perceived simultaneously, it would imply that the existences of the two objects, or the occurrences of the two events, are simultaneous at the instant they are perceived. If this should be so, it would mean that major parts of Einstein’s Relativity Theory would have to be re-written. The determinate nature of the simultaneity of the existence of two objects, or of the occurrence of two events, would directly challenge the ***relativity of simultaneity*** hypothesis of Einstein’s theory. In Einstein’s theory of relativity, it is impossible to determine the simultaneity of two events in space because of the impossibility of being able to synchronize two spatially separated clocks. Also, the simultaneity that an observer perceives cannot be imputed to events in space on account of the different finite times that light would take to reach the observer from the respective spatial locations of the events / objects.

  

Comments?
