Thanks. But also let us take care not to extend discussing these specific points indefinitely (gives me shivers; old memories with Vedanti-s).

The goal of Hinduism, however, is: Completeness. To achieve this, sometimes (a lifetime or two) someone needs total aloofness- popularly known as liberation when acheived. Advaita is a sect catering such specific needs within Hinduism.

Advaita doesn't seek to explain anything, whereas science seeks to explain things (to predict and exploit behaviour). Therefore both, understandably, make use of different tools.

Science has made no such claim that it has understood brain processes.

Note the words "may have been". Plus, not many think of psychiatry as science (i.e. that which can predict behaviour) in proper sense.

Yogic experiences are unique and robust experiences (often gifting a lasting siddhi), whereas Advaitic experiences are common (in varying degree) to all genuine affiliates of that sect.

  

Additionally there are statistical phenomena (inevitable rarities) such as a Ramakrishna in the debauchered backwaters of India, or a Jesus in the badlands of the world, etc.

Science is agnostic about these. So the problem is not with science, the problem is with armies of slaves that think killing people in the name of ideologies causes liberation.

Brahm is a Sanskrit word with a precise pointer. Vedanti-s didn't discover this word. What I believe is that - forget preaching / bombarding the world with pet theories - Vedanti-s weren't even supposed to utter the name brahm.

  

In general, too, a Hindu in a public discourse should refrain from giving away his sectarian identity, that is something deeply private. A Hindu must discover that common language to talk to other Hindu, particularly if he wants to lead them into the impending war (literal here).

  

Sanskrit is that common language. Breakthroughs are needed here, not anywhere else. Which in turn will help "coming to terms" with modern science which anyway has not progressed far beyond the basis of number system and zero that came out from the very common discourse of Hindus.
