Since Vedanta and mithya jnana have been mentioned, I present a few passages of the Upanishads here along with the translations:

  

Brihadaranyaka: 4.5.15:

Chandogya Upanishad 7.14.1:

  

यत्र नान्यत्पश्यति नान्यच्छृणोति नान्यद्विजानाति स भूमाथयत्रान्यत्पश्यत्यन्यच्छृणोत्यन्यद्विजानाति तदल्पं यो वै भूमा तदमृतमथ यदल्पं तन्मर्त्यꣳ स भगवः कस्मिन्प्रतिष्ठित इति स्वे महिम्नि यदि वा न महिम्नीति ॥ १ ॥

  

1.[Sanatkumāra](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sanatkumara#hinduism "show Sanatkumāra definitions")said: ‘Bhūmā \[the infinite\] is that in which one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, and knows \[i.e., finds\] nothing else. But alpa \[the finite\] is that in which one sees something else, hears something else, and knows something else. That which is infinite is immortal, and that which is finite is mortal.’[Nārada](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/narada#hinduism "show Nārada definitions")asked, ‘Sir, what does bhūmā rest on?’ Sanatkumāra replied, ‘It rests on its own power—or not even on that power \[i.e., it depends on nothing else\]’.

  

Brihadaranyaka 4.3.21:

  

तद्वा अस्यैतदतिच्छन्दा अपहतपाप्माभयं रूपम्। तद्यथा प्रियया स्त्रिया सम्परिष्वक्तो न बाह्यं किञ्चन वेद नान्तरमेवमेवायं पुरुषःप्राज्ञेनात्मना सम्परिष्वक्तो न बाह्यं किञ्चन वेदनान्तरं तद्वा अस्यैतदाप्तकाममात्मकाममकामं रूपं शोकान्तरम् ॥ २१ ॥

Here is the Nyaya Sutra:‘दुःखजन्मप्रवृत्तिदोषमिथ्याज्ञानानामुत्तरोत्तरापाये तदनन्तरापायादपवर्गः’ (न्या. सू. १ । १ । २)

  

\[Mithya jnana (erroneous knowledge) leads to dosha (raaga, dvesha and moha), which result in activity, pravritti, which leads to birth,
continued embodiment, which is endowed with misery. The sutra says, by eradicating mithya jnana, the entire chain of effects gets remedied and what results is liberation.\] We do not know the 'svarupa' of moksha, liberation, in Nyaya darshana. Whether there will be perception involving seer, seeing and seen, in the state of liberation as per this darshana is to be studied.
