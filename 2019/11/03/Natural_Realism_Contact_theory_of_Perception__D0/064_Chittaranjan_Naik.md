Namaste Irene-ji,

  

I resonate well with your post. The only thing I would like to add to what you said is that the revolution alluded to here is not a mere intellectual revolution of the kind that Kuhn called a 'scientific revolution' but a Nietzschean kind of revolution in which the intellect also soars into the realm of song and dance.

  

"There it was too that I picked up the word 'Superman' and that man is something that must be overcome, that man is a bridge and not a goal; counting himself happy for his noontides and evenings, as a way to new dawn ...."

  

"I taught them all my art and aims: to compose into one and bring together what is fragment and riddle and dreadful chance in man -

  

" as poet, reader of riddles, and redeemer of chance, I taught them to create the future, and to redeem by creating -- all that was past.

  

"To redeem that part of mankind and to transform every 'It was', until the will says: 'But I willed it thus! So shall I will it -'

  

"this did I call redemption, this alone did I teach them to call redemption.

  

"Now I await my redemption - that I may go to them for the last time.

  

"For I want to go to men once more: I want to go under among them, I want to give them, *dying*, my richest gift!"

  

(From Nietzsche's *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*).

  

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
