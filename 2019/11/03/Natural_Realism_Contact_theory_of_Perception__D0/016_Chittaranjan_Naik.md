With the sole exception of the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles (494 - 434 BC), the Western tradition has consistently held that we perceive objects through a stimulus-response process. The Indian tradition, on the other hand, has, just as consistently, held that we perceive objects on account of the contact of the senses with objects. The different approaches adopted by the two traditions for explaining perception are not trivial – they symbolize the vastly different worldviews of the two traditions so much so that a debate between the two theories of perception – the stimulus-response theory and the contact theory – would constitute nothing less than a ***clash of civilizations***.

  

In the Indian tradition, perception (pratyaksha) is considered as a pramaana. It has the capacity to reveal objects *‘just as they are’*. How does the Indian tradition explain such transparency of perception? For, as long as we are possessed of a body, the transformative mechanisms of the body would prevent the objects from being presented to our sensorium in their true forms; they would be presented, instead, as colored by the perceptual instruments and the transformative mechanisms that we are endowed with. How then does the Indian tradition hold that perception is a pramaana, a means to knowing objects ‘*just as they are’* or in their true forms? How does the process of perception in which the sense organs (indriyas) reach out to the objects ensure that perceptual transparency is maintained?

  

I have argued in the book that perception is inherent to the self and that in reality there is no intermediate perceptual mechanism involved in perceiving objects because we are not embodied beings. The whole phenomenon of embodiment is a myth arising out of primordial avidya as laid out in Vedanta, or mithya-jnana as it is called in the Nyaya texts. The theory of perception does not explain a ‘real process’; it explains a perceptual process as it appears through the lens of mithya-jnana that presents, at once, a sense of embodiment and a spectrum consisting of the subtle-body and gross-body. It is the *‘mechanistic appearance of this spectrum’* during the process of perception that constitutes the perceptual process as described in the Indian texts. Since the entire process is a process that appears through the lens of mithya-jnana, there really is nothing that stands between the perceiving subject and the object perceived. The self is in reality epistemically open to the world. The transparency of perception is thus explained.
