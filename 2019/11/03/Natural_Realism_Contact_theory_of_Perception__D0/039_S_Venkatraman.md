Namaste Naik ji,

  

After going through most of this series of mails and after understanding them only partially, I now want to read your book on the subject. The question is do I buy the Kindle or the Print version? Does your book quote a lot of Sanskrit shlokas in Devanagari? If so, Print version is what I should go for because Kindle is notorious for garbling Devanagari script. Could you please advise me? Many thanks and regards,

  

Venkat.

  

P.s. I have followed with great interest many of your posts in the past in the Advaitin mailing list. I am truly excited to have this opportunity to read a book of yours.
