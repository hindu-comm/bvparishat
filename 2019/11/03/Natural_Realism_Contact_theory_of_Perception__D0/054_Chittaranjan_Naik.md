*There is in the Indian tradition no reason to discard the correspondence theory of truth because it has a robust theory of perception that maintains coherence with reality as it is naturally perceived  
*

  

That is the reason it is so important to reinstate pratyaksha as a pramaana in the world today. For without perception being established as a pramaana, it would not be possible to speak meaningfully about the truth at all. It is for this reason alone that the Indian tradition holds pratyaksha to be the jyeshta pramaana, the first and foremost among the pramaanas. My book is just one effort in this direction. If we are to be serious about reviving our culture and our knowledge systems, there would need to be a more sustained effort towards producing extensive philosophical literature on these kinds of topics challenging the opposing views and reinstating the views of the Indian Siddhantas. We would need to build anthologies of research papers on each topic and they would need to be published in a journal dedicated to the revival of Indian philosophies.
