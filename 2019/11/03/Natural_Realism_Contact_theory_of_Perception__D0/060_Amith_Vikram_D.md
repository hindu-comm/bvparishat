Hello Irene,  
  
If you read the preface, Chittaranjan ji has broken down the complex Vedic framework and made it easier for even the first time reader to comprehend the vast subject. However, that doesn't reduce his arguments to being merely dogmatic. He has challenged the contemporary view in the most civilized way possible, in spite of the Vedic worldview being on the receiving end from a long time. It's purely a debate. And the civility lies in countering it with arguments, if so capable. Due to the lack of any framework, the entire philosophical tradition of the west becomes nothing but mere skepticism.  
  
Regards  
Amith
