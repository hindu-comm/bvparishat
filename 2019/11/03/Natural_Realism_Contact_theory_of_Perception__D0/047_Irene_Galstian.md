Namaste Chittaranjan ji,

  

I'm glad I purchased the book.

  

As for the films, please don't worry about it. I mentioned them only because they aren't sci-fi films in the ordinary sense of the word, but more of visually enhanced experiential/metaphysical meditations. Solaris especially has to do with perception.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
