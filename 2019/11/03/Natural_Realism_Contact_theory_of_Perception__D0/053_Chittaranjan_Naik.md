Namaste Prof Paturi-ji,



In this post, I shall submit my thoughts on the idea of bringing the concepts of philosophy of science to bear upon Indology, or more properly on to a critique of Indology.



Though the notions of *paradigm*, *paradigm-shift* and *incommensurability* arose in the context of the philosophical study of science, there is no reason why they would not be applicable to any discipline of human knowledge that seeks to explain reality, or some aspect of reality, whether it be science, philosophy, social sciences, etc, in as much as a paradigm invariably consists of an explanatory framework based on certain parameters that form the underlying basis of the framework. And when these parameters change so radically that the very *judgmental criteria* of the explanatory framework change, it would result in the birth of a new paradigm that would be incommensurable with the old one.



The notion of paradigm has its origin in the philosophical movement known as ‘*verificationism*’ attributable to a group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians of the early twentieth-century called the *Logical Positivists*. The project undertaken by the Logical Positivists for determining a set of *objective verification criteria* for the theories of science had to be given up as a futile endeavor because there was no way in which the verification criteria could be made free of the *a priori symbolic framework* within which scientists operated. It was the failure of this project more than anything else that led Thomas Kuhn to propose the notion of a paradigm wherein it is not the objective truth of a theory that determines its standing as an accepted theory but it is its acceptance by the scientific community as a *provisional best explanation model* for that aspect of reality that the theory seeks to explain that lends to it the status of an *accepted scientific theory*. It is this notion of a theory understood not as theory pointing to the truth of reality, or to the truth of that aspect of reality that the theory purports to explain, but of it being a provisional best-explanation model within a situational predicament in which the *objective truth* *of a theory* cannot be spoken about meaningfully, that underlies the notion of a paradigm.



The historical events that led to the inability of the Western tradition to speak meaningfully of an objective truth did not begin with the Logical Positivists. It was a problem that had already become endemic in Western philosophy since the time of Descartes and British Empiricism. For, until then, it was assumed that the *correspondence theory of truth* would hold valid. But, if one couldn’t speak of the perceived world as the real world, how indeed would one be able to substantiate the correspondence theory of truth? If the world were merely mind as the Idealists thought, how may there be an external world with which one’s conceptions may correspond? Or, if, as Locke thought, the world we perceive consists of secondary qualities as brought forth to our sensorium in accordance with the senses we are endowed with and the primary qualities of objects are something we can never know, or even form a conception of, how may one meaningfully speak of correspondence of our conception with objects or their properties thereof? Those who had until then considered the perceived world to be the real world came to be called ‘Naïve Realists’ and it was no more possible for philosophers to naively hold that the conception of truth pointed to the correspondence of our conceptions with the external objects of the world. The Western philosophical tradition hasn’t been able overcome this problem so far. The result of it has been a rather fruitless endeavor to redefine the meaning of the word ‘truth’. Today, this has led to philosophers positing more than ten theories of truth, such as the coherence theory of truth, the pragmatic theory of truth, the semantic theory of truth, the deflationary theory of truth, the consensus theory of truth, the constructivist theory or truth and many other theories of truth, but we are no closer to defining truth now than we were three hundred years ago. It is against this backdrop – of the inability of Western philosophers to define what truth is - that we must look at the genesis of the concepts of paradigm, paradigm-shift and incommensurability. Indeed, we may say that the overarching paradigm of all Western disciplines of knowledge is characterized by a tenuous foundation in which the meaning of word ‘truth’ is not fixed and remains as a floating symbol.



The situation with Indology is no different than it is with science or with any other disciple of knowledge that operates within the overarching paradigm of contemporary Western tradition. And it is this overarching paradigm that provides Indology with the license to ignore the goal of Indian vidyas, which is the obtainment of knowledge of truth, or yathartha-jnana as it is called in the Indian tradition, and to impugn to the authors of the texts of these vidyas extraneous motives which have no basis in the vidyas themselves. It has resulted in shifting the focus of the study of texts from philosophy to the philosopher and towards ascribing ulterior motives to the philosophers’ statements.



Seen from the standpoint of the Indian tradition, the failure of Western philosophy to sustain the correspondence theory of truth is attributable to the tradition lacking a culture of pramanas. The Indian tradition suffers from no such lacuna. There is in the Indian tradition no reason to discard the correspondence theory of truth because it has a robust theory of perception that maintains coherence with reality as it is naturally perceived. To treat the Indian vidyas, which are built on the foundations of a healthy and robust theory of truth, on par with contemporary knowledge disciplines and subject them to analyses from a Western explanatory framework set within an overarching paradigm in which the very meaning of truth is called into question is quite ludicrous. The judgmental criteria of the framework of Indology are incommensurable with those of the ‘paradigm’ of Indian knowledge systems. While Western philosophers have been reduced to speak of private ‘*ontological commitments’* instead of the truth, those belonging to the Indian tradition may quite legitimately speak of the truth. In such a scenario, asking the Indologists to interpret the texts of Indian vidyas would be like asking the monkeys to interpret the texts of physics or mathematics. At the risk of sounding candidly uncharitable towards the Indologists, I would quote Jesus’ words from the Bible:



*“Givenotthat whichisholy unto the dogs, neithercast ye yourpearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.” (Mathew 7.6)*

 

The ideas presented here are just some nascent ideas in my mind. They will need to be worked out more cogently and in much more detail but I believe that it would be worthwhile to undertake a critical analysis of the field of Indology using the concepts of paradigm and incommensurability.
