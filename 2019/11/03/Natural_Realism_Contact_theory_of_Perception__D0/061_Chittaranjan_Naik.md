Namaste Irene-ji,

  

Thank you for your understanding and your kind words.

  

  

*Personally, I really want this to be the book that gets a good conversation going. There are many minds in the West and in the East ready for this, which wasn't the case 200 years ago, or even 100 years ago.*  

  
I am worried more about the minds in the East really. We have many scholars among us but very few philosophers. Indian philosophies have got fossilized at the beginning of the seventeenth century and we need new scholar-philosophers who can resurrect them and breathe new life into them.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
