True Prof Nagaraj Paturi-ji, 'guide' is an inappropriate word. I am sure what Vaishnavi-ji meant is *share my knowledge (to whatever extent I know)*, especially with respect to Western philosophy, so that it would enable those scholars of traditional vidyas that may not be familiar with Western theories to respond to them effectively from the standpoint of the Indian tradition.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
