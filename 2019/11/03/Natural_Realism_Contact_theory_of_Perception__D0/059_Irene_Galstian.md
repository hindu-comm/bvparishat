Namaste Chittaranjan ji,

  

Yes, 'Indology' - that's exactly what I meant when I wrote that paragraph. But I do see your point too: any word we use could potentially carry overtones we don't ourselves intend when we use the word. Your response indicates that you genuinely do want to get things clarified. Perhaps if we'd been talking face to face I wouldn't have misunderstood the earlier post, but I'm glad you've resolved my doubts.

  

No danger of me prejudging the book. The task is difficult, and you're a brave man for getting the ball rolling. Personally, I really want this to be the book that gets a good conversation going. There are many minds in the West and in the East ready for this, which wasn't the case 200 years ago, or even 100 years ago.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
