Dear Vidwans,

  

What type of realism is this,

  

It is said in medicine in times when clinical practice was in vogue that one should be capable of diagnosing a patient when a patient presents himself to the physician before he examines him.

  

OR

  

What kind of realism is face reading?

I had an encounter with a face reader. He could read into my fast fairly accurately.

  

Is this a sixth sense or is it a product of long term ratiocination of examination and perception.

  

How does Direct Realism refer to Yoga in reference to Sutra 1 Chapter IV of the Yoga Sutra?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve. ji
