Dear Mr Bijoy Misra-ji,

  

In order to prevent members from forming their own conceptions about what the experiment that I alluded to in my earlier post is, I am posting here an extract from my book explaining the experiment.

  

  

The proposition forming the basis for this experiment is that if there should be a visible event in space, the event would be perceived instantly by the conscious agent (observer) whereas the light from the event would take a certain finite time to travel to another object in space. Thus, if the visual event were to be a large visual flare in space, the human observer would perceive the flare instantly, i.e., as soon as it occurs in space, and would perceive an object located spatially at a certain distance from the flare getting lit up or illuminated by the flare after a finite time interval has elapsed. If the second object (i.e., the one illuminated by the light) were to be substituted by a measuring instrument placed next to the observer’s physical body, then the measuring instrument would register the event after a certain time-lapse whereas the human observer would have perceived the flare instantly (without any time-lapse between the occurrence of the flare in space and its perception by the observer).



Taking a concrete illustration, a visual event occurring in space at a distance of 100 miles from the observer’s body would be perceived instantly by the observer whereas a measuring instrument placed next to the body of the observer would register the visual event only after light has reached it, i.e., after a time interval of 0.000054 seconds (taking the velocity of light to be 1,86,000 miles / second).



In designing a practical experiment, considerations of errors of measurement need to be taken into account. If a human being were to register the time when he perceives the visual event, he would have to record it by pressing some kind of key or button on a time-registering device, such as a stop-watch, to register the time-stamp of the perception of the event. However, such registration of the time-stamp would be subject to human errors arising out of the latency of the human bodily mechanisms, i.e., the time delay occurring from the cognitive episode in which the perception occurs to the initiation of the person’s volition to press the device-key and the inertial time delays of the motor mechanisms of the bodily organs before the device-key is actually pressed. Human errors of the order of 0.5 seconds, or even of 1 second, cannot be ruled out in registering the perception of the visual event. Thus, even though the perception of a visual event may occur instantly, it would be registered with a time-stamp that would be 0.5 seconds or 1 second later than the occurrence of the event. In the case of the visual event, occurring 100 miles away from the observer as illustrated above, the perception would thus be recorded approximately 0.5 seconds to 1 second after the event has occurred (assuming instant perception of the event) whereas an instrument which senses it later in time (i.e., after the light from the source has reached it) would have an earlier time-stamp, i.e., a time-stamp that is only 0.000054 later than the occurrence of the event. In other words, the fact that the event was perceived instantly would be masked by the measurement error of 0.5 seconds to 1 second because the magnitude of the error is far greater than the magnitude of the time taken by light to travel from the source to the measuring instrument. For the error of measurement to be made ineffectual, the visual event would have to be generated so far away in space that the time taken by light from the event to reach the measuring instrument on earth would be sufficiently greater than the human error in registering the time so that the error would be negligible in relation to the time taken by light to travel to the measuring instrument.



I would consider that the generation of the visual event at a distance of 4 light-seconds from the earth would be sufficient to clearly distinguish the time difference between the time an observer perceives it and the time it gets recorded by a measuring instrument. One is tempted to consider a greater distance in order to make the human error truly negligible but it would then entail that the magnitude of the flare would have to be of such a high order that the entire experiment may become infeasible. For, the further away from the earth the flare is created, its magnitude would have to be that much exponentially greater to make it visible to the naked eye on earth. Even a time-lapse of 4 seconds requires the flare to be created at a distance of 7,44,0000 miles from the earth. We would need to detonate a very powerful nuclear device to generate a visual flare at this distance in outer space to make it of the magnitude required for it to be visible to the naked eye on the earth. If we could have a more controlled experimental environment in which the human error can be restricted to say 0.5 seconds, then perhaps a distance of something like 4,64,000 miles with an expected time-lapse of 2.5 seconds may be sufficient and the reduction in distance would make the experiment so much more feasible. In any case, even if the experiment should not be feasible today, the possibility of it being conducted in the future should not be ruled out; we may therefore be granted some indulgence in proposing the experiment considering that the implications of its outcome, if it turns out to be as expected, would be far reaching and indeed *no less paradigm changing* than the one that changed the face of science at the beginning of the twentieth-century. Our primary interest however is in re-instating perception as a valid means of knowledge (pramana) in the contemporary world.
