Dear Sri Bijoy Misra-ji,





*There is a general confusion to think that Indian tradition is relativistic.*



There is no such confusion in my mind. The Indian tradition is an intellectual tradition aimed at obtaining yathartha-jnana and the science of logical discourse by following which one may obtain it is given by Nyaya Shastra also called Tarka Shastra.



  
*Indian empiricism has an element of intuition and psychic energy built in to the theory.  
*  

The Indian system cannot be called empiricism. There is no such division as a-prior reasoning and a-posteriori reasoning in the Indian tradition (as there is in the Western tradition).



Indian logic is based on the seven categories (padarthas) namely dravya, guna, samanya, vishesha, karma, samavaya and abhava and on the pramanas. Indian logic is not based on intuition but on cognition and the removal of hindrances to get to right cognition. The objects of cognition may be physical objects, metaphysical objects (tattvas such as samanya, etc) or psychic objects like mind.





*We don't have a science for intuition yet.*



Nyaya is a science of cognition and cognition may include extra-ordinary things of the kind that people ordinarily call 'intuitive knowledge'.



.

*Please read Ramanujan-Hardy letters.*



Okay, but i would say reading Nyaya shastra would give us a better grasp of the Indian logical tradition.





*You should study Charaka well to appreciate the role of mind in the overall analysis.*  
  

The Charaka Samhita says that one should be well-versed in Nyaya to understand the science presented in its pages.





*It is not all object space!*



Agreed. As i said above, it consists of the seven padarthas.





*Let me also request you to operate with scholarly arguments than using arbitrary qualifiers.*



Frankly i do not know which of my statements you are alluding to. If you anytime feel that my reasoning is not correct you may take the liberty to point it out to me.



Regards,

Chittaranjan
