Dear Mr Bijoy Misra-ji,

  

  

*"Such analysis is unscientific."*  

  

The analysis is undertaken from the praxis of the Indian logical tradition. To dismiss it as unscientific is to show utter disdain to the Indian tradition. I expect arguments to be offered to justify the claim that the analysis may be labelled as unscientific, not summary judgments passed without making an attempt to read the book.

  

  

*"Supernova explosions are happening everyday."*

  

Yes, they are. How does that prove that my analysis is unscientific?

  

  

*"You may distinguish between the sensory detection and psychic detection."*  

  

My analysis is restricted to sensory perception.

  

  

*"Please do post any soft-copy essays if you can."  
*

  

My book is available in soft-copy form (eBook) as Kindle version, Google book and Apple iBook.

  

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
