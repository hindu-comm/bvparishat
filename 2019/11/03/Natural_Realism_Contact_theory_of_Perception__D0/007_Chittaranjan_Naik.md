"It would also mean that the finite time taken for light to travel from a distant star to our physical eyes is not part of the perceptual process and that the physical bodies we possess somehow do not interfere in the perceptual process."This is from Naik_ji 's writing.



I would like to clarify here that this statement was made in the context of Direct Realism and what it entails. For the thesis of Direct Realism to stand, we would need to posit a theory of perception in which the world would be transparently revealed to the percipient, that is, without the transforming mechanisms of the gross body interfering in the perceptual process. 



It may be noted that the Indian theory of perception offers such a model.

Chittaranjan
