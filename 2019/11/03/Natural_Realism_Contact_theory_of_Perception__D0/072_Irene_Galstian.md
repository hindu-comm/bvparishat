I also think that the state of well-being of Hinduism (however you wish to define this word) has nothing to do with science. Modern science is still largely materialistic, and there are scientists who think that the Vedas are 'primitive', 'tribal' and things like that. Where's the surprise that there would also be scientists who think that Jesus, Moses, etc are psychotics?
