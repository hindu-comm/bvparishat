Namaste Irene-ji,

  

Thank you for purchasing the ebook. I hope you find it of interest.

  

I see that you were the first to respond to the announcement of the book on this forum. You had also mentioned the German philosopher Heidegger then. It might interest you to know that in the preface to the book, I have referred to Heidegger's view that ***language in neither prior not posterior to the world, that they are both disclosed together*** because this idea underpins the Indian Vedic tradition too. There are many parallels between Heidegger's philosophy and Indian philosophy.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
