Namaste Sri Kalicharan-ji,





Thanks. But also let us take care not to extend discussing these specific points indefinitely (gives me shivers; old memories with Vedanti-s).



Well, you have got into it now, shivers or no shivers. J





The goal of Advaita is liberation through the acquisition of Self-Knowledge.



The goal of Hinduism, however, is: Completeness.



Are you disputing that the goal of Advaita is liberation / Self-knowledge?





Advaita is a sect catering such specific needs within Hinduism.



Advaita is not a sect catering to some ordinary specific needs. It is Para Vidya, the Highest of all vidyas among the fourteen vidya-sthanas (Chaturdasa vidyas) that confer knowledge of dharma and it caters to the ultimate goal of all human life, moksha, which is the fourth of the purusharthas.





In science, there is no such thing as the self, and the consciousness which Advaita holds to be the essential nature of the self is considered to be a product of the physical brain.



Advaita doesn't seek to explain anything,



It does. Please look up the prasthana-trayi texts. It seeks to explain the nature of Brahman, the relation between Brahman and the self and the relation between Brahman and the world.





whereas science seeks to explain things (to predict and exploit behaviour). Therefore both, understandably, make use of different tools.



The problem we are trying to address is about those areas of knowledge that science encroaches upon without the tools it uses giving it the warrant to do so.







Thus, according to science, all our experiences would have neural processes of the brain as their substrate.



Science has made no such claim that it has understood brain processes.



We are not discussing the claim of science with respect to it having understood brain processes but about the claim of science that the brain is to be regarded as the physical substrate of consciousness and conscious experience. 



Also, the claims of science are always in the form of best-explanation models which are held to be provisionally true until a better model comes along. It is an approach that is called ‘positivist’. Within such a scheme, science does claim that consciousness is dependent on neural processes of the brain even though it may not claim to have provided an accurate explanation of all brain processes.





Now, this would lead to interesting conclusions such as the one reproduced below from theJournal of Neuropsychiatry, Vol 24, Issue 4, Fall 2012:

“*The authors have analyzed the religious figures Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and St. Paul from a behavioral, neurologic, and neuropsychiatric perspective to determine whether new insights can be achieved about the nature of their revelations. Analysis reveals that these individuals had experiences that resemble those now defined as psychotic symptoms, suggesting that their experiences may have been manifestations of primary or mood disorder-associated psychotic disorders.”*



Note the words "may have been".



The point to be considered is that science thinks the physical world forms a causal closure, so any explanation it provides for consciousness and conscious experience will have to have the physical brain as the substrate from which a causal explanation can come. The words “may have been” merely indicate that scientists think they are proceeding in the right direction. 





What is said of Jesus, Abraham and Moses could well have been said of those people who have had yogic experiences or the Advaita experience of liberation.



Yogic experiences are unique and robust experiences (often gifting a lasting siddhi), whereas Advaitic experiences are common (in varying degree) to all genuine affiliates of that sect.



Additionally there are statistical phenomena (inevitable rarities) such as a Ramakrishna in the debauchered backwaters of India, or a Jesus in the badlands of the world, etc.



These are just assertions; they don’t have the power to ether reject the claims of science or to provide a justification for the assertions made.







And at the point of death of the physical body, there would be neither liberation (in the form of videha-mukti) nor any storage of merits and demerits to be carried over to a future birth. Instead, consciousness and the stream of conscious experience that characterized the experience of this life would be switched off - ‘*pouf’*, just like that.



Science is agnostic about these.



If science is agnostic about consciousness, then why does it invest so much time and effort in neuroscience for seeking an explanation for consciousness?



Science is not agnostic about consciousness, it is positivist and it operates under the premise that the physical world forms a causal closure.





So the problem is not with science, the problem is with armies of slaves that think killing people in the name of ideologies causes liberation.



This comment is irrelevant to our discussion.

Chittaranjan
