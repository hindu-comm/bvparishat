Dear Sri Subbu-ji,

  

Thank you for citing the relevant portions of the Upanishads and the Nyaya Sutra to show the positions of Vedanta and Nyaya with respect to embodiment and liberation. While i have taken the Vedanta position as the base perspective in my book, for the purpose of explaining perception i have considered the self as it is covered by avarana and is subject to seeing the world as projected by vikshepa because the presence of these two define the conditions under which Reality appears in the form of the world and pratyaksha operates as a pramana.

  

In general, i have tried to present the operative features of perception taking the features that are common to all the six schools but for the explanation as to how the transparency of perception is achieved, i have relied upon the Vedanta explanation as provided in the Dharmaraja Adhvirananda's *Vedanta Paribhasa*.

  

  

*We do not know the 'svarupa' of moksha, liberation, in Nyaya darshana.
Whether there will be perception involving seer, seeing and seen, in the state of liberation as per this darshana is to be studied.*  

  

The Nyaya texts that i have read are silent on this aspect. The position of Samkhya seems to be quite close (though not same) to that of Advaita Vedanta. Prakriti is seen even after obtaining jnana due to the force of prarabda but once prarabda runs out, prakriti ceases to dance for purusha because her task is done.

Chittaranjan
