Dear Sri Bijoy Misra-ji,

  

Thank you for letting me know of the work done by you in the area of perception.

  

With regard to my work, it is only recently that I have embarked on the project of bringing about an engagement of the Indian tradition with the Western and Contemporary traditions, so I am afraid I will not be able to point to older articles of mine that are written in the same vein. However, I will point you to two old articles of mine and hope that they provide what you are looking for.

  

This long (50 pages long) article titled '***The Sword of Kali***' is a rebuttal of an (equally long) article by Dr. Frank Morales:

This series of articles, which takes a novel approach to the interpretation of Advaita Vedanta, was written as part of a long discussion undertaken in the Advaitin forum in the year 2004:

My book on perception is actually a recasting of two research papers that I had written in the years 2017 and 2018. The first paper became too long to be published as an article in a journal, so I combined both the papers and got them published as a book (thanks to the help provided by Indic Academy).

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
