Thank you Vaishnavi-ji for your encouraging and kind words. I am not an academic scholar but I have spent many years in studying both Indian and Western philosophies and I can share whatever little bit I know with the scholars of Indian vidyas, especially with those who have studied them in the traditional style under traditional gurus, so that together we can undertake the project of redefining the platform of discourse in the contemporary world based on sound epistemological foundations. The current platform of discourse is so heavily skewed with premises drawn from the Western tradition that it becomes almost impossible to uphold the traditional viewpoint. I believe it is time to challenge this state of affairs.

  

I welcome comments from the scholar-members of this forum.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
