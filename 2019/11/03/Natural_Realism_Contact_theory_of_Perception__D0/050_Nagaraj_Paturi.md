Dear Sri Chittaranjan Naik-ji,

  

The field of Indology has got to do with the study of Indian /Indic / 'South Asian' ***texts***. There are several established approaches of literary criticism applied to ***texts.***

  

Formalist criticism

Aesthetic Criticism

Historical criticism

Marxist criticism

Psychoanalytical Criticism  
Inter-textual criticism  
Reader-response criticism  
Mimetic criticism  
Symbolic/Archetypal criticism  

New Criticism

Structural Criticism

Deconstructionist criticism  
Feminist criticism

and so on and so forth.

Among these, the favoriteof western Indologists seems to be Historical Criticism.

  

So if at all there is any possibility of applying the concepts of Philosophy of Science such as that of Scientific Revolutions, Paradigms or Incommensurability etc. to Indology , it is in terms of the methods used by Indologists to study texts, i.e., in terms of which Indological approach is a Scientific Revolution, Paradigm Shift etc.

  

Indology does not studyIndian /Indic / 'South Asian' **texts** using concepts of Philosophy of Science. That is it does not or did not show which of the new ideas in Indian /Indic / 'South Asian' **texts** is a Scientific Revolution, Paradigm Shift, which Indic text has concepts comparable to Incommensurability etc.

  

There are certain western scholars who are interested in issues such as which of the new ideas in Indian /Indic / 'South Asian' **texts** is a Scientific Revolution, Paradigm Shift, which Indic text has concepts comparable to Incommensurability etc. But they do not come under Indologists.
