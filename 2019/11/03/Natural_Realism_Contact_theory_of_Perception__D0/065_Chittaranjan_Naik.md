Thank you Amith-ji for that. I would welcome comments and debate on the approach mentioned in the preface, especially from the Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta scholars on this forum. The approach described in the preface has been obtained by construing the words of the Nyaya text '*Nyayamanjari'* by Jayanta Bhatta.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
