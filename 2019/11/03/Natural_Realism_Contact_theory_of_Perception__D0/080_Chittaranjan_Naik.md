Deae Amith-ji,

  

As you would be aware, in the pursuit of philosophy, it is not physical age that matters but the wisdom and ripeness of the soul that matters. I can see from your synopsis that you have a love for philosophy and that you have been able to capture the essence of the approach and direction of the book well and present its gist in a comprehensive manner. So, rather than consider your review as an audacious effort, I am grateful to you for it and wish you all the best in your endeavors.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
