Namaste,

  

Here is another extract from the book describing how the experiment would be conducted and its result interpreted.

  

  

The Simultaneity Experiment would be conducted along the following lines:



i) A space vehicle would be launched from a launch station on the earth carrying a payload consisting of a powerful nuclear explosive capable of generating a flare in space that would be visible to the naked eye at a distance of 4,64,000 miles.



ii) The payload comprising the nuclear explosive device and its housing would be put into orbit around the earth at a radius of 4,68,000 miles from the centre of the earth, i.e., at a distance of 4,64,000 miles from the surface of the earth.



iii) There would be an earth station at a select location comprising (a) human observers to record the perception of the flare, and (b) measuring instruments to record the sensing of light signals that arrive from the flare. There would be 4 to 5 human observers in order to insulate the experiment from accidental aberrations in registering the time of perception by any single observer. Likewise, there would be 4 to 5 measuring instruments to record the time-stamps when light signals from the flare arrive at the earth station so as to provide a good degree of fault-tolerancy of measurement.



iv) The measuring instruments may be large-format cameras equipped with very long focal length telescopic lenses so that the field of coverage is limited to the area in which the flare would occur. The sensors of the cameras would need to have the required sensitivity to record the available light from the flare without having significant noise intrusion. Ideally the sensitivity of the camera sensors should be of the same order as the sensitivity of the human visual sense. The cameras would be set to burst exposure mode to record 100 images per second providing a measurement accuracy of 0.01 seconds for the time-stamps of the images recorded (this accuracy would be more than adequate for our purpose).



v) The clocks in all the time-recording devices, for both human observers and measuring instruments, i.e., cameras, will be synchronized to show the same time at any instant.



vi) The nuclear device would be triggered to explode and create a powerful flare at a pre-decided time. The pre-decided time would be determined by the coincidence of the times when the satellite would be directly above the earth-station and when it would be night-time at the earth station so that the flare would be seen by the human observers in the night-sky, directly above the earth-station.



vii) The count-down for the creation of the flare shall begin 10 to 20 seconds before the nuclear device is exploded and the cameras shall be activated to start recording the night-sky in burst mode at 100 exposures per second.



viii) The human observers would register the perception of the flare by pressing a key or button on a digital stop-watch.



ix) The burst mode recording by the cameras shall continue until the flare subsides. The time-stamp of the frame in which the image of the flare first appears would be considered as the time of sensing of the flare by the instrument.





The readings taken by human observers and those taken by measuring instruments would be segregated into two groups after aberrant readings, if any, are discarded. The readings for each group will then be aggregated for the purpose of drawing the conclusion.



If there should be a difference of the order of 1.5 seconds or more between the aggregated readings of human beings and the aggregated readings of the measuring instruments, the indirect perception hypothesis would have been falsified. If there should be no significant difference in the readings of the two groups, the status quo would remain.
