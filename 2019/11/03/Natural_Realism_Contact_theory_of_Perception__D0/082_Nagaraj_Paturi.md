Dear Sri Cittaranjan-ji,

  

Yes, it is possible to do such an analysis on any modern academic discipline.

  

Positivism is one such aspect which has sway over almost all the modern academic disciplines.

  

Prof Adluri and Prof Bagjee are thoroughly trained in the discipline of Philosophy itself.

  

So they are well qualified to take up such a study.

  

--------------------------------------

  

But the point about your work that I would like to highlight is that all these years, when people compared modern science and Indic shaastras and said, 'to the extent of pratyaksha pramaaNa, both have a common ground. It is only with regard to the other pramaaNas such as s'abda pramaaNa, the difference and dispute starts', they took it for granted that the pratyaksha pramaaNa of vaidika shaastras is the same as the direct evidence of modern science. Your work should alert such scholars to the fact that pratyaksha pramaaNa of vaidika shaastras is not exactly the same as the direct evidence of modern science. There is a difference in the idea of perception involved in pratyaksha pramaaNa of vaidika shaastras and the direct evidence of modern science.
