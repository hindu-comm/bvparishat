Sri Achyut-ji,

  

This discussion is about Pratyaksha as a PramaaNa. How it works.

  

Specifically , it is about the process of perception.

  

How the senses come to know of sense-objects ? Do they actively take initiative to detect the objects or passively receive the light, sound etc. from the source ?

  

Please limit the discussion to those aspects only.
