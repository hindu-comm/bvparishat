Namaste Irene-ji,



I agree with you that it is not surprising to know that the scientists who think the Vedas are primitive and tribal also think that Jesus, Moses, etc were psychotics. If it were a matter of merely what the scientists think, it would have hardly mattered to Hinduism but when these kinds of thoughts are presented as part of the body of human knowledge that reigns supreme in the world today, namely science, it does have a deleterious effect on the practice of Hinduism because the vast majority of people in the world, including Hindus, take these scientific hypotheses and theories to be true, even unquestioningly true. I shall briefly try to make explicit how it affects Hinduism, or the practice of Hinduism.



Hinduism consists of two broad paths; they are known as the paths of *pravritti-dharma* and *nivritti-dharma*.Nivritti-dharma is the *path of knowledge* and it is characterized by renunciation. Pravritti-dharma is the *path of action* and it is characterized by action impelled by desire for objects. These two paths are interlinked inasmuch as it is the pursuit of pravritti-dharma, the path of righteous action, that leads to the attainment of mental purity and confers the necessary qualifications to be able to pursue the path of knowledge in a manner that will bear fruition. 



A person who is on the path of knowledge (nivritti) is not affected by what scientists think or by the scientific theories prevailing in the world. By virtue of possessing the necessary qualifications for pursuing the path of knowledge, he or she is endowed with *viveka-jnana*, the discriminatory knowledge by which he or she can cleave through the chaff of dubious knowledge and be able to cognize the truth of reality. But such people are few in number; they form a minuscule percentage of the Hindu population. The vast majority of Hindus are fit only for pravritti-dharma, the path of action, and it is by diligently pursuing this path that they will eventually obtain, some in this birth and some after many births,the necessary qualifications for pursuing the path of nivritti. It is for this vast majority of the Hindu population - that is fit for the path of pravritti - that the presence of scientific theories in society makes a difference. How so?



The self of an embodied person appears in the state of embodiment as an agent of action. In this condition, it exhibits three powers known as iccha-shakti (the power of will/desire), jnana-shakti (the power of knowledge) and kriya-shakti (the power of action). Kriya or action springs from the jnana or knowledge that is presupposed to be right. That knowledge which is presupposed to be right may actually be right or wrong, so the action that springs from it may accordingly be rightly directed or wrongly directed depending on whether it is based on right-knowledge regarding dharma or wrong-knowledge regarding dharma. So, in order that a Hindu who is qualified to pursue pravritti-dharma – and this represents the majority of the Hindus – should be able to abide by the prescriptions of pravritti-dharma, he should have prior knowledge of what this dharma is. But if his education and social acculturation have implanted deep-seated beliefs within his mind that there is no such thing as the self or that there is no question of the self outliving the fall of the body or of transmigrating from one body to another, then what kind of action (kriya) would proceed from such beliefs (knowledge presupposed to be right)? He is likely to disregard the prescriptions of dharma altogether. So, you see, the theories of science – at least such of those theories that claim to explain consciousness, perception, etc , - do have a deleterious effect on the practice of Hinduism.
