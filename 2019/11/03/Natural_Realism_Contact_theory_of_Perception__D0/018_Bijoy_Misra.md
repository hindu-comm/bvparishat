Dear Sri Naik,

I did work in psychophysics of perception from the point of view of medical and astronomical detection.

I would love to see any softcopies of essays you might have written. My work is mostly on the visual

acuity of image formation and the perceptual detection of remote objects. The medical work is unclassified

and appeared in SPIE journals in the '90s. The space work is classified.

Let me know of your essays.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
