1\. My understanding Sir, is that the human observer will record the explosion 1.5 secs. earlier as per the New Theory. Am I right?

2\. Why a nuclear explosion? All that is needed is an instantaneous lighting device that produces light of sufficient intensity. Will not solar eclipse serve the purpose? I am trying to understand.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
