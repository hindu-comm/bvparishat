Namaste Hari Kiran ji,

  

Many thanks to Indic Academy and therein Prof Nagaraj Paturi ji for your encouragement with regards to a paradigm-shifting endeavour by Shri Chittaranjan Naik ji by way of publishing his ground breaking work in establishing (should I say re-establising!) the प्रत्यक्षप्रमाण in the Indian theories of cognition through contact as the valid means of perception, taking head on with the western philosophical and scientific theories and pointing out their blind spots.

  

I hope Indic Academy will also work on providing a platform for Chittaranjan ji, who has his expertise in both the western and Indian theories of knowledge, to interact with and guide both traditional and non-traditional scholars of Indian knowledgestudies such that they trust Indian shaastras for their validity and soundness, and move it ahead in continuum as has been during the several centuries in the past, taking head on with the newer purva-pakshas from the western philosophy and sciences! To have such faith in our shaastras as Chittanranjan ji has, is quite infectious when we interact with him/his work!

  

With warm regards
