Namaste Irene-ji,

  

I can understand your response to my mail but please don't prejudge the book just because I have used certain words that carry with them some baggage. The book is a serious book of a metaphysical and epistemological nature. I have used the label '*Western philosophers*' to indicate a class of philosophers that follow the line of thought that has come to us from the Greco-Roman world and blossomed primarily in the Western hemisphere. Is there anything wrong with that? Similarly, I have used the label *'Indologists'* to indicate those scholars who study Indian texts not from the praxis of the Indian tradition itself but adopt a different approach and different method than the traditional ones and having their origins in the Western world. Is there anything wrong with that?

  

Also, the approach that philosophers of the Indian Vedic tradition take to philosophy is drastically different than the approach that Western philosophers take. Unfortunately, the approach of Indian Vedic philosophies hasn't been fleshed out in the modern / contemporary world. I have tried to describe it briefly in the preface to the book. I request you to read the preface and we can discuss further if you wish.


  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
