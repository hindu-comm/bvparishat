Namaste Irene-ji,

  

*Take, for example, the labels of 'Indologists' and 'Western philosophers', as if these were homogeneous clumps and not loosely defined groups of individuals with widely differing perceptions and capacities. Consider how would you feel if you were on the receiving end of such labelling.*

  

This statement actually made me smile. :-) Consider how an Indian would feel when the study of his entire civilizational culture is labelled as 'Indology'!

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
