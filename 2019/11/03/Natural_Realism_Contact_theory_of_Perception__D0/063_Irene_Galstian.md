Namaste Chittaranjan ji,

  

There is its own share of good and not so good circumstances in the East and in the West. Or, in other words, among humankind, at whatever address this humankind happens to reside. However, in spite of this, once the conversation starts and gathers its own momentum, more research will start happening and fresh minds will join in. The point has never been to convince idiosyncratic 70 year olds to change their ways. As Thomas Kuhn pointed out, the old generations and their prejudices pass, and new minds assess the ideas differently. The hard work is to start the process out of one's own energy and to have enough staying power until the trend starts among other people.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
