Namaste Sri Murthy-ji,

  

  

*My understanding Sir, is that the human observer will record the explosion 1.5 secs. earlier as per the New Theory. Am I right?*  
  

You are right, Sir, The only thing I would like to point out is that this is not a new theory, it is an ancient theory that has been in existence in India for more than 2000 years.

  

  

*Why a nuclear explosion? All that is needed is an instantaneous lighting device that produces light of sufficient intensity.  
*  

Again, you are right. I mentioned nuclear explosion because the creation of a sudden flare of the required magnitude would require a great amount of energy to be generated in a short interval of time but if there are other means to generate the energy they would suffice too.

  

  

*Will not solar eclipse serve the purpose?*  
  

No, it has to be a sudden event. Otherwise we will not be able to say that the human observers and the measuring devices are both recording the same event (or same state of the gradually changing eclipse). .

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
