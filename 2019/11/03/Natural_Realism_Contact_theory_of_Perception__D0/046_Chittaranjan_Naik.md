Namaste Irene-ji,

  

In my younger days, I was an avid reader of science fiction and loved watching sci-fi movies too. But at a certain stage in my life, I stopped watching movies and engaging in other such activities. I hope you understand. Thank you for the offer all the same.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
