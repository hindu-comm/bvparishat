Sir,

  

I was under the impression that the study was of a scientific or metaphysical nature. I now see that unfortunately the slant here is ideological. Take, for example, the labels of 'Indologists' and 'Western philosophers', as if these were homogeneous clumps and not loosely defined groups of individuals with widely differing perceptions and capacities. Consider how would you feel if you were on the receiving end of such labelling. Just because other people with poor judgement have done this, must the tit for tat go on indefinitely? I hoped not, as this isn't the behaviour of civilised people.

On the other hand, if you are engaging with the views of, say, Kant, would it not be clearer to say 'Kant says x, whereas I say y, and z is my presentation of the topic'? Then the reader would be able to go to Kant's work, read his claims in context, then proceed to do the same in your work. Otherwise, a fruitful topic everyone could benefit from would end up turning into yet another round of unproductive bickering.

  

Irene
