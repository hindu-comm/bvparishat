Namaste Prof Veeranarayana Pandurangi-ji,

  

I hope this mail catches your eye.

  

I would love to have your comments on my book. The second part of the book deals with the time-lag argument which we had discussed at length on the second day of the 2-day Workshop held at the Karnataka Sanskrit University (KSU) on the 4th & 5th of March 2016. Here is a link to the brief on that workshop:

  

<http://gautamaacademy.org/workshop-on-ontological-status-of-the-perceived-world/>  

  

I have argued in the book that the (believed) time-lag between the occurrence of an event on space and its perception by a human observer is false. The rejection of the time-lag lays the ground for interpreting the sannikarsa mentioned in the Nyaya texts as actual contact of the senses with the object and also that at the instant of perception, there would be conjunction (samyoga) of the sense organ and the object. Would love to have your feedback (as also of those other scholars who had attended that Workshop) on the arguments provided in the book.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
