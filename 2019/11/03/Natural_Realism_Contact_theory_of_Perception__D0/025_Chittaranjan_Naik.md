Namaste,

  

I am curious to know the approach that scholars on this forum take to traditional Indian vidyas. Taking the Indian contact theory of perception as a specific case, which of the two options listed below characterizes the approach that scholars on this forum take to Indian knowledge-systems:

  

1\. The Contact Theory of Perception is still valid today and it can hold its ground against competing theories that are prevalent in the contemporary world.

  

2\. The Contact Theory of Perception was a good theory for its times, i.e., the medieval period, but it has been superseded by recent advancements in human knowledge. It may therefore be of historical interest, to be researched upon by historians of philosophy and culture but it does not have the capacity to stand as a legitimate and valid theory today.

  

I would be especially interested to know the response of Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta scholars on this forum.

  

Regards,

Chittaranjan
