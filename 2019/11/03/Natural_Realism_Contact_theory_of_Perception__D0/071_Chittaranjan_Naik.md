Namaste Sri Kalicharan-ji,



I enjoyed reading your post. Most of the points you make deserve to be discussed in a separate thread of their own; I will here comment on only one point which I see to be having relevance to this thread.



*....success or failure of Advaita etc in coming to terms (or not) with modern Science has no bearing whatsoever on the state or wellbeing of Hinduism in general.*



The goal of Advaita is liberation through the acquisition of Self-Knowledge. In science, there is no such thing as the self, and the consciousness which Advaita holds to be the essential nature of the self is considered to be a product of the physical brain. Thus, according to science, all our experiences would have neural processes of the brain as their substrate. Now, this would lead to interesting conclusions such as the one reproduced below from theJournal of Neuropsychiatry, Vol 24, Issue 4, Fall 2012:



“*The authors have analyzed the religious figures Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and St. Paul from a behavioral, neurologic, and neuropsychiatric perspective to determine whether new insights can be achieved about the nature of their revelations. Analysis reveals that these individuals had experiences that resemble those now defined as psychotic symptoms, suggesting that their experiences may have been manifestations of primary or mood disorder-associated psychotic disorders.”*



What is said of Jesus, Abraham and Moses could well have been said of those people who have had yogic experiences or the Advaita experience of liberation. And at the point of death of the physical body, there would be neither liberation (in the form of videha-mukti) nor any storage of merits and demerits to be carried over to a future birth. Instead, consciousness and the stream of conscious experience that characterized the experience of this life would be switched off - ‘*pouf’*, just like that.

  

Sir, do you still believe that the success or failure of Advaita etc in coming to terms (or not) with modern Science would have no bearing whatsoever on the state or well-being of Hinduism?



Regards,

Chittaranjan
