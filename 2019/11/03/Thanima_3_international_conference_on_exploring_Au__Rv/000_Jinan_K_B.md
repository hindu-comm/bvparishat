Dear friends  
  
CALL FOR PAPERS  
  
‘Word to the WORLD’ Exploring Experiential Knowledge  
  
3rd International Conference on Design Pedagogy and Contextual Aesthetics  
  
Thanima -03  
March 6- 7- 8- 2020 , NIT- Calicut  
  
The Architecture Department of N I T Calicut, I I A Calicut center and  
E K F Pune- are jointly organizing a conference in order to explore  
to find a way out of the homogenizing impact of design education  
rooted in western aesthetic sensibility and the impact of  
globalization. The conference is being held with a spirit of enquiry  
or even to create an environment for people who are concerned to come  
together to research various aspects related to aesthetic sense- its  
roots, formative process, connection with cognition, connection with  
culture and also how it gets distorted and destroyed.  
  
Call for Abstracts \| Conference  
Deadline- 25th November 2019  
  
The objective of the conference  
  
The Objective of the Conference is to explore various aspects of what  
is to be authentic. Authenticity in terms of creation of knowledge,  
authenticity in terms of aesthetic sensibility and authenticity in  
terms being in harmony with nature  
  
The theme  
  
The conference is being organized to address the mechanization,  
standardization, and homogenization that is sweeping the world. The  
visual experience of modern spaces all over the world is beginning to  
look alike. In this regard, architecture and artifacts are no  
exceptions! Until the last century, we have had diverse cultures with  
distinct ways of life and fitting aesthetic sensibilities. The  
homogenization of human cultures is one of the biggest challenges of  
modernity to be addressed by both academia and practice. The real  
issue is to understand how knowledge gets created and aesthetic  
sensibilities as manifested by the things they make and the spaces  
they employ are inextricably linked to the lived context.  
  
In the present era, education conditions and homogenizes the  
sensibility of people through the way it imparts lessons in art,  
architecture, design, etc. (to begin with). In the process, we are  
neglecting vibrant contextual elements and thereby constructing a  
generic world lacking humane facets of design. So if aesthetic  
awareness through education is reinvented as awakening the senses  
through creating situations to connect to the natural context of the  
learner, authentic diverse cultures can stage a comeback. Through this  
approach, the organizers sincerely hope that if not in full, at least  
a part of our lost sensibilities can be regained.
