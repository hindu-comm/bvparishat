I'd like to know about this book Meemamsa Baala Prakaasha. Actually I was searching for word Anuvada and looked up Mimamsa ke Paribhashika Padartha, some book published by RSS, but Anuvada wasnt given properly and Mimamsa Bala Prakasha book was quoted.  
  
If I could get the book online. Or even the name of publication/author, it would be very helpful.

अनुवाद in normal sense is like Recalling अग्निहोत्र from अग्निहोत्रं जुहोति into दध्ना जुहोति। but in संदंश, 2 Mantras घृतानयन and मिथुनवेदन are Angas of Prayaja through Linga, and संदंशपतित अभिक्राम is Anga through Prakarana/Sandamsha.  
  
But what is एकांगानुवाद here? It's nice to see it recalled Insode Abhikrama, but what's the need to call it in Ghritanayana and Mithunavedana, when they're already being Angas through Linga?  
  
Also if Prayaja is Vihita, there must be some purpose of it's Anuvada, what is that? All these questions haven't been specified in Tika.  
  
Thankyou  
Rishi.
