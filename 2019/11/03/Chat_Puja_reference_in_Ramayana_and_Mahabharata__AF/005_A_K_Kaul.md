Jai Shri Ram!

"Chhath" is actually Surya Shashthi.

I do not remember having read about it in the Ramayana and/or the Mahabharata but a lot (most probably) in the Vishnu Dharmottarapurana.

Btw, even this festival is being celebrated on wrong days because of niraadhar nirayna Rashi-chakras galore!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
