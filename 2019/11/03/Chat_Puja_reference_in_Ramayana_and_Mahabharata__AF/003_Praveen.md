Dear Members,

  

Even in the eastern part of the Uttar Pradesh also Chatt Pooja is celebrated. Because, there might be lot of migrants from Bihar to Eastern U.P. for their lively hood. Another reason, marriages are quite frequent from Bihar to U.P. but not another way round. Yes, It is interesting to find out the source from the authentic sources. This year, I witnessed a very big crowd on Chatt Pooja on all the Ghats at Varanasi.

I too not seen such kind of festivals (Chatt Pooja) at least in Telugu states.
