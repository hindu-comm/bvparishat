This name is quite popular as a name of a text. What is special about Saraswati's neck ornament? With regard to kausthubham, naagabharanam, pitambaram etc. we have a specific association. What is such a vaishishTya with the kanthabharanam of Saraswati? Are there any references in the Puranas, etc. on this?
