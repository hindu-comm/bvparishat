Excellent and enviable command over Sanskrit of that intellectual giant. No adequate words to express our joy, appreciation and other feelings.

  

This verse ,I faintly remember,is quoted by my brother, late Lipikar L. S. alias Bapu Wakankar in his book,viz.Ganeshavidya-The Traditional Indian Approach to Phonetic Writing,Tata Press,Mumbai,1966.

  

The book is based on and interpretative of the famous stotra,Ganapati.atharvasheersha.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
