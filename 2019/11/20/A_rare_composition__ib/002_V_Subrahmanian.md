Sir, it is interesting to know about this book by your brother. It is generally believed that the Ganapati.atharvasheersha is not admitted as a genuine Vedic text by non-Advaitins since it speaks of Ganapati as srishti sthiti samhara kaaraka, etc. Does that book mention anything about this thinking and give any proof to the contrary?

  

Thanks
