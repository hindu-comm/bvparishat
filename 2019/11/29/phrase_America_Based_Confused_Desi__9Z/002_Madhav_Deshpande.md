Such "Confused Desi"s are not limited to America. Additionally, in my experience, all immigrants are seen as being "confused" by both the country of their ancestry and the country of their present residence, because they do not fit perfectly the image of "native" in either country. The successive generations of immigrants are inevitably going to be more "native" in the country of their residence, rather than in the country of their original migrant ancestors. I am not sure how useful such terminology is in an academic discourse. Being "confused" is not limited to any particular subset of people, and often "confusion" is in the eye of the beholder. With best regards,
