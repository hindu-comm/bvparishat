Namaste



Thank you Misra ji for bringing to surface a challenge unarticulated on scholarly forums committed for safeguarding 'Bharateeya Samskruti and Vidwat'.



This is the day of 'Thanks giving celebration observation (= utsava)' -a community (= gaNa) wide, social (= samaaja) and National (=rashtra / desha) practice of a value.

I reciprocate and acknowledge the observations of Bijoy Misra ji. Can we look for such a value observation day on National level in India, observed and celebrated ?

The ' jayanti' celebration mentioned in Dharma-Shaastras seem to have become days for ' Religion -community services and narrow observations'.



I recall what my family member who has made a good living at US and raised two children had to say on the challenges of exercising
parental options for children and 'putting up brave face on 'remaining bharateeya' beyond 'Bharath'. Making acculturation choices between education in home, Mandir, schools on : ' indianizing- hinduising - american hinduising ' is really challenging. In one of the
interactions, the young high school kid said : Dad, you were born in a Hindu land, Hindu family. so you are by birth, by fate, turn of events a Hindu. You cannot undo it. You can hold on to it, drop it, modify it. It is your choice. For me, I am an american, I have a choice of religion- to be Hindu or otherwise. I chose to be a Hindu, for it pleases you/ mom'. 



The visiting parents and 'scholars who come on transit-visit having no challenge of raising the next generation beyond home land eco system do not get the tensions on this issue. the challenges within the Home land of 'Hindu Bharath' are of a different magnitude and order. The compass shows different directions at the home and school; and through social media. Adolescence challenges in US are different from adolescence controls at Hindu Bharath in transition. 



The challenge of creating a cadre , grooming and maintaining \<
scholarship lineage in India studies \> for a global platform seems to have disappeared from the axis of ' Indian Guru Kuls' in pre colonial regime with the imposition of bar on ' travel beyond land, over seas ! (Samudra yaana -praayaschitta).

The challenge of creating a cadre , grooming and maintaining \<
scholarship lineage in India studies \> within India never became a political, policy ideology and priority in Independent India !

The vision of creating a cadre , grooming and feeding \< scholarship lineage in India studies \> for a global platform has never bothered the educational institutions, policies in Cultural, language studies of India. The \< education for an employment beyond India> was motivated for pecuniary gains rather than \< cultural identity retention or spread or spokes-person status>. The 1960 to Y2-K generation bright minds
were tech savvy and seeking employment- research opportunities in fields necessary for \<scholarship lineage in India studies \> !



Summary : There was no education model vision and system which outputted ' Indian Scholar in a Jesuit missionary model ' from any platform. This model was not alien to the ancient tradition of Sanatana Dharma. But this model was not allowed to survive, sustain and serve the \<scholarship lineage in India studies \> !



Looks sad state. The fizz does not solve the problem. The finger pointing does not deliver. Targeting other scholars for their faulty motive, without recognizing their genuine interest creates more divide of 'we-they'.



What then would be the approach to adapt ? Ask and answer the same model of questions which Prof. Minkowski asked in the Boden inaugural lecture. What should be Samskruth Studies be for ? ( At Oxford was Murkowski's context). 



Our question in the phrase of Prof. KSK usage of the expression could be : What should be the purpose of \<scholarship lineage in India studies \> ! No need to go tangential pouring out the glory of samskruth et al. We all know that. We need to get a concurrence on ' What is the deliverable and Utility benefit for Future generations. If study of 'Vedic Yajna vidhi' needs to end up as a 'entertainment generator opera model performance of ' vedic yajna' for a week end show -entertainment, do we want to groom scholarship for such maintenance ? If Kalidasa study cannot transform the ' Cloud-Path' or Ujjaini to be an inspirational journey / place to visit, a place of pride , then what should Kalidas study deliver to the students as a value system?



Points that haunt me and many thinking Hindus with whom I have come in contact with.
