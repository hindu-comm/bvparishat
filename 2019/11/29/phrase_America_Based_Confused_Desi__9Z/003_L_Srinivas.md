I dont think a more well-rounded comment on this topic may be found than Prof Deshpande's comment below.

  

However if it helps, it might comfort people to know that the late Swami Agehananda Bharati, professional philosopher and sometime Dasanami monk, thought Swami Vivekananda was an inspiration to India Based Confused Desis. He didnt use the term but he described the phenomenon for all time to come. His 'Ochre Robe' may be read to advantage by those seeking illumination on the subject.

  

Hope this helps,

  
Srini
