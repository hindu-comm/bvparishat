Dear friends,

  

I saw this phrase in Dr Kannan's post about compiling scholarship lineage in

India studies. I thought to write to him, but I am wring public to help create

a discussion. It is possible that the forum here may not have the experience  

and the overview to be able to analyze the phrase. I apologize in advance. It  

is a complex topic.  

  

It is quite possible when you meet your own acquaintances, one does not

need any explanation. The "confusion" could arise when one may operate with

a multiplicity of cultures. I am not going to comment why the latter is a necessity.

Through my own long years of stay abroad, I have rationalized that emigrants  

abroad are a resource to their home country for a multiplicity of reasons.

  

Than there is the cultural education of the young. In India, the security of life

dictates parents to send children to professional schools and some of them  

turn up abroad. There is no analytic study on what "Indianism" may mean

except the children might be exposed to some Hindu rituals. Some pick up

Indian history in their adult life by reading the "scholarly" texts in English that  

would teach them to think whatever they had learned at their home on values

to be untrue. Many would try to prove that India was never a "nation".

The latter is easily understood by the young as they could be experiencing it.  

  

So, we have the root of confusion: the maintenance of western education for

the economics of the world order and the plurality of the fragmentary thinking  

claiming to represent the Indian nation. In the new age of globalization and the

massive media invasion into young people's lives, it is not easy to educate  

unless one has a clear intellectual message. The scholars here and in other

groups may join together to help create such message.

  

Today is called Thanksgiving in the USA. The "Indians" in the US were

slaughtered and the rest are in their "tribal' enclosures. The Indians in India

succeeded in driving the British out. We are calling the act as "resilience" in

our seminar Saturday. We coined the phrase through our own immigrant

thinking as a tool of survival with possible lingering connotations.

  

Best regards,
