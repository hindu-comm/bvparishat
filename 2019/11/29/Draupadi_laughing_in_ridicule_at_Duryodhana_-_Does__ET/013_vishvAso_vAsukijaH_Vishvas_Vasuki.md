आह्। Much to my disappointment and lajjA, I realize that the "correct" versions I was excited about below are from the BORI edition, and not the kumbhakoNa edition (which I am slowly sort-of preparing at <https://vvasuki.github.io/kAvya/TIkA/padya/purANa/mahAbhArata/> while verifying audio from the <https://sanskrit.github.io/projects/audio/mbh-audio/> project ([Archive item](https://archive.org/details/mahAbhArata-mUla-paThanam-GP))). I suppose there is no escaping the labor of correcting <https://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/unic/mbh02_sa.html> .  
  

PS: Thanks to shrI rAmAnujan for clarifying that the source of the [vedavaapi.org](http://vedavaapi.org) text likely comes from the copy of the BORI text in <http://parankusan.cloudapp.net/Integrated/Texts.aspx> .
