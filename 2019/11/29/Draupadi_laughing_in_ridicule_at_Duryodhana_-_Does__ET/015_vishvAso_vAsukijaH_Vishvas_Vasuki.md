That's very heartening and timely (potentially avoids wasted labor on my part, though the website itself is hard to use)!  

  

cc-ing people who seem to be on the project team:  

\- Sirs, the Kumbhakonam edition from the Sarit website is riddled with lots of typos. Do you plan to correct those? Where can we track the progress of your corrections (ie is there a github repo you're using)?  

\- Could you please share the digitized version of the Sastri-Vavilla edition?
