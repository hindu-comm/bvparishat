Thanks very much for the below pointer! That version of the kumbhakoNa edition is far cleaner than other sources such as <http://sarit.indology.info/downloads/mahabharata-devanagari.xml?root=1.5.6.10.212&view=div> , <https://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/unic/mbh02_sa.html> which contain a lot of typos. I wonder whence this corrected version came from.  
  
<http://www.peterffreund.com/Vedic_Literature/Vedic%20Literature%20Unicode/Itihasa/mahabharata%201%202%203.rtf> seems to be good as well.
