Sri V Subrahmanian-ji,

  

The discussions on pages like the one to which you provided the link are not scholarly and as such, not nuanced.

  

There are copious number of such pages and discussions all over the web.

  

Now, let us come to the laugh issue and discuss it in a nuanced way.

  

Duryodhana's enmitytowards the Pandavas was expressed by him much before the Raja Suya and Maya Sabha. Raja Suya happened only after the elders in the family , after noting repeated murder attempts on Pandavas attempted to resolve the issue through a separate kingdom with Indraprastha as capital. What ensued later only shows that this solution did not work. Moreover, it added to the reasons of jealousy in Duryodhana. Details such as he expressing that jealousy by describing the laugh by the people envied by him only show how a jealous person reads the expressions of the people he envies. Vyasa and the regional language translators repeatedly mention Duryodhana's possessiveness towards the kingdom and his jealousy for Pandavas that he nurtured from his childhood as the cause of war. The details such as laugh are not mentioned either by Vyasa or his regional language translators as the cause of war because such details, wherever they are provided, are provided only to bring home the psyche of a jealous person.
