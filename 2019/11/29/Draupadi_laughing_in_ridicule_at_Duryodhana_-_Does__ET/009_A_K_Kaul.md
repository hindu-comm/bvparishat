The addition of Drupadi seems to be an afterthought by some scholars since in the Neelakantha (Chapter 47) and BORI edition (Chapter 43) Draupadi is conspicuous by her absence from the scene, as per the two attachments.

I have checked the Gita Press edition also, and as it is just a Hindi version of Neelakantha edition, there is no mention of Draupadi there as well!.

It appears that Duryodhana was more "hurt" on seeing the pomp and paraphernalia of Pandavas than just because of his "faux-pas" and that is why he had expressed

सो अहं श्रियं च तां दृष्ट्वा सभां तां च तथाविधाम् \| रक्षिभिश्चावहासम् तं परितप्ये यथाग्निना \|2/\|47/43 (Gita Press edition)

Here the word "रक्षिभिः " is ominous and he too has not mentioned Draupadi!!!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram
