Namaste

  

We have heard, seen, etc. the above episode which is said to have fueled the fire of the great war, disrobing, etc. Has anyone studied this in the background of the Mahabharata and other texts? There is one discussion on this here, with citations from the Andhra Mahabharatamu and some opinions:

Are there any articles etc. on this topic?

  

Thanks and regards
