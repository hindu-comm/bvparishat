The Gita Press version of MB doesn't have mention of any comment by Draupadi during this incident.

The other Pandavas laugh, Bhima and his servants, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva laugh. (No mention of Yuddhisthira as well)

  

Critical edition also doesn't seem to have it (see below). These could be later retelling in vernacular that created these side dialogues. For example, Valmiki Ramayana doesn't have mention of Lakshmana rekha, but Tulasi's Manas has.
