Just one pointer about relative dates. The earliest version of Mahabharata (first 2.5 parvas) available to us is the Telugu version, at about the same time as Bharata Manjari. The next version now available to us is 100 years older - the Javanese version which itself is based on the an older Javanese version contemporaneous with the Telugu version.

  

While the BORI edition does indeed consult the above three (the Javanese version via an English translation), their greatest reliance is upon Sarada script manuscripts which are about two hundred years later. The version with Nilakantha's commentary was fixed another three centuries later.
