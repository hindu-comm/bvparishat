Dear Mahe philospohy dept,  

  

Thanks very much for replying! It is a magnificent accomplishment if you have indeed corrected errors in all three editions! Now we just need to figure out how to best benefit from the fruits of your labor.  
  
I found it impossible to get to the Kumbhakona edition text on the website - please see this screenshot - <https://imgur.com/d5bcuwV> (note that it shows only 1 parva to choose from, and there too we cannot see any text when chapter verse etc.. are selected). For our purposes, it would be perfect if you could just export the corrected texts of all three editions to raw text files (that way we won't have to go through the trouble of scraping the website if and when it is made functional). Please help and oblige! (PS: If you have a database or some such backend and need programming skills to dump the text etc.. and if you lack the resources, I'm happy to volunteer.)
