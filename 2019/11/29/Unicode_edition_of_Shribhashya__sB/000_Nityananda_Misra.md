Namaste

  

I am looking for a digital Unicode edition of Shribhashya of Shri Ramanujacharya.

  

GRETIL has the text for only the commentary on BrahmaSutra 1.1.3.

  

There is a digital edition with the Shrutadipika on [vedavaapi.org](http://vedavaapi.org) but I am looking for the text of only the original Shribhashya without any sub-commentaries.

  

Thanks in advance, Nityananda Misra
