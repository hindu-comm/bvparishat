Dear Dr Ravi,

  

Greetings from the Department of Philosophy, Manipal!

  

The word 'अनुक्रोश (anukroṣa)' has occurred **41times** in BORI critical editionof the Mahabharata.In thisedition, particularly the अनुक्रोश- word occurs 41 times, सानुक्रोश- and निरनुक्रोश- occurs 9 and 7 times, respectively.

  

As per your request, I have extracted a few verses which have the word 'अनुक्रोश-' into a file and attached with this email.
