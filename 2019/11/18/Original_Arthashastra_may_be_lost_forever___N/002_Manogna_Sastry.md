Namaste,

  

I believe measures have been undertaken by IGNCA's National Mission for Manuscripts (NAMAMI) to protect this particular document and text. It has been identified as one amongst the Manuscript Treasures of India - #33 in this list<https://www.namami.gov.in/treasures-india>

  

I believe the document has been digitised as well, Oriental Research Institute is also a designated Manuscript Resource Centre of IGNCA, in South Zone (<https://www.namami.gov.in/manuscript-resource-centres>), surprised to see this news piece which seems to provide information contrary to it.
