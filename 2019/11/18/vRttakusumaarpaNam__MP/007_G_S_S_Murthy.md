Distinguished scholars have taken the trouble to browse the poem and have expressed their kind and generous words of encouragement and appreciation. With all humility I express my gratitude to them.

How I wish someone with a pleasing voice and appearance could recite the latter part and make a video ! As it is a hymn to the Lord and also a lakshaNa kavya, students could learn by heart, with obvious advantages.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
