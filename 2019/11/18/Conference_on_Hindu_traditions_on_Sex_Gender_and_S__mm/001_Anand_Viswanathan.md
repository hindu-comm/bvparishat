Thanks for this wonderful initiative by Indic academy. My congratulations for selecting this topic despite the odds.

With the amount of ignorance, misinformation and bigotry we are witnessing, it is becoming extremely clear how important this conference is.

There is absolutely no need to be hush hush about this topic when we know that the "secrecy" is ruining so many lives. We are after all the descendents of those people who had a tradition ofकामसूत्रम् (including commentaries).

  

Please do more conferences on the same as well as related topics.

  

\- Anand
