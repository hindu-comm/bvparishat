1\. The attempt to change the title of a book for the reasons of sexism / obscenity is comparable to but not the same as Bowdlerization or Expurgation.

Such sanitization of the contents of a text, particularly during textual criticism of a manuscript is considered to be a bad textual critical practice / manuscript research practice because such changes do not allow hard facts of the manuscript to be known to the world.But nevertheless , it has been done on several occasions during manuscript research in India. I know sever√†l such instances in the case of Telugu manuscript research / editing. P  
  
Victorian Morality was responsible for most such instances.  
  
2. Change of title or Bowdlerization of title is unrealistic.  
  
3. But these issues are differentg from the issue of what constitutes objectionable obscenity.
