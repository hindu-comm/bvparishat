Thank you for sharing these important pieces on the work of J.C. Bose, Misra ji! Your post reminded me of J.C. Ghosh, another towering scientist from the region, who served as the director of IISc down here in Bangalore.

  

While Calcutta was blessed with the presence of Dr. Bose, the student of his close associate and contemporary P.C Ray, was the scientist Jnan Chandra Ghosh, who served as the Director of IISc after Professor Raman's tenure. Dr. Ghosh was another incredible nationalist and it is to his credit that we have the the amazing departments of aeronautical engineering and metallurgy at IISc, all started with the aim to create a system where universities would contribute directly to the cause of creating national industries in these sectors. Dr. Ghosh was also the chief force behind the creation of the All India Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and founding member of Indian Chemical Society.

  

There are, unfortunately, not many biographies about these scientists who worked during the crucial period that marked the transition from pre independence to post independence India and were thus in a unique position to demonstrate leadership abilities along with their technical backgrounds, for the cause of creating contemporary scientific institutions in the country.*The Shaping of Indian Science: Indian Science Congress Association*, Vol 1: 1914-1947, Hyderabad: Universities Press(India) Private Limited, 2003 and other such volumes alone have material on these giants.

  

  

Warm regards,
