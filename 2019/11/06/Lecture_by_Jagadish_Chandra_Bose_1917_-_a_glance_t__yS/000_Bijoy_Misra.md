Friends,

Earlier I had given an excerpt from the lecture "Voice of Life" of the polymath J C Bose.

Here is the full version  

<https://www.esamskriti.com/essays/pdf/The-Voice-of-Life-JC-BOSE.pdf>

Interested people should read the whole of it to feel the aspiration of the scientific

minds in India to bring the nation on par to the world.

You may check for any contemporaneous scholarly documents in local languages

and classical studies.

Thank you.
