Dear all

  

There are few important points regarding changing the title of the book.

  

Changing name is possible or not in reality?

  

Changing the title of a book by a third party.

  

Khandartha Nirnaya is a book named and written by Madhvacharya.

But no one recognizes this name even today except few student and fanboys of Bannanje Govindacharya. This is just one example. There many like, Sumadhva Vijaya Khandana Traya, Vishnu Tattva Vinirnaya, Tattvodyota etc. Where these altered name is known and printed every where. The original name is totally forgotten by every one, even by me so not able to quote here.

  

The change happened because of the commentators who wrote commentary on that particular books used those names. There are also other possibilities.

  

Sisupalavadha changed to Magha kavya. But people recognize both the names and the change is not effective as Madhvacharya books.

  

Kavindravachana Samuchhaya is a name given by the editors because they couldn't trace the title page or colophon. But changed name is not famous. And unsuccessful in changing the name.

  

Some commentaries name like Dinakari, Gaadhaadari is known by everyone but difficult to recognize the original names given by them like Prakasha etc.

  

There are many instances like this.

  

Thanks
