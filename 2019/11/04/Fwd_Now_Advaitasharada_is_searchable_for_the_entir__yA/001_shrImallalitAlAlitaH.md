One more thing I observed is, now there is no need to click and expand bhashya portion for upanishads. Although, the whole upanishad still doesn't load if the text is big. First a chapter loads and then you have to use links in right side panel to load other chapters. I think scroll to load was better option, which appears to be removed now.

One more thing, the main page doesn't have link to moola-s, while /granthas link allows you to access them.

Another thing, /granthas page lists a few new prakarana-s which are not yet public, like advaitasiddhi, vedantaparibhasha, etc.
