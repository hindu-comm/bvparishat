With great joy we observe that the Advaitasharada resource has now got this additional feature that 'the entire corpus of texts included in Advaitasharada can be searched in one go for words'. Just to test its working I gave 'भोक्ता' in the window and clicked on 'सर्वम्' to have the word searched in the entire corpus. I got 151 results spanning the very many texts there.  We thank the Sriranga Technologies team for this very user-friendly upgrade.
