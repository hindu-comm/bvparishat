Namaste,

  

Thanks (on behalf of Sriranga team) Subbuji for the nice words!

  

Regarding Sri lalitaalaalitah's mail:

1. 'First a chapter loads and then you have to use links in right side panel to load other chapters.'

No, it is as before, you just scroll down to go to other chapters, use of the side navigation is to quicken the process.

  

2\. \`One more thing, the main page doesn't have link to moola-s, while /granthas link allows you to access them.'

  

In fact, for every grantha in the Prasthanatraya, you have a link to the moola in the side navigation itself; we might remove the link to the mool in the treeview to reduce the clutter as more works are added.

  

3\. As Subbu ji has already pointed out, all the granthas listed are available.

  

regards................yoga
