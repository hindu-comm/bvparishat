Dear Vidvans,

  

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gerySvhg3X4>  

  

In the above video, Shri Sundararama Dikshitar says at 57 minutes and 4 seconds that the form used in Brahmayajna namely

"Om bhuH tatsavitur...varENyam..Om bhuvaH bhargo..dhiimahi Ogum SuvaH dhiyo..prachodayaat..." etc was also used as initiation during upanayana samskara.

  

Can the vidvans comment on this please?

  

Thanks

  

Venkat
