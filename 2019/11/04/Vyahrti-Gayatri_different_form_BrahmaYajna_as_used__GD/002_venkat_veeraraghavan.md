Dear Shri Korada Garu,

  

Thanks for the explanations.

Can you give the relevant passage where Vishvamitra Rshi has added the nyasa vidhis?

I have seen a couple of versions one inn sandhyavandana books and one in the Bodhayana Brahmakarma.

  

When you say: "श्रौतसूत्रम् it is प्रत्यक्षप्रमाणम् , i e the मन्त्र-s are directly available"

Can you explain to a layman like myself what you mean when you say Mantras are directly available? (as opposed to applying anumaana)

  

This question came up because the upayaasaka in the video claims that the Brahmayajna version of the Gayatri was used during upanayana etc

  

I was trying to clarify that.

  

Thanks again,

  

Venkat
