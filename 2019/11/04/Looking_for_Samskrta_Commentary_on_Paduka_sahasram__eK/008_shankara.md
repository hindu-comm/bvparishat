Sir,

  

There are 2 series of Kavyamala.  

1\. Kavyamala guchchaka series vols 1 to 14 containing 129 texts. We already have TOC of this series.  

2\. Kavyamala series of single texts - 95 vols; Since these volumes are not anthologies, there is no need of TOCs for this series.  

  

regards  
shankara
