This could be a separate thread,

but I am tempted to include here as it is a very small item.

  

The last but one line of the opening page of the commentary of *pAdukA-sahasra*  

(link given above) shows a quote which is distorted.  

I know the quote from another source/context.  

I am giving its right version below.

  

It reads  

*ran'gam ran'gami....krayAt(?) ks'atapraskhalAdis"viti pavanatayA prasiddha-* etc.

It seems to have scribal errors; **the proper quote is:**  

*ran'gam ran'gam iti brUyAt ks"uta-praskhalanAdis"u*
