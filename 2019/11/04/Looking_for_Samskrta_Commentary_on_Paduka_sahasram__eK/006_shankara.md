Sir,

  

Dr. Dhaval Patel had compiled TOC of Kavyamala anthology series vol 1 to 14. The original file at his website is untracebale now - it seems the website [sanskritworld.in](http://sanskritworld.in) was hacked and is not yet retrieved. I have posted the TOC at Kavyamala anthology page at [archive.org](http://archive.org).

regards  
shankara
