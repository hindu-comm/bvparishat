Dear Vidvans,

  

This thread is about the simmering controversy on varENyam vs varENiyam at the time of Japa and which for m is used for arghya.

  

Now I remember that Shri Venkata Sriram ji and others gave me references for varENiyam (japa kale) and varENyam for arghya and during adhyayana.

  

The following video at 1 hour and 24 seconds says the exact opposite!

Kindly comment,

  

I apologise for not posting this on the original thread since I have been unable to find it.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
