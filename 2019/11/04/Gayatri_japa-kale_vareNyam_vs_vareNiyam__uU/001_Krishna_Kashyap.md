Namaskaram Sri Venkat,

  

This controversy has divided many peopleinto different groups. It is interesting that such a fundamental gayathri mantra should be the place for such a controversy which has involved great scholars and still people remain divided so vehemently for such a long time!!

  

Thanks for bringing this up. However, I dont want to suggest any particular view since I know that this is a heavily debated subject.

  

*Best Regards,*
