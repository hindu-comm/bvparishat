Hi all let me be clear, if I am not in the previous mail. That is a thought of my friend who recently started learning Sanskrit. And what I wrote is not my personal view. I am the one who asked BVP for vulger verses and I have received a plenty of them secretly. So I don't bother about that. And I will inform him all your replies.

Thanks
