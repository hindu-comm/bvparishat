Namaste

  

On \< One of my friends reading meghadoota was demotivated by the vulgar verses appear abruptly.\> and ' Texts with Titles carrying excitingly attention drawing terms' ! :

I dont know what is being done by devout parents with Victorian morality and sensitivity to description of female form of 'devatas'! which is an integral part of prayers and iconography !

Example: How would one explain this sacred stotram even to a devout grown up, even if a family person? How would one explain Gita-Govinda, Soundarya lahiri....several sections of Bhagavata maha purana...

Sri Venkateswara Stotram: कमलाकुचचूचुककुङ्कुमतो , नियतारुणितातुलनीलतनो । , कमलायतलोचन लोकपते विजयी भव वेङ्कटशैलपते ॥ १॥

Would religious 'Hindu's' desire to go on a tirade to exercise options
of sanitizing the entirety of samskruth literature (and its derivative regional language literatures) for it poses difficulty for 'explanation of the text and associated imagery'?? The representation of Shiva and shakti from 'Tantra' has provided enough fodder for misrepresenting the Vedic- Purana- Agama -Tantra traditions !

Psychology and psychoanalysis seems to be working hard to gobble up religion, especially Hinduism.
