I agree with Prof.Paturi that changing names cannot be taken as a project. But as he further says that we could take a stand, BVP could take a stand and say that such offensively sexist- and it was meant to be offensive too-titles need to be deprecated. In this particular case, BVP could recommend referring it as Manorama-khanDanam. Historians of all times suppress or buttress facts and figures to suit their themes. This suggestion is a small change indeed.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
