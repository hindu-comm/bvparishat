Dear Murthy Ji,

tio

  There are far too many offensive titles besides Jagannātha's Manoramā-Kuca-Mardinī. Madhva-Tantra-Mukha-Mardana of Appayya Dīkṣita and works like Appayya-Kapola-Capeṭikā and Bhaṭṭoji-Kuṭṭana, Advaita-Kālānala composed by the Mādhvas have similar offensive titles.
We may not like these titles, but they are important indications of the historical opposition of scholars to each other andhow much heat this opposition generated among various individuals and traditions. One of the texts I am editing has this language for the opponents: ते सर्वे मृत्वा नरकभाजो भवन्तु. The antipathy of some Prakrit poets toward Sanskrit is expressed in this graphic verse:

  

डज्झड सक्कयकव्वं सक्कयकंव्व च निम्मियं जेण \| \[दह्यतां संस्कृतकाव्यं, संस्कृतकाव्यं च निर्मितंयेन\]

  

Such passages are valuable to recognize the historical tensions that did exist in pre-modern times.
