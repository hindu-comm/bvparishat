Namaste,

  

The vulgarity is not in the imagery

\`'We call Lakshmi Parvati as our mother, and extols their breasts and hips.'

but depends on the thoughts they evoke in the mind of the listener or reader.

My example is: when a vegetarian is extolling the beauty of a lamb, he just has its appearance in mind, whereas a non-vegetarian who has tasted meat of a lamb may be thinking of the same lamb in cut and cooked form!
