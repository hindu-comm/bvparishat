\<\<The antipathy of some Prakrit poets toward Sanskrit is expressed in this graphic verse:>\>

  

As per information from a Telugu gentleman, Appakavi, a Telugu poet, has in his appAkaviyamu (or sth like that) quoted certain passages about antipathy between Hindus and Buddhists. I did not have chance to see such passages.  
  
Regards

Narayan Prasad
