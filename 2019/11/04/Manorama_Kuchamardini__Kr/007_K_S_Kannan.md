It is not impossible that some books had had offensive titles even in the West.

Is there any precedence of altering them?

Not that they should serve as our models,

but just to know how things have been handled,

and see if there are any plusses in what has been done in such situations.

And another issue is - how will altered titles be made acceptable universally?
