For student of literature, the *sringAra rasa* should be studied and appreciated. If we start altering the literature, then what about these .....sringAra kIrtanAs of Annamayya, Gita Govinda of Jayadeva, rAsa-panchAdhyAyi of Bhagavata.

  

Should we demolish our age old ancient historic temples and architecture that depict kAma sUtra postures ?

  

A certain swamiji (not disclosing the name) wrote a long letter to Shri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji to remove certain romantic passages from Saundaryalahari and some erotic names from Lalitha Sahasranama. His Holiness ignored politely.
