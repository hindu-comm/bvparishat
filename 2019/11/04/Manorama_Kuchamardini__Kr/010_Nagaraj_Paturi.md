What should we do? Should we go to all the printed copies and paste a different title cover? Should we replace all the title pages in the digital repositories? Should we request the future republishers to use the new title? Then to help readers identify, the publisher will be compelled to say 'earlier called ................' in parentheses. Then the offence remains.
