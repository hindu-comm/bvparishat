Namaste

  

Many people say also we should remove the Parakaaya Pravesha story of Adi Sankara from Sankara Dig Vijaya. But it is an excellent Kavya and we should not try to make alterations according to our wishes.

  

Should we remove the disrobing of Draupadi event from Mahabharata because it is not good for children to listen to such stories?
