Thank you for the book, Shankara ji.

  

As for the supposed vulgarities, some verses were intended as vulgar by people who didn't know any better, others were composed by elevated minds that saw sacredness in all. The swamiji who wanted Saundaryalaharialtered seems to have belonged to the group that wants the easier way out: it's always easier to forbid than to handle responsibly. The latter requires unwavering concentration at all times, the former tries to force the innumerable intricacies of God's play into a rigid conclusion, which doesn't require nearly as much capacity to hold intense concentration.
