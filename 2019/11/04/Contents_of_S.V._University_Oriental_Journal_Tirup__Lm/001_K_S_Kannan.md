Dear Dr. Narenthiran,

The choice should best be left to yourself

as you are doing the hard work.

Yes, taking up one journal,

and arriving till its latest issue is a good idea.

  

You may also please check whether the journal itself does not give  

the Contents Pages every decade.  

  

It should be a standard practice of every journal to provide this information - of  

\(a\) the Table of Contents of each issue, along with

\(b\) an Author Index and  

\(c\) Subject/Title Index)

covering decades ending in zero (as 1960 to 1970 etc.).

Some journals do.
