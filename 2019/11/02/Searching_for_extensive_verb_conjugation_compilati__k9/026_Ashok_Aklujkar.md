1. I do not think the following have so far been mentioned in the present discussion. They do not pursue tha ambitious plan of giving the conjugation / full conjugation of each root/dhātu, but they do contain considerable guidance that is neatly presented. Especially, if 1a has not really been reprinted, it should be.

1a. Gandhi, Dharmaraja Narayen. *Dhātu-rūpa-koṣa.* Fifth rev. edn. by Chintamani Atmaram Shastri Kelkar and R. J. Kanade. Ratnagiri: Hari Dharmaraja Gandhi. 1908. A very useful register of verbal derivatives and the Pāṇinian rules which sanction them. Not easily available.Probably a 1990s reprint exists.

1b. Ramasubba Sastri, S.; and others. 1967-71. *Kṛdanta-rūpa-mālā, a concordance of verbal derivatives.* 5 volumes. Madras \[—> Chennai\]: The Samskrit Education Society. Useful as a depiction of potential language, as distinct from historically attested language (which W.D. Whitney attempts)

1c. Virkar, Krishnaji Bhaskar. 1930. Sulabha-dhātu-rūpa-koṣa˙. Parts I & II \[in one volume\], part III (second revised edn. 1935, reprinted 1937, 1942, 1946, 1949 and perhaps later as well). Bombay: Keshav Bhikaji Dhawale. Much less ambitious than Gandhi's mentioned above. No references to Pāṇini. Good print. Easier to use.

  

2\. It should be borne in mind in a discussion of verbal roots that the roots themselves are a part of the meta-language, not of the object language; they are a product of grammarians’ analysis, and a grammarian is free to give a root’s form in any way that suits his account of the language.

  

3\. For modern beginners in Sanskrit (those studying outside the Gurukula system), Pāṇini, Hema-candra et al. need not be brought in as they are, although the fruits of their labour should be (gratefully) used. Discussions become more fruitful and consultations/references become more convenient if an alphabetical arrangement is followed in each unit of grammatical discussion — if a dictionary-like manner of presentation is adopted and the great grammarians are only silently thanked.
