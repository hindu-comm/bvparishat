\<\< An e-concordance of 3 Dhaatuv.rttis is prepared by Dr Shailaja\>\>

  

A very good site.

The entry, however, requires corrections.

For example, I searched for the dhAtu ष्टुञ्, but I did not find. Actually it is entered as ष्तुञ् (ष्तु). Then the verb-form तुष्टुध्वे is wrong. It appears that the latest edition (2002) of माधवीयाधातुवृत्ति was not used during preparation of the etext.

Narayan Prasad
