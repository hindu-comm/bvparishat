 The older edition of the धातुरत्नाकर more reliable ?

  

Yesterday I checked the same verb-form (for the dhatu स्तु) in the older edition of the धातुरत्नाकर, Vol1. I found the correct verb-form in it, whereas the later edition of 2004 gives wrong one.

The older edition gives तुष्टुढ्वे, whereas the later edition तुष्टुविध्वे-ढ्वे (see the attached pics).

  

Moreover, in the older edition, there are separate lists of all the dhatus withअनुबन्ध and withoutअनुबन्ध along with corresponding page number. It is very useful in searching the required dhatu and its verb-forms.

Fortunately scanned copies of old editions are available on [archive.org](http://archive.org):<https://archive.org/search.php?query=dhaturatnakar>

Narayan Prasad
