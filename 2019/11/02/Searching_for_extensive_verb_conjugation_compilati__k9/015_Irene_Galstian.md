Thank you, Dr Patel, for making this available, looks good!

  

As for mistakes mentioned by Mr Prasad, of course, typos happen. And sometimes attested forms are different from algorithmically constructed ones. That's why it's so good to have several sources.

I am sincerely grateful to everybody who spent their time and knowledge generating these resources.

  

Irene
