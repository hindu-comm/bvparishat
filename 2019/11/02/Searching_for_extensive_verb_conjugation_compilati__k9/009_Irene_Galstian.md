Of course, I agree about 500 roots covering over 90% of the literature. But having this reference is still valuable, and will be even more valuable once it becomes searchable.

It's not that someone is sitting somewhere, agonising which yet-unused verb form to use, although some writers and poets do enjoy playing with unusual sounds. It's just that sooner or later it'll fall to someone to read something in the remaining 10% of the literature, and a reference like this would help.
