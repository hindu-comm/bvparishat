Such exhaustive studies and enumerations have certainlytheir merit.

However, if we look at the corpus of existing Sanskrit works, how many verbs occur? I would be naive to believe that this is not so far studied. Perhaps 90% of the texts would not require more than 500 verbs. Just a hunch.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
