Dear Prof.  

  Namaste.

  Whatever you have said in your message I learnt more than 30 yearsago. I started learning Panini on my own in 1987 starting withअष्टाध्यायी (भाष्य) प्रथमावृत्ति by पं॰ ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासु.

Since 1991 started the study of the सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव. All this was done as a hobby only. During student life I had Sanskrit as one of the subjects from Class III to XI. Prior to 1987 I had never seen theअष्टाध्यायी.

  Best regards

  Narayan Prasad
