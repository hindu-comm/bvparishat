Namaste.

  

  

\<\<If your concordance has any material that Dr. G.B. Palsule’s does not, please do publish it>\>

  

Sir, my concordance is related to sUtras (Sutra numbers) and not dhAtus. One sample page from my manuscript is attached for a general idea about it.

If any publisher is ready to publish this concordance, it will be a pleasure for me.

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
