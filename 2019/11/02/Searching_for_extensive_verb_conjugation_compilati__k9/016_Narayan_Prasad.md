\<\< As for mistakes mentioned by Mr Prasad, of course, typos happen. ... That's why it's so good to have several sources.>\>

  

This is an event that took place in December 2008. A learner (a Russian) of Panini grammar sent me his reply to the exercise of all the verb-forms of the धातु "स्तु" in लिट् लकार (total 16 pp. in MS Word). I did not find anything wrong in his derivation of the form तुष्टुढ्वे. But when just for confirmation, I consultedधातुरत्नाकर, it gave:तुष्टुविध्वे-तुष्टुविढ्वे andमाधवीयाधातुवृत्ति (1964) - तुष्टुध्वे (see pics attached). That time I did not have the copy of
माधवीयाधातुवृत्ति (2002).

  

After seeing such variations, how do you decide which verb-form is correct?

Just from my meager knowledge of Panini grammar I told him that the form given by him was correct and the others were wrong.
