The canonical form of the root is the form in which Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī expects to receive the root for the application of its rules

स्तु is the normalised form and is used typically in the dictionaries.

  

The canonical form is explained by Prof. Peter Scharf in his introduction to the Canonical Index of Madhaviya Dhatuvrtti.

I produce here the passage that deals with the initial ष् and ण्

  

"Initial retroflex consonants are rare in Sanskrit roots. The only Sanskrit roots that appear in usage with an initial retroflex spirant or nasal not made retroflex by prosody are ṣṭhīv (2x), ṣthīv (2x), and ṣvaṣk. Yet there are 82 other roots taught in the Dhātupāṭha (or in the root lists commented upon by Sāyaṇa in his Nāmadhātuvṛtti) with initial retroflex ṣ (plus 21 variants mentioned in the Dhātuvṛttis), and 35 roots taught with initial retroflex ṇ (plus three variants mentioned in the Dhātuvṛttis). Initial retroflex ṣ and ṇ in the Dhātupāṭha serve to mark roots as subject to retroflection under specific conditions. With the exception of ṣṭhīv, ṣthīv, and ṣvaṣk, all roots with initial retroflex ṣ and ṇ replace the initial retroflex by the corresponding dental in accordance with A. 6.1.64 dhātvādeḥ ṣaḥ saḥ, and A. 6.1.65 ṇo naḥ. Retroflexion then occurs to the dental s or n of a root only if it is a replacement. A. 8.3.59 ādeśapratyayayoḥ specifies that the retroflex (mūrdhanyaḥ 8.3.55) provided after h, a semivowel, or a vowel other than one of the a-class occurs only in place of an s (saḥ 8.3.56) that belongs to an affix or is a replacement; an original dental s is not subject to replacement. A. 8.4.14 upasargād asamāse ’pi ṇopadeśasya provides that the dental n (no 8.4.1) even of an uncompounded root after a preverb that contains r or ṣ (raṣābhyām 8.4.1) is replaced by retroflex ṇ (ṇaḥ 8.4.1) under the condition that the root contains an n that is a replacement of an originally taught retroflex ṇ.

The purpose of listing roots with initial retroflex ṣ and ṇ in the Dhātupāṭha is to mark the roots so listed as subject to retroflection in the conditioning environments mentioned in A. 8.3.59 and 8.4.14. In answer to the question, “Which roots are listed with retroflex ṣ for the purpose of determining the proper distribution of retroflex ṣ,” (ṣatvavyavasthārthaṃ ṣādayo dhātavaḥ kecid upadiṣṭāḥ. ke punas te.) and “Which roots are listed with retroflex ṇ for the purpose of determining the proper distribution of the rule for retroflex ṇ,” (ṇatvavidher vyavasthārthaṃ ṇādayo dhātavaḥ kecid upadiṣyante. ke punas te.) in the Kāśikā under A. 6.1.64-65, Vāmana answers, “Those that are read in that way” (ye tathā paṭhyante). It is therefore clear that the Dhātupāṭha forms part of an integral system of grammar with the rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The latter depends upon specific indications in the former for the proper application of its rules. Vāmana does go on to describe which roots are listed with retroflex ṣ and ṇ and which with dental s and n. There are 105 roots in the Dhātupāṭha including the lists commented upon in the Nāmadhātuvṛtti (plus 26 variants mentioned in the Dhātuvṛttis) taught with original dental s and 18 (plus 1 variant) with original dental n."

You may see the canonical and normalised forms of the verbs with initial retroflex and the Paninian rules that normalize the roots at

Amba
