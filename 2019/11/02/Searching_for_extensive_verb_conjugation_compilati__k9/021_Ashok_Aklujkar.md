\>**From:**Amba Kulkarni \<[ambap...@gmail.com]()\>**Subject:****Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Searching for: extensive verb conjugation compilations.****Date:**November 3, 2019. "An e-concordance of 3 Dhaatuv.rttis is prepared by Dr Shailaja, which is available at<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/dhaatupaatha/compare_with_svara.html>, or at<http://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/dhaatupaatha/compare_with_svara.html>For each verbal root, its padii and 'set/anit' information is shown along with its meaning. A link to the 3 commentaries viz. Maadhaviiya Dhaatuvrtti, K.siiratara.ngi.nii, and Dhaatupradeepa is provided. Further, the dhaatus are also linked to the online verb conjugator. And finally, corresponding to each entry, possible derived k.rdantas from Apte's dictionary are shown through a graph.Æ

  

Obviously a very insightfully planned work. Congratulations to Dr. Shailaja and you.
