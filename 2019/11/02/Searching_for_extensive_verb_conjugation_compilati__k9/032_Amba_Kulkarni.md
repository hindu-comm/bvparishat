Thank you for bringing this point.

In fact, I should have mentioned about the deviation we took from the normal usage,

  

The entry corresponds to the canonical form, as defined by Peter Scharf in his introduction to the Canonical Index of Madhaviya Dhatuvrtti.

<https://sanskritlibrary.org/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvcanidx/disp1/canIndexAbout.html>

  

The canonical form of a verb, as against the popular form is the one which is given in the [upade.sa](http://upade.sa).

We have used this form so that one can derive the conjugates following Panini's suutras, starting from this form.

I could not understand why this is wrong.

  

With kind regards,

Amba
