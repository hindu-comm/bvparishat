I agree with Murthy Ji's statement: "However, if we look at the corpus of existing Sanskrit works, how many verbs occur? I would be naive to believe that this is not so far studied. Perhaps 90% of the texts would not require more than 500 verbs."It may be useful in this regard to look at W. D. Whitney's book "The roots, verb-forms, and primary derivatives of the Sanskrit language," for a list of roots with forms attested in Vedic and Classical usage. Though Whitney's work is now rather old, and needs updating in view of the Sanskrit literature published since his time, his general focus on attestations is of practical value. The voluminous works like the Dhāturatnākara provide millions of possible verb forms following the rules of grammar comprehensively, but do not give any indication as to which verbs or forms are actually attested in the known usage. For a practical knowledge of Sanskrit, a focus on attested usage of verbs may be more useful than spending time on the possible usages.
