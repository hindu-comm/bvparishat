Namaste.  

  

\<\< We need to consider the fact that Dhaturatnakara follows Hemachandra's vyakarana, not Panini's vyakarana.>\>  

  

BTW, I have read 8 post-Paninan grammars (please see the attached pic.) and accordingly prepared a "**Concordance of Nine Sanskrit Grammars**" as early as 1997.. Whatever may be the method of presenting the Sanskrit grammar in the sUtra style in all these grammars, I have not observed any changes in verb-forms according to all these grammars.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
