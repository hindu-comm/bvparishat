If digital versions are OK with you, you may find the following interesting.

This data is generated on the fly with a computer program for all 10 tenses/moods for 2000+ verbs of Paninian Dhatupatha. I do not claim authenticity of all the forms actually generated. But still it will help in some cases to locate the root.

  

  

For a good Graphical Interface, download Colordict and Stardict Dictionary Updater apps from playstore. Then you will be able to search any verb form fast on your mobile, even if you are offline.
