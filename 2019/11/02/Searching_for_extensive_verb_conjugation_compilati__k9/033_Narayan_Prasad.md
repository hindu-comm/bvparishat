Dear Prof.,  

  Namaste.

 

 \<\<The canonical form of a verb, as against the popular form is the one which is given in the[upade.sa](http://upade.sa/).

We have used this form so that one can derive the conjugates following Panini's suutras, starting from this form.>\>

  

 The canonical form of the dhAtuस्तु is ष्टुञ्, not ष्तुञ्.

  

\<\<

I could not understand why this is wrong.>\>

  

The correct form isतुष्टुढ्वे. Pl. seeमाधवीयाधातुवृत्ति (RLKT, 2002), p.441.

The sUtra P.८.३.७८ इणः षीध्वंलुङ्‌लिटां धोऽङ्गात् convertsध to ढ.

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
