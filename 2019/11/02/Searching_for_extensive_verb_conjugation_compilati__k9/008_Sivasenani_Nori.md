Knowledge of about 275 roots is sufficient for a basic understanding of Sanskrit (Mahabharata, Ramayana, Panchatantra, Dasakumaracharitra etc.). These 275 may be found in the book SaralasamskritasaraNiH-1 published by Aravindashrama, Pondicherry. Unfortunately they are not arranged in a nice list but are scattered all over.

  

I remember a study done with an aim to find out the most common roots in Vedanta. If memory serves me right, the most used ones were about 200. Regretfully, I can't remember where I read this.

  

So, 500 roots might actually cover more than 90% of the availabile literature, if one looks at only verbs.

  

However the usefulness of the other roots is in formation of substantives
