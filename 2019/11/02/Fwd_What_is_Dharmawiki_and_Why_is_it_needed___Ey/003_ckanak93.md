Myself, Kanakavalli Santhanam, member of the Dharmawiki team led by Prof Ganesh Ramakrishnan and Prof Ashish Pandey.

  
We thank Shri Megh Kalyanasundaram ji for forwarding our newsletter here. Dharmawiki is also extremely thankful to you sir, for the constant moral support extended by you to our social media handles.

  

Thank you Prof Jha for your encouraging words. They mean a lot to us.

  

Shri Shankar ji,  
Thank you sir for your valuable suggestion. We will work towards bettering our SEO.

  

Dharmawiki, conceived as a repository of Indian Knowledge systems, thrives solely on the blessings, guidance and engagement of the scholarly community. We are extremely thankful to the scholars at BVP and others who have constantly encouraged this initiative and helped us with necessary references and guidance that help us maintain the authenticity of information. We are learning and growing slowly and steadily. And request for the continued support and guidance from all the scholars so that, [dharmawiki.org](http://dharmawiki.org) may grow to realize its true potential of becoming a one stop repository for content on Indian Knowledge systems that can engage scholars, researchers, students and the common man who wishes to gain entry into understanding his roots.

  

Thank you,  
Kanakavalli S.  
Team Dharmawiki.
