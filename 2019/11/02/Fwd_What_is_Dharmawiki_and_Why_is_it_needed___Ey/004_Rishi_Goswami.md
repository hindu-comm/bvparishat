नमस्काराः  
  
I'm a student and have a suggestion to make regarding this.  
  
First I'd like to say I'm very glad for this initiative and massive task been taken up by you, respected scholars and other team members of Dharmawiki. Thankyou very much for your efforts towards Sanatana Dharma.  
  
Now I'd like to make a suggestion, as a student it would be very helpful for me as well as many other students like me. I often refer to wiktionary sanskrit for loking up meanings, it has added Shabdakalpadruma, Apte, Amarakosha and Vachaspatyam in text format.  
  
But there is no place for Vyutpatti here. I refer to Ramashrami Tika of Amarakosha, for that matter. If, the entire Ramashrami Tika is added in Text format, it would be extremely helpful for us.  
Such works have been done by IIT Kanpur, they have added several Sanskrit commentaries in text format and also Hindi/English translations.  
Such work been done by one of our group Member Shree Neelesh Bodas, who has added entire Ashtadhyayi ([ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com)) in text format, all Dhatupathas, Mahabhashya,SK, Padamanjari, Kashika and Nyasa as well online.  
  
What needs to be done is, there is an entire Dharmakosha which is probably in 6-7 volumes. The entire text can be posted online, which can be made easy Search Optimization (we search a word and results appear) Similarly,the Nyayakosha, Meemamsakosha (again huge book) can also be added for reference.  
  
Also, if this is Dharmawiki, you can add Manu Smriti, Yajnavalkya Smriti etc with various translations, Sansktit commentaries and new English/Hindi Tikas, in a way like IIT Kanpur has done for The Bhagawad Gita.  
  
Thank you \_/\\\_  
Regards  
Rishi.
