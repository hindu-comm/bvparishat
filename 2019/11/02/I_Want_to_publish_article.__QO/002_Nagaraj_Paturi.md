Sri Nilamadhab-ji,

  

Is it for a PhD admission?

  

or for job search?

  

or promotion in job ?

  

Why before January ?

  

What are the types of publishers /publications accepted for your purpose (by the PhD seat giving or job giving or promoting university /department?

  

Speed of publication depends on the type of publication.

  

for example, UGC recognized research journals may take longer than two months. Others may take shorter time.

  

If there is anything confidential, you may contact members individually.
