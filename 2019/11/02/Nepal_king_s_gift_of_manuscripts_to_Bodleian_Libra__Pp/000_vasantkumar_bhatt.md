Namaste !

I found one interesting / shocking website link, which shows how our Sanskrit manuscripts went to Oxford University library ( dealing of these manuscripts was for such a small amount ? )

  

below is the address of the internet site which gives details of this gift.

In the later part of the write up there's a story about our Sanskrit manuscripts.
