Harih Sharanam

Namo Vidvadbhyah.

In Purvamimamsa, what is the nature of Mantra? Is mantra dravyarupa, gunarupa or kriyarupa?  
If Mantra-Viniyoga is done in some Angi/Pradhana, then is it Kriyarupa Viniyoga or Dravyarupa Viniyoga?

Kriyarupa meaning, = (if mantra is shabdmatmaka, then the UccharyamANa shabda is Kriyarpa Mantra) the process of chanting/uccaharana is vivakshit through Mantrapad.

Again Mantra is Shabdatmaka. But to determine Guna or Dravya I want to know What is Shabd in Meemamsa? Is it Dravyarupa, or it is Gunarupa (like Naiyayikas, shabdaguNakam Akasham).

And Shabda in Meemamsa is perhaps Nitya, for Vedas are Apaurusheya. How do we understand this Concept? Because Srishti and laya Keep on happening as a cycle, so when creation was absent, Shabda was there. But is it Uccharyamana Shabda? If nobody to utter, in what form does Shabd exist?
