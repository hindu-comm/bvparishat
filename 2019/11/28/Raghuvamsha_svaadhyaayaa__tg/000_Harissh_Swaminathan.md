Namaste

  

I am collating all available online resources for doing self study of Raghuvamsha

  

There are YouTube videos and other recordings available for selected sargas that I have collected so far

  

If you have made any private study with notes or other recordings, please do share it with me

  

There are many who want to do kaavyaadhyayanam but unable to do due to lack of teachers

  

Hopefully these resources will help those

  

Thank you

Harish
