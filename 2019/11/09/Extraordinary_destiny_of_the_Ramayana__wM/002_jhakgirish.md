Dear colleagues

It's true that various western as well as many west-oriented Indian scholars observe the Indological facts from western viewpoints and express their ideas in haste without carrying out an in-depth study of
Indian culture,Philosophy and long spiritual tradition which underlies
Vedic and Puranic

Scriptures.Ancient commentators' views must not be ignored.This is very easy to say that some theory seems wrong,illogical and is based on fantasy.It is my personal opinion.
