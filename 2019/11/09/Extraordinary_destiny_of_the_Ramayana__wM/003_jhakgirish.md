Dear colleaguesIt's true that various western as well as many west-oriented Indian scholars observe the Indological facts from western viewpoints and express their ideas in haste without carrying out an in-depth study of Indian culture,Philosophy and long spiritual tradition which underlies Vedic and PuranicScriptures.Ancient commentators' views must not be ignored.This is very easy to say that some theory seems wrong,illogical and is based on fantasy.It is my personal opinion.Girish K.JhaRetd.University ProfessorDept of SanskritPatna UniversityPatna-800 005Current Residence: KolkataSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.

Note that Goldman writes Ramayana is a 'fantasy'. What part of 'Itihasam' he did not understand? It is not a lack of understanding that word, it is the pernicious thought leadership they exercise to hold sway not in their own populations, but to destroy what we built up over thousands of years.Regards,Krishna Kumar PillalamarriOn Fri, Nov 8, 2019 at 11:21 PM Sundareswaran N.K \<[nksw...@gmail.com]()\> wrote:Dear friends,I happened to see this comment, on the "extraordinary destiny of Ramayana", in The Rāmāyaņa of Vālmīki (An epic of Ancient India). Robert P.
