Such is the negativeness westerners attached to Indian literature, because they want to analyze our itihasas from the western lens all the time. Note that Goldman writes Ramayana is a 'fantasy'. What part of 'Itihasam' he did not understand? It is not a lack of understanding that word, it is the pernicious thought leadership they exercise to hold sway not in their own populations, but to destroy what we built up over thousands of years.
