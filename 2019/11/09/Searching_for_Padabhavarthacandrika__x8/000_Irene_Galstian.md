It's a commentary by Śrīkāntamiśra to Gitagovinda. The book seems to be rare, and I have:

a\) filled in an interlibrary load form for it

b\) located a thesis that claims to compare this commentary with another commentary I already have (this should be with me shortly, God willing).

  

However, since time is short, and the interlibrary loan will probably come from the US, if any of you have access to this book, could you please scan the commentary to the first couple of Cantos?

  

Thank you,

Irene
