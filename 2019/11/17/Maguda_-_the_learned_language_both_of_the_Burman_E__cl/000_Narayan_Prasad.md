 Dear Scholars,  
 Namaste.  
  
 Dr Grierson in his paper "Early Publications of the Serampre Missionaries" (IA, Vol.32, 1903, p.253) says:

  
"Maguda, the learned language both of the Burman Empire, and of Ceylon. Translation (of New Testament) commenced."  
  
 In The Baptist Magazine, Vol.4, 1812, based on the letter, dated 20th August 1811, signed by Carey, Marshman and Ward, reports on p.305, under the heading "Religious Intelligence":

  
"II.*The Versions preparing for the press*: - There are,  
 1. The New Testament in the***Burman***language, ...  
 2. In the***Maguda***, the learned language both of the Burman Empire, and of Ceylon, in the study of which our brother F. Carey has made so successful a commencement as bids fair to terminate in a version of the sacred Scriptures into that language, equal in precision to that in the Sungskrit."  
  
**BTW, did these missionaries mean by the*Maguda*language the same as Pali?**  
  
The wordमगधhas been variously transcribed by the missionaries in the early 19th century asMugud, Maguda, Mugudha, Mughudhaetc. Dr Grierson has used the termMagahi (मगही).

  
Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
