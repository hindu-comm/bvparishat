Dear listfolk,

  

Can someone direct me to someone to contact about where to get a copy of the shivarahasya purANa(itihAsa)?I have been only able to find an English translation with no Sanskrit mUla online,and Ribhu Gita(an extract from within it) is known in translations mainly. The Saraswati Mahal's link to buy books is simply not working.

  

Thanks in advance.
