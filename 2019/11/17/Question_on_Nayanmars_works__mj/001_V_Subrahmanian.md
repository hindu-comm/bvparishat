As the Smartha sampradaya is spread across various language speaking people, there is no specific status to the Tirumurai texts in this sampradaya. People who are specially Tamil-loving from the smartas study/learn/sing numbers from the Tirumurai at their homes or in their groups/bhajans etc. There is no requirement in the sampradaya to do this by default. The Thiruppugazh of Arunagirinathar also finds special space in Tamil Smarthas. Many have learnt this and there are groups, founded mainly by late Sri A.S..Raghavan. This is popular among Iyers.

  

Thirumurai is sung in many temples in Tamilnadu but they do not have any specific smartha connection.
