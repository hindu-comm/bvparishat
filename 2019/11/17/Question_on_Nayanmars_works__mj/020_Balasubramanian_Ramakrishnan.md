Panchayatana puja is a specific procedure with 5 deities - one of the first my father taught me when I was 12/13 years old - so that I could do it instead of him during his frequent travels. The Sringeri puja is not panchayatana - that much is obvious to me. In any case that is for householders only. Panchayatana puja is pan-Indian and quite old - epigraphic and archaeological evidence exists from back in the 4th - 5th centuries of the CE.

  

There seems to be confusion on the part of Sri Kashyap that since a good percentage of smArtas-s wear bhasma, they are saivites. There is a big difference between saivites and smArta-s - shiva temples in Tamil Nadu are run by Saivites. Also the thirumurai is not a big part of even Tamil smArta culture, though individually some may recite it and may be very attached to it. So why should there be a big effort to interpret them in advaitic circles, especially in non-Tamil speaking places? I happen to think some of appars poems have an advaitic import - but that's neither here nor there. Manickavachagar is openly anti-advaitic, though his thiruvaachagam is not part of the thirumurai.
