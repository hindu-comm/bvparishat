Even in the Chandramoulishvara puja that the Jagadguru does every night, there is a big saaligrama too by default. All deities like Ganapathy, Ambaal, Subrahmanya, Narasimha, etc. are also in the Puja mantapa to which he does archana daily. Whether this can by called panchayatana or not is not clear. There is a daily Srichakra puja in Sringeri and the Jagadguru performs it every Friday. All observances such as Narasimha Jayanti, Krishna Janmashtami, Ramanavami, Vamana Jayanti, Tulasi Puja, Varaslakshmi, etc. are devoutly observed by the Jagadguru.

This could be a possibility. I have not noticed the practices in the other aamnaya-s, though. There is an advaita maTha, Yedathore, in Karnataka, where Chaturbhuja Pattabhirama is the deity. But they too perform Chandramoulisvara and Srichakra puja.

This is not known. But the legend is the Chandramauli Linga worshiped in Sringeri is the one Shankaracharya got from Kailasa.

This is true.
