Thanks a lot Sri Subrahmanian for your clarification. The importantdifference is "advaitic" philosophy is different from "nayanmar's philosophy".

  

However, the situation is different in the Ramanuja sampradaya. Secretly, Sri Ramanujacharya follows the philosophy of the Alwars. He himself states that he continues a tradition of philosophyof prior acharyas. see his introduction to Brahmasutras first aphorism below:

However, in none of the sanskrit works which he wrote, *he mentions anything about Alwars openly*. Particularly Nammalwar's works are the guidelines for his philosophy. Pancharatra agamas also influenced visistadvaita philosophy. Hence his sampradaya is known as ubhaya vedanta, which includes tamil and sanskrit literature.

  

I used to think that there is ubhayavedanta regarding nayanmars and advaita also. *This view I held is not correct*. Hence in the Sri Shankaracharya Mathas, such pArAyana of nayanmar literature is not a necessary practice, though worship of Chandramoulishvara etc is continued.

  

1\) One other question I have is, is there marked variation of daily ritual worship practices in the Shankara mathas? Are there different kinds of panchAyatana puja followed?

  

2\) Is there any Shankaramatha, where there is a total absence of Panchayatana puja of any kind altogether?

  

3\) Can we also infer that, Sri Shankaracharya was also doing daily ritual worship of some kind? If so historically, has anyone preserved the "archa" deities? or the deities Sri Shankaracharya used to worship, where he lived most of his life, like his birth place or somewhere?

  

Thanks. Looking forward to know the answers to these questions.
