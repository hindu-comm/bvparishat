One cannot deny the 'vaidika' aspect in the Shiva Bhakti system. Rudra Pasupati Nayanar was a Brahmin who devoutly committed himself to the Srirudram of the Yajurveda and attained the Supreme:

I later found a Purana (Kurma?) episode where Krishna did the same in praise of Rudra.

  

There were others in the Shiva Bhakti system who were agnihotri-s as well.
