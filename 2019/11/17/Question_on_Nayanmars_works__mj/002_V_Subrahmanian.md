The crucial difference I should have mentioned and highlighted is: The philosophy of the Nayanmars is not Advaita; it is Shaiva, vishishtadvaita or any other shade.

  

For the bhakti element some Tamil Smarthas have adopted some songs of the Nayanmars. For that matter even the Mukundamaalaa and Thiruppavai are popular among Smarthas.
