\> Manickavachagar is openly anti-advaitic,  

  

namaste, with many scholars here actually working with the moola texts part of this mailing list, I do not want to make a comment on the above statement.  

  

With out entering into a hair-splitting discussion that I dont have appetite for, I would only like to point to an old posting by Subbuji
in another group. I believe the content of this clip is self-explanatory and when looked in the context of statements made about so called 'saivetes', 'smartas' [etc.in](http://etc.in) this thread, it also high lights some misrepresentation of the ground reality.
