Namaste, Dr. Ganesan

  

As I am not a scholar or even an informed student, I do not want to elaborate on this. But for the sake of clarity, I am pointing to a few good resources that could shed more light on this. IN addition, i am attaching an academic publication that delves into this topic. In the process of collecting some references for this mail, I found an interestingly fluid narration in a thesis chapter from shodhganga that I am attaching here.   

  

Thanks,
