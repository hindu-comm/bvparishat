\> The crucial difference I should have mentioned and highlighted is: The philosophy of the Nayanmars is not Advaita; it is Shaiva, vishishtadvaita or any other shade.  

  

Tevaram hymns \*\*generally\*\* follow shaiva siddhanta as against the vedanta-based smarta traditions. They are the first 7 texts of what you mentioned as 12-part tirumarai, sung by three nayanmars mainly. Not all nayanmars have composed hymns and not all hymns of 12 part tirumurai were composed by nayanmars.

  

These generally follow the siddhanta expounded in Shaiva Agama texts (samskritam and later tamil) where Siva is the supreme Lord. There are independent shaiva siddhanta texts focusing only on the darshana part in both Samskritam and Tamizh. There are some good textbooks that trace the origin of this form of Shaiva siddhanta from earlier one from northern parts. I am vaguely familiar with such texts in Telugu and Kannada but I am not sure their fidelity towards the main shaiva siddhanta darshana. Both pancha ratra and vaikhanasa agamas follow the
vishista advaita tenets. I have not seen comprehensive comparison of saiva siddhanta and vishista advaita schools but it might be my limitation.  

  

There are many traditional institutions with exclusive following of Shaiva Tirumarai texts in Tamilnadu and tamil-speaking lands. They are called aadheenam-s. Generally, they are the proponents of shaiva siddhanta tenets and are strictly non-smartha, non-brahminical, deeply traditional, self-sustained institutions in southern and central parts of Tamil Nadu.  

  

Moovar Tevaram and Tiruvachagam are rendered as part of the shaiva -agama based temple worship now limited to Tamil speaking lands. Yes, in contrary to the 4000-prabhandams in shri vaishnava traditions, it has not been formally integrated into the temple worhsip. These are rendered only as a parallel service during and after the regular pujas etc. This practice may be different in many adheenam temples but I do not know the extent of it. The professionals who render these songs in traditional tunes are called 'Oduvaars' meaning 'reciters and they have been de facto hereditary corpus guardians of these texts..

  

The eighth Tiurmurai includes Tiruvachagam sung by Manickkavachaga swami and has been recognized to include intricate rendering of advaitic principles and also a noumenal synthesis of siddhanta and vedanta (advaitic) aspects. There are a couple of good commentaries in english on this work expounding its vedantic shades by traditional indian scholars (as against a missionary translation by GU Pope of late 19th century).

  

Hope this helps. This is not a complete response to the original questions, so forgive me.  

  

thanks
