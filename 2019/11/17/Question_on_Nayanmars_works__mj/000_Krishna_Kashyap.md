Namaskar,

  

In the Ramanuja sampradaya, the 4000 hymns of the Alwars are given sort of equal importance in daily life. They are recited in temples and there are special festivals such as adhyayana utsavas during which these hymns are recited.

  

What is the status of Tirumurai (Tevaram), which has 12 books (periapuranam is 12th book I guess) and hymns sung by different Nayanmars? Are they recited similarly in temples in the smartha sampradaya? Further, since these works are in Tamil, and sung by saints coming from different backgrounds, are they taken as seriously as the Ramanuja sampradaya takes similar equivalent Tamil hymns of Alwars?

  

Further, I know of people even in north india belonging to Ramanuja sampradaya who take these Alwar Tamil hymns seriously and practice them with probably some real difficulty. Is such efforts taken by north indian advaita followers to practice, learn and keep in touch with Tamil hymns of Nayanmars, who I think, probably are mainly from south india only.

  

Thanks

Namaskaram
