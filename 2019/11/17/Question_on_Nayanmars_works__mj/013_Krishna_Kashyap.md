On the other hand, in every Srivaishnava temple, the recitation of 4000 hymns of Alwars is almost an essential feature.

  

One other question I had was :

  

The content of the hymns of Alwars may be very similar to the content of works of nAyanmArs. The only difference is the deity (Sri MahaVishnu or Parvati pati Siva). Is this true? Has anyone done a deep study of the comparativestudy of these two major streams of literature? what I mean by "content" is the philosophical content. I am not very interested in the poetic comparisons or style of Tamil or any such secondary features. I am only interested in the philosophical comparison or comparison between the vedanta proposed by these two streams of literature.

  

Let me clarify my question even further. In vedanta, analysis is done in three stages: 1)adhibhUta 2) adhidaiva 3) adhyAtma

roughly the first is physical level, second is the deity level, third is Atma level (Atma means the highest entity addressed in the upanishads like Atma vA arE drastavyO srotavyO nidhidhyAsitavyah). If we separate only the adhidaiva aspects into Saiva and Vaishnava, then the question is that there is commonality in the aspect that these two systems converge at the adhyAtma level, except that they may use terms sadAsiva or nArAyana for the highest entity they want to refer to.

However, they mean the same entity by these two terms in the meaning they want to convey. My point is other than the form differences and may be purAnic differences, are there any philosphical differences between these two streams of literature?

  

  

Thanks.
