Dear Gopal Gopinath,

Thanks for sending these 2 articles.

In the first one by Karen Pechilis there are some factual errors and others regarding some proper names. But the paper is a very good attempt on this topic.

  

As a researcher working on this important and interesting topic for quite long and as one who is working on the original texts I have made these observations.

  

Thanks to you once again for raising these points.

  

With the best wishes

Ganesan
