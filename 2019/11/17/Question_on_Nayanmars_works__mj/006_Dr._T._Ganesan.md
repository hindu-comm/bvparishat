I just want to clarify certain misconceptions in this thread:

  

-   *Tevaram hymns \*\*generally\*\* follow shaiva siddhanta as
    against the vedanta-based smarta traditions.*

  

Tevaram hymns do not at all follow Saivasiddhanta; they follow purely the ''Vedas'' and do not at all mention any 'Vedantic' idea or concept.

  

All the Tevaram hymns (sung by Tirujnanacampantar, Tirunavukkaracar and Sundaramurti Nayanmar-s) are fully permeated with Vedic references such as the three Veda-s, Vedic Yaga-s and pure Bhakti to Siva and Siva- worship; many hymns say that Siva Himself sings the Samaveda, He Himself is the Samaveda personified, etc., etc . These hymns state that at many Saiva holy places visited by these Nayanmar-s the Brahmins who were well versed in the Veda-s and who had performed many Vedic Yaga-s themselves perform the worship to Siva in those temples. (*I have written a few articles on this subject*)  

  

That apart, the Chola kings of the 10-12 th centuries had made endowments in many Siva temples for the daily singing of the Tiruppatikam-s (the Tevaram hymns were known so); it is mentioned in the inscriptions as திருப்பதிகம் விண்ணப்பித்தல் (Tiruppatikam ViNNappittal).

  

The Advaita Samkara matha-s do not have anything to do with either the Tevaram hymns or the Siva temple worship in any form;

  

Even in the case of the Ramanuja Sampradaya incorporating the Divyaprabandham hymns in the Visishtadvaita philosophy and in the Vishnu temples was not done by Ramanuja; though it is highly possible that he was influenced by the Bhakti of the Alvars, he never ventured into incorporating the Divyaprabandham hymns in the Visishtadvaita philosophy as there is no direct evidence from his works. These developments are post-Ramanuja.  

  

-   *The philosophy of the Nayanmars is not Advaita; it is Shaiva,
    vishishtadvaita or any other shade*

  

The ''philosophy'' of the Nayanmar-s is neither Advaita nor Visishtadvaita, nor Saivasiddhanta nor do they follow any Saiva Agama-s.  

  

Ganesan
