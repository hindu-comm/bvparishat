Namaskarams to all.

  

Shiva temples used to have Oduvars who sand the hymns from Thirumurai. Most of them were well versed in Pann Isai - an equivalent of carnatic music. Even now in the major temples which are rich enough to pay them they chant these songs in particular after the Abhisheka. Often there is recitation of the vedas and thevarams ( also called Dravida Veda in common parlance) During festivals this practice is followed in almost all temples.

  

There is decline in the practice due to poor remuneration paid to Oduvars and consequently trained persons.

आनो भद्रा: क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वत:  
Let Noble Thoughts Flow from Everywhere
