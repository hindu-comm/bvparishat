#### Esteemed Scholars,

A few days back there as an inquiry from a Ph.D. scholar about UGC care listed journals. if the person has not yet found out the suitablejournal, I just want to share that I had a reasonably quick response from the journal. the link is here

  

<https://www.historyresearchjournal.com/>

  

I take no guarantee of the quality, as I came across this journal just few daysago, but as it is listed in the UGC_Care list. it serves the purpose.  

Allthe best.
