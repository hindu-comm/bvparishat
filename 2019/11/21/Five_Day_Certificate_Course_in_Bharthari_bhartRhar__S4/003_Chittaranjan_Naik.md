Thank you Prof Nagaraj Paturi-ji for posting this message. Something in it piqued my interest and I would like to respond to it.

I would like to mention that in my book '**Natural Realism and Contact Theory of Perception**', I have drawn from the philosophy of Bhartrahari, more specifically from his philosophy of language and the stages of speech as laid out therein, to resolve two of the most perplexing and seemingly intractable problems that have plagued Western and Contemporary philosophy till date, namely (i) the relation between mind and matter, and (ii) how an object that has the datum of consciousness can be mind-independent.

  

I would be happy if more scholars of Indian vidyas take up this topic for research because I am convinced that it will demonstrate that Indian philosophy is not something that belongs merely to the past but something that has tremendous potential to contribute towards redefining both contemporary philosophy and contemporary science.

  

My book was announced on this forum on the 3rd of Nov 2019. For those who missed the announcement, it may be found here:

Warm regards,

Chittaranjan
