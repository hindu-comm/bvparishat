If anybody from the list is registering from outside of India, where did you find the IBAN/BIC/SWIFT numbers for the Institute's bank account?

IFSC and MICR are for within-India transactions. I've emailed the coordinator, but time is short, so I'm posting the question here in case someone has this information already.

  

Thank you,

Irene
