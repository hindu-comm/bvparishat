Dear Vidwans,

  

I am herewith attaching herewith the barakhadi of the शुद्धा plosive consonants in the order of the अच् vowels. This arrangement helps in determining as well as appreciating how the position of voicing of the plosive consonants shift when they are suffixed to the अण् vowels.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
