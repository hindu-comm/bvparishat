Dear Vidwans,

  

I am attaching herewith an audio file of the Shuddha Plosive Consonants. The recording is in the background of a metronome so that the difference in the effort to phonate a short vowel and a long vowel will become evident.

  

Vidwans are requested to opine on the rendition.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
