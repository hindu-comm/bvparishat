Dear Rahulji,

  

The Upadhmaniya and the Jihvamuliya are not included in the Maheshwar Sutras as such they are considered as ayogavaha letters (possibly they are subsequent corruptions in the Sanskrit language ). These letters cannot be included or composed in the sutra form.

  

As you will see that the visarga though considered to be ayogavaha letter, it could be included in the barakhadi sutras at सःशषत् as such the visarga is a chaste letter. However you will find that it does not take on the vowels as well as it cannot be lengthened. It has been derived from the ह of the 14th Maheshwar Sutra हल्.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
