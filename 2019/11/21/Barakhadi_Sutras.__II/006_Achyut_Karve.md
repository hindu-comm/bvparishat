Dear Vidwans,

  

I am now attaching herewith two audio files of the Barakhadi in the order of the अच् vowels for the कोमल or मृदु consonants. The vowels ऋ andऌ cannot be suffixed to vowels in sutra form and instructed. In order to instruct them we need to suffixत् likeकृत् खृत्andकॢत् खॢत् and instruct.  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
