Much obliged to read your comments and explanation shrii Karve mahodaya

of course these are not included in the maheshwara sutrani.

  

I found your audio clips very useful guides and thought I may ask for updhmaniya and jihvamuliya as reading about them does not give an idea about the uccaaraNa

  

best regards

Rahul
