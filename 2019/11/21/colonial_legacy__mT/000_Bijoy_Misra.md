Dear friends,

I am reading various comments on the BHU story.

I came to know the following last week.

The Moghul were using Persian as a language and the British imposed English.

The British wanted to "sympathize" with the common man and tried to create

a local language. So Hindi was born as a mix of many languages of north India.

They appointed Englishmen (Asiatic Society) to create the language that can be

used by the Englishmen (missionaries). Their logic was to create a scripted language  

in place of the oral expressions that is India. We have not fully studied the cultural

imposition. Apparently they created textbooks in Hindi by hired Englishmen (Jesuits)  

with help from who may join in for money.  Such colonial techniques are still

applied in places of occupation with different kinds of imposition.  

It happens in the hill areas in the name of "literacy".  

It is a difficult topic to analyze.  

Thought to share.
