Dear Vidwans,

  

The example of यर्वण and तर्वण cited by Patanjali in the Pashpanhik is a good example.

  

Secondly he alone who knows Dharma knows Adharma. Thus adharma is not a stand alone. Dharma and adharma are relative to place person and time and hence only wisdom can save a person from adharma. Dharma and adharma are not prescriptive as is often thought of.

  

My Guru Ahmedjan Thirakwa was a Yogi in the morning and a bhogi by night. He used to say that even Alha would absolve him of his misdeeds looking to his achievements in the field of akshara as rendered on the tabla.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
