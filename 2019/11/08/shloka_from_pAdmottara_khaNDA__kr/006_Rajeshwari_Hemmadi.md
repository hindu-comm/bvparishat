Thanks Sir, for checking

  

actually my friend has her great grand father's (he used to teach Sanskrit ) diary where in the 2-3 shloka-s are written so I started trying to get the adhyay of this shloka.. as it mentioned 99 ( PaAdmoattar khaNDa).. so started getting these questionson

\(1\) what is **PaAdmoattar khaNDa**? **padma purANa, uutar khaNDa**? or **diiferent** book?

\(2\) found two versions (sanskrit text) online ..but no luck..then
**how many versions**?

\(3\) different **version popular at Bengal side in past** ?

  

so I had to put this question here where all Sanskrit lovers, learned are members :-)

  

search is on since it is very beautiful shloka

  

regards
