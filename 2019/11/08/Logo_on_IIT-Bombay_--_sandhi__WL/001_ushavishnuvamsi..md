1).When we write or recite immediately one after one then there sandhi 'is'. Sandhi may or may not cause परसवर्णः in place of अनुस्वारः. Hence now both ( ज्ञानं परमं ध्यानम्/ ज्ञानम्परमन्ध्यानम्) are grammatically right. But, as far as the system or custom of writtingis concerned, ज्ञानम्परमन्ध्यानम् though grammatically right, is not accepted generally. 2). Now when, as sandhi itself is optional in prose, we write or recite one after one not immediatelly, then ज्ञानम् - परमम् - ध्यानम् is right. Here a pose of more than .5 'maatra' must be observed. The conclusion is - the pose in writing is not of much importance, because we write either way, it sounds similar in utterance. (Vishnu Namboodiri)
