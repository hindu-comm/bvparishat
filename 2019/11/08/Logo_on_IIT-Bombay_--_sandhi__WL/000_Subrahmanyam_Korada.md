नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

There is a controversy regarding the grammaticality of the 60 year old sentence on the Arch of IIT-Bombay - ज्ञानम् परमम् ध्येयम् - suggested by Vid Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ---

  

ज्ञानम् परमम् ध्येयम् (IIT-Bombay) -- is absolutely correct ---

  

(i) whether you agree thatthere is nothing  grammatically wrongabout the mottowritten as "ज्ञानम् परमम्ध्येयम्"; or you also feel that it is grammatically wrong.

  

  

There is nothing grammatically wrong in the sentence -- ज्ञानम् परमम् ध्येयम् ।

  

(ii) what according to your information, is the historically oldest proof of the convention that external sandhi between words of a sentence was optional in olden days.Is therean explicit orimplicit evidence about Panini's own position available in this matter  

  

Irrespective of time ( both in olden days and presentday) सन्धि / संहिता in a sentence is optional --

  

1.संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः ।

नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते ॥ (an old परिभाषा quoted in शब्दकौस्तुभ by Bhattojideekshita under अ इ उ ण् )

  

In a single word संहिता / सन्धि is नित्या - and also between a धातु and उपसर्ग - as well as in a समास । But in a वाक्यम् (sentence) it requires विवक्षा ( the desire of the speaker ) , i e if the speaker desires सन्धि he can do otherwise

he can employ the words of a sentence even without सन्धि ।

  

2\. Panini gives an अधिकारसूत्रम् (before सन्धिसूत्र-s ) -- ’संहितायाम् ’ पा सू 6-1-70 and it means - if and only if the letters are pronounced in quick succession , i e without any interference of time and / or letter / sound . This means there can be

the opposite - असंहिता / विसंधि । In असंहितोच्चारणम् there will not be सन्धि ।

  

3.Patanjali , in महाभाष्यम् under ’ भूवादयो धातवः ’ पा सू 1-3-1 clearly says - असंहितयोच्चारणे ।

  

4.Bhattojideekshita , in his शब्दकौस्तुभ ( अ इ उ ण् ) quotes a verse as an authority in not having सन्धि in a वाक्यम्

( sentence)--

  

हे रोहिणि त्वमसि शीलवतीषु**धन्या**

**एनं**निवारय पतिं सखि दुर्विनीतम् ।

जालान्तरेण मम वासगृहं प्रविष्टः

श्रोणीतटं स्पृशति किं कुलधर्म एषः ॥

  

धन्या एनम् -- there is no सन्धि and it is not a दोष / defect .

  

5\. Panini did not effect सन्धि in अ इ उ ण् -- which is a संज्ञासूत्रम् ( सूत्रम् means an elliptical / incomplete sentence ) and the

entire discussion in शब्दकौस्तुभ is about Panini not effecting सन्धि in अ इ उ ण् , -- ' संहिताविरहात् न यणादयः ’ is the

सिद्धान्त by Bhattojideekshita .

  

Another example from Panini's अष्टाध्यायी itself for not effecting सन्धि in a वाक्यम् (सूत्रम्) is - ' अल्पाच्तरम् ’ पा सू 2-2-34

Following this usages like -'अच्सन्धिः ’ (कौमुदी ) etc are accepted .

  

6\. Another logical fact is that if one speaks one or more sentences with सन्धि , it is very difficult to understand and

at the same time simple सन्धि is okay -- योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् (LIC) .

  

  

\(iii\) ............. as per the ancienttradition, the sentenceज्ञानं परमं ध्येयम् should be written as ज्ञानंपरमंध्येयम्
after performing the sandhi.......It was after the invention of printing press and under the influence of English/European grammarians the words ending with anuswara were written separately with space in between, even after performing the Sandhi. Thereforeज्ञानंपरमंध्येयम् to ज्ञानं परमं ध्येयम् is a relatively modern phenomenon

  

व्याकरणम् is, in fact ,concerned with speech rather than script - the script may change but the pronunciation should be the same .

And also in Sanskrit the script follows the speech (unlike English etc -- put - cut ) So , may be , the then writers were writing with सन्धि simply to reflect the सन्धि rules of Panini . There too विसन्धि is also correct . Punctuation marks were

not followed , may be, to save भूर्जपत्र-s and ताळपत्र-s .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
