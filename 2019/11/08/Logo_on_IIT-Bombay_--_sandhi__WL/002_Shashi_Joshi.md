Is the issue about spaces between words, or about म् converting to 'dot on top' ?

1.ज्ञानम् परमम्ध्येयम्

2.ज्ञानम्परमम्ध्येयम्

3.ज्ञानं परमं ध्येयम्

4.ज्ञानंपरमंध्येयम्

  

If it just an issue of space, many manuscripts have equal (or no) spaces between letters of the same or different words, like this one (गनेशायनमः: or जनमेजयउवाच )

Removal of all spaces (between words) may just be to save space (of writing material).

[Continuous script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptio_continua) was their in other parts of the world as well.

==> Adding spaces between words today is both good for readability and affordable paper-wise. So why not? With changing times, things change, simplifications happen, else everyone will be gaining from direct Vedas only, no need for itihAsa and purANas to be created (to simplify the mode of instruction for the same Vedic truths) or for any more vyAkaraNa text after pANini (no need for bhAShya or kaumudi) or any of the tadbhava words in regional languages.
