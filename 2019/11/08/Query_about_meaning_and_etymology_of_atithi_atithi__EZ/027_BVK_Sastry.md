Namaste



Thanks for taking note of the observation and pointing to the subtle issue involved.



*Your observation is correct* from the backdrop of Vedanga Jyotisha,
for ' kaala- gananaa' : to identify ' technical time unit of sun-moon difference measure ' . In this backdrop, 'tithi' is a technical coined term ( = paribhashaa) related to the observed position ("particular Sun and Moon state (स्थिति)". Yes, that is one specific technical explanation. This explanation of explaining a sky event related measure need not carry any connection to ' guest/ visitor/ traveler'.



*My response was a focus to view 'tithi- atithi -sthiti' word meanings and practical usage in broader context and discipline specificity for usage and respond to some of the points raised by RNI and others. ( I don't hold my view is the only view; I am subject to correction through inputs from learned people).*

**

 The term ' atiithi' has a standalone technicality across disciplines and usage without limiting it or seeking a compulsion to
connect it to 'Sun-Moon-Motion State' for 'tithi'.

 Word similarity alone should not be the ground to draw conclusions on what the terms communicate.



The term 'sthiti' has a connotation of different order, which can stand alone, based on the root ' sHTHaa' gati- nivuttau', which yields a larger spectrum of meaning than

'state'. The root meaning covers a bidirectional, dynamic movement and transitions related to action, activity, more specifically in yoga -practices.



 The Gita statement (2-72) reads : eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha, naināḿ prāpya vimuhyati sthitvāsyām anta-kāle ‘pi brahma-nirvāṇam ṛcchati

Here the term 'Brahmi sthiti' refers to a referential position by transit, an experiencing a state of consciousness. This is not static.

 There is a clear reference to one's own progressive journey to the process of reaching the state, staying in the state, potential possibility of returning/ reversing. 

There is no need to introduce the concept of 'guest' or 'time -measure connection'. 



 **Vedic resources**, as explained in Nirukta used the expression 'atithi' in a specific way, which seems to have been translated to a ground reality socio-cultural etiquette for

honoring the ' visitor/ invited / surprise guest'. atithi yajna is
a glorious human model to take care of the fellow humans on travel. 



 **Vedanga Jyotisha** explains 'atithi' in one more technical way
to mean 'tithi' measure lost due to the differences in motions of sun and Moon; There is no 'tithi' for that day.

The panchangam shows an entry 'atithi' to mean this
Time-Measure-Technicality. It is nothing to do with the guest.



 When 'atithi' of Vedanga Jyotisha - Lunar Time-Technicality occurs , what should the faithful performer do? It is a detailing in 'Dharma-Shaastra'. This also has nothing to do

with the ' guest'.



**The Dharma shaastra** usage of the term 'tithi' has a multiple
connotation and purpose , distinguishing (a) what to do on a given 'tithi' like amaavaasyaa, when to observe janmaashtami, when to perform 'tarpana' et al. This is a domain of ' aacharana -sampradaaya -samskaara', where Vedanga Jyotisha concept-technicality is drawn deep in to ground level ' karmaacharana'. Here it becomes a Cultural, sampradaya specificity. This is the kind of question which is in the background of narrative, where Acharya Shankara seems to have selected a specific day' to stand at the door step of Mandana-Mishra and seek ' Vaada-bhikshaa'. An interesting dialogue on aachaara-shradhhaa and karmaacharana, between Vedantin and Meemaamsaka.



Whether one observes a fasting on day 'a' or 'b', the body chemistry
may not show significant changes (?!) But observing 'fasting/ nirjal ekaadashi, how so ever strenuous, is considered to be ' punya-prada'; and connected to it is the 'dwaadashi -paarana'. Whether there is atitihi or not, the prescribed observation needs to be carried on the 'tithi- vaasara' (day of tithi).



Thanks and Regards

NamaskAr BVK Sastry ji,



 I think you missed the crucial point of the hypothesis that the word तिथि was coined to introduce the concept of "particular Sun and Moon state (स्थिति)". It is a kind of "abbreviation method".
