I checked the UNAdi sUtra ऊणादि सूत्र

And hence my comment, that a-tithi is a better explanation instead of at-ithin

  

How can a pratyaya be created for just one word creation? This truly seems like a retro fitting to explain vyutpatti of atithi. A force fitting.

  

Unless of course, something is missing in the puzzle. And that I would love to discover.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
