Dear Sri Shashi

UNAdi sUtra are evidently later than the Vedas. It would be worthwhile to understand how the word *atithi* has been used in RV and other texts. The word *atithi* occurs several times in RV:

In every occurrence, the meaning being guest, the context indicates one who comes or has come without prior appointment or date. Of course the force fit of *ithin pratyaya* yields the already known rUDhi meaning. But the important question would be what was meant by 'tithi' and whether this word was known to the Vedic people. Some main stream indologists (*e.g.*uncritical followers of Whitney, McDonnell, Keith, Eggeling, Pingree) would assert that *tithi*in the sense of 'date' was not known to Vedic people. The force fit uNAdi of PaNinians is a great relief and in fact a piece of historical evidence for them. I had raised the existence of the word and the ancient meaning of 'Tithi' (and indirectly atithi) long ago on BVP with no response.

Now, I will not go into all the details. The S'atapatha Br. (Maadhyandina and KaaNva) describes the First Flood coeval with the Matsyaavataara:

The Aita.Br. uses the word *tithi* in the sense of a particular ***situation***/***position/station*** of Moon and Sun. The Kaushitaki Br. in the same context in the same place uses the word '*sthitih'*. I have verified not only printed versions but also a few easily available manuscripts. However, in all cases the commentators (obviously post-PaNinian) have explained the text in terms of 'tithi' only. This is not the modern (1/30 of the synodic month) but a generic word like 'date' in English and ತಾರೀಕು (Persian *taarikh*) in Kannada, which means an unspecified date. In short, I believe*tithi* should have been the original pre-PaaNinian*rUDhi* word (in historical sense of antecedence /antiquity) for 'date' and by principle of negation *atithi*has been used in RV and other ancient texts.

Thanks
