Is the *ithin* pratyaya used in any other instance?  
Are there other words formed by it?

  

For atithi, Doesn't a-tithi (no prior appointment/tithi, and/or doesn't stay more than a tithi) seem a better derivation of the word, than at+ithin?

  

(I am venturing beyond what is held 'sacred' by shAstra tradition, but query is sincere.)

  
  

Thanks,
