Dear Dr.Chaitanya,

Your observation is welcome. What you call a conjecture seems to be at play in the origin of the word 'tithi'. I am not a linguist but metathesis appears to be a normal phenomenon. Traditional scholars may not like to comment on Vedic words beyond traditional grammar based etymology, leaving the field open for westernized narratives of "history of ideas of science & mathematics". तिथ (Titha) is an attested Sanskrit word too close to तिथि. This is listed in the TrikaaNDas'esha kos'a among eight wordsin the sense of 'Time'.

कालस्त्वपष्टुर्जहको भवन्तो भसदित्यापि\| पीयः पीतुः तिथश्चाथ वास्रो व्युष्टांशके दिनम् \|

However I have not come across 'titha' in the limited number of texts that I am familiar with. Since the field is too wide I would appreciate if someone can point out a textual usage for the word 'titha'.

  

Regards

RN Iyengar
