Namaste



It is interesting to see multiple constructions around the multivalent, technical Samskruth term ' tithi / atithi ' drawing usages across diverse contexts and word-breaking to disturb the integrity of meaning and grammar processes.



When a multivalent Samskruth technical term is stripped out of its context to construct the meaning to support a pre-drawn conclusion with a backdrop perception, the outcome can be made to connect 'anything to everything'. What one may be really interested to know is : How did the original users work with the term, what were they trying to communicate ? and How transitions of the text and explanation through time -tradition has created a medley of understanding.



The summary view i submit within my limits of understanding is the following. I am open to any further suggestions of correction on this perspective.



***Summary in my limits of understanding***: 



The term 'titihi', atithi, sthiti have clear distinct meanings and multiple multivalent context specific usages in ancient texts. One single meaning cannot be enforced to the usage of the term in all contexts and backdrops. The meanings and 'word-construction-processes' cannot be ported indiscriminately.

The term 'sthiti' occurring in Gita ( 2-72: एषा ब्राह्मी स्थितिः) cannot be ported enblock to the use of the same term/ in different vibhakti in Patanjali yoga-sutra (Tatra sthitau yatno abhyasa -1-13) . Nor can the term 'sthiti' be slackened and made to drop beginning 'sa' to yield an association with 'tithi' due to part-similarity of the term . Panini has given a clarity on atithi ( as Taddhita derivative : ४.४.१०४ पथ्यतिथिवसतिस्वपतेर्ढञ् ) which would be different from the term 'sthiti' which is a dhatu based krudanta.

Such exercises are breaking the primary rule of Paninian word construction as ' Integral output using the rules to unify the prakruti and pratyaya through prakriyaa.



Traditionalists would like to stay by ' Nirukta' for understanding the 'meaning of Vedic terms'; By Vedanga-Vyakarana of Panini for linguistic derivation; By Amara-kosha for classical literary usage; By technical discipline specific definition to understand discipline specific usage(= 'paribhashaa') ; By literary 'kaavya-prayoga' usage for conventional usage for poetic entertainment known as 'vinoda-karana'. 



1. The vedic term atithi is explained in Nirukta: Naigama Kanda - 4-5. According to this, atithi covers both invited ( by appointment) and unexpected visitor. (Image attached)

The vedic usage is explained in two specific contexts at 7-4; 14-29
for Surya and Agni at Nirukta :

Ref: <http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/3_pratis/niruktau.htm>



 This meaning is endorsed in Kurul also. (<https://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/stotra/acharyascall/bookview.php?chapnum=33> )



2. The technical term ' atithi' is detailed in Dharma-shaastra works as ' Observation / aachaara' to be observed in relation to an atithi.

The technicality of explanation can be gleaned from the lexicon listing -Vachaspatyam:
<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/VCPScan/2020/web/webtc/indexcaller.php>



3. The term 'titha' is a term of limited meaning \< तिथ : तिथ \[Cologne record ID=22748\] \[Printed book page 3290,b\] तिथ पु० तिज—थक् नि० जलोपः । १ वह्नौ २ कामे च सि० कौ० ३ काले त्रिका० । ४ प्रावृट्माले संक्षिप्तसा० ।\> . This does not cover or connect to technicality of tithi or atithi.



4. The Vedanga Jyotisha technical term 'tithi' is having multiple explanations and calculation methods for Saura, Chandra, Saavana for 'tithi-nirnaya'.

Mostly it is mathematical derivation to fix the time intervals and muhurtha.

 This discussion does not connect directly to ' cultural practice of dealing with a guest ( invited or accidentally, unannounced and arrived), though it connects to vratas.

The term 'tithi' is a technical for Vedanga Jyotisha, for the technical classification of Chandramana samvatsara as rutu- maasa- paksha -ayana- samvatsara.

 In Srimad Bhagavad-Gita , we have a clarity of 'tithi' based chandramana time. 

This has no link to ' guest' meaning overtones. (Gita: मासानां मार्गशीर्षोऽहमृतूनां कुसुमाकरः।।10.35।। 



5. The term 'tithi' in relation to 'athiti- explained as a guest, unexpected visitor ( = aagantuka, aksmaat aaagatah) surfaces on the narrow deliberation for 'Dharma-Shaastra' duty observation: should such an uninvited guest/ visitor, whose credentials and power are unknown ( or not assessed), presenting self before a household, the manner of treating a person who comes without an appointment, be honored or ignored or turned out. The question gets triggered by injunctions like ' athithi devo bhava (tiattiriya upanishad) and 'atithi-yajna as one of the pancha-maha-yajnas prescribed for observance. The issue is more on protocol of duty and formality, civic cultured conduct and human ethical behavior. ( See the Dharma-Vyadha story dialogue in Mahabharata; Durvasa visiting Sri Rama when he is in private conversation with Yama, a situation where in Lakshmana, as door keeper is supposed to have deliberated on 'atithi dharma; Mahabharata story where Sage Durvasa is said to have visited Pandavas as atithi seeking food for all his team).



6. The usage of ' tithi' in business documentation in the sense of ' date /transaction event reference' is a religion-business combine. such conventions are seen in ritual samkalpa, inscriptions and many places.
Many temple inscriptions carry such sentences to document the event.



7. Two more literary usages that may be further explored in this debate are from Kalidasa and Sri Harsha:



 “वैवाहिकीं तिथिं पृष्टास्तत्क्षणं हरबन्धुना” कुमा० **। ********“****निखिलान् निशि पूर्णिमा तिथीनुपतस्थे-ऽतिथिरेकिका तिथिः****”********नैष० ।******

Hnbhat B.R: November 18, 2019 1:15 AM - वाल्मीकिरामायणे 1.12.1 ।। ततः काले बहुतिथे कस्मिंश्चित् सुमनोहरे । वसन्ते समनुप्राप्ते राज्ञो यष्टुं मनो ऽभवत् ।। 1 ।।

सङ्ख्यासञ्ज्ञाद्बहुशब्दात् पूरणार्थे डटि "बहुपूगगणसङ्घस्य तिथुक्" इति तिथुगागमः । इति व्याख्यातारः।

K S Kannan: Nov 18, 2019: काले गते बहुतिथे मम सैव जाता, प्रस्थानविक्लवगतेर् अवलम्बनार्था (Kalidasa's S'Akuntala play, Act 5)



RNI : Nov 18, 2019: Dear Dr.Chaitanya, Your observation is welcome. What you call a conjecture seems to be at play in the origin of the word 'tithi'. I am not a linguist but metathesis appears to be a normal phenomenon. Traditional scholars may not like to comment on Vedic words beyond traditional grammar based etymology, leaving the field open for westernized narratives of "history of ideas of science & mathematics". तिथ (Titha) is an attested Sanskrit word too close to तिथि. This is listed in the TrikaaNDas'esha kos'a among eight words in the sense of 'Time'. कालस्त्वपष्टुर्जहको भवन्तो भसदित्यापि\| पीयः पीतुः तिथश्चाथ वास्रो व्युष्टांशके दिनम् \|

However I have not come across 'titha' in the limited number of texts that I am familiar with. Since the field is too wide I would appreciate if someone can point out a textual usage for the word 'titha'.



Vineet Chaitanya: November 14, 2019 : How about the following conjecture (triggered by Iyengarji's mail)? Since a word was needed to convey the concept of "the sense of a particular स्थिति/situation/position/station
of Moon and Sun so the word स्थिति was reversed and starting स् was dropped yielding तिथि.



RNI : Nov 14, 2019 : UNAdi sUtra are evidently later than the Vedas. It would be worthwhile to understand how the word atithi has been used in RV and other texts. The word atithi occurs several times in RV. ... In every occurrence, the meaning being guest, the context indicates one who comes or has come without prior appointment or date. Of course the force fit of ithin pratyaya yields the already known rUDhi meaning. **But the important question would be what was meant by 'tithi' and whether this word was known to the Vedic people.** Some main stream indologists (e.g. uncritical followers of Whitney, McDonnell, Keith, Eggeling, Pingree) would assert that tithi in the sense of 'date' was not known to Vedic people. The force fit uNAdi of PaNinians is a great relief and in fact a piece of historical evidence for them. I had raised the existence of the word and the ancient meaning of 'Tithi' (and indirectly atithi) long ago on BVP with no response. ... Now, I will not go into all the details. The S'atapatha Br. (Maadhyandina and KaaNva) describes the First Flood coeval with the Matsyaavataara. .... The Aita.Br. uses the word tithi in the sense of a particular situation/position/station of Moon and Sun. The Kaushitaki Br. in the same context in the same place uses the word 'sthitih'. I have verified not only printed versions but also a few easily available manuscripts. However, in all cases the commentators (obviously post-PaNinian) have explained the text in terms of 'tithi' only. This is not the modern (1/30 of the synodic month) but a generic word like 'date' in English and ತಾರೀಕು (Persian taarikh) in Kannada, which means an unspecified date. In short, I believe tithi should have been the original pre-PaaNinian rUDhi word (in historical sense of antecedence /antiquity) for 'date' and by principle of negation atithi has been used in RV and other ancient texts.



Shashi: Wednesday, November 13, 2019: I checked the UNAdi sUtra ऊणादि सूत्र. And hence my comment, that a-tithi is a better explanation instead of at-ithin. How can a pratyaya be created for just one word creation? This truly seems like a retro fitting to explain vyutpatti of atithi. A force fitting. Unless of course, something is missing in the puzzle. And that I would love to discover.
