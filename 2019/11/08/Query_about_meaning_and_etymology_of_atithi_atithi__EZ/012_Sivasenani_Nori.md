Shashi ji

  

Thank you for adopting a sympathetic approach.

  

The whole burden of my post is that there is a finality to Sastra. Could it be optimized? May be. Could it be more elegant? May be. But then, as Patanjali says in Mahabhashya, it will be apaaNineeya.

  

I can understand your angst about force-fitting. The word somehow sounds negative, but we need to realize that entire grammar is a force-fit of arbitrary rules (yes, arbitrary) rules upon usage. Only usage is true, all pratyayas are upaayas, as the Vaiyaakarana tradition itself asserts. Upaaya is a device that is abandoned after its purpose is served, like a scaffolding.

  

The doctrine of finality is that we cannot change settled things. And we don't wring our hands about it. It is what it is. Be it six sutras for one word, or one affix for one word. If a better system is possible, let it be presented - in toto.

  

Criticism needs to be a criticism of the complete system (not one part) and needs to offer an alternate system. For instance in the Sivasutras, if the extra ha is criticized, it sounds as if Sastra is sub-optimal but when an alternative is worked out, it is discovered that the present form of Sivasutras is the most efficient. Mere refutation without offering an alternative is anarchist.
