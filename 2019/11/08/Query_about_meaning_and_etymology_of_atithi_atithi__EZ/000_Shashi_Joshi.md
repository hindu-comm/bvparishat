Namaste vidvajjanAH.

  

The word atithi (as in atithidevo bhava), seems to mean a-tithi, one without a tithi, as in one who comes without a 'date', an appointment, unannounced.

  

Below, from shabdakalpadrumaH, it says the derivation is at+ ithin .

What does 'ithin' mean, and where else is it used?

  

Then, what is the derivation of 'tithi'?
