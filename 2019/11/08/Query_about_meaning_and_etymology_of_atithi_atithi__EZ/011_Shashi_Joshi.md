Sivasenani ji,

Dhanyavad for the time to elaborate.

  

I approach this topic with all sincerity and shraddhA, and only out of trying to understand the topic better.

  

Considering the UNAdi sutra and the grammar and Apta-j\~nAna etc. my point is this:

In the UNAdi sutra, it seems low productivity pratyaya-s are included. But if a pratyaya has only one word or two, can we call it really a pratyaya? In the sense, do we really need a pratyaya? Can't we then simply say that atithi itself is an atomic word, with no more derivation, either because it doesn't have (Apta shabda from antiquity) derivation, or it is not known. Calling -ithin an atomic pratyaya just to explain one word, seems a stretch, what I call a force-fitting, I must have a derivation, so I will find the dhAtu, and whatever remains is a pratyaya! If there are a bunch of words formed by the pratyaya in similar change in word meaning, then one can accept it.

  

This way, we can force fit any word into its derivations!

But when the vidvAn of yore give an explanation of derivation, was there something else that was too obvious for them, but not for us now, i.e. we lost a piece of information?

  

Also, atithi can be derived as a-tithi. Then why do we need to use the -itin pratyaya to derive atithi?

  

That was my point

It may seem I am stretching the point, but I am still not convinced except to accept it is Apta derivation, which I accept in lack of anything else.

  

  

**Another related doubt/concern I have is this.**

  

UNAdi 1.15 सृजेरसुम् च 6 rules are used to derive rajju from sRij.

The noun rajju doesn't seem to have any connection with the dhAtu sRij (what does a rope create?)

Then, is this derivation a forced/manufactured derivation to create the new word rajju OR rajju was already in use, and this derivation was used to *somehow*show that it can be derived using Panini sutras?

  

In first case, a new word was coined using the rules. Then why create a word in such a complicated way (6 rules applied), why not stop at 2 or 3 rules itself, and whatever word is derived after 2 rules, use that!

  

In second case, if the word rajju was already in use, then applying 6 rules to achieve its derivation, doesn't it seem a great way to solve a derivation puzzle, but people who were using the word, didn't create the word keeping 6 of Panini rules in mind (knowingly or unknowingly.).

  

I hope, I am making some sense to someone in communicating my issue, since written communication is asynchronous and devoid of verbal cues, I request members to forgive any communication errors and see the spirirt of my query.

  

Apologies for any perceived dhRiShTata.  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
