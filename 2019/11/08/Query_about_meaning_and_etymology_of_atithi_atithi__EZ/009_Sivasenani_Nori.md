While the position of Sriyuta Shashi Joshi is clear, the position of Sastras bears repetition, at least for those who want to know.

  

According to Nairuktas, all nouns (=substantives) are derived from verbs. VaiyaakaraNas have a more nuanced view. So, they say: not all, but only the regularly formed nouns can be derived from verbs.

  

The etymologist's job is to identify the root and give an explanation as to how a word is formed. If the process can be explained by Vyakarana, it is well and good; otherwise also, he presses ahead with this derivation. One example is that siMha is derived from hiMsa. Now there is no explanation for this metathesis in Vyakarana, but the Nirukta explanation stands. If pressed, a Nairukta would say, "Vyakarana is an ocean out of which only a fistful was presented to humanity by the Muni Panini. If you succeed in getting more of Vyakarana, you will see support for other transformations". This is the separation of domains of the two Sastra ("I have done my job, ask the VaiyaakaraNa to do his").

  

The VaiyaakaraNa provides derivations for as many words as possible. For the irregularly formed words, he has two devices. One is the uN and other affixes which are a category of low-productivity affixes. Others are clubbed in the prishodaraadi class where usage by SishTas is the only standard available.

  

Wherever a derivation sanctioned by Vyakarana is available, the same is followed. Since some Jainas do not accept Paninian framework, they give other explanations. For those who respect the Paninian framework, once a uN affix is given, that is the final derivation.

  

This discipline is not that of Sanskrit alone. It is common to all languages and sciences. Just imagine, someone says: "1,000,000,000 being called a billion (bi + million) does not sound right; since there are nine zeroes, it should be called nonillion". This would cause confusion. Nonillion denotes 10 raised to the power of 30 (a million raised by a thousand, nine times). The analysis is perfectly tenable but causes harm to interactions amongst people. So the Sastraic position is that either one system is accepted in total or abandoned in total. For instance, one could use 100 crore, if one dislikes a billion. Similarly once a derivation with proper prakriyaa is offered, those derivations without such a conformity to Sastra are rejected. Of course, rejection of Sastra itself is an option but then an alternative has to be identified (the Jains do have an alternative, though inferior, Vyakarana).

  

It is true that the analogy is about a word and not a derivation, but the distinction is that of a degree, not type. Westerners, in many instances (may be due to lack of exposure), while following all the arbitrary rules of their culture (say, dining etiquette) trample over the samaya of Sastra in India unthinkingly, or worse deliberately, in the name of critical thinking. A bit of reflection would show that to be uncritical and irresponsible - whether a Westerner does it or an Oriental.
