Dear Dr Nori,

I admire the analytic post. The question may really boil down to ask when does a "word" become "word."

In Bhatrhari's analysis, which I agree, a "word" is a blot of sound that is comprehended through perception.

This makes a first principle general statement that a piece of audible sound is processed to create perception.

The perception, if objective, can relate to the cause of the sound and its "meaning," It gets into philosophy

when we bring objectivity into perception.  

In this line of reasoning, a language accepts a piece of sound and makes a "word" out of it. However there is  

catch while we talk of human-generated sounds. Humans are conditioned biologically to create certain sounds,

which can be scientifically established. Though we do not know Panini's experiments he seems to validate a

set of sounds as empirically human. A scientific study on the completeness of his analysis is yet to be done.

But we can claim that all human produced sounds can be reduced to a combination of the sounds in the Panini  

set. This where is word etymology and word generation would come in.  

In this logic, we would have an initial trigger of all human produced sounds and that trigger would be called a

root. In reverse engineering, the grammarians have likely dissected the sounds to analytically discover the roots.

To find them scientifically through neurological processes is a challenge we have to overcome.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
