Shri Siva Prasad ji,  
Jai Shri Ram!  
There appears to be some confusion about "Gudartha Prakshka" since it is the earliest (Sanskrit) commentary available on the SS by Ranganatha, who was around at the time of the Mughal Emperor Jehangir!  
Bapu Dev Sastri, on the other hand, has translated the SS into English in late 19th century.  
With regards and Jai Shri Ram!  
A K Kaul
