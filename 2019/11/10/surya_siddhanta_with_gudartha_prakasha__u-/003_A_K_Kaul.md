Shri Shankaraji,

Jai Shri Ram!

The Surya Siddhanta translation by late Mahavir Prasad Shrivastav was initially published by Dr. Ratna Kumari Swadhyay Samsthan, Allahabad, in June 1987. I have a hard copy as well as a pdf copy of the same.

It is a very comprehensive/exhaustive commentary in Hindi and by far the best one available as on date.

It appears that it has become "out of copyright" now and that is how a new edition, including that of Ranganatha's commentary has been published.

There is also a pdf edition of Rangantaha's commentary together with Hindi translation of the SS shlokas only available.  

But with the original Allahabad edition of "Vigyan Bhashya" comprising 820 pages of demy octavo, and the SS by "Dr. Shri Krishan Jugnu" having 1048 pages in PaRT-I only, it appears this edition contains Hindi translation of Ranganatha's commentary as well!

That will really be helpful to the readers.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
