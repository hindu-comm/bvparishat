Namaste Shankara



    My understanding on what you are seeking in connection to : < का क्षतिरम्ब कटाक्षे न्यस्ते सति मयि विरिञ्चिवरपत्नि । गङ्गाशुनकन्यायान्महती मम वृद्धिरीरिता निपुणैः ॥ २४७॥

One guess that can be hazarded is: the dog is considered to be unclean. However much it is immersed/bathed in the Ganga, its innate unclean nature can't be remedied. > 



**The context ( as a story back drop to understand the nyaya)** : It is ( or rather was) a belief that the touch of a dog after is polluting; and one has to go and have a bath once more. It is also a faith that more number of times one takes a dip in 'Ganga', the ' punya accumulation ' increases. 



A devout person was taking a bath in 'Ganga' and while coming out, ( for whatever reason), a dog used to chase him and touch; causing a ' a-shuchi' demanding a 'punah snaanam'- once again forced dip in Ganga. This seems to have happened a few times , forcing the devout person to have several dips in Ganga, before getting freed from the dog-touch! This was the situation for a reconciliation leading to the statement : Does not matter why the dog touched me several times; it has been for my good only (मम महती वृद्धि:) . Had this not happened, I would have walked out with one dip in Ganga ( and to that extent, One dip
equivalent of Punya). Now, because of dog, i have accumulated more Punya.



Hope this helps to comprehend the aesthetic sense of the 'Nyaya'. Hope it also helps to disconnect the translation-hazard connection of ' it' to ' dog' and 'dog's unclean status'. It is ' मम ' - the devout persons reconciliation.

This also takes out 'dog connection to sage 'Shaunaka'!
