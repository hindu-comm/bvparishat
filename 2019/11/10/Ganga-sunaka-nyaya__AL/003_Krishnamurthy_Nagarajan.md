Namaste Shankara-ji,

  

I don't know if I am off the mark but stumbled upon an interesting information in the following link (Page 269 - PDF P/322) of the book "The Mystery of the Mahabharatha - The Explanation for the Epic Part I (Vol.IV) by N.V. Thadani).  

  

[https://ia801608.us.archive.org/16/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.95927/2015.95927.The-Mystery-Of-The-The-Mahabharatapt1vol4.pdf](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.95927/page/n321)

  

It says "The word Saunaka is derived from Sunaka and Sunaka (Su, Na, Ka) means "(su) going from (na) the senses of Knowledge, the basis of Nyaya, to (ka) God".

  

With regards,

Nagarajan K.
