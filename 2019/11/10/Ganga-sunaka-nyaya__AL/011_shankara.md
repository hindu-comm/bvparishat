Sastry ji,

  

The story in itself is good. But, I fedl that it doesn't suit the context. The poet would not even think of comparing 'the glance of the Goddess Sarada' to impurity caused by the contact with a dog.

  

I am satisfied with the explanation provided earlier in this thread based on the verses from Sristava, Saundaryalahari and Saranagatidipika. The glance of the Goddess would bring महती वृद्धिः to the poet while it would cause no क्षति to the Goddess as in the case of a dog drinking water from the Ganga.  

  

regards  
shankara
