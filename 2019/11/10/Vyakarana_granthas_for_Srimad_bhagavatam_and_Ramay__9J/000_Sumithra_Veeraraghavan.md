Do we have any vyakarana granthas for Srimad Bhagavatam and Sriamad Ramayanam ? I heard there are books called Govindarajeeyam and Veeraraghaveeyam for these.

  

Can someone suggest where I can get these and if any other granthas are available. Even if it is simple Sanskrit commentary format that is fine.

  

I have joined Acharya in Puranethihasa at RSVP tirupati. Looking for a proper commentary text along with Vyakaranam if available to learn properly.
