Respected sumithra ji ,

  It's fine to know that you joined in RSVP in Puranetihasa.

  As I know reading Ramayana and Bhagavatam via vyakaranam is a better thought.

  I accept that reading via vyakaranam gives a greater possibility to understand the texts but Being Bhagavatam is a TATTVA PRADHANA GRANDHA the help of vyakaranam have some extent to understand the text but not full understanding of the text.

 Even understanding of bhagavatam is not an easy task also. There are some groups in whatsapp and telegram for bhagavatam and ramayanam. If you have an interest you may join them.

  

The Ramayanam group of Telegram :

  

<https://t.me/learn_sanskrit_through_rAmAyaNam>  

  

It's started recently only .

  

Whatsapp groups

  

1\. Learn Ramayana :

2\. Learn Bhagavatam :

  

<https://chat.whatsapp.com/CB8fWmk96SY7neu5jqXsXY>  

  

In both these groups everyday one chapter for parayana will be placed from the available online audio resources.

  

After the completion of parayana they are planning to tell the meaning of every sloka of bhagavatam also.

  

If you are interested you are invited to join .

  

Thank you.
