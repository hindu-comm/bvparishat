Words defy our expression of joy that we experienced witnessing the show. It was a wonderful presentation of the story of Ashtavakra with a lot of value adds so intelligently woven into the theme. The Sanskrit dialogues were full of beauty of the language and embellishments. Kannada too was used in good measure to bring out the song sequences. A variety of compositions that formed part of the show mesmerized the audience. The effects of ocean, royal procession, with elephant, stole the hearts of young and old alike. A special mention needs to be made about the Vasanta Rtu effect, The various aspects of the kusumaakara were brought out so tellingly that one scene of just a few seconds with birds in the sky and peacock dancing on the ground struck awesome chords in the hearts of the audience. Smt. Anupama Hoskere of 'Dhaatu' and her team, mostly her entire family and a few others, did a splendid job of 'pulling the strings'. Their dedication to puppet theater is something unimaginable and worthy of all accolades. Dr.S.R.Leela who has penned the dialogues, the story script and the direction deserves all our praise. She has packed into the story a lot of values for all stages of people. A poet, a dramatist, a scholar of great learning and passion for Sanatana Dharma could be seen expressing herself so well. Veda mantras, especially from the Taittiriya, the 'वेदमनूच्याचार्योऽन्तेवासिनमनुशास्ति सत्यं वद, .....' was also a part of the sequence.

  

Aksharam, where Samskrita Bharati functions at Bangalore in Girinagar, has now a well renovated, acoustics treated auditorium where the show was staged. Dr.Leela's financial contribution to that theater is laudable. She has always felt the need for a well equipped hall which alone can bring out the effects of a performance in all its glory. And this hall is now the answer to that need. Music and dance have their abundant share in the Ashtavakra show.

  

It was a sight to be wondered at where hundreds of parents brought their children who enjoyed the show. The hall was packed and many were enabled to witness the show from screens set up outside the hall too. I thank the entire Dhaatu team, Dr.Leela and the Samskrita Bharati to have hosted this show. Institutions must come forward to host this show and Dhaatu will only be too happy to do this.
