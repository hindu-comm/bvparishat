It is important to understand why this manuscript played an important role. The Muslim litigants cited Marxist historians like Supriya Verma and Sushil Shrivastava to the effect that the Ayodhya Mahatmya of the Vaishnava Khanda of this Purana was written in the 19th century, or at the earliest, in the 18th century. Producing a manuscript predating this claimed late date clinched the issue. Even after the SC Judgment, Romila Thapar now writes in The Hindu that the SC delivered a 'flawed judgment based on faith, and depending in archaeological evidence that is contested by other archaeologists and historians." No limits of shameless-ness of these Marxists, whose duraagraha is the cause of thousands of lives lost. And some of our list members have contributed articles for her festschrift and in volumes edited by her.

  

I have a copy of a Pada by Baba Shrichand (the long lived elder son of Guru Nanak) lamenting that the Ram Janmasthan, Kashi Visvanath and Krishna Janmabhoomi have become Masjids (as for the last, he refers to the earlier destruction in the 15th century by Delhi Sultans in Mathura). A tell tale passage from the 16th century that could have been produced as additional evidence by the Hindu party but now it is not needed. I can attach a scan if the list members would like to read it.  

  

In this connection, I recall an email exchange with Indologist Robert Zydenbos around 15 years ago. I had pointed to an inscription unearthed from the walls of the Babri clearly mentioning that a temple to Vishnu Hari who had vanquished the 10 headed Ravana stood there. When I stated that the inscription was genuine, he replied, "Of course, you can get someone from Nagpur (= RSS HQ) to say that the inscription is genuine but scholars cannot believe that." Hatred clearly clouds one's judgment! Suffice it to say that over 100 epigraphists from all over the world have examined it and have declared to be a genuine inscription. This same Indologist was caught on a Yahoogroup controlled by us posting messages under a fake Indian name in 2005-2006.
