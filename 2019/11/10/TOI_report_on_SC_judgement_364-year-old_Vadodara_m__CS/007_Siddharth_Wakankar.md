Shri Vishal ji,

  

Many thanks for this illuminating piece of information.

  

What the BJP or Hindus do is against human rights and what their staunch opponents,blinded by wrong ideas,is secularism.

  

I think, Britishers poisoned our ears and decided to leave the country because our Indian intellectuals misunderstand or fail to understand the correct meaning of certain words or terms and kill the spirit,which they wanted.

  

I may be wrong,but,many hold the same view.

  

Your post should open the eyes of the intellectuals and they should try to see the reality with a cleared eyesight.

  

Thanks and kind regards.

  

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
