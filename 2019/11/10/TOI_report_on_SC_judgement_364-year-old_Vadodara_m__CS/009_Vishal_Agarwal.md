In case the entire book does not go through the list (due to attachment size restrictions), I am attaching the relevant pages.

Please see attached, page 103 of the book. Baba Shrichand died at Chamba around 1645 CE. The references to the Janmasthan of Krishna and Rama in his Pada are very specific as he clearly mentions that the Mandirs on these spots were demolished and Masjids erected, as is the statement that Vishvanath entered the well (Gyanvapi).Note that the Krishna Janamasthan and Vishvanath temples were earlier demolished during the Sultanate period too, but were re-constructed, and then re-demolished by Aurangzeb. The Ramajanmabhoomi temple was never rebuilt. His references are therefore to the pre-Aurangzeb desecration and destruction. According to the Sikh tradition, Baba Shrichandra, the elder son of Guru Nanak (the younger son Lakhmi Chand became a householder and his descendants still live in Dehradun and elsewhere) became a Sadhu and founded the Udasi Sampradaya. He was extremely long lived, and met with the fifth and the sixth Gurus as well. The latter gave his son to Baba Shrichand's service. Swami Totapuri (who figures in narratives of Swami Ramakrishna Paramahamsa) and Swami Virajanand (the teacher of Swami Dayanand Sarasvati) were both Udasis.

  

If someone has access to the Hindu attorneys who fought the case for Ram Lala, please forward it to them and feel free to publicize. I have tried a lot to obtain the rare printed editions of Baba's works but without success and it is my understanding that most of them are still in the form of manuscripts in the Udasi Deras and Akharas. I might have to ask someone in Amritsar to help with the printed editions or go there myself during my next trip (as my mother also wants to visit Kartarpur Saheb).
