The evidence quoted by Sri Vishal in his mail is a relevant evidence to be preserved, if it was not already presented to the court.

  

" I have a copy of a Pada by Baba Shrichand (the long lived elder son of Guru Nanak) lamenting that the Ram Janmasthan, Kashi Visvanath and Krishna Janmabhoomi have become Masjids (as for the last, he refers to the earlier destruction in the 15th century by Delhi Sultans in Mathura). A tell tale passage from the 16th century that could have been produced as additional evidence by the Hindu party but now it is not needed. I can attach a scan if the list members would like to read it.  

  

In this connection, I recall an email exchange with Indologist Robert Zydenbos around 15 years ago. I had pointed to an inscription unearthed from the walls of the Babri clearly mentioning that a temple to Vishnu Hari who had vanquished the 10 headed Ravana stood there. When I stated that the inscription was genuine, he replied, "Of course, you can get someone from Nagpur (= RSS HQ) to say that the inscription is genuine but scholars cannot believe that."

  

Though the case appears to be closed, it is always important to have more evidence to shut the mouths of our intellectuals and to avoid any future litigation. In fact, a study of the documents of the East India company records, etc is also needed to know whether any

mention of this subject.
