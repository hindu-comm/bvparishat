Here are some details about the genesis of this work 'khyati tattva samikshanam':

  

Vidwan Sri Umakantha Bhatta was Principal of the Govt. Sanskrit College, Melukote, Karnataka.  

  

The work was written more than 10-15 years ago at the request of vidvAn UmAkAnta BhaTTa for the periodical 'ChhandasvatiI' (Chandasvati prakashanam, L 89, Rajaveethi, MelukoTe, Karnataka).

  

25 shloka-s each were published in two volumes.

  

After a long gap, the rest of the shloka-s were written to complete the work, again on the request of aforesaid VidvAn.
