As perवेदपति मिश्र (1970): "व्याकरण वार्त्तिक - एक समीक्षात्मक अध्ययन", आमुख, पृ॰7, there are a total of 4280 vaarttikas in the mahAbhASya, out of which 3870 are those of Acarya Kaatyaayana's.

I think, there is a book published by BORI, that contains the collection of all the vaarttikas. But I cannot remember the exact title.

Best wishes.

Narayan Prasad
