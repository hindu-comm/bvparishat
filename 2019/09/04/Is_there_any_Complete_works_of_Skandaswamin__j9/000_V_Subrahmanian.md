Here is some information about Skandaswamin:

                                  //
Skandaswämi (around CE 630)  
  
Skandaswämi was a resident Valabhi, capital of Gujarat. Skandaswämi was the guru of Hariswämi, the famous commentator of Satapatha Brähmana. Skandaswämi is considered a contemporary of King Harshavardhana, Poet Bäna, Pulakesi II or Satyäsraya.  
  
The oldest available commentary on Rgveda Samhitä is by Skandaswämi. His commentary of Rgveda is very lucid, and ritualistic, it is therefore treated with great respect. He has furnished the details of the rshis, devatäs and chandas at the beginning of each süktam, and has quoted from Anukramanis, Nighantu, Niruktam and other Vedic texts, and has presented few grammatical aspects here and there. As per Venkatamädhava (tenth-eleventh century), this Rgveda Samhitä Bhäshya was collectively written by Skandaswämi, and two of his contemporaries, Näräyana and Udgitha (both around CE 630). Skandaswämi commented up to fourth ashtaka, and Näräyana and Udgitha commented on the remaining four ashtakas. This commentary is the oldest and authoritative, and influenced Säyana’s commentary. Skandaswämi’s tikä on Yäska’s Nirukta is not available.//  

  

Is there any authoritative account of Skandaswamin's complete works? A friend says there is a commentary of this ancient author for the 'Ganesha Tapini Upanishad.' I would like to know if this work is documented anywhere?

  

Thanks and regards
