Thanks Shankara ji for this information. I shall check this dipika. In the pdf 'Upanishadaam samuccayah' 32 upanishads with Dipika-s of Narayanasrama and Shankarananda are there but neither ' Ganesatapinyupanishad nor Varadopanishad' is there. Maybe this Narayana commenting on the Varadopanishad is a different one.
