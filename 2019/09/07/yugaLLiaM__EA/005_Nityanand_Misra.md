One can add the root ध्रु गतिस्थैर्ययोः (६.१३५) to this list.

  

From this root we get the word *dhruva*which means both (1) moving, going (2) stationary.

  

For the former meaning, one can refer Baladeva Vidyabhusahana’s commentary on the name *dhruva* in the Vishnu-sahasranama. The latter meaning is well-known, e.g. the त्यब्नेर्ध्रुव इति वक्तव्यम् (वार्त्तिक ४.२.१०४) uses *dhruva* in the sense of eternal/stationary etc.
