The discussion on the word “yōgyatā” was quite interesting.

In Malayalam, there is a Sanskrit tatsama word “yugaḷaṃ” meaning a pair or couple. Another word “yukti” means that which is rational or logical as in yuktivādi meaning a rationalist. The word can also mean a (wise) strategy. Yet another word “yōjyaṃ” means suitable. “Yōgyata” (Malayalam normally avoids long vowels in word final position) actually means suitableness, qualification etc., in Malayalam. The intransitive verb "yōjikku" can mean to agree, to join etc., and the transitive verb "yōjippikku" can mean to cause to join. All these words are used in everyday informal speech also. I believe all these words derive from the Sanskrit root “yuj”, to join. Interesting that such widely differing meanings as “pair” and “suitableness” derive from the same root that has yet another meaning.
