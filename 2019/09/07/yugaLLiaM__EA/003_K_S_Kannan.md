The senses of "pair" and "suitableness" are not, indeed, two (too) contradictory senses.

"Can two walk together except they be agreed?"

They pair together for they indeed have parity.

(As a contrary corollary, utter disparity may lead to utter despair, too!)  

All the senses you mentioned, possibly straight from a Malayalam dictionary,

are all semantic derivations from the same root *yuj.*

*  
*

But then, it is not only politics that makes strange bedfellows;

even grammar does! Whence the exclamation :

*s'vAnam yuvAnam maghavAnam Uce!*

(- lacing together the dog, the youth, and Indra).
