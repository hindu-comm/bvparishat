During the vedic era, our rishis lived with Prakriti, it was symbiotic. Both coexisted and lived in harmony with each other. Our seers respected Her, not just mere words, but the very life that they led.

I don't know whether there is concrete evidence of that sustainable life, but it can be inferred? through the oral literature they passed on.

  

That concrete evidence can certainly be found in practical yoga, whose foundation demands living a natural life in sync with Prakriti along with the yamas and niyamas.

  

Now the paradigm has shifted to modern science and technology trying to control Prakriti, to exploit her to the fullest, and to supposedly improve her created designs.

  

We can stop the collapse on paper, but is it kaliyuga fulfilling it's own prophecy ? which is why despite knowing what needs to be done, it will never get done.
