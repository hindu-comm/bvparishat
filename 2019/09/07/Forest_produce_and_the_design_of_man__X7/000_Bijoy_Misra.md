Friends,

  

It is not easy to analyze why the man was created. Normally nothing should

exist unless it can survive. Life needs an environment for its sustenance.

The question has come if the man was designed to eat animals, to which I have

had serious reservations. Animals are created to live on other animals, but

it did not appear to me that such would be the design of man because of the

need for man to sustain a brain, Food is of course need-based, the creation of  

man should be assumed as a function of availability of provisions around.

  

To experiment if the land would give nourishment to survive I planted various  

fruit and berry trees many years ago in my home in Lincoln, MA. Lincoln is an

old farm town that lived on agriculture at the time of American Revolution.

The Minute Men Army formed in the town. Walden of Thoreau fame overlaps

the town with the neighboring town of Concord. In my plot, I planted peach,  

apple, pear, blueberry and nut trees as well as some grape vines. After ten  

years, the plants are producing fruits. I can imagine what the Vanaras might  

have witnessed when they entered Madhuvana. The ripe fruit has a tendency  

to come low (weight and gravity) and be accessible to a human frame. It could  

appear that the food is served for the man.

  

The question is what is man's natural habitat. Is man's brain designed to

be creative for protection against heat and cold or to help sustain the universe?

In urban societies, we are so much divorced from nature that we rarely even breathe

clean air and drink clean water. Our life and living do appear to be very different

than what the design likely is and might continue to be. One may think how much  

आरोपित is there in our own thinking of making our own life and how did the natural

human object transform itself to become alien of nature. It is the difference between

a tree that gives fruits and the man who cuts the tree. Is it a part of evolution!

  

Sorry for this digression from the discussion of grammar and
literature..
