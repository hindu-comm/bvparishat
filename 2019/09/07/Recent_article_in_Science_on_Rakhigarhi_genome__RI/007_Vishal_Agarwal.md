Please see attached the spreadsheet with the raw data. The Bihar Bhumihars had the highest Central Steppe proportion and it is precisely this group whose Brahmana status was in question even during British times. The category itself is colonial and it subsumes the Shakadvipi community. And then, you have the Tiwaris of Mathura; or Brahmanas of Nepal (often immigrants from areas directly in the path of invasions; who eventually fled to Nepal). Look at the communities missing in Table 5, the sample sizes, the anomalies (e.g. Chamars scoring higher on Central Steppe genes than several other communities, small sample size noted) and so on. There is a 'Baniya' and also a 'Baniyas' plus 'Agarwal'.

  

People can draw their own conclusions. The Statistician in me would not like to draw too many conclusions, or extrapolation to modern times. The study might be comprehensive compared to past studies, but they are not comprehensive enough to capture the past or the present diversity of Indians, or the social/spatial mobility of communities.

  

No wonder Quickie Indologist and the Greatest Scholar Ever named Steve Farmer is so bombastic on the claims :-)
