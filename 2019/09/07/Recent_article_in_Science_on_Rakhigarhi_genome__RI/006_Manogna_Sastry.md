Namaste!

  

Please find below Megh Kalyanasundaram and my initial response to the recently (Sep 5, 2019) published paperAn Ancient Harappan Genome Lacks Ancestry from Steppe Pastoralists or Iranian Farmers([doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.048](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.048)), from the point of view of the Aryan problem. (Some of our work on the Aryan problem can be seen[here](https://www.academia.edu/40037600/Aryan_problem_from_the_perspective_of_Textual_Evidence_and_Linguistics_Aug_02_2019_)and[here](https://www.academia.edu/38556391/The_A_of_ABC_of_Indian_chronology_Dimensions_of_the_Aryan_problem_revisited_in_2017))

  

1.This paper assumes the validity of the PIE enterprise as though it is some unshakable fact/truth and a proven hypothesis. Not only does it not recognise the criticism of PIE’s supposed historicity, Indo-European theory (from some linguists themselves) but it also does not recognise that the initial chronological epoch (of \~2000 BCE) attributed to the so-called migration that supposedly brought the earliest form of today's Sanskrit to India cannot be, according to some linguists themselves, deduced from linguistic methods alone (such as the comparative method, for example). This is critical because, if historical linguistics can yield no absolute chronology data, at least one important question follows: which domain/s established the \~2000 BCE epoch in the first place, which is supposed to have been further validated by this genetics paper?

2. Having assumed the validity of PIE and the epoch of \~2000 BCE, it subscribes to a questionable conflation of language with haplogroup as though it is absolutely scientific. This conflation has come under scrutiny from several experts and assuming the equivalence between language and haplogroup is deeply significant, considering the consequences involved, as seen in this paper itself.

3. Thereafter, using haplogroup as a proxy for language, it claims, using genetic method, to have disproven one majorlinguistics-relatedhypothesis: the so-called Anatolian hypothesis.

4. Disproving the so-called Anatolian hypothesis is then assumed to be sufficient to have proven the so-called Steppe hypothesis because this is underpinned by another questionable assumption: that the only possible candidates are either the so-called Steppe or Anatolian(while ignoring other possibilities, including but not limited to OIT). Since Anatolian is proven wrong, therefore, by elimination (and by elimination alone), Steppe has been taken to be true. Refer in the paper, on page 6,

5. In light of 1-4 above, it is our view that using this paper to make absolute statements1on some of the key stakes involved in the Aryan problem, i.e the origin of Sanskrit and Vedas, is based on assumptions which are highly questionable at best and completely riddled with methodological fallacies.

6. In fact, the above paper lends credence to our thesis that the mainstream chronology that underpins these and other milestones, as explained in our ABC framework2, is internally inconsistent and inherently on infirm ground.

1As seen in the following tweet by Tony Joseph on 9 September, 2019: "Read it carefully. What is proven is that Indo-European languages such as Sanskrit reached India from the Steppes after 2000 BCE"[https://twitter.com/tjoseph0010/status/1170922518082752512?s=20](https://twitter.com/tjoseph0010/status/1170922518082752512?s=20)
