Tried to access the recent article "The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia" by Vagheesh Narasimhan et al published in the journal Science \[Sept 6, 2019\], but could not get access to it through the University of Michigan Library. I am wondering if someone has downloaded this article and can share with me. Thanks.
