 There was, in some places still is a tradition of teaching Sanskrit as part of a PG course in regional Indian literature. Gradually students who are looking for ways of easily receiving the degrees for career advantages are finding inclusion of such courses an unnecessary burden imposed on them. But we need to make them realize that for a teacher and student of classical literature in regional Indian languages, background in Sanskrit and shaastras is at least as important as the background in classicsand classical works in Greek and Latin for the students of classicist or neo-classical works if not all works in the modern European languages.
