It's genuinely surprising that the naked ear can't hear the great possibilities of cross-enrichment when classical literature in regional languages is studied in parallel with Sanskrit. Greek and Latin, while valuable (inasmuch as any developed civilisation is valuable), seem far more remote from Indian regional languages than Sanskrit. This is why, when I heard in your speech that Sanskrit and traditional disciplines are being dropped, I thought that it could be some political shenanigans directed at undermining university education. Otherwise why aim for the far removed weird and wonderful, having left unattended the most intimate connections. But now it's clearer what's going on.
