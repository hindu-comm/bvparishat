Namaste Prof. Nagaraj ji,

  

I'd left a comment on this video in the earlier uploads at Gurukul Prakalp. Here it is just, FYI:

  

Sir, unfortunately, some traditional Gurukulas have tied up with the Universities and while implementing the latters' syllabus to bring "modern value" to their teachings, they have dropped some Nyaya, etc, as well! I'm sure you all at Indic Academy know that the reason as to why (under what kind of influence) the University syllabi have dropped shAstras needs to be fixed as well, for this Gurukula-University effort to be more successful. Congratulations and thanks for all your effort. 

  

Kind rgds,
