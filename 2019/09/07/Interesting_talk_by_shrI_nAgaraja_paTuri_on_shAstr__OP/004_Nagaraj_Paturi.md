Each university has its procedures.

  

Some universities give greater autonomy to the respective faculty members teaching the course. In most universities , even where the respective faculty members prepare /design their own course, the departmental committees, Boards of Studies, Academic Councils etc. play a role.

  

But all this is purely procedural.

  

The actual starting point is usually a pressure from the students themselves.

  

Gradually the grammars of classical version of languages like Telugu and Kannada have been felt to be 'tough' by some students and the departments had to yield to the pressure and make those courses optional in some places and completely removed in some other places.

  

When Prof. Sheldon Pollock, during his visit to India was interviewed by news papers about his response to the classical status accorded to Kannada, Telugu etc., commented that the number of scholars capable of teaching classical texts in these languages itself is coming down. Though his opinion is exaggerated because there still are many classical Kannada and classical Telugu scholars (more of them in high schools, junior colleges and undergrad colleges than in the post-graduate colleges or universities or sometimes even outside the formal educational institutes), but the state of affairs is gradually moving towards making such exaggerations true. This is another reason for removing / reducing classical literature content from the post-graduate syllabuses. Same is the case with the teaching of Alankara Shastra at the regional literature departments.

  

In the early days of founding of these regional literature departments, the teachers had sound background in Sanskrit, shaastras including alankaara shaastra. They were able to teach classical literature in regional languages, grammars of classical language which had strong foundation in Sanskrit vaiyaakaraNa tradition, alankaara shaastra etc. easily and very well. But gradually teachers in the regional literature departments coming from such backgrounds decreased. This resulted in a pressure from both teacher and student side in removing /reducing these courses.

  

There were what were called oriental colleges where courses like UbhayabhaashaapraveeNa with strong foundation in Sanskrit and the regional language were taught. Students with these degrees used enter PG departments and universities as students of PG cvourses. They were capable and were prepared to receive courses on classical literature in regional languages, grammars of classical language , alankaara shaastra etc. Gradually these colleges are getting closed and the number of such students is coming down.

  

There are many such reasons for the present state of affairs.

  

We have to wake up before the exaggerations become true.
