"In short, much more work is needed and then analyzed with much greater sophistication and rigor before sweeping conclusions as in this paper are drawn."

  

Much work is needed only for those who feel,a) what ever is presented by the authors is inaccurate., b) new or existing data does not agree with the conclusions,and c) some of the assumptions are not correct.

  

In my opinion, there exists till today a big divide between the peoples of theeastand the west in fields other than science and engineering disciplines.

  

In the fields of linguistics, ,culture, sociology,anthropology,archeology,philosophy and mythology the western scholars draw a red line around Arab. The western scholars simply do not care not because they do not respect eastern culture but because they are simply overwhelmed.

  

The easternislamic invaders settled in parts of India and played the game of raja dharma and attempted to annex kingdoms but left people to practice their own belief systems as long as they can and give taxes(jijia).

The westerners did not invade India because they had very little in common with the east and again as already mentioned had no intrinsic interest to settle down in the east.

  

The western society till today acts in the principle of divide and rule, weaken others by denigrating their ways and practices. Demolish best practices of the cultures and rule by "adharma".

  

That way a tiny country England colonised the entire globe until the
people of the east woke up and got united to essentially throw the outsiders back to their own countries. Note that the eastern invaders adopted India to be their own land and fought against the foreigners.  

  

What happened in parallel is that the basic knowledge of India in its Vedas, Upanishads and the Shastras became known to few intellectuals in the west. To their astonishment , they found that their own languages and understanding of the inner human nature, like mind, atma, adwaita ( tat tuam asi, thou art you etc) are not as advanced as that of the east.

  

They then hurdled to apply again their philosophy of divide and rule. They divided the human race into a superior Aryan race and the rest non-Aryan race, The consequence of such a caused havoc and unimaginable loss of life in not too distant a past.

  

In reality, people lived in various parts of the world. To start with in mountains and forest along with other evolving beings ( Nara and Banara, Sura and Asura etc. Then the humans found it easier to sustain their lives in the river banks which are relatively free from attacks from the wild animals. With time different regions developed sophisticated lifestyles and together advanced human knowledge and wellbeing.

It is important to stay away from divisionary thoughts and work together to understand each other's languages and mannerisms. Fortunately there are a lot in common with various parts of India than differences and that fact will help in the further development of knowledge.

  

East needs to open up its eyes and hearts and say no more and walk on their own soil without the incessant feeling to be accepted by the west. At the same time learn the good things(advanced science and technology) from the west and shed away the varna system altogether which is unconstitutional.

  

With best wishes

Deva
