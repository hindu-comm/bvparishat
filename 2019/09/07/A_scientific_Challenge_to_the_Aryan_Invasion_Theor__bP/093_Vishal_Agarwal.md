So you are trying to tell me something equivalent of how the casteists in N India say to those of lower castes,

  

"Ahsaan-pharaamosh! Apni aukaat mein rah aur zyaada dimaag mat chalaa") \[Ungrateful man, know your place and do not tax your brain on matters beyond your understanding\].

  

Do your realize that your posts on this controversy are exactly the material that editors of publications like 'Dalit Voice' or 'Dalit Freedom Network' like to quote?
