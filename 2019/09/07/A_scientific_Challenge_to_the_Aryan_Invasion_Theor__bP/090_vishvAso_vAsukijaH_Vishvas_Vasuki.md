Courting punaruktidoSha here, but what can one do when post after post keeps beating the same drum:  

  

That's because we've ceded that space to them! It is precisely because patriotic Hindu AIT discourse basically died of neglect and fancy in the past few decades that we have some inimical dravidianist / Christian / Muslim commentators dominating the popular imagination and the papers.  
  

There is ultimately nothing really deadly to Hindus in AIT and nothing nutritious in OIT - it is just what one makes of it. Certain people will aim to thoroughly destroy us no matter what - it is foolish to think that rejecting the best scientific research and supporting alternative fantasies is going to change any of that.
