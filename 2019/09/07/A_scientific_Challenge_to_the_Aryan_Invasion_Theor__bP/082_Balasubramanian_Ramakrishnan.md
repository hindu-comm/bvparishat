Well, for a complete equivalent, if they were speaking English with at most 30% Anglo Saxon genes (presumably in Alabama and KKK circles!) and 70% Native American genes, then we would have an equivalent, no? And that it is indeed the crux of the problem. The original idea was that Aryans came and destroyed everyone and imposed their culture same as Anglo Saxons. Now that there is no proof of any such thing, there is argumentation all around. Not that AIT or AMT is incorrect because of this. Just a comment.
