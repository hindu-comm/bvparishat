You were not mocking "brAhmaNa-s like me", but vedic sages themselves. That's like spitting at the sun itself (as the shruti says - "आदि॒त्यम् ए॒व ते परि॑वदन्ति॒"). You might fool yourself into thinking that you are in every way better position than them (or for that matter myself) - but as always time will be the ultimate judge of how your lineage will fare. We misunderstand the lives and times of our sages and heroes at the prime of our civilization at our own risk - not only will we not reach their heights, we won't even manage to hold it together against the enemies of today - so no "avada kadavra" required. Same at the individual level.

Well, isn't the vocabulary of your taunts quite pitifuly limited ("virile", "brAhmaNas", "alpha male"). Anyway, in India there are multiple AA branches in Meghalaya/greater Bengal like Khasic; Munda like Santhal. They simply, like most other tribes, retained their tribal existence with a symbiotic relationship with the Arya-s.
