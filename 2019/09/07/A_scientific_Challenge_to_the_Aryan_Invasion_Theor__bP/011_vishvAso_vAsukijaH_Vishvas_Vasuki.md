To put it a little more bluntly (as someone else noted) - You either accept that core Rig Veda is newer than the aforementioned time, or you accept that its core was composed (or received etc..) outside greater India. You can't have both.  
  
As a further corollary (if you pick the latter option) - the language of the original hymns is not necessarily exactly as we hear it now.
