Good - the main point of these examples was to illustrate how Hindu memes, transported by their conservatives, more or less supplant native relatively-looser traditions with considerable ease - even with enthusiastic acceptance. Now, even if ALL the placenames are not sanskritized or if 100% of the language is AryAnized, the facts suffice to make the intended point. Filipino to Tamil, there are a lot (going well beyond half the vocabulary) of sanskrit/ IA loan words and ideas as you've noted. If you had an influx of scale similar to that of IA invasion of North India or Sinhala invasion of Lanka - you would see more drastic replacement after a millenium of settlement. As significant as Hindu migrations were to these other regions, they were not of similar scale.

There are plenty of hints of steppe homes, which have been noted since the time of the brilliant BG Tilak. But, it won't do to bring them up because you'll easily do some interpretive gymnastics.

Elephant in the room is that Steppe genes are highly correlated with IA core memes and language. Unless you're arguing that somehow non-steppe-gene-carrying brAhmaNa-s were massacred out, you've got to admit that they were outside greater India before 2kBC IF you agree that aDNA extracted is representative (which you don't, but that's like grasping at straws at this point). Even if you say that IA core memes and language spread from IVC area west (where they were native) all the way to Iceland - you still have the problem that non-"steppe" Indian gene-lines clearly found in the region aren't found in old Europe.

As an aside, this tendency towards geographical determinism underplays true genius and greater virility the sages and warriors of kuru-pAnchala realm might have had (even according to extant religious traditions). Ditto with IVC collapse and IA invasion.
