Namaste Misraji,

  

The task is clear, history espetially the narrative part of the history needs to be rewritten. The voices which are stifled and mocked have to be understood. Scholars can have and should have personal ideology but should not creep into their mainstream technical works. As and when leftists and colonial stains are removed the right voices will be heard and true picture will emerge. Forget foreigners or western scholars who have deep prejudiced and one sided writings several prominent Indian scholars started supporting the propagandists and devilish forces, the grand plan of vested foreigners who want to and would like to interfere and dominate on every sphere of our life including rewriting text books.

Hence this list is called Bharatiya vidvat parishad and Bharatiyas accept knowledge from all sides but true knowledge and not false propaganda of a few western scholars and Indian scholars.

Mounting evidences after evidences will be unearthed and propagandists false views will be exposed

This is not just a view but an emerging fact all happening for a better India.
