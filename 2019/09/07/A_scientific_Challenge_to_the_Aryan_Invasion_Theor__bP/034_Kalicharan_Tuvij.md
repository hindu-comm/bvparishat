Something that I should have added in my last mail:

1\) As I understand a lot of significant haplogroup diversification occurred in the plains of U.P. on the SE Asia - Iranian cline.

2\) On intuitive understanding:  
Europian ancestry comes out of "Father Iran" and "Mother Russia". I am not being literal though; Western attitudes towards these two powers even to this day (even when Iran has ceased to be the superpower it was) makes way for such intuition. My point is: this all makes sense at intuitive level, and is far from being convoluted. No one is saying that Indian genes went over to Western Europe; Indian culture (mostly language only) rode over the back of Iranian political power.

3\) Indian researchers should focus on the ancestry of steppe people. And they should speak their minds (even if they believe in AIT) in the public (this is how progress is made). Also, since the genetic histories/ causes are not linearly separated (back and forth migrations), ANN techniques (or adaptations there of) should be adapted in genetic studies (ask your Maths departments).
