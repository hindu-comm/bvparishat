नमस्ते,

  

With lots of people unabashedly spreading misleading information, one would do well to listen to the population genetics experts hashing it out - <https://www.brownpundits.com/2019/09/11/browncast-episode-66-ancient-india-and-dna-with-vagheesh-narasimhan/> . Vagheesh Narasimhan is the lead author of the paper that started this thread.

  

An interesting point from there:  

\- Selection for lactose tolerance in India occurred in the last millennium or two.

Observation of close morphological relation also led to the proposition of Lamarckian inheritance (inheritance of acquired characteristics). This was later rejected in favor of Darwin's theory. Furthermore, Darwin's theory have since found support and theoretical basis in genetics.  

  

One may campare OIT and AIT with Lamarckian and Dawinian theories.

This is a serious misrepresentation since genetic studies closely look at present day genetic composition of geographically and ethnically diverse people.

What language did second and third generation of Anglo Saxon people migrating to the US speak? One can only pity these theorists who have given up on their common sense in the endeavour of supporting counter-scientific things.
