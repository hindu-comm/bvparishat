The Yamnaya and Harappans were both pagans in your opinion, with the latter having lesser organizational/conservative strengths. These are both unsubstantiated assumptions. We do not know if the social and sacral structure of Yamnaya corresponded to that of the Vedic people; and archaeological evidence shows that the Harappans had a well defined social structure (high town, lower town, streets with agglomeration of people with specific occupations etc.). And what makes you think that Muslims had a less cohesive social structure as compared to Yamnaya?

  

The analogy given is quite opaque. As they say, "When in doubt, mumble." Unless you want to argue that Brahmanas were cruel, alpha males who imposed their language, religion etc on 80% people in the Indian subcontinent!
