Appreciate the following excerpt (in yellow), from your recent note (in trail below), Vishal. Thank you for raising these and sharing them.

  

Best,

"Can anyone tell my why 1 and 2 are counted separately; and whether the label 'Bhumihar' even has any relevance in precolonial times? Can anyone tell me why Tiwari Brahmin (\~ Trivedis/Tripathis) is classified separately from UP Brahmin? Most Tiwaris are from UP, and in fact many with this surname are even found in Nepal. And in Nepal itself, we have the Bahun (Khas) as well as Terai Brahmans who overlap with Bhumihars and Tiwaris. So essentially, one continuum of a population is arbitrarily split into 5. Many community names do not make much sense. What is 'Gaud_Karnataka'? Is it a Gaud Sarasvata; or Vokkaliga? If the former, why does it have so low Central MLBA Steppe ancestry? What if I make separate categories of Haryana Jats, Rajasthan Jats, UP Jats and then argue that many Shudra clans have the highest MLBA ancestry? Which community in ancient India was said to have only two Varnas - Brahmana and Shudra?

  

Ifyou scroll further, you will likewise find may 'populations' split unnecessarily (e.g., there are separate categories for 'Agarwal', 'Bania', 'Banias'). Why is it that the Jat Sikhs, considered Shudras along with other Jats (Hindus in Haryana, W Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan; Muslim Jutts in W Punjab) have the third or fourth highest central Steppe MLBA related ancestry?"
