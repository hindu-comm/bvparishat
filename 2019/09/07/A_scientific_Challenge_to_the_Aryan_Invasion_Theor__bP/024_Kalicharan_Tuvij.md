Namaste,

Some of my observations (based on understanding of mathematics used in the genetic study rather than genetics itself):

1\) The latest genetic studies lend a good deal of weightage (Harvard is not supposed to that) to Indian civilisational by inferring "independent" origins of agriculture within the subcontinent. A good start, many other facets (origin of astronomy etc) directly or indirectly related to agri should come along.

2\) Ancient DNA should be combined with present DNA to get the fullest possible picture. Underhill's study (sound logic) has already indicated R1a origin in Iran. This corroborates with well-understood westwards cline of P1 (immediate ancestor to R) from "Southeast Asia".

3\) PCA analysis (fig A) in Narasimhan's reveals an Iranian-IVC cline typical of a unidimensional spread of Indus elites (non-brahmin related burial-types) towards Iran.

4\) With more aDNA data from Northern India (looks unlikely with present tech, and because of cremation practice) the representative basis spread is more likely to match the present spread (indicated by the flanking evident in PCA by Iranian).

5\) The Parashurama episode (invasion from Iran) bears out a fact that Brahmin-related ancestory derived certain amount of influence within the subcontinent from their western networks (and not from magical powers as popularly believed). This by no means means that Vaidika isn't representative of Hinduism in general (independent Vaidika studies themselves).

6\) Swat valley (gAndhAra) population displacement, on the other hand, should be understood in the context of attested Central Asian incursions from 1000 BCE onwards.

7\) With the rate scientific progress is going on, I think it may take another 200 years to come to mainstream understanding of complex state of ancestories in the subcontinent. Statistics, in particular, fairs poorly at grasping the disproportional effects that a minisculity of "data points" can exert.  
On the Indian side of the story, Varna far from being an outcome of complexity/diversity, rather could be nearly at the cause of it.
