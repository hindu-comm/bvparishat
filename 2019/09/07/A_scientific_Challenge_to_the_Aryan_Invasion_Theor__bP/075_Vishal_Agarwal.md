An old paper by Koenraad Elst (see attached) summarizes some Political abuses of AIT/AMT/OIT etc. In fact, the paper does not even list all of them although it is the best summary available. In my own notes, I have citations from books that AIT is used in many other ways too like:

  

1\. Jainism is the original faith of IVC and Hinduism is an invasive religion through AIT.

2\. Sikhs represent a resurgence of original faith AIT (!)

3\. Sanskrit itself is derived from Arabic (I have books by two Pakistani scholars on this)

4\. German Nationalism and Nazism

5\. Eurocentrism and White Supremacism

6\. Brahmin's Burden

  

The fact that the newspaper The Hindu is promoting a particular view, the clockwork precision with which Tony Joseph has been promoted etc. has its own political underpinnings.

  

This post is just for summarizing the intensely political nature of this controversy and not for triggering any discussion.
