Although the paper primarily focuses on South Asian population, they do mention there is no R1b or R1a in the ancient DNA they sampled from Iran, again arguing for a more recent movement of Steppe people from Central Asia into India and Iran:

I do not believe there is any strong linguistic evidence to argue Brahui is not indigenous to Baluchistan. Furthermore, the genetic makeup of Brahui speakers shows a complete lack of H-haplogroup (which is native to India), and thus precluding a possibility of a recent migration of Brahui speakers from Central India.
