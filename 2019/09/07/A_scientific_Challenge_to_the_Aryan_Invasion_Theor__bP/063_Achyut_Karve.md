Dear Vidwans,

  

Darwin's theory of evolution was not based on genetic or archeological studies. It was a result of a close observation of the present living world and the close morphological relation that exist between species of the day.

  

By basing evolution on archeological o r genetic studies these so called theorists have turned a blind eye towards what is obvious in the present.

  

For example what happens just to the second or third generation of people who have migrated to the US? Do the language they speak there have any resemblence to their parents language though they may still carry the genetic print of their parents. One can only pity these theorists who have given up on their common sense in the endeavour of inventing new things.

  

In such circumstances it is hard to believe that the Vedas were imported from across the North West border of present day South Asia.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
