1\. Yes, uncivilized 'Aryans' 'destroyed' the cities of the 'civilized' 'Dravidian' Indus Valley inhabitants was the original theory.

  

The word 'civilization' in the phrase ' Indus Valley Civilization' emphatically refers to the 'city' aspect of the culture that is described using that phrase.

  

2\. Now the recent articles talk about 'decline' of IVC. They do not talk about cities of IVC getting destroyed by an invading foreign race.

  

3\. Moreover, they talk about how the Steppe *pastoralist*s entered into India *after* the decline of the Harappan Civilization'.
