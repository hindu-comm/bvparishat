Dear Vidwans,

  

In the wake of cremation being a practice since Vedic times can the skeletal remains found in the north west and steppes be said to be representative of the Indian Sub Continent?

  

How many skeletal remains have heen found along the river Ganga or in the Doab or in the Deccan which has been populated since time immemorial?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
