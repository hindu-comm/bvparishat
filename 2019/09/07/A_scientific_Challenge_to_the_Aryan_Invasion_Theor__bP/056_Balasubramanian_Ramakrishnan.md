Apropos this discussion I would like to understand the prayojana and phala of this topic. I admit that I have no ax to grind one way or the other, but the prayojana and phala do interest me. I suppose there are some people studying it as intellectual pursuit - as a puzzle if you will - and the studying itself is the prayojana and phala. But real life is more complex. These results are used in political ways. I remember one classmate of mine telling a short while after we learned the Aryan Invasion Theory (9th standard CBSE history) that my Indian-ness itself could be disputed, but there was no way I could be called a Tamil - that was just not possible. I didn't say anything, but it was rich coming from a Telugu speaking guy (at home) and going by my subcaste - brhaccaraNam, arguments could be made that I had a \~ 2000 year history in Tamil Nadu.

  

The Kotturpuram bridge in Chennai (circa early 90s) used to have many interesting gems written in clear Tamizh - one example being the leader Periyar's sayings "If you see a brahmin and a snake (at the same time), stone the brahmin first". The corporation would dutifully whitewash the bridge once or so a year, but these nuggets of wisdom would pop up again in a few weeks. BTW, all these folks use the AIT and the leaders are very open in saying so. I sometimes joke that this is the "Tamil vaalga valaraga" crowd, because when they say "Tamizh vaazhga vaLarga" in rallies, they invariably (mis)pronounce zha and La as la :-). One way to effectively control to garbage from these fascists may be to pass a law that only people who can pronounce zha and La correctly are Tamilians :-) :-).  

  

Of course some may know the incident where Kamil Zvelebil suggested that the earliest language in India was not Tamil in a speech (in Madurai if I remember right) and had to be rushed out before the Periyarist mob could lynch him. So AIT and other historical "facts" can be chosen only selectively.  

  

After finishing my CBSE history in 10th, I think we all realized that the Aryans invaded, then there was dark period with absolutely no progress till Sher Shah built roads, Akbar came up with Din-i-Lahi (bless his heart) and Aurangazeb the emperor was a humble man who lived off the money he made by selling handwritten copies of the Koran. BTW, this is NOT an exaggeration. I don't know if the CBSE history books are still this stupid or whether they have improved. Silly people who write op-eds in American newspapers about "re-writing" history textbooks in India should perhaps read some of them first.

  

Later at IIT Madras, when I had a chance to take some humanities courses and being older, I did understand quite quickly that the historians were mainly communists (most used to be card carrying members of some cell or the other) who wanted to keep playing society off by pitting one group against the other, while waiting for salvation from China or Russia. This is again not a joke or an exaggeration. They used to openly wish for a Chinese or Russian invasion. This is all well known. These days they pass themselves off as "progressives" or whatever and keep their Chinese/Russian invasion fantasies in check (at least openly). I do wonder though like Dr Misra, why many academics here align themselves with these jokers. Just because someone agrees with you on AIT or whatever doesn't mean you should share a platform with them. Why write op-eds in Indian newspapers about Indian politicians, elections, history, AIT and such, while associating with an odious group? Clearly the folks here also have some hidden agenda and just completely naive fools.

  

On the flip side though, I wonder if the grand scheme of the OIT, at least by some people, is the othering of who they consider "non-Indian". Having been on the receiving end of this othering, I certainly wouldn't wish it on anyone.
