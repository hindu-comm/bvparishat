You obviously seem to be well informed with respect to the key issues within the data sets.

The best course of action would be for you to run diagnostics and post a counter narrative.

Nothing speaks louder than patterns in data which cannot be argued against or pushed under the carpet.

  

Being unaware of the political overtones, I am unaware of the assumption here-->Does the steppe gene somehow confer superiority or dilution to these 6 categories?

  

Another issue to consider is all these 6 categories are North Indians categories(Not trying to subsume Nepal within the Rep of India here) geographically speaking. This could have resulted from invasions from the Yavanas and resultant comingling.

  

Unfortunately the history of the subcontinent is too long and tangled for a simple answer to emerge.
