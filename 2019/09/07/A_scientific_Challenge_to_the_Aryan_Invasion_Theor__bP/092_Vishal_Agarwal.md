Ramakrishnan Ji,

  

Not 70% genes. The maximum proportion of Central Steppe MLBA genes are 27% in \_SOME\_ groups (SOME Brahmins and Jats) who are respectively 3-4% and 5-6% of India's population only max. As you point out, the so called AMT and similar theories are merely a strategic retreat, and just a cover for the true face of AIT.

  

I am being accused of anti Brahminism. People can read the few of my published articles that I had attached earlier today (specifically the NCERT textbook reviews) to see how I have exposed the anti-Brahminism of others. Actually, a Muslim bigot published an article in the internet around 20 years ago to expose the 'Brahmin RSS agent Vishal Agarwal of Florida who wants to enslave Dalits'. Perhaps you can still find it somewhere on the Net. Thereafter he sent me pictures of body parts of a slaughtered cow in an email.

  

The biggest anti Brahmins are those who liken/compare Brahmins to Spanish Conquistadors ('high European Ancestry'). The latter had massacred, forcibly converted, raped, enslaved, looted Native Americans. I thought this nonsensical comparison was found only in the writings of Witzel (he wrote that Aryan horses = 'Vedic Tanks' = horses of Spaniards) and other Hinduphobic racists, but looks like some among us too have a vishvaas in these kind of things. I am not sure whether this gentleman has ever spent enough time in Andean highlands in places like Urubamba and Cuzco etc., or Yucatan etc. to see the in your face destruction of Mayas and Incas by the Spanish people. BTW, all the actions of the Spaniards are recorded in history, archaeology, oral memories, literature and in genetics; not to mention the fact that all but 5 countries of Latin America (Haiti, Peru, Bolivia, Equador and Paraguay) are majority White or Mestizo. Apparently, according to this view, the Brahmins/Aryans were so clever that just with a \<10% genetic input into the entire population, they were able to change the language, religion, culture, etc etc of 80% of the Indian subcontinent which had just come out of a huge Bronze Age Civilization; and that too without leaving hardly a trace of any destruction of the original language, culture, religion. But, the foolish Conquistadors left original Native American names in most towns, rivers, villages, mountains intact! The Whites in Latin American remember their original homeland even today. The Vedic Brahmins forgot it even in the RV :-)

  

Perhaps, the Zeroth Reich was actually in India around 1939 BCE, and it was perhaps worse than the Third Reich in 1939 CE. Oh, but in the former, a yet to be formed 5% minority subdued the majority through peaceful migration using Vedic memes, whereas in the latter the 3% minority was exterminated.

  

Regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
