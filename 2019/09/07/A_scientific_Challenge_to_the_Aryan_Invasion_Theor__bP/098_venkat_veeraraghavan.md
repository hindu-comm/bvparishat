Vishal ji-

Thanks for the papers.

  

Vishvas ji and Vishal ji--

  

We all appreciate your debate but kindly give up on the personal attacks, which make this uncomfortable reading. It is entirely possible for two well meaning individuals to dig trenches on the different sides of a battlefield convinced that they are on the side of truth.

A lot of this has to do with different contexts and sources. There is a spaghetti of colonial and post independence lies that need untangling before a semblence of truth can emerge. See if you can examine the sources of the other and find fallacies in any of the implicit or explicit assumptions. That would be more productive than all this bad (precious) blood.

And I would counsel patience in such matters. Satya can never be established in a hurry. Only a lie can be arranged at short notice.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
