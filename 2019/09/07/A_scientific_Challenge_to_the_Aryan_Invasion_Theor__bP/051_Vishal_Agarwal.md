Thanks for elaborating on your position, that is largely a restatement of the Aryanist invasion paradigm. This is what I have always said of the Witzellian models - that they are just the same old 19th century Colonial Aryanist models with a little overcoat of 'modern discoveries' and politically correct phrases thrown in here and there. But essentially, they remain just that - Colonial Aryanist theories.

  

I do wish to let you know that I have absolutely no envy for 'Brahmanas' like you! I am in a much better position in every way in my life. Nor do I fear the allegations of Brahmadvesha. I have really never been that fascinated or awed by Harry Potter's wizard like characters :-)

  

BTW, so in your model, the Austra-asiatics virile male akshauhinis also launched a military invasion from S E Asia into the Indian subcontinent, right? Or did that sentence belong to the previous paras dealing with Aryan Brahmanas? What caste did the victorious Austra-Asiatic then occupy with the permission of the Brahmanas?

  

Why are the NW rivers Gomal and Harirud mentioned in 'Late' RV instead of in the earlier portions? Is the RV Sarasvati the Helmand, or the Ghaggar-Hakra-Nara? \[Or Volga, Amy Darya or Syr Darya\]
