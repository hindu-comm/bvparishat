From what I understood, three important points from the papers are:  

1.  The ancient DNA of IVC doesn't show mixture from Eurasian Steppe DNA
    (although it is found in the DNA of many people of the current
    Indian population) 2.  The ancient DNA of 11 skeletons of IVC doesn't show the DNA of
    Iranian farmers (although it shows a significant mixture of ancient
    Iranian hunter-gatherer DNA). 3.  IVC is indigenous (although the significant DNA is from the ancient
    Iranian hunter-gatherers, and not ancient Indian
    hunter-gatherers).  

It is clear to anyone who read the papers that the ancient DNA doesn't contain Yamnaya DNA, and given the fact that the current Indian population has Yamnaya DNA in significant amount in Upper Castes should only lead to the conclusion that a migration from Yamnaya region into India has occurred after 2500 BCE.

  

  

In fact both the papers clearly state it:  
From the paper in \_Cell\_:  
"However, a natural route for Indo-European languages to have spread into South Asia is from Eastern Europe via Central Asia in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE, a chain of transmission that did occur as has been documented in detail with ancient DNA. The fact that the Steppe pastoralist ancestry in South Asia matches that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe (but not Western Europe \[de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018, Narasimhan et al., 2019\]) provides additional evidence for this theory, as it elegantly explains the shared distinctive features of Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian languages (Ringe et al., 2002)."

From the paper in \_Science\_  
"Our observation of the spread of Central_Steppe_MLBA ancestry into South Asia in the first half of the second millennium BCE provides this evidence, which is particularly notable because it provides a plausible genetic explanation for the linguistic similarities between the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian subfamilies of Indo-European languages, which despite their vast geographic separation share the “satem” innovation and “ruki” sound laws (62). \[...\] Steppe ancestry in modern South Asians is primarily from males and disproportionately high in Brahmin and Bhumihar groups."

When both papers clearly state and show pictures of movement of Indo-European speakers in the second millennium BCE into India, why do Indian newspapers report the papers with totally misleading titles?

The distortions of the scientific studies in Indian news media is astounding. I understand these papers are very technical and hard. But I hoped some of the reporters would do the due diligence and at least go through the contents and read the clear conclusions. The press conference by Shinde and Rai was also not encouraging either. While the paper they co-authored clearly states that Yamnaya DNA must have entered after the decline of IVC, how can they obfuscate the facts in the press conference to mislead the media?

That's why I sincerely hope India is developing a world-class research and scholarship culture (with achievements such as the launching of Chandrayaan despite the failure of the lander) so that they can accept and present the scientific discoveries without obfuscations or distortions or propaganda. Great achievements in science and technology will hopefully make Indian feel proud of their current preeminence in the world, so that they don't have to concoct or distort the stories of glory of the bygone era (there is already a tremendous amount of glory in the Indian past which is widely acknowledged, and should make all Indians proud of themselves).  

Ā nō bhadrāḥ kratvō yantu viśvataḥ Śubham bhūyāt.
