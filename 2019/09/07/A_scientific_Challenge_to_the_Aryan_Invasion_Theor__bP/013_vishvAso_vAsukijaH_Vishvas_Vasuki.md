\- Elephant and whale are both "Massive" - one is much more massive than the other :-)

\- In terms of consequences: Islamic invasion of a pagan population (and one with a well established conservative social structure) is hardly comparable to the invasion of one pagan population over another (especially one with presumably lesser organizational/ conservative strengths).
