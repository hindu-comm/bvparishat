By town, I mean here in BVP and other such gatherings. Turn over a rock, and you'll find one vidvAn commiserating with another: "Tut tut! Look at those evil colonial hoodlums. They're fooling everyone into thinking that Vedic people are from out of sacred India." (Thankfully they don't go full-PN-Oak.) That's a big fall from the times of heroes like BG Tilak, sAvarkar and kANe, which I would rather contain to the extant of my limited ability."

  

I don't under stand what Vishvas is trying to to covey by the sentence. I don't need further explanation.  I prefer not to understand. The sentence is too complex and doesn't make much sense to me. What are you talking about BG Tilak, sAvarkar and kANe? again I donot understand. Any way I learnt what I needed to learn and noted your position on AIT Thank you. Bye for now.
