Yes I do I remember a incident I and my cousins were having a talk in our house Living room on a topic which was controversial. My grandfather who was away suddenly comes in and listens for some time feels that the topic doesn't interest him quips and mocks at us and then we all without uttering a word go to our rooms We went t0 our rooms not because he asked us we did respect him Our doubts on the controversial topic remains and we discuss when he is not around.

Then my Grandfather called me and said probably its my fault I should not have interrupted your discussion for me as an elder, I should respond only if i am asked or if I felt something that you guys were doing was against the basic principles of Dharma in its widest sense.
