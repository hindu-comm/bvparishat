Professor Misra,

  

If you think certain Indologists have a distaste towards their subject, you've got to see how some Biblical scholars handle theirs.

A substantial bit of the so-called Biblical scholarship is little more than thinly disguised atheism. You could be reading hundreds upon hundreds of pages of such research and not find even a short paragraph that can enrich spiritually, even a little bit. Wellhausen himself realised that something was amiss in the procedure when he admitted that, while his job was to help train priests, somehow his style of presenting the subject was turning them away from their chosen vocation. As for anti-Semitism, Wellhausen was so legendary in that regard that it's superfluous to comment further. That didn't prevent him from being an extremely intelligent and learned scholar, however.

This business of distaste to all forms of otherness isn't just a reality within Indology. That said, I don't want to suggest that all Indologists behave in this way, only some, just as I don't want to suggest that all Biblical scholars can be indiscriminately lumped together.
