Really? A favorite quote comes to mind: "You can attack what a person \*said\* or what the person \*meant\*. The former is more sensational. The mark of a charlatan is to defend his position or attack a critic by focusing on \*some\* of his/her specific statement ("look at what he said") rather than attacking his position ("look at what he means"), the latter of which requires a broader knowledge of the proposed idea.""  

  

Anyway - no. I am saying your \*so-called\* 'anti-brAhmain-supremacy' discourse is ill-considered - you've not taxed your brain enough, you should do a better job of correctly assessing the role of your society's ancient ritualist conservative class; and not act as if properly acknowledging their critical contributions is an assault on your vaNik self-respect or "samadarshI" turIya state or whatever.

So? 70 years of OIT has brought them around to love us? You seriously think they're going to give us an easier time or more respect if we keep rejecting scientific research to prop up fantasies?
