Unfortunately this does not seem likely in the near future as I am very engaged in community activities teaching children and adults (in addition to my day job, family commitments etc) since 2008. My primary focus at present is to create material for teaching Hinduism at temple schools; and complete my notes on the Vedanta Prasthana Traya. I can share digital copies of some of my old publications listed below if you wish:

  

2014. *The New Western Stereotypes of Hindus in Western Indology.* Hinduworld Publisher. Wilmington (Delaware) -some chapters in this are relevant.

  

2005-2006. *On Perceiving Aryan Migrations in Vedic Ritual Texts*. Pages 155-165 in *Puratattva* (Bulletin of the Indian Archaeological Society, New Delhi), Vol. 36

2005-2006. *Misrepresentation of Ancient India and Hinduism in American School Textbooks*. Pages 72-89 in *History Today* (Journal of the Indian History and Culture Society, New Delhi), Vol. 7

2005. *What is the Aryan Migration Theory.* Pages 1-46 in *Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies in History and Archaeology*, Vol. 2, No. 1.

2005. *A Review of Romila Thapar’s ‘Ancient India, a Textbook of History for Middle Schools’, NCERT: New Delhi (1987).* In *India’s Only Communalist.* Ed. by Koenraad Elst. Voice of India (New Delhi)
