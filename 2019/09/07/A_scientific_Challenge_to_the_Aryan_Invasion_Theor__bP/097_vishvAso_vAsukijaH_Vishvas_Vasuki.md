Again this is charlatanry (referring back to the quote in <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/bPkh3AQ4Sg0/0P8CjmZSBQAJ> ). For example, I'd already said:  
  
" The IA invaders had "dharma" and a highly effective conservative core, which gave them the edge. (I don't think it is some teme like chariots or gene like lactose tolerance which can explain the massive invasion from the Ural area into Europe and Asia.) " (from <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/bPkh3AQ4Sg0/_z4jMAYZAgAJ> )  
  
and  
  
"Islamic invasion of a pagan population (and one with a well established conservative social structure) is hardly comparable to the invasion of one pagan population over another (especially one with presumably lesser organizational/ conservative strengths)" (from <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/bPkh3AQ4Sg0/aXZg0Jz_AQAJ> ).  

  

You acknowledged both these points, argued about it, mocked it, and in the end post some screed as if all that was unsaid.

What a demonstration of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law> !

"As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") or [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") [approaches 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Convergence_in_probability "Convergence of random variables")". Though early responses had lowered my expectations, I am still surprised that the famous Vishal Agarwal stoops his rhetoric to "reductio ad Hitlerum" level.
