For those interested, I've started a separate thread on precisely the above denialism - <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/Fk23Mvx6VjM> .

  

Since the below pertains to his paper, I invite Vagheesh Narasimhan (cc-ed) to respond objectively.  
@vAgheesh - <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bvparishat> is a mailing list consisting of Indian Sanskrit scholar types and assorted interested laymen. As such, genetics being outside their main area of competence, they are far too easily misled by misselected facts, misstatements and the like. It would be a great service if you engage in clarifying technical objections and questions (while not wasting time on the rest). You can respond via <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bvparishat> after getting membership, or I offer to forward your response.
