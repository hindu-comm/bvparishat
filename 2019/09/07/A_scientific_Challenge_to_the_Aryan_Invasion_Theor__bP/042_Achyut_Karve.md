Dear Vidwans,

  

Language too has genetic coding in terms of how basic speech units are intertwined to form words before they can be syntatically joined to form sentences.

  

As per our scriptures these codings outlive human generations which is the main reason for words being called नित्य.

  

Is there any paper on the basic speech units of human languages?

  

Which languages in the world have all the basic speech units.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
