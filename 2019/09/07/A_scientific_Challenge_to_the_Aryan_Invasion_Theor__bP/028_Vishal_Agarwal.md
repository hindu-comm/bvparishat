Your examples below actually do not apply to the 'Aryanization' of 80% of the Indian subcontinent which involved a complete loss of original place names, language (even Kuiper's over-enthusiastic hunt for loan words in the RV yields a bare 4% of vocab in the RV that is 'non IA' in origin), religion/culture without any evidence in archaeology, literature, archeo-astronomy etc etc.

  

In Indonesia, they retained their original language despite ingress of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam albeit with a heavy borrowing from Indic languages. They have written traditions about arrival or Brahmins/Kshatriyas, and then Muslim merchants from India and what not. The movement of Indians into Indonesia/Kampuchea is clearly seen archaeologically. Ditto with Kampuchea. And even on the Indian side, we have customs like the Bali Yatra in Odisha.  

  

The Manipur valley itself is like 500 times smaller than the area where IA norms spread; and the way Hinduism spread in that region with the strong push by rulers like Gharib Niwaz at the cost of local traditions is more of an anomaly as to how Hinduism spread elsewhere. The valley already had Ramanandis from ancient times, and there is plentiful evidence in literature as to how this all happened among the Meities. Plus they have preserved their language and so on. The Manipur valley and Indonesia/Kampuchea etc are outside of the Vedic core area of Kuru-Panchala.

  

The surviving Vedic literature is six times the length of the Bible and yet we do not see any hint of an invasion in them or any migration from Central Asia. Like I said earlier, if the Steppe genes are more prevelant in the Brahmanas, one must not fall blindly into the temptation of seeing Aryan invasions and instead explore the historical causes. The article talks about Tiwaris, Bhumihars and 'Pandits' without divulging much raw data. There was a wholesale massacre of Kshatriya clans during various foreign invasions in Indian history. In regions in NW India like Gandhara, Madra etc., there was a selective flight of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas into the interior of India and these regions had been exposed to foreign incursions considerably. It is a fact that Khatris, Mohyals (Gandhara Brahmanas), Kashmiri Brahmanas etc resisted conversions better than the masses and eventually moved towards Indian interior. Then you have the case of Kamboj community (found again, around Amritsar, Bikaner and other parts of N India) and even Shakdweepee Brahmans with whom the Bhumihars are often related (some say that the very surname 'Mishra' is due to this); or the Maagh Brahmins.

  

The spread of Vedic practices over N India can be explained better through data given in the Vedic literature itself and the archaeological data on progressive dessication of different sections of the Sarasvati River which led to migrations from the Indus Sarasvati region towards interior India on one hand and partially towards Turan/Gandhara along the right bank of Sindhu. Aridity happened only towards the very end in the upper Sarasvati regions - which were the abode of Puru-Bharatas, and hence, they were more effective in preserving their own religious traditions. No wonder their influence is dominating in the Rigveda.

  

And of course, I'd like to repeat that burials were nor the norm either in IVC, or in the Vedic culture. The skeletons from Rakhigarhi or Chitra/Swat are non representative of these cultures or culture.
