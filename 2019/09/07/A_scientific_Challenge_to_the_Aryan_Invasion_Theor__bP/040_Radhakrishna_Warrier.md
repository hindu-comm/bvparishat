This is regarding the paper on the DNA analysis of the IVC era individual. As Suresh Kolichala has said, it appears to me that the paper is essentially saying:

-   The individual can be considered to represent the larger population
    of IVC of that time -   The individual has a major genetic contribution from ancient Iranian
    hunter gatherers
-   But the Iranian contribution is from a time before the Iranian
    hunter gatherers turned to farming, so farming did not come to IVC
    from these ancient Iranians -   The IVC individual has no genetic contribution from pastoral people
    of central Asian or eastern European steppes unlike modern Indians
    who do have a large contribution of these "steppe" genes -   The individual also has a much smaller contribution from the
    original hunter gatherer settlers of India (what the paper refers to
    as Andamanese Hunter Gatherers or AHG) than the modern residents of
    the area who have more of the AHG genetic contribution

I am not sure why many Indian newspapers say the findings discussed in the paper disprove ancient immigration from the steppes. On the contrary, basing on what this paper says, I think it could be argued that there indeed was an ancient immigration to India from the steppes after the IVC era because modern Indians do have the steppe genes but the IVC individual did not have them.

  

Coming back to the paper under discussion, since the IVC individual has a smaller contribution of genes from the original settlers of India (the AHG) than what modern residents of the area have, can it be said that the intermixing of the Iranian hunter gatherers and the AHG was in its initial phase in the IVC era and that it progressed and spread to east and south India in the course of time? Could we also say that these Iranian hunter gatherers brought a proto Dravidian with them? That this proto Dravidian slowly spread among the original inhabitants (the AHG) whose language was totally unrelated to Dravidian? Can we say that modern Tamils, whose genetic makeup might mostly be that of the AHG with small contributions from the Iranian Hunter Gatherers and from Steppe, speak a Dravidian language now, just as the Hispanic (whose genetic makeup is mostly native American) now speak Spanish brought from Europe?
