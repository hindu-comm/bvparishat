Prehistoric interactions between India and Russia (using the words loosely) should also be researched thoroughly. Lactase persistence (LP), the ability in some adults to digest milk with more ease, in particular has been shown to have been transmitted from Russia (not Iran) to Europe. It is then very likely a result of the transmission of that specific genetic variant (termed C/T\*âˆ’13910) from India to Russia.

 Another known outcome of the Indo-Russo-Iranian confluence is the one-way word-loan in Balto-Slavic. "One-way" because Indian mainland was too far away to be influenced.
