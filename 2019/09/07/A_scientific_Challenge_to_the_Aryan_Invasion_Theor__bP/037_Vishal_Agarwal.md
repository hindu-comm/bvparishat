I would like Vishvas Vasuki to summarize his position \[ = Aryan invaders who formed alpha Brahmana elites in later times came to India after Mature Harappan circa 1900 BCE and brought with them the Vedic religion which then overwhelmed all indigenous cultures in the Indian subcontinent and mixed with them to form Hinduism with the Vedic orthopraxy as the overarching umbrella. Alongside, the native Indians lost all memory of Aryan arrival, lost their languages, place names or even memories of the same all over the region; while the Aryan Brahmanas completely omitted to mention in explicit terms how they overcame the non Aryans century after century. The RV is post 1500 BCE and was composed east of the Hindu Kush. Or the RV is composed largely W of Hindu Kush. The Aryans are originally from Steppe and were nomads. etc etc\]?

  

As a non Brahmana, I just find it silly that only Brahmana Arya Rishis had the vitality to promote their culture even as an elite minority and overwhelm the language, religion etc etc of such a large land mass. To summarize my position:

  

Practically everything is possible on this earth. It is even possible that human beings are descendant from extra-terrestrial aliens. But how probable is it that this did really happen? *Almost zero*. My point is that a mere demonstration that the occurrence of a historical is possible is not a sufficient proof that it did occur. One also needs to demonstrate that the probability of that possibility having become a reality is high. In short, to establish a case, one must make it likely, not simply ‘not impossible’.

The conventional Aryan Invasion/Migration Theories and their new Siamese twins that are delivered each passing day imagine a unique situation in South Asia around 1500 BCE. It is a situation that is a *simultaneous combination of several independent and improbable factors or events*. Statistically speaking, such a resultant situation is even more unlikely to have happened than the individual events could have occurred individually. These theories basically advocate that –

1. The IA speakers preserved their voluminous literature, heritage and religion despite being on the move, even when passing through vast inhabited territories, something that is contrary to norm (with a few exceptions such as that of Polynesians).

2. The IA speakers managed to Aryanize the culture, religion, language of the indigenous population of an area of 3 million sq km., without leaving any literary, archaeological, flimsy and contradictory genetic, anthropological evidence. This is against the norm and very few exceptions exist.

3. The process is said to have been achieved without much violence or use of force. The ‘acculterated’ or ‘conquered’ peoples have no memory of this having happened. This is again against the norm.

4. A culturally inferior people are said to have overwhelmed a more advanced civilization. This is again against the norm.

5. Evidence from Geology and Archaeoastronomy contradicts the soft linguistic evidence.

6. South Asian cattle (zebu) appear around the same time in the Middle East that Aryans supposedly enter South Asia – movements in opposite directions.



Many other reasons could be cited to argue why the Aryanization of much of the Indian subcontinent around 1500 BC is a highly implausible scenario. At least, the existing body of evidence from various fields does not compel us at all to accept such a thing. This does not mean of course that the Indo-European speakers were indigenous to the Indian subcontinent and that this area is the original homeland of IE languages. Again, the existing body of evidence does not compel us to accept such a possibility being real or highly probable.

  

People want to hang their hat on 11 out of place skeletons from an area close to Chitral, and an isolated skeleton in Rakhigarhi when we don't even know if they are typical Harappans, and when we do know that burial was not the norm in IVC.

  

All the examples cited by you below are non relevant. The new example of Sri Lanka is even more telling. There is the Lankan tradition if Simhalese arriving from N India, and the language itself is IA with similarities to Gujarati etc; while the Tamils arrived and dominated the northern and eastern coasts of the island. The two squeezed out the original Vedda population. All this is anthropologically attested ('God, Apes and Fossil Men' by Kenneth Kennedy, 2000) and is attested by literature and many other means.

  

And here we have the RV in which the four fold Varnas are not even attested amply, with a more fluid social structure, and with a max of 4% non IA vocab, and ZERO names of flora, fauna, rivers etc outside of NW Indian subcontinent or even a memory of movements from Steppes or Kazakhstan etc despite what Tilak, Savarkar, Golwalkar etc believed. If at all IA languages came into India from outside, it happened in very remote, pre Harappan times when there was no noteworthy memory of these movements. None of the linguistic arguments necessarily support the arrival post 1900 or 1500 BCE. \[For instance, the view that the word for the 'beaver' (babhru) was transferred to mongoose (nakula) in India is negated by Beaver fossils from Harappan periods from Baluchistan and Kashmir (just read the archaeological excavation reports) but not thereafter; and a mantra in AV mentions the two animals separately - just an example\].

  

Horse bones are attested at numerous Harappan sites despite what Meadow (who influenced the paper by the Harvard team) might say; and of course, now there is a chariot from Baghpat dated to around 1900 BCE. So now the hunt is on for the Aryan genes I suppose because they alone make a 'superior pure virile' Brahmana. I am quite content being an Anarya in that case.:-)
