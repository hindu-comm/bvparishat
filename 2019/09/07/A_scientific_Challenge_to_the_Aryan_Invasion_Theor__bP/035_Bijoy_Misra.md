I should have stated a point earlier.

Somebody becomes a physicist with the love of nature, somebody becomes a musician with the love of music.

Somebody becomes a dancer with the love of dance, and somebody becomes an artist with the love of art.

Invariably I have seen that the "professional" Indologists carry a distasteful attitude to the topic of their curiosity!

After first noticing this, I wanted to check why it is true. I have not found the answer, but I see ample evidence.

I do not know why some Indian scholars would proceed for contempt, it could be deeply political.

Any scholarship without deep liking to the topic of interest would not last.

  

E O Wilson here studies the bugs and finds the beauty! India as a historical object is cosmically beautiful!
