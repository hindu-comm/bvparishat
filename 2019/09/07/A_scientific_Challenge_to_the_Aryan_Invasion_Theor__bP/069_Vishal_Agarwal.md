You have totally misunderstood my message. I have tremendous respect for those genuine Brahmanas (or non Brahmanas) who are vidya-vinaya-sampanna. My retorts were meant only for him. He and a few others (not the rest) are referred to as 'Brahmana Supremacists' on some lists because they believe like modern colonialists that they were a civilizing force for the rest of us. As for Akshauhinis, he is the one who referred to the word 'virile' and so on in the context of Brahmanas; and referred to an Austra-Asiatic invasion too - see his own posts below. My personal goal is to follow Gita 5.18 and my own interactions with vidvaans in my life speaks for itself.

  

Anyway, for all the bombastic claims of the paper, the fact remains that it lists 6 castes as having the highest central Steppe genetic content as follows:

  

1\. UP Bhumihar

2\. Bihar Bhumihar

3\. Jat Sikh

4\. Tiwari Brahmin

5\. Nepal Brahmin

6\. Brahmin UP

  

Can anyone tell my why 1 and 2 are counted separately; and whether the label 'Bhumihar' even has any relevance in precolonial times? Can anyone tell me why Tiwari Brahmin (\~ Trivedis/Tripathis) is classified separately from UP Brahmin? Most Tiwaris are from UP, and in fact many with this surname are even found in Nepal. And in Nepal itself, we have the Bahun (Khas) as well as Terai Brahmans who overlap with Bhumihars and Tiwaris. So essentially, one continuum of a population is arbitrarily split into 5. Many community names do not make much sense. What is 'Gaud_Karnataka'? Is it a Gaud Sarasvata; or Vokkaliga? If the former, why does it have so low Central MLBA Steppe ancestry? What if I make separate categories of Haryana Jats, Rajasthan Jats, UP Jats and then argue that many Shudra clans have the highest MLBA ancestry? Which community in ancient India was said to have only two Varnas - Brahmana and Shudra?

  

If you scroll further, you will likewise find may 'populations' split unnecessarily (e.g., there are separate categories for 'Agarwal', 'Bania', 'Banias'). Why is it that the Jat Sikhs, considered Shudras along with other Jats (Hindus in Haryana, W Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan; Muslim Jutts in W Punjab) have the third or fourth highest central Steppe MLBA related ancestry? And it is not just this study which says so. Another study by Pathak et al actually notes that the Haryana (Hindu) Jats have even a greater European/MLBA genetic portion than Brahmins. So how does that fit the Aryan Migration as illustrated in the paper which says that higher the MLBA content, the higher in caste heirarchy (look also at the high MLBA of Chamars, Pasis)? In short, other explanations must be searched for than THE simple 'higher Central Steppe MLBA means higher in Varna ladder' type of explanations, and then forcefit them into the AMT paradigms. The data is shoddily coded and the resultant analysis apparently not uninodal due to which the blanket judgments of the paper do not have much real explanatory value.

  

Let us assume for a moment that all Central Asian genes were brought by Vedic people who then interbred with Indus Periphery Pool population so that the higher the MLBA content, the higher they were placed in the Varna system. This presupposes a prior hierarchy or notion or racial purity among the steppe immigrants; whereas one does not really see much evidence for the fourfold Varna system in the Rigveda. The other alternative is that the Steppe immigrants were absorbed into the pre-existing heirarchical structures of IVC (Steppe priests becoming Indian priests; Steppe laymen becoming Indian Vis or Sudras) in which case we should not be seeing a genetic gradation aligning with the fourfold caste system; and certainly not a replacement of IVC religion with a Vedic religion.

  

An alternate explanation could be to look at evolution of RV Shrauta/Grhya evolution from its older books to newer books; and thereon into YV/SV and so on. What are the newer features added? Somayajnas? Agnichayana (just throwing some examples). Could this new Steppe MLBA priests have brought these newer features with them and added to pre-existing ancient Vedic ceremonial framework? Or have reinforced the same; just as Maag/Shakadvipi Brahmanas (incidentally many Bhumihars claim to be exactly this community) reinforced and not introduced Saura worship in India in more recent times?

  

There is a tradition noted in shastras that the Sarasvati went underground at Vinashana because of the influx of barbarians from NW. If this event happened during the first half of the second millennium BCE, what could be a possible explanation? And how does the fact that central Asian rivers have changed their courses in the last 3000 years affect our understanding? For instance, much of Turkmenistan today is arid with the Amu Darya (Oxus or Vakshu) as well as Syr Darya falling into the Aral Sea. But prior to around 600 BC, they are known to have fallen into Caspian Sea directly or through a distributary.

  

Even from the perspective of historical linguistics, this genetic study makes some assumptions like accepting the Yamnaya Kurgan culture as the PIE Urheimat, and the Andronovo Culture as the IIr core area; and placing the Balto Slavic homeland in the Pontic Steppes. These views are not universally accepted by all Linguists, but certainly by David Reich. Ironically, some genetic studies I recall seeing see the highest Central Steppe MLBA in Finns among all Europeans, and it is precisely these people who are not IE speakers for several centuries.

  

Other list members have pointed out here that in both Vedic as well as IVC contexts, burial was not unknown but was not the norm, which was cremation. We do find far fewer grave sites in the Indus Sarasvati area than we expect to, and the natural conclusion is that burials or even fractional burials were not the norm. Even some late Vedic texts actually state that the Asurs buried their daily use items with the corpses. Therefore, one must really ponder on whether these 12 individuals in the Indus Periphery Pool were even representative of either IVC or Vedic peoples, or whether they were migrants from peninsular India who adopted some IVC cultural traits.

  

If Vasant Shinde has misrepresented the research conclusions, the opposite side has done the same. For instance, claims like "Some populations have as much as 30% Central Steppe MLBA genes" creates the impression these are major population groups. While the Bahuns are significant in Nepal (1 in 8), the same cannot be said of others necessarily. Bhumihars, or Tiwaris (Brahmins are 1 in 9 in UP as a whole and likewise in Bihar if Bhumihars are also considered as Brahmins). In contrast, Jat Sikhs who are over a quarter of the population of Punjab but they were traditionally low caste. And so, even the elite domination model does not work here with the genetic data presented.

  

In short, much more work is needed and then analyzed with much greater sophistication and rigor before sweeping conclusions as in this paper are drawn. I will leave it here.

Vishal
