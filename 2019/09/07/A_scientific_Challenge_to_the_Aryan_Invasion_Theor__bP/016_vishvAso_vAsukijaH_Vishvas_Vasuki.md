Not quite - You can see how Hinduism spread to south India, then to Indonesia / Cambodia etc.. Similarly, Hinduism more or less supplanted native traditions in North East India (before the advent of Christianity) - take the case of Meiteis. These did involve significant gene flow as well as meme-flow. In these cases, we observe the difference I stated. So, it makes sense to ascribe similar cause to a similar outcome in the distant past.

  

Even otherwise, the point is that one pagan population quite willingly accepts the cults and mores of another (eg: popularity of Isis cults in Europe, not to mention examples from India which I won't mention so as to not start another digression.)

"Well defined social structure" does not imply equally strong religious conservative strength. Mongols (especially after the reorganization by the great lord Chinggiz) had splendid and effective structure - yet, they came to be more buddhist than shamanistic.

I don't. The IA invaders had "dharma" and a highly effective conservative core, which gave them the edge. (I don't think it is some teme like chariots or gene like lactose tolerance which can explain the massive invasion from the Ural area into Europe and Asia.) This effective structure transferred over quite easily to each land they spread to, leading to secondary expansions such as that of the Dravidians into South India, NE India, SE Asia. Muslim invasion had to contend with this.

Well, since I sympathize with your predicament that objective Science consistently proves you wrong leading to trauma and comprehension deficit - I can help you a bit with your incomprehension. How "massive" was your "massive" Greek invasion (We have good records of Alex's "massive" army)? How massive was the Turk invasion relative to Indian population (ie how much genetic footprint do we observe among Indian mulsims today)?

That's the narrative our enemies will spin - quite the opposite of what we should say (rather than obsessing over some creationist type denialism).
