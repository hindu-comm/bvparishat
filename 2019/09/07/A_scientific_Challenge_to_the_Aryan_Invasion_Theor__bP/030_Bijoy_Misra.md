Ajitji,

I wonder myself about the excessive interest by some of the "western" scholars on matters relating to India.

To understand any culture is hard, and to understand India is particularly hard. Unfortunately a large amount

of literature has developed by superficial unscientific extrapolations without any respect to the culture or to

the people. I discovered this hard way and quite accidentally. There is hardly any western scholar who

understands India's philosophical roots. Everything is lumped as religion and then commented upon.

Where people came from is an obsession in the west. I do not know why people get into areas that

they have so little familiarity, many are wild in their assertions.  

On the Indian side, people become reactive than analytic. India did lose her freedom to foreign invaders

some five hundred years ago and various impositions have been made.
India has to gradually remove the

impositions and rediscover her freedom in thinking and her roots in culture. On the history of language,

customs and thoughts, Indian research remains unsystematic because of economic reasons.  My thinking

is that the Indian scientists and scholars should create a new paradigm for independent examination than

reacting to what others are doing or follow the outdated free-hand methodology. The world has become  

political for economic reasons, but India still has a message for the world. We can live this message in  

our independent new world ignoring what others might think.  

I agree it is lofty, but I think such is the task for the new generation. It is a personal view.

On my side, I am stuck with the examination of origin of speech leading to Paninian grammar.

We have many strong fundamental questions to research and find answers.
It may take several  

hundred years. Meanwhile the west will discourage because they lack the interest in the fundamentals.

People may reflect on the word आरोपित here. The self-examination of the west may take another thousand years.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
