Dear Irene,

You seem to love what you do. Many don't. It could be people are forced to do because of

employment opportunities. In the US many people remain discontented with their work.

In professions, they change jobs. In subjects like Indology, one could be stuck in perpetual

grumble. Inner grumble possibly leads to self-consolation by feeling locally superior with  

little knowledge and reflection. People wrap ignorance in the flourish of language and  

engage in trivial argument. It is all vanity as I see.

Spirituality as you hinted is difficult to practice. The culture may not nourish it. Spirituality  

is considered be gainfully charitable than to feel with the universe.
It is a different social  

condition which would not easily go away. There is foundational insecurity in the system.  

Most families are broken.  

I am afraid that India may be going in such self-centered direction without realizing.  

The modern life is complex. The economy demands quick gains.  

Please carry on what you do. We remain as observers. Many would not agree.

The situation may change but it would take time.

Let us feel positive.  

Best wishes,  

Bijoy Misra
