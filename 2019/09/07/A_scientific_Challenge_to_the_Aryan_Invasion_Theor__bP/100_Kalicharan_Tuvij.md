Apologies for adding one more bit.

  

As the history of horse and its domestication becomes clearer (which again comes out to be anything but simple), the battle technique related to battle-axe (while riding on horse back) - and not the horse itself - seems to emerge as the distinct advantage enjoyed by the Arya-speaking conquerers.

  

So, what does linguistics have to say about the origins of battle axe ? One sample is provided in the attached image.

  

The role of Parshu people (tribe that mastered farsA) is again central. Political power is again the driver engine that has not been given due importance in studies so far.

  

Regarding the role of brAhmaNa-s (and closely related jAti-s):

It is a big fallacy to see the historical role of Brahmins as merely teachers, advisers and pujari-s. They were always the ones most aware of world affairs; since the start of kali-yuga their centre of gravity shifted to outside the NW boundaries of present bharata-varsha (pANini one example).

  

This all the while when the Shudra led civilization within Bharata moved its own center of gravity from Indu-Sarasvati to Magadha (due to desiccation of Sarasvati), leaving a gaping hole in NW for mlechcha-s (uncultured tribes that spoke languages not unrelated to ours) whom the Brahmin power couldn't resist for long.

  

So yes Brahmins are supreme, but so are the great Kshatra-s, Shudra-s and Visha-s in their own domains.

  

P.S. in the second attachment image, a rather well understood migration of Arya-s from Iranian and Russian routes is shown. The final result should be to understand this movement (not necessarily genes) to be starting from Indian subcontinent via two parallel routes.
