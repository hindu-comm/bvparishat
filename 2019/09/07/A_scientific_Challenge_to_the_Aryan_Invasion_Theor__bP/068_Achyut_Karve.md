Dear Vidwans,

  

The evolution of the Vedic Language.

  

I do not know whether this topic should be a different thread.

  

In the course of my study of the tabla I found that the Gharansas as
they are called have distinct phonetic characteristics resulting in different syntactical structures. It was the contribution of late Ahmedjan Thirakwa to fuse them into a single hand. In short the basic two gharanas namely Delhi and Purab were fused phonetically into a new gharana called Farrukhabad which can be said to be a high bred of the first two gharanas. However this high bred gharana was more refined than the first two. All this took place in a span of about three to four hundred years thus replacing the pakhawaj in North Indian Classical music as well as establishing itself as a solo instrument as it had evolved intricate compositions.

  

This high bred gharana did not have the characteristics of the gharanas from which they primarily arose i.e the dhol, nagara from which evolved the Delhi Gharana and the pakhawaj from which arose the purab(lucknow) gharana

  

Vedic Sanskrit too appears to have evolved in a similar way as a fusion or high bred between North Indian and Dravidian tongues thus establishing itself as a unique language.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
