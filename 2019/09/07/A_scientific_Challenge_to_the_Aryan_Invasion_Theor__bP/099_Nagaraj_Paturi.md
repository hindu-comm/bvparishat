Most members of the group may agree with the idea expressed in Sri Venkat's following words:

  
"We all appreciate your debate but kindly give up on the personal attacks, which make this uncomfortable reading. It is entirely possible for two well meaning individuals to dig trenches on the different sides of a battlefield convinced that they are on the side of truth."

As such , the discussion may go round and round without end.

The thread is being closed.
