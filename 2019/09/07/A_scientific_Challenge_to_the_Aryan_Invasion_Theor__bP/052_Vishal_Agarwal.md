OIT never was the only "official" game in town. There are other models that posit arrival of IIr languages into India before early Harappan. An extremely thorough displacement in every way during post Harappan times appears really quite a stretch. Anyway, I am not sure if this discussion belongs to this forum.

  

What is clear however is that the colonial Aryanist invasion paradigms have nine lives.
