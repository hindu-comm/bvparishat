Prof. Paturi,

  

Yes, thank you. And yes, I have seen the same kind of "audience pleasing" by AMT theorists that they attribute to Shinde. In some company these people insist that there was no invasion and it was migration, but either give tacit or overt support to very bad people in India using AIT (not AMT) for politicalpurposes.

  

So we are to believe that an advanced city civilization dwindled, found themselves unable to build cities elsewhere, retained 70% genes in the population (worst case!), but adopted the customs of uncivilized "immigrants". Makes perfect sense :-).

  

This is not to say OIT has no problems either.

  

But what is clear is that AIT has been used by nefarious political forces in India with disastrous results. That is very clear to me. There is either an underhanded motive among Western scholars or they are incredibly naive.

  

Ramakrishnan
