Given the sweeping claims made in the paper (that are aligned 100% with AIT scenarios), it is pertinent that some questions be asked about this paper:

  

1\. The authors cite mere 1 reference #61 to hang their hat on the premise that in ancient times, languages spread primarily by movements of people.

  

2\. If the IE languages arrived in N India via Yamanya invaders who were all males, the same should have happened on the Iranian plateau which is Indo-Iranian. Unless I missed something, the paper is silent about how Iranian language spread on the Iranian Pleateau is mirrored by genetic movements.

  

3\. The paper finds a strong positive correlation between Yamanya genes and Brahmanas (with a few exceptions). As the later came between 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE, which per the invasionist paradigms, is also equal to the time of the composition of the Rigveda, the assumption is that the varna system with rigid anuloma marriages was already in vogue in the Rgvedic times. This is yet to be demonstrated.

  

4\. The Vedic scriptures talk about the 'Kuru-Panchala' Brahmanas, with the Panchalas themselves having been 'Srinjayas' in earlier times and located further NW. It is this region that forms the core area of original Kshatriya and Brahmana communities. It is precisely these regions that formed the areas devastated by Shakas, Abhiras etc., noted in Mahabharata and elsewhere. While some would want to date the Mahabharata to 3100 BCE, I have assumed dates closer to 1400-1300 BCE (which is one of the dates derived by archae-astronomy - I would not want to enter into a digression debate here). So why can't we assume that these Abhiras etc left a genetic footprint on the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas disproprtionately because of their geographical locale and in turn got absorbed culturally and linguistically themselves? After all, despite massive Islamic male invasions to India lasting several centuries, they could not convert IA speakers to IIr or Turkic, and could convert a mere 15-20% of the population till the 19th century to Islam. So why are we assuming that a group of Yamanya invaders could effect all over Pakistan, India etc., what Muslim invaders were unable to? Even in ancient India, we have had massive invasions by Greeks, Huns, Shakas (the Yuga Purana notes that they slaughtered 1 in 4 inhabitants in NW India, and the flight of many Brahmanas to peninsular Indian coincides with their invasions) but no massive replacement of language, religion or culture. It is not even worthy repeating here how the RV is silent about migrations from Central Asia, and is massively a NW Indian scripture. Also consider the fact that whereas even Kshatriya clans were raised from people from interior India, the Brahmana communities were rarely descendants from original inhabitants of the Kuru Panchala Saraswata areas (exceptions include Konkanasthas Brahmanas, Sorath Brahmanas of TN). The paper should has acknowledged that the Catholic Brahmanas (themselves Sarasvats) are excluded, but does not further discuss how the Konkanasthas, Mohyals, Dogras and other Brahmana groups fared genetically.

  

5\. While talking about the languages spoken in the Indus Sarasvati area., they make two suggestions - one is the Indological viewpoint that proto Dravidian was spoken (and here, the authors reference the questionable view not controverted that Brahui language is indigenous to Baluchistan), or that a non Dravidian language was spoken there. If the latter, then what was that language, given that the authors do not seem to favor any other linguistic groups like TB or Austronesian? (thereby controverting Witzel's observations that the earlier layers of RV have no Dravidian loanwords but have para-Munda loan words)? The former is in face even more problematic because it does not explain how the Dravidian Harappans moved massively to W UP but without the proto Dravidian language.

  

6\. One would have liked to see a listing of the Indian populations, specifically the groups like Abhirs, Jats and so on. Raw data is always very useful. How did the 80-90% non Brahmana population of UP, Bihar, Haryana etc. become Indo Aryan and Vedic?

  

7\. The Indus Peripheral Cline is based on a few outlier individuals exhumed from burials from extreme NW India (Chitral and Swat - BTW, the modern Swatis are recent immigrants into that area) but we can not be sure that they represent the typical IVC type. Their AHG proportion is indeed quite high.

  

Genetic research is very laborious and therefore papers in this area typically have dozens of authors. Unfortunately, whosoever interpreted the data just adopted the path of least resistance. Perhaps because the corresponding author is at Harvard, and the overbearing influence of Hinduphobic people like Richard Meadow and Witzel can be easily surmised. If Vasant Shinde is a co-author of the paper, but says something different in newspaper interviews, that surely says something, especially when haters like Steve Farmer have commented off and on that Shinde has turned Hindu nationalist!
