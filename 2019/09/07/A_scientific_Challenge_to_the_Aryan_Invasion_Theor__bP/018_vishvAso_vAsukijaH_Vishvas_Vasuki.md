Though I personally don't mind, I agree with this as a general rule - albeit once an opinion is offered, one is forced to respond in kind.

This I disagree with. Posts by Vishal and Suresh are quite good.  
  
If there is any deterioration in the thread, it is because of vacuous comments like "I don't see the point of this thread", "this thread is deteriorating" etc.. If someone has nothing valuable to contribute to a thread, it is best to move on.

Valuable discussion is possible at a higher level as well. Analysis and science is not mere discussion of plots and algorithms. I don't think this kind of preaching is warranted, unless the higher-level discussion misrepresents the underlying data (as it often happens on this topic in this forum - example by you in 2016).
