Vishal:

  

While I am sympathetic to your position and agree with yours, I am confused as to why you are making this personal with Vishvas. It is possible to be passionate in defense of your theory without getting personal and throwing the kitchen sink at the other side.

  

Also fyi--WIth rare exceptions like Parashurama and Drona who took up arms for various reasons, any akshauhinis would have been lead by a Kshatriya not a Brahmana.

Most Brahmanas of even 200 years back cannot be compared with what we have now. Chaturvedi exists only in name these days.

You do not understand a "Brahmana" and claim to be better than them in all respects .... how can you be better when you do not even understand them? Is this passive aggression? This shows an implicit assumption that you also believe that they somehow controlled "Narrative" to suit themselves.

  

All this pride and posturing comes from jAti and not an understanding of varNa.

  

In a human body, the pancreas cannot claim to be better of than the intestines or the brain or the heart or the stomach. Instead of watching Harry Potter go watch the "Last Samurai"

Nathan Algren had a much better understanding of varNa than most although he doesnt use that exact word

  

**Colonel Bagley**: The rebels don't have a single rifle. They're savages with bows and arrows.

**Algren**: Whose sole occupation for the last thousand years has been war.

  

The purusha sukta mentions this alone.

When the mouth eats all organs receive their due and they are reborn and rejuvenated.

The nourishment is not localised to the arms (kshatriyas) or the mouth (Brahmanas) as many seem to think nor do the legs try and do the work of the hands (unless ones' hands have been lost ofcourse)

Does that mean that a leg is somehow vestigial compared to a mouth or the hands?

  

A lot of this dvesha comes from similar perverted understanding and posturing.

  

All the best,

  

Venkat
