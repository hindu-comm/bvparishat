Since Irene and Vishal asked, here is a summary of the position I favor (most of it is pretty mainstream - whether it is PV kANe/ tiLak or westerners ):

\- First came early hominids such as H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP.

\- Then came early hunter gatherer (=IHG) groups - currently reflected in isolated Indian tribes. Those close to the un-admixed old Indian H-G Are the south Indian tribes from the Tamil country like the Irula, Malayan, Kadar, Pulliyar and Paniya. They are the deeply divergent mainland sister group of the Onge/Jarawa of the Andamans. A represent a remnant population of early out of Africa immigrants who first reached India. There they might have mixed with one or more preexisting archaic Homo (one might have been the Denisovans) but the details of that are limited. These old Indian HG tribes share a deep ancestry with the Onge, Papuans, Naasioi and Australians.

\- Then came the Iranian farmer influx. Indus Valley civilization (IVC) area were settled by a people heavy in Iranian Farmer input (over a prior IHG substrate). The shudra-s, early enemy of the Arya-s, not to be confused with the later varNa, may have been part of these people. Many of the middle and service castes are positions on this cline of Indian HG-IRF admixture and have a genetic heritage predominantly of this type. The supports the idea that the diversified service jAti-s typical of India developed in the Harappan system and continued relatively intact after the subsequent Aryan conquest of the land. The IVC language was not Dravidian, but went on to form the substrate of IndoAryan.  

\- Then came the Aryan invasion and consolidation. This likely happened in collaboration with a faction of IVC elites, some of whom were later incorporated in the highest echolons of Arya society. The soma cult, a distinct feature of I-Ir branch, might have come from them.

\- Then came the Austraasiatic influx dated to be approximately around 3000 YBP with a lower bound of 3800 YBP. The Indian movement was clearly male-biased raising the strong possibility that it was an invasion with a military dimension of armed nomadic groups.

\- Then we have the Dravidian bloom. Harappans spoke a now lost/ subsumed language. In their southern borderlands were DR speakers who admixed with them and acquired some of the Harappan cultural elements. IA met, and culturally influenced Dravidian language speakers, leading to acquisition of beneficial meme-plexes. They, as a consequence, expanded in to peninsular India, mixing and linguistically dominating the proto-Indian tribes. This is indicated by estimated time of L1 haplotype’s blooming after the blooming of the R1a haplotype.  

\- Finally, during the Islamic invasions, we get some Turkik input.  

  

Now, the Arya-s merit special attention:

\- Indo-Aryans initially resided in the area around/ beyond the Black Sea, and were familiar with cold and long dawns (as evidenced by some parts of the Vedic texts - long ashvina-shastra to be recited at dawn).  

\- They radiated out widely, merged with and dominated prior occupants in vast tracts of Eurasia (just as they did in India, Iran etc..). Half of Western European men descended from one Bronze Age ‘king’.  

\- In India, they similarly merged with a faction of IVC people. Steppe ancestry seen in BMAC first \~2100 BCE.

\- Early Arya society consisted of common people (the vish), kShatriya-s and brAhmaNa-s - the lattter formed the elite, and were relatively fluid in early times. The vish might have traded with core IVC people long before the invasions.  

\- The core portions of RV or even YV far predate their invasion of India. Just equinotical position indicated by the naxatra-sUkta puts it at around 2200BC, not to mention Thuban, other relatively oblique astronomical references.  

\- They came in multiple waves. The late RV sarayu and gomati were to the west. They were later moved east perhaps indeed with the movement of ikShavAkus.

\- Along with that came great tumult and civil war (eg: mahAbhArata). In the end, kuru-pAnchAla realm was where major brAhmaNa vedic consolidation happened. Gradually, this culture and its carriers (mainly in the form of brAhmaNa-s) spread elsewhere in India and beyond. The hymns were recast, reorganized and their preservation was there shored up.

Conservation of core vaidika ideas over millennia and across genepool-shifts involved evolution of a well-developed and influential ritualist caste (brAhmaNa-s) with a powerful oral tradition and specifically a grammatical tradition that allowed preservation of the language, especially in ritual. However envious a viSh may be, I just find it silly that he would be blind this exceptional ability - not to mention the pretty straight-forward cases where such take-over did happen (whether Greece, greater Europe, Turkey or India).

Wrong- that's just aDNA. Earlier papers have estimated admixture date from extensive sampling of extant population. aDNA just confirms it.

Classic confirmation bias. Anyway, correction - Golwalkar is not in the same league here. He started this nativism folly, and their "Organizer" continues that comedy.

They make a cart into a charriot. Anyway, the horse was no where as central to Harrappan culture as it was to ancient Aryan or Turkik or Mongol cultures.

But beware brahma-dveSha (of which envious deprecation is the first step) can unfortunately turn even a vish into an anArya!
