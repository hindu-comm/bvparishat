I prefer to go by opinions such as : "गुणाः पूजास्थानं गुणिषु न च लिङ्गं न च वयः" and "न तेन वृद्धो भवति येनास्य पलितं शिरः। यो वै युवाप्यधीयानस् तन् देवाः स्थविरं विदुः।।".  
Further, however old I become, I personally wouldn't want to be treated condescendingly: "Just ignore that old man, no use pointing out his errors" - that's just disrespect clothed in superficial respect. So, going by the golden rule, I don't treat others that way (though yes - I've been so advised offline). I wouldn't even want those fake prostrations. YMMV, of course. There is no single "right answer".  

Also, I don't think that the greatness of BVP will be enhanced by diluting discussion-effectiveness in favour of drama.  

  

I do, of course, respect people to the extant that they are people (with extra consideration for their age, gender, role, expertise) - that does not mean that I don't/ shouldn't honestly point out errors or disagreements if I so desire. It is generally contrary to my nature to sugar-coat while doing so; and indeed also inappropriate/ ineffective in certain cases.
