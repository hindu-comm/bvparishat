Dear Scholars,

It is my pleasure to present the digitized version of the following book before you.

Nānārthamañjarī of Rāghava

  

<https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/nanarthamanjari_raghava/orig/nanarthamanjari.txt>

  

Credits -  

The work was digitized by Dr. P. Srinivas as part of Sansknet project.

Some errors here and there have been corrected in the present work.  

  

N.B. -  

Some scholars have asked for an easier way to download the existing collection of Sanskrit koshas. <https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/archive/master.zip> holds the data in zip format.  

Book_Author/orig/Book.txt is the usual place where you will find the text e.g. nanarthamanjari_raghava/orig/nanarthamanjari.txt

  

--  

Dr. Dhaval Patel, I.A.S

Collector and District Magistrate, Surat
