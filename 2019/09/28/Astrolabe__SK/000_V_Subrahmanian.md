The following image was shared with this information:

  

This Astrolabe (used as ancient navigation system) in the Geneva museum of science history. Zoom in and see! The letters all have sanskrit script and our rashis are depicted. From around 14th century. A proof of India's strong astronomical prowess!!

Could the object and the claim be authenticated on the basis of our ancient texts?
