On 'Ashwayuja Shukla Pratipat' there is a practise of doing "mAtAmaha shrAddha" by grandson whose parents are still alive. Would like to know its pramAna/practise across different communities.

  

Not related to above question but in general, heard that, if someone does shrAddha in Badri, one should not do "pinda shrAddha" ever again thereafter. Only sankalpa shrAddha is prescribed as per some purANa. Can some one throw some light on this as well with pramANa ?

  

Regards

Shyam
