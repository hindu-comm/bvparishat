Dear Scholars,

  Namaste.

  

  In his article "The Early Publications of the Serampore Missionaries", IA, June 1903, pp.241-254, Sir George Grierson in quoting the Serampore Sixth Memoir dated March 1816, signed by W. Carey, J. Marshman and W. Ward, refers to it as '**the first attempt at a systematic survey of the languages of India**'. \[see the pic. attached\]  
  
  In the Seventh Memoir of 1820, he reports, "**A coloured map of the languages of India is given**". \[see the pic. attached\]  
  
  BTW, has this Seventh Memoir of 1820 survived? If yes, it would be interesting to see the coloured map of the languages of the then India.  
  
Thanks and regards  
Narayan Prasad
