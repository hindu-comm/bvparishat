\<\< Here's a library that seems to have Memoirs 2-9: ... I suggest contacting them, especially if you have specific questions about these documents, including the map query you raised earlier.>\>

  

Thanks for the information.

The Seventh Memoir containing the coloured language map is the most important. But how to contact them?

Only the map is missing in the copy of the Seventh Memoir on [archive.org](http://archive.org), other things appear to be complete.

Of course, the Tenth Memoir is the most informative, which is already available on [archive.org](http://archive.org).

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
