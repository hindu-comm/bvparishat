Here's a library that seems to have Memoirs 2-9:

  

<https://www.worldcat.org/title/memoirs-respecting-the-translations-of-the-sacred-scriptures-into-the-languages-of-india/oclc/55203646&referer=brief_results>

  

I suggest contacting them, especially if you have specific questions about these documents, including the map query you raised earlier.
