BTW, today (29-10-2019) I traced a link of "Seventh Memoir respecting the Translations of the Sacred Scriptures into the Languages of India, conducted by the Brethren of Serampore":<https://ia800906.us.archive.org/13/items/seventhmemoirres00sera/seventhmemoirres00sera.pdf>

  

It is dated as "Dec. 1, 1820" at p.40.  

  

But it does not have any map.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
