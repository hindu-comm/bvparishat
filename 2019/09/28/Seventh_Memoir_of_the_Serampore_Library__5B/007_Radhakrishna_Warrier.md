Till recently I had a colleague who was a Maharashtrian from Tanjore.
She recently left the company. According to her, her ancestors came centuries ago to Tanjore from Pune on the invitation of the Maharaja of Tanjore. She said she is Madhva Brahmin and Madhva Maharashtrian Brahmins intermarry with Madhva Kannada Brahmins. Her husband is a Madhva Kannada Brahmin. I didn't ask her what language they spoke at home - probably English because they are in the US now.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
