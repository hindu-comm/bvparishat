I'm the 6th generation Tanjore Maharashtrian.

  

Our ancestor moved from Satara to Anantapur during Shahu Maharaj's reign sometimes 200 years back.

All my relatives speak Tanjore Marathi. Though I have passive control over it, I'm not fluent in it in speaking. I noticed the following features of this language.

a\) The Tanjore Marathi spoken in different parts of South India is now influenced largely by the local languages. Thus from the Tanjore Marathi they speak, I can immediately locate the state they belong to or where they grew up.  

b\) The phenomenon of Sandhi is found very prominently in Tanjore Marathi. We see words such as

uuba + vaaraa -> ubhaaraa (literally hot air )

kaa.dhuuna ghe -> kaa.dhinga

c\) use of old Marathi words such as [parasaaka.de](http://parasaaka.de) (litereally towards the parasa/ the space behind your house, but) used for toilet, since toilets used to be in the backyards

or the verb 'कळणे' to mean 'to know', and then there are usages such as

तुला कळल का ? to mean तुला माहित आहे का ?

I do not know whether the Marathi 200 years back had such usages of the verb कळणे.  

  

I do not know of any systematic study of this language, but I know a Marathi grammar written in the style of Panini's grammar for the Marathi. and Prof. Arjunawadakar had written an article on this grammar, known as Maharashtra Prayoga Chandrika, a manuscript found in the South.

I had noticed some of the features discussed there are also applicable to Tanjore Marathi.  

  

Best,

Amba
