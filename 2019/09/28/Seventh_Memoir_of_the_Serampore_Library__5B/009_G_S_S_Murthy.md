In parts of South Karnataka, often one finds tailors (darji) speaking Marathi. Surprisingly tailors in Mumbai speak Kannada! I do not know if tailors form a community. Several such mix ups can be seen. Tamil being spoken in Karnataka (Iyengars, Sanketis); Telugu being spoken in Karnataka ( Vaishyas). I would be surprised if these migrations have not been so far studied.

Regards,

Murthy
