The Tamil spoken by Iyengars and many Iyers who are settled in Karnataka for very long is distinct from the Tamil spoken by these very groups in Tamil Nadu. The blending of Kannada can be seen clearly in their language. Similarly the Kannada spoken by Madhvas settled in Tamil Nadu for long, in areas such as Madurai, Coimbatore, Srirangam, etc. is quite different, with a load of Tamil intonations and even words, from the Kannada spoken by that very group settled in Karnataka. Such differences do exist owing to influence of the local language on one's mothertongue.
