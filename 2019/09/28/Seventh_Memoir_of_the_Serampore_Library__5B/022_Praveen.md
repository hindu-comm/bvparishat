Dear Sir,

  

It is interesting to see that at least there is something mentioned about Sali community. I was wondering that is there any Survey of Marathi Dialects the way Bh. Krishnamurti gaaru has done a detailed Telugu Dialects survey based on different occupations (Pottery, Fisheries etc). I don't know that whether such kind of survey was conducted on other dravidian languages or not.

  

  

  

  

Regards,

Praveen
