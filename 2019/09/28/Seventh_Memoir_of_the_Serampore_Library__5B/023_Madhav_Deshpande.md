Dear Praveen Ji,

  

  Several volumes of descriptions of various Marathi dialects were published under the editorship of the Late Professor A. M. Ghatage by the Deccan College in Pune. I have a few of those publications, but I don't remember seeing a volume dealing with the Marathi of Tanjore.
There is an ongoing project of preparing a Marathi Dialect Atlas at the Deccan College. Here is some information:
