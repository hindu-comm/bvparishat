\<\< From the context, Kunkuna here refers to Konkani language, related to Marathi, and spoken in the region of Konkan, the coastal region from Maharashtra up to northern Kerala.>\>

  

Sir, thank you for clarification. I was under the impression that Konkani is spoken only in Goa. Calicut is rather far away from there and so I thought Kunkuna might be a dialect of Malayalam.

  

Regards. Narayan Prasad.
