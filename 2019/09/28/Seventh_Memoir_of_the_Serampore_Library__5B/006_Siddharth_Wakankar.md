Sir,

The same happened with me.

  

I was introduced to a Maharashtrian Sanskrit scholar from Tanjore,but,he spoke Marathi which I hardly understood.

  

Secondly,many GSBrahmins are settled in Kochi. Though they don't understand Marathi,in their temple- Devaswom- they play Marathi Saint poetry,written in Malayalam.

  

This also be noted in this context.
