The ancestors of Konkani speakers of Kerala and Mangaluru (Mangalore) were originally from Goa. When the Portuguese occupied Goa and started religious persecution, these Konkani speakers left their homeland and settled in Karnataka and Kerala. In Kerala, most of the Konkani speakers are either Gauda Saraswat Brahmins or those who call themselves Kudumbi (perhaps from the Konkani / Marathi word Kurmi). A Konkani friend of mine (from Kerala) once went to Goa and when he returned I asked him if he could understand the present day Konkani of Goa. He said he could, but it was very difficult. He couldn't easily converse with them because his Konkani and the present day Goan Konkani differed a lot.
