Namaskara

  

Although comparison comes at its own cost, but I think about Vaisheshika philosophy somehow as Physics minus mathematics. This comparison is based on what all little amount of information I have till now. I would like to know if anywhere in the history of ancient and medieval Indian philosophy, someone combined Vaisheshika philosophy and mathematics, kind of like the physics we see today.

  

Regards
