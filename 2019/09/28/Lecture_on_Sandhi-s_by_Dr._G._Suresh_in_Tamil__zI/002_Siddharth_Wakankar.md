Suprabhat.

  

It is a very novel and nice idea to have lectures on such topics like Panchasandhis in the Rupakas.

  

It was first Prof. Dr. T. G. Mainkar who worked on this topic for his Ph.D. Later on,it was published in a book form, some,50/60 years ago.

  

A pioneering and wonderful effort.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
