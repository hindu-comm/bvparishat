For the benefit of those who need, let me clarify that Sandhi being covered in the lecture is not Sandhi of grammar, like guNasandhi.

  

It is Sandhi of itivritta (plot/ story/ narrative) analysis mostly found in Roopaka S'aastra and as such (mistakenly) considered to belong to that S'aastras (only). (In fact it can be used for plot analysis in any narrative literary genre.

  

It is popular as pancha Sandhi analysis

  

In English (Western poetics) there is a similar model of analysis of five stages /phases of story.

  

Exposition, Development, Climax, Denoument, and Conclusion.

  

But the Sanskrit one is more detailed and intricate because each stage here is a Sandhi a combination of arthopakshepakas = purpose-achievement levels and kaaryaavasthas = statuses of action .

  

mukha (face), pratimukha ( obverse face), garbha (womb), avamarsa ( doubt or pause), and nirvahana a (final resolution) are the five Sandhis.  

  

The Natyas'aastra related literature has amazingly intricate details of this model of story analysis.

  

The speaker is covering those intricate details systematically and rigorously.
