Namaste Prof. Deshpande,

  

\> While reading Raghuvaṃśa in Pune, we started with the second sarga, rather than the first.

\> I wonder if there is some tradition for that.

  

Quoting below, from "Notes On Traditional Sanskrit Teaching:Dominik Wujastyk,South Asia Research 1981; 1; 30":

"*When the boys know their paradigms the teacher takes up the second chapter of the Raghuvaṃśa.*

*...*

*And the second chapter of the work in particular is chosen because Chapter One describes a curse, and that would be a most inauspicious beginning. Chapter Two, by contrast , gives the selfless example of King Dilipa who offered his own life to a lion in place of that of the cow. What better way to drum life’s essentials into the young minds?*"
