In the Telugu speaking areas, the belief is that the pravachana or paaraayaNa of ViraaTa parvam brings rain (during drought ) .

  

This mahimaa is traced by pravachanakaaras to the maahaatmya of Yudhishthira. His presence at Matsya Kingdom brings prosperity to them.

  

Probably ,if there is a belief to start with Virata Parvam, it too could be related to this maahaatmya.
