Dear scholars, namaskars and greetings for the Devi navaratris,

  

While giving talks on the Mahabharata, there is a practice in the Telugu states to start with Virata parvam. It is said to be auspicious to do so because it ends with a marriage. Does this practice exist in other parts of India? If so, is there any reason for that?

And also, is there any pramana?

Aravinda Rao
