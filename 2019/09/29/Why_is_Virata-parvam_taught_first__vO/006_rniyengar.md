In Mysore in the Samskrit Pathashala we were taught first the 11th sarga of RV. Similarly Kumarasambhava started with the 5th sarga. The only reason I could fathom after I grew up was that the above two Sargas were considered easy to follow by 8-10 year old children than other chapters of the poem. Personally, I found RV -11 easier than KS-5. However the latter caught up on me slowly so much so I remain mesmerized by शैलाधिराजतनया नययौ नतस्थौ \|\|
