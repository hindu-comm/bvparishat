A poet can write on any topic or subject a poet is ever free. Nether is a poet bound by time, space or personality. I would like to know what is the purpose of such writing. Is to get political patronage or lime light or simply are continuing a tradition before it was the kings and now it will be on chief ministers, prime ministers and presidents of India. I am asking this question, considering this to be a spontaneous over of a 13 year old  

Regards
