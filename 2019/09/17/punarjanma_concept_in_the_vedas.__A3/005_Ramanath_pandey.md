Dear Professor,  
Namaste  
the term punarjanm- is not mentioned in vedas . There are many terms  
which have not mentioned in vedas like Isvara, punarjanma and many  
other. However, punarjanm concept is indirectly mentioned. In  
Kathopanisad and also in other upanisada. A wavering answer comes  
forth in the Katha Upanishad to this great question. A complete,  
satisfying answer can be found in certain other Upanishads, such as  
the Chhandogya and the Brihadaranyaka Upanishads. Tentatively Yama  
tells Nachiketas that when the body is shed, one takes rebirth. One  
can become anything according to the thoughts and the feelings  
entertained by the person during the tenure of this life. If there is  
even a single desire, rebirth is unavoidable for the fulfillment of  
that desire. If we have fulfilled all our desires in this birth itself  
and nothing more is left, that would be good for us. All our desires  
melt here itself in the light of the Self. No desire can stand before  
the blaze of the knowledge of the Self. As the cloud of mist cannot  
stand before the blaze of the sun, this muddle of the cloud of desires  
cannot stand before the light of the Self, which is the Atman.  
With regards  
Ramanath
