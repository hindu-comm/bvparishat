Namaste,

  

Sorry to bring this controversial topic to this group.

I wanted to get various views on this topic. If someone has addressed this already, pleaselet me know.

  

Some opponents of Vedas state that -

> "The concept of punarjanma is never mentioned in the vedas. Hence, > Vedas agree with rest of the semitic religions (such as Christianity > and Islam)in this aspect that there is one life only till the > judgement day. After the judgement day there may be sort of a rebirth, > to facilitate extreme punishment to hardcore criminals, by giving them > new skins and torture them again.

> However, Some Hindu scholars using smrtis somehow invented the concept > of the 'cycle of birth and death', which is foreign to the Vedas!
> Further, the Bhagavadgita does not represent Vedas correctly, since it > was told by Sage vyAsa and may have additional authors who may have > added stuff to suit their views" >

Has anyone looked into this issue? Please guide.
