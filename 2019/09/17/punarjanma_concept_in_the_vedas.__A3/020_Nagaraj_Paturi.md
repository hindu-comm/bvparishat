I must have mentioned that that is a distinct Swami Dayananda Saraswati's, and thus Arya Samaj's way of looking at those mantras. Other commentaries of the same mantras may have a different view.

Rebirth, punarjanma is one of the common , distinct, central ideas of the three Dhaarmic traditions, Vedic , Buddhist and Jain.

  

The debate is centred around whether the idea was originally that of the avaidika Dhaarmic traditions namely Buddhist and Jain, borrowed into Vaidika tradition from the avaidika traditions or was it pre-Buddhist in Vaidika tradition.

  

I cited the article by Dr Joanna Jurewicz to show the arguments in favor of the idea of rebirth being from the Rig Veda itself.

  

The rebirth of the Purusha in Purusha Sukta is prototypical.
