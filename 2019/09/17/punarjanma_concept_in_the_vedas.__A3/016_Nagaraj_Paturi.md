> “O God! Thou conductest our pranas. We pray Thee that we may be happy > whenever we may assume another body after death. Grant us, O God! The > eyes and all the other senses, the pranas and the inner senses in our > future birth when we may assume another body after forsaking the > present. Do Thou grant us that when we are born again we may enjoy > uninterruptedly all enjoyable thins. May we be able to see the > luminous sun and the ingoing and outgoing pranas in all our rebirths. > O God! Thou art the dispenser of honor and happiness, make us happy in > all our rebirths, through Thy grace.”  
> “Be gracious, O Lord! To grant that in our rebirths the earth may give > us prana born of food and strength, the bright light of the sun may > give us prana and middle region may give us life; the juices of > medicines such as soma, may give us body (bodily health and vigor). O > God! Thou art the giver of strength and nourishment, show us in our > rebirths the path of virtue (dharma). We pray that happiness be our > lit in all our births through Thy grace.”
