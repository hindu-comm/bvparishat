The Taittiriya Aranyaka has a passage in which sage Bharadvaja is said to have continued Brahmacarya for three जन्म s. At the end of the third birth, when Bharadvaja was very old and weak, Indra approached him and asked, 'If I give you another birth, what you would do with that?'. "I would definitely continue my Vedic studies confining to Brahmacarya" was Bharadva's firm answer. See the passage:
