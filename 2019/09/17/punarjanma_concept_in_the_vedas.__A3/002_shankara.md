Krishna ji,

  

Jagannatha Sastri Saraswat has written a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita based on the Vedas. In his commentary on BG 2.21, Vaasaamsi Jiirnaani..., he quotes a number of Rgveda mantras in support of punarjanma.

  

Title of the book is 'Bhagavad Gita Aur Veda Gita'. It also contains a critical introduction of nearly 250 pages by Gangeshwaranandaji Maharaj.

  

Its copies can be obtained from <http://gurugangeshwaranandjimaharaj.org/?sermon=rebuilding-the-walls>

shankara
