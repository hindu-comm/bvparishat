The film is of 45 minutes duration. The DVD costs just Rs.200 which every Pathashala, College, University and individuals can easily afford. One can buy the DVD and screen the film in the classroom/auditorium. Members of BVP who are in authority in any institution may take note of this and spread the message among their institutions, other groups, etc. throughout the country and abroad.
