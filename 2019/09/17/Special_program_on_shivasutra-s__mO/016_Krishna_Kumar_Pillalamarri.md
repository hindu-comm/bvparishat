Dear Dr. Pandurangi,

  

I am highly impressed with the introduction to this film. I would like to see it, and will not mind paying for it. How can I see it? Whatever the technology, such films are worth seeing and spreading theword. Can you kindly take the additional pain of finding out how the film is distributed, so we can all see it?

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
