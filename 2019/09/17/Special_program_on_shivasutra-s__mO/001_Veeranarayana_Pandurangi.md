Dear All

it is to bring to your notice that recently we in KSU have got a chance to see Shivasutrajala motion film produced and directed byProf. SR Leela, member of BVP.

This is the film for introduction of Panini to beginners. It is very well conceived to make an impression of viewers. Produced in Samskrit Kannada Hindi and English it narrates the story of Panini and his techniques of Pratyahara based on Shivasutras. It also depicts the Sthana system for the help of students. what cannot be easily taught to beginners through Laghusiddhantakaumudi can be easily comprehended by viewingthis film.

I request all our pathashalas and Universities must arrange a show of this to their students.

I congratulate again Dr Leela for making this material available to us.

  

  

Prof. SR Leela is well known for her services to Samskrit language, being a samskrit professor in NMKRV college, and founding Abhinaya Bharati, for the propagation of Bharata's Natya style (not the tradtional bharatanatyam dance). She has produced several motion pictures in samskrit plays of Bhasa.
