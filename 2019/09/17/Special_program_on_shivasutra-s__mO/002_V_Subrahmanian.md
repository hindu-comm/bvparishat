It was a delectable program when Dr.Leela gave a very interesting talk on Panini in particular and our ancient texts/sciences in general. She kindled the fire in every listener to open one's eyes and ears to the treasure that lay in our possession and bring it out to benefit one and all. The film, made out of her own funds, is very nicely made. Music and dance have been deftly used and visuals to bring out the message. She demonstrated by her talk and the film show the power of the visual medium to bring the topic such as grammar to the hearts of common people.
