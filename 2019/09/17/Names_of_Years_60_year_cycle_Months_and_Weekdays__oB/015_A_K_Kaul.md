Shri Venkat Veera Raghavan ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your kind words!

Yes, it has been a real crusade not only online but even off line since I have approached all the concerned government departments as well asrevered *jagadgurus* etc. etc.

There has been a deafening silence from almost all quarters.

It is therefore high time that the real scholars of our Vedic and Pauranik etc. lore wake up to the situation before it is too late.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
