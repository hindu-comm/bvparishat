Dear Shri Veera Raghavanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your kind response.

It has taken me quite some time to collate all the information and hence the delay in replying your mail.

\< Have you tried talking to the Shringeri, Ahobilam and Kanchi mutts?>

Yes, I did make representations to all the respected Jagadurus, excepting for Ahobilam.

A representation was also made to His Holiness Jagadguru Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti, which he appears to have passed on to some astrologers, who "vetoed" in favour of "Chitrapaksha" (read Lahiri ) Rashichakra. I, being a very small fry, was not even asked for any clarifications nor informed about the outcome. I came to know about the same through the "*aadesha-patra*" of His Holiness in a Gujaratri Panchang named "Janma-Bhoomi". (Attachment Kanchi-Kamakoti Aadeshapatra).

However, Shri T V Sivaraman had received a message from that Samsthan, appreciatingtheir efforts to streamline the Hindu Panchanga. (Attachment Kanchakamakoti message)

Regarding Dwarka Mutt, a letter was received by Shri T V Sivaraman from that Samsthan appreciating that they were propagating a Sayana calendar that had been advocated/advised by the Dwarka Mutt itself about twelve decades back. (Attachment \_Dwarka).

In spite of these encouraging messages, the fact of the matter is that there is absolutely no institution that is celebrating, much less advising others to celebrate, festivals and muhurtas on correct days.

\<There are many well connected Vidvans in this forumand they will be able to put you in touch with the right people and get you a good hearing.>          It would really be a boon to the entire Hindu community if any such Vidvans of this august forum approach the concerned people, whether in or out of government or the Samsthans so that the derailed Hindu calendar is put back on the right track.

IMHO and to the best of my knowledge, somehow, an impression has been created in the minds of almost the entire Hindu community, either deliberately or unknowingly that the tropical (known as Sayana) Rashichakra is meant only and only for predictions by Western system of astrology and that is why it is known as Western Rashichakra. And that is also the reason for it being an anathema to the nirayana astrologers, who call themselves Vedic astrologers, in spite of the fact that there are neither so called Sayana nor nirayana Rashish in the entire Vedic lore nor any of the Vedangas, available as on date!

Things have become all the more confusing as some overseas "Vamadevas" have jumped into the fray in support of nirayana astrology and thereby nirayana Rashis!

In fact, till a few decades back, the nirayana astrology was known as sidereal astrology or Hindu astrology whereas the term Vedic astrology was coined only to make it generate interest (and thereby dollars!) in overseas countries also!

And as shown in several of my mails, the entire Hindu scriptural lore, including the Vedic literature and the Pauranick as well as siddhantic lore is aligned entirely and without exception to seasonal years and months of the Vedas and Tropical Rashis of the Puranas and siddhantas etc.

When such facts were brought to the notice of "Vedic-astrological" forums they summarily blocked me instead of trying to prove me wrong.

Some "religious" forums have put me on moderation and they never allow such mails to appear there, as if I am rendering the greatest disservice to the Hindu community by trying to align the Hindu festivals and muhurtas with the scriptures!

In this regard, I will be sending shortly a separate mail titled "Is Sayana (Tropical) Rashichakra really Western?"  

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
