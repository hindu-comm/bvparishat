Respected Shri Nagaraj Paturiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your prompt response.

\< Please help the dates for sankalpa. \>

It is not only the solar months that have become topsy-turvy, but even the names of lunar months have been "advanced" by one month!

For example, the real Sharadiya Navratras started on August 31 and
ended on September 7 and it was Vijaya Dashmi on September 8 actually but the entire Hindu community will start celebrating those Navratras from September 29 (-after one month and a quarter month of Sharad Ritu is already over!)--to October 7, 2019. To make matters worse, Sarvapitra Amavasya will be celebrated on September 28, 2019, which is actually the real Dipavali as per all the shastras! The real Mahalaya/Sarva-Pitra-amavasya was on August 30, exactly a month before the fictitious Pitra-Amavasya!

\<People may follow you during their sankalpa. \>

I do not have any "creed" of my own nor do I want/have any followers as such. I am just keeping some unpalatable harsh facts before the common man. It is for them to ponder on the same and do whatever they think is best for them!

There is, however, a tri-lingual "Reformed Hindu Panchang" available on

[www.reformedhindupanchang.in](http://www.reformedhindupanchang.in) and/or

[rspanchang.in](http://rspanchang.in)

It is in English, Tamil and Hindi and has been prepared by a Tamilian Brahmin, Shri T V Sivaraman, on the basis of "Shri Mohan Arsha Patrakam" in Hindi, published by Sri Darshaney Lokesh ([darshane...@gmail.com]() or [darshane...@yahoo.com]()).

It gives all the relevant details about tithi, nakshatra and festivals etc. on the basis of the Vedic, Pauranic and the siddhantic lore and can be used for Samkalpa also.

Hard copies of Hindi version can be had from Shri Darshaneya Lokesh and of tri-lingual edition from Shri Sivaraman.

Regarding the nomenclature of lunar months, I am replying the relevant mail separately!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A. K. Kaul
