Respected Shri Nagaraj Paturiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<<http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/indian_months.html> \>

A lunar new year is supposed to start from Chaitra Shukla Pratipat and the Full Moon of that Chaitra is supposed to be linked to Chitra nakshatra! It is a very important festival for the entire Hindu community the world over when a new Panchanga (for the new lunar year) is supposed to start. It is also known as Vasanti Navratra, Gudi-Padva, Ugadi and so on.

It is not clear as to how, when and why the names of lunar months like Chaitra etc. are supposed to have got linked to Purnima being conjunct with Chitra etc. nakshatras. There is no such phenomenon in the Vedic lore nor in the Vedanga Jyotisham nor in the siddhantas much less in any of the Puranas!

Besides, the 27 equal nakshatras, subsumed in ''almighty" Lahiri Rashichakra, which are being used these days, are quite imaginary in fact, and unrelated to the relevant stars of the namesake nakshatra divisions as the Vedas talk of 28 nakshatras, which are of quite unequal spans. (Attachment nakshatras-vis-a-vis-stars1)

Similarly, as per the attachment SKE2, Srimad Bhagavata (and many other Puranas) club Ashvini etc. nakshatras with seasonal Mesha etc. Rashis

The Bhagavata says in 5/22/5

....द्वादश मासान् भुङ्क्ते राशि संज्ञान् सम्वत्सरावयवान् मासः पक्ष द्वयं दिवानक्तं चेति सपादर्क्ष द्वयं उपदिशन्ति यावता षष्ठं अंशं भुञ्जीत स वै ऋतुरिति उपदिश्यते संवत्सरावयवः  

''Now entering in the form of the sun, the wheel of time, existing in the firmament between heaven and earth, the same Lord who is the soul of all living beings passes through twelve months, the twelve parts of a year, known by the names of the twelve signs of the zodiac (Mesha, Vrisha and so on). The learned declare that a month is equivalent to a couple of fortnights (one bright and the other dark, according the lunar calendar), a day and night (in the eye of the manes) and the period taken in traversing two constellations (nakshatras) and a quarter (from the point of the sun). And the fraction of a year in which He (the sun-god) covers the sixth part of his orbit is called a Ritu
(Season)." Gita Press translation

Here two and a quarter nakshatras have been clubbed into one Rashi, and as has been explained already, those Rashis are seasonal since days and nights are equal on Mesha and so on.

The Samsthans of respected Jagadugurs whether from Dakshina-Amnaaya or from Kanchi Kamakoti etc. apart from almost all the entire Hindu community are supposed to be following the Surya Siddhanta for deciding the dates of their festivals including the Vasanti and Sharadiya Navratras etc.

But ironically, the same Surya Siddhanta which they are supposed to be following has this to say in 1/48

अत ऊर्ध्वममीयुक्ता गतकालाब्दसंख्यया\| मासीकृता युतामासैर्मधुशुक्लादिभिर्गतैः \|\|

Burgess has translated it as

Quote

To this, add the number of years of the time since past...Reduce the sum to months, and add the months expired of the current year, beginning with the light half of Chaitra"

Unquote

Thus Madhu has been translated as Chaitra.

Bapu Dev Sastri's translation is no exception. He also has translated Madhu as Chaitra. (Attachment SS-BDS)

Mahavir Prasad Shrivastav, in his Hindi translation, published by Ratna Kumari Swadhyay Samsthan, Allahabad has this to say

Quote

ऊपर बतलाये गए (सृष्टि के आदि से सत्ययुग के अंत तक के) सौर वार्षोँ में सत्ययुग के उपरांत जितने वर्ष बीते हूँ उनको जोड़ लो \| योगफल इष्टकाल तक के सौर वर्षों संख्या होगी\| इसके मॉस बना लो अर्थात १२ से गुणा करदो\| मासोँ की संख्या में चैत्र शुक्ल प्रतिपदा से इष्टकाल तक जितने मॉस बीते हों उनको भी जोड़ दो\|

Unquote  

Let us now see about earlier commentators:

1\. As per the attachment SS-Kamlakar, he also has translated Madhu as Chaitra in both the shlokas i.e. 1/48 and 1/49.

2\. As per the attachment Madhu=Chaitra, Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi has also taken Madhu as Chaitra!

3\. Ranganatha is no exception. He has also taken Madhu as Cahitra.

Thus whether it is the current translators/commentators of the Surya Siddhanta or whether it is the earliest available commentaries---all of them have interpreted lunar Madhu as lunar Chaitra.

Obviously Lahiri or Ramana etc. nirayana Chaitra etc. is conspicuous by its absence from the SS.

Not so surprisingly, it is not only the Surya Siddhanta but all the other siddhantas whether the Lalla Tantra or Bhaskaracharya's Siddhanta Shiromani or Siddhanta Shekhar of Sripati the famous astrologer and so on---pl. see the attachments----all of them in one voice have taken lunar Madhu as lunar Chaitra.

So the ''almighty" Lahiri Chaitra, that is being used by the Rashtriya Panchanga or the so called Surya Siddhanta *niraayana* Chaitra being used by revered Jagadgurus etc. --- or any other *niraayana* lunar Chaitra, whatever the Ayanamsha is really *niraadhar*, since it is neither as per any siddhantas nor any shastra, much less the Vedas or the Vedanga Jyotisham.

Again, proof of pudding is in the eating. The attachment Chaitra=Madhu is from the Vishnudharmottara Purana and it speaks volumes when it clubs Madhu with Chaitra and Madhava with Vaishakha and so on.

No wonder the Saha "Calendar Reform Committee" had warned that by advising to follow a nirayana calendar, the Panchanga makers are committing the entire Hindu society to Adharma!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
