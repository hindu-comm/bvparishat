Respected Shri Nagaraj Paturiji,Jai Shri Ram!

\<**Uttara aayane (Jan 14 -July 13) or Dakshin aayane (July 14 - Jan 13)** \>

As per the Vedas, the Vedanga Jyotisha, Puranas, siddhantas and even modern astronomy, Uttarayana starts from the shortest day of the year and Dakshinayana from the longest day of the year for Northern latitudes.

These two phenomena, known as Winter Solstice and Summer Solstice, take place these days around December 21 and June 21 respectively.

Similarly, the two Vishuvas---Vasanta Sampat and Sharat Sampat, (known as Vernal Equinox and Autumn Equinox) take place around March 21 and September 21 these days respectively.

The shortest day of the year viz. the Uttarayana is also known as Makar Samkranti, the longest day of the year viz. Dakshinayana as Karkata Samkranti, the Vasanta Sampat viz. Vernal Equinox as Mesha Samkranti and Sharat Sampat viz. Autumn Equinox as Tula Samkranti as per all the Puranas, Shastras, and siddhantas without exception.

Even the Tantra-Aloka by the one and only Acharya Abhinavgupta of tenth century and his commentator Jayaratha of 12th century have linked the yogic kriyas to the same so called sayana phenomena.

Then again, Ananda-Bodha Yati, the venerated commentator of the Yoga Vasishtha Maharamayana (of about sixteenth century) also has linked Uttarayana etc. phenomena to the shortest and longest days of the year and so on.

In short, there is absolutely no so called*nirayana*phenomenon in any of the shastras. That is why I call it*niraadhar.*

And that is why I keep on repeating time and again that we are celebrating all our festivals and muhurtas on wrong days, since they have no authority from any of the shastra or even siddhantas!

Proof of pudding is in the eating. So some of the proofs are attached in original.

1\. SKUE2---a page from my Shri Krishen Universal Ephemeris for 1999 showing as to how the Vedas talk of nothing but a seasonal year.

2\. Bhagavata-1: A page from the Bhagavata Maha Purana with translation proving conclusively that Makar Samkranti is the shortest day of the year and so on.

3\. VP Rashis-1 : Pages from the Vishnu Purana with translation proving that Makar Samkranti is the shortest day of the year and Mesha Samkranti the day when day and night are equal.

4\. SS-Samkrantis. Some of the shlokas from the Surya Siddhanta with commentary by Ranganatha -- a scholar of about sixteenth century claiming that Makar Samkranti, the shortest day of the year, is the day of Uttaryana.

5&6. TA1 and TA2---pages from the world famous Tantra-Aloka of Acharya Abhinavgupta, together with the commentary by Jayaratha showing as to how the seasonal Makar etc. Samkrantis are Uttarayana and so on and as to how they are to be linked to yogic kriyas.

7\. YV Ayanas---Tatparya-Prakasha Samskrit commentary on the Yoga-Vasishtha Maharamayana by Ananda Bodha Yati of about 16th century, explaining as to how the Vishuva etc. are to be linked to seasonal Mesha etc. Rashis.

I could go on attaching several other proofs, but space limitations do not permit me to do so!

With regards andJai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
