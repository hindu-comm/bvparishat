Dear Shri Kaul ji,

  

Jai Shri Ram,

  

Have you tried talking to the Shringeri, Ahobilam and Kanchi mutts?

  

Can you please share the names of the people and mutts you have spoken to?

There are many well connected Vidvans in this forumand they will be able to put you in touch with the right people and get you a good hearing.

  

This is serious enough to be analysed thoroughly.

  

It is sad this is not getting traction.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
