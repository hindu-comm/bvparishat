Greetings,  



The \_International Journal of Hindu Studies\_ (Springer) invites submissions for a special issue on the work of Professor Arvind Sharma (McGill University) for Volume 25, Issue 1, which will be published in April 2021.



Professor Sharma has made significant contributions to Hindu Studies, and taken it in new directions. This special issue of the Journal aims to assess the breadth of Arvind Sharma's influence and the importance of his continued legacy in Hindu Studies, and beyond. We invite critical articles concerning any aspect of Arvind Sharma's published works.



We ask for abstracts to be submitted by October 30, 2019. Invitations for articles will be chosen from these abstracts by the editors and sent no later than November 15. We will need completed articles by May 15, 2020. Subject to peer review, the articles will be published in the special issue along with a response to the accepted articles by Arvind Sharma.



I hope you will give serious consideration to sending us an abstract.



Please send inquiries to me at [mitt...@jmu.edu]().



Thank you,



Sushil Mittal
