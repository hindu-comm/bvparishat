Dear Rajkumari Ji,

  

  Thank you for sharing your very interesting paper. I would like to add a few notes. As far as Marathiis concerned, the literary Marathi from Jñāneśvara \[Dnyāneśvar in Marathi pronunciation\] to modern times mainly reflects the language of the Brahmin literati, who were more directly familiar with Sanskrit, and hence there is a greater use of Tatsama Sanskrit words. The Marathi dialects seen in the Mahanubhāva literature contemporary with Jñāneśvara show the language closer to the language of home \[For example: लीळाचरित्र\]. The Marathi used in the country side is much closer to its Prakrit/Apabhraṃśa origins. The same can be seen in the Dalit Marathi literature that has been published in more recent times. Your example of शुष्क being retained in Marathi unchanged is true of literary Marathi, but look at the common Marathi verb सुकणे "to dry up" and the colloquial usage like सुकी भाजी, where you are not likely to hear शुष्क भाजी. So there is a range of high percentage of Sanskrit words in literary Marathi to relatively lower percentages in the colloquial usage. I assume this may also be true of Panjabi and other languages. With best wishes for your continued research,
