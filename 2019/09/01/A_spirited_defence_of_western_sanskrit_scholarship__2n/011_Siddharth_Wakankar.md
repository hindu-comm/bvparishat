Dear Venkat ji,

  

You are absolutely right. Such dedication despite advanced age is very rare these days.

  

We know each other for more than 30/35 years now. I met some of his Shishyas in the Ananthasayana Vishnu temple in Trivandrum in 2005,as one of them belonged to Vadodara and Karnali.

  

We are really very dwarf before them and unnecessarily boastful of our small mundane achievements.

  

Thanks and regards.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
