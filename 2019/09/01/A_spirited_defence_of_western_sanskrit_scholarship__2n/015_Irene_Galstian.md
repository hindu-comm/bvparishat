"He has a right to appreciate his teachers."

  

This is a serious point. If we have received teaching from a teacher, we're still beholden to that person, even if we don't agree with all of their views. One can never denounce one's teacher, even if one has been mistreated by that teacher or if that teacher subsequently develops views one doesn't agree with. All the more reason to consider carefully whom we approach for teachings, but so much of this is dependent on karma that deliberate care would only go so far.
