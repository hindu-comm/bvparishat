vivekAnanada took samadhi when he was meditating.

shankara disappeared at kedarnath...the recorded version of his disciples is that he disappeared.

  

Apart from this I agree that many traditional scholars have died early and that old age do not accrue to all that chant pashyema sharadasshatam jivema sharadasshatam ... since age is not the result of one life's karma alone.

  

Nor have I suggested anywhere that Hindus have a hegemony over old age and efficiency...

I have merely suggested that intellectual dishonesty shows its karmaphala in the same lifetime and usually in ways that are humiliating to the spirit.

  

There are many nonhindus who live a wholistic lifestyle and who do not lie, cheat and steal for a living. Hindu is merely a geographical nomenclature for the noble (Arya) who exhibited certain traits and characteristics. Many around the world live their life by a similar universal code irrespective of what they may believe in terms of afterlife or what they may have or lack in terms of ritual. None of the sanatani scriptures suggest that a good man (or woman) comes to naught because he (or she) believed in the wrong "God".
