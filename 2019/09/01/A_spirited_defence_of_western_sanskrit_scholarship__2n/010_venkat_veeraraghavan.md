Dear Shri Siddharth ji-

  

I met Nanaji 3 years back at his ashram in Barshi along with his sons when he was working towards a major yajna (may be an ashvamedha?) in 2017.

I consider it my purvapuNya to have been exposed to such people and remembering such people reminds me of my own deficiencies and the long path ahead of me.

He was still very much active and was patient and humble even in front of a nobody like me.

That is when I realised that the real mark of the learned is humility.

  

Namaskarams,

  

Venkat
