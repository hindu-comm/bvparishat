This spirited defence of western sanskrit scholarship by a UK-trained Lankan (whose nice sanskrit poetry and speech I might have forwarded here a few years ago) is worth reading without getting triggered by the obvious anti-hindu bias.  

  

<https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/speaking-in-gods-tongue-the-grammar-of-sanskrit-scholarship-today/>

  

I tried contacting Rohana for clarifications, but did not get a response (anyway ccing him on his email id as a matter of courtesy). Some notes (Useful info first, bias related stuff later):

  

On specialities of western scholarship:  

  

\- "While working with my supervisors, advisors, thesis examiners, and teachers who had received their doctoral training from top universities including Oxbridge, Harvard, Stanford, Chicago, Yale, Columbia, and Princeton, I observed that they were several times more meticulous and assiduous than most of the traditional scholars I met in India. ... Their intellectual labour marked by meticulosity exceeds that of many modern pundits in traditional schools of Sanskrit education, as often confirmed by Indian scholars who have had opportunities to receive academic training outside India. The students are also compelled to grasp the cream of Sanskrit grammar by scientifically following the prescribed textbooks and master a few more local languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Nepali, or Marathi, to assist their research in India. Simultaneously, debating the time-honoured facts by posing them counterarguments with ample concrete evidence is required. "  

(***Truth. Even so, to what extant this*** ***is true is something to be considered. Even so, forgetting Ganganath Jha or PV Kane, I suspect he has not witnessed the erudition (not to mention creative prowess) of - say - shatAvadhAnI gaNesh or Pushpa Dixit or Mani Dravid Shastri.* )**  

  

\- "if the westerners are more pedantically traditional – in the sense much more devoted – in their painstaking study of Sanskrit, what makes them stand out from the crowd? "

 - "Desaffronization of texts " - "tend to disregard the religious garb of such texts" (***\<-- Of course, one wonders why someone who does not really care for Hindu religion or mysticism is in the business of examining Hindu texts. What might be the motivations? Comments in the end.***)  

 - "Texts in context " - "What do we understand by contextualizing the texts? Lineal conflicts and personal attacks that developed into prolonged clashes between the gurukulas, for instance. And the scribal errors purported to be as such but purposely employed devices to alter meaning or variants resulting from the popularity of the text in vernacular traditions. Even beneath an ostentatious eulogy, we may decipher a lamentation if carefully gone against the grain by following the paronomastic hints or “slesharthas“. Some Indian pundits in early modern India, as we get to know now, produced perverted commentaries of Sanskrit texts in order to elude harsh polemics, win patronage, or take revenge on the gurukula such texts belonged to. " (\<--- **What is he talking about in each sentence here? Of course, mAdhva-Appayya rivalry is an example of the first. But the rest? *One also wonders if this "gutter inspector" role is something to be celebrated.***)  

 - Openness to acknowledge forgery: "Roque Mesquita (d. 2016), for example, wrote widely on Madhva’s Unknown Sources and defended Appaya’s views to Dvaita Vedantins’ disappointment, more importantly, by dismantling the saint-like stature of a few doyens of Sanskrit classics and revealing the intellectual forgery disregarded or viewed otherwise for over centuries. "  

 - "Scientific evidence over traditional beliefs " - Stuff like Patanjali of mahAbhAShya being different from patanjali of yogasUtra. And, ability to use IE linguistics tools to interpret veda-s : " a recent project completed in the US – with the involvement of Stephanie Jamison (b. 1948) from UCLA, a big name in the field of Western Sanskrit scholarship – was on translating the Rgveda, oldest Sanskrit text, into English, with the help of Indo-European linguistics rather than slavishly depending on Indian hermeneutics as many Indian scholars did so far. " (***\<-- I am sympathetic to this merit.***)  

 - "Sanskrit for Computational Linguistics " - "Their research in the subdomains such as knowledge extraction and knowledge structure identification from resources, text to speech conversion and vice versa, identification of mathematical elements in Sanskrit grammar, and development of tools for analysing and producing Sanskrit texts are literally revolutionizing our existing understanding of Sanskrit including the ways we teach and learn this pleasantly recondite language and associated branches of knowledge. " (**\<-- That this is a distinctive feature of western Sanskrit scholarship is a misrepresentation.**)  

  

Sanskrit in Lanka

\- "Buddhist monks from their early Samanera age, are “required” to learn Sanskrit alongside Pali ... it is Pali – not Sanskrit – that is expected to sustain the local version of Theravada Buddhism on this land."

\- "The academic contexts where Sanskrit is taught in support of the study of disciplines such as the Sinhala and Tamil languages and literature, History, Religious Studies, Archaeology, and Philosophy often confine Sanskrit scholarship to the basics. "

\- "I encounter more students, mostly Buddhist monks, for whom Sanskrit has been made compulsory by the UGC but often whining about their inability and unwillingness to continue offering Sanskrit. One of the justifications they produce is that they have sufficient knowledge of Sanskrit and the university must allow them to pursue new knowledge – new in the sense unrelated to Sanskrit. Most interestingly, I am striving to teach the rudiments of Sanskrit grammar to the holders of Rajakiya Pandita degree from the Pracina Bhasopakara Samagama. Most of those titular Rajakiya Panditas I encounter – to my chagrin – often fail to parse a simple sentence or work out basic declensions of Sanskrit nouns."

\- "Most of those who excelled in the training, unfortunately for us, found more attractive opportunities in and beyond academia abroad and, more pathetically, never looked back at the Sanskrit education in Sri Lanka, or in some cases, even at Sanskrit, after securing employment and study opportunities totally unrelated to what they had done during their undergraduate career. "  

\- " As was seen in the works of Hela Havula and its descendants, the Hela language or pure, if not uncontaminated, Sinhala, wanted scholastic Sanskrit – in the sense Paninian Sanskrit – to leave it and to retain only its Hela or tatbhava forms. Over time, Sinhala Punditocracy, however, seems to have realized that Sanskrit could not be amputated from the body of the Sinhala language because it is not a spare limb but inherent in its blood. " (**\<-- Remarkable that even sinhala-s had their "Lemurian" movements!**)

\- "On the other hand, the form of pseudo-scholastic Sinhala or the Sinhala language purported to be extravagantly garnished by Sanskrit as used by Panditammanyas or self-styled pundits, especially in the press, in Sri Lanka excels even Paninian Sanskrit in many ways. The result is a nauseating form of apabhrasta or substandard Sanskrit, and therefore apabhrasta Sinhala as well. "

\- " we had very few Sanskrit poets essentially including Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara (d. 2017), and Ven. Kekunawela Piyaratana the reception of whose poetry in Sanskrit left hopes about a living Sanskrit scholarship outside India."

\- "Interest in and activities on conversational Sanskrit are on the rise in Sri Lanka, which I am glad to note here. The University of Kelaniya commendably organizes an annual conference where conversational Sanskrit is one of the media papers can be presented. Further, at Peradeniya, I have started teaching a few courses on creative writing in Sanskrit at as a result which a few students have produced new compositions in Sanskrit in the form of poetry, drama, and short stories. "  

  

Bias related stuff:  

  

\- Rohana says: "However, the saffron terror unleashed by militant Hinduism during the last few decades under the pretext of glorifying Sanskrit and Hindu identity is not, understandably, tolerated by non-Hindu and non-conservative Hindu Indians as well as the non-Indian world community at large. Further, such terror-laden nationalism or jingoism triggered Sanskrit, the sacred language of Hindu scriptures just like Arabic of Islamic scriptures, being abhorred even by non-conservative Hindus."  

  

*This assessment reveals Rohana's anti-Hindu bias (equating Hindus to Muslims, or Hindutva to Islamism, or hindu texts to Islamic scriptures is fallacious) and lack of sympathy for the cause of the last thriving branch of Indo European paganism against the Abrahamist onslaught which eliminated Rohan's own buddhism. That might be expected, since it is the fashion or shibboleth among western scholars and their imitators; but it still is disappointing that a Lankan would toe that line even after returning home. (PS: Even as a neutral observer, he could have noted the opposition of the two sides without partially caricaturing one side; but he did not.)*  

  

*More importantly for the article, Rohana reveals his deep misunderstanding of the way in which Hindu sickulars view Sanskrit. It is not and was not abhorred so much for it's use by Hindutva politics (which itself is quite miniscule), but because they find it a waste of time - more or less, they're of the opinion that Hindu thought and its ritual language are matters of the obsolete past, and not very useful for their "progressive agenda". It is more a matter of contemptuous neglect than disgusted abhorrence.*

*- Rohana summarizes Rajiv Malhotra's criticism of Sheldon Bollocks and Bendy Doniger. That the indologists have been forced to take note of Rajiv's criticism is remarkable. Then, he also takes note of Shashi Tharoor's thought that Sanskrit should be taught for its classics rather than for its role as a "hegemonic language". He also notes Samskrita Bharati and Indian universities. However, he makes no note of criticisms of Vishva Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee. Also no note about excellent Indian exemplars of creative Sanskrit writing (kAvya-s by say - Balram Shukla or Shankar Rajaraman).

*- Even so, he does not grasp a few major causes of Hindu opposition to Western Sanskrit scholarship. This deficiency can be summarized by his statement: "The only “sin” they are committing is nothing else but taking nothing for granted, ascribing less or nothing to god, divine origin, or mysticism, and questioning the “unquestionable” (amimasya)."*  

* - Misrepresentation of the \*core\* of hindu ethos, subversion of hindu psyche-s (inevitable result of "dry scholar" vs "practictioner scholar" difference)  
*

* - The anti-hindu political activism of Indologists - their "petitions", support for anti-hindu and anti-India forces, California/ Indian Textbook campaigns etc..  
*

* - Their negation of Muslim atrocities.  
*

* - Their many attempts to silence critics within and without their own ranks.*

  

*- Further, he does not examine the source of these problems:*

* - "Wanting to appear smart/ score an academic point" types tend to miss the forest for the woods, and (many a time, unfortunately) tend to make others fall into the same pattern. In contrast, a practitioner keeps looking for the \\\*heart\\\* of the issue (in the way that affects/ affected practice and the truth).So, this petty desire to show how smart they are motivates the former, not a truly noble desire to attain a sense of Atma+abhyudaya."*

*  - "Rather they play a game similar to what Aristotle is said to have taught Alexander – eristics – something the Macedonian warrior is said to have enjoyed. In eristics you can successively take either side of an argument and argue for it being the correct one. Similarly, members of this cluster, who are particularly common in elite American academia, can take up a viewpoint and argue for it without really being interested in investigating the truth – seemingly it is an intellectual game for their high IQs. At the long end of history much of this cluster can be seen as making little lasting intellectual contribution beyond creating ferment in their times."
