Well, vivekAnanda and shankara died young, as do lots of very scholarly vaidika-s. And the great information theorist/ mathematician Claude Shannon got dementia. There are quite a few spry old men and women who follow non-hindu (indeed anti-hindu) religions. Beyond a certain level, I don't think that agility in old age is a reliable indicator of quality of karma in the present life.  
  
  

Any way, I am very curious as to what "Some Indian pundits in early modern India, as we get to know now, produced perverted commentaries of Sanskrit texts in order to elude harsh polemics, win patronage, or take revenge on the gurukula such texts belonged to. " refers to.
