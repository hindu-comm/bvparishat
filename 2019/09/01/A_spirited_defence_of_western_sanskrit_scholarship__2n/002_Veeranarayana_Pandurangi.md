thanks for bringingthis to my attention.  

these researches are based on secondary sources. nobody is ready to see the primary sources. forexample- he is quoting Roque Mesquita who is extensively by me.

it is the common problem of Western Research.

what about the western scholarship's inability to understand basic intention of Vedas (example provided few days ago What is the Vaaka) even though they are using somany IE or whaterver new findings. It is useless unless we can understand the intention. I have uploaded my review of Jamison Translation in [academia.edu](http://academia.edu).

it is the common problem of Western Research. they will go nowhere if they correct it.
