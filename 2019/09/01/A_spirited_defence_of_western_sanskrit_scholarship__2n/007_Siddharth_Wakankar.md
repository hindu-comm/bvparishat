Venkat ji,

  

Shri Nana ji Kale of Barshi used to visit us at the Oriental Institute, sometimes,with his bright young batus,well.versed in the Vedas and used to collect copies of rare Vedic MSS.from our rich collection.

  

I found him to be a very modest,down to earth and simple person and staunch believer in Vedic values.

  

Now a days,due to old age,he hardly undertakes long travels and we have not met for more than 25/30 years.His Shishyas do visit occasionally.

  

Thanks for remembering that noble and pious person.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
