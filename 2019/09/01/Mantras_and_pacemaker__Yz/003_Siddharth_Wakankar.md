Sau.Kalyani Namjoshi of Pune/ Nagpur did some work on Mantras Dr.Sarojatai Bhate may throw more light on it.

  

I faintly remember that there were some experiments carried out in Russia and other countries on the efficacy of Gayatri mantra a d some research done in Pune on the efficacy of the chanting of Vitthal.Dr.Prasad Joshi of Deccan College,Pune,was associated with some medical doctors in this research.

  

Best of luck in your search.
