Respected scholars,

   Atheists says mantras are mere words and they don't have any power. Theists claims that they are sacred and powerful.

  Why scholars especially Indians are not taking up research work on this

"How mantras are useful in pace making"?

Is there any such plz.provide information of the scholars and their work in India
