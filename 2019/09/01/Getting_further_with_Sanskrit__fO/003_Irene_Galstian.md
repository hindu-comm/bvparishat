Deva Pattanayak's view is interesting. It could potentially result in the fusion of the tradition with today's science, and that's certainly worth working towards.

  

With this in mind, I have a question. Once students receive traditional education from Gurukuls, then go to universities to receive knowledge in contemporary science, who would then assist them in the synthesis of the two streams of knowledge?

  

Thank you,

Irene
