Namaste,

To continue dwelling on previous topic (also in response to private communication) discussing artha in the language of jyotisha:

cakra-s manifest also as certain aggregates, e.g. -  
cAndra RNa, manifesting salaried individuals  
saura RNa, manifesting business enterprises  
yuga RNa, manifesting nation states

This suggests that goverments (nation states) have to limit their activites to yuga-RNa only (being the manifestation of that).

This RNa necessitates long-term sub-aggregates such as:  
strong Army, just Judiciary, long term (yuga-cycle) Research work (inclusive of creating non-entertainment art/culture)

Saura rna manifests as business enterprises creating desirable utilities for consumption. This 'desire' is usually assessed (priced) by market outcomes (but can be modelled with graha-s in Jyotisha).

Now, at a deeper level (not obvious but true), yuga is emergent of the interplay between saura and candra cakra-s; it isn't an independent cakra by itself' belonging to a separate graha.

This means that yuga-rna is best understood as a morphed image (saMvartana) of (saura+cAndra)-rna.

In plain terms: governments also need to invest (saura rna) in infrastructure, as well pay its employees (cAndra rna) in salaries, but -  
1) their saura-rna-s (in priciple) come from taxing saura-rna of enterprises.  
2) their cAndra-rna-s come (in priciple) from taxing individuals' cAndra-rna-s.

And since governmental activities can be centrally planned (as it is a single aggregate), there is full scope of it being a 'socialistic' aggregate inside. This means frugal salaries (even equal) to all government employees, implementation of certain social justice narratives, and severe punishments (of an order greater than that for private individuals, even for petty crimes), so on.  
  

Re: classification of nation states from inflation parameter alone (from last post):

1\) inflation \< 2%

Stable, 'at peace', sustainable, civilisation states  
ideally though, inflation \<= 1%  
2% means full nominal loss (10% value of money) in a 5-year yuga cycle.

2\) 2% \< inflation \<6%  
State at 'war with itself'. Money devaluation can be due to either-  
 2.1) unchecked corruption  
 2.2) large investments in the frontiers of science (not necessary for developing countries that have to frugally replicate success stories)

3\) 6% \< inflation  
State 'at war', unstable.

  

  

P.S.: 6% figure is tentative.
