Dear Kalicharan_ji

  

To start with discussions in public forum should not be random. You should have expressed your own answers to the two questions.

The basic question of origin, evolution and dissolution of the universe has been expressed in Sanskrit slokas that was passed on orally from generation to generation. Later written down in Sanskrit in the form of the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Shastras.

Since then, fundamental advances have been made for which English language has played the center stage in recent times.

Languages such as German, French, Italian, Dutch, Russian and others like Polish have been used by famous scholars in arts, science and engineering.

Today English is the language used by scientists and philosophers throughout the world.

Fortunately, some Indians know English as a second language. However, English is not the mother tongue of many Indians. There lies the problem at hand.

Today there are countries like Russia, France, Germany, China and others where their own mother tongues are used in fundamental research, although they also use English to go through the books and the journals so as to avoid losses during translation.

  

As you know the Britishers not only imposed English on Indians but banned all Indian languages in the universities. They also abolished the Gurukul system which was very successful in fundamental research and development in various fields at that time.

  

India has followed the British educational system since it's independence, but most of the universities have followed advances made elsewhere.

Indians have done excellently well after studying and becoming faculty members and industrial researchers abroad.

  

It is time India to have a fresh look at the functioning of their university system. However, I feel one has to be extremely careful in jumping into a bandwagon that has been stopped thousands of years ago. I am talking of the Gurukul system here.

  

Instead of favoring any one system, it is perhaps a good long term strategy for India to promote its own languages and revive the Gurukul system and show how the use of Sanskrit may help in solving some of the basic problems facing Physics and Astronomy today by unknoting the basic assumptions. It has happened before. From Classical to Quantum mechanics.

  

Are there completely new kinds of fields beyond the now known gravitational, electromagnetic, Strong and Weak forces ?

May be the understanding of mind ( mana, manas and consciousness, concept of atma, sukhmati sukhma objects , many universes hidden inside a tiny hair follicle etc) described in so much detail in the Vedas and Upanishads, in the light of modern neuroscience, may be very useful.

What is needed to compete and win over the modern scientific world is to publish papers in journals like nature and Science in English and show how the work is new and provides new answers.

  

I support the use of Sanskrit, all the other languages of India together with its own Indian English and a modified Gurukul system, existing in parallel with the current university system.

  

Let the goal be true progress of knowledge by using foundational concepts outlined in the Shastras and the advances made in modern science, arts and technology and not just to stay in the same groove as pointed out by Swami Vivekananda that I posted few days ago.

  

With best wishes

Deva
