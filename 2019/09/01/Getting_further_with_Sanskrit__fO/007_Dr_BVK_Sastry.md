Namaste

Some good questions to pursue:

1. On \< 1) Is Sanskrit the traditionally/naturally most fundamental avenue of fundamental researches among bhAratiya-s?\> :

***BVK Sastry***: Indian History has shown with ample evidence over five millennia that Sanskrit is the most preferred / scholars choice, traditionally/naturally as the most fundamental avenue of fundamental researches among bhAratiya-s. Samskrutham has been the language of spiritual, yogic and Material sciences.

The schoalr has all the choices to test drive their writing in Latin, Greek, and any other languages ( including Chinese, Japanese, English if desired) and see whether they whey the writing will withstand the onslaught of TIME !

2. On \< 2) Is Sanskrit as a knowledge generation stream more fundamental than maths, physics, engineering etc? \> :

***BVK Sastry***: Unless language has the ability to carry the load of the subject it has to carry, the output will fall short of reaching out its true spirit and essence.

Samskrutham has proved its merit on reaching out the ' Intention of the speaker/ scientist / mystic / mathematician/ Medicine man / Magician .. with equal proficiency over millennia.' For some disciplines Samskruth serves as a flight carrier; for some, it serves as a protective wrapper to shield the content safely; for some , it serves as a set of tools to audit and deliver quality.

There have been deliberations especially in tradition to carry on this comparison / study to identify what is fundamental:

Language or Maths-Science ?

The answer seems to rests in one word from second chapter of gita :
'Saamkhya-Yoga: where the Philosophy ( Saamkhya tattva), (Saamkhya) Yoga, Measure (samkhyaa ) are built around the primary root: 'khyaa' with multiple meanings.
