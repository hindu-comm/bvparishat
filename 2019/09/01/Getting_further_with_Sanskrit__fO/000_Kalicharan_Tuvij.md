Getting further with Sanskrit : random discussions

Namaste.

Deva-s' boons and AdhyAtmika experiences happen to the rarest of rare people (with the experiences being non-transferable in nature).  
The most significant bunch of people - however - is that of intellectuals, achievers: people who attain higher status - education, degrees, awards, power, respect, money.  
If denied proper avenues for attainments, this class has also the potential to turn into a gravest danger. These attainments then have to be designed in such manner that keeps them on the "right path" and results into increased gross productivity.  
So, the question boils down to this: what should be the avenues for intellectual achievements?

Has Sanskrit got any role to play at that (attainments and translatable productivity)?

1\) Is Sanskrit the traditionally/naturally most fundamental avenue of fundamental researches among bhAratiya-s?

2\) Is Sanskrit as a knowledge generation stream more fundamental than maths, physics, engineering etc?
