Re: further thoughts on yuga-RNa and on the value of money from my last post

  

The concept of chakra (from jyotisha) makes it so that a ऋण (measured in money) equals the purushArtha accumulated at the end of the cycle (when the wheel - chAndra or saura turns back to zero).

  

This entails that money shouldn't be artificially inflated (known as price rise) - and that the target value of inflation (within plus-minus of) should be zero, since a fixed cycle of purushartha, as a matter of 1st principle, must equal a fixed amount of money.

  

Now this looks like preferring the Austrian siddhAnta (of artha-shAstra) over the more prevalent Keynesian, but the fact is: it is a great nuisance/inefficiecy forcing everyone to continue demanding higher wages (weaker sections becoming the most vulnerable) from employers/customers just because money is also continuously artificially inflated.

  

A persistent (as opposed to headline) inflation causes masses to anyway hoard gold (or other hoards); zero inflation OTOH makes the money itself the gold - avoiding the whole nuisance/inefficiecy of gold trade/ inefficiency/ other corruption.

  

To be true to the yuga-RNa, the Central Bank should then target zero persistent inflation via monetary policy : suck money (+ive lending rates) when net purushartha (productivity) sees decline, and pump money (zero lending rate) otherwise. The Central Bank's role should then be reactive, not active.

\[Have the developing nations put sufficient original thought on the economy model to follow?\]

  

Threshold value of inflation:

Coming to real world scenario (where money spent by governments may not necessarily equal the balance purushartha-s), the upper limit of "never exceed value" of inflation should be a natural value instinctively understood by masses. This value is exactly 1%; at this rate the prices rise by 1% in 1 saura cycle, by 2% in 2 saura cycles, and so on..upto by 10% in 10 saura cycles. \[Note: though yuga extends to thousands of years, its minute variation is captured in the 5-yearly yugacycle, that is of the same order discussed here\]

  

Summary:

One can find deep insights into a language though a more expressive language.
