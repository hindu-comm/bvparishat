True.

Though I meant language not as a mode of expression, rather as a science itself. Or, language as language itself, not as a means for something else.

  

To outline, here is a simple statement:

  

"Physics is expressed in Mathematics, so Mathematics is more expressive than Physics. Mathematics is expressed in language, so language is more expressive than Mathematics."

  

So language is based on a more expressive science. Also, among all languages, it is only Sanskrit that has talked (by far the) most about - itself. So Sanskrit necessarily is one nearest to the science of language.

  

So Sanskrit itself as a knowledge stream is more expressive - or fundamental - than physics, maths, engineering, etc.

  

To answer the other question, this is how Sanskrit (or, simply, the "science of language") has been understood and persued traditionally in Bharata.
