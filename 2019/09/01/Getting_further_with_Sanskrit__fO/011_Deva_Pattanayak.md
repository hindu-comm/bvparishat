Dear Karve-ji

Namaskar, Good morning

There is no difference between human beings living in infinity of directions passing through any single point.

Sun appears to rise from the east and sets in the west both in India and in USA.

I do not subscribe that western society is materialistic or being materialistic is a sin or hindrance to happiness or spiritual enlightenment.

Instead of judging others it is better to work towards one’s own well being snd that of every one.

With best wishes

Deva
