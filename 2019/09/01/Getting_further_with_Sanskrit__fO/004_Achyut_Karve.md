Dear Vidwans,

  

It is absolutely true that Mathematics stands on the pedestal of language. All languages stand on the pedestal of Sanskrit. Sanskrit stands on the pedestal of the Maheshwar Sutras. The Maheshwar Sutras describe or define how the human brain is hardwired for any kind of human communication. The Maheshwar Sutras are but the fruits of 'Pranav'.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
