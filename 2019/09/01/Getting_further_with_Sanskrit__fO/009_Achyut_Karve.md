Dear Patanayakji,

  

The two streams cannot be synthesized as their starting points are different and so too are their goals. They are two absolutely contradictory world views.

  

In what does human well being lie? 1) In the material paraphernalia that he collects around himself or 2) In the internal peace that he enjoys in the midst of the material world. The West follows the first path the East follows the second.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
