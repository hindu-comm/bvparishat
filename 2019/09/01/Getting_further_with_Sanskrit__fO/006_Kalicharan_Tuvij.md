To discuss an example, as an intellectual exercise, of the basic hierarchy among knowledge streams: Jyotisha-shastra vs Artha-shastra.

  

Jyotisha posits that different cycles (chakra-s) affect life on Earth. The Panchanga, specifically, is based mainly on three chakra-s - mAsa (based chiefly on Chandra), Samvatsara (chiefly Surya), and Yuga (chiefly precession).

  

Each of the three chakra-s therefore incurs a specific effect on an individual, realised as certain purusha-artha:

ChAndra chakra- the monthly RNa (debt).

Saura chakra- the yearly RNa.

Yuga chakra- civilisational RNa.

  

RNa is nullified by artha (post/pre-paid) to become shunya at the end of a particular chakra (that revolves back to its shunya position).  

  

The monthly RNa is paid in what is known as salary. The yearly RNais paid in what is known as investment/ loan. The yuga RNa- a relatively obscure principle in Economics - bears itself - among other things - on the strength & stability of the currency of a civilisation/ state.

  

Jyotisha-shastra therefore is able to express Artha-shastra. Through Jyotisha the goal of Artha-shastra can be summarised in precise as:

"To maximise the net RNa(sum from all the three chakra-s) on each individual."

  

Expressing a knowledge stream through a more fundamental knowledge stream can give insights into grey/ intractable areas of the former. In the present case, for example, when we talk about economic progress of a developing nation like ours - it becomes important to understand the significance of yuga-RNa:

e.g., the dominantly alien yuga-RNa-s(e.g. media-workers carrying hinduphobic RNa, or techies carrying the "multinational/green-card" RNa, etc).

  

The net RNais a sum of three RNa-s- a RNathat is in opposition to another RNaworks towards minimising the net RNa.

  

Or questions such as:

Which, if any, yuga-RNa-sa particular saura-RNa(e.g. FDI) attaches itself with?
