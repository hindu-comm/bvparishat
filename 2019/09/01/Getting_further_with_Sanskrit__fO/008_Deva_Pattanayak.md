Dear Irene_ji

  

The synthesis of knowledge acquired by the two streams will happen gradually. However it will not be easy especially since very few areas of overlap exists.

A liberal arts education with an emphasis on the non-ritualistic aspects of the Vedic knowledge described in the four Vedas and many Upanishads will be useful in grasping and understanding contemporary science and technology and becoming good citizens.

I am not sure if it is possible to predict what would have happened if Vedic knowledge would not have stopped after the Niruktas as has been alleged. Not sure if the fancy buildings, air ships ( Vimans), weaponry ( Sudershan Chakra) and the art of entering into the body of accidentally dead person and back to one's own body ( Adi Shankararcharya)) etc are real.

Obviously education must lead to a well paid job after graduation.

Besides there is also the question of how and when to introduce Sanskrit into the schools and colleges. A major competition to Sanskrit are the languages of India which are the mother tongues and are very well developed.But here one should look at Russia, Chinese, France and Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland etc,

Personally I believe in the Gurukul system but students graduating from Gurukuls have to compete with students from the traditional universities.

Best wishes

Deva
