**Required :** Scan of

4+2 items of each book  

(esp. newly) published viz.

  

1\. Cover Page

2\. Title Page

3\. Copyright Page

*4. Contents Page(s)*

  

(+ 5. Year of publication  

 (=publication history of reprint/edition number)  

\+ 6. Total no. of pages  

\- if not made available above).

  

Providing these on a regular basis would be a great help.

  

Can BVP/Indic Academy look into this

to be done *on a large scale **and** systematically* ?

  

In fact, going by the value and importance of the task,

one or two jobs could even be created for this  

(to assist Dr. Narenthiran/work in parallel)

(and funds for this could possibly be raised  

from individuals/crowdsourcing).

  

The other, more major task of course is developing  

an Indian counterpart for Jstor,  

scanning all Indian journals pertaining to  

every branch of Indology.  

This may demand very major funding

and could only be taken up by UGC or some such body.

(Only it should not end up turning out a shoddy work as did DLI).
