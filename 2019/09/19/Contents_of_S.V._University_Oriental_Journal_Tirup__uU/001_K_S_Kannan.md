Providing the Contents Page of journals (latest issues or even old ones)

is a valuable service.  

  

I think these must be stored in a separate "sub-site" of BVP.

Young scholars, especially, will do well browsing through this portion regularly,

(something like 5 pp. per day), and thereby they can get many new ideas  

(plus even old references and discussions, whereupon to build further).

Repetitions can be avoided.

  

Jstor lists only one or two Indian journals,  

and we have no decent counterpart for Indian journals, a major desideratum.  

  

A commendable effort by Dr. Narenthiran  

(especially if it continues as a steady stream which is by no means easy).
