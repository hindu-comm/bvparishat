Namaste Shri Ramesh ji--

  

"can the pitrus bestow liberation /moksha?

When a person attains moksha totally 21 generations of pitrus also attain Moksha. This includes future 7 generations also.

if that is the case how can they bestow moksha .. they can bestow it upon themselves & attain moksha..."

The moksha over here may not represent the unqualified moksha people may think of.

To say that I have obtained moksha from a debt means I do not have to pay that debt again.

It does not mean I have become svatantra from all debts.

Pitru rNa is one of the 3 main rNas every man is born with.

Moksha may represent in this context mukti from this debt.

Only a creditor can grant mukti from a rNa to a debtor so I think this is the context here.

  

The Moksha you speak of comes from burning the kAraNa sharIra through tapasya. 21 generations of pitrus etc.

These may not be the same things being discussed.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
