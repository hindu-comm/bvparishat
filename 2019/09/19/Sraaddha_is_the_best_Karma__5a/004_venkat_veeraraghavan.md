Dear Shri Venkatesh ji

  

Well written and well said.

  

One thing to add is that trikala sandhyavandana and agnikarya (aupasana/samitadhanam) are a must for those who will perform shraadham.  
Without this basic qualification the doer loses adhikara and results are doubtful.

  

When performing nityakarma the yajnopavIta is worn upavIti on the left shoulder where the right side is dominant over the left side or shiva over shakti --> the obvious implication being that energy is accumulated..

  

In pitru kAryas and during pitrutarpana the yajnopavIta is worn prAchInAvIti or on the right shoulder where the left side is dominant over the right side or shakti over shiva --> the implication being energy is given or sent out..

  

Without a bank balance can cheques be given? Bounced cheques invite imprisonment here even if posthumously given the speed of the justice system.

  

Without shakti, what can be given? This might invite special attentions from Yama.

  

Hence nityakarmas are indispensable ... for all purusharthas.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat

  

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
