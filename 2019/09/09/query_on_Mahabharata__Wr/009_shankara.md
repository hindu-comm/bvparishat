Rao ji,

  

Among Appayya Dikshita's known and published works, there are two works related to Ramayana and Mahabharata.  
  

Ramayana Tatparya Sangraha Stotra (25 veses) and Bharata Tatparya Sangraha Stotra (20 verses) with auto-commentaries. Both the texts are included in Vol 4 of Appayya Dikshitendra Granthavali.  
  
I am sure you are familiar with Nilakantha Chaturdhara's Mantrabhagavatam and Mantraramayanam.  

  

regards  
shankara
