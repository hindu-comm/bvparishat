Dear sirs, namaskars,

I have started reading the Mahabharatam along with the commentary of Nilakantha, wherein Nilakantha quotes another source 'iti RatnagarbhaH'
frequently. Is this Ratnagarbha the name of a person or of a commentary and if so, what happened to it?

Appayya Deekshita is said to have written three booklets named Mantra Ramayanam, Mantra MahaBharatam and Mantra Bhagavatam. This was told in one of the talks by an renownedscholar Mudigonda Venkata Rama Shastry (who passed away around 30 yrs ago, but whose recorded talks are available). Can someone throw light on these books? Appayya Deekshita seems to have written that several Vedic mantras are embedded in the three texts in different places.

Regards,

Aravinda Rao K
