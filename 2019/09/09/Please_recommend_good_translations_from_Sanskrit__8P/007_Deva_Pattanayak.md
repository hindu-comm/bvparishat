Dear Irene,

Thank you for your reply.

There is a story regarding the Odia Maha Bharata that goes somewhat like this:

The mother of the bhakta kabi Jagannath Das asked her son to write the Bhagabata in Odia so that she and others do not have to depend on the interpretation of the Sanskrit text by Sanskrit priests some of whom
were arrogant and rude. One of them rebuked her that she was an ordinary "muddha"(stupid) woman when she asked for an explanation of a Sanskrit sloka.

  

That led poet Jagannath Das to write Bhagabata in Odia.

  

I am sure the experts must be aware of this work and that of Sarala Das. These texts were in print around 1500 and was popular in adjacent states like Bengal, because at that time there were no translations in Bengali of Mahabharata or Bhagabata.

  

The quality of these Odia texts are of a very high calibre.

  

Would be of general interest to know bit more about this project which appears to me to be some short of interactive interlanguage dictionary which will be of interest to some researchers. 

  

Thank You.

  

Best wishes

Deva
