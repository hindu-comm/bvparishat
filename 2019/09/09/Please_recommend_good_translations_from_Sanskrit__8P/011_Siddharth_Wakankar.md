Dear Dr. Irene,

  

Many thanks for your kind words of appreciation.

  

It will be my pleasure to help those who seek some academic help, esp.regarding books in my mother tongue.I have suggested only those books or scholars whose efforts were pioneering in that area and who were regarded as scholars in their times.

  

I shall suggest other names as and when I recollect them.

  

Thanks and warm regards.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
