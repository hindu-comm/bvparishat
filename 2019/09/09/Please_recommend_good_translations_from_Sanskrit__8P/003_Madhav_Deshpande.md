Dear Irene,

  

  Translations from Sanskrit into Marathi will be a huge number and this would be a good research project for someone to conduct. Among top of the line major translations, I would include the following:

  

Seven volume translation of the Vyākaraṇa-Mahābhāṣya by Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar

  

Translation of the Brahmasūtra-Śāṅkarabhāṣya by Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar

  

Many volumes of translations of Upaniṣads with Śāṅkarabhāṣya by Vishnushastri Bapat

  

Translation of Nāgeśabhaṭṭa's Paribhāṣenduśekhara by Shri N. D. Vadegaonkar

  

Translation of Bhaṭṭojī's Prauḍhamanoramā with Śabdaratna \[many volumes\] by N. D. Vadegaonkar

  

Translation of Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra by Kangle

  

Translation of Ānandavardhana's Dhvanyāloka by Patwardhan and Virkar

  

Translation of Mammaṭa's Kāvyaprakāśa by Mangrulkar and Arjunwadkar

  

Many translations of the Bhagavadgītā, including significant works like the Gītārahasya by B. G. Tilak

  

These are just a fraction of significant Marathi translation that come to my mind. I am specifically mentioning those translations that contain a significant amount of scholarship beyond translation. Beyond this short list, there are hundreds of Marathi translations of Sanskrit Kāvyas, dramas, works on Vedānta, stotra literature, and complete translations of works like Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, Yogavāsiṣṭha, Yogasūtras etc. There are partial translations of Śābarabhāṣya on Mīmāṃsāsūtras etc. Some are plain translations, while some have very useful introductions and notes etc. It would be a good idea for some institution like the Bhandarkar Institute in Pune to undertake a comprehensive bibliography of Marathi translations of Sanskrit works. Connected to this, is the area of commentarial works in Marathi beginning with Jñāneśvarī and including many Marathi Kāvyas on themes from Sanskrit epics, Marathi dramas based on Sanskrit dramas like Śākuntala, Mr̥cchakaṭika etc. With best wishes,
