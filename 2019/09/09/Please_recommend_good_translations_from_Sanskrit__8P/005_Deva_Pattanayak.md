Dear Irene_ji

You missed Odia which is one of the classical languages and there are many scriptures in Odia.

One example is

Srimad Bhagabata Mahapurana, by Atibadi Jagannath Das

Gita Press, Gorakhpur, India 273005

This book is very popular and read in almost allvillages in Odisha for a long time in a small room called "Bhagabata Tungi". People will gather in the evenings to listen to the Guru followed by discussions.

  

At the end of this book which is 1083 pages long, there is a list of Odia translations of many original Sanskrit texts.

  

There is also Odia Mahabharata by Sudramuni Sarala Das, Dharma Grantha Store, Alissha Bazar, Cuttack. Odisha

Sarala Mahabharata in odia is also very popular in Odisha.

  

Interestingly Odia is a highly phoneticlanguage and there are many poets of which Upendra Bhanja come to mind.

  

A link about him is

<https://or.wikipedia.org/s/380>  

  

One of his popular book " Baidehisa Bilasha" about Sita does not use the name sita but other different names of Sita and each line starts with the

letter "ba".

  

Odia is the language of Odisha which is known by many names. One of its famous name is Kalinga. The famous Konarak temple is there. Also the very well known Jagannath temple of Puri.

  

I will be interested to know if you are not aware of the Odia language. If you are ,why you did not include it in your list.

With best wishes

Deva
