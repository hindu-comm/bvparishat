Dear list,

  

For the purposes of constructing a parallel corpus of around 1M words (to begin with), I am collecting good translations from Sanskrit into Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Russian.

I define a translation as good if it faithfully captures the meaning of the original Sanskrit, including subtleties and word plays - even if the result in the target language isn't particularly smooth according to the literary norms prevalent in that language today.

  

Your help is requested in two ways:

  

1\. Please list translations and translators you'd describe as good according to the above definition.

2\. If you think that a substantial amount of worthwhile translations exists in other Indian languages, please name both the work(s) and the language(s).

  

It's desirable to have texts in various genres, so all responses are received with gratitude.

  

Thank you,

Irene
