Dear Dr.Irene,

  

Prof.Deshpande has already given a long list.I just add a little more.

  

MM.Siddheshvar Shastri Chitrao has translated the entire Rigveda in Marathi.

  

Similarly, Patwardhan and Hivargaonkar also brought out three volumes of Marathi translation of the RV.

  

We have Marathi translations of Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavat etc.completed towards the end of the 19 th cent.and early 20 th cent.

  

Marathi is a very rich language and almost entire Sanskrit literature embracing different subjects is translated therein.

  

It will be a Herculean task to collect all this material and it needs a team of scholars to carry out this very ambitious project.

  

Best of luck in your intellectual pursuits.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
