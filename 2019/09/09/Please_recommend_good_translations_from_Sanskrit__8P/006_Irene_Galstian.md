Thank you to the members who have responded with suggestions. I'll follow these up.

  

Deva ji, my omission of Odia and other languages was covered by item 2. in the original post: if members feel that more Indian languages need to be represented, could works and languages be mentioned - which is what you did, so now Odia translations need to be looked into. There is another practical constraint. Since I'm assembling translations for a parallel corpus, the quality of these translations matters very much, and I'll be soliciting the advice of Sanskrit scholars I admire and respect. Now in order to assess a translation from A to B, both A and B have to be known to the assessor, yet I don't think any of these individuals knows Odia. Hence my task is twofold: to locate an Odia-speaking Sanskritist whose opinion can be relied on and to locate translations (those kindly listed by you plus maybe additional ones, if more list members reply).

  

Irene
