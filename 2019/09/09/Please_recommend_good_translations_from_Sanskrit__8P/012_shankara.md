Irene ji,

  

I read somewhere that Sanskrit poet S. Jagannatha ji who is an esteemed member of BVP has translated several Sanskrit works in to Kannada. Hope someone from BVP will enlighten us about this.  

  

regards  
shankara

Dear Professor Wakankar,

  

Thank you for the good wishes. I appreciate your ever-present benevolence immensely.

  

The task may seem vast, unless we carefully define what is it that's needed to be able to create a working resource right now. The 20-80 principle is alive and well in all areas of human endeavour, and this corpus isn't an exception.

Are all the Marathi translations ever made from Sanskrit required? Not at this stage, and perhaps not ever. Chomsky may have occasionally misfired in other departments, but his observations on poverty of stimulus do hold.

  

To vividly explain what I'm after, imagine the following scenario. Hindi/Marathi/Kannada/Telugu/etc-speaking Sanskrit scholars to into their classrooms in the morning to meet and teach Sanskrit to their Hindi/Marathi/Kannada/Telugu/etc-speaking students. At one point these students ask, Sir/Madam, what good translations exist in Hindi/Marathi/Kannada/Telugu/etc? Hearing that question, several titles immediately float up in the teacher's memory and he/she lists them. These are the lists I'm looking for, in the languages listed in the original post.

  

Thank you for the additional texts you've suggested. With your and Prof Deshpande's combined input, Marathi is well-represented for now. The next step is to obtain recommendations of texts in the other languages. Please help if you can.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
