Dear Friends,

Actually the link I found is quite good and elaborate. I also have an odia translation of Gita by Pandit Maguni Panda, Sharada Press, Cuttack, Odisha.

I was looking for a similar work where everything including, grammar,commentaries and translations(in Hindi or Odia) are all in one place.

But the above link and the separate translations into Hindi and Odia seem to me to be adequate resources to learn Sanskrit through Gita.

Now I am doing the Sankalpa to complete the task to learn Sanskrit by listening to Gita and with the help of the grammar, the commentaries and translations (in Hindi, Odia and English} as necessary. I will pass if I can write Gita in Sanskrit as a prose within one year from now.

Best wishes

Deva
