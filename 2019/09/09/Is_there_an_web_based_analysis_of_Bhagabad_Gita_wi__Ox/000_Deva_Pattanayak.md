Dear Friends,

I like this link that analyses Bhagabad Gita using English.  
<http://www.bhagavadgita.eu/en/?page_id=4>

  

Posted an example below. It is great.

  

My goal is to learn Sanskrit listening to Gita. In that effort, I do not want to think in English as it is not my mother tongue. Will prefer Odia or Hindi instead. Is there an website that does similar analysis of Bhagabad Gita but uses Odia or Hindi?

Thanks in advance.

Best wishes Deva
