Please do consider Sadhak Sanjivani Gita by Swami Ramsukhdas from Gita Press. It is originally in Hindi but translated in most Indian languages.

  

I found it very high on both bhakti and gyaan levels (will appeal to feeling and thinking people). Ramsukhdasji himself was a living saint even in his lifestyle and behaviour. He prohibited anyone touching his feet or taking his photo, and apart from a short period didn't take shishya.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
