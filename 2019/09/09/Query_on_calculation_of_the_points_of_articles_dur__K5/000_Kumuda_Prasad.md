Respected Scholars,

NamonamaH.

I have a query about the UGC Care list of journal and UGC Approved list of journal. As per the notification of UGC in 2018, a candidate will be awarded 10 points in scrutiny while applying for the post of Asst Professor in Universities. each paper carrying 2 points and maximally 10 points and the articles must be published in UGC listed journal or a peer reviewed journal.

  

As the UGC approvedlist is replaced by UGC care list journals, many journals of the field of Sanskrit did not find a place in the list of UGC CARE.

In this context I have some doubts about the calculation of points of journals  

  

1\. Whether any point would be awarded to the articles published before the declaration of UGC Approved List of Journals ?

  

2\. Whether any article published in UGC list of journals during its existence are counted in the process of scrutiny ?

  

3\. What are the differences between REFEREED JOURNAL and PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL

  

I am to request the revered scholars to kindly guide me in the above contexts.

  

regards,

  

K P Acharya
