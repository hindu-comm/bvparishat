1\. Whether any point would be awarded to the articles published before the declaration of UGC Approved List of Journals ?

  

2\. Whether any article published in UGC list of journals during its existence are counted in the process of scrutiny ?

  

# 1 & 2 tricky issues, may need litigation to solve.

  

3\. What are the differences between REFEREED JOURNAL and PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL

  

There is no difference. They are one and the same.
