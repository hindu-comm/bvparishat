It's certainly desirable but I'm somewhat unclear as to who would do it.

  

The most popular edition of the Bālamanoramā is the 4 volume one from MLBD where you get Siddhanta Kaumudi, Balamanorama and Tattvabodhini arranged in 3 windows. The editors of this work were Mm Giridhar Sharma and Mm Parameshwaranand Sharma. They are probably quite advanced in years now. This work came out in 1961 or so (I'm quoting from memory). After that, all subsequent appearances of this book have been reprints. By 1998, there had been 8 reprints. So what you get from the store even today is quite possibly the 1961 edition.

  

I have seen at least one other work where infelicities of expression or plain errors of the Bālamanoramā have been pointed out. One of them is the modern commentary by Mm Prativādi Bhayaṅkaram Swami to Srivatsāṅkamiśra's Varadarājastavam (cf verse beginning ajñe yajñeśvara kila jane).

  

There might be other works too where Bālamanoramā's words are not accepted.

  

Hope this helps,

  
Srini
