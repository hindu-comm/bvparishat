namaste,

  

Thank you very much for the link !

  

In the book, Sri Bhimasena Shastri gives a handful of examples of errors in the balamanorama. His call to action is to have the commentary published with footnotes comprehensively pointing out the errors. Have there been any efforts towards this end in the last 50 years since this book was published?

  

viduShaam vidheyaH,
