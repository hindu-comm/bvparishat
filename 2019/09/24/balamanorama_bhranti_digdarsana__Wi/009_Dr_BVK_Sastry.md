Namaste



1. I agree on Prof. Deshpande \< Investigating why the commentators disagree with each other may itself be a profitable avenue of research in intellectual history of a given tradition. \> . Such investigation would certainly help to bring back the ' Muni-Traya Sampradaya' and ' Vedanga Vyakarana -Shikshanaa of Samskrutham' and redefine the ' Swa-Deshi- Samskruth Linguistics and Indology' referendum. The planned researches should aim to figure out the evidence to address the key issues here and build the intellectual history of languages of Bharath.



2. On \< Ajit Krishna: Clear Errors> and \< investigation of disagreements> : 



 Both studies would need a reference frame , concurring on :



 (i) Authority of tradition / text interpretation - Call it the official voice and version : For Vyakarana, the ' muni-traya -sampradaya' is taken as the reference.


Anything that violates this is ' error' in Samskrutham' ( = apaanineeya, ashishta).



 (ii) Contextualization- improvisation - innovation without compromise on fundamentals and goals : The Kaashika and Kaumudi represent common goals but using different

teaching pedagogy. Manorama -graded versions are progressive steps. Bala-Manorama is beginners steps, where teaching has to be contextualized to the

 'sukumaara-mati' of the learner !



 In Proudha-Manorama, the commentary is for display of scholarship and tightening the standards of scholarship. When Jagannatha writes

' Praudha Manoramaa- Kucha- Mardinee' it is scholars skills at display taking ' Muni-Traya' reference as authority.
