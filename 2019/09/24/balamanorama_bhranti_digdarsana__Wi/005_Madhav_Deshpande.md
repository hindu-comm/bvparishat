In my view, this is a much broader subject. All commentators occasionally disagreed with previous commentators. One notices that in Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita's Prauḍha-Manoramā and Śabda-Kaustubha. Nāgeśabhaṭṭa frequently disagrees with Kaiyaṭa, Haradatta and others. These disagreements could be labeled as bhrānti from someone's point of view, but should be looked at more as disagreements, unless one agrees with one side or the other. Investigating why the commentators disagree with each other may itself be a profitable avenue of research in intellectual history of a given tradition.
