Thank you Prof Deshpande and Sri Srini,

  

The critique of any work can fall in a spectrum that ranges from 'nitpicking', 'differences of opinion' to 'clear errors'. Based on comments from Sri Bhimasena Shastri and Sri Giridhar Shastri, as well as a partial read of the 'balamanorama bhranti dig darshana', there are a number of instances of the "clear error" category in the balamanorama. My query was made with those 'errors' in mind.

  

As you stated, an investigation of disagreements of all types would certainly be useful.

  

viduShaam vidheyaH,
