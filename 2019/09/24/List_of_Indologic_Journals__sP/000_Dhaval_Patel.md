Dear all,

I am trying to get a list of active journals / periodicals for Indology. I am having a difficult time separating active and defunct publications.

  

So far I have received these two lists.

1\. <http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/data/List_of_Indological_Journals.pdf>

and

2.<https://sanskritdocuments.org/news/SanskritNewspapersandMagazines.html>

  

My request to the fellow scholars here is to indicate / provide list of the active Indologic journals / periodicals which they / their institute has subscribed. This will help all concerned a bit.

  

If there is some publication not covered in the above two lists, kindly jot them down in this thread.
