Namaste

  

In the following shloka of the Bhagavadgita

  

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/733199114d990/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

the word शक्यः is given as without the visarga. That is alright. Is there a requirement that it should be rendered as शक्यो and the next line continuing as ऽहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन?

  

Scholars may please clarify.
