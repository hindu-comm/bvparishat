Officially, autumn arrives here tomorrow.

काशांशुका विकचपद्ममनोज्ञवक्त्रा  
सोन्मादहंसरवनूपुरनादरम्या ...

  
The autumn comes, a maiden fair  
In slenderness and grace,  
With nodding rice-stems in her hair  
And lilies in her face.  
In flowers of grasses she is clad;  
And as she moves along,  
Birds greet her with their cooing glad  
Like bracelets' tinkling song

  

\[Kālidāsa in Ṛtusaṃhāra; English translation by Arthur W. Ryder (1877-1938).\]

Radhakrishna Warrier
