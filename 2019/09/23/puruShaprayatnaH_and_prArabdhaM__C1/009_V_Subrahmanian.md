Neither destiny nor personal effort singly determines the course of human life; there is great interaction between the two. Destiny or actions of the past that have begun to fructify, human effort and divine grace together govern what happens now. Manu has compared destiny and personal effort to the two wheels of a chariot; a chariot cannot move on a single wheel.
