Namaste,

  

I need the reference of the shloka which seems to be referred inयोगवासिष्ठः that says something

similar to this:

  

"*when two rams namelyपुरुषप्रयत्नः and प्रारब्धं fight each other with horns, it is the 1st ram in the form of पुरुषप्रयत्नः wins the fight and thus it is confirmed that*

*one can change one's destiny"*

  

I would be highly obliged if scholars can point to the reference.

  

rgs,

sriram
