Dear Sri Sridhar Reddy, namaste,

  

The second part of your sentence, that we are part of divine consciousness is fine. Regarding the first part, we have to see that we do have a tentative/individuated consciousness, called jiva. (The word 'individuated' is used by Swami Venkatesananda who translated the Yoga Vasistam. I found it to be a more acceptable expression than 'individual consciousness' which can imply that consciousness has divisions in it. The word 'individuated' suggests that though consciousness has no divisions in it, it appears to be so. It appears to be a good translation for अन्तःकरणावच्छिन्नं चैतन्यं जीवः). This individuated consciousness, with the help of BMI, does so many actions, good and bad for others. In order to bring in the principle of justice (which we can see in any court all over the world), the idea of karma phalam is accepted. We call this fate.

  

There is a fine balance between fate and free will in our texts, as explained in the Sringeri peetham reference quoted.

If it were not so, the scriptures would be rendered redundant. On the other hand, if fate is not accepted, we have to accuse God for his whimsical creation - creating someone rich and someone poor. someone handsome and someone lame and so on. We have to blame God for all the disparity in creation. We cannot simply say that God is all powerful. In the Vedantic system God is only a karma-phala daataa. We are the makers of our own fate. The Gita and commentaries clarify it adequately.
