I think the name of the parva 'Udyoga Parva ' itself is an emphasis on ' Udyoga ' human effort.

  

The context and the content inside the parva makes 'udyoga' here mean simultaneous effort towards war and preventing war.

  

In Bhagavadyana Parva , Yudhishthira eaxplains at length , the ethical and strategic merits of the efforts to prevent the war. In that parva , the fate and free will discussion is centered around the possibility of success of the efforts to prevent the war only.

  

But the whole parva covers hectic efforts towards war on both Pandava and Kaurava sides.

  

So the name of the parva itself must be a reference to simultaneous effort towards war and preventing war.
