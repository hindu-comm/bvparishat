Never easy to take sides - as to which looks more plausible/which proves more helpful  

between the two statements:

\(a\) Accidents do happen in Nature.

\(b\) Accidents never happen in Nature.

  

Some situations persuade you to accept (a).

Some situations dissuade you from rejecting (b).

The former stems mostly from experience.

The latter issues mainly from theoretical analysis.  

  

What cannot be accounted for,

or rather, what we have no control over,  

is *daivam*.

  

Only *jAtismara*-s like JaigIs"avya can figure out the truth of things.
