In [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/T_Xc0C3M3ns/7ubDG11MCgAJ) on BVP, Prof. Kannan mentioned " Udyogam Purusha Lakshanam " as one of the popular epigrams that are grammatically wrong.

  

Among Telugu speakers, this epigram is interpreted as to do jobs , to be employed and earn is the quality of males (but not of females ) etc. either while reminding the responsibility of a male adult or while dissuading a female member from taking up employment.

  

But in fact both the words in the epigram have a different meaning in Sanskrit than the meaning in Telugu. In Telugu Udyogam is the word for employment and job. But this use of the word in Telugu is a neologism. In Hindi, for example, the word acquired the meaning of industry. ( udyog niti = industrial policy, udyog mantralay = ministry of industries etc. ) But the original meaning of udyoga in Sanskrit is effort.

  

Purusha , as is well known , is gender-neutral word like 'person'.

  

So the epigram " Udyogam Purusha Lakshanam " seems to have originally been intended to communicate the idea " to make effort is the human nature/quality/responsibility"

  

Tikkana, the 13th century classical Telugu poet who translated /transcreated Mahabharata into Telugu , in his translation of the bhagavadyaana Parva of Udyoga Parva , almost paraphrases this statement when he makes Arjuna say,

  

"ప్రయత్నసంభావన సేత పౌరుషము పద్ధతి "

  

prayatnasaṁbhāvana sēta pauruṣamu paddhati  

  

నీ వొనరింపఁ బూనిన పనిం గమలోదర! కీడు వుట్టునే?  
కా వనినట్ల యుండి యవుఁ గార్యము; లట్లగుటం ***బ్రయత్న సం  
భావనసేఁత పౌరుషము పద్ధతి ***తత్ఫలసిద్ధి వొందుచో  
***దైవము*** దోడ్పడన్‌ వలయుఁ; ***దథ్యము రెండును నీ వినోదముల్‌.***  

  

nī vonariṁpa̐ būnina paniṁ gamalōdara! kīḍu vuṭṭunē?  
kā vaninaṭla yuṁḍi yavu̐ gāryamu; laṭlaguṭaṁ ***brayatna saṁ  
bhāvanasē̐ta pauruṣamu paddhati*** tatphalasiddhi voṁducō  
***daivamu*** dōḍpaḍan‌ valayu̐; ***dathyamu reṁḍunu nī vinōdamul‌.***  

  

Tikkana makes the conversation between Arjuna and Sri Krishna in this episode to be centered around the mutual relationship between and relative significance of Daivam and Purushakāram.

  

in the above quoted verse, Arjuna while saying, " both are your sports/pastimes/playful activities "

  

says to get engaged in human effort is the way of /for the humans though it can not be denied that the support of destiny/fate is required the fruition of those efforts.
