Dear Vidwans,

  

While dealing with such subjects we need to define the level at which we are trying to understand the subject.

  

Is it at the level of the individual or at the generallevel?

  

Freewill and determinism are bound through actions of individuals at the particular level and of social groups at a general level.

  

There is no universality or one to one correspondence in the relation between free will and determinism because the fruit of any action is not solely in the hands of the doer. It is also affected/determined by place, time instrument and yoga.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
