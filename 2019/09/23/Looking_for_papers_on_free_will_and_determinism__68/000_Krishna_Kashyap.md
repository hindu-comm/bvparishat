Namaste,

  

Obviously this subject (Free will and determinism) is a well known subject. While I was teaching Gita chapter 3.27, I came across this subject and some people expressed interest in digging deeper regarding this subject. My teacher Sri KSV had explained in his book on Tattva MuktA kalApa, this subject in reasonably great detail, in about 7 pages (8 inch by 11 inch) in sanskrit. Here the focus was to extract views from prasThAna Traya mainly regardingthis subject.

I did some assessment of scientific views, whichtended to indicate in general that it makes more sense to say "there is really no free will and free will is an illusion", kind of theory.

  

It will be nice to see if anyone has a paper on this subject from obviously hindu vedantic perspective.

  

Obviously, different systems of thought have different opinions on this subject, since they differ in their views on kartrva, jnAtrtva, bhOktrtva of an individual or even on the status of an individual for that matter.

  

thanks.
