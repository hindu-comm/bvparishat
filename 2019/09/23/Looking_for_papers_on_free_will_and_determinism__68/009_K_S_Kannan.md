It is as though there is only *purus"a-prayatna,*

nothing called *daiva* else than this! : for the simple reason that  

our own *prAcIna-karma* at its stage of fruition is called *daiva*.

  

If I remember aright, याज्ञवल्क्य-स्मृति has some key passages in this connection.

  

We also have passages like*  
*

*- प्राक्कर्म प्रविलाप्यताम्  
*

*- प्रारब्धं परिभुज्य कर्म-शकलम्  
*

*- दैवं निहत्य कुरु पौरुषम् आत्म-शक्त्या  
*
