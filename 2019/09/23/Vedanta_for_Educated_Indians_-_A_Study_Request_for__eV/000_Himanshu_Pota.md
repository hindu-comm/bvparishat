Dear Learned Members of the Group,

  

I am conducting a study on how do educated Indians understand and use Vedanta for their sadhana. I am an engineer by profession so this survey is not as polished as it could be but this is a start and I will learn. I wish to publish this research as a short paper.  

  

I would be most obliged for your guidance and response. I am happy to collaborate with scholars who can help and contribute to this study.

  

Please forward this e-mail to scholars who can help by responding.

  

The survey can be done online at -<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXkdSIZ9CVaEQnocMXkhcDAHiEHz1Ph-KT6l5HkaPML1sJDQ/viewform?usp=sf_link>.

  

Thanks.

  

**Brief Background**

Swami Vivekananda said that Vedanta will be the religion of the future due to its appeal to reason and logic. Many educated Indians have been inspired by Swami Vivekananda or other great souls who manifested themselves in the last two hundred years or so.

We are conducting a study is to understand how Vedanta (in all its variations) is conceived and practised today. The aim through this study is to add to the intellectual conception of Vedanta among educated Indians in a way that will make Vedanta a stronger aid to sadhana.

The study will be based on this survey in which you are kindly requested to participate. You can reply in either English, Hindi, Gujarati or Sanskrit. If you donâ€™t have time to write your responses, please feel free to record them and send it over to me. You can either e-mail the response to[himans...@gmail.com]()or WhatsApp to [+61 426057354](tel:+61%20426%20057%20354).

Many thanks for your time.
