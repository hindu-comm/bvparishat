Dear Professors Kannan Ji & Veeranararyanan Ji

Thank you very much for your endorsements for my contribution. I am willing to contribute my labour towards your future plan with lots of warmth on a sound platform and strong group.

Also i would like to thank Prof. Wakankar, Dr. V. Subrahmanian and others.  

On demand i have sent many PDF for scholars based on my old and current contents of postings. Here i am apologies for my late response, delayed because of my other routine work in my library; but i will not fail.

Thanks
