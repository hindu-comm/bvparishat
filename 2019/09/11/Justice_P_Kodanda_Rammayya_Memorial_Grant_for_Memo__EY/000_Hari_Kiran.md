Dear All,

  

I am most happy to announce Justice P Kodanda Rammayya Memorial Grant for Memorial lectures & projects

  

<http://www.indictoday.com/grants/justice-p-kodanda-ramayya-memorial-grant/>

  

We have since expanded the scope to include any form of perpetuating the memory of venerable scholars.

  

This could be republishing their works, making a coffee table book about their life, or donating a library shelf in the school he or she studied, holding a concert etc.

  

In other words ANY form of recognising their contribution. to our Dharma

  

The earlier condition of memorial lectures was restrictive as it involved organising a meeting etc. With this restriction removed and flexibility offered we are sanguine that ALL scholars, activist, authors artists who have contributed to our Dharma since 1947 and who are no longer with us MUST and WILL be recognised.

  

Thanks once again to the extraordinary generosity of the family. Deeply grateful to them.

  

This forum is a huge repository of scholars with authentic knowledge that was passed on from generation to generation. I am looking to all of you to spare some time and explore ways and means of recognising your Gurus and parents.

  

Please write to me or Dr Nagaraj or at [nam...@indica.org.in]()

  

Hari
