I see a problem in framing of the question. Your intent, I guess is "what signifies akhyaatatva?". From the text of Arthasangraha, a part, an aMSa, of तिङ् signifies aakhyaatatva. The answer to your question "what is aakhyaata?" is "aakhyaata is a verb, a kriyApadam". Please note the difference between aakhyaata and aakhyaatatva: the former is a verb and latter is verb-ness.

The aakhyaata, i.e. the verb, yajeta indeed signifies singularity (of the animal in the sentence पशुना यजेत). Why is there a problem in that? In the above sentence, the verb 'signifying' is used incorrectly. Akhyaata never signifies ta-pratyaya; rather, a part of ta-pratyaya signifies aakhyaatatva. It is the difference between vaacya and vaacaka.

Why should we consider entire तिङ् as aakhyaata, when Saastrakaara is clearly saying that only an aMSa of तिङ् denotes aakhyaatatva? (please keep the difference between aakhyaata and aakhyaatatva in mind).

What is 'it' here? I have to assume three cases and in all three cases, the objection is not tenable. a) If 'it' be aakhyaata, it can indeed denote sankhya. It does in the world all the time. Consider: गच्छाति and गच्छतः. I hope you can see the difference in the number of agents in the two sentences (these are one-word sentences). Anyway, aakhyaata cannot be a part of pratyaya; it is the other way round - pratyaya is a part of the word (= verb = aakhyaata) yajeta. b) If 'it' be aakhyaatatva, it indeed cannot be a signifier of sankhya, but nobody claims that aakhyaatatva is a signifier of sankhya. c) if 'it' be the pratyaya, why can it not signify sankhya? Actually it does!

I do not have access to this and cannot comment on it without looking at the text

As explained aakhyaata is a verb. If your question is about what signifies aakhyaatatva, an aMSa of तिङ् signifies aakhyaatatva.

  

One suggestion: one needs to be slow, careful and deliberate while studying Sastra. Treating aakhyaata and aakhyaatatva as one is what is leading to the confusion as is forgetting that only an aMSa of the pratyaya is said to denote aakhyaatatva.
