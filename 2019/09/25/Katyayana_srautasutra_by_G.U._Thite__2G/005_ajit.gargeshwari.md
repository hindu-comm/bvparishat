Irene, Could you please elaborate" This question has come up about a few years ago on Indology (?), as there were missing verses in another edition or some such thing". Are you referring to Ranade, H. G. "A Propos Of "The Relationship Of The Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra With The Kāṇva Tradition". Indo-Iranian Journal 23, no. 2 (1981): 97-103.
