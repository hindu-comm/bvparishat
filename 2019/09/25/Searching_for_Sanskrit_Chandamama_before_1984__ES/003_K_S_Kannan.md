Yes, I remember the occasion when the first issue was released. I was present there.  

It was at the Glass House in Lal Bagh, Bangalore (it was not yet BengalUru then).

  

Incidentally, my own book called *kRdanta-rUpa-kos'a* was also released right there.

ChaMu Krishna Shastri was in his highest spirits on the occasion.

  

(That was my second book (after my *dhAtu-rUpa-kos'a*)).
