That is exactly why I’m asking these questions, Professor Kannan: so that we can gather the stories. If I understand you correctly, these would be state-compiled and state-published textbooks for schools in that state. When did the practice of creating such schoolbooks begin? Were some states more active than others? How can I find out about this?

By the way, I’ve been told by people who are now in their late 70s-early 80s that schoolbooks of their time were more intelligently written. Already people of my parents’ generation onwards report some dumbing down of textbooks in order to cater to education as mass production.

  

Thank you,

Irene
