\<\< Thanks, Irene. I wonder how I missed it. Best wishes,>\>

  

Chandamama (Marathi) started in April 1952.

But here scanned copies are available from 1960 only. Moreover, the scan is of poor quality.

In Hindi, although scans are much better (each page separately), but each issue occupies large space (300 MB to 500 MB).

The Marathi version of January 1960 is 58 MB.

Narayan Prasad
