The only sources for stories in Sanskrit for children those days  

\- when publication of children's books was scarce even in the various State languages  

(primarily owing to scarcity of finance and enterprise) -  

could be the selections in school books - high schools predominantly.

Primers and chrestomathies too performed some role.

  

If we can gather school Sanskrit texts of those days,

we could get a good chunk.
