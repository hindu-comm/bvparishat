Namaste,

  

Considering the possibility that many may have old sanskrit text books with them, but find it difficult to scan and upload them, I offer to do that if they could send me the hard copies in their possession. I will get them digitised and make them available on the Internet. The address to send the hard copies is:

> 
> > 
> > Sriranga Digital Software Technologies Private Limited >
> 
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > No.132/A.2 & 3/A.2, >
> 
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > ‘Bharathi Bhavana’, SriAbhinavaShankaralaya, >
> 
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > Fort Mohalla, Mysore - 570 004 >
> 
> > 
> > 
> > 
> > Karnataka

regards............yoga
