\<\< अन्यासु भाषासु वेतालकथानां प्रकाशनं कदा आरब्धं स्यात् इति न जाने । संस्कृतावृत्तौ तु प्रथमसञ्चिकातः अपि तादृशी कथा आसीत् एव ।>\>

  

Sir, I made a trial to know exactly when the वेतालकथा in Chandamama started.

In Hindi, it was started from Oct. 1955, whereas in English it was from Nov. 1955.

In Telugu it was expected to appear first. Although I have not verified by directly downloading, it must have been Sept. 1955.

The Sanskrit version does not include the initial introductory story, but Hindi and English versions do.

Regards.

Narayan Prasad
