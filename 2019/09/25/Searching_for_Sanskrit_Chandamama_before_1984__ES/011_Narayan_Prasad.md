\<\<It may be a good idea to collect and publish as a separate volume all single-page stories that appeared in Chandamama (Sanskrit).>\>

  

To me the most interesting would be theवैतालकथा.

  

In my student days I liked theबैताल पचीसी \[वेताल पञ्चविंशति (Vetala Panchavimshati) in Sanskrit\]. The last story is the most interesting one.

In Chandamama (be it in any language), it is a never-ending process.
