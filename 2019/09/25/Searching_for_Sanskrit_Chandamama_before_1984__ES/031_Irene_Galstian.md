"But in April 1984 issue, it is included in Hindi as well as Sanskrit. But the two stories are different."

That's the main reason I'm not too bothered about non-Sanskrit Chandamamas. If the stories were the same, that would make Chandamama a prime candidate for inclusion into the parallel corpus. So the suggestion voiced by Vishal to translate non-Sanskrit Chandamamas into Sanskrit could also be turned on its head if we request that people translate their favourite Sanskrit Chandamama stories into their mother tongues and let the list know about it. After being reviewed by the list experts, such translations and their originals could then go into the corpus.
