Could anybody recall prominent sources of children’s stories in Sanskrit before Chandamama came along? If you were already on Earth at that time, you are requested to think deeply and try to recall places that put out Sanskrit stories for middle schoolers, approximately speaking.

  

Thank you,

Irene
