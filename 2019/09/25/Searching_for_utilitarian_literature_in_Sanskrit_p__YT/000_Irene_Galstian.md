Examples of categories:

  

routine reportage (e.g. as seen in newspapers, magazines with advertisements)

cookbooks

instruction manuals

repair manuals

  

Preliminary survey suggests that Indians with some knowledge of Sanskrit would be more willing to produce Sanskrit blogs/vlogs/Wikipedia pages if they had exposure to previous writings on the topics they are interested in. A substantial number are intimidated by not being sure how to speak in Sanskrit on topics pertaining to present day life. I don't know if such publications ever existed, but maybe someone from the list has seen them and can advise.

  

Thank you,

Irene
