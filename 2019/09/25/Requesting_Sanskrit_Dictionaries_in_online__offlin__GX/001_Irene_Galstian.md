For mobile and other applications, have you tried the Google list called Sanskrit-programmers? Vishvas and others there would have useful things to suggest.

Your question is rather broad. For example, do you already have some Sanskrit dictionaries? Are you looking for Sanskrit-Hindi/Kannada/English/German/etc dictionaries? Or Sanskrit-Sanskrit ones?

Please tell more about your requirements.
