Dear Vidwans,

  

From where did Sanskrit get its phonetic components?

  

Is there any example of a language that is born out of two or more languages and has attained a status higher than the languages out of which it was born both phonetically and syntactically?

  

What might be the process through which it might have to go?

  

Why are Sanskrit suffixes considered to be without parallel?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
