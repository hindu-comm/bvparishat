सादरं वन्दनानि

  

I only recently became privy to the existence of theories that state that people outside the Indian subcontinent came into the subcontinent and they brought in with them Hinduism somewhere around 4000 BCE.

  

I am wondering what all do we have to give up if we accept such theories?

 - Mahabharata, Bhagavata, Ramayana have to be accepted as fiction as they mention events on dates that are much older than these, and happening in places in India.  

 - Vedas have to be accepted as created by someone (nomadic people who came into India) as opposed to being anadi-nitya and apourusheya

 - Having accepted shrutis and smrutis as works of fiction, and/or as moral/social guidelines, the phala they mention (both aihika and paratrika) of kriyas such as bramha jignaasa, nama sankeertana, devata namana, teertha yatra, etc, have to be treated as false and non-existent or at most some kind of morale boosters.

 - In the absence of phala, there is no need to do any of such kriyas

  

If so, I am surprised that any practicing Hindu could accept them.
