I agree with Vishvas there. Most scientists of today are materialists, at best they can form guesses based on stones, bones and such.  

They aren't in a position to pronounce on the truth of any scripture. In that sense Hindus don't lose or gain anything of significance because someone talks of invasions and migrations, and someone else says they didn't happen.  

What's problematic is that some who advocate migrations have an additional agenda to diminish India's role in human consciousness. But scholars like Vishal Agarwal are generally successful at calmly but firmly correcting such insinuations.  

It's a truism that nothing can be taken away if it's not given away, so if India doesn't give away her power and keeps on her chosen path, all this migration stuff is irrelevant. Why even debate with opponents, if the time spent on debate can be spent on constructive improvements for India?
