Sir, you don't understand the sacred myths as the wise ought to understand them. For example, shatapathabrAhmaNa says:

अथ यो ऽयम् अवाङ्प्राणः। तेनासुरानसृजत। त इमाम् एव पृथिवीम् अभिपद्यासृज्यन्त। तस्मै ससृजानाय तम इवास। - ११.१.६.\[८\]

सो ऽवेत् - “पाप्मानं वा असृक्षि, यस्मै मे ससृजानाय तम इवाभूद्” इति।  
तांस् तत एव पाप्मना ऽविध्यत्। ते तत एव पराभवंस्, तस्मादाहुर् -  
“**नैतदस्ति यद्दैवासुरं**(युद्धं)  
यद् इदम् अन्वाख्याने त्वद्(=एकं)उद्यत, इतिहासे त्वत्(=एकं)।  
(कुतश्चेत् -)ततो(पूर्वम्)ह्येव तान् प्रजापतिः पाप्मनाविध्यत्। ते तत एव पराभवन्नि”ति। - ११.१.६.\[९\]

तस्मादेतदृषिणाभ्यनूक्तम् -  
न त्वं युयुत्से कतमच्च(=किमपि)नाहर्(=न हतवान्),  
न्न ते ऽमित्रो मघवन् कश्चनास्ति।  
मायेत् सा ते यानि युद्धान्याहुर्  
नाद्य शत्रून्ननु पुरा युयुत्से॥  
इति - ११.१.६.\[१०\]



Perhaps you should consider reading the works of the ancient Roman AchArya Sallustius (who defended his natural religion against Christian criticisms) as a simple guide:  

  

\- " Myths are divine, are "like the Gods", but are obviously not to be taken literally. They contain both commonly understandable declarations about the Gods and mysteries only understood by the wise. It's paradoxes and uncouth elements mean also to alert us that their words are veils."  
- "Myths have been used by inspired poets, by the best of philosophers, by those who established the mysteries, and by the Gods themselves in oracles."  
- "(They) make the Gods well disposed to those who speak of them."  
- "Now the myths represent the Gods themselves and the goodness of the Gods"  
- "(Myths are) subject always to the distinction of the speakable and the unspeakable, the revealed and the unrevealed, that which is clear and that which is hidden: since, just as the Gods have made the goods of sense common to all, but those of intellect only to the wise, so the myths state the existence of Gods to all, but who and what they are only to those who can understand. ... Besides, to wish to teach the whole truth about the Gods to all produces contempt in the foolish, because they cannot understand, and lack of zeal in the good, whereas to conceal the truth by myths prevents the contempt of the foolish, and compels the good to practice philosophy."  
- "They also represent the activities of the Gods. ... Those who make the world are Zeus, Poseidon, and Hephaistos; those who animate it are Demeter, Hera, and Artemis; those who harmonize it are Apollo, Aphrodite, and Hermes; those who watch over it are Hestia, Athena, and Ares. One can see secret suggestions of this in their images. Apollo tunes a lyre; Athena is armed; Aphrodite is naked (because harmony creates beauty, and beauty in things seen is not covered)."  
- "But why have they put in the myths stories of adultery, robbery, father-binding, and all the other absurdity? Is not that perhaps a thing worthy of admiration, done so that by means of the visible absurdity the soul may immediately feel that the words are veils and believe the truth to be a mystery?"  
- "Of myths some are theological, some physical, some psychic, and again some material, and some mixed from these last two."
