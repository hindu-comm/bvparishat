Upon a short search I found this reference, in the Brihannaaradiya Puranam:

  

The topic is about the observance of Ekadashi. The terms 'vaishnava' as distinct from 'smaarta' is used here to denote the difference in their observance of the Ekadashi vrata, so I think: Scholars may give their thoughts on this.

  

Here is an observation in the Wiki page of this Purana:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naradiya_Purana>

  

// Rajendra Hazra, in contrast, states that the core verses of the texts were likely first composed over various centuries, as follows: he dates the Vishnu bhakti focussed text Brihannarada Purana to the 9th-century; he places the first 41 chapters of*Purvabhaga*and the first 37 chapters of*Uttarabhaga*to have been composed before the 11th century; and, the rest he states is of likely a comparatively later origin.^([\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naradiya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTERocher1986203-5)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naradiya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDalal2014272-1)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naradiya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHazra19404-13,_127-133-13))The*Naradiya Purana*, states Hazra, was likely composed after the*Brihannarada Purana*.^([\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naradiya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHazra1940127-14))It is unknown, adds Hazra, whether the extant manuscripts of the Narada Puranas are same as the 9th and 10th-century originals,^([\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naradiya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHazra1940130-15))but we know that the verses quoted in medieval Hindu Smriti texts with these texts cited as source, are missing from the currently surviving manuscripts.^([\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naradiya_Purana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHazra1940133-16))//

Those who come across the term 'smaarta' either in sigular or plural, denoting a set of persons/adherents, in ancient texts, may please give the references.
