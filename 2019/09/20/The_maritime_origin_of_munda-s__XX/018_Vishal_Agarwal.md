Namaskar Ji,

  

I agree that we have to overcome our parochial attitudes and that includes casteism. My intention was simply to point out that the episode of Ekalavya is misused to further modern political discourse but that is not how our tradition presents it. It is also not the best practice to evaluate the past using current standards (the historiographical flaw of 'Presentism').

  

On another note, the entity 'infinity - infinity' is 'UNDEFINED' in Mathematics. A practical implication of this is that the question, "Even if Jivas are infinite in number, given that the time is infinite, and some Jivas attain Moksha in every Kalpa, why do we still have Jivas that are still in Bandha" cannot have any answer.

  

Some other undefined expressions are 0/0, infinity/infinity and so on.

  

Regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
