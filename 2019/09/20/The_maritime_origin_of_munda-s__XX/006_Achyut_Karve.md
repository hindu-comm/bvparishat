Dear Vidwans,

  

One can give a very simple example to bring to light the fallacies that are being pursued.

  

Take the example of a taproot system. One can easily tell which root came out first from the seed and there after tell how each of the roots are related to the first root. However in the case of the fibrous root system it is not possible to determine the first root that came out of the seed.

  

Is the spread of languages an example of the taproot system or the fibrous root system?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
