Not necessarily true. The profile of changes in a particular candidate gene across population samples from different geographical areas can be interpreted to suggest the direction of that population over the period of time. There are specific changes in genes happen in one way and that is used as one of the measures of the direction of migration as those changes could have happened later than earlier. When talking about genetics with respect to population movements, it is critical to consider time as an important factor and not as an necessary factor in addition to other proofs.

I think you mean astronomical and not astrological. Ignoring hard genetics with statistically significant data and going by soft discoveries only like from archeology or astronomy from the texts alone have led to a lot of faulty 'models' in the past 200 years. For example, initial 'archeological signatures' from a few sites near Indus river were used to 'validate' a theory on how indian sub-continent got populated. This was done by a group of western intellectuals who were keen to promote, at that time and generation, the supremacy ancient Greeks' thought and their and primacy in the origin of civilization.
Similar misinterpretations of 'archeological signatures' to somebody's convenience have been prevalent in Western Asian history too.

  

\> Also important to mention here that Lord Jagannath was their God and now worshipped as Vishnu(Krishna). He is dark in color,however his hands are covered with thick sandle paste.  

  

ALL of Vishnu's vigrahas in older Tamil nadu temples are black in color. He is adored as someone with dark skin in Alwar poems in Tamil dating around 1-3rd century CE onwards. One person's experience and one group of pandas' ignorance/reluctance do not constitute as historical fact. I am sure there woudl be dozens in this list who could provide anecdotal proofs like this with contrarian viewpoint.  

  

\> Clearly different people white, black, yellow, red lived in India. It does not matter how and when but they lived together and produced the present brown race.  

  

There seems to be some confusion about how an artist mixes his or her paints on a palette with how genes coding for skin colors. The author seems to believe both these processes are the same; they are not. Brown skinned people are there in many places in south and south east asia
and some parts of western africa with out fitting the condition quoted above. A recent president of US had a pure white mother and a pure black father. He is still black in color and not brown or a shade of grey! A current US presidential aspirant is also of half-black, half-Indian parentage; there is no such gradient of skin colors. Skin color genetics is deep rooted science with no room for nihilist fantasies.  

  

\> However the western society appreciates people more on what they know and do not hesitate to set aside prejudices and bow down to talent. Many advances in the west now a days are due to people from the east.  

  

That is so in a place called Utopian West not the contemporary 'West'... Again, excepts are not to be used for generalization.  

  

\> Some in Odisha will prefer a white skin purohit over a dark one.  

  

again, why 'some people's ideas' are more valuable than the others who may not prefer so in Odisha or outside of it? Half the smarta Iyers in Tamilnadu are darker skinned; many shaiva agama priests in Tamil nadu temples are darker skinned; many priests in Andhra are darker skinned... they all (those who practice) earn their living as priests irrespective of that. Why thoughts and prejudices and ignorance of "some" is considered more valuable only when generalizing them to be the 'norm' of the rest of the society? Why to choose selectively only 'some' people's personal opinions and hold it as 'general' statement of fact?
It would have helped if the author had presented what 'some others' in Odisha prefer...  

  

\> Buddha clearly opposed supremacy of people based on the caste system  

  

Again, that is an interpretation of convenience and intellectual coercion of history documented in Buddha's own words.  

  

\> Let Buddhist thoughts flourish in Indian society along with the Vedic thoughts so well preserved by Sanskrit and yes by the Brahmins!  

  

Parallel even if contradicting thoughts allowed to flourish in the lands of Bharat historically is the only reason many Buddhisht works have survived. Also, not just hte vedic thoughts, Buddhist and Jina thoughts were also flourishing using Sanskrit as a language. Otherwise one would be reading only their ancient chinese, tibetan, pali or sinhalese versions of the texts. The problem comes when vedic thought and sanskrit get associated with one section, but as history proves they have percolated into all sections of the followers of hinduism in the past 2-3 millenia.
