Tribals are by definition the original inhabitants or ancient dwellers of any country.

VA: How so? Are you confusing it with the term aboriginal? As an example, Angami (Nagas) are recent arrivals and they are tribals compared to the Meities.

  

In this day and age the thumbs of Ekalavyas will not be cut off to protect the interests of the upper castes.

VA: According to the Harivamsha Purana, Ekalavya was a cousin of Krishna (son of a brother of Vasudeva) who was given in adoption to the Nishaad King. Therefore injecting caste into this story as is done in modern times is contrary to what the scriptures actually state regarding his biological parentage. Drona refused to teach Ekalavya because he had promised Bheeshma that the Kauravas and Pandavas will be the best warriors. Harivamsha also states that Ekalavya created bandit bands and hid in islands off the cost of Saurashtra, from where they would launch pirate attacks on Dwaraka. In a battle with Balarama, he got killed, before the Mahabharata war even happened.
