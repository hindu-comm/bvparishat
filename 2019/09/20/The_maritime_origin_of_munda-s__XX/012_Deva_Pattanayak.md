Knowledge is neither limited nor the property when it is expressed publicly.

The Vedic knowledge even does not assign authorship to all slokas.

It is also not for the pleasure nor approval of anyone.

There are more studies in the west in recent times than in the east(India).

Sanskrit although is very well structured and developed is not the only language even in India. It is probably the mother tongue of very small number of people. Wonder why?

Tribals are by definition the original inhabitants or ancient dwellers of any country. Similarity between them causes the natural question of the relationship.

Important to understand the direction of migration is not etched in the genes, but are contained elsewhere in archeological signatures or even astrological or climatic factors. Hence the interest in the scientific communities empowered with scientific and technological advances.

So please do not indulge in self serving comments because that will not be taken seriously and overlooked by many.

As far as my knowledge goes there are about 30% of adibasis meaning initial or early inhabitants still living in Odisha. I have lived with them during my childhood days in Jeypore,Koraput. I still remember their dances,songs and the the pudding called mandia jau and many tyoe of roots, one was expensive and sold in slices and looked white in color.

Also important to mention here that Lord Jagannath was their God and now worshipped as Vishnu(Krishna). He is dark in color,however his hands are covered with thick sandle paste. I asked what is the color of his hand stating that it can only be dark, the puja panda did not answer directly. Later he gave me a handful of tulasi leaves.

Clearly different people white, black, yellow, red lived in India. It does not matter how and when but they lived together and produced the present brown race.

However, the sense of a pure aryan(civilized) brahmin caste exists till today. Some in Odisha will prefer a white skin purohit over a dark one.

Also there is a belief in the Varna system which was institutionalized post Vedic days creating the unnecessary division amongst people today based on their birth and color.

Yes in the west there also exists distinctions based on race and religion.

However the western society appreciates people more on what they know and do not hesitate to set aside prejudices and bow down to talent. Many advances in the west now a days are due to prople from the east.

  

It is acknowledged that Sanskrit is a language more suitable for computers and artificial intelligence.

Hopefully Indians will cone forward and help further advance human technology together with Chinese,Japanese,Europeans, Arabs, Pakistanis, and of course Americans.

In this day and age the thumbs of Ekalavyas will not be cut off to protect the interests of the upper castes. I was told that the young people in India do not believe in the caste system today. That is an welcome trend and hope the elders support them and point out to them that caste system is relatively new. Buddha clearly opposed supremacy of people based on the caste system. Let Buddhist thoughts flourish in Indian society along with the Vedic thoughts so well preserved by Sanskrit and yes by the Brahmins!

Best wishes

Deva
