Dear Vidwans,

  

  

'Hmm - someone has vested interest in proving that muNDa people came by sea from SE Asia around 3.5 YBP. What a strange thought.'

  

What was the need for such an investigation?

  

What purpose did the paper serve?

  

How was it helpful in understanding the Munda Language?

  

Did it in any way help the Munda people of the day?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
