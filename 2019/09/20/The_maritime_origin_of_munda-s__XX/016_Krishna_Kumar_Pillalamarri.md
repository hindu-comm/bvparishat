Vishwas,

  

Your superiority complex is very visible here; perhaps in your view it is justified. Yet, you have still not addressed the simple explanation that 'Arya' is a term denoting a nobleman, and nothing more. That it is possible that the westerners usurped the term for themselves is relatable as well. And you keep talking of 'Aryans invading Mundas in the Austroasiatic context in Odisha... If this is not self serving, what is?

  

Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
