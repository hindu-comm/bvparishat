Dear Vishwas,

  

Not really sure what you are trying to prove here with this passage. If it is that Austroasiatic language had a precursor from India, and if that language has Vedic references, it is yet another proof that AIT did not take place. On theother hand, if you want to prove that AIT did take place because of the last declarative sentence in the passage, saying 'a small founder population of Austroasiatic speakers arriving in Odisha from Southeast Asia **before the Aryan conquest** in the Iron-Age', it is not only insufficient, it is a self serving sentence declaring Aryan conquest took place in the Iron age, and that the Austroasiatic speakers pre-dated it. Do you see the obvious contradiction in this?

  

Regards,
