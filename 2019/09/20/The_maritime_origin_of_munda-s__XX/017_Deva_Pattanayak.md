Dear Vishal_ji

There is not much point in analyzing in great detail about what happened in the distant past. Commentaries differ.

Fundamentallyyou agree with my point of view that at this time what is important is to take bold steps to improve the living conditions of every Indians independent of their past lineage.

Fortunately, there runs a thread of togetherness amongst all Indians
whether they are well versed in Sanskrit or not. India today is a nation comprising of nations, each one of them can equal or better any other countries. existing in the world today.

  

It is important that we get rid of the parochial attitudes and let go of divisionary tendencies such as caste system that are not sanctioned by the constitution of India.

  

India must study its ancient Shastras very carefully as well as the Shastras of other countries with an objective of generating new knowledge based on modern science and technology.

  

The Vedas have described beautifullyvarious aspects of nature and how sentient beings are part and parcel of nature. Not only human beings but everything that is visible or invisible are all part of ONE. There is nothing outside of the ONE that encompasses all.  

If we write ONE+Infinity =Infinity+ONE, then takes Infinity to the right hand side and associate with ONE, one obtains the equation,

  

ONE= Infinity+ ( ONE-Infinity).

  

Interestingly a solution of the last equation is that ONE is greater than Infinity! That ONE can be the sound AUM or anything else that one imagines.

  

Best wishes

  

Deva
