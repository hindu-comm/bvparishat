kaNNa, Stop declaring your remote psychoanalytic diagnoses here - I am not your patient and this is not your psych ward. While I may return the favor and/or analyse your diagnoses, moderators and other members of the list won't like it. Best to keep a tight focus on the topic being discussed.

It is not my business to address every (un)declared concern you have in your mind - if you don't like this "misuse" of the word 'Arya' pick something else. I am not interested in silly word-games obscuring the main points being discussed - that is the very definition of vitaNDA as per tarka-shAstra IIRC.

I don't "keep" talking about it - you do. I mentioned it exactly twice: First, while reproducing the summary of a paper on the arrival of muNDa progenitors, and second while responding to your weird objection that I was highlighting a "self serving sentence declaring Aryan conquest took place in the Iron age". For some reason, you seem to use the stock phrase "self-serving" in some idiosyncratic way by which one can not understand what exactly you mean. It is no more "self-serving" than your messages.  
  
If you are having so much trouble grasping the intent behind this thread (again, I could uncharitably speculate about why that is the case, but I won't), go back and reread my initial message a few times - and you might eventually understand that this is not presented as some "proof of AIT", but as relatively neutral demonstration of "how such excellent hypotheses are constructed on the basis of genetic evidence supported by linguistic and historical evidence".
