The paper is not called a theory. It is calling itself a hypothesis.

  

That there are Austro-Asiatic family languages spoken in India is not a news.

  

That Santhals and other such tribes in India speak languages belonging to that family is also not a news.

  

Vedas refer to some people not being within the Vedic fold using various names . It can be guessed that the Austro-Asiatic languages speaking communities were among those referred to there.

  

The paper is proposing a hypothesis about how these people could have reached Indic land.
