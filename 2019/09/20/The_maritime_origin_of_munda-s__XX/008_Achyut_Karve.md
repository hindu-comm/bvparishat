Dear Vidwans,

  

Wanton use of technology funded by vested interests is the root cause.
The wanton use of statistics is further eroding the quality of research papers.

  

Statistics by itself does not tell us anything. Statistics is used to garb the underlying mechanisms to which these scientists have no clue.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
