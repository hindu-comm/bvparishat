The point to be noticed with regard to the distinction of the story / history of tribals in India in comparison to the story of tribals elsewhere is as follows:

  

1\. 'Tribals' of the ancient past in most European countries are nothing but the ancestors of the present Europeans, which means that the Tribals got completely metamorphosed into the civilized.

  

2\. Tribals of the ancient past of South and north America got destroyed by the civilized.

  

3\. Tribals of Africa could survive because they lived in isolation from the civilized.

  

4\. Only in India, Tribals survived for millennia retaining their culture and identity in spite of living alongside nontribal people.

  

5\. Vedic people did not try to either convert or destroy the tribal people . This is evidenced by their survival for millennia retaining their culture and identity.This can be proved to be based on the Vedic worldview that every dharma= natural features of every component of the
overall unit have a role in the overall Dharma.

  

7\. This reality is viewed as hiding knowledge by Brahmins. by the detractors of Brahmins. But it is in fact out of a sincere respect for diversity that they find Tribals not requiring any teaching from outside their society.

  

8\. Austro-asiatic people too could survive here only because of such diversity-respecting worldview of the Vedic people.
