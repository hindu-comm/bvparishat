<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_people>  

  

In Telugu we have a word Dommari used in reference to an acrobatics-performing community.

  

What her the word Domari used here is related to that or not is not clear.

  

But Dommaris also are travelling performers, travel long distances and speak a north Indian language.
