## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Romani_people_in_Bulgaria&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History")\]

### Origin\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Romani_people_in_Bulgaria&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Origin")\]

The Romani people originate from[Northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India "North India")[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"),^([\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHancock2002%5BhttpsbooksgooglecomidMG0ahVw-kdwClpgPP1pgPR20_xx%5D-30)[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-IsabelMendizabal-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-Comas-32)[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-33)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google1-34)[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google2-35))presumably from the northwestern Indian states[Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan "Rajasthan")^([\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google1-34)[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google2-35))and[Punjab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India "Punjab, India").^([\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google1-34))

The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines.^([\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-mluvnice-36))

More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi")and[Punjabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language "Punjabi language"). It shares many phonetic features with[Marwari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marwari_(language) "Marwari (language)"), while its grammar is closest to[Bengali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language "Bengali language").^([\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-hub1995-37))

Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group.^([\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-IsabelMendizabal-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-Comas-32)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-38))According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes")populations of[northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India "North India")[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), traditionally referred to collectively as the[Ḍoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B8%8Coma "Ḍoma"), are the likely ancestral populations of the modern European Roma.^([\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-39))

In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the[Indian Minister of External Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_External_Affairs_(India) "Minister of External Affairs (India)")stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the[Government of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India "Government of India")to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the[Indian diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_diaspora "Indian diaspora").^([\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-diaspora-7))

### Migration to Bulgaria\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Romani_people_in_Bulgaria&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Migration to Bulgaria")\]

The migration of the Romani people through the[Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East")and[North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa")to Europe. The key shows the century of arrival in that area, e.g.,*S.XII*is the 12th century

The Romani people emigrated from[Northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India "North India")[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"),^([\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google1-34)[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google2-35))presumably from the northwestern Indian states of[Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan "Rajasthan")^([\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google1-34)[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google2-35))and[Punjab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India "Punjab, India"),^([\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-google1-34))possibly as early as 600 A.D. They emigrated to the Middle East and then reached the European continent.^([\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-books.google.ca-40))Moreover, "the Roma (the name is the plural form of the word “Rom”) moved from India at the beginning of the 12th century, reached Europe in the 14th century and Central Europe in the 15th century."^([\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-europa2-41))The language of the Romani people is called Romani \[romaňi čhib\] or Romany. It is an[Indic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_languages "Indo-Aryan languages")(or[Indo-Aryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_languages "Indo-Aryan languages")) language — like[Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit"),[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), and[Bengali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language "Bengali language")— which belongs to the[Indo-Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages "Indo-Iranian languages")branch of the Indo-European family. The language retains much of the Indic morphology, phonology and lexicon, while its syntax has been heavily influenced by contact with other languages.

Bulgarian ethnologists Elena Marushiakova and Veselin Popov assert that no direct evidence indicates when precisely the Romani first appeared in Bulgaria. While they mention that other Bulgarian and international scholars have associated the 1387[Charter of Rila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Bulgarian_royal_charters "Medieval Bulgarian royal charters")term*Agoupovi Kleti*with the Romani, they hold that the term refers to seasonal lodgings for mountain herdsmen. Instead, they delimit the mass settlement of Romani in Bulgarian territory between the 13th and 14th centuries, supporting this time frame with 13th- and 14th-century documents referring to Romani presence in the surrounding Balkan states.^([\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-42))According to Bulgarian sociologist Ilona Tomova, Ottoman fiscal reports between the 15th and 17th centuries indirectly indicate Romani settlement in Bulgaria since the 13th century, as most registered Romani possessed[Slavonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages "Slavic languages")names and were Christians.^([\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-tomova-43))

> "Although the largest Roma migration wave to the Bulgarian lands seems > to have occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries, many Roma arrived > with the Ottoman troops, accompanying army craftsmen and complementary > military units."

In addition, during the 14th and 15th centuries, Muslim Romani arrived in Bulgaria with the[Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire")rule, serving as auxiliaries, craftsmen, musicians and other professions.^([\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-tomova-43)[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-44))Unlike the Ottoman Empire's other subjects in the[millet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_(Ottoman_Empire) "Millet (Ottoman Empire)")system, Romani were governed based on their ethnicity, not their religious affiliation.^([\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-celik5-45))Ottoman tax records first mention Romani in the[Nikopol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikopol,_Bulgaria "Nikopol, Bulgaria")region, where 3.5% of the registered households were Romani. Under[Mehmed II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_II "Mehmed II")’s reign, all Romani — Christian and Muslim — paid a poll-tax that was otherwise imposed only on non-Muslims.^([\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-46))

During the 16th century,[Suleiman I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent "Suleiman the Magnificent")enacted laws to prohibit the mingling of Muslim and Christian Romani and to administer taxes collected from the Romani: the 1530*Gypsies in the[Rumelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumelia "Rumelia")Region Act*and a 1541 law for the Romani[sancak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak "Sanjak").^([\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-tomova-43)[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-47))[Muslim Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Roma "Muslim Roma")were taxed less than Christian Romani,^([\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-celik5-45))yet they were taxed more than other Muslims for not adhering to Islamic laws and customs.^([\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-48))Ottoman imperial assembly registers from 1558-1569 characterize the Romani as*ehl-i fesad*(people of malice), charging them with crimes such as prostitution, murder, theft, vagrancy and counterfeiting.^([\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Bulgaria#cite_note-49))
