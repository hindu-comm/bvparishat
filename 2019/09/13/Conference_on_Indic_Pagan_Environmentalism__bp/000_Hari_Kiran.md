Pranaams to All

  

It gives me great pleasure to announce a Conference on Indic & Pagan Environmentalism in Hyderabad during the second half of January 2020.

  

After the innovative and comprehensive Call for Paper for the Conference on Oneness, Nagaraj ji once again hits the ball out of the park with this brilliant call for papers that outlines our thought behind bringing together of Indic & Pagantraditions Please do read the same without fail. It is seminal in its thought and approach.

  

We will also be holding a Land & Environmental Art Sculptors camp for creating installations inspired by the conference theme and papers. We hope to facilitate interaction and deeper engagement between Scholars & Sculptors.

  

Hari
