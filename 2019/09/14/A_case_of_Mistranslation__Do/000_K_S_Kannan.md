*Three Satires by Nilakantha, Kshemendra, and Bhallata*

Edited and Translated by Somadeva Vasudeva  

& published by The Clayton Sanskrit Library &  

New York University Press, 2005.

  

This book has been reviewed by Edwin Gerow who is by no means all praise for the book.  

He has noticed many errors/irregularities in the book.

  

But even he seems to have missed the mistranslation by Somadeva Vasudeva  

of a verse of कलिविडम्बनम् therein.  

  

I chanced upon this = verse 44:

जामातुर् वक्रता तावद्  

 यावच् छ्यालस्य बालता ।

प्रबुद्ध्यमाने सारल्यं

 प्रबुद्धेऽस्मिन् पलायनम् ॥

  

Somadeva Vasudeva translates it thus:

"While the son-in-law is young—the brother-in-law is deceitful;  

when he begins to understand—he is forthright;  

when he has grown to understand—he takes ﬂight."  

  

But the correct translation would be:

"When the *brother-in-law is young*, the *son-in-law is* deceitful etc.."

  

He has obviously interchanged the words son-in-law and brother-in-law!  

- And killed thereby the very punch of the verse. *  
*

A case of *anvaya* not paid proper attention to!  

  

I do not know if anyone has noticed this shortcoming in the 14 years since its publication.  

Or whether any correction has been issued by the publisher.
