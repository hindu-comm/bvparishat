This is patently wrong. All of humanity (from the lowliest baker to Kepler) had a role in Newton's discoveries ("standing on the shoulder of giants", but where would he be but for the bread to eat). But they did not have "equal hand" - Newton's hand deserves the most credit, Kepler and co next, some random baker very little. If we say "राजा कालस्य कारणम्", we mean that the king has the greatest hand in how his times will turn out, the hand of some small bureaucrat is relatively very minor. In the same sense, the hand of the revered brAhmaNa-s is the orders of magnitude larger in forming hinduism and bringing forth the vedic world view down to us than the many times more populous businessmen and artisans (who anyway oft more freely engaged with shramaNa counter-religions).

No question of demand - rather one of observation. That regard and respect which was once the norm, is now considered by some so-called enlightened-hindu-warriors as something backward and counterproductive.  

  

Subsidiary points:

Just because one chants something, it does not necessarily mean that one feels it. Also, the above only applies to upanIta dvija-s, whereas in days past, even others (women and shUdra-s) had enough sense to feel this gratitude and sense of duty.

True - to add - diminishing them and their contributions is a way of denying this debt even as one acts as if one is repaying those debts.

You and Sriram are mistaken here. If you want to believe the purANa-s, the great son of hermit lomaharShaNa, ugrashravas or sauti or sUta was not the product of pratiloma marriage involving either a vaishya or kShatriya male. The itihAsa-s and purANa-s are "sanitized" in that sense - for better examples one might need to dig the veda-s. Anyway, the identity of the "brAhmaNas" is a bit orthogonal to (acknowledgement of) their contributions.
