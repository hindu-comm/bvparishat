I am sure lots of hands would have gone up if he asked about dvikAla sandhyAvandana.  
  
Anyway, निरस्तपादपे देशय् एरण्डोऽपि द्रुमायते। How many vaishya-s and kShatriya-s exercise their right (and duty) to do adhyayana of veda-s? Forget that, what about sandhyAvandana? At least some kShatriya clans have stemmed degeneracy enough to atleast undergo the upanayana saMskAra (even if they don't follow up on it in daily practice). Which shAkhA of the veda or major shAstra has survived because of the toil (rather than general sponsorship) of vaishya-s, shUdra-s and kShatriya-s?

So, just because lots of shUdrified brAhmaNa-s don't appreciate the critical role of their erstwhile varNa in society - rathern than include them in the population of brutes who need to be educated better, we should stop correcting mistaken proclamations and attitudes of people from other jAti-s? Doesn't compute.

Wrong - the disregard is also for the brAhmaNa varNa and jAti as it stood over the millennia - not just modern brahma-bandhu-s who can't say a mantra properly (who are in fact not even in the picture as far as much of the criticism is concerned).

Often grounded upon pride in their family and tradition, and a sacred sense of duty. If brAhmaNa archaka-s serve in those village temples suffering paltry salaries lower than what the watchman or sweeper gets, it is because of kulAbhimAna and sense of heridetary duty than anything else. Were it not for this familial urge and pride, the shAkha-s of veda which have come down to us would not at all have survived. (To illustrate the point, now that anyone can go to certain veda-pAThashAla-s and study the veda-s, relatively speaking, how many non-brAhmaNa-s have taken to them fully?)
