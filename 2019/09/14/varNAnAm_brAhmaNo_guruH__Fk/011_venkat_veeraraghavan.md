    The performance of a sacrifice required meticulous cooperation from all varNas especially kshatriyas...There are specific rules that a King can employ a Brahmana who has fallen off his nityakarma in the capacity of a shudra..so kshatriyas specifically Kings were a huge causal factor in protection of Dharma ..YES the Brahmanas were the thin end of this wedge, but this would have been impossible without the support of other varNas that lent strength and wieldability to that sword.

This is evidencially borne out by the wholesale slaughter of kshatriyas at Kurukshetra right before the start of this epoch and that has causally lead to the decline in Brahmanas and dharma as a whole.

  Many statistics claim that the percentage of Brahmins in India is around 1%. My guesstimate is that the real % is close to 0.001% if the minimum standard is sva-shakha adhyayana and trikala sandhya.

The problem is that dharma is not the preserve of a few but that of whole society. Even within Brahmana kulas how many are ready to let their daughters get married to boys who have done veda-adhyayana? When the people inside Brahmanakula have such scant respect for Veda-vids? Why are we complaining aboout lack of respect or appreciation from without?

When a few are left to carry dharma on their shoulders, it is not surprising that Brahmanakulas are generally held in low regard.

The disregard is for modern jAti Brahmins (Brahmana-bandhus) and not for the ancient Seers whom all sensible people (barring a few) agree are Supermen. Even within this forum there are respected people who can hold their heads high in any sabha. This was earned by blood and sweat and sheer merit.

 --> No one is denying or diminishing them. Atleast not me. I just came out of a severe disagreement with a gentleman who claimed that Maricha wore wigs to fool Rama which automatically puts the lie at Valmiki's door.... :)
