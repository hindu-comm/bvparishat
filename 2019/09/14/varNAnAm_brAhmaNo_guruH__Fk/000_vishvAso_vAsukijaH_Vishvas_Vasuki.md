नमस्ते,

  

This topic came up in a thread on misinformation on recent papers pertaining to Aryan invasion - I thought it fit to start a separate thread should participants care to discuss it further. For my part, I will present the paxa I favor:  

  

It is abundantly clear from shAstra-s (right from veda-s to later dharmashAstra-s) that brAhmaNa-s were indeed a civilizing, conservative force and a harmonizing influence on society. For example, a famous saying goes: "गुरुरग्निर्द्विजातीनां वर्णानां ब्राह्मणो गुरुः । पतिरेव गुरुः स्त्रीणां सर्वस्याभ्यागतो गुरुः ।।".  
  
As I mentioned earlier, "Conservation of core vaidika ideas over millennia and across genepool-shifts involved evolution of a well-developed and influential ritualist caste (brAhmaNa-s) with a powerful oral tradition and specifically a grammatical tradition that allowed preservation of the language, especially in ritual." If Hindu India is considered a single civilization (unlike - say Europe), it is due to the brAhmaNa glue. This is akin to the role of the strong ritualist guild among the Lithuanians (the last major European pagan tradition to fall to Christianity) or the fairly successful Iranian ritualist guild.  
Being mostly non-threatening to the ruling elite, they facilitated the gradual Aryanization (= vedicization) of various host populations - even in the languages.

  

That this uncontroversial fact is rejected by some, rankling them to the extant of triggering abuse and scorn is remarkable.
