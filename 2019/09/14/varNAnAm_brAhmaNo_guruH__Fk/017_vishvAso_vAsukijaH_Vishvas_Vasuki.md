The last sentence above is very misleading. It would be all-right to say - or atleast add: "Others were sometimes not given adequate opportunity to develop their full potential and thereby contributing to their fullest capacity." It is not as if "others" demanded and sought advancement in contributing to dharma in the form of warriorship or scholarship or whatever, but were "prevented" by evil backward people. Think about it - who prevented vaishya-s from mastering veda-s and shAstra-s? Why is it so much easier to find a shUdra mastering nyAyashAstra and being honoured in the vAkyArthasabhA of shRngeri than a vaishya or kShatriya?

  

Yes, the system was and is suboptimal and can be subject to improvement - that's true of \*any system\*. That should not give one license to declare it more broken than it actually was (especially when it was a key to past successes).

Even though it is odd to pick up one subhAShita while ignoring lots of other sayings: "Because most of them actually had humble origins" should be corrected to "Because some of them actually had humble origins". That's the most that can be said.

The correct assessment of the extant and relative importance of the role of the brAhmaNa-s cannot be ascertained just by picking an eclectic assemblage of "saints", since it ignores the contributions of the vast majority of shAstra-kAra-s and regular brAhmaNa-s who went about their 6-fold duties.  
  

Since you've indicated some knowledge of statistics, I present this analogy. You have a scatter plot to which you can fit a 80 degree line. Yet, you choose outliers closer to the x-axis, fit a line to it - and voila - you got a 45 degree line.

Rather, the converse. Because of churches cropping up everywhere, and because chruch doctrine finds its ways into so-called enlightened hindus, respect for brAhmaNa-s drops. Practicing brAhmaNa-s themselves (such as sendAlankAra jeer - <http://www.vsktamilnadu.org/2016/08/hindu-seer-turned-tables-on-jihadi.html> or pejAvara svAmi or the kAnchi seers or TTD trust ) are at the forefront of countering churches and mosques. If the churches and mosques find it nearly impossible to encroach into the periphery of tirumala or shabarImala, it is because of the power of the respective brAhmaNa-ritualist-led cults. Were it not for the brAhmaNa conservative core, Hindu society would have fallen like so many "folk" paganisms (nAgas, kuki-s, mizo-s, assorted african tribes, amerindians, papuans vs say the meiteis or balinese).

Just two days ago, I walked into my cousin's home where they were watching "Super 30" and noted a couple of dialogues where the hero (Hritik Roshan?) gets told that he best focus on educating the children of privileged people because mahAbhArata (citing ekalavya story) and purANa-s says so. Does such propaganda mean that one should stop referring to mahAbhArata and purANa-s with high regard? Ditto with anti-brAhmaNa and anti-FC propaganda.  
  

Anyway, not denying that dosage of truth should be administered with careful consideration of the damage done to the victim of anti-hindu poisoning.

No it doesn't - I cannot even see how that's relevant to the prior thread. Since you've posted it as a "BTW" unconnected with this thread, we best drop it anyway.

On the other hand, look up "Son also rises" by Gregory Clark - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c2Ugb4VKH8> or <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8S-_L4eZQ4> for example. Also, saMskAra-s are highly inheritable even if not fully genetically inheritable.  
  
Not to deny exceptions (eg: Narendra Modi), of course, but as a general rule.
