Namaste



This debate here is a \< beginning less- endless> debate which makes relevance only when placed in a 'framed context'.

The exchange of posts keep shifting the ' framed context in sliding scales of \< time-text-practice- relevance> as suits their convenience of charge and response.

What I get confused in going through this series of exchanges makes me seek position clarification for the following questions to firm up the 'frame of debate'.



***Here below are the questions***:



**A) When the thread is around the theme \< वर्णानाम् ब्राह्मणो गुरुः \> , what is the referential frame work of \< Varna- Brahmana> definition
by which this debate stands?**



 A-1) 'Varna' categorization as a socio-historical tag of post Mahabharata / Kalyuga/ Gita where ' Birth base' is NOT the factoring list ! Why leave it fuzzy ??


OR

 'Varna' categorization as a socio-historical tag of post Buddhist period / Puranas/ Vedanta-Acharya Sampradayas culminating in a reference book like 'Dharma-

 Sindhu' which anchors ' Janma, Achara and Samskara' together 'for the ' Brahmana + Varna Tag' and locks it to Manu smriti !



Clarity on this helps to respond clearly on : Socio-spiritual intertwine in this discussion.



**B) Why clamor or regret to become and be a Brahmana and point to those ' temple anchored archaka community' as ' best samples of Brahmanas' ?**

****

** **Clarity on this helps to respond clearly on : Spiritual and Sanatana Dharma sampradaya intertwine in this discussion. The role of ' Guru's become clear in this debate.****



***C) Has anyone worked on the 'History and Dynamics of the Brahmana Jeevikaa Vruttis' across India, in three segments of *(B-i) Colonial rule (B-ii) Independent India (B- iii) Globalized India where NRI's are seeking vedic authority on ' Who is Brahmana? How'- using Colonial translations and lens? **



Clarity on this helps to respond clearly on : Global Religion-Caste
intertwine and 'social challenges of being a stickler to 'brahmana-achara' in this discussion.



I understand that there are no simple straight forward answers for this. But without addressing these issues, using a medley of preferential quotes and texts will not help to firm up and frame-context of debate.



If one considers that this debate is of critical interest to the 1% ( .001%) members of Hindu community, it is much more important and critical for the rest of the 99% Indians and Hindus at India and Globe. So, why is this discussion getting made in a truncated scale ??
