Dear shrI venkat,

  

Exceptions do not a norm make. And we are talking about brAhmaNa role in conserving and propagating vedic worldview (veda-s, itihAsa-s, purANa-s, the basic vedAnga-s including the divine language, vedic and Agamika rituals), not arts like warfare, painting, weaving or animal husbandry. This role is attested both by shAstra-s/ kAvya-s as well as by the ultimate deeds. As far as the former is concerned, they performed a splendid job. Everything has its shortcomings and areas for improvement, of course. Our enemies (be it portuguese or muslim sultans) recognized this important role quite quickly and targeted them, producing heaps of janeu-s and pyramids of skulls. Of course, this can only happen with full support of other varNa-s, especially the warriors - कालो वा कारणं राज्ञो राजा वा कालकारणम् । इति ते संशयो मा भूत् राजा कालस्य कारणम् ॥, शस्त्रेण रक्षिते राष्ट्रे शास्त्रचिन्ता प्रवर्तते।

  

Still, to not recognize this critical role of the brAhmaNa-s and be grateful to them is a blindness brought about by post-modernist subalternist subversion. Some prolific commentators here are victims of this. Gratefulness is a basic route to happiness and fulfilment (not to mention continued success) enjoined by the sages - for example in the form of the daily panchamahAyajJNa-s to offset debts to the manes/ ancestors, Gods, sages, men and beings. Unable to retain equanimous objectivity, twisted arrogant minds view this sadbhAvana crookedly (aisaan faraamoshi or whatever), just as they mock other positive attributes (parAkrama, vIrya etc..).
