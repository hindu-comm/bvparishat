Dear Shri Vishvas ji-

  

I am of two minds regarding this because my mind is not made up about this aspect. Although adhyayana and adhyapana were two of the duties of Brahmans, there is extensive evidence in Mahabharata of Kshatriyas transmitting knowledge

1\. Arjuna to Gandharva Chitraratha (Giving him Agneyastra along with the hymns to transmit and recall)

2\. Pradyumna to Upa-Pandavas and Abhimanyu

3\. Krishna to Arjuna

  

A friend and good acquaintance told me that Bhishma despite being competent did not instruct the Kuru princes and instead devolved that duty upon Krpa and Drona as an acknowledgement of the pre-eminence of Brahmanas in the matter of Knowledge transmission.

This assertion however is not borne by the other incidents in the epic some of which I have mentioned above.

If a Brahmana alone was to be sought for knowledge, why did the Pandavas go to Bhishma in the matter of neeti Rajyadharma etc instead of resorting to Vyasa who was available to them or even Dhaumya who was their priest?

  

Anyone can be accused of anachara these days but surely this could not apply to the Pandavas.

There are wheels within wheels here that we may never fully understand until we get back our achara and the original context.

  

varNa is not well understood even now. And if the Yaksha Prashna is any indication, it is conduct and tapascharya alone that marks out a Brahmana and not mere birth as per Dharmaraja Yudhisthira himself. This answer also finds approval with Lord Yama.

  

That pretty much hits the issue out of the park for me.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
