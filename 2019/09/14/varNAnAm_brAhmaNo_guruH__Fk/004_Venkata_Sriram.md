Namaste,

  

When Romaharsha, a sUta, was killed by Balarama with kusha grass, the sages who were present around enaged in sacrifices, uttered in agony and pain as “O Balarama ! Alas ! you have unknowingly killed a sage, a brahmana, who was occupying the position of ‘brahmAsana’ ie., an elevated position meant for learned brahmaNa ; thus, by killing him, sin of killing a brahmana has been incurred..  

  

अस्य ***ब्रह्मासनं*** दत्तं अस्माभिर्यदुनन्दन ।

आयुश्चात्माक्लमं तावद् यावत् सत्रं समाप्यते ॥ ३० ॥

अजानतैवाचरितः त्वया ***ब्रह्मवधो*** यथा ।

योगेश्वरस्य भवतो नाम्नायोऽपि नियामकः ॥ ३१ ॥

यद्येतद् ***ब्रह्महत्यायाः*** पावनं लोकपावन ।

चरिष्यति भवांल्लोक सङ्ग्रहोऽनन्यचोदितः ॥ ३२ ॥



Note: Romaharsha was a sUta and was the disciple of Veda Vyasa. He was killed by Balarama because he didn’t stood up in respect when Balarama entered the place of sacrifice when rest of the sages paid respect.  

  

My sanskrit teacher used to say thatब्राह्मणाःwho are byवर्णः, are the '*custodians of brahma-vidya*' and should protect the scriptures, uplift the rest to their stature rather than debarring them from the sacred knowledge. The above episode from Bhagavatam clearly indicate that a sUta was given '*ब्रह्मस्थानम्*' among the assembly of scholars present there; and, his death lead toब्रह्महत्यादोषः. Thus, there is a मर्यादा for all to behave properly as per the scriptures.

  

rgs,

sriram
