---->Apologies for my typo above correct " trikala sandhyavandana " to "sandhyavandana"

--> I am not exaggerating when I say I am in touch with and know of 5-6 families where no sandhyavandana is done..and I live in dravidadesha where supposedly achara exists in its most pristine form. My mama started doing "sandhyavandana" and "Brahmayajna" after his sadhabhisheka (apparently someone told him it was good for his grandchildren). I have put "" on the rituals since i do not want to know what exactly he does in the name of those rituals. As long as he was doing shraaddham he never did sandhyavandana and now he has stopped doing shraddham also.

I get laughed off by my cousins' children when I try to tell them about sandhyavandana because their parents are more interested in their promotion and faux social status rather than their achara. I have spoken to 2/3 friends who have fallen in with false Gurus and have wasted 10-15 years of their life. I openly told them this would never have happened if they had not ditched their achara for other pastures. How is one to tell a "gaddha" that without some sort of chittashuddhi one cannot even recognise a real Guru? "paani peejai chaankar guru keejai jaankar"--Kabir

One of them has started avoiding me on whatsapp whenever I say hello.

Notoriety is my only karmaphala.

---> When the erstwhile seer of Kanchi was asked why his disciple left his danda and walked away? He answered "must be some deficiency in my tapasya"...I am not trying to vie with his holiness here but frankly trying to correct others is a waste of time. The only thing I can correct is myself and hope and pray that good sense and dharma dawns on others too.
