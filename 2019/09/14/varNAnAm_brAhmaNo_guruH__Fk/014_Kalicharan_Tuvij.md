Namaste,

Steppe_ancestry or such terms are mathematical creations: taken as basis population. The fact is you can make up your own basis populations.  
In the end it is just mathematical modeling: there is no way to be sure in reality as to who is the ancestor of whom.  
So one needs to understand that the kind of modeling done in the present studies was to confirm a particular world-view. Also note that the present genome-wide technique is adopted (with e.g. Swat valley in fact showing up "female Aryan invasion" of sorts) after the earlier haplogroup methods (focusing on R1a for example) began to indicate Iranian home for P.I.E. (not acceptable to that world-view).  
Personally I tend to think of castes such as Bhumihars (whom I've observed for long) as more typical of Adi-brAhmaNa-s than any other; not to speak of a general South Indian bias I see here on any topic in general.  
Varna-s are higher modes of Nature. Among the warriors, for example,  
A Kshatriya knows how to fight  
A Shudra knows how to defend  
A Brahmin knows how to kill

There are no restrictions on who can do what. Historically also that's the case.
