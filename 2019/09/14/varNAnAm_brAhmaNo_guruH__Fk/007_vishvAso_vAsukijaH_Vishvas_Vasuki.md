I don't demand gratitude or acceptance of any fact; and people are free to believe and feel anything according to their cognitive and sentimental capacities. However, the noble shAstra-s and sages do suggest that for our \*own benefit and wellbeing\*, one must ever be grateful. (The generations of brAhmaNa-s or the species of cows don't become any smaller because of the stunted mentality of some person. The flawed person is the biggest looser.) This being the case, I feel it quite appropriate to contest any negation or ridiculing of our respectful gratitude for brAhmaNa contributions, calling it "brahmin supremacy" etc. - lest it become the "politically approved" fad here as well.
