Dear Shri Vishal ji-

  

Agree with the bulk of what you say except the following:

  

"Or may be I have no right or authority (or 'intellectual capacity') to speak on this matter, because I was not born in a Brahmana household."

  

Can you stop doing that please?

Let us discuss the merits of arguments and leave the personalities alone.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
