Dear Shri Vishvas ji-

  

The question of gratitude is moot since we as a rule in sandhyavandana pray for the wellbeing of cows and brahmanas as phalashruti. So essentially we live in a perennial state of gratitude rather than remember them now and then to thank them.

The best way of thanking them is to keep up the highest standards possible of personal achara and nityakarma. When we perform Brahmayajna as you pointed out we repay rshi rNa along with deva and pitru rNas.

  

Now, the definition of "brahmana" may vary given the current state of confusion.

The BG gives a clear definitionas do most of the itihasa puranas on the lakshaNas.

  

As Sriram Garu pointed out even a suta ( a product of varNasankara) was given the status and seat of Brahmana by even the rshis (not normal jAti Brahmins) in a bygone age

The other issues which need to be considered :

1\. Why expect gratitude when what we do is our meagre effort at saving dharma ? We only did our duty here. Nothing special.

2\. The rshis imho are much beyond notions of gratitude and keep giving like the Sun does.

3\. Gratitude invites grace automatically. It is an individual characteristic and cannot be demanded en-mass.

4\. Taking the analogy in the purusha sukta, the hands take food to the mouth ..so also the kshatriyas protect the Brahmanas who in turn nurture and protect the other three varNas. So, whatever "dharma" has been saved till date, all 4 varNas who performed their assigned duties with perfection have equal hand in this.

I am not saying this to be poltically correct or to appear intellectual (never cared for pretenses).

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
