Its interesting that you should bring this up at a time when I ran across something written by Sarvesh Tiwari/BharatenduH on twitter.

  

He has looked at the same aspect from a different angle. Instead of looking at who is the Guru, he has looked at what is to be considered as pramaNa.

  

I quote him below:

QUOTE

"In the सूत्र “वैदिकमीश्वरोक्तत्वात्सर्वमेव प्रमाणम्”, the definition of the nyAyakAra is focusing on two things:

 - ईश्वरोक्त - सर्वं 

He says “because Ishvara uttered it”, its “entire corpus” is प्रमाण"

  

now bhagavadgītā also is प्रमाण surely, but not because of being वैदिकवाक्यं, and also not every utterancebof it. We should use the next sUtra given by अन्नम्भट्ट - लौकिकं त्वाप्तोक्तं प्रमाणं। Because कृष्ण is an आप्तपुरुष what he says is प्रमाणं। It might also be argued

that कृष्ण’s utterances are ईश्वरोक्तं and is therefore equivalent to वेदवाक्यं itself (as per the previous sUtra) and thus प्रमाणम्। On the other hand, arjuna is not an आप्तपुरुष। his utterances are not ईश्वरोक्तानि। that neither qualifies for प्रमाणम् by the first nor the 2nd.

  

UNQUOTE

  

Although Arjuna and Krishna were both Mahapurushas by modern and ancient standards only one is considered Apta.

You could investigate further along those lines/definitions to come to a resolution in this matter. Maybe some of the scholars on this forum can throw more light on आप्तपुरुष and the qualities to identify such a one.
