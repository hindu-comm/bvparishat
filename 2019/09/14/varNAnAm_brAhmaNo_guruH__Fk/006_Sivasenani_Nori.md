Sri Vishvas

  

Let us say that the role of Brahmanas in conserving and propagating the Vedic world view is agreeable to any person or group.

  

All that can be reasonably expected, then, is that such agreement or lack of it be expressed, or, in other words, the role of Brahmanas be acknowledged, or denied. This is something which can have a binary outcome.

  

Demanding gratitude is a different thing. Gratitude depends on the individual concerned, how he or she thinks etc; also other aspects could overpower the need for gratitude. To cite an example, some might feel and express gratitude to the Monier-Williams dictionary project; others might see it as a part of a larger evangelical project and feel that no gratitude is due.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
