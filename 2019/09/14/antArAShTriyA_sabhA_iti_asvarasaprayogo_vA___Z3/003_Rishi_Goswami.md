Namaskar Shastriji \_/\\\_  
  
I'm not so read in Sahitya and mostly speak Sanskrit as a 3rd or 4th language, so I'm not able to understand the idiomatic incorrectness of अन्ताराष्ट्रिया सभा .  
  
In case of grammar, i think it isn't asadhu, ढ्रलोपे and राष्ट्रावार rules are forming this new word, but idiomatic incorrectness can be in what way?
