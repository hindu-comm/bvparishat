I have got a private reply saying I am against coining new words. It is absolutely wrong.  
Every language has to create new word in the same time, some famous words will be disappeared. For instance Taddhita PrakaraNa of Panini has some rules to form a word for a particular business which is never used or understood in this era.  
Please read panini kaleena Bharata Varsha  
PANINI KALIN BHARATVARSH <https://www.amazon.in/dp/B072J3R9PG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_zqeFDb99Q6VPN>  
  
It is ridiculous that only Sanskrit people think that forming new word is a problem.  
  
It is common with all languages and for others it'd never a problem. For example, Computer, motherboard, transistor these are the words newly formed. Even mobile phone.  
  
Let me clear my point. Forming new word is not a problem. But is should be idiomatically and grammatically correct. I have seen 1000s of such words from old journals and Charudeva Shastri's Gandhi Charita, Satyavrata Shastri's books. The words formed like, coverpage , bold font, soap फेनखण्ड , water tap, train etc and they are obsultuly flawless.  
  
My only objection is, for example,  
"I have recovered (from fever)"  
Should not be translated as  
ज्वरात् पुनरावृतम्। re =पुनर् , covered =आवृतम्  
If you are a real scholar you then you can find a word in the classical literature as उल्लाघ for that. Hence coining new word is not a problem and it is necessary for any language even for English, but coining grammatically correct but idiomatically hopeless is not tolerable.  
  
Thanks for reading and supporting.
