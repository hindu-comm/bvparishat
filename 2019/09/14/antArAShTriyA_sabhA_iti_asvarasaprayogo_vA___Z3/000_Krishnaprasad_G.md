Dear all

Recently I happened to see the Vakyartha sadas (it's a mere anuvaadas and wrongly named as Vakyartha). I really wonder using unidiomatic wordअन्ताराष्ट्रिया सभा even in a gathering of traditional scholars. The application part of Sanskrit Grammar is only up to the coining of words using अन्ता by the rule ढृलोपे etc is flawless. However writing grammatically intact word can be idiomatically nonsense. What is the vigraha vaakya of अन्ताराष्ट्रिया सभा

The application of Alankara Sastra says For instance दैवत is read both in neuter and masculine by Amara, but Mammata criticized the usage of masculine. Considering this point of view, it is better to be careful while coining the new words.

  

  

Recently I also happened to see using a word सुधाखण्ड for a chalk, but खटिनी कखटी कटी is the kosa for chalk. I feel it is better to use the words which has a usage in classical literature or at least if not should be idiomatically correct.

  

And also in Tenali परीक्षा I have seen writing

परीक्षायामुत्तीर्णः I think it should be in accusative but not locative case.

  

This is said only for जिज्ञासा I hope no one takes personally.

  

सुत्रैः पाणिनिनिर्मितैर्बहुतरैर्निष्पाद्य शब्दावलिं वैकुण्ठस्तवमक्षमा रचयितुं मिथ्याश्रमाः शाब्दिकाः। पक्वान्नं विविधं श्रमेण विविधापूपाग्र्यसूपान्वितं

मन्दाग्नीननुरुन्धते मितबलानाघ्रातुमप्यक्षमान्।।
