Shri Sreekarji,

Jai Shri Ram!

"Durga Saptasahti" also known as "Chandi-Paath" is an authoritative work for this purpose.

It is a part of "Markandeya Purana" and is available in various editions, the best one being from Gita Press, Gorakhpur, ----cheap and best----with a Hindi translation to boot.

Probably, it is available on the net also in pdf format.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
