Indic civilisation has been created and nurtured by our unique institution of Guru - Sishya Parampara.

Indic Academy, has been celebrating and honouring Gurus at its annual Grateful2Guru event.

This year the scope has been widened to honour close to 108 Gurus, from across the country through Indic Academyâ€™s city chapters.

The Chennai Chapter is honoured to announce, 13 Gurus have consented to be in our presence on September 7, at Tatvaloka, Eldams Road.

Their ongoing contributions relate to several facets of our culture

Former Chief Election Commissioner Shri N Gopalaswami, himself a committed Dharmika, has agreed to preside over the ceremonies, which includes Vedic chanting.

Please come with your friends and family to honour our real leaders and guides.

You will be enriched by the experience.
