Dear Irene,

I don't think I can explain in simple language.

You may view the folk art or listen to the folk music and talk to the practitioners.  

It is the earth-centric view of realism and gratitude versus the skyward view.of prayer and seeking as I observe.

I am trying to collect the lyrics from the area folk songs for possible analysis.

Best wishes,

BM
