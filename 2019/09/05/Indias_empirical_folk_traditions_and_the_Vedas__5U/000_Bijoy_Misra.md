Dear friends,

  

In various threads we are talking about the concept of universality in Indian thought system.

If you analyze deeply (many solitary walks in the woods) you would come to the realization

of the triviality of human superiority. What maintains the system is its utter orderliness

which is self-adjusting towards the goal of sustenance. Though the Vedas sing about it,

I am forming the belief that the discovery is due to the early inhabitants in India who loved

the fertility of the soil and the abundance of food and so created a habitat system of

basic non-injury to the planet.  

  

The determination that the ground as the source of food and the water as the source of life

are two fundamental discoveries of the early man. The historical period for this would be  

before the Indus Civilization since there is evidence that agriculture was already established  

during the Indus Period. There is new human migration story where people find trace  

that agriculture was introduced through the northeast about 40,000 BC.
But fruits and roots  

as food resources and water as the health resource would be more indigenous discovery in  

the land.

  

We can think that the consideration of the divinity of land and the sanctity of water

could be much older than the period of compilation of the Vedic thoughts. While the Vedas  

do incorporate these, they do get stuck in the heavens and the air, which leads to the

thought that the Vedas are possibly the product of a people who were affected by catastrophic

changes in climate. Sustained drought could force people to lament on their early life

and look for new habitat eastward. However people in the east might have been strongly

earth-centric and had possible difficulty in accepting the Vedic rituals and the concepts

of fire sacrifices.

  

This is a reconstruction in my mind after traveling through the inner tracts in upper

Mahanadi, Chhatrisgarh and the Jharkhand. The inhabitants there continue to operate  

on a very earthy culture that develops dance, music and art, not much prayers or mysticism.

  

Thought to share.
