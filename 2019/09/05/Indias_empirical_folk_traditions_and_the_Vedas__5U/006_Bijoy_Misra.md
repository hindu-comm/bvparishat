Dear Irene,

This whole topic of how much indigenous culture has influenced the Indian literature needs fresh analysis.

Non-injury, harmony, environment, purity, nutrition, food, health are all empirical elements in forming society.

The Vedas have eventually acceded to these through the Upanisads. My interest has been to probe the

origin of thoughts. "Man is superior" is only a statement for an urban person possibly as a defense in survival.

You can see how the आरोपित logic has clouded our thoughts. It continues in order to create artificial

hierarchy to help maintain aggressive conduct. Lately we talk of love and kill arbitrarily.! We are destroying

more vegetation to pollute the planet!

Please do visit the inner lands of India before they are wiped out through cultural invasion! You would find joy

and humanity!
