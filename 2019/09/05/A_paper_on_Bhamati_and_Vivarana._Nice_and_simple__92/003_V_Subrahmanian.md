The pdf says:

  

Based on the Bhumika of Polagam Sri Rama Sastri As explained by Dr. Mani Dravid Sastrigal (Translated by Sri S.N.Sastri) 

  

It is very likely that Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal explained this in a talk in Tamil in an assembly at Chennai a few years ago. This Bhumika, in Sanskrit, itself could be in a published book on Advaita, the title of which is not known to me rightnow.
