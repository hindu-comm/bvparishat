Namaste,

This is sangeeta, Ph.D. student at K.S.U.. Kindly let me know about a few Sanskrit journals bearing ISSN or ISBN numbers, where I can get my research paper published... Since we have to compulsorily get our paper published before submitting the thesis and the journal for which I had submitted is not being published for some reasons, I would like to know where I can get it published as soon as possible... Since expected completion of my thesis is November 2019, I will have to do it before that... Kindly do the needful...

Thanksand regards,

Sangeeta
