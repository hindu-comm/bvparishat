ખમ્મા મારા નન્દજીના લાલ મોરલી ... (खम्मा मारा नन्दजी ना लाल मोरली ...)

  

What does "khammaa" mean here? Is it a tadbhava of Sanskrit "kshama"? But kshama means forgiveness, patience etc. What meaning does the word convey in regard to the "laal" flute (morali) of Nanda ji? I believe "laal" is used in the sense of "dear" or "beautiful", not in the sense of color red.
