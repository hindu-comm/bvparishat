Like Hi, Hello, Jai Jinendra, Jai Shri Krishna, the ‘*Khamma Ghani*’ is a general greeting in the Rajasthani language said to have originated in the Mewar Empire in the early 8th century and widely used by Rajputs / Kshatriyas all over and Rajasthani people in particular, today.

[Pushpendra Singh Ranawat](https://www.quora.com/profile/Pushpendra-Singh-Ranawat),Geo-Heritage consultant and writer, notes that Rawal Kaalbhojaditya (काल्भोजदित्य, 735-753 AD), the first Guhilot king of Chittaudgadh, Mewad successfully repelled Arab invaders well west of Sindh. Kaalbhojaditya was bestowed the title of“Bappa Rawal”(likeMahatma Gandhi being called Bapu, the Father of Nation) for protecting the millennia-old Indian culture, from Muslim / Arab invaders.

Ranawat says, “Bappa Rawal’s successor Rawal Khumaan I (रावल खुमाण, 753-773 AD) successfully repulsed numerous Arab attacks on the western frontier of Greater India. This mission was valiantly continued by Rawal Khumaan II (828-853) who fought & won 24 major battles including an Abbasid Caliph army led by Al-Ma’mun in which he led a combined force of 40 Hindu Kings. His exploits are immortalized in “KHUMAAN RASO” (खुमाण रासो), the poetic chronicle preserved in writing for posterity by the 17th century Jain Muni, Acharya Dalpati Vijay. Likewise, Rawal Khumaan III (878-912) equally well protected the local culture.”

Ranawat continues with pride, “Bappa Rawal and the three Rawal “Khumaans” served the nation for over a century, following which Hindustan (India) witnessed a period of tranquillity & prosperity for over three hundred years, up to 1000 AD”

It is therefore, to honour Rawal ‘Khumaans’, that the salutation “Ghani-Ghani Khamma” meaning ‘Many-many Khumaans’, meaning, may we be blessed with many a Khumaans gained currency. Ghani Khamma, Khamma Ghani, Khumaana-ra-kunwar ne ghani khamma (खुमाण रा कुंवर ने घणी खम्मा), etc. started.

However, a very colloquial and ill-informed version of its interpretation is that the word “Khamma” literally originates from “kshama”, or forgiveness; and “Ghani” means “a lot”. Hence the greeting was solicited in advance for any offence or ill-feelings raised by the course of one’s words/actions.

Today, it has evolved to signify “many greetings” / “many blessings”, used very commonly as a “hello” or a “welcome”. Khamma Ghani is like hello in Rajasthani and is responded with Ghani Khamma and simply Khamma, if you are the elder person.

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
