Radhakrishna ji,

  

This is from my personal experience.

  

May be it is a Gujarati way to say Bless You !! I do not know the exact meaning of the word Khamma, but I tried to retrieve the meaning from English usage of word Bless You. 



Because when we sneeze mostly people say Bless you !When I wasa kid,my mother used say me Khamma whenever I sneezed. 

  

Secondly, in older days, we used to have ऊम्बर - threshold. So when crossing this threshold, sometime we hit the threshold, that gives little pain in toes, like "shuuuuu aaaaahhhhh" at that time also we say Khamma.

  

Thirdly, on Rakshabandhan when sister ties Rakhi to brother, sister takesदुखणा (Gujarati word) of her brother, and says Khamma maraa Veeraa.

  

Namaste

  

Yogendra
