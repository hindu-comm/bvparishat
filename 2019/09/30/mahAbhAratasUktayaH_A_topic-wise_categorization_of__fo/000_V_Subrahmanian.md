There is a very useful resource worked out of the Mahabharata corpus that groups verses under a number of topics:

  

<https://sa.wikiquote.org/s/14n>  

  

One can navigate from this page to the various main and sub groups and the interesting topics.

  

When was this work compiled and by whom?

  

We bow to those great men who have spent tremendous time and effort for thisproject.

  

warm regards
