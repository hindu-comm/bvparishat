Dear Paturiji,

  

Thank you for the feed back.

  

These five chitti vruttis are self serving and at the same time they are said to be क्लिष्ट अक्लिष्ट beneficial and otherwise. This aspect affords assessment from either side.

  

Further they are inter-related as they exist in the same moment. From this point of view when exposed to real situations the individual might express priority for any one of these.

  

I agree that research needs to be done yet it is my earnest request to members on this list to share their thoughts and ideas on the subject.

  

Let me be honest that this subject has just touched me.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
