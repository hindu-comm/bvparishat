Dear Achyutji,

What I suggested is exactly what you are saying. Please write up your observations through your work and

suggest how alternate methods could be applied. Through writing you can help sharpen your own ideas.

What kind of children, education or behavior, and then go into the alternate methods. Possibly you are  

a pioneer in the field. Please look into Piaget in France who studied child learning. You may possibly

extend his work in more technical manner. I spent considerable time in the '80s when we were thinking

how to introduce computers in education. The subject has a much larger need now.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
