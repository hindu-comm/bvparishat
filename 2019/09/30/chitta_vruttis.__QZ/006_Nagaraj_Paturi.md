\> Can we develop a system which uses the five chitta vruttis viz. pramana, viparyaya, vikalpa, smruti and nidra to assess child development?

  

------ This is a thinking in the line of evolving Vedic Psychology as a contemporary discipline. We are engaged in this at MIT School of Vedic Sciences.

  

We are coming to know that, several scholars of this inclination, independent of us, are trying to develop what are called as 'instruments' (questionnaires) for such assessments.

  

One of such instruments in contemporary Psychology is called Psychometric Test. It does not assess Development. It identifies Aptitude.

  

IQ tests are one kind of instruments for assessing Development.

  

Using Indic/Vedic concepts to develop such instruments is in its beginning stages.

  

Prof. Prasad Kaipa is one such scholar using Vedic concepts intensely in the field.

has two such assessment tests, of course not for child development but for adult aptitude.

  

He is not using Chitta Vrittis, but uses other Vedic concepts.

  

Example of how he uses Vedic concepts:
