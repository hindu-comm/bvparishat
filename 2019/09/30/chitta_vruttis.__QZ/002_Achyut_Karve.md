Dear Misraji,

  

I am working with children. I find that the present system of assessing children is largely based on the ability of the child to answer questions. This system is often misused through rote learning.  The above post intends to get feed back whether we can device an alternate system that is based on the above chitta vruttis as they are the basic functional units of interpretation of the material reality by humans.

  

If anyone on the forum has looked at the chitta vruttis in this way I would be happy to get feed back from them.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
