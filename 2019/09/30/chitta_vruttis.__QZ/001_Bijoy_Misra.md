Dear Achutji,

These kinds of open ended questions have the potential for the तर्क that was referred to in a previous thread.

In case you have dived through the topic, you should post your paper and knowledgeable people may comment.

My thinking is that we must try to foster educational content in our posts to maintain scholarship in the

forum. New theories should be welcome, but they need some cooking beforehand.

Best regards,

BM
