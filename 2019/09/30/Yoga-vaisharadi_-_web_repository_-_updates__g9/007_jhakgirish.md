Dear Dr Jayaraman,

Many thanks on behalf of me and Indology colleagues on the sacred occasion for liberally offering a great facility to us.I would like to know clearly in which manner we could utilise it.

सादरं प्रणमामि।

धन्या भवन्तः सुरवृन्दवाणीसेवाप्रसन्नाःक्षपयन्ति कालम्।

सम्भावयेsनेन पवित्रशास्त्रस्रोतांसि यास्यन्ति शुभां समृद्धिम्।।
