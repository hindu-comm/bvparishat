Dear Dr.Girish Jha ji

  

Thanks for the wishes. This resource will help researchers, students and teachers of Yogashastra for teaching, learning and research purposes. I hope this will also be useful to other indologists who would like to quote or refer to Yogasutra related literature in their own works.

  

It is also intended to serve as the reference resource of traditional viewpoints/perspective on Yogasutras, in the face of proliferation of so many current day interpretations both in the West and the East.  

  

regards  

jayaraman
