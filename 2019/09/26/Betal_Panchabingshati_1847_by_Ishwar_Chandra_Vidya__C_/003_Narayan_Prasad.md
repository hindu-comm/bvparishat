Shashi ji,

  No, the book I was looking for was published by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in Bengali in 1847. I gave the link of the site also providing such information.

  The purpose was to see his preface, if any, to know the history of publication of this book.

  Thanks and regards. Narayan Prasad.
