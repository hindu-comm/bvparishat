You are right, Professor Kannan, but there is another issue here.

There may not be thousands of publications, but there are still more than any single person can reasonably be expected to handle. Even an outstandingly dedicated person like Dr Narenthiran.

What we need is a top-down approach. Because there is no one-source database of what's published where, it's not only our problem as readers to locate potentially interesting papers. It's also the problem of these publications to make themselves known. BVP owners/mods and the advisory committee are well known scholars, so wouldn't the following make sense?

In another thread there was a request to help identify living and dead publications. Say this vetted list of journals is put into a spreadsheet and contact details of editors located and filled in. Then an email would go to that list from those in charge of BVP, explaining that BVP is already a valuable go-to resource and inviting the editors to join and post contents of their respective publications once the contents are approved for public release. A thread per journal, like Professor Deshpande's Krishna verses, seems a reasonable option. Maybe we can find volunteers from the list who would check against the spreadsheet whether all the submissions for the given journal have arrived in the given month/quarter/year. If something is missing, an email would be sent to that editor requesting the contents.

Once such a workflow is in place for current issues, we can address the question of back issues - again with the help of editors themselves. Note that in this format journal contents would be in searchable text form, which would increase their usefulness further.
