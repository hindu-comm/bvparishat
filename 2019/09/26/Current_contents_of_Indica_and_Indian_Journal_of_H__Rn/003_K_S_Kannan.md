I cannot more fully agree with you, Dr Irene.

  

Yes, systems that can take care of themselves should be created.

There is a need to generate robust and self-sufficient systems.

  

Systems ought not to be at the mercy of individuals; for,  

individuals can have problems/difficulties now and then.

  

Systems should be so designed, therefore, as to even have auto-corrective abilities.

Crowd-sourcing can minimize dependence on single/specific individuals,

as a B-team can always take charge when a (A-)team fails,

and a C-team when B fails.

  

In fact it is best to have a repository where these are stored in a systematic way.

The Excel-Sheet idea is an idea that excels:

easy for storage, easy for reference, easy for retrieval.

  

Such appurtenances enhance the quality and standard of the work;

nay, they can even inspire good work.

Duplication can be avoided,  

and duplicity can be voided.
