Namaste

  

There is a popular belief that Shankaracharya 'established' or 'propounded' six streams of worship: Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shaakta, GaaNapatya, Soura and Kaumaara. The nameShaNmata sthapanacharya occurs in the 108 names used to worship Shankaracharya. Apart from many hymns addressed to the deities stated above, attributed to Shankaracharya, is there any documented evidence, external to Advaita/Shankara following, to substantiate the above belief? I would like to know when was this epithet used for the first time, by whom, etc. Information of this would be helpful in better understanding the tradition.

  

There is also a belief that the panchayatana worship also was initiated by Shankaracharya. A friend recently told me that the Ashvalayana Gruhya Parishishta has provision for worship of multiple deities, the ones admitted as members of the panchayatana, but the term is not in the text. So, this is also a question that deserves research.

  

Thanks and warm regards
