Thank you Prof.Deshpande for finding my explanation to be convincing. There are several instances in Vedic texts where a little digression along the adhi-daiva approach as per the Nirukta leads to coherent meanings. Prof.Pandurangi in a previous post stressed the importance of understanding the 'intention' of the composer of RV 1.164 instead of just being satisfied with linguistic transpositions. Recognising the locus of action of many of the devatas to be in the visible sky may explain some of the riddles.

Regards

  

RN Iyengar
