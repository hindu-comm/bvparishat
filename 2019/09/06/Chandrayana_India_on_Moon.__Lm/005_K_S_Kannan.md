*Essays in Indo-Aryan Mythology*

by Bindiganavile Narayana Iyengar

pub 1901. Madras (Vol.s 1 & 2).

  

I remember to have sent by email a scanned copy of these 2 vol.s  

to Prof RNIyengar about 5 years ago,

(and again about 3 years ago when he could not trace it quickly).  

  

A very interesting work, no doubt.  

  

I have seen yet another work beautifully linking  

Rgvedic hymns to celestial phenomena.
