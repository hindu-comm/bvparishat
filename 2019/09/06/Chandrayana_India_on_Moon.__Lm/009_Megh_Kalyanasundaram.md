This addition resonated with at least me, Professor Paturi. :-) The number of people—those who identify themselves as संस्कृत scholars and who agree (inadvertently or after knowing partially/fully well, its implications for the spatial and temporal origins of earliest form of संस्कृत) with equations such as "R1a1 = PIE" ([Danino 2019:4](https://www.academia.edu/39780827/Methodological_issues_in_the_Indo-European_debate))—does not seem either small or of only non-Indian origin.  
  
Does it require a PhD either in genetics or in Indo-European linguistics (or both) to AT LEAST 'critically' wonder/be skeptical about the hypothesis (at best) of a haplogroup being causally-linked/generously-correlated—or as Danino has expressed more simply: "="—to a supposed language that is, in the words of an IE linguist (author of Cambridge-published textbook *Indo-European Linguistics An Introduction*(2007)) "an academic construct" (Clackson 2013:268), yet to be even attested and therefore, essentially "hypothetical" (Clackson 2013:267)?
