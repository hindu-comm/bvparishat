To what was in the previous note (and to which this note is a response), it might perhaps not be too impertinent at all to add a quick note, in order to bring to fore—lest it be either missed or forgotten—statements made in as recently as the second decade of the 21st century, by non-Indian authors John Goldsmith and Bernard Laks in *Language and Mind Sciences*, about "...emergence of Indo-European family...,"
"...European issues of identity..."and therefore, what can perhaps be seen not too unreasonably as, the sheer *hypocrisy* of 1) undermining a critical appraisal of the hypothetical PIE enterprise and 2) multi-disciplinary, scientifically verifiable pursuit about the truthof the spatial and temporal origin of earliest form ofसंस्कृत (amongst other things), with labels such as "cultural-ideological motivations," "nationalism" etc.

As for the label "Hindutva" being hurled, by some "academicians" as some sort of an academic appraisal, at scholars like Michel Danino, or at anyone critiquing the veracity of the underpinnings of (the unattested, hypothetical) PIE, its leap-of-FAITH-linkage to haplogroup, the so-called Aryan invasion/migration of India \[particularly in light of its dramatic consequence to the spatial and temporal origins ofसंस्कृत (amongst other things):"Whether posited as an invasion by or migration of Aryans, these variant forms—of an into-India hypothesis (supposed movement into India around the second millennium BCE)—are underpinned by one constant: the consequence that the earliest forms of Vedic culture and Sanskrit are not indigenous to India" (Sastry and Kalyanasundaram 2017)\],thankgoodness there is this piece*[Cry Hindutva: How Rhetoric Trumps Intellect in South Asian Studies](https://www.academia.edu/40082617/Cry_Hindutva_How_Rhetoric_Trumps_Intellect_in_South_Asian_Studies?email_work_card=title)*, albeit in another but not totally unrelated context (Indology), to refer to and emulate.

  

Best,
