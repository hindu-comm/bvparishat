Interestingly, the book was first brought to my attention by Sri KNIengar (K for Keshavram),

Prof. of Architecture, Bangalore University, and a very senior friend of mine.  

He was a master of calligraphy, and even his casual scribblings possessed a beauty  

that was unattainable to most people even with great efforts.

  

Incidentally, the chart of the *Caturdas'a-vidyA-sthAna*-s,  

recently re-published by our young and active scholar-friend Megh Kalyanasundaram  

(with some suggestions for improvement from Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam),

was designed and written by him on a very large sheet of paper,  

and he sent it to then Senior Pontiff of the Kanchi Matha.

  

He showed it to me just a week after, and I instinctively pointed out the diacritical errors

therein. This was easily about 40 years ago, and he said it was too late to rectify and redraw,  

also because of his other pressing work. (He passed away around a dozen years ago).  

  

The chart however has been freely in circulation over the internet,

and has even made its way into some books - attributed sometimes to the Kanchi Mutt

but more often without the mention of the real, or any, source.

  

He had one of the biggest collection of books on architecture in general,

and Indian architecture in particular - all purchased with a heavy price  

\- and towards the end of his life, he had to sell off the precious collection  

(for financial reasons unfortunately; and a good number of them made their way  

into the Siddaganga College of Technology, Tumkur, and elsewhere).
