Dear scholars,

Desire for space travel (internal and external) has existed in India since the most ancient times, as evidenced in the Vedas. What is happening now is, in a way, culmination of that aspiration. As a piece of Bhārata will be placed on Candra very soon it is appropriate to cite a hymn from Tai.Sam (Darśa-pūrṇamāsa) on the *dārśikī vedi*, which carries no Fire. Construction of this altar is described in the śulba sūtras, It looks like an hourglass figure imitating moon's position over a period oftime equal to 3339x2=6678 tithis=18years. The area of the Vedi is nearly 3339 sq.aṅgula. The number 3339 is patently Rgvedic (3rd maṇḍala and 10th maṇḍala) standing for the count of Viśvedevāh, who form a *Gaṇa* like the Maruts.



T.S. I.1. 9th *anuvāka* is about the preparation of the *vedi* or the DP altar with interesting aetiology. The legend of an *asura* named *Araru* and his shadow falling on earth is cited. The altar is enjoined to be dug for only four *aṅgula*, because a deeper altar belonged to the ancestors. *Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa* (III. 2.9) says **“if it is dug deeper ,that vedi belongs to the vedi of the ancestors.”**

What could be that self-law? The meaning of keeping Earth on Moon can only be referring to the shadow causing the Moon to be eclipsed. In any case the eclipse imagery is strong. This vedi is the replica of moon’s orbit mapped on earth after long observations. The DP-yāga is special in several ways. From the astronomical point of view, the DP altar holds an esoteric central role. The hymns used in the liturgy refer to the sky and there is always more than what meets the eye in Vedic rituals. In one place, the altar is said to be in the sky and protected in the north by Mitra and Varuṇa, with the invariable law.

Naturally this makes one wonder whether Mitra and Varuṇa, two of the most important Vedic deities could have been visible stars in the northern sky, with some special properties.*Dhruveṇa dharmaṇā* is traditionally interpreted as *invariable law.* But this could as well refer to two stars of that name. Such cryptic statements add an extra dimension to the astronomy of the Vedic times, since the practitioners did not limit themselves to physical observations but wished to attain a position in the sky. This mystical naturalism gets highlighted by the role of the Brahman, the presiding priest of the DP rite, who blesses the sacrificer silently
