Dear list,

  

I'm happy to say that there's been a lively stream on and off the list for various publications on a variety of topics. Through these exchanges I met a number of interesting and (much more importantly) lovely people already, with many more to come, I'm sure.

  

Still, there exist cases where I am not willing to locate/scan titles, and to save everyone time it's best to clarify this, as well as to explain how I prioritise requests. Please use the list below for easy reference:

  

**Highest priority:**

  

Vyakarana (in the widest sense of the word)  

Veda-related writings by traditional scholars

Computational linguistics matters related to Sanskrit, especially corpus linguistics (this can include mathematical papers and books)

Outstanding Indian and non-Indian Sanskrit scholarship  

Outsanding examples of modern Sanskrit writings (definitely including kavya)

Treatises on aesthetics/poetics/etc

  

**Medium priority:**

  

Specialised requests that might be of interest to very few people

Remarkable but hard to find books which don't fall into the above categories

  

**Zero priority, aka straight to the bin:**

  

Works propounding all sorts of political and other divisive, degrading and otherwise excluding ideologies (this includes works on feminism, gender studies and suchlike)  

Requests of the type 'here's a 50 item list, what can you find from here'  

  

Obviously, it's not possible to list every eventuality. If in doubt, please ask via private message.  

  

Thank you for your understanding. Life's short, so let's dig into our memories and focus on the real jewels.  

  

Irene
