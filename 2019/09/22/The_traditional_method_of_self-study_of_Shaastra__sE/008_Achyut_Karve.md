Dear Vidwans,

  

Swadhyaya is an essential part of growth in the absence of which parrots are born who through time lose touch with the environment which is continuously movingforward. Development is only possible when a student has completed his education under an able guru and thereafter engages himself in swadhyaya which takes him to greater heights.

  

What happens in the absence of swadhyaya? Here is a quote from Marx's Theses on Fauerbauch.

  

"The materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances and upbringing forgets that circumstances are changed by men and that it is essential to educate the educator himself. This doctrine must, therefore, divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society.

  

The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-changing can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice."
