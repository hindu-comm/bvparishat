Namaste,

  

Even if one has learned Sanskrit, self study, that is , without the help of a 'shrotriya brahmnishta' is abhorred. 'Mimmasa' is the special science of studying the Vedas. Often the words used in the context will have a meaning only a Guru in the 'sampRadaaya' will know.

  

Mundaka Upanishad 1.2.12 is clear about this. Firstly live life well, and know the futility of pursuing worldly things. Then when onewill look for someone who will teach him about a defectless goal.That Guru will be not only well versed in the 'shaastRas' but also a 'brahmanishta'. Who knows what he speaks. One who walks the talk.

  

Regards

  

Balagopal
