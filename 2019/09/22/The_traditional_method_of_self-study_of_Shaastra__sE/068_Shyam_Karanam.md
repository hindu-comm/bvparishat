Thief is a very very modest description of Eklavya.  

  

Eklavya was a dacoit/tribe who fought Lord Krishna for 18 times along with Jarasandha. He invoked evil forces in the idol of Dronacharya to learn skills. Evil forces cease to work for an angahina and hence Dronacharya asked for his thumb. It makes little sense why someone would not be able to shoot arrows without thumb. Skilled Archer can shoot with legs as well.

  

More on it

Shyam
