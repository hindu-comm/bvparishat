*प्रापती*ति

has a variant reading viz.

प्रापद्-इति.

  

But I somehow prefer the first one.

The Present Tense is not unoften used in the sense of  

what is universally/perpetually true.  

  

In the Vedic, the Past is often symbolic of the Future also.  

Comparable to - if it happened then, it can happen now too.

Cf. What man has done, man can do.  

पूर्वेभिर् ऋषिभिर्...नूतनैर् उत : Grounds for optimism.  

Philosophically, what is *siddha* once was *sAdhya*.  

The *कृत्* has an inheritance of the properties of *तिङ्*.
