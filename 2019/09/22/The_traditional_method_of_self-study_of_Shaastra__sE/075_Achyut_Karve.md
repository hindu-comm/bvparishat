Dear Vidwans,

  

Now-a-days anything that is written nay anything that apprears in the virtual world is considered to be real.  

  

 Basic texts are the only ones which can guide us. As long as the tradition was oral garbage was seived at each level. With the advent of printing it is the partisan rubbish that is gaining ground. With digitalization the garbage has not only polluted the environment but over shadowed it so much so that that the sun has itself disappeared from the skies. People just face the horizon and pray.  

  

First hand is not only from the horses mouth but also from an unblemished eye. The wheel needs to be reinvented by each generation else the kernel will be lost.  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
