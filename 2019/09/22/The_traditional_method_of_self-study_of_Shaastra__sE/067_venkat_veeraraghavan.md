Dear Shri Sastry ji-

  

Firstly, the authenticity of the many of the statements attributed to Drona wrt Arjuna are contestable. Generally speaking Vyasa's version is regarded as authenticfor the MB just as Valmiki's version and not Kamban or Tulsidas' versions are regarded as authentic wrt Ramayana.

  

Recently a few Potterheads queried JK Rowling about certain characters and the author was pretty adamant about her way and encouraged the enthusiasts to write their own fantasy if they sodesired.

Inspired by the original epics many have written their own MB like Sarala and certain Tamil versions where Karna has been championed.

  

These cannot be considered authentic or authoritative by any count except as an extension of an author's fantasy.

Skillwise there are a few characters in the MB that seem to supercede Arjuna, however the fact remains that Arjuna himself seemed quite incomparable on his own the way his life panned out.

If any Arjuna is blessed with an even more pristine charitra than most others. He went on vanavasa for twelve years longer and was on digvijaya for longer than any of the Pandavas.

All this life experience showed itself in the Virata war, where he proved himself peerless against an array lead by Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwatthama and Kripa among others. He defeated all these singly and then together.

  

Yes. I agree that the purpose for which one learns is paramount. The purpose in Arjuna's case was Kshatriya Dharma and not sheer vanity (as in Karna's case) or intense intellectual curiosity as in the case of Ekalavya.

Firstly Ekalavya was aligned with Magadha who were enemies of the state of hastinapura which was providing support to Drona and secondly, he learnt through stealth without Drona's knowledge.

This left Drona with no option other than to ask for his thumb.

  

Arjuna never humiliated his opponents as Karna was wont to do and he spared whoever (Maya, Angaraparna etc) asked for refuge. He did not make friendships with people who were opposed to Dharma as Karna and Ekalavya did.

There is an extensive list of Sishupala's misdeeds (including rape) in the episode of the Rajasuya and Ekalavya was this man's ally.

  

When a person tries to use a sublime art to pervert dharma they need to be put down with whatever means at hand. To see such a stratagem in isolation and dub it as adharma or koota-nithi is to miss the whole point of dharma.

The point of dharma is lokakalyana and not self aggrandizement as being called the "world's foremost archer" etc.

The final nail in the coffin of all Arjuna-baiters online and in print is that Krishna chose him for His friend and disciple for his pAtrata and his guNas.

That is enough endorsement for me.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
