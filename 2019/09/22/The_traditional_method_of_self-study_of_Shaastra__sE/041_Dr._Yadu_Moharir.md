Namaskar scholars.,

  

I think there are always exceptions to rules, I think एकलव्य needs to be classified as having practiced **"स्वाध्याय"**. Kindly educate me if there is better term to classify him under.

The issue of स्वाध्याय as interpreted as traditional method of self study has come to an end by the post of Prof. Korada as the final as usual. I had expected it long ago.

  

Thanks is the lword we can say.
