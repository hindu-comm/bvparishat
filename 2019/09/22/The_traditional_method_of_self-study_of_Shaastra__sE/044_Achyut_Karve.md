Dear Vidwans,

  

Can anybody be taught? One can only guide. A student has been endowed with the ability to learn by nature. It is this ability that a guru makes use of for the upliftment of the student.

  

Eklavya gave away his thumb after he had achieved what he dreamt of and which he had achieved through tapa. On theother hand what was in store for Drona in the Mahabharata War also needs to be looked at.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
