Namaste

  

I remember one example given by Sri Sringeri Swamiji. One man was trying to learn to make Dosa. He was learning from a book. The book said first heat the iron pan on stove for 5 mins till it becomes hot. Then apply oil on it. He followed it. He heated the pan and then tried to apply oil with fingers. His fingers got burnt. This is why we need Guru to teach us. Because there will invariably be gaps in bookish knowledge.
