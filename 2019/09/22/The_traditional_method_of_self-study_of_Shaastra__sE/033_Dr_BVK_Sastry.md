Namaste Bhat ji



(1) What I am seeing is a conceptual understanding, association of practices, instructions and technical discipline specific definitions. I seem to be missing the ' samaasa' construction of 'स्वाध्याय' . All this would not be necessary if the entire term ' 'स्वाध्याय ' is taken as a single unit. 



Definition is user provided in a discipline specific context ( = paribhashaa). Derivation is based on process- ( Vyaakarana- pada - prakriyaa).



(2) How would one proceed to break the samaasa of 'स्वाध्याय ?

One may split the units for convenience as 

(1) स्व + अध्याय = स्व -अधि- (आ) -अय (न) where the ' literal, lexical meaning of the units सु-अधि-अय \[Two upasargas and one dhaatu\] /अय (न) \[ derivative of dhaatu\] need to be explained.



 For argument sake, when one 'sees / hears ' a ' second hidden ' (आ) ' , the explanation of the term becomes more expansive, inclusive and unifies all the concepts, associated practices and technicalities of practice. Here स्वाध्याय would be सु + (आ) -अधि - (आ) - अय / अयन. OR
स्व + (आ) -अधि - (आ) - अय / अयन. What would be the meaning associations for the unit ' स्व ' ?? This need to be elaborated.
