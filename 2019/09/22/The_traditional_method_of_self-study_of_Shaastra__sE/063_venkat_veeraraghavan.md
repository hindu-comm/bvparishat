DearShri Achyut ji

  

As Dr. Kannan pointed out, your language is not precise. It is hard to figure out what you mean.

What do you mean by "emulate"?

The literalmeaning is to imitate / to match or surpass.

  

You write: " If the person is a याचक the idol is just a निमित्त."

What makes you think there is no yAchana involved in learning?

Unless there is a feeling and acknowledgement of ignorance /lack thereof one cannot make a sankalpa to learn. A dry soil draws water and a thirsty student pulls in knowledge. Where to pour water and where to with-hold is the discretion of the Gardener.

So is the Guru a nimitta too?

  

You seem to have a rather narrow view of the role of a Guru somewhere in line with the modern fetish of "following your bliss" and "you are your own Guru" etc.

Unfortunately these abominations have sprouted mostly scandals and not even a yogabrashta of the caliber of half an ekalavya.   

You say Ekalavya achieved through tapa?

What is your definition of tapa?

  

What was in store for Drona in the MB war?

Vyasa in the MB clearly states that 5 people saw where Drona went after death, one of whom was Krishna Himself. Apart from the fact that he was forced to fight for Duryodhana as recompense for having received patronage from Hastinapura what exactly do you think went wrong for Drona?

  

Dharma is very subtle and cannot be decided without knowing the pAtra / vessel..

While a person with a normal agni can consume a fried vada without illeffects, a person suffering from jvara or mandha agni cannot consume the same vada without serious consequences.

The species is the same, but the internal dynamics are different.

The difference is astronomical when the pAtra being considered is a Yogi like Bhishma or Drona.

  

What works for a man/woman of power will not work for the common folk and even less so for the indigent.

There is a statement to that effect when Kunti confesses her regret and paschattapa at having abandoned Karna. Vyasa replies somewhere along the lines of "for people endued with shakti all actions become worthy and align with dharma" ...

  

Going back to the root of this discussion

As Dr. Kannan pointed out, Ekalavya's case was not one of svadhyaya but that of theft pure and simple.

Now there are many thieves who are extremely skilfull, but from the POV of dharma they are just that adharmis and bhrashta.

Their skill level is merely a qualifier. A skilled thief maybe but a thief nonetheless.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
