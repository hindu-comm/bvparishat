Namaste,

  

The 'swaadhyaaya' mentioned in BG 17.5 (anudvekakaram..) is 'self study' of the scriptures (for 'atma jnaanam' etc) or of the 'recitation' of the vedic mantRas only?

  

Contextually it must be the recitation as it is said as the austerity of speech (vachikam, kaRmedriyam). Because the study of the 'SELF' per se involves overall austerities aka 'sadhana chatushtaya shatka samppanna' ('jnaanam' is of the mind, 'jnAnedriyam).

  

Regards

  

Balagopal
