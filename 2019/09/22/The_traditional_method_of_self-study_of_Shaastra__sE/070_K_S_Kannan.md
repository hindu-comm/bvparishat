Doesn't the same Nirukta say: VidyA says:  

गोपाय मां शेवधि ष्टेऽहमस्मि ।

**न अनृजवे शठाय/अयताय ?**

**  
**

Kailasam may have had "his own Purpose" in wrting his play;

but his wit, howsoever extraordinary, can be no substitute for VyAsa's wisdom.

(Cf. "Of what is the sophist so eloquent?" - interrogated Socrates.  

Sophistry is the last resort of the bruised ego that turns a blind eye to equity.)

  

You are welcome to quote Kailasam when Kailasam is being reviewed.

  

You get a dime a dozen modern plays portraying a "rebellious" Sita,

which only dubious critics invoke while discussing Valmiki.

  

Create your own stories and plots by all means,  

why disfigure and distort the time-honoured ones to suit your fancies?

  

It is against (pro)posing this kind of *tarka* as *Rs"i*  

that the *upanis"ad* warned - prior to the *nirukta*:

नैषा तर्केण मतिरापनेया \|
