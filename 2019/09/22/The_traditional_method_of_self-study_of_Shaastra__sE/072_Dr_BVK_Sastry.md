Namaste



1. Yes, Nirukta says \< Doesn't the same Nirukta say: VidyA says: गोपाय मां शेवधि ष्टेऽहमस्मि । न अनृजवे शठाय/अयताय ? > : Question: Why was this directive vioalted and tolerated and continued to be violated with an anchor reference from 17th century ?



2. The same Nirukta, as Vednaga asked and pointed the path to become a Rushi. Why is it despised ?



3. Just as we are deliberating MBH characters, our peers of past also debated the ancinet text; and came out with wonderful works like Uru-Bhanga, Veni -samhara, Baala-Bharata, ... Ashwatthaman, Yayaati.....et al. We continue that tradition ' yaTha te tatra varteran, tathA tatra varteThAH'. Do we say Bhasha disfigured Mahabahrata or ramayana ??



4. Yes \< that the upanis"ad warned - prior to the nirukta: नैषा तर्केण मतिरापनेया \| > ; We also have the directive ' TapasA BRAHMA vijijnAsasva'. Tattu samanvayAt'. And this is way before Nirukta! and Brahma Sutra . Shruti stands as a higher authority. So we do continue to deliberate.
