Namaste



1. Before responding to your post below, let me assure you that I am as much an insider of the tradition, aware of the issues and having deep interest in the service of 'Dharma'. But that does not mean turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to irregular text constructions and preferential construction of views and locking oneself to a ' bi-partisan group mode of ' with us ( to sing our song) or on other side (as an enemy)'. Sorry, that is not good academics or path of Dharma.



 If we need Mahabharata of Vyasa in its essence let us get to Tatparya Nirnaya. If we want the Text of past, go for Critical edition, manuscript search et al. If we want popular faith-belief assurance preaching to own crowd for claps, go for fancy stories weave and entertainment media.



 **The PURPOSE guides the FORMAT as PREACHING or TEACHING. **

****

 The response on Ekalavya becomes relevant when ' Characters of Mahabharata' are taken as ' History - Land- Characters of Communities in the Varna Ashrama frame work'.



One view of tradition holds that all characters of MBH are gods and demi-gods, which pushes out all debate of ethics in one shot ! out of such deliberations. 

Now, who made these Gods/ demi-gods/ demons to human level' Or ' elevated humans to Gods/ demi-gods/ demons mode' is not easy to
answer.

Both models being present in the text, there are adherents for both views, as suits their convenience.



 The \< social media responses> reading : \< Eklavya was a dacoit/tribe who fought Lord Krishna for 18 times along with Jarasandha. He invoked evil forces in the idol of Dronacharya to learn skills. Evil forces cease to work for an angahina and hence Dronacharya asked for his thumb. It makes little sense why someone would not be able to shoot arrows without thumb. Skilled Archer can shoot with legs as well. \>
are emotionally satisfying, but empty containers to explain anything of essence ! It is because of such explanations, the tag ' mythology' is attached to many such explanations. Was Dronacharya also a schemer ? Was there a ' Magical technology' known for Ekalavya for no-physical presence learning ? If skilled archers can shoot with legs as well, there are instances where the grass turns to an intelligent weapon by use of ' Mantra' to hunt out the ' crow which goes round the world, for hurting the wife of Sri Rama; and ultimately this becomes an explanation for ' one eye view of all crows' ?? If one part of the text is authority, what happens to the rest of the text? Is it ' Half -Egg ' logic ??

When tradition teachers say these things as ' intelligent explanation of past glory', the current curios ask 'Why we are not able to get these skills' ? The answer cannot go round to the mumbo jumbo of mantra sounds, years of tapas, guru-blessing, magical muhurtha.... . Todays seekers dismiss it as ' myhtology' or ' photoshop ... or Harry Potter'! .... X-men ... starwars ... you know the rest'. The introspection needs to begin :Why are given all this ? and how is it going to enrich the quality of life ? for us ? for the next generation.





2. In all this discussion, we get so obsessed with the 'Text of Maharshi Vyaysa' and its ' sacrosanct authority' of interpretation in a specific model, excluding other modes of thinking. going to the details of this analysis would be good exercise as a 'closed door exercise only'. That will not be for public display or consumption. Just because something is written in Sanskrit, it does not mean it is ancient. The follow up question would be : Have we understood what is SAMSKRUTHAM, as it has passed through a hoary past of millennia through the seers -sages -narrators- Acahryas - Shaastrakaaras and filtered through the linguists, indologists, Genetic imprint of language advocates...... ?? Yes, there are questions. What we seem to have a number of keys for a number of locks , but do not know which key is for which lock ?? The UNLOCKING CODE. The code available with Panini-Patanjali- Yaska is sidelined and Biblical Tower of Babel is being tried out by many in such debates. Would that work ?? 



I have seen such debates and been a part of many, where emotions take over the logic and sanity of participators intellect'. Here is the
classic case of this instance , where MBH characters of Karna, Ekalavya and many others get in to a social frame for debate. These debates get emotional flare and ' look back at Maharshi Vyasa's work with a backward looking History lens starting at 20th century. 



3. **What constitutes Vyasa's version of Mahabharata was even doubted by 14th century, when Acharya Madwa took to the direction of** **' Taatparya - Nirnaya' instead of ' Text Nirnaya' .** When Acharya Madhwa spoke of ' Bharata' along with ' Moola Ramayana, Pancharatra, and Four Vedas' as Shaastra with common purpose, the new model of MBH understanding had already been framed. So whatever we are looking now, at current time, as ' Maharshi Vyasa's version of MBH, at one lakh verses or pan-indian text, or critical edition, is already farther removed from the original narrative; **and has a formatted alignment of PURPOSE AND PRACTICE** . How much additions from what time, by whom is not the issue.



Disconnecting land history using the ' elevated plane of ' Vedanta' to understand MBH is not solution here. Vishwa Adluri's work is great; but it also has to explain the land-history of Bharat in relation to MBH. The current cultural frame of understanding MBH is already smeared with all these flavors and thoughts from many thinkers of past centuries. Ekalavya's story interpretation is one such case. If we are discussing now Ekalavya, there will be discussions on Ghatotkacha in the coming days, as son of Bhima !



4. For a traditional believer, the historicity of Sri Krishna or Arjuna is a non-issue. Yuga cycle is far bigger than 4000 years history. Gita is the essence of Upanishads; The Sri Krishna - Arjuna pair is Nara-Narayana Yogi's. That is accepted by Three Acharya's. That is good enough for me. For an academic scholar, indologist, linguist, anthropologist this is not enough, nay distracting.



**5. For a traditional believer, the PURPOSE is to be aligned with the PRACTICE. This is the key point of VINIYOGA, where ' YOGA is inbuilt condition. **

****

 The 18 days of kurukshetra war was strategized by Sri Krishna and that is enough to undermine all human arguments of unethical issues
from a human lens in the war.



 As you note, \< The point of dharma is lokakalyana and not self aggrandizement \> . Let us steer the debate in that direction.
