The term 'svaadhyaya', as I have understood, is the study in the manner prescribed, of one's own shaakhaa of the Veda. The 'sva' refers to that aspect. The shAkhA is the one his father studied, and the one his father's father studied, and so on. It is not, as far as I have heard, any self-study. In the case of Yoga, I have read, it is the study of texts relating to adhyatma, spirituality, and also japa. I have not heard the meaning 'self-study' (without the help of a teacher) to be the meaning of the term 'svaadhyaya.'
