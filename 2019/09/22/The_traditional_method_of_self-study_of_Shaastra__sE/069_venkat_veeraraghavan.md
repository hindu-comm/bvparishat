I'd like to add that there are parallels in Ekalavya's journey with that of Kacha the son of Brihaspati. How did Ekalavya end up near Drona's ashrama unless he was sent with a specific purpose as Kacha was?  

  

Even though kacha was ostensibly on the side of the Devas (the good guys) what he did was Guru Droha pure and simple when he used the innocent Devayani in trying to curry favour with Shukra. Ultimately the episode ended with a few mutual curses that negated the entire enterprise.

This shows that the purpose with which one approaches knowledge has to be pure. This only puts to mind Castaneda's words:

"A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war: wide-awake, with fear, with respect, and with absolute assurance"
