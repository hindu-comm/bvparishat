It is considered a deviation and a distortion  

to add a new meaning to a well-known word  

having a well-established sense - a technical sense, especially,  

even if there could be some support/hint drawn  

from the way the word could be derived.  

  

You cannot invent a new meaning for the word *research  
*

and say *research* means "searching for something once again"  

\- simply on the grounds that *re-* can mean "again";  

or that "to *remember"* is "to re-member something that has lost its member".  

  

Such attempts can only be described as wild fancies.

No lexicographer takes a fancy for such figments of imagination  

and include it in the dictionary. It is only those who do not know  

even the elements of lexicography that will indulge in such fantastic acrobatics.  

Much sound and fury, but no sense.  

  

Rather than all this child's play, and waste of time for the members of the list,

please try create a new word which can possibly reflect your idea more transparently.

  

यः वाचम् स्तेनयेत् सः सर्व-स्तेय-कृत् ।
