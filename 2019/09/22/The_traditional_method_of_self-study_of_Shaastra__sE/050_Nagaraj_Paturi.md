This reminds the other recent thread on Yogyataa. The word Yogyataa was misunderstood under the influence of its use in contemporary Indian language borrowings. The s'aastriya technical sense of the word was ignored.

  

Same thing here. The word Swaadhyaaya is being taken in a svakapolakalpita etymological sense ignoring the rooDhaartha in which it is used.

  

Ekalavya's skill-learning method is not svaadhyaaya. Period.
