I think Yavakrida was the tapasvi who tried to learn the Vedas by sheer tapasya alone.

Indra however clearly told him that a teacher was essential for this.

  

The story appears in the Tirtha-yatra parva where the sage Lomasa tells this story to Dharma-raja Yudhisthira.

  

Tapasya in this context however would not count as "self-study"...

  

Yavakrida in the story obtains what he wanted despite Indra's repeated warnings and this results in overweaning pride that results in his own destruction.
