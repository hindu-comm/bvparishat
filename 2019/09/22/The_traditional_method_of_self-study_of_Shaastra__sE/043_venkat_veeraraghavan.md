Ekalavya would come under the paradigm of mityachara for which he was punished.  

This might be controversial but my 2 cents:

Any relationship needs a 2 way acceptance.

This is no different in the case of Guru-Sishya.

Ekalavya in my opinion was probably a Yogabrashta (I wonder if there is a source for this) which was the only way he could have picked up the subtle aspects of Dhanurveda.

I think he worshipped the statue of Drona with such success (not possible without prior Yogasiddhi) that he tapped into Drona's wavelength whichamounted to stealing Drona's Shakti without permission.

  

This was not a case of svadhyaya.
