Respected scholars ,

         I feel the procedure of self study was there in the purani texts also.

Although the system to be on guru shishya mode only but some instances shows us that self study is also a possible one .

         The lord Krishna's words to uddhavaji about his gurus in nature also helps this discussion.

  

        The sadhana can be done for self but not the scriptures here.

 The story which was in purana helps this that the education or the vidya are to be studied under a guru only. These are the words of INDRA to a tapaswi. I don't know the exact name and the part where it waswritten in mahabharat but it was in mahabharat only.

  

     If any mistake from me scholars are requested to forgive me for the mistake.

   Thank you.
