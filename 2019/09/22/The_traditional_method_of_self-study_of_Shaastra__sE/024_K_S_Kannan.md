I just recollected *vitarati guruH* verse given by Prof. Deshpande,  

but was answering another mail.

  

Nobody is born as a clean slate, and therefore,  

rather than the analogy of the pot and the potter,

that of the plant and the gardener may be more apposite

in the case of the student and the teacher.

  

The word *kindergarten* that way is somewhat more reflective of the real situation.

That is not to imply by any means that the current kindergarten schooling is being recommended.

  

No *s'oka* if vidyA is imparted to *su-s'is"ya*

\- is what Kalidasa clearly declares.
