Dear Karve-ji

  

You make a lot of sense. I quote a proverb which goes like

  

“You can take a donkey to the river but you can not make it drink the water.”

  

I agree with you that one has to learn by oneself. Of course it becomes easier to learn by the guidance of a teacher. The guru becomes indispensable when he is the only source of the knowledge.

  

The guru also has every right not to accept any one  as a student.

  

What I find not defensible is when a guru favors one of his disciple over another.

  

Society benefits when each member rises to the potential he/she is born with to raise the bar of knowledge to a higher level.

  

It may be of interest to learn what the Buddha avatar of Vishnu revealed after the advent of Rama and Krishna avatars of Vishnu.

  

Will be of interest to know the specific and unique teachings of Buddha. That of course belongs to a new thread.

  

Best wishes

Deva
