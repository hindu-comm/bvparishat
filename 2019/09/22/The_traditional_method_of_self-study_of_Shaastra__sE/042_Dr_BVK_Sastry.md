Namaste Bhat ji



Now that you have brought in the Kashika reference, and endorsed ' आ in between' and explained 'Swaadhyaaya' , and we have already touched on Gita, let me push the deliberation a little further !



The subject line is ' Traditional Method of Self-Study of Shaastra'.
The study of ' Veda' has been a default theme in this discussion. 



Guidance for study of 'Veda ( as Mantra- Brahmana) and its Viniyoga is an integral part of the ' Six Vedanga's. I push this in to the domain of discussions in Yaska's Nirukta. Some others may push this to the rest of the vedanga disciplines and upavedas also !



**Nirukta and Pratishaakhya has clear position on the ' The traditional method of self-study of Shaastra' - with specific focus on ' Understanding before Use'.**



In other words, the traditional method of self -study of (veda and related) Shaastra's has a prescribed guidance. More specifically Nirukta, which sets the need to understand the multilane- multilayer
meaning, which can be understood only through the help of ' Acharya'.
Ref: Nirukta- uttara-shatka- Daivata kaanda.I am specifically referring to the observation in parishishta (12) :

**मनुष्या वा ऋषिषूत्क्रामत्सु देवान् अब्रुवन्- को न ऋषिर्भविष्यतीति ? **

**तेभ्य एतं तर्कं ऋषिं प्रायच्छन् - मन्त्रार्थ - चिन्ताऽऽभ्यूहमभ्यूह्ळम् - तस्माद्यदेव किंचानूचानोऽभ्यूह्त्यार्षं तद्भवति \|**



Could you please expand on this and connect this to explanation from Kashikaa tradition ?



Regards

BVK Sastry
