Namaste



On \<Ekalavya's case was not one of svadhyaya but that of theft pure and simple.> 



1. Ekalavya's study and skill acquisition was ' tapas' where ' single pointed devotion to the master of a discipline, with a purpose to be achieved ' was the path followed by him 

to success. \< \< एकः तपः\> Tapas is followed as an individual excellence initiative.

The physical 'guru' may not bless and teach'; but the ' knowledge in the universe' becomes accessible to such seeker with seriousness and purpose. 

Poets call this as ' Pratibhaa', anugraha by the Goddess of muse.

 Even in such a case, trying circumstances, the students acknowledgement and respect for 'Guru' is what distinguishes 'theft' tag from ' tapas'. 

The factor of 'EGO' and Jealousy are to be carefully analyzed.



 May be one should take a look at the playlet by T.P.Kailasam ( in english) by the title: **Purpose**, which deals with the story of Ekalavya.

(Purpose **(= SAMKALPA- VINIYOGA**) is deeply connected with utility application and Public good).



 The playlet is available at the link: <https://tpkailasam.blogspot.com/2011/11/purpose.html> .



 Why 'Ekalavya' does not fit in to the 'stena' model can be seen in Kailasam's play. The following excerpts from the playlet below is worth contemplating.





**Ekalavya**: A PUPIL CAN LEARN MORE FROM HIS GURU THAN WHAT THE GURU HIMSELF KNOWS IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PUPIL FOR LEARNING IS NOBLER THAN WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE GURU'S WAS WHEN HE LEARNT FROM HIS GURU!!

////



**Drona**: You do not know all, Little Man! It is not only Love and respect for the Guru that counts... but the PURPOSE... the MAIN PURPOSE with which the pupil learns, DECIDES HOW MUCH HE learns! You have said it yourself a while ago. With his purpose for learning... far beneath yours,... all his efforts and mine to help him even to EQUAL you, will not avail!!



**Ekalavya**: What then... has been...his (= Arjuna's) purp...?



**Drona**: **(Looking away) His (= Arjuna's) purpose from the very outset has been to acquire personal fame as an archer! To be acclaimed the greatest archer of all times! And with you (= Ekalvya) working body and soul, heart and mind... to free harmless creatures from fear of marauding beasts... the hardest of his efforts will not land him within yojanaas of your archery!! And I shall never keep the promise I rashly made!**



2. There is also another floating story of Ekalavya, having further achieved skills of archery, without the use of thumb.

It is said that ekalvya wanted to serve and be on the side of Drona in the mahabharata war. Krishna is said to have anticipated this as added strength to Duryodhana and counters it in a circuitous way.
While the authenticity of story may be questioned, like many other floating stories around many characters of Mahabharata, the fact that indian society had keen interest in mahabharata related anectodes and more specifically on Ekalavya is to be noted. None of these stories have attached the tag of 'stena' - Thief to ekalavya. There are popular stories pan-indian nature on son of Ghatotkacha, son of Arjna ( babhruvahana) et al which run with similar cross cultural debate.



**3. What would be a better term to qualify ' Ekalavya' ?** **Who then is a 'stena' ?** - Ekalavya was a ' Siddhi-Kaama' without need for ' Prasiddhi- Prashasti- Prabhaava', in the interpretation of ' PURPOSE', by Kailasam. :: This is what emulation means in case of ekalavya. 



 **A 'Thief' tag, according to tradition, goes in all cases where one can see any one or more of the following**:



(i) failure to fulfill the purpose of the knowledge received by him/her through the teacher- tradition. (Shaastra- Prayojana/ viniyoga).



 (ii) learner deserts the goal of knowledge and limits its use for self-gratification .( Gita: 3-12: tair dattan apradayaibhyo , yo bhunkte stena eva sah ). ( A-Shishya -pradaana)



 (iii) The guts to raise and fight even at the stake of 'ones own life' for the cause of ' Establishing Dharma - Down sizing Adharma'; because one loves personal safety and money

more than the ' PURPOSE'. These are soft-thief's who are best in making historical analysis and offer suggestions. ( Dharma- pravachanakaara).



 One of my friend gives an analogy for this : There are many people who want to play the role of ' judge' ! But there are no good lawyers who strive to make the right case

and argue it out for getting the right judgment and implement.
These 'soft-thief's want to teach 'swimming without ever making the learner get 'wet' with the water in

the pool. In sports parlance, these are called ' armchair commentators and umpiring- critics, watching the re-play of the game, who don't / wont step on to the game field

and kick the balls'.



 (iv) The person / institution failing to make the knowledge tradition serve the social and spiritual wellness , the person / institution failing to ensure the access of knowledge traditions to empower every member of community to 'EMULATE' the excellence standards set by the knowledge discipline, the interpretations and interpreters -gate keepers who block the delivery of public good of sacred traditions (Sanatana Dharma for Purushartha of Prajaa- Rashtram)
are the real ' Thieves'. (Dharma-Samsthaa without working for Dharma-Samsthaapanaa).



 One can explore Nirukta - daivata kanda for more details on this point, as a discussion on the following point :

 **मनुष्या वा ऋषिषूत्क्रामत्सु देवान् अब्रुवन्- को न ऋषिर्भविष्यतीति ? **

** तेभ्य एतं तर्कं ऋषिं प्रायच्छन् - मन्त्रार्थ - चिन्ताऽऽभ्यूहमभ्यूह्ळम् - तस्माद्यदेव किंचानूचानोऽभ्यूह्त्यार्षं तद्भवति \|**



The term 'emulate' should be not be picked up for a limited meaning of choice. Ref: URL:- <https://www.thefreedictionary.com/emulate> ::

**emulate : to strive to equal or excel; to vie with successfully. **

This is different from 'theft' : One who commits the act or crime of theft.; a person who steals something from another; a person who steals, esp. secretly.

Not to be confused with: imitate – to copy the actions, appearance, or mannerisms of another; ape, mimic, mock, parody ( as self-study enthusiasts take an exit path to free resources ! Where learning is without responsibility for teacher, accountability to the discipline and commitment for purpose , and audit to mark the level of
achievement)

1. To strive to equal or excel, especially through imitation: an older pupil whose accomplishments and style I emulated.

2. To compete with successfully; approach or attain equality with.

3. Computers To imitate the function of (another system), as by modifications to hardware or software that allow the imitating system to accept the same data, execute the same programs, and achieve the same results as the imitated system.
