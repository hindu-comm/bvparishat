With respect to what Prof. Kannan described, quite charitably, as "wild fancy", it actually needs to be condemned in stronger words. It is violence to the most useful tool of humanity, language, and anti-social.

  

One of the key reasons for development of human beings, why they are superior to animals, is language. But language itself is based on a common pact - called samaya in Sanskrit - that such and such word denotes such and such meaning. Disturbing this underlying compact is beyond irresponsibility - it is anti-social behaviour.
