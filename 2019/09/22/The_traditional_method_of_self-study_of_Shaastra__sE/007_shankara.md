Namaste,

  

On a lighter note - If it is possible to study the sastras by oneself without a teacher, it would not be necessary to post this query here.

  

Someone once asked Swami Chinmayananda: "Swamiji, whatever you teach is there in the books. What do I need a Guru for?"  

Swami Chinmayananda: “Why don’t you ask this question to the books? The very fact that you are asking these questions clearly shows that we need teachers to teach us."  

  

regards  
shankara
