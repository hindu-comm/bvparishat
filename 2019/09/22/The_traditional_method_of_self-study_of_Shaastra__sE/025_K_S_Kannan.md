मृदां चयः

is the *pATha* I have come across

(in lieu of the last word of the verse  

cited above by Prof. Deshpande).

  

Meaning more or less the same.

  

But the "singularity" of the *jaDa* is maintained better in this *pATha* (!).

However, the plethora of the *jaDa*-s very well reflected in the other *pATha*.
