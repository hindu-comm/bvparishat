Beautiful post Pujya Korada-ji...the last sentence is the highlight. Just to add to your wonderful post:

  

चतुर्भिश्च प्रकारैः विद्योपयुक्ता भवति । आगमकालेन, स्वाध्यायकालेन, प्रवचनकालेन, व्यवहारकालेनेति ।



कैयट comments the above as:



आगमकालः – ग्रहणकालः (learning from AchArya) ;

स्वाध्यायकालः - अभ्यासकालः (self-practice);

प्रवचनकालः - अध्यापनकालः (teaching);

व्यवहारकालः – यज्ञे कर्मणि (practical application through karma-kANDa)

  

If theस्वाध्यायः is in the right direction (as directed by AchArya), the sAdhaka gets the directions / guidance / teachings mysteriously through dreams even after passing away of his preceptor. This has been the case with couple of our known scholars who used to receive the teachings in transcendental plane when the wavelength of spiritual frequency matches. The teaching continues....

  

rgs,

sriram
