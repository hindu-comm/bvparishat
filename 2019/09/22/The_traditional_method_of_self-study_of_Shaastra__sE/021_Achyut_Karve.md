Dear Vidwans,

  

How is the role of the Guru different from than that of a potter?

  

The potter has a choice over what kind and mix of soil he needs to make a pot. However in the case of a Guru he has no choice. His task is even more complex. He has to first make the student eligible to receive instruction before he actually delivers anything to him.

  

So many a times even if the guru is well versed in his subject it is of no use if he is unable to make the student eligible for the instruction.

  

In short merely having learnt under a guru does not make one eligible as the student might not be fit for carrying forward the tradition in the first instance.

  

It is for this reason that Shiksha has been given its due importance in our tradition which is being overlooked now-a-days.

  

With regards

Achyut Karve.
