Dear all

I sincerely request all of you to send new books and journals to French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP) library to help Shri Narendran to spread news.

French Institute Library is one among the very few good libraries in the field of Samskrit/ Indian studies. I have been benefited from that library in my stint in IFP long ago.

I call all youngsters to get benefited by this library and its helpfull Librarian Shri Narendran.

Narendran is the only person who is making us aware of many new publications.

I hope people will accept this proposal.
