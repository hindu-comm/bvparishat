Thank you and Namaskar Dr Rukmani-ji.

  

I have not been to Bangalore since 2010. Since then, I have planned two trips but they got cancelled for some reason of the other. Whenever I visit next, I will definitely contact you. I do visit India frequently to see my parents. They are getting old now. I and my wife alternate so that they get at least 3 trips between the two of us every year. We were there last month, and the kids too visited to wish both their grandmothers on their 70th birthdays (just 2 days apart!). My brother in Bangalore visited us with his family last winter, and flies into Delhi every time I am there. So, a trip to Bangalore is overdue.

  

We are settled in Minneapolis at least till our retirement, which is at least 15 years away. I hope you and your family are doing well.

  

With regards,

Vishal
