Namaskar!

  

I wanted to bring to the list members' attention a new edition (critical) of the Jaiminiya Brahmana aka Talavakara Brahmana published by IGNCA in three massive volumes (totaling approx 2000 pages) accompanied by a bare (though slightly interpretative) English translation. The work took several years in preparation and is a very significant addition to the recent editions of Vedic literature. One can buy it from Bibliaimpex.com or Exoticindia.com I hand carried my volumes from India 3 weeks back.

  

The original text critical edition was apparently started by Shri Bellikoth Ramachandra Sharma using several manuscripts but he fell ill and passed away. The variants are noted at the end of the last volume. The collated edition using this material and the translation was prepared by Dr H G Ranade (who has likewise prepared earlier translations and critical editions of Latyayana Shrautasutra (along with the commentaries) and translations of Katyayana Shrautasutra etc. Unfortunately, the scholar passed away around 2010 and the work lay with the publisher all along. Thereafter, the project was taken up recently directly with the Printing house with the assistance of other scholars, and now we have these 3 volumes.

  

As is well known, the Talavakara Brahmana is a variant of the ancient Shatyayaniya Brahmana (as well as the Bhallavi Brahmana according to Bhavatrata's vritti on Jaiminiya Shrautasutra), which is quoted profusely by Venkatamadhava and thence by Sayanacharya in narrating many Vedic narratives to explain RV Mantras. This Brahmana is as significant as the Shatapatha, but due to lack of complete English translations, it has largely been ignored. This is the case with several other non translated Vedic scriptures. The Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana is a variant of the Arsheya Brahmana (of Kauthuma Ranayaniya tradition). The Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana, of which the Kena Upanishad is a part, is also well known.

  

In the Jaiminiya and Jaiminya Upanishad Brahmanas, there are a lot of interesting legends which give some very rare historical/geographical information (e.g. change in the course of Sindhu in northern Sindh); and also more narratives on Ikshavakus than in other Brahmanas. The Brahmana runs parallel to the Tandya Brahmana, but has much more detail.

  

I hope that several other Samavedic scriptures that are partly published (e.g. Anupada Shrautrasutra; Jaiminiya Shrautasutra) or not published at all (e.g. Kalpanupada Sutra, Tanda Lakshana Sutra) get printed soon too. List members must be aware of recent editions of Jaiminiya Samaveda Samhita (per Kerala tradition, along with Ganams except Uha/Uhya/Rahasya) as well as the Ganas of Ranayaniyas (Purvagaana) printed recently, the last by the Dwaraka Shankara Matha.
