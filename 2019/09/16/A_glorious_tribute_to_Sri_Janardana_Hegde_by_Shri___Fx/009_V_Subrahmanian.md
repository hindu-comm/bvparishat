This is very well said, which applies to every teacher:

  

//It is indeed a formidable task to maintain the standard of a journal in Sanskrit

\- for the simple reason that it is so easy to commit mistakes in Sanskrit!

How many thousands of mistakes of others must Hegde have corrected,

and how many stylistic improvements must he have made!

And what an enormous amount of patience and hard work does it require!//

  

warm regards
