Namaste Ramakrishnan,  

  

Thank you for the advice. I've tried contacting SB UK in the past (via <http://www.samskritabharatiuk.org/>), but they said they don't sell books. Perhaps I went to the wrong people. If you've made successful book purchases from SB UK, which site did you use?

I should also add that through the efforts of my long-suffering Indian friends, I've managed to get most of the vyakarana books. The ones I really want to find now are the translations into Sanskrit.  

If you have information on these, I'd be grateful.  

Thank you again for your help.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
