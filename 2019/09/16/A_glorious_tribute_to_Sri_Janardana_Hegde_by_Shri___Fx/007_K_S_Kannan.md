Excellent and faithful write-up by Cha Mu Krishna Sastri on Vidwan Janardana Hegde.

  

Hegde deserves more honours and accolades for his unassuming, dedicated, and relentless work.

Hearty congratulations for the well-deserved honour!

It is almost that there is no Sanskrit scholar who does not know JH.

  

It is indeed a formidable task to maintain the standard of a journal in Sanskrit

\- for the simple reason that it is so easy to commit mistakes in Sanskrit!

How many thousands of mistakes of others must Hegde have corrected,

and how many stylistic improvements must he have made!

And what an enormous amount of patience and hard work does it require!

  

Just to illustrate one incident (with regard to (Late) Vidwan N Ranganatha Sharma,

a giant in vyAkaraNa). I once recited before him (about 40 years ago)  

a verse from the famed poet Venkatadhvarin. One verbal form puzzled him.  

He waded through pages of *SiddhAnta KaumudI* for a while, and then satisfied himself  

that the form was indeed right.The cogitation and confirmation consumed nearly ten minutes!

But the meticulousness of the fastidious grammarian was unquestionable.

  

While composing in Sanskrit, one is beset with doubts and apprehensions at every step!

The labyrinth of rules, exceptions, and counter-exceptions, and the very many situations where "doctors differ"

can all scare anyone who wants to write a proper Sanskrit. And *to adhere to a **simple yet chaste** Sanskrit*

*is even more difficult!* : it is easier, perhaps to write Sanskrit embellished with bombast!

But JH's writings are lucid yet never sompromised. And the variety in his contributions  

have been well acknowledged by CMK.  

  

Our hearty *abhinandanAni* to JH! JH is a *mita-bhAs"in* (and almost to a fault, as it were!). Nevertheless

*mitam ca sAram ca vaco hi vAggmitA!*

  

May many more well-deserved honours come his way!
