Yet I’m saddened by the following. The article lists “15 books on Vyakarana, 15 books of Creative writing, 10 books translated from other languages into Samskrit”, but if I were to track these works to purchase, how many will I find scattered in various places? Will there ever exist a dedicated Sanskrit bookshop that sets its task to stock and ship widely the works of such scholars?
