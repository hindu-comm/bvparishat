There seem to exist 3 editions of Karmarkar's work: the 1923 edition from the original post, 1951 Poona edition, and a 2003Chaukhamba edition that seems to be a reprint of the 1951 edition.

I can try placing an interlibrary loan for either of the 3, but the 1923 edition shows only in 1 library (and they may or may not agree to lend the book), whereas the 1951 and 2003 editions seem to be more widely available.

Also, please say if you can wait long enough for the interlibrary loan to be delivered. Depending on where it's coming from, this can take a few weeks.

I can place the order immediately, just need your input as above.
