Shankara ji,  
  
It’s not, so unfortunately I can’t put the file into open and unrestricted access. However, giving access to the individual requesters is a small step forward, so I’m sharing it with you too, in case people approach you.  
If I locate the 1923 edition, I’ll scan that too in order to make it more widely available. As of now, Leiden has the only 1923 copy WorldCat can find - good luck to us with getting that...  
  
Irene
