**We do not live our own lives volitionally:** The sense of personal doer ship and its affectivity in the ego needs to be transcended.

No one is a ‘doer’ but, rather, all actions are happening ordained by this One Source. As Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda wrote: When did smoke learn to fly? Let the meaning sink in. Everything is just a happening and nothing is a deed done by anyone. We do not choose to be born, choose to grow old, choose to be ill, or choose to die. How then can one imagine that we choose anything in-between?

Whatever you think and do at any time is dictated by your programming – genes and environmental conditioning –which God created exclusively for you. Neither of us has any control over anything. Everything happens. I certainly have free will, if by free will I understand that, in any given situation, I can do whatever I think I should do. But the fact of the matter is that my free will does not make the slightest difference to the happening of life. We are not living our lives, but merely watching a TV serial of life.

An interesting revelation: my free will depends almost entirely on two factors, over neither of which I had any influence at all: my genes and the conditioning that I have been continuously exposed to – at home, in school, society, church, or temple.

**What then is the conclusion?** Life is a movie.

It is that I do have free will to do whatever I think I should in any given situation, but that I have totally no control over what happens or over the consequences of the happening. What seems to be ‘my free will is actually God’s will? God makes me do ‘His’ will and makes me think that it is ‘my’ will. Is that not a real joke?
