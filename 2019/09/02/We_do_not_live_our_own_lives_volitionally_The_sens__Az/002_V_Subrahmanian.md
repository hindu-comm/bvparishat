Bhagavadgita 5.14 word 'svabhaavastu pravartate' captures the ideas that you have stated:

**  
**

न कर्तृत्वं न कर्माणि लोकस्य सृजति प्रभुः।  
  
न कर्मफलसंयोगं स्वभावस्तु प्रवर्तते।।5.14।।  

  

**English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda**

5.14 Prabhuh, the Self; na srjati, does not create; lokasya, for anyone; kartrtvam, agentship, by saying 'Do this'; or even karmani, any objects-such objects as chariot, pot, palace, etc. which are intensely longed for; nor even karma-phala-samyogam, association with the results of actions-association of the creator of a chariot etc. with the result of his work. Objection: If the embodied one does not do anything himself, and does not make others do, then who is it that engages in work by doing and making others do? The answer is: Tu, but; it is svabhavah, Nature- one's own (sva) nature (bhava)-characterized as ignorance, Maya, which will be spoken of in, 'Since this divine Maya' (7.14); pravartate, that acts. But from the highest standpoint-

नादत्ते कस्यचित्पापं न चैव सुकृतं विभुः।  

  
अज्ञानेनावृतं ज्ञानं तेन मुह्यन्ति जन्तवः।।5.15।।  

**English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda**

5.15 Vibhuh, the Omnipresent; na adatte, neither accetps; kasyacit, anybody's-even a a devotee's; paapam, sin; na ca eva, nor even; does He accept sukrtam, virtue offered by devotees. Why then are such virtuous acts as worship etc. as also sacrifices, charity, oblation, etc. worship etc. as also sacrifices, charity, oblation, etc. offered by devotees? To this the Lord says: Jnanam, knowledge, discriminating wisdom; remains avrtam, covered; ajnanena, by ignorance. Tena, thery; jantavah, the creatures, the non-discriminating people in the world; muhyanti, become deluded thus-'I do; I make others do; I eat; I make others eat.'

Yet we have a workable freewill that is also taught in the Gita 3rd chapter.
