Namaste.

  

The first name of research work in case of Sanskrit grammar that comes to my mind is: The PhD thesis "पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्" of H.E. Buiskool (1934), originally in Dutch, but later recast into English as "Theत्रिपादी" (1939). The title page of the latter is attached.

  

A small article under the title "Asiddhavadatrābhāt: its Treatment in the post-Pāṇinian Systems of Sanskrit Grammar" was presented to AIOC by me and has been published in Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, Vol. 50, Nos.1-4, Sep.-June 2000-2001 Issue, pp.43-54.

  

PhD under the topic "Asiddhavadatrābhāt" is being done by Miss Sanhita Joshi.

  

Best wishes

Narayan Prasad
