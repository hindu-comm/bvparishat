Professor Wakankar,

  

There is no doubt that your works continue to be in vigorous use. Yesterday at the library I walked past a small group working together, and on top of their book pile was your Literary Gems from Sanskrit Literature.

Just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the proof of helpful and well-executed scholarly work is in the book/paper being found on people's desks, educating them and receiving their appreciative attention.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
