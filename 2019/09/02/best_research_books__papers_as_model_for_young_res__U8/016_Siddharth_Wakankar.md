Dear Dr. Irene,

  

I am extremely happy to know this from your encouraging mail.

  

Some foreign scholars are working on Games like Snakes and Ladders,Chess or Chaturanga etc.and refer to my exhaustive Bibliographic Papers on these subjects.

  

Once again thanks for this wonderful piece of information which is vitally important to me.

  

Warm regards,

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
