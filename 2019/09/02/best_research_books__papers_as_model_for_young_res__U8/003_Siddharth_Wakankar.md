Dear Scholar Friends,

  

One of the best books on excellent research work is: A Critical Edition of the Shatakatraya of Bhartruhari, by Prof D. [D.Kosambi.It](http://D.Kosambi.It) was published years ago by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai,400007.

  

Very few seem to have studied this book by a Mathematician. It is a kind of a very rare publication.  

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
