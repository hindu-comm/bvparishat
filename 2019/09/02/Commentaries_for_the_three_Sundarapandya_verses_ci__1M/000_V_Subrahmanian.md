In the Bhashya for the 4th sutra ‘tat tu samanvayaat’, at the end, Shankara has cited three verses that are very crucial to the tenets of Advaita. These verses are said to be of ‘Sundara Pandya’ who is also said to have written on purva mimamsa. In order to help the study of these verses, the commentaries of Panchapadika, Bhamati, Nyayanirnaya and Ratnaprabha are selected and given in this file. The English translation by Swami Gambhirananda of the verses and the Kannada translation of the verses by Swami Sachidanandendra Saraswati have also been provided in this file which can be viewed here:
