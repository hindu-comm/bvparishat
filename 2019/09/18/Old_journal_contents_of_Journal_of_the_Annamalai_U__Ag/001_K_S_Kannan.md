This is an excellent service, Dr. Narenthiran!

  

Ideally, apart from publishing the Contents Page as and when a journal comes out,

every ten years at least, every journal must bring out a special issue consisting of just the  

Contents Page+Author Index +Title Index

including, of course, page no.s (from & to).

  

This should not be difficult in this age of soft/searchable copies

(where no printing cost/problems of marketing are involved).

  

In the case of longstanding journals, special issues of 50 years and 100 years  

would also be desirable in addition.

  

Where there are no copyright problems,

it may be best to put them all article by article (not just issue by issue)

in places like Internet Archives.  

  

(I know some journals are doing this already, even if sporadically sometimes).

  

Thanks again, Dr Narenthiran, for working thus for the cause of scholarship.

For every thanks expressed, there will be a hundred thanks felt but just not openly expressed.
