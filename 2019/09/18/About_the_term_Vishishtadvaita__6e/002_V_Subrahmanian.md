Thanks for the reply. Is there any specific term/s that is used by him to denote his doctrine? For instance, in Shankara's bhashyas we find the following terms used to denote his school:

  

अस्माकमद्वैतदृष्टिरभ्रान्तानाम् , Mandukya bhashya.

  

अद्वैतिनां पुनः, Gita bhashya

  

अद्वैतिनो ह्येते अन्योन्यस्य पक्षौ सदसतोर्जन्मनी प्रतिषेधन्तः अजातिम् अनुत्पत्तिमर्थात्ख्यापयन्ति Mandukya bhashya

  

औपनिषदाः, एकत्ववादी, etc.
