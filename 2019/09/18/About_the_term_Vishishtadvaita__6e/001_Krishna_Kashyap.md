The term "Vishistadvaita" is not found in the works of Sri Ramanujacharya. It was first used in a laudatory hymn by Sri AndhrapUrNa on Sri Ramanujacharya as a pravartaka of "visistadvaita". In fact Sri KSV, my teacher argues that the term "Visishtadvaita" is not sufficiently accurate description of this system of thought. It should be "savishEsha advaita". However, historical events made the name of the system famous as "Vishistadvaita".

  

The words “visista’ and “savisEsa” are synonyms. Hence the term visistadvaita has the same meaning as “savisEsadvaita”. However, the term savisEsa is more appropriate and comprehensive compared to the term visista, which is used in a restricted sense in the phrase “cit-acit-visista”. The term savisEsa can include infinite auspicious attributes, while the term cit-acit-visista addresses attributes related to: cit and acit only.
