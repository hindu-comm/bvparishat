Namaste,

  

Mahamahopadhyaya Maddulapalli Dattatreya Sarma Garu, a great scholar of Advaita and a great exponent of 'bhagavatam' was awarded the title 'abhinava-shuka'. I was present in the function.

  

He is of the view that there is 'bhagavata-sampradaya' that stresses on sharaNAgati tattva and 'unccha-vritti dharma'. Those who do the 'unccha-vritti', wear tulasi-mAla and urdhwa-puNdra with gOpi-chandana and devoted to Vishnu are called 'bhagavataar'.

  

There arose different branches of traditions and based on vaishNava-agamas, the dikshAs like 'samAshrayaM' which involves tapta-mudrA dhAraNa etc.

  

But, the foundation for vaiSNava-siddhAnta is basically the bhAgavata-sampradAya which involves viSNu-bhakti and prapatti and those vaiSNavas were called 'bhAgavatAr' who eke out their living either with unccha-vritti or yAyAvaraM.

  

rgs,

sriram
