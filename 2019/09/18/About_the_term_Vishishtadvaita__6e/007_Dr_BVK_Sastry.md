Namaste



A side thought: Can one explore the meaning expansions on the term
विशिष्टाद्वैत as :



a) विशिष्ट- अद्वैत = Unique Non-duality

b) वि - ( शिष्ट-अद्वैत) = Reminder of Non-duality approved by the learned 



c) Why वि - उपसर्ग , if शिष्टाद्वैत can give the desired meaning
? The upasarga has several meanings. ? savisEsa is more appropriate is still **sa- vi- sEsa.**



d) What would be the plausible meaning of the term अव -शिष्टाद्वैत in the frame of शेष -शेषि understanding ?

Using the reference of Sloka attributed to Acharya Shankara : 

सत्यपि भेदापगमे नाथ, तवाहं, न मामकीनस्त्वं, सामुद्रो हि तर ङ्गः
क्वचन समुद्रो न तारङ्गः

Thanks in advance for the clarifications.

The reference given is V. Varadachari, "Antiquity of the term Visistadvaita", ALB 26, 1962, 177-181

Can this be traced/accessed?
