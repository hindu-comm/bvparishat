Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

Pranams.

  

Thankyou very much for such informative and enlightening discussion on this topic. I learnt many things.

  

Overall, the below reply from Sivasenani describes the crux of what has been discussed till now, in summary. In Advaita line:

  

\* Srimad Bhagavatam's is considered on the same footing as other smrtis (especially on the footing as maha-puranas)

\* It is accepted as pramana as long as it doesn't contradict with Sruti

\* It is very popular because it is highly poetic and it narrates lilas of vishnu which are by nature very attractive

\* Its being popular doesn't increase its pramanatva to other puranas; as increased popularity of Purusa-suktas (in sruti) does not place them on higher pramanatva than other parts of the sruti

  

Now, only one simple question still needs answer:

  

Is Srimad Bhagavatam taught in some of the gurukulas of advaitin or smarta lines? i.e does it form a part of gurukula curriculum?

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
