The Bhagavatam ends with Parikshit getting the 'brahmaatmaikya' realization. 'aham Brahma asmi' is the contemplation taught therein. Sri Narayana Bhatta in his Narayaneeyam which is a condensation of the Bhagavatam, prays for 'aikyam' with Krishna. He has portrayed Krishna as above the Trimurti-s, that is, the one that appears as the Trimurti-s.
