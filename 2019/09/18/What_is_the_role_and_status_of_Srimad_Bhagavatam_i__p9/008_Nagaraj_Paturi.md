Oh! I see.

  

Now I understand.

  

General understanding is that followers of Sankara by family tradition are called Smartas and as such they are supposed/believed to be Advaitins in their Vedantic subscription.

  

You want to say that you would not like to agree that all Smartas by family tradition need not actually follow Advaita Vedanta, the way they should. Some people not born into a Smarta family may in fact be following Advaita Vedanta. So you want to call those born ito a Smarta family as Smartas and those who follow Advaita Vedanta truly irrespective of their family tradition are Advaitins.

  

Am I right?

  

The word Smarta refers to the the principles regarding ritualistic practice followed by the family. In fact , persons born into a Smarta family may or may not know or follow those principles.
