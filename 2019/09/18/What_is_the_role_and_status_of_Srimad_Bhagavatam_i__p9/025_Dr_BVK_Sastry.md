Namaste Prof. KSK,



1. Thanks for pitching upon a suspect reference for the popular quote.
May be Manu smriti 2-172 ( placed below) says the same idea in a different way.

The 'birth to vedas' is through the vaidika samskara called ' upanayana'. Thus logically, the birth onwards till the samskara , the status is one of ' shudra'.



 As long as the quote resonates the view of one or more 'Smriti-texts', the followers of it are rightly called ' Smriti - followers/ compliant life style practitioners = smaarta's.

Smriti is the valid source to derive Dharma identity.

2. Whether the quoted text ( with reading variations) appears in Atri smriti 141-142 (Or one of the several smriti texts, or variant text readings of Manu smriti/ Manu samhitaa/ Maanava dharma shaastra and the like; or anonymous segments of Mahabharata ! or Skanda Purana Vol.18 Book VI , Nagar Kanda , Chapter 239 , ( Efficacy of Adoration , Penance etc.) Verse 31-34 as internet resources point to) the public and community opinion has remained firm on '*janmanA jAyate s'UdraH'.
*



 Manu stands as much an authority for smarthas as well as vaishnavas ! ( kalau tu manurabraveet !) Is there any authoritative
guidance for vaishnavas and Sri vaishnavas to stay out of ' Manu- smriti ( or any other Smriti ') guidance , thus putting them out of the 'smaartha' tag ? Even Srimad Bhagavad-Gita is technically called as a 'Smruti/ dharma -Shaasttra'. Pl. help me to get a clarity on this.



 The self made preferential choices to go by 'vendanta' violating the primary directive for compliance with ' Dharma-Shaastra/ smruti guidance' is only a logic of easy convenience.



3. In the context of discussion in this thread, connecting 'Bhagavatam and Smarta sampradaya- identity tag', it may be enough to note that 'smarta's' so far in tradition, have carried a balanced respect for all Puranas (without getting to the classification of Rajas- Tamas- Satvik). Smaarthas seamlessly recognize the hierarchical authority and connected continuum of 'Shruti- Smriti- Purana' in the 'Acahrya Bhagavatpada Shanakara sampradaya'. 



4. On a side note, on the points that have popped up in discussion in this thread and ' varnanam brahmano guruh'- and observation 'smartha by birth', the concept of ' irrevocable 'janma- brahmanya- inheritance' status has been the shield for many brahmana title claimants in the community. And this is challenged by many social reformers, saints and non-hindu religion proponents. 

Manu smriti provides a total clarity on this issue ! Reference may be taken to Manu smriti ( Chapter 2 - entire section; more specifically verses quoted below- <https://archive.org/stream/ManuSmriti_201601/Manu-Smriti_djvu.txt> .
The verdict of Manu (present in the extant texts) explicitly allows 'across varna movements' within one life span and regain of status through appropriate prayaschitta.



 Faith, Vedanta, Devataa, Purana affiliations does not have a bearing on 'technical varna identity/ smaartha identity'.

 Socially, the perception is different.



The reference from Manu-smriti may be of interest to contemplate here.



2.168. A twice-born man who, not having studied the Veda, applies himself to other (and worldly study), soon falls, even while living, to the condition of a Sudra and his descendants (after him).



2.169. According to the injunction of the revealed texts the first birth of an Aryan is from (his natural) mother, the second (happens) on the tying of the girdle of Munga grass, and the third on the initiation to (the performance of) a (Srauta) sacrifice.



2.170. Among those (three) the birth which is symbolised by the investiture with the girdle of Munga grass, is his birth for the sake of the Veda; they declare that in that (birth) the Sivitri (verse) is his mother and the teacher his father.



2.171. They call the teacher (the pupil’s) father because he gives the Veda; for nobody can perform a (sacred) rite before the investiture with the girdle of Munga grass.



2.172. **(He who has not been initiated) should not pronounce (any) Vedic text excepting (those required for) the performance of funeral rites, since he is on a level with a Sudra before his birth from the Veda.**



I would appreciate your review of the 'smartha' identity technicality i have placed in the post.



Regards

BVK Sastry

- does not occur in *Manu-smRti.*
