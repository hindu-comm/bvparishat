Dear Shri Paturi Garu,

  

Yes. Not all Smarthas grow up with understanding of Advaita. The realisation is another thing.

I am by no means an expert, but I was under the impression that those who followed the Smritis for achara were smArthas. Do correct if I am wrong.

  

While Bhagavan in the BG opines that

vidya-vinaya-sampanne  
brahmane gavi hastini  
suni caiva sva-pake ca  
panditah sama-darsinah  

 I am unsure how many of us in practical affairs have this lack of discriminatory vision.

The reason for not calling oneself an advaitin until one has achieved the equality of vision is for reasons of vyavaharika satya. It would be highly mendacious to assume such a vision when one's inner culture has not matured to that level. This can only happen after some sort of control has been established over the shadripus.

It is this dichotomy between innerworld and facade that leads to the fall of one.

  

It is therefore better to be careful with the distinctions.

  

My 2 cents,

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
