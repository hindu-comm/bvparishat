Many Advaitins study the Vishnu Sahasra nama Bhashya of Shankaracharya as it contains a very heavy load of Advaita in the book's introduction.
That section is itself a good study of Advaita. There, in order to bring out the 'abheda' message in its various facets, Shankara has cited profusely from the shruti, smriti, itihasa and purana. That collection itself is mind boggling.
