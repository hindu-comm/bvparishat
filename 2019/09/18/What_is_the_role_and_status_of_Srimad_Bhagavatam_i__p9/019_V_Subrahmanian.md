It is still a mystery as to how the term 'smartha-s' came to be associated with the followers of Shankaracharya, as different from those of the other two Acharyas. I am not sure what name exists for this set of people in the North India.

  

Karma is distinguished as shrauta and smaarta. In the upaveeta changing/dhaarana sankalpa we say '....shrauta smaarta vihita nitya karma anushthaana yogyataa siddhyartham....'. That way followers of the other two Acharya-s too are smarthas.

  

It would be interesting if someone does a research on this topic of how a section came to be called 'smarthas.'
