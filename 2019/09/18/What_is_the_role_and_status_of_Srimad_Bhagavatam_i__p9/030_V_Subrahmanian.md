<https://namadwaar.org/establishment-list/sri-sandeepani-gurukulam/> 

  

//Sri Sandeepani Gurukula Trust strives to preserve our Vaidhika Dharma by imparting Vedic knowledge to students, supporting Vedic scholars and conducting Veda parayanam/conferences. Presently there are nearly 70 students learning Yajur Veda and Sama Veda under the able guidance of the Principal and 9 adhyapaks. Ithihasas and puranas are also taught here.//

  

I have heard that the above institution had started a gurukulam exclusively for Bhagavatam learning, spanning 7 years, in Bangalore. I also heard about another institution (smarta) on similar lines in a place in Tamil Nadu, maybe Govindapuram. If you contact the above URL you will get information on this.
