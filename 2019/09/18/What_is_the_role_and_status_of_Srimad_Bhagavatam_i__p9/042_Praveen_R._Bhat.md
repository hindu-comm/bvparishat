Chinmaya mission has parts of it in the curriculum of their residential course. Arsha Vidya Gurukula also covers parts of it. There are quite a few Advaitins who have bhAgavata saptAhas as individuals as well as through their own ashrams.

  

PS: There is nothing in Advaita Vedanta against bhakti as it culminates into advaita-bhakti with aikya.
