Another way of looking to answer is the question posed is Is Devi Bhagvata, Sri Chkara Puja thought is some Gurukulas or Samartalines? ie does it form a part of gurukula Curriculum. The answer would be the no, but Devi Bhagavata and Sri chakra upasana is highly respected and widely practiced as means and not an end bu itself.
