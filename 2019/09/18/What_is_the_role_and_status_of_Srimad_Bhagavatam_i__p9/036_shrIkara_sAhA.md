Damodara ji, Advaitins can wear urdhva pundra. They're inheritors of the tradition of Swami Bodhendra Swamigal, who was very much an advaitin.

  

I'm sure being an advaitin of any form (sha\~NkarAdvaita etc) does not prevent anyone from being staunchly devoted to Krishna. We have the case of Narayana Bhattathiri of Kerala who wrote the summary of bhAgavatam called the Narayaneeyam ,Madhushudan Saraswati (commentary on Gita) etc.

  

And the fact they were bhaktas is known to their contemporaries and those who came after them, no matter how one AchArya of one branch of a sampradAya thinks or how many followers he made. He (Madhushudan Saraswati)was influential enough to be referred to by vishvanAtha chakravarti in his commentary respectfully.
