Yes, Sri Venkat avarghal, etymologically Smarta is derived from Smriti only. But in rUDhi, the word is used to refer to a person born into a family of followers of Sankara tradition.

  

Elders used to explain the word by showing examples of how performance of Aabdika is preferred to festivals falling on that day by Smartas .
