Namaste



Sometimes the \< popular explanation> of \< precise technical terms in Samskruth> do not come out in discussions; and this creates a fuzzy understanding of what the tradition stood for. Here is a small observation, within the limits of my understanding and observation, presenting how 'smaartha' identiy may be constructed across all varnas.
One can choose their flavor to claim smaartha status in all three or preferred lanes.



A) **By Birth** : Every 'Jeeva' - individual ( man or woman) is born in a context specific Eco/ Ego -system of Family and community.

(Pl. dont push this by janmanaa jayate shudrah. This statement of Manu has been severely misconstrued! ). 



This is ' eco/ ego -system of parental faith and ' social -status' which attaches ' historical, inheritance' tags to individual as ' Born to a specific Varna - Jati ( like

Brahmana ) - Kula- Sampradaya ( like smartha = Family tradition; Vaishnava, lingaayata, shaakta.... ). 

The individual has the 'Free will- Choice' to live by these expectations or drop out of it or reject/ modify. They also have a choice to break it and destroy or defend it.



** ' By birth -Smaartha' refers to this inherited context of Eco/ Ego -system of Family and community where one is born'.**



B) **By Samskara** : Every individual (man or woman) has a legacy option of 'Samskaras' in two lanes.

***Lane One*** , where in the ' Samskaras' are imposed . Example - the early part of child's life : Role play by Parents, Relatives, Teachers, Eco-System of community.

 These are Kula-Dharma, Jati-Samskara, Community Culture Constraints.

The individual has the 'Free will-
Freedom Choice' to take good advantage of this or drop out of it or reject/ modify.

They also have a freedom to pursue education to understand and progress on what they received; or stay blind-faith fastidious followers and defenders. 

 **' By Samskara -Smaartha' ( Lane - One)
refers to the procedural modalities of rites of passage to which individual was subjected to in the context of Eco/ Ego -**

** system of Family and community where one was
born'. **



 ***Lane Two ***where in the individual opts for practicing the ' Samskaras' and repose FAITH ( Shraddhaa) in performing the prescribed rites of passage. Example -

the way one undertakes ones daily routine of Sandhya, worship, dress and decor code ( Vibhuti or mudra), Observance of Vrata and such ishta-kamya rituals.

 These are vyakti- kutumba- desha -achara -Dharma's Personal Preferences and liking to a ' religion-culture preferences by texts and liturgical rites'. 

Irrespective of format of performance by the tags of smarta, vaishnava, srivaishnava, tantriaka , pauranika sampradaya model of Sandhya, the goal of Sandhya and Gayatri upaasanaa to attain ' Vipratva' remains. The choice of samkalpa declaration in smartha sampradaya may keep all vednata flavors out of textual statement; or another sampradaya may insist on use of the ' antaryaami -anatargata' vedanta guidance to be a part of samkalpa. It does not change the 'SMAARTHA = SMRUTHI - ANUGRAHEETA / ANUMATHA ' status. Choosing 'SB' does not make one better or lower ' smaartha' against a choice of Ramayana or Mahabharata or gurucharita.



** ' By Samskara -Smaartha' ( Lane - two) refers to the personal practice modalities of rites of passage adapted by individual in the context of Eco/ Ego -**

** system of Family and community where one lives and practices, finds a intellectual satisfaction and peace by
faith'. **



In other words, ALL SAMPRADAYA practices are to be tagged as 'SMAARTHA- YOGA- ABHYAASA/ SAMSKARA' which come as (i) Veda moola (ii) build 'aastikya' and (iii) stand in tune with one or more teachings of GITA -Yoga's (Direct or interpreted, by Masters or Dharma texts). 



** ' This is 'SMAARTHA ' By Samskara - Shraddhaa- Abhyaasa' where practice ( = abhyaasa) of the procedural modalities of
rites of passage (yogas) by individual is shown as a 'Living Practice' in the context of Eco/ Ego -system of Family and community where one lives and works'. Here one can spice up their 'SMAARTHA' pride by the ' Guru, Study and Realization' as personal factors . **
