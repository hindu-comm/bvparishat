There are upasakas of Vishnu who wear urdhvapundra amongst Advaitins. One famous example is Bellamkonda Ramaraya, a Hayagrivopasaka who wore urdhvapundras, and wrote many works critical of non-advaita schools, esp. Visishtadvaita.

  

Apart from that, Tilaka is worn widely by Advaitins on occasions such as marriage (kalyana tilaka). Also Tilaka is the preferred mark for children, before their upanayana.
