Dear sirs,

I have been a smarta and also an advaitin but I have been a passionate reader of the three texts mentioned - the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavatam. In fact, I mostly followed the commentary of Govindaraja while teaching Ramayana (episodes which can be seen on the advaita academy /youtube).

I have also been a great admirer of the ISKCON because of their tremendous vigour and perseverancein spreading the message of the Gita in about 150 countries in the world, facing all odds. This is a unique achievement. We may have our subtle differences on ontological issues at a high level but that does not in any way disturb our joy of reading the texts under discussion. The great advaitin Madhusudana Saraswati was a great bhakta of Lord Krishna.

Aravinda Rao
