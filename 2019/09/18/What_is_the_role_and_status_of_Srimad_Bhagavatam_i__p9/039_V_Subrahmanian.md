Bellamkonda Ramaraya belonged to a family of followers of Visishtadvaita:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellamkonda_Ramaraya_Kavindrulu>

  

//Ramaraya Kavi's earlier name was Rama Rao. He was born to Bellamkonda Mohan Rao and Hanumamba on 27 December 1875, in Pamidipadu Agraharam, Narasaraopet, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. Though they were 6000 Niyogi Brahmins, they paradoxically embraced Vaishnava cult headed by Sri Ramanuja Acharya who founded a new*bhakti*tradition called*Vishishtadvaita*. As such, Rama Rao's family was also deeply religious and devoted to Lord Vishnu and pursuing*Vishishtadvaita*.^([\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellamkonda_Ramaraya_Kavindrulu#cite_note-8)//)
