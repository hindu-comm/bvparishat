Sri Damodara Dasa

  

There are six pramanas accepted in Advaita. The third pramana is Sruti.

  

Since Veda is unlimited and much of it is lost to us, where it does not conflict with Veda, Smriti is accepted as a part of SrutipramaaNa. Srimadbhagavatam is a Purana and so is accepted as a Smriti. Therefore, whatever is said in Bhagavatam is taken as valid by Advaitins as long as it does not contradict Veda.

  

Here, two questions may be posed. Do some not consider the Devi Bhagavatam as the 'Bhagavatam' in the 18 upapuranas? Yes, some do. But even those people also accept the praamaanya of Srimadbhagavatam. It is important to note that Smriti category is not limited to Puranas.

  

Secondly, Sankaracharya did not quote from Srimadbhagavatam; so, is it acceptable to Advaitins? I have not checked this, but surely there would be some Smriti from which Sankaracharya did not quote; the mere non-quotation by Sankaracharya does not affect the praamaanya of any text for an Advaitin. Acharya quoted those texts that he found relevant.

  

A different stream of thought is: when Srimadbhagavatam is such an important text, should we not read something into it not being quoted by Sankara (or Ramanujacharya)? The answer is 'no'. The 'importance' of Srimadbhagavatam, in relation to other Puranas, Mahabharata, Ramayana etc. is for some schools only. In other schools, including Advaita, it is on the same footing as other Smritis. Yes, since there is high quality kaavyatva in Srimadbhagavatam and since the leelas of Vishnu are so engaging, the text is hugely popular, much more popular than say, Agni Purana (more of an Encyclopedia); but this popularity does not alter its status. For instance Gayatri mantra and Purusha Sukta are very popular, but their status as Sruti is same as other parts of Veda.

  

In short, the status of Srimadbhagavatam in Advaita is that it is accepted wholeheartedly as a Pramana as long as there is no contradiction with Sruti.
