smArtas are not at all averse to bhAgavatam or nAmasmaraNam(provided one doesn't skimp their nityakarma in the name of kIrtana) They use shrIdhara's commentary most commonly\[yes, he was an advaitin\] and in traditions in Kerala, Bhattathiri's summary of the bhAgavata purANa, the Narayaneeyam is very popular.

An example of them teaching bhAgavata and rAmAyaNa along with Vedas etc <https://srisrianna.com/veda-samrakshanam/>
