Is Srimad Bhagavatam taught in some of the gurukulas of advaitin or smarta lines? i.e does it form a part of gurukula curriculum?  

  

Yes it is thought but is not an end byitself as explained earlier. The emphasis in Advaita vedanta are on prastaan trayi and shruti is the highest pramana. Any school of vedanta interprets prasthana trayi from their view point of view. The logic is always shruti anukula traka in advaita and not bhagavta anukula tarka but this doesn't alter the high status of the puranas including Ramayana, Mahabharta, Bahgavata or other puranas as long as they don't contradict the shruti itself.
