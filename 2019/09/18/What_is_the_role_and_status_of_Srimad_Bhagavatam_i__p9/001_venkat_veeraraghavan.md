Dear Shri Damodara dasa:

  

Hare Krishna

  

SB is a central text for all Hindus whichever denomination they belong to.

While sampradayas may systematize the teaching and highlight the books that project their philosophy in a sahaja and effortless manner, they do not ignore other works.

Smarthas do follow the SB as do advaitins known to me.

  

Both smarthas and advaitins do not have any Vishnudvesha or any other dvesha that would prompt them to circumvent the SB or Ramayana or the MB.

I mention this specifically because I know that in ISKCON they openly say smarthas and advaitins are "envious" of Krishna.

Sorry to disappoint. Not true. Not true at all !

  

Speaking personally, the SB has given me uncounted hours of bliss and peace and motivation.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
