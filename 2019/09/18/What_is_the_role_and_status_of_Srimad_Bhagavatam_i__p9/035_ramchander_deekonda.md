Respected scholars,  
  
According to some dvaitamata- vaishnava traditions Srimad-bhagavatam is a unique scripture that establishes eternal bhakti (division or distinction) between iswara and jeevas. They maintain that advaitins taint the import of this mahapurana by advancing mAyavAdam through SB. They have this strong statement against commentaries of non-devotees, advaitins. Bhaktas are warned against listening to such avaishnava commentaries on SB.  
  
अवैष्णवमुखोद्गीर्णं पूतं हरिकथामृतं।  
श्रवणं नैव कर्तव्यं सर्पोच्छिष्टं पयो यथा।।  
  
Regards,
