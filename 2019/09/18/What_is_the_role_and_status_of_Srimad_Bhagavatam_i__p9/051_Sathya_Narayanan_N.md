Damordass ji,

When you say Gurukul. It can be interpreted as sampradaya patashala or modern gurukul system or sanskrit university.

  

Coming to Sampradaya patashala  

  

Currently, there are no specific gurukul where Bhagavatam is taught. Their are adhyapakas, to whose residence students go and learn. Gurus like muralidhara swamigal, Anna, Vittaldas etc...  

That is how sastras are taught in gurukulas. It is a matter of choice for the students, either to stop learning with Veda poorthi or sastras or puranas.  

  

  

But in old days, say till beginning of 1900. Bhagavatham, Ramayana, MB where taught along with Vedas. There was a huge decline in patashala after industrial revolution. For various reasons, the learning of Bhagavatham,Ramayana,MB Dharma sastra with Veda got diluted. Only scholars, who were interested/needed to learn more learned bhagavatham,MBh, Vedanta,Sastra, etc...  

  

  

  

Madras sanskrit college teaches bhagavatham. Many advaithins are there. This is one gurukul you can check.

Muralidhara swamigal trust, which definitely teaches BV. He is a great exponent of BV
