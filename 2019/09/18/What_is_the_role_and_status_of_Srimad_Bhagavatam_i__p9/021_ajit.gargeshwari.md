Smartha means “based on the Smriti". Smartha denotes the “smarta sampradaya”. Smartas are followers of smriti texts for which vedas are the highest authority. All major Gods such as Siva, Vishnu, Brhma, Sakati, Gnapati are accepted as forms of the one Brahman, in variance with Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism.  
.  
Smarta Brahmins in Karnataka are sub grouped into Hoysala Karnataka , Kammes, and Sankethis from Shengottai. Iyers settled in Nanjangud and Chamaraja Nagara . For all of them Srigenri Sankaracharya is the Guru. Since Srnigeris philosophy is Adavaita, Smartas learn and practice Adavaita system of thought.  
  
For Advata the highest pramamna are the shrutis. Bhagavta is studied, respected and commented in adavaita tradition but is not a shruti. Unlike in a few Viashnava traditions Bhagavata is considered equivalent
to shruti or vedas.  
  

I would like to know about Smarta Trdations practise in the north such as Gujarat.
