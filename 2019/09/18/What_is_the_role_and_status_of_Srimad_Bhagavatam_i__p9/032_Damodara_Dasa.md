\>\> Example where the Bhagavata is taught in a Gurukula run by an Advaitin is Bodhendra Swamigal Bhagavata Patasalai <https://srisrianna.com/veda-samrakshanam/> ...They are in the nAmakIrtana tradition of Sri Bhagavan Nama Bodhendra  
  

This gurukulam doesn't seem to be purely advaitin in nature; it seems  
connected to Sri Vaisnavism (at least tilaka).  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
