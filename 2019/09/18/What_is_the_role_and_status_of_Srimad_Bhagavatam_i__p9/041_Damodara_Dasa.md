Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I would like to keep the discussion anchored to the topic in question.  
Whether ISKCON or other vaisnavas are against mayavada or not is a  
separate issue and deserves a separate thread. For instance Madhvas  
are more against mayavada or advaitavada than even ISKCON. However,  
this is not the topic under discussion.  
  
Sivasenani ji has nice summarised and answered almost all the main  
points; however, when it was mentioned that some of the advaitin  
gurukulas do teach Bhagavata Purana in their curriculum, I was curious  
enough to know the names of some of such gurukulas, and also that was  
one part of the original question.  
  
So I asked again and some scholars kindly named some gurukulas.  
However, when I visited their websites, I found that they seem to be  
wearing Urddhva-pundra as Sri Vaisnavas do. So I thought that they are  
not purely advaitins but have some mixture of vaisnavism either in  
their goal or in their practice (sadhana).  
  
For instance, gurukulam of Sringeri Matha is considered advaitin  
gurukulam. Same seems to be the case with Veda-vijnana Gurukulam at  
Bangalore (they teach sariraka bhasya of Vedanta). There are many  
other advaita gurukulas. Many of them are smarta gurukulas also where  
they mainly teach karma-kandas; for instance gurukula in Dwaraka.  
  
Thus, my intention was to know whether any of these gurukulas teach  
Bhagavata Purana (or any other Purana) in their curriculum. So I  
repeat my question.  

  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das  
  

ps.  
----  
Regarding defining who is to be considered vaisnava, visnur yasya  
devata sa vaisnava. There may be categories of vaisnavas from  
beginning level to the topmost level. Tilaka in hindu usually marks  
the sampradaya one belongs to. Thus an advaitin is expected to wear  
tri-pundra (at least the traditional advaitin), while a vaisnava is  
expected to wear urddhva-pundra.  
  
Whether one is a vaisnava or advaitin can be understood by the  
philosophy one adheres to -- whether he considers brahma as having all  
varieties like name, form, etc in its ultimate highest existence or he  
considers brahma as nirakara nirvisesa in the ultimate sense. This  
means which explanation of vedanta one adheres to -- of sankara or of  
one of the vaisnavas'.
