Namaskars to all,

  

I think the reason why Bhagavatam is not part of the syllabus in Advaita centres is that they have not prescribed any other text of similar nature. There is no prescribed study (in syllabus) of the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Devi Bhagavatam or the Vishnu/Shiva puranam etc. Their focus is on the four shastras - Vyakarana, Mimamsa, Tarka and Vedanta. The termचतुश्शास्त्र पण्डित is common in the Telugu states. It may be so in other states too. There is some mandatory reading of thefirst few chapters of theपञ्च महाकाव्य-s in order to promote vyutpatti and general communication skills. Scholars however, studied all the three texts with passion, Bharatam as Brahmachari, Ramayana as grihastha and the Bhagavatam in the evening of life.

प्रातर्द्यूतप्रसङ्गेन मध्याह्ने स्त्रीप्रसङ्गतः।  
रात्रौ चोरप्रसङ्गेन कालो गच्छति धीमताम्॥  

I do not think that non-prescription of Bhagavatam is an indication of their disregard for the text.
