A few years ago, in the context of a Dvaita-Advaita discussion, a scholar of Advaita presented a paper listing a huge number of verses of the Srimadbhagavatam that carry the Advaitic purport. He said that this is just a sample and there are many more such verses. He also said that these verses do not need any explanation as they give that purport directly.

Later, I heard that the Dvaitins have countered that, in a book, denying that purport. But that is beside the matter.

  

The Uddhava Gita of the Bhagavatam is a favourite of Advaitins as many tenets of advaita are to be found there.
