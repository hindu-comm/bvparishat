Sri Anna (Krishna Premi) is very much a Vaishnava and was born in a family of Vaishnavas.  

  

Now we can split hairs on who is a Vaishnava and who is not, but it will just be one person's opinion against another's. ISKCON does not consider Mira Bai a proper Vaishnava since she does not walk, talk or quack like they do. The real question to ask is what does this do for their spiritual development? Why bother with these distinctions?

The trouble with most modern "Vaishnavas" is that they are more interested in throwing muck and ridicule at the people they call "Mayavadis" and other reprehensible names rather than loving Krishna.

I spent a wasted 40 minute lecture with a certain ISKCON monk in Karnataka where the agenda from minute 1 to end was laughing at Vivekananda, Aurobindo and others like him.

The problem here is that since they advise against reading other commentaries, and they usually have zero understanding of the language of the scriptures, it is usually one person parroting what his Guru has said and by choosing what they consider Guru-Sadhu and Shastra, they have created their own echo chamber where in they spend all their time laughing at the rest of the world and less time on actual Krishna-prema.

  

Krishna Bhaktas do not come in one size color or shape. Sometimes recognising a real Vaishnava will only happen when it is already too late
