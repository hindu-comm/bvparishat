Coming back to the topic of the thread, there is a whole Telugu translation/transcreation of Srimadbhagavatam into classical Telugu done in the 15th century in a mellifluous style so popular that many portions of the book have been on the tongues of Telugu peopleamong scholars and non-scholars alike, a very rare achievement for a classical language work. This book is Advaitic in approach. The author composed long passages of shaastric Vedantic explanation full of technical terms at every opportune occasion.
