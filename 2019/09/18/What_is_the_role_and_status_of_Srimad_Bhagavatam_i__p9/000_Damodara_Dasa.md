Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

Pranam.

  

Srimad-Bhagavatam is known to be a central text of the Gaudiya and Vallabha  
sampradaya Vaishnavas. Yet it is also often quoted by Smartha and Advaitin  
pandits.  
  
What is the role of SB in the Smartha/Advaitin tradition? In Smartha  
gurukuls such as at Kanchi, Sringeri, and Dwaraka, is SB part of the  
curriculum?

  

Hari guru vaishnava das,

Damodar das
