In the Sringeri Mutt there are official observances of Narasimha Jayanthi, Vamana Jayanti, Krishna Jayanti, Ramanavami, Anantha Padmanabha Vrata, every year, devoutly, by the Jagadguru Himself. On many of these occasions the Bhagavatam relating to the Jayanti is read out.

  

There are many smarta-s who read the Bhagavatam regularly, give discourses, in many languages. Acharyas/Jagadguru-s include stories from the bhagavatam in their discourses.

  

Sridhari Vyakhya is a fine text on the Bhagavatam that brings out the Advaitic doctrine. In the beginning of his Vishnupuranam commentary, Sridhara Swamin specifically says that this VP is a fine place to find Advaita/Abheda.
