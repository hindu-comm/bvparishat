Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Deepavali Abheeshta Chintan. Happy Indian Fiscal New Year Day (Oct 19, 2009)

On the Shubha occasion of Deepavali, I do not want to get into the trash of that lady professor of Univ. Chicago. But think of me. Somebody from US Universities throw trash on Hidu community in USA everyday.

I support position of Dr. Narang. One cannot deny historical references in Vedas. Dr. Pandurangi was correct that outsiders are misusing Sanskrit words in interpretations. Exactly for these two reasons, my concentration on meanings of Sanskrit words and past history. Patriotism is not substitute for scholarship. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
