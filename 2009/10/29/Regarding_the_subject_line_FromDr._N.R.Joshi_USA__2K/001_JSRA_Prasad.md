With high regards to Dr. Joshi, I just second your suggestion.  
Further, it would be nice if all of us post to the relevant  
threads while replying/querying.  
  
Sincerely,  
Prasad

\> \> There is no inscription of his saying Indians were his cousins. However there are inscriptions in Iranian mountains of Cyrus the Great (Kurosh or Kuruh) calling himself Kshatriya. Moreover there are so many books on the ancient Persian Empire, anybody can find information . I read many books so I also read about his activity of expanding empire. It is Darius the Great expanded empire up to lower Sindhu. This satrapy was called Hindus. Next satrapy was Harahati (Sarasvati) and eighteen more satrapies. Persian wars with Greece were going on for two hundred years from 539 BC t0 326 BC. In Xerex's pan Asian army marching towards Greece, the contingent of chariots belonged to Indians. Army was marching for two months. Xerexes was standing in the chariot of white horses.People were sitting on trees by the side of roads to watch march of Persian army . This looked like mini-Mahabharat of known history.
Darius III sent message to Indians from Gandhar to come to his help against Alexander's march towards east. Unfortunately Indians did not go. As a result of neglecting our ancient brothers, Alexander reached Porus kingdom. People fighting with Alexander in eastern Afghanistan were Shakas, Bactrians (Vaahlikas of Mahabharat), Panchalas and Kambojas. It is your choice to make Mahabharat Maha over Asia or mini in the villages of Uttar Prades and Haryana. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
