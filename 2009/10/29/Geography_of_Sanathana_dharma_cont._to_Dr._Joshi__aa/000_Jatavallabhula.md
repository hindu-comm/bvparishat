Hello scholars,  
I have uploaded a documented titled Jambudvipa - planet Earth part I.  
As per bhagavatam the Himalaya is actually the name of a tectonic  
plate (Indian plate in modern science) which ranges from east to west.  
Kuru is the name given to the arabian continent.  
  
It is very interesting to read into Dr. Joshi posts and to understand  
the map based on the above mentioned article. It would be great if  
experts in the field of bharata and ramayana read the document and  
give us some info on the geography of kings of bharata.  
  
Thanks  
Ravi
