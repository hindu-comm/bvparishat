to tell in brief i have a small idea of what that software does though not complete.  
  
it has two parts. first is indexing. and next is searching  
indexing means initially you need to place all the sanskrit books and articles in some folder or any where u like and run this indexing part. it will store all the info about the book in some place of its own. will see and tell you how to run it later sometime.  
you can also index websites web-pages anything related.  
  
next whenever you want to search something u need to run this search part. u should give a phrase or lines of shlokas or some word and this will search the previously stored index and give the list of line-numbers/books/page-number/websites-links as you require.  
  
this is how it works overall. but i think it needs java to run it. so will see to it as quikly as possible and let you know.  
  
in the mail u fwded. somebody mentioned about stemming and all. those are very complicated issues. stemming in general means breaking a word into its base word. for example the words appartment, appart can be stemmed to part as its base word. this and all can be programmed as we require in later stages.  
  
Thanks & Regards,
