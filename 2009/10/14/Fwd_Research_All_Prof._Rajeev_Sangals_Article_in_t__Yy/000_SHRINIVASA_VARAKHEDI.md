FYI. We should think of one with a new integrated syllabi (indian

Planning a new model for varsities of the future

In the proposed model of Not-for-Profit Public Private Partnership,  
varsities have a great degree of autonomy but function with public  
purpose close to the heart

There is much discussion on the form and organisation of universities  
in India today. This article tries to identify some essential elements  
in the design of new universities of the future which address many of  
the concerns being discussed today. They can also be incorporated to  
varying degree in the existing universities.

Indian higher education has seen two broad models: government  
institutions and private institutions. The former model has been  
largely applied to the universities and the latter to colleges. We  
hear a lot of misgivings about institutions in both the models,  
leaving aside a few elite institutions in each.

The key enabling elements of the proposed model are autonomy with  
accountability. In the proposed model, the institution has a great  
amount of autonomy (like a private institution) but functions with  
public purpose (like a government institution). It also has some other  
characteristics which will not be discussed here, such as a sense of  
ownership with gratitude among its stake holders, and functioning  
efficiently using technology.

The new model

The model proposed here is such that neither the government nor the  
private partners have direct control over the university. Moreover,  
enlightened elements from academia are brought in to have a say and  
run the institution.

The university in the new model would have a governing board  
consisting of members from government, industry, academia and socially  
conscious sections of society.

The governing body is empowered to take all decisions including the  
appointment of the chairman of the board (or chancellor) and the  
director (or vice-chancellor) of the university.

To get real autonomy, this is necessary but not sufficient. The  
university must also raise its own finances. However, a quick  
calculation would show that whereas it is possible to raise operating  
expenses for running the institution which offers professional  
programmes, the capital expenses must come from elsewhere. And in  
fact, if the institution wishes to do research, which universities  
must do, then it becomes even more difficult to raise all the  
resources.

In the new model proposed here, the government and the private  
industry contribute capital to create the institution, and thereafter  
the institution must run on its own (except for occasional inputs to  
expand the infrastructure).

Thus, other than the initial grants from government and contribution  
from industry partners, the institution has complete financial  
autonomy. Its governing board is empowered to set the faculty  
salaries, make its own procedures, define its own admission criteria,  
set the student fee, etc.

The operational and academic autonomy comes with the board overseeing  
that it is done not with profit motive but public purpose.

Excellence

Academics with public purpose has to be carried out within the  
financial resources and with high standards or excellence. The three  
elements: (1) academics with public purpose, (2) academic excellence,  
and (3) financial resources have to be woven together to fulfil the  
objectives set for itself by the institution.

The three elements have to synergise with one another, where one  
supports or enhances the other.

For example, as the institution produces new research, it looks for  
socially useful ways to apply it; when it identifies problems faced by  
society, it orients its academics (that is, its teaching and R&D) to  
find solutions for it; when it feels the need for finances, it takes  
up activities that are socially useful and academically sound. It is  
this synergy among the three elements which adds vitality to an  
institution. And it is best achieved by an institution endowed with  
autonomy and social and academic responsibility.

The longer term goal setting and accountability towards society comes  
through the governing board which has enlightened sections of society  
besides government and industry.

They see to it that the institution follows its long-term vision of  
fulfilling its public purpose.

The board is free to decide what areas the institution should  
concentrate on, what methods to adopt to achieve the goals in each  
area, and what steps or procedures to follow for effective  
functioning.

For example, an institution might concentrate on basic research as  
opposed to applied research, or choose to work on wind energy as  
opposed to solar energy, or engage with enhancing education in nearby  
colleges.

Indeed the purpose of autonomy is to be able to deal with issues in  
its local context more effectively, and to serve the public purpose by  
taking advantage of the local conditions on the one hand, and its  
capability on the other.

It is hoped that constraints that come in autonomous functioning of  
government universities would not be present; whereas the dilution of  
social goals for pecuniary ones, which occurs in purely private  
institutions, does not happen.

Incidentally, a vital part of academics is to develop its students  
into sensitive and socially conscious human beings. This is best done  
in a setting of public purpose, and not in one of private profit.  
Though the aspect of character building might be getting ignored at  
the moment, by both governmental institutions as well as private ones,  
it will come on the agenda in the future.

Finances

From where would the finances come, to create and run the institution?  
It has already been mentioned earlier, that the government and the  
private sector must come forward to pay for capital infrastructure. As  
the purpose of the university is public, government may have to come  
up with a larger share.

Why would a private partner come forward to contribute as there are no  
monetary benefits?

It would come forward because it would be able to play a role in  
shaping it. The institution would remain, however, a public  
institution. (Philanthropy can pay fully for the cost of creating  
infrastructure of the institution, and there are notable instances of  
it in the past, for example IISc Bangalore and BITS Pilani.

This may happen again, if the right approach is taken, and true  
philanthropists feel encouraged to come forward.)

If the capital expenditure is paid for, can the operating expenditure  
be met from its activities related to academics? What would be the  
sources of revenue to meet the operating expenses?

The main sources of revenue in the current situation would be three  
fold: tuition, sponsored research and endowments.

Initially the endowments are likely to be small, say, contributing 5  
per cent of the total revenue or less. The ratio of tuition revenue  
and research funds is an indicator whether it is a largely teaching  
university or a largely research university.

The contribution of R&D revenue could vary from 10% to 40%, which  
could come from government funded research and industry funded  
development projects.

No utopian model

Some might feel that the design proposed here is utopian, and would  
not work in practice. What has been proposed here has been implemented  
and is already operating at IIIT Hyderabad, a research university.

Infrastructure, including land and buildings, were given by Andhra  
Pradesh Government. Private contributions came from companies which  
the Andhra Pradesh government was able to persuade. The institution is  
run by an autonomous governing board setting a high public service  
agenda with very high academic goals.

Because of its autonomous structure, it has been able to weave  
research and academics together through innovative programmes leading  
to the building of the large research groups in the country in several  
areas in Computer Science and Electronics and Communications  
Engineering. There is a need to setup more universities under the  
N-PPP model through the participation of government and industry.

Charged with the responsibility of nurturing excellence in teaching  
and R&D, together with public purpose and the right amount of pressure  
regarding finances (namely, raising its operational expenses) can help  
create new truly autonomous and agile universities of the future. Lead  
needs to be taken by the Central government in this regard.
