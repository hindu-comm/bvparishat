Namaste to great scholars! I am working on a project and I am looking  
for the english translation of Sayana Bhashyam of Purush sukta. I am  
finding sanskrit versions but no translated version of Sayana  
bhashyam. I am able to translate upto 80% but I cannot double check  
against any source.  
  
Any soft copy is great help!  
  
Please Help!!
