Dear Friend,  
Namaste.Our births are due to our past good and bad deeds.This is karma  
theory.This is proved by the soliloquy of the babe in the belly as per the wording in the scriptures.For a practical proof we have to listen to the voice of the babe through any hearing device if it exists in the medical technology like the scanning device testing the sex which is of course now prohibited.We can take the voice of the babe as proof for the births that are due to our good or bad deeds.This is my view.  
With Regards,  
I.V.N.Acharya.([ivi...@yahoo.co.in]())
