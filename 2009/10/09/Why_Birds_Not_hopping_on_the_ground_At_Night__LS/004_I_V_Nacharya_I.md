Dear Sri Prasad Garu,  
Namaskaramulu.Thank you for reading my Email.If it is experimented through the modern instruments of the medical technology I think karma  
theory can be understood well (as in the case of Scanning) with hearing technical instruments from within the belly.Garuda differs from syena here in this context,I think.Birds'hopping also has to be experimented thru the method of observation.  
With Regards,  
I.V.N.Acharya.\<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>
