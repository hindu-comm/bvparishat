Dear Shri Acharya garu,  
  
Thanks for the nice explanation of the word '*agni*', but, is the word *garuda* same with as *syena*?  
I could not follow entire Vedic verse on the reason for birds not hopping on the ground at night. Also, in your earlier  
mail, you gave good information on the foetal development, its feelings and knowledge of earlier births. One problem  
with modern medical science is that we can't convince them about the knowledge of karma in a foetus.
