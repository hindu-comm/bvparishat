Kuru and Kamboja of Mahabharatain Persia in the known history

The king Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II) established the Persian Empire around 539 BC. His name was Kurosh in the Iranian pronunciation. But his son's name was Kyambaje which is clearly Kamboja. This pair of names became honorific and hence was repeated in next two generations and one generation before the Cyrus the Great. Many archaeologists including late Dr. Ernst Herzfeld connected them to the Indian Kurus and Kambojas. We all know that Kurus and Kambojas were the main dynasties in the epic Mahabharat. Now how to reconcile this known history with ancient history? We do not find any Kurus or Kambojas in the known history in the subcontinent. At the most they appear opposing Alexander of Macedonia in the eastern Afghanistan. If we believe the ancient Indraprastha was near Purana Kila (near Delhi) and Hastinapur even east of that location, then how come we find them in Persia in 539 BC and not inside the subcontinent?During expansion of his empire when Cyrus the Great reached Para-upari-shyena-mountain range (in eastern Afghanistan), he told his soldiers that this was the natural boundary of our empire and beyond in the east our cousin brothers lived. Cyrus the Great was not zoroastrian, Daurius was. How to reconcile these facts? What do scholars think?
