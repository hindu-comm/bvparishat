Hello Dr. Joshi,  
Excellent Post. Kuru kings in India actually came from Uttar Kuru,  
which we can place around Saudi Arabia. I have written an article  
interpreting the Bhagavatam slokas which identify the Earth plates and  
continents. Please read it. File name Jambudvipa - Part I. YOu can  
find the file under files section  
Thanks  
Ravi
