Dear Friend,

We invite you to the Jeevan Vidya shivir, (an educational workshop) to be  
held from 20th-Dec to 27th-Dec 2009 (both days inclusive) at IIIT  
Hyderabad. The shivir is a platform for discussing a wide range of issues  
like Education, Reality, Happiness, Success, Aspirations and gaining an  
understanding on Our Nature, Relationships, Environment, Social Issues,  
and Self-Confidence. Do they sound relevant to you? In the shivir we will  
have a detailed and lengthy discussion on these, and in the process try to  
find a holistic and sustainable solution in the light of Jeevan Vidya.

A note is attached about what a philosophy must include and how we can  
evaluate a philosophy. This note will help in getting an idea of the  
Jeevan Vidya philosophy, and will also throw light on the kind of workshop  
one may expect. Please spend your valuable time in reading the note.
