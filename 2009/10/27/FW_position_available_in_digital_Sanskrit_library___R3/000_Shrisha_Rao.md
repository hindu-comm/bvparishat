Subject: position available in digital Sanskrit library project  
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 2009 23:16:54 -0400

Dear Colleagues,  
Please bring the following to the attention of qualified  
applicants:

Brown University seeks a post-doctoral research associate or doctoral  
research assistant to to work in a digital Sanskrit library project.  
The position requires advanced training in Sanskrit, academic research  
skills, and competence in working with XML and TeX.

The Sanskrit Library is a collaborative project to make the heritage  
texts of India accessible on the web. The project is building a  
digital Sanskrit library by integrating texts, linguistic software,  
and digital Sanskrit lexical sources. This year the project is making  
digital images of manuscripts of the Mahabharata and Bhagavatapurana  
housed at Brown University and the Universityof Pennsylvania and  
linking them with the corresponding machine-readable texts. Extending  
the scope of linguistic software to these digital images serves as a  
pilot project to demonstrate the feasibility of doing so with  
manuscript images generally.

One qualification that will be of particular value is a high degree of  
competence in working with TeX and the ability to set up a environment  
to reproduce the print-ready copy of a nearly completed book typeset  
with TeX on a different machine. This will involve locating and  
collecting scattered packages used in order to produce the print-ready  
copy properly from the existing TeXfile. The existing version of the  
book was produced using the virtual terminal command-line TeX command  
and ran TeX (Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.6)) under the Unix operating  
system on a Mac G4.

Brown University is an equal-opportunity employer. Women and  
minorities are particularly encouraged to apply.

Please let me know of your interest by sending a resum√© to me at the  
address below, preferably by email.

Yours,  
Peter Scharf
