Regards to all: I am writing a brief view about the Saktis. Abhidhaa is a simple and most natural expression of the meaning made by God. ( Isvarodvhaavitaa) whereas the Laksanaa is an artificial expression which is not natural but made by man. Vyanjanaa is a concealed expression which conveys different meanings in different contexts and different persons. It may be related to the wordused by ther speaker or the meaning arbitrarily drawn out of the context or by the person. It is not necessary to get the meaning siitatva and paavanatva from Gangaayaam ghosah. A person may get the romantic meaning whereas an ascetic may get the purity for the peanances or a mad man a good placeto commit
suicide. It shall vary from person to person. It is the stand of the aesthetes who draw the meaning by concealing a meaning which is not directly understood by the other person. So it is a concealed expression and not a universal expression of meaning which is got by  
Abhidha. There is a philosophical background. If we accept laksana and vyanjanaa in the Veda, it shall become apauruseya. That is why the concept of Isvarodbhaavitaa and anudbhaavitaa powers were conceived. Laksana and vyanjanaa shall not be operative on the Vedic expressions or Vedic literature. How to get the meaning in the Veda? Here the power of taatparya was evolved which means: the meaning intended. ( tat+ para). That is, it conveys the meaning which is intended by Veda. We cannot make any change through Laksana and vyanjanaa. This power was not intended by the earlier Jains also who accept the Laksana and vyanjanaa as fraudulent expressions. In the  
Acarangasuutra, even the expressions like devovarsati is not accepted. They believe that you should say: gangaatate ghosah or gangaayaam siitatvam paavanatvamasti and should not accept the Laksana and vyanjaa. It was later on accepted by Siddhicandragani in Kavyaprakasakhandanam. In medieval ages, all the systems of philosophy including the Mimamsakas and Jainas accepted these powers and were not clear over Taatparya. Taatparya was intended to accept Veda as a creation of God which differentiated it from the creation of human. Abhidhaa may be equated with Taatparya whereas other power of words became different. I should be enlightened with evidence to clarify the issue. SP Narang
