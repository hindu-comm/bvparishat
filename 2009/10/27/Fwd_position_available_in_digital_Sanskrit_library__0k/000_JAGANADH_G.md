Dear Colleagues,

Please let me know of your interest in the position described below or bring the it to the attention of qualified applicants:

  

Brown University seeks a post-doctoral research associate or doctoral research assistant to to work in a digital Sanskrit library project.
The position requires advanced training in Sanskrit, academic research skills, and competence in working with XML and TeX.

  

The Sanskrit Library is a collaborative project to make the heritage texts of India accessible on the web. The project is building a digital Sanskrit library by integrating texts, linguistic software, and digital Sanskrit lexical sources. This year the project is making digital images of manuscripts of the Mahabharata and Bhagavatapurana housed at Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania and linking them with the corresponding machine-readable texts. Extending the scope of linguistic software to these digital images serves as a pilot project to demonstrate the feasibility of doing so with manuscript images generally.

  

One qualification that will be of particular value is a high degree of competence in working with TeX and the ability to set up a environment to reproduce the print-ready copy of a nearly completed book typeset with TeX on a different machine. This will involve locating and collecting scattered packages used in order to produce the print-ready copy properly from the existing TeX file. The existing version of the book was produced using the virtual terminal command-line TeX command and ran TeX (Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.6)) under the Unix operating system on a Mac G4.

  

Brown University is an equal-opportunity employer. Women and minorities are particularly encouraged to apply.

  

Please let me know of your interest by sending a resum√© to me at the address below, preferably by email.

  

Yours,

Peter Scharf
