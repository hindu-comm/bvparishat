Dear all,

  
I have translated my posting into English with some modification making good some laps in the Sanskrit posting. Though my translation would not serve a good analysis of the scene of Tatparya as function of word, or the intention of the speaker according to different schools of Indian thinkers, I have tried to give a brief outline mainly based on the writers in poetics.

> *Trayo hy atra vyāpārāḥ saṃbhāvyante - padārtheṣusāmānyātmasu > abhidhāvyāpāraḥ,* >
> *sāmmānyāpekṣayā arthāvagamanaśaktir hyabhidhā\| samayaśca tāvatyeva > na viśeṣāṁśe\| ..........* >
> **tato viśeṣarūpe vākyārthe tātparyaśaktiḥ parasparānvite > sāmānyānyathāsiddherviśeṣaṁ gamayanti hi iti nyāyāt** >
> *........... ......................* >
> *bhaktirhi lakṣaṇāvyāpārastṛtīyakakṣyāniveśī ...... ..* >
> *caturthyāṁ tu kakṣyāyāṁ dhvananavyāpāraḥ* >
> (Locana p.16 )

  

The above extract from Locana would make clear his opinion on it. Since the translation ran into 5 pages in word document, I am attaching it here to this message.

  

Sorry for the convenience

  

Among the corrections, I have to request to read PrabhakaraaNaam suppressed in the 1st paragraph, as it does not relate to Abhihitaanvayavadinaam. But to the next Anvitaabhidhaanavadinaye. in the sanskrit portion. Among other omissions, the word VaniiShu is missing in the quotation from Dhvanyaloka, and vapuShi svadateis the correction in the quotation from Bhoja.
