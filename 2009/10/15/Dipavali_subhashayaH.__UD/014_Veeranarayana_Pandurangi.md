Respected madam,

I thought that you suggested to write to The Hindu, Newyork edition's open page (if New York existed, we dont know). I think it is a better way to change public opinion. for this type of books it is much needed to publish reviews in massmedia, though I agree there is an acute need of academic reviews in journals.
