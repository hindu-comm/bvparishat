Greetings.

I wonder if scholars here are aware of and have read the recent book  
"The Hindus: An Alternative History" by Wendy Doniger (I have not seen  
the book yet). The reviews of the book in the Washington Post and the  
NY Times are generally laudatory:

<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/18/AR2009031803924.html>

The reader reviews on Amazon are far less so, perhaps reflecting the  
views of Indians of Doniger's past work also:
