Thanks dr. Rao for bringing this very important thing to our notice, otherwise we would have missed it.

  

as you noted few like you read newyork times or washington post. forget these american papers I dont get even "the hindu" in the village I live.

  

now we can say, after reading the two reviews, "**good wishes**" to all on the occasion of "**not so happy deepavali**".

  

it seems these people have taken the language at their hand to interpret it at their whims and fancies.

  

to quote the W.post \<Doniger underscores the crassness of Rama's jealous-husband behavior but also notes certain textual hints that Sita is more sexual than she appears and that her feelings for Rama's brother Lakshmana might well be more than familial.\> but she should substantiate such claims by quoting what valmiki writes.

  

offcourse it is important to unravel the mysteries of modern urban gods like santoshi ma etc.

Butit seems these people try to use typical american ways to fame while stereotyping their old foes "the british colonialists" of misinterpreting the India in the light of unified hinduism. it is not right to blame british-brahmin gang for this misinterpretation. infact no such gang existed ever.

  

to quote NYTimes reveiwer \<As Wendy Doniger, a scholar of Indian religions at

the[University of Chicago](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_chicago/index.html?inline=nyt-org "More articles about the University of Chicago."), explains in her staggeringly comprehensive book,the British Indologists who sought to tame India’s chaotic polytheisms had a “Protestant bias in favor of scripture.” In “privileging” Sanskrit over local languages, she writes, they created what has proved to be an enduring impression of a “unified Hinduism.” And they found keen collaborators among upper-caste Indian scholars and translators. This British-Brahmin version of Hinduism — one of the many invented traditions born around the world in the 18th and 19th centuries — has continued to find many takers among semi-Westernized Hindus suffering from an inferiority complex vis-à-vis the apparently more successful and organized religions of Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\>

  

Most of the desi learned (to use american style) brahmins without the knowledge of english never knew what these british indologists did. Nietherbritish indologists had any role in inventing this type of hinduism. instead they wanted to degrade this hinduism. but only some of modern reformers like may be like Vivekananda tried to upgrade hinduism in west and many of their deciples interpreted hinduism in their own way. that is only what happened. for the ordinary hindu (say brahmin+) hinduism was always a tailor made shirts according to their own individual interest or proximity to one or the other sects (devotional or any other sect \[I prefer sect than than cult\]). 

**It is unfortunate** that anybody (say british) with superficial knowledge of hinduism wrote a book in English, but those who were really good chose to remain silent except John Woodroffe who wrote on tantra.

  

NYTimes \<Though the potted biographies of Mughal emperors seem superfluous in a long book, Doniger’s chapter on the centuries of Muslim rule over India helps dilute the lurid mythology of Hindu nationalists. Motivated by realpolitik rather than religious fundamentalism, the Mughals destroyed temples; **they also built and patronized them**. Not only is there “**no evidence of massive coercive conversion**” to Islam, but also so much of what we know as popular Hinduism — the currently popular devotional cults of Rama and Krishna, the network of pilgrimages, ashrams and sects — acquired its distinctive form during Mughal rule.\>

  

these statements would be equal only to the denial of holocaust. it is a wonder she faced only unharmfull egg somewhere else. What about the people of Kashmir, bengal, malabar? did they accept islam volunteerly? very sad.

  

But Doniger is absolutely right in saying thatthe "**network of pilgrimages, ashrams and sects — acquired its distinctive form during Mughal rule**". really she is correct in using word "distinctive form". this form is "**Jatiya"** the tax levied by mughals onpiligrims which is still current in invisible form. can she show any such instance of patronage of hindu temples by mughals?

  

"popular Hinduism — the currently popular devotional cults of Rama and Krishna, the network of pilgrimages, ashrams and sects — acquired its distinctive form during Mughal rule"yes off course. but what was the mughal role in that? did either akbar patronize Tulasidas who wrote Manas? or patronize kabir or any other akhadas or shankaracharya mathas in india that organised religion in that time?

  

it is the first time that any american scholar is making such stupid statements in the time of realpolitik (to use her style) of narayanamurthy etc.

  

with apologies for being too long and good wishes of deepaavali to all on this form
