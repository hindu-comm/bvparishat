Thanks for explicit concerns of fellow members about the mails and  
their topics of the list. Suggestion from Jagannath G is to be noted  
by ALL. These are the general principles of e-mail list. Kindly try to  
follow them as much as possible.  
  
At the same time, since this list is a scholarly one and meant for  
scholarly interaction, it is good to keep threads interesting.  
Greetings are NOT prohibited. Let us exchange Greetings. However, they  
can find place in one single thread (NOT personal ones). Otherwise,  
scholars may lose interest in participation.  
  
Please list is OWNED by NONE. It is yours. Scholars must nourish this.  
  
Good questions and debates are appreciated. This list ENCOURAGES to  
write in SANSKRIT also.  
  
We are also preparing some guidelines for this list also. Any member  
interested in this task may come forward to complete this job.  
  
WE HAVE HIGH REGARDS TO ALL SCHOLARS PARTICIPATING IN THE LIST. THESE  
ARE NOT PERSONAL COMMENTS AGAINST ANYBODY. IF anybody is hurt, kindly  
excuse us.  
  
warm regards,  
shrivara
