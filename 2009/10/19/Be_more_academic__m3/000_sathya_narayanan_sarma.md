Dear members of the Vidvat pariShad,  
Please enough of sending greetings and wishes. Let us learnand share our unknown views, ideas with learned scholars.  
This is a research forum. Many senior and  
experienced scholars are available here. We must utilize their  
expertise.  
I don't say sending the greetings and wishes are wrong, that can be made with their respective personal id-s.  
Sorry i am not having any intention of hurting any *vidwajjana*.  
  
ittham bhavadiiyaH  
Dr. Sathyanarayna, R.
