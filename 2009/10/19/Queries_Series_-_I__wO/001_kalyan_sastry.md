sir,  
  
the answer to this question may be found if we look into the  
Pratyaksha AYAM VIBHAKTAH.the Pratyaksha vishyatvam of the above  
knowledge is of a BHAVA PADARTHA..not of an absence matter.Well,this  
is what comes to my mind when i first saw the question.  
  
i am still looking for a more elaborate and lucid answer for this.i  
will try referring some books and definitely try to answer..  
  
i have another query..  
  
i recently started reading the book MATERIALS FOR THE STUDY OF NAVYA  
NYAYA LOGIC by H.H.INGHALLS.i stumbled upon a certain sentence which  
left me perplexed.In the bibliographic notes about RAGHUNATHA SIRIMANI  
the author says " I know there is no evidence to disprove the  
tradition recorded that Raghunatha never married.The tradition also  
adds that he would say to those who questioned him about it, "One  
marries to get sons and daughters.VYUTPATTIVADA is my son and LILAVATA  
is my daughter.Thus,without marriage i have received the fruits of  
marriage"" (SEC 1,bibliographic notes , PG-16 ,lines 1-5 )  
  
now we all know tht VYUTPATTIVADA is an independent work of  
GADADHARA BHATTACHARYA.Hence how can the above sentence make sense ??  
Is there any work of Raghunatha entitled VYUTPATTIVADA??? Can anyone  
elaborate on this ?  
  
thanks..
