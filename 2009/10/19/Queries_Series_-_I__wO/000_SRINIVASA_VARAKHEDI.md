Dear Scholars,  
  
In the beginning of the list, Prof. PK.Dixit and others used to ask  
some tricky questions related to Shastras. Lat is start such activity.  
  
To start with I ask a simple question that was asked by students at  
IIIT HYD during my lectures.  
  
Vaisheshikas admit twenty four qualities among which "Paratva and  
Aparatva" are also members. Let us have "paratva" in the list of  
qualities not the "aparatva" also. "aparatva" can be the absence  
(abhaava) of paratva. What could be the answer ?  
  
Similar logic can be extended to "Vibhaaga" also. It can be admitted  
as 'abhaava' of samyoga!  
  
regards,  
shrivara
