Dear Kalyan,  
  
thanks for your wise reply...  

  
\> the answer to this question may be found if we look into the  
\> Pratyaksha AYAM VIBHAKTAH.the Pratyaksha vishyatvam of the above  
\> knowledge is of a BHAVA PADARTHA..not of an absence matter.Well,this  
\> is what comes to my mind when i first saw the question.  
  

Still, the cognition "Ghato Bhavishyati", though it is not negetive in  
form, objectifies "prior-absence" of Ghata. Same logic apply here.

Good, come with a strong answer. I wish you will answer another  
question too.  

  
\> i have another query..  
\> i recently started reading the book MATERIALS FOR THE STUDY OF NAVYA  
\> NYAYA LOGIC by H.H.INGHALLS.i stumbled upon a certain sentence which  
\> left me perplexed.In the bibliographic notes about RAGHUNATHA SIRIMANI  
\> the author says " I know there is no evidence to disprove the  
\> tradition recorded that Raghunatha never married.The tradition also  
\> adds that he would say to those who questioned him about it, "One  
\> marries to get sons and daughters.VYUTPATTIVADA is my son and LILAVATA  
\> is my daughter.Thus,without marriage i have received the fruits of  
\> marriage"" (SEC 1,bibliographic notes , PG-16 ,lines 1-5 )  
  
    now we all know tht VYUTPATTIVADA is an independent work of  
\> GADADHARA BHATTACHARYA.Hence how can the above sentence make sense ??  
\> Is there any work of Raghunatha entitled VYUTPATTIVADA??? Can anyone  
\> elaborate on this ?  
  

I am doubtful whether this story refers to Raghunatha shiromani. Pl  
check once again - is this story is recorded with reference to  
Raghunatha Shiromani. We have two more Raghunatha in Nyaya History. I  
will write about them in detail.  
  
regards,  
shrivara  
\> thanks..
