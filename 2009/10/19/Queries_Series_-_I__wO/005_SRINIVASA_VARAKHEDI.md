Dear Sri Sachchidananda Ji,

Namaskara. and thanks for your reply.

\> Aparatva cannot be regarded as an absence of paratva because in one  
\> substance there are two paratva and aparatva. Let us take one example here--  
\> from Varanasi Delhi is farther therefore in Delhi there is paratva, in  
\> Lucknow there is aparatva. But if we take another example in Allahabad there  
\> is aparatva and in relation to Allahabad there is paratva in Lucknow.

Yet, i can say - वाराणस्यां देहली-अवधिक-परत्वे सत्यपि लखनउ-अवधिक-  
परत्वं न । एतदेव अपरत्वं नाम ।

\> The same case applies to Vibhaga too. In addition to there is another  
\> problem. Vibhaga is destroyer quality of Samyoga संयोगनाशको गुणो विभागः If  
\> we accept that Vibhaga is absence of Samyoga how samyoga will be destroyed?

Let us admit - Kriya is the cause for destruction of Samyoga (As it is  
admitted to be the cause for generation of Samyoga)
