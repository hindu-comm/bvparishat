Dear Varkhediji,  

Aparatva cannot be regarded as an absence of paratva because in one substance there are two paratva and aparatva. Let us take one example here--

from Varanasi Delhi is farther therefore in Delhi there is paratva, in Lucknow there is aparatva. But if we take another example in Allahabad there is aparatva and in relation to Allahabad there is paratva in Lucknow.

The same case applies to Vibhaga too. In addition to there is another problem. Vibhaga is destroyer quality of Samyoga संयोगनाशको गुणो विभागः If we accept that Vibhaga is absence of Samyoga how samyoga will be destroyed?
