Regards to all the scholars. We say Sanskrit is most useful for computer. Why we have not used anything for the development of computer-science in practice? Can any programme help to translate into Sanskrit? It may be Panini Grammar or deeper structure of Sabdabodha process or the science of etymology. Can I suggest that for translation we should convert our grammatical categories to numerals and go further like Ranganathan system of library science from and to Sanskrit. For a few fields i had been doing and getting good results than any other system of analysis. The subject can be discussed and analysed further by scholars. Of course, the procedure may be longer and difficult but we can get better results than the existing shastras. Please discuss and think on these lines. Method may be yours and the lines may be numerals. Regards, SP Narang
