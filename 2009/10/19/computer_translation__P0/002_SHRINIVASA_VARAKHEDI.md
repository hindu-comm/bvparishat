Dear Sir,

Please note that if you have ms-word 2007 with you, you may directly  
input the text in unicode. unicode documents are supported  
universally. Pl try and let us know.

If you enable sanskrit key board manager / Baraha key manager for  
sanskrit you may be able to type directly on input box of gmail/yahoo  
or any other mail service provider.

अत्र मया देवनागर्यां उट्टङ्कितं - पश्यत ।

with regards,  
shrivara
