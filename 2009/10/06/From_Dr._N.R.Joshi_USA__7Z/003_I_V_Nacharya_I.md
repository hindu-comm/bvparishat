Respected scholars,  
praNamyA.What our scholar friend (Dr.Sri Joshi Ji) said is correct when  
the issue is viewed pragmatically.In India & even out-side India we have to enlist the co-operation of the Govts & the public and see that it is encouraged in the educational institutions or in the present sanskrit spoken centres set up far & wide with zeal and perseverance.No doubt,it is Herculean task.Yet,we have to strive within our means to unfold the treasure in sanskrit irrespective of whether it may fetch or  
may not fetch us financially.This is my view.Views may differ.  
With Regards,  
I.V.N.Acharya.\<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>
