Respected Scholar Friends,  
praNaamAH.Nothing is irrelevant in this world."AmantraM aksharaM naasti,  
naasti mUlamanOUShadhaM,ayOgyAH puruShO naasti,yOjakAH tatrA durlabhAH."we are the citizens of the entire universe.We travel between the earth and the Heaven.Our kings in the past like Dileepa travelled so.We are in 1/4th part of the universe.3/4 part is up above in the sky  
beyond our reach.Sanskrit is the language of the universe irrespective of whether it is spoken or not through out or whether it is recognised or not.What we experience thru our senses in the world of five elements  
have got the references in our scriptures.When we are aware of certain facts like these nothing will look like irrelevant.This is my view.Views may differ.  
Regards,I.V.N.\<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>
