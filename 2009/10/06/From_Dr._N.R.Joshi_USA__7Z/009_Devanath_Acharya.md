\> Dear friends in this group  
\>  
\> When i read this i feel that i have to add something:  
\>  
\> "The Vedas are eternal. They are without beginning and end. An  
\> ignorant man, may say how a book can be without beginning or end. By  
\> the Vedas, no books are meant. Vedas came out of the breath of the  
\> Lord. They are not the composition of any human mind. They were never  
\> written, never created. They are eternal and impersonal. The date of  
\> the Vedas has never been fixed. It can never be fixed. Vedas are  
\> eternal spiritual truths. Vedas are an embodiment of divine knowledge.  
\> The books may be destroyed, but the knowledge cannot be destroyed.  
\> Knowledge is eternal. In that sense, the Vedas are eternal."  
\>  
\> "Live in the spirit of the teachings of the Vedas. Learn to  
\> discriminate between the permanent and the impermanent. Behold the  
\> Self in all beings, in all objects. Names and forms are illusory.  
\> Therefore sublate them. Feel that there is nothing but the Self. Share  
\> what you have,-physical, mental, moral or spiritual,-with all. Serve  
\> the Self in all. Feel when you serve others, that you are serving your  
\> own Self. Love thy neighbour as thyself. Melt all illusory  
\> differences. Remove all barriers that separate man from man. Mix with  
\> all. Embrace all. Destroy the sex-idea and body-idea by constantly  
\> thinking of the Self or the sexless, bodiless Atman. Fix the mind on  
\> the Self when you work. This is the essence of the teachings of the  
\> Vedas and sages of yore. This is real, eternal life in Atman. Put  
\> these things in practice in the daily battle of life. You will shine  
\> as a dynamic Yogi or a Jivanmukta. There is no doubt of this."  
\>  
\> -Swami Sivananda
