Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Deepavali Shubhecchaa for coming Deepavali season.

Incentive to study Sanskrit by N. R. Joshi

(1)To my question of incentive to study Sanskrit few weeks back on this list, I received many good answers from Sanskrit scholars. One reason forwarded by respected Acharya was Sanskritas Divine language. Although such respect to the language within the framework of India may appear to be appropriate, it does not hold much ground outside of India in the world. This is because Arabs think that their language is divine because it is the language of their holy book Koran. Jews believe that their language Hebrew is divine because it is the language of their holy book.

Within India, look at the views of Abhinava Gupta. If language is a mirror of (metaphysical) reality, it cannot be limited to Sanskrit and Abhinava Gupta is quite conscious of it. He says Pali of Buddhists or languages of south India are not less divine if they express the instinctive feelings of heart.

(2)Next it was mentioned that Sanskrit should be studied for “Sheela Vardhanam”

My simple question: Can Sanskrit stop the sewage pipeline from Hollywood to Bollywood? Could Sanskrit scholars of India persuade Bollywood to use at least three Sanskrit words “ Suswāgatam, Madhyantar and Samāpta” on screen?

(3) Next Vishvarupa of the ancient Sanskrit literature was presented. The question is which language has Vishvarupa today? Sanskrit or English?

My answer: Utility must be the sole criterion. Show how Sanskrit is better than English in presenting modern scientific concepts. Put the stress on Technical Sanskrit. Enough of Naiyayikas and Vaisheshikas. Thanks.
