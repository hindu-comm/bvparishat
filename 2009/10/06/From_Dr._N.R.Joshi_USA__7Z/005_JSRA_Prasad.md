NamAmsi sAdaraM SarvebhyaH,  
  
Sri Joshi ji has undeniable concerns on the issue of incentives of universal Sanskrit.  
What I would like to say here is that as long as we speak in terms of secular, democratic, globalized and utilitarian aspects of the 'divine' language, there is no point. It is said that 'Be a Roman in Rome', then why cann't I be an Indian being in India? I don't regard whether a foreigner consider Sanskrit as divine or not. But, contemporarily, since I want my country designated as 'developed country', I forsake the above statement. Hence, I will only count on the inner divine reality.  
  
The word '*sheelam*' has a wider meaning, depending on one's perception, its interpretation of various of its meanings may vary. Good and evil equally are there in society since time immemorial. If one is '*sheelavaan*', and self restrained using the high ideals of Indian philosophy, then one's '*sheela*' is not injured by any means.  
  
Introducing Sanskrit words in to movies or the kind may be innovative. But that is not the sole criteria. Thank god! Atleast, Bajaj has used some Sanskrit sentences such as '*maargah avaruddhah asti, pratigamyataam*', etc., for their bike commercial,
(<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjRzLLSNmXQ>) though it is not to glorify Sanskrit.  
  
Shouting slogans of the well being of all, in Sanskrit is not exactly shouting. That phenomenon is digested by inheritance and that feeling is rocking the Sanskrit hearts. Whether these high ideals are working in India is a debatable issue. In this context, I feel, we can not take examples in movie and TV culture. There may be definitely some constructive suggestions from reputed scholars on the utilitarian aspects of Sanskrit in a globalized context as is attempted by Shri Acharya.  
  
Thanks,  
Dr. Prasad
