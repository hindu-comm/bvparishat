Dear scholar,  
Vedas cannot be understood so easily.One who believes in humanity, human mind and human understanding does not go for reasoning.The veda is supreme.there are great scholars who can explain u with a practical approch. The power of mantra creates vibrations in a man It is to be experienced.Any thing should not be commented without proper investigation .remember kalidasa's words " moodhaha para pratyayaneya buddhihi".
