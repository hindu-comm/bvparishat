Dear Shri Dr.JoShi Ji,  
namaskaarAH.It is true that the Mantras in this age of Kaliyuga will lose their effect 75%.1/4 effect still we find.Nyaya Kusumaanjali says,  
Dharma existed 100% in the age of KRutayuga,75% in Tretayuga,50% in Dwapara and now 25% only.Vedas may be Historical documents in the present historian'view.But there is still belief that they are eternal.  
Opinions may differ.Please enlighten me about the abbreviated  
"PIE"in your Email.  
Regards,  
I.V.N.\<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>
