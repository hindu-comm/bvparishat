 Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Vedas are just historical documents, nothing more!

I confronted a Sanskrit scholar from reputed institution from India. I said to him, "Vedic Mantras have no effect nowadays. Indians perform Yajnas for worldpeace chanting Vedic mantras. However no peace is produced by Yajnas in the world. Moreover the western indologists believe that some Vedic words were derived from PIE and hence they were not original words. So saving Vedas sound by sound using techniques like Ghana patha, Krama patha is nothing more than religious faith of certain Indians."

He replied "we view Vedas as historical document."

Thanks. N.R.Joshi
