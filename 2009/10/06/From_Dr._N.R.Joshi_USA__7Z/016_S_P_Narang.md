Vedic heritage a development of long spans of time and not a one-time expressions and exposition. sound and its magical expressions must be with "SaaksaatkRtadharman-s" and not with " asaaksaatfkRtadharman-s" to whom not only the magical sounds but even the meaning was lost. That is why the Vedangas were framed: records our tradition. ghanapaatha etc. are for the preservation of the texts and not for the magical expressions. Even in the Tantra traditions, the revelation was with the greatest Acaryas and not with the persons who had vested inerest in the subject. There is no doubt the exponants are having the force and others do follow the tradition with less or no force. It happened to Vedic tradition also. That is why the doctrine: anarthakaa mantraaH developed. a number of Vedic expressions are not known to the scholars like Roth because they belong to different local tradition or region: may be Kamboja or Hindukush. They must be investigated linguistically and with evidence. Even for the preservation of the tradition, one should become bahus'ruta and not alpas'ruta and ready to accept the sound change, if any, in the tradition. Our tradition developed so many norms which were originally in the Vedas or not. Let us investigate the true meaning in true spirit. Regards to all-- spnarang
