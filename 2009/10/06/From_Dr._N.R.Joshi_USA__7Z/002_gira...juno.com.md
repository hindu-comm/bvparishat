Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Let us drop nonworking high ideals by N.R.Joshi.

With full respect toI.V.N.AcharyaI would humbly like to submit here my thoughts.



It would be lot better for India if India drops quoting high sounding ideals. They do not work in practice within India and certainly not outside of India.



First- Yā vidyā sā vimuktaye.

Thousands of our highly qualified IIT graduates, doctors, computer professionals are seeking jobs in foreign countries not for liberation but for descent salaries and other facilities available in countries like USA. They are getting higher degrees to earn lot of money beyond bread and butter. This high ideal does not work. Sooner we drop it and offer education to create jobs in India, better we will be in future. Education is for getting jobs. Hindu mind is strange mixture that looks for liberation by paying few dollars to Dollar Gurus (one lands every week in Houston) and American Visa at the same time. Let us make that mind straight.



Second-Sarvepi Sukhinah Santu

The world does not care for blessings of shouting Indian Brahmins or Gurus. The world had exploited India in the past and many countries of the world have plans to exploit Indian resources in future. They never sing that Indians be happy. The earlier India deletes this empty blessing from temples, the better it would be to understand designs of next door enemies.



Third-Kŗiņvanto Viśvam āryam

This I call Indian Valgana. India has no control on their neighboring small countries. Why to boast about converting the world?



Let us think practical, teach practical and practice practical in every field including Sanskrit education.Thanks.
