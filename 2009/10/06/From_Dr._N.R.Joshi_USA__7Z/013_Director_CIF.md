Dear Sir,

I also very much shocked when I read the Vedas are just the historical document and mantras are not effected now-e-days.

I am fully agree with Sivanandaji and likewise thought. It is eternal(sanatana) and it requires only proper pronunciation with proper knowledge and meaning, it requires truth alongwith positive attitude which were seen and felt the seers and wisdom person at that time, now it is the science. Our thinking is not possitive but destructive.We do not carry out the vedic rules or sanatana paddhati in our life. We are changing our thinking and atmosphere according behaviuor. That is why, the vedas are kept in the show cases of Museum and Archives. Everysubtance has a history in its life including Vedas, but never it would be a historical document to show in the archives and museum. It requires deep research for establishingVedic science as a whole universe.



With thanks and regards
