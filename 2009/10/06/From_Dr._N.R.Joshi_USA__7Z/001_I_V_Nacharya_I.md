Dear Scholars,  
sarvEbhyAH praNamyA.  
Our Scholar friend Sri Joshi Ji puts a question-"How Sanskrit is better than English?"He lays stress on the utility as criterion.It seems he admits its beauty and the characteristic feature of moulding the beaviour of the taught when it is imparted poperly in the right perspective with implied meanings.There is a lot of technical education in sanskrit.We have to unfold it.It needs political asylum.We have to see that the people taste it.Every bit of sanskrit is suggestive.It is an education for life.We can illustrate this in many ways bit by bit.Let us go to the derivatives.See how the word "Man" derives.Sanskrit  
has been neglected successively for centuries together.That's why now it is not in its wide use.Why do we crave for education? Is it for "Bread and Butter aim"alone? No.Never."Yaa vidyaa saa vimuktayE" is the famous maxim to be remembered here.With sanskrit we can reach this goal.Sanskrit influences the entire world.Historians say Asia is Jamboo  
Dweepa.The other Dweepas are spread over the entire land which is visible 1/4 of the universe as per the Vedic Purushasuktam.To impress upon the subject "The incentives to study Sanskrit" more and more let me take some other time.The Sun of Sanskrit never sets in the world.  
With Regards,  
I.V.N.Acharya.\<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>
