Dear and Respected Colleagues,

Could anyone kindly convey to me, to my persoinal ID if so desired, the exact title of a publication?

The book was a pamphlet written by late Dr.V.Raghavan on the present position of the Vedic Śākhās and was published in 1962 from Kumbakonam. I thoroughly read the work several years ago and made many notes. But I doubt if I remember the exact title.



The title should not be confused with another publication by the same scholar on the same subject under the title 'Reports of Seminars on the present position etc.' published in the *Bulletin of the Institute of Traditional Culture*, Madras in 1957. I do not require information on this.

I shall remain grateful for the information on the first work mentioned.

With thanks in advance

Best

Dipak Bhattacharya
