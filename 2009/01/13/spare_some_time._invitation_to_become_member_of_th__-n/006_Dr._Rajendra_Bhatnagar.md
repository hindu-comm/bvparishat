Dear Veernarayanji,



Your explanatory note about the vvparishad in response to Sri Bhattacharyaji's apprehension is appropriate and was really needed to put other scholars' anxiety at rest.

I take this opportunity to inform you that I have had the copy of Goekoop done. If you ask Lalitji, he can fetch it from me for you. Hope that this finds you exhuberating spirits, bhatnagar
