Dear colleagues,

I offer my advance greetings for Samkranti (Uttarayana Parva Punyakala) of Plava samvatsara (North India) or Sarvadhari samvatsara (South India). I hope this Samkranti brings happiness and prosperity to one and all.



**Hereby I am inviting you to become member of the newly created web list/group [bvpar...@googlegroups.com]() **(भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्).



Main objective of this group is to protect the Indian intellectual tradition and further nourish it so this tradition takes a step ahead.



It is well known fact that Samskrita scholarship is the backbone of the Indian culture, being the main factor that makes Indian culture so unique in comparison with other cultures, and is in a difficult state, if not in total danger of extinction, unless we do not take war foot to protect it. We, the Samskrita scholars, are very fortunate to be in the present situation (with all good modern facilities for writing, communication, printing etc.), after centuries of foreign barbaric rule, brutal colonial policies that made Samskrita nearly extinct, where there is no fear of external invasion, dependency, poverty (to some extent) etc. With Indian economy booming in recent years, Governmental funding agencies ready to provide the grants to any extent to fund projects in universities and research institutes, there is no dearth of grants. Hence I think this is the best time to do something more. No more, we (being in Universities with sixth and more pay commissions) can lodge complaint, which was very much a thing of daily order for the scholars of previous generations, on the lack of funds to work on these lines. Hence we need to take some very urgent steps to go forward.



To achieve this goal this group aims to bring all the Samskrita scholars of subcontinent on a single platform so that they can share their ideas, projects, publications, positions, news, events and so forth. All Samskrita scholars/ scholars working in areas related to Samskrita can communicate with each other through this group culminating in the dissemination of knowledge in a more easy and fastest way. It can create a much needed awareness on what is happening on the other parts of this vast country where nobody is aware on who is working on what projects and where and more importantly we are simply ignorant of mere existence of many institutions. Where is the consolidated data of what is happening in the whole of India. Who knows how many universities have Samskrita departments exactly. Perhaps only some clerks in UGC may hold the key to such questions. Nobody can easily look for the details of Telugu translation of Dhvanyaloka by Pullela Ramachandrudu or Bengali translation of Vyaptipancaka by Raghunath Ghosh. How can one student being in Garli (Himachal Pradesh) locate a book published in a remote village on Western ghat in south India? Similarly it is nearly impossible to avoid duplication of research in the absence of good single platform.

I want, in this connection, to draw your attention to the fact that till now such a web list is what we are lacking for many years whereas our western colleagues have been enjoying this facility through the "Indology web list" for last fifteen years or so.



With creation of this web list, I hope we will be able to bridge the scholarly gap. It will also help the young and promising scholars to be in contact with senior and learned. It is also hoped that this web list will help us to undertake interdisciplinary research with inclusion of scholars from other related fields.



Hence, I sincerely request you take a little trouble to accept this invitation to become member of this group and help Indian intellectual tradition to take a step further.



**If you want to become member simply send me a mail so that I can directly add your name to member list. **

**You can also help us through spreading this message among your colleagues, friends, research scholars etc. so many more people can join this group.**

****

**Pleas ignore if you are already a member. **

**Pleas ignore if you get a duplicated message.**



**Please ignore, though we have taken care not to bother others, if you have nothing to do with Samskrita.**

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः। (भगवद्गीता)
