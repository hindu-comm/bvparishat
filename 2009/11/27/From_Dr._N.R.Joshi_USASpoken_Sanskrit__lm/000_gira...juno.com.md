Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Prof. Prafulla Mishra, \<There are lot of people attacking Sanskrit and Indian culture>.

I declare that I am not one of them. However I will raise questions in order to see views of scholars on difficult topics in History of Sanskrit. Please do not misunderstand me.

I agree with Dr. D. Bhattacharya in connection with spoken Sanskrit. Such efforts are done by organizations in USA. Indians living in USA are mainly educated in technical fields like medicine, engineering and computers. They may or maynot rememberelementary Sanskrit learnt in their school years in India. Swamis visiting USA are constantly talking that Sanskrit is great for computers. Swamis also like to start Vedic Universities in big cities of USA. When some organizations advertise about spoken Sanskrit classes, High tech Indians in USA are attracted due to curiosity. However enthusiasm does not last longer. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
