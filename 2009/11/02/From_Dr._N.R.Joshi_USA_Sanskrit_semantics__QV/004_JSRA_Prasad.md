Dear Dr. Upendar Rao,  
  
Can you please elaborate on what is 'evidence law'? I am not sure,  
whether a book titled 'प्राच्यप्रतीच्यप्रमाणमीमांसा' by Prof. Arindam  
is useful to him.

\> Dear all: Sphota is an instrument both for the sounds and meaning. It is just like the transformer of the electricity which does not generate the electricity but becomes an instrument for the transformation of the sound from the Sabda-brahma in the form of Vaikhari i.e. the articulated sound and its meaning from the sounds generated. Originally it was only related to the sounds later it became connected with the meaning as well. Perhaps, avan Sphotayanasya indicates that it transformed the sound o to ava and hence go> gava. It was not related to the meaning because it does not materially effect the word go. It was already clarified in an earlier letter even now in the languages like Panjabi, phuuTanaa means silence to articulation which is perhaps, the original meaning for sphota. It can be investigated in the dictionary of IndoAryan by Turner which is not available to me for the time being. The word phoDaa is an immature disease which sproutes with due  
\> course of time in Ayurveda. It has been expressed through GaDu also? It is preserved in the sphoTa of Jvaalaamukhi i.e. from silence to sound and to ooze the material. The cognate words may also be traced to come to the true meaning. The effort in the Vedic literature may also be useful. Regards, spnarang
