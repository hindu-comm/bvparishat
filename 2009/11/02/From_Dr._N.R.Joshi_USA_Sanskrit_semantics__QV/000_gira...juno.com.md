Use of words Jāti and Vyakti



Now there is common understanding about Sphoţa and Dhvani among scholars of this list as revealed by postings here in the past months. I have used words Jāti for Sphoţa and Vyakti for Dhvanis. There can be many Dhvanis but there is always one Sphoţa of a given word. In short Dhvanis are phonetic variations and Abhidhā meaning of a word is associated with Sphoţa but Sphoţa itself is not meaning of the word. This discussion is strictly in connection with Vaikharī. High level mystic Sphoţa is different topic. When Dhvani is purposely used to suggest meaning other than Abhidhā meaning, then we are entering into realm of Dhvanyārtha (suggested meaning) used by poeticians.



Now the words Jāti and Vyakti are used also in connection with meanings of words. For example,

(A) Jātih eva vācyāh padānām vyaktayastu lakşyāh iti Bhaţţāh.

(B) Jātiviśişţāh vyaktayah vācyāh iti Vaiśeşikāh

(C) Kvacit Jātih kvacit vyaktih iti Vaiyākaraņāh

(D) Kvacit Jātih kvacit vyaktih kvacit ākŗtih iti Naiyāyikāh

(E) Anyāpohah iti Bauddhāh

(E) Vyaktayah eva vācyāh samayapratipattou tu sādŗśyam upadhānam iti
Ācāryāh

Note: The letter ‘h’ at the end of a word is visarga. I did not find correct diacritical mark. Any comments please. Thanks. N. R. Joshi
