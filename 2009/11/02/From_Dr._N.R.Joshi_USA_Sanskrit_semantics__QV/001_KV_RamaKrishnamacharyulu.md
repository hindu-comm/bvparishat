Sri Joshiji,  
In eight verities of Sphotas three are three Jaati sphotas. As per naiyayikas the letters,words and sentences are "anitya"s. So due to different time,location and speakers, the letters,words and sentences with same sequence are different. For example if we take the meaning bearing unit "Ram", it is not a single word, but it is"Jaati".. Some vaiyakaranas say that the jaati "Ram" which is present in many "Ram" words is indicater of the meaning. Here also the same "Jaatilakshana" applies. But as you mentioned here the "jaati" is "vaacaka", where in other contexts it is "vaacya".For further study the "sphota nirnaya" in bhushanasara will be useful.  

with regards,  
kvrk
