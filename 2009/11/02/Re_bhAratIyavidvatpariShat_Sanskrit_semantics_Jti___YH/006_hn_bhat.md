"shakti" is one of the VRutti-s, in the terminology of Naiyayika. The same is conveyed by "abhidha" or SaMketa" in other contexts. The "padartha" in question, whether it be Jati, or Jatyadi is the "Shakyaarth" or "lakShyartha" of the Naiyayika-s. The term "Shakti" is translated into English loosely to convey all the Vritti-s, as the Word Power. What Mr. Joshi had listed out, is a list of different opinions regarding what is the "padartha" which follows either one of the schools of thinking. Some we have already med in the Shastraic contexts and some are new. For example, I could not reccall the last view

  

(E) Vyaktayah eva vācyāh samayapratipattou tu sādŗśyam upadhānam itiĀcāryāh

  

All the same, the view to Naiyayika-s. seems to be based on the Nyayasutra I had quoted."व्यक्त्याकृतिजातयस्तु पदार्थः" (न्यायसूत्र २.२.६९)

  

In which a commentator, makes it to mean any one the three may become "padartha" depending on the emphasis given in the usage. But I could not reconcile it with Muktavali. One may trace the source to some commentary either Vatsyayanabhashya or some other. I do not have Vatsyayanabhashya with me.
