Thanks for the comment. I think you failed to notice the word "more or less" in my sentence. "katham jaatimanayeyam" iti jaatyaa vyaktiraakshipyate. "JatyakritivyaktayaH padaarthaH" is the Naiyayika-s position. As it is, it is contradictory to J Mimamsaka-s postion, who maintain Jati only is the denoted meaning and "vyakti" also they have to accept in effect, by secondary meaning. Only this much was meant in my sentence by "more or less". This will be clear as you go through my posting.

  

I have added also a note to the effect is that my comment is not based on any quoted source, but free comment.
