Mr. Joshi has raised a general question for discussion.

  

Jāti and Vyakti are mostly used words in Indian theories of meaning with relation to what is denoted. In regard to Sphota theory, it is divisible into component parts for easy comprehension, while maintaining the "akhanda" sphota. With its four fold division, for managing the function of speech activity, it does not necessarily constitute a mythological conception. In my opinion, the four divisions relate to the four stages of evolution of speech activity as the names suggest. "Para" is theconsciousness in general which exerts itself as the perception through sense organs the objects of sensual perception or mental perception, in which state it is called "PashyantI" simply means perception. "Sarve drshyarthaaH j\~naanaarthakaaH". Once the object is perceived in front of the eyes or mind, the next attempt to association of it to theperceivedimages earlier the vocables and stored (by language activity) and the perceived images are converted into the related words (by shakti, or the word power). That is why it is called "madhyamA" which transfers the mentally perceived images into related words. In this process, the "Shaktigra" process is directly associated. Now the last stage, is the expression of the so formed verbal images with vocal articulations. This is called VaikharI. I hope this explains the simple idea behind the concept of four stages of speech briefly. Tantric explanations may make itmystified. But all the same, the psychological process of speech activity is obvious.

  

The other Jati, Akriti, Vyakti or the three are more or less the same in the function of denoting the meaning. "Jaati" is Universals and "Vyakti" is the particular species of the Universals, which could not perceived without embodiment or form in the individual things. That is how they are related. Leave apart, the abstract ideas. What Mimamsaka-s call Jati as the meaning denoted, is the same as the "apohavada" of Buddhist logicians. Denotation will be properly conveying the idea. As they say, what does the word "gau" do is to exclude the properties not belonging the cow (Apoha of Buddhists), and restring the word with the universality of cow. Now. coming to the usage, as the universals could not be acted upon, by

the listener of the sentence "gAm Anaya", the individual cow is understood by the secondary word power. or Akshepa for implementation of the word. Buddhist stress on the exclusion of other properties, than the restriction of the word to the Universal properties in the particular. Because of this odd postition, Naiyayika-s accept "JatyakritivyaktayaH padaarthaH" All the four should be denoted by the word the form of the object denoted included. "Jatyakritivishishtavyaktau ShaktiH" is the policy accepted by them.

  

Anandavardhana, takes "tasmaad dhvaniH ShabdaH" from the Grammarians, as being the synonym for Sphota, in its extended sense, "sphuTatyarthaH asmaad", as the Soul of Poetry or the Voice of the Poet when he propounded Dhvani theory of Suggested meaning. Whatever meaning is conveyed, is attributed to the poets" words or poets" language, unlike the normal speech activity, overriding any restrictions on the other functions of the words like Abhidha, Lakshana and Tatparya. In fact, it is the same as "Tatparya" if take into consideration, "yatparaH ShabdaH, sa eva shabdaarthaH" (Whatever intended by the use of the words, itself is its meaning (nothing short of that without conveying the intention of the speaker). This has been brought out in my earlier posting.

  

Here I have given my comments without any more technical implication or quotation of sources, off hand. Scholars may go into minute details and come forward with many moresophisticatedcomments.

  

With regards
