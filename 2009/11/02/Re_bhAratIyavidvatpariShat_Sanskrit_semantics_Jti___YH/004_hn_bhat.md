> **A complete definition cannot be made without padaartha and pada**

  

I remember bhaashaapariccheda clearly lays out the modified difinition accommodating the place for "vRtti" which is the form of either shakti or lakShanA::

  

"व्रुत्त्या पदजन्यपदार्थोपस्थि शाब्दबोधेहेतुः" इति हि मुक्तावलीनिष्कर्षः।  
  

Mr. Joshi had raised the question relating Jati and Vyakti according to different schools and just I offered a synthetic view of the functions represented by the different theories.

  

The analysis of the view JatiH padaarthaH, that it would necessarily entertain the "vyakti" is also found in MuktavalI:

  

किं च, गोत्वे यदि शक्तिः, तदा गोत्त्वत्वं शक्त्यतावच्चेदकं वाच्यम्, गोत्त्वत्वं तु गवेतरासवेतत्वे सति सकलगोसमवेतत्वम्। तथा च ग्प्व्यक्तीनां शक्यतावच्छेदके ऽ‍नुप्रवेशात् तवैव गौरवम्।’

  

\[If "gotva" jati is accepted as shakti, the "shakya" should be gottva-tva, which can be defined as that is not available in others than cow and which is inherent in all the particular cows. Now you have to accept, into its domain all the particular "Vyakti" also which would not be simply acceptable because of this complication.\]

  

My equation of the theory of Mimamsaka-s with the *apoha-vada*of Bauddha-s taking into consideration of the above analysis. But Buddha-s cannot accept a continuous perception, because in their view every thing is momentary kshanikavij\~naana. Hence they could not accept Jati which requires continuity of cognition. As such, they are content with exclusive function only "Apoha".

  

Hope this much is clear. "व्यक्त्याकृतिजातयस्तु पदार्थः" (न्यायसूत्र २.२.६९) has been modified as "शक्तिः जात्याकृतिविशिष्टव्यक्तौ विश्राम्यति।" which accommodates all the three Jati, akriti and vyakti in its proper place into the Word Power.
