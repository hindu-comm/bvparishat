Whenever I found time I could read some of the postings on sanskrit. In my little uderstanding, it is as bad as reducing Sanskrit to any language x,y,z as claiming greatness of sanskrit because it talks of dharma and adharma. A tribal language is also a language like any other language so also sanskrit is a language like any other language. Does it mean that sanskrit language is a tribal language ? When we compare x and y it implies first that x is not y and at the same time x shares a bundle of properties of y. Therefore, no argument is needed to establish that sanskrit is like any other language, because it is a language. That is not the intention of the speaker who says that sanskrit is great. He or she might have have given a fallacious ground (hetu) to establish his or her claim(sadhya).



Sanskrit is great because sanskrit has, unlike many languages, a unique history of its cultivation touching various aspects of intellectual, aesthetic, philosophical, spiritual, and cultural life of human beings. It has kept on nourishing intellectual, aesthetic, philosophical , spiritual, and cultural life of not only Indians but also ot those who came in contact with this human treasure. Not only it nourished in the past, itcontinues tonourish those who cultivate this language and its content closely in present time and it has the capacity to nourish in future too. What is required is a penitrating cultivation so that one goes deeper and deeper to derive insights to enrich contemporary knowledge domains. There cannot be any two opinions regarding the fact that sanskrit studies cannot overlook contemporary needs. The studies must underline universals so that only those unersals are preserved at all costs and are made available to the next generations and in turn the study will automatically underline also those whichhave becomeirrelevant and obsolate. Therefore, in stead of spending time in such discussions, let us study sanskrit closely so that our next generation feels proud of being Indians. There is no need of merging of departments of philosophy, rather each discipline should be studied deeply so that its role becomes clear in the holistic Indian approach of enquiry. If this happens you will not find people saying " enough of Nyaya, Vaisesika!" and the like.

Butwe need teachers to be trained with such a mission of service. I can only pray to God !



All best wishes,

VNJha
