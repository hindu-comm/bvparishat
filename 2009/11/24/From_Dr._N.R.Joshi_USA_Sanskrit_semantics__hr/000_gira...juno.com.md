Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Explanation!

When a diamond is hammered on anvil, then one comes to know its true nature. The purpose of my posting "Nothing special about Sanskrit" is bring out different dimensions of Sanskrit that can be promoted. Unless I challenge scholars, how do I get their different views? I expected emotional and patriotic response. Literature in Sanskrit is great.Nobody denies that. Are you happy with that only? If somebody is happy with the grammar of Panini, it is ok. Please remember there were many grammarians before Panini. There are different grammars of Sanskrit with modifications. Sanskrit scholars know that. I am searching beyond all these features. At the end of my article I mentioned the scientific nature of Sanskrit VarNamaalaa. I am looking at Sanskrit from the angle of science of language. I am not looking at it as language for great literature.And many languages of the world have great literature.And why Indian scholars look for certificate of greatness of Sanskrit from foreigners? They should know long before outsiders. In this respect I would like to add the two papers on "Knowledge representation in Sanskrit" published by Rick Briggs in 1985 should have come first from Indian Sanskrit scholars.But they did not. So please explore Sanskrit together without getting emotional. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
