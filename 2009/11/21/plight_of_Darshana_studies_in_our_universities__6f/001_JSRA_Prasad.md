Sir,  
You have raised and an important issue. In my opinion, this should be addressed from the root of Sanskrit education policy. For sastric Sansrkit study, the famous places are Vidyapeethas, gurukulas run by spiritual leaders and gurukulas sponsored by arya samaj etc. In all these places, vyakarana, sahitya and/or darshana studies are prevalent. It is true that number of takers in darshana is dwindling day by day. We use to hear that there were चतुश्शास्त्र and षट्छास्त्रपण्डितs, and even a few now, fortunately. The University system of education has spoiled the spirit of sastric studies, due to Macaulay's impression.Why because, say, in nyaya and again in navya nyaya, few selected texts are prescribed for reading and further, few portions only are read due to the curriculum. Even in such a plight, for students who take up study in nyaya etc., what is the career prospect? Olden days it was that 'सा विद्या या विमुक्तये' but now due to the 'globalization' it is that 'सा विद्या या नियुक्तये' । Are we ready to accept that education is meant only for knowledge?  
  
The whole point is whether a degree in a sastra equipping them with any employment. As far as Sanskrit students are concerned, getting job in vidyapeethas, is a dream, unless one passed the shiksha shastri/shiksha acharya examinations Opportunities Sanskrit BEds are due to the magnanimity of state governments of Rajasthan, U.P. etc. Are we short of ideas in creating employment for Sanskrit students? Yes, I agree that total system should be refurbished in Sanskrit academics to do so. One should not ignore the fact that majority of Sanskrit students are from poor families. There is no one to defend for the upliftment of a scientific language in state houses or in Parliament. Political are not educated and interested in this regard and educated cannot go to politics. In tenth plan, the central govt., has allocated a mere five crores of rupees for preserving Vedic oral tradition .  
  
Courses in general darshana is a welcome phenomenon. Unfortunately, all students of sarvadarshana are not fit to take up interdisciplinary study since they lack the knowledge of in depth discussion of concepts in nyaya etc. Good knowledge of vyakarana, nyaya and meemamsa helps one to conduct interdisciplinary research in fields like NLP, formal logic, Chomskyian studies, western philosophy etc. So, alongside samanya darshana, each school of six theistic darshanas should be given priority. Student number is not only important but also the tradition and preservation of sastras. Of course, there are always takers for sahitya since it is said - समष्टिः सर्वशास्त्राणां साहित्यमभिधीयते । To be frank, how many of us encourage our children to study sastras? In Sanskrit study, if we just ignore sastras or darshanas, then the tradition of vakyartha sabhas may become history. Thanks to mathas like Sringeri, Kanchi, Udupi, Ahobila and TTD etc., who render yeomen service in teaching sastras and continuing the vakyartha sabhas. I don't foresee a quick remedy of sasrtic study linked with employment as is happening in software field, but intellectuals can chalk out a plan for a new Sanskrit education policy supported by government and institutions as well. To sum up the discussion:  
  
- specialized study of darshana should not be dropped  
- samanya darshana may also be given importance  
- interdisciplinary studies should be incorporated in the curriculum (Sanskrit-computers etc.)  
- specialized studies of sastras should be coupled with employment  
- Initiative on new Sanskrit education policy (forfeiting three language formula)  
  
Swami Vivekananda said - 'True education is not the amount of information that is put into one's brain'. Sorry, if I am verbose.  
  
With due respect to scholars,  
Prasad
