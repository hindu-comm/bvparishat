namaskAra,  
I congratulate your idea and it should be taken as a mission mode project. This is the need of of the hour in changing times. A couple of years back, when computer education was introduced in schools the goals were high. Now, we witness that children can operate and work on computers before they carry this knowledge for higher studies in computer science. Similarly, tradition and modernity can go together in syllabi of the proposed concept school. No one might have envisaged the success of samskrita bharati when it is started 'Aksharam' in 1983.
