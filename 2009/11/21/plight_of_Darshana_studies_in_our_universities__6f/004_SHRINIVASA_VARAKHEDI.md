Dear Members,  
  
The issue started by Dr. P.N.Panduranga is of great importance and  
needs immediate action and reaction. Response from Prof. Prasad is  
highly apt one. He has discussed all the related subtle matters in  
detail and very nicely summarized the whole discussion at the end.  
  
Let us focus the issue at one point following the basic question  
raised by Dr.P.N.P. The issue is - Is it right to close the  
specialization in Traditional Sanskrit Versities in the name of  
unification in Education ?  
  
My point is this.  
  
1. No dept should be isolated. They should function in association  
with other disciplines. Study in any specailization must be open to  
other disciplines.  
2. However, this should not lead to loss of their identity. If they  
are merged, they lose their identity and one day there will be lot of  
confusion and misinterpretation of such Darshanas.  
  
We must find solution between these two edges.  
  
Please give your valuable feedback.  
  
regards,  
shrivarakhedi
