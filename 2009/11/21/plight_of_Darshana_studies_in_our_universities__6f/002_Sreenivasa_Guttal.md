NamaskAra,



I have been thinkingabout this issue from a little different perspective for quite some time now. While it is important to preserve the traditional knowledge, method as in our Gurukulasa/Vidyapitas, we should also bring new solutions to meet contemporary reality.

Specifically, I am looking at a middle path, which can mix both modern and traditional education. A new school forpeople who would have send kids to good modern schools, but also have interest in traditional culture.At theend of10+2, they shouldhave proficiency in both modern and traditionalfundementals, with an option to pursueanydegree further.If they pursue conventional path like BE etc, the foundation would be strong enough to do further shAstric studies and keep the cultural ethos. This would also bring a set of new generation people who can do inter-disciplinary studies, research in modern fields.  

In summary,key is to start new age schools with new syllabi having a good blend of modern + traditional core subjects. This needs experts both fields to get-together. One important thing to do is to cut down modern school syllabus upto 50%and introduce core subjects in shAstraduring those hours. This should still keep the competency of the student on par with any normal school w.r.t to opprotunities for future.



I am also working a possible syllabi for the same with myfriendgiven our modern schooling backgroundwith a bit of traditional schooling. But, we requireeducationalists in both fields who can guide us.



Regards,

Sreenivasa
