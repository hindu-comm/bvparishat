Dear all esteemed members of this group  
  
I think it is highly reasonable to think over plight of darshana  
studies in our universities.  
recent times have been very harsh on darshan studies all over indian  
with dvindling students numbers which has come down over the years due  
to globalisation and other factors. Even the philosophy departments in  
universities are reporting the dvindling numbers.  
  
there is no need to mention specialised darshan depts. such as nyaya,  
vaisheshika, sankhya, yoga, meemamsa , dvaita, advaita and  
vishistadvaita etc. they are famous for theie low turnouts from the  
time immemorial. Average samskrit student opts normally for Sahitya or  
Vyakarana the backbones of samskrit studies. what will happen to these  
darshanan in future. mimamamsa is in the line of extinction. so are  
the specialised vedantas. Nyaya is no different story. what may be  
panacea for this hardship? please come forward to get them our of  
red.  
even one of our prestugious universities is rumoured to be thinking of  
merging all these three vedanta (dvaita, advaita and vishistadvaita)  
departments to make an unified vedanta department so that it may have  
sufficient students.  
  
besides Many sanskrit and philosophy depts in universities offer MA in  
darshana (samanya darshan) which has many takers since many opt for  
the general understanding of darshans if not a specialised  
understanding of particular understanding. this may be good for it.  
  
however it is still not clear what will good or bad if we opt for  
general darshan than specialised study of particular darshana. no  
study of any dicipline should be made in isolation. it will lead to  
stagnation. hence interaction between different departments of same  
dicipline is highly essential. but at the same time we need to retian  
the identiities of each darshan. it is the identity verses isolation  
situation.  
  
I invite opinions of learned men and women of this group.  
sincerely  
Dr. Pandurangavithala
