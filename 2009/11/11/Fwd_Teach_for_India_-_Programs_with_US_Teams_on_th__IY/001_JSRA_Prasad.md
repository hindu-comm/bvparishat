The project is concentrating on low income private schools and Govt.  
schools where  
the medium is English. Unfortunately, in all states, English medium is  
not mandatory.  
When foreigners see India socially, always what they see is the  
poverty every where  
and nothing else. Even websites expose only the images in which one  
can find the illeterate,  
disrobed Indian children. If that is the phenomenon of India, then  
what about the plight of  
Ambanis, Infosys, NIITs, Bhatnagar/President awardees, grand masters,  
god's own land (Kerala)  
/heaven on earth (Kashmir) and so on so forth? Tourism industry in  
India is generating millions  
of foreign currency, particularly the medical tourism. The foreign  
media has to change their  
perception about Indian society. Of course, India is poor but not the  
Indians! Thanks.
