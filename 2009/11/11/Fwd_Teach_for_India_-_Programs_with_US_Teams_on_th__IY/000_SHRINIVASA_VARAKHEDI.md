Subject: Teach for India - Programs with US Teams on the model of  
Teach for India  
To: [sastr...@gmail.com]()

  
Namaste

Here is a link that ALL in Hinduism /India Education Business teams  
need to see and explore. The Langauge Demography of India continuesto  
change in favor of English (American ?!) along with changes in the  
flavor of Religious-Cultural practices.

The serving hands have a long long reach ! And obviously more ' Power  
than what charity models can meet'.

1. All information and application materials are online:  
[www.teachforindia.org](http://www.teachforindia.org)
(<http://67.19.228.180/teachforindia/> )

The program has a two-year commitment, and places students with  
completed undergraduate degrees in rural schools in north India (I  
believe the program is currently limited to the state of Maharashtra).  
Placement is in English medium schools, so language is not a barrier  
for students who speak no Indian languages. Similar to Teach for  
America, Teach for India has a series of application deadlines (the  
first has already passed, but there are two more upcoming: 11/22 and  
1/10).

  
Please take a few minutes to see the vision of Indias Educational  
Crisis and the substitution models that are coming for this through  
the Business schools route ( the names of the Board members will help  
you to appreciate this point).

Certainly the 'Pizza Effect' is taking place in India for Indian  
Education through the US route !!
