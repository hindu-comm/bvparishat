I do not know what you mean by the meaning of semantics in Sanskrit Grammar. Anyhow, there is an article "Syntactic and Semantic relation in Panini" By Kiparsky and Stall attached to a message to BVparishat by the member[sivaja...@gmail.com]()  
in his mail. I think you can download it from this link:

directly or from his message to bvparishat in some other thread.

  

With regards
