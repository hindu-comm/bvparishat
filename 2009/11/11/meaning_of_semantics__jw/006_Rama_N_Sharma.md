Semantics is the study of meaning. The study of meaning in the West which is called Semantics is not exactly what we have in Sanskrit.  
There are texts in the Indian Tradition in Mimamsa, Nyaya, Vyakarana, and darshanas where meaning has been studies. From Bhartrhari (in bhasha-darshana to Nagesha in Vyakarana; From Natyashastra to Kaavyashastra when it comes to Kavyas (which includes Natakas). Then we have texts dealing with meanings of the Mimamsakas and Naiyayikas. There are many references in Sanskrit focusing on Shabda-shakti and shaabdabodha. Most recently (2005) Part I of Shabdabodhamimamsa by NS Ramanuja Tatacharya was published by Rastriita Samskrit Sansthana, New Delhi. This first Part is Vakyavakyarthavicaratmaka (the title is translated into Sanskrit as An Inquiry into Indian Theories of Verbal
Cognition). It is an excellent work. The other three Parts of this study are projected as: Part 2: Case Terminations: Their Significance; Part 3: Nominal Stems: Their Significance; Part IV\_ Verbs and Verbal Significance.
