Thanks Prof. Rama N Sarmaji for pointing out to Shabdabodha Mimamsa of Sri NS R Tatacharya. I was about to write about it. Really innovative work. The manuscript of the work and press copy was prepared while he was working in our Institution French Institute, Pondicherry. He is the most competent person to write on the subject.

  

I hope all the 4 volumes are published by now. I saw in our library all the 4 volumes.

  

With regards
