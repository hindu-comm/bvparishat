Dear Pandeyji



Semantics ,as you know , deals with Meaning. No doubt , Vyakarana deals with Sabda (Sabdaanusaasanam).

But one should not forget the Yogasutra(3-17) - sabdaarthapratyayaanaam itaretaraadhyaasaat samkarah

tatpravibhaagasamyamaat sarvabhuutarutajnaanam, and the Vyaasabhaasya on that - gauriti sabdah gauriti arthah gauriti jnaanam etc.. This was actually in answer to the question as to how can a Yogii understand

the languages of all Praanis(birds, animals etc). And in the cotext of Vyakarana it suggests Sphota.



The point I wish to make clear is that Meaning is also discussed in treatises related to Vyakarana, such as

Mahabhasya,Vaakyapadiyam , Manjusaa etc.



Also note that the Western Lingustics was initially started on the premise that there is no connection between

Sabda and Artha and the same had miserably failed.



For books dealing with semantics in Dramatergy one has to search
through Alsmkarasastra.
