Dear Pandeyji:  
What a pleasant surprise to know you. I am also Ramanath (Pandey), with use of Sharma as my family name after my father andit Raghunath Sharma, the author of the commentary Amabakartri on the Vakyapadiiyam of Bhartrhari.  
Now to Semantics:  
(1) With due respect I beg to strongly differ with Dipak Bhattacharya on his claim that the differences in Indian Approaches to study of meaning and western approaches is immaterial. The Indian approaches involve mimamsa, nyaya, vyakarana and darshana (including vyaakarana-darshana). It studies meaning by way of cognition, shabdashakti (expressive power of words, where word is no ordinary word) and logic. Western Semantics is altogether different. I find it very difficult to write about Sanskrit on the computer. Mostly because of problems in transliteration and the Sanskrit script. Writing something in transliteration is thus very awkward for me. That is why I am not going to write any more.  
(2) After I completed my PhD. at the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York (1971), I taught Linguistics (generally Introduction, Chomsy's Transformational Grammar and Sociolinguistics). After I came to Hawaii (1976) I got deeply involved with my linguistic researches on Panini, and could not keep up with developments in Theoretical Linguistics. So any reference in Linguistics Semantics that I offer are going to be from the TG days when Katz and Fodor was a big name in Semantics. So based on my limited information I am offering you some references (I have not read them, but they are more recent and they should be good because of authorship).  
(3) If you search the Wel go to Wikipedia and search Semantics. You will find paper(s) with references.  
(4) Then there are books:  
(i) Semantics (vol. I and II) by John I Saeed;  
(ii) John Lyons, Linguistic Semantics, vols I and II (I highly recommend it). There is also paperback edition by Penguin. Contact Penguin India.  
(iii) Hana Flip, Aspect, Eventuality, Types and Nominal Reference. A rather expensive book (something like 165 dollars).  
This is all on References.
