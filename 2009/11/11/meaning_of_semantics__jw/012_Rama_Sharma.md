Dear Upendraji:

It is always good to hear from a samaanadharmaa. There is a paper of mine in the Aesthetics volume of the Hisory... Studies just came out. It should be easily available at JNU libraries. It is based on the use of laukika nyaayas in grammar as discussed in the Mahaabhaasya. The title of the paper is, The World Outside on the World Inside...

I am waiting for my very ambitious long paper On Indian Tradition Of Linguistics and Panini which is to appear by next month. Once this paper is out I shall send these two papers in copies to you Centre. In the meantime read the laukika Nyasya paper if you can find it and let me know.

With warm regards.

Rama Nath Sharma
