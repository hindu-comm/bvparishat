Dear scholars  
I just wanted to know that semantic is the branch of linguistics  
concerned with the meaning. Indian grammarian deals with word-  
formation or have laid the foundation for the analysis of sentence and  
its meaning. Words convey the intended meaning and hence are the means  
of communication. Thus the word, sentence and meaning all are separete  
elements. Thus Vyakarana deals with either Sabda (Sabdaanusaasanam) or  
vAkya but not the meaning (artha)separately as western linguisticians  
discuss. As Prof. Rama Nath Sharma has clarified that “ The study of  

meaning in the West which is called Semantics is not exactly what we  

have in Sanskrit. There are several texts in the Indian Tradition in  

Mimamsa, Nyaya, Vyakarana, and darshanas where meaning has been  

studies.” Prof.Korada Subrahmanyam has elaborated very nicely quoting  
the Yogasutra(3-17) and the Vyaasabhaasya on that . How can a Yogii  

understand the languages of all Praanis(birds, animals etc). And in  

the cotext of Vyakarana it suggests Sphota. I thanks very much both of  
them. I also thanks these scholars for suggesting some reference works  
in this regard. But I wanted to know that is there any published work  
or research paper/article on this particular subject? I mean which  
deals with Semantics exclusively. If it is there then please help  
me..  
Thanks
