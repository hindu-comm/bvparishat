Didn't you just make the point in English? I don't see why any of us  
should blush if we include Sanskrit words in English sentences. In  
fact, it is difficult to see how a translation would be fundamentally  
different. One could substitute some English word for upasarga, etc.,  
but this is not easy as there are no exact English words for many of  
these things as the relevant concepts do not exist in English (or  
Greek or Latin) grammar. Indeed, when English is used for specialized  
subjects like medicine, law, engineering, or sciences, certain special  
terms (which themselves may not be plain English words) are always  
used. Likewise, the Paninian canon has its own jargon. If we persist  
in using such special terms often enough, perhaps they will even find  
their way into English, as \`guru', \`pundit', \`nirvana', etc., have.
