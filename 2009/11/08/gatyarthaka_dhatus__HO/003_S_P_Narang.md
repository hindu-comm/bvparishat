It is difficult to translate a gatyarthaka with a prefix in English. For translation, we will have to provide a database. Moreover, the roots have semantic shades even without prefix. A few studies are available: Bhagirath: Dhatupathasamiksa; Suman Saini: Sanskrit ke Dhatu aur unka arthaparivartana where the topic has been dealt ( In Hindi). Gatyarthaka is collected without going to its details. It can be traced in Turner: Dictionary of Indo-Aryan with its shades in II languages. Best wishes, spnarang
