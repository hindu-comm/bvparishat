Thanks for your reply. Yes, of course, I might have made a point  
according to you, until and unless there is no translation available  
in explaining the concept. I completely agree with you to persist  
people to use Sanskrit words only in English, instead translating  
them,where it is hard. And we should make it as an udyama. My  
requirement was that I am teaching a foreigner to whom this concept  
has to be explained.  
  
With regards,  
Prasad
