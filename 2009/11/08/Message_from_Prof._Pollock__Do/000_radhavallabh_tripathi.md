Dear Prof. Tripathi,

  

I write you now for your assistance. I have decided to direct some of the funding I have received from a major fellowship from the Mellon Foundation towards doctoral fellowships for Dalit students ofSanskrit, and I fervently seek your aid in identifying qualified candidates. These fellowships are five-year awards leading to the Ph.D. degree, and cover tuition and provide a substantial stipend.I am seeking strong students from the Dalit community who have demonstrated their passion for Sanskrit studies and who have achieved at least an M.A. degree (preferably M.Phil). Good English skills are important, but I would find ways of enrolling suitable candidates in English summer school prior to their first year in graduate school. The key thing the student must have is a sense that Sanskrit is*existentially*important for his or her life.

  

I would be profoundly grateful if you could pass the word among your colleagues throughout India, and ask them to direct legitimate candidates to me vial email. For now I simply want a one-page statement of purpose, and a brief bio-data. The statement should set out what the student wants to study and why.

  

If we move quickly there will still time for students to apply for the coming year: the deadline is I believe the end of December, but interested applicants would need to move fast. I will provide funding for one student for each of the three years beginning next year.

  

Please let me know of any questions. I thank you warmly in advance for any help you can offer.

  

My very best,

  

Sheldon Pollock
