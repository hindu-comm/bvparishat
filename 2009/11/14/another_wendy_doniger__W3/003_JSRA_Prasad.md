Dear Friend,  
  
What do you mean by useless remarks? Before you refute someone, come with positive criticism over their deeds/writings which is the convention. If my remarks are useless, then positive replies of other respected members would also become useless. Do you represent the group of capitalists? Now a days it is become fashion (passion) to criticise Sanskrit for many, even this list is not an exemption. Did you ever feel the pain of a Sanskrit student who puts in tremendous effort to acquire knowledge? Know the legacy, glory and scientificity of Sanskrit, search in internet over tonnes of information to be enlightened with. It is a shame on our part, if we don't accept the place of Sanskrit in India. If vidyapeethas are to be closed down, then do our students need to go to Oxford, Heidelberg etc.? Don't try to attack on the traditional institutions which are the back bone of Indian culture. If you speak to any foreign indologist, then the one will tell you stories of greatness and necessity of teaching Sanskrit.  
  
When 'learned' people like Wendy Doniger, Meera Nanda are unleashed over Hinduism or Sanskrit, why should not we be eligible to express our concerns?
