Respected Scholars,  
  
Namaste. Not sure, whether you followed a an article 'producing priests' published in the Front line (Jul 4-11, 09) by Meera Nanda. The link is \<<http://www.flonnet.com/fl2614/stories/20090717261403100.htm>\> In a nutshell, what she argues is that the Sanskrit Deemed/State Universities are just producing priests and vastu shastris with tax payes's money, nothing else. She also opined that due to the globalization, Sanskrit institutions are exploiting the opportunity to produce the astrologists, vastu experts to live on societal spiritual beliefs. It seems, she has already published a book titled 'The God Market: How Globalization is Making Indian more Hindu'. You may follow the introduction to the book at <http://nirmukta.com/2009/03/29/pre-release-introduction-to-god-and-globalization-in-india/>  
  
With regards,  
Prasad
