Namste All,

  

Pranaams.  

  

How can we, who are descendants of the Sanskritic tradition ourselves, try to devalue this ancient language? The attempt to prove that Sanskrit is not special is clearly the influence of a western ideal, which seeks to undermine the non-physical or non-material underpinnings of everything as either "false," "mythological," "superstitious," or against empiricism. There are certain facts in this previous post that are clearly overlooked in the attempt to try to bring Sanskrit down to the level of any other language. My question is, what is the point of trying to "demote" Sanskrit to the level of any other language? What do we seek to gain by doing this? And why are we the ones who are trying to do it? The child does not insult or devalue his mother no matter what, even if she is exactly the same as every other mother. Let others try to devalue Sanskrit. But my email is not here to simply chastise the attempt to demote Sanskrit. I would like to point out a few facts.

  

Agreed, Sanskrit is "just" a language, but in which other language do we find a 100% self-sufficiency of expression based on its own roots and its own grammar system? In which other language is the mode, means, and accuracy of expression as comprehensive as in Sanskrit? Even if we don't agree that Sanskrit roots are derived directly from experiential data, surely we must still be able to agree on the almost infinite capacity for expansion from the extant roots of Sanskrit? English is based almost completely on roots from other languages, often times borrowing entire words from other languages and claiming them as its own (mantra, guru, pandit, etc.). English does not have astitva. Romance languages can all be traced back to Latin. Latin and Greek can be traced ultimately back to Sanskrit. Sanskrit is the source from which new combinations of roots (also known as words) that are otherwise unknown to other languages come to them. What is not special about this?

  

In which other language do we find the flexibility of syllabic interpretation that is existent in Sanskrit, resulting in the almost infinite multitude of literature written in chandas or syllable-based meters? To which other language do we find as many odes as there are towards Sanskrit? Why did rishis of the past and even modern gurus like Aurobindo, Chinmaya, Vivekananda, etc. worship Sanskrit? If they were indeed realized masters, are we trying to undermine or question their devotion to something? What is not special about this?

  

We find that Sanskrit has survived for longer than any other language thus far. Why is this the case? Where Latin and Greek, the other two languages hailed for their ancientness, have died, Sanskrit has survived. Even in the face of attack by British colonists who sought to destroy India's roots by destroying Sanskrit itself, Sanskrit has survived. The language itself was attacked! And yet it survived. What is not special about this? Why do we fail to acknowledge such simple points and seek to devalue Sanskrit?

  

The answer to the question "What is so special about Sanskrit?" is in fact embedded in the previous post itself. I quote: "Now you tell me what is special about Sanskrit except her grammar" ... The grammar of Sanskrit is in itself enough to make Sanskrit special, why do we seek to undervalue that?

  

I will leave you with one more thought for consideration. In the International Journal of Neuroscience, 2001, vol. 109, issue 1-2, p. 71, Dr. Fred Travis, director of the ERG / psychophysiology lab of Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, USA states that the physiological effects of reading Sanskrit are similar to those experienced during the Transcendental Meditation technique. Is this not worthy of our attention? Why is it that this attribute of meditative experience (just from reading the language!) does not exist in any other language? What is not special about this?

  

Namo namah.
