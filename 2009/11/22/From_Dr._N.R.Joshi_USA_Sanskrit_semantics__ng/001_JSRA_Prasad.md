Sir,  
Thanks for your postings. I liked your example on the decoding meanings of English letter sounds.  
A quick comment.

I heard that a certain popular universal religion declares - 'all the human beings by birth are sinners'. Hinduism reflected through writings in Sanskrit never says so and proclaims that 'every human being is divine'. I feel there is a subtle distinction in cultural strategy when these two are compared. While not relating dharma with moksha I quote -  
- धारणाद्धर्म इत्याहुः धर्मो धारयते प्रजाः । तस्माद्धारणसंयुक्तः स धर्म इति गीयते ।।  
- धृतिक्षमादमोस्तेयं शौचमिन्द्रियनिग्रहः । धीर्विद्यासत्यमक्रोधो दशकं धर्मलक्षणम् ।।  
Here, dharma is nothing do with moksha.

It is obviously true. They not only does word processing but also language processing using AI. Now, sophisticated systems in terms of morphological generator, morphological analyser, sandhi splitter/generator are being developed by scientists in NLP. Sanskrit provides the foundation and supplies rules from Panini in context of machine translations since languages like English has a different grammatical structure as all of us know. Whether we attach dharma or adharma to Sanskrit it is scientific, apparently.
