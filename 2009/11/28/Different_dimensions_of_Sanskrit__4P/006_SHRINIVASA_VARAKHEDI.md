It's a nice subjectline started by Dr.Ramanth and continued by others.  
  
I would like to add the following.  
  
1. IIIT-HYD and Rashriya Sanskrit Sansthan have floated a new prorgam  
for Sanskrit Scholars. Any scholar working in different institution  
can stay and work with NLP researchers at IIIT-LTRC with full support  
of salary etc for a period of two years. Research scholars are also  
supported under this program to undertake research at IIIT.  
  
2. Any sanskrit scholar can join his hands in any of these research  
programs by working at his home. contact "Dipti Sharma"  
\<[dip...@gmail.com]()\>, "Vineet Chaitanya" \<[vc99...@gmail.com]()\>, "amba  
kulkarni" \<[ambap...@gmail.com]()\> for any help.  
  
regards,  
shrivara
