Sir,  
  
Thanks for a nice post. Interdisciplinary study in Sanskrit had been taken momentum for the last two decades in India. Before 1990s, there were hardly any computer users in Sanskrit academics and the machines were not sophisticated. Rick Briggs is a computer scientist and had attempted on the knowledge representation in Sanskrit. How many Sanskrit scholars were familiar with computer science (in 1980s) ? Also, until recent past, we don't have any flavor of Sanskrit in curriculum. Hence, my submission is that it is nothing wrong from Indian side by not looking in to that aspect. Also for your kind information, Swami Paramananda Bharati had organized a conference 'Sanskrit and Computers' in Bangalore in 1985 in which respected Prof. Ramakrishnamacharyulu garu has presented a paper with Prof. Vineet Chaitanya. (He is the source of an interdisciplinary PG degree and few other projects at Tirupati vidyapeetha.) There after IIT Kanpur has taken interest to work in Paninian linguistics and computers. Unfortunately we will be looking at foreigners for the attestation of greatness of Sanskrit until Sanskrit becomes medium of communication or we should emphasize to highlight the valuable statements of our own Sanskrit scholars globally. I quote a saying in Telugu - 'it is not a sacred water until it has come through the pious conch'. I have uploaded Rick Brigg's paper.  
  
Thanks,  
Prasad
