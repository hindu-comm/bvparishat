Dear Subrahmanya MahodayaaH,

A small doubt. Is the reading of the sutra is available as "vyaktyakritijaatayastu padaarthaH" quoted in a Vritti later than Vyomavati and also in jatishaktivada section of Tattvacintamani of Gangeshopadhyaya. I had come across the above reading also, but I could not check with Vatsyayana Bhashya.

  

It is interpreted as pradhanagunabhaavena trayo 'pyarthaaH. Like the catuShtayii shabdanaaM pravRutti, of Mahabhashya. When one is predominant, the others are underlying it as the occasion demands. Is it the similar view in "Prashastapadabhashya" also accepted by earlier Naiyayika-s which led Joshi to offer this view:

  

D) Kvacit Jātih kvacit vyaktih kvacit ākŗtih iti Naiyāyikāh

  

Hope you will expose this in your next posting.
