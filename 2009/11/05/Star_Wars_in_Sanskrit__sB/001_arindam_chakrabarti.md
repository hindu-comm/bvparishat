One of my students from University of Hawaii, Stephen Harris (now a PhD student in Department of Philosophy University of New Mexico, USA) was involved in this production. Obviously their pronunciation is very American (and not accurate at all), but the attempt and the translation surely shows how deeply they love Sanskrit, and wish to bring it, playfully, into current popular culture. This is what needs to be done, rather than keeping Sanskrit rigidly tied to Hindu/Vedic/ Shaastric "purity" and religiousness.  
  
My current PhD student Jeremy Henkel,(who took Sanskrit from Prof Ramanath Sharma, and is currently writing his dissertation on Ethical Status of Lying and Truth-Telling) wrote the following note to me about this Star Wars in Sanskrit,  
The American Institute of Indian Studies oragnizes these classes of learning Sanskrit every summer in Pune. Jeremey and Stephen went to one of these summer schools:  
"That was actually done by three of the people I was in Pune with for AIIS in 2006. The voice of the Emperor is Stephen Harris.
