What about the "Tantravartika" definining LakShanA by Kumarilabhatta himself, if "lakSHaNA" is not accepted by BhaattaMimamsaka-s?

  

"अभिधेयाविनाभूतप्रतीतिर्लक्षणोच्यते।

लक्ष्यमाणगुणैर्योगाद् वृत्तेरिष्टा तु गौणता।" (१.४.२२)

  

This has been quoted in Kavyaprakasha also, in the context of Lakshana. Our IVN Acharya will have to answer this question.

  

Kavyaprakasha had already quoted this view, but only to reject it.

  

"गौरनुबध्यः" इत्यादौ श्रुतिचोदितमनुबन्धनं कथं मे स्याद् इति जात्या व्यक्तिराक्षिप्यते, न तु शब्देनोच्यते।"

  

Here, the meaning of Akshipyate is the same as Lakshyate, in the view quoted by Joshi. "Jati-vyaktyoravinaabhaavasambandha" is accepted.

  

Can IVN Acharya explain this line of Kumarilabhatta, again in view of his statement Lakshana is not accepted by Mimamsakas? "लक्षणा नाम काचन शब्दशक्तिःवस्तुतः भाट्टैः नांगीक्रियते एव"
