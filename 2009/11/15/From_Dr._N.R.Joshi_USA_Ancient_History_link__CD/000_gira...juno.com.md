Why Kurus and Kambojas were in ancient Persia in the known history of 539 BC?

Now I am referring to Dr. D. Battacharya's posting of date Oct 29.

In that posting three labels, "Vedic speaking people", "Central Asian s" and "Iranian people" were used. What time frame is used here? How one can decide whowas and whowas not? Darius calls himself Arya and his bhaashaa Aria bhaasha. If there were Vedic speaking people, who were non-vedic speaking in the area covered from the Western most region to Sindhu river including central asia? Why Iranians of 539 Bc should not be called s? Persian kings of the known history (539 BC to 326 BC) were always going towards the west, to Greeceand to Ukraine for empire expansion. They never entered Indian subcontinent except lower Indus region to get elephants.How can we say there was animosity? Ancient Persian soldiers used to make fun of Indian soldiers as DevaYaajo (Deva worshipers). This does not mean that Persians were Asuras or Daityas. According to the knowledge of ancient Persia, in the far ancient times they frequently had wars with Devas because land of Devas was beyond the north border of Persia. Hence they called it "Paradesha" (paradise).

In the western most region of Persia was the ancient kingdom of Medes, very powerful and war people like Kurdish people. Cyrus the great was son-in law of Median king. During expansion of his empire Medes soldiers handed over father-in-law to Cyrus the great because they were impressed by his personality, magnanimity. Persian Empire was called Medo-persian Empire. Medes was the satrapy number 1. Medes were of equal status with Persians in royal honor. Persians entered Babylonian fort of Nebuchadrezar in the night by diverting waters of river. Cyrus the great immediately declared his intentionof expanding empire without hurting anybody. He entered Babylonian temples and declared that your gods were our gods. He burnt incense. Nothing will be destroyed. He made Jews free captured by Nebuchadnezzar. He gave Jews money and told them, "go to Jerusalem and build your temple" Cyrus the great was not Zoroastrian. He knew the ancient history and he had grand vision of civilized world of his time. The name of this founder of Persian empire is in the Old Testament of Bible-- "Cyrus the great is shepherd of the God. God had holden his hand" . Is this magnanimity of Kuru of the known history similar to that of kings from ancient Mahabharat? If yes, then Persians were s. There are many Mahabharat referencesin the Old Testament. More later on. N.R.Joshi.
