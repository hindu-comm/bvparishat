namaste,  
  
I had no idea at all that this was a small closed group of scholars...  
I am no scholar - (no false modesty... I gave up telling lies 10 years  
back)I dont know how I got into this group. My thanks are to vedamata  
and the the person that enrolled me. I am a member of a number of  
email groups.  
  
if it is open group  
1. there must be option to moderate messages at google that needs  
looking up by group-owner  
2. there must be option for member to hide email at google.  
3. selection of members is group-owner/creators prerogative that can  
be exercised  
  
regards
