respected professor Narang,  
I certainly agree with you. we should not discuss anything political  
in this forum.  
things really belong to sanskrit should be discussed here.  
  

but the inherent danger in opening this forum to general public is  
that it may expose us. But then no body would be able to know what it  
it all about. please inform us what to do.  
  
If our email IDs are exposed then also general public can not send  
mails to group, but mischievious persons may/can target indiduals with  
their email IDs. then the individaul mail service providers like  
google/yahoo etc. will have to take care.
