The invasion and migrations are known in all the phases of history. Why do we delimit ourself to Saptasindhu or Kurukshetra or Varanasi. Aryan hymns were composed in Iran, Oxus, Kamboj, Afghanistan, Gandharand their migration in the form of Aasvalaayana, Rsi Grtsamada, Ausanasas, Laata, Bhrigukaccha, Vaadhuula. Baas.kala samhitaa was destroyed by Huunas and the Pandits ran away to Saakala: says the Mahaabhaarata.The evidence of Paanini in Lopah Sakalyasya preserves the same phonetics which was originally in the phonetics of Saalaaturiiya. Even today it continues. Pushkalaavatii which is identified with Katasraaja in Pakistan was a centre of learning which is recognized by Kaatyaayana in his Vaartika in the name of Pauskaraasaadi. Later the survived heritage was compiled by Veda Vyas at Kurukshetra or elsewhere which is supported by our own tradition. The migration from Kashmir to Gandhar; and the Buddhism there is an evidence. It is a question of coming to the truth and not the question of identity or politics. Let us move on the same line.
