***Dear friends,***

***I wonder why you are giving so much importance to the theory of Prof. Max Muller. You know very well that all his his studies and interpretations were circumscribed by***

***1. Creation of the universe around 4006 BC in contrast to 9 billion years believed by modern science.***

***2. No knowledge of evlution of species suggested by Darwan and accepted by the scientists long afterwards.***

***In contrast some of the oldest archelogical remains of the so called Indus valley (actually Saraswati basin) have been dated to about 7000 B.C. It is clear that there has been continuous and uninturrupted growth and upeavals of the Vedic civilization in the area punctuated by the invasion of the Greeks, Shaks, Kushans, Huns and Muslims.***

***Thus the oldest (now) available Vedic archeological remains are about 9000 years old.***

***It is understandable that for political reasons the official historians cannot take these facts into account and ignorance is their best defense. However I do not understand why we should be biased by the official (politically correct) version***

***Yours truky,***

***D.D.Misra***
