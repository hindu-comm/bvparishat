The BVP pays homage to Prof. Achyutananda Dash, Sagar University, who  
passed away in the first week of June. He was a very great scholar of  
Indian darshana and has been teaching for last 18 years at Sagar  
University. His several articles and research publications like  
Vyutapatiivada edition etc are remarkable.  
  
His sudden demise at an early age is a big loss to the Indian  
Scholarship.
