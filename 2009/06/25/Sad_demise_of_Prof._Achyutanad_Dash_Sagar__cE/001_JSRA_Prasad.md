I am shocked. I know Prof. Achyut very well. I deeply mourn his departure. May his soul  
rest in peace. May god give his family the necessary strength to sail forward.  
Prof. Achyut's contributions to darshana is noteworthy. Scholars can think of bringing  
out a commemoration volume on this great scholar.
