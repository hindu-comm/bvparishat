Respected Scholars, Pranam!

This email is just a trial. I would like to see whether I can use Devanagari script and diacritical marks on Roman letter in e-mail to bvparishat list. I used Arial Unicode MS to write the following name. You may use encoding-Unicode (UTF-8) to see it. You can delete this e-mail any time. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
