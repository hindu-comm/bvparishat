It's really terrible to know that Prof. Dash is no more. He was not only a  
great scholar, but also a wonderful person. It was my great privilege to  
know him. He was a good friend. I was planning to see him sometime soon. I  
am very, very sad.  
  
May the Blessings of God protect him in the other world!
