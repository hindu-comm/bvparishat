Dears  
  

We have lost Sri Achyutanand Dash. He will be alive through his wonderful works like Vyutpattivada etc.

  

<http://www.alibris.co.uk/search/books/author/Achyutanand%20Dash>though this link and similar search links give some details, can somebody send exact details about him and his works?

Sri S P Narang has also said these words. What were his future plans?

  

The best ways to give him the श्रद्धाञ्जलि, I think, are -

1\. Adopt his ways in teaching, which he has shown in Vyutpattivada editions.

2\. To complete his unfinished works.

3\. Try to fulfil his dreams.
