Dear Kulakarniji



It has become dificult to afford ample time for searching across Koshas but the following two are green in my

mind --

20 yaavattaavacca saakalye'vadhau maane'vadhaarane(it is not sakala as the Anustup metre is disturbed) - is from Amarakosha(roughly) - Vaagvarga



24 Mahaapadmasca ..... - is from Amarakosha - Svargavarga.



I congratulate you on the endeavour.



with best wishes
