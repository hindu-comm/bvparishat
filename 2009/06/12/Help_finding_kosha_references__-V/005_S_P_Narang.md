Dear Kulakarniji, In continuation to my mail, it is hereby to inform you that one of my students worked on the sources of the dictionary: anekarthakairavakaumudi by Mahendrasuri. It is full of quotations. Zacharia the editor searched only a few from the sources I told. We traced about 3500 quotations on the basis of the dictionaries I mentioned. It is difficult to search the Kosas. For classical Sanskrit, I have huge collection but unclassified: so of no use. Only scriptorium at Pune, Deccan College may provide but the person will have to go there. There is no provision of providing the huge information. Attemp. Best wishes, spnarang
