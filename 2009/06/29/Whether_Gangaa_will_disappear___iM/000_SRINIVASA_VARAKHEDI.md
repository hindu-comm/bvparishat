Dear All,  
  
It was reported in a newspaper that some recent studies revealed that  
after some two centuries there is a fear of disappearance of River  
Ganga. I am shocked. At present as in the past, 40% of Indian  
agriculture is dependent on Gangaa. Our culture is spread over the  
banks of Ganga. We can not imagine the situation of losing Ganga.  
  
Kindly inform if anybody knows any information in our ancient  
literature regarding this ?  
  
regards,  
shrivara
