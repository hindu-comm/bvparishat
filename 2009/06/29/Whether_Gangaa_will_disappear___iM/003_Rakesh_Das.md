I don't think that Ganga will disappear and we should take it as an inevitable. When will our technology will help us then?  
  
As I have seen the dams made up on Ganga are the ones for the deterioration of the condition. Note that I am not against the making of the dams. But they should think of the impact on the basin of the river before and after making the dams. The approach should be more scientific and eco-friendly. The problem is they are not consulting with the environmental scientists and should be more sensetive to the issues.  
  
But the government and a part of the scientists and industrialists seems to be so much concerned with quick material prosperity that they are pretending to be blind to the issues.  
We should promote awareness against it and bring out a strong public opinion.  
  
A great part of our population and many vital cities are dependent upon the Ganga. If Ganga will disappear the aftermaths cannot be predicted.  
  
Already Ganga seems to change its basin. That may be devastating. We have already seen it in Bihar (the flood caused recently in Koshi due to its change of basin).  
  
However I don't think Ganga to be disappeared. Because She is Vishnupadi.  
  
But then also it is our duty to Save Ganga - the sign of our culture.
