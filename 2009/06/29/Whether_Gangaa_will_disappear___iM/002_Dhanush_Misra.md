***Dear Sir,***

***There is nothing surprising about Ganga disappearing in a few centuries. It is well known that Saraswathi, the mighy river which was the cradle of Indian civilisation, has disappeared like that.***

***More over was Ganga is an artificial river brought about by Bhagirath and it is has already spent most of its life.***

***The only river likely to last and help our culture in the future, if we can take proper care of it, is Bramhaputra***

***Yours faithfully,***

***D.D.Misra***
