\<P>Out of Africa theory and Indo-European languages by N.R.Joshi\</P>  
\<P>Respected Scholars, Pranam!\</P>  
\<P>I read about&nbsp;"Out of Africa theory". I do not have opinion on it because it is irrelevant to the ancient Indian history, the origin of Sanskrit&nbsp;and Indo-European language family. On the other hand&nbsp; it might be of interest to find out the role of Mahabharat history in spread of Indo-European languages. I am saying this because archaeological excavations in Bactria-Margiana complex (BAMC), Andronova culture (Kazakhstan)&nbsp;and in the Sinkyang province of China have proved direct contact of Mahabharat history to these regions.Chinese dug out mummies of Asian Amazons described in Mahabharat. These Asian amazons traveled from Inner Asia all the way to modern Turkey area to fight on behalf of Hittites in Trojan war around 1150 BC.Now decide whether Mahabharat wae took place after Trojan war or before it. \</P>  
\<P>I am writing repeatedly that in the known history (539 BC), kings who established and expanded Persian Empire have names of Mahabharat dynasties. This empire spread from Egypt to Sindhu river. It was destroyed by Alexander of Macedonia (E-mathia) because Indians did not go to help&nbsp;even though&nbsp;Darius III&nbsp;sent message to Indians for help. Three red sea coastal area provinces Macia, Kushia and Putia were African satrapies in the Persian Empire.The Persian emperor Darius&nbsp;the Great&nbsp;built Suez canal. His naval admiral Scylax (Carian-Sanskrit Krika-rooster-Marathi-Kombada) explored Sindhu river, went around the empire and wrote the book "Periplus". This book of course is lost.Those Anglosaxon scholars who keep writing history of the world were not on the scene until 400 AD almost 900 years after Persian Empire. If one wants to know the ancient history of Africa, then should not one study ancient Egyptians, and Phoenicians whoes history goes back to 5000 BC?\</P>  
\<P>People always talk about Big Bang, Dianosors, Plate tectonics, Out of Africa theory. I say in what way this knowledge help us when we do not know who was ruling Tamilnadu in 2000BC. Was there Tamil language in 2000 BC? Please point out if I am wrong in my information. I may have different angle to look at the world history.But then everybody is different. Please pardon me for long posting. Thanks. N.R.Joshi\</P>
