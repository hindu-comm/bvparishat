Respected scholars, Pranam!

Saraswatis outside of India by N.R.Joshi

A lot of information on India's dried up Saraswati is published in the proceedings of the first WAVES (World Association of Vedic Studies) conference held in Atlanta 10 years ago. Information on this subject can be obtained from Dr. Bhudev Sharma and Shashi Tiwari (Delhi) and Dr. Kalyanraman (Chenai). However subject of India's Saraswati is controversial. Some alien scholars think that the river Harahati (Haraqhati) from Afghanistan is Vedic Saraswati. This river cuts Afghanistan diagonally from northeast (Himalayas) to southwest. This river ends in a lake on the border of present Afghanistan and Iran. This lake is called Hamun lake at present. This lake was the holy place for ancient Persians and Parthians. In addition there are seven Saraswatis in Afganistan-Kanchanakshi,Vimalodaka, Oghavati, Surenu, Saraswati, and other two names I forgot. They are described in Mahabharat. Then there was the land of Seven Saraswatis in the ancient Kazakhstan (Semi-recye-presence of s in this area is attested by Russians archaeologists). In the conference of Vedic Workshop arranged by Univ. of Texas ,Austin in 2007 I met professor from European countryCroasia (pardon for spelling). I politely asked him, is your contry's name actually "H'Rat"? He said yes. Then I asked him-is this name connected to Saraswati? He said yes. The ancient Iranian beautiful nameAnahita is related to Saraswati (Ardvi-sur-Anahita-Celestial waters).A Houston lady computer professor from Lithuania confirmed that Lithuanian language is realated to Sanskrit and river names in Lithuania are river names of India. When I have so much material to do reasearch in Europe and Asia, why should I go to central Africa thateven could not copy ancient Egyptian civilization? And my search of Africa will start from African people who are close to India-Somalians and Ethyopians. Is not that logical? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
