The question about Anyonyaashraya-Gandhah and Ghranendriya

Gandhah exists independent of one smells it or not. In my opinion Gandhah is the Guna of object like the earth or flower. Also to smell something the Gandha particles need the carrier like air.Ghranendriya recognizes different Gandha. So Gandhah grahakam indriya is ghranendriya and this is OK. I do not see mutual dependency or circular reasoning problem here. In Sanskrit literature on semantics, one comes across both Vyaakarana and Nirvacana.In certain cases of Sanskrit words one cannot offer Vyutpatti based on roots and Vyaakarana. One example is the word "Bhairava". In such cases help of Nirvacanashaastra is taken. In offereing nirvacanas a lot of freedom is taken. Sometimes I get the feeling there must be a third way to offer explanation of certain isolated words from Sanskrit like "Khala" or "Khara". I am new this group. If I have made any errors, please pardon me. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
