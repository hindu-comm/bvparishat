LaTeX is great for the things it does well; it is in fact the system/  
mode of choice for most scientific and mathematical writing, and I use  
it all the time. TeX and LaTeX however do not allow direct entry of  
text in scripts other than Roman, and have no native support for  
Unicode. XeTeX addresses this. See <http://www.ams.org/notices/200901/tx090100052p.pdf>  
for a good article on XeTeX and XeLaTeX (the references cited  
therein are also useful). The XeTeX page is at <http://scripts.sil.org/xetex>  
. I am not aware of XeTeX being used by the Sanskrit/Indian-studies  
scholarly community (though it is used by others), but there is no  
reason this should remain so. If anyone is interested in doing this  
(or has suggestions for suitable Unicode TrueType/OpenType fonts), let  
me know.
