Namaskar to everybody.

There are some problems when one uses Devanagari or Sanskrit fonts. I think the most useful and better solution to get rid of these types of problems is to use onle Unicode fonts. Those fonts are awailable at [www.ildc.in](http://www.ildc.in/) Everyone could use these fonts. Whatever programme you use the unicode is best. One can see the documents very clearly, Windows XP shows all charecters clearly. Most of people use XP, I think.

with regards
