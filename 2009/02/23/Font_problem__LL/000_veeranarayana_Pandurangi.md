Dear Sir, Pranams. grateful for your suggestion.

it is the same problem we are also facing. as a person brought up in bharata, it is not easy, atleast for me,to read romanised sanskrit words. hence I use devanagari in list to write anything in sanskrit.



**I also request all the esteemed members to find some solution to this.

Dear Prof Veeranarayan Pandurangi, Namaste!

I like discussions in the bvparishat group. But most of the time there is problem to read the postiong because the writer is using some fonts and they are replaced by strange symbols by the computer.The same is true for Sanskrit words transcripted in Roman script. I may not have the same fonts and I end up not understanding half of (especialy key Sanskrit words) the posting. Is it possible that all of us use the same font for transcrition of Sanskrit in Roman letters so that postings could be read well and clear? Is it possible to share the common font file so that I can install it on my computer? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
