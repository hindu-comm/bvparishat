Respected Learned Scholars,



Few days back I had received an email from the in-charge of Lalchand Manusript Library, Chandigarh,about their Brochure. She would like to distribute the brochure to all learned scholars that is attached with this email and would like to welcome all suggestions, advices and querry from respected SeniorScholars for the library's development and how its treasure wouldreachto all Indian Scholars.
