That would be interesting. Dineshchandra's works are wellknown and regarded as authentic. If someone else too have dealt with the history of Navya-Nyaaya kindly let us know. S.C.Vidya Bhushan and Th.Stcherbatsky were the pioneers of this type of work. I personally know that furher material existed with Gopinath Kaviraj. But Dineshchandra seems to have worked independent of that in the fifties. Some stray historical notes may be found in some of the works of Kamaleswar Bhattacharya and B.K.Matilal. But I do not know of any woman historian of this subject. Sabita Mishra of Calcutta worked with Madhusudan Nyayacharyain the sixties. Do you mean her?
