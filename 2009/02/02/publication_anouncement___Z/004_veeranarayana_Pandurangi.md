thanks for asking this question the only one I can answer.

Bengal and to speak Mithila scholarshad a long tradition of bestowing upadhi "Degree" to their students. These scholars bestowed degrees suhc as nyayapacanana (vishvanatha), siddhantavagisha (mathuranatha), shiromani(raghunatha), chakravarti, visharada, tarkaratna,tarkalankara (jagadhisha)and many more. these degrees weregiven in all the diciplines upon the completion of studies.

those bengali shcolarsyou are mentioning are in the same line. it has nothing to do with south at all.

but  southern shiromani is a very late one.stated only in the last quarter of 1800s. it is the british title for sanskrit pandits.

there is a book on the "university of bengal or navadvipa"published in kolkota but sorry dont rememer the namedid not note it. it is in pondicherry IFP library.
