Bhagawatgeeta will be taught to masses  

A decision was taken at the all India meeting of Samskrit Bharati to quench  
the thirst of the masses longing for knowing the original meaning of Bhagwat  
geeta. Some people feel unsatisfied by reading the translation of the verses as  
translation is always a reflection of the view of the translator. People want to  
know the exact meaning of the Samskrit words. To faciletate this process teach-  
ers will teach simple Samskrit grammer like Sandhi and Samasa along with the  
meaning of the words . To develop Geeta training centers throughout Bharat a  
chain of tutors will be developed . Six tutors' training camps were fixed there  
and there only - 1.) Thrissure (Kerala) 2.) Madurai (Tamilnadu) 3.) Hydrabad  
(A.P.) 4.) Jabalpur (M.P.) 5.) Bargarh (orrisa) & 6.) Nalbar (Assam). A course  
is prepaired and text books for the students are also printed accordingly . Geeta  
pravesh 1st part is already in the market. Two volumes of 2nd part were inagurated  
at the Kuber Temple of Kurukshetra which was the venue for the meeting on 14th  
feb. at the hands of Shree. Dattatreya Hosbale (Saha Baudhik Pramukh of R.S.S.)
