Subject: Information - SARIT- a Search and Retrieval of Indic Texts  
project - for Devanagari Sanskrit  
To: [sastr...@gmail.com]()

  
Namaste

The following links may be useful for further exploration in relation  
to Samskrutham and Indology studies. The roman script and conventions  
modeled programming is to a long road to get a linguistically and  
culturally appropriate digital display of Brahmi language (= Indian  
languages / Devanagari Samskrutham text display on the browsers. Much  
more is yet to be done for the display of Vedic accented characters,  
even by script ( And Voice issue is far far away!).

The challenging invitation to the Indian tradition and technology  
teams is the following: Do the techno savvy Indian teams want to spend  
all their energy, following the foot prints of western schoalrs in  
fitting a square peg to a round hole by cutting corners ( i.e.  
building font conventions / key stroke conventions for display of  
Devanagari Sanskrit character related glyphs for display and adapt a  
logic of linear European language grammar for analysis of Panini (-  
the generic words like context free grammar, generative grammar do not  
go far in addressing the basic issues here; and study of Sanskrit as  
a language grammar branching out of IE languages in a historic  
perspective would go a long way.) OR would like to address the issue  
as a basic modeling of Human-Machine Communication in multimodal ways  
( which is the real Samskrutham as the Shruti tradition?)

1a) - <http://bombay.indology.info/> A sub resource which provides:

The IndUni fonts have been upgraded. The high-quality OpenType  
"IndUni" fonts allow the representation of Indian-language (and  
similar) material in Roman script using the Unicode character set. The  
fonts contain all the accented characters that Indologists are likely  
to need, as well as all common European accented characters, and many  
others too.

Two Devanagari fonts are available. Nakula and Sahadeva are "twin"  
Devanagari fonts, which have been developed by IMRC, India, for the  
University of Cambridge. Both fonts are TrueType/OpenType, and are  
Unicode compliant. Both contain all the conjuncts and other ligatures  
(including Vedic accents) likely to be needed by Sanskritists. Nakula  
follows the Bombay style of Devanagari, with rounded glyphs and little  
thin/thick variation. Sahadeva is in the Calcutta style, with more  
angular glyphs and greater contrast between thin and thick strokes.  
The actual shapes of some of the glyphs (e.g. initial "a", retroflex  
"n") also differ according to the style of the font.

2\) <http://sarit.indology.info/top.shtml> - SARIT is short form for  
Search and Retrieval of Indic Texts The branched offshoot - SARIT  
displays Indological texts marked up according to Text Encoding  
Initiative (TEI) guidelines. SARIT provides Indological scholars with  
digital instruments for philological research. It uses a modified  
version of PhiloLogic™, a platform developed by the ARTFL Project and  
Digital Library Development Center at the University of Chicago.  
PhiloLogic™ is widely deployed in the digital humanities as a  
full-text search, retrieval and analysis tool for large TEI document  
collections. Notable installations include Perseus Project Texts  
Loaded under PhiloLogic™ and the Digital Dictionaries of South Asia.

SARIT provides Indologists with machine readable texts and digital  
instruments for philological research. Currently text search,  
retrieval and analysis is available for these works.

For your needful information and exploration please.
