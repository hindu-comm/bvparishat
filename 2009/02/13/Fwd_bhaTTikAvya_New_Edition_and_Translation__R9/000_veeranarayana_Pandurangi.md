Subject: Bhaṭṭikāvya: New Edition and Translation  
To: [INDO...@liverpool.ac.uk]()

  
Dear List Members,

Published by the Clay Sanskrit Library ([www.claysanskritlibrary.org](http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org)):

Bhatti's Poem: The Death of Ravana

<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volume-v-78.html>

Romanised text and facing page translation. The translation is literal  
enough to be a useful study aid.

The Bhaṭṭikāvya provides a systematic illustration of large sections  
of Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī. The sūtras illustrated in each verse are given  
in the notes so that it is possible to read the Bhaṭṭikāvya in  
conjunction with a commentary such as the Kāśikā or a derivative work  
such as the Siddhāntakaumudī. In many cases Bhaṭṭi uses the exact  
words or phrases that are also the standard examples in the  
commentaries.

There are notes giving references to alaṃkāra texts for Canto 10 which  
illustrates the figures of speech.

Significant variants are discussed in the notes.

It also happens to be a damn good poem.
