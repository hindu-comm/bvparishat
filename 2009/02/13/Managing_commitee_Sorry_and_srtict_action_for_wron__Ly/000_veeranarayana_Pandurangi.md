Dear Friends and all the members of this gruop,

I am sorry for sending some message that was supposed to be sent to  
the person who had sent this message.  
but any how this is the right message for the whole group that we need  
to discuss only scholarly maters and nothing else.

the person who had sent that message and the previous one also are  
temporarily barred from sending messages though they can receive them.  
If the situation woresens then we retain our right to totally ban  
such members.

In the same line I invite members to form a some kind of managing  
commitee to monitor these kinds of activities. that commitee will also  
decide whom to admit to group etc. It is the responsibilities of the  
members to see the group grow, though I have created this group it  
does not belong to me, and neither to any one. hence constituting a  
commitee is necessary one. some five or six senior members can do  
this job I hope.  
thanks for cooperating  
veeranarayana
