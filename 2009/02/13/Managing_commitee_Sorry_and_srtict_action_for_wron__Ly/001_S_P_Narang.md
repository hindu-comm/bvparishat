Dear Veeranarayana, and all! do something so that it becomes an academic forum and not a general forum like the other websites. It is vidvatparishad and not lokaparishad. It should not be biased by any religion, political party, particular concept etc. those who wish to make it for their profit should be deleted from the membership immediately. Again I request that it should only be academic.Academic controversies should be welcomed. Best wishes to all. spnarang
