i am afraid to anounce that I heard this half with anothter half  
व्यवहारे भाट्टनयः तार्किकस्याथ वा नयः।  
it is because advaitins want to establish total advaita and people  
like shriharsha and anandabodha in his tarkasangraha (different work  
that annambhattaas namesake, baroda publication) make it clear that  
there is no pramana in advaita (vedantaparibhasha came too late) hence  
they have to accept somebody's pramanas. so do accept either bhatta or  
naiyayika to do some vyavahara. paramarthataya there is no pramana at  
all. please also look for this sentence where it firts occurs
