namo vidvadbhyah  
  
In **MImAmsA** there are two sides chiefly - **BhAtta** and **PrAbhAkara .  
**  
The main differences are as follows --  
  
1. **Anupalabdh**i - **BhAttas** accept **Anupalabdh**i as the cause of **AbhAvapratyaksa** , **PrAbhAkara**s wo'nt .  
  
2. **AbhAva** - it is **AdhikaranAtmaka** according to **PrAbhAkara**s , **BhAtta**s do not agree to this .  
 In other **Darsanas** the sentence - **abhAvah adhikaranAtmakah iti mImAmsakamatam** - is seen and the same is applicable to **PrAbhAkara**s but not **BhAtta**s .  
  
3**. AkhyAti and AnyathAkhyAti** : **PrAbhAkaras** follow **AkhyAti** - they do not accept **suktirajatajnAna as 'bhrama**' . All the **jnAna**s are **Prama**s - they argue .  
In the case of ' **idam rajatam**' - **idamAkArajnAnam is pratyaksAtmakam . RajatAkArajnAnam** smaranAtmakam .  
Generally , the **smrtijnAnamis grhItagrahanAtmakam** , but here due to **'dosa**' (deect) the **grhItattvAmsa** is left behind and there is only **grahanAtmaka** .  
Since the **drastA** does not know that there is no relation between **suktika and rajata** , being a rajatArthI , he would have pravrtti in suktika .  
  
**BhAtta**s take it as **'anyathAkhyAti**' , also called ' **viparItakhyAti**' - in the case of **suktirajata** , the **jnAnam ' idam rajatam'** - is **AnyathAkhyAti** and simply ' **vivekAgrahanam**' cannot be called **'bhrAnti'**  
  
See **SAnkarabhAsyam on 'athAto dharmajijnAsA' - Aha ko'yamadhyAso nAmeti ? ucyate -paratra pUrvadrstAvabhAsah , tam kecit danyatra anyadharmAdhyAsa iti vadanti , kecittu yatra yadadhyAsah tadvivekAgrahanibandhanahbhramah iti , anye tu ... sarvathApi tvanyasya anyadharmAvabhAsatAm na vyabhicarati , tathA ca loke'nubhavah - suktikA hi rajatavadavabhAsate iti ekascndrah sadvitIyavaditi (AdhyAsabhAsyam) .  
**  
It is generally said that **Advaitins** acept ' **AnirvacanIyakhyAti** ' - this is not said by **Sankara** but by latter commentators .  
  
In '**siddhAnta'** it is **'Brahman**' but in **'VyavahAra'** it is **BhAttanayah** , **na tu PrAbhAkaranayah**  
**navA NyAyanayah, nvA Vaisesikanayah** etc.  
  
After all **VedAntin**s can have their own '**naya**', if they want but they followed **Bhatta** , why ? because it is logical and widely accepted .  
  
Joke - **PrabhAkara** takes up **UpanisadvAkya**s also for analysis , **KumArila** does not .
