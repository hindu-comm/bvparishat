I do not have the claim that both are identical but only I am trying to assert that in Abhihitanvayavad first the meaning of wordsare understood then they are known in relation with each other trough Tatparya Virtti; on the other hand in the theory of Sansargamaryada it isaccepted but a little nit of modification that the realtion of Padarthas is not known through Tatpary Vritti but Akanksha which is not a Vritti.
