\> Dear friends,  
  

Ayi bhoh,  
There is controversy between the Advaitavedantins and the  
Naiyayikas, as to whether anumiti should be taken as the effect of the  
two cognitions vyaptijnana and paksadharmatajnana or as the effect of  
the complex cognition called paramarsa. In fact, the controversy  
between the Advaitaved¡ntins and the Naiyayikas was a continuation of  
that between the Mimasakas and the Naiyayikas. Of the two schools of  
the Mimamsa¡ namely Bhatta and Prabhakara, the Advaitavedantins  
followed the former for all practical purposes. Hence originated the  
saying among the Advaitavedantins -vyavahare bhattanayah.
