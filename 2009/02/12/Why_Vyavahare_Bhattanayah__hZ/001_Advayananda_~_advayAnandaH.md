Dear Sachchidananda Mishraji,

Hari Om

  

Pramana-prameya-vyayhara comes under the purview of Vyavahara-satta and not paramathka-satta.  

The Bhattas and the Advaitans accept all the six pramanas including Anupalabdhi (unlike the Naiyayika and the followers of other schools.) Hence the the pramana-premeya-vyavyahara of the Advaitin follows closely that of the Bhattas. It is because of this reason that it is it is said Vyavahare bhattanayah advaitinah.  

I hope this answers your query.

  

In Shri Guru Smriti,

Swami Advayananda
