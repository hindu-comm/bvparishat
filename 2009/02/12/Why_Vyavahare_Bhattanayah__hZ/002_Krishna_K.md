An answer to this can be from a historical perspective where no other  
school places as much emphasis on Veda as does pUrvamImAmsA. While  
advaita differs from the pUrvamImAsa only on the part of veda that  
they focus on; and the fundamental support to advaita, if any, should  
come from Veda. nyAya, sAmkhya, buddhism etc. give more importance to  
logic or their propounder, than to the Veda. This could be why bhATTas  
were the closest match. It could also be that bhATTas were considered  
stronger opponents of buddhism etc at that time, than was nyAya or  
other schools. Hence the orientation towards bhaTTa school.
