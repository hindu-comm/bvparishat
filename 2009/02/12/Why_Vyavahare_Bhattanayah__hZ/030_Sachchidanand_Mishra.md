Dear Pandurangeeji,  

My question is at the same place. I had seen the reference you provide now. My point is there should be any deep connection between Advaitic metaphysics and व्यवहारे भाट्टनयः. As Prof. Subrahmanyam Korada has shown there are a few points where we can see very clearly that Advaitins accept the Prabhakar view not the Bhatta view. For example AbhAva is AdhikaranAtmaka according to PrAbhAkaras but BhAttas do not agree to this. And here Advaitins take the side of Prabhakaras.

One point I would like to suggest in relation with the mail of Prof.Subrahmanyam Koradaji that the Bhattas do not accept Anupalabdhi as the cause of AbhAvapratyaksa but only cause of Abhavajnana. This is the position of Adviatins they do accept Anupalabdhi as the cause of Abhavapratyaksa.

Thanks for remembering my question
