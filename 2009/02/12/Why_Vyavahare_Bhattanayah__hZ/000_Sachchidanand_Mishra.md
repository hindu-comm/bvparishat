Dear friends,  
I have been wondering for a long time that why the Advaitins accept  
the rule "Vyavahare Bhattanayah" व्यवहारे भाट्टनयः। My problem is that  
the Advaitins accept three types of सत्ता प्रातिभासिक, व्यावहारिक एवम्  
पारमार्थिक। According to the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, परमार्थतः  
there is only one सत्ता, that is Brahman, and if so why then this type  
of obstinacy that in व्यवहार they argue for that there they would  
accept only भाट्टनय। If in their philosphy there is a clear cut  
difference between व्यवहार and परमार्थ, I am not able to understand  
that if they accept any other philosophy at the level of व्यवहार there  
would be any harm or problem in accepting that. If at the level of  
व्यवहार they accept the न्यायनय would there arise any problem?
