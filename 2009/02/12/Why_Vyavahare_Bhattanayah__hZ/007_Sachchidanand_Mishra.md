Your answer seems somehow half satisfactory, this is true that no other  
school places as much emphasis on Veda as does pUrvamImAmsA. But again the problem seems unanswered, because there are other schools to which give emphasis on VedAnta. We know there are many VedAnta school, but not a single has this type of claim व्बवहारे भाट्टनयः.
