This is the logic, I heard some where,behind this acceptance - every school needs प्रमाणव्यवस्था and प्रमाणव्यवस्था (pramANa & prameya vyavasthaa). Each needs muchtimeto be toughed and to be established. Since Advaita wanted to focus on prameya part it accepted Bhaatta school's view about pramANa. It helped to concentrate on prameya.
