Thank you very much for your response but i am unable to digest your answer, the reason is that the theory अभिहितान्वयवाद is not only acceptable to Bhattas but also to Naiyayikas. When Naiyayikas do say that the relation is known through संसर्गमर्यादा it is nothing but the acceptance of अभिहितान्वयवाद in other worlds. It seems to me only a verbal desput between Nyaya and Bhatta school. This could be a matter of question that whether it islogical to accept for a Naiyayyika that the निर्विकल्पक बोध is generated by any sentence as Advaita Vedantins would have to believe, but the same question can be asked to Bhattas, according to their epistemology.

Therefore, this reason does not seem probable. I think there must be any deep link between the concept of Brahman and the acceptance of 'Vyavahare Bhattanayah' .
