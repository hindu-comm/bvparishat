Dear scholar,  
Please take note of the quotation from Mahabhasya "yadatraadhikyam sa vaakyaarthah. kosou? visheshanavisheshyabhaavo naama." If we delete the padarthas from the meaning cognaised from a senrense the remaning samsarga is treated as "vaakyaartha". Here vaakyaartha means that,
which is cognaised from a sentense.The question  

is wheter it is vrittibhasya or not? Naiyayikas say that it is not vrittibhasya.  
regards,  
kvrk
