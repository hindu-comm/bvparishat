thanks for both profss Koradaji and mishraji.

point is

Vyayahara means not the opposite of paramartha. But वाग्व्यवहार, विवाद, dealing with others. this is meant in all the vyavahars found in dharmashastras, ayurveda etc.That means advaitins follow bhattas only in dealing with others. because advaitins dont accept any pramana (as illustrated in चित्सुखी and खण्डनखण्डनखण्डखाद्य), but they need these pramanas to deal with others for refuting or supporting their own positions.

so for this Vyayahara, advaitins use bhatta's pramanas. व्यवहारे भाट्टनयः does not refer to ontology. it does not make anydifference inव्यवहारevenif AbhAva is AdhikaranAtmaka according to PrAbhAkaras butnot forBhAttas And here Advaitins take the side of Prabhakaras.  
that is ontology and not व्यवहार. I hope this makes sense.
