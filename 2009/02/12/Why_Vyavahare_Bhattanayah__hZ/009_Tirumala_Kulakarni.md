The प्रमाणव्यवस्था of is much vast. It is not just question of numbers, nature, classification. If x school's प्रमाणव्यवस्था matches 70% and y school's 60% then certainly one should goes for previous. For instance both Bahaattas and advaitins accept jnaatataa. So Bhattas come more nearer than any others. This could be the reason. Any way we should explore more minute similarities to astablish this point.
