Hari Om,

True, you pointed out important thing but my problem is that this rule seems to me very superficial. Let me make it clear, it can't be the basis for the rule in question because Nyaya also accept those pramanas, Pratyaksha is accepted, Anuman is also accepted, in addition to in Nyaya Anuman is three kind of, and on the other hand in Bhatta school anuman is twofold Kevalanvayi and Anvayavyatireki, it does not make anytrue difference that Naiyayikas call that Kevalavyatireki Anumana, and Bhattas call it Arthapatti. It should also taken into consederation that Advaitins do not accept Kevalanvayi type of inference. It goes against the Nyaya notion and also Bhatta notion. Upamana is used in different sense in Bhatta school knowing the similarity in Gavaya, through Upamana pramana we know the similarity in Go of Gavaya, Naiyayikas would not accept it, they would say that we know it through Anumana. Only one pramana is left Anupalabdhi, what the Advaistins would find the difficulty in acceopting that absence in known through perception but not through Anupalabdhi Pramana. The Nyaya theory of Pramana is wel developed, accepting that I think they would not fall in any trouble.
