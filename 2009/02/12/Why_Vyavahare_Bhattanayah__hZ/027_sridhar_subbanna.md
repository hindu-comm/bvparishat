Dear Scholars,  
I had thought about this some time back and my imagination goes like this.  
In the process of revolution, what would be the reason for accepting Advaita ? Answer would be that, during that time when Mimamsakas and Buddhists were trying to establish their positions. Mimasakasas seemed to be right from the day to day activities and following the tradition and vedic culture but rejected the thinking beyond the swarga etc. Buddhists seemed to be right looking beyond this mundane samsara but rejected the vedic tradition. Synthesis happened in Advaita. Advaita took best of both. At paramarthika level accepted most of the buddhist thinking and tried to prove using the Vedas (Aranyakas,Updanishads). Concept of Brahman in Advaita and Shoonya in Buddhism looks very similar (Both can only be experienced and cannot be described in words) . At the vyavahara level accepted the bhatta mimamsakas who are more into the vedic culture and tradition compared to the nyaya (mainly into logical thinking). It was easy for people to digest this than to come out of tradition to accept something new or reject the new thinking that was gaining popularity totally.  
Hence "व्यवहारे भाट्टनयः".  
  
We are seeing another such situation now. Science becoming popular and we are trying to map the traditional knowledge or shastras in scientific terms.  
  
Please pardon me if I have wasted your time. Eager to know the fallacies in this thinking.  
  
Regards  
Sridhar S.
