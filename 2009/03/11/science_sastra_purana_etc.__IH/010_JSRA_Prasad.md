Dr. Murty garu,  
  
I am enjoying your scholarly discussions on the subject. Thanks for sharing details of yours and your students works on the same. When there is no need to detail more about the mundane sciences, in olden days, how could you show evidence in terms of proteins or genomes? Once, the genome project is successful, I cann't imagine what kind of catastrophes will take place. Our ancestor's needs and requirements were different as they never sought any material comforts. But still, at times, the modern sciences such as medicine etc., are heavily dependent on ancient Indian medicine. One example is jaundice. Thanks for thought provoking discussions by Prof. Sarma and other scholars.
