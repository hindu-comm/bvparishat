namasthe,  

  
\>I attest your feeling on Manusmrti. But when you have the power to delete the

\> uncessary propaganda to the next generations who may think exactly like you.  

\> I quote Kalidasa, '\*sataam hi sandeha padeshu vastushu, pramaanam  
\> antahkaraNa pravrttayaH'.\*  
  
I cannot delete a single phoneme from any sacred bhAratIya scripture  
because I know me a lot less than I know others.( even that little was  
learnt with great difficulty)  
  
1. I want to be comfortable in oddest situations - ever travel in the  
Mumbai locals - you will know what I mean. And one situation is no  
less uncomfortable than the other. And  
2. I don't know when to stop. I will keep improving the get up  
continually until evrything is made trim and proper in the image of my  
own thinking. I keep telling even my deva continually that they are so  
foolish and such bad managers.  
  
3.I thank them for never doing the "pratyaksham" act ever and telling  
me to mind my business. This saves me from an embarassing situation  
and yet another dvandata - whose world is it ? Mine or yours or  
theirs.  
  
4. mR^ityuproktaaM nachiketo.atha labdhvaa  
vidyaametaaM yogavidhiM cha kR^itsnam.h .  
brahmapraapto virajo.abhuudvimR^ ityu\\-  
ranyo.apyevaM yo vidadhyaatmameva .. 18..  
saha naavavatu . saha nau bhunaktu . saha viiryaM karavaavahai .  
tejasvinaavadhiitam astu maa vidvishhaavahai .. 19..  
AUM shaantiH shaantiH shaantiH ..  
  
5. vid is vid and avid is also vid. shraddha and sandeH are invaluble  
methodologies for scientific inquiry.  
  
6.I choose not to put things on pedestals because I am capable of  
removing the pedestal too. In the matter of the smRuti, and the  
popular bhagavad gIta - preferring the neat looking volumes of ISKCON  
but find they are heavily doctored- I did not read mahAbhArata or  
bhAgavatham. Perhaps it is easier to pass them on with key annotations  
- not too many to divert the child away from the real wealth and the  
main text.  
  
7 . Baroda, Calcutta, Pune, Harvard - Kyoto John Smith et al.,  
"critical" edition of Mahabharata - Bhandarkar Institute, Cambridge -  
etc. interpolated verses would all go snip snip if I exercise my  
choice - I find all that abhorrent in mahAbhArat.  
  
regards
