Dear Scholars,  
  
Sometimes in the discussion on ancient Indian science, the scientific  
achievements of the ancient Indian grammarians tend to get neglected.  
Panini's grammar, for example, is sophisticated scientific work, using the  
word "scientific" quite almost (if not exactly, which is not unexpected)in  
the way it is used these days.  
  
Best regards,  
B.N.Patnaik
