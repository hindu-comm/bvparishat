Dear Sir, I fully agree with what you have written or said. I have  
lot of regard for your sustained effort. My point is this. We lost  
that scientific tradition (almost!). The instruments of those times  
or their improved versions are no longer being developed.  
  
The science is dynamic. As we explore more, we know more about our  
ignorance also apart from gained a deep specialized knowledge in a narrow  
area. May be there are limits to science also.
