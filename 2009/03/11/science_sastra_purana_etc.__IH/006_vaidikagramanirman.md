namasthe,  
  
congratulations on your masterly approach... but to what problem?  
  
1. My father told me when I was a child "understand the question...  
that is half the solution"  
  
1.1 Trying to understand your attempt and those of many others for a  
number of years has kept me quite busy.  
  
1.1.1 dvandata - dichotomy is core problem - this what I can gather.  
  
1.1.2 I grew up with implications and outright lies taught that there  
is dichotomy between our traditional dhArma, dhArmika approaches and  
so called modern approaches in all spheres of my life - learning,  
eating, sleeping, living, doctors and even death and even after that.  
This is "convent educated "science" followed by University learnt  
models and modern day life.  
  
1.1.3 saw differences galore but did not take anything for granted -  
as my father and tradition taught me to devise my own guage - of  
course if there was time - with so much to learn. I never knew that  
bhAskara, pANiNi, varaha-mihIra, Arybhatta, or Apasthambha lived as  
also the galaxy of RuShi had anything to do with "science" or  
scientific thought and "REALITY" and "TRUTH" until just 6 years back.  
  
1.1.4 dvandata - dichotomy is core problem alright - is this in my  
mind ? Yes, it is - and I AM RESPONSIBLE - not my teachers, but no  
need to sit and cry - The faculty may have retired or even died - but  
my faculties are very much alive - so, LEARN - what to do and what not  
to do too.  
  
1.1.5 vaisheshika sUtra gives me a concrete objective "yatho abhyudAya  
nishreyasa siddhi sa dharmaH" and this is "Eu - science".  
  
1.1.6 whose abhyudhAya - mine of course - my neighbour and save the  
earth comes next - This also removes the dvandata in the shrAddha as  
well piTru RuNam, Rushi RuNam and daiva RuNam - My ancestors as I know  
them may have be disgusted with the unhygeinic piNda I may make and  
offer - but with shraddha shrAddha takes on meaning to me and it is my  
birthright. My ancestors want me and their lineage to be prosperous  
and happy in realtime anytime.  
  
1.2 My dichotomy is resolved - I see no reason to have less conviction  
with "dharma" and "dhArmika" literature and more belief in sants,  
teachers, pravacanists of any kind whether they have a Ph.D. or not.  
  
1.2.1. My father taught me to abhor "pass the exam coaching classes  
and exam guides" - Why would they prescribe text books? These belong  
to a category that has disastrous consequences to my learning why? I  
may beleive that I know the subject not having read the texts at all.  
  
1.2.2 But I don't have TIME. Who ever said I don't have it - TIME is  
figment of my imagination, in fact it is a figment of collective  
human imagination. Time is an arbitrary unit of measure observors  
collectively have agreed to reference moving objects (and everything  
has been ever moving) - (gathered from vaisheshika sUtra and Atharva  
veda - kAla sUktham)  
  
2. As far as I am concerned "Science - Shastra" duality does not exist  
except in the mind.  
  
3. There is a fundamental - difference in the modern day approaches as  
being taught and understood and the traditional dhArmka bhAratIya  
approaches - and the bhAratIya ought to do anything possible.  
  
3.1. the modern day approach is junk as trash "old" things - the  
dhArmika approach is to reasure "old" things even if it has no  
relevance to you and you may think it "bullshit".  
  
3.2 The dhArmik approach is right - we today in 2009 have no right in  
fact absolutely barbaric to deny the child of the future - its God  
given right to read and pass it on. This right was never denied to me  
(when I grew to an understanding age) - My father and ancestors said  
"This is the veda - we pass it on to you - to understand and use more  
than we have understood and used" -  
  
3.2.1 So it is that most abhorrent things to me have been found even  
in manu smRuti - "a shudrA should name his child the most abhorrent  
name" - (sorry I have the ref but cannot post it rightaway) - A bit of  
meditation - and asking myself - "could manu have really said that?"  
the answer is crystal clear - No. why? - "I know manu -and it is  
dharma that he is talking about" How come it is there in the smRuti?  
and my eyes are filled with tears - it was put in by some miscievious  
bigot perhaps through torture - and it has been passed on intact for  
generations - They gave me the glorious opportunity and total trust in  
a distant future to exercise my God given birthright to think and  
decide. shatakoThi vandanam. What should I do? - Do I have the power  
to delete the words - I can but will not - I will be denying the  
future.  
  
I will pass on with reverence anything that is my heritage.  
  
  
Best wishes and regards  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
this what I can gather  
  
  
  
This is what I had gathered for a number of years - almost a life time  
in fact.  
My solution was to live in the "dichotomy"
