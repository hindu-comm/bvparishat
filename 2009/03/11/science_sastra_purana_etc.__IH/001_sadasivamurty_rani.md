**5. Some Concrete Examples for instruments used in Ancient times**

**The following are some instruments used in various branches of sciences in ancient India:**

**a) In the System of Ayurveda according to Garuda Purana (Where we have information on this subject extending to a length of 125 chapters) there is a detailed description of 126 surgical instrumetns under six classes.**

**b) In the Treatises on Chemistry particularly in the Rasatantra Granthas we have Guidelines for constructing a Chemical Laboratory with nearly Five hundred types of instruments the names of which are all readily available with me.**

**c) In the books on Astronomy and in the sections of Astronomy in Puranas we have a detailed description of Sanku Yantra, Cakra Yantra, Nadivalaya Yantra and other such Yantras for calculating Longitudes, Latitudes, The movements of Sun, Moon and other planets.**

**d) As far as the Ancient Agriculture is concerned we have more than 50 instruments including Dhaara Yantras for Drip Irrigation.**

**In this manner I can list out many more Instruments pertaining to different disciplines of Sciences used by our ancient seerswhom we can call as the First Generation Scientists of the World.**

**This is the gist of one of the Fifty Research Papers I wrote on Ancient Indian Scientific Knowledge as a result of my 28 years incessant study.**
