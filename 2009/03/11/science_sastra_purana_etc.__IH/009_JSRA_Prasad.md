All of our darshanas preach the ultimate solutions for our miseries. According to Kanada, once you know the true nature of the substances (*padartha*s) listed then you will obtain abhyudaya which reaches you to the ultimate nisshreyasa.Also the word dharma in the above aphorism refers to the attributes or qualities of the substances. By knowing the similarities and dissimilarities of these, one's ignorance is destroyed. But I am not getting what is 'Eu-science'.

This is what Vaiseshikas say. Once the *apekshabuddhi* diminishes, then there is no kind of duality in the physical phenomenon.

BORI, Pune has brought out the critical edition of Mahabharata wherein they have separted the interpolated verses numbering 27 thousands. So, I attest your feeling on Manusmrti. But when you have the power to delete the abhorrent things why don't you do so? It seems that we are transferring the uncessary propaganda to the next generations who may think exactly like you. I quote Kalidasa, '*sataam hi sandeha padeshu vastushu, pramaanam antahkaraNa pravrttayaH'.*
