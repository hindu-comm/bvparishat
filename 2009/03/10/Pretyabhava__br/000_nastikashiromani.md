In Goutama's Nyaya-Sutra sutra 1.1.10, pretyabhava is said to be a  
prameya.  
What does this pretyabhava actually mean in his times?  
  
It is mostly translated as transmigration or afterlife.  
But did Goutama actually mean this when he was using this term or did  
he mean life and death etc?  
  
I would like someone with thorough knowledge of Sanskrit of that age  
to answer this because the commentators starting from vacaspati are  
all theists who take it for granted that this can be the only  
meaning.
