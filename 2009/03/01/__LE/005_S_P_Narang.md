Dr. Murty, I want it actually for medicinal purpose. It is definitely a clay related to the mountain : may be that of Simhala dviipa. Its relation is particularly to bones and its diseases. I do not know whether fragrant clay of the Vaishnavas can heal bone. It is like the clay Gazani which came from Gazani and used in a number of diseases. Its identity will reveal something in the history of medicine and its migration. I will also search. Regards, spnarang
