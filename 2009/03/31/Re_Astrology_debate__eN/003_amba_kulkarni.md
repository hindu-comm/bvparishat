Today Somebody brought to my notice an interesting article:  
  
"Believing in Treatments That Don’t Work" available at  
<http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/the-ideology-of-health-care/?hp>  
  
After reading this article (and several such earlier) I am curious to  
know, what is that yardstick which makes Medicine a science, and  
astrology not?
