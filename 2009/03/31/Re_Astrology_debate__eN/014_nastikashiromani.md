Well if I am intellectually immature perhaps you can tell me how  
religions through the ages had advanced knowledge about the material  
world?  
The comment about abrahamic religions further prove my point. There  
can be no debate because all questions are settled. Since in Islamic  
states even today you neck will be on the chopping block if you dare  
to say anything other than Koran is THE answer to everything  
questioners have to run away to other countries.  
  
“leave science to those of us who are in fact scientists”.  
And what kind of scientist are you? One of the Intelligent design  
group?  

  
"If you have nothing to say, don't say it,"  

. "'Tis better to be quiet and thought a fool, than to speak and  
remove all doubt,"  
  

That child was surely a fool then who spoke up and revealed that the  
emperor was naked while the wiser adults insisted he had new clothes  
on?  

  
perhaps you would be so kind as to spend some time understanding  
these before  
inflicting your claptrap on others.  
  

And perhaps you could be so kind as to really read Dawkins’ books and  
understand that just because he is focused on Christianity & Islam  
(because as he says he does not know much about Hinduism) does not  
mean he looks upon Hinduism in any positive light or thinks that  
astrology in any way can be compared with astronomy.  

  
No scientist today makes such a simplistic claim, which is  
almost worse than "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny."  
  

Fine then tell me what do modern biologists think about the cause for  
morality in humans?
