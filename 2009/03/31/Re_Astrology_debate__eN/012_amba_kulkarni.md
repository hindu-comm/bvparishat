Thank you Srinidhi ji and Nastikshoromani ji,  
  
When you say it is the evidence, or the experiments, the next question  
is:  
  
How do you measure the success/failure of such experiments?  
Naturally through some Statistical measures, isn't it?  
  
That is why I had also suggested that "We can think of some  
experiments  
resulting in the quantitative analysis."  
  
It is not an easy task to define an experiment in case of astrology.  
Of course, with educated people turning to Astrology, now there is a  
growing  
tendency among the practicing astrologers who are serious about their  
profession  
to preserve the data, analysis etc for research purpose.  
But still there is a long way to go.  
  
regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
