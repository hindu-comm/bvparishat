Dear amba kulkarni,  
you asked what makes medicine a science and astrology not.  
  
According to me, medicine is a science because it works most of the  
time. You take a sleeping pill and you fall asleep. Barring a few  
cases where because of some chemical imbalance or habit this does not  
work, this is a reliable prediction.  
That is why terms like Western and eastern medicine are nonsense.  
Either it works or not, whether it is from the west or from Ayurveda.  
  
Astrology --- is it as reliable as a sleeping pill?  
that is preciely why I am calling for the experiment. It will prove  
astrology to be reliable or not.

\> After the NYT report itmay not be difficult to find out the cause -- 'There's something wrong in the theory'. The treatment then shall be given up by the whole community of medical practitioners.This has happened with many drugs -- analgin(USSRP) and aspirinfor analgesic treatment, for example.  
\> Now, that 'There's something wrong in the theory'is often apparent withastrology too, with millions reporting poor resultfrom astrological findings and giving up their belief.Butone finds thedifference from the case with medicine. The failed casesare not reported in the NYT. Even if they were, would thecommunity ofastrological practitioners have taken any notice orgive up? Indeed there is a difference.  
\> Medical theory and practiceare continuously subjected to the trial and error process and the result becomes known to the whole medical, and often patient, world. The NYT column reported here is an evidence. Astrologicaltheory and practiceare not continuously subjected to the trial and error process. There are indeed failure cases butthey are not reported for fear of hurting believers.
