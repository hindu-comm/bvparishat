All religions pretend to know the answers to the big questions in  
materialism --- who created the universe? Is there life after death?  
Can we manipulate the environment so successfully that results are  
guaranteed? Does consciousness exist independent of the body? They  
make a pretty profit from it too. So the nastikas are attacked because  
nastikas say theri cherished beleifs are wrong and jeopardise the  
priesthood's livelihood.  

  
"The question is relevant insofar as you consider your life to be  
lived  
inside a fairytale (with apologies to Hans Christian Andersen) and has  
no place in a serious debate"  

My immature mind translates this as "I am not getting into a debate  
since I cannot rationally support my beliefs" \[shrug\]  
  
  
It is very well to say you are a scientist --- but what do you  
believe? Do you believe:  
  
A creator God?  
There is a heaven?  
The soul exists after the body has died?  
Karma and rebirth?  
An immaterial consciousness that sustains the world and will liberate  
us from samsara?  
  
In short, is your worldview based on current science with leeway for  
new theories and revisions or is it something else?
