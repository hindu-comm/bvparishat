Such puerile generalizations hardly serve any purpose except to  
highlight one's own ignorance and intellectual immaturity. In any  
case, religion is not unified as one, with a unified approach; for  
example, there is no commentarial or polemical tradition to speak of  
in Islam or indeed in any of the Abrahamic faiths. The only reason  
much debate arises in the Indic traditions is because questions are  
not considered settled (or subject to settling by force), so we have  
the पूर्वपक्ष, संशय,  
सिद्धान्त structure. One may of course disagree with  
particular positions or claims (as indeed the various traditions and  
classical authors often disagree with one another), but finding fault  
with the polemical or scholarly practice is itself hardly justified.

\> Science genuinely believes in 'charaivati, charaivati'.

Science itself does not believe anything, good or bad, though  
particular scientists might. In any case, it also does not cover a  
lot of areas even having nothing to do with religion -- the arts and  
humanities for example.

You still haven't understood. Science does not in fact tell us  
anything worthwhile in many cases including the ones I mentioned.

What you are however missing is the point that science is not  
something an ordinary person with limited learning can just make up as  
he goes along; leave science to those of us who are in fact  
scientists. "If you have nothing to say, don't say it,"  
इत्युक्तेः. "'Tis better to be quiet and thought a  
fool, than to speak and remove all doubt," इति च.

There are scientific critiques of theistic positions that are  
considerably better than yours (think Richard Dawkins, Daniel C.  
Dennett, even \`Why I Am Not a Christian' by Bertrand Russell); perhaps  
you would be so kind as to spend some time understanding these before  
inflicting your claptrap on others.

Human limitations are of course one thing, but a lot of problems today  
are not just because these prevent science from progressing. Many  
people the world over are starving today not because our knowledge of  
science is not advanced enough to feed them, but because human society  
(especially the powerful) are apathetic to their suffering and  
unwilling to address it if it means any significant sacrifice. It is  
just not sensible to suggest that science will make such problems go  
away, or that the limitations of human understanding make them  
impossible to address.

That might be an argument against a faith healer or a proponent of  
"healing prayer" (a/k/a Christian science) or whatever, but no one  
here has taken such a position. Even against such a position, the  
argument is considerably more complicated than your simplistic summary  
suggests, because the faithful come up with counter-examples where  
modern science has failed (e.g., stage-4 cancers) but the patient  
recovers after prayer.

To deal with that in turn a scientist has to find fault with the  
method of the faith healer -- e.g., the famous April 1998 JAMA paper  
\`A Close Look At Therapeutic Touch'; or else with his results -- e.g.,  
statistical analyses showing that the confirmed rate at which  
dangerous diseases have been cured after a pilgrimage to the Lourdes  
shrine in France is no better than the rate of spontaneous remission  
even among those who did not visit. And of course, even this does not  
settle the issue, and the debate drags on.

I'll wait till you get caught up on your understanding of science,  
before picking up on this; there is just no point in my trying to  
explain because you do not have the background to understand.

Ditto. No scientist today makes such a simplistic claim, which is  
almost worse than "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny."
