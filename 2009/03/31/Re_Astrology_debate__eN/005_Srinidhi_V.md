Dear Amba Kulkarniji,

  

I am a graduate in modern medical sciences. I will try to clarify the scientific nature of medical sciences, but I prefer not to go into the details of astrology, which in my understanding as any other vedic field, does not need \`scientific evidence' to prove its validity. Its dimension is completely different when viewed from the angle of apaurusheyatva.

  

There is a subtle difference between popular medical practice and ethical medical practice based on medical sciences. We need to understand how the practice of medicine evolved to know this distinction clearly. The present understanding of medical sciences is based on evidences by randomized control studies which was not the case in previous times. \`Some' discoveries showed unbelievable results in \`some' cases which prompted people to use them in other untested situations also by common sense. The other point was when people tried to understand physiology and the possible mechanism for a specific disease they made a wild guess that some chemical known to reverse this mechanism should be able to treat the disease. This is what is called medical ideology in the article you mentioned.

  

But as the studies progressed some of thepracticeswere proved right and some were proved wrong. What we now study in medical text books does have evidences to prove the efficacy of proposed treatment. In fact, now most of the public health professionals and rational medical practitioners are urging their colleugues to practice what is now being popularly termed as \`EBM' (evidence based medicine). To know more such studies you can visit [www.cochrane.org](http://www.cochrane.org). (To verify my claim that medical sciences is not based on practices that wont work, you can check a popular text book in medicine - Davidson's Medicine - where he quotes cochrane studies quite often)

  

However, I am not saying that all of the medical practice is scientific. Unfortunately due to the money making mentality, some (rather most) doctors are prescibing drugs not having evidence as the article says. In fact, I have faced this problem first hand, when I entered hospital as a house surgeon. What we had studied in books was much different from what was being practiced. To give you some examples,

  

1\. There is a protocol to say which lab tests to be done for a specific type of patient before specific surgery. But in the name of defensive medicine in government hospitals and in the name of high quality care in corporate hospitals. a lot of unnecessary tests will be done.

2\. The IV fluids and injections are given mostly to satisfy the patients that some colored liquid is given to them, so they are doing some thing great (the color imparted is due to multivitamins which do not have any positive effect)

3\. The tablets having more than one drug as their somposition should ideally not be used.

4\. The vomitting and diarrhoea do not need antibiotics in most of the cases. Anti diarrhoeal drugs may be harmful sometimes.

  

There are lot more, but none of this is a problem of medical sciences. Some reputed medical colleges and ethical practitioners do practice what is told in text scientific literature and this practice has sound scientific evidences that it works and is not just a belief.

  

So the yardstick is evidence for medicine. It does work.

  

Regards,

Srinidhi
