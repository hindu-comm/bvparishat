There were many gaps in our knowledge once --- how heredity works for  
\> example --- which we have now filled.  
  
"Irrelevant".  
  

Why? That is the difference between religion and science. Religion  
assumes that all questions have been answered and no further research  
needs to be done; just write bhashyas and tikas on old texts.  
Science genuinely believes in 'charaivati, charaivati'.  

  
\> Also I do not understand your examples --- science can give you the  
\> forces involved in the formation of a hurricane and fall of a leaf,  
  
so  
\> I presume you are saying something else?  
  
"No, but apparently you are not sufficiently well read to understand  
what I said -- there is no proper predictive model of either.  
Exactly  
what kind of scientist are you anyway? I'll try to frame the issue  
in  
terms of something you may know."  
  

1\) I understand you now. However science as I said can at last tell  
us  
what is going on. Goddidit is no xplanation.  
  
2) Not a scientist at all. Just an ordinary person who sees no reason  
to beleive in immaterial things and who appreciates the knowledge  
science has given us to understand the world.  

  
\> So you dislike it science is not an instant fix for every question?  
  
"No, but you have now been obliged to accept that it is not, unlike  
your earlier position."  
  

Human limitations prevent us from knowing everything--- what we need  
is  
plenty of time and a better brain. Unfortunately don't think either  
is  
possible.  

  
\> And just because science can and do have wrong models does not make  
\> astrology true.  
  
"Accepted, but it becomes necessary for science to come off its high  
horse and stop making highfalutin pretenses."  
  

That is science should pretend that beleifs with no basis whatsoever  
is  
as valid as all the advances science made just because the beleifs  
made  
some people feel better.  

  
\> Oh yes, science by itself is not a guarantee of morality or  
  
happiness.  
\> But consider this --- is all the pujas and tantriks any help when  
  
your  
\> child dies of a sickness or are anti-biotics more of a help?  
  
"If your child actually dies, even antibiotics are not a help. Or  
perhaps you meant something else?"  
  

What I meant is that with advance in medicine the child now has a  
chance to survive which puja does not give.  

  
"Your comment is also a dodge, because the question you raised was  
whether there exist issues beyond science, and I have clearly shown  
that there are, though you have not acknowledged this."  
  

Nothing that belongs to this objective universe is beyond science.  
The morality you are speaking of belongs only in our heads.  
And even that morality is driven by the biologiocal drives of  
survival  
and expansion of individual and society.
