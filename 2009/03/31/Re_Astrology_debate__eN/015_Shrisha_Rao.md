I am not aware that any religion, now or through the ages, had that as  
its objective. But then, even atheism, which is considered by many to  
be a religion, also fits the bill and does not advance knowledge, so  
there is nothing to choose there.

Nonsense -- it only serves to distinguish between the Abrahamic faiths  
and the native traditions of India.

As we are not in such a state, the point is irrelevant.

No. My academic credentials are already available and well known to  
those who know where to look.

The question is relevant insofar as you consider your life to be lived  
inside a fairytale (with apologies to Hans Christian Andersen) and has  
no place in a serious debate.

Dawkins is a professed atheist, and there is no claim on my part that  
he is otherwise (indeed, I pointed his works out as atheistic).  
However, his standard of exposition is something you can learn from,  
rather than coming up as you do with pablum that has only the most  
loose correlation with facts, that's the point.

Another simplistic question -- it really is necessary to think deeper  
and avoid spurious generalizations.
