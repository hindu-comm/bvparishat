Dear Dr. Shrinivasa Varakhedi, Namaste!

What does it mean, "The papers submitted by senior and well known scholars  
will be published as special case." ? Please explain-what is meant by "special case"? Are you referring to retired professors as opposed to those working in universities at present ?It would be a great help if topics of interest to the Journal are mentioned. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
