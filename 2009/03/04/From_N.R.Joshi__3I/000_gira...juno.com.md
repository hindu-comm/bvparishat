All respected participants of this scholarly list, Namaste!

I am interested in your discussions. But I get frustrated when I see all strange characters on my computer. There is a font problem. In USA the simple Harword-Kyoto system is used to write correct spelling of Sanskrit words using both Capital and small letters of English. It is easy to use. Those who do not know this method of transcription, they eventualy figure out in two to three postings.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
