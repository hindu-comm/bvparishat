I would like to clarify a few points ---  
  
1) Not all Carvakas disregarded anumana. According to Kamalasila there  
was one group who admitted anumana as long as it is by the common way  
--- that is, it is about this worldly things only. I firmly support  
this theory.  
  
2) A radar certainly allows you to infer where the enemy aircraft is.  
But this knowledge is backed up by perception --- don't take any  
countersteps and the aircraft will soon be over your head!  
  
P.S I think Nyaya is best at having a stab at artificial  
intelligence.
