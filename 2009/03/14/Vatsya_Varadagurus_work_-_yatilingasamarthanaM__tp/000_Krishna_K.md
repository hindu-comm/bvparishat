Namaste,

I am looking for information regarding Sri Varadaguru's  
'yati-linga-samarthanaM'. Has this been published (along with a  
commentary)? Is it available? Is an online copy available? How long is  
the work? Also, is this the first work, or the first work in  
Vishishtadvaitic sampradaaya, that establishes the authenticity of  
tridaNDi sannyAsa?

dhanyavAdAH,  
Krishna
