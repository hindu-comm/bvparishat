It is possible to make a computer dual bootable. (In fact one can have  
more than 2 OS as well.)  
Linux and Windows being two different partitions, while in Windows,  
one can not access Linux.  
In other words, even if your Windows part is affected by VIRUS, the  
Linux partition will still be virus free.

\> It is very encouraging to learn that LINUX is better than XP. It is also observed that it is free from VIRUS which is the main and uninterrupted interruption in the Windows OS. It is also told that XP can be loaded along with LINUX. I would like to know for sure, whether the PCs having XP alongside LINUX are also virus free. please throw some light on this.
