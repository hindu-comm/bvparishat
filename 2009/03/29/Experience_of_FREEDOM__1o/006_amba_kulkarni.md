Congratulations Varkhedi ji.  
I know you will have to struggle a little in the beginning. But with  
various flavours of Linux, and user friendly GUIs, working on Linux is  
definitely not as hard as you started some 10 years back.  
  
Just for your information, in our lab we have around 35 machines, all  
with linux, and just one-two with dual booting (since sometimes we  
receive some Windows based programs for which we need Windows.) While  
placing the order as well, I save a lot since I do not have to buy the  
OS. All my students are now experienced enough to install Linux on  
their own.  
  
I would like to share my experience here.  
Few months back I had been to CIIL Mysore. There I introduced the  
fresh linguistics graduate students and programmers to Linux.  
After a few months I was told that now all of their young linguists  
are using Linux. Surprisingly the major resistance was from the  
programmers!
