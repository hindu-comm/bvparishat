Thanks. I understand your problem. But somebody will be available thru  
helpgroups for linux on net. pl get in touch with netgruops.  

  
\> I would like to have it if it were available. But can one instal LINUX within XP? Most of us would have all the partitions in thehard disk XP-installed and hence "filled up". Could the LINUX system beinstalledjust asWindows-compatible and yet independent like say iLEAPand DOS that work subordinate to XP but with their own characteristics. If this facilityis available it would be worth trying but, at least initially, I do not want to forego XP. Also please inform if you could flawlessly save all the XP-programmes/files (iLEAP, DOS, Qbasic, TC etc)in LINUX. That will be great.  
  

Yes. you can keep XP in your machine as long as you want. (I kept  
windows in C). You can use all files even thru linux. Within Linux i  
have loaded one more XP (shorter version) using virtualbox. I hv  
installed ileap in that XP.  
  
I hv open office an alternative for MS-Office. Apart from that I hv  
installed MS-office on linux within WINE. Wine is a software which  
allows you to install all windows applications.(We must test the  
feasibility)  
  
I think if you have interest, you can even try UBUNTU within XP via  
virtual box.  
  
warm regards,  
shrivara
