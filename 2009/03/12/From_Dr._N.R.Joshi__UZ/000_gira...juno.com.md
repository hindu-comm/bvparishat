I am enjoying discussion between Dr. Rani S. Murthy and Nastikshiromani. Somebody is doing thesis on Metallurgy in Puranas. This is good. I would like to add. In 1826, Michael Faraday (Electromagnetic Induction fame) was on the secret mission to find the composition of the special steel (Bulad, Pulad) of Indian swords. He could not find it. Russian scientist found the secret in 1850. I have published one paper (Tough Steel of Ancient India) on it. If anybody interested I can mail it or if possible send PDF file. Thanks.N.R.Joshi.
