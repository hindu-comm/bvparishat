Dear Scholars,

  

Who is the author of vrutti on bhagavadgita which accarya shankara quotes in 2.11 ? It is also abundantly quoted in Madhusudana Saraswati's commentary as vrutti, and in avigItA as \`iti vAmanaH'. If it is vAmana, is he the the same vaamana of kaashika fame? I also request to share any info on commentaries on Bhagavdgita before Shankara's time.  

  

Thanks,

Srinidhi
