Once again, I ask -- is this your position that the rishis knew of  
such bacterial communications and social exchanges, --- for that  
matter viruses swap genes too --- but somehow forgot to make it clear  
depending only on human analogies?  
  
That is what I am strongly against --- the insistence that all secrets  
of science are to be found in the sruti and Westerners have either  
stolen our secrets or treading well covered ground.
