Prof. Deepak Bhattacharya,  
I want to remind you of some information pertaining to your statement given below.  
Prof. B.V. Subbarayappa is working on a project 'life sciences and medicine in India up to 17th century under PHISPC. Prof. O.P. Jaggi is volunteering a fifteen volume project 'history of science technology and medicine in India', under PHISPC. His 'medicine in modern India' is
published already. Other scholars can correct me.  
Prasad
