Mr. Bhattacharya,  
  
the words "That is what I am strongly against --- the insistence that  

all secrets  
\> of science are to be found in the sruti and Westerners have either  
\> stolen our secrets or treading well covered ground."  
  

are not addressed to you. They are in reply to Shrisha Rao.  
  
Even then I may be over reacting a bit, but it is so irritating to be  
faced with the above attitude.

The living Atharvavedins,however, as they told me, admit the the existence of unseen small living beings that cause disease. This isnot the position of the Ayurveda. I do not make any comment here on the level of knowledge of the living Atharvavedic medicine men whoare a fast dwindling community. I recorded some of their statements. they have not been puiblishged yet. I do not know of anyone interested in this.
