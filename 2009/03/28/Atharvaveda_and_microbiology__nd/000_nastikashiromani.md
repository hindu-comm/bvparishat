Dear members, here is my critique on the paper written by Professor  
Wadekar on microbiology in Vedas:  
  
Dear Professor Wadekar,  
I read your paper. As this is a closed forum I shall be brutally frank  
--- this paper would not be considered as acceptable evidence in a  
scientific conference.  
  
1) You have said that, “bacteria, virus, parasites as they are now-a-  
days described are generally called krimi or krumi”  
  
Bacteria, virus, parasites are different organisms even though they  
fall into the category of micro-organisms.  
What you are asserting is that the rishis knew of the existence of all  
these creatures. But there is no such distinction made and all we are  
left with are krimis. Now rishis certainly could see worms in excreta  
and in open wounds and can easily infer that there can be invisible  
ones as well since they are found in excreta. They were being  
scientific in their primitive way, but that does not mean that they  
knew about bacteria and viruses in the modern sense of the term. It  
is akin to assuming that because Shakespeare spoke of egg-bearing  
creatures he knew about Platypus.  
Nothing in the verses show that the rishis knew what bacteria and  
viruses were.  
  
2) Krimis reside everywhere and are of various shapes--- agreed. But  
all it proves that the rishis were good at thinking systematically ---  
it is not evidence that they possessed secret knowledge.  
Krimis rot the flesh and blood --- did not our ancestors have eyes to  
see bodies decomposing and wounds infested with maggots and leeches  
drinking blood?  
  
3) FAR MORE SERIOUS is the description of the krimis. They have been  
described as having horns, knots of poison, legs etc. However it is  
impossible for bacteria and viruses to have any limbs. Bacterias are  
unicellular while viruses are hardly organisms at all being only  
molecular strands. They have no bodies as described. They have neither  
heads nor ribs nor faces to be destroyed. Such descriptions to us  
unbelievers is a dead giveaway that the rishis have never knew  
anything about the structure of bacteria and viruses. However such  
assumptions are only to be expected from people who lack modern  
instruments to detect them.  
Krimis are said to have kings and chiefs and  
dependants which is ridiculous since they do not even have society as  
such --- but again it is a natural assumption for a human living in a  
hierarchal society to make just as Aristotle mistook the Queen bee for  
a king.  
  
4) Verse 4.37 on apsaras and gandharvas simply seems to be exactly as  
it purports to be --- pleas and prayers to avert the mischief created  
by those demigods. Where did you get microorganisms from there? I had  
another Sanskrit professor check the verses out and his conclusion is  
the same.  
  
5) 8.37 on pregnant women speak of evil spirits --- it needs a  
considerable stretch of imagination to turn them to viruses. Here even  
the term krimis are not mentioned.  
  
Finally here is the question:  
where are the knowledge we have gathered in modern age about the  
virus? Viruses wander in and out of hosts cells at will and often  
control the behaviour of the hosts to propagate themselves. Do Vedas  
tell us about them?  
Do they speak about how we have friendly bacteria living within our  
guts --- in fact if the spells were successful and these bacteria in  
our stomach died too we would be in deep trouble when it comes to  
digestion.  
Does it speak about the retrovirus which enables the embryo to  
flourish in the mother’s womb?  
  
Because of these scientific anamolies and absence of knowledge this  
cannot be accepted evidence of modern microbiology, unless the term  
is applied very loosely without scientific rigour.
