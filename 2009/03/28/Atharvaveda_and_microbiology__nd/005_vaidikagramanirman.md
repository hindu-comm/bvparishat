namasthe,  
  
bhaTTAcArya ji raises an important point that I cannot more on and  
also come out more directly my own view  
  
He wrote:- I think I have drawn notice to he point aimed at. We cannot  

avoid the actual growth through time from Atharvaveda to Ayurveda --  
growths that improved things and growths that discarded valuable  
instruments and ideas of the Atharvaveda.  
  

Going by viewpoint of conviction and not mere belief - the time scale  
I have been given to understand is of the order that it would clash  
with modern day - propagated time scales of origins of Man and  
geology. I am content in being scientifically bent and yet staunch  
viewer of the veda by remembering the movie "Gods must be crazy" and  
the coca cola bottle landing on the head of pygmy. I do not debunk the  
yuga concept of veda being perpetrated on after pralaya. It is hard  
for the scientifically bent (meaning aware of statistical probability  
analysis methods too) that on a billion year old planet - th veda is  
declared only 3000 years old or condescendingly not more than 5000  
years. In comparitively benign times If sayana had to compile meanings  
of the ancient veda and was wrong in interpretation a little how much  
more wrong would we be in the present times.  
  
"Hence" - has been my argument for preservation and passing on in  
exact form as we found it for the future.  
  
regards
