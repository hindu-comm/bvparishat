namaste,  

  
"is the insistence that ancient seers possessed all kinds of knowledge  
without any evidence. "  
  

is a very fundamental point -  
  
1. On one side is the "apaurusheya" viewpoint of the veda vAkya and  
hence the "knows everything viewpoint". Such viewpoints are not  
matters of personal beliefs rather they are viewpoints that require  
understanding.  
  
I have learnt a lot of crap about Mendel, Aristotle, Newton,  
Scientific Advisors to PMs and so on and lot from the crap too. I  
never knew the existence of caraka or bhaskara or Aryabhatta and the  
galaxy of great thinkers of India till about 6 years back. It is with  
shock that I see the vedic seer knew of the situation I would be in  
and the verse "sahanA vavatu..." that tells me in the matter of vid it  
is inevitable that I would be in conflict with gurus and  
everything ... except the veda. My reporting "truthfully" that this is  
remedy that works supreme for my psychosomatic "dis" "ease" - is not  
enough ? It is for the scientifically bent minds to state what they  
have to state.  
  
As a methodology in learning per se about disease and its treatment -  
cikitsa - I can now educatedly gather is light years distance apart  
from modern medicine.  
  
Modern biology - had taught me it is scientific to kill a live frog  
and an alive cockroach and dissect and study dead parts and know  
anatomy, physiology etc. to understand the live frog or cockroach or  
Man. I have not as yet come across the prescription of cutting up  
cadavers as a method of study in the system of ayurveda . So it is  
most surpising with the "scientific bent" when descriptions of disease  
causation of disease are conguent with any current thought.  
  
I, personally would not visit any ayurvedic doctor that would send me  
for blood tests, other specialists or labs etc. again. This need for  
time wasting expensive method of finding cures for symptoms and not  
treatment of the disease or the whole person and personality is  
tragedy sometimes in modern times.

Only academic discussion is of no use. Or if the diseases are particularly Indian, evolve the method with the help of the specialists of the subject for the welfare of the poor public. Only this way Veda can be helpful and increase the image of Indian sciences. Of course, academic side is for the scholars. Regards, SP Narang

\> Prof. B.V. Subbarayappa is working on a project 'life sciences and medicine in India up to 17th century under PHISPC. Prof. O.P. Jaggi is volunteering a fifteen volume project 'history of science technology and medicine in India', under PHISPC. His 'medicine in modern India' is
published already. Other scholars can correct me.
