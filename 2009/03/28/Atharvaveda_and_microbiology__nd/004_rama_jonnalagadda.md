namasthe,



1\. I have been reading with interest the debate on atharva veda and microbiology.

2\. I do notice the problem of dichotomy - "science" as we think we know it today and the veda vAkya - sanskrit as we think we know it.



Going by report of members - the author of the microbiol - veda linkage paper. (I need to read it sometime) appears definitely to have found many linkages - including kRumi (baraha software notation or kR^imi in itranslator99 notation) (it is not krimi). kRumi has been translated as worms. If indeed that is correct translation it makes no difference to abhyudAya or the more thantruthful interpretation by the RuShi.



My science background tells me that "worms"belong to the class nematodes of which there are hundreds of species ranging from the minutest of minute to sub microscopic.Some are parasitic and others are not. Finding something familiar indeed leads to so what situations and conjetural dead ends to investigation and learning and even bunking or burning thebook.



apsarasa - these have been explained as mythical - non visible creatures around which lore has been built - cloud and water borne beings. It is no big defllation or inflation of ego to hear that as described. I just imagine a 6 year old child taking a peek at a bacterial slide in the microscope and telling his scientist father or mother - they look like rods or worms and they even have horns and teeth. Or vice versa.



gandharvas are indeed fascinating - lore and the veda has spoken about them so very often - They are olfactory processes. The most amazing that bees are guided by them to pick up nectar and so is the human. At a particular age lore is that gandharvas lay trap for young girls. If with conviction is thatveda and my forefathers never lie - I had with investigated with tools and techniques available 40 years back - I would have discovered "pheromones".



The look that I have now is veda is definitely more than my understanding and definitely also more than reading bigotted translations written by politicians. What I see in the RuK veda is a whopping numbe of mantras dedicated to Indra. And for a number of years had a tongue in cheek and was silent when all the ballyhoo was going on about Ruk vedic Gods - and post vedic Gods and stuff.



Today I am looking at it in the meaning it best fits in my mind. I am a creature with pa\~jca j\~jAnendriya and Indra is the Lord of the indriyAs. viShNu to me is he literal sanskrit meaning - That which expands and pervades. brahma is that which moves. and shiva is one that does good.



The cosmic serpents and all pervading snakes in the Universe - How else could one describe magnetic waves?



I am attaching a portion of my incomplete ongoing work on Monier Williams Dictionry in spread sheet of words with Aharva Veda references - You will need [openoffice.org](http://openoffice.org) software from [www.openoffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org) and baraha 7 atleast from [www.baraha.com](http://www.baraha.com).



A search fo "minute" will help to knoew wht sanskrit word was usedin the veda. There are many filter and sort and btanical plant references that can be extracted.. Happy ugAdi.
