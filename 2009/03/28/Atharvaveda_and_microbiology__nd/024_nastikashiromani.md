I said 'once again' because the entire paper by Wadekar is based on  
the premise that rishis knew the secrets of modern biology. Since you  
seem to be defending it I asked it that way.  
  
I am not making up science. I am flatly denying that the rishis knew  
about this kind of bacteria linkage as they were ignorant even of what  
bacteria and virus is.
