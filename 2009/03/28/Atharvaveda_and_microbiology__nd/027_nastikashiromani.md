"Yes, you were, because by your own admission you are not a  
scientist,  
and you also used as a point of fact your own imagination re the non-  
existence of bacterial societies."  
  

Non-existence of bacterial soceity as pictured by rishis. Or are you  
telling me that bacteria actually has kings and attendants in the  
human fashion.  

  
"I couldn't care less what you accept or deny, when you have no  
evidence -- your insistence on putting your own unfounded beliefs at  
the center of your argument is most unscientific, and makes you  
little  
different from fundamentalists of other kinds, such as those who  
just  
know that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet, and  
will flatly deny everything else."  
  

Actually this is very interesting because apparently you are not well  
up on Christian and Islamic 'science'. Using just as much flimsy  
'evidence' here Christian and muslim scholars have also proved that  
their holy books are just as full of hard science. In particular,  
pages have been written proving that the Koran contains all  
information about embryology and biology that modern science knows.  
Obviously it is unscientific of me to think otherwise.  
Since all those papers are more detailed than Wadekar's paper should I  
convert to Islam?
