namasthe Dipak ji,  
  
thank u for your erudite posts. What u write has been education for  
the layman that I truly am. It is sad that after 60 plus years of  
Independence we still have to "Whitney, Blumsfeldish etc." I suppose  
that is fact of life. It had felt sad when I first read anything about  
the veda and that too in English 7 years back written by a catholic  
priest in English. Of course this has been my life's greatest impetus  
to learn. And I have beeb going whole hog.  
  
Regardless of "doctoring", diligent application of forensic linguistic  
techniques will show telltales of "truth" which we actually are all in  
search. The case of Gregor Mendel the father of Genetics is not above  
truth. Statistical analysis of his results showed it was too good to  
be true unless figures were fudged.  
  
In the case of veda - a peculiar absence of words beginning with "jha"  
appears significant - RamayaNa of course has many words that start  
with jha.  
  
regards
