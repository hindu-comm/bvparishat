I don't have any objection to a dissertation on the evolution of  
medicine or its scientific character in India. What I object to, with  
which I noticed you agree, is the insistence that ancient seers  
possessed all kinds of knowledge without any evidence.

\> Dear Shri Lokayatika,  
\>    
\> I agree with your above observation. The point is taken. However, the debate does not throw any light on the positive character of Atharvavedic treatment.This is something worth giving a thought to. Kindly allow me to elaborate a little.  
\> Since you professa secular-scientific outlook I hope you are also aware of late Professor Dandekar's caution against 'exaggerated emphasis on the religio-philosophical aspect of ancient Indian culture' uttered in his Foreword to G.U.Thite's thesis on ancient Indian medicine. Thite is a crusader against the belief that whatever ancient India had was the greatest and unsurpassable. None can deny him the rightto fight againstobscurantism. Similarly none can deny anyone the right to sing to the glory of ancient India - real or imaginary. The debate may proceed on as anexample of the healthy freedom of expression that prevails in India and that ispart of our culture.  
\> But sometimes something islost in this tussle when each one, in focusing upon a single point,loses the sight of the accompanying facts. Thite, for example, focuses on the existence of superstition and magical belief in ancient Indian treatment. He is right in holding that superstitions did accompany treatment. But he has not a word to say on if the treatmentworked at least in some cases and on what those cases were.That means anyone eager to know if there is anything of utilitarian valueto be gained from learning Ayurveda will gain nothing from reading Thite.  
\> This is not to echo the views of those who claim that modern Western treatment is nothing compared to what our ancestors had discovered. I despise such views. Still note the fact that you have never mentioned that Atharvavedic treatment is not in any way similar to Ayurvedic treatment. If you take my views its idea of krimi too is quite different from that of Caraka. What I emphasise is that just denial or assertion of superstition or of any belief will itself do little. Barring those hailing from traditional kaviraja-families (G.Sen for example; their number is few), no modern scholar has tried to give us the real picture of the evolution of ancient Indian medicine.  
\> The exact point to be raised for the concept of krimi is: How is it supposed to work in the Atharvaveda and Ayurveda?  
\> You are certainlyaware of the fact that Caraka and Susruta hold vaayu. pitta and kapha to be the cause of every disease. On this groundkrimi cannot be the cause of disease but is itself a disease. In the Astodariiya adhyaaya of the Suutrasthaana(CS, Suu.19.4.9)Caraka enumerates twenty types of krimis. Eighteen among these, Caraka himself states,are born within the body and two outside. That means those eighteen are caused bythe three doshaswithin the body. After enumerating the krimis and their cause Caraka begins the next section (19.5) sarva eva nijaa vikaaraa naanyatra vaata-pitta-kaphebhyo nirvartante. This means the what he has just spoken of are results of the dosas. This is different from the theory of microbes that are themselves held to be the cause of disease.  
\> I do not go into the merit of Caraka's stand. He recommends physical removal, mechanical or thru chemicals, which, theoretically, is not different from modern treatment.  
\> Now,comes the question: while Caraka and Susruta swear by the Atharvaveda, is the Ayurvedic idea also found in the Atharvaveda? What exactly is the standpoint of the Atharvaveda?  
\> Now, the primary difference comes from the fact that the tridoshatattva has not developed in the Atharvaveda. Secondly, the AV speaks of ‘visible’ and ‘invisible’ worms. This is the major division of krimis in the Atharvaveda but this is not a major classification in Caraka though he too knows of some worms that are difficult to see. The most interesting point of the Atharvavedic worms is that they are often stated to be killed and crushed by the rays of the sun. This is said of unseen worms too. Sayana’s explanation that some krimis are called ‘unseen’ because they remain inside the body is obviously wrong. In that case they would not have been killed by the rays of the sun.  
\> I think these point to the fact that the idea of microbes was at an incipient stage in the Atharvaveda but was lost in the mainstream treatment of India.  
\> Many such things have been lost. The Atharvaveda knew catheters and some other old forms of surgery employed on those injured in war. These were lost on account of later mainstream Hinduism’s distaste for having anything to do with flesh or blood particularly for the treatment of disease. Even medicinal treatment by Brahmins has been despised in the Dharmashastras  
\> But Ayurveda was not all fault. It could get rid of some unnecessary paraphernalia of the AV. Ritual accompanied every Atharvavedic treatment. Not so Caraka. This is a clear case of growing mature.  
\> I think I have drawn notice to he point aimed at. We cannot avoid the actual growth through time from Atharvaveda to Ayurveda -- growths that improved things and growths that discarded valuable instruments and ideas of the Atharvaveda. A straight away rejection or aggrandizement will not help.  
\> Enough I think! Please do not take me for a sermoniser. These points will be found in some publications too that I mentioned earlier.  
\> Best for all!D.Bhattacharya
