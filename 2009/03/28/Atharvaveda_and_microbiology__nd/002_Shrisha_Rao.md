\> Dear members, here is my critique on the paper written by Professor  
\> Wadekar on microbiology in Vedas:

I take no position on the aforementioned paper of Wadekar or on the  
issue in general, more so as I am not a microbiologist. However:

\> Krimis are said to have kings and chiefs and  
\> dependants which is ridiculous since they do not even have society  
\> as such --- but again it is a natural assumption for a human living  
\> in a hierarchal society to make just as Aristotle mistook the Queen  
\> bee for a king.

That is not a scientifically accurate critique -- see Ben Jacob et  
al., "Bacterial Linguistic Communication and Social Intelligence,"  
Trends in Microbiology, vol. 12, no. 8, August 2004; <http://star.tau.ac.il/~eshel/papers/Trends-published.pdf>  
. Bacteria actually have a very intricate structure of colonies and  
group decision making, one that is far more algorithmically and  
structurally complex than contemporary computer networks &c.

In general, it is not proper on your part to make declarations ex  
cathedra and give them the status of science -- if you are going to  
make a factual claim, show how it is scientifically proper to make.
