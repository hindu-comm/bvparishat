Namaste.  
  
Thanks for your scholarly posts on the issue. Max Muller the "so called" Sanskritist had misinterpreted many Sanskrit terms to demean vedas.  
Some of them are - *hiranyagarbha* = the golden germ, *pasupati* = lord of creatures, *garbha gruha* = the womb house, *ya aatmadaa* = He who gives birth and so on. I come accross with a thought provoking book titled 'The Terminology of Vedas and European Scholars' written by Pandit Guru Datta Vidyarthi. The link is - <http://www.archive.org/details/terminologyofved00vidy>
