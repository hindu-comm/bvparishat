No, your earlier position was that they do not have a society "at  
all" (yes, your words). Or have you forgotten?

Actually, I wouldn't know, but it bears investigating. Bees do have  
an hierarchical structure with some such, and some algorithmic  
analyses might reveal what the strata and positions in bacterial  
colonies -- for example, it may be shown that a certain type of social  
structure needs to exist in order for a certain activity that may be  
portrayed as a distributed computation.

Rubbish. You just are refusing to own up to the fact that you insist  
that your own opinions, even where not founded on incontrovertible  
facts, be taken as the basis of an argument.
