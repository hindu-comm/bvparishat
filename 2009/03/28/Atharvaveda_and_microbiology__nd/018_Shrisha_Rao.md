Once again? When did you ask me that before? I have never taken such  
a position, so the question does not arise.

Completely irrelevant. What you are strongly (or weakly, for that  
matter) against is of least interest. I am saying that you cannot  
make up your "science" as you go along. If you want to hold that you  
believe in science, understand it properly and well first. Your  
"scientific" critique was, as I showed, at least in part based on your  
imagination only.
