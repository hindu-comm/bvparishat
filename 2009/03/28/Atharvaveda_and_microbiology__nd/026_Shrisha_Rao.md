I said explicitly that I was taking no position on the paper by  
Wadekar; I was only correcting a factual error in your critique of it.

Yes, you were, because by your own admission you are not a scientist,  
and you also used as a point of fact your own imagination re the non-  
existence of bacterial societies.

I couldn't care less what you accept or deny, when you have no  
evidence -- your insistence on putting your own unfounded beliefs at  
the center of your argument is most unscientific, and makes you little  
different from fundamentalists of other kinds, such as those who just  
know that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet, and  
will flatly deny everything else.
