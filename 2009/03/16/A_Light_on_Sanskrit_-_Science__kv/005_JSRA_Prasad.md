This with reference to my earlier mail that includes the phrase '**scholars/scientists who say they did some work, are reluctant to share the observations made**'. Scholars say that I published something and may like to share but they fail  
in doing so. Even in this forum itself one can witness the same. Dr. Pandurangi has forwarded an excellent article from  
Prof. VVS Sharma which was not expected.
