Thank you very much for articulating some of the guidelines one should  
follow.  
Especially the "over enthusiasm" should be avoided at every cost--  
since it not only his/her own growth but also the growth of the  
subject.  
  
Till some 50 years back, the studies in Ancient Indian Sciences was  
very much alive.  
  
Prof. B V Subarayappa has edited many books. To name a few:  
Medicine and life sciences in India,  
Indian perspectives on the physical world,  
Chemistry and chemical techniques in India, etc.  
  
Similarly Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha has published some books on  
'Sanskrit-Science' series.  
Prof. V N Jha, at Pune had conducted some seminars where he brought  
people from various interdisciplinary fields together. The papers, I  
think, are published.  
  
You may also find some of the good articles at:  
<http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches.htm>  
Especially look at the one by Dr. G V Tagare on the Earthquakes.  
  
There are many more such efforts.  
  
What is immediately needed is:  
TO SHOW THE RELEVANCE OF TEHSE IN THE MODERN WORLD.  
Unless we show its relevance, even if we say, yes we had it, it is of  
no use.  
We should know HOW to Market our Knowledge.  
  
To be frank, we ourselves do not know why we follow certain rituals  
etc.  
Unless we start asking ourselves, WHY we do it, we can not convince  
others  
that there is 'science' behind what we do.  
  
Just to give an example how the question 'why' changes the meaning and  
importance all together  
I would request you to watch the Youtube:  
  
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSwhpF9iJSs>  
  
All of us were always punished this way when we made mistakes, every  
year we pray vighnaharta this way to forgive us for our mistakes.  
  
Unfortunately, we never knew how to market our ideas!  
The present day school teachers and parents are totally against such  
punishments.  
But I am sure everybody will welcome Brain Yoga!  
  
what is needed in today's world is: prove its worth "scientifically"  
-- whatever that may mean!  
  
I would also like to draw your attention to the book by Frits Stall on  
'Discovering Vedas', published by Pengin -- especially the section on  
Vedic Science.  
  
I quote him:  
  
"Science is universal, but the concept of science varies in different  
cultures. English 'science' is different from French 'science', from  
Japanese ... "  
and finally ends the paragraph thus...  
"Thus defined, Science is similar to 'veda'. However it recognises  
more clearly and explicitly the duality of facts and logic."  
  
  
With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
