All! Many of the so-called astrologers including those working as faculty in Indian Universities have neither knowledge of the principles nor a relation to the scientific subjects like astrophysics. They do not care to make it acceptable to all. They have entered the universities through some political pressure or otherwise. Their knowledge of astrology is very poor. Some of them do not have any certificate or diploma from an institution which imparts scientific knowledge to the subject. In most of the cases, it is accepted or by political parties without having any knowledge of the subject. As a sincere and serious students of the subject, we must condemn such teachers who exploit the students and society and defame the subject. It is a Sastra and should be taught in that spirit. Looking at the face of the person and making predictions on the basis of the whimsical norms acceptable to the person concerned or predict without any Sastraic basis is absolutely wrong. Such type of astrology or any Sastra and its teachers must be condemned. It should be developed as a sastra and not a money-minting machine. SP Narang
