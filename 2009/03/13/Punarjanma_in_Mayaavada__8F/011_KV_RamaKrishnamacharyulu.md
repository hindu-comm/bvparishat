Dear all,  
There are many persons who are really doing research in Astrology provimg it's worth.Prof. Ramachandra pandey is an expert who was Prof. in BHU and Chairman, Jyotish peeth of JRRSU, Jaipur.Last year a seminar on clinical astrology was conducted where a good number of research papers are presented with case studies. The proceedings are also published.  
The persons with a littile knowledge of astrology and who are commertial are the cause for this defame of the sastra.  

This is the fate of all sastras as the commitment for in depth study is rarely seen. But there are persons who can protect the sastras from this type of criticism.
