Dear VVS Sharma,  
I read your rebuttal and all it said was that ---  
astrology is is a matter of religious belief and cannot be judged by  
scientific principles.  
That completely ends that and ensures that no scientist or materialist  
will every take astrology seriously.

\> \> India.  
\>  
\> \> My intention of writing this as follows. Jyotisha is one of the six  
\> \> vedangas. It is intimately connected with karma siddhanta and belief in  
\> \> rebirth or cycle of births and deaths.  
\>  
\> \> The Wikipedia elegantly characterizes jyotisha thus JyotiSHA(Sanskrit  
\> \> jyotisha --jyoti- "light, heavenly body": also spelled Jyotish and  
\> \> Jyotisha in English) is the Hindu system of astrology (also known as  
\> \> Indian astrology, Hindu astrology, and of late, Vedic astrology).  
\> \> Traditionally, it has three branches:\[1\]  
\>  
\> \> Siddhanta: , which is traditional Indian astronomy.  
\> \> Samhita: also known as Medini Jyotisha (mundane astrology), predicting  
\> \> important events based on analysis of astrological dynamics in a country's  
\> \> horoscope or general transit events such as war, earthquakes, political  
\> \> events, financial positions, electional astrology; house and construction  

\> \> related matters (VÃ¢stu ShÃ¢stra), animals, portents, omens etc.  

\> \> Hora: Predictive astrology based on analysis of natal horoscopes and the  
\> \> moment a query is made.  
\> \> The latter two are part of predictive astrology (Phalita). Conceptually,  
\> \> therefore, Indian astrology has two branches, Ganita (Siddhanta) and  
\> \> Phalita (Samhita plus Hora).  
\> \> There is no astrology-astronomy distinction in Jyotisha. At this time if  
\> \> some does believe in astrology or fixes a good muhurtam for an event  
\> \> it should be treated at least as Hindu religious belief and respected as  
\> \> such. Our scientists want to debunk everything Indian as blind belief  
\> \> while they dare not touch the beliefs of otherrelgions.  
\>  
\> \> My request to group meembers is the following. I am anyway writing a  
\> \> comment to the journal that the paper is a prejudiced, unscientific and  
\> \> misleading work couched in pseudo-scietific terms. If some one has a view  
\> \> please share with me
