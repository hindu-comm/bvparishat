Dear all,

I endorse the veiw as expressed by Prof. Sharma and prof. KVRK acharya.

but we have to make some good case studies to prove it. unless our protests will be not more than foul cries. We have all the established jyotish departments in all sanskrit universities and other universities also. they should take this thing seriosly. For that purpose even this list needs to include more members from jyotish fiild. I request you all to go for all out effort to make more scholarly members so these people can be aware and respond to this kind of malicious efforts.

Veeranarayana
