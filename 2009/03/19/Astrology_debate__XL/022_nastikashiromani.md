Dr. Murty,  
  
Do you think I am an adminstrator with financial clout enough to  
arrange a seminar, and on astrology at that?  
Sorry.  
  
However that is why I keep on asking you to have that experiment I  
mentioned. One thousand birth charts, one thousand lives to track for  
20 years.  
If even 50% is correct then it is a science.  
  
Again the books do not prove anything unless the theories actually  
work.

\> You pl. read my previous mail once again. I did not affirm that the prediction of the astrolger whom I am going to introduce confines himself only to past happenings. The books which I listed in my earlier mail are not just to conivnce the materialists with Sabda Pramana. But those texts have some hidden directions laying down an excellent scientific process to read past, future and present of any person.
There are many more stunning aspects given in those texts for supporting the practical nature of Astrology. So My intention in giving those books is to show the people the recorded scientific method of predicting the events to come or events that happened or events happening.  
\> Since there is demand from this forum I asked you to hold a seminar.
Otherwise that person whom I promised to bring infront of this forum is always busy in serving the society in many ways meeting the needs of the needy.  
\> Thanks for your exercise of considering my mail.  
\> Best Wishes,
