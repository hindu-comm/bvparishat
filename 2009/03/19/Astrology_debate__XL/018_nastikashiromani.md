Dr. Murty,  
  
  
the books will only convince those who are already beleivers. We  
nastikas do not accept sabda as automatic proofs unless backed by  
praksya or anumana whose predictions come true.  
  
The astrologer can only prove his prowess not by referring to his past  
deeds to which believers attest but by participating in an experiment  
that focuses on an indefinite future. The future is unknown and is it  
not what astrology claims to predict?  
  
This is why I suggest the university with help of HRD Ministry conduct  
this experiment. It will settle the matter for once and all.

\> I request Our learned memeber Nastika Siromani to hold a national seminar or a workshop on this. There I shall bring an Astrolger with 40 years experience who can present concrete proofs in hundreds.That scholar can present us two types of proofs. One will be on the Muhurta Prakarana andthe other one on the Predictive Astrology. The source books for these two types ofevidences shall be supported from the texts such as Sripati Paddhati, Vasishtha Samhita, Brhajjaatakam,Jyotirvidaabharanam, Jaatakaparijaataetc.,
