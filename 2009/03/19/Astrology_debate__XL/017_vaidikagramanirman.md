namasthe,  
  
contd...  
  
Knowledge that human gathers - "truth - is stranger than fiction".  
very often it is the rarest of rare exceptions of observations that  
opens out great relms in fresh truths. AND also does not put a dead  
end to inquiry and fresh look at the realities of the cosmos and we as  
part of the whole.  
  
Astrology in my opinion is in essence - a methodology in "forecasting"  
- And what is what is wrong with that and how different is it from the  
weather forecasting the weather or the climatologist or the "global  
warming" prophets.  
  
Any kind of forecasting - that impels for hoping for the best and  
being prepared for the worst is great for me.
