Dear Dr. Sharma,  
I read your comments on Balaram. I feel compelled to point out that  
in the quote you mentioned the speaker does not say about science  
failing in anything. Rather the speaker implies that the project of  
science now is to reconcile the observed world with our self  
conception.  
After all the theory of evolution gives excellent answers to many  
questions about ourselves which does not have to resort to jivatma or  
Brahman.
