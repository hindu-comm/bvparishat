Dr. Murty,  
  
The fact that in Hinduism astrology and astronomy are mingled together  
do not mean anything.  
  
you must understand that we materialists demand proof that stars and  
planets influence our minds and fortunes. We simply say that yes our  
ancestors were scientific but also superstitious.  
  
In the West I remember reading an experiment was done. The horoscopes  
of many children (more than hundred) was cast at the moment of birth.  
The children were then watched for 20 years and their life-history  
compared to what the horoscopes predicted. The result was a big zero  
for astrology.  
  
I suggest you persuade an university to make such an experiment with  
astrologers who according to you are learned in Indian shastras and a  
1000 newborns.
