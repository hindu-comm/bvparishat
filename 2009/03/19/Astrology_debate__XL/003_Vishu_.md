Dear Dr. Sharmaji,  
  
Thanks for your attachment. I have some comments, I hope these are useful to you for framing your response:  
  
(1) The paper by Narlikar is neither pathbreaking nor or they making any bold conclusions in any sense. They are providing an empirical evidence against one specific aspect of astrology. It may seem odd to conclude that whole of astrology is wrong based on test of one aspect by 27 astrologers. That would be a serious or bold conclusion if this is the first such study on astrology. This is not a first test of astrology.
For most scientists its an issue beyond doubt that astrology is not science or that astrological effects don't occur in nature. So even if you show all the work Narlikar has done is wrong including his methods, statistics, etc, no scientist will start to believe that astrology is correct. Moreover, Narlikar is a very careful and very well respected scientist and its very unlikely that he would have dome methodological mistakes in the study (yes, mistakes can happen by anyone and I am only saying its very unlikely).  
  
When I say astrology is not considered science long before, I mean at least of the order of at least 100 years, if not more. Historically speaking astrology and astronomy in the western world began to deviate as far back during the time of Francis Bacon (1600 AD) who was instrumental in promoting the inductive method in science that later led to what we now call as scientific revolution. You may argue that Indian astrology is different from Western astrology, but most scientists would not take that statement very seriously.  
  
(2) Far from being called a science, Astrology is considered a classic example of pseudoscience. Carl Popper, a famous philosopher of science developed the idea of falsifiability keeping in view that astrology (and Marxism) as good examples of psuedoscience. Some article for your reference:

(3) See this short clip from famour Astrophysicist Carl Sagan on Astrology:  
  
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iunr4B4wfDA>  
  
You may contest some specific details of what he says, especially because he is addressing western astrology. But there are some important issues that can be applicable to Indian case as well. Just to summarize  
(a) Lack of any empirical evidence to claim correlation between planetary positions and people's lives  
(b) More importantly, there is no plausible mechanism for such a correlation. In fact, if it does exist, it would be a major blow to existing theories of Physics and we would have missed something very important in our understanding. So any showing astrology is true will have to happen with a major revision or reunderstanding of existing physics consistent with this new result that astrology is correct.  
(c) Very vague predictions of astrology.  
  
(4) I recommend a reading of various issues of Current Science in the year 2001 where discussion on the astrology happened (since BJP govt then was trying to introduce Vedic Astrology as science). Just so that same old points are not repeated.

(5) I also recommend a reading of Physicist Feynman's books "On the meaning of it all" where he discusses what is science and talks about astrology and why its not a science. Also, in the article [http://wwwcdf.pd.infn.it/\~loreti/science.html](http://wwwcdf.pd.infn.it/%7Eloreti/science.html),
he examines why people want to believe in things such as astrology or UFOs when there is no empirical evidence for them.  
  
Please read another of his book "Pleasure of Finding Things Out" under the chapter "Role of Scientific Culture in Modern Society" where he says for astrologers science is totally irrelevant and they keep on saying same things irrespective of what empirical evidnece tells us.  
  
(6) This is a general question on why you would think author's motivation is malicious. I would like to know what exactly is the reason for that? There is a mention of things like secular, atheistic, etc -- but none of them constitude a reason to be malicious. Should we think even Feynman or Carl Sagan was malicious in his intentions? Even if you think thats the case, I think any rebuttal should entirely focus on the scientific and methodological aspects of the paper, not the perceived intentions of the authors. Agreement and disagreements are common in science over a specific theory, but attributing malicious intentions needs extraordinary evidence and is mostly not done in scientif papers/comments.  
  
(7) There is no need to invoke Bayesian statistics in all experimental studies. For simple enough cases, the fact that we are rejecting or accepting a null hypothesis itself constitutes an update in the belief of correctness of a theory, analogous to posterior probability calculations. So I do not think your argument on Bayesian statistics is valid.  
  
(8) I am curious to know how did the honorable Supreme Court of India decide astrology to be a science. To check if something is science, one has to understand what kinds of studies constitute science and what not. Then check if the methods of a particular field can be called science. The fact that science has been so successful in helping us understand the nature has meant that almost everyone wants to call their study as scientific (as an example, people belonging to almost any religion usually claim that their holy scripture is scientific). This is something to keep in mind and make sure we don't fall in trap.  
  
I hope these comments are interesting to you. Kindly excuse any mistakes.  
regards,  
Vishwesha
