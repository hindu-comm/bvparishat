Dear members of the group

I learnt a lot of useful views on my posts regarding Narlikar's paper.  
Scientists and materialists need arguments in scientific terms. The  
discussion with them should be in terms of the statistical test and  
why their methodology is inadequate for proving that Astrology is not  
a science and now or later astrologers should take the help of  
Statisticians to validate their knowledge clims that there is indeed  
correlation between a correctly prepared birth chart and events in the  
person's life. This work has to be undertaken if the scientfic claims of  
validity are to be accepted by the community at large. Doctors are not  
statisticians but clinical trials with the help of doctors and testing  
of the data by statisticians are a must for a drug to be prescribed  
in the profession.

On my side, I have sent a letter to a Professor, who is extremely well  
versed in Statistical methods to through light on this problem. I  
know him well and he works in the USA. I summarised my views and the  
recent history of the problem. I attach it for general interest.
