No, but apparently you are not sufficiently well read to understand  
what I said -- there is no proper predictive model of either. Exactly  
what kind of scientist are you anyway? I'll try to frame the issue in  
terms of something you may know.  

  
\> So you dislike it science is not an instant fix for every question?  
  

No, but you have now been obliged to accept that it is not, unlike  
your earlier position.

Accepted, but it becomes necessary for science to come off its high  
horse and stop making highfalutin pretenses.

If your child actually dies, even antibiotics are not a help. Or  
perhaps you meant something else?  
  
Your comment is also a dodge, because the question you raised was  
whether there exist issues beyond science, and I have clearly shown  
that there are, though you have not acknowledged this.
