Dear Prof Patnaik - I am thankful to you for adding your insightful  
comments on my note on Astrology. Recently Prof Balaram wrote an  
article in Current Science on the vanishing boundaries between science &  
engineering.  
I am enclosing my response to the same to be published in the same journal  
soon. My inclusion of the same for the Sanskrit group is for the following  
reason. The science so far concentrated on an objective understanding of  
the external physical world. Now it is being realized that science fails  
to reconcile the differences between the world and the self conception of  
the human observer. Acharya Shankara long before said "Viswam  
Darpana Drsyamaana Nagari-tulyam nijargantam and explores the triple of  
jagat, jiva and Iswara.  
The differences in the outlooks of Carl Jung and Sygmund Freud on  
Psychology is precise due to the difference in outlooks of  
nasstika and aastika perspectives.  
  
I attach Balaram's paper and my comments for general interest.
