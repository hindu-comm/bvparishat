There were many gaps in our knowledge once --- how heredity works for  
example --- which we have now filled.  
Also I do not understand your examples --- science can give you the  
forces involved in the formation of a hurricane and fall of a leaf, so  
I presume you are saying something else?  
  
So you dislike it science is not an instant fix for every question?  
That is what makes it different from religion where every answer is  
known and miracles just happen.  
Science progresses slowly and perhaps human science would never be  
able to answer all the big questions before we die out, but that is no  
reason why I should go to unproved deities purely for emotional  
comfort.  
  
String theory, alternate realities, two dimensional universe (the  
latest model), even Big Bang are only things scientists are playing  
with. Until there is actual proof the scientific community as a whole  
won't sell them though some can be as dogmatic as any religious  
fanatic. But that is why they are desperately trying to prove or  
falsify the theories instead of relying on authority.  
"If you wish to cause distress  
In the tidiest scientists' mess  
Just mention their name"  
  
And just because science can and do have wrong models does not make  
astrology true.  
  
Oh yes, science by itself is not a guarantee of morality or happiness.  
But consider this --- is all the pujas and tantriks any help when your  
child dies of a sickness or are anti-biotics more of a help?
