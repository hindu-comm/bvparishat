We can think of some experiments resulting in the quantitative  
analysis.  
The students of Phala jyotisha may carry out these statistical  
experiments with the help of their teachers to verify various rules of  
prediction. These statistical experiments will also give us some  
confidence. One may experiment with various schools of astrology  
ranging from Jaimini, Ramana, KP etc.  
  
There might also be a few computer science students, who can help in  
setting up a 'Rule Based EXPERT SYSTEM' to avoid the subjective  
judgements.

The controvesy was with regards to those who are trying to misuse for their own profit. Even the atom-bombs are being misused. But that does not diminish their importance. When we say that Astrology is scientific: do we mean: it is to the extent or universal? The only message is : Highlight your own business accurately and beware of the fraud neighbours. If for business we spoil our own Sastra, try to defame them and establish your own accuracy. Indian astrology tried to highlight the principles on the basis of time, space, characteristics of the individual, influence of the neibourhood and much more including consciousness and intitution which is a person's acquisition and cannot become universal. Let us bring out the true charactersitics to make the science universal. we should
