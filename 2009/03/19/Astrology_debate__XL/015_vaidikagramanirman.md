namasthe,  
  
an objective viewpoint of jyotishya  
  
1. the evidence :-  
  
the cosmos - nakshatra - sun, moon, planets and the place of earth  
(our planet) in relationship to the cosmos is the subject matter of  
the veda.  
  
Humankind is blessed in my opinion with the pancha j\~jnAnendriya - the  
organs of sense and the brain to process impinging inputs.  
  
However brainy and knowledgable Man may become - evidence is that he  
is NOT the know all of everything. And this goes for the "scientist"  
class. They claim howver that their "method" based on statistical  
probability is the firm basis.  
  
What ecactly is this statistical method?  
  
1. An assumption is made that the "population" meaning a great actual  
sample of all possible observations follows a binomial distribution -  
for example - observations favouring "astrology is bunkum" AND  
observations favouring "astrology is not bunkum".  
  
2. An assumedly representative SAMPLE of data of observations is  
analyzed by Chi2 or other statistical methods. Mean, variance,  
standard deviation of the means (assuming normal distribution or other  
forms of distribution) of the SAMPLE is done.  
  
3. And then the results are compared with THEORETICAL EXpECTATIONS  
from the Universe of observations meaning all possible observations -  
  
4. Now in scientific analysis - NO biology including human  
observations can anyone get 100% this side or 100% that side results.  
So, about 95% probability level is good enough to make a positive  
statement. BUT what exactly is this "scientific statement"  
  
"In my analysis of the n observations - that I beleive is unbiassed  
sampling having so many (n) cases - I have found that results favour  
H0 - "astrology is bunkum"
