There is no controversy over the issue thatlike all the other sciences, astrology is also imperfect. The question is how to bring it to the norms of universality and accuracy. The controvesy was with regards to those who are trying to misuse for their own profit. Even the atom-bombs are being misused. But that does not diminish their importance. When we say that Astrology is scientific: do we mean: it is to the extent or universal? The only message is : Highlight your own business accurately and beware of the fraud neighbours. If for business we spoil our own Sastra, try to defame them and establish your own accuracy. Indian astrology tried to highlight the principles on the basis of time, space, characteristics of the individual, influence of the neibourhood and much more including consciousness and intitution which is a person's acquisition and cannot become universal. Let us bring out the true charactersitics to make the science universal. we should  
frankly admit our limitations. It does not diminish the importance of the Sastra. Naisa sthaaNoraoaraadhaH yadainamandhaH na pashyati. SPNarang
