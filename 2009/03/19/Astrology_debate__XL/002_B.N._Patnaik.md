Dear Scholars,  
  
In this context may I submit the following:  
  
(a)To my understanding, science (using the term in its contemporary sense,  
more specifically, the way it is used in physical sciences)is one way -  
JUST ONE WAY - of cognizing the universe. Not the only way. There is a  
great lot that remains outside the domain of scientific enquiry. It is  
unclear whether some of those will ever come within its domain - for  
instance, issues relating to free will and choice (however limited).  
  
(b)And quite apart from this, in day to day life no one lives by  
scientific knowledge alone. There is perhaps neither any need nor any  
justification to assign superiority to certain kinds of knowledge over  
other kinds.  
  
With best regards,  
Sincerely,  
B.N.Patnaik
