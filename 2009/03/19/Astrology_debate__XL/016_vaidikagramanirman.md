with a probability of 95 -99.9999 %  
  
unfortunately news for the "scientific community" if they do not know  
it already is that it can never be with 100% probability. Furthermore  
what they are really saying is also NOT really about "whether  
astrology is bunkum" or not. A true scientific statement is that - "if  
anyone else cared to perform a similar analysis with similar sample -  
the repeaability of my observations would be 95% .... 99.999. AND MORE  
TRUTHFULLY WITHOUT POLITICS AND FAME ATTACHMENT - (THIS DOES NOT  
PRECLUDE THE RARITY OF NOT CONFORMING WITH THESE METHODS IN FAVOUR OF  
"ASTROLOGY NOT BEING BUNKUM IN 5-% TO 0.00001 but never 0%."  
  
those that do say it is 0 % in favour of "not being bunkum" are  
"unscientific bigots" that have some other agenda and truth and  
reality as exists in nature.  
  
As long as there is this 0.00001 whatever probability "astrology"  
continues to reign "king" - a "vedanga" and nobody has scientific or  
other right to debunk truth.
