Without giving enough importance to inferrence we are not able to do the daily works as well. We are taking food because once the feeling ofhunger was removed with taking food. Now after taking food my hunger will be removed or not is not percieved till the intake is over, So we are inferring that my hunger will be removed today also as it was on the other day. But I think that we are so much habituated with the process that always we don'tdifferentiate this. So are many of our behaviours. I see my fellow-passenger and infer that I've not missed the train. Until we give importance to inferrence it is difficult to live even. Hence, it is told that the Shreshtha Pramana is Prtyaksha but it may be **Arthavaada**. Because practicallysometimes Pratyakshamay also be dismissed by inferrence. In thecrowdI've seen my friend who is out of station now. But by inferrence that "He is in Delhi and should not be seen here. My vision decieved me."
