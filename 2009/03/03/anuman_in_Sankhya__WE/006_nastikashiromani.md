Pratakshya gives us direct knowledge of an object.  
Anumana cannot give us direct knowledge. It itself relies on prataksya  
to validate its conclusion.  
What is inferred can be checked by pratakshya to see if the anumana  
was valid.  
But if anumana leads to conclude something which pratakshya is  
incapable of validating what then?
