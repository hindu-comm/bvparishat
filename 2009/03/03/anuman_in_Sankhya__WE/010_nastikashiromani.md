The material world can be perceived. If this entire complex is called  
prakriti then it is valid on its own. What is being inferred is that  
there is an ultimate Cause of this material world and this is also  
material. Prakriti in this sense is undifferentiated matter which is  
transformed into many material objects we perceive directly.  
  
Purusa however can never be perceived in any manifestation. From  
actions of material human beings the existence of individual souls is  
inferred and then Purusa. It is thus even more removed from perception  
that Prakriti as undifferentiated matter.
