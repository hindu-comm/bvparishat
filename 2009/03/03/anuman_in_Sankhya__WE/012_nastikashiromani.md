It has been perceived in the past that on taking food causes hunger to  
abate. (Even in one argues against causality being real, the sequence  
of actions is invariable). Therefore it is reasonable to infer that in  
the future too the same sequence of events will take place. This is  
inferring by the common way --- located in the material world.  
  
Certainly one's perception can deceive one. But as in the case of your  
friend you can always check to remove any doubt.  
  
On the other hand soul, purusa, afterlife are not available to be ever  
checked by perception.
