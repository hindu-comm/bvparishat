Sorry Sir! Practising Yoga can provide that much of metaphysical power that it is possible to percieve the birth and death and all other that has been to the Purusha (Atma). It is better to refer the Yogasutras of Patanjali - the practical half of the Sankhya. We may refer to **Janmakathantasambodha** (Sadhana Pada). But that is not possible for all and everyone. So we need to infer those. And we are inferring the things existing not something just beyond truth or imaginatory. We may also refer the books of**Beyond Death**by Sw. Abhedananda and**An Autobiography of a Yogi** by Paramahamsa Yogananda.
