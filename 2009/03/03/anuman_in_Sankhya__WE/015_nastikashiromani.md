See Sir, this is the problem: you are relying too much on sabdapramana  
about imperceptible things.  
  
Some authorities say that metaphysical power can be generated --- you  
immediately believe it because you consider them to be aapta.  
Let them demonstrate this power in a laboratory.  
  
Agama is also taken to be valid pramana --- but you and others have  
given no REASON why sruti etc should be considered as valid in  
themselves, only that they are. But why?  
  
By this kind of reasoning, what the sages say and the scriptures say  
are valid, we can also say that Islam and Christianity are the eternal  
TRUTH and hinduism is false because their scriptures and aaptas say  
so!  
  
Finally, certain drugs can heighten the conscicousness and one can  
experience mystical states in which hallucinations of gods and demons  
are seen. Why should their effect be any less valid than the mystical  
states of the sages?
