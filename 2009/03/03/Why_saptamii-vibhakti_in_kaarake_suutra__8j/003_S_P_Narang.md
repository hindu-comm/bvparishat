All! Panini's intention was not to search the categories like pancami or saptami which was done later in Sanskrit grammar and the grammars of Europe and Modern India. His intension was to classify the structure of the words. that is why n was used as anubandha to categorize those vibhaktis which were structurally similar.nas and ni were kept in the same category. remaining is in Sasthii. Modern Indian languages have expressed with another independent suffix like men or ke andara or in which was less possible in Sanskrit due to incorporating of suffix with the stem. the line of thought can be explored in this light also which is unlike traditional thought.
