Dear Prof. Bhattacharya, Last week also I had a meeting with Prof. Chaube over a seminar where I expressed this question for Manuscript Mission. He was furious. I do not know on what basis he is saying it now? He is busy with vaadhuula and Asvalayana. Has it a relation to the Avesta? Baalakhilya may be the portion of the Baskalya which were incorporated elsewhere due to the loss of Bashkal? Help. Regards, spnarang
