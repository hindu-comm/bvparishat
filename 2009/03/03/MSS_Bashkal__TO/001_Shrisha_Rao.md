I don't know where it is, but Bhagavad Datta discusses the shAkhA in  
his \`vaidik vAN^may kA itihAs' (3 vols., originally published in the  
1930s, reprinted in the 1970s). The only person I can think of who  
might have precise information about its location is Vishal Agarwal (<http://vishalagarwal.voiceofdharma.com/>  
).

Shrisha Rao
