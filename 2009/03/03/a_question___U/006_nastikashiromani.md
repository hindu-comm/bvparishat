The tales referred to in Upanishads are merely aaptavakya to teach us  
but it is no guarantee of their validity in real life.  
  
As I said, what scientific facts? Why has no one discovered them  
before --- why did not the sages who compiled them use their knowledge  
to being about changes in the lives of people?
