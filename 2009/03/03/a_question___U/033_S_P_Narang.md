All! There is no doubt that Indians had evolved a good system of medicine particularly with regards to Vanaspati. In modern times, these herbs or material medica is less identified. The result is that we cannot heal the diseases. Filliozat J tried to identify these and so many works published by Govt of India and individuals. It is very necessary that these herbs are re-interpreted and re-identified with modern pharmocopia so that they can be used with profit. The botanical names are given by dictionaries e.g. MWD. Even the authorities in Botany cannot immediately identify the medicines and it is put in the circuit of controversies. This forum can help to identify along with continuity of their use particularly in living system. spnaang
