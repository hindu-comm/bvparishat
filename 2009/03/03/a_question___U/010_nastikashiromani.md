Dear Sadasivmurti rani, please read my previous answer to you more  
carefully.  
  
I distinctly said that sciences like animal husbandry, temple  
architecture (and metallurgy) etc are a matter of common sense and  
experiments. They are science, but they are well within human scope in  
the ancient ages.  
  
I want to have specific concrete examples from cosmology, geology and  
biology that we have discovered today. Having such examples will truly  
prove that there was a golden age of scientific knowledge that we have  
lost.  
  
Quantum mechanics quote is NOT attributed to you. I said vague  
generalisations like Vedas have quantum theories are not acceptable,  
though many try to argue so. As I said, I want concrete examples like  
how proteins control genes -- not stories but the mechanics of how.  
  
Give me such examples from modern science about which I believe that  
puranas know nothing --- and then I will accept your LOGIC.

As long as any arguingperson doesn't want to accept any fact advanced by others having clung to some preconceived notions and as long as such person's Thoughts search to take the support of such LOGIC which serves only to deny but not to accept, even Brhaspati can speak just not more than a little.
