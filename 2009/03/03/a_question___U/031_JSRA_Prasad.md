Dear Sir,  
  
Thanks for the information. One of my student is working for his topic "Microbiology in Sanskrit Literature: With Special Emphasis on Fermentation Process". If you can kindly share your article  
that would be a great help for the student. My address is given at the signature.  
  
Prasad
