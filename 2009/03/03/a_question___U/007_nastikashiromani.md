Thank you, because I would be interested.  
  
However most of the subjects are simple matters of observation and  
common sense and experiments and so valid knowledge about  
architecture, animal medicine etc would easily be available to our  
ancestors.  
  
I would therefore request you to restrict yourself to only cosmology  
and geology and biology because these are subjects about which  
ancients would know very little lacking scientific instruments. And by  
valid knowledge in this case I mean black holes, the composition of  
earth's crust, role of proteins in gene expression --- specific things  
(not vague generalisation about quantum mechanics) which it would have  
been impossible for them to know without some atirendriya help.
