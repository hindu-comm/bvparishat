My point is the ancients did not progress further.  
  
They could imagine the puspaka ratha but not actually create a flying  
machine.  
Kanada gave the atomic theory but no one took it up further to bring  
out the negative and positive charges.  
Medicine stopped with Caraka and Susruta.  
  
As for not needing mundane sciences:  
I take it you think that the destruction of temples by Muslims were  
wanted by Hindus, so they did not bother to advance their weapons  
research?  
If science had truly progressed instead of being stuck in a morass of  
orthodoxy, then Islamic invasion would have never happened and we  
would have kicked the Britishers' butts instead them kicking ours.  
  
In Britain once science came out from the clutches of Church they  
galloped forward until they became a world power; we just said  
everything is in the scriptures and sat down happily not to do any  
research. Result --- we were their colony.  
Sheesh we even had to learn how to print our religious manuscripts and  
preserve them from the aliens!  
  
Yeah language is a science --- but human language.
