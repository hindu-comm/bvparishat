That was only a theoretical answer. I don't want to argue on an empty ground as there is no  
concrete evidence for the statement.

You were asking has anyone working in this regard? When we show someone concerned, what  
left is finding fault in him/her. As Dr. Murty stated vimanasastra is a part of a big book and now,  
that part only is available. Sanskritists have to help such people who work off the job. Helping  
hands are better than praying lips.
