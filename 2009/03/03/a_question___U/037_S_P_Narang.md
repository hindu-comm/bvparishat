Dear Wadekar, Thanks for the paper. Can you clarify what is the approach of analysis of the AV and modern Microbiology? Both try to dissect the insects. Modern science has a lot of apparatus particularly in the Computer Age. Is the type similar or dissimilar? Do they analyze the body of the fungii etc. Or they analyze only the morphological structure or activities. If not very inconvenient, please try to clarify a bit more. Can it be applied to diseases more profitably? Any person working on Microbiology may also explain. Some technical words of the AV may be explained more to come to a particular conclusion to understand it better. A few scholars had been doing it to the structure of the trees. It is the time when we can evolve a unicode system for better understanding. Regards, spnarang
