If our ancestors had actually built puspaka rathas then why are there  
no evidence of their fragments at least?  
If only Indra used it why only one?  
  
So even after having the most detailed instructions this scientist  
could not build another puspaka ratha even after 20 years? Is he ever  
going to finish it?  
  
What does our tolerance have to do with Islamic invasions? Take a look  
at actual history --- muslim invaders were deeply hated and kings who  
defeated them praised. Hell, there was even a crisis in belief that  
how could Hindu gods let these things happen! Where was all this  
family feeling when we insisted that even the touch of a muslim was  
polluting?  
Babar used cannon --- where were Hindu defences against it?  
  
How would I want bloodshed? Easily --- they want my blood for refusing  
to concede Islam's superiority; they carry off my family to slavery;  
they rape captured women: all justified causes for violence.
