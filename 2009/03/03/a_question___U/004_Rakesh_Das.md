These are not mere stories. Even in the Upanishads also we find this. We can refer to the tale of Satyakama Jabala. He got Brahmavidya from Madgu(A kind of bird), an ox etc. And Puranas are also scientific texts. can't deny the fact. If we go through the Puranas those will give insight to various scientific facts - dare to say till unknown to the modern scientists. One among those is the creation of the universe. Mr. Vasudev Poddar has written a book on this matter - **Kalayatra**. Even we have another book **Jambudvipanirnaya** also.
