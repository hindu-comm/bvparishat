None of the texts mention the principles. If it was available, it is lost. in a few conferences, scholars asserting to have the knowledge of the system, failed to demonstrate even a single part of what they the science. The depiction of the system appears to be a semi-imaginative technique which blends the cart-framing system of the 17th century. It is wonderful to depict the contraction and expansion of the plane; concealing it in the darkness of smoke etc. Any person who can explain will be great. what metal; how to generate smoke; what are the Kiilakas, how does it fly; why the manual bells? If technique is available, it can be used in modern technology and that shall be the contribution of India. Any person: claiming knowledge should explain. that is a modest request in the interest of highlighting the knowledge of India. Regards to all. spnarang
