You may correct up to some extent. They not only imagined the pushpaka but they built and  
drove it. Bharadwaja's vimanas sastra (*amsubodhini*) states how to design the metals to prepare  
the machines, the scientist whom I mentioned earlier is working for the past twenty years on the same. One can directly contact him at [d...@ap.nic.in]()  
  
I don't think science could have contributed in preventing invasions. Since, we Indians are very tolerant and open minded. Our feeling towards others is '*vasudhaiva kutumbakam*' (universal family). I don't think Yudhishthira should be blamed for his tolerance towards his cousins. More than science, there are political and democratical factors influenced the numbness of the Indians. I am also patriotic like you. But when you are more religious or open minded, how would you want blood-shed? I am only analysing the situation but not supporting the colonialism or muslim ruling.  
  
As far as I am concerned, we, in our University department, have planned to collect scientific manuscripts to interpret and publsih them.
