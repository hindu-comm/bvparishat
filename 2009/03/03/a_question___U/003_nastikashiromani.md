Puranas are science? In what sense?  
  
Perhaps you can inform me of people who have actually held discussions  
with animals about morality and politics after having practised the  
kalas you mentioned?  
  
To clarify I am saying that birds and beasts have their own language.  
But I am denying that puranas can teach you how to communicate with  
themn as youw ould with another human.
