In this reply I mix up lateral responses also by scholars. According to your definition, whatever definitions are stated so far are attesting the status of science of puranas or scriptutes. All this is depends on how do you define the word 'science'. But other side of the coin the question still remains that is there is any Biology, Geology and cosmology. As rightly said by Prof. Sarma, it may be little difficult to point from exact sciences to descriptive sciences in our puranas. The reasons may be -

1.  If you go back for a span of about two hundred years in our
    civilization, were there any achievements like the aeroplane, TV,
    mobile phone, computer etc.?

2.  There was no globalization, no software companies, no concept of a
    job even with an employer like wipro or microsoft.

3.  There was no apartment culture, only peaceful villages or agraharas
    surrounded by religious monuments.

4.  There was a standard list of diseases but not such as AIDS,
    Alzheimer etc. Why because their lifestyle was healthy and did not
    require any stress management.

5.  There ***is*** no change in the number of planets as did with our
    lovely Pluto (if I am correct)

6.  Without any telescopes of other sophisticated instruments, ancient
    Indians calculated the planetary moments and eclipses even after
    years to come.

Here my point is their daily, physical, medical, societal and family needs were different. In such a situation, it is wrong to argue that why have not they mentioned about mundane sciences. People believe that during 2060s robots may doing the routine works done by humans. If the forthcoming generations blame our coveted scientists 'why Charles Babbage or someone else did not invent robots', what could we say? I don't want to discuss the side effects of the scientific achievements such as atomic weapons, that will be off the track. You have asked Dr. Murty to show examples in cosmology, geology and biology. I firmly believe that Vaiseshika is the foundation of classical physics which has inspired from *nasadiiya sUkta*. A scientist in Hyderabad, sri CSR Prabhu is writing a book titled 'The Physics of Vaiseshika', which is going to published soon. Regarding geology, recently we have witnessed that how disastrous the 'tsunami' is. Had we have a hint of the forthcoming adversity, we could have avoided. I recollect a passage from an article that states the solution(s) in preventing the tsunami mentioned in Brihatsamhita. Forty days before the tsumani effect, the related geograhical area emits smoke/vapors in packets. The same will be reflected in the climate over there. Other scholars may provided more pointed reference to the same. I don't know whether I can relate Ayurveda with biology or not, but I do now. *“Chandogyopanishad recognizes three cosmic elements. Water, Heat, and Earth being essentials required for a good crop. Then if such a cosmology as model, the medicine-man established three factors essential to human life. Air, Heat and Water. These constitute the humours of tirudosha doctrine with vata, pitta and kapha.”* There is a discussion in Charaka, Sushruta and Ashtanga hrdayam of the microbiology. They mentioned twenty types of microbes classified external and internal. The microbes are generated in blood, phlegm and faeces. They said about their size also without using any instruments. **Also, I feel, the modern medicine did not reach the heights of the concept on the** ***tridosha* doctrine prevalent in Ayurveda. **

And I wonder why don't you speak about the Indian advancements in Linguistics as is said by Prof. Patnaik? Is your scope of achievements in science is such narrow? I quote Prof. VVS Sarma 'there are limitations for science also'.
