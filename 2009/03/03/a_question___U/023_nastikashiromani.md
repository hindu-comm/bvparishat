\> Dear Prasad ji!  
\> The treatise about Aeronautics is not "Amsubodhini" as you have stated. I shall tell what it is. The sage Bharadvaja wrote a Grand Text by name Brhad Yantra Sarvasa in 96 Adhikaranas. It is a Volumenous text as its name does stand. Its 40 Adhikarana is known as "VAIMAANIKAADHIKARANA". This 40 Adhikarana i.e. Vaimaanikadhikarana only is now available in our country in two editions. 1.South Indian Edition. 2. North Indian Edition.  
\> Both the Editions are available with me in my personal collection. "Amsubodhini Tantra" is the name of a Text on the study of Electricity referred in this Text.  
\> Any how it is very much interesting to learn that your University is in its efforts to scientific treatises. I congratualte your team.  
\> Best wishes,  
\> Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty

\> I don't think science could have contributed in preventing invasions. Since, we Indians are very tolerant and open minded. Our feeling towards others is 'vasudhaiva kutumbakam' (universal family). I don't think Yudhishthira should be blamed for his tolerance towards his cousins. More than science, there are political and democratical factors influenced the numbness of the Indians. I am also patriotic like you. But when you are more religious or open minded, how would you want blood-shed? I am only analysing the situation but not supporting the colonialism or muslim ruling.
