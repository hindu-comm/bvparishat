Puranas are not for mere story telling. HItopadesa etc., have imitated from puranas.

Puranas are the actual sciences.Birds and animals have their own language which we cann't understand.

Since we cann't understand, simply we shouldn't deny the fact that those are false.

The art of knowing their language is mentioned in the list of sixty four arts (kalaAs).

These kalAs are mentioned somewhere in the Saiva aagamas.One may refer  
to this link for the list of kalAs in English - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal%C4%81>

I heard thatentire markandeya purana is a dialog between sage Jaimini and some birds.
