Dear all,  
The most troubling problem to be worked immediately, in my mind, is  
“the Future of Indian Shastras”. You may organize a seminar on this  
topic. But you will have to do six months basic work how to dissect  
this topic what will be possible issues to be discussed etc. and you  
have to give participants atleast two months time to reflect and come  
with good suggestions. I hope it will help you.
