Dear Pandurangiji,

I would like to know that whetherthis Deepikesarvasva is a commentary on Deepika of Tarkasangraha? I have not seen the place where Shreeram Shastri would have written those lines. Secondly I have a little doubt what he is wanting to say. If you clarify this I might be able to answer your querry.
