Dear all scholars. thanks for your patient replies for earlier queries. I have two more.

In the dipikasarvasva Ramashastri says संयोगत्वेन संयोगः व्याप्यवृत्तिरिति प्राचीनाः, संयोगत्वेनापि संयोगः अव्याप्यवृत्तिरेवेति नवीनाः। one of our students raised the following question. how it is acceptable? There should be samyoga between all the paramanus of ghata and Kala since all the paramanus are eternal and have some kind of kalasambandha. Hence samyoga should be vyapyavrtti by the form of samyogatva.



Where does one find details on khandapralaya and mahapralaya? Because it is not found in Vaisheshikabhashya and kiranavali. Popular saying is सर्वभावकार्यध्वंसः महाप्रलयः। सर्वकार्यद्रव्यध्वंसः अवान्तरप्रलयः is is a concoction of Navyas like many other nonsense theories like kaalikasambandha that will bind everything with everything?
