Dear all: Accepting any sound of a varga say k which is different in different languages of India as standard all other similar sounds are allophones. It may including the change to c, jihvaamuuliiya, c>k, its cognates in h. A number of them are already accepted by Panini also. In relation to script particularly in inscriptions, Fleet, Konow, Buhler, Dani and Ojha are very useful. An informative book by Maxmuller: A survey of languages which was originally meant for the script to priests may be consulted. Wackernagel: Altindische Grammatik -- I collects a number of varieties. Regards, spnarang
