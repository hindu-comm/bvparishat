Dear all

I am troubled, as usual, by two problems that my brother Dr. Panduranga raised recently:



1.

A) According to Dvaita philosophy and puurvamiimaamsaa, Varnas are different from dhvanis. dhvanis are manifestors of varnas.

What are the reasons to accept varnas different from dhvanis? Why should varnas be different from dhvanis? Apart from स एवायं गकारः pratyabhijnaa, what is the reason behind it? Is there any detailed discussion in this regard



B) Indian tradition (including Vyaakarana tantra etc.) recognises 50 or 51 varnas. What is the crieteria? Are there any other varnas? Example “फ” is accepted. What about “F”? what about “o” in “off” etc. similarly it does not recognise ह्रस्व ए i.e. ऎ. Is the native north indian tongue responsible for this? How it can be universal? Is there any detailed study



2. where does Udayana discuss jaati that is in छलजातिनिग्रहस्थान?
