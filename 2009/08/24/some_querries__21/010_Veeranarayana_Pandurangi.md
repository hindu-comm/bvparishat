thanks for all for explaining the intricacies of the subject.

  

I would like to point out my problem more clearly.

  

My problem basically is to come to a conclusion irrespective of our affiliation to some particular shastra or other. in my view clinging to ones own shastra, always, results in death without any fruitful understanding of the world (पदार्थतत्त्वज्ञान) for which we were sent to gurukulas from childhood and trying to get the same to date. hence one need not hang to same shastra on every matter. one can differ from his shastra.hence while discussing the Varnanityatvavaada it is always felt to understand the necessity and reasonability behind it.

  

  

Mimamsakas accept the varna as nitya and vibhu as well as dvaitavedanta, may be also other vedantas. but dvaita vedanta is clear as to this varnanityatva theory does not help the vedaapaurusheyatva. vedas can be apaurusheya without nitya varnas.vedaapaurusheyatva is based on the aanupuurviinityatva and not based on varnanityatva. The aanupuurvii will be there in the mind of Ishvara and hence Nitya. Even naiyayikas who say veda is made by Ishvara say that vedic aanupuurvii is the same to that of puurvakalpa. hence according tonaiyayikas, ईश्वरकृतis same as nitya. ईश्वरकृतत्व is for only namesake. the reason behind वर्णनित्यत्व is the प्रत्यभिज्ञा in the form of स एवायं गकारः. but whether this pratyabhijnaa lead us to वर्णनित्यत्व or not? this is the problem.

  

As Dr. Bhat pointed out, Naiyayikas say varnas are a kind of dhvani and anitya. they dont accept the pratyabhijnaa upholding the nityatva of shabda.pratyabhijnaaobjectifies only saajaatya. 

  

  

So far as modern linguistics is concerned the same objection will be raised by naiyayikas about this pratyabhijnaa.

  

It is important to note that in samskrita language (and many other languages) we have alphabets (aksharas) for each varna and thus we conclude that this person is uttering dhvani to indicate this universal varna. hence we can include all other variants of the same utterances
leading to the same varna. in the absence of such aksharas how one can conclude what one person is uttering? that happens in many languages which are only spoken and not written. then this pratyabhijnaa becomes null.

  

hence we can fairly doubt that varnanityatva theory is purely based on the our kalpanaa that "there is an eternal varna which is different from Dhvani" and not on the actual fact.

  

is it eternal and vibhu in modern linguistics also? where do these varnas based?

  

it is also difficult to think that varnas are eternal. suppose if English which has some unique varna (o in off) dies that unique varna will be out of world. we will continue to have only आ. then how it can be held eternal?Tamil has one special varna i.e. ra which is the samyukta of ra and La. our tongue can not turn to utter it.

  

I hope this will help us to come to a conclusion.

thanks again all, for your patience
