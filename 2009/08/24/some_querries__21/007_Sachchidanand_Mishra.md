Dear pandurangiji,

I am taking here your first problem.

This is a peculiar problem faced by every branch of Philosophy which accepts that the Shabda *Sound* is eternal.

The problem is-- The sound is eternal but we do not understand or have *Shabdabodha* at anytime. We have *Shabdabodha* only when there is an utterance of words. On the basis of this experance there are the Empiricist Naiyayikas who say that these ध्वनि are शब्द. There is no prooffor the purpose ofacceptance of Shabda from Dhvani. Therefor they make a classification that there are two types Shabda. शब्दो द्विविधो ध्वन्यात्मको वर्णात्मकश्च। On the other handthere are Meemansakas and Other philosophers Uttarmeemansaks who argue that शब्द is eternal keeping in mind that the Vedas are eternal. If शब्द is non-eternal how the Vedas being a group of words or शब्द could be eternal. At the same time our experiance should also be accomodated. Therefore they posit that actually the Varnas or Shabdas are eternal only Dhvani are produced. When we make कण्ठताल्वाद्यभिघात dvanis are produced. These dhavnis are different but the sound is no different. For this reason we say that the same word is uttered 15 times. वस्तुतः शब्दो ध्वनिना अभिव्यक्तो भवति।



The number of varnas in Sanskrit are 50 or 51. It does not mean that there is no possiblity of more varnas.
