i agree with Prof. Jha. Phonemes are identified by their appearance in contrastive situations - meaningful though. /k/ (kanthya, aghosha) contrasts with /g/ (kanthya, ghosha)as it can form separate meaningful words in the language if occuring in identical environments. A single abstract phoneme may appear in various forms called 'allophones' of the phoneme. These are mere variations in pronunciations andcan not form different meaningful words. The phenomenon is called 'allophony'. This may be comparable to the phenomena of allomorphy (morphemic alterations in a morpheme as per context).

  
On a ligher side... since ours is a 'Sanskrit' (standardized) language, there would be no allophones allowed ideally. Else you would be speaking 'Prakrit' !!!

  
The Sanskriteducation in the countryshould embrace linguistics in its curriculum, then only we would be able to appreciate our contribution to this 'western' discipline
