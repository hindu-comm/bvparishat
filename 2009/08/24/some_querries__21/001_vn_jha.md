It is a very good sign that such questions have come to your mind. This will take you to modern linguistics and after getting acquainted with the modern analysis you will feel astonished about the ancient wisdom.



Modern linguistics makes a distinction between phone and phoneme and a phoneme is defined as 'a class of phones' which will come closurer to the idea of varna and phones may be closure to the idea of dhvani, the revealer of varna.

The relationship between them is that of a particular and universal. For instance, there is only one phoneme say, /k/ but there are many phones of /k/. Even if one and same person utters k, each indivisual k phone is different (already demonstrated by the machine, Kymograph) but the listener grasps it as /k/. Therefore, /k/ is phoneme or varna and each and every individual linguistic noise of k is a phone or dhvani.



I do not know whether I am helping you or confusing you.



The best way is to read some basic text of modern linguistics ( Introducaion toTheorectical Linguistics by John Lyons)

and to get acquainted with authentic studies on Indian contributions to the science of phonetics (Ancient Indian Phonetics by W.S.Allen).



Very soon (hopefully, in six months time) a volume on **Language , Grammar and Linguistics in Indian Traditions(Ed. V N Jha)**, is going to be published from Delhi. I shall inform you in due course of time.





Each natural language works on a set of inventory of its phonemes and the inventory of the set is arrived at on the basis of its functions or use through the method of preparing contrastive pairs. Even this method was known to Patanjali, the Mahabhasyakara.
