Dear Pandurangaji



The topic is too vast at once. You will find a lot of material

in Mahabhasya(Navahnika) and Vakyapadiyam(Brahmakanda). I have translated the latter(Indian Books Center/Sri Sadguru Publications, New Delhi,1986) and it

will be certainly useful to you.



The concept of Varna is discussed in Satapathabrahmana,

Atharvaveda etc. . The number of varnas(63/64) had been there since time immemorial. Fa - is not there in Sanskrit and o as well. The Vedanga, viz Siksa is the authority in such matters.



Existence of Varnas in a Vakya is acceptable to Mimamsakas ( atha gaurityatra kah sabdah ? gakaraukaravisarjaniyah padam iti bhagavanupavarsah -

Sabarabhasyam, see also Slokavartikam ----Sabdanityatadhikaranam, Vakyadhikaranam and Sphotavadah), i.e. Sphota is not acceptable.



Your statement - Dhvanis are manifestors of Varnas - is in

line with Sphotavada.



Under - taparastatkalasya(Panini 1-1-69) Patanjali clearly

explains the difference bettween Sphota and Dhvani --

The Gunas such as Hrasva, Dirgha, Druta, Madhyama, Vilambita etc. are there in Dhvanis and not in Sphota--



evam tarhi sphotah sabdah, dhvanih sabdagunah, katham?

Bheryaghatavat(Vartikam) tadyatha - bheryaghatah bheryma-

hatya kascidvimsatipadani gacchati , kascittrimsat, kascit

catvarimsat, sphotastavaneva bhavati, dhvanikrta vrddhih  
  
dhvanih sphotasca sabdanam dhvanistu khalu lakshyate I

alpo mahamsca kesamcit ubhayam tatsvabhavatah II

(Udyotah -- vyaktavacam ubhayam, avyaktavacam varna-

dharmanaakrantadhvanirevetyarthah).



Please refer to Vakyapadiyam 1- 75,76,77,96 etc.



The question of short e and short o is discussed under

eon(Sivasutram) in Mahabhasya. Except in Satyamugriya

and Ranayaniya (Samaveda) -- sujate esva sunrte, sukram

te enyat yajatam te enyat, adhvaryo odrubhih -- in no other

Veda the above said varnas are available. It is the nature

of the language.



Thanks for raising such important issues.
