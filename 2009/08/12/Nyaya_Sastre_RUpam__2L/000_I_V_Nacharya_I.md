Respected Sir,  
PraNaamAH.As I was away from the town my reply was delayed.Please condone the delay.I solicit your valuable opinion on my article for my future guidance.Since I studied Nyaya Sastra more than 50 years have elapsed.As soon as I completed Nyaya I did'nt have any job.Hence I had to resort to other professional careers.Consequentially I could'nt call up to my memory what I studied in the long past.Any way I am very much grateful to you for the assignment given.I always expect such an assignment from you.If any idea is wrong on my part pl,be at liberty to correct me.It is pity our Sastraas& their scholars have become very rare.  
Yours Sincerely,  
IVNacharya \<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>(To test the dispatch of this Email I put a copy for me also.Hope you will not think otherwise)
