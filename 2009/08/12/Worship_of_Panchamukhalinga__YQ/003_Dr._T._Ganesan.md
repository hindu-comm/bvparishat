Dear Scholars,  
Doing the japa of the panchaksharamantra does not mean the worship of  
panchamukhalinga. Generally the mukhalinga worship is done at the temple only  
though Siva is visualised in the five-faced form in daily domestic worship both  
in the smaarta and the Saiva traditions.  
Also, the worship of panchamukhalinga was oroginally a pasupata tradition who  
installed mukhalinga-s at various places in he course of these centuries.  
Yours,  
Ganesan
