DearAcharya,



Thank you for the explanation.



Regarding Kalika-sambandha, the doubt I have is that when 'kala' is treated as 'part of maha-kala', abhava & bhava both exists in some part of it, that is the very reason that makes Kalika-sambhandha not so relevant (at least it looks odd for begineers when it is said anything can 'reside' is anything by kalika-sambhanda). Can you please clarify, may be I missing some basics?



Regards,

Vikas
