Dear Schoalars,  
I have heared about a book of C. Markandeya Shastri named  
"Sureshvara's contribution to Advaita". This book had been published  
from a Sanskrit Mahavidyala of Andhra Pradesha. I have tried to find  
out this book in many libraries but could not. Whether anybody amongst  
us has this book or seen this book somewhere in any library. If this  
book is available somewhere I could get it xeroxed. Probably it can be  
found somewhere in Aandhra or Tamilnadu.  
If anybody knows about it kindly let me know.  
Thanks a lot.
