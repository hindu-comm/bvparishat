Dr. Savitri garu,  
  
namaste. Thanks for your mail with beautiful attachment.  
All we Hindus, have a positive worship towards the almighty with free mind.  
Nowadays, we get such spiritual messages through email, sms  
apart from distributing pamphlets (now become extinct) etc.  
  
But I've a doubt. God will not become angry if someone  
don't forward a spiritual mail attributed to Him. At the same time,  
while forwarding such mails, god may not be on cloud nine and  
immediately grants him/her with a boon. Ultimately, one's *adrishta* matters.  
But one advantage with spiritual mails is this that we contemplate  
on god for a while, I strongly agree with it. I am very sorry if my words  
anyway offending. I just thought to share my view.  
  
With regards,  
Dr. Prasad
