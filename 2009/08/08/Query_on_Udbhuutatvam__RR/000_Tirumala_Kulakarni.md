Dears,



In Nyaya two types ofरूप are accepted i.e 1. उद्भूतरूपम् 2. अनुद्भूतरूपम्. The रूप of इन्द्रिय is अनुद्भूत. Though इन्द्रिय has रूप but not visible its रूप has been accepted as अनुद्भूत. At this point I have a question -



महत्त्व + रूप will manage all requirements of उद्भूतरूपम्. So what is the strong arguments behind this category of Ruupa.
