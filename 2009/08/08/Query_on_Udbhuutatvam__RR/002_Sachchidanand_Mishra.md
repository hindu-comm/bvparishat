Well. This is a very good question. Really the Naiyayikascould meet thequestion very beautifullyif itwere asked that what are the criteria fulfilling that something would be perceptible. It is true that "महत्त्व + रूप will manage many requirements of उद्भूतरूपम्. So what is the strong arguments behind this category of Ruupa.". But there is a case which would not be maneged. For this reason in Nyayamuktavali says ग्रीष्मोष्मादेरप्रत्यक्षत्वात् उद्भूतरूपेति। This is the reason behind this. It cannot be said that ग्रीष्मोष्मा does not have महत्त्व and रूप. Both are present in ग्रीष्मोष्मा and also in चक्षुरिन्द्रिय Why then these are not perceptible only due to absence of उद्भूतरूप.  
I think your question is well answered now.
