Yes. I too observed that scholars reply to the author thru this list. Please note that if anybody wants to write to the author of a mail, please use the option "Reply to the author" in case you are using BVP webpage. If you are using Gmail A/c then please don't click on reply ; instead, copy the authors mail id and write to him directly.  
  
Please avoid personal discussions on the list. You may face trouble in case of any confidential matter.  
  
warm regards,
