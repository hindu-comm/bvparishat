Respected scholars, Namaskar!

Shree BV Giri asked question on Purushamedha. In ancient India we had Ashvamedha. I found the word Grihamedheeya rite in the book Mimaamsaa Nyaaya Prakasha or Aapadevi by Franklin Edgerton. There the meaning of Grihamedhin is given as a householder. So what is exactly the meaning of -"medha" in above words. I always found sematics of Sanskrit words more appealing because weknow how the grammar of Sanskrit was changing (From Panini to Katantra) gradually. We also know that there are many books written by well known scholars on "Word and Meaning".Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
