Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

(1) I am delighted to see interest in my book by Dr. Pandurangi, Dr. Janardhan, Shree B.R. Srivatsa and Dr. Girish Zha (pardon me if spelled wrong). The book is in manuscript form. I am trying to add some more items in it. I am also trying to visit India soon. I am praying God for that because living in USA is like sitting on the vibrating platform. Banks are failing and we are running to move money from one bank to another. Anyway I am enjoying participation in this list. I would really like to talk personally to the scholars from list in connection with my book. Let us hope things work out soon. I missed the chance to talk with Dr. S. Korad who visited USA recently. In the same week my bank failed. Now I would like to add few interesting notes.

(2) I am glad to see the posting of Dr. Kapil Kapoor mentioning the names of Firth, Saussure etc from early humanistic period in European linguistics. W.S.Allen also refers to borrowing of ideas from Indian books.

(3) This is not only true in case of linguistics, but also in Mathematics hundreds of years before discovery of Sanskrit by Europeans. In 800 AD AL Kwarizmi from the Middle east translated in Arabic a book on Algebra from India. That book reached Lebanon in 1200 AD when Italian businessman Fibonacci visiting the country. He got hold of the book. From that book Europeans came to Indian numerals and zero. Fibonacci realized superiority of Indian numerals to keep accounts to that of Roman numerals of Europe. The same book explained how to solve algebraic problem step by step. Solving problem step by step came to be known as AL Kwarizmi method in Europe. From the word “Al Kwarizmi” came the present computer word “Algorithm”. In seventeenth century England there were advertisements, “A Margarita, do not use Roman numerals, use Indian numerals, mathematics becomes easy”. From Indian numerals in 1200 AD to the man on the moon in 800 years, is the great leap forward of European and American world.

(4) The Russian scientist Mendeleev got his idea of periodic table of chemical elements from Sanskrit Varnamaalaa. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
