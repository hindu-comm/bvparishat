Learned Scholars, Namaskara,



What does a word mean, is a question which seems to imply that there is a definite meaning which answers the question. But, it is also admitted that a

word may have more meanings than one. If that is so,

then one has to resort to the context within which the

the word occurs. Thus the meaning of the term 'medha' can, perhaps, be determined by going over

the context where it is actually used. I am afraid,I

am just uttering something commonplace.
