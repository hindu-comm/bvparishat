Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



First question- Sometimes the English word “word” is used to indicate “pada” in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit word “pada” is called syntactic unit. The VarNaatmaka shabda is called “speech unit” and Dhvanyaatmaka shabda is called “sound pulse”. I am reserving Dhvani to contrast it with Sphota.

Does this make sense or some revision is needed?



Second question-Now what is the meaning of “Shabda” in Shabdabrahma? Next it is said repeatedly that “GuNa” of Aakaash is Shabda. For shabda we need material medium. Aakaasha is not a material medium. So what kind of “Shabda” is this associated with Aakaasha?



Third question- What is the English word for PratyabhijnyAna? In what way PratyabhijnyAna is different from abhijnyAna? Do both mean “recognition”? Is it possible to illustrate the difference by an example?

Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
