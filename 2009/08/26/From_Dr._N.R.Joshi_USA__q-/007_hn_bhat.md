First  
\> question- Sometimes the English word “word” is used to  
\> indicate “pada” in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit word  
\> “pada” is called syntactic unit. The VarNaatmaka shabda  
\> is called “speech unit” and  
\> Dhvanyaatmaka shabda is called “sound pulse”.  
  
I am reserving Dhvani to contrast it with Sphota. Does  
this make sense or some revision is needed?  
  

I think this has been dealt with in detail by I V Acharya in his  
attached document. I have also added to it my modifications to the  
derivation of the words in a separate document attached.  
  
In view of the śabdabrahma, the Supreme basic cognition original  
source of speech activity, the meaning of the words dhvani, śabda, and  
pada varies relatively in Sanskrit itself. Similarly, your question  
needs some more clarification, as to in which context do you wants to  
make this differentiation. I have tried to give a gist of etymological  
meaning and differential meaning according to cetain of the śāstra-s.  
  
For the question, you may be right in making the difference between dhvani and  
varṇa in a general and materialistic sense. Consider the sentence of  
Mahābhāṣya -- sphoṭaḥ = śabdaḥ, dhvaniś ca śabdaguṇaḥ. etc. quoted in  
my attachment.  
  
For the second question, the word śabdabrahma also you can see this  
word śabda in the same sense as in the sentence quoted above, where  
it is synonymous with sphoṭa. But dhvani is made the quality of this  
śabda. What you have asserted is in accordance with the Naiyayika-s  
and their followers. The word in this wider sense is analyzed by Bimal  
Krishna Matilal in his book “The word and the World” (OUP, 1990). The  
view of Naiyayika-s make a difference between “dhvani” and “varṇa”  
as speech sound differentiated from other sounds non-speech and speech  
sounds. And, as you suggested, in your second question, śabda is the  
quality of ākāśa or ether, which is a substance, dravya according to  
the system. The status of ether, I don’t know the present position of  
ether in modern physics, but it was once supposed to be substratum for  
electromagnetic waves (A medium that was once supposed to fill all  
space and to support the propagation of electromagnetic waves) which  
collaborates with Naiyayika-s theory of sound produced in the form of  
waves. Similarly, in respect of the status of śabda and varṇa you  
can see the different views according to the different systems of  
philosophy in the context of speech sounds briefly condensed by V  
Krishnamacharya, in his Sanskrit Introduction to the Sphoṭavāda (Adyar  
Library Series 54).  
  
Third question seems to be simple. Both are derived from the same  
root, but make the difference in their usage in different contexts.  
The word abhi+jñā is used in a broader sense, like in abhijña a knower  
of things, specialized in any subject or thing. abhi+jñāna is popular  
by its usage in the title abhi+jñāśākuntalam (meaning the recognition  
of śākuntalā) almost similar to the one to be contrasted. It may  
differ from usage to usage in its meaning according to different  
context. But praty+abhi+jñā is popularly used in a restricted  
cognition, a form of cognition of a person/thing identifying one with  
another seen in another context. In this, it will be conveyed by the  
English word recognition in a restricted sense as a form of cognition.  
This is my opinion.  
  
Scholars are welcome to do so, if my assertions need any modification  
or rectification in view of modern linguistic studies.
