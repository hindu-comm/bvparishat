Respected scholars, Namaskar!

I would like to thank Shree hn Bhat for Shabda Vichara file. Itcertainly helped me. Next  
thanks to Shree hb Bhat and Dr. Dipak Bhattacarya for explaining the correct meaning behind Purus'amedha.

I still have question-If grihamedha is sacrifice for a house, pitrimedha is sacrifice for manes, then why not Ashvamedha is sacrifice for horse? But usually it is understood as sacrifice of a horse. Does not meat-juice involves of killing of horse.May be we did not understand correctly the ancient word, "Medha".

I have problem with etymology of many Sanskrit words like Megha (cloud), Shaakhaa (branch),khara (rough) and even Ratha (chariot). Sometimes the rule of reversal of sounds in a word is used to reach the result. Couple of months ago I read the book," The Etymologies In Shathapatha Brahman" by Dr.Nargis Verma. Although the book offer a lot of information on different types of etymologies, etymologies of certain words appear to be somehow forced especially from the chapter on The Sacrificial Etymologies. Nirvacanas (where regular vyutpatti from Dhaatu is not possible) in some cases appear to be forced in case of words listed (Megha etc) above. There is the problem of Sanskrit technical terminology from the ancient Indian books on metallurgy, chemistry, astronomy or Vaimanik Shastra. Modern day English writers draw on Greek and Latin to create new technical terminology. In ancient India Sanskrit speakers did not know any language other than Sanskrit. What was the governing principle they used to create technical terminology? Was it random or by using some rules unknown to us today? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
