Respected Scholars,  
praNaamaH.The questions asked by Dr.Shri N.R.Joshi are answered in detail as viewed by thru an attachment enclosed here-with.To add to that here is some thing more detailed.  
Word means in Biblical terms "God's word".Some times we say Word is God.  
In Indian philosophy also "Veda" means "God" "Vedyate anena iti VedaH" is its derivative meaning.'AUM"is God.Omkaara prabhavaaH VedaaH" is the famous saying.For "Pada" also "padyate anena" is its derivation."padyate"means Praapyate.Who is praapyate? It is only the Almighty.So in English or in Sanskrit the meaning is the same.For the 2 & 3 questions I think the attachment can answer.  
I solicit the scholars' opinion on my views.  
With Regards,  
I.V.N.Acharya.\<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>
