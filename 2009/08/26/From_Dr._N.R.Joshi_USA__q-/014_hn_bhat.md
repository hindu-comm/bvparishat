Dear Bhattacharya,  
  
I had been closely watching the goings and was about prepare answer.  
The question raised by Mr. Joshi was the etymological derivations are  
confusing and is there any principle for coining technical terms? Or  
so generally semantic problem. Now, after a lot of things being  
discussed in respect of the word medha, being homonym and in certain  
contexts it may differ. The reply given in the previous message is  
also quite right as the context is the deciding factor. In the case  
of homonyms, there are many other elements and standards to decide the  
purport. In spite of this, Now, you say common do not remember the  
vyutpatti. I now, without going into detail, all the other elements  
that contribute to derive the meaning of a word in a context, a saying  
by Mahabhashyakara -  
  
naiṣa sthāṇor aparādhaḥ yad enam andho na paśyati.  
\[It is not the fault of the stump if a blind man could not see it (and  
stumble down upon it).  
  
When there are many other means to overcome the complexities, there is  
no point in blaming the system without making an effort to having some  
insights to the system and the statement made by Mr. Joshi the system  
of etymological derivation seems to be problematic: "I have problem  
with etymology of many Sanskrit words" seems to be out of place.  
  
This is my sincere opinion. Scholars may differ in their opinions.  
  
I was about to attach a file discussing the points raised by NR Joshi,  
but now it seemed it has reached some conclusion.  
  
With regards
