Dear Prasad Ji,  
praNaamaH.Regarding Samyoga in respect of its vyapya vrittitwa and avyapya vrittitwa you can please refer to the "Attachment"enclosed here-with.  
As regards "kaala" there is only one Kaala i.e. Mahakaala,I opine.Bhava and abhava,both exist in it.Kaalika Sambandha is relevant.How it is irrelevant needs a little explanation.What basics you are missing and what basics you want if you tell me clearly I can clarify my best or I can get them clarified thru experts.  
With Regards,  
Sincerely Yours,  
I.V.N.Acharya.\<[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()\>
