Though these two mean the same, the word Ontology is mostly used to convey \`the basic[categories of being](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being "Category of being")and their relations'. In IIIT Hydrabad major research is going based on Vaisheshika "ontology" i.e. पदार्थव्यवस्था.

  

Here is an excerpt from Wikipedia on ontology -

**\`Ontology**is the[philosophical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy")study of the nature of[being](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being "Being"),[existence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence")or[reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality")in general, as well as of the basic[categories of being](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being "Category of being")and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as[metaphysics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), ontology deals with questions concerning what[entities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entities "Entities")exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped, related within a[hierarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy "Hierarchy"), and subdivided according to similarities and differences.'
