But we frequently use the word ज्ञानमीमांसा forEpistemology and तत्त्वमीमांसा for Ontology. These words are accepted by the philosophers who write frequently in Hindi. But there is a problem for Metaphysics too we use the same term तत्त्वमीमांसा. I think there is not much difference between the terms Ontology and Metaphysics.
