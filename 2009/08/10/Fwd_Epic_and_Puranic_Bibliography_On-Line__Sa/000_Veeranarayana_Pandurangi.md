Dear list members,  
  
we are glad to announce that as of today an electronic version of the Epic  
and Puranic Bibliography is available at  
<http://www.indologie.uni-goettingen.de/cms/index.php?id=5>. As indicated on  
the welcome page the Epic and Puranic Bibliography On-Line publishes the work  
of over a decade of the "Tübingen Purana-Project". The on-line bibliography  
contains all entries of the printed version "Epic and Puranic Bibliography  
(up to 1985) annotated and with indexes" (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1992)  
as well as the yet unpublished work of the second phase and the new entries  
which are now added to the more than 13,000 entries available from the first  
two phases.  
EPB On-Line is "interactive" as every user can contribute new entries to this  
bibliography. Specific goals of making EPB interactive are:  
  
 \* to add new publications and publications in languages so far not  
included, in particular Indian languages, Japanese, Slavic languages, etc.  
 \* to diminish the number of non-verified entries, i.e., entries that  
were included in the bibliography on the basis of secondary sources  
(footnotes, reviews, bibliographies, etc.) without the details having been  
verified by autopsy.  
 \* to add reviews of the books already included in the bibliography.  
  
We hope that this publication will prove useful and we encourage you all to  
use it -- as source of information and by contributing to it actively.  
  
EPB is hosted on the server of the University of Göttingen. All questions and  
comments concerning administration or contents may be addressed to  
epb\[at\][uni-goettingen.de](http://uni-goettingen.de).
