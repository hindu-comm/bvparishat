Dear Scholars,  
I have uploaded Sureshvara's Manasollas with the commentary  
"Manasollasavardhini" of Ananta Krishna Shastriji. This book is edited  
by me and is published from Varanasi. Ananta Krishna Shastriji Had  
been one of greatest scholars of Indian Philosophy in 20th century.  
Probably it is the last book written by him. I have edited this book  
on the basis of a single and rare manuscript.  
I hope the scholars would find this book very useful.  
Yours
