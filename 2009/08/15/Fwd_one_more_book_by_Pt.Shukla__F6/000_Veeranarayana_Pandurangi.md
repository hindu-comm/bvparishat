Subject: one more book by Pt.Shukla  
To: Veeranarayana Pandurangi \<[veer...@gmail.com]()\>  
  
  
Dear Prof. Pandurangi,  
  
I've found a book that seems to contain a commentary by Pt.Shukla in Hindi, see below. Is it true that the commentary is authored by Badarinathji?  
And one more question, where could I find more information about life of the pandit? Are you aware of any his (auto)biographies?  
  
Many thanks in advance for any help!  
  
Yours truly,  
Dmiry
