Yeah. This commentary is written by BadariNath Shuklaji. I have this book with me. I am not aware of any autobiography or biography of Pandit Shuklaji but as many things I know I am writing here.

Pandit Badarinath Shukla was born in the District Basti in Uttar Pradesh. I am also from Basti. In fact knowing the scholarship of Pandit Shuklaji I started to learn Nyaya.  

He wrote these books. I do not know whether this list is exastive list of his all publications.

1.  A commentary of Tarkabhasha. 2.  A commentary on Vedantasar. 3.  A comentary on Vidhivad section of Tattvachintamani 4.  Shatashloki An original book on Nyaya (Unfortunately I have not seen
    this book yet but I have read outabout this book in the article
    written by Prof. D. Prahladachar in a volume of "Development of
    Indian Philosophy eighteenth century towards" \[edited by Prof. Daya
    Krishna\] 5.  His an article नव्यन्यायविचारपद्धत्या देहात्मवादस्य सम्भावना is very
    famous article. 6.  His many articles which were delevered as a resource person in a
    workshop conducted by Prof. Radha Vallabh Tripathi in 1984 are
    published in the book "Nyayasatram" from HSGour University, Sagar. 7.  My one friend had been telling me that he also had written a
    refutation of his own articleनव्यन्यायविचारपद्धत्या देहात्मवादस्य
    सम्भावना which is not published yet. 8.  He has written another book आरम्भवादः

If he would have written other books I am not aware of.
