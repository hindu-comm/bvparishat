Acharya Badarinath Shukla's wife name was 'Murtimati'. He has written  
'Arambhvada' in Sanskrit as MA student of BHU which is published from  
'Motilal Banarasi Das'. He had appointed directbly in BHU by Madan  
Mohan Malviya as a teacher though he was passed Shastri examination  
only from BHU, At that time.  
There are so many things more but time is limited so we should plan to  
write a book on him.
