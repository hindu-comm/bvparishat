Shrii Badariinaatha Shukla was a great Naiyayika, Professor at the Sampurnananda Samskrit Vishvavidyalaya, Varanasi. He later on also became the Vice-Chancellor of that Univeristy. Anyone interested in finding the details of his life and works should write to the current Vice-Chancellor Professor Kutumba Shastri of that University. Professor Shukla was a great scholar, and Professor Kutumba Shastri can easily arrange for information about him as a matter of respect, especially since Badarinatha Shukla was extraordinary scholar who taught there, and also became the Vice Chancellor.
