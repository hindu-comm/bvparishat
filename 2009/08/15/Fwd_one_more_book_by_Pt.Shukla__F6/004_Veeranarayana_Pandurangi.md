thanks both Prof. Dixit and Mishra, other works we have known. infact I have also this book on vidhivada. infact Prof, Shukla himself wrote on his appointment in SSushama recalling Balakrishna Mishras affection towards him. he recalledBalakrishna Mishra recommending his name of appointmentwhen he raised the next koti while being taugth Savyabhicara (if I am correct) before guru himself thinking of that koti. He was legendary scholar. thanks. one more thing he recalled is that Mishraji providing the navaneeta for frying shashkulis when oil they (shishyas)had procured was not sufficient and
Mishrajisaidबालकृष्णस्य गृहे नवनीतस्य कथमभावः  
but there is no full biography.

thanks
