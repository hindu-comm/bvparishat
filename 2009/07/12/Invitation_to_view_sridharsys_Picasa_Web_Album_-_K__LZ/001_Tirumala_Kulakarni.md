Dear Sridhar,



Thank you very much for giving us such a nice opportunity. By clicking the link I got the experience of Kailasaparvata-maanasasarovara yaatraa.



I wondered by seeing birds in Manasasarovara. Because I was told by someone that the temperature in Manasasarovara doesn't allow birds to live. So the Hamsa-Maanasasarovara connection often mentioned in Sanskrit Kaavyas are just Kavisamaya. But, though there are no Hamsa, at least there are birds!



Another question, there is a mention of Vyaasaguhaa. In Mana near Badarinath also a Vyaasaguhaa is shown. What is the difference?
