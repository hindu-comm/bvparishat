Dear Sir,  
Aged Buddhist monk staying at Qugu, bank of sarovar, says that he had heard that there were Hamsas in the past but he had not seen. We could see some birds that were golden in colour ( may be crane ) always moving in pair and some as seen in photo. There were fishes in the Sarovar that may be the food for these birds.  
  
The Cave which is known as Vyasa Guha at Kalapani is not easily reachable. It seems some ITBP personnel had been there with rock climbing skills and found that it can easily accomadate 7-8 people. But the one in Mana is reachable.  
  
There may not be any problem in thinking that Bhagavan Vyasa had stayed at both the places.  
  
Regards  
Sridhar
