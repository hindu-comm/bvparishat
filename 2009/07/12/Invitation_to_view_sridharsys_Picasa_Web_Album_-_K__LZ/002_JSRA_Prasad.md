Dear Sridhar,  
  
Thanks a lot for wonderful images of kailasa yatra. I was amazed to see the image of OM mountain  
which just resembles the Devanagari character (pics. 62-65 especially) 'OM'.  
  
Just a loud thinking! If I am not considered mythologically superstitious, can we see the Hamsas with  
our naked eyes? As is stated by Sri Tirumala, is it actually a kavi samaya? I am just curious to know!  
  
Prasad
