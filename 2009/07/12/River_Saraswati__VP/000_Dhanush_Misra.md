***Dear Sirs,***

***The views expressed by Shri Narang are serious and must be duly considered. Therefore I request Shri Narang and other members of the group to please enlighten me on the following items.***

***1. When and by whomit was firstsuggested that river Saraswati had physically existed and has now dried up? What was the basis of such a suggestion?***

***2. When and by whom its so called extinct dried up course was first purported to have beendiscovered?***

***3. Is there any satellite picture by NASA showing the course of the extinct river?***

***4. Was any drilling done along the so called dried up course and has any water from any such drill holebeen used for drinking orirrigation?***

***5. Do the so called, now abandoned, Indus valley settlements suggest the existence of such an extinct river or rivers?***

***6. Did the rivers Sutlej and Jamuna had any thing to do with the so called extinct river Saraswati?***

***I suppose the video named after somebodyPingle and Wakankar could have answered these questions; but I am unable to down load it because ofits large size. Is it possible to get the video on a CD or DVD? If so what is the price?***

***If the answer to all these questions is that there was never any such river and every thing about it is purely imaginary, I fully agree with Shri Narang thatsuch thingsshould not be mailed to the group.***

***However if there is any evidence of such river having physically existed, I would like to know whether we should refrain from discussing, or even knowing, about it because it hurts the interest ofsome political parties?***

***Eagerly waiting for your valued reply,***

***Yours faithfully,***

***D.D.Misra***
