Respected Scholars Pranaam!

Passing away of number of Sanskrit scholars created feeling of sadness among scholars of bvparishat. I share their feelings although I am away from India.

Subject: Talk on Rigveda by Harvard Univesity Professor of Sanskrit and LinguisticsMichael Witzel on July 10 at the India International Center.

The talk was presided over by Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan.Dr.Bhagwan Singh participated in debate. Did any member of bvparishat attended this talk or his other presentation in India? To the best of my knowledge Prof Witzel's papers are directedtowards the ancient history of Vedas, Sanskrit, Indus civilization and indirectly towards Mahabharat history. All these topics are also controversial. I am waiting to get report from my scholar friends from India. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
