Respected Joshi ji,  
  
Namaste!  
  
I was in Delhi yesterday and I had meetings with my friends in JNU centre. Many of them are worried about these developments and about support he is recieving for his anti-inidan thoughts. Due to some unknown reasons and may be for not having good research-results in hand, no serious questions or vioces are raised against this. Irony is india is funding the whole tour ! (I heard so)  
  
How to combat this batle ? Scholars should respond to this. Otherwise this becomes history.  
  
regards,  
shrivara
