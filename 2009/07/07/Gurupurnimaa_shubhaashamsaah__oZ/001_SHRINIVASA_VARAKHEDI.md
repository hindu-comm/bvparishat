Today we observed VyasaPurnima in Sanskrit Academy. Dr.Vedantam Kumaraswami a renowned scholar was the guest. In his speech he obsrved that we Indians are making a big mistake by not giving proper place for Bhagavaan Vyasa who is the main source of Sanatana Dharma. We forgot him. There are two resons - one, in pre-independent india, Acharyas who wrote Bhashyas occupied prominent place in all Sampradayas. Second - In post indepent india, Govt. started to observe teachers day.  
  
We should not forget Vyasa Bhagavan.
