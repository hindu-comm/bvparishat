It is rather nonsensical, not the stuff that serious scholars should  
treat with anything but contempt. Let us not be misled by such tripe.  
While we can believe in India's greatness, we should avoid being so  
parochial that we go to unnatural lengths and make fantastic  
interpretations and connections to propound the same. Such अविद्यमान  
स्तुति actually has the opposite effect of what is intended; it makes  
the real great aspects also seem not-so-great by association.  
  
It is clearly correct to say that Columbus discovered the Americas in  
modern times, as his discovery started the stream of travel to and  
from those continents. Some centuries earlier, the Vikings led by  
Leif Ericson are said to have discovered North America, landing in  
what is modern Newfoundland. Even earlier, people have crossed the  
then-frozen Bering Strait between modern Alaska and Russia. (Many  
people don't realize that the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and later  
Russia, are actually neighboring countries, being separated by just a  
few kilometers at the closest point.)
