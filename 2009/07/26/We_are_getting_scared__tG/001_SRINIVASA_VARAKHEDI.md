Dear All,  
  
It becomes our duty to express our opinion on this matter as  
moderators of the group.  
  
1. The concern of Dr.R.Sadashiva Murty is genuine. We must honor what  
he has expressed. I think no member of this group has any different  
opinion.  
  
2. We are not moderating each mail submitted by echolars, thinking  
that they are learned and there should not be any editing. (Of course  
editing is not required)  
  
3. I also understand that language differs person to person. Sometimes  
even a soft and straight forward word / syntax may sound odd to  
others. However, we request all members to use words carefully while  
not hurting others or others sentiments.  
  
4. Our motive should be - Anudvegakaram vaakyam satyma priyahitam cha  
yat...(BG)/ bahu vyaharataa anena na kinchid apashabditam (Ramayana)  
  
Let us not much discuss about this. The matter is closed here. All  
scholarly members are requested to encourage discussions. Kindly share  
your academic programs/interests also.

\> If any one wishes to deny the views of others it could be very beautiful if presented with equally sound logic and resulted from good research exercise and experience.. But unfortunately we often come across here certain people who do not hesitate to use very inconvenient and unpleasant wordswhich can be clung to only when proper contentthe presenter is missingto convince others.  
\> Personal level comments and certain adjectives against others aurguments are a few instances of such kind.  
\> There are some people among us who are very much traditional in thought and deed also.  
\> Some others are lovers of occidental view of our Indian Learning and Culture. Well we honour both the groups. Both are healthy and we need both of the thought streams provided they basically help for the protection of our Ancient Indian Leanring Tradition.  
\> I feel it is necessary to remember that all the participants here are learned scholars.  
\> So it could be highly pleasing and convenient if such insulting and iltreating adjectives are given no room in our language and if we take proper care of the language we use.  
\> Otherwise we feel advised to continute further to be dumb forever in this forum.
