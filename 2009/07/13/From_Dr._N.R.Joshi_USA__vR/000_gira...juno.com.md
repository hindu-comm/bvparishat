Respected Scholars, Panama !

Universities and Higher leaning and Research Institutions are academic institutions. To the best of my knowledge,at pesent,Harvard University Professor of Linguistics and Sanskrit, Dr.Michael Witzel is on lecture tour of India. His research, his activities other than academic distinctly present his positionon Aryan Invasion of India in the ancient times.However on this subject scholars all over world have different opinions as can be read from the book. "Indo-Aryan Controversy" by Edwin F. Bryant and Laurie L. Patton. These authors occupy university positions. This subject had tremendous political effect in the past on Europe. If any political party of India favors a particular academically discussed subject which has not fully resolved yet, it is the fault of the political party and not of academic instititutions.Free exchange of opinions on any subject from the ancient history of India, like Sanskrit origin, Mahabharat, Archaeological excavations inside and outside of India could be treated academically without taking positions.In my opinion such free exchange of information (not position) is needed to bring out new information. However if bvparishat would like to limit itself to Sanskrit only in order to filter out other areas, it can do so. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
