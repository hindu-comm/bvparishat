Pranam to all! The group should consider the academic issues and not the political issues. If a particular issue is identified as political or belonging to a particular political party and its intension is to propagate the objectives of the party, it shouldbe defintely discouraged. If there are new findings on a particularissue, it should be highlighted to the scholars. The guiding principle should be: Is it academic or political? To me it is purely an academic body and all the issues other than that should be discouraged or ignored. Regards, SPNarang
