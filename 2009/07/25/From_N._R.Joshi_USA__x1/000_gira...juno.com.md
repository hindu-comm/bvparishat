Respected Scholars Pranaam!

(1)The eighteenth International Congress of Vedanta was held in USA (Dartmouth) on July 16-19. I could not go to conference. Prof. Korad Subrahmanyam attended the conference. There were two papers on Sphota doctrine-mine and other of Somveer Shastri of JNU Delhi. Prof. K. Subrahmanyam , if possible, please let us know your impression of the conference and your evaluation of some papers you like.

(2) I read the book recently, “Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir” edited by Dr. Ashok Aklujkar and Mrinal Kaul. The book presents high level research papers on Sanskrit grammar, poetics and philosophy of language and religion (Shaiva tradition). In the paper of Prof, C. Rajendran from Kerala, there is discussion on understanding of Sphota and Dhvani by various authors. Some how Sphota doctrine has attracted attention of scholars (supportive and in opposition) from the past 2000 years of Indian linguistic traditions.

(3) Let us come to the latest subject. First I thank both Dr. V. Pandurangi and Dr. S. Varakhedi for appreciating my brief posting on the occasion of the visit of Harvard Prof. Michael Witzel. In India his controversial writings are liked and disliked. Since Prof. Witzel is from the world famous academic institution, any contradiction to his theories about the ancient Indian (Vedic) civilization has to come from the equally famous Sanskrit and history scholars of the top level Indian University. In the meanwhile I will present here my observations.

(4) Part 1:New Moon in the ancient history of India by Dr. N. R. Joshi.

Dr. S. D. Joshi is internationally recognized top level scholar of Sanskrit. On the page 13 of his book, “The Ashtadhyayi of Panini” with Roodbegen, it was said that, “How Sanskrit originated, or for that matter, how the Brahmins originated, we do not know.” (My comment: This makes me nervous.)

Dr. Thomas R. Trautmann (University of Michigan) in the preface of his book, “Aryans and British India,” says, “at an early point in the course I explain how Sanskrit entered India from the direction of Iran, and was spoken by people who called themselves, “Arya”. The same author in the book, “The Aryan Debate” on page 105 in his article, “Constructing the Racial Theory of Indian Civilization”, says at the end, “That the racial theory of the Indian civilization has survived so long and so well is a miracle of faith. It is high time to get rid of it.” So the racial part of Aryan Invasion Theory is dead now, but linguistic part is still kicking.

Dr. N. Kazanas (paper-Organic Coherence in Sanskrit and other Indo-European branches) says this, “Sanskrit is related phonologically and morphologically to Greek, Latin, Germanic, Slavic and other Indo-European languages. All these languages are thought to be daughters of a Proto-Indo-European language which comparative philologists have reconstructed. But only Sanskrit has inner Organic Coherence, that is word families (verbs, nouns etc) derived from dhaatus (roots). In all other branches verbs or nouns in most cases stand isolated without other relatives. This shows that Sanskrit is much closer to ProtoIndoEuropean and that the current reconstructions are wrong”.

Thus there are differences in opinions of scholars about Sanskrit of India. For this reason the linguistic part of Aryan Invasion Theoryis still kicking. Because of the long New Moon Day (between 3000 BC and 600 BC) in the ancient history of India, the origin of Sanskrit, Mahabharat history and Indus civilization have become entangled issues. My research in Mahabharat history clearly shows the connection with countries outside of the subcontinent. The best example is of Asian Amazons (Stree Raajya).My humble efforts are to untangle these issues. Although Sanskrit grammatical traditions are highly respected all over the world, there exist a lot of contradictions in grammar. We may be missing something from the unknown history of Sanskrit. Thanks. I apologize for the long posting. N.R.Joshi.
