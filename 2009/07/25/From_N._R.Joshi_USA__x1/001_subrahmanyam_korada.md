Dear Dr Joshiji



sorry to keep you waiting.I was to inaugurate a

Vakyarthasabha at Sringeri as soon as I returned from

Vedanta Congress(VC).



As far as the VC is concerned, it was a blend of many

subjects rather than Vedanta alone.

There were Papers, apart from Vedanta, on Avadhanam(Astavadhanam etc. and it is less known to people other than Telugu,Sanskrit and Kannada)

etc.

There were good papers on Vedanta- by a New York

based American(Moksa thru Bhakti),Religion,Philosophy and Secularism in India and the Western World - by two Americans etc.

I attended the Lecture by Prof Akluskar and it was

very informative.The Scholar took the Historical background to refute the Aryan Invasion etc.One may

feel that the material from Mahabhasya(6-3-109,Prisodaradini),Manusmriti,Purvamimamsa ,Amarakosa

etc. can also be quoted in suport of the article.



Prof Harekrisna Satapathy, Vice Chancellor of TirupatiSanskrit Uni. proposed that the Sakti that is

responsible for the expression of Artha by Sabda is

Maya only and he touched Sphota also in this regard.

Mr Sastri from Delhi presented a Paper on Sphota but

I could not attend the same as I was in the other Session.

By and large it was a nice experience to listen to such a number of Scholars on different topics.
