Grāma and Saṅgrāma by N. R. Joshi

From the book (A History of India) of Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund (p.38-39)

The German Indologist Wilhelm Rau, who has analysed Late Vedic text (after 1000 BC) for evidence of social and political change in this period has shown that the word grama originally referred to a nomadic group, its train of vehicles and its band of warriors. The train of vehicles obviously formed a ring or barricade of wagons whenever the group took a rest. This would explain why in one Brahmana text it is mentioned that ‘the two ends of the grama came together. It is also significant that the word samgrama, which still means ‘war’ today, is related to this term. Samgrama must have originally meant a meeting (sam-together) of two or more grama, which in the social context of those days always meant a fight. When the Vedic people settled down they moved from carts into houses and the word grama came to refer to a village rather than a train of vehicles. It is characteristic that in all Rigvedic texts grama still means a train of vehicles or group of warriors and only in the Brahmana texts does it mean a village. The word grama also means a whole multitude as in Bhutagrama. The word samgrama is also used in Geeta with meaning war.

**My question: Are there different opinions of Indian scholars on meanings and relation of grama and samgrama? Since the word samgrama is used in Geeta,does the above etymology have bearing on time of Mahabharat war? Could it be in Late Vedic period after 1000 BC?**

****Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
