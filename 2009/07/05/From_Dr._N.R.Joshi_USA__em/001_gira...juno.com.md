Respected Scholars, Pranaam!

I did not know when did the word ‘Sangraama’ as war or fight find its use in the ancient Indian literature. So I took Geeta’s example. I say is there any bearing----. I am not saying anything about the year of Kurukshetra battle. At present I have no opinion on it.



Now this is for Dr. Titumal Kulkarni. I did not ignore your question. I have information. I would like to offer little more information before I answer your question.



In my posting of connection between Graama and Sangraama, I presented the opinion of the German Indologist Wilhem Rau. Now I offer information from Lithuanian archaeologist late Marija Gimbutas from her book “The Balts”. She writes, “Sanskrit and Baltic are the two linguistic poles between which the languages of the Indo-European homelands are found. Along with the comparative grammars there have appeared volumes of comparative Indo-European antiquarian studies.---- Some linguists, because of the very archaic character of the Lithuanian and Old Prussian languages, believed and still believe that the homelands must be in Lithuania or near it---On the other hand, the great accumulation of archaeological finds in eastern Europe and western Asia and southern Siberia, indicate movements of people from Eurasiatic steppes into Europe and Asia Minor and the assimilation or disappearance of local Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures in Europe at the end of the third and beginning of the second millennium BC. In 2300-2200 BC, the first signs of expansion of an entirely new culture from the steppe zone north of the Black Sea beyond the Volga can be traced in the Balkans, in the Aegean area and western Anatolia, and soon thereafter in central and Baltic Europe. The Kurgan Pit/grave people from the Volga and the south Siberian steppes and Kazakhstan were ceaselessly advancing westwards. They possessed vehicles-----

My question-Is German Indologist Wilhem Rau projecting the ancient European scene (a train of wagons-graama advancing) on the ancient Indian historical landscape? Second question-Were there existed Indo-Asians in the prehistory before Indo-Europeans? Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
