Dear Sirs,  
  
I cannot comment on the connection between the words Gram and Sangram. However I wonder how a sloka of the present version of Geetha can be any way related to the date of the Kurukshetra battle!  
  
If we follow such a method, Abhigyan Sakuntalam describes a lot of Mahabharat; so it should mean that King Dushyant lived some time around the time of Kalidas and the battle of Kurukshetra took place after that.  
  
Thanking you,  
  
Yours faithfully,  
  
D.D.Misra
