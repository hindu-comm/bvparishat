The suutras are not the lecture notes. They are systematically thought, classified and arranged with a particular intention to generate an example which is either from the existing literature or loka. It is a string which has long long continuity with the previous context including the MaNDuukapluti. His wonderful arrangement is seen in Puurvatraasiddhim where the relation of puurva and apara including the accent cannot be established unless it is very very seriously observed; thought , placed and expressed. Script is very well known to Panini. But it is not definite that he used the script system or not. the words lipi and libi are an evidence to it. Panini knows the relative position of paadaadi and paadamadhya particularly in the suutras like tiNatiNah. The results are very accurate particularly for goH paadaante as per the concordance of Libarsky, a complementary of Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance. Except one example, all the words occuring in the end get num. Patanjali is very write when he says that Panini puts a lot of labour to compile and classify suutras. the ledger system of Phonetians which found in the Panis of Marwar cannot be ruled out particularly the puurvatrasiddham is a unrecoverable account system. Scientific Ledger system was converted to Scientific Word system. These Phoneticans were Jains of Peshawar called Bhapa who were traders; having white dress and verygood business. Their migration to Maharashtra is visible in the expressions like " Ganapati Bappaa Maurya" Maurya was a fight community as reflected from the durgaasaptashatii. Chandragupta Mauraya belongs to the same fighting community and not son of Muraa as historians try to propound without any evidence. The cultural background of Paanini must be obserbed before coming to a conclusion. Bakhshali Manuscripts can give a clue to the solution of the problem. Request to all: to investigate the background of Acarya Panini. Regards, spnarang
