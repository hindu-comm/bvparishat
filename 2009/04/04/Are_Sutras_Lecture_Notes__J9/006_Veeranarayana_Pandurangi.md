I agree with prof. Narang. But I doubt whether panini sutrs were totally not written. प्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्याः पाणिनीयाः has come in this light. unless it is not written and taught orally, then there would have been no sangati for this vartika I think.

moreover in all sutras even shrouta etc. common featuers of sutras like paribhasa anuvrtti etc. is found. unless it is carefully authored noway can be found such system. Obscurity is partlycaused by our familiarity with the style mostly.
