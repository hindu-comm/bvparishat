We have a full tradition of the diagnosis (nidaanam) which is through many visible system of the body as homeopaths are doing and through Naadii. I know the vaidyas who have never failed in the diagnosis.The tests are not repugnant to Ayurveda tradition. They are complimentary. The main issue is the administration of the medicine. If there is a good test and no remedy is available : why to go for tests only? If medicine is available, not suits the body which is different in all the cases. That is why homeopaths are changing the medicine with small symptoms of the body. It is the art of the diagnosis and the medicine. Out sastras have such like diagnosis : may be in the form of Pitta, vaata and Kapha which are leading for the medicine. Let us take the seeds from the Sastra and go ahead for investigation. Our Rishis were doing it. Why should we stop the tradition? It should be beneficial for the poor in India and the world.
