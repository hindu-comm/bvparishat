In a few Manuscripts and printed edns the sutras are available as anunaasika. I remember the editiion of Bhimsen sastri and a number of oral discussions with him in the old days that the sutras of panini were marked nasalized which he actually did. To analyse the sutras vis a vis the verses, a detail examination is necessary. Even in the siva sutras, double N : may be one n (dental )and the other N(cerebral) which might have missed in Prakrit tradition and created a problem for sanskrit grammar. How a great grammarian like Panini found dearth of Anubandh in the Siva sutras and left his readers to interpret them? Why N used twice: consumes a lot of time for the readers of Panini grammar. Or Siva sutras were written by Saivas who less bothered about the n and N which was accepted by Panini in its known form without making the change. Investigate. It is a request for all to investigate and advise me. Regards, SP Narang
