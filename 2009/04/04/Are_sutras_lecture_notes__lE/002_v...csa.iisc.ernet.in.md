Dear Sirs

It is generally agreed that sutra is derived from the root meaning "to  
sew" and literally means a thread. More metaphorically it refers to an  
aphorism (or line, rule, formula), or a collection of such aphorisms in  
the form of a manual. The purpose looks to be for easy memorization where  
parsimony is  
the most important consideration.

They are therefore designed to be very contact almost like a 100 word  
abstract of a thesis and needed elaborate bhashyas, vartikas, etc for  
understanding and application. The doubt is whether they are produced in a  
hurry or carefully compressed for utmost brevity. The latter may be more  
true.

(In Buddhism, the term "sutra" refers generally to canonical scriptures  
that are regarded as records of the oral teachings of Gautama Buddha.  
These teachings are assembled in the second part of the Tripitaka which is  
called Sutra Pitaka. The Pali form of the word sutra is sutta, and is used  
exclusively to refer to Buddhist scriptures, particularly those of the  
Pali Canon.)
