namaste,  
  
I need not overemphasize need for sanskrit students of india keeping  
track of science research.  
  
1. one effective way is reading e abstracts of "leading science  
journals"  
  
2. one effective way of obtaining lists and website addresses of  
science research journals is searching the world wide web -  
  
3. best assistance for everything one may need is surprisingly - your  
children and their friends at home and not university staff. The child  
indeed is proven father of the man when it comes to vision and  
dexterity with the keyboard. They arouse alertness awareness and many  
times even consciousness preventing becoming early deadwood.

ORIGINS:  
On the Origin of Flowering Plants  
Elizabeth Pennisi  
Which plant was the mother of all angiosperms? In the fourth essay in  
Science's series in honor of the Year of Darwin, Elizabeth Pennisi  
discusses efforts to answer Darwin's question about how flowering  
plants diversified and spread so rapidly across the globe.

5. Caveat emptor - "buyer beware - the cave appears empty but it is  
not" - You need not impoverish yourself - your department or your  
country buying foreign "mag"s nor feel sorry about birthplaces.  
  
A quick "google" for "On the Origin of Flowering Plants Elizabeth  
Pennisi" shows up Madam Pennisi 's need not be purchased viewpoints.

7. Pennisi: Did Cooked Tubers Spur the Evolution of Big Brains? Ah  
that looks interesting - and it is "controversial" why because it is  
in "Science Magazine" but anywhere else it is "crap" and unscientific  
- not genetics - lysenkoism - what else not to who - you and not the  
western mind.  
  
What is the "veda vAkya" on plants - lo you have subject matter for a  
research paper. Need it be published in science mag - A curt note may  
be sent to the magazines worldwide that it is your copyright and  
intellectual property - and according to UN - International Treatied  
law - Traditional Indian Knowledge - besides the knowledge having  
unquivocal geographic indications.

What does Manu - MahabhArata - Bhagvad gita and rAmAyaNa have to  
say ? ... another "science paper" on the much malaligned caste system  
study - If it is ok for Cavalli whoever - to come up with "dead ends"  
by gene marker stuff it is ok for you to have a Ph.D dissertation.

Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors?  
  
Peter Frost  
  
Conclusion - None of these sciences - cognition - meditation - Neuro  
science have any quoted sanskrit literature - or the vedic quotes. -  
  
Is th world not being befooled - and our children along with it.  
  
My study with meso america and south american cultures and languages  
and plants along with PN Oak's world vedic heritage  
  
Honestly speaking in the interest of truth - "satyam" - not the one  
that makes headlines - does the Bharatiya Vidwat Parishat - I dont  
mean necessarily this small group but its broader connotation believe  
that.  
  
Very fortunately - a great blessing indeed - Bharat has the chandas  
and alive purohits, and all the varNa.  
  
I am blessed to have been gifted vAstusAra prakaraNam by Thakkura fera  
written in prAkrit. It is jain vAstu that has concepts from the  
kAtyayana shulbasUtra. I had a tongue in cheek attitude for a number  
of years on the subject of vAstu until I heard this "a rustic villager  
said - in telugu -  
  
emunnadayya - vanTa penTa kuNTha panTha cuskovAli".  
  
The essence of eco housing is just that.
