Italian earthquake: expert's warnings were dismissed as scaremongering  
An Italian scientist, Giampaolo Giuliani, predicted the earthquake  
which has killed at least 92 people in the Abruzzo region but he was  
reported to the police for scaremongering, it has emerged.

Mr Giuliani told locals to evacuate their houses and posted a video on  
YouTube in which he said a build-up of radon gas around the  
seismically active area suggested a major earthquake was imminent.  
  
Several tremors had been felt in the medieval city of L'Aquila, around  
60 miles east of Rome, from mid-January onwards, and vans with  
loudspeakers had driven around the city spreading the warning.

Earthquake in Italy But instead of heeding Mr Giuliani's warnings, the  
local authorities reported him to police for "spreading alarm" and he  
was told to remove his findings from the internet.  
  
The predicted earthquake hit L'Aquila at 3.32am local time today,  
killing at least 90 people and leaving up to 50,000 homeless.  
  
Rescuers are desperately searching through the rubble for trapped  
survivors of the 6.3 magnitude tremor, which destroyed countless  
buildings in L'Aquila and neighbouring villages.  
  
Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, has declared a state of  
emergency.  
  
In the village of Onna, around five miles from L'Aquila, at least 12  
people were killed out of a total population of 300, with police  
anticipating a rising death toll as the search of ruined buildings  
continued.  
  
A makeshift open-air morgue was set up in the shade of a tree in a  
field beside the village, with 10 bodies laid out on wooden pallets  
until undertakers could get coffins to the scene.  
  
Father Mauro Orru, the local priest in Onna, told the Telegraph: "The  
heavens fell in. It was like the end of the world. I ran into the  
street in my pyjamas; everything in the house was crashing down -  
books, crockery, everything was on the floor and the furniture was  
moving."  
  
Latest estimates suggest between 10,000 and 15,000 buildings have been  
destroyed or damaged beyond repair in the region.  
  
But the local authorities are already facing serious questions over  
why they gagged Mr Guiliani rather than taking his findings  
seriously.  
  
Italy's Civil Protection agency held a meeting of the Major Risks  
Committee, grouping scientists charged with assessing such risks, in  
L'Aquila on March 31 to reassure the townspeople.  
  
"The tremors being felt by the population are part of a typical  
sequence ... (which is) absolutely normal in a seismic area like the  
one around L'Aquila," the civil protection agency said in a statement  
on the eve of that meeting.  
  
"It is useful to underline that it is not in any way possible to  
predict an earthquake," it said, adding that the agency saw no reason  
for alarm but was nonetheless effecting "continuous monitoring and  
attention".  
  
Even after the devastating earthquake, the head of Italy's National  
Geophysics Institute, Enzo Boschi, dismissed Mr Giuliani's  
predictions.  
  
"Every time there is an earthquake there are people who claim to have  
predicted it," he said. "As far as I know nobody predicted this  
earthquake with precision. It is not possible to predict  
earthquakes."  
  
Mr Boschi said the real problem for Italy was a long-standing failure  
to take proper precautions despite a history of tragic quakes.  
  
"We have earthquakes but then we forget and do nothing. It's not in  
our culture to take precautions or build in an appropriate way in  
areas where there could be strong earthquakes," he said.  
  
Earlier, Massimo Cialente, mayor of L'Aquila, said around 100,000  
people had left their homes as a result of the damage, and Italian  
media reported that up to 50,000 people have been made homeless.  
  
He said: "The situation is terrible, really terrible. Many of my  
fellow citizens are weeping and I, too, have shed a tear."  
  
The death toll from the 'quake rose steadily during the morning as  
emergency services scrambled to pull many people trapped under  
thousands of collapsed homes and apartment blocks.  
  
Deaths were reported in L'Aquila and in the outlying towns and  
villages of Fossa, Castelnuovo, Poggio Picenze and Tormintarte. At  
least eight people are missing in nearby San Demetrio dei Vestini.  
  
Most of the damage centred on L'Aquila where homes, churches and  
university buildings had been damaged. During the 30 second tremor,  
thousands of the city's 70,000 residents ran on to the streets in  
panic.  
  
Rescue workers were trying to rescue people from collapsed homes,  
including a student dormitory where a half a dozen students remained  
trapped inside, RAI state TV reported.  
  
Television footage from the scene showed residents and rescue workers  
hauling away debris from collapsed buildings and bloodied residents  
waiting to be tended to in hospital hallways.
