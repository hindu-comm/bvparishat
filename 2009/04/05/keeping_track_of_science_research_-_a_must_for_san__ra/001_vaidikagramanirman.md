is a must for scientific researchers and veda / sanskrit students -  
seemingly innocuous Indo-whoever-whatever deals results in denying  
future  
  
take the case of IARI and ICRISAT - way back in the 70s was known that  
India had the largest germplasm collections of pulses - What is its  
status now? and where is it? On same account is the sorghums, bajra,  
millets the subject matter of semi arid tropics - as policy was  
anything India centric. Tough luck the scientists did not have a clue  
from sanskrit pandits on the veda vAkya. Nor vice versa the Indian  
scientists - In the process from "science point" weird AIT theories  
arise that belie the fact that "veda vAkya is truth and the rest are  
seekers"
