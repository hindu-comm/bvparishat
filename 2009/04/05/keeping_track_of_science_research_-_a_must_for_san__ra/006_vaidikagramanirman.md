GEOCHEMISTRY:  
Great Oxidation Event Dethroned?  
Richard A. Kerr  
New laboratory results reported on page 370 of this week's issue of  
Science challenge the view that the atmosphere of early Earth was  
devoid of oxygen by showing how supposed signs of an early lack of  
oxygen could have come from unrelated geochemical reactions.

EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION:  
After the Quake, in Search of the Science--or Even a Good Prediction  
Richard A. Kerr  
Did technician Gioacchino Giuliani successfully predict last week's  
quake that crumbled buildings in the Italian city of L'Aquila, killing

CLIMATE CHANGE:  
New Push Focuses on Quick Ways to Curb Global Warming  
Eli Kintisch  
Reducing emissions of black carbon and other short-lived pollutants  
that contribute to global warming could buy the world crucial time  
while governments begin the slow overhaul of global energy systems  
that will be required to reduce emissions of CO2, climate modelers  
reported last week in Nature Geosciences.

Jeffrey Mervis  
In one of his first interviews since his Senate confirmation 19 March,  
presidential science adviser John Holdren told Science last week that
