namaste,  
  
My lifetime companions are  
  
1. "what to do"  
2. "how to do"  
  
1. For many years without knowing "what to do" - I appointed myself  
the world's best expert on "how to do" on anything and everything  
ranging from running the parliment or running the universe to fixing  
washing machines by qulified technicians.  
  
also true is  
  
2. For many years without knowing "how to do" - I appointed myself the

technicians.  
  
Very strangely, a turning point in perspective came when with a foggy  
mind I gave my CV to a swami at a "business centre" in a controversial  
spiritual place. The swami said not in these words exactly, "...  
great! you are good at doing what others tell when are you going to do  
what you like". And for this no gurus are required. All "prasAd",  
gifts of gurus and even daiva - chew and eat I must. Nobody, no thing  
can do it for me.  
  
  
"keeping track of science research - a must for sanskrit students"  
surprisingly is a subject that has the base "when are you going to do  
what you like".  
  
None of the following are needs and essentials but could be  
"dispensible" facilitators.  
  
1. "science wings" in sanskrit departments - started with no external  
assistance. This may be even in the mind with no infrastructure at all  
- Example Maths wing - sanskrit department - Physics wing sanskrit  
Dept. Biology wing - sanskrit dept. Geology wing Sanskrit Dept.  
Economics wing - Sanskrit. (In fact the wings could be each and every  
dept of the university)  
  
2. "Chew and eat I must. Nobody, no thing can do it for me".  
  
A very brief look at all departments in universities or even all Nobel  
laureates of world reveals that they do not "have wings or horns on  
their heads" - They are human. And as such - any appreciation -  
benefits acclaim they get is for their "work" and not their  
prsonality.  
  
3. Inviting others - so called "scientists" to do the work of the  
sanskrit department could be inviting disaster before start. The only  
indispensible "specialization" needed is "generalization"  
  
para - pashyanthi - mAdhyama - vAk is the order I have understand. So  
applied to sanskrit per se it is mAdhyama (the means) and vAk. But is  
it all? From the dissectionists and locked in view they are. But from  
the free sanskrit - winged view these are two discernible portions of  
the continuum of processes of the beautiful universe. It is no wonder  
that sanskrit records and the veda starts with "sanAtana dharma" - the  
eternal dharma - j\~jAna and vij\~jAna actually dont care whether you  
classify it this way or that way.
