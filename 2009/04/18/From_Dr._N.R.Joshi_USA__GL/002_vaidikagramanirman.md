namaste sir,  

  
"My research shows that all nations described in Mahabharat do not fit  
into the geography of Indian subcontinent."  
  

I whole heartedly can agree - but on this  

  
"As a matter of fact main parites in the war-Sindhudesha, Sauveera,  

Shibi desha, Gaandhara were in the land of present Pakistan..."  
  
and trying to fit any taught geography and taught taught history is  
fraught with argumentative dead ends.  
  
1. Mahabharata is in treta yuga - period - How many years back that  
translates to is not what I have been led to believe.  
  
2. Dating the war - astro methods and "computer simulations" etc.  
comes up with a few thousand years back. And oft quoted is NASA  
software and other software models. Using the software and going back  
in time they come up with 3000 odd BC etc. OK that was the first  
backward occurence. For scientific curiosity sake can you run the  
simulation for the next backwards in time occurence. And I have  
received weird looks about difficulty and even impossibility for such  
simulation due to "wobble" of the solar system. I for one refuse to  
believe any software than can go back condescendingly 8000 years but  
cannot go back to 80000 years.  
  
3. "what if" the yuga yardstick were adopted - everything would fit in  
geologically. Just because some Leaky said Ramapithecus - was the  
origin of modern Mankind and hence Mahabharatha was mythology doesn't  
make it so.  
  
4. PN Oak's World Vedic Heritage is good reading to develop an open  
mind and "scientific" compared to "taliban" websites.
