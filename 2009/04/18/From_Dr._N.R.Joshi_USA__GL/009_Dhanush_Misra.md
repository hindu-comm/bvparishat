***Dear Shri Joshi,***

***As far as I know there are no cut and dried answers to most of the questions on Indian scriptures. I was told bya spiritual teacher that according to the Indian scriptures there are 8.4 million zonis, i.e. types of species in which one can be born depending on the Papa and Punya he/she has accumulated. Thus there are 8.4 million types of hell.***

***Modern biology tells us that there are about 9 million species.***

***Thus pemanent escape from the cycle of rebirth is the only permanent escape from hell.***

***Yours truly,***

***D.D.Misra***
