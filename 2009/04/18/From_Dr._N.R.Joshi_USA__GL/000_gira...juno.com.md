Respected Scholars, Namaste!

This posting is connection with Prof Narang's postingabout Pakistani website describing history of Kamboja. Kuru and Kamboja is the main dynasty in the epic Mahabharat. My research shows that all nations described in Mahabharat do not fit into the geography of Indian subcontinent. As a matter of fact main parites in the war-Sindhudesha, Sauveera, Shibi desha, Gaandhara were in the land of present Pakistan. Kurus and Kamboja further west of Pakistan, Valhika (or Vahilka-I get always confused with this spelling) was called in the known history Bactria-north of present Afghanistan, Madra further north-east and Shaakal further north-east. However during British rule of India, efforts were made to fit all Mahabharat in the area of northern India. I have gone into the ancient history of ancient nations of Asia and Europe. My research is written in the book form. I did not get the time to publish book yet. Dr. BVK Sastry (at present in Bangalor)is familiar with my research. From Indian point of view, the ancient history of Middle-east is very shocking.All of them were involved in Mahabharat war.In the known history there was Persian empire from Egypt to Sindhu river. My experience shows that many from India are not familiar with Persian history and Parthian history of known period although similarities in Avesta and Vedasare known to many scholars.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
