Respected Scholars, Namaste!



Thank you Dr. Varakhedi. I will be glad to present my information on Mahabharat history. I would like to stress here that my information about the ancient history of Mahabharat is not from Pakistan websites. Please understand that Taliban s ancient history prior to Islam (prior to 700 AD). I am gathering information from past thirty years. 

Next in reference to mention of late P. N. Oak by Vaidikagramnirman. I have read some publications of Shree Oak. I respect him for collection of information from different parts of India in the known history of Mogul rule of India. However Sanskritization of names of countries and people from outside of India by Oak broke all rules of linguistic changes which (such as Grimm’s rule) are learnt in the first book on linguistics. He used phonetic similitude to convert non-sanskrit words into Sanskrit words. Phonetic similitude is great for many unaware of regular sound changes from one language to other. I feel uneasy to add that P. N. Oak has given bad name to other sincere Indian scholars outside of India. Now-a-days “Oakish etymology’ has become a ridiculous term even for other sincere scholars who would like to oppose western thoughts. Western scholars use ignorance of linguistics of Indians as their strong tool for attacking Indian scholars. On this background, in my opinion it is wise to read Oak’s books but do not use it.

The names of Persian emperors are carved in inscriptions in Iranian mountains.They are related to Mahabharat people.

Thanks. N. R.Joshi.
