Respected Sirs,

Mr.P.N.Oak was not a child in linguistics.

**"Western scholars use ignorance of linguistics of Indians as their  
strong tool for attacking Indian scholars."**

He has shown the lacuna of English and other European Languages from the viewpoint of linguistics. But the western scholars - knowingly or unknowingly - are prone to ignore and neglect these types of materials.

Is it necessary to give much importance to this matter?
