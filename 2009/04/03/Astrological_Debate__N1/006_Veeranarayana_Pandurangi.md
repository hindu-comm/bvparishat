Dear all scholars,

I extend my Belated greetings of Raamanavami to all the members.



Iknowall the respective members are highly scholastic and know their limits and responsibilities. Iam happy to seeall these kinds of scholarly debates inbvp.



Ialso understand that neither Prof. Sadashivamurty nor Prof. Bhattacharya are contesting any personal thing. Both arerespected scholars and have contributed to shastras in theirrespective domains.**I do not thinkanybody is contesting the academicscredibilitiesof other scholar. **



As everybody knows therecan beno final decission in any matter. debates are eternal. There is no end to it. debates should continue for ever. But sometime there may be communication gap caused by some small matters. I sincerely request to all the members that these debates should notbe takentopersonaldebates.



I think this debate should not ruin this wonderfull form of purely academic discussions.

thanks to all for creating this good oportunity to see an open discussion of this kind what we all desired for long.
