Dear respected scholars, Namaste!

In Beal's book in Chaper 3, "Hindu ideas on Acoustics" it was mentioned that Upavars'AcArya was teacher of Panini. Is this true? Upavars'AcArya rejected Sphota doctrine in favor of VarNas. Both Aadya ShankarAcArya and Shabara favored him. It this true? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
