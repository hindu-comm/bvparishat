Dear Vishu: The paper Asva I mentioned was published long back when there was no concept of soft or hard computer copy. My paper Leeches was in my Pondicherry computer but i have got only printout. For the time being I cannot scan and send. It was read at Banglore: Vedic Science Conference. I think i will have to prepare the electronic version for submission onwards. Best wishes, You can see: PAIOC:

On the word Asva in the Rgveda. PAIOC, 1982, pp.215-221&  

Rgveda men asva-sabda para vicara: ( Hindi version) Sodha Prabha, Delhi Best wishes, spnarang
