Dear Scholars,  
  
I have a question: Has anyone made an attempt to collect all references to animals and particularly animal behavior in our shastras. I do research on that topic and more specifically on various patterns that animals form (like schools of fish, flocks of birds, etc (see some pictures here:  
<http://images.google.com/images?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&q=school+of+fish&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=TDnfSeSeKqbNlQebtOnfDg&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&resnum=1&ct=title> )  
  
We try to understand why they do that and how they do that. I will be very interested in knowing more about this. Even if there is no one collection, if you can point out specific references known to you, that will also be very useful. I wanted to find out answer to this question for a long time and I think this is the most appropriate forum since there is lot of interest in reaching out to scientific community on the vast knowledge that our shastras contain.  
  
thanks,  
Vishwesha
