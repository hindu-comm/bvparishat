One study that needs to be done is to compare the Hittite horse-  
training manual with such Sanskrit texts, particularly those relating  
to horses. As you may be aware, the Hittites are considered the first  
civilization to have domesticated and trained horses, but a scholar  
who has studied the Hittite language and its manual once told me that  
it is incongruous that some of the horse-training methods in the  
Hittite manual are given Sanskrit names (loan-words), suggesting that  
these were actually imported techniques.

If Dr. Joshi or others have not already done this type of comparative  
study, it would be a good thesis topic for some research student.
