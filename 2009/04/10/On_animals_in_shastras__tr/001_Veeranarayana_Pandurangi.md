Dr. Sandip joshi (JRRSU jaipur 0992843950) worked on this in his ph.d. zoological aspects in samskit literature. He has also publihed Ashvashastra recently. you can call him.

There are many works in samskrit such मृगपक्षिशास्त्र, अश्वशास्त्र, गजशास्त्र, श्यैनिकशास्त्र (Bikaner ms) etc. which have detailed study of animal behavior. अयमेव न्यायः सामुद्रिकायुर्वेदवास्तुविद्यानीतिशास्त्र-**अहिवृश्चिकविद्या-शालिहोत्र-हस्तिशिक्षा**-सूपशास्त्रादौ द्रष्टव्यः (मीमांसाकौस्तुभ1.3.2).

Myown experience from helping sandip joshi is that people like shalihotra (author of Ashvashastra) were real scientists. Like we read and write on Nyaya, they worked whole life accompaning horses literally. He even said to be happy with sounds ofhorses and spent whole life with horses in the himalaya.



**there are many such shastras of practicaluse. and peolelikeshalihotra worked on them. they never felt shy for them. But it is sad that moment these people died then indian science ceased to develop.**



पालकाप्यs hastividya is famous work recently published



**following are the some details from recent discussion on** गजशास्त्र **from indology list**
