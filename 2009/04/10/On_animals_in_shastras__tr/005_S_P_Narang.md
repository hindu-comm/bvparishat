There are so many works on the animals: Ramadatta Sharma, Haridatta, Bengali works, Sushma Kulashreshtha, SP Narang: Kalidasa Bibliography: details references particularly Campaklal Gupta and his identity of the animals. Details may be checked out. My paper; Leeches in the Rgveda may be interesting for the earliest phase of investigation and utility. the animals like Sharabh must be identified. Ashvins and Ashva also belong to the same category. ( See: Narang, SP: Asva in the Rgveda. Proceedings: AIOC. Jaipur session ) The list may be consolidated at one place. Regards, SP Narang
