Respected Sir,

**the inscription may insist the pseudo secular historians to change the history, though they will not and will definitely try to make out some new fraud theory.**

But it is necessary for Indian history.

I wonder how this can be unravelled till date. Doesn't it show the negligence of the so-called historians.

I support your view on the subject and agree with you that we need to do much homework. That's what I have told in my last post also.

Regards
