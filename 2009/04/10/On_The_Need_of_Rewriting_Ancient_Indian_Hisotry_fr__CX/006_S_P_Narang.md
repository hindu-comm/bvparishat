Dear Dhanush Misra, thanks for the paper. It is historical patch on the basis of a few Puranas. Different scholars should explore the history and change their vision to critical chronology consolidated. Agamas are also interesting source for the history. durgasaptsati is a regular history where a lady fought at Kamboj and her regular enemies had been Sumbha, Nishumbha, Ciksura,( chinese), Bidalaksh ( Afghan) and dhuumraaksha (Greeks). A few facts are corroborated by Niilamata Puraana and chinese chronicles preserved in historical forms in Journal: Proceedings of Toyo Bunko. I have taken huge number of notes but i do not find to put them in regular paper forms without a help. durgasaptasati mentions Mauryas which was a strong Ksatriya tribe to fight against durga along with other tribes mentioned there. Kola, ( modern Kohli). He is the founder of the Maurya dynasty and its no relation to Muraa daasii. Investigate. Regards, SP Narang
