At the first step: the material not used for history from any source should be collected.Let the scholars give the information of their source along with the hints of the history: annals, dynasty, local kings not known; their contribution to the history or cultural history of any part of India; their main enemies, dates of the events, if got from the chronograms, or hidden lines etc. for final consolidation slowly at various centres and persons. Let the scholars contribute slowly with caption. Regards, SP Narang
