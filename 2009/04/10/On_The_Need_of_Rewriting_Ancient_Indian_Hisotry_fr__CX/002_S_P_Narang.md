Indian history has black gaps which must be fulfilled on the original sources particularly the Puranas which the Western or our historians have not done it or misrepresented the facts. Duff: Chronology of India shows the gap between 3000 BC to alexander. Where is the history of 2500 years? Did we not exist? It must be done on the basis of the epics and Puranas, Brahmanas, living literary sources of India, Tibet, China and tribal folk traditions. We will find the intersting results. All the scholars should contribute the patches and it should be consolidated through this Parisad. It may bring excellent results and deliberate attempts to conceal our history. Regards,
