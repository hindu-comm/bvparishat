Dear Sri Sadasiva Murty-garu

Your thoughts on ancient history of India are worth pursuing.India  
is the only large country in the world with millennia of ancient  
culture and history behind it and its history was misrepresented by  
foreigners often with biased opinions because of continuous invasions  
and subjugation for over thousand years. Even after sixty years of  
independence the govt. patronized historians of India continued the  
agenda with a vengence. There has been considerable effort by nationalist  
historians in the last hundred years.  
I attach some references in my attached wih this. There are two steps  
- Building literature on true history  
- Challenging the establishments such as ICHR and Ministry of HR to  
introduce these in the history text books and official websites.  
- I have always wondered how countries such as Pakistan, Bangaladesh  
present our common ancient history to bend to their current political  
status to convince their school students of their version of history.

Regards,  
VVS Sarma
