Sometimes Pakistani websites are trying to restore the common heritage of undivided India. See: Website for Kamboj which is very very long investigation and less known to Sanskrit pandits. It is based on Sanskrit, Kashmiri, Iranian and other sources. it was a country of Vedic recension mentioned in Nirukta, Patanjali and a few Brahmins. I think historians should be different from politicians and their investigation should be based only on history. regards, spnarang
