Respected Sirs,

till now we are not ready to accept our own history. Even we have more faith on the blind scientifical studies rather than our scriptures (I mean it BLIND SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS). SCIENTIFICALLY WE DON'T ACCEPT VYASA, ASVATTHAMA AND HANUMAN ARE TILL ALIVE. It may take time to get out of this bias of western system of scientific study. (I don't think science is useless or fake. I just can't support the system they adopt. Vasudev Poddar, A Veteran scholar has written a book KAALAYAATRAA. He has pointed out some points where this materialistic view fails and get no way to proceed further.) So I think we must first have Shhraddha on our own scriptures. Anybody can mark it as **blind faith - BUT FAITH IS ALWAYS BLIND, THATS WHY IT IS FAITH.** That is my view on this point.



The history of India of the mediaval era has been reconstructed by Dowson, P.N.Oak, S.Lal etc. But unfortunately in the period of over 1000 years we have lost a lot of source of our history ofancient time. That is the gap marked by Prof.Narang. It must be revealed.
