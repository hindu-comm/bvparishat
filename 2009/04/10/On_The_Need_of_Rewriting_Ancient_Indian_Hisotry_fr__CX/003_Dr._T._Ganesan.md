\>Yes. Certainly our Bharatiya History should be rewritten by our own scholars  
consisting of sanskrit pandits and epigraphists.  
The Bharatiyavidyabhavan effort is highly laudable but I doubt they consulted  
the purana-s.  
But, how to make these "europen-american-slave historians' of our country to  
understand the greatnes and value of the purana-s and other records ? As of  
today many of us know well that most of these 'slave istorians' are under the  
spell and grip of Marxism, fully influenced by missionaries from within and  
overseas.  
Jai Hind !
