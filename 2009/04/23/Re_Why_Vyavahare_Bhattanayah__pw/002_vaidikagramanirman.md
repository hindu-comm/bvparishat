namaste,

  
"Shankara considers veda as paurusheya"

Everybody has a key - the problem is to find the lock that it would  
fit in rather vice versa for the specific case of the veda. sha\~gkara  
is definitely the last I would consult on the "veda". I am learning  
sanskrit and I dont want him to "bhaja govindam bhaja govindam muDha  
mate"ing me. That is extremely rude and uncultured from a young  
person.

regards
