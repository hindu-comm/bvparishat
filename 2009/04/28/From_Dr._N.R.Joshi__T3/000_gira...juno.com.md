Subject: Contoversy on Indus civilization signs-linguistic or non-linguistic. In the posting of Dr. Pandurangi, at the bottom, Dr. Witzel remarked that archaeologistM. Kenoyer is earth digger and not linguists. This clearly tells us that an expert in linguistics can only talk to another expert in linguistics in their own terminology. One cannot deny the branch of science called linguistics. Western linguistics came of age only after discovery of Sanskrit by British scholars in India in the past centuries. They developed their phonetics using Sanskrit phonetic treatises like Panini Shiksha, Vyaasa Shikshaa etc. They developed comparative philology and they use that as weapon to put down "Oakish etymology" . Understand that Oak may be a patriotic person but patriotism is not substitute for scholarship and scholarly research.Linguistics have many branches. One need not go into details here.I am giving here simple examples.In going from one language to another sound changes take place with certain rules. Like Sindhu becomes Hindu in Persian or Sanskrit Vijaya first becomes Piroja and then changes into Firoja in Persian. Within India Sanskrit Varshaa becomes Baarish in Hindi but becomes Paausa in Marathi. Did you see change of "v" into "p"? If there are Tamil scholars on this list, they can help us. Sanskrit Kaavyam became Kaapyam (or vice versa) in Tamil Tolkapyam. Shreepati becomes Tirupathi. Shikhi (peacock) becomes Tukhi (imported by king Soloman from south India around 1000 BC). Kathaa (story) becomes Kadhaai.(Tamil scholars, please correct me if Iwere wrong).In all these examples there is systematic change of sounds. The same thing happens between Sanskrit "Ashva" (horse) and Latin eqqus. This is not difficult to learn. But it is a separate subject. Without knowing these rules, patriotic person from India (proud of Sanskrit language) ventures into unknown field and attempts Sanskritization simply based on phonetic similitude.This is what P.N.Oak did in converting Christanity into Krishneeti.(Please understand that I respect him for gathering historical information). Many efforts were made in India in 20th century to develop technical terminology in Sanskrit for English technical terms.Nobody used them because they were either literal tranlations or funny or even kinky. Patanjal said long ago please create Anvarthaka Sanjnyaa even if it is long.Please pardon me for long e-mail. More on Technical Sanskrit later on. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
