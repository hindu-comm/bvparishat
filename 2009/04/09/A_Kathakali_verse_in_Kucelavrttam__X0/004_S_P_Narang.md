Prof. Rajendran, kanac is used in the sense of present indicative with the formation of past perfect. Washing from nij root is got. . it is just like the tasthivaamsam etc. which is injuncted in continuity with kvasushca.. In fact it is the old form of Past perfect which was used in the Vedic language. The stem is that of past perfect or intensive and the suffix is present participle. Regards, spnarang
