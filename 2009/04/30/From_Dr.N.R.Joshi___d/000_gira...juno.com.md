Sanskritization versus knowledge of Linguistics by N. R. Joshi



Please understand that almost all European countries have departments on Indology. In addition USA, Canada, Australia and perhaps even New Zealand have departments on Indology. The major players outside of India are England, France, Germany and USA. They together spent conservatively 50 million dollars each year on the study of India. The study includes Sanskrit, archaeology, Dravidian languages of India. This study is going on past 150 years. Before discovery of Sanskrit by Europeans 200 years ago, European linguists were trying to derive words from their languages from Hebrew, language of Bible. In these efforts they have to take such a great liberty that whole science of etymology became a big joke in Europe. However picture suddenly changed after light of Sanskrit. Europeans now made rapid progress in linguistics and now they can use it as weapon to put down others. A person knowing Sanskrit from India sees similarity between Maatri and mother, Pitri and father. There is no direct connection between English and Sanskrit. There is Indo-European group of languages. A person unaware of this tries to do direct Sanskritization of foreign words and becomes subject of ridicule. Not only that there is strong reaction within India as can be seen from the book, **“Pali is the Mother of Sanskrit”** by HaBir Angar Ee from Maharashtra. He is carbon copy of late P. N. Oak. He did not have elementary knowledge of linguistics and hence gets funny conclusions based on phonetic similitude with political overtones. One cannot take Panini’s Dhaatupaatha and try to investigate other languages. In case of Indus script and Indus seals, 4000 of them are in private collection outside of India. The whole world has hand in everything from ancient India. Thousands of artifacts unearthed in Middle-east and India find places in foreign museums. Rare books from ancient India are in locked sections of foreign libraries. Novice Indians repeatedly make mistakes in connecting Sumerian to Sumeru. They fail to recognize that Sumerian was not the name of ancient Sumerians. The same thing is true for Maayaa civilization of Central America. Maayaa is not their true name. It was given to them by foreign writers. Linguistics is an interesting subject. India is very fertile ground for study of linguistics because her multitude of languages. In my opinion it is necessary to avoid pitfalls in research. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
