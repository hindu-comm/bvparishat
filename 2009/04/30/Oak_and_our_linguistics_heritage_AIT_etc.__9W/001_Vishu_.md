Namaskara everyone,  
  
This is a very interesting debate. I understand from this and earlier debates that Indian scholars in general seem to disagree with conclusions based on (european) linguistics/archeology such as Aryan Migration Theory that is claimed to have taken place some 3000-4000 yrs ago. Genetic analysis as of now do not have sufficient resolution to say what happened on this time scale of 3000-5000 yrs. But I have a question based on genetics which tell things clearly on longer times such as 25,000 to 100,000 yrs.  
  
What is known from those studies is that all humans today originate from migrations out of Africa beginning 50,000 yrs back or so. First human settlement in India happened only around 40,000 yrs back (those genetic markers found in certain south Indian populations) and there were various migrations into India (and rest of the world) from Central Asia and middle east in the period 25,000 to 5,000 yrs back (found in north Indian populations). Human languages also have evolved along with these migrations and therefore studying languages can tell us about migrations. Western linguists claim that their predictions of migrations is roughly in agreement with those of conclusions based on genetic tests.  
  
I am interested in understanding these issues in light of counterarguments from Indian scholars and here are some of my questions:  
  
What is the view of Indian scholars on these broad facts of human migrations?  
  
Where exactly do Indian scholars begin to deviate from western scholars and more specifically western indologists here? On what time scale and at what level of detail?  
  
More specifically, do we discard the whole theory of human evolution and migrations OR do we accept the theory of migrations out of Afirca into India (and rest of the world) beginning some 50,000 yrs back, but are only saying that Indo-European languages originated in India after humans came to India and then spread those back to central asia and Europe?  
  
I look forward to responses to these queries.  
  
many thanks,  
Vishwesha
