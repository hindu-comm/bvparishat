thanks for NR Joshi for his interesting mail.

  

what I would like to say is that we(Oak etc.)are not as fools as it seems through american spectacle. what is still unfinished is the task of inventing the new linguistics based on indian model. Grims law etc. is hatchwork of european conspirators. This confusion is all caused by theeuropeanlinguistics.

  

if we want to accept theeuropeanlinguistics (IndoEuropean language theory) we have to accept the (AIT) aryan invasion theory. these two are interconnected. unless aryan invasion theory is proved this kind of grims law etc. will not be acceptable.aryan invasion is clearly ridiculous becuase

  

1\. even manu ect. who are not hindu chuvanists like us (as one deem) say clearly that these were the natives of india and went abroad and became vrshala gradually.  

  

शनकैस्तु क्रियालोपात् इमाः क्षत्रियजातयः।

वृषलत्वं गता लोके ब्राह्मणादर्शनेन च।

पौण्ड्रकाश्चौड्रद्रविडाः कम्बोजा यवनाः शकाः।

पारदाः पाह्लवाश्चीनाः किराताः दरदाः खशाः (मनु 10.43-44)

all these kshatriyas likepoundrakas, odras, dravidas, kambojas, yavanas, shakas, paradas, pahlavas, cheenas, kiratas, daradas, and khashasbecame vrshalas gradually because inaction (kriyalopa)andof lack of brahmins there (in these countries).

This means even the last king of Iran Reza shah pahlavi (may be remembered for his grand coronation sometimes in 1960s) belonged to the same race.

These clans were extradited out of india by sagara what we know from some puranas (dont know exactly)

  

  

2\. how then one explain the agnipuja of parsis, great similarity between vedas andavesta? in the aftermath of invasion of iran by islamists why did these people come to india? if there was no connection between indian and parsis. why they did not go to england or germany?

  

3\. why did syrian chistians in early CE came to india? why did the jews came here?

  

4\. even the jaimini and shabara in the sutra 1.3.10 चोदितं तु प्रतीयेताविरोधात् प्रमाणेन etc. (पिकनेमाधिकरण ) says that words like pika, nema, sata, taamarasa, should be taken in the sense that is used by mleacchas (and not by aaryas) because that is found in the shastras.similarly shabara says inआर्यप्रसिद्ध्यधिकरण 1.3.8yava, vetasa, varaaha etc. should mean the diirghashuuka etc. which are used by aaryas and not mlecchas.

this means that even thevedicwords like "pika" used by mlecchas in the sense of kokila (but not used by aaryas in that sense) mean the kokila which is the correct meaning of that word. it is the indication of usage of vedic language by mlecchas such as पारसीक-बर्बर-यवन-रौमक (kumarila on1.3.10) atleast partially.

the point of shabara inआर्यप्रसिद्ध्यधिकरण 1.3.8 is that mlecchas are not very much interested in preserving the language as aaryas were. hence we can not depend upon them unless it is not contradictory to what is found in vedas.

he says 1.3.10 (in purvapaksha)

कथं वेदगतैः शब्दैः म्लेच्छस्थोर्थः प्रतीयते।

येषां दर्शनमात्रेपि वेद एव न पठ्यते।

संभाषापि च न म्लेच्छैः सहार्यावर्तवासिनाम्।। 470-----------------

धर्मे चानादरात्तेषां भ्रश्येतार्थोपि शब्दवत्।

न चास्ति संस्कृतः शब्दः कश्चिन्म्लेच्छापभाषणे।। 478

संस्कृतप्रतिरूपा हि तद्भाषार्थान्तरे स्थिता।

न चावाचकरूपाणां वाचकत्वं कथंचन।। 479

तद्यदा द्राविडादिभाषायामीदृशी स्वच्छन्दकल्पना, तदापारसीक-बर्बर-यवन-रौमकादिभाषासु किं विकल्प्य किं प्रतिपत्स्यन्ते इति न विद्मः।

  

5\. what about matr = mother, pitr= father, svasaa= sister, dve= two, tri= three, etc. september, october, november, december.  

how it is possible to make more similar words without the patronage of samskrita? one may make one thousand rules to justify what he has said or want to achieve. but the obvious modification of words from the time of rgveda etc. (if it is timed) strikes at sight.

  

6.remember MB शवतिर्गतिकर्मा कम्बोजेषु पठ्यते what if samskrita language is not used in kamboja as held by AIT. it is clear that this same language samskrita was the language of these countries wherever these kshatriyas lived.

  

all these facts indicate that samskrita was the language of greater asia and some parts of europe and not that all these aaryas came from asia minor as speculated by maxmullarists.

  

Further I call all the scientists to check this theory through DNA analysis etc. which may prove AIT false.

  

hence we have to think from our lence and not always american lence.

  

A person knowing Sanskrit fromIndiasees similarity between Maatri and mother, Pitri and father. There is no direct connection between English and Sanskrit. There is Indo-European group of languages. A person unaware of this tries to do direct Sanskritization of foreign words and becomes subject of ridicule.  

  

need not be necessarily ridiculed. we will come back new rules against these things.

  

It is also Highly important thing to note that in next 100 years or so there will be european indology it will be closed at least in universities. the very purpose of opening the indology depts in europe was the colonially fuelled. and once the purpose is achieved or no more achievable in the changed context of global affairs, no more they need the indology. to quote a french indologist"Our current "président de la république" has for instance publicly declared that he did not see the need for the state to finance the study of 17th century French literature because it was now irrelevant."

  

recent reports of closing the indology in cambridge and others like belin etc. is the tip of iceberg.

howeverthere can be american indology because substantial indian population there.

  

we have to think.
