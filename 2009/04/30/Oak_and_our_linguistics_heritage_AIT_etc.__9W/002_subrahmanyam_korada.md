I fully endorse the views of the Indian scholars regarding the concepts of Aryas and Linguistics.

The entry in Oxford Dic. , i.e. aryan, as a Sanskrit word is wrong. It is - r = gatau, and nyat-protyaya

by rhalornyat (Panini 3-1-124) = aryah.



It is a fact that both, the term 'Arya', which is pregnant

with meaning and the 'Svastika' were borrowed from

Mahabhasya of Patanjali, i.e. prsodaradini yathopadistam (Pan 6-3-109) and Paspasahnika, respectively, by the author of the infamous work

of hatred, viz.Mein Kampf (My Struggle), i.e. Adolf

Hitler, and were abused.



In Humboldt's work,i.e.The Language (Eng Transl of

the German original) we come across translations of

paragraphs of Mahabhasya.

I have recently published a book (Flier attached),viz

Theories of Language : Oriental and Occidental,

which is a nutshell of Ancient Indian (Vyakarana,

Nyaya, Mimamsa, Vedanta, Yoga, Samkhya, Vaisesika, Alamkara, Ayurveda and Arthasastra)

Theories of Language and Modern Linguistic Theories

(right from Humboldt to Chomsky et al) that deals

with the concepts right from Varna(Phoneme) down

to Mahavakya(Discourse). This is first of its kind.

I have compared both the Theories (in fact that of

the Western Scholars are Hypotheses rather than

Theories=Siddhantas) and proved that Oriental

rather than Occidental Theories stand/stood the test

of the time.

It may be amazing that not a single Western Linguist

(Copies were sent to America, Canada and Britain)

did/could review the book for the last eight months.



As far as the question of Migration is concerned, no

doubt , it has been there. Scholars from the then Persia had introduced words like Anapha, Sunapha,

Duradhura (Yogas) in Jyotisasastra also ( mleccha hi

yavanastesu sastram supratisthitam). Rather , it is

difficult to fathom into thousands of years and find

out as to who when where migrated. Indian scholars

can depend upon the available literature such as

Mahabhasyam, Manusmrti, Mahabharata, Puranas

etc. . However, it is dificult to offer a satisfactory

response in this regard even for the westerners. We simply cannot trust them as their books vouch.



We have Vedas, Vedangas etc. authored by Rsis

who had had Yogipratyaksa. According to them

Aryas were / have been the indigenous people of India. We used to address our father 'arya(ayya)

and even today my daughter calls me Aryasree.This

is just to exhibit the uninterrupted tradition rather than

glory.

The above book was published and printed by DK
