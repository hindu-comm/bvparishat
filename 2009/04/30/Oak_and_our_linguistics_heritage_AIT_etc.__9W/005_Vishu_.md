Namaskara Pandurangiji,  
  
Here is the wikipedia link. It may not be fully accurate or very updated with latest research results, but nevertheless gives a good starting point. As it stands today, Out of africa origin of humans is very well accepted and is corroborated by independent evidences from both maternal as well as paternal genetic lineages (apart from fossil and archealogical evidences).

There is also this three hour video (from National Geographic, I believe) uploaded on youtube into some 18 parts. Its some years old and some of the details he says may have changed, but the picture he presents largely holds.
