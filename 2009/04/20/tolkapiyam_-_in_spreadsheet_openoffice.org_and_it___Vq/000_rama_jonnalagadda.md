namaste,



Indian discovery of itself has often been through the mirror of the western world.



Aryan - Dravidian divide has been on for many years with claim of sanskrit - and Tamizh. - I have been studying the maya of meso and south america prompted by PN Oak. Studying the mayan language was simple 'dejavu' and familar language structure once the "romanized alphabets" were arranged barakhadi style - lo it started making a lot more sense - the verb forms of the quiche maya and cakchiquels were compared with dhatupatha and roughly 40% concordance seen. because I am no sanskrit pandit. But there a number of words sounding telugu like too - Now I am seeing tolkapiyam



I am pleased to share Project Madurai's tolkappiyam that I have put in spread sheet - [openoffice.org](http://openoffice.org) format - this has filter and sort facillities that I find very convenient - it can also be pdfed easily,



Reading learned members developing English Sanskrit Computer dictionary and comments prompted me to attach a small writeup on the "dharmik overview of IT" that may be interesting.



The most fundamental I believe is in the viewpoint of j\~jAnendriya - and computer as extension - where our scriptural material can most contribute. "what to do" is there in the veda and shastra - and technology is "how to do". I believe our people have great contributions for "what to do" in the not too distant future. They have been experts at "how to"
