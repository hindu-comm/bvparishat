Sanskrit Dictionary for computers is probably a first efforts of its  
kind. In this dictionary nearly 2000 words related to computers are  
given with their equivalent words in Sanskrit.Sanskrit has a special  
capacity to provide room for creation and coining new technical words  
required for all sciences basing on its roots and on the sound base of  
grammar. This capacity of Sanskrit has been tested many times for  
coining of new technical terms. In fact not only Indian languages, but  
also English and other languages borrow Sanskrit roots for generation  
of new technical words. It is again high time to prove the power of  
Sanskrit language by creating literature in Sanskrit about computers.  
  
This dictionary is published for the first time by Sanskrit Academy,  
Hyd for testing purpose. The Pdf is made available free for  
researchers. Your feedback is valuable for us.
