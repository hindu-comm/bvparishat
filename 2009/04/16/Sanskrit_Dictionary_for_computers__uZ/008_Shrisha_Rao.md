Thanks for your kind words. As for this:

No real argument, of course. Sanskrit is not just a language, but  
also a gateway to express a lot of deeper content. This of course is  
quite unique among languages.

Perhaps you are right and there is a failure of imagination on my  
part, but I would courteously differ, though only in the sense that I  
would regard Sanskritists as being under no obligation to accept  
challenges from misinformed or ill-motivated people. Description of  
languages as dead or living (or "classical," in our country) is done,  
alas, largely to serve political or parochial agendas. Even  
definitions of "living" languages as those with a certain number of  
living native speakers, a style favored by SIL International, is not  
universally accepted (SIL itself has been criticized as not being  
unbiased, and for using the garb of science to further its missionary  
agenda).

The subjects and literature of Sanskrit can pull their own weight,  
without having to suffer contortions to copy the styles and standards  
of others.

That is correct to an extent, but Sanskrit and its subjects can surely  
prove their relevance to today's world by meeting the computing  
sciences and other contemporary disciplines in more direct and  
impressive ways than mere translation. For instance, it would be  
absolutely wonderful to see some of the principles of न्याय  
be used to take on computation theory and mathematical logic. The  
modern development of logic has no notion of व्याप्ति  
at all, for instance, and computation theory only deals with functions  
on natural numbers, an approach that has its limitations. It is not  
difficult to see why a proper fusion of the classical and the modern  
could bring very interesting (and useful) results.
