namaste,  
  
I have been thinking a lot on this - English to Sanskrit Information  
technology Dictionary is a good precursor to the much needed  
developing a Sanskrit to English dictionary.  
  
And copyrights - it will be great fun to have a dharma legal yuddha.  
There are two laws that protect Indian publishing of Indian material  
under UNO  
  
1. geographic indicators  
2. traditional knowledge
