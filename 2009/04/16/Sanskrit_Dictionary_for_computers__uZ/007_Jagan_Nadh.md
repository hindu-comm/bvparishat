Tis dictionary will people who is working in Sanskrit localization. Whether the knowledge originally describes in English or Sanskrit doesn't matter. In 21st cent. relevance of local languages are increasing. It products will be appearing with local language interface, say Mobile Phone with Sanskrit interface and SMS service.
