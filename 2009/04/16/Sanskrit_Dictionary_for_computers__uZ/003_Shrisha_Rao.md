The document seems to be a literal translation into Sanskrit of some  
words and definitions from the FOLDOC dictionary (http://  
[www.foldoc.org](http://www.foldoc.org)). Credit to that source needs to be given explicitly,  
and copyright concerns would need to be addressed first before any  
publication (your translation will have to accept the terms of the GNU  
Free Documentation License -- see <http://foldoc.org/?Free+On-line+Dictionary>  
for details).  
  
I am not sure I understand the purpose of such a Sanskrit dictionary.  
Each field of study has a particular language that is associated with  
it; Old Testament studies always require Hebrew, Roman Law needs  
Latin, व्याकरण and other वेदाङगs need Sanskrit -- there is no way  
around this need, and technical translations that seek to supplant the  
originals are of limited value. Likewise, computer science is always  
in English (there are still significant amounts of scholarship in  
other subjects, e.g., mathematics, which are published in other  
languages such as Russian or French, but computer science is  
universally in English only, even in Europe, Israel, China, etc.,  
which use other languages for some other subjects). Seeking to deal  
primarily in a different language seems quite incongruous, sort of  
like the insistence of some European/Eurocentric Indologists that only  
German-language works in Indology are to be considered of value.  
  
The accuracy of quite a few of the Sanskrit translations is also  
somewhat questionable -- they seem to capture the literal word-  
meanings of the FOLDOC originals, but stray from the correct computing  
senses because the original English words are often idiomatic. See  
for example words like heap, newsgroup, node, noise. Some others are  
really not translated at all, e.g., hash function. Some translations  
could be completely misunderstood by someone who knows Sanskrit  
primarily; e.g., अब्जाष्टकानि.
