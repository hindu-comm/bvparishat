Sanskrit scholars have developed a number of types of dictionaries
based on Phonetics, multi-form ( aneka-rupa); many meaning ( anekartha), comparative ( Like Rajavyavahaarakosha); indices and a number of varieties. They in a modified form may profitable be used in computer. It shall save a lot of labour to generate fresh dictionaries for computer.A few details are found in my book of lexicography: Sanskrit kosasastra ke vividha aayaama published by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. Huge material from Manuscripts is lying in my collection which was a UGC project. Recently I published and revised a paper on : some less-known Vedic lexicons: at a seminar of National Mission of Manuscript and a paper on latest issue of Sanskrit Vimarsa of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. A few papers including at Sanskrit Akademi at Delhi were read on the same issue of computer including the methodology of input in computer. Unfortunately it was not published and I have no time  
for the electronic version for the scholars. If needed to anyone, I may send the information to individual scholars. Any matter available will be received with thanks for my publication in future. Regards, SP Narang
