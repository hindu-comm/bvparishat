Thanks for your comments.

Yes. This issue is taken care. We too publish this dictionary which is  
based on the above mentioned dictionary under GPL.  
In the book it is acknowledged.

\> it; Old Testament studies always require Hebrew, Roman Law needs

\> other subjects, e.g., mathematics, which are published in other  
\> languages such as Russian or French, but computer science is  
\> universally in English only, even in Europe, Israel, China, etc.,  
\> which use other languages for some other subjects).  
  

I don't have any strong argument against this. But, I made it clear in  
my preface to the hard-print edition. I will enclose the same here in  
response to your comments.  
  
Excerpts....  
  
At the same time we do not claim that this would serve the whole  
purpose to create new literature related to computers in Sanskrit. It  
is just a primer step, which is yet to take a complete path.  
  
Creation of literature related to contemporary subjects and sciences  
is a sign of any living language. The modern world moves with science.  
Technical literature on developments in sciences is probably written  
in English. Textbooks on these subjects are also authored in English.  
The same literature is made available in Russia, France, German,  
Japan, China and other countries in their own languages. We also find  
some efforts to write such technical books in Hindi, which is our most  
widely used national language. Similar efforts are made to create  
technical literature in other Indian languages also. Though the  
success of such translations is still in question, it would certainly  
not a waste of time and efforts to publish such literature in these  
languages. We should keep the long life of these languages in view  
while thinking about them. Anything written in them will be a great  
base for their sustenance. We must welcome such efforts. It is true in  
the case of Sanskrit also. Some are of the opinion that Sanskrit being  
a classical language need not be considered as a spoken language and  
for the same reason the creation of such modern literature is a waste  
of time and energy. Nevertheless, not keeping the space for Sanskrit  
among living spoken languages, one can not reject the necessity of  
creation of such technical literature for the reason that Sanskrit has  
all capacity to provide room for creation and coining new technical  
words basing on the roots of Sanskrit and on the sound base of  

grammar. This capacity of Sanskrit has been tested many times for  
coining of new technical terms. In fact not only Indian languages, but  

also English and other languages also borrow Sanskrit roots for  

generation of new technical words. It is again high time to prove the  
power of Sanskrit language by creating literature in Sanskrit about  

computers. I understand this effort is worth with this objective.  
  
As I and Sri Shrikanta Jamadagni, who believe in the traditional way  
of scholarship, think that this kind of effort will not at all harmful  
for the tradition. We have tried our best to follow the tradition in  
many aspects with a greater care. Since this is still in testing  
stage, one should not take this as final one. While putting these  
terms in use in case you feel that any word is not appropriate, please  
let us know your opinion. It will help us in improving and correcting  
the current version of Dictionary. We request the users of this  
dictionary to give their feedback with out any hesitation.

Yes. The terms selected are yet to be carefully examined from all  
aspects. We welcome the expert opinion.
