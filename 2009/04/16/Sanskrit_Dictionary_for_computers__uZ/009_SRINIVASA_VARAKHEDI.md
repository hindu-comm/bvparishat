It's really an interesting and useful debate. Both the sides have some  
common point. There are no extreme contentions here. After reading  
these positions and counter-positions, I think we should balance  
between the both.  
  
The points raised by Dr.R.Sadshiva Murty ji are based on realty and  
experience. On the other hand the opinion expressed by Dr.Shrisha Rao  
reflects the expectations of modern scholars from Sanskrit community.  

  
\> That is correct to an extent, but Sanskrit and its subjects can surely   
\> prove their relevance to today's world by meeting the computing   
\> sciences and other contemporary disciplines in more direct and   
\> impressive ways than mere translation. For instance, it would be   
\> absolutely wonderful to see some of the principles of न्याय   
\> be used to take on computation theory and mathematical logic. The
  
\> modern development of logic has no notion of व्याप्ति   
\> at all, for instance, and computation theory only deals with functions   
\> on natural numbers, an approach that has its limitations. It is not
  
\> difficult to see why a proper fusion of the classical and the modern
  
\> could bring very interesting (and useful) results.  
\>  
  

I agree to this point made by Shrisha Rao. Such research work needs  
fine brains with rigorous training in both the fields. Or a team with  
the sole interest should work for years to achieve this goal. This  
requires U tern in Sanskrit Research. The present mindset of Sanskrit  
community needs a shift. Though i have been working in the same field  
for lat 8 years, i have not gained confidence to achieve some  
breakthrough results.  
  
Regarding translation and other similar works i have made my points  
clear in my preiv. mail. I thank Dr.Sadashiva Murty ji for his  
brilliant arguments.

shrivara
