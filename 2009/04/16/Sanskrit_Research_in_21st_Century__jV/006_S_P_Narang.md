Another very important source which incldes information of books and articles from important journals is Annual Bibliography of Oriental Studies, Kyoto University Japan : available both in print and online text. I have seen the volumes upto 2000. Hence onwards, it was online. It is less connected but you may try. It is an excellent scholarly collection of various sources. The best is earliest: Orientalishce Biblographie: 26 vols. It is reprinted. Wonderful source. Regards, spnarang
