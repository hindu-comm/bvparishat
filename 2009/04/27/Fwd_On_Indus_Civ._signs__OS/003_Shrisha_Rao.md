In this regard, I guess many here will have seen the article in  
yesterday's Hindu paper, but here it is if not:

<http://www.hindu.com/mag/2009/05/03/stories/2009050350010100.htm>

\> ---------- Forwarded message ----------  
\> From: Michael Witzel \<[wit...@fas.harvard.edu]()\>

\> Its conclusions about 'script', language, etc. therefore are  
\> baseless, wrong and misleading:  
\> Garbage in, garbage out, as has been reported by  
\> [www.newscientist.com](http://www.newscientist.com).  
\>  
\> Instead, see our (S. Farmer, R. Sproat, M. Witzel) brief refutation,  
\> published on the same day as the Rao paper, at:  
\> \<<http://www.safarmer.com/Refutation3.pdf>\>

It is unfortunate that Witzel uses such intemperate language to convey  
his disagreement, and it is also significant that much of his own  
writing on this subject has appeared on websites or his own electronic  
journal, rather than in peer-reviewed scientific journals of  
international repute. Anyone can put an article saying whatever he  
wants on some personal website; that is hardly within the mainstream  
of academic scholarship, in any discipline.

That said, however, it is only fair to note that in several instances  
there is at least as much to criticize about Witzel's opponents as  
about him. For instance, the theories of N.S. Rajaram, David Frawley,  
etc., are quite often questionable, to put it mildly; Witzel in one  
instance has made a persuasive case showing that Rajaram and another  
author faked a "horse seal" said to be from Harappa.

\> In the margin: the Rao, et al. paper is depends on an article by  
\> Claude Shannon "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," in The Bell  
\> System Technical Journal 27 (1948), pp 379-423 and 623-656. See the  
\> employment  
\> of the phrase: "conditional entropy."  
\> Rao, [et.al](http://et.al)., however, do not even bother to give the title of this  
\> article in their bibliography. The Shannon article is available here  
\> (see esp. pp. 14-15 of that study):  
\> <http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf>

That is a well-known foundational paper, but the state of the art in  
information theory (as the subject is called) has of course moved well  
beyond Shannon's foundations from six decades ago. There is probably  
more scholarly work published each year in information theory than  
Witzel -- and his twin brother, if he has one -- would produce in a  
lifetime. It is not particularly significant that the title of  
Shannon's paper is not cited (after all, how many people cite the  
original paper of Einstein while discussing relativity?). It however  
would be good to consider whether information theory is correctly  
understood by those seeking recourse to its principles. If not, it  
would unfortunately not be the first time that scholarship in the  
humanities has been tainted by ersatz science; see Sokal, Alan D. and  
Bricmont, Jean. Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse  
of Science. Picador USA: New York, 1998. ISBN 0-312-19545-1.
