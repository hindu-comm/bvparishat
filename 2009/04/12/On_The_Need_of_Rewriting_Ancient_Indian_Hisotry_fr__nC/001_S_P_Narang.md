To all: It is not only the Maya civilization but a number of civilizations of BRhattara Bhaarata which had been responsible for the formation of modern India. If we make a further analysis of our civilization on the basis of anthropology, linguistics, manner of life, manner of fighting, behaviour we will find interesting results. The history should be consolidated on the basis of all the factors irrespective of the results in our favour or not. We are searching the Truth. Many of our Pandits and historians do not go beyond what is written in the books of history ; right or wrong; true or biased. Let us emerge true and bring out true history on the basis of all the evidences found in any part and language of India. As suggested earlier, even its small pebble may be useful to resotre the missing link of history. Our words, routes, trades, commerces are lost under the modern civilization. They may be in any language particularly the idioms of Sanskrit or any language. Let us come together to reconstruct and restore our palace gone in the darkness of time. Regards, spnarang
