namaste,



namaste,

Congratulations on your post - "On The Need of Rewriting Ancient Indian Hisotry from exclusive Sanskrit Sources"

I thinkthe "Hisotry" in your heading istypo error indeed of "Hissotory" that the Indian child is still being tortured with.



My work is currently with the languages of meso america and south america - I am pleased to attach pdf file on concordance of these languages and need for applyingIndian barahkhadi system toresolve misconceptions and doubts on our scriptures.



This is the first attempt of me trying so called "scientific" approach for my own self. It has been accepted without comment at all in the egroups I belong very surprisingly, excepting one comment that advised me to stop researching - quoting "statistical probabilities of finding similar sounding words".



This dampened my "stupendous discovery" for 10 minutes. I started and discovered "pANiNI" dhAtupATha as tool - and lo it is not just "vedic" sanskrit - but telugu, tamil, hindi words that are related to kiche mAa but also another meso american dialect of maya.



my shortly to be published work is more "scientific" will be with stochastic analysis



regards
