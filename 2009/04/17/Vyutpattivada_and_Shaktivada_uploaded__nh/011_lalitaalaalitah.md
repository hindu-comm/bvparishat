vIranArAyaNa ji,  
I think that [archive.org](http://archive.org) has big space. It also gives us space to write about books and authors on download page. So, it will be a good choice.  
However, uploading editable books on dhaval ji's website is far good. It has already so many editable books.  
Till then I request to share those books which you mentioned in op.
