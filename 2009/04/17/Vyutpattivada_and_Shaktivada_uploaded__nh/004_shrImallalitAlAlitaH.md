This is quite old thread, (when I was not a member of this forum probably).  
The file storage support was withdrawn by Google in 2011 !  
The file mentioned in OP is not available now.  
  
I request Moderators to build a separate storage to upload books, etc. as he mentioned in OP.  
If it is not possible, please share the book, preferably word copy with us again.  
Thanks.
