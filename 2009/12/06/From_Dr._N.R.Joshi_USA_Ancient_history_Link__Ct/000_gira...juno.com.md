Respected Scholars. Namaskar!

Whom to believe and not to believe for Historyportions in Ramayan and Mahabharat?

First I congratulate Tirumal Kulkarni for asking question on Ramayan.I thank Dr. Bhat for giving correct website Boloji.com. I read the article of Pradip Bhattacharya (IAS officer). I certainly admire his spirit of making inquiry from all possible sources.I am not surprised that IAS officer did notfind the source of the verse \<Janani janma ----->.

Archaeologists from India visiting USA tell in their lectures that original Mahabharat was small (Jaya) and many stories are added later on. Dr. Amartya Sen publicly remarked in Indian History Congress that Ram and Krishna were not historical persons.Dr. S.S.N. Murthy of JNU in his paper concluded that Mahabharat is a dramatized version of the Battle of Ten Kings among Aryan tribes described in Rigveda.

Under this chaotic situation, I would like to know from scholars, is there archaeological evidencefor Hastinapur and Indraprastha within the borders of Indian subcontinent? Evidence from direct Sanskrit verses from original Mahabharat may also help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
