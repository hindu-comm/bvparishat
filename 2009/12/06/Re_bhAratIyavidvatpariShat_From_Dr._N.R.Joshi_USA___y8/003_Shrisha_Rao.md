In addition to the works of Lal, etc., we can surely also consider \`The Lost City of Dvaraka' by S.R. Rao, describing the marine excavations off the coast of Gujarat and their significant findings, regarded by him and others as giving archeological evidence for the existence of the city described in the Mahabharata and Puranas.

It is worth noting that even the historical emperor Ashoka was considered mythological by some scholars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to the discovery of the well-known pillars and inscriptions bearing his name.

I am not aware of any clear archeological evidence that would substantially falsify any part of the Mahabharata, such as there exists to falsify, e.g., the Old Testament's story of the exodus of Israelites from Egypt. To the extent that its claims can be verified, they do seem to bear out. For instance, it is said that in the Mahabharata war, the Kaurava army had elephants from what is now Assam, and the Pandavas had elephants from what is now Tamil Nadu; and sure enough, even today these are regions that are well-known for their elephants. There is no obvious anachronism or factual impropriety such as the incorrect Old Testament claim that Moses used camels.

The theory that the Mahabharata was originally smaller and consists of three layers stems primarily from an incorrect interpretation of the मन्वादि केचिद्ब्रुवते ह्यास्तीकादि तथापरे verse, with subsequent speculations added to this misunderstanding. Even if one grants such an interpretation, at least for argument, the fact remains that no one has been able to identify the layers of the text throughout and show that they fulfill clear characteristics. Marxist scholars and some others find it convenient to belittle the Mahabharata for their own purposes, but then again, the credibility of Marxist academics is not the highest since they also try to demean the importance of the 1942 Quit India movement (which the Marxists of the time opposed), and to wish away the 1962 war that China inflicted on India (which is inconvenient as it would necessitate criticism of Chinese Marxism).

Even setting aside any questions about the suitability of Marxism as a guiding philosophy for the study of Indian history, the linguistic analyses and claims that are used as a basis to arrive at many historical conclusions do not inspire much confidence. For instance, it is said that the language of the ऋग्वेद was a vernacular (i.e., a spoken language) with no formal grammar, and that such grammars (e.g., the canon of Panini) were devised and used later for post-Vedic and Puranic texts. If this is so, however, then it should be trivial for someone of minimal education like a cowherd to compose a ऋक् meaning something like, "I will go and bathe in the river, and then come back and milk the cows." However, even great scholars who have acquired a profound knowledge of Vedic Sanskrit by their brilliance and a lifetime of dedicated study would struggle to compose statements freely in such manner, if at all they found it possible.
