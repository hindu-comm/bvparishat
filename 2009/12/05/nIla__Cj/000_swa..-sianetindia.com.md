Hello,

It is true: according to Amarakosha both krishNa and nIla denote the colour  
black. In Kannada,Malayalam etc. nIla is used for blue.

In Sanskrit also, in the sentences like \`nIlaM nabhaH' etc. nIla is  
used for blue.

So, it is clear that the word nIla is not ambiguous.\`nIla' denotes  
blue and black whereas kRSNa denotes black.

The specific Sanskrit word for blue is nIla. Infact nIla in its utmost  
density is black.That is why the statement \`nIlaM tamaH' etc.
