Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Subject: Question on Sanskrit word for repetition by Shree d. b. Ganapati



Thanks to all scholars who suggested different Sanskrit words. As I understand, the original question was repetition in daily life. Daily life routines can be described by Nitya while incidental by Naimittika. I may be wrong. There is also the word “Veepsaa” It is for repetition of words (like Vriksham Vriksham prati sincati) to show successive action. This is not suitable to original question. The word “abhyasta” has two meanings. In grammar it means reduplicated (Apte Dictionary-Shaishave abhyasta Vidyaanaam). In mathematics it means multiplied. If this is true, then what is the difference between guNaakaara and abhyasta?

One more question. I know meanings of "anu" and "gati". What is exactly meant by "Anugati". Please illustrate by example.



This discussion shows that words have meanings of their own. Syntax and Sandharbha reinforce certain shades of meanings and help us to choose right wordsThanks. N. R.Joshi.
