Respected Scholars,Namaste!

First I would like to thank Dr. D. Battacharya for giving information on Dr. B. B .Lal’s work at village sites of Hastinapur and to Dr. V. Pandurangi who briefly mentioned excavation at Drupad Kila.



Please do not misunderstand me. I am not here to demote the ancient history of India or Mahabharat. I am checking my information with scholars of this list. I met Dr. B.B. Lal two times in USA. I did talk with him about his archaeological excavations at the village Indapatt (or Purana kila). Here is my understanding. During excavations, we get different strata with pottery pieces. From carbon dating, their approximate time zone is decided. From this process conclusions are drawn that Hastinapur and Indraprastha were here or around here.



The present Iranian people had no cultural connection left (after Islamization-700 AD)with the ancient people of Persian Empire.So Shaha of Iran and his father Reza Shaha were just ordinary people whousurped the throne of modern Iran. The ancient connection was strenuously mentained up to 600 AD by three Empires-Persian, Parthian and Sassanian. Original Persians ran away to India after 700 AD



Here is my information. King Prateepa had three sons.The first Devapi had white leprosy. So he was rejected as the king. The next in line was Vahlika. He was made king but he left kingdom and went to the kingdom of his maternal uncle. The third in line was Shantanu who then became king of Hastinapur. Madri was also addressed as Vahliki by Kunti because Madra and Vahlika were sister provinces of Kuru empire. The position of ancient Vahlika desha is undisputed. It is the ancient Bactria (north of present Afghanistan) of the time of Alexander in the known history. The king of Madra was Shalya. His kingdom occupied Shakal Dveepa which was east of Shaka Deveepa. Shakas in the known history were displaced by Yuchi (Kushanas). They then settled in Harahati basin (of modern day Afghanistan) called Shakasthan, the modern Sigisthan. Shakal dveepa was further east of original land of Shakas. So Shaka, Shakal, Madra and Vahlika were not inside the Indian subcontinent. The king of Tushar (present Tokharistan) was taking care of pantry in the Rajasooya yajnya of Raja Dharmaraj.



The research by Parshi scholars of India had shown that Panchal clans Srinjaya, Sahadeva and Somaka were settled on the northern shore of Persian Gulf (ancient name-Bitter River). Srinjaya is present Huaza or Khujistan of Iran (also called Elam in Bible), Sahadeva and Somaka were called Hudimery. Their information also appears in Assyrian ancient history. Baluchistan was country of Bhadragana Kshatriyas. Beacause of friction between Kuru-Kauravyas and Kuru-Pandavas, Bhisma divided Kuru Empire and he gave the western half to Pandavas. Pandava went into new province called Khandavaprastha (not Khandava vana) and there they established new capital called Indraprastha. At that time Khandava prastha was desert. But Pandavas changed the area by their work. In short Hastinapur was capital of Kuru-Jaangala while Indraprastha was that of Khandavaprastha. Kurukshetra, Kurujangal, Kurupanchala, Kurushravana , Kuru-Yugandhara were different provinces of Kuru empire. Samanta panchaka was even different area. Mahabharat war took place in Samanta panchaka most probably west of the modern day Afghanistan. The main parties in war Sindhu, Sauvira, Shibi, Gandhara (from the subcontinent) and Vahlika,Madra, Yugandhara, Stree Rajya, North Panchal (Dronacharya kingdom) and truncated South Panchal (that of Drupad), and many others were concentrated on the border of the modern day Pakistan and Afghanistan extending to Central Asia.



The present day Archaeological excavations show Aryan presence from Ukraine to StreeRajya (Chinese Synkyang province). Archaeological excavations took place in the Ladies kingdom. Artifacts from Ladies Kingdom on loan from Afghanistan were shown in Houston Museum of Fine Arts in May 2009. The ancient kingdom of Ila had close contact with Ladies kingdom. Ila kings occasionally dressed like ladies.



Five towns asked by Pandavas were not Sonpat, Panpat, Marpat from north India. They were Indraprastha, Avisthal, Vrikasthal, Varanavata and Makandi. People from modern Turkamenistan (north of Iran) are Turkish people. They call themselves as descendants of a wolf (Vrika). Vrikas were present in Mahabharat. As a matter of fact Kurukula was sub-branch of Vrika kula. In the known history, Persian Empire had division of 10000 immortals (warriors once entered battlefield never retreat) similar to Mahabharat Sanshaptaka warriors.



Now you have two pictures-one Kuru Empire confined to north India or the other, that of the empire all over Asia from Ukraine to Chinese Tartary and from Manchuria to Rama-rhada in Afghanistan. Also note in the known history no Kurus or Kambojas went to fight with Alexander from inside of the subcontinent but they were fighting with Alexander from Afghanistan side. The first effort from India side to go out of the subcontinent came from Chandragupta of Magadha who entered Afghanistan to free east Afghanistan from Selukas Nikator.



In my opinion the real history of the ancient Indian people (Krisna’s clans and Ikshvakus) is hidden in Mahabharat. That needs to be explored. This information is not from the scholars of AIT (Aryan Invasion Theory) and not from the scholars of OIT (Out of India Theory). In my opinion ancient history of Mahabharat and origin of the ancient Sanskrit (not classical Panini Sanskrit) are interconnected problems.



I read recent papers of Dr. B. B. Lal trying to show that Vedic people went from India to the BMAC complex (Bacria-Margiana-Mriga Oasis archeological excavations) while alien scholars are presenting evidence for influx from outside into the subcontinent. In my opinion therewas no suchpeople as Vedic people. We can describe kings and kingdoms from Mahabharat era. This is so because even before Mahabharat war there were people living for thousands of years. Please correct me if I were wrong in my understanding so that I will grow in my knowledge with your knowledge. Thanks. I apologize for a long posting. N.R.Joshi.
