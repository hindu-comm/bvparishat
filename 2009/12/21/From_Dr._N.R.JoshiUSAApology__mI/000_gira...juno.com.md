Respected scholars, Namaskar!

I appologize if my last posting on bvparishat was corrupt due to virus problem. However I am not in habit of sending any funny or sexy e-mails. I have full understandingof bvparishat composed of higly qualified scholars from India. In my last posting on bvparishat (History link) I copied few lines in Sanskrit (Barah font) from the posting of respected I.V.N. Acharya on Russia. In my posting I mentioned about Ladies kingdom from Synkyang province of China. There is mention in Rigveda about war between Namuchi and Indra where Namuch used lady warriors. Two of them were captured by Indra.That is all. Nothing more.If any questions, please free to write to me. Thanks. I wish you all happy holiday season. N.R.Joshi.
