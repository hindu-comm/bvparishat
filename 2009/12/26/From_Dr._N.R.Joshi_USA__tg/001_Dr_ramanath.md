Dear Sir.  
Namaskar  
Your question is, Were there any such Linguistic Experiments

  
undertaken in the ancient and modern India?  

In fifth or sixth century A.D Dignaga has already discussed all these  
concepts in his text Pramanasamuccaya, such as the nature of  
information conveyed by language, the meaning of individual words, the  
meaning of sentence, the sentence as the primary linguistic symbol  
etc. His concept is same as Aristotle and other western scholars have  
discussed in later period. Bhartrihari, in his Vakyapadiya, has also  
given detail discussion in this context. In this regard I would like  
to refer a book entitled 'Dignaga on the Interpretation of Signs',  
Richards P. Hays,, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht/Boston/  
London, 1988. Here you will find about Linguistic experiments in  
detail especially in fifth chapter.  
Thanks

\> (1) Nature of language was debated by ancient Greeks. Aristotle concluded that since words were conventional signs, they could only be considered as the result of an agreement among the users. Epicurus raised the question how it was possible for people devoid of language to agree on the meaning of the words to be used.  
\> (2) Leibniz, the German mathematician dreamed of a language which was to be “an algebra of thought” in the service of science and philosophy. He wanted to simplify gender, declension and conjugation in his proposed language to be built brick by brick from existing natural languages. Other scholars denounced his idea because they believed that natural languages are embedded in cultural levels and one cannot create a linguistic quilt (Marathi-Godhadi). This effort to create ideal language failed.  
\> (3) In 1629 AD Rene Descartes proposed a universal language to be spoken as well as written and he was also the first to propose that it to be an artificial one, invented from scratch. This never materialized. So this effort failed before it started.  
\> (4)John Wilkins around 1668 AD proposed a philosophical language. Each classification of knowledge carried not a letter, but a geometrical symbol. A word is made by stringing together these symbols (like Chinese ideogram).Wilkins then gave each symbol a monosyllabic sound, so words could be spoken if desired. Of course this clumsy idea did not go far and failed.  
\> (5)George Delgamo in his Ara Signorium published in 1661 AD divided all human knowledge into seventeen broad categories. Each category was denoted by a consonant like “k” stood for all political matters. The sub-classification was achieved by adding a vowel thus ‘ku’ meant all matters pertaining to war. This polysyllabic scheme collapsed after creating few new words.  
\> (6) Such linguistic experiments continued as late as 1960 when J. C. Brown in his artificial language ‘Loglan’ mapped each letter directly to a sound in all spoken cases of 22 consonants and 5 vowels. The Scientific American even published article on his research. We do not hear any more ‘Loglan’ so this effort failed.  
\>  
\> (7) Many western scholars made efforts to invent meanings of letters used in words of their language based on the method of trial and error. These efforts failed because in their language they found out that sound and sense do not go hand in hand. Then efforts were made to find universal sound symbolism in different languages like English, German, Arabic. It failed after success in few words.  

\> (7) Garry \<?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" />Jennings in his book, “Personalities of Language” says that what the 17th century philosophers were seeking was what 20th century semantics still are seeking a language free of fuzz, fog, and mublefug.

  
\> (8) Philosophers and logicians realized that philosophy is linguistic problem and hence they would like to have a language having a structure that must “correspond to” or “mirror” in some sense, the ontological structure of reality. In order to prove the idealness of the invented perfect language, one must have prior and independent knowledge of the structure of reality. This program involved vicious circle and hence it was rejected.  
\> (9) With the advent of digital computer machines, many efforts were made to invent phonetic languages (without words such as ‘but’ and ‘put’) in order to avoid ambiguities. They just remained in published papers here and there without any wide use.
