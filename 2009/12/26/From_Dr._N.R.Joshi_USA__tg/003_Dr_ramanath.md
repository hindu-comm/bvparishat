Dear Scholars  
I wish you a very happy new year to all.  
Now, regarding my earlier posting, I am sorry for the correction about  
the period. The time of Aristotle is 335 to 323 BC and Dignaga's is  
in probably first half of the sixth century A.D. Dignaga and  
Bhartrihari are contemporary and after Aristotle..
