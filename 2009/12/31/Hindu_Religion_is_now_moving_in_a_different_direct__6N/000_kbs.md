Sub: Hindu Religion is now moving in a different direction  
I AM WRITING ABOUT PROBLEMS FACED BY INDIAN PEOPLE WITH SPECIFIC  
REFERENCE AS TO HOW THEY CAN BE SORTED OUT BY REVIVAL OF HINDU  
RELIGION.  
THE NAME OF MY BLOG IS AGNI PARIKSHA OF SITA AND THE URL IS  
<http://awara32.blogspot.com/>  
Excerpts from my post “ Ramayan and History “  
“Lot of people have started feeling that Hindu Religion has totally  
moved away from the cherished path and is now completely moving in a  
different direction as a result that Hindus, by and large, although  
being highly religious, are not getting desired result as a society.  
Lack of education for girls, dowry deaths, suicides among farmers,  
increase in court cases among relatives, mistrust and discontent, are  
all physical parameters to measure the effectiveness or success/  
failure of religion in a society. This compiled with fact that  
religious shops (no. of Gurus) have increased, the spending on  
religion by Hindus have increased drastically-- speak of disastrous  
misadventure. All this need to be corrected– at least sincere effort  
has to be made”.
