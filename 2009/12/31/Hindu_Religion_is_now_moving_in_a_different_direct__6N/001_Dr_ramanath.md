,ABOUT PROBLEMS FACED BY INDIAN PEOPLE WITH SPECIFIC

  
REFERENCE AS TO HOW THEY CAN BE SORTED OUT BY REVIVAL OF HINDU  

RELIGION.,

All these happening due to globalization of the system, and it is the  
problem of all religions of the world. You just see what happening in  
the western countries in these dyas. The main reason of all these  
things are economic crisis and selfish attitude of the people. Whether  
they are cristian, Muslim, Buddhist or from any other ethnic group.  
There is need of changing in the system of the world. Both  
matterialim and spritualism, not theorotical approches but its  
practical applications,should be combined with the present global  
system of any religion.  
The process of globalization in today’s world compels us to understand  
the world as a single unity, and deeply affects all aspects of our  
lives - economic, political and cultural. Buddhism retains its core  
concepts, yet has capacity to include and develop new practices which  
makes its impact global. That is why with its concept of the  
Bodhisattva, it has been able to move through countries, through  
cultures, through centuries. The Bodhisattva performs deeds, not for  
himself nor his own but for all sentient beings, such as human beings,  
animal, tree, plants and all other organisms, for their welfare,  
their ethical and spiritual upliftment. This ideal has a universal and  
eternal relevance, more so in the present age of the danger of  
globalize destruction. Put simply, a self-centered attitude is the  
source of all sufferings - of one’s own and of others-, while selfless  
attitude and a concern for others is the source of happiness, well-  
being and welfare of all - including one’s own self. The Bodhisattva  
ideal, thus, deserves a global spiritual response to meet the  
challenges of this age. The concept of the Bodhisattva, - the ego-  
liberated ideal, and model teacher, - is the only savior of the  
present world from its global gloom of personal over-ambitions and  
ignorance. The present paper tries to demonstrate this Mahayana  
concept of the Bodhisattva as an ideal giving solutions to the present-  
age challenges.
