Tangible evidence from a foreign country on "Why to study Sanskrit?"

Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

This news may be old for some. I thought it is worth adding it here. If you know it already, ignore it.

British School Makes Sanskrit Compulsory  
  
Mar 7, 2008  
  
In the heart of London, a British school has made Sanskrit compulsory subject for its junior division because it helps students grasp math, science and other languages better.

"This is the most perfect and logical language in the world, the only one that is not named after the people who speak it. Indeed the word itself means 'perfected language." --Warwick Jessup, Head, Head, Sanskrit department

"The Devnagri script and spoken Sanskrit are two of the best ways for a child to overcome stiffness of fingers and the tongue," says Moss. "Today's European languages do not use many parts of the tongue and mouth while speaking or many finger movements while writing, whereas Sanskrit helps immensely to develop cerebral dexterity through its phonetics."

My comments: Tangible part of Sanskrit is its unique phonetic character with 36 consonants and 16 (or 15) vowels. I concentrated on this part. In ancient India there were many phoneticians and many compositions on Phonetics (Shiksha). Those who are familiar with modern Information Theory, they can tell us more about the optimum size of letters for an alphabet for a language in relation to number of different articulated sounds a human vocal tract can make. Having few letters like Tamil is sufficient or insufficient? Thanks. N.R. Joshi.
