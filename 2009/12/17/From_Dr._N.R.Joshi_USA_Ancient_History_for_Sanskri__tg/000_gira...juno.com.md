Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I am delighted to see the posting of I.V.N. Acharya regarding



\<तदा नमुचिः स्त्रीसैनिकान् इन्द्रस्यॊपरि दण्डयात्रायै प्रेषितवान्।इन्द्र स्तु तत्स्त्रीसैनिकान् स्वायत्तीकृत्य तासु नमुचेः अत्यन्तं प्रेयस्यौ द्वे स्त्रियौ स्वान्तःपुरे कारागार बद्धे कृतवान्। \>



Here respected Acharya is referring to the ancient history as appeared in Rigveda (War between Lady soldiers of Namuchi and Indra) and he referred to the land of Russia.I was talking about Ladies kingdom in Synkyang (its ancient name was different and there were no Chinese in that province in the ancient time).If this verse from Rigveda is telling the ancient history, it means Indra was ruling somewhere in the vicinity of Ladies kingdom. One time Indra was infatuated by the beauty of the lady Vilees'tiga and started staying with her in the dress of ladies.

My question to poojya I.V.N.Acharya-Is all the information in your posting from Rigveda or from other sources? If possible give us all Richa from Rigveda and names of other sources you used.

After reading the posting of poojya Acharya, I feel now that I am on the right track of the ancient history. But why did I go into the history in the first place? Reason-Sanskrit is related to the family of Indo-Europian languages.Its origin is lost in the prehistory of India. US scholar Whitneythought that Moordhanya sounds of /t/, /th/, /d/, /dh/ and /N/ were taken by Indo-Aryan from Dravidian. My question to Indian scholars-do youhave strong evidence from ancient books to prove that Whitney was wrong? Please give us the earliestreference toSanskrit VarNamAlA (not Akshara SamAmnAya of Panini). Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
