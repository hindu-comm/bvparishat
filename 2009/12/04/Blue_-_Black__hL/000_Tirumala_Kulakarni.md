Dears,

According to Amarakosha both the krishNa and nIla denote the colour  
black. In Kannada etc. nIla is used for blue.

In Sanskrit also, in the sentences like \`nIlaM nabhaH' etc. nIla is  
used for blue.

So, it is clear that the word nIla is ambiguous.

Then what is the specific Sanskrit word for blue?
