Dear Madhu Kapoor,

  

I have modified the shloka- roughly to give meaning:

  

वैयाकरणकिरातादपशाब्दमृगाः

क्व सन्तु सन्त्रस्ताः।

ज्यौतिष-नट-विट-गायक-भिषग्-आनन-

गह्वराणि यदि न स्युः॥

***vaiyākaraṇakirātādapaśābdamṛgāḥ***

***kva santu santrastāḥ\|***

***jyautiṣa-naṭa-viṭa-gāyaka-bhiṣag-ānana-***

***gahvarāṇi yadi na syuḥ\|\|***

  

  

Where would live the animals in the form of ungrammatical words terrified by hunter Grammarian, if there were not the cavities of mouth of the astrologer, actor,viṭa, (the accomplice of the hero's in drama-s intermediary person between the hero and heroin, or any male and female illegally), the physician.

  

In other words, the ungrammatical words hunted by the Grammarian seek refuge in the speeches of these people like the animals terrified by the hunter take refuge in the caves in the forests.

  

I am not sure of the exact wordings in the verse, but I have tried to rectify them to yield the meaning as I have given above. For metrical purpose, some changes may be needed. The other scholars would suggest such modifications if any needed. The gist of the saying is that these people never use the language acceptable to grammar.

  

With regards
