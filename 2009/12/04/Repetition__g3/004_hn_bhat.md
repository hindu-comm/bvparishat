Thank you for the clarification.

  

Whether the repetition is considered as blemish "dosha" or "guNa" quality, is decided by the context of occurrence of the repetition modifying the shade of meaning they carry in each case. "repetition" does not change its meaning, only how it is considered only changes in the above circumstances. It is repeated once again in Punarukti, where as in Abhyasa it is repeated several times. It is not specially for Dvaita vedanta only. But technical use of the word common for the interpretation of Vedic passages who deal with Vedic literature.This was intended by me when I said technical use of the words.

  

Punarukti is considered as Dosha everywhere. In poetics, some times it is considered in Guna also in Kavyashastra. It is an accepted fact that "yamaka" "anuprasa" are repetition of syllables, words and sentences with change in meaning, but without change in their acoustic effect are considered as Figures of Speech further classified according to their nature and occurrence. Arthapaunaruktya whereas is considered as a fault in poetics and also in Shastra-s. Only statements which are not proved otherwise, are valid testimony according to Shastra-s. .

  

Now, Bhyasa = AavRuttau, makes it repetition or recurrence of the phrase or expression. As noted by you, it is one among the six other factor that contribute to arrive at the purport of the passage related. Repeated assertion, in that sense.

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारावभ्यासो ऽपूर्वता फलम्।

अर्थवादोपपत्ती च लिङ्गं तात्पर्यनिर्णये॥

  

is the maxim accepted by all the interpretors of Vedic passages including Dvaita exponents.

  

Hope this makes clear the difference between the different technical usages of the two words. Similar is the difference in their technical usage. The implication of the term "abhyasa" has already been dealt with by another member and some other member also has promised to come up with more information on it. Hence I need not take up it here.

You are perfectly right in the above assertion. Abhyasa also means the same in an elaborate sense and etymologically. (pls. see highlighted above) but differs in its technical usage.
