Dear Respected scholars,  
  
I thank all the respected scholars for their responses to the Sanskrit  
equivalent of the concept of Repetition.  
  
Abhyasa, Punarukti, Anuvad, Aavritti, punaraavrtti, Aamredanam – these  
are the words that various scholars have mentioned in this regard.  
  
As some of the scholars pointed out, I think, I must make myself clear  
what I am thinking about Repetition.  
  
Repetition could imply all the words that are listed above. But, I  
think repetition does not mean literally any one of them. The reason  
could be the limitations of the languages themselves about which we  
should not delve much. The above words represent activities in which  
repetition is used. Repeated efforts to learn – is practice or Abhyasa.  
In the same way repeatedly stating something – is punarukti.  
  
  
Prof. Arindam Chakrabarti has mentioned that - there is more materials  
in the Sanskrit traditions to work on Repetition with than there is in  
the Western traditions, in spite of Kierkegaard's book called  
Repetition. I would be greatful to you sir, if you can point out some  
of them in helping me to enrich my understanding of repetition from the  
point of view of Indian Philosophy. The words bhuyobhyah, punahpunah –  
represent repetition, but ….they themselves cannot fill the concept.  
  
I am grateful to Prof. I.V. Nacharya, for pointing out that Repetition  
is understood as one of the Doshas in poetics. But, I was trying to  
locate the concept beyond poetics.  
  
My understanding of Repetition:  
  
Human actions of everyday life are often determined by tradition,  
customs, practices, morals, faith, feeling and utility. All these  
determinants of everyday life are regulated or reiterated by the  
principle of repetition. Most of the human actions are repetitions.  
While taking repetition or repetitive action to be a force which  
sustains the continuity of life while leaving room for creative  
innovations which contribute to the development of life I attempt  
analyze the concept repetition. Repetition in human actions is an  
imitation of the natural phenomena. Concepts of everyday life such as  
routine, discipline, recollection, practice and mimicry – are made  
possible by repetition. Creativity distinguishes sameness from  
uniqueness of repetition. Repetition ensures the continuity in change  
and is the basis of learning.

\>I am very happy to see you after a long time here in BVP.In which  
context do the Western Scholars use "REPETITION" as a Philosophic  
Concept? Pl. Let me know. But I shall try here to give you some  
Sanskrit Equivalents for the word REPETITION.1. AAMREDANAM - This is  
the repetition of words or sounds.2. Abhyaasa - This is of many kinds.  
One of them is the reduplication of Verbal roots in getting some forms  
in special conjugations.  
\>3. AAvritti - This is cyclic repetition.  
\>4. Punaraavritti - This is the repetition of cyclic repetitions. (In  
case of the Cycle of Birth-Death-Rebirth and so on this is often used.  
Ex. 1. Na sa punaraavartate . 2. Punaraavritti Rahita Shaashvata  
Brahmaloka praapti etc.,).  
\>There are  
many other great scholars in this forum to add many more equivalents.  
\>I think these words may be of some use for your purpose.
