Namaste,

\> The above words represent activities in which  
\> repetition is used. Repeated efforts to learn – is practice or Abhyasa.  
\> In the same way repeatedly stating something – is punarukti.

The texts that I have read (primarily on dvaita vedanta) treat  
punarukti as a flaw (doSha). The nearest in English I could relate to,  
is 'redundancy of speech', like in phrases "repeat again", "reply  
back", "revert back", "comprise of" etc. On the other hand, abhyAsa is  
a taatparya-linga. Repetition of the same phrase (like tat-tvaM-asi 9  
times) is abhyAsa. So there does seem to be a difference.

Regards,  
Krishna
