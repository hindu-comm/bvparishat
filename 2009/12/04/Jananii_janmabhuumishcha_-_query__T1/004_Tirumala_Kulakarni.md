Dear friends: The sloka api svarnamayi lanka must be from Ramayana  
itself. There are several slokas like this which have been dumped in  
foot notes in our printed texts with the brand, Prakshipta or  
interpolations. How can then one jump to the conclusion that the  
source cannot be determined? For instance, a number of slokas quoted  
by ancient writers like Yamunacharya and Vedanta Desika, with the  
introductory words such as yatha Indraratre, yatha Santiparvani, etc.  
cannot be traced to the extant editions of the Pancharatra and  
Mahabharata texts. Does it mean that they did not form part of those  
texts? The printed texts available to us do not have these verses.  
That is all. It does not mean that they do not form part of the  
original corpus. One has to patiently reconstruct the original texts  
with the help of such quotations of ancient writers.

  
Regards,

Prof. M.Narasimhachary
