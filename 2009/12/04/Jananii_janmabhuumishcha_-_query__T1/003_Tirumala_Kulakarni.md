Dears,

Thanks for the replies.

अन्ते इदं निश्चितं यत् अस्य श्लोकस्य मूलं न निश्चेतुं शक्यमिति!

The link sent by H N Bhat and Meera Tadipatri is very useful. The  
story of the search is both interesting and informative.

Meanwhile when I discussed this issue with one of our senior scholar  
Sri Venkatesha Deshapande, in Poornaprajna Vidyapeetha, Bangalore,  
where I am working, he quoted an interesting समाख्या (similar saying)  
from Shukasaptati. The shloka is -

उक्तं च -  
सर्वस्वर्णमयी लङ्का न मे लक्ष्मण रोचते ।  
पितृक्रमागताsयोध्या निर्धनाsपि सुखायते ।।

By the words उक्तं च it could be concluded that it is quoted.  
In the preface of Shukasaptati, published by Choukhamba, it is said  
that the work belongs to 11th to 14th century and the author is not  
known.
