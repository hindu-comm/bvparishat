Dears,

It is heard that Vibhiishana offered Rama the throne of Lanka after  
the killing of Ravana.

This was the popular reply of Rama -  
api svarNamayI lankA na me lakshmaNa rocate \|  
jananI janmabhUmishca svargAdapi garIyasI \|\|

This shloka is not found in Valmiki Ramayana.

Could some one give the source?
