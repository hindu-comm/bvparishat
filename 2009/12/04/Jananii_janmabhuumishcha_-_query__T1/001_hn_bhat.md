Here is a link to an earlier inquiry, but without success by one Pradeep Bhattacharya I found on search:

  

<http://www.boloji.com/hinduism/069.htm>

  

[](http://www.boloji.com/hinduism/069.htm)This is only for your information.In one page it is said to be quoted in Anandamuth of Bankim Chatarji. But from the page it is clear that it could not be traced to any versions of Ramayana as the inquiry revealed.

  

But only some other source has to be looked for.

  

With regards
