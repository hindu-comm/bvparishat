Dear All,  
  
BVP mourns on the demise of Prof. M.M.Anantha Lal Thakur, who was one of the great scholars of our times. It is indeed a great loss to indian scholarly community as he was almost a lone scholar in Prachina Nyaya who could intrepret the classics in right way in any language. His contributions will always be remebered. We the members of BVP may pay homage to the departed scholar and express our deep condolences to his family members and desciples.  
  
warm regards,  
BVP management
