Prof. Thakur showed the way we have to go. to edit texts carefully, to unearth them etc. we have a long to go in the way he has shown. His death is deeply mourned. actually he sowed the seeds for reasonable critical apparatus contrary to the western concept of mindless and mindboggeling critical apparatus these western scholars like gersheimmer etc. have created even for works like shaktivada etc. which certainly do not need more waste apparatus. I call all the naiyayikas to unite and edit the texts reasonably to help us through better understanding.
