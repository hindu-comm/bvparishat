Dear Scholars,  
 I have a question regarding the Buddhist School. Do they agree that their Siddhanta is Apaurusheya? Does the verse "शौद्धोदनिप्रभृतयः सम्प्रदायप्रवर्तकाः" indicate that they accept their siddhanta to be Apaurusheya? I would be very grateful If any scholar clarifies this point. Any reference to the above verse in Buddhist works would be very much helpful.  
  
हरये नमः  
राचूरि आचार्यः  
विश्वमध्वमहापरिषत् संशोदनमन्दिरम्,  
बेङ्गलूरु  
  
\~\~  
मम स्वामी हरिर्नित्यं सर्वस्य पतिरेव च ।  
त्वमस्माकं तवस्मसि
