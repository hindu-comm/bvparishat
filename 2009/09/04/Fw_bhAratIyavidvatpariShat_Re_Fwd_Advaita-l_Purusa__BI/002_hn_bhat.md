Dear Piyali,

You have raised the question I was planig to ask. I will get back little later.

Let me answer your second question how medha/medhaa could be etymologically:

It is a very simple question. Both could be derived from the same root:

मिथु मेधृ मेध - मेधाहिंसनयो: - (Both have by derivation both the  
meanings intellect, and violence or precisely injuring, killing)  
without any necessary to resort to historical methods. The medhaavin  
is explained as one who is having medhaa (the intellect). The other  
two words derived in the same way are tejasvii, maayaavii, sragvii (by  
the same rule - )as, maayaa, medhaa-srajo vinih)

Hope this will satisfy your querry in a way.

With regards
