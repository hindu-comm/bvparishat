From the socio-linguistic point of view, I do not think Sanskrit was ever  
a "dead" language ("alive" only as an an archival language). It had always  
been a living language in the familiar, technical sense of the term - it  
has been so for thousands of years. It is not an endangered language in  
terms of today's language endangerment discourse, in my understanding.  
  
The case of the Karnataka village is very interesting. As information it  
is not new. But I do not know if there is any careful and comprehensive  
study of the language use of the speech community there. If there are such  
studies, would you kindly let me know? I shall be grateful.  
  
It is quite interesting that Sanskrit is being used for ads. In any case,  
DD Channels telecast news in Sanskrit on all kinds of topics, from  
politics and science to entertainment and sports.
