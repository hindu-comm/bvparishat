namah sabhAyai,  
 I have been closely following the current discussion about the relevance of Sanskrit in today's world. Thanks to scholars for coming up with several answers. Coming to the topic of "Incentive to study Sanskrit in USA' [gir...@juno.com]() said

  
  
\>A large number of temples are being established in USA cities. In Houston \>may boast 8-9 tamples. Temples are bringing priests from India. They chant \>in Sanskrit. A large number of immigrants are in the area of science, \>engineering and computers. They have only little knowledge of Sanskrit. The \>new generation of Indian children growing in USA have no knowledge of their \>parants' mother tongue and hence zero knowledge of Sanskrit except \>Teertha and Prasaada words from temple. Here is the real problem.  
  

I see that the solution itself is being treated as a problem here. In Sri N.R.Joshi's own words, Indian children growing in USA are getting introduced to Sanskrit words like Teertha & Prasaada, thanks to the local temples. Our friend goes on to say that here is the real problem. But according to me, this is really a happy beginning! While this long mail of Sri Joshi invites a longer response addressing all issues raised therein, I would on the contrary choose to put it succinctly considering the time & effort required and lack of time at my disposal.  
  
If we agree that the objective is to preserve our rich cultural heritage, then there is no other better vehicle except Sanskrit to achieve this. By constructing temples, by bringing in learned priests, by the way of sacred chantings, if one is reaping the benefit of getting introduced to words like Teertha & Prasaada, which are sacred symbols of our rich culture, then this itself is a big incentive for introducing Sanskrit in US or in fact in any other part of the world.  
  
Are not these words of Sanskrit making the newer generation aware of the difference between disease causing junk food and thought-purifying holy prasadam? Between unhealthy bottled drinks and mind-cleansing holy teertha? Are they not purifying their minds by making them realize the fact that in the sacred Indian culture, the food/water is always offered to God and then partaken as prasadam/teertha? Are they not saving our children from otherwise slipping to lead life like mere animals, inspite of being born into such a great race to which Prahlada, Dhruva, Markandeya, Ambarisha and several other mahatmas belong?  
  
While I concur with Sri Joshi that we cannot turn back the arrow of time, at the same time, as sons of holy Bharat Mata, we cannot turn our backs and shy away from doing our bit to save our great culture either!  
  
It is not right to say that Sanskrit is hard to learn and hence irrelevant. Would a beautiful rose be forbidden because it has thorns?  
  
A single word of Sanskrit learnt would surely take one a step closer to the forgotten roots, a step closer to the language of the learned, a step closer to enriching spiritual upliftment, a step closer to realizing one's own divinity!
