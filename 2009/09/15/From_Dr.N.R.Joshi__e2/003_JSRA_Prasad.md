namassarvebhyah,  
  
It seems, what logically put forth by sri IVN has been succinctly replied  
by sri Rachuri Achar. I personally enlightened by these comments. I just  
quote the stanza at our email signature -  

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  

  

With regards,  
Prasad
