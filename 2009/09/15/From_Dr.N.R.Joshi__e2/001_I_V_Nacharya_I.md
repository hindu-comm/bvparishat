Dear Scholars,

praNaamaH.The doubts expressed by our good scholar friend Shri Dr.N.R.Joshi Ji about the incentives,the regidity,the grammar and the terminology in learning sanskrit either in the USA or in India prompted me to spell out some thing I had in my mind.

1.As regards the incentive in a foreign land we cannot expect it from the [GOVT.there.In](http://GOVT.there.In) our mother land we do not have any incentives.In British India incentives were given by the then Estates,Zamindars and certain interested individuals.Since the inception of Independence Sanskrit gradually has been discouraged.Only our Sanskrita Bharati has taken up its cause.It has extended its activities to foreign lands also.Chinmaya Mission also is spreading Sanskrit its best.It is for the people interested in it to seize upon the opportunity with zealto learn.

2.Sanskrit is no doubt regid.But,it has been simplified now by Skt.Bharati and Aurobindo Ashram like organisations.To understand what the priests chant in the temples there it is upto the individuals interested to learn it.

3.Grammar and Terminology also have been simplified.Samasa (compounds) is one of the simplifications you know.In Vedic literature meanings differ according to Udaatta and Anudatta like swara as you know.

"Knowledge for Knowledge'sake"is our motto.All the world over Sanskrit influences every language more or less.For total character development of an individual Sanskrit learning,in my view,is a must.Every thing we need is in Sanskrit.All the Sciences are there.Modern scientific perspective is wanted.

"Vichitraa deha sampattiH,eeswaraaya nivedituM,pUrvaMeva kRutaa BrhmaN,Hasta paadaadi samyutaA "is to be recollected.How to live a life,Sanskrit teaches us.We can illustrate this in many ways.I want to do this hereafter picking out the examples from the classical literature.We find science in the word "paadapa"when we go to its derivative.Excuse me.My Email also became lengthy.

I want to know where "Meru"the mountain is.Can we locate it? Can we find equivalents to our 5(pancha) praaNaas-praaNa,Apana,Vyana,Udaana and Samaana?Can we locate in the body according to western science?Could any scholar friend enlighten these?

With Regards,

I.V.N.[ivi...@yahoo.co.in]()
