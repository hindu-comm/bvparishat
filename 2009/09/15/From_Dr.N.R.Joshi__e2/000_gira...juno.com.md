Respected Scholars, Namaste!

Incentive to study Sanskrit in USA

My original posting was about incentive to study Sanskrit in USA. In stead I received number of nice reasons to study Sanskrit in India. I appreciate postings of all those scholars. A large number of temples are being established in USA cities. In Houston may boast 8-9 tamples. Temples are bringing priests from India. They chant in Sanskrit. A large number of immigrants are in the area of science, engineering and computers. They have only little knowledge of Sanskrit. The new generation of Indian children growing in USA have no knowledge of their parants' mother tongue and hence zero knowledge of Sanskrit except Teertha and Prasaada words from temple. Here is the real problem.

I attended Sanskrit Bharati's spoken Sanskrit classes. People attend as novelty but never turn back again. The linguistic environment of India is not in USA. The whole USA has one language. Alright you learnt fewsentences in Sanskrit. To whom are you going to talk in Sanskrit? This problem is in India also.Prof Gauri Mahulikar is right in saying that due to rigid Sanskrit construction, today's people turn away from it. This is because, today's people of India and elsewhere have available easy languages to speak.We are not at the time of Panini.One cannot turn back the arrow of time. Difficult Sanskrit has become easy Marathi etc.This is according to the Principle of Least Efforts described in elementary linguistic books.

Within India and outside of India there is continuous talk among University scholars that Sanskrit in one language in the spectrum of Indo-European group and she may have parent called PIE. If Sanskrit is one of many, then where is its specialty? In rigid grammar? And could anybody explain why it is advantages to say "Narayanah Jalam Pibati" and not "Narayan Jala Pito"?

In addition could anybody explain why Sanskrit scholars are so fond of making the whole line as one sentence by using their skill of forming Sandhis after Sandhis? What arewe saving, paper, trouble of writing separate words orwe are trying to save syllables? Did not ancient Sanskrit scholars use to say saving one syllable (Laaghavatva) gave them joy of Putralaabha? Whenwe are using English on our computers to describe compact Sanskrit sentences, are we increasing syllables or decreasing them?The same story with Sanskrit Samaasa? How many different opinions are there if this Samaasa is Karmadhaaraya or Tatpurush? Could any body explain why Tvashtra did not use "Indrasya shatru" instead of sammasa "Indra-shatru" and got Vritra killed? On one hand we say the accent changed the meaning and outcome and on the other hand we say nothing happens when a single phoneme is changed because phonemes do not carry semantics significance according to the western linguistic?

When people forget the original intention of compactness of language with passing of years and when language is used by large number of people spread over larger geographical area, statistical elements creep in, the second law of thermodynamics starts showing effect, entropy starts increasing. It seems inevitable that the structure of the language will become less ordered as it diffuses through the world. The condensed (and therefore specialized) meanings originally given to symbols will tend to be broadened and required more additional description through common usage. In other words, it seems likely that there will be a tendency for the minimum average number of bits per message required to convey meaning in normal use of the language to increase with time. When the more concise declensions of single words are replaced by sequences of words, the process makes language easier to learn and use but also results in requiring more bits per message on the average. This why people find English or Marathi or Hindi easier than compact Sanskrit.

We are now decorating old bride Sanskrit Bhasshaa tagging her with Alankaara coined in alien languageon modern computers. However we are still not explaining why she was like that when she was born?

Use of Sanskritfor modern scientific terminology. In that field also one has to explain why a Sanskrit terminology is better than a English word? For that purpose one has to study where English terminology come from. Isac Asimov has written good book on it. All efforts to use Sanskrit terminology in the past were just patchwork with no consistent foundation.My efforts are to find such foundation. Internal beauty of Sanskrit is in her words. If we are going to bring Aryan or PIE, then Sanskrit is just another conventional language like English.. If we are going to say Sanskrit is Vak Devataa, then we are hanging in the sky. Both extremes will nothelp Sanskrit. If we say Sanskrit is our heritage, then we are back to our present situation. Please pardon me for a long e-mail. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
