Dear Schollars,  
I have uploaded my one article on Dehatmavada on the home page of  
भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्. In this article I have refuted नवदेहात्मवाद of  
Pt. Badari Nath Shukla and have shown that how the views of Shuklaji  
are incompatible with the concepts of Nyaya School. On the other hand  
I have also refuted a new kind of देहात्मवाद propounded by Prof.  
Vishvambhar Pahi. Your suggestions are welcome.
