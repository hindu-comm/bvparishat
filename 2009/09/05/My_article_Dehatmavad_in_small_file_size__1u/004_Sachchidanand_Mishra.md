The article of Pt. Badari Nath Shuklaji न्यायशास्त्रीयविचारपद्धत्या देहात्मवादस्य सम्भावना was published first time in Sarasvati Sushama. The same article in a translated form after some time was published in the volume of JICPR. The samearticle was published in उन्मीलन(जुलाई 2000). In this volume of उन्मीलन an article of Dr. Rajaram Shukla was published in which he tried to refute the position of Pt. Badari NathShuklaji.It is very clear to me that inthe volumes ofany thesejournals the refutation by Pt. Badari NathShuklaji of न्यायशास्त्रीयविचारपद्धत्या देहात्मवादस्य सम्भावना article was not published. Even My Guruji Prof. Vashishtha Trpathiji is not aware of the second article you are talking about. It is probable that Pt. Badari NathShuklaji would have written refutation ofन्यायशास्त्रीयविचारपद्धत्या देहात्मवादस्य सम्भावना, but to the best of my knowledge that is not published so far. When I had been writing
refutation ofन्यायशास्त्रीयविचारपद्धत्या देहात्मवादस्य सम्भावना I had tried to find out if any refutation was written by anybody. I will try again.
