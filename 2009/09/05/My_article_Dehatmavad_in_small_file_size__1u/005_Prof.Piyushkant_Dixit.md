It was not published in Saraswti Sushama it was published in another  
Sanskrit journal which editor were Prof. Rajhans & Prof. Shivji  
upadhyaya.  
This journal was started by Dwaraka Das Shastri. As I remember he was  
teacher in Bauddha Darshan department of Sanskrit University.  
So please ask first to above two professors.
