You can ask Prof. Sarveshwar Rajhans ji and Prof. Shivji Upadhyaya,  
these scholars were editor of that journal which was then published  
from Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. It is informed to me by Acharya  
Shukla ji himself.  
If you find it, please provide me too a copy of both articles . Both  
published in same journal in the very starting.
