I am not aware of that refutation of his own article, done by Pt. Badari Nath Shuklaji. If you could provide me details of that refutation, I will be very happy. It will be very thankful to you. So far I know the refutation byPt. Badari Nath Shuklaji is not published yet. I have also heared of that refutation, I do not remember but somebody had talked about this.
