Namaste.  
  
Adding further to Prof. Rajendran and Prof. Narasimhachary's thought provoking comments, I just share my view.  
The gist of the question was \<**If we say it is language of ancient knowledge and traditions of India, then that is not helpful as the same knowledge is available in English medium.**\>  
  
Swami Vivekananda had said - "Sanskrit must be popularized among the people, education must be given to the people in their own language, and at the same time, Sanskrit education must go along with it, because the very sound of Sanskrit words gives a prestige and power and strength to the race". Hence, the emphasis was on reading original texts in Sanskrit. Fine, but how that helps to substantiate the argument?  
  
1. Unless you read any original text of any discipline in Sanskrit, several translation would not be helpful in arriving at the intricate meaning of the passage/word. A translation is a translators world. Reader may not know what exactly is missing in the translation. Earlier we had a discussion in the forum on the Upanishadic translations of Max Muller who intentionally misinterpreted the meanings.  
2. English translations can not be for any help in philological studies. Sanskrit conjugational form '*asmi'* adopted as it is in to Greek as '*esmi'.* Such comparitive studies are only possible by studying an original Sanskrit treatiese. Another example - the word *bhagavan* is commonly translated as 'god'. But 'god' in what sense? The word '*bhaga''* has a specific meaning such as  

ऐश्वर्यस्य समग्रस्य वीर्यस्य यशसः श्रियः ।  
ज्ञानवैराग्ययोश्चैव षण्णां भग इतीरणा ।। (V.P. 6.5.74)  

Hence, 'he who is endowed with these qualities is only called *bhagavan*. Unless it is a Vishnu Sahasranama Bhashya, one may not come across with the actual meaning in this regard.  

  
3. People with speech disabilities, by pronouncing the Sanskrit alphabet in a systematic way, will be cured of such difficulties. Scholars at Aurobindo Ashram, Pondichery are working with the project, I believe.  
4. Sanskrit and Indian culture are inseparable. Any country's education is based on its culture, to get a better picture of Indian culture one should go through the original Sanskrit literature  
  
And finally, we should also ask the foreign students who study Sanskrit in India why for they come here to read Sanskrit when translations are available.  
  
Thanks,  
Prasad
