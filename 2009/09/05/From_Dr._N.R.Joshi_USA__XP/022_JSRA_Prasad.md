Prof. Gauri Mahulikar,  
  
Thanks for the doc that contains good information on the strengths and weaknesses of Sanskrit.  
I have a few comments on a part of your email.

This is a very controversial comment. First of all, let us settle the Aryan-language-culture issue, then we can think of the role  
of priestly class in concealing Sanskrit knowledge.

Even today people link it with Hinduism, and Sanskritists of other faiths, who are very rare, are regarded as specimens in Museum. |

If others think that way, let them be. No way, Sanskrit is a religious language. In the same thread, scholars have discussed the scientific aspects the language. I know many teachers and students from Muslim/Christian communities who are very much in to Sanskrit studies. As a Sanskritist, one should fight back to revert such statements as 'Sanskrit is religious' in line with the 'struggle for freedom.'

It is true but gradually the scenario is changing its face. There are sporadic efforts in India by Govt. of India to revive the Sanskrit teaching and research in a new direction by establishing Sanskrit study centers at various institutions. HCU, JNU, IIT-Bombay, IIT-Kanpur, R.S. Vidyapeetha has such innovative centers/departments. LTRC, IIIT is not to be ignored as they have a center for  
exact humanities. At all these places, interdisciplinary study that leads to reserach degree is observed.

Samskrita Bharati has rendered yeomen service in reducing the rigidity of the grammar. All of us know how they train people in their ten day spoken Sanskrit camps.

We should not consider such feeling as 'weakness' of Sanskrit. There are radical developments in Sanskrit research in terms of language technologies, NLP etc. Vijnana bharati (a voluntary organization) is organizing a national conference annually on different facets of Indian science that is encoded in Sanskrit texts to promote the swadeshi science moment (<http://vijnanabharati.org/>). Recently, on our forum, Dr. Girish Jha has also announced such seminar in this regard. Apart from the institutions/voluntary organizations, there are many an independent scholar who work on Indian sciences.  

  
Sincerely,
