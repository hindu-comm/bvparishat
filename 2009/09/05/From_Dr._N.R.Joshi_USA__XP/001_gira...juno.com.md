Respected scholars, Namaskar!



I am satisfied with detailed reply of Dr hn Bhat and Dr, Dipal Bhattacharya on the meaning of Purushmeda. I thank you both of them. I have entirely new question now.

What is the incentive to study Sanskrit in USA?

A large number of engineers, doctors, computer professional have migrated to many European countries. Because I live in USA, I will write about the picture here. These highly qualified people had at the most knowledge of Sanskrit from their high school years in India. Their children growing in USA have no knowledge of even their provincial language like Marathi etc. Knowledge of Sanskrit is almost impossible situation for them. However Hindu liturgy is in Sanskrit and priests use it, temples use it. Organizations like Sanskrit Bharati holds classes on elementary Sanskrit speaking. Experience tells me that senior qualified people will attend such classes once for curiosity (because Swamis keep talking that Sanskrit is great for computers etc) but all enthusiasm goes away with glimpse of highly inflected language Sanskrit.



Ignorance of Sanskrit is exploited by priests and swamis who throw Sanskrit words here and there to glorify Vedas but the rest is in English. What Hindu priest is saying in the ritual, whether he is doing it right or wrong, these engineers and doctors have no idea. Think what is going to happen to the next generation who only knows English. Then there is big question-when all knowledge is available in English, why one should study Sanskrit unless he/she wants to become Sanskrit professor. Priests do not know Sanskrit beyond their ordinary mantras (forget about Vedas).

If we say Sanskrit is hybrid language (mixture of Aryan +Dravidian) or if we say Sanskrit is like any other conventional language like English, then it is certainly not in favor of Sanskrit. If we say it is language of ancient knowledge and traditions of India, then that is not helpful as the same knowledge is available in English medium. So what are the selling plus point for Sanskrit in front of the rolling tank of English?
