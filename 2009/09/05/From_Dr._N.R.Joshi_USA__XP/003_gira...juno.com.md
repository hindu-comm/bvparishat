Respected scholars, Namaskar!

Dr. C. Rajendran hasposted wonderfully the number of reason to study Sanskrit. I will use it in my powerpoint presentation on "Internal Beauty of Sanskrit". This is based on my own research(semantics of Sanskrit words) after showing preliminary information on grammar of Sanskrit and comparison of Sanskrit with English.I also discuss the idea of an efficient linguistic code, application of second law of thermodynamics to languages, periodic table of articulated sounds,and many other concepts.

Shree Vidyamanohar Sharma reported conversion of hindi movie "Sholey" dialogs into Sanskrit to popularize Sanskrit speaking. This is praiseworthy effort.

Sometime back I read that Dr. Shrinivas Varakhedi prepared Sanskrit paribhaashaa (terminology) for modern computer words. I would like Sanskrit terminology prepared for all science and engineering subjects. You will say such terminology already exists. I know that. In my opinion it was created onadhoc basis with no systematic foundation. I would like to have "anavarthaka samjnyaa"even if it is long as Patanjali described. Terminology should produce instant understanding behind the concept. Example- the mathematical complex number should not translated into Kathina sankhyaa or Jatil sankyaa. Such number has amplitude and phase. So appropriate technical word would be "Kalaayanee" sankhyaa. Other examples, nut and bolt (maNi-mekhalaa). rack and pinion (krakara-parNa), entropy (sankarataa), probability (pratyekataa). For magnet there is already word "Ayaskaanta" and no need to create kinky word "Cumbaka". For electricity there are four words, Tadit, Shampaa, Vidyut, and Saudaaminee. They show different attributes of electricity. I am notproposing to change the medium of instruction, just adding Sanskrit words in parenthesis is enough. The aim is to offer the knowledge behind the concept immediately. Indian phonetics and music has original Sanskrit terminology. In short this could be one of the ways to promote Sanskrit in sciences other than philosophy and linguistics. One has to show why Sanskrit words are better than English.Thanks. Please pardon me for a long e-mail. N.R.Joshi.
