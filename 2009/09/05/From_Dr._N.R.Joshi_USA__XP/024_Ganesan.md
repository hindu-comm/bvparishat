Dear Sanskrit lovers,

Along with what Mr. Rajendran has furnished as the most fundamental points of greatness of Sanskrit literature one may very well add the "storehouse of wise sayings" --सुभाषितभाण्डागार which I am sure no other literature of the world possesses. This itself should be the most abiding reason for studying the Sanskrit language. One may evensay that even with the absence of adequate texts on different branches of science, this 'storehouse' makes man wise in all the ways and guides him spiritually, encourages him to be 'really human' which the advance of so called modern science has totally failed as we are witnessing now.

I think it is enough if these 'subhashita' and the Upanishads are studied by all to be truly human and attain the divine.



With the best wishes,

Ganesan
