Dear friends: In addition to the reasons adduced by D C. Rajendran as to why one should study Samskrit I wish to add the following in the words of Swami Vivekananda. He said : "Even the Great Buddha took a wrong step in denouncing the use of Sanskrit and by encouraging the local language, to reach and teach people. Knowledge came to people (But what the Buddha taught was not something new. It was old wine in new bottles. The concept of Ahimsa which was already there in the scriptures was emphasizsed by him.) That was good. But the culture has gone, the beauty has gone, the prestige has gone. What sustains a nation is not a mere mass of knowledge but culture. So by refusing to employ Samskrt language, the Buddha denied to people the opportunity to know about their own glorious culture, which has withstood the ravages of times."  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Prof. Narasimhachary, Mudumby
