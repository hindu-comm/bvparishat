Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

I fully understand this is the list of scholars and there is no room for politics. But the posting of that Interfaith conference swami's talk inspired me to tell the truth.Please forgive me if I disturbed your sensitivities.

No use of Interfaith conference lecture by Chaturved swami. I am living USA many years. My information is directly from USA television, newspapers, magazines. During cold war years, there was the plan to convert the whole south-east asia and south India to create a group of Christian nations like Phillipines to oppose spread of communism. This plan was destroyed by defeat of USA in Vietnam. However although the danger of Soviet union has disappeared, desire of world dominance, looting other countries natural resouces by installing governments favorable to the interests of big corporations has not disappeared. It has appeared on US TV when Marcos was ruling Phillipines. US corporations were going there, telling farmers that they will buy their lands for plantations, and if farmer refused, he disappeared from this world next day and plantation was created anyway. Coroprate liers came on TV said they were following principles of free market. When Aquino (after Marcos gone) went to visit Japan, there were tears in her eyes. She said, "After world war II you and we started at the same time, see where you (Japan) are where we are (Phillipines). Do not forget south India has sea shore, easy for foreign marines to land. In short interfaith lectures by Indian swamis cannot convert corporate Thugs and their governments. They will convert south India. In the whole world no body sings in the loud voice, "Sarvepi sukhinah Santu.." except international loser called India.
