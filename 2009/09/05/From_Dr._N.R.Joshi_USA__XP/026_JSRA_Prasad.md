Dear Prof. Gauri Mahulikar,  
  
Namaste. Yes, I understood that the comments are not yours but compiled by others  
for the Sanskrit day purpose. I just expressed my concern over the generalization of  
the problem which is not 100% connected with Sanskrit. But that has definitely provided  
a room to revisit our strengths and weaknesses. I believe, no member of this forum  
will not offend on personal grounds on other members. Thank you very much. Also I  
thank the 'think tank' of our forum.  
  
Sincerely,  
Prasad
