Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

Mypurpose of writing about Ashvamedha, Purushamedha and Grihamedha was only semantics of the word "medha". I had no intention to discuss the ethical values of Vedas or Brahmanas.Others may have different thoughts in questioning meaning of Purushmedha' .

Pardon me please Dr. Dipaka Bhattacarya, I still do not understand when you wrote, "Purushmedha is not human sacrifice". Is Ashvamedha horse sacrifice (killing of horse in Yajnya)? You brought out difference between miyedha (juice) and medhas (worship).Grihamedhine is a householder (Grihaih, Daaraih medhante). The meaning of "medha" is retentive faculty and Medhaja is an epithet of Vishnu.

What I was saying that over centuries the meaning might have undergone changes. Although context (Sandarbha), Syntax (Anvaya) are important tools of comprehension, the Abhidhaa meaning of a word is the foundation of the language in my opinion. Rudhaartha can be different.

Then I added that etymologies of certain Sanskrit words is not straight forward from roots. I gave examples-Megha (cloud), Shaakhaa, (branch), Khara (rough), Khera (the sun), Ulkaa (meteorite), Ulookhala (threshing pit), Ambaa (mother), Pika(cuckoo). In case of etymology of the word 'ratha', I read, "Sthira-sthara-thara-and then by Varna Viparyaaya it becomes "ratha" (chariot). To me this method looks like forcing the etymology or nirvacan (whatever you call it). Even Yaaskafaced such problem. Since we do not know the ancient history of Sanskrit prior to say 700-800 BC, there could be other principles involved in semantics of Sanskrit roots or words. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
