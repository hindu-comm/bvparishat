The word Medha originally means: to crush particularly by cutting into pieces like Keemaa of the meat as it is preserved in mijjha in Pali and mijjha in Panjabi. It is quite possible that the word may mean to beat a person or a horse: it may result in death or not. Panjabi preserves both in an idiom: bakaraa rove jinda noon: kasaaii rove mijjha noon ( cf. Majjaa of the Ayurveda) i.e. a goat is weeping for the life whrereas a butcher is weeping for the grease out of it. That is why in Sastra, the words like himsaa, aalambhana, madmadaayita and medha are differentiated. Slowly the custom of killing a man or an animal developed which was interpreted as to kill or figuratively to kill different objects and identify with universe through the development of ethical values. Throughout the world civilization, killing of the animals cannot be ruled out. of it. I fail to understand why are we reluctant to accept thatIndian civilization including the seggaragated Sanskrit culture passed through all the phases and accepting only vegetarianism as a part of Indian civilization. Itis in the interest of understanding the subject and not the habits of the individual. I am myself a strict vegetarian but for the interpretation of the words, I am a non-vegetarian. Manu himself differentiated between a pravRtti and nivRtti ( na maaMsabhaksane.....). It is quite possible, in the emergency in the battle-field, the meat and majjaa of the horses was the need of the warriors. Bhiisma in the Mahaabhaarata tried to steal the meat of the dogs in emergency ( aapaddharma). Slowly becomes a social habit under the taste of the tongue. Scattered references may be collected, if needed. Regards,
