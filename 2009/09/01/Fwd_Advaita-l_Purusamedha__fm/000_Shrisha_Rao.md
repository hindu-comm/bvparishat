To: [adva...@lists.advaita-vedanta.org]()

  
Namaskaram,  
I am writing a thesis on certain elements of Yajur Veda and I am somewhat  
confused regarding the Purushamedha

It seems quite confusing as to where the Vedas stand on this issue. The  
Purusa-medha seems to strongly to suggest that in the Vedic period, human  
sacrifices were performed by Brahmanas. Many scholars say that the  
Purusa-medha was only symbolic and nobody was really killed. However, in the  
Satpatha Brahmana texts and also in Bhagavata Purana we find the story of  
Sunahsepha, who was chosen as a sacrificial victim by the brahmanas and was  
almost offered in sacrifice.

Anyhow, I am not interested in scholars speculations. I am more interested  
in what sampradayik Vaisnavas have to say on this matter. Could you find  
time to ask any Sri or Madhva scholars what the Purusa-medha was about and  
if anyone was actually sacrificed. If it was symbolic, how do we account for  
the story of Sunahsepha?

What do purvacaryas say about the Purusamedha?
