my wife archana has drawn my attention to an artical by prof. Shrimannarayanamurthy in his "methodology in indological research" (BVP delhi 1991) where he gave references to purushamedha in Vajasaneya samhita (30) and Taittiriya brahamana (3.4). 

  

He wrote, wrongly, "in this sacrifice involving butchering of not less than 184 persons according to VS and 178 persons according to TB , women are also included " (p.147). but he does not give exact sentece.

  

this is one of the wrong ways of research happening everywhere. you give a reference to something but dont quote exact sentence. what a hell?  
  

could somebody check the reference he cites VS 30.15 etc. or TB 3.4.19. he quotes one thing अथैतमारूपेभ्य आलभेत। अतिह्रस्वम् अतिदीर्घम् अतिकृशम् अत्यंसलम् अतिशुक्लम् अतिकृष्णम् अतिश्लक्ष्णम् अतिलोमशम् TB3.4.19. but it does not mean they are actually butchered. आलम्भन is sparsha only.
