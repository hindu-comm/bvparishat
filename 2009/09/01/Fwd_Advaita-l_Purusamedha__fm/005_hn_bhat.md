Thanks a lot Dr. Pandurangi.

It is now clear what Poorvacharya-s say in respect of Purushamedha sacrifice. This is what I also was expecting. From the quoted description, it concords with the Brahmana story also, in Yajurbrahmana: Prajapati was the deity for whom the sacrifice was offered and this Purushamedha is synonymous with Prajapatyeshti or at least is the sacrifice to the deity Prajapati according to the *Karkabhāṣya* quoted also.

Hey, there is something just now I notice in the quotation: *puruṣadevatābhyo juhoti* which makes imports something essential into the topic. Is it the elaborate form of Nryajna one of the *Pañcamahāya*j*ña-*s of a *Gṛhastha*? In other words, does the *Nṛ-yajña* symbolize the*puruṣamedha* which is meant for for a *brāhmaṇa* after which he is eligible to opt*pārivrajyā* setting aside the injunction of the scriptures on him binding life long to perform *Agnihotra* as per the *Karkabhāṣya* quoted. Anyway, in the absence of a commentary on the quoted portion, it is difficult to come to a conclusion. 

Thanks once again to Dr. Veeranarayana, for providing a tenable testimony for the existence of *puruṣamedha.* It would be helpful, if a commentary on the portion is also made available.
