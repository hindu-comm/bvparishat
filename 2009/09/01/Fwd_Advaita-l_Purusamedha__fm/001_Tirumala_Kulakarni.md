Sri Vishvanandana Theertha-ru is a highly qualified (Ph.D. from IISc, Bangalore 30 years ago, left his job, did svashaakhaa vedadhyayana and in later stage studied other three vedas, well versed in Vedanta-puraNa-itihaasa.) highly regarded by present generation Maadhva community.

  

I asked him about this issue. His answers are -

1\) Other than Itihaasa-ullekha there is no Saampradayik incidents of Purushamedha.

2\) Other ullekhas to be considered here are -

    a. \`abadhnan puruShaM paSum' in puruShasUta.

    b. In Chaandogyopanishat, while counting paMcha saama-s five types of havis is listed. Purusha is one of them.

    c. In Mahabharata, somewhere in Shantiparva or Anushaasanaparva a story of a king having 100 wives is narrated. There it is said that - he was suggested to sacrifice his one son to get more sons.

3\) By seeing these instances it seems there was Purushamedha, where a man was sacrificed. In Shunasshepa story it is clear.

4\) Certainly it was very rare. It seems people with special qualification were doing such Yajnas in old age. The time of the practice could not be decided.

  

The search for the word Purushamedha in Mahabharata gave this answer - (01090019C) यः पुरुषमेधानामयुतमानयत्.
