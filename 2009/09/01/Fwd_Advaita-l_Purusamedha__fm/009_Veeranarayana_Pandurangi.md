yes. that is why I said it was the tradition at katyayana's time. that may have changed in a very long time span. originally a human sacrifice, but changed gradually, to only "let him go". human sacrifice is certainly possible if we go by AB.

  

But I am not sure whether AB has anything to do with purushamedha. AB is totally different story of two individuals.purushamedha may be a legacy of SB and nothing has to do with human sacrifice.
