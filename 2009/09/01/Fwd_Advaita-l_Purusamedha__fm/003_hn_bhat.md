I had just referred to the story of Shunashepha to confirm my memory of reading it my childhood days. There are two similar versions of the story of Shunashepha one in the Devibhagavatha and the other in Ramayana Balakanda Sarga-s 61-62. As it happens, there is no mention of Pashumedha sacrifice at all. But in both it is a sort of "prayaschitta" act. In the Devibhagavatha, and others if any, it is Harischandra, the childless king of Ikshvaku dynasty, who had made an offer to give his son born to Varuna, which yielded and he got a son Rohithashva. Later, he evaded offering his son on being repeatedly reminded by Varuna in person and at last out of rage he cursed to be caught hold of j*alodara sickness* and so without way out of the sufferings, he was adviced to comply to his promise made to Varuna. The king unwilling to give up his son, sought some other means and at the suggestion by them, he sent people to get a boy in llieu of his son for any price and thus he bought Shunashepha. At this juncture, Vishvamithra teaches some mantra-s to him by reciting which Varuna was pleased and released Harischandra out of his pledge and sickness. Thus saved by Vishwamitra, Shunashepha became his dharma-putra, and himself authored many sections in the Rgveda on receiving training from the great sage. This is the brief story of Shunashepha in one version.

  

In the other, it is Ambarisha, who set out to perform 100th ashvamedha (which will qualify him to become eligible to enthrone to the seart of Indra) and terrified by this Indra stole his sacrificial horse. On the loss of the sacrificial ashva, he was adviced to sacrifice a human being, and on this search, also it was Shunashepha who was sold by his parents out of poverty. In this story also, Vishvamitra met him on their way to the Sacrificial place and preached two *mantra*-s by reciting which he pleased the gods and was relieved from being sacrificed. In both versions, the interpretation as *arthavada* used to glorify the great sages Vishvamithra and his *dharma-putra* shunashepa is clear. And does not necessarily hint the performance of so called *pashumedha.*

Now coming to the allusion, in *purushasookta*, the whole *sookta* is full of allegorical phenomenon as it seems it describes humanity as a whole and the parts of which are the four *varna*-s as envisaged in it. All the commentators, on the particular stanza where the allusion occurs, confirm this. The first creation, Purusha, was made the animal for the sacrifice, who was being described from the beginning of the *sookta* as*sahasrasheershah purushah sahasraakshah sahasrapaat*. and in no way the particular line alludes to a Purushamedha, not described in Dharmashastra texts. like "*Apastamba: Raajaa saarvabhaumo 'shvamedhena yajeta*" (in the case of Ashvamedha). All the commentators, including Sayana, Mahidhara, Mangalacharya and one modern Kamalakrishna describe it the word yajna allegorical : *yajnena = sankalpikena manasikena yajnena, yajam = tam yajnapurusham, ayajantha = poojitavantah, devaah .(the last rk of the sookta)* and elsewhere the same interpretation is offered.*

I could not check the Yajurveda episode. There also, the participants were gods or so. There also the possibility of being allegorical phenomenon cannot be ruled out.  

  

I also second Dipak bhattacharya's view. Further unmovable testimony is needed to arrive at a firm conclusion than speculations about human sacrifice.   

  

And one more thing, my google search brought several pages containing the discussion including Vikipedia also which precisely gave the explanation given by Vishvananda on being asked along with that of Grifith (1889) the translator of Vedic literature into English. I didn't quote Vikipedia, since its authority is not always based on reliable sources.  

  

Further opinions are solicited.
