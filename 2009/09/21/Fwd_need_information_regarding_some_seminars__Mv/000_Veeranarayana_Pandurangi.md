Dear Professor Pandurangi,  
  
I need some information so I wanted to sign up for the Google group Bharatiya-vidvat-parishat, but my request seems to have been turned down despite the fact I answered the questionnaire.  
So would you please be so kind to forward my query to the group on my behalf?  
  
Many thanks in advance!  
  
Best regards,  
Dmitry  
  
Here is the text of my query:  
  
Dear pandits,  
  
I'm very interested in getting information about meetings of traditional Indian scholars held in Tirupati (on Mimamsa), Sarnath (on Nyaya) and Kasmir University (on Kasmir). These meetings are mentioned in the book: **Saṃvāda, a dialogue between two philosophical traditions** / edited by Daya Krishna (page XIII):  
  
*Nyaya, Mimämsä and Kashmir Saivism were indicated as such areas where the work could first begin. Accordingly, meetings of outstanding traditional pandits in the field of Nyäya, Mimämsä and Kashmir Saivism were held at Sarnath, Tirupati and Srinagar respectively. The Nyäya meeting at Sarnath had the active organizational and financial support of the Tibetan Institute of Higher Studies and its Director, Prof. S. Rinpoche, who has always gone out of his way to support us in such activities. The meeting on Mimämsä at Tirupati was totally financed by the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan whose Director, Dr. Mandan Mishra, was one of the moving spirits behind all these activities and without his enthusiasm and support, not much would have been achieved as he knew practically everyone in the world of traditional scholarship in India and could bridge the gulf between us. The meeting on Kashmir Saivism had the organizational support of the Department of Sanskrit of the Kashmir University and of other scholars in the town.*  
  
Would you please be so kind to give any useful links or references? First of all, I'd like to have references to proceedings of these meetings, if those have ever been published. I'd be very grateful for any information.  
  
Yours truly,  
Dmitry
