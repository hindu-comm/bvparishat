Dear Jagannath,  
  
Language labs are developed mainly to monitor the speech. The lab will  
have a facility wherein the utterances of students are recorded and  
teacher can then listen to them and guide the students. Thus as you  
notice, it is independent of language, and the major focus is on  
pronunciation. Naturally it makes more sense to have such a facility  
for English like languages.  
  
The shiksha shastri wing of the Rashtriya Sanskrit University,  
Tirupati has a language lab. Similar language labs exist at various  
other institutes as well.  
  
A laboratory provides you a platform to experiment. An experiment is  
used to test a theory--to see how well the real world matches the  
theory. Experiments have been used for many years to help people  
understand the world around them.  
  
With the availability of computers which provides a suitable media to  
carry out language related experiments, now it is possible to set up a  
more meaningful lab. What is needed is to develop a suitable  
Linguistic Workbench, wherein students can carry out experiments  
related to their own language(of course provided various language  
analysis tools for that language exist).
