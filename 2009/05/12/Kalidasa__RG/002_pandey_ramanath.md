**The language structure of dramas of Kalidasa**



In the doctrine of ancient Indian dramaturgy among all kinds of composition the visual composition is more enjoyable, and even in these the dramatic composition is at the most. Because it consists all the elements of audio-visual both, and visuality is its uppermost quality. But, whatever is to be visualise in this, that is only the transcreation of audio, and audible which depends on the dialogue of various charecters. Therefore AcÈrya Bharata has discussed about the formation of dialogue in the context of *vÈcika-abhinaya -* verbal representation. Both the elements the constituents of composition and language are to be included in the body of dramatic art - *saŠvÈda-yojanÈ,* among these speech is the main elements of all.1 The language of dramatic art is not only the language of nouns, pronouns, and verbal terms like ordinary language. Though it is a combination of visual representation, gesture, costumes, make up alongwith the expression of emotions, but the linguistic expression is uppermost element by reason of it is the body of dramatic art. Indeed,whatever is to be performed visually on the state, they all depends on words by any means. Word is at the source (root) of everything. So, the language is that kind of element which lies in the origin of dramatic composition as well as of visual representation. The components of the poetical composition and visual representastion of dramatic art are only the constituents of language. The complete success depends only on its linguistic elements.1. *NÈtya„Èstra*-14/3, KÈvyamÈlÈ-No.42 by Pandit KedÈranÈth, Pub. SatyabhÈmÈbÈÏ PÈ‡Çurang, Bombay.

According to the KalidÈsa the composition of three *bhÈva, abhinaya* and *rasa* is *NÈ—ya*. The expressions of the sentiment of various characters in *nÈ—-ya* makes that representable, then only the *sah‚daya* spectators experience the *rasa* in the mind and they feel enjoyment. Therefore the sentiment is the chieftain in drama, and the language is the base of the expression of this sentiment. It become completely presentable only by the means of language. When the whole contemplation appears after manifestation at the stage of language that make ground for experiencing of *rasa.* In this process a dualistic relation establishes between language and sentiment where the stratagem of sentiment appears towards language and the stratagem of language appears towards sentiment. That's why the structure of the language is efficient in expressing the composition of feelings. The propoundation of style in composition *- NÈ—ya* *v‚ttis* in Indian dramaturgy*,* is a evidence of this. This is the meaning of the statement of Kalidasa that the composition of three *bhÈva*, *abhinaya* and *rasa* is *NÈ—ya.*

**Be it ordinarily spoken language or dramatic language, the primary objective is the expression of various ideas or thoughts. That is why KÈlidÈsa has, in his composition, used different kinds of languages spoken by various characters. The scientific study of the languages used by various characters reveals that these languages have a superficial meaning and, as mush they are denotative, informative, communicative, that much they are indicative and suggestive. All others are its supporting elements but real dramatic elements exists in indicativness and suggestive. In the *Malvikagnimitram* (2/8) the gestures and various movements of different organs of the body while Malvika is dancing, express spontaneously and dramatically the various emotions and thoughts originating in her mind. By means of her dance, she has been able to give language to her organs, giving them a linguistic form, it facilitated the expression of all the emotions spontaneously*.*

In this way, Kalidasa has interpreted the vivid kind of language by means of dance. According to Kalidasa, organic (È×gika), natural (sÈtvika ) and artificial (ÈhÈrya) all the three kinds of acting embody in themselves all aspects of verbal communication. Therefore in *KumarsambhavaŠ* (7/90,91), he discussing all the components of dramas, calls it sentiment of love etc. (*„‚×gÈrÈdi*), enriched with magnificence emotions and connected with all the five Junctures (sandhi) of a dramas at the same time, ornamented with language and style. Although the language of Kalidasa is not only the language of combination of the terms of nouns, pronouns and verbs just like ordinary language, it is also the combination of the creation of visible, acting, movement and other amusing elements. But, the main importance which lies in his linguistic expression is indispensable. As a matter of fact that whatever to be presentable on the stage in the form of visualisation
all are dependent on terms by any means. All the poetic or amusing elements are the elements of language because the complete success depends on it.

Each language has own structure. This is that kind of element which provide meaning to that. The language has own process in its origin which constituted by various linguistic units. This kind of constitution elucidate the grammatical structure formed by verbal units and their composition. The linguistics structure is full of variousness due to his creativity. As far as Drama is concerned it is more describable as it is quiet near to transaction of speech - *vÈgvyavhÈra*. As a matter of fact, the language structure is the main cause of successful and unsuccessful of any kind of drama. Although, the ancient *AcÈryas* have not discussed about the importance of language separately, but they have indicated the significance of this in the context of verbal acting. *AcÈrya* Bharata has high lighted about the both the elements of language and means other than the language in the context of drama. He has stated about the linguistic structure of dramatic art which is pleasure and beneficial for spectators that the structure of language should be so simple

The Dramatic representation of Kalidasa is unique one, it is unique in that sense because here the means other than speech including language is possessed of in same capabilities, and the visualization is its uppermost quality. That's why the drama is a divine sacrifice that pleasing to the eyes of the gods; Rudra has divided it into two parts tandava and lasya in his own person which is blended with that of Uma. Therefore it is a vivid kind of amusement for the persons possessed of different tastes or sentiments, its mean that various kind of enjoyment can be achieved only in one place i.e. ceremony of Natya.

*devÈnÈmidamÈmananti munayaÌ kÈntaŠ kratuŠ cÈk–u–aŠ,*

*rudre‡damumÈk‚tavyatikare svÈŠge vibhaktaŠ dvidhÈ.*

*traigu‡yÈdbhavamatra lokacaritaŠ nÈnÈrasaŠ d‚„yate nÈ—yaŠ*

*bhinnarucerjanasya bahudhÈpyaekaŠ samÈrÈdhanaŠ.*

* **MÈlavikÈgnimitraŠ***(1/4)

According to him the *NÈ—ya* is a composition of three : *bhÈva* -entering with feeling into each emotional situation, *abhinaya* - visual representation, and *rasa* presenting it with sympathetic imagination.

After the discussing one by one the various constituents of language structure of dramas of KÈlidÈsa, it is inevitable to analyse his language in its entirety. Although it is distinctly visible through all linguistic components, but it also maintains own existence separately. Various linguistic components such as sound, syllables, word, term, sentence etc. represents more and more grammatical aspects of the language structure of his dramatic compositions. But they do not distinct so much the appearance of dramatic visualization. Infact the language structure of his dramas is language of intuitive illumination, but not of intellect, and rather aesthetics one than intellectual. Therefore it is quiet difficult to understand the perfectly and real conversancy of his language of dramatic representation merely on the basis of division of grammatically constitutions. Indeed, the structural acquisition of language of dramas of KÈlidÈsa can be tasted even through the reading of his dramatic compositions. But evidence of various characteristic based on verbal activities can be observed merely through visualization on dramatic stage, whereas tune, reverberation of meaning, and reciting style take away the language beyond the grammatical meaning. The expressive accomplishment of the language of his dramas are based on art of visual representation.

KÈlidÈsa has formed the linguistic structure of his dramatic composition after keeping in the mind the colloquial of various characters. Therefore there is uppermost contribution of the visual elements. The language of his dramatic composition is the relation of each other of
elements of visual representation. Even the syntactical, and also colloquial structure is a kind of expression of that interrelation. This is the reason that the syntax of his speech is not so linguistics as much as they are based on expressions and feelings of the characters. The constituents of the expressions, feelings and embellishment of syntax are the similar. The constituents of verbal sounds, compound words, sentence, and compound sentence originates a state of collective existence after the associating with larger constituent. In the result of this the fragementation of main meaning and expressive feelings of sentences originates the suggestive meaning which is the soul of the linguistic structure of KÈlidÈsa.The intonation, equivocation - indirect mode of expression, sound and dramatic gesticulation *etc.* are depends on style of revelation which express the objective of eloquent in
natural form. There are peculiar constitutional power of the performing elements of speech on the stage which facilitates also the possibilities of other meanings than denotative one. Therefore the study of the language structrure of dramas of KÈlidÈsa on the language point of view reveals that the constitutional entirities of all the complex formations in addition to words to sentence, and sentence to combination of syntax or whole text are to be considered. **
