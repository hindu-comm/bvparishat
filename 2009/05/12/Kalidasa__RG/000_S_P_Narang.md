with regards to all the members. Here is a request. I am finalizing the 2nd vol. of Kalidasa Bibliography. The work in hand is "Bibliography of the Bibliography" which includes Kalidasa. Any information with yourself ( except Libraray of Congress) which is with yourself or any of your friend, disciple, known scholar or any other source shall be highly appreciated and acknowledged with thanks at the publication. It shall help me to bring the information uptodate and wider in range. I hope my request will be appreciated and replied. Regards in anticipation: Sincerely, SP Narang
