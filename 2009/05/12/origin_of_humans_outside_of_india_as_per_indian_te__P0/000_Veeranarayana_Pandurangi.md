सर्वेभ्यो नमः

I am now thinking of origin of humans in india as well as other countries. since all the indian texts like smrtis and puranas describe the origin of humans (of four varnas and other anuloma-pratiloma types) through the brahma and prajapatis and other rshis etc. but they dont talk much about the origin of humans in other countries like africa andaman and nicobar etc. I will be gratefull if any one of you show refereces to it.
