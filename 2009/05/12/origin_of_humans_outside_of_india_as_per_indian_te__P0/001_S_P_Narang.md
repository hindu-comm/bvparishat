When we talk of Africa etc. it is a matter of antiquity whereas the Smrtis and their compilation including the Puranas is quite later. Institutions are made quite later. But the poets like Bana, remember the framing of the institutions and their antiquity. e.g. Kadambari: prajaapatimapramaaNikurvataa bhagavataa agninaa samaalingitadehaam (In the context of Candaala Kanyaa)indirectly speaks that in antiquity institutions were based on physical beauty whereas Prajaapati created the institutions and adhered to it. it is quite possible the Pravaras were to protect and preserve the blood particularly its purity( pra+root vR).Both in Smritis and Puranas we will find contradictory statements which are different in systems and do not belong to homogenous thought. In this regards, they are less explored. Prabandhas are also very important particularly in the medieval ages for the influx of the castes etc. You can see the influence of the medieval ages in one of my student's thesis: Published: Oxford: India. Name: Mathur, Ashu Dayal..He is in St. Stephens College Delhi, Reader of Sanskrit. He has traced a number of historical, anthropological and social aspects of the influx including the local law and law prevelant in the Mughal courts. Explore the details. Best wishes, SP Narang
