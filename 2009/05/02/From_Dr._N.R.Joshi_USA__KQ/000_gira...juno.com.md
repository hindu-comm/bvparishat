Congratulations to Dr. V.V.S. Sarma for compiling a good paper on Udyana and Swat valley. It is timely paper as Talibanization continues in Pakistan. Taliban terrorists started auctioning of emeralds mined from Swat valley. No doubt that Swat valley was integral part of the ancient Indian history. Hungarian archaeologist Aurel Stein did lot of exploration in this area. Even more interesting areas are beyond Swat valley to the northwest and then northeast and in Central Asia. Last week I saw archeological artifacts from Afghanistan on display in Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. A lot of archeological excavation had been performed in northern Afghanistan. In exhibition one can seefoldable gold crown, gold bangles, Indian Ivory carvings, river goddess on Makara, and above all belt gold buckles of Asian Amazons (mummies discovered in Taklamakan).There is more Mahabharata historybeyond Khyber pass. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
