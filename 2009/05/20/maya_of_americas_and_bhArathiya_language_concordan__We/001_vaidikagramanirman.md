An improvement to k-raman-2.ods pANiNi dhAtupATha with english  
meanings is being uploaded in the files section - this has columns for  
the first five single letters of transliteration text. This faclitates  
building up search systematically and also enabling understanding and  
seeing the beauty of construction of akshara -  
  
For example -  
  
meyaj oficio, cargo  
meyaj trabajo  
  
the first Maya enty means - office - position of a person (high  
ranking)in spanish  
  
And the second means conjoint work being done by people, enterprise  
  
The dhAtu based build up of the word from dhAtu pATha is  
  
me\_ {}to return, to exchange; deri. mita, nima_ya, nimitya, apamitya,  
apama_ya, ma_tum #me\_ yaj {}to make an oblation to a deity, to  
associate with, to sacrifice, to worship, to give; deri. is.t.a,  
yas.t.avya, ya_jya, yas.t.um, samijya, is.t.va\_  
  
withoverall understanding of an official that is respected - thus it  
is honorific.  
  
The second word with same pronounciation but meaning differently as  
enterprie and work is  
  
me\_ {}to return, to exchange; deri. mita, nima_ya, nimitya, apamitya,  
apama_ya, ma_tum # yuj {}to unite, to bind, to yoke; deri. yukta # yuj  
{}to meditate, to curb one's mind, to concentrate the mind; deri.  
yukta; yo_gya or yo_jya; yo_ktum; yuktva\_ # yuj {}to join, to unite,  
to apply, to use, to meditate, to concentrate the mind, to prepare, to  
grant, to intend # yuj {}to bind, to restrain #  
  
This is related to yojana -  
  
I will publishing my work - one of these days with possible title  
"know your roots"
