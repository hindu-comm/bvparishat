namaste,



1\) please find attached kaufman's preliminary mayan etymological dictionary can be down loaded from



[http://www.famsi.org/reports/01051/index.html](http://www.famsi.org/reports/01051/index.html)



thislistsmore than hundred mayan dialects. I have put this in analyzable openoffice.spread sheet format s



2\. Dr.S.kalyanraman ji's lexicon bharathi available at hindunet and scribd has also been put in analyzable openoffice.spread sheet format



this monumental work by [dr.kr](http://dr.kr/) ji has been arranged in svara vya\~jana formats with over 600 columns for filtering and search and statistical analysis.



3\. I have similarly putin analyzable format monier williams dictionary and dr.kalyanrAman ji's compiled format dhAtu pATha - which Isend to you.



In MW alone there are more than 6000 works and authors mentioned in the text as N.of work, author, commentator so on. The direct abbreviations and reference list runs into more than 600. These have been extractedby me. And am formatting for easy analysis and reading. Among these are grammarians galore.



A comparitive study of etymologies of mAya, Indian languages, along with pANiNi and the wonderful Tolkiappan and so called dravidian languages throws up a number of issues that can be tribute to Sri.P.N.Oak and world vedic heritage. The divergence - from proto so called aryan "vedic" from Indo Europe (whatever that is) so much "bull".



If anybody the scholars can explain why there is not a single word beginning with "jha" in any of theveda mantra but relative presence in plenty in ramayaNa and mahabhAratha such as "jhankAra" - "jhillika" etc. (I have Blumfeld'svedic concordance too in spreadsheet) in which there is only one word - and that too is marked as mis pronounciation /spelling.This isthe beginning of knowing more truths. After all when the veda is the source of everything and why not the "jha" word?.

So it appears that there could have been some that did not or could not have these words. pre historic politics of the veda is quite well known such as the difference in the yajurveda -or rather politics oftaittrIya and vAjasneya saMhita.the vocubalary of the taittrIyais larger. Thiisindicates preservation of the veda by different intra bhArat schools None less than the other in dedication.



very surprisingly there is an entry that reads "The Earth is his Feet" this has dejavu of the puruSha sUktam - one - An interesting concordance feature in maya are the suffixes :-

|         | |:--------| | s       | | vi      | | pt      | | aj = a: | | vt      |



migration is a fancy theory for "the answer to everything in evolution", but in my opinion more relevant to birds. To me IT IS migration of the continents that is more plausible and cataclysmic events at the end ofyugas asknown by hindus - and the maya in americas.



It is ironical and sarasvati's strange vid that sanskrit is better understood by study of tamil, telugu, tulu, kannada, konkani and marathi. i might as well include the malayali.



And to understand tamil better - study of sanskrit tamil, telugu, tulu, kannada, konkani and marathi. i might as well include the malayali bengali punjabi etc.



And to understand all these better study of the Mayan language of americas is needed.



My work on the svara part of Mayan etymology of more than hundred languages is showing an amazing 70 - 80 % concordance of maya and the Indian languages. Of course my work is slow as I am enjoying it - most definitely I need no Ph.d - for me knowing the truths.



my work and focus is for bhArath only and resolve dichotomies if any for myself in the truths of the veda vAkya - and my heritage.



regards
