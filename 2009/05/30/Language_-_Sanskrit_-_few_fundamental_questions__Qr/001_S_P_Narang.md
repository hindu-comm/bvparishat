sir, Will you consult besides Palsule's work: Saini, suman on dhatupatha and its semantics ( Hindi) where most of the roots have been classified on the basis of the meaning and compared with Modern Indian Language particularly meaning in comparison and contrast. It was done under my supervision. The person is employed at Karnal. Try to search the book. Regards, spnarang
