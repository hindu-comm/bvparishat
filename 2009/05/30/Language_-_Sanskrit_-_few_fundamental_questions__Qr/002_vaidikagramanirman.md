namaste narang ji,  
  
thank you. it would be very interesting reading. I would appreciate  
your comments on my approach.  
  
1. vinak is Mayan word for Human, people, Man, person -  
  
Judging from history been taught then and now, pANiNi had no clue at  
all that millions of yet undiscovered peoples use his dhAtu based  
phonemes and lexemes on a day to day basis and have been using it  
since time began for them. His work does not seperately discuss known/  
unknown languages then. Rather it appears an outstanding attempt to  
within quotes "sanskritize" the fundamentals of speech - the dhAtu.  
His knowledge of Tolkiappan or earlier grammarians from different time  
and space zone is not mentioned in his known works.  
  
vinak - word of Maya has very great probability - of being related to  
vinakti - meaning sifting winnowing fanning also meaning discernment.  
This is secondary and not direct information from pANiNi  
  
Atharva veda is mentioned to have used vivinakti  
  
  
  
pANiNi's dhAtupATha does not have vin (anything) as dhAtu. The n  
(nasal) could have morphemes that can be searched with dhAtu pAtha  
with svara indications.  
  
The most likely candidate is vij vij to separate; to divide; to  
distinguish; to discern; deri. vikta;  
  
Tha vikta and vinak are related through the dhAtu vij needs  
colloborative proofs or rther substantiating material to be any where  
within sight of pANiNi's methodicity  
  
vil vil to cover; to conceal  
vil vil to throw; to cast

2. It was most interesting for me to know that pAli mans a bridge in  
Bharatiya language and that strikes bells - with coonotations for pAli  
the language is this a bridge over distance or bridge over time or  
both.  
  
great regards
