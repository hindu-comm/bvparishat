namaste,  
  
1. two words meaning squash - melon in Maya language in the Americas  
are  
  
\[tz'i:b' inh k'u:m\] and \[tz'i:b' inh ti+ k'u:m\] ... transliteration  
scheme of Americans  
\[z iHbh inh khuhm\] \[z iHbh inh ti khuHm\] ... transliteration scheme -  
Baraha  
  
pANiNi dhatu based on closest phonetics (sounds like ) for these are  
  
1. \[tz'i:b'\] meaning writer - sculptor painter in Maya is  
  
pANiNi dhatu :- jIv{}ji_v{}to live, to revive, to live upon #  
{writer - sculptor painters revive - keep alive !}  
  
2. \[inh\] meaning ... (can state after more search in Maya dictionaries  
and lexicons )  
  
pANiNi dhatu :-#In{}i_n{}to endeavour; to obtain; to aim at; to  
wish#Inv{}Inv{}to pervade; to please; to be satisfied##  
  
3. \[inh ti\] meaning ... most likely is \[inTi\] meaning Sun  
  
pANiNi dhatu :- iNT{}iNT{}in.t.{}to have superhuman faculties; to be  
powerful #  
# indh{}indh{}to shine; to kindle; indhe\_; e_ndham; indha_m; indhi_ya#

in this e_ndham; is the most like dhAtu for the Telugu word for  
Sunshine.  
  
This is one example of thousands that a Dravidian language using a  
Sanskrit word that has vedic roots in common parlance that "Sanskrit"  
within quotes does not use for common parlance. And most significantly  
Mayas of South Americas doing so too.  
  
They say "one swallow does not a summer make" - Sure - but if you turn  
your eyes away and do not see the flock following the leader  
swallow ....
