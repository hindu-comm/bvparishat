Dear Sir

As far as my knowledge is concerned the word is primarily used in the sense of text only. The one which has got grathana(texture)is grantha(text).Granthagranthih iha kvacit kvacidapi nyaasi prayatnanmayaa

(end of Naisadham). Granthi means knot. Here the example is ceto nalam kamayate madiyam -- cetah

nalam, cetah analam, cetah na lankam etc..Granthasandarbha etc. are usages. Grantham anusarati

means - continues (resumes) with the earlier text.



thanking you
