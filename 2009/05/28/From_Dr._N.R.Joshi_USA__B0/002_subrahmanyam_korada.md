Namo vidvadbhyah



The need of Sphota - yes, it is responsible for the conjuction of the Varnas with the memory of the disappeared varnas to generate the meaning. It is , as I have already suggested, is the base of Dhvani/Vyangya(suggested meaning) and useful not only to account for the understanding of a sentence but also for a faithful rendering by both man and machine(needs elaboration, I worked with Anusaraka Group in Machine Translation from Telugu to Hindi but since a Machine does not posses Natural Buddhi nor can we inject /insert the same it is not possible, that'swhy Anusaraka not Anuvada).  
  
In the available Veda(out of 1137 Sakhas) Sphota is not propounded and we have to believe the words of

Rsis, Yogins etc.who handed down to us, just like Yoga and Ayurveda (Medicine and Surgery)etc. through

Yogipratyaksa ( I detailed the concept in my forthcoming book , viz. Pramanas in Indian Philosophy).



Before going to discuss the 'so called difference ' among Panini etc. I would like to sincerely request all

concerned to aquire knowledge of , as the Tradition demands, Padavakyapramanasastras, i. e. Vyakarana,

Nyaya and Mimamsa, from the Original Texts (not merely Translations) with the help of a qualified Guru.

Bhartrhari's popular verse (end of Vakyakanda of Vakyapadiya) is here --



prajna vivekam labhate bhinnaih agamadarsanaih

kiyadva sakyamunnetum svatarkamanudhavata ?



The term Sabda denotes the following meanigns -- varnah, prakrtih,pratyayah, padam,vakyam, avantaravakyam(sub-sentence), mahavakyam (Discourse), para,pasyanti,madhyama(sphota),vaikhari,

dhvanih, sabdapramanam, kavyam etc.(pl see my Engl Trans. Brahmakanda , Vakyapadiyam - Sadguru Publ.).

Padavakyapramanasastras discuss almost all the things. Following the dictum, pradhanyena vyapadesa bhavanti, the disignations are given - padasastra etc.

Padam is defined by Vyakaranam(suptinantam padam). Nyaya also defines (te vibhaktyantah padam) and

it is just repetition.

The definition of a vakya is offered by Purvamimamsa (Vedanta follows) -- arthaikatvadekam vakyam

sakanksam cedvibhage syat. The two definitions of a vakya offered under samarthah padavidhih (Pan 2-1-1)

by Katyayana, akhyatam savyayakarakavisesanam and ekatin are exclusively for Vyakaranaprakriya,i.e.

nighatayusmadasmadadesah. In general (see Vakyakanda of Vakyapadiyam) Vaiyakaranas also follow

Jaimini's definition (that is applicable to both Vakya and Mahavakya). Akanksa only is mentioned as the

other two,i.e. Yogyata and Asatti , are implied. Compare with 'vibhasa sakankse' and 'na yadi' of Panini

which are meant for the analysis of a Mahavakya.



Panini's Astadhyayi deals with varna, pada,vakya and mahavakya. It is
sabdanusasanam and not arthanusasana. Carthe dvandvah means the dvandva that is used in cartha is sadhu etc.

The number of vakyas and padas is innumerable and (see Paspasa and beginning of Manjusa) therefore

Panini resorted to the device of prakrti-pratyaya-vibhaga. There is no difference of opinion among

grammarians in terms of word or sentence. It may be vyutpattipaksa and avyutpattipaksa (derivation annon-derivation) but Panini followed both.



The definition of Navyanaiyayikas , i.e. saktam padam , has got its roots in Mahabhasyam -- sarve sarvapadadesah (see dadhaghvadap, here padam means prakrti or pratyaya, also under uran raparah).



Thanking you
