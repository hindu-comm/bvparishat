With regards to all: Perhaps, it is identifying varna and sabda which according to a few are different and not suitable to sankara. In samasti vyasti Brahman is the only entity and not two. But sabdavaadins accept 2 entities: but Bhartrihari accepts sabdabrahman as one and sabda as its viviarta VP I.1 although a great controversy has been raised by commentators. its variant is parinamate also which is suitable to samkhya but has no relation to Sabda. Non difference between Varna and Sabda for the unity of entity is suitable both to Mimamsa and Sankara as an Advaitavaadin. That is why they are remembering Upavarsa with respect. Instead of being a proper name, it appears to be a doctrinal name. It is the Cloud and rain simile which is known in the system of Sabdabrahmavaadins. It may be: Balaahaka Varsa nyaaya. The rains are an inseparable part of the cloud which is suitable to sankara for Brahma and Jagat inseparable. A few further studies may be useful from Potter's Bib.
