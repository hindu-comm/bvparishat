Respected scholars, Namaskara!



While appreciating Dr, Narang, Dr. Korad Subrahmanyam and other scholars for responding to my question on the utility of Sphota, I forgot to mention the name of Dr. C. Rajendran. I apologize for the mistake. 



I am familiar with theories of languages from the western world. As a matter of fact I read development of linguistics in European world in the past 400 years. It is interesting to watch their journey from Tower of Babel to Discovery of Sanskrit to Chomskyan deep structure and surface structure. However I would like to attract attention to the remark of Dr. Eivind Kahrs in his book, “The Indian semantic analysis-The nirvacana tradition” (1998-Cambridge Univ). He says on p.24, “Ironically, it was the very discovery of the Sanskrit language which provided European philologists with the necessary material for developing the ideas of comparative philology. Indeed one obtains a poor understanding of Indian linguistics if one approaches that field with the ideas of Indo-European comparative philology in mind.” I would like to follow his approach in discussing sphota doctrine strictly within the ancient Indian paradigm.



I respect Indian Guru-shis’ya tradition of acquiring knowledge. I also understand Vedic and Sanskrit are languages of ancient Indian scriptures revered by millions. However I would like to discuss sphota strictly from the point of view of linguistics without bringing into picture high level religious concepts of Brahma, Shabda-brahma, Naada-brahma etc. I would like to limit myself only to Abhidha meaning and exclude LakshaNaa andVyanjanaa (poetic and metaphorical). Next I would like to limit myself to Vaikhari. As described by other scholars the word “shabda” has many meanings, I would like to limit myself to the meaning of shabda as a word-an articulated word as opposed to unarticulated shabda (like dripping of water).



After making my position clear I would like to raise the question. On the page

p.48 (The book The Sphotanirnaya Chapter XIV of the VaiyaakaraNabhoos’aNasaara) of Kaunda Bhatta by S.D.Joshi 1967) S. D. Joshi explains, “According to Bhartrihari the term vyakti-sphota does not exist. For him, vyaktis are always sounds and jaati is the sphota. On page 53, sphota is opposed to dhvani as a class to individuals.”



Now imagine a situation where a man, a woman and a child are talking in a room. In the neighboring room the second man listens to them without seeing them. He recognizes when the same word uttered by a man, when uttered by a woman and when uttered by a child. This is so because the man has low frequencies, woman and child have higher frequencies in their voice. So here are three different dhvanis but one single sphota. The listener does not have to know the meaning of the word. He still recognizes the single word sphota behind three different dhvanis. Thus there are three vyakti dhvanis but one jaati sphota. Once we accept this explanation, all mystery around sphota disappears. The sphota of a shabda may have meaning or may not have meaning. In short dhvanis are phonetic variations of single sphota of the uttered word. I am using the word dhvani to mean physical sound without any metaphorical meaning. The same logic could be extended to pada-sphota, and vaakya-sphota. Now I will wait for your resonses. Thanks. N. R. Joshi
