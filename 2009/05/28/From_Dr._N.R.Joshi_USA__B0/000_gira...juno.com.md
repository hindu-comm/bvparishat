Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I am thankful to Prof. Narang, Prof. Korad Subrahmanyam, Dr. Ramanath Pandey, Prof. V. N. Zha, and Dr. B .N. Patnaik for responding to my question on utility of Sphota doctrine in Sanskrit linguistics, We all know that Shankaracharya refuted Sphota in line with Purvamimansa. Shankaracharya and Shabar both refer Upavarshacharya in respectful terms. Did Upavarshacharya propose the theory different from Sphota? What did he propose to get such honor from both Shankar and Shabar ? Usually a line is quoted like “VarNA eva to Shabdah iti Bhagavan Upavarshaah” in connection to him. What did it mean? Thanks.

N. R. Joshi.
