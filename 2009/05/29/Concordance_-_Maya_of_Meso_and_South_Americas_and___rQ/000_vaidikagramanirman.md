Abstract  
  
An amazing concordance between the Mayan languages of South and Meso  
America and  
Bharat-indian languages is found.  
  
The concordance is established by statistical analysis:-  
  
1.The likelihood of chance favouring concordance is worked out.  
2.The pattern of concordance is analyzed - Early Sanskrit - Veda and  
later forms. So called Dravidian Tamil - Telugu, Kannada, Tulu,  
Konkani and other Bharath - India language linkages.  
3. The work shows substantial significant concordance with Sanskrit  
and Sanskrit based langages as analysed with Panini's DhatuPatha.  
4. Significant concordance is also found with so called Dravidian  
languages Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Tulu and often tribal languages of  
the Sub continent.  
  
From the Concordance in the first place to any Bharat-Indian language  
and furthermore concordance patterning with a wide spectrum of India's  
languages presents a number of significant issues for consideration.  
  
1. The Mayans of South and Meso America had lived in an ecological  
niche and isolation till about only 400 years back.  
2. That their language can be amenable to the Barakhadi - phonetic  
classification system of India could show a universal application of  
the system to any phonetically based language that may not even have a  
script. The Barakhadi system is essentially taught as svara (so called  
vowels) a A i I u U Rr RU Lu LU e E o O au aM aH. and vya\~jjana (ka  
kha ga gha \~g ca cha ja jha \~j Ta Tha Da Dha Na ttha da dha na p pha  
ba bha ma ya ra la va sha sa ha) to children from age of learning in  
India.  
3. The e E and o O svara differentiation in so called Dravdian  
languages is also present in Maya. This is notably absent in so called  
Aryan language - Sanskrit and derivatives.  
4. Highly significant is absence of "ga" "ja" vya\~jjana in Mayan as  
recorded by the Spanish earlier and now American researchers and  
missionaries roman script transliterations. This is very much like the  
absence of ka ga non differntiation in written script of Tamil.  
  
  
  
Surpringly this causes problems also. The well known New World animal  
"jaguar" - is not appparently called that at all and recorded  
variously as tiger and lion equivalents in Spanish. Incidentally,  
Panini dhAtu for this is jagRu - meaning be awake, be cautious so on.  
  
  
3. The presence of pan continental - Americas and India language  
linkage leads to the issue of "when?" - the time scales of the contact  
and divergence of the civiliazations in different ecological niches.  
  
  
4. While considerable debate is on of Aryan invasion and Sanskrit and  
Dravidian in the sub continent. The presence of both the Vedic  
Sanskrit linkages and Dravidian language linkages in the Mayan  
language may well imply Aryan Invasion Theory of India needing  
reconsideration.  
  
  
  
We would then need an Aryan invasion Theory for the Americas too. And  
also an earlier Dravidian Invasion from the sub continent to the  
Americas or vice versa.  
  
5. Possibilities are also discussed whether the yuga concept of  
Bharath is not an unconsiderable sealed avenue for investigating the  
history of this billion year old planet. Pre Columbian Maya have  
timescales of cataclysmic cycles on Earth that approximate the Hindu  
timescales.  
6. Further work suggestions are given for study of Maya - India  
astrology,astronomy maths and pre colony religion concordance. Maya  
people references are many in Veda and based ancient literature in  
India. Suryasiddhantha - by MayAsura may well have been an ancient  
Maya astronomer astrologer. In Ramayana - Keikeyi is mentioned as a  
Mayan princeess. And so is Mandodari - the wife of Ravana.  
  
  
  
7. Particularly - archeo astronomy of the Maya from their unique as  
yet undiscovered perspective is of very great significance because of  
their unique geographical positions with perspectives of the Equator  
and Southern hemisphere too where star formations are different.

Materials and Methods  
  
The distinguished Maya linguist, Terrence Kaufman compiled A  
PRELIMINARY MAYAN  
ETYMOLOGICAL DICTIONARY (Copyright 2003)posted at FAMSI website  
<http://www.famsi.org/reports/01051/index.html>.  
  
This lists about 168 Maya languages and covers almost the entire  
geographic  
areas of South and Meso America where Maya is spoken even today. More  
than  
40,000 Maya words are categorized into 48 Main Semantic categories and  
a number  
of sub categories.  
This is a reasonable represenation of the spectrum of Mayan languages  
spoken in  
Meso and South America.  
  
  
Spanish English and English Spanish dictionaries used were mostly from  
Freelang dictionary downloaded from  
  
<http://www.freelang.net>  
  
  
  
and also inbuilt facilitty for Spansih Thesaurus inclusion in  
OpenOffice.org obtained from [www.openoffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org)  
  
  
  
Besides [openoffice.org](http://openoffice.org) - and pDF files made of spreadsheets - notepad+  
+ from  
  
<http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/>  
  
were used for search sorting filtering on different criteria  
  
  
Lexicon Bharathi compiled by Dr.S.Kalyanraman has about 8300 Main  
semantic clusters compiled covering 128 India related languages. A  
total of more tha 2,17,700 entries are in this lexicon. The semantic  
clusters in this compilation is grouped into naturally phoentic  
clusters adopting a slightly modified Barakhadi system having svara  
(equivalent to vowel sounds - a A i I u U e E ai o au and vya\~jjana  
(equivalent to conconant sounds such as ka kha ga gha \~g ca  
cha ja jha \~j Ta Tha Da Dha Na - ta tha da dha na pa pha ba bha ma ya  
ra la La va sha Sha sa ha).  
  
  
  
Such an arrangement in the Lexicon Bharathi shows phonetically close  
series such  
as {ka ga kha gha} need not necessarily have semantic difference by  
their usage  
in words in many contexts in many languages including Tamil.  
2. Similarly phonetically close {ca cha ja jha} need not necessarily  
have  
semantic difference by their usage in words in many contexts in many  
languages  
including Tamil.  
3. And so also phonetically close {pa ba and va} vya\~jjana (consonant)  
4. ra and la is also pronounced/mispronounced depending on the  
language or  
dialect without making difference to semantic content of the word.  
5. The nasal (\~g) of the ka series, (\~j) of the ca series (Na) of the  
Ta series  
are also not critical to conveying the meaning of a word for example  
j\~jnAna may  
be pronounced gyAna.  
  
References cited in Lexicon Bharathi include 206 works. Particulary  
notable  
inclusions are Veda samhita and vedanga, Ramayana Mahabharata, Purana.  
Other  
lexicons include some tribal languages. Additionally significant is  
inclusion of  
225 Tamil language references. This enables analysis of a reasonable  
representation of panaroma of languages in India  
  
2206 "dhatu" - compiled by Panini, the renowned ancient Sanskrit  
grammarian with  
English meanings were compiled by Dr.Kalyanraman in e format and put  
up on the  
web.  
  
All the above were put in Openoffice.org standard spreadsheets.
