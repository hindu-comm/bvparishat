it is difficult to substantiate or think.

it is true that more madrassas are funded than sanskrit universities. but then all the madrassas are full quite contrary to sanskrit universities. moreover these sanskrit universities are funded by UGC also. UGC is same to all. fullfill the crieteria get funds.



I doubt our authorities think sanskrit universities a vote bank thing, like the funding of other  
religious institutions like madrassas etc. But there is no dearth of funding for sanskrit universities from Central government. but that is true for state govts.
