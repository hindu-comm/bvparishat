Dear scholars,  
  
I get to hear many times that the govt of India is not interested in funding the sanskrit universities, but they provide more funding n other religious institutions.  
  
Is there is some data or factsheet that summarizes the number of Sanksrit and related institutions of Hindus that are funded by the goverment? How much funding do they receive? And how does these funding compare with other religious funding from the goverment.  
  
thanks,  
Vishwesha
