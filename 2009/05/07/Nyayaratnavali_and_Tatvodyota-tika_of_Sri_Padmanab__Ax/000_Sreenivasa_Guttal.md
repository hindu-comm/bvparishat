NamaskAra,

  

\|\| Nandamunisandohastho narasiMhaH prIyatAm \|\|

  

We are pleased to announce the availability of Nyayaratnavali (Vishnutattvanirnaya-tika) and Tatvodyota-tika of Sri Padmanabha Tirtha, direct disciple of Madhvacarya to all the jignasu bandhus on the auspicious moment of Narasimha Jayanthi, the day of Vedavyasa Jayanthi and the eve of Kurma Jayanti.(pankaja.pdf file attached)

  

Some Salient Points:

  

1. These two pracina tikas (ancient commentaries) are hitherto unpublished and are being edited mainly based on an old manuscript written in Nandinagari obtained from ORI, Mysore.

  

2\. Five other prakarana-tikas of Padmanabha Tirtha have been included with better readings from the same manuscript.

  

3\. The entire text carries multi level footnotes with variant readings, suggestive comments in case of incorrect readings, relevant extracts of other commentaries (tatvamanajri of Sri Nayarana Panditacarya, commentary of Sri Jayatirtha, tippanis etc), reference to quotes.

  

4\. Many appendices have been added for reference, which include -

    a. variant readings of mUla,

    b. interesting passages of padmanabhatirtha tika,

    c. observations about commentatorial tradition,

    d. references to nyayaratnavali by various commentators,

    e. list of comments by Sri Vidyesha TIrtha,

    f. another ancient commentary on mithyatvanumanakhanda by an uknown author and

    g. relevant portions of shankara bhashya.

  

5\. This book is edited using Latex2e on ubuntu 8.04. Devnag 2.15 pre-processor is used for sanskrit. All these are free software solutions.

  

6\. Copyleft: No rights reserved. We encourage seekers to copy, enhance or redistribute any part of this book or the entire book for non-commercial purposes.
