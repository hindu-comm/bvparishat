As far as I know the full book was edited and published by Pt.Jha in  
1905. I have a xeroxed version of this with me. The book is available  
in many of the oriental libraries( Baroda, Mysore,...). While  
searching for books in the shops near the Sanskrit Univ in Benares, I  
saw a recent edition with Hindi translation. I have extensively worked  
on the Adbhuta sagara for information on ancient comets:

The book preserves a self consistent list of comets with year numbers  
originally attributed to Parashara. This seems to have some connection  
with Vedic texts through the Adbhuta Brahamna and the Atharvaveda  
Parishishta. Ketvadbhuta section in Adbhuta sagara is far superior to  
the Ketu-chara of Brihat Samhita which is not consistent.
