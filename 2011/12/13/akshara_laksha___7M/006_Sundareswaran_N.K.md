Dear Scholars,

I wonder why Sri Jagannatha S and Sri Sivasenani are mild in condemning such a tall claim(mostly fake too).

Such attitudes and claims should be either categorically disproved or simply ignored by scholars who are sincerely and devotedly striving to understand and safeguard our great tradition.
