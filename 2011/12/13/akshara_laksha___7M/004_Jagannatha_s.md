aaryaah, svasti /



My question is on the authenticity of claim of a guy who started a website on an encyclopedic(?) work namely Aksharalakshya composed by sage Valmiki (Please click on the link). This guy(he has not revealed his identity ) claims thisAksharalakshya treats more than 300 subjects!

He says that he will give us more details shortly.

Shall we wait ?
