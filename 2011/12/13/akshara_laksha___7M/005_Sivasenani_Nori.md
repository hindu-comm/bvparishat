Sir



I should have checked the link before shooting off.



Regarding the link itself,I amnot qualified enough in terms of knowledge aboutSanskrit works composed, to pass any comment. Valmiki might have indeed authored such a work, though it looks extremely unlikely that the gentleman who put up the website has access to it. In this age, even a forgery - touching the claimed 325 subjects, without making any blunders -would be a great achievement!
