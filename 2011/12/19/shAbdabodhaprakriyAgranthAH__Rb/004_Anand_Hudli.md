There is an English work titled "The Philsophy of a Sentence and Its  
Parts" by Veluri Subba Rao, published by Munshiram Manoharlal. This is  
a very well written book for those who are interested in shAbdabodha.

I have personally used this book for my research in the application of  
shAbdabodha to natural language processing by computers.

Regards,

Anand
