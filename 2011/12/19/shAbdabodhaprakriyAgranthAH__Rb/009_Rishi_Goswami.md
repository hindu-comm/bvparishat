I came to know about this wonderful book by Kuruganti Ramashastriji, and was finding the book on the net.

I found Paribhashashik online. Here's the link if someone requires.

But I couldn't find Tarkasangraha Sarvasvam online, perhaps it's not available.

Also, Sukhapraveshini by Veeraraghavacharya is a good commentary.
