do anybody have the list of all Sanskrit research journals in India?  
or if somebody can give any source, where we can get the details? if  
not then there is a great need to make a list of Sanskrit research  
journals. it will be very helpful for all scholars( research students  
and teachers) in Sanskrit universities.
