Hari Om! Salutations!!  
  
We are sorry to inform that due to the indifferent health of one of the faculty member, we are constrained to postpone the Ten- day Residential Textual Workshop on Indian Philosophical Tradition and Western Philosophical Methods, scheduled to be held from 21st to 30th January, 2012. We will intimate you the fresh date in due course.
