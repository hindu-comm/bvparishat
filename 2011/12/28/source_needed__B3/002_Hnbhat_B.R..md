It had already been a part of Shaktigraha topic in Nyaya system, seen quoted by Gangeshopadhyaya in his Shaktigrahavada, 1300 c.AD from which Prof. Pandurangi seems to have quoted. Some sources earlier than this, would be welcome as the possible source for Gangesha could have borrowed for शब्दप्रामाण्यवाद in his तत्त्वचिन्तामणि. It might be found in Nyayabhashya quoted or any other work dealing with शक्तिग्रह.
