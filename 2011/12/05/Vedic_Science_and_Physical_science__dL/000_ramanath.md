We always claim that our scriptures are treasure of knowledge and  
information sciences because we have faith in the words of our  
scriptures i.e. Vedas and its allied (VedAngas). There are several  
passages in Vedas and their allied subjects which clearly mention that  
the Science of Vedas is the supreme if taken into consideration for  
research work in any field of studies of all times. The Science, in  
the terms of Vedic literature, is the source of all kinds of knowable  
objects. (ChAndogyopaniSad ) 7.7.1  
Therefore, Vedas are revealed texts rather than manmade. The basic  
difference between revealed text and manmade text is that former is  
the source of knowledge while latter is the source of information.  
Thus, all the texts, other than the Vedic literature, being manmade  
are subjected to test in our practical life for being authority.  
However, this concept seems to be biased in the context of modern  
sciences. In fact, both might be considered on the logical point of  
view and must be in conformity to each other.
