This classification - Vedic Science and Physical Science is unscientific; since it amounts to saying that the two are different. It is not so. I had used Vedic Science and Modern Science, with the explanation that they refer to the periods; and not to the science itself. There cannot be two sets of truths one for vedas and one for science. Truth is one; that is science; that is Vedas.



one scholar has asked for the definition of scienc. It was defined long back as precision of knowledge. to use our scriptural terminology; that which says idamittham is science. But this has undergone a sea change in that now science (modern) subscribes to umpteen theories, like for example, the Big Bang theory.



except the age associated with the piece of knowledge in relation to the source; there is no, and there cannot be, any difference between the two; except in our perceptions. That is there cannot be dvaita in truth.

The approaches to the TRUTH may be largely analytical; but also synthetical. modern science is mostly analytical; and vedas synthetical. But strict examination shows that there is no absolute compartmentalisation between the two. There are evidence of both in the Vedas.
