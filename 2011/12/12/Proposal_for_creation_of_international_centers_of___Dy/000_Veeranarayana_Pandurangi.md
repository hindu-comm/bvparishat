dear all here is a proposal for resolution to be adopted in the forthcoming WSC.

please endorse this  

  

Proposal for creation of international centers of documentary resources of Samskrita in India



Though internet is expanding the horizons of knowledge in a way never seen before, we need to have some good libraries of Samskrita with collections of worldwide publications in and on Samskrita language and related fields.



The books published in western countries never make their way to India either because of lack of funds or lack of knowledge, likewise books published in India on various subjects don’t make their way to west because of lack of knowledge.



I. hence it is proposed to identify some of the good Samskrita libraries and develop them as the international centers of documentary resources of Samskrita in India.

(1) Sampoornanada Sanskrit University library, Varanasi, covering the whole of east zone/ or Asiatic society Library, Kolkata

(2) Asiatic society library in Bombay or BORI Library in pune for the western zone.

(3) Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya sanskrit Vidyapeetha library in Delhi for northern zone.

(4) Karnataka sanskrita University Library in Banglore for south zone (Bangalore which is the centrally located in south zone will be ideal one). Or Rashtriya sanskrita Vidyapeetha library, Tirupati.

(5) Sansthan Campus in Bhopal for central zone. Or Maharshi Panini University Ujjain



-   These libraries should set up a separate reference section of the
    books provided under this scheme and operate through a state of art
    OPAC system. -   These libraries should create a network of libraries in respective
    zone and loan the books to member libraries (in the network)
    whenever necessary and circulate information on the arrival of new
    books. -   These libraries should arrange placement of Books in a clear cut way
    that is easy to find books needed at any time. -   These books should be placed in a separate reference section so no
    ordinary students should be able to misplace them. (The misplacement
    of Books by ignorant students is a high problem for researches since
    books once misplaced are very difficult to find when particular book
    is needed for research). Only qualified staff should handle the
    collection and no researcher of student be allowed to roam freely
    there. Placing the book in order is high necessity. These libraries
    should commit for this type of arrangement.



We should ask our western counterparts to contribute 5 copies each of their publications to these centers.Individual authors can contribute by sending 5 copies, while institutional publishers can contribute in a more liberal way so more libraries in India can be benefited. This is because The rates of books published abroad are so high that a simple book which is priced around 45-50 euros will approximately cost around 5000/6000 Rupees. So purchasing a book in five copies will cost 25000 rupees which is the average salary of academic staff. So the International publishers and individual authors should come forward to help the Indian students and Academic staff in the academic interest so their ideas can reach the biggest contingent of Samskrita studies in India.



Journals published by Academic institutions abroad should be exchanged between these libraries, while journals published by Commercial publishers can be purchased by Rashtriya Sanskrita Sansthan for these centers.



For this purpose Rashtriya Sanskrita Sansthan should identify a nodal center among these five libraries which should act as primary center for collection of books and dissemination of information/ training of staff among these libraries. The Nodal library should be responsible for the collection of all the Samskrita books published in India. It should create a electronic bulletin, which should be sent all the interesting via emails, and a website for the sake of the readers.



Similarly we should procure each and every Samskrita book published in India and place them in these five centers. Rashtriya Sanskrita Sansthan will be responsible for this.



So at least we could have some five libraries which can provide us access to the research what is happening in the other parts of India and world. it would certainly benefit Samskrita research in India.



II.Similarly five more such centers should be identified in different countries of world 1. Britain, (Oxford Uni) 2. France (Sorbonne Uni/College de France). 3. Japan (Kyoto Uni) 4. USA. (Harvard Uni) 5. Germany (Heidelberg Uni).We should supply them at least five copies of each book published on Samskrita in India so western scholars can be aware of research carried in India. Rashtriya Sanskrita Sansthan has to take this responsibility. Indian Journals can be exchanged to these institutions. And these five institutional libraries should be responsible for collection and exchange of books and journals between Indian and Foreign Libraries.



Otherwise it is difficult to bridge the gap between India and west.



Hence we request all the scholars assembled here to support this resolution and accept it to bridge the gap.
