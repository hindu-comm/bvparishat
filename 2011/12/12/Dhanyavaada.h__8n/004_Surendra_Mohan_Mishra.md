Suprabhaatam !

satyam uktam atra nyaaya-suutra-mukhena sadodaara-jagannaathavaryai.h !

Under the very same suutra Vaatsyaayana explains : ka.h punar aya.m  
samaya.h ? 'asya s'abdasyedam arthajaatam abhidheyam' - iti  
abhidhaanaabhidheya-niyama-niyoga.h /

In the following suutra " jaati-vis'[e.se](http://e.se) caaniyamaat " he says :  
saamayika.h s'abdaartha-sampratyaya.h,na  
svaabhaavika.h/.r.syaarya-mlecchaanaa.m yathaa-kaama.m s'abda-viniyogo  
'rtha-pratyaayanaaya pravartate /

This samaya again for the old naiyaayika-s wished and established by  
God while the Navyaa.h believe in contemporary usages of words to  
convey specific senses also to be logically obtaining.

In the same sense "Hari.h Om !" can be viewed.In the sannyaasin  
tradition one bows down with the words "Om namo naaraaya.naaya !"

We do have the longest tradition of cultural life.Why should we seek  
to translate certain ideas that come from outside ? Rather we should  
behave as continuing the best part of our heritage which is highly  
livable in modern times.At times yes,to have something indigenous we  
have to do something like this as Samskrita Bhaaratii has apparently  
done.Certainly it has not translated,but it has put up something that  
seems more natural than starting with a 'Hello !' and then going for  
Samskrit or other Indian languages.

SMMishra
