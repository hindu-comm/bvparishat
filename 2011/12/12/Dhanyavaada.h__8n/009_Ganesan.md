हर ओम् ।।



Dear Shreyas,

Of course, we have to take the entire Upanishad as a whole. Here we see that Rudra is very often referred to as the Supreme reality, and , the word Deva is used in thisUpanishad to denote Rudra alone. Even the second verse,

ते ध्यानयोगानुगता अपश्यन् देवात्मशक्तिं स्वगुणैर्निगूढाम्।

where the supreme Power--Sakti--of the Deva is referred to.

That the fundamental purport of this Upanishad is to glorify Siva as the only Supreme Reality (the parabrahma) is evident in each and every word and verse.

To avoid a lengthy post we may cite as an exapmle the 18 the verse of the first adhyaya:

संयुक्तमेतत् क्षरमक्षरं च व्यक्ताव्यक्तं भरते विश्वमीशः ।

and other subsequent verses where Isa, Ishvara, Isaana, are repeatedly used which cannot be applied to any other God than Siva. As said by the immortal poet Kalidasa who is also a greatest saiva-poet (as the Mangalasloka-s of allhis 5 works speak only the glory of Siva), यस्मिन् ईश्वर इत्यनन्यविषयः शब्दो यथार्थाक्षरः ।

The Svetashvataropanishad verse, 3: 2 says in unequivocal terms:

एको हि रुद्रो न द्वितीयाय तस्थुः य इमान् लोकानीशत ईशनीभिः।

and the next one,

द्यावाभूमी जनयन् देव एकः । is another one in point. Deva and Isa are here usd interchangeably and synonymously.

Going by the Taatparyaartha, one can clearly understand the import of the entire this Upanishad as the Supreme Glory of Siva (= Rudra).

It is so strange that in the light of the presence of these so many words and phrases that CAN PERTAIN ONLY TO SIVA, and in the total absence of any word or so pertaining to Vishnu, an interpretation is attempted to establish the Vishnu as the import of this Upanishad.

So any other attempt overlooking this basic import will naturally be a violation of tradition and TRUTH.

Ofcourse, Sri Ramanujaadduces passages from this Upanishad for establishinghis thesis, and especially for his doctrine of SaraNaagati on Vishnu. Yes,for inculcating the importance of SaraNAgati on Vishnu, this Saiva Upanishad has supplied the necessary basic material for him !!

The last verse,

यस्य देवे परा भक्तिर्यथा देवे तथा गुरौ ।

तस्यैते कथिता ह्यर्थाः प्रकाशन्ते मनीषिणः ।।

again proclaims the supreme and highest devotion (parAbhakti) to the Deva (= Siva = Rudra) as the only means to realise the Vedantic TRUTH.

To sum up, I would suggest you to go through thoroughlythe Brahmasutrabhashya of Srikantha where in commenting onthe very first sutra, he ably proves that Siva is the Brahma spoken in the entire Vedanata and the Brahmasutra-s and he establishes his thesis so eloquently on the basis of this Svstashvataropanishad without any TEXT TORTURING OR CHANGING THE TEXT.



Your citing the Skandapurana verse is a double-edged one and it can be used against the view that youwant to prove; if it is taken as it is, then only those who are 'mumukshu'--desirous of moksha--should worship Vishnu, which, as a Vaishnava Vishishtadvaiti, you will not agree> For in the vaishnava scriptures, everybody is advised to pray to Vishnu to obtain whatever worldly desire he has. And again, the immortal Kalidasa, a Yugapurusha indeed, has clearly stated, in the Mangalasloka odf his Vikramorvashiyam,

अन्तर्यश्च मुमुक्षुभिर्नियमितप्राणादिभिर्मृग्यते स स्थाणुः स्थिरभक्तियोगसुलभो निःश्रेयसायास्तु वः । which isthe actual restatement of the Svetashvataropanishad 6:18 cited by me in my previous mail. Therefore, it is as clear thatMumukshu should only worship iva (= sthaANu)with firm devotion.



With the best wishes

Ganesan
