The difference of interpretation here among different schools of philosophy is not new.

To avoid a lengthy post, I refer you to the Vishishtadvaitic interpretation of Sri Rangaramanuja Muni (Upanishad Bhashyakarar) edited by Sri Uttamur Veera-raghavachariar:

[*http://www.archive.org/details/SvetasvataradyopanishadPusushasukthaBashyaPart1*](http://www.archive.org/details/SvetasvataradyopanishadPusushasukthaBashyaPart1)

देवमात्मबुद्धिप्रकाशं can be understood as मधुकैटभापहृतवेदपुनरर्पणविहितोऽअनुग्रहः i.e. Sri Hayagreeva Bhagavan, the avataram of Hari who retrieved and restored the Vedas that Chaturmukha Bramha had lost.

Also, wrt मुमुक्षुत्वम् mentioned here,note the Skana-Puranam says:

ArOgyam bhAskarAt iCChEt, dhanam iCChEt hutASanAt,

ISAnAt jnAnam anviCChEt, mOksham iCChEt janArdanAt

धनयोस्मि,

-Shreyas
