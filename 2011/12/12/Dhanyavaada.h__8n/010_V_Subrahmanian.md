Namaste.

  

Topics like this are very likely to get into fiery discussions. Let us not allow that to happen. Without bringing Shiva-VishNu supremacy let us go ahead with the main purport of the topics. Sanskrit is such a language that gives in to any kind of interpretation one desires. I have heard that an Acharya belonging to the Madhva tradition has written a completely viShNu-para commentary on the Sri Rudram occurring in the Krishna Yajus samhitaa.

  

शिवाय विष्णुरूपाय शिवरूपाय विष्णवे ।

शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णुर्विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिवः ॥

  

This shloka is chanted by smArta-s of Kannada region during their daily sandhyaa vandanam.
