Aaryaah, svasti /

  

The inquiry was on link between Harih Om and Hello (whether the sound Ha/he is the only resemblance between the two).

  

This is my personal experience that *Harih Om* (instead of *Hello*) is uttered by Samskrita bharati-trained/ influenced people when I call them on the phone.

  

When the receiver of the phone utters Hello, his/her intention is to make an inquiry viz.,  *may I know who is on the line please*. Isthis meaning conveyed by theutterance Harih Om ? If it so, why it shall not be even Harah Om ? 

  

Is it correct to utter Harih Om in the place of Hello?

  

Theutteranceslike he, re, bhoh, bho, anga, pyaat, hai, etc.. are only for address. Samskritabharati-trained/ influenced people use *Harih Om*1.while addressing on seeing thefriends in front of them and 2.while starting to inquiry on caller.To what extent this kind of modern  utility for *Harih Om*can be justified? 

  

This is the gist of Sri Anil Kumar Acharya's question, I think.

  

Can our resort be the adage, *saamayikah shabdaarthayoh sambandhah* (Vide Nyayasutra 2.1.55)?
