Hara O.m is not unconventional; there are few manuscripts (which I had catalogued) that contain Hara o.m at the beginning.

As somebody had written, even Hari o.m is also not wide spread and many regions have there own conventions.

Also it is not mandatory to chant Hari o.m at the beginning of Vedic recitations.

But following the most ancient Svetashvataropanishad whose mantra 6:18is:

यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्वं यो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति तस्मै ।

तँ ह देवमात्मबुद्धिप्रकाशं मुमुक्षुर्वै शरणमहं प्रपद्ये ।।

it will certainly be correct and apt that Hara o.m is chanted at the beginning.

Ganesan
