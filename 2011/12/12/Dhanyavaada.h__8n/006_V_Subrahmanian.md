Namaste.

  

I have observed among our family members/relatives hailing from Kerala a practice: when an infant sneezes the पार्श्वस्थः immediately utters 'हरिः' . This I think is a conformation to a srImadbhAgavata verse (someone please supply) which says 'when one coughs or sneezes or sits or gets up and walks one should think of Hari (nAma).' 

  

This was the state of prahlAda:

``` न्यस्त-क्रीडनको बालो जडवत् तन्मनस्तया कृष्ण-ग्रह-गृहीतात्मा न वेद जगदीदृशम् आसीनः पर्यटन्नश्नन् शयानः प्रपिबन् ब्रुवन् नानुसन्धत्त एतानि गोविन्दपरिरम्भितः ```

``` When one takes up the above as sAdhana, one will try to orient all one's actions to this practice.  In that vein when one meets another uttering 'Hari Om' or 'Ram Ram' etc. invokes this bhagavadbhAvana in oneself and prompts it in the other/s. Even with our most familiar 'namaskAr' some people have given explanation such as: we are actually addressing the paramAtman within the other person.  In fact the samskRta bhArati's sambhAShaNa shikShaNa classes start with the teacher entering the class and uttering 'namo namaH' and all the students reciprocating with a 'namo namaH' in chorus.
