This I think is a conformation to a srImadbhAgavata verse (someone please supply) which says 'when one coughs or sneezes or sits or gets up and walks one should think of Hari (nAma).'

I am not aware of that verse, but there is a well-known विधि reading क्षुतमाचमेत् which indicates that one is to perform आचमन (केशवाय स्वाहा, नारायणाय स्वाहा, etc.) after a sneeze. It may be that नामस्मरण is a simplification of this, though it would remain odd that someone would be required to do आचमन/नामस्मरण upon another's sneeze (a विधि generally only pertains to one's own action, does it not?). It could perhaps be that elders act on behalf of the infant who cannot act on his own, or that the नामस्मरण is meant to ward off undesirables (a sneeze being a possible indicator of oncoming illness).
