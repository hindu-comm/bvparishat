In fact an inquirer is a kind of inspirer that fires the imaginative  
and knowing minds that they are beset with the question and a creative  
answer results as a consequence.  
Sanskrit literature is so vast that one never knows if 'hara om' is  
used somewhere or not.Well,I have seen 's'iva om' being used in some  
chantings.  
Another thing that is there a real difference between Hari and Hara ?  
If due to cult differences this once came to prominence,the thinking  
'yugapuru.sa-s' as you call them,came to assume that unique  
undifferentiated divinity as Harihara ! If you ask why was it not  
Harahari,I have no answer.Of course we have S'[ankaranaaraaya.na](http://ankaranaaraaya.na) and  
S'ivaraamakri.s.na.Words are important,but what we do with them is  
more important.  
In Bhubaneswar,the 13th century Lingaraj temple has the tradition of  
offering Vilva and Tulasi at the same time to the Lord.  
In many of the Vaishnavite texts at the end we find 'hari.h om tat sat' !  
Traditions have a live beauty of their own,the seeker and follower  
experience this daily !
