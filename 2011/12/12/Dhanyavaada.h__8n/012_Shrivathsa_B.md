hariH OM,  
shri moharir,

  
  
"To what extent this kind of modern  utility for *Harih Om*can be justified? "  
  

 It has been said in the padma purANa:  
"harirharati pApAni duShTacittairapi smR^itaH.  
anicChannapi saMspR^iShTo dahatyeva hi pAvakaH.."  
i.e. hari removes "paapa" (sin) even if remembered by a vile person in the same way that fire burns even if touched unintentionally  
  
 this may be the reason we use "hariH OM" or "raam raam" etc. (to rid ourselves of paapa).  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
