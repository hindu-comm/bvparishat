Very Interesting discussion. Now it is really worth identifying myths and truths. From the point of our updated knowledge, they are considered as myths in contrast to the truth as tested by our updated knowledge. They are the myths preserved .  

  

While a group insisting on the Vedic Science as truth and modern science as myth, it is a welcome movement to introspect our Shastraic Science (if it can be termed as such), or at least observations in our Shastra-s regarding the phenomena of nature and physics.

  

Belles Literature is dwelling upon the imaginative power of the poets plus their talent in Shastra-s, a moderate synthesis is always to be found in Sanskrit Literature.

  

Bhramara-kITa nyaya raised by Subrahmaniam doesn't know as he is not a biologist (nor me), but there is a metamorphosis in insects transforming them into flies. It may "bhramara" or any insect undergoing the metamorphosis. It may be based on a simple deduction from the observation of the life cycle of the flies. Here is the link on the topic:

There are similar fanciful understandings called poetic conventions that the cuckoos sing only Vasanta season only and the Catrka birds drink the drops of water before they fall on the ground from the sky. Cuckoo-s are called परपुष्ट as they lay their eggs in the nest of crows for hatching and as soon as the young birds come out able to fly they fly away. The cuckoos do not build their nest. I don't know whether this is a fact or myth. The epithet परभृत also suggest the similar concept. There are many more which have nothing parallel in daily life. The smile is white etc which are simple observations.

  

Hope many more may come up.
