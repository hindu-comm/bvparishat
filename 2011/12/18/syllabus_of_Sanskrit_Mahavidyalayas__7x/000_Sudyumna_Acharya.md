Dear Sir,  
I invite your attention to a burning topic relating to oriental  
syllabus of Sanskrit Pathashalas and Mahavidyalayas. Every student of  
Madhyama, Shastri wishing to assimilate principles of physical science  
is expected to keep himself abreast to the doctrines of Nyaya.  
Vaisheshika. He should variably go through such doctrines as are not  
solvent to the modern science andso theyare cast into shade. For  
instance--  
1- Eyes emit the rays while visual perception  
2-Air has no weight.  
3-Gold is made of fire-atoms.  
These doctrines are adhered to without weighing up their pros and  
cons. All such doctrines are read and taught for no better reason than  
that we are committed to safeguarding Sanskrit.  
Through this forum, all thoughtful gentle-men are requested to  
interact the matter in order to improve the situation. Your comments  
in this regard are most welcome. Hoping to hear from all of you. With  
regards--
