Not only in prescribing Shastras but much to be done even in Sahitya.

  

For example, Bhojaprabandha has so many stories like contemporaneity ofKalidasa and Magha and their enjoying patronage of Raja Bhoja, per every letter of the enchanting verse the poets compose, his donating one lack rupees without iota of hesitation so on and so forth. When the teacher infuses the students with these stories, it creates bad impact in the minds of students which can not be removable. Some times I am amazed at some(not all) Sanskritists who firmly believe that every word of Bhojaprabandha is gospel truth. But there is a dilemma (This is my dilemma too!).The stories are enjoyable and in spite of teachers' knowing the truth, they can not stop telling them.This Bhojaprabandha is firmly rooted in the Samskrita curriculum over centuries and has become inseparable part of Samskrita teaching culture.

  

Solution: 1. Tell the story, but in introductory remarks inform the students in very clear words  that most of these stories are imaginary.

  

2\. Prescribe Bhojaprabandha as textbook. But remove the poets' names. Since no story can be enjoyable without any name, employ some false names (But this is highly impractical).

  

I would like to draw the attention of learned scholars on the usages like paashanda-gaja-kesari, vaadi-mattebha-panchaanana etc..Always we are told by hundreds of references that the lion is the stronger and the elephant is weaker.So the elephant is afraid of lion.

(mattebhendra-vibhinna-kumbha-pishita-graasaika-baddha-sprihah)

  

I observed elephants' not showing any sign of fear on seeing lions in the TV Channels Animal planet and Discovery channel. Once I was watching Animal planet. I saw that the lions were meticulously guarding a pond so that no other animal would enter into that place.The reason is in that particular region, water was a scarcity. But when some elephants rushed towards the pond, the lions (grudgingly?) left that place!Very rarely young elephant may be attacked by pack of lions and not single lion. So, in praising a valiant, the expressions like \`\`arikula-gandhagajayuutha-panchaananah" are funny.
