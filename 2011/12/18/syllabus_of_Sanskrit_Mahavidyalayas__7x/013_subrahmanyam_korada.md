नमो विद्वद्भ्यः  
  
As far as the syllabus in Mahavidyalayas is concerned I think that there should be a Course introducing Vedangas and Darsanas .  
  
I was a UGC Visiting Fellow at Mahavidyalaya , M S University , Vadodara (Vatodaram)during 2000-2001 .  
  
Experience tells me that 99% of Sanskrit Scholars are not familiar with all the Vedangas and Darsanas . One may specialize a Sastram or two or Three but keeps mum while any discussion is taken up in other Sastras/Darsanas .  
  
This is the reason why I started the chain of Workshops .  
  
Soon I may put the material on my personal Website for the benefit of all .  
  
It would also be nice to train the students in a small portion of Veda in Gurukula system . They have to protect both Vaidikasabdas and Laukikasabdas .
