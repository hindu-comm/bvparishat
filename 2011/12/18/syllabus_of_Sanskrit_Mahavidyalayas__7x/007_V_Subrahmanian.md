Namaste.

  

There are some others that need attention too:

  

There is a 'bhramara-keeTa nyAya' that finds place in Vedanta, especially Advaita. I do not know if such a thing happens in reality: a keeTa, out of fear of the bhramara, over a period of time, transforming itself into a bhramara.

  

'serpents guarding a nidhi': It is (was) believed a treasure embedded in the ground is guarded by snakes. 'Pearls being in the head of elephants', 'nAgamaNi' in the head of a serpent', etc. are some others in this list.
