It is so heartwarming to see that there are still some who strive hard to  
retain the traditional "knowledge" systems as well as the methods by which  
it was preserved through such gatherings as "shalaka pariksha". It would  
be such a delight to be part of the audience to listen to these wonderful  
students. My heartiest congratulations to them and as well as to the  
PoornapajnaVidyapeetha, Bangalore for keeping this alive.  
Om  
Rukmani
