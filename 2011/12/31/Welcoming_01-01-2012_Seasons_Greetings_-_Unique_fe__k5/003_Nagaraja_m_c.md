I completely AGREE with Dr.B.V.K.Shastry in the matter concerned with time. It is said that we are in the Scientific Age. We shall surely go along with Science.

Perhaps there are some scholars in the group who may not consider that we are in the Scientific Age and Sanathana Dharma is the only one which triumphs over Science and Science is a PARTIAL change of the conditions.

Even then Jan 1st is not the New Year.

As we already know it is according to the Gregorian Calender that certain changes made some 500 years ago without any Valid base is the reason for the present new year. Even today we call Septa, Octa, Nova and Deca as 9,10,11 and 12 respectively in the present day calendar which is nothing but SHEER LIES.

Yes we shall surely go along with the time and celebrate a new day called Jan.1st everywhere as WELCOMING DAY OF A YEAR NAMED . . . . And this year being 2012.

Therefore I always wish everyone as WELCOME TO 2012. We could also wish others as Let 2012 bring prosperity to you which is always equivalent to Many Many Happy Returns on this Occasion, whatever be the occasion, favorable to one and all.  
Considering this day as NEW YEAR is to be pondered and debated.

Dhanyavad.
