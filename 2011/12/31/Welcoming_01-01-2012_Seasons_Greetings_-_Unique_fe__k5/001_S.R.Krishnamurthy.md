Dear BVK.



Namaste. Normally I do not take cognisance of 1st January at all. I fully concur with what you have said.



Yet I may add that according to the 'Christian' mythology, the month was named Januuary after Janus, who was two-headed; hence considered a cunning monster. There is reference to him in one of the Shakespearanean plays; I do not recall immediately which it is.



Regards.
