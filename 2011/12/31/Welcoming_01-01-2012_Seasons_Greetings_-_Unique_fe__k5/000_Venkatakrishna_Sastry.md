Namaste



Seasons Greetings on the Onset of the Time roll out reckoned as 01-01-2012 , the New Year in the business Calendar.



Some points to ponder, resonating the ideas from Vedic Traditions in the quiet moments as the year 2011 rolls out: What is Unique of Hindu Dharmic Traidtions in celebrating TIME ROLL OUTS?



1. Hindus call New year as ' Samavatsara Cycle'. The celebration is of the cyclicity of cosmic events like Sun, Moon, Jupiter returning to original starting position after one full cylce - 'Poornam'. This is a unique feature, where TIME is freed from taxonomy linked to a Faith, much less the Faith -event celebration set by any King !



Samavatsara is a different paradigm of CYCLIC Rolling of TIME ( -kaala -chakra) different from linear distancing away from an arbitrary reference ! One can and does return back in TIME to the starting point in a cyclic motion; This is not possible in a linear move, unless line becomes a circle !



2. Time flow reckoning in Hindu Calendar is called 'Panchangam' :
Time reckoning in relation to Sun-Moon-Stars relative position to the geo centric local condition. The five units are called Vaara, Tithi, Nakshatra, yoga, karana. This is a unique feature, where TIME is freed from taxonomy linked to an arbitraty reference like Greenwich set by any Nation marking itself as the central axis of the cosmos ! The Sun-Moon-Stars are the eyes and light (Jyoti) of the Supreme Divine.





3. Divinity of Time is reckoned and acknowledged in 'Sankalpa' - the narration of time-space coordinates in any event. The auspicious moment is called ' Muhurta'. This concept of TIME-SPACE Divinity is unique to Hindus following Dharma.

  
The pole star idea of all traditions under the umbrella of Dharma is Transcending the Binding -Bonds of TIME-SPACE; yet enjoy evry moment and day in the TIME-FLOW as the journey with DIVINE. The celebration of 01-01-2012 is one of such celebrations out of the 365 days of celebration marked in Panchangam !
