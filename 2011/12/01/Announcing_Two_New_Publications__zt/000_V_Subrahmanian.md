Namaste.

  

Recently the Sringeri Peetham has brought out two new publications:

  

1\. The Brahmasutra ShAnkara BhAShyam : This book, consisting just the mUla bhAShyam, is thoroughly revised and carefully checked for correct pAThams and other errors. The Book has come out in very good print and binding and is priced at a heavily subsidised cost of Rs.100 only per copy.

  

2\. The BruhaddhAturUpAvaLiH: This book is also very nicely printed in a big volume costing Rs.200 only per copy. 

  

Those interested in procuring the above may contact Sri K.Srinivasan, Sri VidyA-BhArati Press, Shankarapuram Main Road, Bangalore 560 004. The email id is: [sriniva...@gmail.com]()
