Dear Colleagues!

  

This is to express a general caution about contact details:

  

Few of you, have your mobile numbers, residence address, residence phone numbers in your mail signature. Thus, these details will appear without your knowledge on every forum, you reply/ post.

  

This is not advisable, as the current scenario is frightening. Constantly, one or more senior scholars accounts are hacked. First it was Sri Ramakrishnamacharya and later, Sri Kutumba Sastry, Sri Kalyana raman etc.

One of the hacker had even quoted phone numbers/ address also as a proof of authenticity in the mail.

  

Hence, it is better not to give your personal particulars on any forum.  
  
With Warm Regards  
Dr.Vamshi K Ghanapaathi
