PanditavaryaaH नमोन्नमः ॥ संस्कृत भाषायां एषः प्रबम्धः समीचीनं अस्ति व न वा इति ज\~ज्ञातुं एषा परीक्षा ॥ अस्तु॥

वाल्मीकि महर्षिः विमानां विषये अद्भुतवर्णानांददाति॥ I will reproduce the stanzasfor the benefit of scholars, since these have been ignored by the 'critical editors', who declare that Valmiki did not sea and that kharaaH were donkeys. I have already mentioned that Kharas were planes - खे रंहते इति खरः खे रौति इति च ॥

See what he says in 3.31 on Ravana’s first sojourn to Maricha.

\[Having said so (to Akampana) Ravana left by a white chariot drawn by ‘Kharas’, lighting up all the directions. (34). That chariot of the King of demons, fleeting in the starry path, shone like a moon in the midst of clouds. (35)\]

It is clear from the above two verses that the first sojourn of Ravana to Maricha was during the night; and that it was a flight in the sky (nakshatrapatha). Valmiki is explicit about it. Again, he portrays in 3-35.

कामगंरथमास्थायशुशुभेराक्षसाधिपः\|विद्युन्मन्दलवानमेघः सबलाकः इवाम्बरे\|\|3-35-10

\[Having mounted the crane-like autocraft, the demon king shone like cloud with a lightning\]. This verse shows two things. That khara looked like a fast flying bird of the crane family (balaakaH **xÉoÉsÉÉMüÈ**); and his vehicle (kaamagah) was sailing in the air like a cloud. It also indicates that Ravana had the complexion of the cloud and that the balaka was white as lightning. This agrees with the description in 3-31-34 above: *aadityavarNena* (white).

How was the Khara? Valmiki says that the front had the look of a fiend, horrendous to look (pishaachavadana) and that it had a big hull (bhImarUpaa mahaakaaya). So, it was obviously a lifeless object. It droned like a thunder (meghapratimanaada). It obviously had wings (balaakasadrushaH **xÉoÉsÉÉMüÈ CuÉ**). Pishacha belongs to devayoni (vide Amarakosha); a specie like ET. It has no life like the creatures of this world. It is balaakaH; providing with power (balaa). All these features described by Valmiki fits in with a powerful motor (engine). So according to Valmiki, Ravana left by a craft fitted with powerful engines. The chariot was obviously an aircraft.

These are some excerpts from my book. as suggested by Dr.N.R.Joshi, I have posted the same here; since I have not so far come across this description in any review of Ramayana

Pranaams.
