 Good observation, but we can't really read what is going on in the mind of someone else. I know Clooney and I don't see him quite as a diehard Jesuist like De Nobili or Xavier. This is at least in part because the times have changed and such methods now would get him in trouble. I think people like him will be doubly careful now after the PR disaster following the cancellation of Swamy's courses.



 So he and others like him should not be overrated but treated as ordinary people with daily needs and concerns. This was true as much of Max Muller as Witzel. We elevated them by raising to a pedestal or making them larger than life monsters. Clooney or others like him have no right to tell us whether to politicize or not.



 Please see my article "Rise and Fall of Indology: From Max Muller to Witzel" on Google.



 The Hindu backlash and the message it has sent to Harvard is far more important than course cancellation or their restoration. They have exposed themselves and we must demolish Indology programs in the West, not debate them. I would no more 'engage' them in a debate than I would neo-Nazis.



 I am working on an article along these lines that I expect will be studied by Harvard and other universities.
