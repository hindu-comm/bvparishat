Thanks for the pointer which I read upon your suggestion. Actually after seeing the shAnkara bhAShyam I recalled the Br.Up. 1.4.10 bhashyam on 'aham brahma asmi'. There the teaching is 'Brahman realised itself as Brahman'. 

  

I also thought on the terms like 'vimuktaH' of the V S N where even though there is no real bondage and a later attained mukti the Lord is still called so. 'vRddhAtmaa' - even though He has not attained vRddhi from any small form. Shankara's favourite terms 'nitya shuddha buddha mukta svabhAvaH' also are in this vein. sarvasamshayarahitaH is the samudAyArthaH of the term. 

  

Thank you Dr. Sri Ramanujan for the nice reference. 

  

Regards,
