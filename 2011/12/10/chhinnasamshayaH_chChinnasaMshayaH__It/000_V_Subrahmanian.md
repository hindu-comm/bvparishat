Namaste  
  
In the srIviShNusahasranAma there is the name (623) 'chhinnasamshayaH'.
The meaning is: The one for whom all doubts have rent asunder. The commentary by Shankaracharya is: करतलामलवत् सर्वं साक्षात्कृतवतः क्वापि संशयो नास्तीति छिन्नसंशयः For the One to whom everything is directly realized there is no doubt of any kind at all.  
  
The same word appears in the Bhagavadgita 18.10 where the advanced aspirant is described as the one whose avidya-born doubt is no longer there and he is of the firm conviction that remaining established in the Self is the highest means for liberation and no other means can take one to the highest state. The shAnkara bhAShyam for this word here is - मेधावित्वादेव च्छिन्नसंशयः छिन्नः अविद्याकृतः संशयः यस्य 'आत्मस्वरूपावस्थानमेव परं निःश्रेयससाधनम्, न अन्यत् किञ्चित्' इत्येवं निश्चयेन च्छिन्नसंशयः।।  
  
The word 'chhinna' suggests that something has remained before and has been destroyed/cut subsequently. While in the case of the aspirant it is quite justified to use the word where there is avidya to occasion doubt there comes a state when owing to vidya the doubt/s are destroyed. However in the case of the Lord how is this word justified where there is no prior avidya to cause doubt/s and getting destroyed later?
