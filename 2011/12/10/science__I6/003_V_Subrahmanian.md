Namaste.

  

This is the popular 'tApatraya' quite familiar to Vedantins. I thought 'AdhyAtmika' is so called because of the connection with the two bodies: gross and subtle. The word 'Atma' is used in the sense of the gross body and the subtle body (mind). 

  

Reverting to the original question:

  

1)aadhibhoutika vijnaana=material science  
2)aadhi daivika vijnaana=???  

3)aadhyaatmika vijnaana=theology/theosophical science  

  

the last is adhyAtmavidyA or parA vidyA. The first and second can be covered by 'aparAvidyA' on the lines of the Mundakopanishad.
