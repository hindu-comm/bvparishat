I do not know where the vijnaana is classified as Adhyatmika,Adhibhautika andAdhidaivika. But in Sankhya, duhkha(sorrow) is threefold.(Vide Sankhyakarika 1)

Vachaspati mishra, while commenting on the word duhkha-traya says: duhkha is three fold.

1.Adhyatmika: This is subdivided as Shaariira and Maanasa. Shaariira is of disorder of vaata, pitta and shleshma. Maanasa is mental pollution consists of kaama, krodha moha so on and so forth.

2 Adhibhautika: This kind of sorrow is caused by human beings, quadrupedal animals birds, serpents etc.

3.Adhidaivika: This kind of pain is created by haunting of yaksha, rakshasa etc.

  

The reason why first one is called  adhyaatmika is it can be cured
by internal saadhana.

  

Second and third can be cured by external methods.

  

Adhyatmika= naturo- intrinsic

Ahibhautika=naturo-extrinsic

Adhidaivika=supernatural.

  

These are the terms in English used in translation of Dr. Ganganathajha,
