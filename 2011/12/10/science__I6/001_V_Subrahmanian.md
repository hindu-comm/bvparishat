I think the term here would be 'science of divinities/celestials'

Yes. One could look at them to be so many types. The first one will be vijnAna about something that is completely jaDa, matter/material. The second one is about the chetana tattva that presides, by taking different names/portfolios, over matter/material things. And the last one is about the Ultimate Tattva that pervades/underlies/Rules all that is covered by the first two.
