Dear all,

A small part of a piece of news from the front page of one of the  
English Dailies of Kolkata (dt. 14.12.2011) which I could get to go  
through in a hurry says, a well-known physicist got inspiration from  
the particular concept contained in the Creation Hymn of the Rgveda  
(which says that there was void all over etc.) to dive deep in his  
quest about the mystery surrounding the creation of the universe under  
the title God particle's teasing time, it writes ..Sharma's Rig Veda  
search etc.

  
Though it is directly not connected with what you all are discussing  
with each other regarding adhi daivika, adhi bhautika, adhyatmika etc,  
yet I thought it could be shared with you all.

Best regards,

Soma Basu
