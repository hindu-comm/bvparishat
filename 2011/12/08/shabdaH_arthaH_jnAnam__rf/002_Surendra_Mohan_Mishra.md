namaa.msi [paari.sadye.su](http://paari.sadye.su) !

Thanks to Prof. Korada for enlightening information on the trika of  
s'abda,artha and j\~naana. I have the following difficulty :

Pratyaya as cognition is not concept as is observed.But cognition as  
primarily not involving and later involving concept,is put forth by  
the Naiyaayika-s in the form of Savikalpaka and Nirvikalpaka types of  
perception.Kumaarila agrees to this : cf. asti hyaalocana-j\~naana.m  
prathama.m nirvikalpakam etc.

For Viyaakara.na-s only Savikalpaka holds and no Nirvikalpaka is possible.  
S'aabda j\~naana is savikalpaka according to Naiyaayika-s.  
S'abdaa.h gh-a-.t-a-p-a-.t-aadaya.h,arthaa.h gha.ta-pa.taadayo  
[dravyaa.ni](http://dravyaa.ni),aya.m gha.ta iti ca j\~naanam : tac ca savikalpaka.m =  
conceptualized cognition.

Where does Yoga stand ? I think both ways it's explainable.That's how  
when the A.s.taa\*nga Yoga is resorted to by the Vaidika dars'ana-s,all  
of them will comprehend the process in the light of their own systems  
!

I would like to know this in better details.

Best regards,

SMMIshra
