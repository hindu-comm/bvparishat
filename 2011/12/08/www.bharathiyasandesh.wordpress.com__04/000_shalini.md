सर्वेभ्यो नमः \|

I have found a blog named bharathiyasanesh which is working with good  
intentions to revive the ancient glory of India. Its been trying to  
create awareness among people about ancient Indian wisdom, culture,  
tradition, our rulers, their kingdoms, etc with an attempt to make  
people look back at Bharath( where today's Bharatiyas are just  
thinking the west is the best! and we were and are good for nothing!)  
So its an attempt to open their eyes!

The owner of the blog, Sharadha, is very much interested in reaching  
everyone, as much as possible, make them think what actually existed  
here so that at least then they would raise their heads and proudly  
say we are Bharatiyas! Because we see many people feeling even ashamed  
of recognizing themselves as bharatiyas. As a part of this attempt,  
she has placed a request stating that any one coming up with a similar  
idea, can write an article for her blog. The subject of the article  
may be philosophy, ancient wisdom of Bharath, the ancient discoveries  
of the world, anything which would represent our country, educational  
values of this nation, etc.

There is a special category created for kids, where anything related  
to kids, may be inspiring stories, subhashitas, science, amara, child  
psychology, etc which would help in moulding the future "GREATS",  
would be presented. Any one wishing to donate their knowledge for this  
section which is actually the most important social responsibility,  
would be appreciated! I would request you all personally to please  
join hands with her to make her intentions successful and help her in  
her attempt to make the dream of every Bharatiya today come true!  
Hope one day we will be able to get back the glory of our Bharath!
