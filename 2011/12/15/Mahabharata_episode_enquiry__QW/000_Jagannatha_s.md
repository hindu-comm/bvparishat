Long ago, I had read an incident that took place during Mahabharata war.

  

Awarrior,who had been fighting from the side of pAn.d.avas was attacked by karn.a.

Karn.a killed charioteer of this warrior and destroyed his chariot. But the warrior survived.

He took his bow. But Karn.a, cut off his bow and started to rain arrows. Our warrior took his sword and started to revolve it rapidly.As a result, it acted like a shield and no arrow touched

his body. A pile of arrows formed around him. Karn.a and all the
pAn.d.avas got marvelledon observing this. BhIma rushed towards this warrior. The warrior jumped into the chariot of bhIma and escaped.PAn.d.avas praised him regarding his extra ordinary skill.

  

Recently I remembered this story and checked both karn.aparvan and dron.aparvan but failed to trace out this episode.

  

I request the scholars to inform about identity of this warrior.
