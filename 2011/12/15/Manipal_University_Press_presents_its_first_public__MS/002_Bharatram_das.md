Dear scholars,

  

I have come to hear that anEnglishtranslation of Sri Jayatirtha's
Pramana-paddhati has now been published by Manipal University. As far as I know this is the first english translation ever of this most essential book on epistemology. I would be grateful if somebody can provide me the details of procurement of this book including cost and shipment.

  

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Shrinivas Varakhedi and his team for this good work. I hope and pray that eventuallyat leastall such essential books of Tattvavada will be rendered into English.
