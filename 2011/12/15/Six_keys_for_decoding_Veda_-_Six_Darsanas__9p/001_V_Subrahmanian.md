Namaste.

  

The plan and purport of your paper is laudable. That the six dharshana-s aid the understanding of the Veda mahAtAtparya is quite convincing. That is the reason I think tradition has accepted these as darshana-s for study. 'दृश्यते आत्मतत्त्वं अनेन इति दर्शनम्’. 
Recently during the 10-day kAryashAlaa organized at the pUrNaprajna vidyApItha, Bangalore, the six darshana-s were taken up on each day by a specially invited scholar for presentation. It was good to note that these darshana-s, though owing roots to the Veda itself, owing to their systematically taking a shape, do help understand the Veda and of course the Vedanta shAstra.  परमतमप्रतिषिद्धमनुमतं भवति is a maxim that runs through the prasthAna traya. In specific places Shankara acknowledges sAnkhya/vaisheshika/nyAya/yoga/pUrvamImAmsA darshana;s contribution. I think that is the reason also for Sri Vachaspati Mishra to have written on various darshanas.
