नमो विद्वद्भ्यः  
  

Thank you Prof Subrahmanian  
  
परमतम् अप्रतिषिद्धम् अनुमतं भवति - is for the first time ( as far as I know) said by सुश्रुत in Tantrayuktis -अनुमतम् .  
  
You are right - Vacaspatimisra did works on all Darsanas except
Vaisesika . I think he did two works in Nyaya .  
  
Both Vedangas and Darsanas are a must for any serious student of Sanskrit .  
  
धन्यो’स्मि
