 This is circularity confounded by more circularity weighed down with elliptical redundancies. With or without the decipherment, the IVC has Vedic influences. So all this liturgy is unnecessary.



 Father heras tried to read Tamil into it. All this complication arises because people want to deny the obvious-- Harappans were Vedic Harappans.
