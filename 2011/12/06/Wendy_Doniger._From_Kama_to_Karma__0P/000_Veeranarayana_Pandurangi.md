dear all,

it seems you are all very much bored with oldaged discussions. enjoy the new thoughs of new age by Wendy Doniger.

  

what these liberal thinkers eagerly ignore is a simple point that no one in general public wants to see nude portraits of people they respect, be it durga mataa or bill clinton or manmohan singh.

  

it seems that this paper assumes that there will be no difficulty if one
draws nude pictures of contemporary people because of indias liberal veiws.

enjoy it

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
