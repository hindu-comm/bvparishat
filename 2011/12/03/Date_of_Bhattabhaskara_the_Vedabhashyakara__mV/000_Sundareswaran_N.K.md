Dear Scholars,

what is the date of Bhattabhaskara the commentator of Veda-s?

Usually he is said to be posterior to Sayanacharya, I understand.

(If my understanding is wrong, I may be corrected)

N.S.Sontakke and T.N.Dharmadhikari write in their Edition of TAITTIRIYASAMHITA (Vaidika Samsodhana Mandala,Pune,1970) :

**'The commentary of Bhatta Bhaskara on the TS known as Jnanayajna is brief in comparison with that of Sayana, to which it is anterior in date'.**

( incidentally I would like to have the opinion of learned scholars about this statement also)

What I mainly seek is more information about Bhatta Bhaskara's date.

  

  

With PRANAMS,

N.K.Sundareswaran
