Respected Scholars,  
QUOTE

  
Qualified things do not present the simple thing. Vedic science or Christian may be anything but science. Even suchqualifiers as Indian science or western science are absurd. But development of science in India or for that matter during the Vedic Age is perfectly right.  

UNQUOTE  
  
Great. But "Vedic Age" is not perfectly right for the simple reason that the Vedas\[VedAh\] do not  
belong to an Age. By the term "Vedas" as meant by the ever living paramparA which perpetuates  
the shabdarAshi, the series of mantras are transferred though "intangible" oral tradition without any  
physical support of documents. It is done so in Kerala even today. The unbroken continuity, clarity in articulation  
and sequence are well safe guarded till today across the country. The UNESCO recognizes  
the Vedas as the intangible heritage of humanity precisely for this simple reason.  
  
Coming to adjectives. Veda related research can be called Vedic research.  
Science in the Vedas, why not Vedic Science? Certainly not Hindu or Christian science.  
  
I would like to draw the attention of scholars on the following extract from Dr.Alex Hankey's  
profile\[provided by him, and for this reason I am forwarding this post to him as well\].  
  
QUOTE  
  

Dr Hankey has lectured extensively on the relationship between Vedic Science and Modern Science in Eastern and Western Europe, North America, and India since 1973. He has been concerned with Ayurveda, and involved in research on its fundamental concepts since 1988. In 2007 he joined first Manipal Universal Learning in Bangalore, and then SVYASA, where he directs PhD research. In September 2009, he joined the Institute of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, where he is Dean for foreign students.



The perspective he proposes is that, if it is not possible to understand a Vedic Science in terms of modern science, then advances in modern science are needed to make this possible. For this reason, Vedic Sciences make point the way to making advances in modern science, while those advances may make it possible to understand the Vedic Science concerned in a new light. He has successfully applied this viewpoint to make fundamental advances in both Physics and Biology. Dr Hankey’s most recent work on such relationships between modern science and the ancient Vedic Sciences includes, “The Physics of Samkhya”, and “Decoding Ayurveda”.

UNQUOTE.  
It may be noted that the expression Vedic Science is older than 20 years.
