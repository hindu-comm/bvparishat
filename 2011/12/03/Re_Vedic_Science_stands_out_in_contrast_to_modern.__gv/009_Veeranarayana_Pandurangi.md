dear all,

sorry for disturbing you all in midst. but it is more than that BVP can afford.

  

bvp is a scholarly forum for a healthy debate on Sanskrit language but certainly not personal pretty quarrel. you can discuss and debate anything here for anylong but you can not quarrell with fellow scholars.

  

  

**Please dont kill BVP.**

  

BVP is started with many great purposes, as every BVP member knows and as it appears in every message

  

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)  

  

we are in battle with a common enemy of us.

  

**there are many people who would be happy if BVP dies a premature death. dont help them enjoy it. we have many tasks ahead. we are in a very beginning.**

  

we need to be dignified. if one is exceeding the limits others have to stop him and ask him to be polite.

there is no room for personal accusation. 

  

**I once again appeal to all the esteemed members of this forum to kindly unite and fight a common enemy.**

**  
**

please go through the strings for discussions held earlier on vedic sciences on BVP here-
