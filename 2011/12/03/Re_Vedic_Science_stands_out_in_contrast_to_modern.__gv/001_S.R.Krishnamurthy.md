Dear Dr.Rajaram,



Your declaration that there is no such thing as Vedic Science is funny; especially since by your admission you have no knowledge of Sanskrit. You go by commentaries written by non-scientists; who have not understood the science in VEDAS and dismiss evenimportant mantras as petty trivia; because of their ignorance. I have written a book titledThe Science of Hinduism; where I have discussed some Vedic Mantras which have richscientificcontent. The publishers refer the book to traditionalists, who cannot understand the content of the book, and therefore it remains unpublished.  

It is a pity that our scientists are mentally not yet conducive to take a look at our Vedas whereas Nobel laureates like Feynaman, and renonwned scientists like Stephen Hawking are coming closer to Vedic thingking. I would like to point that mere methodology and terminology alone do not constitute the Science; as our scientists are inclined to believe; but in the core knowledge, as Dr. Rama Murthy, President of NIAS rightly pointed out in his address to the Conference on Cosmography exactly one year ago.

A man of your stature and background should have known what a great physicist, astronomer and mathematician Manu was. The recent discoveries are converging towards what Manu had said eons back. I have calculated the meandistances to Brahmaloka, the axis of this universe, the heaven or Devaloka, and the Pitruloka, on the basis of Manusmrithi and the Bhagavadgita. Since I knowpersonally that you are open minded, I am mentioning these facts, such that you may reassess your dogmas.



yours as before,

s.r.krishna murthy.
