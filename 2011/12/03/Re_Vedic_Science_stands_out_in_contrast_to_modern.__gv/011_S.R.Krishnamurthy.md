To all the esteemed scholars of BVP and otherwise,



Debate was there in Janaka's court, among devas, and Rishis. Debate did not kill any institution; if at all it killed it killed only illogic. If at all invited anybody for debate, in the invitation I have clearly mentioned that it shall not be on personal level; but on facts. Personally I have respect for Dr.Rajaram. But that does not mean that he should be allowed to condemn Vedas of which he has no first hand knowledge. I offered a public debate to establish, though 'illiterally'  
the scientificality of vedas. If it is considered a sacrilege against BVP, I shall humbly quit it than kill it. But kindly beware, that it amounts to admitting the lies that have been hurled at VEDAS. That mischief is being done by the Christian Evangelists, the Communist Evangelists, and our so-called 'intellectuals'. Now, mr. Rajaram has taken their advocacy.

Should I remain mum?



Now, the judgement of honourable Sri Pandurangi and Shri Mishraji is not specific, whether my posting is hurtful or Dr.Rajaram's. I shall quit BVP after hearingtheir decree. But my offer for debate with Dr. Rajaram, remains in force even after my quitting BVP.

Now it is for him to accept or run away.



I await the decree please; to which I am justly entitled.

yours humbly,

s.r.krishna murthy.
