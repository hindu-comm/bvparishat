nama.h pathik.rdbhya.h !

The apparent flaw pointed out by Prof. Sharma ji is correct,but such  
overlaps are there even in KAlidAsa.The 12th syllable is 'v.r' in  
'-v.rk.sA-'.

For me there is a difficulty in the third quarter.Is it  
'pArAs'arya-sutAdimAn' or 'pArAs'arya-sutAdiman' as an adjective to  
'muni-varAn' in the compound ?
