Dear Colleague,

  

The myth of Prajāpati getting infatuated with his daughter originated in the Brāhmaṇa section of the Vedas. It was explained by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa as born of the anthropomorphic idea of the chasing of Uṣas by Sūrya imagined from the dawn being followed by the appearance of the sun.

His belief in the supernatural power of the *yajña* apart, Kumārila, as many have noted, was a rationalist and had mocked at the idea of sarvajña īśvara.

The myth continued in the Purāṇas with modifications



Best
