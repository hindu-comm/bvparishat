Dear Dr Singh!

You can find different versions of this story in the Brahmana texts and Purana-s.

Here let me cite one such version - that of AITAREYA BRAHMANA.

The third अध्याय of the third पंचिका has the legend as follows:

प्रजापतिर्वे स्वां दुहितरं अभ्यध्यायात............परोक्ष प्रिया इव हि देवाः

'Prajapati got very much infatuated towards his daughter.some say that this daughter is 'dyauh'. Some others say that it is '*ushas*'. He mated with her assuming the form of a deer. *Deva*-s noticed this act of *Prajapati* which was never done by anybody till then. They frantically searched for an appropriate person who can warn and control *Prajapati*. Among themselves they searched for the one who can punish *Prajapati*, but in vain. Then their anguish and anger got united . And it took the form of a *deva..* It was *bhutapati.* ...'

The story continues like this: 'Gods requested *Bhutapati* to punish *Prajapati.* The former agreed to it with a condition. He should be given the lordship of पशु - s. Gods acceded to the condition. Then Bhutapati approached and pierced Prajapati with his arrow. Prajapati jumped upwards to avoid the blow. This form of Prajapati (jumping upwards) is the asterism मृगशिरः . The Bhutapati who pierced (वेधनकर्ता ) became मृगाव्याध , the asterism of AArdraa. And the female deer (the daughter of Prajapati in the form of female deer) became the asterism ROHINI.......'

  

  

We can find another version in Satapathabrahmana (1st Kanda, 6th Prapaathaka, 2nd Brahmana) also.

  

  

With pranams,

N.K.Sundareswaran
