The Puranas were primarily written to expound the vedic expositions in a language that even the children may understand and remember, when they cannot understand the Vedas. The authors made it figurative, and later overdid so. This episode, Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati quotes, is from Brahmvaivarthapurana; and is totally baseless. I quote relevent excerpts from my research book 'The Science of Hinduism'  
  
EXCERPTS  
Now let us see what Maharshi Dayanand Saraswathi says about some Puranic perorations. s\] (In many puranas like the Brahmavaivartha, which are actually recent there are many false stories written. One such story reads thus: the four-faced Brahman, the originator of the progeny of the world, embraced his own daughter Saraswathi for sexual intercourse). He rightly condemns such distortions as false, but goes on to explain the episode as a metaphor, employing devious arguments and ends up himself trapped in his own explanations (xuÉÉqÉç SÒÌWûiÉUqÉç GzrÉuÉiÉç zÉÏbÉëqÉç AprÉkrÉÉrÉiÉç), \[He dashed at his own daughter like a beast\], thereby missing the true meaning and its actual ramifications. He attributes the origin of the above tale to AithareyaBrahmaNa (3-33), which reads as below.

(Prajapathi pounced upon his own daughter. Some say she was the day; some others as Ushas (dawn). He, assuming the form of dark stag, enters her, who had turned into a ruddy doe) - meaning given by the interpreters. Based on Nirukta, the Maharshi explains:

(The relationship between rain and earth is that of a father and daughter. Therefore earth is like his daughter. That rain impregnates her through pouring the semen-like water. This is an allegory).  
  
What a pity that even great scholars are misinterpreting Vedas and thereby derogating them! Vulgarity consists in that very thought of a sexual relationship between a father and daughter, which is unnatural; and hence contemptible, even as an allegory. But there is no allegory at all, no alankara, in the texts. Why would Brahman take the form of dark stag? Did he suffer from a sense of guilt? Or was he afraid that somebody might notice his misdeed? When it is maintained that he had not created any body else (except Saraswati, his daughter?), where was the scope for anybody to notice his incest of Saraswati? Had He created Saraswati, without sex, then he could create the whole universe without sex. If He needed her to create the Universe, where did she spring from, prior to creation? All these questions are to be explained by the interpreters who maintain as above! Besides, where is Prajapathi and where is parjanya the rain? There is not even a remotest link between the verse in question and the interpretation.  
  
First of all, duhita, the word that is repetitively employed in the Vedas, is not properly understood, in the Vedic sense. The root duh (prapurane) is defined as prapuranam tyajanam. Duhita is the diminutive form of duhaa. Foremost of all we have to understand why duh alone is used extensively and not tyaj, though the two are shown as synonymous.  
  
First, Tyajanam is refuse and is therefore fit to be discarded. But,

(One who speaks for another is dubhashi and one, which yields milk for another, is dughaa or duhaa). Further, the root tyaj implies that the tyagii suffers a loss or deficiency by tyaga. Alarka donated his eyes to a blind man, and thereby lost his vision. But dhuk, one who gives for the sake of others, never suffers loss, deformity or deficiency by yielding, yeaning or ceding. Ì²iÉÏrÉÉjÉåï WûÉlÉålÉ WûÉiÉÉ WûÏlÉÉå FlÉÉå uÉÉ lÉ pÉuÉÌiÉ!  
  
Second, here, the creation of the universe is being illustrated. God Prajapathi is being shown as the provider (dhuk) of the food for the world, symbolized by the earth (duhitaa), to show the relationship of the cow and calf, (notice both are female) indicating the motherly warmth and affection with which the provision is ceded. This metaphor illustrates the oneness of the duhaa and the beneficiary duhita. That is why the adage has emerged: AÉiqÉÉ uÉæ mÉÑ§ÉlÉÉqÉÉÍxÉ\|. Apparently they are two. But in reality, by sharing the body and the soul, they are but one.  
  
The third reason is that the word duhitaa should correspond with the murti, that is, bhutaa, which is feminine. The beauty of the allegory is that there is no milkman (dogdhaa).  
  
But the most beautiful pronouncement of this usage is to expound that God the Infinite (puurnaH), by creating any number of universes like this, remains the Infinite that He is, and will not become deficient at all.

Infinity minus infinity is still infinity only!

Mathematically, it is presented as: ¥ + ¥ = ¥; ¥ - ¥ = ¥!  
Hence the meaning of the sentence in AB 3-33 becomes:- the Brahman approached his own cession. He entered the same as an enlivening ray of energy (GzrÉ). GMçü here means a ray of life (Brahman). The cession was a mere bhutaa (form), without life. So to induce life into it, a tiny ray of His entered it.  
This is the actual meaning of the sentence in AB 3-33. There is no trace of any suggestion of a daughter at all. Besides, without His entry thereunto, there is no life in that form. How can anybody think of sexual intercourse with a lifeless object? The word rohita is given the common meaning of red. But here it is only the past participle of the root ruh, meaning in the context that which has been raised. A lifeless object cannot be ruddy. Further their interpretation of rushya and rohita bhuta as buck and doe does not find any support. The interpretation given by me is held out by the Vedas at other places.

(Bringing out from the water a manly form, he enlivened it – Ait.U. 1-3)  
  
The Aithreyopanishad, which is an elucidation of AithreyaBrahmaNa, is crystal clear that a manly form was lifted from the water! So there is no question of daughter. He enlivened it.

\[From its tapas, the body was formed (1.2). He entered the same through an aperture in the crown of head (1.12). Ibid\]. Since some scholars have questioned my contention, I will elaborate.
