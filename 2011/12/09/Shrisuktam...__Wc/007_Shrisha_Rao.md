Perhaps you mean that the श्रीसूक्त is a खिल of another शाखा like the बाष्कल or आश्वलायन -- the शाकल्यशाखा is quite extant and is what is called "the" RV in common parlance; it is not a खिल but खिलs of other lost recensions are appended to it. The book "Devi Mahatmya: The Crystallization of the Goddess Tradition" by Thomas Coburn (Motilal, 1988) has some information but I don't recall that it identifies which शाखा each variant of the श्रीसूक्त comes from, and in any case his analyses would be regarded as irreverent by traditionalists and speculative even by others.
