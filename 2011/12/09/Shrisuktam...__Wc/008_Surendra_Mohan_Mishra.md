Thanks.I said that the S'riisuukta is an integral part of the  
Aas'valaayana s'aakhaa of the .Rgveda recently published by the  
IGNCA,Delhi;earlier it was known as an appendix to the S'aakala  
recension.Whether it formed a part of the Baa.skala I don't know.The  
variant readings available in the tradition ought to be  
studied.Regards,SMM
