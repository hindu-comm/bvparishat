Dear Scholars,  
Could someone cite the observations on childhood in Sanskrit Traditional Texts?  
Please provide with the references on childâ€™s behavioral pattern.  
Also please mention the various elements that influence shaping the character of a child according to Indian context.  
Thank you.  
Sajeevkumar
