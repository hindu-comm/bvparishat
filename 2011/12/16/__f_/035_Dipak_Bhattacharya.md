Dear Colleagues,

  

 There cannot be any question of drawing hasty conclusion by me because the matter is under

investigation. I hinted at possibilities only.

  

 What is certain is that the available Atharvavedic literature does not support the existence of such a sentence in it. Moreover the Minor Upaniṣads barring one, or may be two, came into being between Gauḍapāda and the Sekoddeśaṭīkā ('The Catuṣkāya doctrine in the Mantranaya' *Journal of Research* Visva Bharati II.1 1977-78, 92-131). Late ancillaries include them too. There may be such lost sources. But the Saṃhitās of the AV are so structured that such a sentence would not fit into it. Only one Brāhmaṇa of it exists and two ritual sutras of antiquity (Kauśika, Vaitāna); they do not have it nor the Pariśiṣṭas, nor the known Upanishads.. May be works like the Paiṭhīnasi-Grhyasu. had it. But we cannot verify that. Other unpublished works accessible to me are being looked into.

  

 Subject to further verification, till now my impression is that of error. Dr Pandurangi has himself pointed to mistakes by the Shabarasvaamin. Why could not others commit that?

  

Best
