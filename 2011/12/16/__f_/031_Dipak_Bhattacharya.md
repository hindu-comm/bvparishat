Dear Colleagues,

I am writing in English for many scholars have requested that important discussions be summarized in English.

Bhaṭṭa Someśvara’s assertion that तस्माद्दीक्षितस्य विज्ञातस्य क्रीतराजकस्य भोज्यंभवति is an Atharvavedic statement cannot be confirmed from the **Saṃhitā or ancillary book** of the Atharvaveda. I searched into all the indexes (VVRI, New Vedic Concordance etc ) and Durgamohan Bhattacharyya’s unpublished Pāda-index of the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā but did not find the sentence.

As you know medieval scholars regarded many minor Upaniṣads as *ātharvaṇī śruti*. Or Someśvara might have depended on some late Paddhati like the Prayogabhānu. These paddhatis often erred.

In any case if I find the sentence in any unpublished work of the AV I shall let you know. Till then

Best wishes for all

DB
