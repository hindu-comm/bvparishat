Every writer has his own writing style and likes. Let everyone decide on his own.  
If someone wants to write in simple language, let him do so. If someone finds error in that language and rectifies to convey exact idea, as navyanaiyAyika-s, let him do so.  
In the same way using sandhi or not is personal choice.  
I don't think that language of kAlidAsa, even if not understood by some people, is less charming. So, if someone prefers difficult language to generate charm, then no objection should be raised. He, who is doing so, know well that he is not writing for all. There exists something called adhikAra. Even those who write easy Sanskrit, can not say that their writing is for all, because their writings are for only beginners of specific language.  
It is better to push yourself to reach higher levels, instead of wishing their non-existence and asking all to come to lower-level.
