Professor Narang has drawn attention to an important element in the history of Indian writing which is little discussed by Sanskrit scholars and hence should be paid due attention with thanks to Professor Narang. This may raise old debated questions, but that is welcome. We have to remember that Kharoṣṭhi’s Semitic mode of writing from right to left was not accepted in India. If the mode proves to be the cause of its rejection then, its role as contributor notwithstanding, it will be difficult to prove Kharoṣṭhi to be the origin of Brahmī. For, the question will naturally be raised ‘How could the other mode of writing from left to right be preferred unless it had already a place in a now lost script of independent Indian origin?’ It means that we have to accept Brāhmī and Kharoṣṭhi as heterogeneously developed with mutual influence and the former as basically of native origin that many have debated. Many Indian authorities have hesitated to attach too much importance to Kharoṣṭhi or its origin that is Phoenician for this reason among others. 

Though none has criticized, my previous mail had many typographical slips. They are corrected, as far as I could note, in a new presentation below.

Dear Colleagues,



There was no intention of creating difficulty for the reader by adopting the normal Brahmī orthography of forming a syllable out of the final consonant and its following initial vowel as in देवमीळे for देवम् ईळे. This is the normal orthography of all Brahmī origin scripts of India... But it does not intend any pedantic display. Would we say देवम् ईळे or देवमीळे? This orthographic correspondence of what we say and what we write was taken note of and praised as an independent creation of Indian Pandits by A. H. Dani, the noted student of A. S. Altekar. Whether it was created by Pandits or traders may be debated but the fact remains that this is typically Indian Brahmī.

\[….\]

So this is of dialectal origin and the orthographic rule it has brought into being must be regarded as irreversible. What an adoption of the Roman orthography where each word is separated from its preceding and following ones can do will be seen in, with due respect, Raghu Vira’s transliteration of Barret’s edition of the Kashmir ms of the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā. Raghu Vira’s orthography was not accepted by scholars.

For this reason forsaking the unique characteristic of syllable-formation in Brahmī origin scriptsis undesirable. That would deprive them of the power of representing some correspondence between what we speak and what we write. 

I admit that difficulties do arise. There are at least two things that we can do to ameliorate The first measure will be avoiding Sandhi as far as possible. Secondly, some stylistic changes are called for. We have examples before us – Patañjali, Jinendrabuddhi, Madhusūdana of the *Prasth**ānabhedāḥ*, Vāsudeva Dīkṣita. The nineteenth century saw Satyavrata Sāmaśramin, Śaṅkar Pandurang Pandit, the twentieth saw Abhyankar, Vidhuśekhara Śāstrī, Chinnasvāmī Śāstrī and many others. Their style was easier than the one in the following verse (with due respect) श्रोत्रार्हन्तीचणैर्गुण्यैर्महर्षिभिरहर्दिवम् (note - not निशम्)। तोष्टूय्यमानोप्यगुणो विभुर्विजयतेतराम्।
