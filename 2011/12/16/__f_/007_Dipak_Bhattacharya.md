Dear Colleagues,

I do not have Ganganath Jha’s annotated translation of the Mīmāṃsābhāṣya or the Tantrvārttika in my personal collection. Since our University library will open on 27^(th) I request for kind help in the following matter.

Will any scholar find for me the exact source of the following example given by Jaimini on the priority of Śruti in Śruti-Smti-virodha in the bhāṣya to ‘हेतुदर्शनाच्च’, मी.सूत्र १.३.२.४ **: **बुभुक्षमाणाः केचित्क्रीतराजकस्य भोजनमाचरितवन्तः।...तत एषा स्मृतिरित्यवगम्यते।
कुमारिल comments क्रीतराजकभोज्यान्नवाक्यं चाथर्ववैदिकम्। न तस्याप्रमाणत्वे किंचिदप्यस्ति कारणम्। I long thought that this must be a part of the nārāśaṃśīgāthā of the Kuntāpasūktas. But I recently discovered that it is not so. It is quite possible that I am making a silly error in being unable to find out the source. But this not in the Saṃhitā. Ganganath Jha has possibly traced the source. Hence this request. If I get the source in the meantime I will inform.

With thanks in advance

and

Best wishes
