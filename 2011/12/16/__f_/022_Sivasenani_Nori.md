Sir



If I could rephrase your view, it is that if any idea which could be expressed using simple words is expressed using high-level Sanskrit, there couldbe kalpanaagauravadosha.



It depends on what high-level Sanskrit is. If it is an ornate style, with sentences running into pages,using obscure words, difficult constructs and such, such a fault would indeed result.



However, ifhigh-levelSanskrit uses verbs, uses prefixes (upasargas) thoughtfully, expresses meanings precisely,uses all the roots available, and expresses powerful ideas concisely(say, by using compound words or words ending in the ablative case to replace a whole paragraph), and omits words like asti which could easily be supplied by the reader, there is indeed no dosha.



Regarding sandhi, Saastra says that it iscompulsory internally (as in harau), in compound words (bhaanoodayah) and poetry (otherwise metre would be compromised) and that it is optional in prose or while speaking. That said, most mature writers preferto let sandhi be even in prose in most places. Why? It is a habit, as they routinely do that in other places. In fact this kind of behaviour is seen in native speakers of most languages. For instance, Americans prefer contractions like 'betcha' (bet you, which itself has many connotations), or the way the English say 'a cup of tea' - what we see here is the tendency to make sandhi when the component words are common. Sanskrit words are indeed very intimate friends to vidvaans so they tend to make the sandhi.
