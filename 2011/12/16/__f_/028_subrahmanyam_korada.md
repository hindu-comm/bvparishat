नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Sanskrit Language and its use --  

  

’दैवी वाग् व्यवकीर्णेयम् अशक्तैः अभिधातृभिः’ - says Bhartrhari in
Vakyapadiyam ( 1-155) - the divine speech became degenerated because of some people who did not have the capacity to pronounce perfectly .

  

Patanjali discusses pronunciation under ' तदस्य तदस्मिन् स्यादिति ’ ( 5-1-16 ) .

  

In German too there are lengthy compound words - who introduced them ? Chinese and Japanese Languages are very difficult to learn ( Pictography) .

  

As far as Sanskrit is concerned it is believed to be that of Devatas initially and this is said by Sages with Yogasakti .

Such facts do not require any historical proof , nor is it possible to prove .

  

Certain subjects are by nature difficult , so also languages .

  

Certain subject is difficult for someone , say Mathematics , for others it is not so .

  

कष्टं शास्त्रम् , दुरवगाहमित्यर्थः - कौमुदी , कृदन्तः -- for a scholar
it is not difficult .

  

Then what does it mean - difficult ?

  

The बुद्धिस्थानम् ( fifth place from लग्नम् ) and बृहस्पति ( बुद्धिकारकः )  in one's जातकचक्रम् (Horoscope) indicate the level of
sharpness of brain . If there is any one of the three सम्बन्धाः ( 1.परिवर्तनम् / swapping , 2. सहावस्थनम् ,3.दृष्टिः)  to बुद्धिस्थानम्
or बृहस्पति ( this is just an example ) with शनिः (मन्दः) then the degree of sharpness is considerably reduced . As a result the Native ( जातकः)cannot comprehend a subject quickly and cannot retain the comprehended material for long or does not have समयस्फूर्तिः !

Kalidasa in उत्तरकलामृतम्  and Varahamihira in बृहज्जातकम्  assert that पूर्वजन्मकर्मफलम्  is the cause .

  

Ayurveda shows remedy but to some extent and at an early stage of age only - सरस्वतीलेह्यम् , सरस्वतीतैलम् besides food restrictions - oil , coconut , वार्ताकम् ( brinjal) , बिम्बफलम् , माषा: (अशेषशेमुषीमुषणमाषापूपं खादामि - श्रीहर्षः) etc .

  

घृतेन वर्धते बुद्धिः क्षीरेणायुष्यवर्धनम् !

शाकेन वर्धते व्याधिः मांसं मांसेन वर्धते !!

  

So it is a conbination of वेदान्तः - ज्योतिषम् - आयुर्वेदः !

  

It may be borne in mind that nobody can satisfy the ' so called ' common man / सामान्यमानवः ! Still a common man can be presented who cannot understand the very simple Language . Because he does not improve his vocab nor is it possible to explain every term to his satisfaction .

  

For example the term गुणः means differently in अयुर्वेदः - सांख्यम् - न्यायः - मीमांसा - व्याकरणम् etc.

  

Using सन्धिः and समासः etc.--

  

I agree that it is advisable to avoid सन्धिः and समासः as far as possible .  But in certain cases it is a must and a lot of time is consumed in avoiding समासः ! 

  

Take the following ( कादम्बरी - महाश्वेतावृत्तान्तः ) -

  

यदेतदनुमरणं नाम तदतिनिष्फलम् ! अविद्वज्जनाचरित एष मार्गः ! मोहविलसितमेतत् ! अज्ञातपद्धतिरियम् ! ....

  

In the above quotation the compound words are very forceful , they lose their force if used as व्यस्ताः !

  

Same is the case with some शास्त्रीयप्रयोगाः also .

  

धन्यो’स्मि

गायत्रीजपः etc may be helpful to some extent .
