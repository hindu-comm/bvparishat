I think there is no need to come to a hurriedconjecturethat"Someśvara might have depended on some late Paddhati like the Prayogabhānu."someshvara lived at least one thousand years ago. this time period is more than enough for the natural or accidental death of many shakhas of atharvan which are counted by as nine by patanjali, but originally 12 as per a skanda quotation by Madhvacharya.

  

even kumarila quoted a shatyayana shruti in same context. I dont think that is available in present time.
