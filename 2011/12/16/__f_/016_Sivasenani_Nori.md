To all the learned scholars who are benefiting many with their knowledge



I pray thatuse ofgood Sanskrit be continued. Why? Here are the grounds:



1\. Nowadays Sanskrit is dumbed down enough everywhere for that to be repeated here as well. (Kridantas replacing verbs;only a few - may be less than 400 -roots being used even to form those kridantas; the over-use of asti etc.).



2\. Texts where we have very good style of prose - mahaabhaashyam, dhvanyaalokavritti, Saankarabhaashyam - are studiously avoided because thought the language is simple and attractive, the subject matter is difficult to grasp. Others like daSakumaaracaritam or Pancatantra are not prescribed, so not studied. Students generally read 'rahasyas' which are like guides and purposefully written in simplified Sanskrit described in 1 above.



3\. BVP is one place where one gets to read somegood Sanskrit prose (and some good poetry as well occasionally), apart from books likenibadddhaSatam. This is good as it exposes students, beginners and learners to good prose.



4\. Without expsoure, it will disappear, much like Prakrit is now disappearing from texts of dramas.



5\. If visandhi is preferred in prose, slowly it spreads to poetry (as evidenced by the request that padapaaTha of Veda be quoted), which is against Saastram. Chandas has to be sacrosanct - that kingpin amongst Saastras, Vyakarana itself becomes secondary to chandas. Even those who do not believe in the Vedas, ought to respect their integrity and quote extracts as they are.



6.The perceived difficult of reading good Sanskritis only felt during the first few attempts - say, five. Once one makes an attempt and gets used to it, one becomes much richer for the effort.



7\. We need to consider thework ethic we want to foster: Do we move up, or do we drag everybody down? As Patanjali says in the Mahabhashya, यत्नः क्रियताम्.



8\. The choice of guna - maadhurya,ojas or prasaada -to be used should be that of the author.



9\. Finally, language reflects the personality of the author / speaker. Consider: Nehru and Laloo Prasad Yadav. It has been said:



आचारः कुलमाख्याति वपुराख्याति भोजनम् ।

वचनं श्रुतमाख्याति स्नेहमाख्याति लोचनम् ।।



With hope in the heart that good Sanskrit prose flourishes on BVP, and a prayer on the lips



सरस्वती श्रुतमहतां महीयताम्
