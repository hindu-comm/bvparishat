Respected Dipakji,



I am not a scholar; but still an interestedresearcher. You have rightly pointed out that many traditional scholars have written commentaries, which are materially not correct. you are right. I have come accross many lapses in Sayanabhashya of Rigveda; and Yajurveda. I had come to the wrong conclusion that because he was not versed in physical sciences, he had erred in interpreting scientific mantras.

But when I read an article of Dr. T.N.Dharmadhikari, a well-known Vedic Scholar, in which he postulates that the great Sayana was the chief editor of the commentaries, and the actual commentaries were written by a number of scholars; I was convinced of it. For Sayana has written introduction to every sukta in an inimitably erudite style; whereas the mantras have been annotated in too prosaic a style, that one cannot associate with the introduction. Secondly, in many a place, the commentary is wide off the mark with reference to the Introduction; and at some places, is totally irrelevent.

Though this has nothing to do with the question that is going round, i posted this because ot the question of the reliability of the commentary is common.
