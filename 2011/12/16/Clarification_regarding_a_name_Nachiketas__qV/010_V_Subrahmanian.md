My thanks to all the scholars who responded to this question. Now it is clear that for vyavahara the name could be 'Nachiketa.' 

  

As I type this one more question, for vyavahara alone, comes up. After upanayanam what will this boy say in 'pravara'?
\[अभिवादये......शर्मा.नामाहमस्मि भो:\] \[नचिकेतशर्मा ?\]
