I came late to read this topic. The topic revolves around the two forms of a name naciketa or "naciketas" found in Sanskrit literature, which uses both these forms according to the rules of grammar it follows. Either the word ending in short "a" or ending in consonant "s" which would be declined differently in Sanskrit Language.

  

Now the question was:

  

> 
> > Kindly provide the correct way to be adopted in the above cases > keeping in mind the present day vyavahAra in schools, employment > places, etc. 
> > 
> >   

  

which doesn't specify the language of present day of "vyavayAra" in which the name is to be used. The direct answer to the question would be if the language in the present day "vyavahAra" is Sanskrit or any inflectional language, it would be declined according to the grammar of the language and not according to the language of the name in which it occurs. Bus is never declined in plural as Busses in any Indian language which use the English word Bus. In the same way, the Sanskrit word irrespective of its original form, would be used according to the language in which it is used and not according to the Sanskrit Grammar. If the language is Sanskrit, it can be declined in both ways following its usage in the Vedic Literature. Naciketas is the popular form in usage and the other Naciketa is inferred form from the derived form "nAciketa" as repeatedly presented in many messages.

  

Thanks for all contributors to this topic.
