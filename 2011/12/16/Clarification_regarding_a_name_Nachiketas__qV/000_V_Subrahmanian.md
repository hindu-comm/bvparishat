Respected Vidwans,

  

Supposing someone wants to name his son 'Nachiketas' how is the word written in English: Nachiketa OR NachiketaaH OR Nachiketas?

  

And in Sanskrit: नचिकेताः ? And how to address the boy while conversing with him: 'NachiketaaH' OR 'Nachiketas' or Nachiketaa? 

  

Kindly provide the correct way to be adopted in the above cases keeping in mind the present day vyavahAra in schools, employment places, etc. 

  

Regards,

subrahmanian.v
