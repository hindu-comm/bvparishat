namo vidvadbhyah



The first question was - how can be the name - nacikeatAh or naciketa etc.



The answer is - since naciketAh is difficult in terms of Language (English etc) and Vyavahara one can go for 'naciketa' as it is also available there in Veda itself .



If it is about - who was naciketAh , whereelse is he discussed etc that will be a different issue to be discussed .



I think am clear .
