Respected Scholars,  
I would like to share my anxiety at least on two of the many points  
mentioned by Mr. Sivasenani. It is the high time to migrate from the  
non-idiomatic, ambiguous and ready made spoken language system into an  
idiom of what our ancestors taught us. No doubt ancient popular  
Sanskrit dramas are perfect examples. No language is enriched or  
flourished by adopting idioms of local dialects.  
Prakrits were being the beauties of each dramas. I feel it is not that  
difficult write in Prakrit if one learns to compare the syntactic  
structure with Sanskrit Chhayas and could be interpreted well. We have  
such sources like gaahaasattasayee (gathasaptasati) and texts in  
different dramas of Kalidasa, Bhasa, Bhattanarayana etc. And Prakrit  
too are melodious when they are structured metrically.  
I request scholars to write both proses and poems in Prakrit too to  
make sure that they are not outdated.  
Thanks. Regards,  
Narayanan

1\. Nowadays Sanskrit is dumbed down enough everywhere for that to be  
repeated here as well. (Kridantas replacing verbs; only a few - may be  
less than 400 - roots being used even to form those kridantas; the  
over-use of asti etc.).

4\. Without expsoure, it will disappear, much like Prakrit is now  
disappearing from texts of dramas.

N. Siva Senani
