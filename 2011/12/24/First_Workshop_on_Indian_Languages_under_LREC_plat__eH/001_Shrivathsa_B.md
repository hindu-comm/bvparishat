hariH OM,  
  
one hates to spread negativity (i apologise to everyone in the group for this, but i hope you will take it in the right spirit), but it amuses one to see such grand declarations like:  
*"The MHRD through its language agency called CIIL and many academic institutions across the country has set up a Linguistic Data Consortium for Indian Languages (LDCIL). This consortium, being set up in the lines of the LDC at the University of Pennsylvania (USA)"*  
  
The LDCIL site hasn't been updated since 2008... one may see the following page:  
<http://www.ldcil.org/workInProgress.aspx>  
one feels amused that the same people who haven't even digitized a good dictionary in a searchable form are talking such grand things.  
  
The apte sanskrit dictionary has been digitized by university of chicago in addition to several other regional language dictionaries. almost all sanskrit dictionaries online have been put up by westerners, so also text corpuses (gretil comes first to mind). Leave alone text corpuses, the much celebrated DLI project has poured money into scanning books where the indexing would have been done better if primary-school children would have handled it (just try searching for a book and you will understand)! What is more, they won't even allow google to crawl their meta data!  
  
As always, in bhaaratam, individuals are putting in efforts where the government has failed (Indian-Lexicon-Kalyanaraman, sanskritdocuments, sanskritworld etc. etc.)  
  
I hope that this workshop doesn't stop at pontification.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
