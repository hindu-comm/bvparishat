Dear Sirs,



In my research of Valmiki Ramayana and some Vedic hymns, I have given new connotations to some Sanskrit word apprpriate to the context; in the absence of which the texts have been misinterpreted. For example, I had already posted on this platform the word 'Khara' in Valmiki Ramayana where it has been annotated as 'gardabha' on the basis of Amarakosha; whereas the word stands for 'aeroplane' (khe ramhatiti kharaH). It is fully described in my unpublished book "Enigmas in Valmiki Ramayana Explained".

There are several such words in the field of philosophy which are misinterpreted; and thereby have become bone of contention unnecessarily. Is there any Indian agency, official or otherwise, which is documenting such efforts for public use?



For example, Ushas is misinterpretedas the mother of the Day! Mother and child are commonly seen together. At no time the Dawn and the Day can be seen together. Yet our scholars blindly accept such misinterpretations without questioning and arriving at the right solutions; thereby endorsing such absurdities as Brahma had incest with his daughter Saraswathi; which is patently false.



I shall be obliged for any suggestion from any quarter to thwart all such infamous misinterpretations in our commentaries of ancient texts.
