Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



(1)My visit to India for attending WSC



\(2\) Shree Krishna-Global or Local Personality?



I appreciate Dr. R. N. Iyengar's article on Historical Krishna. He mentioned "Sannihiti Lake". Where was it exactly? I am thankful to him for mentioning "Sannihiti Lake". I always learn new things from his articles. However his estimate of activity around Mahabharata Battle between 1543 BC to 1443 BC (Do not look at exact years but the century) may produce some conflict with other historical incidents outside of the subcontinent unless ifone confines all Mahabharata conflict between Saraswati and Ganga region (following O.P.Bharadwaj) around the ancient region where now Delhi stands. My research shows that many kingdoms mentioned in Mahabharata were to the west of the Indian subcontinent. Mahabharata was Maha and extended towards west. Krishna was global person at that time, his and his tribes' activities were extended over much larger geographical area.



My visit: I will be attending WSC in Delhi from Jan3 to Jan7. Then return to Bombay. Further program not yet set. I will be in India up to Feb 15.



Those who would like to see my power point presentations on (a) Mahabharata-History or Myth? and (b) Internal Beauty of Sanskrit based on Phonemic Symbolism tied to Physical properties of articulated sounds, please send e-mail to me at [giravani@juno](). com.



In the past two years I educated myself through interaction with scholars on this list. Research never ends. I wish you all a happy and prosperous new year 2012. Sincerely N.R.Joshi
