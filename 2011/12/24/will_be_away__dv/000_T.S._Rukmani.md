This is just to inform the parishad that I will away for a few months and will not be able to access my e.mail regularly. So please suspend sending messages to me temporarily from tomorrow the 24^(th) Dec to April 5^(th) 2012. I know I will miss a number of important messages and information on a number of topics. But it cannot be helped. Thank you for your understanding.
