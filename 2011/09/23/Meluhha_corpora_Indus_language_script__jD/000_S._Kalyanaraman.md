### Meluhha corpora: Indus language, script

Meluhha as a language and Indus script as a messaging system in contact/interaction areas are attested archaeologically and in epigraphia of indus script inscriptions. Corpora (plural of 'corpus') related to Meluhha as a language and Indus script epigraphia have become available, thanks to the dedicated work of many researchers.
