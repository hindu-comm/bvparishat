The problem occurs on some machines because some TrueType fonts are not embedded in these documents themselves. This is a significant problem even for English for readers from China, Japan, and certain European countries because their machines may not have a full set of Roman fonts while they have better CJK font coverage. It is in general better for PDF files to embed all the fonts they use so that they will render/print correctly across all machines and systems.

A simple search on Google for "pdf font embedding" will bring up many relevant hits with more information.
