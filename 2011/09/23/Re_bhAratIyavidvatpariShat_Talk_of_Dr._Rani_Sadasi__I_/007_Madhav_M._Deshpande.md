Dear Prof. Murty,

I have tried to read your pdfs, but some fonts are not appearing  
correctly. Perhaps, I need to install some of those fonts on my  
machine to be able to read these pdfs correctly. I would appreciate  
if you could specify which fonts you have used in your document.  
Thanks for your attention.

\> Thanks for your enquiry about my paper on phonetics. As you suggested me I am enclosing here with two of my papers on phonetics for your appreciation and suggestions. Of course both of them have something common and also some additional information in each. Both the papers are neither critical or comparative. They are more informative by nature. I am in my progressive efforts now for a critical and comparative extension of the same. Pl. find the attachments.
