Respected Scholars,

The following verse has been quoted in the 1st Vimarsha of the Vyaktiviveka by Mahimabhatta. I would like to know the original source of the verse. If anybody knew about it I request you all to kindly inform the details having all informations possible about the text, context and verse number etc.

  

सरस्यामेतस्यामुदरवलिवीचीविलुलितं

यथा लावण्याम्भो जघनपुलिनोल्लङ्घनपरम्।

यथा लक्ष्यश्चायं चलनयनमीनव्यतिकर-

स्तथा मन्ये मग्नः प्रकटकुचकुम्भस्मरगजः।।



Regards,  
Narayanan
