***Respected scholars,***

***Seeing the smuggling and vandalism committed and patronised by the Governments in India, where even the Nobel prize of Rabindra Nath Tagore could be pilfered, I feel the Hindu artifacts are safer where they are.***

***Yours truly,***

> > > > **Introduction** > > > > In August or September 1976 an Indian labourer who lived near the > > site of a ruined Hindu temple at Pathur (Arul Thiru Viswanatha Swamy > > Temple), in the state of Tamil Nadu, uncovered a metal object (the > > ‘Pathur Nataraja’) while excavating foundations for a new cow shed. > > This object was known locally as a Siva Nataraja and was shown to > > belong to a family of bronze Hindu idols called the Pathur Bronzes. > > It was subsequently dated to the Chola period (9th to 13th Century) > > and was probably buried to prevent discovery by invading Muslims. > > The farmer sold the idol to a dealer in religious artefacts and > > eventually it ended up with a Bombay dealer (who was untraceable at > > the time of court proceedings). > > > > State officials in Tamil Nadu had learnt of the various sales > > associated with the idol and had begun their own investigations but > > by 1982 the whereabouts of the object was still unknown. In June of > > that year Robert Borden, of the Bumper Corporation of Canada, bought > > a Nataraja in good faith from a London dealer called Sherrier (who > > later produced what was found to be false provenance documents for > > the object). Bumper obtained a permit to export the bronze from > > England but did not do so as they were advised it required > > conservation. The ‘London Nataraja’ was taken to the British Museum > > for assessment and conservation but later seized by the Metropolitan > > Police as part of an operation to return stolen religious objects to > > their rightful owners. Bumper then brought a claim against the > > Police for the return of the object and damages. > > > > **The Trial** > > > > There were five claimants in the case: 1. Union of India 2. State of > > Tamil Nadu 3. Thiru R. Sadagopan, claiming as the fit representative > > of the Temple 4. Arul Thiru Viswanatha Swamy Temple 5. Sivalingam. > > This was another surviving object of religious worship from the > > Temple. It is a sculptured stone phallus and in a temple of its > > period would have been positioned in the sanctum to be the focus of > > worship. It was restored as an object of worship at the Temple after > > its rediscovery > > > > There were two main issues: 1. Identity – that the ‘London Nataraja’ > > was the one and the same as the ‘Pathur Nataraja’ 2. Title – If they > > were the same, who of the claimants had the superior title to the > > object > > > > *Identity* > > > > The case stating that they were the same object was supported by > > expert evidence on stylistic grounds of similarity between the > > ‘London Nataraja’ and the Pathur Bronzes and expert evidence of a > > metallurgical, geological and entomological nature. > > > > Bumper’s case was supported by Dr. Presencer (considered an honest > > witness) who stated that he’d seen the antique object (note that it > > was agreed that the item was antique and showed signs of having been > > buried for many centuries) in London in May 1976, before the other > > was unearthed, and therefore they could not be the same. > > Metallurgical evidence was also produced to show dissimilarities > > between the ‘London Nataraja’ and the Pathur Bronzes. > > > > The English trial judge, Mr Ian Kennedy, found that the ‘London > > Nataraja’ was the same as the one uncovered in India in 1976. He > > believed Dr. Presencer to have been mistaken to the date on which > > he’d seen the antique Nataraja. > > > > *Title* > > > > The Judge concluded that the institution comprising the Temple (the > > 4th claimant) had title to the Nataraja. If it had not been the 4th > > than the 5th, then the 3rd had good claims for title and the 2nd > > would have also had title under provisions of the Treasure Trove Act > > and/or Tamil Nadu law (H.R. and C.E. Act). > > > > The precedent for this was in a case from India in 1925 – Mallick v > > Mallick. The legal principle says “A Hindu idol is according to the > > long established authority founded upon the religious customs of the > > Hindus and the recognition thereof by the courts of law in India and > > the Privy Council, a juristic entity. It has judicial status with > > the power of suing and being sued.” This had been an English > > decision – that a Hindu deity is a personality of its own and can > > sue or be sued in a court of law. They applied the principle that > > once a deity always a deity and so the principle continued to be > > relevant in the 1980s. > > > > The Judge concluded “the pious intention of the 12th century > > notable.. who built the temple…remains in being and is personified > > by the Temple itself, a juristic entity which had title to the > > Nataraja superior to that of the defendant.” > > > >
