\> Getty Bronze Must Be Returned to Italy, Judge Rules  
\>

\> J.  
\> Paul Getty Trust “Victorious Youth,” a statue that was retrieved from the  
\> Adriatic by Italian fishermen in 1964.  
\>  
\> An Italian judge ruled on Thursday that the J. Paul Getty  

\> Museum\<<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/g..>.>  

\> in  
\> Los Angeles must hand over a rare bronze statue, “Victorious  

\> Youth,\<<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/16/arts/design/16bronze.html>\>”  

\> that has been at the heart of a four-decade-long dispute.  
\>  
\> Judge Lorena Mussoni decreed that the statue — found by Italian fishermen in  
\> the Adriatic in 1964 and bought by the Getty in 1977 for just under $4  
\> million — must be “confiscated from the museum” and transferred immediately  
\> to the Italian government, which the ruling identified as its rightful  
\> owner.  
\>  
\> Maurizio Fiorilli, a lawyer for the government, praised the decision, which  
\> he said was a confirmation that the Getty “had not acted in good faith when  
\> they bought the statue.” The Italian justice ministry must now make a formal  
\> request to American authorities to execute the court order.  
\>  
\> The second- or third-century B.C. sculpture of an athlete, best known as the  
\> Getty Bronze, was excluded from a 2007 agreement between Italy and the Getty  
\> for the return of 40 artifacts that Italy said had been looted, pending the  
\> court decision. The Italian culture ministry said on Thursday that it hoped  
\> the Getty would now review that accord and that it would return the statue  
\> “in light of this ruling.”  
\>  
\> In a statement the Getty expressed its disappointment in the ruling, and  
\> said the court order was “flawed both procedurally and substantively.” The  
\> museum said it would appeal the order to the Court of Cassation in Rome and  
\> “vigorously defend its legal ownership of the statue.”

\> The Bhojshala Temple in Dhar - built in the 11th century - and now used as a  
\> mosque and temple.  
\>  

\> The BHOJ SHALA or temple of Sarasvati was built by King Bhoja the Great who  
\> ruled between 1000 and 1055. Famed for his learning and love of Sanskrit,  
\> Bhoja was dedicated to Sarasvati, the goddess of knowledge. The city of Dhar  
\> was sacked by the Chalukyas and Solankis in the 12th century and the statue  
\> of Sarasvati was taken away to Gujarat where a temple was built for the  
\> goddess in 1271. The library of Dhar was also looted and manuscripts  
\> preserved in the Bhandars of western India.

\> Hindu and Jain remains in the 14th or 15th centuries: its name is derived

\> Fragments of an iron pillar can be seen in front of the Dhar temple. It  
\> should have been a dhwajastambham like the Delhi iron pillar which was set  
\> up in Sanchi (and now moved to Delhi).  
\>  
\> The pillar should have shown Garuda-Vishnu on top like the Heliodorus  

\> Garuda-Vishnu pillar\<<http://huntington.wmc.ohio-state.edu/public/index.cfm?fuseaction=show..>.>,  

\> Vidisha (Besnagar, Sanchi) (c. 120-100 BCE).  
\>  

\> A Sanskrit and Prakrit inscription from the time of Arjunavarman was found  
\> in the walls of the building in 1903 by K. K. Lele, Superintendent of  
\> Education in the Princely State of Dhār. King Arjunavarman (circa 1210-15),  
\> successor of Bhoja Raja claimed that he was a reincarnation of Bhoja  
\> himself. The inscription, which is engraved with exceptional beauty, is  
\> displayed inside the entrance. The text includes part of a drama called  
\> Vijayaśrīnāṭikā composed by Madana, the king's preceptor who also bore the  
\> title 'Bālasarasvatī'. \[S. K. Dikshit, ed., Pārijātamañjarī alias Vijayaśrī  
\> by Rāja-Guru Madana alias Bāla-Sarasvatī (Bhopal, 1968)\]. The other  
\> inscribed tablets recovered by Lele, among them a serpentine inscription  
\> giving grammatical rules of the Sanskrit language. The finds, particularly  
\> of the grammatical inscription, prompted Lele to describe the building as  
\> the Bhoj Shala or 'Hall of Bhoja', because King Bhoja (circa 1000-55) was  
\> the author of a number of works on poetics and grammar, among them the  
\> Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa or 'Necklace of Sarasvatī'. \[R. Birwé,

\> Journal of the American Oriental Society 84 (1964): 150-62.\]  The term  
\> Bhojaśālā was taken up by C. E. Luard and published in his Gazetteer of 1908  
\> although Luard noted that it was a misnomer. \[C. E. Luard, Western States

\>  
\> \*Introduction\*  

\>  
\> In August or September 1976 an Indian labourer who lived near the site of a  
\> ruined Hindu temple at Pathur (Arul Thiru Viswanatha Swamy Temple), in the  
\> state of Tamil Nadu, uncovered a metal object (the ‘Pathur Nataraja’) while  
\> excavating foundations for a new cow shed. This object was known locally as  
\> a Siva Nataraja and was shown to belong to a family of bronze Hindu idols  
\> called the Pathur Bronzes. It was subsequently dated to the Chola period  
\> (9th to 13th Century) and was probably buried to prevent discovery by  
\> invading Muslims. The farmer sold the idol to a dealer in religious  
\> artefacts and eventually it ended up with a Bombay dealer (who was  
\> untraceable at the time of court proceedings).  
\>  
\> State officials in Tamil Nadu had learnt of the various sales associated  
\> with the idol and had begun their own investigations but by 1982 the  
\> whereabouts of the object was still unknown. In June of that year Robert  
\> Borden, of the Bumper Corporation of Canada, bought a Nataraja in good faith  
\> from a London dealer called Sherrier (who later produced what was found to  
\> be false provenance documents for the object). Bumper obtained a permit to  
\> export the bronze from England but did not do so as they were advised it  
\> required conservation. The ‘London Nataraja’ was taken to the British Museum  
\> for assessment and conservation but later seized by the Metropolitan Police  
\> as part of an operation to return stolen religious objects to their rightful  
\> owners. Bumper then brought a claim against the Police for the return of the  
\> object and damages.  
\>  

\> \*The Trial\*  

\>  
\> There were five claimants in the case: 1. Union of India 2. State of Tamil  
\> Nadu 3. Thiru R. Sadagopan, claiming as the fit representative of the Temple  
\> 4. Arul Thiru Viswanatha Swamy Temple 5. Sivalingam. This was another  
\> surviving object of religious worship from the Temple. It is a sculptured  
\> stone phallus and in a temple of its period would have been positioned in  
\> the sanctum to be the focus of worship. It was restored as an object of  
\> worship at the Temple after its rediscovery  
\>  
\> There were two main issues: 1. Identity – that the ‘London Nataraja’ was the  
\> one and the same as the ‘Pathur Nataraja’ 2. Title – If they were the same,  
\> who of the claimants had the superior title to the object  
\>  

\> \*Identity\*  

\>  
\> The case stating that they were the same object was supported by expert  
\> evidence on stylistic grounds of similarity between the ‘London Nataraja’  
\> and the Pathur Bronzes and expert evidence of a metallurgical, geological  
\> and entomological nature.  
\>  
\> Bumper’s case was supported by Dr. Presencer (considered an honest witness)  
\> who stated that he’d seen the antique object (note that it was agreed that  
\> the item was antique and showed signs of having been buried for many  
\> centuries) in London in May 1976, before the other was unearthed, and  
\> therefore they could not be the same. Metallurgical evidence was also  
\> produced to show dissimilarities between the ‘London Nataraja’ and the  
\> Pathur Bronzes.  
\>  
\> The English trial judge, Mr Ian Kennedy, found that the ‘London Nataraja’  
\> was the same as the one uncovered in India in 1976. He believed Dr.  
\> Presencer to have been mistaken to the date on which he’d seen the antique  
\> Nataraja.  
\>  

\> \*Title\*  

\>  
\> The Judge concluded that the institution comprising the Temple (the 4th  
\> claimant) had title to the Nataraja. If it had not been the 4th than the  
\> 5th, then the 3rd had good claims for title and the 2nd would have also had  
\> title under provisions of the Treasure Trove Act and/or Tamil Nadu law (H.R.  
\> and C.E. Act).  
\>  
\> The precedent for this was in a case from India in 1925 – Mallick v Mallick.  
\> The legal principle says “A Hindu idol is according to the long established  
\> authority founded upon the religious customs of the Hindus and the  
\> recognition thereof by the courts of law in India and the Privy Council, a  
\> juristic entity. It has judicial status with the power of suing and being  
\> sued.” This had been an English decision – that a Hindu deity is a  
\> personality of its own and can sue or be sued in a court of law. They  
\> applied the principle that once a deity always a deity and so the principle  
\> continued to be relevant in the 1980s.  
\>  
\> The Judge concluded “the pious intention of the 12th century notable.. who  
\> built the temple…remains in being and is personified by the Temple itself, a  
\> juristic entity which had title to the Nataraja superior to that of the  
\> defendant.”

\>  

\> \*The Appeal\*  

\>  
\> Bumper appealed against both findings and wanted the Court of Appeal to  
\> consider if Mr Justice Kennedy was entitled to make the assessments that he  
\> made. The Court of Appeal stated that the Judge “was fully entitled to come  
\> to the conclusion which he reached on each aspect of… the case.”  
\>  

\> \*Identity\*  

\>  
\> Further evidence was admitted by Bumper which had not been previously  
\> available. An American dealer, Robert Ellsworth, testified that an antique  
\> Nataraja was being offered for sale in London in Easter of 1974. He had  
\> examined it briefly and he identified it as the disputed object bought by  
\> Bumper. They also included evidence of soil analysis showing that the size  
\> and colour of soil particles on the object differed from samples taken at  
\> the excavation pit at the Temple. The Court upheld Kennedy’s findings on the  
\> issue of identification.  
\>  

\> \*Title\*  



\> \*Post Appeal\*  

\>  
\> The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords awarded the Temple damages of  
\> £1000 and awarded the plaintiffs, jointly, costs totalling £303,489.67. The  
\> Nataraja was entrusted to the Indian High Commission in London and later  
\> returned to India.  
\>  
\> Bumper then appealed to the Canadian courts. Bumper resisted enforcement  
\> saying that the judgement was contrary to the public policy of Canada, as  
\> reflected by its accession to the UNESCO Convention. Bumper counterclaimed  
\> for compensation from India for the loss of the bronze and for the English  
\> costs.  
\>  
\> Bumper had five defences to the registration of the English judgements in  
\> Alberta: 1. that the judgements of the English courts were obtained by fraud  
\> on the English courts 2. that India could not, as a co-signatory of the  
\> UNESCO Convention, pursue its claim for costs and damages 3. that the  
\> English judgements were contrary to public policy 4. that one of the named  
\> Indian plaintiffs (the Temple) had no status in Alberta 5. that the Indians  
\> are not entitled to interest on the English judgement debts  
\>  

\> \*Fraud\*  

\>  
\> The Alberta court felt there was no newly discovered facts which were not  
\> before the foreign court and from which it could be deduced that the foreign  
\> judgement has been obtained by fraud  
\>  

\> \*Equity\*  

\>  
\> The Alberta court rejected Bumper’s claims  
\>  

\> \*Public Policy\*  

\>  
\> This point is of interest to cultural property lawyers due to Canada’s  
\> status as a signatory to the UNESCO Convention. Although the UK was not a  
\> signatory the courts were able to justify the return of the object under  
\> common law principles – although at the cost of the innocent purchaser being  
\> left without the right to claim for compensation (it could have if the UK  
\> had been a signatory and had implemented the Convention).  
\>  
\> Bumper argued that by bringing proceedings in England the Indian claimants  
\> should not be able to enforce their award in Alberta. The Court rejected  
\> this on the basis that there was good reason for the claimant to go to the  
\> English courts – not least the location of the item. The provisions of the  
\> UNESCO Convention don’t allow for a situation where property is returned by  
\> one state when its innocent purchaser resides in another.  
\>  

\> \*Standing\*  

\>  
\> Bumper argued that the Temple had no legal status in Alberta. The Court  
\> stated it was likely they would have dealt with the issue in the same way as  
\> the English courts did.  
\>  

\> \*Interest\*

\> \*Conclusion\*  

\>  
\> The UK Courts decisions caused apprehension in the antiquities market  
\> because if a religious artefact found in the UK could be traced to a ‘living  
\> temple’ then that Temple could pursue a claim to ownership.  
\>  
\> The novel question was whether a foreign legal person who would not be  
\> recognised as a legal person by our own law could sue in the English courts.  
\> This was a first in the UK – where a Hindu Temple could sue for stolen  
\> property in England.  
\>  
\> Also of interest is that the Sivalingam (a phallic stone idol) was ruled as  
\> having greater title than the Bumper Corporation.  
\>  
\> The results show that the English courts will do what they can to ensure the  
\> return of cultural property to its rightful owner. The arguments themselves,  
\> the principle of comity and the criterion of public policy will ensure a  
\> wider application of the decision. It was therefore a welcome development in  
\> the arena of the international protection of cultural property.
