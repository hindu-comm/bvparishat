There are many "mantra"s claiming jvaranivaaraNam, there too Vaishnavajvara and Shaivajavara varieties are there available in PurANa-s waiting to be rid of by the relative "mantra"s like "kavaca"s. There may be many "viniyoga"-s for certain Vedic Mantra-s too prescribed for "Javara" nivAraNa. Anyhow, it is left to the researchers' choice to take a survey of mantra-s with claim (phala-stuti) or viniyoga (utility) prescribed for in special cases.

  

  

"Jvara" commonly indicates any change in the physical system of working from the normal one. It can be indicative of attacks any germs of diseases. Otherwise, a fasting would easily solve it in normal cases as somewhere I had "लङ्घनं परमौषधम्" which gives rest to digestive organs lessening their load and continuous work which can be expected to be refreshed after a short rest for them. Unless the cause of the "jvara"(change in temperature) is known, any "mantra" may help or not. I am not of any opinion on it.
