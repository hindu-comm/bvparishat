Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Gotra of Kauravas and Pandavas!

It is said that Gotra of Kauravas and Pandavas was VaiyAgrapadya (VyAgrapAda?). In that case it was the gotra of Dritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura. In turn it was gotra of Krishna DvaipAyana (also called VyAsa or VedavyAsa). Now VyAsa was son of ParAshara. The father of ParAshara was Shakti, the son of VashisTh. In other words this is different Vanshavali from DevApi, Shantanu and VAhlika whose father was PratIpa. If PratIpa was in the line of SanvaraNa Kuru, then Kurus did not have gotra Vaiyagrapadya. I did not find the name VaiyAghrapadya in Puranic Kosha of Vettam Mani (from Kerala). I found VyAghrapAda sage. But there is not much information on him in Puranic Kosha except that he had desciples Upamanyu, Veda and one more. Any thoughts on this? The reason of asking this question is-Kurukula had some connection with VRkakula. That makes me nervous. VRika means Wolf. And ancestor of Kurus was Budha (son of Chandra, son of Atri) also called VRika. In the known history Turkish people connect their birth to Wolf. And Turkish are another branch of Middle-east Aryans. I am placing this in front of scholars. Any explanation may help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
