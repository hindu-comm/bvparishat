Dear Dr. D. Bhattacharya, Thanks for posting your observations on change of opinions of authors. It also happens in hard sciences. Usually after a period of 30 years, sometimes data becomes upsidedown. Then what to do? Dr. B.B.Lal admitted in his papers that he was supporter of Aryan invasion in early part of his career. He is honest and reputed archaeologist.. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
