Dear Friends,  
  
  
The only sanskrit daily newspaper in the world was launched on 15th July,  
1970, by Pandit Vardaraja Iyengar. The newspaper was started by the  
founder to unfold and open up that Sanskrit is not a language defined  
to one sector of  
religion or one sect of community. The whole purpose is to eradicate the  
myth that this language is not restricted to one sect or one country  
or one religion- Pandit spent all his life savings to make this  
newspaper available to a common man to access the mother of the all  
languages at a very economical price .  
  
The paper name is Sudharma which is also available  
online which is read by 86 countries people (Online) . By reading the  
newspaper on daily basis one can easily learn the language (With  
knowledge of hindi) , the contents are very simple and reader friendly  
.  
  
The Mother of all languages paper needs our help to sustain . The  
paper is run by Late Vardaraja Iyengar's son and his wife in a small  
place at Mysore with couple of emplyoees. The paper does not get any  
grant, or any advertsisments or subsidy inspite of that Mr. Sampat  
Iyengar ensures to release the paper on daily basis by morning 7 AM  
and mails to all the subscribers. There are no artcile contributors  
for papers except couple of them. I visited them , met them and spoke  
to them. They have so much passion for the language and drive to keep  
this paper going inspite of absolute constraints of funds. They dont  
get even newsprint subsidy . The annual subscription is Rs.300/-  
which includes mailing cost. Sudharma needs our support and help -  
  
Please help by subscribing to the paper , send donations, sponsor to anyone  
who can read sanskirt, sponsor paper, ink  
  
anything you can do- Please send this email to your friends (NRI's and to  
anybody you know) . Please encourage your  
  
children or known children who are studying sanskrt in school. Please  
subscribe for your known temples and bhajan mutts  
  
etc.
