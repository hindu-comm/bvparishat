Dear scholars

A senior Member of Parliament called me and asked me for a Subhashita, the Leader of the Opposition wants to quote it in the Parliamentary debate.

Subhashita is needed for the following meaning - "It is pardonable if an ordinary person commits even a big mistake. But if a great man commits even a small mistake it is unpardonable, what if big mistakes!"  
Please inform if there is any, so that it would resound in Parliament.
