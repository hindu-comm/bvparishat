Ed.note: Yesterday we cross-posted (from H-HistGeog) the review of Robert Cribb's Atlas of Indonesian History by Stein Tonnesson. The publisher, Gerald Jackson of the Nordic Institute of Asian Studies has provided a response clarifying some issues raised in the review. I  
second Gerald's request that H-ASIA members respect the conditions stated at the site in protection of Bob Cribb's rights.

With referece to the Tonnesson review of Robert Cribb's Atlas of Indonesian History:  
  
It is always pleasing to get such a positive review. Unfortunately, many of the people taking a look at the Digital Atlas after reading the review will not enjoy the same rich experience that Stein TÃ¸nnesson had; they have no access to the DVD and the maps in the online edition are watermarked and disabled (no downloads, for instance) until after login.  
  
However, from now until the end of September, we have set up fully functional access to the Digital Atlas for a single user (but several people can be logged on with this ID at the same time). To make use of this access:  
  
- Go to the Digital Atlas website (<http://www.indonesianhistory.info/>).  
- Click 'Login' on the menu bar (a user account window will appear).  
- Enter 'H-ASIA' in the username field (note this is case sensitive).  
- Enter 'justlooking' (also case sensitive) in the password field, then click submit.  
  
From the account page that appears you can go anywhere within the atlas site and do anything a normal registered user may do. Most people will go straight to the maps but later when you have time (and actually no login is needed here) you might find it interesting to view a series of video clips in which Robert Cribb talks about mapmaking and argues for the illumination of scholarly text with a well-drawn map. These are found in the Extras section (at<http://www.indonesianhistory.info/pages/map-making.html>).  
  
Finally, all users of the atlas are bound by its conditions of use (stated here:  
<http://www.indonesianhistory.info/pages/conditions-use.html>). Please
respect the author's huge intellectual investment in this atlas by adhering to these conditions.  
  
We hope that your enjoy your visit and come back for more.
