As Narayanan has noticed, the word is a case of polysemantic word following its etymological derivation according to the context.

  

  

स्वं रूपं शब्दस्याशब्दसंज्ञा

In this grammar, a rule applying to a word applies to that word itself \[and not to words with similar meanings\], unless the word is a definition (provided by the Ashtadhyayi Sutra-s).-

  

The words coined by him are called here as संज्ञा, technically defined by him to denote the contents as defined in the first chapter itself before he embarks actual description of the language using them for economy of words. Though this is general rule, the words referring to nouns in common language, used in Ashtadhyayi are confined to referring to their forms, than their contents or synonyms, there are certain generic terms used as such, वृक्ष, पक्षि, etc. as exceptional cases, used to be covered within the purview of the relevant rules. Generally, संज्ञा are used to denote the technical term well defined in his system of grammar. Like गुण and वृद्धि, do not necessarily denote quality or attribute, and prosperity. There is a funny verse using these two words with pun to mean both:

  

दीधीवेवीङ्समः कश्चिद् गुणवृद्ध्योरभाजनम्।

क्विप्-प्रत्ययनिभः कश्चिद् यस्य संनिहिते न ते॥

  

Some people are there who never acquire neither virtues or prosperity, like the two verbs देधी and वेवी. (which specifically do not take the गुण and वृद्धि as per(१,१.६) in any case.). Some others are there, those who get in association with him also do not have these (neither prosperity and virtue is never come to themselves, and also whoever come into their contact also will lose these two). \[क्विप् is a zero morpheme suffix, which never gets any inflection, and also it prohibits गुण and वृद्धि in the word to which it is affixed).

  
Just shared this interesting verse with the two संज्ञा-s.
