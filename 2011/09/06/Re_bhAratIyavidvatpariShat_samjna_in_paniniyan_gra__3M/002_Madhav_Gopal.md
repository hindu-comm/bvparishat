Jaya Hinda to all!  
  
I think the samjnyA term has been used in ASTAdhyAyi not to refer "nouns" but to refer certain class of words/ 'sound segments' with respect to their morphological properties. This term is completely artificial and has been designed to bring brevity in Panini's grammar. For example he uses the term 'nadi' to refer a particular class of words but these words are not synonymous with river. So, let us not confused with the technical terms of Panini with the words of normal language. These terms are particularized to the domain of ASTAdhyAyi. They are not to be used in our real life.  
  
Hope you will find it useful.  
  
With regards,  
Madhav
