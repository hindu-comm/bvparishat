Respected scholars, Namaskar!



In the three sUtras of PANini listed below, do the words KaNTha, UshInares'u and VarNa indicate the names of the ancient counties? Does KaNTha appear as a part of names of counties like "ShrikaNTadesha" ? or do they indicate something other than names of countries?



 'संज्न्यायाम् कंठोशीनरेषु

’, ’कंठायाः ठक्’, ’वर्णौवुक्’



Please kindly illuminate us so right understanding can be reached. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
