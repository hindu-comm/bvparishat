Thanks Dr. Shrisha Rao for expressing your views----"you may wish to contact Bannanje Govindacharya of Udupi (perhaps other BVP members may know how to reach him). He has done some research in this regard, and I believe it is his view (though I do not know the literary or other basis for it), for instance, that  
Parikshit and Janamejaya had quite large empires, with actual rule or vassal  
relationships extending into present-day China, Russia, etc----------"



If somebody gives me e-mail of Bannaje Govindacharya of Udupi, I may contact him. As a matter of fact I was writing from the past two years on BVParishat that some of the provinces of Mahabharata were actually outside of the subcontinent-I mentioned names Kambojas, Shakas, Vaikartana Kurus, Tokharistan, Ladies Kingdom and many more. I think Kurus, Vaahlikas,Shakas and Vrikas (Turk-Wolf people) were intimately connected. And this matter must be given attention in connection with both AIT (proposed by western scholars and OIT (proposed by some Indian scholars) theories.Thanks. N.R.Joshi

\> Dear Dr,Shrisha Rao,

\> Thanks for your interpretation of lines of Rajatarangini. However I have problem in accepting "Kauravas were wiped out in the war itself". Both Kauravas (sons of Dritarashtra) and Pandavas (son of Pandu) belonged to the Kuru dynasty  
  
This is quite well known, of course. It is indeed the basis for the maxim सन्तानबीजं कुरुपाण्डवानाम् which is also called the कुरुपाण्डवन्याय, as a special case of the linguistic principle असाधारण्येन व्यपदेशा भवन्ति (which is also followed in other languages, though not so crisply stated to my knowledge). The Pandavas were called so on account of their special characteristics, whilst their not-so-special cousins were not differentiated and were thus simply known by the name of their lineage. An analogue of the कुरुपाण्डवन्याय is the विप्रवसिष्ठन्याय, where one may say "Vasishtha came accompanied by विप्रs" though Vasistha is also of course himself a विप्र -- the differentiation is not to deny Vasistha his विप्रत्व, but rather to indicate his specialty vis-à-vis ordinary विप्रs.  
  
\> (neglecting the fact that they were descendants of Kris'Na DvaipAyana (VyAsa) and not of Kuru Shantanu, (See my posting on Gotra Vaiyaghrapadya of Kauravas and Pandavas). BhIs'ma was Kuru being son of Shantanu. VAhlikas were kurus. People from Uttara Kurus were related to Kurus.
