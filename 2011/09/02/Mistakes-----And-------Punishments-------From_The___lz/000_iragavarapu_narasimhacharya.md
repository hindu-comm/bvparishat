Dear Scholar Friends,

PraNamyA. A servant of the king of YakShas was exiled for his simple mistake under the plea of dereliction of duties.The servant's duty isdaily to bring the flowers at sun-rise and place them at the place of worship of his master "Kubera".Once the servant unable to control hiserotic desire towards his wife plucked the flowers at the sun-set on the previous evening and placed them at the place of worship.When hismaster began his worship,as it was sun-rise,a honey-bee shut up in the lotus,the previous day in the evening suddenly came out of the lotus and stung the master as a result of which the servant was cursed and exiled with separation from his wife for one year.

Here,we observe the mistake is quite simple,but,it is given a severe punishment.

Let us see another example.Once the king "Dileepa" was coming down from the heaven.On his way the Divine Cow was taking rest under

the shadow of a tree called "KalpavRukSha".The king "Dileepa" unaware of the "Divine Cow's sight, in his hurry came down to the earth.

The elders always deserve their due respect.The 'Divine Cow" is one of the elders.Here on the part of the king,we observe,the dereliction ofduties.For the disrespect towards the 'Divine Cow" the king was punished severely by the said cow with lack of progeny.How-ever great the king was he had to undergo the severe punishment.

Like these we find so-many examples in the sanskrit literature.That's why we believe the Sanskrit is "An Education for life"

  

Regards,

ivnacharya.
