Respected Professor Iyengar,

Thank you very much for informing about The Caturangastaka of Melputtur Narayana Bhattathiri in Professor C. Rajendran website. Though I have visited this website a few number of times, due to oversight I didn't give attention to such a work by Melputtur, and Rajendran Sir's papers like : Exploring the possibilities of finding out the nature of Chess in its Original Form, Caturanga Movements in Rudrata's Kavyalankara, Traditional Caturanga as preserved in Kerala, Melpathur Narayana Bhattatiri, and The Collection of gaming Pieces and Dice, Chessmen and Sets with Board in the Raja Kelkar Museum in Pune, Maharashtra \[With Dr. A .Bock-Raming\]. Thanking you again.  



Regards,  
Narayanan
