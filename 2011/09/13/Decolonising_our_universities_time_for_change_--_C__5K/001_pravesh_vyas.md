\> university. A few weeks later, Ben Wildavsky posted a response (‘Academic  
\> Colonialism, False Consciousness, and the Western University  

\> Ideal\<<http://chronicle.com/blogs/worldwise/academic-colonialism-false-consc..>.>‘).  

\> In our minds both contributions include valid points, but they both contain  
\> a significant number of generalizations: lines are drawn, and nuance and  
\> shades of grey are missing — a point one of us (Kris Olds) also made in a  
\> mid-August dialogue via Twitter with Ben Wildavsky, though Ben obviously  
\> disagreed!  
\>  
\> In any case, the debate continues below, for one of the conference  

\> organizers (Professor C. K. Raju \<<http://ckraju.net/blog/>\>, School of  
\> Mathematical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia\*)\*has now submitted a  

\> response to Ben Wildavsky’s critical take on the conference statement, and  
\> the ideas associated with it. We’ve posted Professor Raju’s text below,  
\> unedited, for it is clear that the issues are of some concern to many  
\> parties, and we don’t agree with Wildavsky that it is “condescending, not  
\> respectful, to murmur sympathetically in response to  

\> nonsense\<<http://twitter.com/#%21/Wildavsky>\>.”  

\> In our mind it is better to air thoughts, and interrogate them. For example,  
\> we have some concerns with C.K. Raju’s use of broad categorizations like  
\> “Western” and “non-Western,” and how they are associated with supposedly  
\> unified perspectives and institutional spaces. However, we do think the  
\> views of C.K Raju deserve an airing, and we are aware that they link into a  
\> variety of other currents of thought and initiatives — some connected, some  
\> not — around the university as a ‘political project’ aimed at promoting  
\> particular kinds of knowledge and identities. For instance, last week one  
\> of us (Susan) attended a conference  

\> \<<http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/bbs/conferences/cosinus>\>in  

\> Bristol on the new role of the university and its role in innovation. A  
\> fascinating paper was presented by Surja  

\> Datta\<<http://www.business.brookes.ac.uk/bs/profile.asp?id=p0075472>\> on  

\> the history of India’s first university and the key role it played in  
\> providing lower-level civil servants who would rule in the interests of the  
\> British empire. His argument was that this particular form of the university  
\> in India has been detrimental to India’s system of innovation. The  

\> establishment of an indigenous Maori university in New Zealand–Te Whare\*  
\> Wānanga\* o Awanuiārangi \<<http://www.wananga.ac.nz/Pages/default.aspx>\>–with a  

\> focus on local knowledge and pedagogical approaches, is a further example  
\> of an initiative that aims at confronting the political/colonial nature of  
\> the university and its system of knowledge. Finally, one of us (Kris) was  
\> in Washington DC last week at a NAFSA meeting, and an interesting discussion  
\> emerged about a new International Association of Universities (IAU)  
\> initiative designed to “re-examine the concept of  

\> internationalization\<<http://www.iau-aiu.net/content/re-thinking-internationalization-iau-c..>.>.”  

\> As the IAU puts it:  
\>  
\> Is the concept and the definition of internationalization keeping up with  
\> developments in higher education? Is there a shared understanding of the  
\> concept? Has internationalization lost sight of its central purposes?  
\>  
\> IAU is posing these and other questions in a reflection directly in line  
\> with the findings of the 3rd Global Survey on Internationalization. The  
\> Survey clearly points out the differences in why internationalization is  
\> pursued in different parts of the world and how it impacts on various  
\> institutions in vastly diverse contexts. Furthermore, this initiative is a  
\> natural sequel to past normative efforts of the Association, such as the Policy  

\> Statement \<<http://www.iau-aiu.net/sites/all/files/sharing_quality_he_en.pdf>\>  
\>
andDeclaration\<<http://www.iau-aiu.net/sites/all/files/Internationalization_Policy_St..>.>  
\> and Checklist for Good  
\> Practice\<<http://www.iau-aiu.net/sites/all/files/cross_border_checklist.pdf>\>.  

\> The Ad hoc international Expert Group was created to bring together  

\> perspectives from all parts of the world \*inter alia\* to: assess the extent  

\> to which internationalization activities fit the current conceptual  
\> umbrella, to critically examine the causes that are leading to some  
\> questioning and even criticism of the concept and to investigate the ways to  

\> address these concerns.\* \*  

\>  
\> We’d like to thank both C.K. Raju and Ben Wildavsky for engaging in this  
\> debate. We also look forward to insights that might be generated by the

\<<http://globalhighered.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/bannerdecolonising.jpg>\>In  

\> his comments1 on the Penang conference on “Decolonising our  
\> universities”.2Wildavsky  

\> suggests\<<http://chronicle.com/blogs/worldwise/academic-colonialism-false-consc..>.>that  



\> thus establish colonialism.7 The \*content\* of the imported non-Western  

\> knowledge was made theologically correct through reinterpretation (and by  
\> modifying the Christian doctrine to Christian rational theology, a  
\> modification8 of Islamic rational theology).  
\>  

\> \<<http://globalhighered.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/decolonizing.jpg>\>This  

\> paternal link between the church and the Western university persisted for  
\> centuries, with the church being the key consumer of the students produced  
\> by the university. The industrial revolution weakened the link, but did not  
\> sever it. In the middle of the 20th c., Harvard, Princeton, and Yale refused  
\> to keep Isaac Newton’s long-suppressed papers9 in their library, since he  
\> had detailed how the church had distorted the Bible. Even as late as 2003,  
\> after the secret was out, the Cambridge Newton scholar, Whiteside, tried to  
\> hang on to that falsehood by abusing me10 for pointing to that “cartload” of  
\> Newton’s suppressed papers. Scholars from Harvard are still defending those  
\> fairy tales about Greek achievements and the Copernican and Newtonian  
\> revolution.  
\>  
\> In short, for much of its 900 years of existence, the Western university  
\> served a propagandist function, like the students it produced, and that  
\> tendency still persists. The aim, like that of the church, was to train  

\> students to persuade\*others\*, by any means, including false history. In  

\> contrast, in each of the above mentioned non-Western higher-learning models,  

\> students tried to convince\*themselves\*, for they were seeking truth, or  

\> wisdom, or the right way to live, so unethical tricks had no place at all.  
\>  
\> This difference between the two models is also reflected in the processes of  
\> validating knowledge. In the West it is a hush-hush process: the “merit” of  
\> a Western academic is judged by papers published in journals where referees  
\> will review it in secret. Though this secretive process is touted as  
\> allowing referees greater freedom to criticise someone in authority, the  

\> process is widely used and perhaps intended to suppress those \*not\* in  

\> authority. It strongly resembles the system of censorship designed by the  
\> church to preserve its authority. Those critics who escaped the censor where  
\> suppressed by branding them “heretics”, just as critics, especially  
\> non-Westerners, are easily labelled as “cranks” today, for challenging  
\> Western authority, no arguments needed. That is especially so in hard  
\> sciences, where the majority of the Western educated are illiterate, and  
\> must rely on the guidance of authority to decide truth. (And scientists are  
\> forced to specialise, hence still depend upon authority to decide truth.)  
\> This “criterion of reputability” (as distinct from “refutability”) helped  
\> the church to sustain egregiously bad beliefs, like the date of creation set  
\> at 9 a.m. On 23 October 4004 BC by the Vice Chancellor of Cambridge. This  
\> procedure is of little value, if the aim is truth. The authority to decide  
\> “reputability” is today exercised by editors who secretively appoint  
\> referees. So, our faith in that system of validating knowledge rests largely  
\> on our faith in the honesty of editors and referees of scholarly journals.  
\>  
\> Some editors and referees surely are honest, but all certainly are not.  
\> Objective claims about this system of validation are impossible (either  
\> way), since it is secretive, and has never been studied. “Horror stories”  
\> abound. For example, when credit for my work,11 called a paradigm shift in  
\> physics, was given to a former President of the Royal Society, by naming it  

\> after him,12 in consultation with him,13 and well \*after \*he was personally  

\> informed14 of my work, the editor of the American Mathematical Society just  
\> published some post-facto references to my work,15 and refused to permit me  

\> to bring out the fact that this was the\*second\* attempt. He stuck to the  

\> decision, despite a petition by many academics that I should have a right to  
\> reply. If this is what happens in full public view, one shudders at the  
\> thought of what happens under cover of secrecy.  
\>  
\> In contrast, the transparent process of validating knowledge in India was  

\> one of \*public\* debate. So seriously were these debates taken, that a pundit  

\> (Mandana Misra) who had decided to die, and had buried himself up to his  

\> neck, waited before dying, \*in that condition\*,\* \*to complete the debate to  

\> which he was challenged. There were certain rules for settling debates.  

\> Ignorance or misrepresentation of the opponent’s position (\*purva paksha\*)  

\> meant the debate was lost. Wildavsky should note.  
\>  
\> A refusal to ape the West is commonly misrepresented as an uncritical  
\> rejection! However, the consensus at the decolonisation conference was that,  
\> though Western universities have widely rejected non-Western knowledge as  
\> lacking contemporary significance,16 our rejection of the West would be a  
\> critical one.  
\>  
\> So what would this critical rejection consist of? My own paper concerned  
\> hard sciences which helped to establish colonisation, and which remain the  

\> carrot today for Western education.17 As I explicitly stated, the aim was \*  
\> not \*to complain, as Wildavsky wrongly maintains, but to outline an  

\> alternative curriculum in (a) math, (b) science, and (c) the history and  
\> philosophy of science. The influence of the church on Western universities  
\> has led to the intrusion of Christian theology even into mathematics and  
\> science, which must be eliminated together with false history.  
\>  

\> \<<http://globalhighered.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/ckrajucover.jpg>\>The part  

\> about history (of science) is easiest to understand. The West has surely  
\> contributed to knowledge, but that contribution has been vastly exaggerated  
\> by a false history which must be rejected. Standard Western texts still  
\> attribute most pre-Crusade science to the Greeks, and then jump to  
\> post-renaissance Western sources.18This false history “softened” influential  
\> but gullible sections of the colonised, who believed it without checking.19 It  
\> enabled Macaulay to amplify that “soft power” by instituting colonial  
\> education—a key means of indoctrination which helped to create an elite  
\> class of colonised, loyal to the coloniser, who sustained colonialism.  
\> Accordingly, for decolonisation, this false history must first be discarded,  
\> from “Euclid” and “Claudius Ptolemy”, to Copernicus and the claim that  
\> Newton invented the calculus.20 Regrettably, many Western journals (and even  
\> discussion lists) still suppress discussion of this in their forums.  
\> Obviously, decolonisation cannot be done by first asking the West for  
\> permission the way Wildavsky misrepresents the conference petition to  
\> Unesco! Why should one validate this changed history according to Western  
\> norms of subjecting oneself to their secretive editorial control? Let it be  

\> validated on the non-Western norm of \*open\* debate. Let the earlier Western  

\> claims be so validated. It is to encourage this that I have offered a prize  
\> of RM 10,000 (around USD 3300) for reliable primary evidence about the  
\> existence of “Euclid”.21  
\>  
\> The connection of math to theology is a bit harder to understand. Western  
\> mathematics started off with Egyptian mystery geometry, which understood  
\> mathematics as mathesis or a means to arouse the soul and make it remember  

\> its past lives (as in the story of Socrates and the slave boy, in Plato’s \*  
\> Meno\*.). That notion of soul was cursed by the post-Nicene church22 while  



\> Cambridge journal \*solicited\* my book for review, and the reviewer simply  

\> denied the existence of this philosophy!32 He falsely stated that I was not  
\> trained in math, along with other assorted lies! (Seems to be pattern here!)  
\> There is also a cover-up operation going on on the fundamental issue I  
\> raised a decade ago:33 that logic is neither culturally universal, nor  
\> empirically certain, a point which undermines most Western philosophy, not  
\> just mathematics.34  
\>  
\> The other curriculum change I suggested was in physics. Since physics rests  
\> on math, a religious bias in math is bound to creep into physics. Thus, the  
\> first lesson in physics today relates to Newton’s “laws”. However, the  
\> belief that the cosmos is governed by eternal “laws” is not a scientific  

\> (refutable) belief, but \*is\*part of post-Crusade theology.35 This is an \*  
\> anti\*-Islamic belief, and has been recently used by newspapers such as the \*  
\> Guardian\*, London, to run down Islam as intrinsically anti-scientific.36 I  
\> also went into the \*content\* of Newton’s “laws”, and during my talk, I  

\> experimentally demonstrated that they fail: because Newton’s laws are  
\> reversible while most mundane experience is irreversible. As pointed out at  
\> the start of my talk,37 it is, of course, possible to save any theory from  
\> any experiment by piling on the hypothesis, as is done in current university  
\> texts in thermodynamics.38 Though relativity arose as a correction to  
\> Newton’s mistake in making time metaphysical,39 while trying to make the  
\> calculus rigorous (and not due to the Michelson-Morley experiment,40 as  
\> incorrectly taught in current university texts), its proper understanding  
\> was derailed, because Einstein grabbed credit for it,41 without fully  
\> understanding the theory.42 Einstein went on to become a figure of great  
\> scientific authority, and because the Western technique of validation is to  
\> rely on authority, scientific development was derailed for a century.  
\> Einstein is, thus, a key example to demonstrate the failure of Western  
\> methods of validating knowledge. (Scientifically illiterate Westerners who  
\> would rush to the stock device of condemning this thesis as “crank”, should  

\> pause to consider the point mentioned earlier, why the person ranked \*the\* best  

\> mathematician in the world, wanted credit for same thesis, in his Einstein  
\> centenary lecture!)  
\>  
\> To summarise, the following changes were proposed. (1) Eliminate the  
\> falsehoods in Western history. (2) Eliminate the religious bias in formal  
\> math and (3) in physics, by teaching calculus without limits and functional  
\> differential equations, respectively. Naturally, I also pointed to the  
\> dimension of hegemony. Referring these changes to Western-endorsed experts  
\> would raise a conflict of interests, for their lifetime accumulation of  
\> academic “merit” might vanish overnight if they agreed to the changes. So,  

\> there must be a change in the\*process\*, not merely the particulars of the  

\> curriculum. Hence, for these proposed curriculum changes to be successfully  
\> implemented, a fourth change is first needed. (4) A new model of validating  
\> knowledge, by eliminating the bad technique of reliance on the opinions of  
\> Western-endorsed experts articulated in secret. That technique encourages  
\> subservience to the West; if these “experts” have anything to say, they  
\> should debate it publicly. Instead of papers published, through a secretive  
\> process, I have proposed to measure academic merit by public debate and the  
\> demonstrable benefits to the community. This would expose the coopted  
\> colonised elite.  
\>  
\> The West might impose its educational model on client governments, but it is  
\> amusing to claim, as Wildavsky does, that the Western university model is  
\> perfect, so there is no alternative but to ape it. One could more  
\> confidently assert the opposite: that the West has little alternative but to  
\> implement the recommendations made above. For example, bad math education  
\> was one reason for the sub-prime crisis: the managers (from the best Western  
\> universities) lacked a personal understanding of the complex math of  
\> financial derivatives, and the risks they were taking. The traditional  
\> Western route of assimilating non-Western knowledge by attributing it to a  
\> Westerner has failed this time! So, it is time for Western universities to  
\> openly acknowledge and accept non-Western knowledge if they are not to  
\> decline swiftly!

\> calculus, but is differentiable on the Schwartz theory of distributions. But  
\> neither definition can be directly used for the nonlinear differential  
\> equations of physics, in the presence of shocks. The better way out is to  
\> appeal to the empirical, rather than Western mathematical authority. See,

\> Conference on Decolonising Our

\> conference  
\> at Universiti Sains Malaysia \<<http://www.usm.my/>\> (June 27-29, 2011, Penang,  

\> Malaysia). We’ve posted it here as it facilitates consideration of some of  
\> the taken-for-granted assumptions at play in most debates about the future  
\> of higher education right now. This statement, most of the talks presented  

\> at it\<<http://tvmultiversity.blogspot.com/2011/07/notes-on-decolonising-univ..>.>,  
\> and this memorandum to  
\> UNESCO\<<http://multiworldindia.org/07/memorandum-to-unesco/>\>,  

\> reflect an unease with the subtle tendencies of exclusion (of ideas,  
\> paradigms, models, options, missions) evident in the broad transformations  
\> and debates underway in most higher education circles, including in rapidly  
\> changing South and Southeast Asia. Our thanks to the organizers, especially

\>  
\> We – people from diverse countries\* in four continents – met in your lovely  
\> city of Penang for three days from June 27-29, 2011. We were invited  
\> by Universiti  

\> Sains Malaysia \<<http://www.usm.my/>\> and Citizens International to discuss  

\> the future of our universities and how we could decolonise them. Too many of  
\> them have become pale imitations of Western universities, with marginal  
\> creative contributions of their own and with little or no organic relation  
\> with their local communities and environments. The learning environments  
\> have become hostile, meaningless and irrelevant to our lives and concerns.  
\>  

\> \<<http://globalhighered.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/bannerdecolonising.jpg>\>In  

\> all humility, we wish to convey to you the gist of our discussions.  
\>  
\> We agreed that for far too long have we lived under the Eurocentric  
\> assumption – drilled into our heads by educational systems inherited from  
\> colonial regimes – that our local knowledges, our ancient and contemporary  
\> scholars, our cultural practices, our indigenous intellectual traditions,  
\> our stories, our histories and our languages portray hopeless, defeated  
\> visions no longer fit to guide our universities – therefore, better given up  
\> entirely.  
\>  
\> We are firmly convinced that every trace of Eurocentrism in our universities  
\> – reflected in various insidious forms of western controls over  
\> publications, theories and models of research must be subordinated to our  
\> own scintillating cultural and intellectual traditions. We express our  
\> disdain at the way ‘university ranking exercises’ evaluate our citadels of  
\> learning on the framework assumptions of western societies.  The Penang  
\> conference articulated different versions of intellectual and emotional  
\> resistance to the idea of continuing to submit our institutions of the mind  
\> and our learning to the tutelage and tyranny of western institutions.  
\>  

\> \* \*\*\<<http://globalhighered.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/decolonisingunipic.jpg>\>  
\> \*We leave Penang with a firm resolve to work hard to restore the organic  

\> connection between our universities, our communities and our cultures.  
\> Service to the community and not just to the professions must be our primary  
\> concern. The recovery of indigenous intellectual traditions and resources is  
\> a priority task. Course structures, syllabi, books, reading materials,  
\> research models and research areas must reflect the treasury of our  
\> thoughts, the riches of our indigenous traditions and the felt necessities  
\> of our societies. This must be matched with learning environments in which  
\> students do not experience learning as a burden, but as a force that  
\> liberates the soul and leads to the upliftment of society. Above all,  
\> universities must retrieve their original task of creating good citizens  
\> instead of only good workers.  
\>  

\> \*\*For this, we seek the support of all intellectuals and other like-minded  

\> individuals and organisations that are willing to assist us in taking this  
\> initiative further.  
\>  

\> Thank you for hosting us, the Delegates of the \*International Conference on  
\> Decolonising Our Universities\*, June 27-29. 2011, Penang, Malaysia
