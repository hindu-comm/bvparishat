I wonder how many on this list have studied the lengthy pieces referred to in the email below (they are required reading to understand the rejoinder of Prof. C. K. Raju). Here's a worm's view:



First aboutthe 40-year oldworm. I studied Mechanical Engineering in MVSR College of Engineering, a private college (did not score a decent enough rank to get into a government college)affiliated to Osmania University, Hyderabad during 1988-92. Then, I went to IIM-Ahmedabad (a case of late blooming - I got admission offers from all the four IIMs in 1993) during 1993-95 for a post-graduate diploma inmanagement (that is what IIM-A offers, not an MBA). Then, in 2003 I started learning Sanskrit with a view to read Vedanta in Sanskrit; I took a break from work and joined MA, Sanskrit in 2010 in Osmania University, Hyderabad. So, I have been to a private college, a government college, and an institution of excellence in India - and moved around (as a student)departments of engineering, management and humanities.



With this background, here is my response. First, the declaration of "International Conference on Decolonising our Universities" is totally tangential to India, the way I see it. Of the nearly 500 universities in India, less than 50 are in a position to contribute meaningfully to society. As my experience at IIM shows there is no historical baggage (IIMA still has a Harvard dinner on Friday nights, a tipping of its hat to Harvard, after which it was modelled) which is preventing IIMA from engaging with society meaningfully. Yours truly did a project which advised the Tourism Department of Gujarat on introducing in Gujarat, a train similar to "Palace on Wheels" which plies in Rajasthan; advised a manufacturer of isolation transformers to diamond processing centres in Gujarat, and worked for his summer internship in Bombay Hospital when MBAs were not common in hospitals. Prof.Anil Gupta used to - and still runs - a network of rural entrepreneurs called Honeybee.Going back to Prof. Raju's contentions, from which the Conference declaration seems to draw some of its statement contents, it does not matter if the mathematics we are taught is Christian, as long as some sort ofCalculus is taught and understood! Many of theengineers outside the IIT/NIT circuitcannot measure the approximate area of a piece of land consisting of rectangles and triangles (whose dimensions are available from Google Earth). I know this from practical first-hand experience in a real-life situation and that similar knowledge levels prevail, from the experience of having interviewed hundreds of engineers over the years.



The entire system seems to have very little expectations of its products, i.e. thegraduates. When I checked out in 1991,almost all the designs forsome 14,000 products used in India(from a tube holdingtooth-paste to the designed-in-1947 Ambassador car) were from outside India. The joke in Bokaro Steel Plant (where I worked) was that we had twosnow-clearing machines as theRussian plant whose design the Bokaro plant slavishly followed had them.We had three fractional distillation columns toisolate chemical by-products like naphtalene fromcoke-oven gas;of these, two were designed and erected by the Russians; one was designed (copied) and erected by Mescon,an Indian PSU- and the availability of that was less than 50%, compared to the robust performance of the other two. In our engineering college,we had alecturer of metallurgy who asked to prepared steel samples for microscopic examination not by pouring thecleaning solvent in "pour-pour-pour-pour" fashion but in "pour...pour.....pour....pour" fashion- he later became Principal of the MBA college! The parents, or the administrators or the politicians never bother if the studenthas learnt anything: the only thing they ask is whether the students got jobs or not. As employers, we check aptitude (that is the ability to gain knowledge) not knowledge - and build our own training centres to educate our future employees. Once some of the employees in my companyposted inChattisgarh complained that they did not get salaries in time; when I investigated, it turned out thatour HR manager insisted ongetting Bank DDs payable at Chattisgarh, while the banker was suggesting she make them payable at Raipur. She neither knew geography nor the rule in banking industry that DDs are payablein a specified city, nota State. Such are the products of our education system.



There is no problem withthe syllabus - a B.Sc. Mathematics graduatelearns partial,differential, complex calculus which helps him model the vibrations in a tabla (engineers do not bother with such exact modelling - theyuse factors of safety of3 and more; so, many simplifying assumptions, which introduce distortions in the range of 25% or less, are made), but his aspiration is to be a clerk in a bank, where arithmetic is the highest form of mathematical knowledge required.The problem with our system is that of expectations, not the religion and politics of textbooks and curricula. Both can be 50% worse than they presently are; if the remaining 50% is properly taught and learnt, we would be much better off.



I think Ben Wildavsky manages to capture that angst quite well, even if his tone of condescension is irritating. To that my reply would be: let us ignore the condescension and try to keep our house in better shape. My first reaction on reading Prof. Raju's rejoinder was along the lines of: "Ah! here is a person, good enough for stuff to be named after him in Mathematics, seems to be sure-footed about where Einstein and Newtonmade mistakes, has personal experiences ofWestern academicswronging him, and he has proved very persuasively why the Eastern model is better than the Western model". However, on second reading, I think it addresses a problem which is not there. The present problem is about abysmal expectations from the system (even the IIT grads don't 'do' engineering after passing out, though most are good enough to do so - I don't grudge them; it is their choice. I just want to point out that even in the case of our best institutions our graduates seldom do well what they are trained for), and the way everybody plays a game of emperor's clothes. Why Nalanda? The Sanskrit scholars turned out by our Universities can't match a present traditional scholar in their area of expertise. In traditional environment, a student is expected to know 100% with maybe 5% tolerance. Yet, we look down upon such traditional scholars. Do we have the political will to bringsuch standards into mainstream? We can expect learning to happen only when we start taking marks seriously and then have the expectation that 60% or 70% isthe moral passing mark, not the 35% (which is further aided by easily-fixed internals, liberal assessment, rampant copying and disgraceful grace marks to top it all).I know grade inflation has been documented in the Ivy league universities in USA as well, but the problem that we have in India is knowledge deflation on a very serious scale. While what Prof. Raju saysabout the Witzels of the Western world is quite true and his rejoinder's isthe attitude required while facing outwards, I think the need to be inward-facing is far more critical.



What we need to do is not decolonize our Universities, but just make sure they work.
