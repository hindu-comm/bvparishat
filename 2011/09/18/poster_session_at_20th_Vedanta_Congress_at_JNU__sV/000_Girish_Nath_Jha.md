Dear all

20th Vedanta got a great response in terms of automatic submissions of full papers to our server. The papers went through a rigorous reviewing and 63 papers were selected for presentation and publication. They are listed at <http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/20vedanta/selected.htm>

We have recently introduced a poster section which is open to all those (primarily research students) who would like to present innovative ideas or research to a larger audience and get feedback. The details on poster creation and presentation are at <http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/20vedanta/posterformat.html>. Please have a look at it and send a request to [20Ve...@mail.jnu.ac.in]() if you are interested.

The registration for participation is open at <http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/20vedanta/registration.jsp>

regards
