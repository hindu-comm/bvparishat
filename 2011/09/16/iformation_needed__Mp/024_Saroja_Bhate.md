Dear Sir

I am waiting for your suggestions and views on research methodology.It appears that the topic has taken a backstage though it is important.May I invite international scholars like Prof Ashok Aklujkar and Madhav Deshpande to enlighten us on this issue of vital importance? If research has to continue in Orientology, should there not be a uniform methodology? What should be its essentials atleast in which itshould be uniform?

Regards

Bhate
