Thank you Prof. Rajendran for making a beginning. My reaction to your points is as follows:

1.This norm exists since the beginning, but often is followed neither by guides nor by the referees. Degrees are awarded and we referees are the culprits, sorry for being harsh.

2. A uniform methodology with internal flexibility as far as adoptintion of a certain model is concerned needs to be introduced througout all the Univ.s awarding Ph.D. Can UGC play any role here in making the methodology obligatory?

3. I don't know if there exists any uniform set of international norms. As far as resarch papers of international scholarsare concerned I have seen that oftenindividual scholars have chosentheir ownnorms But if such a set exists it should be made available to all researchers and, again, made obligatory.

4Iagree.

5. Is it not the responsibility of the guide to see that?

6. I agree

7.This point can be debated  
My suggestions:

1First of all a complete bibliography of Ph.D. dissertations should be made available to all institutes in order tom avoid duplication.Information is ofcourse availble in certain journals and indices have also been prepared ( I had, in fact,made an attempt when I was HOD in Uni. Pune), But they are not exhaustive and there is no alternative for "exhaustive" in research

2.Admission into Ph. D. should not be confirmed un less the student submits a paper on Survey ofresearch in his respective area. This is to ensure that he has done library work.

Enough for the time being . This is, again, as you said, not some thing new but is meant to initiate discussion.

Regards

Bhate
