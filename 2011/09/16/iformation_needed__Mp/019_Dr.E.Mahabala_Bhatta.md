-- Most useful discussion has been pioneered by BVP regarding the quality of Ph.Ds and the Theses in Sanskrit now a days. If a student of Ph.D. seeks the catalogue of Chowkhamba Sanskrit series to "Prepare" his Bibliography then it is useless to ponder over the methodology and other strict norms of study. I will contribute my views in this regard shortly. I am also a Research Guide of Kannada University, Hampi.  
  
Thank you and regards,
