RespectedProf. Bhate madam

I have gone through your mails regarding Research methodology written toProfessor Rajendran, Prof. Narangand other members.You have written on 25th sept.2011- "I feel, some kind of brain storming is needed before anyone takes up the task of wriing a good book on the subject"

In this regard I would like to humbly submit that Kaivalyadhama'sPhilosophico-Literary Research Department isgoing to organize a National Seminar cum Workshop on **“Philosophico-Literary Research Methodology in Yoga”** to be heldin December 19-20, 2011 at Kaivalyadhama, Lonavla. I think this event can become a common platform for brain storming wherein the Experts and Scholars of thisfield can participate . I personally wish to invite you as key note speaker in the inaugural or veledictory session.(Brochure of the Seminar cum Workshop is attached herewith containing details thereof).

with humble regards

Dr.B.R.Sharma
