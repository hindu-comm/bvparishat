**Rt. Hon. V.S. Srinivasa Shastri \[1869-1946\]**

**--Whom Gandhiji called ‘My Brother’**



 The first half of the twentieth century in India witnessed a galaxy of orators and powerful public speakers like Ranade, Tilak, Aurobindo, S.Satyamurthy, H.V.Kamath, Nehru, Shyam Prasad Mukherji, Sarojini Naidu etc whose eloquence and oratory stimulated the mind and pleased the ear. To this galaxy of celebrated speakers belonged Rt. Hon. V.S. Srinivasa Shastri, who, by his facile fluency and flawless utterance of English, came to be known as the“Silver Tongued Orator of the British Empire ”.



 A close associate of Mahatma Gandhi, V.S.Srinivasa Shastry was teacher, legislator, ambassador and statesman, famous for being one of the few Indians who did the English language proud. Of all the representatives of the Government of India, Shastry was considered the most eloquent, articulate and brilliant. **In fact, he was considered one of the top five orators of the world.** Shastry was the disciple of Gopala Krishna Gokhale, along with Gandhiji. In fact, according to Shastry’s grand daughter Kausalya Ramaseshan, Shastry and Gandhiji shared such a close bond that they took pride in addressing each other as “Dear brother” in all their correspondence.



 Shastry was born just 10 days before Gandhiji on 22^(nd) September 1869 in a small village near Kumbakonam. His father was a priest with a meager income and his mother was a pious religious lady. Brought up in the orthodox traditional family, Shastry as a student walked six miles everyday to the High School at Kumbakonam. He passed his B.A. in first class in 1887 getting a second rank. Thereafter he joined the Mayavaram Municipal High School as a teacher on a salary of Rs.50 per month. Subsequently he joined the Hindu High School , Triplicane, Madras where he became the Head Master. He also founded the famous TUCS in Madras \[Triplicane Urban Co-operative Society\], long before the government thought of starting co-operative societies in Tamil Nadu.



 During his college days and as a teacher, Shastry cultivated an admiration for the English language and Sanskrit. In fact, English language and literature almost became his second love. Gradually he rose up in the ladder of life. But what really struck people about his life was that he gave up the profession as a teacher which he greatly loved and joined the Servants of India Society started by Gopalakrishna Gokhale in 1907. After Gokhale’s death in 1915, he became its President. He became actively involved and interested in the political arena in India and deeply concerned about the rights of Indians in the British Empire . Recalling the greatness of her grandfather as a true patriot of the country, Kausalya, Shastry’s granddaughter recollects “He was part of a generation that gave up all their earnings to the country as part of the Servants of India Society. The family was not well to do. He could have taken any job and made money. But he chose to remain poor”.



 As a member of the Indian National Congress, he was active in the campaign for Indian Home Rule. He founded the Indian Liberation Federation of which he became the President in 1922. In 1921 he went to England as a member of the moderate Deputation

He represented India in the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva . He was the first Indian to be as honored with the ‘Freedom of City” conferred on him by the Corporation of London on 19^(th) July 1921.



 Shastry used his language and eloquence to present India ’s case for Self-government in the councils of Europe . The British Government conferred on him the highest honour with membership of His Majesty’s Privy Council in 1921, carrying with it the title “Right Honorable” for his services to the cause of world peace, disarmament and democracy.. So, he is famous as the Right Honorable Srinivasa Shastry. The English, in fact, were so captivated by his speeches and his musical voice that they also bestowed on him another moniker ‘Silver-tongued orator’. Shastry also accompanied Gandhiji in 1930-31 to participate in the Round Table Conference held in London .



 While studying at the Kumbakonam College , Shastri once went to the class without the shirt, which got drenched in a sudden downpour. When he was fined eight annas for indecent dressing, Shastri told the Principal Bilderbeck “If I had eight annas with me, I would myself buy a new shirt”. Touched by the poverty of his brilliant student, the Principal paid the fine on behalf of his student and got him a new shirt. Nearly forty years later, in 1921, Shastri, now a Privy Councillor, on a visit to London , called on his former teacher Bilderbeck to pay his respects. Bilderbeck threw a party in honour of Shastri and invited some celebrities. Proposing a toast, Bilderbrck narrated the ‘Shirt incident’ to the invitees. While replying to the toast, Shastri opened a bag, which he was carrying, pulled out a shirt from it and showed it to the guests as a ‘precious present’ from his teacher which he had carefully preserved for nearly forty years.



 The abysmally poor conditions under which Shastri grew up could very well be imagined by the following moving speech which Shastri made in the Indian Legislative Council on 23^(rd) March 1923 . The Council was to deliberate on the Government of India’s proposal to double the Salt Tax. Recommending the abolition of the Salt Tax altogether, Shastri said:

 “**For many years, when I was a little boy, the prospect of starvation was a familiar companion and among my sharpest and bitterest recollections today is the circumstance that one year, when money was scarce and among the necessaries of life salt was one, my poor mother was obliged to decline a gift of mangoes because she could not afford to purchase the salt necessary to pickle it”.**



 During the Convocation of the Annamalai University at Chidambaram in 1937-38, there were three imposing personalities seated on the dais—Sir Raja Annamalai Chettiar, the Pro- Chancellor, Lord Erskine \[Governor of Madras\], the Chancellor and Rt. Hon. V.S. Srinivasa Shastri, the Vice-Chancellor. Even at the beginning of his formal address, Lord Erskine turned towards Shastri and said;

 **“Sir, it is with some trepidation that I begin my speech in English, my mother tongue, because of the inescapable feeling that neither in English pronunciation nor in the mellifluousness of your intonation can I match the excellence of your attainment in both the spheres. I am humble enough to acknowledge my limitation in both, before this august gathering”.**

** **Shastry always used to emphasize the fact that to learn any language with proficiency, one must study the grammar of the language thoroughly. He used to quote how the beauty of Sanskrit language cannot be appreciated without a background of Panini’s ‘Ashtadhyayi’. Recalling this profound advice given by her grandfather, Kausalya says:

 **“I have a letter that he wrote to me in 1943. In it he wrote: “I trust you have a dictionary by your side and look into it now and then. Let it become a ‘bad habit’ as some people might say. Truly, it is an excellent habit. When I tell you I consult the dictionary at least three times a day even now, you will realize how necessary it is. He always had many editions of Webster’s dictionaries on his table” **



 When Gandhiji’s Private Secretary Sri.Mahadeva Desai wished to get the English translation of Gandhiji’s ‘Autobiography’ revised in 1940, he turned to Shastry who undertook the task, on the specific condition that his name should on no account be disclosed. When Gopala Krishna Gokhale had to choose between Mahatma Gandhi and Shastry for the President ship o the Servants of India Society, Gandhiji wrote in ‘Young India’: “I feel that I possess all the qualities needed for Presidentship. At the same time I feel Mr. Shastry possesses in greater abundance many of the qualities which I do not possess. If the choice should fall upon him, what an admirable usurper!” Equally, Srinivasa Shastry had remarked about Gandhiji, “**Magnanimity! Thy name is Gandhiji**”.



 In his early years, Srinivasa Shastri grew up on the diet of traditional, mythological lore provided by his mother. As a student of the Kumbakonam High School , he learnt the finer aspects of Sanskrit literature and the commentaries on the great epics like the Ramayana, the Mahabharata etc. from eminent Sanskrit scholars of those days. The Ramayana had a profound impact on him and he described it as “One immortal product of the human mind without a rival in world’s literature—one that would rank among the noblest monuments of poetical. These lectures now form the text of his ever-popular book “Lectures on the Ramayana”. This book was compiled and published at the instance of Mahatma Gandhi who felt that Shastry’s profound scholarship on the Ramayana should not be lost to posterity. Unfortunately, by the time the book was published in 1949, both Gandhiji and Shastry had passed away.



 On Shastry’s passing away on 17^(th) April 1946 , Sarojini Naidu said, “Next to Rabindranath Tagore, Shastry was the greatest ambassador and the interpreter of Indian Culture abroad”






**B.M.N.Murthy** :  "genius”. Under the auspices of the Samskrit Academy , Madras , Shastry gave thirty discourses on the Valmiki Ramayana in 1944, almost extempore, to crowded audiences.
