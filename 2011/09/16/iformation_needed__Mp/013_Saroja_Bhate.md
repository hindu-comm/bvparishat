Dear Professor Rajendran

Thanks for your reaction to my querry. Yes, the material is scanty. I feel, some kind of brain storming is needed before anyone takes up the task of wriing a good book on the subject. Are you ready? I will be grateful if other scholasrs on BVP join this . I would be very happy if the scholars make, for instance concrete suggestions about the format(s)of research papers, articles, theses, etc. I find that no standard practice is being followed, for instance,even in writing footnotes. I can understand that the nature of footnotes depends upon the topic. But sometimes I find that footnotes are much longer than the main paper. How do you feel when you get entangled in too many details in the footnotes.?

Regards

Bhate
