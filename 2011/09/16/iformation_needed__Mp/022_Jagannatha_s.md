aaryaah, svasti.

  

I would like to share a story of [Prof.Hiriyanna.It](http://Prof.Hiriyanna.It) was told to me by Late Sam.skr.ta professor Srinivasa Raghavachar. Once, while teaching Alankarashastra, Prof.Hiriyanna told that the author of Kavyaprakasha has crammed so many examples in untidy manner in his work. What he has done is nothing but bad clerical job. My professor(then student of
Prof.Hiriyanna) opposing this harsh statement told\`Sir, Mammata wants to train the poets so it is quite natural that he gives ample examples.
But it does not mean that he lacks originality'. Forthwith Pro.Hiriyanna told\`That is your view.OK. I would like to have an article defending your opinion.' Srinivasa Raghavachar prepared an article in duration of 20 days. He collected materials from research articles and scholarly introductions from standard editions. He even added bibliography at the end of the article.(He was student of 1st year BA!) When the article was submitted to Prof.Hiriyanna, he took it without a word. The very next day he told\`I read your article.Nice
work.. I think you have now understood why I gave very rough remarks on Mammata. ' Moral of this story? Sam.skr.ta professors shall encourage their students TO WRITE. In my view, M.A. can be regarded as training course FOR WRITING research articles. Professors shall betrainersand students, trainees. It is not correct to say that if it is done properly all the defects of Ph.D process will be vanished
overnight. But the situation will be improved at least to some extent by implementing it.

S.Jagannatha.
