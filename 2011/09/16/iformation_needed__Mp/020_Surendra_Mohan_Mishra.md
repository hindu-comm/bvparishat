Esteemed Scholars,

  

The issue of PhD theses and their quality brought forth by Prof. Bhate,Prof. Rajendran and Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya is worth contemplating.Earlier such issues were raised by Dr Jagannath and others.

Sanskrit and Indology have now been accepted as a universal tool of research in many other areas and the same is possible through delving deep in to the traditions of knowledge deposited in Sanskrit and allied languages.Contemporary Sanskrit writing in creative and critical areas is also very significant which is again a matter of research in respect of language,subject and progress of ideas.

  

But sadly how much a Sanskrit and Indology research student is equipped to carry out the task ? His sole dependence on the mother tongue literature and scanty knowledge of Sanskrit and Shastra-s,lack of command on international languages like English are a great handicap.Sometimes you find in a Bibliography at the end of a PhD thesis only some base books in Sanskrit,some books in a certain regional language and no work or journal in English and other languages.Mention and use of general and subject-specific dictionaries, encyclopedias,concordances,unpublished manuscripts or net/web information are mostly conspicuous by their absence.

  

The Indian scenario of research in these and other areas including sciences is plagued by so many factors,the atmosphere is vitiated by all kinds of easy-way approaches,nepotism,casteism,regionalism,language-chauvinism,bureaucratic bottlenecks,insufficiency of library material,paucity or overflow of money and so on.

  

The list is endless.But the main reason is the lack of focused determination and abundant goodwill for work on part of the guide and the student in the spirit of saha viirya.m karavaavahai and saha nau brahmavarcasam.Not that the atmosphere makes us but we can make the atmosphere in spite of the hurdles.Great people in the recent past created such places of ideal research at Kolkata,Pune,Chennai, Varanasi,Hoshiarpur and many other places in India and abroad.But we also should learn from what their followers did or did not.

  

One thing I constantly think as to why the medium of teaching and examination for a graduate or post-graduate course in Sanskrit is any and every language but rarely Sanskrit.In the traditional institutions also the examination is in Sanskrit medium,but what Sanskrit it is,all of us know.Coming to a thesis,if the same is fortunately in Sanskrit,then misfortune mostly comes on you to read through it as very often the language and the subject are difficult judge.The problem at the beginning is rarely clearly spelled out and survey of literature seldom done in a sequenced and wholesome manner.The Viva Voce Exam is a often a fun,the less said of it the better.

  

My point is why can't we have at least 50% of the medium of teaching and examination at graduate and postgraduate studies of Sanskrit in Sanskrit language and why can't the UGC make such a provision ? The medium of examination right from class six up to class twelve is already Sanskrit in the CBSE syllabus and the books are designed accordingly,but what the teachers are doing is another story.The state boards vary as they have to play to the tune of language chauvinism at the cost of Sanskrit !

  

Unless we begin it at the beginning we can't expect it to emerge at the top stage in research.

  

I quote two verses from the Raamaaya.na to note the grievance of Das'aratha :

  

yas tu aamravana.m chittvaa palas'[aa.ms](http://aa.ms)' ca [ni.si](http://ni.si)\~ncati /

pu.spa.m d.r.s.tvaa phale g.rdhnu.h sa s'ocati phalaagame //

so 'ham aamravana.m chittvaa palaas'[aa.ms](http://aa.ms)' ca nya.secayam /

raama.m phalaagame tyaktvaa pas'caat s'ocaami durmati.h //

  

A couple of days back a student of M.A. Sanskrit 3rd Sem. came to me and asked if I knew as to whether the medium of National Education Test (UGC) has changed from only-Sanskrit to other mediums.I told him my ignorance of this,but told him that easy-going students like him were the spoilers of Sanskrit.I am thoughtful if the good decision taken by the UGC a few years back to bring back Sanskrit language knowledge on the rails,is again being diluted to satisfy the whims of some language-chauvinists among Sanskrit teachers and students ! If this is a fact,will somebody kindly advise the UGC not to be lax in it's estimation of the need of Sanskrit as a language ?

  

Best Regards,

SMMishra
