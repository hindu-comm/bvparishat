Respected Scholars !

Samskrit richly deserves the title Mahaabhaa.saa as of course she has a global presence.She is free from the limits of narrow chauvinisms of all kinds.

Uttarakhand has shown the way,but where are lovers of Samskrit in other parts of India ! Some positive churning is going on and sooner some result will be apparent.

Hebrew,a language spoken by a minuscule population,was completely lost in 6th c. b.c.e.,contemporary to the Buddha.But one individual and one family could ensure it's salvage and now Hebrew is the people's and official language in Israel ! But Samskrit is much more than just a living tongue,she is the very pivot on which Indianness thrives and from which it draws sustenance.

The all-India character of Samskrit,both spoken and written ought to be highlighted and we should demarcate the noble boundaries of Samskrit as a mega and mighty lingua franca in contemporary times.

The all-India Seminar as proposed by esteemed Prof. Sharma ji will be a good harbinger of such consolidation of our ideas on what is the good Samskrit word and which is not - within and without Paa.ninian framework.

If not as first official language but as the Mahaabhaa.saa of our pride,unity and global presence through our history of cultural dissemination,Samskrit ought to be treated with honor,care and pragmatic approach.I keenly look forward to the day when someone would make a Samskrit speech in the parliament and assemblies ! I think after the Constituent Assembly in the beginning,the efforts have slowed down or swept under the carpet.

  

Regards,
