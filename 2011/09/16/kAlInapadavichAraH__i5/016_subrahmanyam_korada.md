**Patanjali remarks in Paspas'Ahnika -- asti aprayukta.h iti sAhasamAtrameva , mahAn s'abdasya vis.aya.h ...etc.  
  
The word 'kendra ' is in fact widely used in Jyotis.am -  
**  
**Lagna , caturtha , saptama and das'ama (1,4,7,10) are called ' kendrasthAnam' , which is ' s'ubha' ( along with 'kon.a' , 3,5,9) and the Graha in any one of these Sthanas is considered to be rendering good results ( to be discussed) .  
  
There were 1137 S'Akhas of Veda itself . We cannot rule so easily .  
**  
As has already been suggested ( like **AnaphA etc** ) if there is the need (**gan.akayantra etc.) one can use the S'abdas in Sanskrit .  
**  
But as far as possible , it is better to stick to **VyAkaran.aprakriyA for any Samj\~nA (VyavahAra - tadas'is.yam samj\~nApraman.atvAt- Panini) . KUci - mancI are taken by Haradattamisra in Padamanjary ( others borrowed) .  
**  
**Taddhitas and Kr.ts are very useful in this regard -- dhUmy can be a word for a Train - make it rUd.ha .  
**  
There should be an effort on this front .
