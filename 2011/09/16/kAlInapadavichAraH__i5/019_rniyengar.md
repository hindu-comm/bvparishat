Dear Dr.Narayanan,  
I am well aware of the information provided by you. Hence my question!  
'Hridroga' in normal usage is not taken as an astronomical term. It  
would be interpreted as 'heart disease'. But 'Kendra-sachivah, kendra-  
sarvakaarah, prakashan-kendram,vivekananda kendram...etc' is used all  
over India even in Sanskrit writing and speeches. My personal opinion  
is; grammarians in any culture can not decide what 'basic words,  
roots,sounds' should be used 'for all times to come'. However, they  
can certainly say how such words should be used 'even in future' in  
the 'language' for which they write the grammar.  
best regards

RNI

Williams in his dictionary puts the term केन्द्रम् as the centre of a circle etc. He says it is a borrowed word from Greek term κέντρον (kentron) and it is discussed in the Sabdakalpadruma as an astronomical term लग्नम् and interestingly no etymology has been provided. The Siddhantashiromani says:  
\> वृत्तस्य मध्यं किल केन्द्रमुक्तं केन्द्रं ग्रहोच्चान्तरमुच्यतेऽतः।
