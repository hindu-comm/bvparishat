**It is called ' trimuni vyAkaran.am ' . Beyond the three Munis , no one is supposed to amend - is the norm . Such a norm is for obvious reasons - everybody claims to be a Muni and there will be chaos -- avyavasthA .  
**  
**In Gautamasmr.ti there is one SUtram dr.s.t.o dharmavyatikrama.h . MitAks.rA explains - Paras'urAma , ordained by his father , killed mother . Therefore people should not follow such ' S'[is.t.as](http://is.t.as) ' .  
  
Why to try to justify ' kAlIna ' which may widen already existing meaningless rift between VaiyuAkaran.as and NaiyAyikas ? There will be chain reaction - others add more words on these lines .  
  
The following has ben making rounds - tArkikA.h pas'ava.h ? vaiyAkaran.a.h tr.n.ava.h ? ata eva pas'ava.h ?  
  
Of course , kAn.Adam pAn.inIyam ca sarvas'AstropakArakam .  
  
Therefore , if it does not fall even in ' pr.s.odarAdi ' leave it as an 'apas'abda' .  
  
Please note that the word ' kAlika ' is used in TArkasamgrahasarvasvam etc also  
  
AngA.h , VangA.h etc are used by then , so modern names cannot be equated with them .  
  
One may use the modern Samj\~nA as it is . This is already discussed .  
  
There are some Persian words such as - anaphA , sunaphA, duradhurA , Apoklimam etc. in Jyotis.asranthas . Leave it .
