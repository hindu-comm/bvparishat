The printing done from microfilms (and other mircoforms such as microfiche) is, as far as my experience goes, slow (one has to print image by image) and inferior in appearance. It may be better for whole texts first to convert microfilms into computer-readable files (there are programs for this, although I do not know their names) and print from those files.
