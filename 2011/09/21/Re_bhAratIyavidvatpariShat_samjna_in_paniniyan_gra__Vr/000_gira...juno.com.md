What is the exact meaning of the word 'SamjnyA'?



There is a chapter "SamjnyA PrakaraNam" in the book "VyAkaraNa-Candrodaya" of late Pundit Shree CArudeva Shastri. It
explains samjnyAs of PAniNi grammar.



Now I have a simple question- Could samjnyA have a specific meaning?Examples 'Svara' is samjnyA. Vyanjana is samjnyA, Upasarga is samjnyA. But tree (SAmAnya nAma), NArAyaNa (Vishes'a nAma), he, she (SarvanAma) are not samjnyAs.



Please help me to resolve my thoughts. Thanks. N.R.Joshi



In **Astadhyayi the term 'samj\~nA' is employed in several meanings** --  
  
1.**sam + j\~nA (kryAdi - avabodhane) (bhvAdi and curadi are also there) - bhAve an' by ' Atas'copasarge' (3-3-106) --samj\~nAnam samj\~nA = understanding (of Linga, SamkhyA etc) .**
