Respected Scholars,  
  
I have a little query regarding background of the ancient text of the sacred Gita. It is widely known the Gita is actually a part of Mahabharata consisting of the teachings of Shri Krishna to Arjuna before the battle of Kurukshetra. Gradually, with time, the Gita began to be considered a separate text from the Mahabharata.  
  
I would like to know the time period from when this change took place and gained prominence. I would also like to know where this convention, of considering the Gita as a separate text, was practiced in the early stages. Was there any sort of contribution of any philosophical school or any particular sect of Hinduism to this particular occurrence? Was it patronised by any ruler/dynasty during that period when the change took place??  
  
I would like to know if anyone has ever worked on this topic. I would also like to know some books/links which can provide me with information regarding this topic.  
  
Regards,
