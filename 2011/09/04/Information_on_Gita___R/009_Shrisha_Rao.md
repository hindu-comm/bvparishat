\> Respected Sir,  
\> The term kali in Sanskrit is used to indicate battle. Kali is an era too, for a period of 432000 years.  
\> The Rajatarangini says: The kins of Kuru and Pandu were born after 653 years past of the Kali era.  
\> शतेषु षट्सु सार्द्धेषु त्र्यधिकेषु च भूतले।  
\> कलेर्गतेषु वर्षाणामभवन् कुरुपाण्डवाः॥ (The Rajatarangini.1.51).

I am not sure that is the meaning; it is quite well known and established that the Pandavas existed in the द्वापर, while the Kauravas were wiped out in the war itself, dated at 3138 BCE, the Pandavas departed at the start of the कलियुग, 36 years later in 3102 BCE.

This verse seems to say that the race of the Kurus/Pandavas existed for 653 years of the Kali era.

It can be related to the following, from the महाभारततात्पर्यनिर्णय of Madhva (I haven't looked up the original reference in the महाभारत, but it should be there somewhere, esp. in the Southern text):

तमाह भगवान् कृष्णो यावत् पाण्डवसन्ततिः \|  
तावन्न ते भवेच्छक्तिः प्रवृत्तस्यापि भूतळे \|\| ३०.४२ \|\|

पाण्डवेभ्यः परं यावत् क्षेमकः क्रमवर्द्धिता \|  
क्षेमकात् परतः पूर्तिं शक्तिस्ते यास्यति ध्रुवम् \|\| ३०.४३ \|\|

Here Kali is addressed saying that as long as the descendants of the Pandavas exist in the world, he, Kali, would not have (full) strength though he would be in action (for it is his age). His strength would gradually increase, and upon the end of the Pandava dynasty after Kshemaka (the final descendant of Parikshit, Janamejaya, etc., who died without leaving a successor), Kali would certainly gain full strength.

Thus, we may infer that the first 653 years of the Kali Yuga were benign, when the full power of evil had not taken hold.

\> So, it nears the year of battle. But there should be a kalidinasankhyaa of the start of the battle. Could it be traced from the Mahabharata?
