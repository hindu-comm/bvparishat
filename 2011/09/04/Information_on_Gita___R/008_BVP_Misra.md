*Dear Dr. Narayanan,*

*Thanks for all the trouble you have taken to clarify my doubt. In the Panchanga (of Orissa) we find the current (financial) year to be 5113rd year of Kaliyuga. (I suppose the difference of one year from 5112 stated by you is insignificant for such a long period). *

*Accordingly the Kurkshetra battle of Mahabharata, which took place 36 years before the beginning of Kaliyuga, was in the year 3138 B.C.*

*Will you please confirm if this is correct? *

*Regards.*

*Yours truly,*

*D D Misra *
