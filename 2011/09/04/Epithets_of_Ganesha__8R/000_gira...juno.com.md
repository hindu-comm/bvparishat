Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Epithets of Ganesha





This is the time of festival of Ganesha. Genesha is called Heramba. Is there any reason for that? Heramba means a buffalo, a boastful hero. I do not see any connection to Ganesha?

Am I missing something here?



Ganesha is also called ढु॑ढि (राज) What is the meaning of this epithet ? I also come across name धु॑डि (राज).Please let me know the correct spelling between the two names along with its meaning. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
