Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Please send to me papers of Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murthy after installing fonts he posted. I have limited knowledge of computer just enough to use MS Word, Power Point, Photoshop, Excel. Istudied many languages of computers and forgot all of them.I am not a computer software person sitting on the keyboard eight hours day.I get perplexed in installing different fonts on my computer. When time comes, none of them seems to be useful in all cases. Is it possible for BVP scholars to use one single font to write Devanagari letters in their postings and ask everybody to install the same fontson their computers.I do not know what Unicode font I have on my computer, It does not have all Sanskrit Devanagari letters (I do not have ksh and jny, short ri, long ri , short lri). Please help me. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
