Yes, you can install Ubuntu (in particular) on a separate disk partition, or else run Linux inside a virtual machine. However, I recommend that a first-time user of Linux not attempt these by himself, but get some local admin or geek-type to help.

I do slightly disagree with the previous message, though; Linux is superior in several ways to Windows, but not necessarily so in ease of font handling, and it is not easy or trivial for a Windows user to move to it. Among other things, people should be aware that they will be stuck with Open Office or Libre Office (which can be awkward or unsatisfactory at times), and be obliged to move way from the standard MS Office, if they switch to Linux from Windows. This may not be an issue for people who use TeX Live 2011 (LaTeX, XeLaTeX, etc.) entirely and do not need MS Word, but it should give pause to people who primarily use MS Word for their documents.

My own solution, on both grounds -- ease of font handling as well as having all MS applications remaining available, is to use a Mac instead.

\> It is true that the programme Windows is having problem in dealing with the fonts. It attracts virus too. But if you can get the Linux installed in your system, alternatively switching from Windows to Linux, or by keeping the Windows intact in the system, all problems regarding fonts are over. Because Linux has got the KeyBoard Preferences of in built fonts which are Unicode in nature. You can type out by selecting any script in Asia and a few of the Europe or Africa with same key pattern. Please note that Linux is virus-free for a larger extent, so no question either of damaging your system. You will get Impress, Writer, Draw etc. in Linux to be substituted for your Power Point, Coral Draw/Photoshop, and MS Word. You will have a text editor in place of the Note Pad of your Windows. To the best of my limited experience the Linux out put whether it is Fedora, Ubuntu or Kubuntu is excellent in clarity in comparison to that of the Windows. To install the Linux Program I am sure that any college going student can help you. The younger generation are very quick in learning such facilities. With best wishes, Sir.
