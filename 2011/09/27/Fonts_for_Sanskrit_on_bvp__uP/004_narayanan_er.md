Respected Professor Joshi,

It is true that the programme Windows is having problem in dealing with the fonts. It attracts virus too. But if you can get the Linux installed in your system, alternatively switching from Windows to Linux, or by keeping the Windows intact in the system, all problems regarding fonts are over. Because Linux has got the KeyBoard Preferences of in built fonts which are Unicode in nature. You can type out by selecting any script in Asia and a few of the Europe or Africa with same key pattern. Please note that Linux is virus-free for a larger extent, so no question either of damaging your system. You will get Impress, Writer, Draw etc. in Linux to be substituted for your Power Point, Coral Draw/Photoshop, and MS Word. You will have a text editor in place of the Note Pad of your Windows. To the best of my limited experience the Linux out put whether it is Fedora, Ubuntu or Kubuntu is excellent in clarity in comparison to that of the Windows. To install the Linux Program I am sure that any college going student can help you. The younger generation are very quick in learning such facilities. With best wishes, Sir.  



Regards,  
Narayanan
