namaste,

  
2011/9/3 Tilak Rao \<[rao....@gmail.com]()\>:

  
\> Is there any research book on samjnas of Paniniyan grammer? viz.  
\> samjnas used, benifits, whether the samja shabdas are having meaning  
\> or not etc.....

You may like to have a look at the book by Mahamahopadhyaya Shri  
Vasudev Abhyankar  
<http://www-roc.inria.fr/~upadrast/Sanskrit/Dictionary_of_Sanskrit_Grammar/>  
which is perhaps the one of the only books of the kind.

namaste  
Ramakrishna
