The compiler of this very useful dictionary (1961) is the late Prof. K(ashinath) V(asudev) Abhyankar, son of the great pandit Mahamahopadhyaya Vasudev(shastri) Abhyankar.

The second revised edn was done by the late Prof. J.M. Shukla and was published by the Oriental Institute in Baroda in 1977.

There is an earlier and still useful dictionary in French:  
Renou, Louis. 1957. Terminologie Grammaticale du Sanskrit. Paris: Librarie Ancienne.
