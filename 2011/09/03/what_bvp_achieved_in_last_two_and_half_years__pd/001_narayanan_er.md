Respected scholars,

Ihave been a member of this group since August 2010. I personally like the scholarly conversations of profound scholars in both Sanskrit and English media. I have not observed any negative impact of this particular mail group. Yes, there mighthave had some rare postings of irrelevant advertisements or some sort of mocking by some teenagers as a few of them are accustomed to such activities, still pardonable. But at the same time, one can hardly deny the fact that the versatile contributions of the group membersin different branches of study helped the group to grow to an enormous extent. It is not necessaryto name each and every scholar, and all the members knew that whatthose great such scholars are capableto deliver with their consistent efforts since their childhood with their adamant love and dedication to the Indian studies. Personally I feel that I have improved a lot upon my studies, thanks to all the scholarly teachers of the group. I feel blessed to be a member of the group, I don’t know whether I am deserved to be a member of any *vidvatparishad*, where the participants are supposed to present their *vidvatta* which I lack in all subjects of Indology. With my humble Sanskrit studious perception, I observe the group as a common platform for gaining an incredible improvement in my studies. Thanks to electronics,we are now capable to get in touch with the modern Patanjalis, Kanadas, Yaskas, Varahamihiras, Carakas, Valmikis, Vyasas Bharatamunis and Kapilas within fractions of seconds!!! I express my gratitude to Professor Pandurangi for providingthis opportunity to share a few words on the group. I pray goddess Sarasvati to make the group successful in all its perspectives. I hereby express my humble salutations to all the scholars of the group.



Regards,  
E R Narayanan
