dear all, happy rsipancami and best wishes.

  

what I want to know is

  

1\. what bvp has been able to achiev in last two and half years.

  

2\. if it is successfull, where lies the line of success? if not, what are the reasons for it?

  

3\. what we have to do in the future to acheive our goal that was described in welcome message (no more available) "Welcometo Bhaaratiiya-vidvat-parishat - a growing community of Sanskrit Researchers in India. This is a platform to share your ideas, research papers, presenations, projects etc., to discuss the issues related to Sanskrit Research - Philosophy, Literature, Grammar, Science and many more...."

  

I humbly request everybody to share their views openly. there is no न ब्रूयात्सत्यमप्रियम् it will only help us to move forward

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
