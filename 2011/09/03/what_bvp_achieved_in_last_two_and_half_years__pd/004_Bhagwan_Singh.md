Respected members of the club,

I feel honoured to be a member of the club. I have immensely profitted from the discussions and postings of active participants. Even so I do not read all the mails as some of them could form part of private communication. Personal greetings and accolades fall in this category. But even such postings are neither embarrassing nor totally useless, as they inform us of some achievement on the part of someone whom we love. Just a matter of availability of time. In fact I have benifitted most from the mails and posings ftom Kalyanaraman ji, and the discussions among scholars on problems of Sanskrit grammar. Thanks to Dr. Pandurangi for the stocktaking.
