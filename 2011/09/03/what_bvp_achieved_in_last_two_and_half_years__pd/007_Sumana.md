Revered Scholars,  
  
I am a member of BVP since just a couple of months but I'm completely enamored by the discussions and knowledge sharing in a variety of topics happening here. The wisdom and understanding of tens and hundreds of great scholars is available here at just a simple mail away.  
  
I totally second Dr Tirumala Kulakani when he says, we must have the best of these discussions collated and saved in some form for the future reference also.  
  
I'm extremely thankful to Dr Varkedi and Dr Tirumala Kulakarni for giving me this wonderful key to the treasure chest of knowledge.  
  
Looking forward for lot more of learning...
