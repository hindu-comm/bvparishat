Dear Members,

This has been a most rewarding experience for me. First of all I have come to know the names of a number of great Sanskrit scholars working in different saastras. Secondly I am impressed with the give and take that this forum has generated with a degree of mutual respect. And thirdly the chaste Sanskrit compositions are a joy to read specially for people like me who living outside the country do not get many chances to interact with fluent Sanskrit speakers. Thank you Pandurangiji for starting this wonderful forum.

Om
