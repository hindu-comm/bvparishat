Meluhha, Mlecchas, Indus script and Pakistani twisted research



Many thanks to Dr. Kalyanraman for posting this article on Meluhaa with map.There is always discussion in OIT theory that Anu and Drahyu went out of the subcontinent long ago to populate Europe. Mlecchas appear to be descendants of Drahyu tribe (page 902, Puranic Encyclo-Vettam Mani). Now I do not know whether Mlecchas were the same ancient people as Meluhhas. Perhaps history scholars can throw light on it. Also in the same area (east of Sindhu river) were ancient people called Mahaavris'a. Dr. S.R.Raois of opinion ( if I remember correctly) that there is connection of Mahaavris'as to Indus script. Ancient history shows that descendants of Drahyu and Anudrahyu were there in ancient land now called Pakistan.



Now an article appeared on Meluhha in Pakistan Chronicle of Sept 16 (Houston). The writer is claiming that Indus civilization has nothing to do with India (Bharata). At that time tribes were independent of each other. So Indians can call themselves Gangains or Tamiliansbut not Indians. He adds that there was no Akhanda Bharata until British forced warring hindu tribes to accept British rule.



The purpose of writing this is -No matter what Indians dream, the fact is that world recognizes a country by "**her borders, culture and language**" Some Indian scholars may dream Sanskrit as Mahabhas'a (no intention to hurt anybody's feelings), the fact is in today's India **English is Mahabhas'a.** I am saying this because Bhas'a has practical aspect to it-it should be the same all over the country-in banks, on railway stations, in govt offices, in schools, in colleges, on bus stations. However Indians could not reach agreement on this vital issue even after 60 years of Independence. No point in giving example of Hebrew. So there is no use of Rajiv Malhotra writing the book , "Breaking of India". It shows that he is good scholar. World sees India as multilingual multitribal, mosaic hammered together by British rule and continuesusing former ruler's language. It is high time India come out of dreamland. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

### Meluhha corpora: Indus language, script

Meluhha as a language and Indus script as a messaging system in contact/interaction areas are attested archaeologically and in epigraphia of indus script inscriptions. Corpora (plural of 'corpus') related to Meluhha as a language and Indus script epigraphia have become available, thanks to the dedicated work of many researchers.

Hermeneutics is the science of discovering new meanings and interpretations in ‘all those situations in which we encounter meanings that are not immediately understandable but require interpretive effort’ (Gadamer, Hans-Georg. 1976, Philosophical Hermeneutics, ed. and trans. by David E. Linge, Berkeley: University of California Press, xii). Such an interpretive effort has led to the decoding of Sarasvati hieroglyphs as the repertoire of miners and metalsmiths of the civilization in a linguistic area. The ancient words read rebus can be traced in many Bharatiya languages as borrowings from mleccha (Language X + proto-Munda).
