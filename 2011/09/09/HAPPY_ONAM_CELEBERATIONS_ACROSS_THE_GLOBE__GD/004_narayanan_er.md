Dear Shri Arjuna,  
The Vedic and Puranic quotations are not meant for any proof. But the seasonal festivals are justified with some concepts and stories. Here the Puranic Vaamana's trivikrama form resembles to what has been described in the Vedic Mantra. Worshipping or honouring deities and kings by picking up absolute ideals from the Puranas or from some other myths, with a view to establishing the authenticity of reasons of worship during festivals. Lord Vishnu who deprived Bali by his becoming of avaamanaship from vaamanaship (पाणौ तु पतिते तोये वामनोऽभूदवामनः। ). Still one who deprives is worshipped. The expectation of return of Bali rule is a myth. More than two times of Keralites across its border through out the globe celebrate it though the cultivation of harvest culture has already been vanished. But people select a particular date and time for celebration in the name of festival even everything are available in the market. If you worship Vaamana or honour Bali where from you get these terms, Purana or Upapurana- it could be Vishnupurana, Srimadbhagavata or Vaamanapurna. The Vedic statement त्रेधा निदधे पदम् is a forerunner for ममाग्निशरणार्थाय देहि भूमिं पदत्रयाम्।। As you have already mentioned: "Bali will come to earth to see his people on BALIPADYAMI when we celebrate Deepavali festival" Yes, Deepavali too need a Puranic support for justification, and people do believe in such stories very sincerely, but in either of the case it cannot be treated as proof rather than belief. Otherwise it cannot be argued in a way that why you light oil lambs when halogen lambs are available, or why do you celebrate even without any dependable harvest is avaited. When people migrate right across the globe people carry such tradition of festivities along with them for generations too. Remember, Deepavali too celebrated right across the globe. Any moment of joy in the form of festivals are celebrated, the maintenance for generations are with the support of myths and which covers boundaries of regions, caste and religion. If you take Holi, you may get Puranic support stories. Enjoy the day.   



Regards,  
Narayanan
