Respected Scholars,  
ONAM is celebrated across the globe today. What is ONAM then? it is a short form of TIRUVONAM. It came out of the Sanskrit term श्रावणम् (श्रवणा नक्षत्रविशेषः, श्रवणाया इदं श्रावणम्). Today's constellation appearance in sky is Sravanaa. Then why celebrate? There is a Trivikrama concept on Vishnu from the Vedas. As it reads:  
इदं विष्णुर्विचक्रमे त्रेधा निदधे पदम्।  
समूळमस्य पांसुरे॥ (ऋग्वेदः-१.२२.१७)  
Puranas support the fifth incarnation of Vishnu as Vaamana who acted as Trivikrama to oust Bali, the grandson of Prahlaada. The Vaamanapurana Adhyaya-39 reads:  
इत्युक्तो दैत्यपतिना प्रीतिगर्भावितं वचः।  
प्राह सस्मितगम्भीरं भगवान् वामनाकृतिः॥  
ममाग्निशरणार्थाय देहि भूमिं पदत्रयाम्।  
सुवर्णग्रामरत्नादि तदर्थिभ्यः प्रदीयताम्॥  
एतच्छुत्वा तु गदितं वामनस्य महात्मनः।  
ददौ तस्मै महाबाहुर्वामनाय पदत्रयम्॥  
पाणौ तु पतिते तोये वामनोऽभूदवामनः।  
सर्वदेवमयं रूपं दर्शयामास तत्क्षणात्॥  
जित्वा लोकत्रयं कृत्स्नं हत्वा चासुरपुङ्गवान्।  
पुरन्दराय त्रैलोक्यं ददौ विष्णुरुरुक्रमः॥  
सुतलं नाम पातालमधस्ताद्वसुधातलम्।  
वलेर्द्दत्तं भगवता विष्णुना प्रभविष्णुना॥  

There is a Vaamana Temple in Trikkakkara, Cochin, and the deity is popular by name Trikkaakkarayappan who is specially worshipped today with special poojas. Bali was believed to be an ideal ruler where there had no calamities and all virtues were upheld during his regime. Imaginatively, no lies, no deprive and all people were equal in status and quite naturally people were happy with his rule. Indra didn't like it and requested Vishnu to oust Bali out of regime and Vishnu did so him out of the earth to sutala of paataala, quite far below.  
Moreover, ONAM is one of the three harvest festivals of Kerala, where paddy was cultivated thrice in every year. Vishu and Tiruvatira are other harvest festivals. It is believed that Bali visits his people once in every year on the day of Tiruvonam (Sraavanam). On this day people expect such kindness from their rulers having no lies, no deprive and unique social status. After each harvest wealth in the form of paddy indicates the prosperity.
