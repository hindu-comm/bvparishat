> Dear Narayanan sir,



  

Mahabali, after his visit during September, reaches Tulunadu and becomes Tulunada baliyendre for 3 days and then reaches the Maharashtra for a stay of one month festival again, after Deepavali.

  

It is a royal tour from Patala, to earth Madhyama loka. Patala, according to Vettom Mani, the writer of Puranic Encyclopedia is none other than Kerala, known as Mavelikara, the shore of Mahabali. So during the two months he is on a tour once in a year to Madhyamaloka from where he was ousted. It is only 3 day stay in Parashuramakshetra, onward journey towards Maharashtra. Thereafter, the madhyama loka ends and returns back. Though the celebration is enjoyed for 10 days by school boys, the actual festival for 3 days as during the Deepavali in Tulunadu. In Maharashtra, the school children enjoy 1 month vacation on account of it.

  

How is it?
