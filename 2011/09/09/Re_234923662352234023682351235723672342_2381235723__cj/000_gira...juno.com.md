Thank you very much Prof S.P. Narang. And I would like to thank other scholars who responded to my postings. I am not getting time to thank individually due towork pressure.



I would like to add that I benefited very much from postings on BVP. There are many popular websites on Indian culturenowadays. But BVP has created its special place all over the world. My thanks to Dr. Veeranarayan Pandurangi for this undertaking. My thanks to Dr. S. Varakhedi for introducing me to BVP.
