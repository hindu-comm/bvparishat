Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Time of Kurukshetra War



Dr. D.D.Misra is interested to know year or time of Kurukshetra war. Dr. E.R.Narayan in his Sept 6 posting gave a verse from reference of Rajatarangini. Varahmihira (died in AD 587) with whom historian Kalhana agrees, which does not date the beginning of Kaliyuga from the battle of Mahabharata, but reckons this battle as having been fought in the 653rd year of the Kaliyuga, that is, around 2449 BC. Dr. E.R.Narayan can correct me if there is misunderstanding on my part. Although I write on Mahabharata on BVP, I never expressed my opinion on the time of this war. Reason-I am not an astronomer. And my experience in talking with Indian astronomers is that they never agree with each other on even few points.Also naming of stars, Nakshatra, rAshis by ancient writers also differ. Instead of looking towards distant stars, I prefer to look at evidence here on earth, archaeology. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
