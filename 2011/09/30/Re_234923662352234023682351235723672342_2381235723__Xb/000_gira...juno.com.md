Animal behavior!



Animal behavior before arrival of natural disasters is the subject of observation. Ancient Indians were observing these things like any other ancient countries. Elephants in the coastal area of Thailand got warning of coming Tsunami disaster before human realized it. Earthquake waves under the ocean traveled to the feet of elephants through the solid earth before it reached the surface of ocean and pushed water towards the coast. Shock waves, sound waves travel faster in solids than in water. The low frequency and long wavelengthwaves were detected by big feet of elephants acting as big acoustic emission sensors. Thanks.

Dear Sir!  
  
Animal behaviour, even normal, as observed will serve a good purpose  
towards your end. In Sabara Bhashya there is a mention of dogs fasting on  
krishna caturdasi nights while discussing adhikara for Vedic rituals in  
codanAlakshana.
