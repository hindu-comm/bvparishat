*September 30, 2011*



 A Google search revealed there is journal called *Indian Philosophy* (Springer). It seems to be dominated by Western Indologists like Sheldon Pollock. This means its science and metaphysics content is close to zero. Also it has typical Western, theological distortions.



 Can someone enlighten me if there is a philosophy of science journal in India that is more 'hard core' from a science point of view. I am thinking of starting one, but want to make sure it fills a niche that needs to be filled.



Thank you,

N.S. Rajaram
