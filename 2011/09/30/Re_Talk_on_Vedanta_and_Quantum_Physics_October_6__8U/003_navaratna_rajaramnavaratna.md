VEDANTA AND QUANTUM PHYSICS  
The need of the hour is to build a school of thought in philosophy of science that combines Vedanta and modern science.  
Dr Navaratna Rajaram  
ABSTRACT  

 It is often claimed that unlike in the medieval Christian world, Hindu tradition has never been hostile to scientific thinking. This is a gross oversimplification that misrepresents the nature of the conflict between the Church and the scientific theories of Galileo, Copernicus and others. The real conflict was between theology (the word of god) and science which is a human creation and their respective claims in describing the heavens which was seen as God’s creation. This conflict did not arise in the Hindu tradition because its philosophy for the most part is not theological.  

 In the Hindu tradition, there is a clear distinction between shruti (Vedas) and smriti or derived texts. In the words of Shankara (788 – 820 AD), one of the seminal figures of Vedanta, “Scripture (shastra) is not any word of God but compilation of knowledge gained through karma (action or empirical) and gnana (gnosis or thought).” In other words it is human creation and open to question.  
 The central problems of Vedanta are the same as those of the foundations of quantum physics— duality and reality. The great medieval thinker Madhva (1238 – 1317) addressed these issues, especially of reality in a metaphysical work known as Tattva-Viveka. He asserted that “There exist two orders of reality— independent and dependent (or unmanifest and manifest).” He further noted: “The knowledge of the many through knowledge of the One, is to be understood in terms of the preeminence of the One.”  
 Madhva’s view was echoed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger, himself a committed Vedantin. He wrote: “It is quite easy to express the solution in words, thus: the plurality that we perceive is only an appearance; it is not real. Vedantic philosophy, …has sought to clarify it by a number of analogies, … \[of\] the many-faceted crystal which, while showing hundreds of little pictures of what is in reality a single existent object, does not really multiply the object.”

  
 All this indicates that a school of thought in philosophy of science that draws on Vedantic metaphysical thought that is at the same time scientifically rigorous can prove to be fruitful.
