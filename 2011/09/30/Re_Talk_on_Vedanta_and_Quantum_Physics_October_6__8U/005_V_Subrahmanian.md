Sir,  
  
On the face of it there is a great contradiction, I think, when we read this statement from your Abstract:  
  
//Madhva’s view was echoed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger, himself a committed Vedantin. He wrote: “It is quite easy to express the solution in words, thus: the plurality that we perceive is only an appearance; it is not real. //  
  
Does Madhva or his school that has enriched the Dvaita system over the centuries with innumerous works endorse the above view? Do they not swear by 'bheda-satyatva'?
