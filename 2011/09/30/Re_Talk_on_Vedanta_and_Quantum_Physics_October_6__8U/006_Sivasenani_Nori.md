Sir



While I understand "the need to build a school of thought", I wonder whether it isnot important to present the thoughts of old thinkers accurately, or reject them if that does not suit the purpose at hand. With reference to the above thought attributed to Sankara, with my limited knowledge, I think the reverse is true, that is Sankara thought that God is the source of Saastra.



To support my thinking, I have given the references from Brahmasutrabhashya below. It might be that Sankara had said the thought attributed to him at some other place that I have not studied. I request you to kindly give the reference to clear my understanding as though his writing is vast, Sankara usually does not contradict himself.



Now, the references:Sankara commenting on the sutra **śāstrayonitvāt** (1.1.3, Brahma sutras) starts with the sentence:"*mahata ṛgvedādeḥ śāstrasyānekavidyāsthānopa-bṛṃhitasya pradīpavatsarvārthāvadyotinaḥ sarvajñakalpasya yoniḥ kāraṇaṃbrahma \|*"



Thibaut's translation of the above is: *"Brahman is the source, i.e. the cause of the great body of Scripture, consisting of the Rig-veda and other branches, which is supported by various disciplines (such as grammar, nyâya, purâna, &c.); which lamplike illuminates all things; which is itself all-knowing as it were."*



Swami Gambhirananda's translation: "*Brahman is the yoni (i.e. the material and efficient cause) of great scriptures (sutras) (like the Rigveda etc.) which are supplemented by other scriptures (FN) that are themselves sources (of various kinds) of knowledge, which reveal all things like a lamp, and which are most omniscient.*"



"FN (Footnote): Works on mythology, logic, discussion on religious and social duties, Siksa, Kalpa, Vyakarana, nirukta, chandah, jyotis."



It is truethat Sankara also offers an alternative explanation of the Sutra, that is Sastra is the source of knowledge about Brahman. The references are:



Sankara: "*athavā yathokta ṛgvedādiśāstraṃ yoniḥ kāraṇaṃ pramāṇamasya brahmaṇo yathāvatsvarūpādhigame \| śāstrādeva praṇāṇājjagato janmādikāraṇaṃ brahmādhi-gamyata ityabhiprāyaḥ \| śāstramudāhṛtaṃ pūrvasūtre- 'yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante' ityādi \| kimarthaṃ tarhīdaṃ sūtraṃ, yāvatā pūrvasūtra evaivañjātīyakaṃ śāstram-udāharatā śāstrayonitvaṃ brahmaṇo darśitam \| ucyate- tatra pūrvasūtrākṣareṇa spaṣṭaṃ śāstrasyānupādānājjanmādi kevalamanumānamupanyastamityāśaṅkyeta tāmāśaṅkāṃ nirvartayitumidaṃ sūtraṃ pravavṛte śāstrayonitvāditi \|\| 3 \|\|*"



Thibaut: *"Or else we may interpret the Sûtra to mean that Scripture consisting of the Rig-veda, &c., as described above, is the source or cause, i.e. the means of right knowledge through which we understand the nature of Brahman. So that the sense would be: through Scripture only as a means of knowledge Brahman is known to be the cause of the origin, &c., of the world. The special scriptural passage meant has been quoted under the preceding Sûtra 'from which these beings are born,' &c.--But as the preceding Sûtra already has pointed out a text showing that Scripture is the source of Brahman, of what use then is the present Sûtra?--The words of the preceding Sûtra, we reply, did not clearly indicate the scriptural passage, and room was thus left for the suspicion that the origin, &c., of the world were adduced merely as determining an inference (independent of Scripture). To obviate this suspicion the Sûtra under discussion has been propounded."*



Swami Gambhirananda: "*The scriptures, viz the Rig-veda etc., just enumerated, are the valid means of knowing (yoni) the real nature of this Brahman....Since the scriptures were not explicitly alluded to by the previous aphorism, it might be suspected that an inference alone had been presented ... by the previous aphorism. ... In order to eliminate that doubt, this aphorism says '(Brahman is not known through any other means), since the scriptures are thevalid means of its knowledge'*."



In the above view, Sankara is saying that Brahman cannot be inferred (as the Naiyaayikas do) and can be known only through Sastra. If Sastra isa "compilation of knowledge gained through karma ... and gnana", the knowledge of Brahman would be due to the efforts of the wise or pious and thus qualifies as anumaana or inference. Sankara's teaching is opposed to such a view and is unambiguous that Brahman can only be known through Sruti pramaaNa, which is apaurusheya, not the effort of any person - wise, pious or otherwise.



So, in these references, Sankara's view is opposed to the attributed statement“Scripture (shastra) is not any word of God but compilation of knowledge gained through karma (action or empirical) and gnana (gnosis or thought).”
