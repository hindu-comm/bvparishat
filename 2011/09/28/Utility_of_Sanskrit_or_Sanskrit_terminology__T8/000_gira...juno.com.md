Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



There is a large number Indian scholars of engineering, medicine, natural sciences. They are lovers of Sanskrit. They are trained in English their technical subjects. They feel that Sanskrit scholars always talk about VyAkaraNa, NyAya, Jyotis', KAvyAlankar, religion, philosophy, darshanas and yoga. The technical scholars would like to see utility of Sanskrit extended to their technical areas. If you ask appropriate Sanskrit sanjnya for a English word, ten Sanskrit scholars offer ten different words. We saw this in case of Monotony. I am looking for a single book where all Sanskrit terminology used by ancient Indian scholars in Mathematics, trigonometry is compiled with their modern English counterparts.That will be useful to me. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
