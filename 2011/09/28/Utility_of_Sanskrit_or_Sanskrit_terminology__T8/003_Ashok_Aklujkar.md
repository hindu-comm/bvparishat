In response to Dr. Joshi's post, I was going to provide essentially the same information as Mr. Shrikant Jamadagni has. Prof. Raghuvira's work, as far as I know, is unparalleled. It seems that it did not receive the same publicity or continued support because he belonged to the 'wrong' political party of the time. His untimely death in a car accident was an irreparable loss to scholarship, particularly Lahore-based Aarya-samaaja-nurtured scholarship, which had already suffered because of the partition of India in 1947.

  

None of the links included in Mr. Jamadagni's message worked for me. However, Raghuvira's English-Hindi dictionary should still be available from theInternational Academy of Indian Culture,which Raghuvira's son Dr. Lokesh Chandra, himself an outstanding scholar with a combination of expertises rarely to be found in India, directs.

  

About four years ago I prepared the following bibliographic note for an essay that I hope to send for publication in the near future (some letters with diacritics may come across in strange shapes but the context should enable most of the readers of this list to figure out what they stand for. The sign "+" is meant to indicate authors other than the one at the beginning of the entry, in this case, Raghu Vira):

  

Raghu Vira. 1950 second edn. *A Dictionary of English-Indian Terms of Administration.* + Gupta. Ghanaßyåma Siµha. Nagpur: Lokesh Chandra. for the International Academy of Indian Culture. Sarasvati Vihara Series 23. First edn 1949: from the same publisher as vol 7 of the same series.

See Raghu Vira 1951.

Nagpur: International Academy of Indian Culture, Earlier edns published under the title *The Great English-Indian Dictionary for Use in the Various Aryan and Dravidian Languages of India and Ceylon* and probably with a different division in parts and physical volumes.

Raghu Vira. 1951. *Hindi-English Dictionary of Technical Terms: Being the Reverse of Our Consolidated English-Indian Dictionary.* Sarasvati Vihara Series 25. \[Nagpur: International Academy of Indian Culture\]. Although the word Hindi is used in the title, this dictionary has a large number of Sanskrit vocables, since technical Hindi draws on Sanskrit heavily.

Raghu Vira. 1952 Supplement. - third edn, rev and enl. *The Consolidated Great English-Indian Dictionary of Technical Terms Pertaining to Accounts and Administration, Anatomy...* Nagpur: International Academy of Indian Culture. + Numerous Scientists and Scholars. An earlier edn 1950 from the same publisher as Sarasvati Vihara Series 19 has as its
full title: *The Consolidated Great English-Indian Dictionary of Technical Terms Pertaining to Accounts and Administration, Anatomy, Bacteriology, Banking, Biochemistry, Botany, Chemistry, Civics, Commerence and Finance, Constitution, Dyes and Colours, Economics, Education, Engineering, Insurance, Law, Mathematics, Medicine, Mineralogy, Newspapers, Optics, Parasitology, Pharmacy, Physics, Physiology, Politics, Radio, Railway, Statistics, Zoology, etc., etc.*

Raghu Vira. 1973. *A Comprehensive English-Hindi Dictionary of Governmental & Educational Words & Phrases.* + numerous scientists and scholars. New Delhi: International Academy of Indian Culture. Sarasvati-Vihara series 35. Earlier edns with the same number of pages, the same title as the 1973 publication and the same publisher are: 1955 published from Nagpur by Lokesh Chandra for the International Academy of Indian Culture (the date and publisher details of this are probably not given on the title pages and seem to have been determined by librarians on the basis of internal indications) and 1966 (specified as the sixth edn) published from New Delhi: International Academy of Indian Culture. From the page extent (189 + 1572), it seems that the 1973 publication is a reprint, perhaps with a rearrangement of the parts, of Raghu Vira 1951, *The Consolidated Great English-Indian Dictionary of Technical Terms ...,* which, in turn, seems to incorporate the other publications listed under Raghu Vira in this section.

[\[1\]](#m_5456835685370713593__ftnref) The date 1934 given in some library catalogues is either a mistake or a date of the prospectus that was issued in preparation of the dictionary. The following entry is found in some library catalgoues: "*An Exhaustive English-Sanskrit Dictionary.* By Prof. Dr. Raghu Vira ... With the collaboration of scientists and scholars. Half a million vocabulary entries of Sanskrit words and phrases pertaining to science, industry, art, literature, etc. \[A prospectus, consisting of specimen pages containing the entries from "A" to "account."\] \[Lahore\], \[1945?\].Æ
