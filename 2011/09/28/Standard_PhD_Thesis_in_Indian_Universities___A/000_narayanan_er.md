Respected Scholars,  
It is interesting to read on the standard of Ph.D Thesis in Indian Universities. I would like to share some of my views, though I don't have much knowledge in this regard. So far as my information goes the language media for presenting any language thesis like Tamil, Punjabi, Urdu etc. will be those languages respectively, but neither in English or in French. I keep my view with Professor Bhattacharya in this regard. I can hardly understand why the Universities in India so much afraid of Sanskrit medium?I heard a story about the King of Cochin, His Holiness Parikshit Raja Rama Varma who failed to pass the exam of the University of Madras in Nyaya, remember, he was an author of Subodhini, a Nyaya work, and many a number of others, who wrote the exam in Sanskrit in typical Nyaya style. It was during British rule. Why he fail, the invigilators withheld his result as they failed to evaluate the content which was in so depth, and reviewed his paper and they made him pass. Let the story be there. Why the students in general who postgraduate Sanskrit from any of the Universities in India are feeling non-confidence in presenting his learnings in Sanskrit? Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Lal Bahadur Shastri University, Sanskrit University, Tirupati, etc. may be the exceptions to all these. Secondly, if some one can produce his learnings in Sanskrit what law makes it to prohibit that medium? I have seen the question papers of some Universities exams give instructions to B.A./M.A Sanskrit students that if you desirous to write in Sanskrit language, you may write it in Devanagari (संस्कृते उत्तराणि देयानि चेत्, देवनागरी लिपिरुपयोक्तव्या). Such things clearly indicate that using Sanskrit medium to get a B.A/M.A degree in Sanskrit is not at all mandatory. How will we preserve Sanskrit among young generations?  
1. Apart from all UGC norms and minimum qualifications, any Sanskrit student should have a learning tendency.  
2. He/She can learn the Vaiyakaranasidhantakaumudi and the Nyayasidhantamukatvali compulsorily but not on any syllabus basis simultaneously with their research documentations.  
3. It will not harm any body if one learns a bit of Vyakarana or Nyaya irrespective of one's topic of research may be Bhagavadgita, Natyashastra or Jyotisha, but I am sure they will feel confident to present their ideas in more authentic manner.  
4. It is not necessary to run behind the methodology of presentation rather than the quality of presentation.  
5. Students who are qualified for doing research should make their mind in understanding Grammar and Logic whether their guides like it or not.  
6. The Sanskrit Professors of different Universities can explain in details about the writing idioms of Gangeshopadhyaya, Kumarilabhatta, Sankaracharya, Abhinavagupta, Banabhatta etc.  
7. It is important to teach how to write commentaries on great old works in idiomatic Sanskrit style of one's own apart from submitting the thesis.  
Such things are easily possible if there is a will. Still there are scopes of maintaining Sanskrit.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
