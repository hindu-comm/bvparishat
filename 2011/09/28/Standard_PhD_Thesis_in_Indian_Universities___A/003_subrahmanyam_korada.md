Standards of Faculty and Research Scholars  
  
What is kAraka ? kriyA !  who said ? Patanjali !  
  
He was to be selected and became a Professor .  
  
90% of the Faculty require Training / Refresher Course in Vyakarana and other Systems .  
  
I conducted a Workshop for both Faculty and Researchers in Vyakarana (all days) and all other Vedangas and Darsanas ( authentic material supplied) - Sanskrit and English with code switching - some other Scholars also helped as Resource Persons .  
  
Free Lodging and Boarding , TA , Rs 500/ for presenting a Paper , six days only .  
  
Some Faculty members and Researchers , including some members of BVP , did not even bother to inform that they were not coming .  
I telephoned and requested some Faculty to come and / or send people but they were not interested .  
  
Today people do not wish to learn , especially after becoming a Faculty -- 'ajarAmaravat prAj\~na.h vidyAmartham ca sAdhayet ' - does not apply to them .  
  
Most of the people from oriental side are not interested in learning English . Occidental side is no better .  
  
If any author wants to publish a book he should write in English with quotations in Sanskrit . Otherwise no Publisher would come forward . KAlagati is like that .  
  
If any University / Institution conducts a Workshop in Vyakarana etc. then one may extend a helping hand .
