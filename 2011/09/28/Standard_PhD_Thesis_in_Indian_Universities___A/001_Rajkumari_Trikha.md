Respected scholars,

It is very encouraging to see that scholars are keen to raise the standard of research. Theoretically it is very attractive. But the publishers are not interested in publishing books written in sanskrit or even related to sanskrit criticism.They say that sanskrit books are sold . Formerly the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan New Delhi used to purchase some copies of books related to sanskrit or written in sanskrit. But unfortunately, now even this practice is discontinued. I wrote a collection of four short sanskrit plays, which deal with the problems of children and suggest their solutions. No publisher wanted to publish it, although my four books are already published by publishers. As I was keen to publish my sanskrit dramas, I myself published it in May 2010. But sorry to point out that book is still waiting for buyers. I gifted it to some scholars and friends. Is it not discouraging for the sanskrit writtings?
