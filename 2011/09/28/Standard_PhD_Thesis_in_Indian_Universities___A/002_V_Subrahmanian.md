Madam,  
  
Your concern is definitely genuine. I think we will have to look for other avenues in this matter. One solution is: make the works available online like by publishing them on a blog and notifying the same in widely visited platforms such as face book, this forum, etc.  
  
Of course, there is the money issue but by publishing in one's blog there is no money involved. Many sanskrit-friendly institutions can also host those works in their websites. Also, in largely circulated journals one can mention the URL of these works. Most people in the present generation, even many who have crossed 60, have access to online resources and are computer-literate. Finally, the real reward for the writer is the satisfaction of the readers whose response, of course, can be solicited through those online resources themselves.  
  
Regards,
