I am sorry. I think you may have to use [gmail.id](http://gmail.id) to access the file. I was able to open it by clicking any of the links in the previous message and it gives option to open or download the file. I could not understand whether you have downloaded and was not able to open the file after it or you cannot open the file in the links given.

  

Anyhow, I have attached a pdf file in another message as mail attachment. There you can download the file and open it. I had used Acrobat X version to create the file.
