Ramayana, new craze among women

There is a new craze among women to learn Ramayana and Mahabharata and  
understand the relevance of the epics in today's materialistic life.  
Women professionals, who are taking up courses or examinations on the  
epics, feel that the contents will be a guiding spirit in their stressed  
lifestyle.  
  
Last year, 365 women, most of them doctors and lawyers, took up the  
examination conducted by Samarpana, an organization run by Sudha  
Paneesh, a social activist. Tulsi Vijaykumar, the wife of a jeweller  
from city, stood first in Mysore and Bangalore centres.  
  
Many may be skeptical about Samarpana's efforts because Ramayana is  
considered a part of Hindu mythology but women who have passed the  
examination refuse to look at it from a religious angle. "For us morals  
of the epic are important," claims Dr Rajani, a medical officer from the  
city who passed the examination last year, describing Ramayana as a way  
of life.  
  
Dr Rajani says that when many aspire to lead a materialistic and highly  
commercialized life, Ramayana comes as a great relief to their disturbed  
minds. Ramayana is a formula of life and one can lead a peaceful life  
with high moral values, she says appreciating Samarpana for making them  
study Ramayana.  
  
UOM teacher Jyothi Shekar says morals of Ramayana are a panacea for all  
the problems of a turbulent mind and learning Ramayana will go a long  
way in leading a peaceful life besides helping them make their children  
aware of moral values.  
  
Sudha Paneesh, who runs the course in alliance with a trust in  
Bangalore, claims nobody will learn Ramayana if it is told and retold.  
The examination format attract them more in addition to making them feel  
that they are involved in a competition. "Our aim is to deduce morals of  
Ramayana and make efforts to apply them to people's lives," she said.  
  
"We are targeting women because they are the teachers in their homes,"  
she said justifying her decision to have the course exclusively for  
women.
