I am not sure what these following replies describing measurement of the distance traveled by asses or mules for the question about the distance covered by a horse/mare which is specific on the word आश्वीन which is described by Panini in a certain rule: अश्वस्यैकाहगमः5-2-19

  

<http://www.avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/sutras/5-2-19.html>

  

*त्रिष्वाश्वीनं*यदश्वेन दिनेनैकेन गम्यते ( २. ८. ४८)

  

Dear sirs, those who replied the question. The question is not how many miles a "yojana" is, but how long the horse could travel per day. Prof. Iyengar has hit the question, as 14 yojana-s and only this has to be supplied with sources of information by him. Hope we could find it from him soon.
