S'riiman!  
  
The discussion is becoming more interesting. First about the query of  
Dr.Aklujkar.  
  
My previous post stands corrected with the exact text below.  
Dhritarastra is talking to Vidura and not Krishna. He is mentioning  
what all gifts he will give Krishna. It is not khara-ratha but with  
ashvatari. The speed of 14 yojana per day is not changing. The text is  
the BORI edition as transliterated by the Japanese.

The last verse mentions that the 'mule-cart' would travel 14 yojana  
per day. In verse 6 above Dhr. mentions horses born in Bahlika. We  
have to conclude that he had both. About how much is a yojana, there  
are different interpretations as already posted by Dr.Narayanan.  
However I like the value given by Stein in his translation of the  
Rajatarangini because he actually measured the distance between  
Srinagar and other places (e.g. Varaahamuula the present day  
Baramulla!) and concluded 1 yojana=6 miles= 9.6 km. Thus 14 Y is about  
135 kms (distance between Bangalore and Mysore). A horse rider may  
travel faster but a cart will slow down.  
  
Ashvatara grammatically may mean 'better than ashva' but somehow this  
word seems to be referring to a cross between a horse and an ass.  
Others may throw more light on this point.  
  
Discussion about what the above means to geography of MBh (Ref:  
Dr.Joshi's stand alone post, which I find it difficult to respond)is  
another matter. Since MB as per tradition is a three layered text  
(Five as per Kosambi and Yardi)we have to agree upon to which layer a  
verse or chapter belongs. For example 84.10 above mentions China. If  
Hastinapura is taken to be the place with the same name in present day  
UP, mule carts and knowledge of China is nothing surprising. Even now  
in Rishikesh mules are quite common and more so in the interior of the  
Himalayas.  
  
Research students looking for Ph.D topics would surely find  
interesting topics in MBh if they are willing to cross the self  
imagined boundaries of Sanskrit departments of our Universities.

\> Respected Sir,  
\> I doubt whether the term khara is for horse or not, but it is for donkey in the Amarakosha, as it says: gardhaba. But at the same time, ashvatara, another meaning (source not known), having ashva with a tarap suffix to have a meaning of "an excellent horse" too. atishayena ashvah asvatarah-dvirvacanavibhajyopapade tarabiyusnau. The Manusmriti too speaks about a khara-cart and an ushtra-cart.

\> Ushtra is for camel, but it is not clear that the kharayanam is for an ass-cart or for a horse-cart. Donkeys too pull carts and as hard as they can till they get exhausted. Now another question is how many miles make a yojana? Some say 8 miles, 4 miles and 5 miles etc. There is dicussion on yojana:<http://www.sizes.com/units/yojana.htm>
