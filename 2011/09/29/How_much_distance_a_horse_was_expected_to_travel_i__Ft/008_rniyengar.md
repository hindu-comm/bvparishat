\> distance covered by a day (by it)). It is supposed by R Iyerngar as 14  
\> Yojana-s. (whatever be the interpretation in modern measurement of  
\> distance). Prof. Aklujkar's question was specific on this point:  
  

Dear Dr.Bhat,  
I did not write that the distance covered by a horse is 14 yojanas,  
nor I have supposed it to be so. I only informed interested members  
that MBh has a verse which may have a bearing on the question raised.
