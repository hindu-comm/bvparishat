 Yojana was not standardized and varied depending on place and time. I find 135 km in a day to be excessive. This would require several changes of both horses and riders in a relay. A single horse with a single rider (who also tires) would not be able to do it.



 There is a reference in the Shalya Parva to Balarama returning from pilgrimage to Sarasvati tirthas just as Bhima was to fight Duryodhana. It is quite detailed as to places he visited. That gives a much more modest estimate.
