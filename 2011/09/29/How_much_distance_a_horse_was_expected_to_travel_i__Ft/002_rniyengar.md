Dear Professor Aklujkar,  
MBh Udyoga Parvan has a statement about speed of 'khara'. This appears  
when Dhritarastra tells Krishna that he (Dhr.) could have sent his  
best 'khara-ratha' which could cover 14 (?) yojanas per day. I am  
travelling and writing from memory. The above figure may need  
correction. Once I am back in Bangalore, I will be able to post the  
exact verse.

regards

RN Iyengar
