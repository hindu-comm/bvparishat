I have asked this question on another list but have so far not received a response. It is also a question in which someone's chance recollection of having come across a relevant passage in a text might help. That is why I am reposting the query here a slightly longer version.

The larger Sanskrit-English dictionaries give aa;sviina as a measurement of distance: 'distance traveled by a horse, that is, by a horse-rider, in one day.' Saaya.na in his commentary of Pa;nca-vi.m;[sa-braahma.na](http://sa-braahma.na) clarifies that a twenty-four hour day, ahoraatra, is meant in this context. Has anyone come across a statement expressing ancient understanding, especially ancient Indian understanding, of how much distance (kro;sa, yojana?) a horse/mare being normally ridden covered, assuming that the horse/mare did not stop?

(In actual practice, a horse/mare could have been changed at certain stops, but this possibility is obviously to be ignored in associating a distance with aa;sviina.)

Perhaps texts on horse science (ascribed to Nakula et al), which are not available to me locally, will help.

aa;sviina must be a measurement word like hasta or dhanus, where an ordinary language word is associated with a particular number and position in a system/scale of measurement.
