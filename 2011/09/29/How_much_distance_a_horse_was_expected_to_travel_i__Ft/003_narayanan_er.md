Respected Sir,

I doubt whether the term khara is for horse or not, but it is for donkey in the Amarakosha, as it says: gardhaba. But at the same time, ashvatara, another meaning (source not known), having ashva with a tarap suffix to have a meaning of "an excellent horse" too. atishayena ashvah asvatarah-dvirvacanavibhajyopapade tarabiyusnau. The Manusmriti too speaks about a khara-cart and an ushtra-cart.  

उष्ट्रयानं समारुह्य खरयानं तु कामतः।  

स्नात्वा तु विप्रो दिग्वासाः प्राणायामेन शुध्यति।। (मनुस्मृतिः११.२०१)

Ushtra is for camel, but it is not clear that the kharayanam is for an ass-cart or for a horse-cart. Donkeys too pull carts and as hard as they can till they get exhausted. Now another question is how many miles make a yojana? Some say 8 miles, 4 miles and 5 miles etc. There is dicussion on yojana:

<http://www.sizes.com/units/yojana.htm>

In India, at least as early as 4th century bce – 20^(th) century, a unit of itinerant distance.

The *Arthaśāstra*¹ (4th century bce) says that 1 *yojana* = 4 *gorutas*; 1 *goruta* = 1000 *dhanus*; 1 *dhanu* = 96 *angulas*. Taking the *angula* as ¾ inch makes the *yojana* about 4.54 statute miles. During the colonial period the British administration set the *yojana* at 5 miles; however, this seems to be smaller than its usual value. The ancient commentator on the *Arthaśāstra* says the *goruta* is 2000 *dhanus*, which would make the *yojana* about 9 miles.  

  

Regards,
