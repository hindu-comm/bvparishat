I am sorry. I just mentioned your above reference as proposed by you if I am not mistaken. The mention of 14 yojana-s in your quotation from MBh is clear reference to the mule-cart driven अश्वतरी. while the question raised is the path or distance denoted by आश्वीन (the way/distance that can be covered in a day by a horse - cart strictly not included in the rule of Panini). Now the difference between अश्व
and अश्वतर has already been explained in my post. Now the the difference ignored, or maintained. If the same is applied to अश्व it would be more or less the same, making a few yojana-s difference if any. This is left to just assessment of the usage of the word आश्वीन whether it maintains the difference or ignores the difference. It may be approximately 14 yojana-s as per the above quotation. The word is used as adjective and probably as a measurement (according to different interpretations of the सूत्र and lexicons). Prof. Aklujkar is there to decide upon the issue.

  

Thanks for your providing the source. This may be helpful in solving the issue to some extent. Prof. Aklujkar was looking for this or similar statement in respect of अश्व. अश्वतर hybrid of horse is inferior toअश्व the pure genie of horse. That is why it is called अश्वतर. Whether it makes difference between mare or horse and how much it differ from the अश्वतरी is a different question to arrive at the precise conclusion about the distance denoted by the word आश्वीन.
