I don't think it is the case. According to Panini, the reverse is the case:

  

5-3-90 कासूगोणीभ्यां ष्टरच् ।

5-3-91 वत्सोक्षाश्वर्षभेभ्यश्च तनुत्वे । 

  

This is the explanation given in काशिका for the word -

  
अश्वतरः।अश्वेन अश्वायाम् उत्पन्नो ऽ श्वः , तस्य तनुत्वम् अन्यपितृकता।  

  

It is not the comparative suffix तरप् which is used only for the comparison of qualities endowed by the two nouns qualified by the adjective, but a different one as explained above and the suffix is used to show the inferiority of its genre. The difference between अश्व and अश्वतर is finely brought out as applicable to the suffix related to its derivation .

  

Hope this settles the matter. Now the remaining thing is to see how long the distance is conveyed by the word आश्वीन means as derived by Panini "अश्वस्यैकाहगमः" (=the suffix खञ् added to the word अश्व to denote the distance covered by a day (by it)). It is supposed by R Iyerngar as 14 Yojana-s. (whatever be the interpretation in modern measurement of distance). Prof. Aklujkar's question was specific on this point:

  

  

> The larger Sanskrit-English dictionaries give aa;sviina as a > measurement of distance: 'distance traveled by a horse, that is, by a > horse-rider, in one day.' Saaya.na in his commentary of > Pa;nca-vi.m;[sa-braahma.na](http://sa-braahma.na/)clarifies that a > twenty-four hour day, ahoraatra, is meant in this context.

The commentators on this rule are silent on the question, probably they might not have considered it as relevant or important. Mahabhashya has to be checked. In any case, it seems to be used as adjective qualifying
the path or road covered by the horse as interpreted by Amara as वर्त्म than any specific distance like "goruta"m "hasta" etc. This may be the reason why commentators are silent on the specific distance denoted by it.

  

Anyhow, it needs to be supported by such an interpretation denoting any specific distance.
