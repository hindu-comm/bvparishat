Dear Sanjeevkumar,  
  
The concept of Seva, service, has several dimensions in our culture. It can take several forms like Guru seva, rAShtra seva, samaja seva, seva to one's family, to one's religion and finally to one's own self: Atma seva aimed at emancipation.  
  
In all these the one common thread is: effacing one's pseudo self: ahankara. The beauty of this concept of seva is that while a man is enjoined upon to consciously undertake all of these types in life, they all contribute to his ultimate emancipation: overcoming the pseudo self, the ahankara, and realizing his true self: Atman, leading him to mokSha.  
  
तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया of the Bhagavadgita is an example for Guru/Acharya seva.  
  
देवान् भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः is again a teaching of the Gita for the seva of the Deva-s through the pancha maha yajnas which are aimed at serving the deva-s, rShis, pitRs, humans and all other living beings in the cosmos.   
  
मातृदेवो भव पितृदेवो भव आचार्यदेवो भव is a Vedic teaching aimed at serving the parents and the Acharya.  
  
The injunction to 'give', 'daanam' to satpAtra is again seva aimed at the various elements in society.  
  
स्वाध्यायोऽध्येतव्यः is aimed at Veda seva, coming under Rshi yajna. A small booklet brought out by a disciple of Swami Dayananda Saraswati on 'Daanam' as part of their AIM for Seva movement is worth reading.
