Dear Pravesh Vyas,

One of the example for anumAna given in NyAyadarSana is, the inference of starting the rain shortly on seeing the ants' carrying their eggs. Even though this is not of calamity, it is related remotely to your research, I think.(This inference is refuted in NyAyasUtra 2.1.37, as pUrvapaks.a. But in the very next sUtra it is justified).
