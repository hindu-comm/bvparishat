in ancient India our Rishis (scientists) discussed upon very field of  
knowledge. they explained reasons behind every action in this world.  
Even about the natural disasters, which causes huge damage. So that's  
y they said that - " न असांवत्सरिके देशे वस्तव्यं भूतिमिच्छता" if  
there is no सांवत्सरिक(a man who knows all three part of jyotish very  
well, specially samhitaa), u should not live at that place. By deep  
studying of the nature, they found more then 20 methods, by which a  
man can know if a disaster is coming to that place. Even at this time,  
when technology is going beyond the imaginations. still there is no  
method of predicting natural disasters.  
there is a one very  
intresting method explained in our samhitaa books (like बृहत्संहिता,  
नारद संहिता, भद्रबाहु संहिता, अद्भुतसागर) also in ancient epics like  
mahabhaarata, Ramayana, in all puranas and in litrature of kalidasha  
magha etc. they all discribe the abnormal animal behaviour before  
anything is happening bad in the area. like rain of birds, raptiles -  
सरीसृपा जलचराः पक्षिणो द्विपदास्तथा \|  
वर्षमाणा जलधारात् तदाख्यान्ति महाभयम् \|\|

The birds were found Monday along Louisiana Highway 1, about 300 miles  
south of Beebe, Ark., where more than 3,000 blackbirds fell from the  
sky three days earlier. Authorities say examinations showed those  
birds suffered internal injuries that formed deadly blood clots.
