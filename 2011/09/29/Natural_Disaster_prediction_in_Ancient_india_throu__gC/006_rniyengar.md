Dear Sri Vyas,  
  
All ancient cultures observed natural disasters such as earthquakes  
and attempted to trace precursors for their occurrence. Animal  
behaviour is one among these 'Omens'. However it would be premature to  
claim that these omens can be used by governments for evacuating  
people from cities where earthquakes are supposed to occur in the  
'next 2-3 days'. Prediction to be practically applicable has to  
satisfy certain requirements of verifiable cause-effect (kaarya-  
kaaraNa)relations and/or statistically significant correlations. For a  
simple presentation one can read  
  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_prediction>  
  
There have been failed predictions based on anomalous animal behaviour  
and planetary alignments. Wrong prediction of earthquakes will be too  
costly for the society to withstand. A few years back a person from  
Chennai claimed an earthqauke will occur in the north-east region. It  
was widely covered on national-TV. Govts were alerted and people  
panciked. Nothing happened and people lost belief in such omen-  
mongers.

"...He claimed that the alignment of the sun, moon and Mercury on that  
day is similar to the one that existed on Aug 15, 1950, when the last  
mega earthquake with a magnitude of 8.5 on the Richter scale claimed  
thousands of lives in Assam, besides causing vast change to the  
topography of the state."  
  
Ancient planetary alignments and occurence of events if recorded will  
help us in dating such events. This is very valuable for progress of  
knowledge. But to say every such planetary alignment (or animal  
behaviour) will cause a disaster is unproven. One has to apply  
principles of Nyaayashastra (vyaapti, avyaapti, ativyaapti,..)very  
rigorously before proposing predictors for natural events.  
  
Ancient literature indeed gives many valuable description about  
natural events and disasters and how Indian culture has been affected  
by these. This information is certainly valuable in understanding  
history of scientific devlopments in India.
