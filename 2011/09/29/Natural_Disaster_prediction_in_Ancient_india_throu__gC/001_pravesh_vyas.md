I've collected more then 200 shlokas like this types in our samhitaa  
books and Ramayan and also  
related modern evidances in the world. Our ancient scholars studied  
the nature of almost all available animals to dogs, cats, aunts,  
piegon, rats, crow, deers, jakal, cow, almost all famous CREATURES we  
see around us. its a gret discovery, even now scientists accepted  
abnormal animal behaviour as the only available method of predicting  
disaster and they are getting almost same results which explained by  
our scholars.  
If somebody is intrested i have made a very beautiful  
power point presentation related to the topic. And also i request to  
all the scholars if they find something about this topic in vedas or  
in other literature plz inform me.- 09868990044, new delhi
