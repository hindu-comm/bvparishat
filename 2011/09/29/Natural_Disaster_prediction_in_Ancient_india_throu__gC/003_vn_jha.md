Dear friends,

I had launched a **Journal of Indian Intellectual Traditions** from the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, University of Pune. Fortunately, it is continuing. If you have well-documented research articles on any aspect of Indian wisdom you can contribute to that Journal. Your findings will be known to the whole world.



For details please contact the Director of the Centre on the following id :
