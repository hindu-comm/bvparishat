Dear Dr,Shrisha Rao,



Thanks for your interpretation of lines of Rajatarangini. However I have problem in accepting "Kauravas were wiped out in the war itself". Both Kauravas (sons of Dritarashtra) and Pandavas (son of Pandu) belonged to the Kuru dynasty (neglecting the fact that they were descendants of Kris'Na DvaipAyana (VyAsa) and not of Kuru Shantanu, (See my posting on Gotra Vaiyaghrapadya of Kauravas and Pandavas). BhIs'ma was Kuru being son of Shantanu. VAhlikas were kurus. People from Uttara Kurus were related to Kurus. There is another problem----in the known history of the world, royal dynasties outside of the subcontinent had names of Kurus and Kambojas. In Mahabharat battle Kambojapati SudakshiNa was on Kaurava side. In the known history Ashoka's inscription in Afghanistan mentioned Kambojas living in Afghanistan while no mention of Kambojas at that time within the sucontinent. In the book, " Studies in the Historical Geography of Ancient India," (pages 290 with full of PuraNika references) by the author O.P. Bharadvaja, there is no mention of Kambojas in the whole book. Vahlikas ( BactrianKurus), Madras, Kambojas were fighting Alexander in the land called now Afghanistan. Political power to fight invasion arose from Magadha, the so called VrAtyAs outside of pure Kuru-Bharata lineage (see O.P. Bharadwaja). You have mentioned Kshemaka as the last descendant of Pandavas. It may be within the subcontinent. And last question-what happened to the step brother of Janamejaya who was standing behind him in the court of Parikshita? How do we know what family name he carried further? Please express your opinions so that we can move frontier of research further. Thanks.N.R.Joshi.

\> Respected Sir,  
\> The term kali in Sanskrit is used to indicate battle. Kali is an era too, for a period of 432000 years.  
\> The Rajatarangini says: The kins of Kuru and Pandu were born after 653 years past of the Kali era.  
\> शतेषु षट्सु सार्द्धेषु त्र्यधिकेषु च भूतले।  
\> कलेर्गतेषु वर्षाणामभवन् कुरुपाण्डवाः॥ (The Rajatarangini.1.51).  
  
I am not sure that is the meaning; it is quite well known and established that the Pandavas existed in the द्वापर, while the Kauravas were wiped out in the war itself, dated at 3138 BCE, the Pandavas departed at the start of the कलियुग, 36 years later in 3102 BCE.  
  
This verse seems to say that the race of the Kurus/Pandavas existed for 653 years of the Kali era.  
  
It can be related to the following, from the महाभारततात्पर्यनिर्णय of Madhva (I haven't looked up the original reference in the महाभारत, but it should be there somewhere, esp. in the Southern text):  
  
तमाह भगवान् कृष्णो यावत् पाण्डवसन्ततिः \|  
तावन्न ते भवेच्छक्तिः प्रवृत्तस्यापि भूतळे \|\| ३०.४२ \|\|  
  
पाण्डवेभ्यः परं यावत् क्षेमकः क्रमवर्द्धिता \|  
क्षेमकात् परतः पूर्तिं शक्तिस्ते यास्यति ध्रुवम् \|\| ३०.४३ \|\|  
  
Here Kali is addressed saying that as long as the descendants of the Pandavas exist in the world, he, Kali, would not have (full) strength though he would be in action (for it is his age). His strength would gradually increase, and upon the end of the Pandava dynasty after Kshemaka (the final descendant of Parikshit, Janamejaya, etc., who died without leaving a successor), Kali would certainly gain full strength.  
  
Thus, we may infer that the first 653 years of the Kali Yuga were benign, when the full power of evil had not taken hold.

\> So, it nears the year of battle. But there should be a kalidinasankhyaa of the start of the battle. Could it be traced from the Mahabharata?

\> Respected Scholars,  
\>  
\> I have a little query regarding background of the ancient text of the sacred Gita. It is widely known the Gita is actually a part of Mahabharata consisting of the teachings of Shri Krishna to Arjuna before the battle of Kurukshetra. Gradually, with time, the Gita began to be considered a separate text from the Mahabharata.  
\>   
\> I would like to know the time period from when this change took place and gained prominence. I would also like to know where this convention, of considering the Gita as a separate text, was practiced in the early stages. Was there any sort of contribution of any philosophical school or any particular sect of Hinduism to this particular occurrence? Was it patronised by any ruler/dynasty during that period when the change took place??  
\>   
\> I would like to know if anyone has ever worked on this topic. I would also like to know some books/links which can provide me with information regarding this topic.
