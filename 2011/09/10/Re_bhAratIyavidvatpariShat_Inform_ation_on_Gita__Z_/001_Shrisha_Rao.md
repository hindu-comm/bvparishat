\> Dear Dr,Shrisha Rao,  
\>  
\> Thanks for your interpretation of lines of Rajatarangini. However I have problem in accepting "Kauravas were wiped out in the war itself". Both Kauravas (sons of Dritarashtra) and Pandavas (son of Pandu) belonged to the Kuru dynasty

This is quite well known, of course. It is indeed the basis for the maxim सन्तानबीजं कुरुपाण्डवानाम् which is also called the कुरुपाण्डवन्याय, as a special case of the linguistic principle असाधारण्येन व्यपदेशा भवन्ति (which is also followed in other languages, though not so crisply stated to my knowledge). The Pandavas were called so on account of their special characteristics, whilst their not-so-special cousins were not differentiated and were thus simply known by the name of their lineage. An analogue of the कुरुपाण्डवन्याय is the विप्रवसिष्ठन्याय, where one may say "Vasishtha came accompanied by विप्रs" though Vasistha is also of course himself a विप्र -- the differentiation is not to deny Vasistha his विप्रत्व, but rather to indicate his specialty vis-à-vis ordinary विप्रs.

\> (neglecting the fact that they were descendants of Kris'Na DvaipAyana (VyAsa) and not of Kuru Shantanu, (See my posting on Gotra Vaiyaghrapadya of Kauravas and Pandavas). BhIs'ma was Kuru being son of Shantanu. VAhlikas were kurus. People from Uttara Kurus were related to Kurus.

I am not sure that linguistic matches of names mean that there is actual biological/patronymic lineage. The Chinese have often called themselves "sons of Han" even though most of them are surely not actually descended from the rulers of the Han dynasty (in fact the mainland Chinese, other than the Tibetans and certain other smaller ethnic groups, are sometimes called "Han Chinese"). The name Khan is Mongolian (from Ghenghis Khan, etc.) rather than Islamic, but is now widely, almost solely, used by Muslims -- actual Islamic names are epithets of the Prophet of Islam or of Allah as given in the Koran, or indicate distinction of family lineage (e.g., "Syed" that the family is considered directly descended from the Prophet). However, the name Khan once symbolized the mighty warrior race which conquered everything they sought, and it has become stuck. Likewise, in our own scriptures we read that the Yadava race of Krishna was wiped out in a fratricidal conflict 36 years after the big war (just before the start of Kali Yuga), but there is no shortage of people named Yadav, such as of course many well-known politicians -- though to my knowledge neither they nor anyone else seriously claim descent from Krishna's family.

\> There is another problem----in the known history of the world, royal dynasties outside of the subcontinent had names of Kurus and Kambojas. In Mahabharat battle Kambojapati SudakshiNa was on Kaurava side. In the known history Ashoka's

I would again guess that one has to be careful while reasoning on the basis of names; some historian of the future might be tempted to include India within the dominion of Ghenghis Khan, on the argument that there are so many Khans around!

On the specific question of what were in fact the extents of the kingdoms of the Pandava descendants or any other Kurus there may have been, I have no specific information, but you may wish to contact Bannanje Govindacharya of Udupi (perhaps other BVP members may know how to reach him). He has done some research in this regard, and I believe it is his view (though I do not know the literary or other basis for it), for instance, that Parikshit and Janamejaya had quite large empires, with actual rule or vassal relationships extending into present-day China, Russia, etc., and that their successors' gradually got smaller and smaller.

Regards,

Shrisha Rao
