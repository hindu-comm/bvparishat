There are yet more अव्यय-s used as independent words,

  

चस्त्वर्थे, हिः प्रसिद्धौ, तुर्व्यतिरेकं सूचयति, अपिरेवकारार्थः, अपिस्त्वर्थे, अपिर्विरोधे etc. profusely used in the commentaries. But with sentences it is rare "तत्त्वमसिना" could be formed some times, or "तत्त्वमस्यादिलक्ष्यम्" in compound. But it has to be admitted as special cases. a

  

Thanks for providing some more examples.
