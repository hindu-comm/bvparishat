Sir



What is the intent? If it is a genuine difficulty in usage, something along the lines of अन्यच्चेति गद्यकाव्यं कृतमचार्येण राधावल्लभेन and then continuing withthe pronoun, तस्मिन् etc. would make the meaning clear to the reader / listener.Or other constructs with some ambiguity such as अन्यच्चाख्यगद्यकाव्ये might be employed.



If the intent is to compose some poetry or a sentence with pun, the limits of grammar could be stretched, I guess. Poets use word forms and pandits explain them!



If the intent is to know what grammar sanctions, or rather whatvyaakaraNa does not qualify as an apaSabda,I thought, as in the case of Dittha being fixed as the name of a bull, it is the wish of the speaker as to what name he would choose, and once such a san\~jnaa is chosen, it simply takes sup affixes like any other nominal base. That is, अन्यच्चे is quite okay - as far as reckoning of Sabdas as differentiated from apaSabdas goes. That thelistener is confused about the intent of the speaker, upon hearing अन्यच्चे,is an altogetherdifferent matter.
