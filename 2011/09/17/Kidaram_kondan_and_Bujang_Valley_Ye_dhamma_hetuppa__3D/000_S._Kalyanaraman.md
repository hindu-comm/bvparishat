Speaking after their recent presentations on Bujang Valley in Kuala Lumpur in July, some Indian scholars note the important role that Bujang Valley in Kedah, Malaysia, played in the spread of Buddhism, Hinduism and the Pallava Grantha script in the region.

Trade and commerce between medieval Tamil and Malay rulers were discussed at a recent meet in Malaysia.

The relationship that existed between the Bujang Valley in the present-day Malaysia and the Pallava and the Chola kingdoms in Tamil Nadu from 5th century Common Era (CE) to 12th century CE came under the spotlight at a recent conference on ‘Bujang Valley and Early Civilisations in South-East Asia,' held at Kuala Lumpur.

The conference was jointly organised by the CGAR, Universiti Sains, Malaysia and the Department of National Heritage, with Prof. Mokhtar Saidin, director, Centre for Global Archaeological Research (CGAR), Malaysia, playing a vital role.

The Bujang Valley was originally called Kadaram (Kedah) and formed part of the larger territory of the then Sri Vijaya kingdom. Meaning the Snake Valley, it is located in the north-western part of Malaysia and is its richest archaeological complex.

The Bujang Valley was an important centre of the Buddhist-Hindu polity. It was an entry port for maritime trade with India, China and Persia. Captain James Low first identified the Bujang Valley civilisation in 1840 after discovering many temples there. He found “undoubted relics of a Hindoo colony, with ruins of temples” and “mutilated images” extending “along the talus of the Kedda mountain Jerrei.” According to R. Nagaswamy, former director, Tamil Nadu Archaeological Department, the recent excavations in Sungai Batu sites in the valley not only confirmed that it was a centre of maritime trade in South-East Asia but played a significant role in the spread of Buddhism, the Pallava Grantha script and Hinduism in the region.

A recent discovery in the Sungai Batu site is a stone inscription in Pallava Grantha script that reads, ‘*Ye dhamma hetuppabhava tesam hetum tathagato aha… avam vadhi maha samano*.' It refers to a Buddhist doctrine. Other discoveries included remnants of a furnace for smelting iron ore, thousands of bricks and more importantly, the remains of a stupa.

Both Dr. Nagaswamy and V. Selvakumar, another invitee to the conference, asserted that the discovery of the inscription in Pallava Grantha script demonstrated that the people of the Bujang Valley had adopted the Pallava script and it established the then Tamil country's contact with the Valley.

Dr. Selvakumar, assistant professor, Department of Epigraphy and Archaeology, Tamil University, Thanjavur, said that not only the Valley but the entire area had contacts with Medieval Tamil country.

**The Chola connection**

Both Raja Raja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola had established maritime contacts with the Sri Vijaya kingdom. But Rajendra Chola, during an overseas expedition, conquered Kadaram and captured its king, Sri Mara Vijoyatunga Varman.

The next significant find, at a place called Takua Pa, just above the Valley, is an 8th century CE inscription in Tamil of the Pallava king Nandivarman II with his title ‘Avani Naranan.' It refers to a merchants' guild, trading in gems that had left from Manigramam, a village near Poompuhar, to Bujang Valley. The idol and the inscriptions in Tamil are still there at Takua Pa in present-day Thailand. Takua Pa was the first port of call for the South Indian merchants. The Bujang Valley, a little south of Takua Pa, was the next important port of call. Sri Vijaya's king, Sri Mara Vijayotunga Varman, sent an embassy from Kedah to Raja Raja Chola, requesting him permission to build a Buddha Vihara near Nagapattinam in the name of his father Sri Chulamani Varman. Raja Raja Chola permitted him to build a Buddha vihara and gifted wealth and a village called Anaimangalam, near Nagapattinam, in 1006 CE, for the vihara.

"This is recorded in Raja Raja Chola's copper charter called Anaimangalam grant, now preserved in the Leyden Museum in Holland. So it is called the Leyden Grants," said Dr. Nagaswamy.

There were friendly relations between the two kings, and Vimalan Agatheesvaran, an ambassador from Sri Mara Vijayotunga Varman, gifted lamps, silver kalasams and plates to theKayarohana Siva temple, near Nagapattinam. An inscription in Tamil is still available here. Another inscription talks about Kuruthan Kesavan, a chief officer of the king of Kadaram, consecrating an ‘Ardhanarisvara' and gifting Chinese gold (‘Cheena kanagam') to the same Kayarohana temple. “Raja Raja Chola had a wonderful foreign policy. He forged friendly relations with the countries of South-East Asia,” said Dr. Nagaswamy. However, misunderstandings arose between Rajendra Chola and Sri Mara Vijayotunga Varman. Rajendra Chola, in response, sent a naval fleet to Takua Pa. It captured Kadaram and also the king, and brought back as war trophy the ‘vidhyadhara thorana' (the entrance arch). Dr. Nagaswamy said, “Obviously, the battle spread from Takua Pa down south. Future excavations in the Bujang Valley will surely unveil both the friendly contacts and rivalry between the Cholas and the Kadaram kings.”

In his paper, Dr. Singaravelu Sachithanantham, Professor Emeritus (Indian Studies), University of Malaya, said the discovery of iron ore-smelting industry at Sungai Bata would seem to support and confirm certain information found in the Tamil literary works of contemporary and later times. Dr. Sachithanantham said: “For example, the Tamil poem ‘Pattinappalai' (line 191) of the Sangam period refers to the import of ‘kazhakaththu akam' (the produce of kazhakam) at the sea port of Pukar or Kaveripoompattinam.

**Point to note**

While the temple at Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajendra Chola, has been declared a World Heritage Monument by UNESCO, the remains of his palace in the nearby Maligai Medu has not been protected. “It should be protected and converted into an indoor exhibition,” said Dr. Selvakumar.

## EVIDENCE FOR IRON SMELTING DISCOVERED IN MALAYSIA

March 5th, 2009  
noelbynaturePosted in[Malaysia](http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/category/archaeology-in-malaysia/ "View all posts in Malaysia")\|[7 Comments »](http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2009/03/05/evidence-iron-smelting-discovered-malaysia/#comments "Comment on Evidence for iron smelting discovered in Malaysia")

New discoveries from the[Bujang Valley](http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/10/19/an-archaeological-region-older-than-angkor-wat/), an hour away from Penang. While the news seems to stress on the 300 CE date of the Bujang Valley complex, this news isn’t actually new – what is significant about the find is the presence of apparently non-religious structures, particularly one used for metalworking. Until now, there has been little evidence for local metalworking in Malaysia for this period. This current investigation is part of a larger project to turn the bujang Valley into a heritage park. Oh, and there’s been a name change: the Centre for Archaeology Research, Malaysia is now the Global Centre for Archaeology Research.

When the British acquired the island of Penang from the Sultan of Kedah, they probably did not realise that they were just 40km away from ancient settlement that once also was a port of call for traders entering the Malacca Strait. The settlement in the Bujang Valley dates as far back as the 5th century, and as I was in Penang the couple weeks ago to see my supervisor, it was impossible to not make a side trip to one of Malaysia’s most underrated archaeological sites.

![Candi Bukit Batu Pahat](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/zChNA7qSg-bXZ-N8sn4iB-LQs8QoYO-pOH8G5fAL8py91Jj7JGk_Bfxd1wLR5Ef08keXJa3gKWszi0KPpoz2TOELcon00J2D4SVwl4y7zLWI_EYLfWoa597OlzSUsQ=s0-d-e1-ft#http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i290/noelbynature/seaarch/bujangruins.jpg "Candi Bukit Batu Pahat")

  
**The many names of the Bujang Valley**  
The Bujang Valley rests at the foot of Gunung (Mount) Jerai, a major navigational landmark for ships coming from India. For sailors traveling from India without hugging the coast Gunung Jerai would have been a welcome sight after sailing for weeks without seeing any land. At various times in history the Indians knew the kingdom as Kalagam (according to a 2nd century Tamil poem), and later on Kadaram or Kataha. The Chinese Monk I-Tsing (I-Ching) who traveled to India in the 7th century to visit the University of Nalanda would have known Bujang Valley at Qie-zha (sometimes spelled Chieh-Cha or Kie-tcha). Arab traders knew of the same place as Kalah or Kalahbar.

![Bujang Valley, facing NE](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/oNv9NkOhiBO5NqZdJ7ypUXgco-o9gVLCGHYnSSzAEfhcli-w_V5chV_5T5c2yIQ73Ts0EuWJZMJ6XpEXr8mf4QA9TdmSDCQqV6FX3fQ5CPMOIxun4rHb_SdAAuuaF3U=s0-d-e1-ft#http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i290/noelbynature/seaarch/bujangvalley.jpg "Bujang Valley, facing NE")

Bujang Valley today, facing approximately North-east. Notice Gunung Jerai in the background.

**Buddhist and Hindu influences**  
The Bujang Valley was surveyed in the 1930s by Quartritch Wales, who found some 30 sites in the area (some 50 sites have been found to date). In particular, the area known as Sungei Mas, which would have been a logical place for landfall, yielded a number of trade artefacts and Buddhist monuments. It seems that kingdom at Bujang Valley between the 5th and 11th centuries was Buddhist, and then later on became Hindu. This shift if religion can be explained by the Chola occupation in the 11th century. The Tamil kingdom mounted a swift attack through the Straits of Malacca, conquering the culturally-significant Kataha, as well as plundering the main ports of Srivijaya. Tamil occupation of Kataha was short, lasting about a century, but the cultural and architectural influences carried on until today. Some of the most significant temples – known as Candi (pronounced Chandi) – that populate the valley have a distinct South Indian influence.

**Candi Bukit Batu Pahat**  
The centrepiece at the Bujang Valley archaeological museum is Candi Bukit Batu Pahat, which was built around the 11th and 12th century – contemporary to Angkor Wat. The candi was made from granite quarried nearby and overlooks the valley from its high point.

![Candi Bukit Batu Pahat](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/wRq0v3uSTQW3RjDVO-hMzbsMrs1cAobp6FNYvPieXqTye7NuerCbyeXwDgwU2-xMRphKgiL_x4VzsDDLGlfQeVtPHMVmxMBG5OuXztOoKrEca5DJroIytJn5FrdtzPNtdKEYQSWY=s0-d-e1-ft#http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i290/noelbynature/seaarch/CandiBukitBatuPahat.jpg "Candi Bukit Batu Pahat")

The candi retains the Vimana (closed room) and Mandapa (pavilion) template that is typical of Hindu temples. The Vimana would have housed the statue of the deity, and excavations have unearthed stone reliquaries containing semiprecious stones, gold and silver foil relics.

More significantly, Candi Bukit Batu Pahat is a rare example of Hindu temple architecture outside of India. Notice these drains? Worshipers would place their oblations of holy liquids, usually offerings of water and ghee to the deity in the vimana, and collect them as they poured out of the drain to the side. These drains are very rare in Southeast Asia, but common in South India. Typical Indonesian Hindu temples do not have this architectural feature, which suggests that Bujang Valley has a close connection to India, rather than an indigenised form of Hinduism.

How local is the granite from Candi Batu Pahat? A river runs through the grounds of the Bujang Valley Archaeological Museum, and on its banks you can still see the remains of quarried granite blocks that were never used.

**Other reconstructed Candis**  
Because Bujang Valley encompasses a large area, most of the candis exhibited at the museum are reconstructions of the original finds, moved to the vicinity of Candi Bukit Batu Pahat which is the only candi that rests in-situ. This is rather unfortunate, because we have no way of ever knowing if these reconstructions are accurate. I find it interesting to note that some of these reconstructed candi are reminiscent of the structures from the[Cat Tien archaeological site in Vietnam](http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/10/12/the-biggest-linga-and-yoni-in-southeast-asia/)which was discovered in the last decade.

![Candi Pendiat](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Q6FBvrkmhiwjvcIpMeS1HOxWuL4yNGyskm6a5JYKVZpX7zd8F1G87fr3hg4POBpdt5uxKcgOrTj9un8lScuy70u4gmzixt-4BGBGf5sjbQ-RYjbChlj3dP1-6X_o2U8=s0-d-e1-ft#http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i290/noelbynature/seaarch/CandiPendiat.jpg "Candi Pendiat")

Candi Pendiat is an 11th century structure built of laterite with the Vimana-Mandapa structure. Interestingly enough, a small bronze Buddha was found within it despite the strong Hindu architecture.

![Candi Pengkalan Bujang](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/aCOhoMhxTnrxPR69LphAfRg5ZAE8TIRHl9ig5qcNIsqeQVJAK1Ewd0oBgolRBj-jg5oDuVx8sT17P8QcSjx4aPR4agVJI9H4U8dW9N5_VCbcDiroe6KInQU-RPKfmqA-9Q_FaPULLg=s0-d-e1-ft#http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i290/noelbynature/seaarch/CandiPengkalanBujang.jpg "Candi Pengkalan Bujang")

Candi Pengkalan Bujang has a cruciform shape to it, and a smaller basin-like structure associated with it. It is built of brick.

![Candi Bendang Dalam](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/VLV-RRclGnQGMf1L6E_ToivmzleNaq-A489n6XtUpB3xCtk4MLblaE758T8a9KLBsAopbuR3oZ2IUc2LpYu8zaWMEgR5icfJxGd4V8YScr3T5k4BETVOLOT75CyusfEBiny-hA=s0-d-e1-ft#http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i290/noelbynature/seaarch/CandiBendangDalam.jpg "Candi Bendang Dalam")

Candi Bendang Dalam is another Hindu temple with the now-familiar Vimana-Mandapa format. It is also made of laterite, and here you can clearly see the post holes where the wooden hafts would have been inserted to make pillars.

**Bujang Valley today**  
Like much of non-urban Malaysia, Bujang Valley today is plantation land – either oil palm , rubber or rice. In that sense, perhaps the decision to move the candis from their original sites was a good idea. The distribution of the 50 candis around the Bujang Valley as well as the tropical environment reminds me of how quickly Angkor was overtaken by nature. Perhaps with the right Geographic Information Systems tools, we might one day uncover the urban spawl of the Bujang Valley too?

Bujang Valley from far. Notice the curve of the Merbok river and the opening to the sea. This is where ships would have made landfall.

The grounds of the Bujang Valley Archaeological Museum. Candi Bukit Batu Pahat is the rectangular gray structure on top.Next week, I’ll talk more about the Bujang Valley Archaeological Museum. The Bujang Valley Archaeological Site is about an hour’s drive away from Penang, which is about four hours away from Kuala Lumpur. To get there, take the North-South Highway and exit via the Sungei Patani (North) turnoff. The GPS coordinates for the Bujang Valley Archaeological Museum is 5°44’15.51″N 100°24’49.68″E.
