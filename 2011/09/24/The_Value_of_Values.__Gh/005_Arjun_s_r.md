Dear Respected Dr.S.Ramakrishna Sharma sir,

  

Who are all in this **GROUP** are against corruption only. But, PLEASE answer my few questions.

1)can you please tell me that by posting that types of mail etc in this **GROUP**,what difference will happen to corruption?!?

2)Respected scholars like Dr.Veeranarayana Pandurangiji and some other scholars gave ****REASONS**** why these type of postings should not be here. After that also why again the same **mistake** is going on?!?

3)There are so many ways and GROUPS to protest against corruption. This GROUP is created to share the **precious KNOWLEDGE** and information what we all have.This is the DIGNITY of this GROUP. WHY should we spoil that?!?

  

I think All esteemed members of this GROUP know the exact meaning of that SLOKA of GITA,. This saMgrAma to rescue the Sanskrit wisdom.

We are not saying that fighting against corruption is WRONG.PLEASEdon'tuse this GROUP for that. That is our CONCERN. We must do that outside of this GROUP and we are doing and we will DO always.

Please excuse me,if i have hurt anybody. Any comments are welcome.

  

Regards,

**Arjuna..**
