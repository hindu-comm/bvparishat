Dr. H.N.Bhat,



"-----As remarked by Patanjali, nobody asks the Grammarian to produce words, I will use them like anybody goes to a potter and ask him to make pot for our use.

This was written 2000 years ago and if you do not feel pride in this tradition of Grammar of त्रिमुनि which was written on surveying the Sanskrit Language available at their time, we can also use any word and form a grammar of our own for our language we use as Sanskrit. No body is going to question. Why to ask the sanction of Grammarians of 2000 years ago which is still followed blindly?----"

My comments---This is fine for ordinary use of Sanskrit. But Sanskrit (I do not know which Sanskrit) supposed to produce desired results from Yajnyas through use of her Saadhu words. Does not Patanjali say in order to choose right cow (SthoolPris'ati) in Yajnya knowledge of right grammar is needed. He also says that with right use of Sanskrit, one can achieve Swarga. What about that? And how many grammarians, indian philosophers, AachAryas keep repeating through their pravacanas, and seminars that Sanskrit came from the highest spiritual letter called OM (original Sphota)through the sequence of ParA, PashyantI, MadhyamA and VaikharI. Over thousands of years' history, a kind of aura is created around Sanskrit. That is why ordinary people of India trust the chantings of hindu priests at rituals without knowing meaning and without knowing whether mantras chanted were appropriate or not.My efforts are todecrease this aura. That is why I published the article,"Demystifying Sphota in Sanskrit Semantics". Thanks. N.R.Joshi
