Here is the link where I have posted a paper on the internet.<http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/09/indus-language-and-indus-script.html>

Identification of Indus language and decipherment of Indus script (apart from identification of Soma in Rigveda and IE urheimat) have been subjects of debate for over a century. Meluhha clearly refers to a very expansive interaction area from ca. 3rd millennium BCE spanning Eurasia from Haifa in Israel to Daimabad in India -- across Tigris-Euphrates rivers, Sindhu-Sarasvati rivers and across the maritime Straits of
Hormuz (Persian Gulf).

  

Steering clear of polemics, the objective of the portal is to promote the paradigm change desired by both Witzel and BB Lal in language studies. Hopefully, these studies will help promote methods to delineate ancient historical chronologies, and to correlate ancient languages with pots, pans, inscriptions, glyptics, and other archaeological discoveries.

  

The portal includes all links to the corpus of inscriptions, linguistic and archaeological studies such as those of Lubotsky, Pinault, Kuiper, Emeneau, Cardona, Pinault, Southworth, Witzel, Shivaji Singh (Rigveda), BB Lal, Kazanas (Rigveda), Parpola, Rajesh Rao (Markov model), Massimo Vidale, Lamberg-Karlovsky, Potts, Victor Sarianidi, Kuzmina, Angela Marcantanio (IE linguistics), Mayuresh Kelkar (Proto-vedic theory), Kalyanaraman, Kharakwal (Zinc archaeology), Possehl, Mahadevan, LS Rao (Bhirrana site), Randall Law, Kenoyer, Meadow, Bisht (Dholavira stone inscription), Toshiki Osada (Kanmer site), Possehl, Talageri (Rigveda-Avesta), Danino (Sarasvati river), Salomon (epigraphy), Chakrabarti (metallurgy) -- all resources used to study and decrypt Indus script code (as a cipher problem).

  

The portal attempts to use multi-media methods (including electronic tablets not unlike the ancient tablets of Indus-Sarasvati river basins) now available for internet-based researches and studies.
