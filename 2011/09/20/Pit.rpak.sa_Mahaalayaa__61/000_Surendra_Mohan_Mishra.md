Esteemed Scholars,

  

Namovaakapurassaramidam.

  

This evening one of my friends wanted me to explain to him any apparent scientific cause behind the Mahaalayaa Day being traditionally observed as the final S'raaddha Divasa in the Pit.rpak.sa.I could not adequately answer to his query.

  

I shall be happy if some scholars deliberate on the s'aastra and science behind this tradition we have been observing since ages.

  

Sapras'rayabahumaanam,

bhavadiiya.h

  

SM
