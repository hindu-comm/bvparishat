Respected Sir,  
I request for the entry of the e-mail ID of a retired school teacher in our BVP, who learned Sanskrit Vyakarana and Nyaya about 45 years back under good scholars. He composes verses in quick succession. I hope he will enjoy and contribute good to the group. He is:  
  
Mr. Parameswaran Namboodiri \<[tpan...@gmail.com]()\>  
  
So, please accept his membership.  
  
Regards,  
E. R. Narayanan
