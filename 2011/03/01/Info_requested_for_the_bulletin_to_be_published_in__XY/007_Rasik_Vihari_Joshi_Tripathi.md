Dear Professor Radhavallabha,

With reference to your letter I congratulate you for organizing World Sanskrit Conference in Delhi in collaboration with Paris.Iwould like to aattend it.

1.I have published a Mahakavya entitled “The Universal Truth Satyam” in 2007 in the publication series of Pandit Rampratap Shastri No.32. It has 513 new Sanskrit Verses with English and Hindi translation, Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratisthan, Delhi

2.This Mahakavya has again been published with Spanish translation by the University of Oriente,Cumana, Venezuela 2010.

3.My another Sanskrit Kavya “Radha-Panca-Sati” has been published (Second edition) with English translation by Shree Publishers, New Delhi 2011.

3 My” Yoga-Sutras of Patanjali” will be out this month by Arbol Editorial, Mexico. It includes Spanish translation and my commentary.

4 Currently I am working on Venkatadhvari Dikshita. I have practically completed his most difficult “Laksmi-Sahasram” in English with my commentary in the form of the idea of the poet why he wrote this verse. I may mention that Venkatadhvari is on of the most difficult Sanskrit Poets.

With kind regards,



Rasik Vihari Joshi
