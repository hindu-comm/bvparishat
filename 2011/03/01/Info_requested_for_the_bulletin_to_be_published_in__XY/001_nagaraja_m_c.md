This is to inform that I M.C.NAGARAJA, am working on the ancient Indian veterinary Sciences with special reference to elephants. A thesis has already been submitted in Bengaluru University, Karnataka on the subject for which I am to be awarded a PhD degree. However, I have great interest to explore the veterinary details of other animals too. Zoological aspects of ancient Indian knowledge also attracts me.

Dhanyavad.
