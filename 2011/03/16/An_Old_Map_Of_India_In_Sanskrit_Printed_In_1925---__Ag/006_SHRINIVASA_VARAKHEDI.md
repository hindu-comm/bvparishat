Dear Sir,

The Sanskrit Academy would be happy to publish the book reprinted as  
it is. Thanks for suggestion by Prof. SM Mishraji. I also thank Sri  
iragavarapu narasimhacharya for bringing this to the notice. Sir,  
please send the copy to me by post as soon as possible. I will get it  
reprinted and make it available to the public.

regards,  
shrivara
