for the book to reach you.It is not digitized.Pages by pages I can  
send like this.I am not aware of the modern computer techniques.Glad  
to note our scholar friend Sri Shrivarakhedi Mahodaya came forward to  
get it printed.I am thankful to him.If it is  
printed I want a copy of it.Is it possible? I seek your advice and  
instructions in regard  
to its availability to all of you in an easy way.I await your kind response.
