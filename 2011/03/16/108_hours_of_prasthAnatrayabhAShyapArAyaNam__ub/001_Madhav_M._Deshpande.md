Dear Dr. Sharma,  
  
I hope they will make audio recordings of this Pārāyaṇa available on-  
line. Great effort indeed. I have not come across any audio-  
recordings of the Brahmasūtrabhāṣya on any website, or available in a  
CD format. Would appreciate any information on such recordings, if  
anyone has come across such recordings. This would be useful for  
students reading these texts.  
  
Sincerely,
