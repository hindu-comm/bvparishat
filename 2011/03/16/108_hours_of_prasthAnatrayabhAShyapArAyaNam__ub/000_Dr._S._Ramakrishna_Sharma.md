Dear Scholars,  
  
**108 hours of प्रस्थानत्रयभाष्यपारायणम्** is [a unique program](http://bhashyaparayanam.tripod.com/badrinathprogram.htm)  
organized during last year by the Acharya/Sadhus of Kailasa Ashram at  
Badarinath under the auspices of Bhashya Bhakta Mandali group.  
A few days ago Sri Haribrahmendrananda, one of the acharyas who  
teach the Bhashyas at Uttara Kashi, came to Sringeri and contacted me  
to coordinate similar program at Sringeri Mutt.  
He met the Administrator of Sringeri Mutt and fixed the dates for 2012 Event.  
  
I requested the Swamiji to make the event inclusive for all those who know  
Samskrutam and allow them to follow the reading by keeping the Bhashya Text  
on the Vyasa Peetham and propagate **the Value of Samskrutam as Anushthana  
Bhasha in the context.**  
  
Efforts are on to gather like-minded **Arya-Arsha-Samskruta-Samskriti Bhaktas**  
here in and around Sringeri to commence the pilot reading sessions at the earliest. Enthusiastic  
young research scholars like Sri Vinayaka Rajata Bhatta of **Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan**  
*Rajiv Gandhi Campus*, **Sringeri** and many others have discerned the need of the hour to  
serve the cause of Samskrutam in every possible way.  
धन्यो'स्मि
