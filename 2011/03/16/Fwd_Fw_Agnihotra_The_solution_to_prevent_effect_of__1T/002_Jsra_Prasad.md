Thanks for the useful information that is unknown to me! At SVYASA, Bangalore (www.**svyasa**.org) a parallel kind of research is going on as I heard. It is called 'Yajnopathy'. Dr.Srinivasa Rao may be contacted for more details. But presently he is engaged in the 'gau-grama-pariyojana' project. His email id can be found in the CC column.  
  
With Regards,  
Prasad
