Dear Prof. Joshi, thanks for searching the topic intensively. dhanva, dhanvantari etc. are associated with the sea-shore and responsible for bringing out medicines etc. to the shore. I may refer to RV I.163 ( As'va-sukta-- traditionally attributed to Diirghatamas) which indicates to bringing out a horse or equus animal with golden horns. ( hiranyasrnga). On this basis I came to the conclusion that inhabitants there were bringing out so many items including equus (=as'va). Laterthe animal was dragging the chariot to which the animal was yoked andSaudhanvanas were associated with chariot/ allied subjects with the expansion of the meaning. You may interpret the hymn again to come to a conclusion which may be a new and fresh. But the clue of the RV above must be taken into consideration. Regards, spnarang
