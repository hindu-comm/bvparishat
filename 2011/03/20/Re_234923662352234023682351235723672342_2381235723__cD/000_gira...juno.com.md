Respected scholars, Namaskar!



Meaning of Saudhanvan



(1) Thanks to Dr. Narang, Dr. Surendramohan Mishra, Dr. D. Bhattacharya and Dr. H.N. Bhat for contributing to the thread of discussions on the etymology of animal and insect words ending in -bha. The ending of -bha may indicate a flock. These animals used to stay in flocks in their undomesticated, wild life early stage. Insects (Shalabha) even now come in flocks. However I may be wrong.



(2) I agree with you Prof. Narang--there was contact of the ancient subcontinent people with people from the countries immediately west of the Khyber pass. I felt the same way other scholars felt before me that we need language scholars from areas of Gilgit, Baltisthan, Udyaana, Swat, Chitral, Dardisthan, Kalash, and Kafiristan to contribute to our discussions. Such contributions will expand our horizon of research.



(3) During the discussion Prof Narang referred to the word “Saudhanvan”. He gave meaning as inhabitants of the sea shore bringing out animals from sea. However the meaning of Saudhanvan looks to me like an assembler. He is rathakaara or carpenter who used to assemble the wagon or ratha. This is the meaning given in the book, “The Mimamsa Nyaya-prakash or Aapadevi-English translation by Franklin Edgerton, p.78.There may be difference of social status between ratha-kaara and Sau dhanvan. It was mentioned in the book (Dr. Frit Staal), “Discovering the Vedas’ p.64 that Saudhanvan is the caste of rathakaara. Please enlighten us. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Regards, Gardabha may have relation to khara (bha?). Kharatara is known for mules also and a kaccha is known by that name. Its earlier relation with As'va : which means water and the animals belonging to equus A hymn is found in the RV which shows that saudhanvanas ( inhabitants of the sea-shore had the profession of bringing out such animals from the sea). It is As'va-suukta. Dhenukaasura does not mean an ass but an animal with a horn. Of course, dhenu means a mammal which is preserved in Panjabi as dhyonaa = mammal ( in dhet root and dhaatrii= a lady who feeds the child = jhaaii= mother in panjabi). It may be rhino. The ox in Indua valley has a resemblence with a cow: sthuula and prsatii as found in the Mahabhasya of Patanjali ( sthuulapr.s.attimaalabhet). It may be zebric in character = s'abala. New interpretations and etymologies of the words, if sound, must be accepted. I attended one of the lectures on Aryan invasion and do not agree with all the hypothesis of Kazanas which I expresssed in the lecture. Fresh interpretations of scholars like Parpola and others must be welcomed after close investigations. The relation with ancient countries is less explored. Many of the traditional scholars are reactive to this idea. But the relation of Veda with Iran, Balakh,Kamboja, Afghanistan, Oxus cannot be ruled out. The seat shifted later to saptasindhu. Both the traditions are preserved by the MBH. Regards, spnarang

Respected scholars, Namaskar!



Research has starting point but no end

Etymology of Gardabha,Raasabha and Vris'abha is needed



I do not know who are the staunch supporters in India today of Aryan invasion in connection with the ancient history of India. I have presented evidence here on this list that in the ancient time people were moving from Asia to Europe. The large number of European scholars know that. When European scholars come to give talk in India in big cities, Indian scholars may ask them questions. Dr. Asko Purpola was in India last year receiving award from Karunanidhi. He wrote in the newspaper about wild ass depicted on Indus seal. He raised question about words "Gardhabha", He said that "bha" is Iranian suffix. Wild asses were in Indian salt desert (irina). Balaram killed Denukasura (wild ass) in Palm grove of the salt desert and drank Taadi-palm wine---read his article and ask him questions. When he comes in India talks about Harappan Dravidian language, why did not Indian scholars ask him to talk about the presence of Indo-Aryans in the ancient Finland, his country. Dr. Kazanas gave talk recently in Chennai. According to him there is organic coherence in Sanskrit. Hence the ancient Sanskrit (or Vedic) is very close (the imagined) proto-indo-european.He even questions methodology of the eminent philologist Dr. Burrow. (I like views of Dr. Kazanas on Sanskrit) He also says Mitannis were Indo-Aryans. Flowering of Greek civilization was from 800 BC to 300 BC. So who were in Greece at the time of Trojan war? Why did they help Hittits against invading Greek tribes? I do not know how manyIndian scholarsasked him about the ancient Greece. If you have doubts about your own history, then ask questions to foreign scholars and Indian scholars working in foreign universities to acquire new information. Many scholars are coming to World Sanskrit scholars. So this is good opportunity. Sometimes others may offer reply that makes you happy. Whilesome undertake research for their own purpose because they want to understand more about the ancient Indian culture as described recently by Dr. R.N. Iyengar. I am in the second category.



The problem is not the Aryan invasion in the ancient history of India. It is Sanskrit linguistics/semantics-the origin of Sanskrit and history of Mahabharata.
