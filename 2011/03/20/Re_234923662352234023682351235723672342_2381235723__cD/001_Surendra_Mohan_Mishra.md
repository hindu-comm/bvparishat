Esteemed Scholars,  
  
Words and their ramifications indeed are carriers of history if we can rightly interpret them historically and logically.  
While having doubts about Prof. Joshi's conjecture as to whether the suffixed 'bha' would mean a group or flock always,i may cite yet another such word 'DuDubha'/dDuNDubha' denoting a kind of lizard acc. to M.Williams or a non-poisonous snake acc. to Apte.He quotes some unspecified Kosha(is it from Amara?) ' nirvis'aa.h DuNDubhaa.h sm.rtaa.h'.  
  
In Mauritius when i had occasion to teach for some time i found that all snakes in that small island country are DuNDubha-s.But my ignorance of this fact certainly made me pass one fateful night without sleep in the MGI guest house as one such harmless creature i located entering in to the cable pipe in the room.I was compelled to wake up respected Prof. and Mrs.M.Narasimhachary(now again he is there,i offer my praNAma) asleep in the adjacent room.There one can locate poisonous snakes only in zoos with a fee unlike in our country !  
  
Best regards,  
SMMishra
