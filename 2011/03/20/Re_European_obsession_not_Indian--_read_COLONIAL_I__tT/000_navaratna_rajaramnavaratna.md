 Inthe forthcoming series *A People's History of India,* I (as General Editor) will have a significant section on the evolution of Indian writing, tracing it to the Harappan and pre-Harappan of which a handful of examples are known. It is a fascinating story.



 Also, I strongly recommend Dilip K. Chakravarti's book ***Colonial Indiology*** (Munshiram Manoharlal). It is heavy going but eye opening about how race and language were mixed up right from the start.



 We may safely say there neverwas and there is not now any IE linuistics without racism.
