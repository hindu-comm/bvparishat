**Ferdinand de Saussure ( Course de Linguistique Generale) and Humboldt (On Language ) etc had gone for plagiarism of high standard Philosophy ( sabdanityatva , prakrtipratyayavibhaga etc ) directly from Mahabhasyam and Vakyapadiyam** . I quoted the texts and discussed in my book , viz. Theories of Language : Oriental and Occidental ( Origin and Development of Western Linguistics ) .  
  
This is exclusive of the Vedas etc , which the Europeans got translated by Indian scholars taken to **Germany and later killed on high seas . The wives of some such scholars of East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh were receiving monthly maintenance even during the War .   
**  
**Just an example of the (dur) AcAra of the so called Aryans --  
  
on Radio Berlin (pronounced Berleen) the then leaders , viz Hitler ( = leader of the world ?) , Himmler , Goaring , Gobbels etc. , used to speak thus during 1939 - 1944 -  
  
"Aryans are to rule but not to be ruled , close your eyes to pity , behave brutally .  
  
If France is lost nothing is lost , if Britain is lost cheats are lost , if Germany is lost a great race of Scientists is going to be lost ... "  
**  
The Indo-European Language is a myth invented (not discovered) by the Europeans simply to generate  
**'inferiority complex'**(**AtmanyUnatAbhAva**) in the minds of the then unsuspecting Indians and the English learning people of the early days of British Rule succumbed .**  
  
AtmAnam na avamanyeta !  
**  
They may find another Language that was the origin of IEL and there will be **'anavasthA'** , which is a **Do.sa (defect) . Who to believe ? How is he an authority ?  
**  
As is rightly put by Sri Rajiv Malhotra on Huffpost , the British also used the Aryan Theory to make a devide between North and South Indians thru - **Aryan vs Dravidian .  
**  
Thr same Veda , the same Gods , rites etc are there in the entire country . Then how come there is difference between people of North and South ? It takes volumes to speak .
