Esteemed Scholars,  
This is the exact perception which should inspire Bhaarata to work upon for a few decades with constructive and sustained efforts by replanting the Ideal in the obtaining environment in India and the world.The ubiquitous Indian is a global phenomenon.With material prosperity he/she is greatly looking for his basic roots and moorings.Nothing of the propagandist research by some people in the past or present the truth in distorted light ought to succeed.This as rightly said by Prof. Rajaram is possible by putting forth the Alternative !  
When the opponent is seemingly highly logical in distortions because of vested interests,the proponent who has to safeguard the truth has to be equally and more careful.The path showed by the Gita could be of help :  
saktaa.h karmaNy avidvA.mso yathA kurvanti bhArata;  
kuryAd vidvA.ms tathA 'sakta.s' cikIr.sur lokasa.mgraham.  
Best regards,  
SMMishra
