Dear All,  
Chinmaya International Foundation Shodha Sansthan is happy to welcome you for the following Workshop and Training programme from 18th - 20th March 2011.  
  

**A three days' workshop on**

  

**Preparing Sanskrit Texts Suitable for**

**Computational Research**

  

  

At the emergence of computer science and information technology, the profits of using computers is of immense benefit in the field of languages and that need no more proof. From the very basic usages, like search to complicated tools, computer brings very special effect to the research.

  

In this background Chinmaya International Foundation Shodha Sansthan (CIFSS) has planned to hold a three days' workshop on **Preparing Sanskrit Texts Suitable for Computational Research.** The top contemporary computational linguists will guide the workshop.

  

**Back gound, Structure and Aim**

Sanskrit institutions have prepared large data of Sanskrit texts on computers during the last 15 years. Though they help us to search and process information, a lot of extra effort is needed to get the accurate result. Here is an example

If we search for the word कृषि, using the command \`grep' in Linux/Unix, in a traditional typed text (example, Mahabharata) we get lines like this -

  

कारयन्तः कृषिं गोभिस्तथा वैश्याः क्षिताविह ।

निवृत्तकृषिगोरक्षा विध्वस्तनगराश्रमा ।

भागशो विनिविष्टानि न कृषिर्देवमातृका ॥ ६७॥

कच्चित्ते कृषितन्त्रेषु गोषु पुष्पफलेषु च ।

वैश्याः कृषिं यथान्यायं कारयन्ति नराधिप । (5/44 are shown here)

  

These are lines spread across different Parva-s of Mahabharata. Though we get some information from this output, the reference numbers of these lines/shloka-s are not known. Extra effort is necessary to get the reference of these lines.

The same output from a \`prepared' text is shown below:

01-058-019a कारयन्तः कृषिं गोभिस्तथा वैश्याः क्षिताविह

01-202-024a निवृत्तकृषिगोरक्षा विध्वस्तनगराश्रमा

02-005-067c भागशो विनिविष्टानि न कृषिर्देवमातृका

02-005-106a कच्चित्ते कृषितन्त्रेषु गोषु पुष्पफलेषु च

03-186-100a वैश्याः कृषिं यथान्यायं कारयन्ति नराधिप (This text is encoded by John D. Smith , University of Cambridge.)

  

Here in each line we can see the Parva-Adhyaya-Shloka, first half (a) and second half (c) information.

  

All typed Sanskrit texts need such information. In this regard, CIFSS plans to hold this workshop.

  

**Objectives**

  

1\. Putting meta tags to the typed texts.  
2. Putting reference information in each line.  
  

In this workshop, we will describe the current model of text encoding practices using the extended markup language (XML). The participants will be trained in adding various XML tags in the already existing e-text. These tags will be in accordance with the guidelines prepared by the Text-Encoding Initiative (TEI). In addition the participants will be trained to prepare TEI headers that present metadata such as author, title, editor, publisher, etc..

  

There will also be a demonstration of transforming the XML file for web-display, printing, indexing, etc.

  

Dates: 18-20^(th)March

Computational Aspects of Ashtadhyayi

  

  

Objective : Astadhyayi is an ancient classical text of Sanskrit grammar, authored by Panini. The construction of Astadhyayi and operations defined in it has interesting computational concepts built in it. Astadhyayi also serves as an example for Theory Building in general. This course explores the theory of Astadhyayi from contemporary computational perspective.

  
  

Topics:

1\. Significance of Sutra Technique, SutraSahitya, Vyakhyana Parampara of Astadhyayi, Rationale for Pratyahara technique, Samjnas, utsarga-apavada, paribhasha with example of ac Sandhi) from contemporary mathematical view.

2\. Computational Structure of Astadhyayi (Big Picture of Astadhyayi from Computational perspective, Modeling Operations & Structure)

3\. Operation of Rules & Conflict Resolution (Based on external paribhashas)

4\. Asiddhatva (Asiddhatva as a Filter technique)

5\. Astadhyayi as Model of Theorizing Grammar (Construction of Astadhyayi from language usage as an example of Theory Building, dissection of words into prakriti, partya, Categorization based on 'it')
