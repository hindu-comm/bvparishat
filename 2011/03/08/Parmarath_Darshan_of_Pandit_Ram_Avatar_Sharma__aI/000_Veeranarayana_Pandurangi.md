**Mahamahopadhyaya Pandit Ram Avatar Sharma** (d. 1929) wrote some books like ***Parmarath Darshan*** with which he added a new chapter to the six systems of Hindu philosophy. His views on the Puranas contained in ***The Philosophy of the Puranas*** won him the Buch Metaphysics Award. Another book, ***Chapters from Indian Psychology*** was also hailed as being much ahead of those times.

KHP mentions one artical (not traced) by hari mohan jha "paramartha darashan a revloutionary trend in contemporary indian thoutht" RSV 173-177 ( what is RSV?? )



can anybody help me to trace out where ***Parmarath Darshan** may be availbale. or if anybody has got etext of pdf of that work*

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
