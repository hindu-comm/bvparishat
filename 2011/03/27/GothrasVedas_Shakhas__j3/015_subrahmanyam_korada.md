Gotras - Vedas & SAkhas  
  
During ancient times all the four Vedas were being learnt --  
  
**Manusmr.ti** (3-1,2)-  
  
s.t.trims'adAbdikam caryam gurau traivedike vratam I  
tadardhikam pAdikam vA grahan.Antikameva vA i ( Brahmacaryam for 36/18/9 years) .  
  
vedAnadhItya vedau vA vedam vApi yathAkramam I  
aviplutabrahmacaryo gr.hasthAs'ramamAvaset II  
  
(They used to learn S'Iks.A , VyAkaran.am etc. during AnadhyAyas -  
  
TaittirIyAran.yaka prescribes - during rain , lightening , thundering , AmAvAsyA one should not recite Veda . Manusmr.ti added some more AnadhyAyas . So among Tithis, As.t.amIs, Caturdas'is, PUrn.imA, AmAvAsyA,and Pratipats are AnadhyAyas .  
  
AnadhyAyes.van'gAnyadhIyIta - Dharmas'Astram )  
  
Nowadays , most of the Vedic scholars do know only one Veda .  
  
So , there are S'Akhas - at the end of SandhyAvandana(also while doing 'abhivAda' to an elderly person) a TaittirIya says - .....'yajus's'AkhAdhyAyI subrahman.yas'armA aham bho abhivAdaye' .  
  
One should follow his Vedas'akha and the Gr.hya thereupon strictly . If something is missing then he may borrow from other S'Akha.  
  
In Andhra the marriage , Upanayanam , Abdikam etc is performed as per the Vedas'Akha .  
  
Of late, people here started giv9ng more importance to the Laukikas'Akha , such as - VeginAd.u, VelanAd.u, DrAvid.a, TelagAn.ya etc and forgot the Vedas'Akhas .  
  
Again there are differences among SmArta (AdvaitI) , Vais.n.ava , MAdhva etc in terms of Marriages etc. The problem becomes serious when there is a cross-marriage . The general rule is that the bridegroom's tradition prevails .  
  
There are books in Telugu which are useful in identifying the S'Akha(Laukika) , Gotra, [R.s.is](http://R.s.is) of a Housename .
