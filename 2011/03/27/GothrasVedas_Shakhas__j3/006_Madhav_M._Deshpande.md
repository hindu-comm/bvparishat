Dear Dr. Moharir,  
  
I have only consulted the published volumes of the Peshwa Daftar,  
and I have not seen any reference to the Satyanarayana Puja. Will  
look again and let you know if I find anything. The published  
documents are a miniscule fraction of the unpublished documents.  
There are 56000 bundles of documents preserved in the Peshwa Daftar  
office in Pune, and most have not even been catalogued. I went there  
a few times, but it is very hard to access anything unless you already  
know the location of a document.  
Another source for this kind of puja is to look up the  
Vratakhanda of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi of Hemādri. Will see if I find  
anything there. Best,
