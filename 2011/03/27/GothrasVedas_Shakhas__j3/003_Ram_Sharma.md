We may request Rashtriya SanskRtasaMsthaanam whose campuses are scattered all around the country to organise a national workshop on this burning issue of cultural interest and to authorise a committee representing the various regions concerned to write out a modern GRhyasuutra on this burning issue(a sort of Paramalaghusiddhaantakaumudii)

A similar modern Dharmashaastra has also to be attempted .While I was in SampurNananda SKT Univ ,a committee was formed under the leadership of PaTTabhiramashastri.But nothing concrete could be achieved.But no harm in making fresh efforts.
