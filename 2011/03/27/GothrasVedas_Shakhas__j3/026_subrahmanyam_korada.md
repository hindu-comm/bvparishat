Namo vidvadbhyah  
  
Dr Yadu's questions --  
  
1.'Satyanarayana' is a compound not found in SahasranAma and as such the Vratam was formulated later - Historical evidence ..  
Yes , Satyanarayana is a Karmadharayasamasa .  
Just like Vemkateswara , Daksinamurti etc. it must have come into existence . In sagunopasana it is possible - ekam sat viprA bahudhA vadanti .  
  
2.In Orissa - satyapeera appears in the form of an Old Brahmin at the time of need --  
  
But as the other scholar sugested it might have come thru Hindus who got converted into Muslims . On the other hand , there are other such stories and it is difficult to account for such non-Vedic and non-Puranic stories . You know there are a number of Ramayanas in folk lore .  
  
3.Vindictive nature of the deity - any evidence in Vedic/Puranic Literature to show Vis.n.u was vindictive--  
  
We know that S'rIkr.s.n.a maintained patience for 100 mistakes of S'is'upAla .  
  
He vowed - dharmasamsthApanArthAya sambhavAmi yuge yuge .  
  
In S'AmkarabhAs.yam (VedAnta) there is '[Vais.amyanairghr.n.yAdhikaran.am](http://Vais.amyanairghr.n.yAdhikaran.am)' , which says that it is unfair to attribute 'hatred' or 'cruelty' to Is'vara .  
Many such examples . No deity is vindictive , much less Vis.n.u . Then why such narration ? --  
  
MImAmsAdars'ana (2nd adhyAya) discusses the concept of 'ArthavAda' , i.e. the sentences of 'stuti'  
(commendation) and 'Ninda' (condemnation) , Such sentences are not ot be taken seriously and are meant to generate an urge in the mind of the reader to perform the rite . The sentences you came across may fall under this category .  
In YogAnus'Asana 'titiks.A' ( ks.amA) is taught as a quality .  
'ativAdAn titiks.teta' (one should have patience towards bad criticism)- says Dharmas'Astra ..  
No diety is depicted as vindictive .  
One's foul language would punish him if not retaliated .  
  
4. As per VratakathA, KalAvatI and LIlAvatI performed the Vratam - a simplified way created to do without a priest --  
Strictly speaking , one should learn the PUjAvidhAnam and should not depend upon a Priest . Without AdhikAra in Veda , one can do with S'lokas . For example Navagrahas'lokas .  
  
Women also had had AdhikAra in Veda long ago --  
  
**purA kalpes.u nArIn.Am maunjIbandhanamis.yate I  
adhyApanam ca vedAnAm sAvitrIvacanam tathA II  
**  
But as the time went on there were the problems of 'mAsikadharma' etc . Even today women in families such as ours take rest and be separate from household duties --  
  
pan\~came'hani s'uddhissyAt daive pitre ca karman.i (Dharmas'Astram)- s'uddhi is on fifth day . So VedAdhikAra for women is curtailed .  
  
5.1. SvAdhyAya  
It means 'svas'AkhAdhyAya' - the recitation of R.ks'AkhA/ Yajus's'AkhA etc regularly .  
  
MImAmsA quotes - svAdhyAyo'dhyetavya.h - this is from the second AdhyAya of TaittirIyAran.yakam , popularly known as 'SvAdhyAyabrahman.am' .  
The text that follows - yam yam kratum adhIte tena [tenAsyes.t.am](http://tenAsyes.t.am) bhavati .  
The Niyamas mentioned there --  
during day or night ,one may stand,on the move , sit, lay down , in grAma or aran.ya should do SvAdhyAya .  
AnadhyAyas (when one should not recite) - while it is raining , there is lightening , thundering , gale  
and AmAvAsyA ( if done the Tapas will get burnt) . If one is 'As'uci' he is not eligible .  
  
5.2. sulabhA.h purus.A rAjan satatam priyavAdina.h I apriyasya ca pathyasya vaktA s'otA ca durlabha.h II(udyoga - BhAratam)  
  
Here the word 'purus.a'(person) is used to refer to both men and women (i.e. Lin'ga is avivaks.ita) .  
  
O! king ! there are people who always say good things (things that you certainly like )only . But it is difficult to get a vaktA or s'rotA who pays attention to a thing that is not liked but is good ( in the right path)  
  
There are people who always praise yourself and your hundred sons . But it may not be to your taste if one says - give five villages , after all , to Pan.d.avas ( and avoid a war).  
  
'pathye sati gadArtasya kim [aus.adhanis.evan.am](http://aus.adhanis.evan.am)' ( if one takes food that is suitable to his constitution why medicine even if he got some disease ?  
'pathye'sati gadArtasya kim [aus.adhanis.evan.am](http://aus.adhanis.evan.am)' ( why medicine if one takes unsuitable food and got some disease ?)
