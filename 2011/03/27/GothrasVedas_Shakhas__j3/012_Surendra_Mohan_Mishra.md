I greatly appreciate the spirits with which Prof.R. K. Sharma ji has endorsed the need of having a modern g.rhyasUtra and a dharmas'Astra.It's again gratifying to note that a Vaidika and MImA.msaka of the order of Pt PaTTAbhirAma S'AstrI ji also approved of this.In fact so much time has passed since the last g.rhyasUtra or dharmas'Astra was composed.It's never too late resume it again.This g.rhyas'Astra or dharmas'Astra ought to be in accordance of some s'AkhA.Thus we need many such works to come up in different areas in India and abroad where people of Indian origin are there.But the author must be one that commands the highest honor in the aspects of knowledge and conduct !  
I very well remember,before a few years while in Sagar University during a seminar in the Univ. Guest house,in the night after dinner a discussion was somehow initiated and Prof. Navjivan Rastogi of Lucknow was emphatic that a new dharmas'Astra was long overdue to be written.I tried to comprehend his argument with all respect for the tradition but asked as to who would do this.  
A PaTTAbhirAma could do this,but certainly there is someone or are there many who in good time would come out to take the lead in this direction ! sa sampradAya.h parivardhatA.m na.h /Om .
