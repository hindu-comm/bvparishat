Dear Dr. Moharir,  
  
Here is what I find about the Satyanarayanavrata in  
Mahamahopadhyaya P.V. Kane's History of Dharmashastra:  
  
P. V. Kane, History of Dharmaśāstra, Vol. V, Pt. 1, p. 437, Government  
Oriental Series, Class B, No. 6, Bhandarkar Oriental Research  
Institute, Pune, 1958"  
  
"Satya-Nārāyaṇapūjā-Vrata-Very popular in Bengal and Maharashtra:  
described in Bhaviṣya. (Pratisargaparva) chap. 24-29 ; M. M. Hara  
Prasad Shastri in cat. of mss in the Asiatic Society's Library,  
Calcatta, vol. V. preface p. LXV says that the worship of  
Satyanarayana (ms. No. S570) has a Mahomedan origin. It was originally  
(and even now in many places) called 'Satyapirer puja.' It occurs in  
the Revakhanda of the Skandapurāṇa (Vangavasi ed ) but does not ocour  
in the Venk. Press edition. Vide also JBORS vol XVI. at p. 328 where  
the same scholar says that the Mahomedan custom of offering 'Sirni' to  
Satyapir was adopted by Bengal Hindus as worship of Satyanarayana.  
This is a vrata very popular among lower middle-class people and  
women. Vide I. A. vol 3 pp. 83-85 for stories current in Bengal about  
this Vrata. It is said that Narada was told about this Vrata by Visnu  
himself. On any day a man worships Satyanarayana and offers  
naivedya of 1 1/4' quantity (such as 11/4 śer or maund) of plantains,  
ghee, milk and wheat flour (or rice flour), jaggery or sugar; all  
these to be mixed up for naivedya; performer should listen to the  
stories and partake of the prasada, jāgara with songs, music, dance;  
then people go to their houses; this yields all desired objects;  
stories about a brāhmaṇa who performed this vrata every month, of a  
vendor of wood, of a trader named Sādhu with a ship full of  
merchandise and costly things and his daughter Kalāvatī. In these  
stories Satyanārāyaṇa. is represented as very jealous and vindictive.  
The stories are said to have been taken from Skandapurāṇa, Revā-  
khaṇḍa."  
  
There may be other publications relating to the history of this Vrata,  
but here is what Kane says.  
  
Best wishes,
