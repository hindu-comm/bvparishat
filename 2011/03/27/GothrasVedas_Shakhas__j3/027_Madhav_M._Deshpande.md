Dear Anil Kumar,  
  
To give you a few more sources regarding the disputes concerning  
switching the Śākhās and Sūtras, you may want to consult the important  
treatise by the Late Mahamahopadhyaya Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar:  
Sūtrāntara-parigraha-vicāra. This small work was published by the  
Anandashrama in Pune in 1922. This work tries to answer some of the  
then boiling disputes. The other work is a small treatise composed by  
Kashinatha Vishvanatha Sathe: Sarvārtvijyaprayogasāra, published from  
Wai in Maharashtra in Śake 1837, (publisher: Damodar Lakshman Lele,  
Modavṛtta Mudrālaya). This work also deals with related issues,  
especially the question of whether the Upanayana in one Śākhā entitles  
one to study other Vedas and other ŚĀkhās, or whether one needs a  
separate Upanayana to study each different Veda and Śākhā. The third  
source is an unpublished work by Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar, found in  
manuscripts in Pune, titled: Yājuṣa-hautra-vicāra. This work deals  
with a dispute among Maharashtrian brahmins raging around 1900  
concerning whether a Taittirīya Yajurvedi yajamāna needs to hire a  
Ṛgvedin priest to conduct the hautra portion during a sacrifice, or  
can he hire a Taittirīya Yajurvedi priest to do the hautra function.  
I have an unpublished article dealing with the details of this last  
dispute. If you don't have access to some of these materials, write a  
personal email to me. Perhaps I can give them to you during your next  
visit to Ann Arbor. Best,
