Such as this that Shri Senani has related,are peculiar though quite normal cases in the context of olden times.The knowledge of the same s'AkhA was handed down from generation to generation in the same lineage,but many times there were deviations.It's a belief that mantra-s uttered according to the family s'AkhA are loved by the departed forefathers and a purohita was always appointed who knew the yajamAna's s'AkhA.I remember how difficult was it to find a SAmavedin for performance of a wedding or thread ceremony as the only SAmavedin family in my village had no knowledge of SAmaveda karmakANDa since the last few generations and the only SAmavedin priest in our area had passed away and his son was a mere cook.  
In this connection one thing i remember as i was told in my boyhood that KaNva,the seer,lived in the house of a Rigvedin and developed a habit of chanting of Yajus mantra-s in a Rigvedic style.Hence we have a Rigveda-like pronunciation in the KANva recension of the S'ukla Yajurveda.AbhiyuktAs tatra pramANam.
