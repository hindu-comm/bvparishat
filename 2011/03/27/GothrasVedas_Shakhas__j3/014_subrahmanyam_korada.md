**SatyanArAyan.avratam**  
  
**Origin** - **PurAn.as** .  
  
**Patan\~jali in Paspas'Ahnika** , under the **R.k** - **sudevo asi varun.a** .. , comments '**satyadevo'si'** .  
  
**Eligibility** - generally people belonging to all castes perform
and it is stated in the **VratakathA** .  
  
For that matter even **S'Udras etc should pray to
sandhyA(amantraka)-'rAjan apriyasya ca pathyasya vaktA s'rotA ca durlabha.h' - MahAbhAratam** - **aharaha.h sandhyAm upAsIta - Veda .  
  
Here in Andhra women or men do not perform this Vratam alone although it wo'nt be amiss to do so .  
**  
**Why so popular** ? because there are the results to see individually .  
  
We do not believe that the **Vratam** is learnt from **Mlecchas (Muslims) for obvious reasons** .  
  
**BrAhman.a Purohita** is a must for the **Vratam** . A **Vedic Scholar** may perform on his own . In Andhra, **YAjn\~ikas** are those **Purohitas** who go to the houses of **BrAhmanas only** and others are called **Purohitas** .  
  
**Telephone Vratam etc** do not yield the expected result .  
  
**Kalpa.h** --  
  
It is a **KAmyakarma , i.e. neither Nitya (SandhyAvandanAdi) nor Naimittika (Abdika/ Gr.hapraves'a** etc)  
  
**PAn.ini** - maskaramaskarin.au ven.uparivrAjakayo.h (6-1-149) , maskarI = parivrAjaka.h (sannyAsI)  
  
**Patan\~jali** on the above - mA kuruta karmAn.i mA kuruta karmAn.i iti ya Aha sa.h maskarI .  
  
**BagavadgItA** - kAmyAnAm karman.Am tyAgam **sannyAsam** kavayo vidu.h (18-2) .  
  
**S'AmkarabhAs.yam** etc - for '**cittas'uddhi** ' one may perform **kAmyakarmas** also ( i.e. a **sannyAsI** also and say **'s'[reekr.s.n.Arpan.am](http://reekr.s.n.Arpan.am)**)).  
  
**Userful Mantras** from **Veda** - **Gan.apatipUjA**, **Naks.atrayas.t.i , Navagrahamantras** etc.followed by **VratakathA** in verses (also prose).  
  
**Duration** - 1.5 to 2 hours roughly .  
  
**Occasion** - - After -**VivAha** ( done by **vara** and **vadhU** ), **Gr.hapraves'a** , **Aparakarma** (after performing **SAmvatsarika** of a dead person, for **S'uddhi** ) , returning from **TIrthayAtras**, completing daughter's/son's marriage .  
  
In villages across **Andhra, RMP (Registered Medical Practitioner) Doctors** send invitations and perform this **Vratam** during **Festive Season** (i.e. when the crop arrives at home ) so that the farmers , who received medical services , pay a lump sum  amount to the Doctor .  
Some families perform this every year due to devotion .  
  
**Special Occasion** -  
There is a popular temple of **SatyanArAyan.asvAmy at 'Annavaram**' , roughly 200 km from **Vis'Akhapatnam** on East Coast (Bay of Bengal) / on **National High Way 5 ( from Chennai to Kolkata**) , East GodAvari Distrist, Andhra Pradesh, may be the only one of its kind .  
It is a very ancient temple and people throng to perform **Vratam as well as Marriage** . **SAmUhikavratam(**group performance) is also done .  
**'SaatyanArAyan.a'** - is a common name in **Andhra** ( rarely in BIhAr) .
