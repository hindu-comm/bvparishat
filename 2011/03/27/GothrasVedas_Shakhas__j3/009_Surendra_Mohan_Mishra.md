Esteemed Scholars,  
Regarding the SatyanAraAyaNaVrataKathA,this is said to be in the Skanda PurANa as has also been said by P V Kane,but no portion of this episode is there in the same purANa.One can trace this in the last part of the BhavishyaPurANa with certain difference.This view i quote from the introduction of a recently published book on SatyanArAyaNavratakathA which is in Hindi poetry (mAtrika Chandas) by Pandit ShivnarayanShastri of Bhiwani,Haryana.It seems some version of SkandapurANa might have been their earlier which contained this episode and might have entered the Bhavishya in a slightly altered form.During the Moghuls and influence of Sufism it seems to have taken the form of Satya PIra KathA in Odisha and Bengal etc.areas.  
Regards,  
SMMishra
