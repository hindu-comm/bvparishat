Dear Anilkumar,  
  
I have a forthcoming article on the contested relations between some  
Vedaśākhās. But here is an interesting discussion on this issue from  
the Saṃskāragaṇapati of Rāmakṛṣṇa:  
  
Rāmakṛṣṇa cites a number of traditional authorities (Saṃskāragaṇapati,  
pp. 9-10):  
  
tathā cāṅgirāḥ -  
  
sve sve gṛhye yathā proktās tathā saṃskṛtayo 'khilāḥ /  
kartavyā bhūtikāmena nānyathā bhūtim ṛcchati //  
  
gṛhyakārikāyām api -  
  
pāramparyagato yeṣāṃ vedaḥ saparibṛṃhaṇaḥ /  
tacchākhaṃ karma kartavyaṃ tacchākhādhyayanaṃ tathā //  
adhītya śākhām ātmīyāṃ paraśākhāṃ tataḥ paṭhet /  
svaśākhāṃ tu parityajya śākhāraṇḍaḥ sa ucyate //  
  
tathā ca vīramitrodaye vasiṣṭhaḥ -  
  
yacchākhīyais tu saṃskāraiḥ saṃskṛto brāhmaṇo bhavet /  
tacchākhādhyayanaṃ kāryam anyathā patito bhavet //  
  
Śākhāntarīyakarmakaraṇe doṣam āha vasiṣṭhaḥ -  
  
na jātu paraśākhoktaṃ budhaḥ karma samācaret /  
ācaran paraśākhoktaṃ śākhāraṇḍaḥ sa ucyate //  
ya˛ svaśākhoktam utsṛjya paraśākhoktam ācaret /  
apramāṇam ṛṣiṃ kṛtvā so 'ndhe tamasi majjati //  
  
The only concession Rāmakṛṣṇa offers is that a person can accept rites  
prescribed in another śākhā if they are not described in one's own  
śākhā, and do not contradict one's own śākhā. This, he supports with  
a quotation from Kātyāyana :  
  
yannāmnātaṃ svaśākhāyāṃ paroktam avirodhi ca /  
vidvadbhis tad anuṣṭheyam agnihotrādikarmavat //  
  
With such strictures, the various śākhās of the Vedas gradually  
evolved into Jātis, sub-caste communities with distinct social  
identities, and the relations between them became ever so complex.  
There are lots of historical accounts detailing the actual instances  
of conflicts between śākhā-communities, some of which are covered by  
scholars like the Late Professor C.G. Kashikar of Pune. Others are  
detailed in a Sanskrit work titled Vedavicāra attributed to a  
Śāmaśāstrī Draviḍa Dvivedī going back to around 1880s. An edition of  
this work with a Marathi translation was published from Vai,  
Maharashtra, in 1912, by Kashinath Shastri Lele, because there were  
some śākhā-disputes that were raging in Maharashtra around that time,  
especially relating to the status of the Maitrāyaṇī community in the  
region of Nasik, as well as a dispute among the Śukla Yajurvedins of  
Maharashtra. I have collected four manuscripts of this text and  
completed a critical edition. Currently working on translation and  
annotation of this text. Interesting evidence about such conflicts  
comes from the documents of the Peshwa court, as well as the histories  
of various Brahmin communities published by the various caste  
associations. I have mostly looked at the documentation from the  
region of Maharashtra, but I am sure such documentation can be found  
from other regions.  
  
With best wishes,
