I have a friend - Raghavendra (speaks Kannada at home) - who is an Yajurvedi by birth but due to various circumstances has learnt Rigveda (about 10% remaining to be learnt) and works as a purohita amongstthe followers of Rigveda - mostly speakers of Marathi. When reciting mantras which occur in both Vedas (say Purusha Suktam or gaNAnAm tvA...) he slips into the Rigvedic mode (the anusvAra is a big difference) but then quickly adjusts to the Yajurvedic way of chanting when others present (who know only the Yajurvedic way of chanting) chant in the Yajurvedic way. I guess by the time he begets children, they might become Rigvedins.
