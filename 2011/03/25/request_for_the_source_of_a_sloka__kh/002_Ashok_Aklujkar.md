Dr. Sampath Kannan has expressed exactly my reaction to the verse (sarvadaa syaan n.rpa.h praaj;na.h ...) --bettert than I could have.

  

In section 2.8 of the following article, I have drawn attention to a similar case:

Ashok Aklujkar. 2005. "Good sayings fall on critical ears: reflections on subhaa.sitas (part 1)." In *Avani;srii.h, Professor Avanindra Kumar Felicitation Volume*, pp. 178-186. (eds) Chaturvedi, Mithilesh et al. Delhi: Vidyanilayam.

  

(Part 2 of the article is published in:Ashok Aklujkar.2005. "Good sayings fall on critical ears: reflections on subhaa.sitas (part 2)." In*Encyclopedia of Indian Wisdom: ProfessorSatya Vrat Shastri Felicitation Volume*, pp. 839-848. (ed) Sharma, Ram Karan. New Delhi: Bharatiya Vidya Prakashan.This part attempts a criticism of some of the well-known subhaa.sitas in continuation of the tradition found inMahima-bha.t.ta's Vyakti-veiveka.)

  

On a separate matter, I would like to caution that list members should not fall prey to the message that came to the list a few minutes afterDr. Kannan's postunder the name "Prabhakar C.L." Such messagesasking for money for airfare from a foreign city and depicting the sender as a stranded, helpless, person are almost always fraudulent. They make rounds of the Internet every few months. They should be taken simply as meaning that someone is using C.L. Prabhakar's email address and, \*may\* have had access to his address book (usually because he responded to some earlier dishonest message or opened an attachment that came with a dishonest message). The alleged sender C.L. Prabhakar should warn his addressees and, if necessary, change or drop his relevant e-mail address.
