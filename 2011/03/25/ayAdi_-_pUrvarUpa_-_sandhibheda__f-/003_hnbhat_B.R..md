Thanks sir, for supplementing my omission. It is the exceptional case, to the rule 1.1.109, which expects the next vowel short "a". In other places, it can take "ayaadi" externally too. Thus you can have,

  

हरे इह = हरयिह; हरे आयाहि - हरयाहाहि (though it is not not usually, found; as another rule operates optionally prescribing the loss of y and v, changing optionally, हर इह and हर आयाहि (normally found forms);  

  

शम्भो इह - शम्भाविह, शम्भौ एव = शम्भावेव etc.

  

With regards
