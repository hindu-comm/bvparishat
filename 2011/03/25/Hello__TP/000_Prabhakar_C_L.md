I'm really sorry to bother you at this time but I made a trip to London, UK and had my bag stolen from me with my passport and credit cards in it. The embassy is willing to help by letting me fly without my passport, I just have to pay for a ticket and settle Hotel bills. Unfortunately for me, I can't have access to funds without my credit card, I've made contact with my bank but they need more time to come up with a new one. I was thinking of asking you to lend me some quick funds that I can give back as soon as I get in. I really need to be on the next available flight.

  

I can forward you details on how you can get the funds to me. Send me an email, and you can also reach me on Park hotel's desk phone, the number is [+447024075451](tel:+44%2070%202407%205451). I'll be waiting to hear back from you.

Thanks,

prabhakar
