On behalf of the Conference Agenda Committee, of the World Association of Vedic Studies, (WAVES), it gives me great pleasure in announcing the WAVES conference on the theme "Varna, Jati and Kula - A Conference on India's Caste system" to be held in July 2011.



Please find attached a "Call for Papers" document that provides the details and parameters for presenting papers and participating in the conference. The main objective of this conference is to allow Academicians, Scholars, Activists, Community Leaders, Field workers and, hopefully, various Gurus and Acharyas from a variety of sampradayas and paramparas (or their representatives) to participate together in a dialog on the subject of Varna, Jati and Kula – the constituents of what is termed as India’s Caste system.



We anticipate that the conference will lay the foundations for the synthesis of a definitive reference document, thatwill comprehensively address thesubject of Caste, their origin in the Hindu conceptions of Varna, Jati and Kula, their historical development, the real and perceived issues around Caste and Caste based discrimination,as well as the geopoliticalissues associated withtheir representation both within and outside the sphere of Hindu Society. We hope that such a reference document will further lead to the creation of a policy paper will not only provide practicalguidance for Hindu Societybut will also gain the consensus of a broad variety of Hindu leaders and scholars, thus growing into a historic document.



Wecordially invite you to participate in thisendeavor,bypresenting a paper at the conference.
