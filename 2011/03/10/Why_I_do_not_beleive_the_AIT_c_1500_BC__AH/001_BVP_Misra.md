***Corollary of Aryan Invasion Theory***

***  
***

***AIT is based mainly on Comparative Philology, i.e. the study of languages. The logical corollary is as follows.***

***"In 21st century AD, most of the fair skinned, upper caste Indians (including the writer and readers of this email) use English as their lingua franca,***



***because their ancestors came to India in the seventeenth to nineteenth century AD, established the British rule and settled down here. Many of them, still referred by the natives as Phirangi (foreigner), did not interbreed with the natives and continue to maintain their racial as well as intellectual purity. They are the true and legitimate rulers of India.***

***However most of them intermarried with the locals and some of them even lost the use of English."***



***Any reason to disagree?***
