Dear Scholars,

  

Sanskrit has a very large body of Stotra literature and many of the  
more well-known stotras have been recited over generations by the  
religious-minded. I would like to know if any modern work exists that  
has studied this body of literature as reflective of the history and  
social conditions of the periods in which the individual stotras came  
to be written.  
  

Historical Account has been given by certain writers of History of Literature, like M Krishnamachariar.  
  

I shall be obliged if anybody can update in this matter.
