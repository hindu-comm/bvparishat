Dear Dr, H.N.Bhat. Thanks for giving reference of Shri Talgeri's book. I have his book on "The Rigveda and Avesta". In that book there is one whole chapter (The evidence of Isoglosses) on Linguistics. His arguments I think worth discussing on this list.



I would like to thank Dr, D. Bhattacharya by offering details of sound changes in Sanskrit. According to Dr. Kazanas Sanskrit has organic coherence and hence it is closer to the PIE (my addition of this bracket if ever existed). He adds that it is European languages who dropped retroflexes over the period of time. I think Dr, Kazanas do think there might be PIE but very close to Sanskrit.



Late Dr. S.S. Misra wrote paper,"The Date of Rigveda and the Aryan Migration-Fresh linguistic evidence"(The Indo-Aryan controversy-by Edwin Bryant) In that paper he says, " Indo-Aryan *a*remains *a* in Asiatic Gypsy but becomes *a. e. o* in European Gypsies. This confirms that original IE *a* was the same as Sanskrit *a* and remained *a* in the Indo-Iranian languages but changed to a,e,o in their sister languages. My question-Dr. Bhattacharya what do you think about this view ---who is correct Burrow or Misra? I read about laryngeals from the book you suggested, "Indo-European Linguistics" by Dr. S.N. Banerjee. But we will discuss that later on.



One more thing makes me uneasy-.According to Burrow (Phonology chapter p. 82) Sanskrit "laghu" (light)was Vedic "raghu, Sanskrit "plu-" (to float) was Vedic "pru-". There are other sound changes described from Vedic to classical Sanskrit. But we may discuss later on.



I asked question last year-If accent can change outcome of Mantras, then phoneme change will produce even bigger change in outcome. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Dear Bhattacharya,

Thanks for summing up the two sides arguments.

I am not sure whether the above book had already been viewed by the members and sheds any light on the issues raised by Dr.NR Joshi. I would like to know the opinion from the esteemed members.
