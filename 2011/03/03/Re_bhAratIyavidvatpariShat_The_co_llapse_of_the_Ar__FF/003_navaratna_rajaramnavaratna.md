 I am surprised that Hindu scholars are still so deferential towards advocates of the AIT to give them a 'fair hearing' which they are not prepared to do. AIT no more deserves a fair hearing than the Flat Earth Theory.



 Indians take it more seriously than Western academics themselves. I have given talks denouncing it as racism in linguistic garb even at Cambridge, Mass where Witzel was present.



 Let us move on to something more substantial.
