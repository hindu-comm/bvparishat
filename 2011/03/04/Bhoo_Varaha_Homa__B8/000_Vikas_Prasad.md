Dear Scholars,



Can you please share some information on'Bhoo Varaha Homa'? Why is it performed and any references to the same?



I was able to find a few links such as: <http://www.subhakariam.com/homams.htm>where it is said it is perfomred mainly for removing ill effects of not building houses according to Vaastu. We were told it has advantages to nature (the person who asked me this question actually has intention of getting it done in his organic farm land). Can you please clarify.



Regards,

Vikas
