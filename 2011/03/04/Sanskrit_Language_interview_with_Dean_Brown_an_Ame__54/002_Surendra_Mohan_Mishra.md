This is true about all the languages all over India.A Telugu author tells this alright but think if the Samskrita people take their language in the true spirit.Recently in Varanasi i had occasion to listen to a seasoned Samskrita scholar passing remarks on preceding Samskrita speakers that a they spoke a Hindi-like Samskrita language,but when it was his turn he spoke Hindi.Thousands of Samskrita teachers all over the country and outside simply spoil thousands of hours daily routinely with an adamant attitude over the years,teaching and conducting exams through non-Samskrita languages ! But when some one calls Samskrita a dead language they show to be hurt and shed crocodile tears ! It's only in Samskrita language texts that now other languages are occupying a major position.To make Samskrita live,the language has to be put to the best use.Did Bhartrihari not tell us : Daivii vaag vyavakiirneyam as'aktair abhidhaartribhih / ? Recently i heard a Samskrita person speaking at a Samskrita function spoke in a non-Samskrita language that all  
languages are in fact Samskrita ! He meant that as a language Samskrita is not great,but the greatness lies in the great works that Samskrita has produced which is at best an accident.The Telugu author is writing in Telugu and if he has been a teacher of Telugu,he must be teaching in Telugu language,unlike his counterparts in Andhra or elsewhere who are given to teach Samskrita and her kaavya and s'aastra-s.
