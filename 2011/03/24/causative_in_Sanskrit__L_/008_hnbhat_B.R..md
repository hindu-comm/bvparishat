Thank you Sir for your elaborate exposition. Just I had replied in another thread, started by him and was expecting you to reply this argument by him.

  

Very nicely said. I had just mentioned of the relativeness of karma, in the case of transitive verbs with the Causative formation in. Gati-buddhi - etc. and Causative formation also will have passive form. It is inherent in the transitive verb, that it can be used in passive structure. In Sanskrit, even intransitive verbs also can have passive structure, which makes the difference from the English concept of the voice. This is my personal view for which I can cite any external biblical reference to English structure.

  

With regards
