Respected Scholars,

Thank u very much for your suggestions and answers. The two maxims regarding the cur- class are interesting indeed.

  

as per as the relation between causative and passive is concerned please notice the following case:

My hair is cut (passive)

I had my hair cut (causative)

Thus causative verbs can be similar in meaning to passives

  

The cases ofअन्तर्भावियण्यर्थः(where causative sense is present without form) is interesting. Can you kindly explain the argument behind such notion with an example?

  

A reason for the pan-Indian feature of morphological causativity can be found in its Sanskrit origin. In early IE languages causative suffix is usually present but this suffix eventually got lost in many branches of the IE language tree.

  

Thank you for your learned suggestions and comments.

  

yours sincerely

Jay
