Thank you very much Sir. From the discussion of *Vakyapadiya* on transitivity it is very clear that a *dhatu* cannot be classified in *sakarmaka* or *akarmaka* in a rigid sense. Rather we should talk about *sakarmaka* or *akarmaka* **use** of a *dhatu* as this is now the norm in modern linguistics.**

****

I think all the conditions of regarding a *dhatu* *sakarmaka* or *akarmaka* largely maintain this sublime rule that weather the action and the result falls upon the same person/object or not.  

**  
**

Sir,****as you have showed in the earlier post that the *dhatu* '*damu*' is regarded *akarmaka.*Will you please explain how is it? because the root has a need of an object intrinsically i,e.subduing naturally needs someone or something to be subdued. then how can it be*akarmaka?* Please explain the logic.
