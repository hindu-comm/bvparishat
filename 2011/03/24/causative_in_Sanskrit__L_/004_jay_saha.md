Respected DB

my opinion about your observation is :

  

I dressed my hair and I got my hair dressed are non transformable to each other. while in the former there is no scope ofaccommodating an extra agent (surfaces usually in the by construction) in the later there is. this difference clearly comes out in the example of hair cutting. I cut my hair and I got my hair cut is nontransferable. As per as make is concerned, make works quite differently than the other two verbs have and get while all the three are causative verbs. While make needs somebody to do something the other two verbs may or may not need. I made him to copy it can not be said otherwise as I made it copied (absurd) , but I had it copied is correct. It is this kind of constructions where causative meets passive.
