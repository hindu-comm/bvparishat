Pranamami guravah,

The posts are full of resources. Prof. Korada Sir’s comments are very enlightening.

  

The heads that he has counted under which one has to search for the functions of Nic are very interesting and assures me that my thinking is going in right direction. One thing that interests is most of the heads are basically deal with different aspects of transitivity. Causativity is intrinsically related with this aspect. Even the much acclaimed sutra ‘Gatibuddhi &c’ also proclaims this fact. Gatyarthak and buddharthak roots are also basically intransitive. Do you think so?

  

As per as *Namadhatus* are concerned their relation with causativity is quite a matter of investigation. Semantically a *Nama* which do not express action on its own needs an external ‘cause’ to make it a *bhava* or expressive of action. Am I right?

*Madhaviya Dhatuvrtti* exclusively talks about *Nijanta namadhataah*.

  

The case of *AntarbhAvitan.yartha.h* as it is explained by Prof. Korada is again very interesting and it seems that it too suggests to the transitivity factor. Many many thanks to him for giving such a nice explanation with great ease.

  

Sir, you will be happy to hair that I have already collected the work of "The Sanskrit Dhatupathas: A critical study of Professor Gajanana Balkrsna Palsule and reading it.

Yours sincerely

Jay
