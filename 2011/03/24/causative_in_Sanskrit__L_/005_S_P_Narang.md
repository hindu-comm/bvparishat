Regards, About the curadigana, a number of types of roots are classified including with or without Nic or both. Cur itself denotes: steals or gets stealed through others.(causative) semantically in both the cases, the beneficiary is a person who steals or gets it steal through others. Originally in Wergeld system, the gold belonged to hero. The recovered items were not given to the owner but to the person who recovered it. The money went to the house of Cauroddharan.ika = caudhuri and not to the master. This principle may apply to a few roots of Curadi. But grammatically it is n.ic suffix which makes this category. It was not based on the meaning: simple or causative. A few roots in aadhRs.aadvaa may be considered on this principle. A number of considerations are available for the classification of this group. In the case of jnaapayati: jnaa is to know but jnaapayati: to express: may be through throat to others. The same expression is found in Panjabi: jaapanaa ( local: if you utter, you will express your intention: of course, with your mouth). But all the roots with puk do not express the same. In Sanskrit, they have different meanings and not necessarily the causative or passive. Various fields for Sanskrit passive and causative are to be reconsidered. spnarang
