Thanks for all the efforts to clarify the point raised/posed by Jay Viveka.

  

The simple fact that all the transitive verbs will have their passive form in turn, according to the intention of the speaker. It is not specific to causative, desiderative, intensive, or so any derived verbal stems. It is inherent in the simple verb itself whether it is transitive or intransitive. The aspects related to causative form are discussed in its proper place with reference to Nic suffix, which one agent is to be indicated by the verb in active or passive form.

  

Just I was observing the postings by Jay in different heads and replies by scholars of this forum. Anyway, a guide is there to guide him, for his research, I hope as usual in many departments.

  

With best regards
