Hello Jay,

As Professor Korada has aptly pointed out, there is great uncertainty  
about our knowledge of the exact contents of the Dhātupāṭha as known  
to Pāṇini, and that this is already acknowledged by authorities like  
Kṣīrasvāmī and Nāgeśa. Also consult "The Sanskrit Dhatupathas: A  
critical study (Deccan College dissertation series)" by my late  
teacher Professor Gajanana Balkrsna Palsule. This work and his  
concordance of Sanskrit Dhātupāṭhas is invaluable in making us aware  
of the variability in these lists. Kāśakṛtsna's Dhātupāṭha, with a  
Kannada commentary of Channavirakavi (rendered into Sanskrit by  
Yudhishthira Mimamsaka) is probably the earliest post-Pāṇinian  
alternative source available to us. In many instances, Kāśakṛtsna  
differs from Pāṇini (assuming we actually know the shape and form of  
Pāṇini's Dhātupāṭha).

\> The information posted regarding curadi class is very interesting. Let us try to do without the curadi classified for us. on that case what be the criterion of deciding weather the Nyanta form faithfully expresses the causative sense? In other words what were the factors that worked in constructing curadi class. If it is 'use' then the question comes why some causative verbs shed off its causative sense and behaves as an absolute non causative. Prof. Narag Sir has indicated that there may be an historical process. I would like to draw your attention on the following fact:  
\>  
\> many scholars (Whitney for example) expresses the possibility of the fact that the roots may have some denominative aspect in it. He considers some of the verb forms for example cintayati as half denominative and half causative. Thus the meaning of the verb from is 'put a thought' rather than 'he thinks'. So, this may be one more criterion.

\> Regards, About the curadigana, a number of types of roots are classified including with or without Nic or both. Cur itself denotes: steals or gets stealed through others.(causative) semantically in both the cases, the beneficiary is a person who steals or gets it steal through others. Originally in Wergeld system, the gold belonged to hero. The recovered items were not given to the owner but to the person who recovered it. The money went to the house of Cauroddharan.ika = caudhuri and not to the master. This principle may apply to a few roots of Curadi. But grammatically it is n.ic suffix which makes this category. It was not based on the meaning: simple or causative. A few roots in aadhRs.aadvaa may be considered on this principle. A number of considerations are available for the classification of  
\> this group. In the case of jnaapayati: jnaa is to know but jnaapayati: to express: may be through throat to others. The same expression is found in Panjabi: jaapanaa ( local: if you utter, you will express your intention: of course, with your mouth). But all the roots with puk do not express the same. In Sanskrit, they have different meanings and not necessarily the causative or passive. Various fields for Sanskrit passive and causative are to be reconsidered. spnarang

\> Respected Scholars,Thank u very much for your suggestions and answers. The two maxims regarding the cur- class are interesting indeed.

  
\> as per as the relation between causative and passive is concerned please notice the following case:  
\>  

\> My hair is cut (passive)I had my hair cut (causative)Thus causative verbs can be similar in meaning to passives
