Respected teachers,

I am more than delightful for getting so many enlightening responses for my queries. It is not even proper on the part of a sishya to say thanks to her acharyas. So I simply say I am extremely gratified.

Here are some more observations waiting for your consideration: 

  

The information posted regarding curadi class is very interesting. Let us try to do without the curadi classified for us. on that case what be the criterion of deciding weather the Nyanta form faithfully expresses the causative sense? In other words what were the factors that worked in constructing *curadi* class. If it is 'use' then the question comes why some causative verbs shed off its causative sense and behaves as an absolute non causative. Prof. Narag Sir has indicated that there may be an historical process. I would like to draw your attention on the following fact:

many scholars (Whitney for example) expresses the possibility of the fact that the roots may have some denominative aspect in it. He considers some of the verb forms for example cintayati as half denominative and half causative. Thus the meaning of the verb from is 'put a thought' rather than 'he thinks'. So, this may be one more criterion.

I would like to have your opinion.

  

NB. Prof. Narang Sir emphasises on the need to revisit the areas of causative and passives in Sanskrit grammar. Could you please specify what basically i need to do for this?
