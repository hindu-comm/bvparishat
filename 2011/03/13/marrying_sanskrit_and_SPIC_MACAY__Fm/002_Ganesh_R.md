Well done Smt. Himanee,  
  
I had this dream since many years and in my own humble way, with the help of some of my friends connected with the local SPIC MACAY group I
have given many talks on classical sanskrit poetry, literature and I have even performed Sanskrit Ashtaavadhaanam(a special art of spot versification and concentration at various places with out loosing the track of poetry, scholastic discussions, humour etc..It is a creative poetic multitasking entertainment.) All these are very well received by the students. Hence it is high time that we should start propagating Sanskrit poetry through SPIC MACAY.  
I am glad to extend any humble help in this regard. Please feel free to contact me.  
  
Regards  
  
ganesh
