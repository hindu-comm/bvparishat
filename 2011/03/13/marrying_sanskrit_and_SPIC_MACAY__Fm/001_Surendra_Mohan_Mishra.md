नमो विद्वत्परिषदे भारत्यै !  
  
Thanks to Ms Himanee Arjunwadkar for her volunteering before a renowned Padma-awardee regarding re-marrying Samskrita with Bhaaratiiyavidyaa.'Remarrying i say as Bhaaratiiyavidyaa was always wedded to Samskrita since time immemorial.But certainly there seems to be often a kind of estranged relationship because of the wrong side of 'Indology','Indic Studies' etc.taking over the issues as it were of a dead past.Samskrita can certainly make the things live again,rediscovering Bhaaratiiyavidyaa in her best of spirits and enchanting joy.Samskrit is melodious and mantric,the impact is universal - a fact that has been now experimented and accepted by the psycholinguists in the west.But to the west we must not look for every proof.Our proof is our own continuity of the knowledge and social traditions for more than ages.  
  
Recently i was in BHU,Varanasi for an International Seminar on Aagamashaastra by the Dharmaagama Vibhaaga where i was seated at the ground hall with the English-language paper-presenters.The whole building was donated by Shri Ghanashyam Das Birla to the SamskritaVidyaa DharmaVijnaana Samkaaya.The statue of the donor stands outside.Going around in the hall during tea-break i located a marble-slab in the wall where two beautiful verses from the Vaalmiiki Raamaayana Kishkindhaa Kaanda are inscribed with portraits of SriRaama and Hanuumaan.The verses are famously known :**  
          naanrigvedaviniitasya naayajurveda-dhaariNah /  
 naasaamavedavidu.sa.h s'akyam eva.m prabhaa.situm //  
 kritsna.m vyaakaraNa.m nuunam anena bahudhaa s'rutam /  
 bahu vyaaharataa 'nena na kincid apabhaa.sitam //**  
BhaaratiiyaVidyaa certainly can't do without Samskrita,so as rightly thought by Ms Heemani,and as rightly accepted by the exponent of classical Indian music,Samskrita should get sufficient space and time to breathe,be and become so that BhaaratiiyaVidyaa sustains and further grows in a continuous continuum ! We should not be those people to celebrate Samskrita as an Indian parallel of Greek and Latin which are now practically dead !  
  
In any discipline in Bhaaratiiyavidyaa, in our contemporary times, we find the best scholars with rare exceptions,to be highly conversant in Samskrita as she is the matrix of the vidyaasthaana-s.Societies like SPIC MACAY can set a splendid example to emulate.
