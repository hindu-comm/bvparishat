Dear Sanskritists,



I am a lover of Sanskrit as I learnt Sanskrit from middle school level itself. After retirement from service I passed M.A.(Sanskrit) through Distance Education at Potti Sree RamuluTelugu University.



The present day education is job-oriented. Therefore the students are attracted to other languages and neglecting the great Sanskrit language. My suggestion is, the Governement should make Sanskrit as a compulsary subject right from middle school.Unfortunately the Union Govt. has decided to introduce foreign languages as option to Sanskrit.
Secondly the Sanskrit Scholars should convince the student community, about the benefits of studying Sanskrit and motivate them to study Sanskrit language and not to opt for German or French etc.
