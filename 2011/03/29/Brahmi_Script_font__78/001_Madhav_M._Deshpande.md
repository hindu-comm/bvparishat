Dear Hemant,  
  
While it is nice that someone has produced a computer font for  
Brāhmī, we need to keep in mind that a font like this makes Brāhmī  
appear static, while historically scripts like Brāhmī were  
continuously evolving and regionally diverse. Also, by the time  
Brāhmī comes to be used for Sanskrit, it has developed many more  
characters than what one finds before its use for Sanskrit. With  
these cautions, the font is a great tool for practice of reading  
Brāhmī. Best wishes,
