Dear Dr. Deshpande,  
  
Namaskar,  
  
I am really privileged with your convincing remark.  
The same thought was stuck to my mind but your  
e-mail has given me a clearer outlook towards the  
same.  
  
I would like to bring to your notice that, couple of  
years back, I, along with my friend have started  
working to produce a font for MODI script and were  
aimed at giving at least 3-4 forms of the script. But  
later on, we stopped at the conclusion that it would  
just be a waste of time to produce such fonts/forms  
for MODI script.  
  
Your reply has enlightened me with a clear outlook  
on this issue.  
  
Thanks a lot for replying, Sir.  
  
Yours Sincerely,  
Hemant Rajopadhye
