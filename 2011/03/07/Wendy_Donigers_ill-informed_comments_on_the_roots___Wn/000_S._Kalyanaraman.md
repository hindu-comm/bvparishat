Wendy Doniger writes: "The Hatha-yoga-pradipikabecame an embarrassment for Hindus, who invented an apocryphal storyabout Dayanand Sarasvati (1824–83), the founder of the Bengal reformmovement called the Arya Samaj, who allegedly pulled a corpse from ariver, dissected it to see if the chakras were there, didn’t findthem, and threw his copy of the Hatha-yoga-pradipika into the water."

Here is an excerpt from Dayanand's autobiography (\_Autobiography ofSwami Dayanand Saraswati\_, Edited with an Introduction and Notes by
K.C. Yadav, Manohar Book Service, Delhi 1976).

  
"\[p. 37\] From Daronasagar I went to Moradabad via Sambhal, and thencrossing Garhmukteshwar, I found \[p.38\] myself again on the banks ofthe Ganga. At this time, besides some religious works, I had with methe Shiva-Sandhya, Natha-pradipika,Yoga-beejak and Kesarani-Samhitawhich I used to study during my travels. Some of these works gaveexhaustive description of the nervous system and anatomy which I couldnever grasp. This made me doubt the authenticity of these books. I hadbeen trying to remove my doubts for some time but had found noopportunity. One day I saw a corpse floating down the river. There wasthe opportunity to confirm the veracity of the statements contained inmy books. Leaving the books nearby and taking off my clothes, Ientered the river and brought out the dead body. I then dissected itwith a large knife in the best manner I could. I took out the heart(kamala) and cutting it from the navel to the ribs examined it. Iexamined a portion of the head and neck too. The description given inthe books did not tally at all with the actual details. I, therefore,tore the books to pieces and threw them into the river along with thecorpse. From that time, gradually, I came to the conclusion that withthe exception of the Vedas, Patanjali and Sankhya all other works onthe Science and Yoga are false."  
  
Is Hatha-yoga-pradipika identical with Natha-pradipika?  
  
On this paragraph of Yadav's edition Dominik Wujastyk (\_Interpretingthe image of the human body in pre-modern India\_, pp. 14-15)  
  
"It is worth noting that a belief in cakras was not uncontested even withinthe Hindu tradition itself. The life of the famous scholar andreligious reformer Day¯ananda Sarasvat¯ı is narrated in apseudo-autobiographical work  
ﬁrst published at the end of the nineteenth century (Jordens 1978, 1998).A striking passage narrates Day¯ananda’s disillusionment in the tantric viewof the body with its cakras during an episode which took place in 1855."  
  
And:  
  
"This is a fascinating passage for its iconoclasm and pragmatism. Although it isnot mentioned in the narrative, it seems likely that Day¯ananda would have heardof the famous dissection performed a few years earlier in 1836 in Calcutta byMadhus¯udana Gupta (Kumar 1998, 24–5). Gupta had already been honoured fortranslating Hooper’s Anatomist’s Vademecum into Bengali, and in 1836 Guptaand his colleagues became the ﬁrst Hindu brahmans to perform a dissection inhistorical times, having studied under British medical teachers such as surgeonPeter Breton and H. H. Goodeve at the Native Medical Institution (Kumar 1998,20). This event created such a stir that the cannons at Fort Williamwere ﬁred tocelebrate the event."
