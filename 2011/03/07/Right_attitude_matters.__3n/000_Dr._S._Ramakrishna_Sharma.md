Respected Scholars,  
  
The unintended, unconscious error of labeling The Itihasa and Puranam as Indian Mythology  
by a retired judge and Ex President of Krala Sahitya Academy points out the value of right  
learning and valid cultural literacy.Given below is the extract from the PDF/E-Book  
"Puranicencyclopaedia"(938pages.) It is the author's own English version of the Malayalam work  
by a school teacher in Kerala who felt the need for helping the language teachers  
who ought to know the Puranas(thank God, he does not use *Mythology*!).  
  
In contrast to the Forward, please study the author's preface in English given separately after  
the forward.

FOREWORD  
I feel flattered and consider it to be great privilege to have been asked by Shri Vettam Mani to  
contribute a foreword to his Puranic Encyclopaedia, a really magnificent literary production,  
massive in size and rich and invaluable in contents. This is the first attempt in Malayalam and for  
the matter of that in any Indian or foreign language, so far as I know, to produce a comprehensive  
and well-nigh exhaustive book of study and reference with regard to episodes, incidents, characters  
etc. occurring in the many Puranas and such other works in Sanskrit. In the field of mythology, with  
regard to variety and contents as also sheer bulk, Greece stands first. Egypt comes only next. But  
Indian mythology the epics and the puranas far exceeds and excels both Greek and Egyptian mythologies  
put together in merit and size. Even the preparation of a complete list of characters mentioned  
in our epics, puranas etc. will be a stupendous and well-nigh impossible task calling for the combined  
efforts of a number of scholars. But, fortunately for us, each and every such name, one need not  
necessarily know or be acquainted with. At the same time there are great names which compel attention  
and should not escape a proper study. And, such names are legion, and Shri Mani has not  
omitted mention of even one such name in his great work. I looked up the encyclopaedia for a few  
such random names, and was really surprised to find detailed treatment of the same in the book. Moreover,  
with reference to really important names, incidents and episodes connected with them and the  
whole genealogy are given. Everything is fully documented and quite authoritative. And, deep,  
extensive and exhaustive study, patient and untiring research and above all absolute dedication to the  
cause are so very patent on every page of the book. Literally and in effect Shri Mani's is a unique  
contribution, the first and foremost book, in the magnificent spheres of religion, culture, scholarship  
and history all put together. As the pioneer in the field he can justly feel happy and proud about  
his rare achievement, and he deserves in ample measure the unstinted praise and appreciation of all  
lovers of learning and culture.  
Shri Mani has already earned well-deserved reputation as a teacher, especially in Malayalam,  
and also as a diligent student of literature and author of talent. He evidently possesses a flair for  
research. All such distinguished talents and attainments of his have been fully and quite successfully  
commissioned in the preparation of this marvellous encyclopaedia. He has put every lover of learning  
and knowledge everywhere, under an eternal debt of gratitude by the publication of this noble work.

PREFACE  
  
..........The Puranas along with the Great Epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, have for  
centuries, profoundly influenced Indian life and Culture. The well-known definition of a Purana  
as a work having five characteristic features puranam pancalakshanam namely, primary creation, secondary  
creation, the genealogies, the ages of Manu, and the dynastic account hardly does justice to the  
full significance of these works. They are much more than that. While their genealogies and the  
dynastic account form the bed-rock of the political history of ancient India, they throw a flood of light  
on all aspects of Indian Culture its religion, social practices, art, literature and sciences. They serve  
as the key to the proper understanding of the various aspects of Hinduism its beliefs, its modes of  
worship, its mythology, its festivals, feasts, and fasts, its sacred shrines and places of pilgrimage, its philosophy  
and ethics and its theogony. **Truly it has been said that a Brahmin was not really wise if he did  
not know the Puranas. The study of ancient Indian history, and culture particularly religion is  
impossible without a proper knowledge of the Puranas. As a matter of fact, it is virtually impossible  
to understand not only ancient Indian culture and life, but also the literature in modern Indian  
languages, as it largely draws upon the ideas and ideologies as embodied in the contents of the Puranas  
and the epics.**  
The literary writings in all Indian languages are indebted to the Epics and the Puranas in more than  
one way their form, content, ideas and ideologies are all influenced to a greater or lesser extent by these  
ancient works. Direct and indirect allusions to Puranic episodes, characters, events, are frequently  
to be met with in the literary writings of all Indian languages. **Teachers engaged in imparting instruction  
in the literature in modern Indian languages must therefore be conversant with the contents of  
the Puranas and Epics in order to be able to explain these allusions wherever they occur in the  
writings in modern Indian languages. However, it is well nigh impossible for an average teacher to go  
through the whole of this vast literature. Thus the need for a handy work of reference like the present  
Encyclopaedia is apparent.**  
The desire to compile a Purar ic Dictionary that should solve many of the day to day problems of  
the Indian language teacher, took root in me, several years ago, but I could not arrogate to myself the  
capacity to fulfill this urgent need. I waited for many years, for more competent and better equipped  
scholars to come forward and produce a work ofmy dreams. But since no one appeared to quench  
this thirst, I plunged myself into this vast ocean of Sanskrit literature, and for thirteen years I dived  
deep into it, studying not only the original texts but also modern works in English, Sanskrit, Malayalam  
and Hindi. This took me five years, and I spent about twenty thousand rupees on books and travelling  
for this project. I started the compilation on 1st ofJanuary, 1955, and it took me seven years to start  
preparing the Press copy of my work. The first volume of my 'Puranic Nighantu' was released in  
February 1964 and the remaining four were published after an interval of six months in each case.  
The second edition of all the five volumes was brought out in May 1967, still under the original title  
'Puranic Nighantu'. However, in the third revised and enlarged edition in one volume published in  
October, 1971, the name was changed to 'Puranic Encyclopaedia'.
