Regards, Sharabha is not gardabha. sharabha was like a flying lion but extinct now. It is found in Kalidasa, Harsacarita and to some form in Durgasaptasati (svavahana = s'vavaahana = hound = whose resemblence is to liion.). its phonetics shows the resemblence to Zebra and may be an acquatic like As'vin which is depicted a sea animal/deity. Of course with bha suffix there is a similarity. As written earlier, it may have a relation to Khara which is known both in sanskrit and persian. spnarang
