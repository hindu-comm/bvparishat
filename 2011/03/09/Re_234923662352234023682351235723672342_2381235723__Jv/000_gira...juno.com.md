Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I forgot to add one more animal in the list (Gardabha etc). It is Sharabha. If I remember correctly Buddhist Jataka tale tells thatthe animal had eight legs. Gods cut four of them and now it has four legs. The same story is prevalent in people living in Russian Siberia for thousands of yearsThey see elk every day but they also believed that it had eight legs before and gods removed four. Any thoughts both on the ending -bha as well as connectedness of the similarities in belief of two civilizations separated by thousands of miles.



Dear Dr. D. Bhattacharya, To the best of my memory almost all my postings on this listare for scientific debate on the origin of Sanskrit and history of Mahabharata. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
