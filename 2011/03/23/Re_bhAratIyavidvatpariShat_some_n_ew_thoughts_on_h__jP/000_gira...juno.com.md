#### **I would like to thank Dr. Veernarrayan Pandurangi for posting **

#### **the research article "Colonial Indology and the Blunder of Sir William Jones **

By Ranajit Pal"



This article is interesting and controversial. Every line needs to be studied separately. He had covered many places at many different times and research by many important scholars. Although I agree with his focus on the ancient history of the northwest region of the subcontinent and its connection to the ancient Iran, I feel that certain names connection based on phonetic similitude are highly questionable. (In my recent posting I mentioned need of linguistic scholars from the northwest region of Pakistan on this list).



Zoroaster was not Devadatta. Zoroaster was zaotar which is Sanskrit hotar (priest). Persian rebellion Gomata was not Gautam. Linguists can confirm this using rules of sound changes. He has not given the ancient name of Elam as known to Persians. Elam is biblical name.



After reading the article of Ranajit Pal, scholars of this list will now understand why I was focusing on the ancient history of "Mahabharata" instead of Harappan civilization.



I do not understand how Pargiter was non-conformist. Did not he set all Mahabharat provinces within the border of the sub-continent? This is now used by manyconformist writersof India. Please correct me if I were wrong at this point.



If I remember correctly, Savitri Saxena refers to Pargiter in many places in her book, "Geographical Survey of PuraaNas".





In the book of Upinder Singh-Delhi University professor(The ancient and early medieval history of India), the photo of the site of archaeological excavations at Purana kila by Dr. B.B.Lal is given. She added that no concrete proof is found that the ancient Mahabharata Hastinapura and Indraprastha were around this locality. One gets pottery pieces and carbon dating offers ancient date. Other than no solid proof.



Indian believe that Hastinapur was world capital. If we find out it was beyond the western border of the subcontinent, how Indians will handle this situation? One way to handle is to extend border of Mahabharata empire well into the ancient Iranian land. That is what I did in my published article on "Small India, Big India" long time ago.Ranjit Pal is correct here that there was no definite border between Iran and India in the ancient time. There were clan (Panchal, Kamboja, Vahlika etc.) kingdoms as described by Mahabharata. Your information will add to our knowledge. Thanks.
