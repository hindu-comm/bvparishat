Dear Jay Saha,  
  
You should look at the book "Studies in Sanskrit Syntax" edited  
by Hans Henrich Hock for a detailed bibliography on Sanskrit syntax  
including the studies of causatives. There are studies by George  
Cardona and Stephanie Jamison that would be relevant to your  
interest. Consult the bibliographical surveys published by Cardona.  
Hope this is useful. Best wishes,
