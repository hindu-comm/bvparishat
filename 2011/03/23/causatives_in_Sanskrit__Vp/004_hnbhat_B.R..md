Dear Friend,

  

I too do not understand the questions well.

  

Well, Panini also says:  
  

स्वतन्त्रः कर्ता Whatever the speaker chooses as the agent of an action is called thekartṛ,  
तत्प्रयोजको हेतुश्च(1.4.55), ie one causing another to do is called kartaa and also "hetu" (cause OR the causal agent). This is in addition to normal agent of the causative verb.

  

The one who is caused to to do the act so is called कर्म for the causative usage of verb in certain cases of simple verbs listed below..

  
१. ४. ५२ गतिबुद्धिप्रत्यवसानार्थशब्दकर्माकर्मकाणामणि कर्ता स णौ \|  
१. ४. ५३ हृक्रोरन्यतरस्याम् \|  

  

According to the above consequences, the term हेतु is a well defined technical term. Its immediate usage is the scope of the causative meaning to convey which the suffix णिच् is added to all the simple verbs classified into 10 basically (which includes स्वार्थ or called चुरादिः for the purpose of conjugation process) which is beyond the scope of rule)asहेतुमति च। (३. १. २६). There need not be any morphological difference between the two usages, by which one can distinguish. In certain cases, at random, even without the suffix, the causative sense is implied, as the context demands, according to the commentators, who often say अन्तर्भावियण्यर्थः.  

This much is the direct reference to what is called causative verb as phrased in English.

  

  

१. ३. ६७ णेरणौ यत् कर्म णौ चेत् स कर्ताऽनाध्याने \|--

is exceptionally complicated सुत्र involving many conditions and alternatives, itself has attracted dozens of commentators for the Sutra itself to test their proficiency.

  

More on these points can be are discussed at length in Bhasya, Kashika, Vakapadiya etc. in different aspects traditionally. Our Prof. Subrahmanyam Korada, may give a gist of the ideas, if possible within the framework of the message in the thread. But I doubt, as the questions need a deep search, but without specific objective as DB has pointed out.

  

MM Deshpande has already suggested already given a select list of modern writers on the topic in general.
