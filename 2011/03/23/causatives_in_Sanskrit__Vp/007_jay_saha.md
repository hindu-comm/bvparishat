Respected Sir,

Thank you very much for your suggestions. I have got idea that passives may have some role in causative syntax in the paper ofHans Henrich Hock that is published in '*Studies in Sanskrit syntax'.* This article mainly deals with *Vedic* causatives. Sir,I have also seen the extensive bibliography on Sanskrit syntax prepared by you and Hock. I am trying to obtain the papers of George Cardona. Sir could you tell me how can i get this two works of Jamision Stephanie:

  

Jamison Stephanie. 1976. Functional ambiguity and syntactic change: the Sanskrit accusative. Papers from the parasession on Diachronic Syntax, 126-35. Chicago: Linguistic Society.

  

----------. 1977.Function and form in the *-aya-* formations of the *Rgveda* and *Atharvaveda*. Yale University Ph.D. Dessertation.

  

I have searched in some of the libraries in Delhibut failed to obtained it. Sir I am not successful in finding out this paper also:

  

Hamp Eric P. 1985. Transitive and causative in Indo- European. Papers from the Parasession on causatives and Agentivity, ed. by W.E. Eilfort et al., 64-6. Chicago: Linguisti Society.

  

Sir if you tell me where from i can get these papers it will be an enormous favor to me.

Seeking your blessings

your sincerely

Jay
