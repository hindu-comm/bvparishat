Respected Scholars,



O Masters! accept my regards. I am a student of Sanskrit and currently studying the process of causative formation in Sanskrit.

I am a lot confused about how to start the researchand what should be the methodology. 

I am specially interested in the semantics of causative forms and its relation to the syntax.

If you kindly guide me in this regard I shall remain highly obliged. Please suggest me some reading materials also. 

Ihave following queries for your kind consideration:

  

     1.What does the term *Hetu*signifies in Paninian grammar?

      The term is used in a general sense of cause and in a specific sense of a causer as well.   

      Does this in any way indicates to the vast scope of linguistic causativity which incorporates instrumental causativity or event causativity for example?

  

     2.Is there any other way of expressing causative sense apart from the morphological ones?

      Does Sanskrit have any lexical causativeverb?

  

*     3*.Does causatives have any relation with the passives in semantic level if not in syntactic level?

      Does Sanskrit nominalisation process has any relation with causativisation?

     

     4.Do the roots enumerated in the 10th class have any causative sense? or can any way relates to causativity?

  

     5. Why some scholars do not accept the *cur*-class as a separate *gana* ?

  

     6. What could be the origin and the process of development of current causative forms of Sanskrit?

  

I shall be extremely gratified to have a reply from the distinguished scholars and teachers. Thanking you

  

yours sincerely,

Jay Saha
