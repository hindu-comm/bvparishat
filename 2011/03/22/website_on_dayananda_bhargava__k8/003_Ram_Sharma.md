My dear Sharma Ji,

 First of all, please convey my personal cordial regards to Prof Dayananda Bhargave a living and moving encyclopedia of real VedavijNaanam and also to Prof VeeranarayaNa PaNDuraNgi an eminent daarshanikapravara.Your questions themselves contain answers."Yes" is the answer to all your questions.The two abovementioned aacaaryas would be the best persons to reply to your questions threadbare.

 Presently I am in Philadelphia(U Penn).As and when i am in Jaipur,I will make it a point to meet you and discuss all such problems.

 All the best,

 Ram Karan Sharma
