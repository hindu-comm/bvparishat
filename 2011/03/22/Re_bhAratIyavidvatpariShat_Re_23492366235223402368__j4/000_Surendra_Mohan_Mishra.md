**Dear Prof. Joshi and Prof. Narang,  
[Vi.s.nu](http://Vi.s.nu) has names S'arabha and Sarabha both in the Sahasranaamaavalii.he is also S'arva and Sarva.Is there a linguistic affinity between S'arabha and S'arva whereas semantically both give the same sense ?Can S'arabha be carnivorous and Sarabha (from s.r gatau)herbivorous creature ?Or the difference is due to the influence of S'aurasenii prakrit ?  
Best regards,  
SMMishra**
