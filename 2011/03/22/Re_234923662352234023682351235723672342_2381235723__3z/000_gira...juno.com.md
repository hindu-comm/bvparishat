Dear Dr. H.N.Bhat, Thanks for colorful pictures of Sharabha. Other information you provided is also interesting. I did not know Vis'Nu is called Sharabha. Maratha kings from Maharashtra at the time of Shivaji used Gandabherunda as symbol. I do not know the purpose of it. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Here is the mythological image of the incarnation of Shiva as Sharabheshvara:



Iconographical image of the same:

Another one: purely in the mythological image of the animal in divine get up, can't see eight feet (but six + raised 2 hands).

Descreptions are available in Tantra texts as Akasha Bhairava depicted as Sharabheshvara too.

But Vishnu is also called शरभ and legends differ according to Vaishnavaite and Shaiva tantric texts. I am not sure. Here is one web page which contains the description of Saiaite sources:

[http://sadhanmala.blogspot.com/search/label/शरभेश्वर](http://sadhanmala.blogspot.com/search/label/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%B0)

It is called शरभखगपति obviously having the face of a lion and wings like a bird with 6+2 legs can be seen in the images.

Futher there is a Sharabhopanishat which is claimed by both Shaivas and Vaishnava-s as describing Shiva (Veerabhadra) and Vishnu (Narasimha) in the Upanishat.

<http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/23451465/1139788322/name/Sharabopanishat.pdf>

The above gives the idea of both the sides. In any case, it may be a kin of Chiese dragon or Greek animal you had described. There is another version of Shaiva-s GanDabherunDa counterpart of Sharabha. This to deserves to be one of the family members.

With "ralayor abheda" norm it can be शलभ too a butterfly. Lexicons give different meanings for the same word, one of which is butterfly.
