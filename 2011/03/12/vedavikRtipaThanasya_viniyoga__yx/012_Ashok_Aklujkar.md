You probably intended some qualification here (such as in the Vaidika's daily personal ritual practice, his review sessions to ensure that what he had memorized was not forgotten, etc.) but did not express it. In my (limited) experience, it is quite common to recite mantras in such a way that others can hear them. Is there good textual evidence to hold that this is a later phenomenon?

  

Manu 2.85 (vidhi-yaj;naaj japa-yaj;no vi;[si.s.to](http://si.s.to) da;sabhir gu.nai.h / upaa.m;su syaac.chata-gu.na.h saahasro maanasa.h sm.rta.h) clearly presupposes that an un-upaa.m;su recitation was possible (although, probably to avoid showy performance of religiosity, it recommends upaa.;su and maanasa recitation).
