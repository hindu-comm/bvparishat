Respected scholars,

  

I do not know anything about the topic raised in these postings. But here is an information from my side:

SriParameswara Aital has produced anexcellent as well as
informative catalogue namely *Vedalakshana*, *Vedic Ancillary Literature* : *A descriptive Bibliography.*(Pub by1.Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 1991). After reading the same, it will appear that so many works regarding Vedalakshana are still in manuscripts. The attractive part of this huge work is, apart from givingphysical description of the manuscripts available on the subject, it gives gist ofthe contents of the works.
