Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,  
  
I agree with you as far as authorization for the recitation of  
the Vikṛtis in ritual performance is concerned. It was the instance  
of this recitation that I cited that prompted my curiosity. I don't  
exactly remember where I read/heard it, but there is some publication  
containing the Jaṭāpāṭha version of a classical verse: something like  
"kṛṣṇāya tubhyam namaḥ." I will provide the bibliographic reference  
if I can locate it. So it looks like at least for some practitioners  
of Vedic recitation, the art was occasionally extended to the domain  
of rituals and occasionally to post-Vedic verses, though there is no  
official authorization for such practice. I suppose one reason for  
this must be an effort to demonstrate the ability of the reciter to  
his audience. The other possible reason could be that for a reciter  
who is not specifically well-read in the prescriptive literature of  
the Śrauta/Gṛhya literature, the lines between various domains of  
performance get blurred, and so do the boundaries between what is and  
is not Vedic. I remember a story of a wedding told in my family. At  
this wedding, the father-in-law to be was a learned Shastri, and as  
the wedding ceremony began, the father-in-law began to recognize the  
mistakes made by the priests, and each time they would make a mistake,  
he would stop them and correct them. Around the time I got married in  
Philadelphia in 1970, there was only one Hindu priest in that area,  
and I did observe him recite "śāntākāraṃ bhujagaSDṚŚAM." A priest  
here in the Detroit area even today randomly adds "am" or "aḥ" to  
Sanskrit words of the pothi he reads. So "śubhaṃ bhavatuḤ." Best,
