\<I have not seen any works on the ritual viniyoga of the Vikṛtipāṭhas listed there.>

My dear Madhavji,

Does it not appear likely that ritual viniyoga of vikṛtipāṭha is not an authentic Vedic practice? Perhaps one will never get that in any ancient manual. What you saw in the *vikṛtipāṭha* of *bhadraṃ karṇebhir* etc looks, from the literature available, like an unauthorized extension of a Ṛgvedic abhyāsa rule to gṛhya viniyoga.

Absurd things do happen with ritual practice. I shall mention one local custom here in Bengal. In certain areas here the priest utters his mantras aloud in ordinary smārta pūjās or saṃskāra karmans. As far as I know the upāṃśu utterance is the norm, perhaps after Āśvalāyana. But here, unless one utters aloud, people begin to suspect that the priest is not doing anything or that he does not know the mantras by heart!

Any Vedic sanction?

Best

DB
