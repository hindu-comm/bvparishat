Dear Professor Deshpande,

I noted a discussion on your enquiry about Vedavkṛtipāṭha made about two months ago in this forum. I regret that I missed it. I could give you the following information without any claim that they might be of help.

Long ago, Pt. Mangipūḍi Venkaṭśāstrī of Andhra had presented me his very learned and laborious work *Vyāsaśikṣāvimarśaḥ* (Vijayawada 1992) where he made some interesting discussions. Perhaps you have yourself read the book. In that case reading this letter is unnecessary. Otherwise, I bring to your notice the fact that Panditji begins his work emphasizing that the eight vikṛtis beginning from jaṭā belong exclusively to the Ṛgveda. Their utility lies in remembering the Ṛgvedic mantras only. Panditji regrets that the intention of Vyāḍi is not fulfilled by present day reciters and ritualists.

Again, historically speaking the primary employment of Ṛgvedic mantras is in the Śrauta ritual. I do not see how they could be meant for Gṛhya ritual at the time of their origin. Another point, though Āśvalāyana’s ता एकश्रुति सन्ततमनुब्रूयात् is understood by ritualists in their own way, one thing becomes certain from this. Non-śastra, non-stotra mantras should be devoid of any embellishment during ritual employment. Taking recourse to vikṛti while employing them is prohibited then.

I myself am no ritualist and spoke just from common sense and whatever little I know of the literature concerned. I do not know if anybody has already said this. But I should like to know your opinion on this.

Regards and best wishes

Dipak Bhattacharya**
