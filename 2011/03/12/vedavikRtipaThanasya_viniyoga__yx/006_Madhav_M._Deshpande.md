Dear Professor Bhattacharya,

No, I have not seen this work. I have some other edition of the  
Vyāsaśikṣā, but not this work titled Vyāsaśikṣāvimarśaḥ. I checked  
the catalogue of the University of Michigan library and the Worldcat,  
but cannot find any copy of this work. Looks like an important  
work.
