Thanks, Professor Deshpande,  

I recall one incident in this connection. Śrī Āñjaneya Ghanapāṭhī of East Godavarī personally arranged for a recitation of the TS by his sons in the Jaṭāpāṭha mode! 

Not only that, himself an Āpastambin, he had learned and trained his sons in AVŚ recitation. 

And to add to it each AV-hymn recitation with a sāman!

He was trained in Varanasi. But he had not learnt at the Raṭāṭes.

I always thought, but found it beyond good taste, to ask the great Vaidika that the first and the third practice had no Vedic or ancient traditional sanction.

Since many views have been expressed please forgive the small observation below:

Things changed through the ages. You yourself greatly argued against Sūrya Kānta that ms traditions and readings underwent heavy changes imperceptibly . Will it be unreasonable to think that so did our recitation and śākhā affiliation tradition on which we had a discussion in this forum?

Best

D. Bhattacharya
