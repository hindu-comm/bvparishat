 A few weeks ago I spent several days with geneticist Stephen Oppenheimer and colleagues discussing this very issue. The domestication of Bos Indicus and several other plants and animals originated in India.



 This is **scientific evidence,** based on DNA data. let us not dilute it by mixing up linguistics which can be argued both ways.
