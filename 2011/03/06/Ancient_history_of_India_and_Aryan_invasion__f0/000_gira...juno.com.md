Respected scholars, Namaskar!



Research has starting point but no end

Etymology of Gardabha,Raasabha and Vris'abha is needed



I do not know who are the staunch supporters in India today of Aryan invasion in connection with the ancient history of India. I have presented evidence here on this list that in the ancient time people were moving from Asia to Europe. The large number of European scholars know that. When European scholars come to give talk in India in big cities, Indian scholars may ask them questions. Dr. Asko Purpola was in India last year receiving award from Karunanidhi. He wrote in the newspaper about wild ass depicted on Indus seal. He raised question about words "Gardhabha", He said that "bha" is Iranian suffix. Wild asses were in Indian salt desert (irina). Balaram killed Denukasura (wild ass) in Palm grove of the salt desert and drank Taadi-palm wine---read his article and ask him questions. When he comes in India talks about Harappan Dravidian language, why did not Indian scholars ask him to talk about the presence of Indo-Aryans in the ancient Finland, his country. Dr. Kazanas gave talk recently in Chennai. According to him there is organic coherence in Sanskrit. Hence the ancient Sanskrit (or Vedic) is very close (the imagined) proto-indo-european.He even questions methodology of the eminent philologist Dr. Burrow. (I like views of Dr. Kazanas on Sanskrit) He also says Mitannis were Indo-Aryans. Flowering of Greek civilization was from 800 BC to 300 BC. So who were in Greece at the time of Trojan war? Why did they help Hittits against invading Greek tribes? I do not know how manyIndian scholarsasked him about the ancient Greece. If you have doubts about your own history, then ask questions to foreign scholars and Indian scholars working in foreign universities to acquire new information. Many scholars are coming to World Sanskrit scholars. So this is good opportunity. Sometimes others may offer reply that makes you happy. Whilesome undertake research for their own purpose because they want to understand more about the ancient Indian culture as described recently by Dr. R.N. Iyengar. I am in the second category.



The problem is not the Aryan invasion in the ancient history of India. It is Sanskrit linguistics/semantics-the origin of Sanskrit and history of Mahabharata.
