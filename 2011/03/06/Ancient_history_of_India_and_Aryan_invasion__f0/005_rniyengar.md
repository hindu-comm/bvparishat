When I studied Abhi. Shakuntalam, my teacher Pt. Sri Krishnamacharya  
explained "karbhOru" as one who has a thigh like an elephant's trunk.  
"Karabha iva Uruu yasyaah saa"; that is thick at the top and slimming  
towards the lower end. We used to talk in Kannada of course. For  
karabha itself his explanation was "karah iva bhaati". The suffix  
'bhaa' had to be explained in the sense of 'iva bhaati'. The same word  
is used to denote an elephant as that is one of the specific lakshaNa,  
or discriminator. Perhaps minor variation in phonetics is permitted;  
like karabha can become kalabha, with an understanding such as  
‘ralayorabhedah’. \[If you observe carefully Japanese, Chinese and NE-  
Indian pronunciations; ‘ra’ seems to get replaced by ‘la’\]. The above  
explanation perhaps can not be generalized. It does not seem to hold  
good with the Vedic word ‘karambha’ which is some type of gruel.

If I am wrong, I may be excused.
