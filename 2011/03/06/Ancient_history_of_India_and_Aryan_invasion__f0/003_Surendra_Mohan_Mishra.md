**This is highly interesting and engaging discussion.I may add : Another such word is 'r.s.abha'.Also 'garabha' is a word which means small insects in the stomach.The suffixes 'abhac' or 'abhak' and also 'bhan' give such words..As'vatara' is also such a word which means an ass or an animal born of a she-donkey and a horse.'Gardabha' also means a white lily.Could this be from 'gartabha' which is not found to be used in this sense ! '-Bha' invariably seems to be somehow connected with semblance and shared properties.See 'karabha' or 'kalabha' meaning a young elephant or a camel.This is as the trunk of an elephant or the neck of a camel appear as a straightly hand.When Amara says 'ma.nibandhaad aakanis.t.ham. karasya karabho bahih',then also that portion of the edge of a palm appears as miniature of a hand.All names are after all based on perceived qualities in substances.Best regards,SMMishra**
