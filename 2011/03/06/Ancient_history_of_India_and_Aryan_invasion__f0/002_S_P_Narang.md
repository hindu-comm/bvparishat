Regards, Gardabha may have relation to khara (bha?). Kharatara is known for mules also and a kaccha is known by that name. Its earlier relation with As'va : which means water and the animals belonging to equus A hymn is found in the RV which shows that saudhanvanas ( inhabitants of the sea-shore had the profession of bringing out such animals from the sea). It is As'va-suukta. Dhenukaasura does not mean an ass but an animal with a horn. Of course, dhenu means a mammal which is preserved in Panjabi as dhyonaa = mammal ( in dhet root and dhaatrii= a lady who feeds the child = jhaaii= mother in panjabi). It may be rhino. The ox in Indua valley has a resemblence with a cow: sthuula and prsatii as found in the Mahabhasya of Patanjali ( sthuulapr.s.attimaalabhet). It may be zebric in character = s'abala. New interpretations and etymologies of the words, if sound, must be accepted. I attended one of the lectures on Aryan invasion and do not agree with all the hypothesis of Kazanas which I expresssed in the lecture. Fresh interpretations of scholars like Parpola and others must be welcomed after close investigations. The relation with ancient countries is less explored. Many of the traditional scholars are reactive to this idea. But the relation of Veda with Iran, Balakh,Kamboja, Afghanistan, Oxus cannot be ruled out. The seat shifted later to saptasindhu. Both the traditions are preserved by the MBH. Regards, spnarang
