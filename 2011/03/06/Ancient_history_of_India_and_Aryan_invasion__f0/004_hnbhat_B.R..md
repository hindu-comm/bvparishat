What about the similarity with the meanings of करभ in the compound करभोरु? How to translate the compound and its upamaana? I am confused with the linguistic observations. 



as in:

अङ्के निधायकरभोरु, यथासुखं ते संवाहयामि चरणावुत पद्मताम्रौ ।।अभिज्ञानशाकुन्तलम् 3- 18;

  

वदे त्वां करभोरु भोरिति॥ नैषधीयचरित ९.४३॥  

  

प्रेरणमिवकरभोरुकरोति गतिम् प्रतिमुंच विलम्बम्॥गीतगोविन्दम् अ प २०-४॥

  

etc.
