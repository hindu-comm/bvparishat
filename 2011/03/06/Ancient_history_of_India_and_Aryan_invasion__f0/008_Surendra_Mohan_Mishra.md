**The word 'karambita' in the sense of 'mixed' is used in the Giitagovinda.'Karambha' : ka+rambha-gha^n,means mud or flour.See that 'karamba' is derived as 'k.r-ambac' which means mixture.The basic assumption made by Dr N R Joshi sometime back that acoustic form has a relation with the semantic property may seem to hold good at a few places,but can this be said in general ?Plainly is there a relation intrinsic between sound-word and thing - tangible or intangible ? Regards,SMM.**
