Continuing with the discussion --  
  
it is not logical to say that the **'garbha**' before fifth month is a **'jad.a' .**  
  
There is **'PrAn.a'** in it and if one closely follows the chain of events - the earlier '**jIva' or 'purus.a**' only enters the womb in the form of **'s'ukras'on.ita'** .  
  
Really it is so but when would the **'garbha'** be in a position to have **'understanding' and 'feeling of comfort/pain' etc. ?  
**  
That's why **BhAgavata etc**. talk of '**Smr.ti'** first and **'Bodha' or 'Caitanyam**' later .  
  
So , the convincing reply will be that - already the **"Garbha**" had had **Atma** (i.e. having life) and as such '**Caitanyam**' also but in a form of '**TirobhAva'** (concealed) and by fifth month it will shift to a form of '**AvirbhAva**' (revealed) - **SAmkhyadars'anam .  
**  
The point here to note is that **Brahman** is in the form of both '**cara**' and **'jad.a**' (**sarvam cetanAvat**) . But for all practical purposes one has to distinguish between a 'living ' and 'non-living' thing .  
  
I am not entering into lengthy discussions for obvious reasons . We may discuss depending on demand .
