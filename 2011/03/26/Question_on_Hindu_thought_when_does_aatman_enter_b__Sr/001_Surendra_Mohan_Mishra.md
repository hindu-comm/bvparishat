As per the Garbhopanishad the Atman enters the body in the 7th month only.But as i remember one schplar from Pune had said that this aspect of this upanishad could be spurious.Every philosophical school has an explanation.The Vedic ones speak differently although they swear by the Veda-s.These are alternative possible explanationa.Just as killing a creature is to kill it's body,so also abortion means destroying the growing body which would house the self in due course.The question needs long exercise.Best regards,SMM
