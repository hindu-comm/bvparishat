Dear Joshiji, I asked a number of scholars of zoology regarding this animal: living or extinct but no one gave the reply. I saw the photo of this animal in some temples of South India preserved in the phototheque section of IFP Pondicherry. It was scanned when I was in that institution. The incharge of the section may be contacted and director may give the permission for the photo. Regards, spnarang
