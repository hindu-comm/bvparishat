Dear Dr. S.P. Narang, Namaste!



I did not mean Sharabha is Gardhabha. I was adding it with other animals ending in -bha. I included also Vris'abha if you remember. According to G. M. Bongard-Levin (Soviet Indology series, no7) the word 'Sharabha' (the dweller of forest) corresponds to the word "Shorp" or 'Sarb" used for elk by Finno-Ugric people living beyond Urals. Their legend about elk having eight legs is similar to the ancient Indian legend although they see elk everyday having four legs. It looks to me that there was contact between Siberia and people of the ancient subcontinent. I did not find the origin of the name Siberia. I did not talk yet on BVP about Urals in connection with Mahabharata. We just stopped in Bactria.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Regards, Sharabha is not gardabha. sharabha was like a flying lion but extinct now. It is found in Kalidasa, Harsacarita and to some form in Durgasaptasati (svavahana = s'vavaahana = hound = whose resemblence is to liion.). its phonetics shows the resemblence to Zebra and may be an acquatic like As'vin which is depicted a sea animal/deity. Of course with bha suffix there is a similarity. As written earlier, it may have a relation to Khara which is known both in sanskrit and persian. spnarang

Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I forgot to add one more animal in the list (Gardabha etc). It is Sharabha. If I remember correctly Buddhist Jataka tale tells thatthe animal had eight legs. Gods cut four of them and now it has four legs. The same story is prevalent in people living in Russian Siberia for thousands of yearsThey see elk every day but they also believed that it had eight legs before and gods removed four. Any thoughts both on the ending -bha as well as connectedness of the similarities in belief of two civilizations separated by thousands of miles.



Dear Dr. D. Bhattacharya, To the best of my memory almost all my postings on this listare for scientific debate on the origin of Sanskrit and history of Mahabharata. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
