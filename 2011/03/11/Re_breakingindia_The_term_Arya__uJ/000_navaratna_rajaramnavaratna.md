 It was and still is used by South Indian groups identifying oneself as 'civilized'. Most recently, 'eedigaas' a community traditionally associated with harvesting toddy from palm trees changed their designation to 'arya eedigaas'. Of course Chettiars call themselves Arya Vaishyas.



 A common form of polite address in South India (not limited to Tamil Nadu) is 'Ayya' which is Prakrit tadbhava for Arya.



 This link to South India is much stronger and much less speculative than to any Indo-Europeans who may never have existed. (South Indians' existence is indisputable.)
