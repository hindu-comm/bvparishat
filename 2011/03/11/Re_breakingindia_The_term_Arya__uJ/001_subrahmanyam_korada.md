AryAvarta.h  
  
Please find the two attachments that vouch to the fact that **AryAvarta or Pu.nyabhUmi** ( AryAvarta.h pu.nyabhUmi.h madhyam vindhyahimAgayo.h -- **Amarakos'a**) was defined and demarcated by no less a person than **Patan\~jali** himself in **MahAbhA.sya**  
under ' **p.r.sodarAdIni yathopadi.s.tam ' PA.nini 6-3-109) , hundreds of years ago .  
  
The then AryAvarta had had the following boundaries --  
**  
**East - KAlakavanam (PrayAga)  
  
North - HimAlaya  
  
South - PAriyAtram(Vindhya)  
  
West - Adars'a (Kuruk.setra)  
  
AcAra of Aryas -**  
  
1. **kumbhIdhAnyA.h** ( who hoard rice etc. sufficient for two / three days - **Sreedharabha.t.ta in NyAyakandalI - Commetary on Vais'e.sika)**  
  
2.**alolupA.h** ( without lust , as such hoarding may be for '**dambha' , i.e. I am superior to all others**)  
  
3.**ag.rhyamA.nakAra.nA.h** - (follow '**sadAcAra' without expecting
any 'lAbha' , 'pUja' etc.**)  
  
4.**kin\~[cidantare.na](http://cidantare.na) kasyAs'cid vidyAyA.h pAramgatA.h ( learnt all Vidyas without 'gurUpades'a' )  
  
S'i.s.tas are those who follow the above mentioned principles . And the S'abdas employed by S'.s.tas , but not analyzed by AcArya (PA.nini) are authentic .  
**  
( see **VAkyapadIyam quoted by Kaiya.ta ,and Manusm.rti by NAges'a in Scan II )  
  
**In the beginning there was the **Daivy VAk or Samsk.rtam** ( which has got the **SamskAra of VyAkara.nam - samsk.rtam = samskara.h asyA astIti samsk.rtam , sam + k.r + kta , samparibhyAm karotau [bhU.sa.ne](http://bhU.sa.ne) (VArti. su.dAgama.h), napumsake bhAve kta.h , Pa.n 3-3-114, matvarthe ac-pratyaya.h , like vibhaktA bhrAtara.h , dugdhA gAva.h etc )** .  
  
**Hari says in BrahmakA.n.da ( 155 ) of VAkyapadIyam --  
  
daivy vAk vyavakIr.neyam as'aktairabhidhAt.rbhi.h**  
  
( this **VAk of Devatas** became / made complicated / deformed by the users who were too weak to pronounce )  
  
In other Languages there may be some words which have got resemblance ( **[d.rs](http://d.rs)'yate rUpatulyatA - BhAsa in SvapnavAsavadattA**) .If one is interested he is free to work in that direction .  
  
Even some Telugu words have got similarity with some words of the Languages of Russian Federation .  
  
**One should / can not argue that Sanskrit is the Origin of all Languages . But at the same time one should / can not brush aside the impeccable and reliable evidence that was recorded hundreds of years ago by Yogis . Generations received the knowledge thru 'avicchinnaparamparA
of Guru ans S'.sya .  
**  
Here on this **Pu.nyabhUmi** there lived people who were ascetic and their words are **PramA.nam** for all .  
  
**YogAnus'Asanam , Ayurveda etc are just examples . Let someone prepare a matching VyAkara.nam / Yoganus'Asanam / Ayurveda system today .  
**  
**Presently we do not have all the 1137 S'Akhas of Vedic Literature and many more valuable books were burnt by Muslim invaders due to 'ajn\~Anam' ( lA-ilm) , whereas the Christians took away many books from the unsuspecting Aryas for cheating and manipulations .  
  
We used to call our father by the term ' Ayya / Arya ' . Even today in our orthodox families the father has to be addressed 'Arya' (Aryas'ree) .** **Ayya** - is prevalent in Andhra Pradesh .  
  
**The entry ' Aryan ' in Oxford as a Sanskrit word is wrong - - .r = gatau , .nyat-pratyaya by - .rhalor.nyat, PA.n 3-1-124 -- Arya.h .  
**  
It was **Adolf Hitler** who got borrowed both - the concept of **Aryas and SwastikA from MahAbhA.syam (see Mein Kampf = My Struggle).**  
  
Not only in **VyAka.nam but in PUrvamImAmsA (AryamlecchAdhikara.nam) and NyAyabhA.syam ( 1at AdhyAya)** and other works we come across **Aryas** and related matters .  
  
**We do not or never know as to what kind of SadAcAra ( regular recitation of Veda , Satyam , AhimsA etc ) the so called invading Aryans had had .
