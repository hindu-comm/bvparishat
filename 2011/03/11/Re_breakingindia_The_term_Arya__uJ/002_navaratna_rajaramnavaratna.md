 I can find other sources giving other definitions. Why this obsession with Arya?



 It is a modern European not an ancient Indian obsession. In the whole of the *Rigveda,* all ten books of it, the word Arya appears fewer than 40 times. You may find it mentioned as many times or more in a single page of Hitler's *Mein Kampf.*

 Also, Hitler's Aryans worshipped Scandinavian gods like Odin, Thor etc, not Vedic gods. Also, their Swastika was not from India, but 'Hakenkreuz' or the "hooked cross" brought into berlin in the 1920s by the Lithuanian Erhardt Brigade.
