Nama.h Parishade,  
  
I was trying to understand the definition of minority language in the context of education in India. There are some conflicting writings (one such is attached) on this definition. Some claim that the definition is constitutionally derived (as those other than the scheduled languages), while others believe it is numerically defined. Some others claim it is a state subject, thus the language which is a minority in a state may not be so in another.  
  
I would like to know if there is a clear legal and constitutional stand, which talks about this, especially in the context of educational institutions. I am looking for an unambiguous definition which can explain questions like "Are Sanskrit vidyapithas minority institutions as the law stands today?"
