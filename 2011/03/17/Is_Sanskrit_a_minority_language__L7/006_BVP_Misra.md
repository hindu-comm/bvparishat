***Respected Scholars,***

******

***With reference to the email of scholar Srinidhi V I beg to state that***

******

1.  ***All of us know that the Governments led by Congress, leftists and
    crypto communists reserve the benefits of “minority status” for non
    Hindu (preferably anti Hindu) organizations. That is the reason why
    the Shikh and Buddhist institutions claim minority status even
    though those religions are legally defined by some civil laws, like
    Hindu marriage laws, as part of Hinduism.***

******

1.  ***Even Ramakrishna Mission has been asking for such status at some
    time simply to avoid the persecution they face as a Hindu
    organization.***

******

1.  ***These Governments will never give any benefit of “minority
    status” to any Sanskrit institutions, while their workers are
    covertly, but very aggressively, trying to spread the belief that
    only a very small miniscule of the population (who are Hindu
    communalists) are interested in Sanskrit.***

******

1.  ***In most states the Government scales of of pay of teachers is
    less for Sanskrit teachers than the other teachers, even with same
    (B.A.) degree from the same university.***

******

1.  ***Irrespective of any legal status, such as Sanskrit having been
    declared as an M.I.L. by the Supreme court we cannot expect any
    Government help for Sanskrit institutions, like the Urdu
    institutions.***

******

***If you are really serious about popularizing Sanskrit and promoting it,***

******

1.  ***Spend your own money to promote Sanskrit and persuade your like
    minded friends to do so.***

******

1.  ***Try your best by all means to throw the anti Sanskrit rulers out
    of power.***

******

***With regards and best wishes for your success in promoting Sanskrit,***

******

***Yours truly,***

******

***D DMisra***
