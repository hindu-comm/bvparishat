 Note that Oldenberg is a great favorite of Western, especially German Indologists. He is considered the ultimate authority on the Vedas by the likes of Michael Witzel. We should not engage with them in debates on their own terms. That would be playing into their hands.



 The word Arya in the Indian context is quite inocuous and has no sinister connotation. But Dravidian politicians have been infected with the European disease thanks to the missionaries who created the Aryan-Dravidian divide. The depth of reverence and inferiority complex that TN leadership harbors towards missionaries has to be seen to be believed. When I criticized Bishop Caldwell and Father Kamil Zvelibil in one of my talks, a senior scholar came to me after the talk and said in a fearful voice, "You can't say such things." He didn't dispute my facts though!
