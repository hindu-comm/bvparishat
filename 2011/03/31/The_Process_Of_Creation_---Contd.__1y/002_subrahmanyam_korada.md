Answer to such questions were already offered in the earlier postings .  
  
The universe is the false form (mithyAsvarUpam) of Brahman . In order to see that the PrAn.is suffer / enjoy , as per the Dus.kr.tam / Sukr.tam they earned , i.e. Karmaphala , Sr.s.t.i is done / happens . The Du.hkha / Sukha etc , i.e. both good and bad , are the results of their individual Karma , which one cannot escape .  
  
If this theory is not accepted then one has to offer a convincing reply as to why all the people are not alike . So strong is KarmasiddhAnta .  
  
Hiran.yatvam na jahAti - here also 'tattvam' (Brahmatvam) na jahAti
PrAn.I . If one kills the Ajn\~Anam with the help of Jn\~Anam then he (jIvAtmA ) would merge into ParamAtmA , i.e. Moks.a , or relief from the bindings of SAmsAra / cycle of birth and death .
