Sir, thank you so much for providing useful information on **mAyA** from various sources. This mail answers many doubts about mAyA.  
  
Would you please also provide the reference books for first and second quotations.  **"MAyA** is the **S'akti** /capacity of **Brahman .** The **Jagat** , which is a false form **(mithyAsvarUpam**) of **Brahman** is the **'KAryam' of MAyA**."  
  
 and

  
  
"**MAyA** conceals the real form of **Brahman** and exhibits **Brahman** in a different form (**jagat)**."  
  

With deep regards and thanks,
