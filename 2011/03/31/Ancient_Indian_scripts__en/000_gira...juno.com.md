Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Ancient history of India (before 326 BC)



(1) In recent postings on BVP, subject of Swastika appeared. I was looking into the book, “A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India” by Delhi University lady professor-Upinder Singh. The book is nicely printed with many colorful plates of pottery pieces, ancient coins and Harappan seals with Indus valley signs. I did not find Swastika sign on any of the pottery pieces, or coins or Harappan seals presented in the book. I am puzzled. Please suggest me another book if possible that offers evidence of Swastika sign on ancient artifacts dating. In the known history after 1 AD India may have Swastikas. I remember Dr. Kalyanraman was talking about Swastika glyph.



(2) Now the topic on Brahmi script appeared on BVP list. I assume (please correct me if I were wrong) there was no Devanagari script at the time of PaNini. We have Indus –Harappan signs (may be 3000 BC). Then we have Kharosti and Brahmi before Devanagari and that too not before 500 BC. Was any inscription-short or long discovered that can be dated to the interim period? On the other hand in 1350 BC there was Cuneiform writing on mud tablets in the Middle East countries. Assuming that the ancient India had trade contacts with Middle East, any cuneiform tablets found in excavations in India? In recent posting of Dr. Pandurangi on Ranjit Pal article, Ranjit Pal is interested moving some part of ancient subcontinent history beyond Baluchistan into the ancient land of Persia. In that case some ancient Indian scholars, Bauddha Bhikkus-somebody might have come across Cuneiform script. The question is-any Cuneiform inscription tablets unearthed within the boundary of the subcontinent-specifically in the region now called the West Pakistan



(3) Assuming that there was no script for Sanskrit at the time of PaNini, and Yask (before Panini) were all grammars by PaNini and his predecessors composed orally and taught orally? That would be amazing feat.



(4) A king from Kerala around 1000 BC had trade contacts with Jewish king Solomon. There are Tamil words in Old Testament. Was any archeological excavations undertaken in Kerala to find out traces of some kind of writing in 1000 BC? Please enlighten us so we grow in our knowledge with you. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
