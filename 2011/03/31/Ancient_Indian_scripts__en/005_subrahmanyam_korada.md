Thje conclusions were given clearly - Lipi was there along with Language and Oral tradition has been there i,e. it is alive today .  
  
No doubt , Vyakaran.am is about spoken language .  
  
I was trying to show that Pan.ni and his predecessors had had the knowledge of Lipi and there were Lipikaras/Lipikaries . The Lipi at that time was related to Sanskrit and , may be, other languages too .  
  
I was answering the question of Prof Joshi etc.- whether Panini etc knew about Lipi or not .  
We do not have evidence to exhibit that Sanskrit at the time of Panini did not have Lipi at all .  
  
The second question was about oral tradition - still some Westerners (even some Indians , who follow them) are skeptical about the MedhAs'akti of Indian scholars . This had led them to comment that there were two or three Kalidasas etc .
