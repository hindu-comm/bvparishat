Namaste.  
Tara Prakashana, a not for profit trust in Bengaluru, has bought 18 copies of  
mahAbhArata tAtparya nirNaya of Shri Madhvacharya, edited by Shri Bannanje  
Govindacharya. This is a two volume monumental work. Tara Prakashana would  
like to donate these to university libraries in India or abroad, where significant work  
is being done in Sanskrit language and literature.  
If you are associated with an institution that fits our goals, please contact me so that we  
can get the contact information of the appropriate librarian at your institution.  
Thanks in advance for your help.  
Regards..  
Mukund
