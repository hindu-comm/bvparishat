Namaste,  
  
I'm a student persuing Ph.D in computational linguistics at International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H). Our aim is to explore the applications of traditional Sanskrit concepts from Vyakarana, Nyaya, Mimansa etc. in the area of computational linguistics. Currently we are studying discourse analysis. One of the goals of discourse analysis is to determine taatparya of the whole discourse. In this connection, I think this book will be useful for our task. I'm coping this mail to the head of our library. Please send a copy to our library.
