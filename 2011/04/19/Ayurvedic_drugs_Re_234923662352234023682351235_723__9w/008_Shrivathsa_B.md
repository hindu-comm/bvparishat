hariH OM,  
Mr. Joshi,

  
  
"Some lectures on Ayurveda are boring. They start with Kapha, Pitta, Vaata and then describe Panchakarma-starting with Enema etc. That turns me off. However somebody like you describe chemical composition and use, then people get interested to know more."  
  

 I don't know what is the problem in accepting vAta pitta kapha as starting axioms of a logically consistent system. If a person is not comfortable in listening to these terms, he should probably not be listening to the lecture on Ayurveda at all. A person who is not comfortable in listening to dialectic materialism, should not attend a class / lecture on communism / socialism.  
  
 I have never heard Ayurvedic practitioners start with Panchakarma. If you have a problem in listening to this, then probably you have to undergo pa\~ncakarma to experience its beneficial effects. What if somebody gave you the chemical composition of an enema and gave you the same? Will the benefit of the enema increase then? By the way, do you know the chemical compositions of all the drugs you take for your cold, cough, backacke, stomach ache etc.?  
  
 People get interested to know more if they have experienced first hand the benefits of a system. Not due to the jargon of a specific kind used in describing the way the benefit accrues. If you mentioned the "describe-the-chemical-composition-than-talk-about-vAta-pitta-kapha" thing as a measure to "market" Ayurveda in a better way, it may be grudgingly accepted. I am very uncomfortable with discussions where it is the duty of a great system (like Ayurveda) to come down to the level of another system groping in the dark (allopathy). The only "problem" with Ayurveda seems to be that, inspite of the superstitions of vAta, pitta and kapha, it works!!! and the "scientists" cannot understand as to how it is so!!!

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
