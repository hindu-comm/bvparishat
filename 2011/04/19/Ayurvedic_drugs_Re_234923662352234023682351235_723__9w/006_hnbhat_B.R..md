I think you have received some information from some sources.

  

Anyhow, I am not acquainted with Ayurveda at all, but as an invariably provided accessory Chapter called dravya-guNadhyAya - the properties of individual substances I remember having seen in all the major works of Ayurveda, though they may be strictly in comparison to modern pharmacology. And special texts and lexicons (specialized) like Raajanighantu, Bhavaprakasha, are also sources of information on the property of each item listed by them (used in Ayurveda texts). Here is the link to Bhavaprakasha:

just grabbed with google hand. Here is the link something related to Ayurvedic Pharmacology:

I have not checked the link as I am not interested. Presently I am reviewing a work called Dravya-GuNa-Shata-shloki - a handbook containing 103 verses describing qualities of substances of every day use. A good commentary is provided drawing on the vast literature on the topic to discuss the attribute assigned in the original text.

  

In each Ayurvedic College, there should be a department of Pharmacology named Dravya-GunNa-department:

As given in the web page above designed to be updated with modern pharmacology. It is a desirable thing like the medical colleges make use of modern technology and science (I am sure some should be doing so already sincerely) available to improve their services.

  

There too as in many others, commercialization of the products to attract foreigners in Kerala (may be elsewhere) degrading the value of the science it deserve (one of which is Panchangakarma). I remember having read some article with this point of exploiting foreign tourists highlighted. And the same can be said of the crash courses for Ayurveda, Yoga for the Europeans attracted by these words as the one page provided above online.
