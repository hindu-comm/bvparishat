If I remember, there are two types of loha: general and Sinca which is a refined type of loha. It was perhaps, in the MBH. Blade belongs to that type of loha. Of course, a number of varieties have different qualities including stainless steel. Its medicinal properties should be further investigated. In homeopathy, I could not find any detail properties except Ferrum Met + its compounds. Regards, spnarang
