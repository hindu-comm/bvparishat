Sanskrit VidvatparisHad may better keep themselves aloof of wellorganised propaganda against Ayurvedic medicines by interested commercial world.Welltrained chemists and wellinformed Ayurvedic experts may conduct objective research on the various Ayurvedic preparations,herbs,metals,edibles etc etc and come to some definite conclusions.But they should also pay proper attention to "Prabhaava" aspect of Dravyas and GuNas.A plant is more than the sum total of its parts.The analytic identification of "active ingredients"may not always be acceptable to the sideeffect free Ayurvedic tradition .Ayurvedic business world too should not only be honest but also prove that they are honest.We should also think of a foolproof honest Govt machinery for certification of various medicines before they go to the market;expirydate should also be invariably mentioned in each of the preparations.If someone wrongly prepared lauhabhasma from razors it is the patient or the person concerned who is to blame.We cannot generalise something on the basis of such isolated wrongdoers and blame Ayurveda therefor.I have seen several patients suffering from nightblindness being benefited by genuine lauhabhasma.
