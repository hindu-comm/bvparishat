As people think that homeopathy has no side-effects similarly they say that Ayurveda has no side-effect. If there is no side-effect, there shall not be effect. It is an art to take the medicine/plant ingredients with experience and in its quantity. Otherwise even the plant like neem may generate adverse effects. similar case is with plants with milk. They must be taken after experiment only. Otherwise they will defame Ayurveda. It applies to all the systems of medicines. Regards, spnarang
