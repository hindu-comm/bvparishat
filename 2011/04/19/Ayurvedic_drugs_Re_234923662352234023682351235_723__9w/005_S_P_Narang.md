Many of the Ayurveda doctors explain their system and after that they prescribe their patent medicines available in market and donot exhibit the art of this science. naayaM sthaanoraparaadhaH yadenamandhaH na pas'yati. Moreover, we do not apply the general scientific rules and laws while prescribing the medicine. Their season and increase and decrease in quantity must be prescribed. But a doctor on shop is concerned with Artha and not Ayurveda. It should have a nexus to Dharma: we will get fruitful results. Regards, spnarang
