Dear Dr. Yadu,



Thanks for this scientific posting. I heard several times in India that Mercury is Veerya of Shiva. I never understood its meaning. Also I see in elementary Ayurvedic books description of Lohabhasma, Suvarnabhasma etc.and their use on certain bodily functions. I do not remember seeing anywhere chemical composition given of these Ayurveda drugs. We need scientists like you who have modern knowledge of Chemistry, Pharmacy and knowledge of Ayurvedic drugs. Then things fall in right place.



Some lectures on Ayurveda are boring. They start with Kapha, Pitta, Vaata and then describe Panchakarma-starting with Enema etc. That turns me off. However somebody like you describe chemical composition and use, then people get interested to know more.



Lately Americans are realizing importance of spices we use in cooking. I noticed one time that American lady teaching nutrition does not know much about turmeric powder. Now all doctors came to know use of turmeric. An American lady scientist was not ready to eat cardamom I gave to her. She never saw it. Some Americans never eat nutmeg powder, even ginger. Your efforts to offer uscorrect information is commendable using your diversified knowledge of both Eastern and Western traditions. Thanks again. N.R.Joshi

Namaste Dr. Shrivatsa:

 with reference to your statement:  
""Medically , it is believed that, the water which touches gold is good for health ."



  


I am not aware of any such reference. Could you please provide any specific documentation for this?"

Unquote:

Above statement is not mine.

I am aware of other compounds of Gold. I was only relating to bhasma.
All others Bhasma are oxides therefore I commented on bhasma as Gold Oxide. I wanted to elude toward this point to the Sanskrit scholars for their opinion on why specific terminologies were not used? Personally, more specific one can be better we may e able to relate and appreciate our ancient texts. Science, determines and then identifies single entity of compound only after knowing the structure. What our ayurvedaacharys, proscribed was based on their own observations and had not determined or established "Structure - Function" relationship. Many of their observations were correct but knowledge is dynamic and not static.  
  
What makes the matter worse is that current manufacturers do not really follow ancient procedures either. One example I had provided in my earlier post about "loha bhasma" from Wilkinson and 7"0clack" razor blades. (that contains Hexa valent - Chromium and is extremely toxic.)  




  
Another good example is Chavanprash. Indian manufacturers have never taken initiative to analyze heavy metals Mercury, Lead, Cadmium and Arsenic using current methodology (such as, ICP-MS). Once you see the analytical results, I can guarantee that you will never touch them with a ten foot pole. None of theses products meet the safety requirements established as per California PROP-65. That is why on one is even trying to import it from India. I have personally analyzed evaluated the data for few clients from India, after looking at them all have abndoned the idea of ever trying to market in US. I have also developed a process that would reduce the heavy metals by a factor of almost 100, essentially almost eliminate them from the product. Attempts to scale-up the process in is works but have been placed on the back burner for lack of funds. Manufacturers rather spend money on getting endorsements from movie stars, like Sharuk Khan and Amithabh.  
  
Even the process of making Amla paste, that is used for Chavanprash is not correctly followed, as most Indian manufacturers use Stainless Steel glass lines vessels. Originally Amla was cooked on a cast Iron metal sheet before adding any other ingredients. The reason for this was to reduce the Chelating effect of tannins on Iron and make product safer for vegetarians, who often suffer from Iron deficiency.. For this reason Trifala is not recommended for extended period. Here, I just wanted to point out that current manufacturing practices do not follow ancient tradition.  
  
Please do not try to convince anyone, especially me about Mercury Bhasma. It is amazing why Ayurvedic proponents are never prepared to document acute and chronic toxicity beats me? I have collected over 1000 research papers on this subject. Even if it proves to have some medicinal value is it worth to disregard the toxicity? I am sure, you must be aware that American Dental Association recommends total removal of any Silver/Gold amalgam fillings because of Mercury leaching. Norway has banned Dental amalgum and there is an international movement for the same

Having said all of the above, it is up to an individual what they want to believe by concentrating of "paroksha j\~naa" and shraddhaa, while ignoring documented evidence by the science.  
  
Additional discussion on this subject matter may be beyond the scope of list. Interested individual may contact me off-list.  
  
Best regards,

hariH OM,  
shri yadu,

 I like to submit that water preserved in copper and gold vessels for a certain length of time hold have lesser disease causing bacteria. Gold ions in water (even in minute quantities) are known to kill disease causing bacteria.

 In my opinion, you are trying to make the equation of "bhasma = oxide" which is not right. svarNa bhasma is svarNa bhasma, it is not Aurum oxide. You need to understand the efficacy of svarNa bhasma through the traditions of Ayurveda.  
  
 Mercury, which is another "heavy metal" does indeed have beneficial effects on patients. There is something in the process of making the bhasma which makes it beneficial. And we have to keep in mind that these "heavy metals" are given when certain bodily functions are hampered. You need to measure the effect of certain body functions being hampered against the effect of these "heavy metals".  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
