Thanks Prof.Narang forVery right and timely point raised during the discussion who are mostly the consumers of the products.

  

The lack of sincerity to the profession and the devotion to the science is the root cause of the present state of abuse of Ayurveda in addition to the globalization and commercialization of the products. It is not for Ayurvedic science especially, but it generally applies to all professions utilizing the science. Unlike west, where the overspecialization in each medical science is the characteristic of time, Indigenous medicinal systems are far behind the concept of specialization in each section which would facilitate the deeper study separately including Pharmacology.

  

Thanks for the timely quote. Another quote proper one:

  

यस्य कस्य तरोर्मूलं यत्र कुत्रापि पेषयेत्।

यस्मै कस्मै प्रदातव्यं यद्वा तद्वा भविष्यति॥

  

With pardons from Practitioners of Ayurveda, if any in the group.

  

"सैषा पुरुषगर्हा, न शास्त्रगर्हा।" (Nirukta 1.14)

  

  

But these and similar statements, do not prove that there was any research conducted on the effects of medicines as expected by Prof. Yadu. except those already recorded in the medical texts. The reason may be that the Vaidya himself is expected to be aware of the effects and side effects of the medicines produced by him on the physical properties of the patient as presumed by you.
