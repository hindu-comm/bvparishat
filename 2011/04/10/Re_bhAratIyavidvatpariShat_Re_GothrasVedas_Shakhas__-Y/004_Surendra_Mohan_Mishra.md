**NamassabhAyai ! Namaskar Dr Moharir ji.  
The prav.rtti-nimitta and vyutpatti-nimitta both can be traced back in our great literature and popular usage.An interesting question is raised by you as to since when is there the custom of folding hands in prayer,gratitude or showing respect !  
Normally 'paNa vyavahAre stutau ca' in PANini's DhAtupATha clearly suggests as to how the hands are functioning.VyavahAra means give and take which is done by hands in a definitive manner.In usages of 'pANi-grahaNa' or 'pANi-pIDana' or pANig.rhItI dAna and AdAna of a bride are meant.Cf. also 'dAnena pANir na tu kankaNena' etc.  
DayAnanda in his UNAdiko.sa at 4.133 : *as'ipaNAyyor ruDAyalukau ca* says : paNAyati vyavaharati yena sa pANi.h hasto vA.  
In Vedic recitation 'yathA vANI tathA pANi.h' is the rule.Here the indication made is a kind of vyavahAra.  
In the BhAgavata : 'karau harer mandira-mArjanAdi.su' -- here again this is s'lAghA or vyavahAra.  
The philosophical systems that believe in separate organs of action accept hands as one such sense organ.But for the NaiyAyika-s the whole body is organ of action and pANi is another part of body with definite action and not a sense organ.The commentator VAtsyAyana at one place says how the body is engaged in meritorious deed through ' dAna.m,paritrANam and paricaraNam'.Obviously dAna at least is the function of hands.  
Warm regards,
