**nama.h pari.sade !  
  
The discussion on SatyanArAyaNa and pANi by Prof. Korada and Dr Yadu Moharir is interesting.I may humbly add :   
In the Puru.sasUkta 'atyati.sThad das'Angulam' is also taken to mean the man with 10 fingers,of course in the hands.The hands in VedAnta are evolutes of the rAjasika part of VAyu and in SAmkhya of the AhankAra.  
  
The Atharva Veda has one mantra that earlier God was 'apANipAda',i.e. without hands and feet,a mantra sometimes referred to while describing the form of Lord JagannAtha of PurI who has neither hands nor feet.  
  
'Satya' and 'NArAyaNa' occur in the Vi.s.nusahasranAma' but separately.The practice of SatyanArAyaNa PUjA must be after the advent of the Muslims,and must be in the spirit of social and religious harmony.Aulia,Peer and FakIr are great titles in Sufism.Satya Peer or SatyanArAyaNa which is earlier,only a study of contemporary literature can bring out.In Kashmir Nunda .Ri.si tried to build a bridge between the .Ri.si tradition in Hinduism and the Sufi tradition as the objectives were the same.Now also the Nunda Rishi Chair is very much existing in name on the campus of Kashmir University,Srinagar.
