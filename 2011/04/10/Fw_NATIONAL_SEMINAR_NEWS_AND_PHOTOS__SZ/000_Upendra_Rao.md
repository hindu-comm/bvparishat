Here are a few briefs from different speakers.



**Professor Piyus Kanti Dixit, **

**Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapith, New Delhi **



Speaking on Anandasutram, he said that this main philosophical treatise of Shrii Shrii Anandamurtijii stresses on practising regular Sadhana, Yama and Niyama etc which is connected with spiritual heritage of Indian philosophies –yet his exposition has a modern vision befitting the present times. The Anandasutram appears to be influenced by Shivasutra, Yogasutra –but its reference to present times makes it easily understandable for new generations. He said that in his opinion the Shivasutra, Yogasutra etc have become too much huge because of so many commentaries and opinions expressed on them and as such difficult to understand. So this brief and scientific exposition in form of sutras by Anandamurtijii was a kind of compulsion. It should be openly accepted that in present times Anandasutram is the first effort worth mentioning where complete philosophy is expressed in form of sutras.



**Professor Virsagar Jain, HOD, Jainism, **

**Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapith, New Delhi**

****

Speaking on 2^(nd) Chapter of Anandasutram, Professor Virsagar Jain said in 2^(nd) chapter Sutras Anandamurtijii deals with what is happiness. Anandamurtijii says that the happiness is mutually sympathetic waves –the waves emanating from a crude object or any mind entity and the waves of the person concerned –if they are complimentary then that would give happiness to that person. All the living beings want happiness and it is their natural wont. But human being is aspiring for unending happiness –the real happiness that is available only in Brahma. To make determined efforts to get this happiness is Dharma of humanbeing.



**Upendra Rao, Associate professor, Special centre for Sanskrit Studies, JNU**

****

While speaking on philosophy of Shrii Shrii Anandamurtijii as expressed in Anandasutram, Professor Upendra Rao pointed out that while many other phisophies have stressed on Pain and Misery in the world, Anandamurtijii ‘s approach is muh more optimistic. The pessimism in philosophic approach has detached us from material resources and we lag behind in that area. Too much pessimism is bad. Anandamurtijii has taken care of this issue.



**Professor Vachaspati Upadhyaya**

**Vice Chancellor, LBSRSV, New Delhi**



While inaugurating the seminar, Professor Upadhyay told the gathering that long back he happened to interact with one research scholar of philosophy –Shri Ladli Prasad Bhargav –an elderly student. When he entered the residence of Ladli Prasad, he saw the photo of Anandamurtijii –his Guru. That time he could never imagine that he would be speaking in a seminar on the philosophy of this great
philosopher in this university where professors from JNU, Delhi University and Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth would be participating..



Professor R.C. Sharma

Delhi University.



Professor Sharma spoke on Anandamurtijii as a linguist. He said that there is a wrongly placed belief that Sanskrit is the mother of all languages. But he found that Anandamurtijii was very clear on this point. Although he respected Sanskrit language for its rich vocabulary, he never professed any such belief.



He further said that according to Anandamurtijii, languages differ from each other but there is a definite link with each other . he has explained this point with numerous examples.
