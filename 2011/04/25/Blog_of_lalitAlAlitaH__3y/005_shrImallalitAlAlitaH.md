We have implemented a script(aksharamukha from Virtual Vinodh), which can display Sanskrit text in multiple scripts.

Although my website doesn't have much to read, the other site which I manage(website of Late P R Ramamurthy Ji) has big number of texts available. The availability of those texts in multiple scripts may help people read them easily.
