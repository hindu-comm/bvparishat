Dear Scholars,  
  
Garga and Parashara are famous in many puraNas. Mahabharata refers to  
Garga as a person who knew about Utpatas, which might have included  
comets. Varaha mihira refers to the above in his Brishatsamhita. Both  
names are linked with the Rigveda also. References are available from  
Smriti and Astrology literature which I have collected.  
  
But I understand that PaaNini and/or Patanjali refer to the above as  
astronomers. I am looking for references to the above in Vedic,  
VyaakaraNa and Nyaaya literature. I would be thankful for any further  
information on Garga, Vriddha Garga, Gaargiya; Parashara, vriddha  
parashara, paaraasharya etc as personalities and their works.  
  
Regards  
  
RN Iyengar
