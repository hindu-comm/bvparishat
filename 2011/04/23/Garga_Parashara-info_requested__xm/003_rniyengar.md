I am looking for specific information with Sanskrit quotes/references.  
General information is available in plenty on line. Coming again to my  
point SB Dikshit the first person to write a definitive History of  
Indian Astronomy (Marathi transl into English by RV Vaidya 1969, IMD,  
Govt. of India) on p88 vol.1 writes "...Garga occurred a number of  
times in Patnajala mahabhashya; and one comes across the names of  
Parashara and Garga even in PaaNini (see 4-3-110, 4-10-105 etc)"  
I could not locate the two names together in the Ashtadhyaayi. Perhaps  
these are available in related texts. Hence the request.
