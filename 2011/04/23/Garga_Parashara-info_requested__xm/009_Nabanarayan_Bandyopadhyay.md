Dear Prof. Mishra,

  

For detailed account of Garga the following book may be consulted:

  

Sarmah, Thaneswar (1991). The Bharadaajas in Ancient India. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.

  

In this connection, I would like to refer to a Shrauta Ceremony called Garga Triraatra also. For cursory study of the said book the following site may be visited:

  

[books.google.co.in/books?isbn=8120806395](http://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=8120806395)

  

Best  

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
