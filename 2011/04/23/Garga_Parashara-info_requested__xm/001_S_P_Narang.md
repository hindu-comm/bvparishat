Have you ever thought that Gargas may have been inhabitants of Rajasthan and  
belonged to Saarthavaaha profession as well. Panini oto gaargyasya is an  
evidence to the phonetics and people from Saalaaturiiya to Rajasthan  
particularly Sansii tribe had been regularly doing trade. gargaan s'ataM  
dandayati is also related to tax-evaders. I compared a few points in the context  
of Panini and it is in continuity. Your ideas and evidences with regards to  
their land are most welcomed. Regards, spnarang
