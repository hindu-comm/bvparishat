Dear Iyengar,

  

Thanks for your inquiry and probe into the details.

  

In fact, you had already mentioned the relevant Sutra-s where you find the references in Grammar Ashtadhyayi.

  

> Garga occurred a number of  
> times in Patnajala mahabhashya; and one comes across the names of  
> Parashara and Garga even in PaaNini (see 4-3-110, 4-10-105 etc)"  
> I could not locate the two names together in the Ashtadhyaayi.

  

as you have already quoted the relevant Sutra-s by numbers. You wanted to locate two names together. It is the second Sutra you have cited by number 4-1-105in the Ashtadhyayi which reads गर्गादिभ्यो गोत्रे. And the members to be gathered by Aadi as in this Sutra are listed separately than Ashtadhyayi called गणपाठ traditionally ascribed to Panini and usually in later grammar texts as one of the accessories to Paninian Grammar in General. That too collected in the same order as the Sutra-s having "Adi" specifying the scope of the the application of the function to a group of selected words, which occurs in several places as the present one. It is taken up in the commentaries including Bhashya, etc. on Ashtadhyayi and other works dealing with the respective Sutra-s. Thus, Garga is the first member in the group, while Parashara finds place in the same group. You can check the sequence in the group as given by Kashika, a later commentary:

  

<http://www.avg-sanskrit.org/avgupload/sutras/4-1-105.html>

  

I was about to post this, but you wanted the association of the two names together and hence I didn't post it. It is this compendium of the गण-पाठ invariably consulted for explaining the relevant Sutra-s. This Parashara, is explained as the father of Vedavyasa. Both names are in the same in the list and that is the only relationship you can get from their citation together here. And nothing more to add to their identification.

  

I refrained from posting, as I am not sure whether the association would serve any purpose you are expecting. To be frank, they would not throw any light as to their identification as astronomers or Smriti- writers because the topic is out of the scope of Grammar as you also might be aware. By the way, you may be aware that it was one Astrologer Garga who performed the नामकरण of Krishna, and Balarama on their birth. as per Bhagavata Purana. (Sakandha 10.Ch.8 verses 1-20). And the first lady philosopher too belonged to the lineage of Garga, i.e. गार्गी, who participated in debates of Janaka (I don't have the exact references) and engaged in dispute with our Great Yajnavalkya. The result I am not sure. The episode is popular, though any Garga is not mentioned in Rigveda.

  

With regards
