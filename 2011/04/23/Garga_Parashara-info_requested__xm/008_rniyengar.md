Dear Bhat,  
Many thanks for the detailed post with references and explanations.  
The info is useful. I am aware of the PuraNa references to Garga  
including the one in the Bhagavata. I find references in the Matsya  
PuraNa and the MBh are directly concerning the Garga who was an  
astronomer. About Parashara the references to him as astronomer are  
from Brihatsamhita, Utpala and Ballalasena. When I said the names are  
linked with RV I meant the rishi of hymn RV(6.47) is Garga  
Bharadwaja. Similarly hymns (1.65 & 9.97) are attributed to Parashara.  
However the latter name appears directly in the mantras of the 7th  
book.  
  
regards  
  
RN Iyengar
