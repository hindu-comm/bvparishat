Dear Sir,  
Thanks for your answer but it is too cryptic for me. Pardon my  
ignorance. I am not well versed in the texts you mention. Please let  
me know where I can find the details of the 'pAt.ha'. I would be  
grateful for further detailed references. There are astronomical texts  
attributed to to both Parashara and Garga. I am wondering whether  
grammar texts provide some lateral evidence for this.

Namaste

RN Iyengar
