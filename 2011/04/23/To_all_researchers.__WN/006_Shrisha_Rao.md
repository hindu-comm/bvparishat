The लक्षालङ्कार actually has about 2000 verses (64000 ग्रन्थs) but is called so because it is an exposition on the entire Mahābhārata of one lakh verses.

I am not aware that the exact Mahābhārata text used by Śrī Vādirāja has been preserved at Sode or anywhere else. As far as I know, there is no authentic and full collection of Śrī Vādirāja's स्तोत्रs (he is said to have composed hundreds, of which only some fifty-odd are to be found in published collections) or even a full text of his subcommentary on the तैत्तिरीय उपनिषत् (of which only an abruptly-ending fragment is to be seen in published works).

Generally, it has been observed that the Southern recension of the Mahābhārata (cf. Krishnacharya's Kumbakonam edition) is most aligned with the लक्षालङ्कार, but there are instances where Śrī Vādirāja cites some Northern verse that is not seen in the Southern recension; there are also some (relatively few) instances where the precise verse or reading referenced in the लक्षालङ्कार is not seen in the major recensions.
