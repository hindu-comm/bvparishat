Thanks to Sri Jagannatha.S for the examples.  
\>quoted several times  
The true value of the quotation lies in the context in which the observations  
are made by Sri Madhvacharya wherein he says how he has studied देशे देशे  
and verified the different versions to arrive at the non corrupt text for his purpose of तात्पर्यनिर्णय: ।  
For all those who want to work on Sri Mahabharatam from various angles the text under discussion  
is a veritable source book. Indeed, it has to be studied in original without the help of English.  
Hence I quoted the select verses.
