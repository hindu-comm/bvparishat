Namaste.

  
  
\>the text available in the commentary Lakshalankara.  
  

LakshAlankAra, as far as I know, is an independent work of Sri Vadiraja Yati  
of Sode Mutt, Udupi. It is, as the name suggests, select one lakh difficult words from  
Sri Mahabharatam commented upon by him and offered as alankAra for Shri Krishna.  
This was to fulfill the promise made by his mother to offer unaffordable laksha  
alnkAra ( in gold, perhaps, as thought by her) as a token of gratitude to Shri  
Krishna for having blessed her with a male child(Sri Vadiraja). He consoled his  
mother through such a rare alankAra offering.  
  
Is the query on the availability of the version of Sri Mahabharatam used/referred to by Sri Vadiraja?  
If yes, then Sode Mutt, Udupi is to be contacted.
