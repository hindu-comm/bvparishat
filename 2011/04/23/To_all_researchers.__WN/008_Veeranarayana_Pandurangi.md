this lakshankara is published in a new and full version by  
mahabharatasamshodhana pratishthanam banglore,three volumes in around  
three thousand pages. I have also rendered a little service for that  
book as a member of review commitee.

copies can be had from  
mahabharatasamshodhana pratishthanam  
1/E, III cross, Girinagar, banglore, [www.mahabharata.org](http://www.mahabharata.org)

as noted in critical apparatus of that book the version followed by  
Vadirajatirtha sometimes follows kumbhakona versions, but many times  
it differes from it. but the readings accepted by Vadiraja are to be  
found in many of manuscrips selected by BORI for critical edition.  
But it seems that there was a tulu/Malayalam recension of mahabharata  
that is followed by Vadiraja. Even Many old MB codices are available  
in Udupi mathas and Subrahmanya matha on which Prof. PS Sheshagiri  
acharya of Mysore is working for a vaishnava patha. Prof. PS  
Sheshagiri acharya earlier worked on Bhagavata's vaishnva recension,  
which was also based on Tulu manuscripts of Subrahmanya matha, which  
is published by poornaprajna samshodhana mandiram, bangalore.
