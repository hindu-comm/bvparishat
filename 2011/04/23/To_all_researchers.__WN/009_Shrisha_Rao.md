\> this lakshankara is published in a new and full version by  
\> mahabharatasamshodhana pratishthanam banglore,three volumes in around  
\> three thousand pages. I have also rendered a little service for that  
\> book as a member of review commitee.  
\>  
\> copies can be had from  
\> mahabharatasamshodhana pratishthanam  
\> 1/E, III cross, Girinagar, banglore, [www.mahabharata.org](http://www.mahabharata.org)

This is even available from the Poornaprajna Vidyapeetha bookstore itself, which may be more familiar to many.
