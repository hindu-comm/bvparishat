\> as noted in critical apparatus of that book the version followed by  
\> Vadirajatirtha sometimes follows kumbhakona versions, but many times  
\> it differes from it. but the readings accepted by Vadiraja are to be  
\> found in many of manuscrips selected by BORI for critical edition.  
\> But it seems that there was a tulu/Malayalam recension of mahabharata  
\> that is followed by Vadiraja.

Sri P.P.S.Shastri mentions the above in his preface to the sabha-parva  
Vavilla Edition of Mahabharata (printed in 1930). Some Mss found in TN  
also have pratiikas quoted by Sri Vadiraja. While discussing the  
question - which is more genuine text, the Southern one with its 4511  
stanzas or the Northern one with its 2511 stanzas - he refers to -  
many pratikas being culled out by Sri Vadiraja and also Nannayya in  
his Andhra-bharatamu.

The editor states further - "Not all pratikas of the Lakshalankara are  
traceable in our printed text. But most of them could be easily  
identified either in the Principal Text or atleast in some additional  
readings given. A careful examination of the Lakshalankara leaves no  
room for doubt that Vadiraja's text of the Mahabharata should have  
certainly approximated more in the Southern Rescension than to any  
other and the Text printed by us should substantially have been  
similar to what Sri Vadiraja might have had before him".

When I looked at the concordance, this edition seemed to have a little  
more than the Kumbhakonam edition, and much more than the BORI  
edition.
