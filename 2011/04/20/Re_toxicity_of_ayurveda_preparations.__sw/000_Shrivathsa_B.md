Dear Shrivathsa,

  

This is a very timely discussion, and I am really grateful to you and Dr Yadu for drawing it to our attention.

  

Please find a detailed response below.

I apologise that it is so long.

I am also preparing a second draft in word.

  

Please note that this constitutes an important application of the non-linear systems theory to biology,

and should therefore be considered an aspect of the 'Holistic Information' program

CONCERNING TOXINS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON BIOSYSTEMS

Let me acknowledge at the outset that toxin impurities in medicines is a subject area which rightfully makes all chemically minded people see red, because the cumulative effects of heavy metal ingestion can be so cruel to the system. I personally would be very cautious before taking a bhasma, despite the mitigating factors which I lay out below.

  

These depend on two aspects of this topic which escape the notice of most scientists: Hormesis and Orrmus - the first, because it is quite obscure, and the second, because it is pretty much still a scientific mystery, and stillalmost unknown. Various kinds of evidence establish them as phenomena beyond doubt, however. Otherwise, I would not discuss them.

  

Hormesis: this is the study of the physiological effects of small quantities of toxins, and shows that, at suitably small dosages (not homeopathic doses), the response of the physiology is highly non-linear. In fact, small doses of toxins seem to have a *beneficial* effect; toxic reactions only begin above a certain minimal threshold of toxin.

  

I recently heard an excellent lecture on the subject by a medical scientist who is the director of a University College, London, hospital. Since I had been wanting to learn more about hormesis for some years, I was extremely attentive, and most interested to learn of the huge amount of research on it that has been carried out over the years. I am sure that Peter Fisher, \<[peter....@uclh.nhs.uk]()\>, will give you helpful references if you email him. He has been marvellous to me on a related subject.

  

The hormesis phenomenon is obviously highly unexpected from a chemical perspective, and means that toxicology is a very complex subject, for which we need to develop completely different ideas, if we are to begin even remotely to understand its depth.

  

As it happens (and this is why I was so interested to hear more), I have been working with Madan Thangavelu on a new conception of physiological regulation which is capable of explaining hormesis, and which we are now satisfied is closely related to several other subject areas: complexity biology, fractal physiology (for which Heart Rate Variability studies offer overwhelming evidence), Ayurveda, and certain other disciplines of complementary medicine.

  

The physical chemistry of the models we are working with is highly unusual, connected to some very obscure physics on which I wrote my PhD thesis, and capable of bringing together these apparently disparate subject areas - including hormesis.

  

The approach Madan and I have been discussing depends on new proposals for howphysiologicalregulation generally works, and how we should think about it. We think that:

\(1\) most if not all physiological processes are under active control - probably, but not necessarily completely, epigenetic control;

\(2\) that the locus of control is probably optimized at the critical feedback points, a condition I named 'critical regulation' in 2004; and

\(3\) many regulatory processes can be held critical simultaneously, as indeed must be the case if the critical regulation condition is to dominate physiological function, so that the critical feedback points become 'critical points of higher order', the topic of my 1972 PhD thesis under H.E. Stanley at M.I..T., and most of the 10 papers that came out of it. 

  

There are several points in favour of this scheme of things, notably a discovery three months ago that (3) can be used to solve a theoretical objection against (2) that has held me up since 2005, and stopped me from publishing the proposal more widely. More generally:

1\. Active control is obviously necessary to optimize function, which would clearly be an evolutionary advantage, and is just an extension of what is already known about homeostasis, but applied more generally to a wider range of physiological processes.

2\. Active control with all three (1) - (3) hypotheses valid would mean that regulatory negentropy (organising power, depending on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the system), could be transferred widely throughout the system.

3\. This in turn means that any physiological process can be incrementally switched up or down (rather than merely being turned on or off) *in response to chemical threats*i.e. toxins.

 In other words, active control of a physiological process, can include a response to the arrival of small quantities of a toxin that switches up the production of the enzyme poisoned by the toxin.

4\. Clearly, such regulatory behaviour would explain Hormesis!!!

  For this reason, I am inclined to take the 'hormesis phenomenon' very seriously, and as one indication of what should be included in the next medical paradigm that must replace the now-defunction 'Genomic Paradigm' of pathology.

5\. In partial support of this, note that most results with microarrays suggest that levels of mRNA'scorresponding to individual enyzmes may vary continuously instead of only being 'On' or 'Off'.

6\. Also in support of this idea are powerful indications that many if not most pathologies can be mimicked by a suitable toxicosis. Let me expand on this idea, because it is quite important:

7\. The genomic paradigm of disease proposed that most if not all diseases are caused by genetic weakness - malfunctioning, or dysfunctional enzymes explainable purely in terms of mutations of the genes concerned. This was derived from the idea that pathology can derive from 'errors in metabolism', and that these are inheritable (because theirgeneticsobey Mendelian laws - an idea which won Sir Archibald Garrod the Nobel Prize).

 However, this can now be seen to be inadequate, because the (epigenetic) misregulation of an enzyme can easily result in a pathology which mimicks the one due to genetic impairment - switching a gene off will cause the same 'error in metabolism', and thus pathological symptoms, as a gene mutated to make its enzyme dysfunctional. 

8\. Hence: pathologies due to 'errors in metabolism' can have origins that are (a) genetic, (b) epigenetic, or (c) toxicological.

Our explanation for Hormesis combines 8(b) and 8(c) with the idea that organisms under epigenetic control, which can compensate for toxicological effects, will necessarily demonstrate survival advantages in natural environments. Please also note:

9\. This explains why consuming herbal preparations is not generally harmful, except in those cases where particular toxins are a major product of their biochemical processes.

 There has recently been a deliberate piece of scaremongering about Ayurvedic medicines by Edzard Ernst at the University of Exeter. He pointed out that since herbs generally contain trace amounts of thousands of biochemicals (secondary and tertiary products of their biochemical pathways), and that at least some of these 'MUST' be toxic, herbs must therefore be dangerous to consume, and we had better stick to good old chemical drugs.

10\. On the contrary, Professor Ernst 'has his knickers in a twist'. Most toxins in herbal preparations will be at levels where they have a hormetic effect.Therefore, far from causing a problem,the presence of the toxins will actually be a stimulus to a person's system, and,in healthy people,should stimulate healing of many kinds to take place.

11\. But this is far from the whole story, problems will still arise when toxins are ingested in quantities where cumulative dose rates exceed the body's capacity for elimination, and where concentrations in the physiology in turn exceed the limits where hormesis can take care of them. It follows that when a chemical drug has any negative influence on a physiological system, being present in doses to which hormesis does not apply, it can only have a negative influence. Applying the concept of hormesis to the situation of whether to use herbal medicines or chemical drugs therefore turns Ernst's reasoning on its head: herbal formulations are much to be preferred.

12\. This principle does not simply apply to toxins, however. The whole structure of Ayurvedic aetiology embodied in shadkriyakala,the six stages of dosha imbalance, can be understood to propose (part of my 'Decoding Ayurveda'program)that the slippery slope to pathology gets going when tolerance limits fornormal, healthy physiological function are exceeded.

13\. Note that in this picture, the susceptibility to pathology depends on these tolerance limits for regulatory feedback control, and this in turn depends on the amount of 'adaptive energy' available.

14\. This shows that our approach is completely consistent with what is generally accepted in CAM about the general health promoting value of particular herbs like Ashwagandha in India, Ginseng in China, and Cordyceps Sinensis in Tibet/Nepal/Sikkim. It provides it with a much firmer scientific basis, and means that we could design programs to scientifically justify the universal ingestion of such preparations as Chyavana Prash.

15\. I was interested to hear that Chyavanaprash has such high levels of toxic elements that you won't touch it,Dr Yadu. Biochemistry is taught in a way which entirely justifies your attitude, and since, as I have pointed out, there are circumstances in which this is the case, I am entirely sympathetic to what you say. I am quite loathe to consume particular bhasmas myself. 

16\. I would be very interested to know more about Dr Yadu's method of eliminating heavy metals from Chyavanaprash, particularly whether it involves methods mentioned in the texts (Charaka etc.). At I-AIM in Bangalore where I have been working, we have discovered tat simply washing the herbs beforehand eliminates over 80-90% of the heavy metal content. If you have found a different method, Dr Yadu, then the two together should combine to produce even greater benefits.

  

This brings me to the second subject mentioned at the outset: Ormus.

17\. This is a very exotic topic concerning heavy metals mostly from Groups 8 and 1b of the Table of Chemical Elements. It islittle knownmostly because no acceptable theory has yet beenpublished. However, references on the web giveevery indication that Ormus really exist, and that they are found in both sea-water, and other saline sources like Dead Sea salts.

18\. An Ormus is apparently a combination of heavy metals, which is as inertchemicallyas a noble gas, but which seems able to stimulate biological growth and health to a huge extent, for reasons which remain an almost complete mystery.

19\. Madan hypothesizes that Ormuses may be formed during bhasma preparation, because synthesis ofeventhe tiniest quantity could explain their otherwise inexplicablemedical benefits. We both feel that Ormus could explain the benefits of Shilajit, and its central Asian cousin, Mumijo.

20\. The weekend before last, I developed a theory of a possible physical structure for Ormus as a class of compounds. It explains many features, but has yet to be tested, and is still under active development (Madan seems to think it is hopeful).However, I am happy to share it, and get your feedback, Dr Yadu / Shrivathsa.

21\. The relevance to this email should be clear: here is a new, scientifically unrecognized, class of heavy metal compounds, that is not simply not harmful, but, when Google 'Ormus' and look at the various websites, particularly 'Subtle energies', of evidently huge benefit tophysiological function.

22\. I also made a couple of suggestions as to why this should be the case: firstly if Ormus exist (which thy evidently do), then they must have been common in the early earth, and enzymes would have been used to functioning in their presence, or even benefiting from it. Secondly, associated with that, they may alter the 'structure of water' (the topic on which Peter Fisher gave me lots of information) in ways that life finds beneficial. Certainly, Ormus provides a way to explain how living organisms managed to get started in such hostile chemical conditions as were present on early earth.

that they may play a hugely important role 

19\. Elements commonly mentioned as forming Ormuses include Rhodium, Iridium, Copper and Gold, but this list is only partial and there is reason to suppose that any heavy metal might form an Ormus if suitably combined. Indeed

  

In summary, I suppose that the simplest way to summarize our central idea is to say that there are two stages by which we are proposing to advance ordinary theories of biological regulation - (a) critical regulation inccorporating (b) higher order critical points, and that these allow many otherwise exotic and poorly understood aspects of modern physiology to gain a straightforward explanations.

  

In particular, they alter our understandings of toxins and how we should approach them.
