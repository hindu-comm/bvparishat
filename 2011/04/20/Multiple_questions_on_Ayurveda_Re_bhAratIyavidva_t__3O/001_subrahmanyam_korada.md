Prof Joshi --  
VedAnta , Jyotis.am and Ayurveda are interconnected - do Ayurvedic Doctors see horoscopes of patients?- Is it common practice ? What they look for in horoscope ? Is Jyotis.am and VedAnta are part of  
Ayurvedic doctor's curriculum ?  
  
Yes , I very well remember the statement made long ago .  
  
The order of **VedAnta - Jyotis.am - Ayurveda is important .  
**  
**KAlidAsa** in **UttarakAlAmr.tam (KAlAmr.tam** of the same author is about **Dharmas'Astr**a) says the following which is an answer to - what does the planetary line up in the horoscope suggest ? --  
  
**pun.yam vApyatha pAparUpamapi vA karmArjitam prAgbhave ..  
**  
whatever **'pun.yam'** (although it is there in thier culture there is no word in English ) and **'pApam**' (sin) is committed during the earlier incarnations ( it is seen in the form of planets , which suggest comfort and grief to the native, i.e. the horoscopee) .  
  
**VedAnta** says - **Brahman** has taken the form of 'universe' thru the capacity of **'MAyA**' in order to see that the beings would face the **Karma** (nemesis) , both good and bad .  
  
It also says - one should face **Karma -- avas'yam anubhoktavyam kr.tam karma s'ubhAs'ubham .  
**  
Then what about **Grahas'Anti - - Japa - Homa - Tarpan.a , etc. prescribed in Upanis.at and Jyotis.agranthas ?**  
It is for **S'Anti and not for NivAran.A** - so that the degree of intensity may be reduced or the patient would get the stamina to sustain .  
  
Any literature that talks about transfer of PApa thru DAnas etc is an **ArthavAda .  
**  
But how to know as to when the **Pun.yaphalam** or the **PApaphalam** will take effect ? And preferably , if it is **PApaphalam** in what form will it effect , i.e. is it in the form of an accident or disease ..?  
  
It is **Jyotis.am** that nswers this question -  
  
take the natal details of the native and prepare the horoscope - the **S'ubhagrahas represent the Pun.yaphala and the PApagrahas the Papaphala .**  
  
The sixth place from ascendant **(Lagnam**) talks of three aspects - **S'atru , Roga and R.na .**  
  
Depending on the lord of the sixth place ,his companion (if any) , the planet that aspects him - we have to predict as to what kind of disease or health problem the native may encounter .  
  
**Guru stands for Kapha(Phlegm) , S'ani - VAta (Gout) , Budha - Pittam(Bile) etc.  
  
S'ukra - blood related , Kuja - bones , joints , Surgical Operation , cuts , burnings , accidents , shocks etc.  
**  
The limbs represented by 12 places of the horoscope --  
  
Lagnam - Body and S'iras  
dvitIya - speech , eyes , face  
tr.tIya - throat , ears , taste  
caturtha - sukham  
pancamam - stomach  
s.as.t.ham - roga , Apada , pId.A  
saptamam - sexual matters  
as.t.amam - mUtrapurIs.advAra  
navamam - bhAgyam  
das'amam - livelyhood  
ekAdas'am - AdAya  
dvAdas'am - dehakArs'yam  
  
Diferent positions , permutations and combinations of planets would suggest different diseases and there is a lot of literature in **Jyotis.agranthas** .  
  
Now the Doctor can (has to ) refer to the horoscope of the patient and with the knowledge of Jyotis.am , can arrive at a conclusion as to where the problem is.So that diagnosis may become easier .  
  
As most of us are aware , the Ayuredic Doctors (most of them) do not know this aspect . So the question of referring to horoscopes does not arise . Much less in their curriculum .  
  
But it was there long long ago - referring to **Jyotis.am - BasavarAjIyam (24 Adhikaran.am) offers quotations from Jyotis.am under Karmavipaka - tacchamanopAya.h --  
**  
**candraks.etre yadA bhaumo jAyate manujastadA I  
raktapittena durnAmno nAnAvyAdhisamAkula.h II (Jyotis's'Astra)  
**  
The person born when **Kuja is in Candra's house** would suffer from **Raktapitta , Ars'as etc .diseases .  
**  
**nIcasthitabhAnudss'A jvaradr.n'nAs'A s'irortikus.t.hA ca I  
bandhanapId.AkArI ks.In.endudas'Api dus.t.aphalI II (KarmavipAkasamgraha.h)  
**  
During the period of **BhAnu in NIca (i.e. when SUrya is in TulA**) and
that of **Ks.In.acandra (i.e. when Candra runs from S'uklAs.t.mI to Kr.s.n.as.t.amI** ) the native will suffer from **jvara - dr.s.t.inas'a - headache - kus.t.ham and other pId.A .
