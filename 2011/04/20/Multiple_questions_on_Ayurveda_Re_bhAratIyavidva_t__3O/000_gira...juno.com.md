Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



(1) To Prof. S.Korada, we always enjoy your postings of balanced views. Now if I remember correctly, one time on this list you posted that Ayurveda, Jyotish and Vedant are interconnected. Please correct me if I quoted you wrongly. Do Ayurveda doctors see the horoscope of patients? Is it common practice? What they look for in horoscope? Is Jyotish and Vedant are part of Ayurvedic doctors' curriculum?

You mentioned positive effect of arsenic on your mother. This is good news. I read that arsenic in well waters of Bangladesh has produced blindness in drinkers of those waters.



2\) Dr. Yadu,a research paper on Medical uses of Gold Compounds is included in one of the postings here. Did you look at it? Do you have opinion on it?



\(3\) I remember Dr. Rani Sadashiv Murthy talked about his father being Ayurvedic doctor.  
. Again Dr. Murthy please correct me if I were wrong. Dr. Murthy do you have any opinion on on-going discussions on Ayurveda from personal experience?



Our aim is to increase correct knowledge no matter what is the source. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

namo vidvadbhyah  
  
Toxicity / Mercury / Arcenic etc - to be disregarded ?  
  
The following discussion may be useful --  
  
TaittirIyopanis.at says -- adyate atti ca bhUtAni , tasmAt annam taducyate iti  
- it is being consumed and it consumes ( the consumer) , therefore it is called 'annam' (ad + kta)  
  
A person grows from a child to a young man while consuming 'annam' and after certain age (say roughly 40) , while consuming the same 'annam'
he ( his body) slowly starts decaying . That'swhy it is called 'annam" .  
  
This is '[upalaks.an.am](http://upalaks.an.am)' ( includes more such examples) .  
  
In other words , a thing may do both good and bad .  
  
Raw pepper, according to Ayurveda , causes phlegm whereas the dry pepper kills phlegm .  
  
Till yesterday the Westerners (also some followers of Indian origin) argued that ' varahInam' (marriage with an elderly girl ) is in no way Medically wrong . Recently some 10,000 people , who underwent such a marriage were interviewed in Switzerland and Ayurveda is vindicated --  
  
bAlA prAn.apradA proktA yuvatI prAn.adhArinI I  
praud.hA karoti vr.ddhatvam vr.ddhA maran.amAdis'et II  
  
-- if you marry too young a girl your longevity will increase , if she is in youth , i.e. suitable , then your longevity will be maintained , if she is older you will lose your vigour quickly and become an oldman ( without resistence etc) , if you go for a lady too older than you then you attract an early death .  
  
The generally prescribed age gap between bride and groom is 3/5/8 years .  
  
There are so many things that are useful in maintaining sound health in ayurvedic treatises .  
  
How did they come to know all these things ? Thru 'Yogipratyaks.a .  
  
It may not be out of place to mention here that my mother , when she was suffering from rheumatic pains etc(s'Ula) she was , as a final attempt , given 'DrAvakam' (Arsenic ?) , that is poisonous . The result predicted was either a stronger body or death . The former prevailed .  
  
Poisonous substances may sometimes be useful as good remedies also . It is for the Vaidya to decide depending on the constitution / strength etc.  
  
Erand.a (laxative ) ,according to Ayurveda , if given to people with weak heart they will die .  
  
Gold may have some substance within, that is not good for general health . But everybody may not have the same experience .  
  
So many kinds of Bhasmas are prescribed in Ayurveda and all of them were not just foolishly done .  
  
In Ayurveda three PramAn.as , viz. Aptopades'a , AnumAna and Pratyaks.a
are taken in Diagnosis and Prognosis . The fact is that the Books are infested with some interpolations .  
  
Age is not a big factor in Ayurveda , i.e. after forty one should undergo Medical check-up regularly etc. are not acceptable .  
  
I do not believe in fever ( am immune to fever) and infections .  
  
If Ojas , which is the cause of Balam , decreases , i.e. Oja.hks.ayam (AIDS ? ) then the body would suffer from even a small cause .  
  
Why then today most of the people suffer from diseases ? Here is (Telugu) BhAgavatam (it is Yugadharma) --  
  
alasulu mandabuddhiyutulu alpatarAyuvu  
lu ugrarogasamkalitulu mandabhAgyulu sukarma  
mulevviyu ceyajAlarI kaliyugamandu mAnavulu ....Atmaku s'Anti munIndra ceppave ?  
  
ugrarogasamkalitulu = suffereing from dreadful diseases (cause is not known)  
  
dhanyo'smi
