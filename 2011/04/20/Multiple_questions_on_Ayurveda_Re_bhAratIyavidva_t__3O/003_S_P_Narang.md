Like the success and failure for the diagnosis of a patient, Jyotisa, if the horoscope is prepared according to the sastra can provide the clue for the disease. It is equally a corroborative evidence. It cannot be claimed that it is beyond doubt. Main symptomps may be according to the Ayurveda or by the machines or by an experienced physician particularly according to the knowledge of MAdhavanidAnam or according to the symptoms of Homeopathy. All the systems should be honoured in the interest of the patient which should be our objective and not our particular sastra. Regards, spnarang
