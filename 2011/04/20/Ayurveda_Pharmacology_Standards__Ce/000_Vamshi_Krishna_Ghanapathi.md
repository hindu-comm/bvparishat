Pranaam  
Respected Scholars!  
  

-   We have heard from Dr.Yadu about the negative effects of heavy
    metals. We were warned by our other doctor friends (Especially
    Nephrologists), long back, about its debilitating effects on the
    kidneys.  
-   Europian Union has banned Ayurvedic Drugs from 1st May 2011, we have
    recently read in the papers. -   Last month, I happened to partake in a Conference, organised by Hyd
    University (JRSA Prasad was the lead organiser). It was named
    AYURYOGA. Similar issues were discussed in the meet. I had raised
    about these issues in the meeting.

Now, after all this (un)fortunate turn of events and eventual discredition of Ayurvedic Drugs; can we go back to the roots?  
Whereas, Department of Ayush, Premier institutes or some other respected scientists, with sympathies on the traditional medicine; inspired and aided by traditional pharmacies/ scholars severally or jointly validate the process, effects and publish the results?  
  
Such validation/ recommendations could help achieve the scale and reduce the cost of Ayurvedic Medicines, which continues to be well above the average Allopathic Med; due to lack of scale (In spite of zero input cost of Research and Development).  
  
Can some enlightened souls of this forum or similar platforms, sincerly start an attemp to set the standards for Ayurvedic Drug Manufacturing process?  
  
Regards  
  
  
With Warm Regards
