Namaste Prof. Ghamapathi:

  

Is there any way you could share any research papers or proceedings of the conference AYURYOGA you mentioned ?  

  

While providing lakshaNa for Ayurveda Charaka explicitly wants the physician to be aware of "hita and ahita" of patients.  

  

hitaahitaM sakhaM duHkhamaaryustasya hitaahitam \|

manaM ca tacca yatroktamaayurvedaH sa uccate \|\| carakasaMhitaa 1.41 \|\|

Meaning - An authoritative text where happiness, sadness, enhancing and decreasing lifespan is discussed is known as Ayurveda.

  

I had already quoted vagbhaTTa in one of my earlier posts.  

  

prayogaH shamayet vyaadhiM yaH anyamanyamudiirayet \| naasau vishuddhaH shuddhastu shamayedyo na kopayet \|\| vagbhaaTTa aShTaa.ngahR^idaya (dhoShokramaNiiyamadhyaaya) 13.16 \|\|  

  

Meaning - A therapy which pacifies disease (symptoms) and gives rise to other diseases (symptoms) in not a pure therapy. The correct one is the one that pacifies without manifestation of other problems.  

  

While trying to glorify ancient inheritance, present day folks seem to be forgetting the current advances of science. especially, Chemistry, Bio-Chemistry, Pharmacology.  

  

You have correctly pointed out that a collaborative efforts are desperately needed for advancing the old observations for the good of community at large.

  

Best regards,

  

Dr. Yadu
