Comment: The glyphic elements used in the two signs are: harrow, horn, body (person).

  

Alternate readings (rebus) based on Kalyanaraman, 2010, I*ndus Script Cipher, hieroglyphs of Indian linguistic area:*

  

aDar 'harrow'; rebus: aduru 'native, unsmelted metal' (Kannada) (p.63, p.69)

mEd 'body' (Kur.)(DEDR 5099); rebus: meD 'iron' (Ho.)(pp.211. 212).

kODu 'horn' (Tu.); rebus: koD 'shed' (G.)(p.52, p.63)

  

The reading is thus of three words from Indian linguistic area: aduru meD koD meaning: native metal, iron shed (workshop).
