Probably it may not be possible to identify the work mentioned simply as "kosa" unless you look into all the available lexicons, after confirming that the quoted portions it are not in in any of the lexicons he has quoted. It may be simply that he didn't remember the name of the kosha, or some thing strange that a lexicon is named as "Kosha" simply without any title proper of its own. The quotations may be or may not be from a single source or different sources without mentioning the name specifically. Depends on how far you will be able to identify them to any available editions of lexicons published so far other than those mentioned by name.
