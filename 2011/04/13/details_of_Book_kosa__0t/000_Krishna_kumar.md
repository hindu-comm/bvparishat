hari Omh, Good morning all of you. I am a new member of Bvparishat. So  
in case of any mistake please excuse me.  
  
Presently i am working in a commentary of Vaiyakarana Siddhanta  
kaumudi. my problem is, so many areas the author has given quotations  
from different texts from Sanskrit literature. In time of cross  
checking I am struck to identify the source of Kosas.  
the author has used 8 names of different kosas.  
1. Amarakosa  
2. Kosha  
3. Dharanikosa  
4. Medini kosa  
5. Samsaravarta Kosa  
6. Viswakosa  
7. Haima Kosa  
8. Halayudha kosa  
  
number 2 named kosa is my problem. The author has used word 'कोशात्'  
and 'कोश' in different areas and it is not amarakosa.. we are getting  
the words like इति अमरकोशात्, इति मेदिनी कोशात्, इति  
विश्वकोशात्. ..but here we are getting कोशात् only. then which kosa it  
is, who is the author. if it is [published.in](http://published.in) this book, the author  
quoted the word kosa more than 78 times. Anybody has any idea about  
related, will be grateful.  
  
thanking You  
  
With Regards  
  
Krishnakumar
