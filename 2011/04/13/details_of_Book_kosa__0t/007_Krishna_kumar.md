hari Omh,

thanks for giving your view sir. starting time i expected like the  
same. but when i transcripted the text and started editing then i come  
to know that the author has repeatedly use all the kosas names, texts  
name, or authors names where ever he quoted. as he has used the names  
of Patanjali, katyayana, kalidasa, bharavi etc and also so many texts  
like prakria sarvaswa, manjusha, praudamanorama etc.. but here author  
has used and repeated the names, same style from starting to end.  
as i have copied this book from a manuscript. One author will not use  
different style in one book. may be it can be acceptable if he use  
same style with other texts too. other wise the text has to be done by  
different authors. but this is single author text.

thanking You  
with regards  
krishna
