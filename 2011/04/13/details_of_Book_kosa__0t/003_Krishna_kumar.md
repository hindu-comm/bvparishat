hari Omh,  
  
thank you sir for your good in time support and guidence.. i had collected maximum lexicons and cross checked as much as i can.  
  
as per your advice i have some confusions.  
  
First, its not possible to accept that the author may didn't remember the text name because he has not written kosa word one time, he has repeated the same word कोश and कोशात् more than 75 times.. is it possible that a person he has written a complete commentary of Vaiyakarana Siddhanta kaumudi will forget the name of a kosa. may b one time it may be happens.. but more than 75 times repeating the same word is not possible sir. you can see this example as his style of writing..  
  

‘लिङ्गं ललामञ्च ललाम च’ इति कोशः। as he has given the कोश for word ललाम and the next sentence he has given  

ललाम पुच्छपुण्ड्राश्वभूषाप्रधान्य केतुषु इत्यमरः’ । if the Kosa and amara kosa is one then why he is giving two time in all area.

  

second, he has not quoted one kosa, he has quoted more than 7-8 kosas and given the name of kosa like

'योनौ जलावतारे च’ इति विश्वकोशात्'

‘कंसोऽस्त्री तैजसद्रव्ये कांस्ये मानेऽसुरे तु न’ इति मेदिनीकोशात्,

‘भुवनममृतं जीवनं स्याद् दकञ्च’ इति हलायुधवचनात्,

  

its showing that the author has normal tendency to give the origin of the text name or author name what he quotate. then is it possible to think he will forget the text name.  

i am not saying you are wrong, but may be this is my view point..  

  

possibility is there we will get the same words from different kosa's. but i was expecting may be possibly if we get a lexicon named 'कोश'. then i have to search it. so i was trying

  

thank you very much sir for your guidance. As a student, your advice will always help us..

  

with regards

  

Krishnakumar
