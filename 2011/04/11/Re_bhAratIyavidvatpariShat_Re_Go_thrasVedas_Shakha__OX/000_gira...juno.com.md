Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Reference: "apANipAd" as earlier God in----



Please see whether this makes any sense--



The deity tro from Rigveda lore represents the phenomenon (in Afghanistan) of a tornado accompanied by the formation of a cyclonic vortex, The three deities are apAm NapAt, Ahirbudhnya and Aja EkapAd. The last two deities are also mentioned onlyin passing in the Vedic literature.



apAm NapAt has special significance as the deity is referred in the Avestan literature. It means a child of water. apAm NapAt portions out waters. He brings the kingly Xvarenah to the depth of Vourukasa. His name was given to the eighth month of the Cappadocian calendar to honor him. Cappadocia was in the western Asia. Thanks.(Taken from the book on Afghanistan).R.Joshi.

**To add one more thing comes to my mind : YajNa is not possible without pANi indriya.God is AdhiyajNa in this respect.DAna and AdAna obtain at the very core of yajNa.
