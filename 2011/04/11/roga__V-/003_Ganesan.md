Dear Scholars,

Our friend Veeranarayana has raised a very relevant point about the meaning og 'roga' in the cited verse.

I would like to point out that there is also an exactly similar view expressed by the Saiva poet-saints called 'Naayanaar' in Tamilnadu.

One of them called Tirunavukkaracu Naayanaar (who lived in the 7th century and said to be the contemporray of the king Mahendravarma Pallava of Kanchi)states in one of his Tamil devotional hymns that the 'eyes of a person whodoes not behold Siva are only sores' and in another hymn states that ' those days that one has not sung the glory of Siva are not to be counted as living days andthey areas good (or as bad ??) as dead days'.

With regards

Ganesan
