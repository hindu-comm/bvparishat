RS Shivaganeshamurti informs us that

Cunningham came across about 131 different markings on the prehistoric pottery dug out in nalgonda district of andhra pradesh. it has been shown that these are alphabetical signs and not mere markings. a few of them about five are identical with brahmi..

another is a palmshaped himatite stone discovered near ranchi. the three letters written on this have very close similarities with brahmi but are reversed.
