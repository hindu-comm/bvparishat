Can anyone explain why Panini used lipi and libi whereas in literature it is only lipi. does it indicate to some other script in which p and b were written in the same manner? can any scholar of old Kharosthi shed some light? contemporary scripts including Bakhshali Manuscripts which were not very far off from the birth-place of Panini can shed some light. There might have been a script in Kamboja ( referred to by) grammatical tradition for S'ava root which is not referred to by scholars. Please investigate and bring it to this forum. Regards, spnarang
