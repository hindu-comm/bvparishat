Dear Dr. Kalyanraman, Namaste!

I always enjoyed reading your posts. Your devotion to decipher Indus script is appreciated. Some time ago, Prof. S. Korada brought to our attention that there is word "Lipi-Libi" in grammar of Panini. There is verbal root 'Likh" in Sanskrit. Approximate time of Panini is 500 to 700 BC and development of Brahmi in the Indian subcontinent is much later on. It looks to me the ancient Indians knew how to make bricks (Is't'ikaa). The question is-To the best my knowledge, we did not find any writing on mud tablets like Middle-East countries between the time of Indus civilization and the time of Panini or the time of first Brahmi inscriptions of the known history. If you have any knowledge about any writings discovered on the soil of Indian subcontinent from the intermediate period (Indus civilization and time of Panini), please let us know so we can grow in our knowledge.Thanks.N.R.Joshi.

In this document, Iravatham Mahadevan reads his own name in two signs of the Indus Script: Mahadevan.

Comment: The glyphic elements used in the two signs are: harrow, horn, body (person).

Alternate readings (rebus) based on Kalyanaraman, 2010, I*ndus Script Cipher, hieroglyphs of Indian linguistic area:*

aDar 'harrow'; rebus: aduru 'native, unsmelted metal' (Kannada) (p.63, p.69)

mEd 'body' (Kur.)(DEDR 5099); rebus: meD 'iron' (Ho.)(pp.211. 212).

kODu 'horn' (Tu.); rebus: koD 'shed' (G.)(p.52, p.63)

The reading is thus of three words from Indian linguistic area: aduru meD koD meaning: native metal, iron shed (workshop).
