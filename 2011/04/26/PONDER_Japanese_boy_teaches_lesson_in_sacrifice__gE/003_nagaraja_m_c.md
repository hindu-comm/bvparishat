Really an eye opener one for Indians. When the same one was sent a few days ago, one of the administrators of BVP had threatened me that if any rubbish (????) like these should sneak into the BVP, I would be put out of the Parishad (?). He had very clearly informed ME that anything out of Samskrit was not welcomed on this site.

Even though these are not directly related, people like samskrit scholars should come forward, see the world with wide eyes and spread all good things on the world for the benefit of the world.

DhanyaHa parishadganah.

Dhanyavad.
