To practice shastras is much more difficult than writing a mail or just perusing them. We need to know why we write shastras, why we study them and why we practice them? Without knowing these things we cannot go anywhere. I think there is always time to improve oneself, to improve ones nation/society. How we can have maximum benefitof our shastras, and how we can serve our nation beautifully with the knowledge of our shastras are, I think, the main issues that we should worry about. I do not intend to argue with anybody. I just invite every body to spread the message of love and 'sevaa' every where in the world and try to regain our age-old credential of 'jagatguru'.



Thank you.



With love, affection, respect and 'sevaa-bhaava'
