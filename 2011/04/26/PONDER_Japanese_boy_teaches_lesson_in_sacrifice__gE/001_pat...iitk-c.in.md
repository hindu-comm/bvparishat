\> EDITOR'S note:\*\* THIS letter, written by a Vietnamese immigrant Ha Minh

  
\> Thanh working in Fukushima as a policeman to a friend in Vietnam , was  
\> posted on New America Media on March 19. It is a testimonial to the  
\> strength  
\> of the Japanese spirit, and an interesting slice of life near the  
\> epicenter  
\> of Japan 's crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. It was translated  
\> by NAM editor Andrew Lam, author of "East Eats West: Writing in Two  

\> Hemispheres." Shanghai Daily condensed it. \*

\> \*  
\> 10 things to learn from Japan\*\*.\*\*  
\>  
\> 1. THE CALM\*

  
\> Not a single visual of chest-beating or wild grief. Sorrow itself has  

\> been elevated.\*  
\>  
\> 2. THE DIGNITY\*

  
\> Disciplined queues for water and groceries. Not a rough word or a crude  

\> gesture. \*  
\>  
\> 3. THE ABILITY\*

  
\> The incredible architects, for instance. Buildings swayed but didn’t  

\> fall.\*  
\>  
\> 4. THE GRACE\*

  
\> People bought only what they needed for the present, so everybody could  

\> get something.\*  
\>  
\> 5. THE ORDER\*

  
\> No looting in shops. No honking and no overtaking on the roads. Just  

\> understanding. \*  
\>  
\> 6. THE SACRIFICE\*

  
\> Fifty workers stayed back to pump sea water in the N-reactors. How will  

\> they ever be repaid?\*  
\>  
\> 7. THE TENDERNESS\*

  
\> Restaurants cut prices. An unguarded ATM is left alone. The strong cared  

\> for the weak.\*  
\>  
\> 8. THE TRAINING\*

  
\> The old and the children, everyone knew exactly what to do. And they  
\> did  

\> just that.\*  
\>  
\> 9. THE MEDIA\*

  
\> They showed magnificent restraint in the bulletins. No silly reporters.  

\> Only calm reportage.\*  
\>  
\> 10. THE CONSCIENCE\*

  
\> When the power went off in a store, people put things back on the  
\> shelves and left quietly!  

\> \*Live Simply so Others May Simply Live.\*
