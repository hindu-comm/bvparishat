Thank you Mr. Nagaraj ji for sharing your views. Actually, the aim of all shastra-s should be how to make the society more beautiful, more sensitive towards humanity and more caring about each other. We should keep on exploring ways of refining, developingour nation/people with the help of our shastra-s. And also if we could add something new for the benefit of humanity, then it can't be said shastra-viruddha but it would be the enrichment of our shastra-s.



Thanks and regards,

Madhav
