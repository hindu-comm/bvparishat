Dear Sri Anilkumar,

In your mail you have given a list of scholars who are invited to speak and also written that other scholars are also being contacted. But you have also kindly asked whether there are other scholars interested to present a paper. Does it mean that others can also present a paper and on the same topic but from a different tradition, say, the Saiva Agama-s ??

I would be thaknful to have a quick answer.

With the best wishes

Ganesan
