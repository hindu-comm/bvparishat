Namaste!

Kalpa Heritage Trust is planning to organise a seminar on Vivaha Samskara at Mysore tentatively on 8th and 9th October 2011. Some of the subject matters to be discussed maybe the following:

1\. Vivaha Samskara as per the Grihya Sutras of the branches of the four Vedas.

2\. Current Paddhatis & Prayogas

3\. Forms of marriage: Which is most suitable forpresent times.

4\. Mantras and preserving traditional sanctity.

5\. Need for standardisation and simplification?

6\. Interaction among practictioners following different Vedas & branches.  
  
Suggestions and papers are welcome from scholars. Kindly respond early.
