**esteemed colleagues,  
i appreciate himanee's thought and reflections on basic issues.  
let this be a movement ! today is the save earth day.we can pledge in the best spirits of the atharvanic seers who looked at earth with so much care,love and concern !  
can't we buy vegetables without putting each purchase in to a divider plastic bag that later pollutes our environment.i have tested this and found to be successful and technically possible.i remember i did this in my boyhood when plastic bags were rare and vegetable vendors couldn't afford them.the sequence i knew how potatoes came first and tomatoes got seated at the top and the middle space given to others - neither too hard nor too soft.back at home to pick them out was a fun,all cooperated and enjoyed the sight of the natural colors and smell !  
sometimes i see a beauty in english or german etc written with only small-s and no capitals with a kind of ego potential in between ! and how nice it looks when the small and sober ' i ' is bereft of it's capital character ! see that ' I-s ' pollute and ' i - s ' are paid to clean !! i don't know if distinctions this way could also be minimized ! our language is a product of our thought and the same creates action.  
indian scripts since the days of brahmi are always the same - neither capital nor small ! see my 'indian' is not correct in english,nor 'english' is - the red-underlining warns us to distinguish big and small !  
today is 'save earth day' ! let's pledge to be good,equal,equitable through equanimity !  
let the best be !
