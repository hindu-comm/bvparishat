thanks madam for the complimenting words.i had aword with prof.  
bandyopadhyaya after you reached back.i am happy you both came here  
and added to the success of this exercise.prof. ratna basu in her  
inimitable way is now scanning the participants for what worth they  
could be.the 2nd and 3rd ms are in progress.  
himanee i don't know,some ideas she has deserve appreciation.i am  
forwarding to you some reply that i sent to her.and yes some  
differences are to be ironed out with an unabashed frankness if we are  
a civilized society.  
best regards,  
smmishra
