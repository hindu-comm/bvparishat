many thanks, prof. mishra for your great concern about saving our mother earth and environment.



i appreciate very much thetouch of greenthat enhancesthe soothing effect in our mindwhile going throughyour postings.



in place of plastc carry bags in nearpast there had been an attempt to usenewspaper packets in some places of kolkata.everything used to be very much in places.there used to have no problems at all. but again, plastic bags have replaced paper packets, unfortunately.



the question is, when we shouldget into thehabit in a general basis of caring for our surroundings.



very righly you have pointed out that there was no concept of capital letters in ancient indian scripts. while romanising any text we are not putting any capitalletters for this simple reason.



thanks and with best regards,



soma basu
