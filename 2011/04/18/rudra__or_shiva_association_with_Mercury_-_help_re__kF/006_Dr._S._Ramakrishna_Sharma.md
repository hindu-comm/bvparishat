Namaste.  
  
I have an copy with Hindi translation. But it is at home, in Suratkal.  
I will certainly cross check the text with the PDF provided by Dr. H.N Bhat.  
  
Further,  
  
Sri Bellumkonda Ramaraya Kavi's work titled "लोकायतादियोगान्तमतखण्डनं"  
has one section on Raseshwara Matam/Siddhanta. I have not studied this  
section deeply. However, the name makes it clear that it refers to Eshvara,  
Rasa(Mercury/Parada) relationship.
