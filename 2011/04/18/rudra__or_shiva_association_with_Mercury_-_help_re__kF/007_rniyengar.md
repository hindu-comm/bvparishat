Dear Dr.Yadu,  
  
Mercury sources were not totally unknown in ancient India. Skaanda  
PuraNa (Prabhasakshetra mahatmya Ch.135.v 35-37) mentions a lake  
containing Rasa as formed due to falling of extra terrestrial objects  
near Prabhasa. RasaarNavakalpa (INSA publication) mentions Kardama  
Mountains as a source. This has been investigated by a geologist and  
is located to be near Siddhapura (N 24 E 72.5). Details are available  
in my published paper at  
  
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/5991466/Profile-of-a-natural-disaster-in-sanskrit-literature-by-R-N-I>  
  
About Mercury being the semen of Shiva, (I do not find any difficulty)  
I take such statements to be metaphors alluding to an already existing  
tradition of cosmogony. The episode of falling of Linga from the sky  
is in the PuraNas and indirectly in the Vedas also. Shiva is called  
IriNya in the Yajurveda (Rudra Sukta) and we know IriNa is the Rann-of-  
kutch very near the old Prabhaasa (not the modern Somanatha) of the  
Skaanda PuraNa where the lake of Rasa existed.  
  
The story of Mohini Avatara of VishNu and the dropping of (Rudra)  
Shiva’s semen appears in many places. Even RaamaayaNa alludes to this  
and links this to the occurrence of Gold and other metals on earth.  
See Bala kanda Ch 36.16-19 and the next Chapter. (Shiva’s semen  
falling on earth & Birth of Skanda)  
  
" 'Oh, Fire-god, you please coordinate the mission of gods, oh, great-  
resplendent god of Fire, you may release the potence of Shiva, which  
you have contained so far, in the daughter of King of Mountains,  
namely River Ganga.' Thus, all gods have requested the Fire-god.

My inference is there already existed in the memory of our ancients  
that such an episode had happened in the still remote past. Eventually  
this means valuable elements (gold, silver, Mercury perhaps  
diamond,..) were thought to be coming from above. Not a bad theory at  
all. We know now that heavy metals occur at meteoritic craters.  
Already Vedic people knew that meteorites (Maruts) bring precious  
material to earth (sanaaddhi vo ratnadheyaani santi \| RV X.88.8). This  
could be a later view of the falling "maruts" after physical  
examination of the objects and a feel for their contents.
