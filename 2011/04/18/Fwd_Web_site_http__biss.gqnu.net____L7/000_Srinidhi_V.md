***Dear Shri Shrinidhi,  
  
I need your help in the following matter. My email address "[b...@india.com]()" is in the bvparishat group, but some how no email is going out from that address though I am getting all incoming mail. (That is the way I got your address)  
  
My emails to the group from this address are being returned as this address is not included in the group. Therefore I request you to please forward the letter below, to the group.  
  
I shall be glad if you send it to other groups and friends whom you deem fir.  
  
With regards,  
  
Yours truly,  
  
D D Misra ***
