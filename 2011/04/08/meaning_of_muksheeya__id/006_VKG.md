Pranaam

Fine with the derivation of Abi - Sabde.

If it is Vidhi LiN. What about LiNassalopo(a)nantyasya? Where is the  
special exception?

Actually, it is Asheer LiN. Hence, no Vikarana is required - I  
contend.  
Muc + Seeyut + A = Muksheeya. (It is as simple as this).

In fact, another seeming error is that -

Wherever there is a Vikarana Pratyaya - it is sandwiched between the  
Lakaara and Dhaatu; not in between.

Take Modeya, Eedheeya etc.

Mud + Sha + Seeyut+ It (At)  
Moda (after Guna) + Seey + A  
Moda + Eeya (Sakaara Lopa from LiNassaloponantyasya)  
Modeya

(Let us understand that Seeyut, is pertaining to LiN, Li\~Naseeyut.)

---  
If it is Muksheeya

The Vikarana Pratyaya cannot come after Seeyut.  
Muc + Seeyut + Sha + A = This dispensation is not seen by me so far.  
If someone enlightens us, we commend.

More instances/ explanations are welcome.
