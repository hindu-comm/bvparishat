Sri VK Ghanapathi  
  
1. dhAtUnAm anekArthatvam  
  
really , this is another instance and many more across **Panini . BhImasena** had just given the popular meanings of the roots .  
  
The interest is in -- a **dhAtu** , generally means '**s'abda**' , i.e. a **vis.aya of s'rotra** , denotes something related to **dr.s.t.i , i.e. a vis.aya of netra .  
**  
2. two akAras - was this necessary ? how is this possible ?  
  
As has already ben explained by Sri Bhatta - the **Vikaran.apratyaya , i.e. tudAdibhya.h s'a.h , is a must as Vidhilin' is SArvadhAtuka (lat., lot. and lan' also) . It is 'nitya' .**  
  
As soon as one starts -- **muc + it. .(in Vidhilin') , s'a** would arrive on the seen .  
  
Even if we keep in mind - **'it.o't** ' the **s'a** will come following the **LaukikanyAya -- parjanyavat laks.an.apravr.tti.h** ( a cloud rains on a river , ocean etc. also - whether it is required or not it would just go .  
  
Therefore , we are forced to resort to **PararUpam .**  
  
Sri Bhatta  
  
**abi - is anudAttet** and as such it is **Atmanepada** . How come ' **ambati = naks.atraparyantam gacchati' ?**  
Please provide if there is any other version .  
  
**N.vul** also came to my mind . But again we have to go to **'litsvara' , n\~itsvara** etc' and it may take the discussion too far from the original question .  
  
As most of our valuable books were burnt by Mlecchas , it is difficult to ascertain as to where Bhattabhaskara said so .  
  
**Madhaviyadhatuvrtti , Praudhamanorama , Brhacchabdendusekhara** etc also did not say anything clearly in this regard .  
  
But we are happy that the questioner (not for glory) may not get such an analysis in any particular book and here we provide .  
  
I am thankful to all the scholars for the cooperation .Any further discussion is welcomed .
