if sup is sadhuprayoga then there is no anvaya at all. moreover praatipadika does not refere to ekatva. it refers to ektvavaan.

it is not the case.because prakrti refers to ekatvavaan and pratyaya refers to only ekatva. there should be bhedaanvaya. in case both refer to ekatva as you assume there should be abhedaanvaya since both ekatvas are identical.
