Again you are confusing.

  

Anyway, I leave the proper solution for your problem to our beloved ring master Prof. Korada. Probably you mean:

  

न एकः - न द्वौ = and not na dauH

  

In the first place, there are two possibilities: a compound with नञ् will give you अनेकः; with न without ञ् will give a compound नैकः; both are usually used in plural to mean many as compound; नैके अनेके etc. As two independent words, you will have two usages:

  

एको न द्वौ for consideration of our Prof. who will explain in its proper fervor of Shastra dialect, like घटो न पटः;

  

Both are discussed in the texts, I am leaving the matter at the disposal of our master, if it is what you mean. In all the cases, शाब्दबोध will make clear the relations between the words. The anvaya-method too may differ between the Grammarian's approach and Naiyayika-s approach than the Mimamsaka-s'. You will have a feast of शाब्दबोध and then raise your doubts properly in the proper place.

  

With regards
