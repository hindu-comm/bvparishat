Respected scholars,

Wish you all a happy and prosperous yugadi.

Yesterday I have taken over the office of the Director, Directorate of samskrit education of Karnataka state, under newly established karnataka samskrit university, Bangalore. For a period of two years I have obtained deputation from Sanskrit academy, Hyd.

I seek support from BVP members.

Regards, shrivara
