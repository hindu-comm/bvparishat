I hope prof. Varakhedi will fix the right stones in right places in Karnataka sanskrita Uni.

  

  

it is high time to materialise the concepts of truly global sanskrit university.Karnataka sanskrita Uni shall not tread the path of other sanskrit unis which are isolated, eaten by powerbrokers, marred by groupism, and established only for votepolitics, and most prominently flooded by unworthy teachers and students.

  

it should be truly open university to admit meritorious students across the streams who want to persue studies in or on different aspects of scientific aspects hidden in sanskrit. it should find no excuse to deny the gates to students of others streams on the count of language or region.

  

this new uni I hope will become a hub of studies, research, knowledge dissemination and attract the talented people across the globe. it should use the benglore's most powerfull weaponnry (IT) to help the sanskrit studies.

I hope varakhedi will guide and direct it in this regard. congrats for the great leader.
