Dear Professor Bhattacharya,  
  
  You sent me a section of your introduction to the 3rd volume of  
the AVP dealing with your discussion of Surya Kanta, but I have not  
seen the rest of the introduction. I would be happy to read your  
discussion of the relations between the AVP and the Upaniṣads. The  
discussion of jyeṣṭham brāhmaṇam looks most interesting. With best  
wishes for the publication of the 3rd volume.
