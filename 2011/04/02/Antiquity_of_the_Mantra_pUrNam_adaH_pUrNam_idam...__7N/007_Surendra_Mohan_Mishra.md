Thanks to Prof. Deshpande to have raised this question regarding this mantra-s of unknown sources occurring in many upanishads  
The mantra 'pUrNamada.h' etc,as much as the mantra-s in the traditional das'a-s'Antaya.h may be from various sources,at times may be from from extinct s'AkhA-s.As per the mantra i remember a similar text in the Atha.Veda : 'pUrNAt pUrNamudacati pUrNa.m pUrNena hIyate; uta tadadya .......... yadatra pari.sicyate'.This is in the Skambha or Jye.sTha Brahma sUkta.Such mantra-s are found appended at the beginning and end of the upanishads old and latter with slight changes like 'satya.m vadi.syAmi' in the beginning and 'satya.m avAdi.sam' at the end.Such change is contextual or is it so in the basic text could be verified only with tracing these highly respected age-old passages to their roots.  
Best regards,  
SMMishra
