It is high time that an addenda et corrigenda to Bloomfield should be undertaken particularly when a number of Vedic recensions including recent Asvalayana of the RV are published. It will bring Vedic heritage a fresh light for research. Lubotsky's concordance (Bloomfield's work on line with full consolidated material-- online and published ) was available. I am not sure it contained addenda or not. Regards, spnarang
