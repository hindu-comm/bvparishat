Dear Vidvāṃsaḥ,

Thanks for the suggestions. Some colleagues on the Indology  
discussion list have pointed out the occurrence of pūrṇam adaḥ in  
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (5.1.1), where Śaṃkara comments on it, and a  
variant of pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate in Atharvaveda Śaunaka (10.8.29).  
Thanks to everyone. Best,

Madhav M. Deshpande
