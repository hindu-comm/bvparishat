Esteemed Prof. Bhattacharya and Prof. Deshpande,  
The mantra at AVS' 10.8.29 reads like this :  
पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदचति पूर्णं पूर्णेन सिच्यते /  
उतो तदद्य विद्याम यतस्तत्परि.sicyate //  
This with it's counterpart in AVP already cited make good comparison.Our philosophical positions can accommodate both.  
But to say which is former or latter is a mere conjecture.  
Best regards,  
SMMishra
