Dear Professor Bhattacharya,

This is in continuation of my previous message about a possible  
shift in terminology from the AVP pūrṇāt ūnam  
udacyate to the Upaniṣadic - pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate. On the face of  
it, this looks analogous to the shift seen from the early Vedic notion  
of asataḥ sat ajāyata to the Upaniṣadic change reflected in the  
discussion: katham asataḥ sat jāyeta? sad eva saumya idam agra  
āsīt. In any case, I thank everyone for participating in this  
stimulating discussion. With best wishes,

Madhav Deshpande
