Sir, kindly accept my congratulations. It is good to have a  
resourceful person like you for this position. people like me would be  
really glad as it is easier and faster to approach you. iam sure that  
this would be a new dawn for sanskrit in the state and we would  
definitely see some republications and new publications of precious  
sanskrit works not only in sanskrit but also the transliteration in  
kannada. with regards and respect, ravindra shenoy
