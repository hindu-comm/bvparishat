Namaste.

  
  
\>No one can explain someone else's spiritual experiences  
unless he has achieved some *siddhis* as narrated in texts.  

Very true. Decrying "Siddhis" is one extreme and the other  
extreme is miracle mongering infatuation.  
Siddhi as a lakshnam of Shuddhi is to be rightly understood.  
There are two categories of Siddhis, namely the Kalpita and the  
Akalpita. The former is ego-prompted and hence limited.  
The latter is manifest as Divine Grace/Ishwara Iccha and hence  
are not binding.  
The Sankhya Sutra mentions that the 'siddhis' are not to be  
decried, like the oushadhis. However, rightly pointed out by  
Savithri Madame, that these are of highly personal context  
and only one's own guru can provide right direction to 'shraddha'.
