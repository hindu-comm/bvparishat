namo vidvadbhyah  
  
I would like to share my experience at Satya Sai Institute of Higher Learning , way back in 1984 --  
  
it was for the selection of Lecturer/Associate Professor in Sanskrit  
the applicant should - not have whiskers(photo is compulsory) , wear white dress only , simple living and high thinking etc.  
I was the only candidate (for Professor's position , although ordered by Baba , the scholar cum bhakta from Tirupati did not turn up ) .  
Generally , it is said , Baba will be there on the selection committee , but it was hot Summer (April 20) and he left for Whitefield .  
After a few questions were asked , the Registrar , an IAS from Andhra said that one increment , free accommodation etc will be given .  
As an answer to my question he informed me that they accept funds from UGC but use them for infrastructure and salaries will be paid from Trust Fund - I remarked - so it is a non-pensionable job .  
  
The Registrar started telling me about the As'rama-niyamas - to get up early in the morning (Brahmimuhurta will do?),regularly Darsan , Bhajan and Prayer .  
  
Why to see Baba everyday ? -- no no Baba wants to see you everyday - reply came .  
  
The fact is that I am not accustomed to even Ramabhajana/Krshnabhajana .  
  
I gleaned some information earlier in the day - one should deposit the Original Certificates with the Admin  
i.e. cannot move once you enter , there will be surveillance upon you , the quarter is simply inhospitable , you should maintain silence - may speak about Baba , Sairam is Omkara etc.  
  
Two Bhaktas were following me after the Interview .  
  
Most of them were suffering from - chronic diseases , Kujadosa , mental problems , disturbed family background etc.  
As per the Tradition one need not go even to temples - deho devAlaya.h prokto devo jIvassanAtana.h .  
  
A great Vedic scholar and an expert in ' LingArcna' (relative) dissappeared in the so called Asrama .  
  
A relative , who lost a couple of children initially , claims - I got children because of Baba ! - what does she mean ?  
Bhasa says in Swapnavasavadatta - cakrArapan'ktiriva gacchati bhAgyapan'kti.h  
  
elsewhere - sukhasyAnantaram du.hkham du.hkhasyAnantaram sukham I  
 cakravat parivartante du.hkhAni ca sukhAni ca II  
  
Parents should train the children properly - Yoga , Vedanta etc.
