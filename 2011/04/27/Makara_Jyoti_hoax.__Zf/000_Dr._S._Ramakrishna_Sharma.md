**Respected Scholars,  
At last from the "temple top" the Light of Truth is flashed.  
For decades and decades the Shabari Mala Makara Jyoti has been  
a topic of controversy between the devotees and the Rationalist Forum  
of Kerala.  
The TV coverage has been sensational in Malayalam, Kannada  
and other channels since a few years.  
BUT, NOW onwards,perhaps, the MJ may continue.  
But without the aura of Ayyappa Divinity.**

**QUOTE:**  
  

The ‘Makarajyothi’ or the celestial light at Kerala’s famous Sabarimala temple is man-made, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) – which runs the temple in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) – submitted to the Kerala High Court on Monday.

The board told the court that since Makarajyothi is a traditional ritual, it could not be done away with. A bench comprising justices Thottathil Radhakrishnan and Shekhar allowed the board’s plea to conduct deeparadhana (evening pooja) instead of Makarajyothi at Ponnambalamedu, where the light appears.

**

**The court held that in view of the board’s admission about the Makarajyothi, there is no need for further investigations into the matter.**

** **

**The Makarajyothi refers to the light flickering thrice on the eastern horizon after the evening pooja at Sabarimala on the last day of the annual pilgrim season.**  

**The temple board’s disclosure came in the form of an affidavit in the Sabarimala stampede case. As many as 104 pilgrims were killed on the night of January 14 in a stampede triggered when three lakh pilgrims were returning after sighting the Makarajyothi.**

**The Makarajyothi is, in fact, the light of the pooja performed by the tribesmen at Ponnambalamedu, a valley situated a few kms away from the temple. The board resorts to this practice to bring in more crowds to the shrine.**

**UNQUOTE.**
