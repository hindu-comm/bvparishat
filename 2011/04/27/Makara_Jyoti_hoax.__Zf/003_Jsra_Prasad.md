Travancore Devaswom Board itself submitted the confession to the court.  
Such incidents cannot be linked with with a yogi who lived six decades ago.  
Everyone admires swami Vivekananda for a true yogi. Swami hinted about  
Yogananda becoming as a spiritual guru, in America. No one can explain  
someone else's spiritual experiences unless he has achieved some *siddhis*  
as narrated in texts.  
  
The 'seeing is believing' kind of phenomenon is limited to sensory  
perception. All of our scriptures are based on *sabda* pramANa. We believe  
in the utterance of '*aapta*' (one who is devoid of any illusion in acquiring  
true knowledge). That is up to you whether to accept one for '*aapta*' or not.  
  
Reading books like 'Autobiography of Yogi' may give better 'food for thought' than  
reading 'Harry Potter and the...' etc., kind of stuff. Even sri Sankaracharya conveyed  
us that one should believe in his words after thorough examination only.
