Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



As Dr. Iyengar, described, the discussion on Lipi turned out interesting and informative. First I would like to thank Dr. D. Bhattacharya for breaking the extra long sentence of Dr. narayan er into separate padas. Next thanks to Dr. H.N. Bhata for translating it into English and addingthe information on the work of Purushottamdeva. Finally thanks to Dr. S, Korada for offering more grammatical details and mentioning use of board with sand layer for writing. Dear Dr. Bhat, I read about metathesis in Sanskrit words. I read a note on it long ago by Prof. Madhav Deshpande. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
