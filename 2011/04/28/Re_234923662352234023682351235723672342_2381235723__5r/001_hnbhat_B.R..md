Dear Joshiji,

  

Dr. Narayanan's lengthy writing didn't mean much than lipi -and libi are the two allomorphic words, as I understand. There is only one root Lip - upalepe, to annoint or paint. in the root list accessory to Sutra compilation, another compilation called Dhatupatha, (list of verbs to be read) along with the Sutra-s) to know the complete purview or scope of application of the rules. I think this is enough for you to understand what he meant. And this list contains only the root LiP from which only the word LIPI could be derived and not the LIBI as in the Sutra he quoted. The Sutra quoted by him is intended to explain the derivation of two similar words लिपि-कर and लिबिकर noticed by Panini in the language at his time. He deduced that only LIPI is justified as the properly derived word and the other has to be taken granted by Panini's words. It is also derived from the same root, with change of the phoneme p \> b as quoted by the word with the same derivation used for LIPI

  

I am not sure whether such change is a case of metathesis according to linguistics. But such words are accepted by lexicographers as शब्दभेद. One such lexicon was compiled by the great compiler of lexicons of 14th centure, Purushottamadeva, who authored similar lexicons supplementing Amarakosha with different themes in arranging the words. One of such is the above lexicon, in which one can find many more such words. He clearly directly refers these are interchangeable phonemes in these words and in others where it could not be interchanged. Such as va-ba, ra>la, Ta - DA. He is from Orissa, and he lists of popular Rabindranatha or Raveendranatha. This is my supposition for the two words prevalent at the time of Panini, but may be the difference lost later लिपिकर and लिबिकर taken up for analysis in the quoted Sutra. Lip + I- kR + a \>\> लिपिकर, लिबिकर. This is the view of commentators on the धातुपाठ to commenting on the said root.

  

Hope this much is clear. Anyhow, our Prof. Korada is there, for further clarification.
