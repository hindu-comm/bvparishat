**नम: पारायणपरेभ्य:,**  
It was on Sri Ramanavami Day that Prof. Bhagabaan Samantha Rai  
of Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan, Rajiv Gandhi Campus, Sringeri, came  
to my room and stated about his sankalpa to receive a copy(promised and  
reserved) of Sri Ramayanam Text in Samskrutam for Parayanam, as he felt  
that it was the most auspicious day for the purpose.  
There were only two copies available at Sringeri Book Stall(Gita Press copies are out of print)  
which I had bought for distribution. One was already given to a student of the campus  
during Samskruta-Dinacharanam. Hence the professor was keen to receive the last copy.  
It was offered to him, on Sri Ramanavami, against the background of Sri Vidyashankara Temple,  
at the Lotus Feet of Sri Lakshmi-Narasimha(seen in the photo attached.)  
धन्यो'स्मि
