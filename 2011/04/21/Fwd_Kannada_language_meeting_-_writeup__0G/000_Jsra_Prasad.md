Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is a scientific  
society under Department of Information Technology (DIT), Ministry of  
Communication and Information Technology (MCIT), Government of India  
engaged in research related to technology development for Indian  
languages for over two decades now. Recently, a programme to make  
available tools and utilities for all Indian languages freely to the  
citizens has been undertaken by DIT through C-DAC. Lakhs of copies of  
such CDs in all Indian languages have been distributed to them to make  
use further for academic and research purpose.

Indian Heritage Group (IHG) at the Knowledge Park campus of C-DAC,  
Bangalore wishes to contribute by way of development efforts for  
proliferating the use of regional language -- Kannada freely to harness  
its rich potential as a classical language. In this direction, we  
propose to invite all the stakeholders across a wide spectrum covering  
academic and research institutions, universities, general users, public  
institutions and the linguistic community. We would be pleased to  
receive inputs in the form of suggestions, comments, requirement  
specifications, curriculum enhancements preferably in the e-Learning and  
online modes, building references work like dictionary, encyclopaedia,  
thesaurus, corpus, spoken and written repositories of rare works,  
historical articrafts, palm leaf manuscripts etc.,

A one day round table meeting is planned at our campus on May 4, 2011 to  
which we warmly invite you to take part. Kindly inform us of any other  
contacts or suggest a bigger network of contribution or users. Kindly  
contribute your ideas and actively participate in this meeting.

Thanking you,

Yours sincerely,

\*Dr. P. Ramanujan\*
