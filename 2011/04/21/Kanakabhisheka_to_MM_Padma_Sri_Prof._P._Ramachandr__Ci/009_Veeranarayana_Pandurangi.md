Please convey our regards to this great savant of sanskrita language.  
I hope all these messages will be conveyed in print form to Prof.  
Pullela sir by Prof. Neelakantham or Prof. Shivasenani or Prof.  
Shashirekha. he is a confluence of old tradition and new discoveries.  
he never clinged to old lines. Jai ho.
