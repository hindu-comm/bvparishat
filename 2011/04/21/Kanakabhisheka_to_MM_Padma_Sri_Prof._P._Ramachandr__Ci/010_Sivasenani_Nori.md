Sir



I am not a professor; rather, I am a student of MA in Osmania University. I hope I have not inadvertently given the impression anywhere that I am a professor.



I had given the printouts of the messages as of 25th April to Prof. K. Neelakantham. Unfortunately the event got cancelled as Govt. of AP declared three days of official mourning on the same day (due to the death of Sai Baba). I am aware of the new date. Meanwhile, I will give printouts of the further messages to Prof. K. Neelakantham shortly.



Regards

N. Siva Senani
