Dear Prof Narasimhachary,

What a delight to hear from you and also the great news about Prof, Ramachandrudu. Please convey my very best wishes and hearty congratulations on this richly deserved honour to him. If he has an email I would like to do so myself.

Also I am delighted to see that you are at Mauritius. Please convey my good wishes to Roodruman. I know him from Delhi University days. I would like to visit Mauritius myself some day. Best wishes and pranams
