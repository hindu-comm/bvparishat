The etymology of Marut may be from MR root which means death of the sea and a sandy land. The airs of that area of the dry land may be Marut. It is available in Marusthala whence MRtkunda>MArkandeya which is also related in the similar sense. even now a medicine is called Murdaasanga: a dead marble. VAdhuula may have also relation to that where Vaata and dhuuli are only available. Perhaps, this land was between Gujarat and Iran and a trade route also. A few of our Pundit scholars react but it must be investigated for the cultural history of India. Regareds, spnarang
