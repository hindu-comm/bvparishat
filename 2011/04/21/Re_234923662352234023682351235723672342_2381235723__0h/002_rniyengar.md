Dear Dr.Joshi, Namaste. I have written a lengthy paper on comets and  
meteoritic showers in the RV. So I don't like to bore you again! Some  
random excerpts defending my stand about "Marut" are here: Regards;  
RNI  
---  
Maruts are well known Vedic deities taken to represent ‘winds and  
thunderstorms inducing rain’ by traditionalists as well as by modern  
scholars. However, their explicit relation with dhûmaketu provides a  
clue to their correct decipherment as ‘meteoritic storms’. Maruts are  
a group of deities, usually known as sons of Rudra and occasionally  
directly as Rudrâh. The key discriminatory feature of maruts is that  
they are a collection of individuals who could be seen  
and hence countable in some sense. They are said to be separated among  
themselves. They increase by two and three and their count varies from  
twentyone (I.133.6) to forty-nine (VIII.28.5) to sixty-three (VIII.  
96.8). They could even be seen in waves of thousands (I.168.4). If  
these properties were to be reconciled with a physically possible  
natural object, maruts have to be taken as a shower of meteorites. No  
doubt there are hymns associated with maruts that refer to lightning,  
rain, wind, thunderous sound and consequent shaking of trees, people  
and mountains. However, seen in the perspective of a celestial agni  
called dhûmaketu being a comet, the above actions of maruts are more  
valid for a swarm of meteors than for the monsoon thunderstorm.......  
  
If one agrees with the principle of internal consistency as the  
approach to understand RV, one can not assign different meanings to  
the same word used in similar contexts. Doubts arise about the words  
parvata and giri occurring in connection with maruts. Traditionalists  
take this to be mountains in some verses but as clouds in other  
places. A typical example of this confusion is in hymn (III.26)  
attributed to Vis'vâmitra. Sâyan.a assumes maruts produce a rain of  
water and hence takes the word parvatân to mean clouds, where as there  
is nothing in the three verses (III.26.4-6) to indicate ordinary  
rainfall. The statement marutah. pravepayanti parvatân should normally  
mean maruts shake the mountains. This remains consistent in all places  
if maruts are understood to be representing meteorites or fragments of  
extra terrestrial objects falling on earth. .....  
  
Etymology:  
It is well known that Agni and Indra are the most important deities of  
RV. This is true, not only in a statistical sense, but also in terms  
of the importance they have carried through in the Vedic rituals and  
literature devoted to the elucidation of RV. Even though the original  
agni of RV was clearly celestial, the sacrificial agni which is  
terrestrial assumed greater significance in the traditional  
(yâjn‚ika)interpretation of RV by Sâyan.a and others. The reasons for  
this are not difficult to find. The Vedic religion of yajn.a on earth  
is a replica of what the gods did once  
upon a time. This yajn.a of the gods was of celestial origin with its  
effects reaching the earth. Hence it was of profound cosmological  
import to the founders of the Vedic religion and philosophy  
culminating in the Vedânta or the Upanis.ads. There are several  
instances in the Vedas where this point is stated either  
metaphorically or directly. In the second book (II.21.5), Usƒijs  
Añgirasas) are said to have found the path by means of yajn‚a. The  
allegorical reference is to the overthrow of Vala to get the waters  
released. RV hymn (VIII.89) by Nr.medha and Purumedha (Añgirases) is  
about Indra supported by maruts as a group. In (VIII.89.5, 6) the  
principle of yajn‚a is said to have originated when Indra spread  
between the earth and the sky for killing Vr.tra. This yajn‚a of gods  
had a corresponding sacrifice on earth also, which in modern parlance  
could perhaps be called a natural disaster. Maitrâyan.î Sam.hitâ  
mentions that gods did a sacrifice at Kuruks.etra. This is  
confirmed with further elaborations in the Taittirîya Âran.yaka .  
Taittirîya Brâhman.a categorically states, maruts killed Prajapati’s  
creatures because they (maruts) were not initially worshipped by the  
people. Prajâpati (Progenitor of people) had to behold a particular  
offering and present it to maruts in order to save his creation. A  
similar statement occurs in the same text about maruts disturbing the  
work of Prajâpati . Since RV is the earliest among the Vedas, other  
texts derive inspiration from RV for their contents and practices.  
Thus Vedic literature has sufficient evidences for us to infer that  
sacrifice by the gods through the agency of meteoritic storms called  
maruts in RV should have depleted the population in the northern parts  
of ancient India. Nirukta (XI.13) explains the word marut derived  
variously from the roots mi & ru as measured sound, or from mi & ruc  
as measured brilliance or from mahad & dru as having great  
movement . However, the main action of maruts had been to kill. Hence  
derivation from the root mr. (to smash, to pound, to die) as pointed  
out by Max Mueller would be appropriate.

To the best my memory, you are the only one on the list who writes about Prabhasa which was very important place in the last days of Krishna.I read your papers because I have interest in Mahabharat history. Thanks for research papers.I have two short questions. (1) I think Marut gaNa are storm gods. Could they be interpreted as meteorites? I do not know etymology of the word "Marut". (2) I read in geology books that diamonds are found in Diamond pipe-extinct volcano. Ancient India had many diamond pipes.Please help and thanks again.
