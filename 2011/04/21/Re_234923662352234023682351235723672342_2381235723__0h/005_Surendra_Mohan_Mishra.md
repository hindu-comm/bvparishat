Thanks Mr Anil Kumar for the information regarding four kinds of VAdhUla-s and spread of the Vedic branch in Kerala.B B Chaubey has made an allusion to the passage quoted.In his Arthasangraha LaugAkshi salutes his great guru : vAdhUlAnvaya-bhAskara.m varaguru.m s'AstrArtha-ratnAkaram.I want to know how the word is derived.Any derivation noticed anywhere ? What could be the period when this school came to flourish in Kerala ?  
Regarding 'marut',it can be derived from 'm.rnja prANatyAge' with UNAdi 'ut' meaning wind,the related deity and mountain peak.Also it is derivable from 'm.r' with 'uti' as shown by Prof. S P Narang.  
Best regards,  
SMMishra
