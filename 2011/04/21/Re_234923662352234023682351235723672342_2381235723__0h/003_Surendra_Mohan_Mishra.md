Thanks to Prof. Narang that he has raised the issue of the etymology of the word Vaadhuula which just I was asking my student working on the Vaadhuula Smriti which is seemingly of a later origin.It's of a Vaishnava line of thinking and although the Vaadhuula recension of the Krishna Yajurveda is yet to be located,a number of works of the particular branch have been edited by Prof. B B Chaubey of Hoshiarpur.This word is not explained in our dictionaries.Regards,SMMishra
