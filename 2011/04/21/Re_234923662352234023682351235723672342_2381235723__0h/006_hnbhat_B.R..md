वातं न सहते इति वातानां समूह इति वा वातूलः; वात + लच् (सिध्मादिः) "वातदन्तबले च" इत्यूङ्; वातादूलः (४/२.४२) - "वातानां समूहे च। वातं न सहते इति च" इति वार्तिकम्। वातूलशब्दः।

  

It may possibly transformed to वाधूल though I could not find any satisfactory etymology for the word and this conforms to the idea of Prof. Narang too. With the relationship Vadhulasmriti to Kerala and Taittiriya, here is an article discussing the topic:

Hope this will shed some light though there too the etymology is not touched.

  

Again, मृङ् प्राणत्यागे - is somehow resorted to मरुत् - as यस्याभावेन म्रियन्ते प्राणिनः इति मरुत्; with the Unadi "मृग्नोरुतिः" as suggested by both Prof. Narang and Mishra. But it should be born in mind that always this doesn't work to look for the roots to find an etymology. It is an accepted maxim that" व्युत्पत्तिनिमित्तमन्यत्, प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तमन्यत्" as view of Shakatayana examined in the Nirukta. It recalled it while reading Prof. Narang's post.
