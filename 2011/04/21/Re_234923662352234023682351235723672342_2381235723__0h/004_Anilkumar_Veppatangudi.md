Vadhula  
I do not know if this will be useful but in the Introduction to  
Agnivesya Grihya Sutra edited by L.A.Ravi Varma and published in the  
Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, Univ.of Travancore,1940,the following  
passage occurs in page iii:  
"Again in the commentary of Vadhula Shrauta Sutra, also belonging to  
Taittiriya Shakha, the following passage is met with:"चतुर्णाँ  
वाधूलानामिति- के ते चत्वारो वाधूलाः  
कौण्डिन्याग्निवेश्यगार(ल)वशाङ्खानां कल्पा: । तथाहि शुल्ब उक्तम् -  
वाधूला सवाधूलाश्चत्वारो विहितः ।This shows that Agniveshya and his  
school formed one of the four subdivisions of Vadhula school.In Kerala  
where Vadhula sutra is fairly common, the Malayalam  
Anuvadam(translation) of Vadhula Shrauta Prayoga is known as  
"Taittiriyam Bhasha." This will show the close relation of Vadhula  
school and Tattiriya Shakha."
