Respected scholars, Namaskar!



Why do people go to Saadhus and to holy Babas?



(1)I think there is soft corner in mind of Indian people about saffron color clothes.One western trained, psychologist from California, I know. got much impressed by an young Saadhu now in trouble in India.



\(2\) People go to Saadhus when they suffer in life. Indian religious books have very high level philosophy. My experience is ---people suffer from ordinary mistakes in their life such as greed, hiding truth,temptation, cheating, steeling, lust and above all Ahankar, --I know everything symptom. Day by day I am feeling that perhaps there is need of teaching ordinary low level psychology in order to avoid common pitfalls repeated by humans through thousands of years' history. As Dr. Yadu described such lessons areavailable from teachings of pragmatic Guru Saint Raamdas of Maharashtra. This is my personal opinion. Others may differ.



\(3\) Last year in Pune, India I saw a 70 year oldman (still strong and sturdy) carrying his 108 year old mother on his back and walking to Pandharpur for Aas'aadhi ekadashi Darshan of Vitthal because she never missed single trip in her life. I describe this as positive faith-Shraddhaa which promotes service to other human beings, relatives or not. On the other hand rational thinking is needed to avoid pitfalls. Pardon me for a long posting. N.R.Joshi.

Namaste Prof. Bhat:

My favorite quotation is from Samartha Ramadas Swami, who in his "manaace shloka" (Advise to one's own mind).

avidyaaguNe.n maanavaa Umajenaa . bhrame.n cuukale.n hiita te.n aakaLenaa .  
pariixeviNe.n baa.ndhale.n dR^iDha naaNe . parii satya mithyaa ase koNa jaaNe.n .. manaaceshloka 143 ..  
  

Meaning (liberal) : It is only due to avidyaa (and/its locus) that one is unable to realize the truth. Due to delusion (bhrama) contribute to his inability to decide for his own good. All this is because he accepted the bogus currency as being valid. (Essentially, it is one's own responsibility to evaluate and arrive are one's own conclusions after evaluating throughly.)  




Having said all this, could it be that the incorrect interpretation of term shaddha be responsible for current pathetic state of affairs in India, that breeds so many moron swami's who cleverly market themselves as self-proclaimed Guru & Paramaha.msa and continue to plague NRI !?
Once having gained acceptance from the West, they get additional firmer foundation for further exploiting innocent Indian devotees at large through shruti "maa mekam sharaNavraja".

Best regards,

Dr. Yadu

This is the advice in such matters by our Geetacharya:

न बुद्धिभेदं जनयेद्अज्ञानां कर्मसञ्गिनाम्।

जोषयेत् सर्वकर्माणि विद्वान् युक्तः समाचरन्॥ भ गी -३।२६॥



I don't know what Sri Shankaracharya has said, to the above effect. But the quoted line is the popular saying of our Kavikulaguru:

पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वं न चापि काव्यं नवमित्यवद्यम्‌ ।  
सन्तः परीक्ष्यान्यतरद्भजन्ते मूढः परप्रत्ययनेयबुद्धिः ॥

*(मालविकाग्निमित्रम् १.२)*
