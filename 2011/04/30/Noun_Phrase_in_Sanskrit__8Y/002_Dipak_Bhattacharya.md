Malaya Gangopadhyay, The Noun Phrase in Bengali MLBD1990 discusses mainly with Bengali examples. But she also brings into it relevant Sanskrit concepts namely kaaraka-relations. By noun-phrase she understands the noun with its relations in the sentence. Though no exact translation in Sanskrit is possible, Sanskrit grammarians still do well without the term noun-phrase without any deficiency in their discussion. The noun in its relation is admitted and vigorously discussed in Navya-nyaaya and Vyaakarana and also Miimaamsaa to some extent. The extent and depth of the related discussions in Sanskrit, particularly the ones in Navyanyaaya and vyaakarana are still a little explored area. One of the few scholars who worked in this area in modern times is Kamaleswar Bhattacharya. His earlier work on Jagadiisha is in French but there are at least two recent publications in English.
