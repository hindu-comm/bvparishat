Dear Shri Pathak,

As far as I know, Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase, Adjective Phrase, Adpositional  
Phrase, Quantifier Phrase, etc. are notions in modern linguistics. I have  
no idea whether Sanskrit grammars used such grammatical notions as these  
or not. My intuition is that they most probably didn't (just an intuition,  
I may be dead wrong! So please check with others and let me know if I am  
wrong. It will help me.).

Just see any good text book on generative grammar, and it will give you  
all the information you want about a phrase - its internal structure,  
function, etc.

Best wishes,  
B.N.Patnaik
