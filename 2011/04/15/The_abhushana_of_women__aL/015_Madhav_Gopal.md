"they are important for the following reasons.



a. It accentuates their inherent appeal to men.



b. Also establishes their affluence.



c. Jewelery provides a back-up option to liquidate the assets in case of emergency.



d. Even today, despite of anti-dowry movement in India; many girls (ugly) would possibly never be able to get suitors from respectable family."



 I would like to say that all these points made by Dr. Yadu are fine but can we think beyond this? We need to define beauty ("inherent appeal"), "affluence" and "respected family" again. Perhaps they are not in accordance with our shastras. What should be the beauty of a woman? Is it her physical look or her virtues like kindness, faithfulness, helpfullness, 'madhurabhaashita', 'kartavyaparaayanataa', etc. "Affluence" should bethe good conduct and knowledge of a woman or a man and not money. "Respected family" should be onewhosemembers are devoted to serve their fellowmen, the humanity honestly, and are not involved in any kind of corruption.And I think in emergency it is not jewellary that will save us but it is our patience and 'punya karmas' that will protect us. Dr. Yadu made a very good remark earlier that"the most important ornament for any Indian women is her husband (pati), "saubhaagya", "suhaaga", without they a very little place in the society". It is very much true but then wemust have tosay that aman's most important ornament is his wife and that would bein line with the saying "nana naarim nishphalaa lokayaatraa". 



Again, I leave it to the respected scholars to ascertain the minimal set of jewellary for a woman that would make her ideal lady in the society.



Thank you.



With best regards,

Madhav
