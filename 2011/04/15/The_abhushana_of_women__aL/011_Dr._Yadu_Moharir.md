Dear Prof .Korad:  

  

Thank you so much for the information.  

  

Calcium salt of Curcumin is conventionally know as "kum-kum" which is used as a saubhaagya dravya. It also exhibits anti-fungal properties.
The mode faction is attributed to irreversible binding of calcium to the cell walls of mold.  

  

Copper salts turmeric have been evaluated as a potential treatment for anti-fungal treatment for Nail fungus. It did not gain acceptance in the West because it stains. Other non-staining anti-fungal agents, such as tea-tree oil alonng with eucalyptus oil are commonly used instead.  

  

Best Regards,

  

Yadu
