Dr Yadu - Gold as a medicine  
  
In fact, I wanted to take excuse under the word 'belief' (need not necessarily offer any documentation)but later got some enthusiasm and referred to a Telugu domestic-medical -book and hereunder I produce all the details --  
  
Name of the book - Vastugun.adIpika / Dictionery of Drugs Medicinal Plants Etables & co (sic)  
Author - ErrA Venkat.aswAmigAru (gAru=esquire) , Retd Subedar 49th Regt  
First published - 1883 June 23  
Language / Script - both Telugu  
Entries in order - each in Telugu - English/Latin (Roman Script) - Sanskrit - Hindi  
Present Edition - 11th , 2004 , Number of PP - 1143 , Price - Rs 360/-  
Publishers - A.B.S.Publishers , Door No 7-30-34 , Main Road , Rajahmundry - 533 101 , Andhra Pradesh, South India  
Sources as claimed by the Author --  
1.Dhanvantarinighantu.h 2.S.ad.rasanighant.u.h 3. S'reekr.s.n.Iyam 4.DravyaratnamAlA 5.Dravyagun.aratnAvalI 6.Vastugun.aratnakos'a.h and some UnAnI works .  
Reason to write - British started their Medicine . Since India is a tropical country adnd the food habits/prepeation etc are different the same is not suitable .  
  
As most of the scholars are aware gold-powder is used in VasantkusumAkaram(for [VIryanas.t.am](http://VIryanas.t.am)) , Siddhamakaradhvajam (?) etc .  
  
According to Vastugun.adIpika --  
1.food , water and milk in a gold plate/container -- dehapus.t.i , vIryavr.ddhi , Ayurvr.ddhi , sukham, kAnti , coolness to eyes , stronger hair and good general health  
2.thinnest gold leaves - to be taken with hot rice or any 'lehyam' , dose - half leaf to one leaf each time , twice a day -- hot in nature , dhAtusamyam etc.  
3. gold grinded - almost the same .  
  
I do not have the scientific knowledge to discuss . One has to search the sources and experiment for the facts .  
In case of turmeric , copper etc. some experiments had taken place .  
The real problem is it is made highly complicated , i.e. is it just belief or true - difficult to decide .
