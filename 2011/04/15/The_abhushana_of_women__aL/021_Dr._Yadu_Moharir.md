Namaste Dr. Shrivatsa:  

  

Quote  

 with reference to your statement:  
""Medically , it is believed that, the water which touches gold is good for health ."  

  

I am not aware of any such reference. Could you please provide any specific documentation for this?"

Unquote:

  

Above statement is not mine.

  

I am aware of other compounds of Gold. I was only relating to bhasma.
All others Bhasma are oxides therefore I commented on bhasma as Gold Oxide. I wanted to elude toward this point to the Sanskrit scholars for their opinion on why specific terminologies were not used? Personally, more specific one can be better we may e able to relate and appreciate our ancient texts. Science, determines and then identifies single entity of compound only after knowing the structure. What our ayurvedaacharys, proscribed was based on their own observations and had not determined or established "Structure - Function" relationship. Many of their observations were correct but knowledge is dynamic and not static.  
  
What makes the matter worse is that current manufacturers do not really follow ancient procedures either. One example I had provided in my earlier post about "loha bhasma" from Wilkinson and 7"0clack" razor blades. (that contains Hexa valent - Chromium and is extremely toxic.)  

  
Another good example is Chavanprash. Indian manufacturers have never taken initiative to analyze heavy metals Mercury, Lead, Cadmium and Arsenic using current methodology (such as, ICP-MS). Once you see the analytical results, I can guarantee that you will never touch them with a ten foot pole. None of theses products meet the safety requirements established as per California PROP-65. That is why on one is even trying to import it from India. I have personally analyzed evaluated the data for few clients from India, after looking at them all have abndoned the idea of ever trying to market in US. I have also developed a process that would reduce the heavy metals by a factor of almost 100, essentially almost eliminate them from the product. Attempts to scale-up the process in is works but have been placed on the back burner for lack of funds. Manufacturers rather spend money on getting endorsements from movie stars, like Sharuk Khan and Amithabh.  
  
Even the process of making Amla paste, that is used for Chavanprash is not correctly followed, as most Indian manufacturers use Stainless Steel glass lines vessels. Originally Amla was cooked on a cast Iron metal sheet before adding any other ingredients. The reason for this was to reduce the Chelating effect of tannins on Iron and make product safer for vegetarians, who often suffer from Iron deficiency.. For this reason Trifala is not recommended for extended period. Here, I just wanted to point out that current manufacturing practices do not follow ancient tradition.  
  
Please do not try to convince anyone, especially me about Mercury Bhasma. It is amazing why Ayurvedic proponents are never prepared to document acute and chronic toxicity beats me? I have collected over 1000 research papers on this subject. Even if it proves to have some medicinal value is it worth to disregard the toxicity? I am sure, you must be aware that American Dental Association recommends total removal of any Silver/Gold amalgam fillings because of Mercury leaching. Norway has banned Dental amalgum and there is an international movement for the same

Some link for Mercury toxicity are given for ready reference.

Having said all of the above, it is up to an individual what they want to believe by concentrating of "paroksha j\~naa" and shraddhaa, while ignoring documented evidence by the science.  
  
Additional discussion on this subject matter may be beyond the scope of list. Interested individual may contact me off-list.  
  
Best regards,  
  
Dr. Yadu
