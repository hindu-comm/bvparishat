It is said that totally an woman should wear sixteen aabhuushana-s and this is believed to auspicious. In the smrtis-s and sutra-s too we have samskaara-s like the karnavedha, exclusively meant for aabhuushana. Even a graduate(snaataka) is supposed to wear jewels...Works like Manasollasa of Someswara, Natyasastra of Bharata, kamasutra-s of Vatsyayana and many other works deal with aabhuushana-s...However in the regional languages' literature too we have many references. Even folk tradition and literature is no exception to it. Many works on Shilpa deal with jevellary exclusively. Some purana-s such as the Vishnudharmottara too deal with jewels....Secondary sources like the writings of Anandakoomaraswamy, Motichandra, Vasudevasharan Agrawal, B.S. Upadhyaya and others who deal with the dresses and jewelery of ancient deal with the topic of your interest...This is but a hurried and off hand suggestion...
