नमस्ते।  
Svarna Bhasma, one of the many Ayurvedic preparations  
contains gold processed with herbs. There are many Siddha  
medicines which contain gold. These are to be studied and researched.  
  
It may be noted that the fresh paste of वचा(baje in Kannada) in small quantity  
is given to the babies up to 3 years for activation of the speech centre and refinement of tongue/speech. There is a special method of inserting a 24 ct  
gold wire into the वचा which is tempered in boiling milk of Indian cow. This is said to be a Siddha Yoga.  
धन्यो'स्मि
