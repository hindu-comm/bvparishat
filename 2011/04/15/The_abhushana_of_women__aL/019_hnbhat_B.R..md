I am sorry for the mistake. It was your post. I mistook it for M Madhav Deshpandey.

  

I got the quote from the net. It is ascribed to भर्तृहरि according to Subashitaratnabhandagara a treasure house of such jewels.

  

The above mistake happened probably I myself had thrown away my विभूषण of a sudden. Hope you will understand the context. One common ornament for common man like me which I forgot to wear:

  

"विभूषणं मौनमपण्डितानाम्।" which I had learnt from भर्तृहरि for certain.
