Namaste Prof. Korad:

  

For me all information is welcome and highly appreciated. Your posts are always so informative with touches facet of shastra as will as grammar and I am fortunate to have an opportunity to learn.  

  

As touched upon in one of my recent post. My concern is mainly centered around the potential toxicity of unknown, and not quantified contaminants in healthy nourishing tonic classical preparations, such as Chayanprash.  

  

Please be assured that I have the utmost respect for Ayurvedic text and their phenomenal observations, however, I am talking about current formulations and Ayurvedic physicians who have only commercial gains in their fore-site.  

  
Along with the definition you have provided from taiittariiya shruti in you r post. I also, recall "anna" being described as yad atti tadannam \| (reference requested)  

  

Thanks again

  

Best regards,

  

Dr. Yadu
