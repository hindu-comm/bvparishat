Toxicity / Mercury / Arcenic etc - to be disregarded ?  
  
The following discussion may be useful --  
  
TaittirIyopanis.at says -- adyate atti ca bhUtAni , tasmAt annam taducyate iti  
- it is being consumed and it consumes ( the consumer) , therefore it is called 'annam' (ad + kta)  
  
A person grows from a child to a young man while consuming 'annam' and after certain age (say roughly 40) , while consuming the same 'annam'
he ( his body) slowly starts decaying . That'swhy it is called 'annam" .  
  
This is '[upalaks.an.am](http://upalaks.an.am)' ( includes more such examples) .  
  
In other words , a thing may do both good and bad .  
  
Raw pepper, according to Ayurveda , causes phlegm whereas the dry pepper kills phlegm .  
  
Till yesterday the Westerners (also some followers of Indian origin) argued that ' varahInam' (marriage with an elderly girl ) is in no way Medically wrong . Recently some 10,000 people , who underwent such a marriage were interviewed in Switzerland and Ayurveda is vindicated --  
  
bAlA prAn.apradA proktA yuvatI prAn.adhArinI I  
praud.hA karoti vr.ddhatvam vr.ddhA maran.amAdis'et II  
  
-- if you marry too young a girl your longevity will increase , if she is in youth , i.e. suitable , then your longevity will be maintained , if she is older you will lose your vigour quickly and become an oldman ( without resistence etc) , if you go for a lady too older than you then you attract an early death .  
  
The generally prescribed age gap between bride and groom is 3/5/8 years .  
  
There are so many things that are useful in maintaining sound health in ayurvedic treatises .  
  
How did they come to know all these things ? Thru 'Yogipratyaks.a .  
  
It may not be out of place to mention here that my mother , when she was suffering from rheumatic pains etc(s'Ula) she was , as a final attempt , given 'DrAvakam' (Arsenic ?) , that is poisonous . The result predicted was either a stronger body or death . The former prevailed .  
  
Poisonous substances may sometimes be useful as good remedies also . It is for the Vaidya to decide depending on the constitution / strength etc.  
  
Erand.a (laxative ) ,according to Ayurveda , if given to people with weak heart they will die .  
  
Gold may have some substance within, that is not good for general health . But everybody may not have the same experience .  
  
So many kinds of Bhasmas are prescribed in Ayurveda and all of them were not just foolishly done .  
  
In Ayurveda three PramAn.as , viz. Aptopades'a , AnumAna and Pratyaks.a
are taken in Diagnosis and Prognosis . The fact is that the Books are infested with some interpolations .  
  
Age is not a big factor in Ayurveda , i.e. after forty one should undergo Medical check-up regularly etc. are not acceptable .  
  
I do not believe in fever ( am immune to fever) and infections .  
  
If Ojas , which is the cause of Balam , decreases , i.e. Oja.hks.ayam (AIDS ? ) then the body would suffer from even a small cause .  
  
Why then today most of the people suffer from diseases ? Here is (Telugu) BhAgavatam (it is Yugadharma) --  
  
alasulu mandabuddhiyutulu alpatarAyuvu  
lu ugrarogasamkalitulu mandabhAgyulu sukarma  
mulevviyu ceyajAlarI kaliyugamandu mAnavulu ....Atmaku s'Anti munIndra ceppave ?  
  
ugrarogasamkalitulu = suffereing from dreadful diseases (cause is not known)
