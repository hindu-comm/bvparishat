After reading Deshpandey's post, I wast tempted to post this list of AlaMkriyA :

  

शुचि भूषयति श्रुतं वपुः प्रशमतस् तस्य भवत्य् अलं क्रिया ।  
प्रशमाभरणं पराक्रमः स नयापादित-सिद्धि-भूषणः ।।६१४।। \[किरात. २.३२\]  
  

करे श्लाघ्यस्त्यागः शिरसि गुरुपादप्रणयिता  
मुखे सत्या वाणी विजयि भुजयोः वीर्यमतुलम्‌।  
हृदि स्वच्छवृत्ति श्रुतमधिगतं च श्रवणयोः।  
विनाऽप्यैश्वर्येण प्रकृति महतां मण्डनमिदम्‌॥  
kare ślāghyastyāgaḥ śirasi gurupādapraṇayitā  
mukhe satyā vāṇī vijayi bhujayoḥ vīryamatulam \|  
hṛdi svacchavṛtti śrutamadhigataṁ ca śravaṇayoḥ \|  
vinā’pyaiśvaryeṇa prakṛti mahatāṁ maṇḍanamidam \|\|  
Ornaments of great people are entirely different. They are all natural.  
Praise-worthy charity, for the hand; submission at the feet of the elders, for the head;  
Truthful speech, for the mouth; matchless ever victorious strength, for the arms;  
Purity of thought, for the heart and acquired knowledge of the holy scriptures, for the ears.  
These are the worthy ornaments of the great by nature (despite the absence of worldly riches.)

  

Thanks for all providing an interesting debate on golden ornaments.

  

About last mention of mercury, there had been a system of its own, रसेश्वरदर्शनम्, abridged in Sarvadarsanasangraha, with myths and truths blended together related with Shiva. There are many works quoted. If I my memory is right, it is used to get gold to create artificially, in the west and east too, by so called alchemists and no reports of successful conversion of iron into gold. May be the same lead to create of its own school of thinking in Indian context. This is only a reminiscence of what I had read.

  

And lastly, I wonder if anybody had endeavored to refer to the list of ornaments listed in Amarakosha (Kanda 2.5). May be reason that it is a too common source to be referred to.
