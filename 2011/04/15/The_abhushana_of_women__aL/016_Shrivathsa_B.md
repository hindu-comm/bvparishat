hariH OM,  
shri yadu,  
  
 with reference to your statement:

  
""Medically , it is believed that, the water which touches gold is good for health ."  

  

I am not aware of any such reference. Could you please provide any specific documentation for this?"  
  

 I like to submit that water preserved in copper and gold vessels for a certain length of time hold have lesser disease causing bacteria. Gold ions in water (even in minute quantities) are known to kill disease causing bacteria.

 In my opinion, you are trying to make the equation of "bhasma = oxide" which is not right. svarNa bhasma is svarNa bhasma, it is not Aurum oxide. You need to understand the efficacy of svarNa bhasma through the traditions of Ayurveda.  
  
 Mercury, which is another "heavy metal" does indeed have beneficial effects on patients. There is something in the process of making the bhasma which makes it beneficial. And we have to keep in mind that these "heavy metals" are given when certain bodily functions are hampered. You need to measure the effect of certain body functions being hampered against the effect of these "heavy metals".  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
