Dear kordajee and bhattajee  
Thanks for your references rasagangadhar and nagesa etc thanks for the correction also that naikah and na ekah are different . One is samas and the other is vaya . Again it is na dau and not "dauh". There cannot be abhedanvya because nipatarikta prati ...........etc rule my knowledge is limited to vyutpattivada. I will look intimation nagesa abduction bandit raja. Can anyone throw some more light regards madhu
