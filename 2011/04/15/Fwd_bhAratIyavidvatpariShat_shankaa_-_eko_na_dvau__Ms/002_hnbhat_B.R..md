I rever you always.

  

Thank you Sir for the right judgement on the issue.

  

Regarding naika, it had been suggested by Vamana in his Kavyaalankara:  
  

नैकशब्दः सुप्सुपेति समासात्॥ ५॥२॥१२॥

  

Just I didn't quote it. Whether there niranubandhaka na or not is open for debate. He suggested it to justify its usage in:

  

अरण्यानीस्थानं फलनमितनैकद्रुममिदम्\|

araṇyānīsthānaṃ phalanamitanaikadrumamidam//

(Source unknown).

  

on which the commentator explains the point exactly and it is not noted in Kahika anyway.
