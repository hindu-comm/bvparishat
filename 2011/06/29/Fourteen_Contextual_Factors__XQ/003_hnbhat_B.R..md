The below is exactly the list of 14 elements whenever there is doubt in deciding the meaning:. with introduction of 5 as generic.

  

  
वाक्यात् प्रकरणाद् अर्थाद् औचित्याद् देशकालतः\|  
शब्दार्थाः प्रविभज्यन्ते न रूपाद् एव केवलात् // वाप २.३१४ //  
  
संसर्गो विप्रयोगश्च साहचर्यं विरोधिता।  
अर्थः प्रकरणं लिङ्गं शब्दस्यान्यस्य संनिधिः // वाप २.३१५ //

  
सामर्थ्यम् औचिती देशः कालो व्यक्तिः स्वरादयः ।  

शब्दार्थस्यानवच्छेदे विशेषस्मृतिहेतवः // वाप २.३१६ //

  

These are generally accepted as the factors in deciding the meaning in any doubtful case. Each of these are illustrated in काव्यप्रकाश of मम्मटाचार्य with the exception of the last, as it is not applicable generally to poetical language but he added gesture as additional factor under the कारिका -

  

अनेकार्थस्य शब्दस्य वाचकत्वे नियन्त्रिते।

  

The factors restricting the meaning to the context as listed by quoting the above lines. The Commentary of Helaraja too



Where he mentioned that only सामर्थ्य and औचित्य only are important, I could not say.
