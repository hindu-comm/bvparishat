Namaste Dr. Bhattacharya:

  

How fundamental yet profound, as they say that hits on the head.  

  

This reminds me of a huge poster I had in my office with a caption:

"To Err is Human but to make a mess you need a computer".

  

There is no substitute for mind the sixth indriiya, which needs to be developed and sharpened for it's discriminative capabilities based on knowledge..  

  

Best regards,

  

Dr. Yadu
