Respected Professor Kulkarni Madam,

Thank you very much for specific clarifications. With a view to availing मनोरथः  
I tried with मनस् + रथः as well. It gives मनः रथः with respective rule  
applications. By trying मातॄः + रामाः I got मातर्रामाः (As ॠ being already a  
दीर्घः there is no extra requirement of lengthening). So it is clear that it is  
working well with the utsarga rules and in some apavada rules as well. I got a  
positive result on वाल्मीकिः + रामः as वाल्मीकी रामः but there had no display of  
anything when I tried शम्भुः + राजते; but well and correctly with शम्भुः + रामः  
= शम्भू रामः having supporting rules. And is it not the case that Madam, as the  
engine treats the visarga with its preceding vowels differently in पुनः (अ),  
वाल्मीकिः (इ), शम्भुः (उ), and मातॄः (ॠ) - the Accusative Plural of मातृ - etc.

  
Regards,  
Narayanan
