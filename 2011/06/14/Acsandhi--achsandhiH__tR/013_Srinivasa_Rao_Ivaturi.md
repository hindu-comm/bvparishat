Respected Prof. Kulkarni Madam  
  
As you mentioned the programme gave the result अच् + सन्धिः as अच्सन्धिः with the explanation that the applying sutra is खरि च. But is there a scope of  
खरि च here? My question is about the application of स्तुना श्चुः for which brother Dr. Korada gave the answer that for the sake of clarity Panini Muni himself  
did not affect sandhis at some places,and this was one such instance. (vide Laghusabdendusekhara). Sorry if I am mistaken, but I don't think there is any question of chartva here.  
  
Again to Dr. Korada: Brother this may be rudimentary, please bear my wondering aloud. What about any expression such as " in the world of vowels" which I may choose to use in general conversation or a book, which has no status of sutra, vaartika, bhaashya etc. अच्संसारे, what about the application of the shcutva rule?  
  
Regards  
Srinivasa Rao
