Namaste,  
Respected Scholars, as a student of present time i need computer  
technology. but i like to request you to note the past and present.  
Dr. Korada sir is saying true, we students has not even studied 5% of  
shastras.

My teacher was saying to me, that time college syllabus was that much  
accurate to understand the shastras and the आचार्याः dedicated there  
whole life to teach shastras to them. Vaiyakarana Siddhantakaumudi,  
Mahabhashya, praudamanorama, paribhashendushekhara, prakriya sarvasva,  
including Nyaya, vaisheshika, Mimamsa, Jyotisa, Sahitya whole books  
they included in syllabus.

present time, we are studying madhya sidhanta kaumudi sandhi samasa  
only, still unable to complete the syllabus in our class room.  
Praudamanorama some part, minimum 20 paribhashas, mahabhashya 3  
aahnikas maximum. we cant compare the syllabus of old and new. now  
please say us, how we will stand in front of the acharyas like  
bvparishat. Present time we have scholars like Professor Bhat,  
Professor Korada and Professor Kiparsky etc as Narayanan sir has  
already mentioned. But what about future, we have to depend machines  
for studying shastras..

i request the respected scholars in bvparishat, now the time is to  
make a way to balance this big gap. without that, making machine  
systems will not workout. Naryaanan Sir is correct, computer will  
support us in many ways. but i feel before thinking about machine we  
have to think about human.  
Bhattacharya sir given in his comment "common sense tells that that is  
hal-sandhi"..first we have to try to make that common sense.. then we  
can use any machines for our study purpose .

Thanking You

Manoj kumar
