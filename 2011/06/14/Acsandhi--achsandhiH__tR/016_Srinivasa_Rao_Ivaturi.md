@Dr\. H. N. Bhat  
Sir,  
Thanks for the interest you have shown in clarifying my doubt. But the said Sandhi Engine of Madam Kulakarni gives the form as अच्सन्धिः and explains the rule as खरि च। Also for अच् + त्वम् it gives the form अच्च्वम् and the rule as श्चुत्व।  
Let's get some more enlightenment from Dr. Korada.
