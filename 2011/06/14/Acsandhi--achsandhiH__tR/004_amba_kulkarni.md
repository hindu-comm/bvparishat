Dear Sir,  
  
Yes, you are right. The Sandhi engines are meant for one who is in doubt about the result. At the same time, since these sandhi engine also show the process, and the rules that are being used, they also help a student.  
  
For example, if you look at the output of the 'अच् + सन्धिः' , it not only produces the sandhied form 'अच्सन्धिः' but also states the particular sandhi rule viz. 'चर्त्व-सन्धिः' followed by the suutra or vaartika, in this case 'खरि च (8।4।55)'. Please refer to the screenshot attached herewith. (ac.png).  
  
In case there are multiple sandhied forms are possible, it also shows all possible sandhied forms.  
I have attached a screenshot of 'लक्ष्मीवान् + शुभलक्षणः'. (pl refer to the [multiple_ops.png](http://?--ls-temp--=f_goxtvkqc0) )  
As you notice, it not only tells you the possible sandhied forms, but also shows the process citing the rules.  
  
I have pointed out this website only in response to the website mentioned in the original query, which is not well tested and thus may mislead the students.  
  
However the websites mentioned by me are well tested and hence students can rely on them.  
  
With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
