Dear Sir,

Thank you Prof. Bhat for the reply. Yes, you are right, we have not  
yet handled all the exceptional cases.

Let me explain the problem.

a\) In case of 'रामः + रमते' the visarga of rAma is because of su -> s -  
\> ru (ससजुषो रुः) -> r -> :  
But in case of sandhi, after 's' changes to 'ru', because of 'हशि च'  
'ru' changes to 'u', not giving a scope for इत् कार्य.

b\) while in case of punar, there is only one rule 'r -> :'  
In case of sandhi, since there were no 'ru', there is no scope for हशि  
च and रो रि applies.

So when we do sandhi, we should know whether the ':' is due to the  
prakriyaa 'su -> s -> ru (ससजुषो रुः) -> r -> :'  
or due to 'r -> :'.

A simple way to do this is, list all the padas that end in 'r', and  
treat them as an exception to हशि च.

As of now we have just handled the general case.  
Now based on your feedback, I'll update the 'अपवाद' cases to handle  
'punar', etc.

I would appreciate if anybody can provide me a list of all 'r' ending  
padas.

Regarding Prof. Bhat's comment on the बाले इमे, yes still we have not  
linked our sandhi program with the 'शब्द विश्लेषक'.  
So machine fails. This task is in our agenda, and will do it.

Thank you Narayana ji for the feedback.

With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
