नमो विद्वद्भ्यः!  
A small doubt. Will anyone please clarify?  
In अच्+ सन्धिः does स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः apply or not? It seems not, but what is the exception?  
The Sandhi Engine of Chetan Pandey (http://sarovar.org/frs/download.php/1232/sandhi.jar) however gives the result as:  
अच्शन्धिः which seems odd.  
Please explain.
