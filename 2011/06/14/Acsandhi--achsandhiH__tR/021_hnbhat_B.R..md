Thanks Dear Prof. Korada for your promise to help the present generation with your accumulated knowledge. Waiting eagerly for it.

  

By the way, still the question raised originally by Mr.Shrinivasa Rao is waiting something to clear his doubt. I too expect it from you.

  

In the case of the word, अच्+सन्धिः, and अच्+तु, अच्पदेन etc. is it not the application of "चोः कुः" is expected which would change it into अक्सन्धिः, अक् तु (खरि च or अच् चु by श्चुत्व?) which was the original question of Srinivasa Rao. If पदान्तकार्य is not applied, then अच् तु will be the sequence, and yet the question is whether श्चुत्व is applicable here or not.  It is a different thing, it any change is not applied here for the sake of clarity. But the question is pointed on the applicability of the Sutra in the present case. He wanted to know what function of "sandhi" was avoided here for clarity.

  

Thanking in advance
