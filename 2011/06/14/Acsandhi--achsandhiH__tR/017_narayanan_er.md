You are exactly right Dr. Bhattacharya, that human learning capacity may be far better any machine. But at the same time, once the concept is encoded in any machine having memory and the speed on target can be made faster to the point with the help of electromagnetic waves. In the mid nineties I had to travel daily by bus 120 kilometers to and fro to learn the Praudhamanorama from my guru; whereas there had no telephone, mobile, internet etc in any village to clear immediate doubts. But the machines having memory and the speed with the help of electromagnetic waves provide good facilities and the benefit we have to appreciate. Nowadays I clear my doubts with the help of the scholars like you, Professor Bhat, Professor Korada and Professor Kiparsky etc.; chiefly through the Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat. Linux in the forms of Ubuntu, Kubuntu provides Unicode Font facility for search in various languages!!! What an advance through the hard work of some dedicated people!! Sir, Am I wrong? So, I feel that working together with Sanskrit Shastras and Computer Technology cannot be a waste of time. Thanks.
