It can be expected of machine fed rules.

  

Try कवी+इमौ - it should give कवीमौ।

  

or कवी + एतौ - It gives कव्येतौ and कवी एतौ

  

Not all the exceptions are fed, I supposte.

  

Try बाले इमे द्वि.व. of बाला इमे (Can't recognize the ending) here from

  

बाले इह बाल इह, बालयिह loc. masculine.

  

Some other shortcomings may be found. Hope this would be rectified in due course of development of the engine.
