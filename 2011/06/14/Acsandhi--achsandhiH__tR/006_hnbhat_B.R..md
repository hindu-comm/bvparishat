Simply because the conditions are not the same in both.



In the second, it works because it fulfils the condition, both स्तोः श्चुना शुः, and नश्छव्यप्रशान्. I don't think in the first, there is any chance of change in the first due to Sandhi.



If youdesire the result,पुंस्कोकिलः, it should be a compound and internal sandhi between the two stems पुंस् + कोकिल which requires some rules and the Vartika, to get two alternative forms, including पुंस्कोकिलः and in the sequence you have given, I think no change due to Sandhi is required.



With regards
