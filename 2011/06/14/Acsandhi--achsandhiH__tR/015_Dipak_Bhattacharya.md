Errors are bound to occur. Long ago I prepared a package on the kṣaiprasandhis for my students in DOS Quick Basic; that will look too complex and unacceptable to those who are used to Windows so that I had to leave it with the department where nobody would use such a Windows incompatible complex engine. It worked till the prakṛtibhāvas. If I had to include the exceptions it would have become unmanageable. As I see from the packages available on the internet the situation has not much improved from the DOS days of the early nineties in spite of the huge enhancement of the memory of the processors. May be someone will succeed but why this unnecessary waste of labour when one can learn the rules with powers given by God? |
