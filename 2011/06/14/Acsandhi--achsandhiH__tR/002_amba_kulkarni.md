A well tested sandhi package is available at <http://202.41.85.24/scl/sandhi/>  
(<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/scl/sandhi>)  
(I have mentioned the IP number also, because sometimes if the DNS is  
down, you may not be able to connect it with the domain name.)  
This works for the external sandhi, i.e. the sandhi between two  
'pada's.  
  
Another well tested package is available at <http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/sandhi.html>  
However this package does not mention the name of the sutra used.  
  
These two softwares are reliable and I would suggest you use them.  
  
With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
