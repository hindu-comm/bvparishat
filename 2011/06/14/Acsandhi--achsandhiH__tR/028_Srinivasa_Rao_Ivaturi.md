@Dr\. Korada  
Thanks for the details.  
The misfortune is that at Degree II language level we do not teach SutrAs. Only the rUpAs. Over years this makes one lose touch with the sUtrAs try however he may to keep them in mind. Then Brothers like you and forums like these come to our rescue.  
*As we climb up and up, it is the beginnings we get doubts about.And we can't climb down to inspect them!*  
If now I take KaumudI into my hands, I become a novice and get all sorts of doubts, and can't even complete the संज्ञा.  
Well to sum up:  
Neither Kutva not Scutva can be applied here, and there is no question of Khari ca.  
  
Srinivasa Rao
