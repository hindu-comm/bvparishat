I am sharing my view on the above. It should be अक्सन्धिः if it is compound word, as each of the compound words are पद independently. So "झलां जशो ऽन्ते" "वावसाने" "खरि च" इति विभक्तिलोपे कृते, चर्त्वस्य सावकाशत्वात् चर्त्वे कृते, श्चुत्वस्यानवकाश एव। अच् + सुइत्यादौ तु प्रत्ययादित्वात्,"आदेशप्रत्यययोः" इति षकारात् तत्रानवकाश एव।



Like तिर्यग्जन्तुः, or तिर्यक्चेतनः,प्राक्तनम्, (you cannot expect here प्राच् + तन - प्राच्चन compared to तत्+चित्तम् - तच्चित्तम्). Hope this will explain, the difference. Ambal Kulkarni seems to be right in recognizing as चर्त्वसन्धि. Prof. Korada only expained that Sandhi was not made for the sake of clarity. Since if it is said as अक्सन्धि, it would be confusing as there is another pratyaahaara too अक्. But that didn't confirm the application or non-applicability ofश्चुत्व here in the compound.



One again I would request on your behalf, Prof. Korada to view this point for clarification. This is just my observation not precisely technical opinion on the issue.



Otherwise, in the case of अच् and सन्धिः as isolated words without compound too "चोः कुः" will function first and अक् or अग् will be the resultant form on nominative singular and now too there is no chance for श्चुत्व. Since declensional operation takes place first of all than the external sandhi rules, it is not available at all in this case, even though a सामानाधिकरण्य is established betwen the two words because अच् itself is not reallya name of Sandhi, (butthe compound denotes the class of Sandhi in which changes of vowels take place).



Errors and Omissions Expected. Please notify if any noiced and I will correct them.
