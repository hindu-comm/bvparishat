Dear Scholar Friends,  
saadaraM praNamyA. Have you ever heard of the following verse in  
Sanskrit? It seems peculiar in its nature to comprehend its  
meaning.  
The Verse is:" चतुर्भिश्च चतुर्भिश्च द्वाभ्यां पञ्चभिरेव च। हूयते च  
पुनर्द्वाभ्यां स मे विष्णुः प्रसीदतु॥" Could any one of our scholar  
friends enlighten  
me with its comprehensive meaning.  
Regards,  
insacharya.
