Srimad Bhagavad Gita contains the essence of all our Upanishads. Pujya Gurudev Swami Chinmayananda conducted more than 500 Gita Jnana Yajnas, conveying the teachings of our ancient sages to the modern world. Now, Chinmaya International Foundation carries the work forward by offering a Bhagavad Gita Home Study Course in easy modules so that people can study it at their own pace at a convenient time, in the mode of their choice, whether by post or by email.

  
This course, authored by Pujya Guruji Swami Tejomayananda and edited by a team of scholars from CIF, offers a complete and systematic study of Bhagavad Gita with a step by step elucidation of the verses in the holy text, bringing out their relevance in our daily life. Each lesson is accompanied by a full-fledged questionnaire which helps to assess one’s grasp of the facts offered in the lesson, while giving enough scope for reflection and personal assimilation. Thus the course becomes interactive, clarifies our doubts and guides our understanding along the right direction.

  
It is to be noted that this course is not a replication of The Holy Gita, the famous commentary on the text by Pujya Gurudev. This is a highly personalised course which eventually helps us to understand the full significance of the matters discussed by Pujya Gurudev in his commentary. The special feature of this course is its easy flowing style that demarcates the points clearly, while offering a profusion of illustrations from our day-to-day experiences.



This Guru Purnima Day, treat yourself to this prasada from the Guru Parampara and also offer it as a gift to your friends on the spiritual path.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
