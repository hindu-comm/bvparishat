to me : originally Yaksas belonged to Yaj cult. Yaska also belongs to that tradition due to the similarity of the name and may have relation to Avestan Yasna. Slowly it took different shape and took the position of a hero in the Megh0 of Kalidasa. In iconography it is depicted differently. Even in ancient paintings, it has a number of varieties of shapes. How: ugly/vulgar? the history is not uniform. May be: sacrifice> sacrificial money> physical power in the form of protective forces>mystic powers and romantic figure \> bad in ethical values> vulgar face etc. Their interse relation is to be established by scholars on the basis of other fields of scholarship including mysticism and aesthetics.
