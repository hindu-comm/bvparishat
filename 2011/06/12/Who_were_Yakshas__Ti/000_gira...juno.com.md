Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Who were Yakshas?



We all believe RAma from RamayaNa was historical personality. That makes RAvaNa king of RAkshasas historical. That makes his half brother Kubera historical. Kubera was king of Yakshas. His capital was AlkAvati. If RAvaNa’s capital was in Ceylone (now called LankA), where was AlkApuri? Sometimes Yakshas were placed in Himalayas. This looks a difficult picture for India-RAkshasas at the feet and Yakshas on the head. Now RAvaNa conquered AlkApuri and drove Kuber out of it. Kubera was the son of Visravas by Idavida. Besides being lord of riches, he was described as having three legs, eight teeth and yellow mark in place of one eye with deformed body. However there are references describing Yakshas as models of beauty (see p.203-Yaksha worship in Kurukshetra by O.P. Bharadwaj in PrAchi PrabhA-editor D.C. Bhattacharya). Of course RambhA the wife of Nalakubera (son of Kubera) was certainly beautiful lady. The word Yaksha occurs several time in Rigveda. It occurs in Atharvaveda with mix character of Yaksha-helpful as well soul-possessing monster. Kurukshetra was described as having Yakshas as guardian deities. The four guardian Yakshas were Tarantuka, Arantuka, Kapila and Macakruka (p.207-PrAchi-PrabhA). Yakshi UlookhalamekhalA was supposed to be wife of Kapila Yaksha of RAmahrada. That brings me to the book of Savitri Saxena (p.97) describing boundaries of Kurukshestra-from Arantuka to Tarantuka and from RAmahrada to Macakruka. Now I think these were actually boundaries of Mahabharata Empire. If we accept these were names of Yakshas, then the story ends. But if we accept these as boundaries of the empire, then new picture rises. In the DeerghanikAya two Yakshas were mentioned as guardians of two cities-Yugandhara (northeast) and Serisaka(northwest). AathanAtiya Sutta contains description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru. And many times one comes across joint name Kuru-Yugandharau. And when Bheema went towards north to bring Saugandhika lotus flowers, he was stopped by Yaksha soldiers. This clearly shows Yakshas were way up in the north-pole side. This clearly shows that Mahabharata Empire was not confined to some northern portion of ancient India as meticulously framed by Shri O.P.Bharadwaj in his book rarely giving attention to the countries outside of the subcontinent (Studies in the Historical Geography of Ancient India-1986. The book is very informative). We have already seen that ancient regions of Shaka, VAhlika, Tushar, Stree-rajya were outside of the Indian subcontinent. The book of Ananda K. Kumaraswamy on Yaksas is very interesting. It talks about “rakshamah (let us guard) and “yakshamah” (let us gobble). It also mentions that a toll-house was called Yaksha-sthAna in ancient India. Our next task is to find, RAmahrada, Macakruka, Arantuka and Tarantuka. That will explain presence of Indo-Aryans in ancient Europe.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
