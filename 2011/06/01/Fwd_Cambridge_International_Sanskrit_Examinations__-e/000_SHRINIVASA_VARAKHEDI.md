Dear Professor Tripathi,

I hope you will pardon this unsolicited email, which my friend Dr Sadananda Das, who lectures in Sanskrit at Leipzig Unversity, suggested that I send.

Since 1975 St James Schools in London have successfully taught Sanskrit at primary and secondary levels. We have developed coherent courses which are regularly being improved and updated. The students who continue their studies to IGCSE and AS or A Level are highly appreciative of the language itself as well as the introduction which they receive to the cultural and philosophical ideas provided by the syllabus which is followed.

The public examinations are provided by the Cambridge International Examinations Board (CIE) based in Britain. They are available throughout the world and are highly respected by institutions internationally.
Thus they are of great benefit to young people both within and beyond their own national boundaries.

Although we are aware that school students in India can take national examinations in Sanskrit we feel that there could be an extra benefit to them by taking these CIE examinations either in addition to the national examinations or as a viable, or even more attractive, alternative. The questions on the examination papers are framed in English and so the gaining of good grades helps to demonstrate a good grasp of English as well as Sanskrit.

This initiative to teach Sanskrit to children is gradually being picked up by some other schools in Britain and elsewhere in the world and we are doing all we can to promote the virtues of the Sanskrit language and the magnificent literature available. It has become evident that, due to inevitable commercial pressures upon the examination board, we do need to encourage more candidates to come forward to sit the examinations.

Please see the Sanskrit examinations site below for further information about these examinations. I wondered if you might be kind enough to suggest ways in which awareness of the existence of these examinations could be raised in India and students given the opportunity to take the CIE examinations.

Yours sincerely,

Warwick Jessup
