Respected Scholars,  
Namaskaarah. In the sutra : श्याऽऽद्व्यधास्रुसंस्र्वतीणवसावहृलिहश्लिषश्वसश्च (3-1-141), we see some variations while counting these roots in their names. Some are prefixed and some are not. While prefixed, ण will be affixed barring क and so on. I will certainly be blessed if the respected scholars split with prefixes and root variants in the sutra. Root variants from different commentaries are also entertained. I mean :  
  
1. a. अव + श्यैङ् + ण =  
 b. प्रति + श्यैङ् + ण =  
  
2. a. आङ् + स्रु (or श्रु) + ण =  
 b. सम् + स्रु (or श्रु) + ण = regarding these two examples the Tattvabodhinii comments that आश्रु and साश्रु are not in the आकरः। The usage of Sriharsha in the Naishadha : अनाश्रवावः (श्रु with आङ् & नञ् ) is also quoted there. Can I get a list of prefixes and roots from this sutra please?  



Regards,  
Narayanan
