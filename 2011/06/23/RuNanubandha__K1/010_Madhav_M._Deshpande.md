Thanks for bringing this verse to our attention. The word ṛṇānubandha  
occurs in Marathi in a famous poem sung by Kumar Gandharva  
(ṛṇānubandhācyā ... paḍalyā gāṭhī). The general sense of the term in  
its Marathi usage is that things happen through some unknown karmic  
bonds, literally we owe a (karmic) debt. I had not previously seen  
this expression in a Sanskrit text, but now this verse makes the  
karmic causation behind this expression very clear. Thanks once  
again.
