Respected Sir,  
one respected person has posted here "Sanskrit removing" and the  
result you have seen, whole nation supported.. not only sanskrit  
students..all the person from Kanyakumari to Kashmir who loves our  
country.. what krishnakumar said, it was not his problem..it was the  
problem of ours. today i faced, tomorrow some body else. if Sanskrit  
students face a problem then we have to discuss in bvparishat..present  
time sanskrit students and researchers also facing the same thing. As  
my little knowledge i feels Indology means academic study of the  
history and cultures, languages, and literature of the Indian  
subcontinent.if we are thinking bvparishat is not an apt forum for  
discussing our social problems, what the purpose of this big respected  
group..i can say this is the best group to discuss our social  
problems, because our respected scholars has that much knowledge about  
our culture.. I am sure, this will be the only one group they have the  
sound knowledge of arthashastra, viduraniti and Kamandakiya  
nitishastra etc etc.. surprise to see the words "regarding sanskrit  
and Indology". we are not different from social problems of our  
country, because a good education system can change anything.

Respected Tandia ji, i am accepting reservation needed but not in  
education. In Education, we have to see only the quality of a  
student.. In class rooms all the students are equal..there is no upper  
class or middle class.

For your information in "Common entrance test" all the state has there  
own quota..special category candidates, reserved category  
candidates(SC,ST,OBC,OC), candidates belonging to rural area, state  
language like Malayalam, Kannada, Marathi medium candidates and for  
wards of Jammu and Kashmiri migrants etc..we are saying we Indians are  
one..same time we are giving education to our children that we are  
different from one another by separating them by cast, state and  
another catagory..

i am a student from Kerala, first time i have given a comment in open  
forum..excuse me if i wrote something wrong.

thank you  
Manoj kumar
