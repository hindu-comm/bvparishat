***Respected Scholars,***  
  
 There is some imbalance in the society like upper and lower in the field of Education, property, Economically backwardness, value or status and so on. So, for making the equal balance of the society there should be some reservation to downtrodden or lower section people. Because of their needy and economical problem they are unable to reach to the equal status of the society. If the reservation won't be there then, how the backward people can fill the gap of their need in the society. And then, always the upper division people will be in the upper state and lower division people will be in the lower state. The quality of being the same in quantity or measure or value or status in the society, have the right of every one. But, still now the people are struggling a lot for existence in the society with hard labour as a servant even with quota or reservation. So far, reservation is require for lower section people. Except above mentioned statement there is no meant for quota or reservation.
