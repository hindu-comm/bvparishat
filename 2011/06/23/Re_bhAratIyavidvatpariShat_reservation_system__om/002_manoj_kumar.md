Namaste Krishnakumar,  
i expect this your second attempt to say what is happening in present  
time..first time i have not given any comment, but this time i like to  
appreciate your courage what you have written here. My request to you,  
never expect anything from here or anywhere. you have to fight for  
your life, or we have to fight for our own life..this is the sadness,  
no one accept the reality..In India stage performance only  
workout..the system will never change because we only comment..and  
will request others. do some thing..do something..  
  
So do the best where ever u are that is my policy. I am always thinks  
in one direction " you help at least one person and ask him to help  
one person and so on................. irrespective of cast, community,  
place (region), langauge, position/status etc. what so ever may be.  
The help may be in the form of subject/technical guidance, word,  
charity so on......... Definitely they will pray for us.  
  
all the best and hearty wishes  
  
Manoj Kumar
