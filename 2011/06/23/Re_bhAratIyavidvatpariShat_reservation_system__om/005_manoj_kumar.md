respected Sir,  
i cant understand why you are saying this is not an apt platform to  
discuss this topic.. this is not our problem what we are facing today.  
i faced the same problem in Kerala..we can run by saying this is not  
an apt platform..sorry to say, what krishnakumar has written that is  
the actual truth what is happening today.

Mr.Krishnakumar has deleted his comment by saying sorry, so iam  
stoping this topic

Thank you

  
manojkumar
