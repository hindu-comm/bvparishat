Respected Manoj Kumar ji,  
  
I don't negate that what Krishna Kumar ji says is true. But I want to say BVP is not meant to **solve** or **discuss** political or social problems. This issue has been raised whenever BVP started, that here nothing other than issues clearly regarding sanskrit and Indology will be entertained here.  
  
I respect your spirit and also have some views on these social matters. I invite you to start a similar group where we can discuss these issues separately.  
  
I request the BVP management to give a clear message regarding this.
