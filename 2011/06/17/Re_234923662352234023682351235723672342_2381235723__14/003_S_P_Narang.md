Rishabha in the Atharva Veda

Dr. Satya Pal Narang

On Vratyas : In the XVth chapter of the AV there is a description of the Vratyas which can only be understood symbolically. The main features of Vratyas are their intelligence (Hamsa); an orator (stanayitny) having a relation to the trade of foodÂ­grains (anna); having a blend of faith (sraddha) and Yajna; their migration to the South direction in the form of Indra (perhaps where Indra could not reach) and their stability (svadha) in the south (Yama-loka). Can this type of migration be identified as the migration of Vegetarian, non-sacrificers Jains to the South from Sindhu {Indus?) which was eclipsed by Indra and all his confiderates who forced Vratyas and Panis to go out of Sindhu and which was ruled mainly by Brhaspati and his preceptor Angiras?

  

The paper is published in KC Acharya Memorial Volume and elsewhere also. Regards, spnarang
