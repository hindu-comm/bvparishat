Who were Vaatryaas?



Dear Dr. Bhagwan Singh, It is always pleasure to get new information from you. You are right, tribes from ancient India has moved their locations several times in the known history of 2500 years of India. Like many other Indians I have interest in the history of Mahabharat because of Bhagwan Krishna. Now I read in the book of O.P.Bharadvaj (Studies in the Historical Geography of Ancient India-p.227) ) that Krishna's tribes Vrishnis, Yadavas, Andhaka were treated as Vaatryaas out -of the Aryan fold or out of Brahmanism. This makes me uneasy. The book presents picture that only Kuru-Bharatas (occupying small region of northern India ) were authentic Aryans or sactioned high position by Brahmanas and hundreds of other tribes of the ancient India were either Shudras or Vaatryas-perhaps because they could not speak the pure Sanskrit of Brahmans or do not support sacrifice rituals.. There is even Vaatryastoma ritual to bring Vaatryas in the fold of Brahmanism. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
