Thanks Prof Narang and Dr. Bhagwan Singh for additional information related to Yakshas (Yakhas). Yakkhas were found in Maldiv and Ceylone islands. They were present in Central America-Yakhas. Since subject of ancient tribes of the subcontinent came, I have a simple question- Vis'Anins were tribe in the northwest region of the subcontinent (now region of Pakistan). Are Vis'Anins the same as Pichashas? There was Paichashi language in the ancient time. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
