Respected Scholars,  
It is clear that the term "unit" is used in many meanings in English.  
Let us see Professor Chaitanya's examples with the term ''unit''-  
1. Meter is a unit of length. (दैर्घ्यपरिमाणे Meter)  
2. Gram is a unit of weight. (भारपरिमाणे Gram)  
3. Second is a unit of time. (कालपरिमाणे Second). Here all unit meanings are परिमाणार्थः।  
We can add : द्रोणः is a unit of volume. (द्रोणो व्रीहिः); see Panini sutra: 2-3-46. (द्रोणः is a container / vessel)  
"Govinda gets one unit of wheat from the Ration Shop "  
Dr. Rakesh Das provided an example : word is the smallest unit (लघिष्ठः अंशः) of a sentence. Here परिमाण can hardly match.  
Then if we use, "There is big fuse unit near the transformer"; then the meaning of unit (योजकस्य आधारः) is the base of a contact fuse-bridge. Here the meanings like neither परिमाण nor अंशः / अङ्ग nothing to do with a fuse unit whether it is broken, big or small.  
  
I share a popular story with you in this regard : A teacher asked the students to translate into English from Sanskrit; and he provided them a Sanskrit sentence : "राज्ञः दशरथस्य तिस्रः महिष्यः आसन्।"  
Knowingly, one naughty student answered : "King Dasharatha had three she-buffaloes".  
  
We may still see more and more different meanings for "unit" in the English Dictionary. But it is extremely difficult to run after the appropriate Sanskrit usages.  



Regards,  
Narayanan
