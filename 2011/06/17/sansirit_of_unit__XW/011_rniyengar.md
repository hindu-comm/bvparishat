Namaste! My intuitive understanding is unit= एककम्  
My reasoning is as follows: 'Unit' is that, integral multiples of  
which gives the collective result. When we say meter is the unit of  
measurement, what is implied is the final length will be multiples of  
"1-meter", say 2 m, 3 m etc. In most of the situations 'unit' is in  
the sense of a singleton or single group (of more than one object). A  
"unit" as an object may be further subdivisible into smaller parts but  
the smallest is not necessarily always the Unit. We may measure time  
in units of minute or hour or घटिका, मुहूर्त...  
The concept behind forming a unit or naming something as Unit is  
'relative' to others. In स्तोत्रकाव्य we come across पञ्चक, शतक etc.  
These are essentially 'units' of Fives, Hundreds etc. One can say  
"there are four पञ्चक printed in this book".  
There is a Vedic usage एकाकी चरति. It is usual to translate एकाकी as  
'alone'. But the above is used for Sun as being 'Single'. 'Unit'  
also reflects a sense of 'singleness'  
Extending this logic backwards unit= एककम्  
If there is any thing wrong in the above I may be excused  
धन्यो'स्मि
