Dr. Sadasiva Murty garu!  
  
Though, this can be interpreted as pitiable condition, I welcome this  
as an awakening and uniting opportunity for many of us.  
  
First of all, admission information is disseminated to all the  
members. (Similarly other esteemed faculty can keep posting about the  
commencement of courses and annual academic calenders.)  
  
Apart from what Sri Srinivasa Varakhedi has expressed; I have more to  
add.  
  
Tradition stream of Students in Sanskrit need an opening avenue; by  
the way of Entrance or BPP (similar to Bachelor's Preparatory course  
18 Credits of IGNOU); so that they can jump start into MA or BA; after  
the completion of their traditional systematic studies.  
  
As many of us have experienced,it would be a cakewalk - for them and  
also hone skills of writing. As many of you are on Syndicate/ Senates  
of Institutions, kindly consider that.  
  
And it would also be relevant to mention a single source of  
information,regarding various courses of Samskruta offered by  
academies/ schools/ colleges/ varsities across India along with the  
updated info on Academic Calendars.  
  
Regards  
Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi
