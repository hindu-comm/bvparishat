Dear Members,

  

This is really a pitiable condition. The same situation prevails everywhere in university departments. We need to attract students by improving our teaching qualities and showing them new openings and opportunities.

  

We the teachers are responsible for this situation. Yes, the supportdefinitely makes difference and motivates students to study sanskrit. But, this could be just a Guda-jihvikaa. We need to think long term solutions.

  

We are working on this problem in Karnataka state starting from Oriental schools to colleges and in University system.

  

Prof. Mahadevan - Dean IIMB, stresses on Strategic transformation of Sanskrit Education and Research in India in his paper. We need to look at new strategies forsurvival.

  

warm regards,

shrivarakhedi
