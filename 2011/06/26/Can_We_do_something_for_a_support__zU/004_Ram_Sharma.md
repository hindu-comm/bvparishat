Saa vidyaa yaa niyuktaye-is now the only guiding factor of education.Besides,despite the verdict of the Supreme Court,as well as despite the special position given to Sanskrit in our CONSTITUTION,,Sanskrit is slowly and gradually losing its position in Secondary/Higher Secondary schools on account of misguided advice of a few so called educationists .Formerly Sanskrit was suffering due to" burden of languages" .Now French and German will not add to the linguistic burden, according to the same class of educationists.

 The Rastriya Sanskrit SaMsthanam ,has fortunately quite a good number of attractive SKT positions.Number of students in the various campuses is also enormous.If somehow a system of AAdanapradaana between Samsthanam and modern colleges /Universities is established(forgetting the complexes we have so far been suffering from ) that might improve the situation both ways.
