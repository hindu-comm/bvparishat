My name is surendra I am a student in the dept. of sanskrit A.U. 2005-07. I motivated many of my juniors to join in the dept. but many students are not interested because of expenses in A.U. weather it is academic or non-academic. Just 2 years before sanskrit stream is pulled out of my degree college. In my view this is the time to improve sanskrit in graduation level. some of my juniors saying that they are not getting proper guidance from faculty but i don't have this problem when i am studying there. scholars may think for appropriate measurements.
