Dear Friends and Colleagues,



I would like to bring to your attention to a symposium on the **Origin of Indian Civilization organized by the Center for Indic Studies is organizing on July 8-9, 2011.**



In 2006, the Center for Indic Studies at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth organized a symposium on the Origin of Indian Civilization, inviting historians, philosophers, astronomers, archeologists, geneticists, linguists, and mathematicians. This was first open meeting of this sort, and there were sparks of disagreements on usual fault lines of political entrenchment of disciplinary scholarship. However, progress was made to the extent that scholars from different fields were able to learn and appreciate perspectives of disciplines other than their own.

Proceedings of the 2006 Symposium is now published by DKPW publishers, a reputable publisher in Indology (<http://www.dkprintworld.com/product-detail.php?pid=1280856795>). The book is also available at [amazon.com](http://amazon.com/).



Indian civilization, considered as the only living ancient civilization, has remained fancy of scholars, travelers, businessmen, rulers, and seekers of truth for millennia. And, this level of broad interest in people throughout the history has obviously attracted controversies of all kinds, including debate about the Indian civilization's origin itself.



There are a variety of aspects which have been considered in the past by scholars to examine the origin an d practice of Indian civilization. These have included traditional fields of studies such as linguistics, archeology, history, philosophy, and, of course, politics, but lately other more modern and scientific fields have begun to explore and compliment the information obtained from traditional fields. These fields have included natural history, genetics, physics and astronomy, mathematics, computer science, psychology, and neuroscience.



Origin of Indian civilization has been marred by conflicting debate on whether it has largely indigenous origin or is largely influenced by outside invasion or migration. The question has significant political, cultural, and historical impact, both in India and globally.



Much progress has occurred since 2006 on the question of the origin of the Indian civilization, and there is room for expanding the scholars who have been working in various fields addressing this question. One of the goals of the Center for Indic Studies has been to foster dialogue (or multilogue) on this and many Indic subjects.



More information on the registration and travel, etc, is available at <http://www.umassd.edu/indic/originsofcivilization/>. We will welcome interested people to join in the audience, and may be able to accommodate a couple of individuals on two proposed panels.



Please contact me for any queries.



Bal Ram
