Dear sir,  
  
Thank you for your effort.  
  
The date (3/7/1943) which we came to a conclusion is not a final one.  
  
Basing on 150 years panchanga which  
  
my sister is having today sent another date i.e 23 july 1944  
  
I think it may be between 1941 to 1945 .  
  
The marriage of my parents took place on 6th may 1962.  
  
At the time of marriage she was 19 years old  
  
My sister born in 1965 is now 45 years old.  
  
my mother says she born on ashada amavasya, magha nakshatra, second pada  
  
these are the some more inputs  
  
I request the scholars to help. I want to know the name of the samvatsaram, and date of birth.
