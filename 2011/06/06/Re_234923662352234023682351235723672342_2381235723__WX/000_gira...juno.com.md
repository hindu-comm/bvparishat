Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Goddess of English in Uttar Pradesh!



Congratulations to Manoj Kumar and Dr.Ram Karan Sharma for describing the present linguistic scene in India. Last year when I visited Andhra Pradesh I saw advertisements of elementary schools teaching English.One cannot deny the situation that English is overtaking even regional languages of India. Lovers of English in India are now building a temple to Goddess of English. This is happening in Banka village of Uttar Pradesh-the so called heart of Hindu civilization. This English goddess has hat on her head and not a Hindu crown. She has pen in one hand and book in another hand. She has English dress and not sari. She has lap top computer under her feet. Dalit samaaj of this village says our children will rise in Hindu society by learning English only so they do not have to do the lowest level jobs of high caste people. The slogan is "English Maiyya ki Jaya ho" (Glory to English mother). This news appeared in India-Herald with picture of English goddess of Banka village few months ago. Since I am Marathi, I have no problem with Hindi written in Devanagari. However I feel uncomfortable with Sanskritized Hindi. Language has to be like a flow of Sarasvati, not like a Dris'advati. I recommend people to see Pakistani dramas and listen to Urdu. There is flow, najakat,. It is hundred percent Indian language and one enjoys it more than Hindi seeded with unnecessary Sanskrit words like Evam, Prati, Tathaa, etc. In the same way nobody likes Arabized Urdu. Let language flow! This is what Bhaamah says in his KAvyaAlankAra--Saushabdyam ! Do not bring elephants in the river. Time to study linguistic psychology of ordinary people of India coming down from ivory tower of Sanskrit! Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

None else but we the people of Bharat ,that is India are to blame for this situation.Who compels our children to call Mummy ,Papa,Uncle Aunty?The boy or girlwants to be called educated only when he or she uses English words even for which traditional words are available in plenty.Does the govt compel everybody to display their names outside their homes in English?But everybody thinks that he and his family would be considered uneducated if they inscribe their names in Devanagari or any other Indian script.Most of the children of Delhi ,for example do not know what is Ravi vaara.They have to be told that Ravivara means Sunday.There is something wrong with our psychology.

 Officially speaking,thanks to Dr Rajedra Prasad,the then President of Constituent assembly,Sanskritbased Hindi is the official language of Bharat ,that is India.But have we allowed Hindi ,the defacto position of
an official language?We accepted several foreign languages as our official language.But even after 63-64 years of independence we have not been able to make up our mind .People have the habit of blaming the govt for everything.But specially in democracy we get the govt as we are.

Let us pray for a real incarnation of Indianness in all of us .

   Ram Karan Sharma

Namaste to all Scholars,  
  
Yesterday, in Kerala surya channel has showed a live video. in  
government school, students are not coming to study, all are  
interested to study private English medium school.. The headmistress  
has given her comment that she is helpless in this matter. Present  
time 1 st standard classes only 5-6 students are studying. maximum  
schools are closing now because of students strength.  
  
the question arise, why the Teachers working in govt.schools, Working  
under government departments are not allowing there children to study  
in govt.schools. why they are not showing the path to others by doing  
himself. Govt staff they are getting salary from government , they  
have to do it first. why they are not doing. This is not only in  
andrapradesh, you can see it any where. before questioning any body,  
the question has to ask our self. Now it is happening in Telugu,  
Malayalam or Sanskrit, but future you can see other languages too. we  
have to wait and see..Shame to say, in Kerala our mother tongue is  
elective.Present time half percentage students will not speak  
Malayalam . there are schools, if students speak Malayalam, students  
will get punishment.  
  
Thanking You  
Manoj Kumar
