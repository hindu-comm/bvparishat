Dears  
  
For a long time wanted to share with you a great success in the field of Sanskrit language. As you are great lovers of Sanskrit, I hope it will be delightful to know about the developments in the field of Sanskrit.  
  
When you are free please go through the attachments. There is a project called **Development of Sanskrit computational toolkit and Sanskrit-Hindi Machine Translation system** going on for last three years. There was an exhibition on **Sanskrit and Computers** on behalf of this project in World Sanskrit Book Fair in Jan. 2011.  
  
Though it was prepared in Jan. itself somehow I missed to send it to you. Sorry for the delay.

Give some Sanskrit sentences. When you get the output click on 1.1.L to see the **Knowladge Representation** of the sentences.  
  
Here are some example sentences -  
  
एकेन कपिना विशाले वृक्षे स्वीयेन हस्तेन एकं फलं खाद्यते.  
एकः कपिः विशाले वृक्षे स्वीयेन हस्तेन एकं फलं खादति.  
**रामः** वनं गच्छति. (Here rAmaH is noun)    
वयं धनं **रामः**.(Here rAmaH is verb) (System recognizes both of them correctly.)
