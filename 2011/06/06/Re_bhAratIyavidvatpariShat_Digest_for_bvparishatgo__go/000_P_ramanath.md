Arthashastra tradition is older than Kautilya but the earlier tradion  
was jus a concept on the subject . Ancient Indian tradition of the  
Arthashastra of Kautilya was quite different diplomatic tradition in  
systematized and descriptive form. Prior to Kautilya, the  
Artha-shastra focused mainly Dharmas and ethical code and conduct. It  
was not so diplomatic. But Katilya's Arthasastra is on rulership,  
economic policy and military strategy written in c. 350-283 B.C.. It  
has important role in forming the Mauryan empire.

\> \*ABSTRACT\*  
\>  
\>  
\>  
\> \* \*Following its birth in 1900, quantum physics has gone through  
\> three distinct phases. It began with the wave-particle duality identified  
\> with Einstein and Planck more or less ending in the formulation of the  
\> Bose-Einstein statistics and the beginning of particle physics. A parallel  
\> movement was the work of Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger and Dirac relating  
\> to  
\> the atom. This so-called 'new quantum theory' raised fundamental questions  
\> about reality and perception and even the meaning of a scientific theory,  
\> which was brought into focus by Einstein in his famous EPR experiment. This  
\> remained neglected for nearly 30 years until John Stuart Bell in 1964 put  
\> it  
\> in new light with the famous theorem that goes by his name.  
\>  
\> From the beginning scientists and philosophers have recognized that some of  
\> the same metaphysical issues had been studied by Vedantic philosophers like  
\> Shankara and Madhva; Schrödinger formulated his famous ‘cat’ experiment  
\> borrowing an idea from the \*Chandogya Upanishad\*. The talk will present a  
\> summary of the latest directions in quantum reality, especially with regard  
\> to the revived interest in Vedanta following the discovery of Bell's  
\> Theorem  
\> and its experimental validation by Alain Aspect and others.  
\>  
\> The presentation will be non-mathematical and accessible to interested lay  
\> persons including students.  
\>  
\>

\> Arthashastra tradition should be older than Kautilya (c 400BC). Vedic  
\> parishista and other texts refer to Arthshastra as upaveda of Rigveda  
\> or of Atharvanaveda. "Baarhaspatyam-arthashaastram" is mentioned by  
\> Bhasa (c 200 BC) in his Pratimanataka. This text (or some later  
\> version of it) has been published by Motilal Banarsidas in 1921 when  
\> they were still in Lahore. This was edited by Pt. Bhagavad Datta &  
\> F.W.Thomas.
