Respected Scholars,  
The monosyllabicity is one of the ideas of brevity with clarity. Lexical variations depend upon the versatile nature of primary and secondary derivations possible from roots etc. Difference in any lexicons cannot be the overlapping one among the other; but they are extensions to the conventional meanings well supported with possible and approved derivations. All vowels, consonants and conjunct-consonants can independently be separate words. The multiplicity of meaning is dependant on how you derive and justify with rules and popular usages. The monosyllables always useful to convey an extensive and elaborate idea through minimal applications. Grammarians use them for brevity with clarity. Poets use them for fun and pun. For understanding such poetry (monosyllabic poems) scholars depend grammar; and the lexicons of such selected search. The gender rules help to decide extensibility of usages, authenticity etc. Almost half of the Paninian roots are monosyllabic. Precisely, monosyllabic lexicons are special and concise of the executive lexicons.  



Regards,  
Narayanan
