Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Ekakshar Koshas and Mantra Shastra!



Thanks to Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty and to Dr. Narayan for explaining the use of Elakshara koshas  
I read all three Ekakshara Koshas posted on BVP.They differ from eachother considerably. I have no idea how could they be useful in Mantra shastra if it were a shastra. To the best of my knowledge so far no evidence is posted on BVP for validity of Mantra shastra. Discussions on Yajnya on BVP sometime ago is ended saying that it is complicated subject. Results described in the posting on BVP of recent Atiraatra Yajnya can be achieved (control of microbials, sprouting of seeds etc) by simple knowledge of modern chemistry and biology. I request Dr. Moharir to comment on this. If Mantras can control minute microbials, then I assume they can control big disease producing insects and animals. I do not see evidence of that. If Mantras have such power, then sages from Atharva Veda would have used Mantra to control Malaria fever, instead they say let Malaria fever (Takman) go in the direction of Vahlikas. Sobhari KaaNva praised Indra, Citra and Sarasvati (double role-river sometimes, goddess sometimes) when during a sacrifice in Kurukshetra rats began to harass him by snatching away his corn and various oblations.(From the book of O,P,Bharadvaja-Studies in the historical Geography of Ancient India-Chapter 20). This shows to me that Mantra Shastra was neither working at the time of Vedas nor at present.I have written this so that scholars can bring out positive evidence in favor of tangible results of Mantrashastra.If scholars here claim of creation of Apoorva (intangible)as a result of Yajnya with Vedic Mantras,then I have nothing to say about it.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
