*Resected scholars,*

*In this context I request students and scholars knowledgable in Computers and Devnagari script to develop Assembly language memonics based on Devenagri script, so that later software experts can further develop compilers based on modern Sanskrit, i.e. Tatsam words available in most Indian languages. *

*Such developments can help not only India but also the rest of the world which is now confined to only Roman script based memonics which actually limits the scope of natural language processing by the computers.*

*With regards,*

*Yours truly,*

*D D Misra  *
