\> Generation Y is finding new ways of reaching for its roots, reports  
\> Vishnupriya Bhandaram  
\>  
\> On weekends, Saarathi is found chilling out at a pub but on weekdays, she's  
\> busy learning Sanskrit. Why Sanskrit, one might ask? She says, “For fun.  
\> Sanskrit is probably one of the oldest languages; it's a work of art and  
\> should be propagated. It would be a shame to let it fade without even a  
\> yelp, like Hebrew!” Young guns these days are tuning into Sanskrit. And  
\> scoring marks in the exams doesn't seem to be the only incentive to opt for  
\> this language.  
\>  
\> Tattoo enthusiasts across the town are also sporting Sanskrit words. Joysen,  
\> a tattoo artist from the city, explains that the past two years have seen a  
\> growing number of people wanting to stamp a ‘bit of culture' onto  
\> themselves. He says that the next generation is resorting to chanting  

\> slokas, and their favourites hymns are the Gayatri \*mantra\* or  
\> Mahamrityunjaya \*mantra \*that express inner power. Vikram, also a tattoo

  
\> artist, says that some couples get tattooed with their partners' names in  

\> the \*Swastika\* font. There are certainly wannabes who are drawn to this
