All these prayojanas of it are in the sutras of Panini. While teaching we should explain all with examples without which our teaching becomes half only. Unfortunately except in a few places, our great grammarians also ignore them particularly the examples with accent. They think that it is only for the Veda. For details: one can consult: Yudhisthira Mimamsaka: Vaidika svara mimamsa ( may not be the exact title). Regards, spnarang
