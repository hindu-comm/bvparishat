I wonder such thing is still continuing with advanced technology too exploiting the people's religious belief. In my younger days, I had seen post cards sent to many such and such thing has happended to me as directed by some God or thirumala Venkata, and if you send it for 15 persons you will get such and such benefits and those who didn't comply with this request had met such and such fate etc.



Still people are there people who believe in such things and others trying the same game with advanced technology appropriated to their advantage if any.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/388779c723e3f3a3/338.gif?part=0.1)![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/388779c723e3f3a3/32B.gif?part=0.2)
