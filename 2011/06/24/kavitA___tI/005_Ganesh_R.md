VidushaaM vshamvadO'smi praNaamapurassagram nivEdayaami.  
The discussion is good and the words of Jagannath and Asok are wondeerful.  
  
We Indian students of poetics and aesthetics never had any problem with prose or verse as the medium of poetry...however, metre has a great bearing as a major feature in shabdaalamkaara-s and in the world of kaavya, chandas is a vibhuuti of its own right...  
Metre can very effectively create kaavya-bhrama in unpoetic passages too and this is a great virtue by it self. Howevr, it may as well be a great blemish o the part of poetry!!  
I remember that one type of geetaprabhanda meant for singing and dancing is termed as kavitaa (ref. Nartananirnaya of Pandareeka vitthala)
