Dear scholars,  
I am herewith attaching my recently published paper "Dhruva the  
ancient Indian pole star". I feel this evidence is importantfor all,  
main stream historians and indologists included, for understanding the  
antiquity of the Vedic People.Please note in the paper the  
diacritics are not clear in some places. Also U' has to be read as S'.  
So the word S'is'umara appears as U'iu'umara. This is the pdf version  
sent by IJHS! The print looks alright in the journal.

Your comments are welcome.

best..

RN Iyengar
