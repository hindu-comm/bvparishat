Respected Sir,  
agree with your views sir.. its our present psychology when ever we are unable to communicate in English we have no standard at all. We have the ability to speak and write in our own mother language, but in schools and colleges there is no permission at all. what we are facing is our own mistake, we have to accept it. Today day my office staff has given Rs.18500/- for LKG admission fee for her child. still he is saying my daughter has to study English medium school.  
we are not able to understand the value of our culture and we are not allowing our children to understand it. parents are so proud to say there children are studying English medium school. when ever we are not changing our attitude, it will never change. A govt staff or working person is not a matter, we are भारतीय. we have to think together, for a better nation.  
No need to blame each other.. we have to change our own home first..  
  
Thanking You  
  
With regards  
  
Krishnakumar
