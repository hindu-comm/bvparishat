Namaste to all Scholars,  
  
Yesterday, in Kerala surya channel has showed a live video. in  
government school, students are not coming to study, all are  
interested to study private English medium school.. The headmistress  
has given her comment that she is helpless in this matter. Present  
time 1 st standard classes only 5-6 students are studying. maximum  
schools are closing now because of students strength.  
  
the question arise, why the Teachers working in govt.schools, Working  
under government departments are not allowing there children to study  
in govt.schools. why they are not showing the path to others by doing  
himself. Govt staff they are getting salary from government , they  
have to do it first. why they are not doing. This is not only in  
andrapradesh, you can see it any where. before questioning any body,  
the question has to ask our self. Now it is happening in Telugu,  
Malayalam or Sanskrit, but future you can see other languages too. we  
have to wait and see..Shame to say, in Kerala our mother tongue is  
elective.Present time half percentage students will not speak  
Malayalam . there are schools, if students speak Malayalam, students  
will get punishment.  
  
Thanking You  
Manoj Kumar
