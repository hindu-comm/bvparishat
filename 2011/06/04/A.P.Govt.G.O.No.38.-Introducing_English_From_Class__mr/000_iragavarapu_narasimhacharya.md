Dear Scholar Friends,  
saadaraM praNamyA. I want to bring into the notice of the  
Educationists in India about the injustice being done to the mother  
tongue by the Government of  
Andhra Pradesh with a mania over the foreign language.Government of  
Andhra Pradesh issued a G.O.even to introduce English from the class 1  
level erasing  
the mother tongue from the curriculum.Several Education Commissions in  
India in the past stressed the need for mother tongue.In the policy of  
Education  
in our country Hindi occupies the first place.Mother tongue tongue is  
placed as second.The English is placed as third.Late Mahatma Gandhiji  
also was against  
this mania and the partisan attitude.  
I here-with furnish the details of the G.O. and the injustice done to  
the Mother tongue in the curriculum.Please ponder over this issue and  
do the needful.  
With Regards,
