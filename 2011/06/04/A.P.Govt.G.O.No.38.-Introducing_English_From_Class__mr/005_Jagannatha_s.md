Aaryaah, svasti.

This is my suggestion to language problem in the schools:

The medium of instruction shall be state language from 1^(st) standard to 4^(th) standard. Please don’t call any language \`\`regional’’ or \`\`local’’.

From 5^(th) standard, these languages shall be compulsory: The state language, Sanskrit, and English. If the language text books are attractive, children definitely learn three languages. They do have ability to grasp the languages very quickly.

There may be an objection. Government employees are transferred from one part of the country to another part frequently. What about the plight of their children? If an employee is in Tamilunadu, his child has to learn Tamilu. If he is transferred to Gujarat, his child has to learn Gujarati so on and so forth.

Solution: Transfer the employee who has no children,OR who has children studying in 5^(th) standard and above ORwhose transference is absolutely necessary.

Who is going to bell the cat ?

When we accept a language, knowingly or unknowingly, we welcome even the culture related to that particular language. The words Mummy and Daddy represent English culture to a small extent.
