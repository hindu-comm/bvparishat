None else but we the people of Bharat ,that is India are to blame for this situation.Who compels our children to call Mummy ,Papa,Uncle Aunty?The boy or girlwants to be called educated only when he or she uses English words even for which traditional words are available in plenty.Does the govt compel everybody to display their names outside their homes in English?But everybody thinks that he and his family would be considered uneducated if they inscribe their names in Devanagari or any other Indian script.Most of the children of Delhi ,for example do not know what is Ravi vaara.They have to be told that Ravivara means Sunday.There is something wrong with our psychology.

 Officially speaking,thanks to Dr Rajedra Prasad,the then President of Constituent assembly,Sanskritbased Hindi is the official language of Bharat ,that is India.But have we allowed Hindi ,the defacto position of
an official language?We accepted several foreign languages as our official language.But even after 63-64 years of independence we have not been able to make up our mind .People have the habit of blaming the govt for everything.But specially in democracy we get the govt as we are.

Let us pray for a real incarnation of Indianness in all of us .
