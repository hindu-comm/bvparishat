I greatly appreciate your views as I, along with many like-minded share similar views. But is it worth-while to pray for the realincarnation of "Indianness"? Would it not be worthwhile to pray for the re-incarnation of "Bharatiyata" instead? Wide acceptance of the former term instead of "Bharatiyata", is nothing but a clear indication of how corrupt our psychology has become! Our identity itself has been stolen!
