There appears to be a problem with the Chronology of the texts as mentioned in the Introduction:

History of Dharma Shastra, P.V.Kane, Vol.II, Part I places Grihya Sutras between 800 BC and 300 BC, earlier Puranas (Vayu, Vishnu, Markandeya, Kurma and Matsya)between 300 AD and 600AD. Ekagni Kanda which is a collection of Mantras from Krishna Yajur Veda is even later.
