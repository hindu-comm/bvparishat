Much of the chronological data for the Veda and Puranas is tentative. The only evidence is that of mention of a particular text: complete or incomplete in the others. The incomplete citations are scattered at a number of places whose concordance is not available. One has to use it very slowly and with other corroborative evidence. Kane also tried to do it. For controversial remarks: Ramgopal: India of the Vedic Kalpasutras and refuted by Kane: revised: Vol. I. The information available in the Puranas is equally collected on the basis of scattered material. sometimes there is no coherence in paada 1-4. A historian has to use the data very carefully that is generally ignored in the works of history of India except a few. Regards, spnarang
