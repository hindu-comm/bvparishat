Respected Scholars  
I came to know that Jayantika is a sanskrit text composed in 20th  
century following the story of Kadambari. Kadambari is great, no  
doubt.  
Since long, I was watching the e-vada-vivada through this bv parishat.  
Very interesting sometimes, and rich in new informations also.  
Many discussions were about difficult (jatila) points of Shastra  
topics, samskrta sambhasana, History of India, many higher research  
area of sanskrit grammar, computer and linguistics.  
I thought of taking care of sanskrit Kavya litereature. But what a  
quick response and discussion is received. This is possible only  
through bvparishat and the members who love discussing Sanskrit.  
Now it is worth thinking, that what a wonderful group has come. I  
thank here Mr. Nagaraj, Mr. Narayan and Dr. Rani Sadasiv Murty.  
Rakesh ji, I wanted to know about some text similar to Sukanasopadesa.  
This contains the advice of Old Minister Sukanasa to the would be  
Yuvaraja Chandrapida.  
This book was in the syllabus of many (sanskrit) graduation courses  
in India. Some places, now I find that it is removed. May be because  
of its long sentences and expressions.  
In Jan-Apr-2011 students of Senior diploma in sanskrit (1 year course)  
were taught this book here in EFLU.  
Again I thank all the members and founders of this group. Wish all  
participants success, good health and peace in life. ndash.
