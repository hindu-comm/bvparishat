Thanks, Dr. Amba Kulkarni for posting information of this book. Although modern students know names of Fibonacci Sequence and Pascal's Triangle, they do not know their origin with Pingala. Some information on Pascal's triangle also appears in the book (page 346), " A Comprehensive Grammar of Sanskrit Language" by Anundoram Barooah. Fibonacci (business man) was instrumental in popularising Hindu numerals in Europe. For him accounting became easy with Hindu numerals. N.R.Joshi.

It is published by LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing (2011-05-22)  
  
The abstract of the content is:  
  
"The book deals with the Methods of Bhāskara and Piṅgala, the focus being on their relevance today. The Proofs and Concepts are explained and compared with the Current Methods with reference to the following topics: The Application of Rules of Three and Five to similar triangles and Gas Equation PV=RT, pi as a Limit of an Infinite sequence, Radian Measure, Limit as a sum, Bhāskara's Algorithm for manipulating infinitesimals, Geometric proof of dsin(x) = cos(x)dx, Mean value Theorem, Use of Binomial Theorem to find the root of any order, Pythagoras Theorem by Euclid and Bhāskara, Newton's Fluxions and Bhāskara's Algorithm - a comparison, Some ingenious geometrical constructions, Heron's formula as a special case of that of Brahmagupta, Piṅgala's Combinatorial Mathematics, Binary System, Fibonacci Sequence and Pascal's Triangle as an off-shoot of Prosody, Approximations to sine and arcsine and Primitive ideas of Logarithm. The students, teachers, research scholars and lovers of mathematics are entitled to the traditional knowledge which will benefit them and inspire them to do research and produce monumental works.
