NOTHING SURPASSES MUSIC:  
'  
Japa koti gunam dhyanam;  
Dhyana koti guno laya;  
Laya koti gunam ganam;  
Ganath paratharam nahi. '  
(Meditation equals recitation of the Lord's name a crore times.  
Layam equals a crore dhyanam.  
Pure sublime music is equivalent to layam ten million times.  
But, lo, nothing can surpass the greatness of music.
