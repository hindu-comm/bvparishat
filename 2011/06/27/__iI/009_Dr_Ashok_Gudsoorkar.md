Dear Sri Suryaprakash,

Thank you very much indeed for providing such valuable information to the Sanskrit Community. It can be referred by many students and scholars. My regards to all your colleagues. I shall be grateful if you can provide me the email address of Dr Neelakantham.

  

Could you get the valuable books from Astronomy Dept., donated by Mrs Sailaja Abhyankar?
