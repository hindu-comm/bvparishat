1\. Rich Text Formats (RTF files)

Text files contain textual data and may be saved in plain text or rich text formats (RTF). While most text files are documents created and saved by users, they can also be used by software developers to store program data. Examples of text files include word processing documents, log files, and saved email messages.



2\. Text Formats Type(TFT files)

The TFT file type is primarily associated with 'Text Formatter Plus' by FormatBlue Software. An ASCII text formatting tool. The .TFT file contains RTF data and general information relating to a text file with the same name. The file is a mixture of RTF and XML.

3\. (XML)

**Extensible Markup Language** (**XML**) is a set of rules for encoding documents in [machine-readable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable "Machine-readable") form. It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification^([\[4\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#cite_note-3)) produced by the [W3C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C "W3C"), and several other related specifications, all [gratis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis "Gratis") [open standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard "Open standard").^([\[5\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#cite_note-4))

The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").^([\[6\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#cite_note-XML_Goals-5)) It is a textual data format with strong support via [Unicode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") for the languages of the world. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary [data structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structures "Data structures"), for example in [web services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service "Web service").
