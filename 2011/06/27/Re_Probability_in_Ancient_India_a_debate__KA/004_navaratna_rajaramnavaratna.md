 Thank you Dr Vepa, I'll use some of this in an article on historiography where I argue for science to replace ideology. Thank you also for reminding me of Hegel's metaphor-- India as a cul de sac. I have seen the same phrase used by AIT people that people always came to India and never traveled out of it. The truth is the opposite of it. India being always densely populated more people left than came in as is the case today. This was so during the colonial period also-- with soldiers, traders, clerksand indentured laborers going out (or taken out) of India. The same was true even during the Islamic period due to the slave trade.
