Respected Professor RN Iyengar ji,  

  

We are really happy over the news ! Congratulations to all of you who are the force behind it !!

  

I believe, new areas are bound to emerge as a result of working on manuscripts in the form of publication of text-critical editions which features as one of its many activities. Hope is high since the Centre promises to breathe fresh air into Indic studies through its well-thought-out activities which need to be appreciated. Personally I deeply appreciate its promise for interacting with ''historians, epigraphists, archaeologists, mathematicians  
and scientists in such a way that “Sanskrit study” does not get isolated from related disciplines.'' This should be the true spirit of looking into ancient history and culture.

  

It is indeed "Centre for Ancient Indian History & Culture” .

  

Best regards,

  

Soma Basu
