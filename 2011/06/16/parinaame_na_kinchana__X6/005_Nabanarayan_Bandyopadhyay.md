Dear Shri Jagannatha,

  

AjAyuddha and Rishishraddha are futile to some extent in the sense that fighting among goats are like sports and ritual performances by Rishis are full of sacrificial materials, mantras, utensils, priests, etc. but the result is puNya or apurva which is not actually visible. KriyA is kArya or phala i.e. outcome/result in the end etc.
