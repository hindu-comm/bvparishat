Hello Mr. Iyengar,

Assuming the pole star is 'Dhruva', how that discovery can be made by the ancestors? Does it mean they conducted experiments by travelling to up north? If they did, are there any references about the journey in the scriptures? Any indications? Any mentioning about the arctic?

  

Thanks
