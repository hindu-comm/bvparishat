One does not go to the north pole of the earth to see the pole star.  
You can see the present pole star (alpha-U-minor)from your town,  
assuming you are in the northern hemisphere. You have to look up in  
the night and watch the sky in the northern direction for several  
hours to note that one among the stars does not move, where as the  
near by ones move around it.

I feel this evidence is importantfor all,main stream historians andindologistsincluded, for understanding theantiquity of theVedicPeople.Please note in the paper thediacritics are not clear in some places. Also U' has to be read as S'.So the wordS'is'umaraappears asU'iu'umara. This is thepdfversionsent byIJHS! The print looks alright in the journal.Your comments are welcome.best..RNIyengar--अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
