Rgveda 7.95.2 and Karen Thomson, or deliberate and learned ignorance: N. Kazanas' rejoinder (May 2011)

  

Link: December 2010 issue of the Journal of Indo-European Studies (vol 38, nos 3 and 4) which contained Kazanas' critique of Ms. Thomson's article 'A still undeciphered text' (JIES, 2009).

  

Kazanas' response concludes: "Here I take my leave of Karen Thomson for good. Much else could be said but enough is enough. One cannot hold a useful dialogue with so dishonestt an interlocutor. But one hopes that she will continue, with less arrogance, grumbling and criticism, her good work in re-examining ambiguous words and phrases in the RV and will not shy away from giving better interpretations."
