 Thank you. I look forward to your book on kinematics. Also, even thought the Kerala school was ahead of Europe in mathematics and astronomy, they did not not make the leap to theinverse square law that Newton did. Of course Newton had Kepler to build on, who in turn had Tycho Brahe's data even before the telescope was invented. So the lack of the telescope was not the handicap.



Perhaps India did not develop a tradition of systematic data collection represented by Tycho without which Kepler's work would have been impossible. Even today, India is weak in experimental sciences as I know from personal experience.



 These issues should be discussed and debated in public. We need a workshop also on the experimental tradition in Indian science.



 By the way I am at UMass for the summer. Where ar you based? I have given several talks on these subjects. We need to set up an entity where these issues are discussed. How about the Center for Indic Studies at UMass, Dartmouth? If we can find some sponsors for an annual workshop we can make good progress.



 We know a great deal about Indian mathematics, but very little about its experimental tradition. It is an important area.



Sincere regards,

N.S. Rajaram
