This being a scholarly forum, I do not know how popular TED is amongst the members, but here's a very well crafted talk on the efforts till date to decipher the Indus Script: <http://www.ted.com/talks/rajesh_rao_computing_a_rosetta_stone_for_the_indus_script.html?utm_source=newsletter_weekly_2011-06-29&utm_campaign=newsletter_weekly&utm_medium=email>



Note of caution to those who are new to TED: TED talks tend to consume a lot of bandwidth and typically last just under twenty minutes.If you find the accent difficult to follow, you might want to switch on the sub-titles.



Disclaimer: I am not associated with TED in any way except as a consumer, that is I enjoy many of the TED talks.
