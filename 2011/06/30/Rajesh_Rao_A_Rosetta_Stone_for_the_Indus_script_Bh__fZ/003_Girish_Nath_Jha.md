The presentation by Mr Rao is good entertainment.

He should understand that the excercise he has undertaken is a serious  
one - probably much more than solving a crossword puzzle. And therefore  
he may consider obtaining latest data and research in the area to get a  
comprehensive understanding of the issues involved. In this context, I  
would like to recommend a recent publication titled "Origin of Indian  
Civilization" (DK Printword 2010) edited by Bal Ram Singh.

I am wondering what made Mr Rao cite Parpola whose expertise on Indian  
languages is questionable when he traces the word 'meen' to Tamil. I am  
sure all in this group would agree that 'meen' has a Sanskrit origin. I  
think it is high time intrepretation of India is done little more  
sensibly than what it has been done so far.
