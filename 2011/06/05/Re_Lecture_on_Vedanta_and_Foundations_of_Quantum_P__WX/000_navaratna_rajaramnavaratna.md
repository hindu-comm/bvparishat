***ABSTRACT***



**  **Following its birth in 1900, quantum physics has gone through three distinct phases. It began with the wave-particle duality identified with Einstein and Planck more or less ending in the formulation of the Bose-Einstein statistics and the beginning of particle physics. A parallel movement was the work of Bohr, Heisenberg,Schrödinger and Dirac relating to the atom. This so-called 'new quantum theory' raised fundamental questions about reality and perception and even the meaning of a scientific theory, which was brought into focus by Einstein in his famous EPR experiment. This remained neglected for nearly 30 years until John Stuart Bell in 1964 put it in new light with the famous theorem that goes by his name.

From the beginning scientists and philosophers have recognized that someof the same metaphysical issues had been studied by Vedantic philosophers like Shankara and Madhva; Schrödinger formulated his famous ‘cat’ experiment borrowing an idea from the *Chandogya Upanishad*. The talk will present a summary of the latest directions in quantum reality, especially with regard to the revived interest in Vedanta following the discovery of Bell's Theorem and its experimental validation by Alain Aspect and others.

The presentation will be non-mathematical and accessible to interested lay persons including students.



N.S. Rajaram is a mathematical scientist and historian of science who teaches history and philosophy of science at the Center for Indic Studies, University of Massachusetts. He also lectures at several universities in the U.S. and U.K. including MIT, U of Manchester, London, Oxford and others. His book *Quantum Yoga and the Meaning of Reality: Can Physics and Vedanta meet* will be published in 2012.
