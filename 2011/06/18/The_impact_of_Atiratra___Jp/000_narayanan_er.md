Respected scholars,  
Namaskaarah. There are media reports on the impact of Yajnas, Yagas on the  
environment. An atirAtra was held in April 2011. There are claims by scientists  
that the Athirathram had impact on germination of seeds, as reported by the  
Hindu,KOCHI, June 9, 2011.

They also claim that the temperature of the flame from the Pravagya was  
estimated to be 3,870 degree centigrade, according to a scientist from the  
Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. The fire ball that rose from the  
Pravagya had unusually high intensity and a particular wavelength that is  
similar to what is observed in typical laser beams of the same degree.

What is Pravagya? and how it could be estimated to be 3,870 degree centigrade?  
And, "according to a scientist from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics,  
Bangalore"?

The Newspaper also claims the impact of the Athirathram ritual on the  
atmosphere, soil, micro-organisms and other potential environmental effects.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
