Hello, Dr Subrahmanyam!

Congratulations and thank you for the completing the Sloka. May I know from which scripture it is quoted and in what context.

  

I have written a separate note to you. I am aware, you are very much tied up in the schedule of your work; still, I will be very happy if you can spare a few mts and write to me on the items mentioned by me therein. Regards.

  

--Dr Ashok Gudsoorkar, Wales
