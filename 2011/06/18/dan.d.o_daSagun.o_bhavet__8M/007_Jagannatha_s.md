Respected Ashok Gudsoorkar,



Meaning is clear. The use of a stick is very effective in regarding-



1\. ViSvAmitra-(During the conflict situation in between Vasis.t.ha and ViSvAmitra- it is Brahmadan.d.a)

2\. *ahi*-Serpent.(One can threaten a serpent by hitting earth using a stick)

3.*paSu*- beast. (or *him.sra*-living being of violent nature)

4.*salila*- In crossing a pond, holding a stick is very helpful.

4.*kardama*-mud

5.*jad.a*-fool

6.*andha*-a blind person takes the help of a stick while moving.

7.*tamas*-darkness

8.*vArdhakya*-old age.



*dan.d.a* is used in both m.and n. So both *dan.d.ah.*and *[dan.d.am](http://dan.d.am)* are correct.



But I do not know the work where this verse occurs.
