Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



BhadragaNa and Hastinapura (PART II)



In the part I we discussed MarutgaNa, Avagana and Paaravatagana. Now let us discuss ancient Bhadragana people. The modern land of Baluchistan was called Gadrosia of the time of Alexander of Macedonia. Long before, it was known as the country of BhadragaNa kshatriyas. These people used to talk loudly (Bhadra vaak-may be due to roaring winds). Bhadra vaak is to be understood in context of Namra vaak. The town of Bhadravati was capital of Yuvanashva. BhadragaNa kshatriyas of Bhadradesha (Baluchistan) contributed to the Raajasooya Yajnya of Yudhistira. The Indian Padma Purana places Bhadravati on the bank of Sarasvati In the chapter six of Indian Jaimini-Bharata Bhadravati is said to be 20 Yojanas distant from Hastinapura. If we assume one Yojana equals 8.6 miles, then Hastinapura could be 172 miles from the country of Baluchistan. Now distance between Delhi and Quetta of Baluchistan is about 875 miles. Where was then located the ancient Mahabharata city Hastinapura? If Hastinapura was seat of powerful ancient Kurus, then did anybody outside the subcontinent know about the city? Yes, ancient Persians knew Kabul by the name Ortospana. We also knew that Kuru-Kambojas were present from ancient Iran to Afghanistan to Sindhudesh. Gaandhaara was also in the north spread on the border land of modern Afghanistan and Pakistan. Two Rigvedic seer names KaaNva Goura and Ghora Angirasa were associated with the ancient Ghor province of Afghanistan. Ancient Afghanistan was full of natural resources-billon tons of iron ore, coal mines, precious stones, gold, and uranium mines. Did ancient Kurus occupy strategic location so that they can control pan-asian empire? If you have information different from this , please share with us so we can expand horizon of our knowledge. The epic offers the boundaries of Mahabharata empire. That is next. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
