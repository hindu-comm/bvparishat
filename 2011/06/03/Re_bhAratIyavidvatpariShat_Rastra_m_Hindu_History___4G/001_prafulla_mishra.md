Dear Scholars,

let us condemn the barbarious acivities of Government of India on the innocent people in guru Ramdev's scamin the dead of the night. Such inhuman aciviies warrants dismissal of the prime Minister and go for a fresh mandate. The Congress party should be banned from this country who is against people's demand on corrupion and black money.



P.K
