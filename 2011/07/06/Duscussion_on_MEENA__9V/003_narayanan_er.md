Respected Scholars,  
It may appear to be true that everything in the world could not be explained through the exercise of grammar as far as any language is concerned. But at the same time if want to explore the unexplored area of fundamental or extended meaning, the meaning you perceive or convey you have make sure that such form of sound is uttered with a view to representing certain meaning for interpretation. The form of any sound is its silent terminological representative, which is being heard meaningfully. To explore the extensiveness of meanings you may use some sort of tool; it is up to you whether people use old grammar, new grammar, old logic or new logic etc. Why people depend any grammar ? People do ask : How many meanings this sound can have ? What is the etymology of this sound? Why this particular sound is used on certain particular contexts? Why one terminology is different from the other while that is heard similarly? Why people search for roots and affixes in grammatical structure irrespective of old or new? On what ground the lexicons recommend and restrict the meanings of sounds? Why the cognates keep uniformity in some elements of forms of sounds exemplified? And to justify some extensive meanings why people quote from old grammatically sound usages like : chandramaa manaso jaatah; mano vai chandramaah etc. where the visarga eliding rule for the chandramas, and manas as mano etc. are followed, and which could have been quoted without the application any old grammar rule ? If everything about sounds and meanings could be explained and explored by sidelining old grammatical exercise, then, Sirs, best of luck for any exploration. Remember ! the Vedas are too old, is a bunch of old exercises !! One is, therefore, requested to direct us to substitute the old grammatical exercise. Thanks.

Narayanan
