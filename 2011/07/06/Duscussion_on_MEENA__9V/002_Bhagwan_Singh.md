Respected scholars,

I hope I do not disturb you. But everything can not be explained by PaNiniyan rules and old grammatical exercises. In my study of vocables I find **mn, man, manas, miin, moon, maas masi** and even **man** and **Manu** as cognates. The first two words mean water, with extended meanings-(1)to shine, (2)to be brilliant, (3)that which shines, (4) thinking being and (5) that which illuminates (roshnaaii), (6)a lunar cycle, etc.and such staments as 'chandramaa manaso jatah; mano vai chandramaa. I have elaborately discussed this aspects in my articles published in Hindi. It is here that you find know why the term means fish, constellation and all the rest.Schalars prove that they know what is written, I just appeal that we must explore the unexplored areas as well.``

with regards

Bhagwan Singh

The term मीनः is in masculine gender from the root मीञ् हिंसायाम् with a suffix नक् supported by the Unadi rule 3.3 फेनमीनौ, and the derivation will be मीयते हिंस्यते इति मीनः। Amarasimha gives a lexical support to this as मत्स्यः (1-10-17). Why it is in masculine gender ? The Panini Linganushasana says : नोपधः, the syllable न् as the penultimate one to the अ ending like इनः, फेनः etc.

Narayanan

Respected scholars,

I was following the ongoing discussions on Indus Decifer . Shri Narayan had posted interesting informations in derivation if two word Meena and Matsya. Unfortunately because of some malfunction of my system I have lost those data. I request if anybody kindly send the above posting again and oblige me.

Pranam and Thanks to the scholars.
