Respected scholars,

I was following the ongoing discussions on Indus Decifer . Shri Narayan had posted interesting informations in derivation if two word Meena and Matsya. Unfortunately because of some malfunction of my system I have lost those data. I request if anybody kindly send the above posting again and oblige me.

Pranam and Thanks to the scholars.
