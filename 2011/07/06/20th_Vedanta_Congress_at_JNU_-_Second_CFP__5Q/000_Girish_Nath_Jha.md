The first CFP which ended on 30th June resulted in a large number of registrations and paper submissions. This has encouraged us to extend the deadline for paper submission till July25. If you have already submitted, there is enough time to update your paper before it is opened to reviewers. New papers in Sanskrit, Hindi or English can also be uploaded as per following instructions -

1\) please check the new dates at <http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/20vedanta/cfp.htm>  
2) full papers (5000 words approx) can be written in Hindi, Sanskrit or English. Please follow the instructions given at <http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/20vedanta/paperformat.html>  
3) pls make sure that the name of the file does not have spaces  
4) if you are using Devanagari non-unicode fonts, then convert the file into a pdf and then upload it  
5) in case you need help, please contact Diwakar Mishra (my Ph.D. student) at [diwaka...@gmail.com]() or by calling 09899780161
