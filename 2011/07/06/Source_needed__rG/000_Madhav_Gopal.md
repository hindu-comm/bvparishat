Namaste to All the Scholars,  
  
I want to know the source of the following kaarikaa:  
  
संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः।  
नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपक्षते॥  
  
and also of the often quoted rule:  
  
"अज्झीनं परेण संयोज्यम्।"  
  
I am interested in knowing who originally created these lines. Please give me the complete reference. I shall be thankful to you.  
  
With best regards,  
Madhav
