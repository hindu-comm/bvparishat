Subject: Searching for an article on Nyayasudha  
To: [veer...@gmail.com]()

Acharyaji,

I am searching for an article tiltled "My Studies in Nyayasudha" by  
the great scholar Dr. R Nagaraja Sharma for a long time now. I have  
not been sucessfula as yet. Have you come accross this article which I  
am given understand is about 150 pages published in 1930's in one the  
yearly souvniers of "University of Brindavan". One of my contacts in  
Bangalore claims to have it but he is reluctant to share it. Could you  
please help loacte this for the present day generation.

I also understand that there are 2 more articles written on  
"Vaishnavism" by Dr. RNS but theses again are not available.

I have seen Karl H Potter mention all these articles of Dr. RNS in his  
collection. I had a corresspondence with him on this and he came back  
saying that he had collected it some 50 years ago and given it to some  
library back in USA. He couldn't help me beyond this. Could you please  
arrange to locate this through your network. please...

Thanks / B Raghavendra

Thanks and regards,
