### The kAlAtman maNDala at Angkor Wat « mAnasa-taraMgiNI

[The kAlAtman maNDala at Angkor Wat « mAnasa-taraMgiNI](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/02/08/the-kalatman-mandala-at-angkor-wat/)  
  
The kAlAtman maNDala at Angkor Wat  
  

[![](https://bp0.blogger.com/_hjuA1bE0hBw/R65rFKfEbEI/AAAAAAAAACU/15bQeMsDM24/s320/kAlayAga.png)](http://bp0.blogger.com/_hjuA1bE0hBw/R65rFKfEbEI/AAAAAAAAACU/15bQeMsDM24/s320/kAlayAga.png)

  
The basic geometry of the kAlAtmaka yantra  
  
The inscription records of Angkor Wat by the French archaeologists points to a rare tantric prayoga of the siddhAnta srotas, whose performance appears to barely survive today in the drAviDA country (perhaps until relatively recently in Nepal). The inscription in question is from the period of the 1300s apparently from the period of the reign of indrajayavarman. The relevant statement from the inscription is:  
  
“tasmin kuru mahad yAgaM yathoktaM pArameshvare … kR^itvAn sa mahad yAgaM kAla-yAgaM iti shrutaM \| sarasvatI yAga yutaM loka-pAla-samAvR^itaM \|\|”  
  
It describes a great yAga which has been laid down in the siddhAnta tantra known as the pArameshvara Agama. This great yAga is known as kAla-yAgaM. In its performance the mantra-vAdin is supposed to include the yAgA of sarasvatI and surround it by that of the loka-pAla-s. So what is this rite being described by the Angkor Wat inscription? An examination of the ritual prayoga-s of the Chidambaram dIkShita-s reveals that it refers to the prayoga of the exalted vyomavyApin mantra. This mantra as per the kAmikAgama is used in the final step of the dIkSha into the siddhAnta srotas along with the mAtR^ikA mantra-s signifying the circle of sarasvatI before it. However, the ritual in question here is the one laid out by the 9th paTala of the guhya section of the archaic nishvAsa tantra. It is also found in the now partially lost pArameshvara tantra, confirming the statement in the Angkor inscription. It is also alluded to in the svAyambhuva sUtra-s as the form of mahAdeva as kAlAtmA (the version edited by Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat may not contain the original reading) commented upon by the great AchArya sadyojyotis. The nishvAsa guhya described the yAga as the worship of shiva as “saMvatsara-sharIriNaH” or with his body as the year. The rite was connected with the construction of the kAlAtman maNDala, which is being implied implicitly by the word yAga in the Angkor inscription (the yAga being the fire rite accompanying the installation and worship of the maNDala). The basic geometry of the mandalA has a dodecagonal plan with 12 spokes leading to the outer rim with petals (circles). On each of these 12 spokes and petals 30 akShara-s of the vyomavyApin mantra were laid out (=360). The remaining 8 akShara of the vyomavyApin were laid on the inner octagonal nave. This was surrounded by a decagonal rim on which were laid, 5 per side, the 50 mAtR^ika-s composing the akShara-svarUpa of sarasvatI (this is clearly mentioned in the pArameshvara). Outside of it the 8 direction was a bhUpura with loka-pAla stationed therein starting with indra. The yAga of mahAdeva in the form of the kAlAtmA (embodied in this maNDala) involved the ritual to the central shiva with the vyomavyApin mantra arranged as a manifestation of the year, to sarasvati in the surrounding mAtR^ika chakra and to the loka-pAla-s in their AvaraNa.  
  
This construction of the maNDala is different from the navanAbha maNDala also constructed based on the vyovyApin mantra. The latter is described by the great Kashmirian tantric bhaTTa rAMakaNTha deshika (rAmakaNTha-II) in his composition known as the vyomavyApin stava. The medieval brAhmaNa vedaj\~na (commenting on rAmakaNTha, and following trilochana-shiva) from TiruvATuturai in the Tamil country states that this yantra was first promulgated by the bhArgava R^iShi ruru (Hence, his collection form the tantra of the Urdhva srotas known as raurava) and the vyomavyApin mantra is supposed to have emerged from the IshAna face of shiva. The features of the navanAbha yantra are derived based on the kalottara and mata\~Ngaparameshavara texts. This maNDala has a nonagonal symmetry with 40 akShara-s in each of the 9 sectors and 8 arranged in a central nave. The kAlAtman envisages shiva as encompassing time and the navanAbha envisages the deva as encompassing space.  
  
These conceptions of shiva express a continuity with the vedic tradition where rudra is invoked at the end of the piling of the altar in the agnichayana. In the yajur vedic rite rudra is invoked as encompassing space as the 4 cardinal directions and the vertical axis and time in the form of the 5 saMvatsara-s of the vedic 5 year cycle. Amongst these rudra is said to stand like a fierce tiger. Likewise, the mention of the kAla maNDala in the Cambodian inscription, which arranges the vyomavyApin to correspond to the 12\*30 day months of the saMvatsara, reminds one of the astronomical constants embedded in the main temple of Angkor Wat. For example, the outline of the base-plan of the upper elevation of the temple has 12 projections and the sum of the lengths of the N-S and E-W axes is 365.37 Cambodian cubits (described in Eleanor Mannikka’s work). While, the main temple of Angkor Wat is one dedicated to viShNu, the basic ideas of maNDala geometry inhere to both siddhAnta and pA\~ncharAtra temple constructions. After all the mantra and the yantra are the deity.

The Indian Ocean community can, like the EU, transform itself into a free trade zone, and can even work towards adopting a common currency. The 59 countries in the region constitute a $6 trillion powerhouse.  
  
Caught in the stranglehold of concepts and models emanating from the West, the opinion leaders, strategic thinkers and policy makers of Asian countries have long shied away from examining boldly and with a fresh mind the new and exciting vistas of social, cultural and economic partnership that exists right at their doorstep. For instance, I have hardly found any discussion or even awareness among scholars of the Asian region of the invincible dynamics of one such compelling vision that has immense potential for the betterment of all humankind.  
  
The thought occurred to me as I was talking to Dr.S.Kalyanaraman who had held leadership positions in the Asian Development Bank, and been engaging himself in giving a new thrust, suited to the genius of Asian region, to new paradigms of collaboration and synergy which would put them on the fast track, if not ahead of so-called advanced countries.  
  
By a process of ratiocination, he is convinced that the combined strengths of 59 countries of the Indian Ocean Rim which together constitute a six trillion dollar powerhouse are capable of setting in motion hitherto undreamt of enterprises for making the most of their abundant human and natural resources in order to achieve unprecedented economic growth and full employment, thereby make prosperity for all a reality.  
  
Phenomenal role  
  
Dr.Kalyanaraman has elaborated the strategic calculus in his book bearing the unusual title Rastram which is not amenable to any precise translation. Its attributes transcend those of a state ((which is mainly composed of institutions of governance) or a nation (which is a conglomerate of people with self-identity living in harmony). In his view, if only the countries of the Indian Ocean Rim constitute themselves into a collective entity, the tremendous financial and economic leverage that it will exercise will make it play a phenomenal role which will redress the balance of the present, largely skewed, world economic order.  
  
The idea has great appeal as well as relevance. The Indian Ocean Community (IOC), as expounded in Dr.Kalyanaraman’s book, is predicated on the same rationale as the supra-national European Community which was initially conceived as a mechanism for joint policy making with reference to production and marketing of coal and steel but got expanded to full-fledged and integrated economic organisation with Euro as a common currency and a European Central Bank as a provider of banking services based on homogenous norms and criteria to all the members. This happened as an economic imperative despite the two world wars fought among the European nations.  
  
Doable proposition  
  
Similarly, the IOC too can transform itself into a Free Trade Zone, to start with, to provide for free movement of goods and services which, at some later stage, can even work towards adopting a common currency. It is true that it will stretch from South Africa to Tasmania along the 63,000 kms of the Indian Ocean Rim, but this need not in itself be regarded as an argument against it.  
  
There are actually three predisposing factors that make the IOC a doable proposition: The two proposed projects for the construction of a Trans-Asian Highway and Trans-Asian Railway from Bangkok to Vladivostok and the extension of the territorial waters of the Indian Ocean Rim states to 200 nautical miles under the amended Law of the Sea opens up unlimited economic opportunities for mutual cooperation and harnessing the riches of the ocean.  
  
Dr.Kalyanaraman’s thesis is leavened by the fact that the IOC has a thousand years of socio-cultural interaction and bonds. This has found authentic expression in the lucid and impressive account of the late French epigraphist George Coedes (who also wrote about the largest Vishnu temple of the world in Angkor Wat, Cambodia and other Hindu temples of the Farther Orient)  
  
First example  
  
The words États hindouisés in the title of his work,Histoire ancienne des États hindouisés d'Extrême Orient, (translated into English by Hawaii University Press as Indianised States of Southeast Asia) essentially signifies a dharma-dhamma continuum evidenced by thousands of Hindu-Buddha temples in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Burma and other states and the historical presence of Hindu kings in the region for over one millennium.  
  
The IOC will be the first example of weaving the cultural bonds into socio-economic spheres of cooperation. It can be further buttressed by exchanges in the fields of higher technical education, use of satellite and IT technologies, oceanography and so on.  
  
A beginning has already been made by the setting up of Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation as a forum for the diplomats of the states of the region to meet annually to exchange views and ideas in the common interest of the IOC. Talks are also under way on the best means of giving economic content through Free Trade agreements and MOUs for bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation in infrastructure projects such as the development of the deltas of the Mekong and Irrawady Rivers.  
  
This need not be seen as a competition or one-upmanship in realpolitik between India and China.. They, together with USA and other developed countries, can participate in a common enterprise of promoting economic development in the region which is struggling hard to catch up with demands for goods and services generated by exploding populations. A region which accounted for about 80 per cent of the world GDP just three centuries ago will thus find its rightful place in the comity of nations.  
  
Revolutionary change  
  
Since most of the social and cultural influences have had their origins in South India, it should not be surprising if the policy makers at the Centre in New Delhi take only minimal interest in the initiative advocated here. It will be well worthwhile for the academic community and persons prominent in public and political life in Southern States to go in depth into the significance of the proposition. For instance, if the Chief Minister, Ms.Jayalalithaa, can persuade herself about its feasibility and brings herself to draw the Centre’s attention, she would have set India on a course that would bring about a revolutionary change in the complexion of world affairs.
