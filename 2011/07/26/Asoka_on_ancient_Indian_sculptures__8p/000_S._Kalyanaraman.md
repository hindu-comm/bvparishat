[First ever discovered labelled portraiture of king Asoka and his queen](http://web.archive.org/web/20051205040723im_/http://asi.nic.in/images/maha_5.jpg)[Source.](http://web.archive.org/web/20051205041242/http://asi.nic.in/album_kanganhalli4.html)  
  
  
In the autumn of 1993, a team of acheologists was surveying the area around sannati in the chitapur taluk of Gulbarga district. A dam was to be built across the river Bhima near this place, and the survey was necessary for the mandatory environment clearance, several sites were discovered in the course of the survey, but the most dramatic evidence came from kanaganahalli. This site is situated on the left bank of the Bhima river , 2km east of chandralamba temple at sannati, Here some irregular stones arranged in arc in the midst of agricultural fields attracted the attention of the archeologists. Trial excavations in 1994-95 under the direction of K.P. Poonacha revealed one eighth of a large brick stupa encased with sculpted limestone slabs , carved limestone slabs, pillars, railings, capitals, and sculptures were unearthed. Over 60 lead coins bearing the names of satavahana kings, and 200 donative and label inscriptions were identified. The remains of the kanaganahalli stupa is also known as mahachaitya.  
  
  
The discoveries a the site included a broken relief sculpture showing a king and queen flanked by female attendents two of whom held up a parasol and fly whisk – symbols of sovereignty – in their hands. An Inscription in Brahmi read “Ranyo Ashoka” (King Ashoka) leaving no doubt who the central figure was supposed to represent.  
  
Many years earlier a relief panel at the central indian site of sanchi has been identified as representation of the same king, but there no inscription to confirm the identification. Later after kanaganahalli was found same sculpture with same inscription was found in orissa also, confirming the identity of the person in sculpure to be Ashoka. Kanaganahalli provided  
India.  
  
Trial excavations at kanaganahalli were followed by more systematic ones in 1996-97. The report of these excavations contains a wealth of important material illustrating the history of Buddhism in Karnataka especially upper krishna valley.

I am unable to locate the statue said to represent Asoka in the sculptures of Sanchi stupa and related monuments.

  
The Kanaganahalli statue of Asoka Raya may be compared with the portrayal of a king on Sanchi torana panels:
