Bhamathi ( from Sri. Adi Shankaracharaya's work )- is the name chosen by a college in Sringeri, Karnataka. And this name has very rich in its meaning and most of the Sanskrit Scholars are well aware  
about the story behind Bhamathi as well.  
  
Editorial says: Vachaspathi, husband of Bhamati,  Bhamathi lead vachaspathi to attain his knowlege. In the same way,  
Bhamathi should lead us to attain the supreme knowledge. and also says... Bha + Mathi..... meaning .....  
  
  
We prefer to choose the names from Sanskrit in the similar context ( as said above) . Because, Sanskrit has rich vocabulary and good semantic build language.  
If you have taken names from the Sanskrit please provide Short Story or few lines why the particular name has been chosen ?  
  
Please, Do send your Suggestions/Advice to either : **Satisha MV ( [lis4s...@gmail.com]())** OR **Dr. Mahesh Kakathkar ( [mahesh.k...@gmail.com]())** at the earliest.  
It would be of great help and opportunity to provide best information from your knowledge base.  
  
Your Help and Suggestions will be highly appreciated.
