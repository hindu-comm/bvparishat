There is no ref. to a soma fruit or flower in RV. The term and also its synonyms 'indu', 'chandra', 'andhas'connote and denote water,with semantic extension to juicewith defined attributes. The symolisms attached emanate from the very discriptions. Some in sky= moon, on earth a plant, symbolising all the plants, the water symolising primordial water from which the cosmos if formed, and again it is spiritual as well, as there is one soma known to the wisest men which is not tasted by any one - yat somam brahmaNaa vid.h na tam asnati kascan. As a juice it could be made more tasty by adding curd, milk, or even ghee. The juice was sweetest of all sweets andhas been often compared with honey. Taking all the accounts the plant proves to be none else but sugarcane, which was once available as wild growth like reeds and its family is described to that ot reed - munjnejan- . Lauding the plant they invented a story that it came right from the moon. In fact meter gayatri taking the from of an eagle flew to sky and stole it from sky and brought it to earth. Such descriptions elude the wisest interpresters. That gives rise to so many brainwork with attendant theories.
