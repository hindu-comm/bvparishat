Respected Dr. Joshi,

Vedic symbolism has always been a source of controversy among scholars. Although I am not a vedic scholar, I had to read a paper ' Ashvinau: A yogic interpretation" in a vedic conference at the request of my friend, who organized the seminar and is a renowned vedic scholar. I took the aadhyaatmika meaning of ashvinau in this paper and co related this vedic deity with prana and apana. In this context, I consulted many Brahmana- granthas, vedic koshas and nirukta of Yaska. I foundthe aadhyaatmika interpretation of Ashvinau in the Brahmana-granthas.I felt justified in my attempt.I feel the interested vedic scholars can take the help of Brahmana-granthas to understand vedic symbollism Ina better way.
