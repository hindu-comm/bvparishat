Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Vaidika Symbolism-which one correct and to what extent?



Many scholars attach different symbolic meanings to words (or deities) from Vedas. One one would say Soma indicates ocean symbolism while other says it is the moon deity. Giving reference from Geetaa, (---Somo bhootvaa rasaatmakah), third scholar of Ayurveda says Soma is juice when inside the fruit and when it is extracted it becomes Rasa. We also have references of squeezing Soma-rasa from Soma plant found on Munjavat mountains. From the point of Ayurveda (books on Rasa), it seems to me understanding from Geetaa verse comes closer to meaning of Soma. Without concrete foundation for such symbolism efforts,people read different symbolisms contradictory to each other in articles by different authors written for localized fields. Is there Universal symbolism to interpret Vedic Deities ( or words such as Soma etc) which will work in all referencesgiving the same results. Otherwise Vedic symbolism appears like slippery slope. I may be enlightened on this issue so that I can grow in my knowledge with your inputs.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

 Absolutely! I am preparing a presentation I have tentatively called **Maritime Nature of the Vedic Pre-Harappans.** As Natwar Jha had pointed out, Harappans were late Vedic and the MB period. This corresponds to the Sutra-Harappa connection that I had shown through the Sulbas and also by K.D. Sethna.



 So we now have: End of Ice Age --> Flood Myths --> Older and Younger Dryas --> Indra-Vritra Myth --> Vedic-Maritime --> Vedic-Sarasvati --> Harappan-Sarasvati --> End (Drying Sarasvati)



 This covers almost 10,000 years and rests on natural history and ecology.



Regards,

Rajaram
