Dear Dr. Kalynraman,  
Thank you for posting the above link in Google buzz.  
I do not have up to date information about the litigation or the Pachauri committee report regarding Ramsetu.  
However, the archaeological research finding about the, now underwater, defensive structure constructed all along the Konkan coast, circa 8000 years back, suggests that the technology for constructing a bridge or an anicut, across a shallow stretch of water, between Sri Lanka and Bharat, was existing in the times of Lord Rama.  
With regards,  
R.N.Athavale.
