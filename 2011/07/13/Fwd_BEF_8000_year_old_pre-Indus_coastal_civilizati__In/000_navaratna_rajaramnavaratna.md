 THIS is the maritime civilization described in the *Rig Veda.*David Frawley first brought it to light in his 1991 book *Gods, Sages and Kings.* Marine archaeology now supports it.



 Frawley and I highlighted this maritime aspect in our *Hidden Horizons.*



 Obviously sea levels were lower then than now. Krishna's Dwaraka came towards the end of the maritime phase and not in 1400 BCE as found by S.R. Rao which is too late. The flooding of Dwaraka marks more or less the end of this maritime phase, which we incorrectly call the Early Harappan. It should be called the Late Maritime.



 We should all be grateful to Sri Kalyanaraman for his painstaking compilation of records and their dissemination. The photos are outstanding. I am using them for my presentation at a teacher's workshop at Dartmouth (and elsewhere) next week.
