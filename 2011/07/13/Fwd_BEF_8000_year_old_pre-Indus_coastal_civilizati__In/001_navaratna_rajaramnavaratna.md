 Absolutely! I am preparing a presentation I have tentatively called **Maritime Nature of the Vedic Pre-Harappans.** As Natwar Jha had pointed out, Harappans were late Vedic and the MB period. This corresponds to the Sutra-Harappa connection that I had shown through the Sulbas and also by K.D. Sethna.



 So we now have: End of Ice Age --> Flood Myths --> Older and Younger Dryas --> Indra-Vritra Myth --> Vedic-Maritime --> Vedic-Sarasvati --> Harappan-Sarasvati --> End (Drying Sarasvati)



 This covers almost 10,000 years and rests on natural history and ecology.



Regards,

Rajaram
