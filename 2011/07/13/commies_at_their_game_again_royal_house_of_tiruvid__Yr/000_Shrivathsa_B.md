hariH OM,  
vidvadbho namaH,  
  

 are there any historians from kerala who can let us know the truth? the article seems nothing but a "lofty" example of yellow journalism. I request vidvAns to let us know the credentials of the authors of the references of this article (given at the end of the article).

 one finds it extremely hilarious that the same maharajas who imposed "brutal" taxes went on to give up all of the money so got!!! one may have to coin a new phrase "brutally devoted" to describe the maharajas in case what the commies claim is true!!!
