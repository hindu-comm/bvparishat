It is quite shocking and depressing to learn that a great doyen of Sanskrit learning, a formidable scholar in Mimamsa, Dr Vachaspati Upadhyaya is no more. I had the pleasure of meeting him in the company of his good friend Dr Mandana Mishra many a time, as we were members of the Karya Parishat of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati. My deep condolences to the members of his family and all academics who grieve his loss.  
  
May his soul rest in peace!  
  
Prof. M. Narasimhachary
