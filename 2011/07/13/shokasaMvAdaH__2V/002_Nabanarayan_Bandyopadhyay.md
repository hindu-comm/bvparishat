Dear all,

  

We deeply mourn the sad demise of Prof. Vachaspati Upadhyay. He was a reputed scholar on Veda and Mimamsa, very dear to our fraternity, able administrator, good-hearted, pleasing and lovable person. His passing away is a great loss in the field of Sanskrit and Indology. May his soul rest in eternal peace ! We would like to send our heartfelt condolences to his bereaved family.
