Here is a similar Sukta dedicated to frogs मण्डूक-सूक्त ७.६.१०३ which is meant for producing rain. The back ground episode for this praise of the frongs is this:



The sage वसिष्ठ praised वरुण for raining and the frogs too applauded his prayer to वरुण (with their voice on raining?). and hence वसिष्ठ pleased to see them approving his prayers, he too praised them with this सूक्त as informed by Yaska.



"वसिष्ठो वर्षकामः पर्जन्यं तुष्टाव, तं मण्डूका अन्वमोदन्त। स मण्डूकान् अनुमोदमानान् दृष्ट्वा तुष्टाव।" (निरुक्त ९.६)



Sayana, explains that this Sukta is also used to be recited by Vedic scholars, for getting rain.



"वृष्टिकामेनैतद् जप्यम्।"



On the whole, the description of the frogs is beautiful with good similies. In the first itself they are compared to Brahmins who have taken Vrata lasting for one year, practicing penance utter praises to Parjanya, as the frongs also are hidden for the rest part of the year, appear suddenly (at the appearance of monsoon) with their sound produced to please the God of rain Parjanya (as they come out of their resorts only at this time with creating coarse sound).



There may be other viniyoga-s for the individual rik-s too in this Sukta. Totally it is recited for producingrain by pleasing the frogs who may be supposed to convey the prayer to Parjanya to rain.
