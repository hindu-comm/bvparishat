Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Birth of Bhagawan Buddha in 1887 BC ?



Some time ago a Time-line was posted on bvparishat. I got the printout. The name on the top is Prof, D.D,Misra. In the paper the birth of Buddha is reported in 1887 BC. Is this date solely based on astronomical calculations or was research performed with cross references ? I had hard time to pin down astronomers when it comes to timing ancient events in the subcontinent. They do not agree with each other. In some cases they use derogatory words for each other instead of supporting their dates by cross references. If Buddha was born in that ancient time, there must be references in some ancient Indian literature,compositions
(Vedic or non-Vedic) between 1887 BC and 500 BC. If such information is available, please kindly share with us so that we all can grow in our knowledge with you. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
