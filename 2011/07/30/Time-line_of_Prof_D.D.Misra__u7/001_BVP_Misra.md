*Respected Scholars,*

*I am grateful to Shri N.R.Joshi for having commented on my article on Puranic Chronology whether he agreese with my opnion or not; because I have found that those who disagree generally prefer to ignore such articles and keep on repeating about the birth of Lord Buddha in 567 BC. *



*I must remind the respected readers that I am a Professor of Engineering, not History, Sanskrit, Archeology etc. In the different stories about Lord Buddha and his contemporaries, I had learnt that he was born 5 years before King Bimbisara and died 5 years after him. In Shrimad Bhagavat Purana (12th Canto) and a few other Puranas (like Vishnu Purana, Vayu Purana etc.) the geneologies of the kings of Magadha from the time of Kurukshtra battle have been given. In all these Puranas a summary total of the period from the birth of Parikshit to the coronation of Mahapadmananda is given as a few years more than 1500 years, for verification. **In the earlier editions of these Puranas from Geetha Press, Gorakhpur, it is 1500 years. In some later editions it has been given as 1015 years.** I feel it is worth finding out how and when these changes were made.  
*

*According to these descriptions, taking the year of Kurukshetra battle as 36 years before the cornation of King Parikshit (start of Kali yuga) and the current financial year (2011 - 2012) as 5113 years in Kali Yuga, we get the birth of Lord Buddha in the year 1887 BC. *

*I shall be very grateful, if any scholar kindly points out, *

*1. Whether or not the date of birth of Lord Buddha in 1887 BC tally with his horoscope? *

*2. What is the orignal source of any other date suggested. *

*I further request the learned scholars to read the **“The complete Works of Sir William Jones (in 13 volumes) page 47 in Volume IV, 1807 edition (by Lord Teinmouth, printed for John Stockdale, Piccadelly and John Walker, Paternoster Row, 1807) to get an insight into how the dates we find in the history books were originally calculated. *

*Reagards. *

*Youra truly, *

*D D Misra
