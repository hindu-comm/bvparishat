It is only when Ministry of Human Resource Development,Central Board of Secondary Education,NCERT ,and political leaders who are bent upon throwing Sanskrit or allunifying Sanskrit tradition into the Wastepaper basket are persuaded to listen to the unifying voice of a nonHindu exPresident,the brainwashing already done by so called historians can be mitigated .

\[1\] Stefan Arvidsson. *Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science*. Translated by Sonia Wichmann. Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 2006. 354 pp. $55.00 (cloth). ISBN 978-0-226-02860-6. All citations are from this volume; page numbers are provided in parentheses.

\[2\] In this essay, I use “science” in its broadest sense of scientia, knowledge, наука. Humanists and social scientists are not let off this hook.

\[3\] The most common “others” (non-Aryan or “anti-Aryan”) in the Indo-European discourse have been, at various times, Dravidians, the indigenous, pre-Indo-European populations of Europe, and Semites

\[4\] The word “Aryan” was introduced in the mid-19^(th) century to distinguish the light-skinned, linguistically Indo-European Indians of the North (Aryans) from the dark-skinned, non-Indo-European Indians of the South. The introduction of the term “Aryan” was not casual: the “Indo-European” marker was linguistic; the “Aryan” marker is racial.

\[5\] The political and social supervision, religious conversion, education, and employment of inferior races became the “white man’s burden,” i.e., the obligation and duty of the superior race to their inferior brothers for the latter’s own benefit. That divisive term first appeared in Rudyard Kipling’s Eurocentric 1899 poem, “The White Man’s Burden,” which describes the colonizers’ noble sense of obligation in the face of the ingratitude of the colonized.

\[6\] Arvidsson defines “vitalism” here as life affirmation, the affirmation of a “strong, natural, earthly life” (152) associated with this world and nature (the notion is opposed to the belief in an afterlife of the soul).

\[7\] Arvidsson points out, but does not develop in detail, the fact that reactionary Nazi ideology was effectively coupled with the use of modern methodologies, science, and technology. Although Arvidsson does not cite the volume, Jeffrey Herf’s Reactionary Modernism; Technology, Culture, and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich (Cambridge: CUP, 1984) is relevant here in explaining how mythology and science became bedfellows in Hitler’s Germany.

\[8\] 8 Dumézil’s trifunctional hypothesis identifies sovereignty, war, and production as the three “functions” of ProtoIndo-European social structure; additionally, he divides “sovereignty” into light and legal \[kingship\] and dark and magic \[priesthood\]; his hypothesis can be explicated in other terms as well. No concrete evidence indicates that it was a feature of early Indo-European societies. Dumézil’s hypothesis has come in for considerable criticism and has been accused of being as “mythological” as its material.

\[9\] Readers interested in the “dark side” or the academic underbelly of the Indo-European discourse are referred to footnote 198 on p. 306 of Arvidsson’s text. The footnote also explains why Jaan Puhvel and perhaps J.P. Mallory are only briefly and glancingly mentioned in Aryan Idols. Another issue is Bruce Lincoln’s overtly Marxist point of view.
Marxism has traditionally criticized the neo-traditionalist and reactionary aspects of the Indo-European discourse and has been criticized by it in turn. See also: Bruce Lincoln, “Dumézil, Ideology, and the Indo-Europeans,” in Zeitschrift für Religionswissenschaft 98 (1999): 221-227, in which Lincoln traces Dumézil’s connections with the extreme right. Revered as an important scholar, Dumézil remains an ideologically ambiguous figure.

\[10\] Arvidsson distinguishes between the educated bourgeoisie and the capitalist bourgeoisie; his work addresses the mythology of the former.
He also makes the point that the Indo-European discourse was a middle-class male mythology: women, children, and proletarians were excluded and forced into the “mythic”role of irrational savages, inferior classes, or “Pelasgians” (319; here Arvidsson uses the term “Pelasgian” broadly, to refer to the \[supposedly inferior\] pre-Indo-European, Europid population of Europe, not just of Greece).

\[11\] The two exceptions were the pre-Nazi, völkisch-cultic scholar Lily Weiser-Aall (a student of Otto Höfler’s) and the Lithuanian-American feminist Marija Gimbutas.

\[12\] Another new work that also attempts to “defang” certain aspects of the Aryan myth by taking a sober, historical look at the inter-relationships among the disciplines of language, archaeology, and culture is David W. Anthony’s very readable study, *The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World* (Princeton: PUP, 2007).
