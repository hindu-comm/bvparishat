Anyhow I do not know the answers to the question raised whether Pani's are phynicians and Sarama may be some of the clans subjugated to Indra. But our present dogs or at least in the classical dogs got their name as the descendants of this सरमा as the etymology of the सारमेय meaning dog, is given as सरमाया गोत्रापत्यानि or अपत्यानि.

  

People say सरमा is the god's dog and hence the present dogs got the name. Whatever the word सरमा may denote, it may be claimed that our present dog belongs to Vedic times and handed over to us as police dog of Inra. Still they continue to serve the Police service to help the mankind in all parts of the world. This started since the time of Indra and Pani episode. Just a guess.

  

Submitted with all humility on seeing many historical events interpreted from Vedic passages.
