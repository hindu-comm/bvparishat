Respected Scholars.  
I would like to seek your valuable help with regard to the information on the Refresher Courses for the Assistant Professors of various universities in Sanskrit Sahitya, Nyaya, Vyakarana etc. for the academic year 2011-12, by various UGC Academic Staff Colleges in India. If any of you can convey the information, a few of people will be benefited. An electronic link in this regard as if any is highly appreciated.  



Regards,  
Narayanan
