Dear Scholar Friends,  
praNamyA. The book "Avayava" was printed in 1896.If we open to zerox  
the sheets will be  
broken.If Sri Jayamanikya Shastry Garu is nearer to me it can be shown  
to him in person.  
Otherwise,if any pages from the book are required I can send them as  
an attached file on the Baraha Pad in Sanskrit .The book is in Telugu  
script.I want to keep the book with me for any reference.I am in  
Andhra Pradesh at Kakinada.If the gentleman who wanted this book is  
nearer to me I can go to him to show this in person.I am going to  
Tirumala on 31st  
to assist in the Spoken Sanskrit Camp to be held at VedapaaThashaala  
from 1st,Aug to 10th,Aug 2011.On 10th, Aug I will return back.The  
modern computer technics of copying the book I do not know.How I can  
be useful to the gentleman,I am unable to understand.  
I seek any suggestion from you.  
Regards,  
ivnacharya.
