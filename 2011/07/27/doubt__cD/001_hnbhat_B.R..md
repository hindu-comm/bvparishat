Almost in every PuraNa, you will find a section called भुवनकोश. There is a study also of Purana-s in Sanskrit published long ago titled पुराणपर्यालोचना in two parts, the first an account of the contents and the second a critical study of the contents. I don't remember the exact details of publication etc. I think it is the samedownloadable from dli: here:
