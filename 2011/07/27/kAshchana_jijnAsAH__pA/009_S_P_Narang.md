There is no contradiction of grammar for Jyotish. But 100% it is founded on grammar is not acceptable. Grammar is a foundation and has its own language which differs in all the sastras including Jyotish. e.g X is a relative term in algebra, trignometry, literature etc. but in alphabets, it has its own meaning. Jyotish derives its meaning from the Veda, Nirukta, grammar, loka, experience of the people, tradition in its background and does not have its foundation only grammar necessarily. It is an independent sastra where the concepts may be similar or dissimilar. We should interpret all the sastras like that. Otherwise our conceptual meaning will be fictitious. Carry on independently and you will find good results. spnarang
