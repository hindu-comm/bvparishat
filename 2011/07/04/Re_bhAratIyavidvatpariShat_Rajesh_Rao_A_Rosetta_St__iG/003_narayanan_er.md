Respected Scholars,  
I would like to confirm on my previous posting with a doubt on the Mina Rashi, as is it the one fourth of Purvabhaadrapadaa but not the three fourth of it.  
Secondly, the Purvabhaadrapadaa and the Uttarabhaadrapadaa will create a square in the sky, as they appear to be, called the bed/cot of Ravana, having a widened head side to locate his ten heads, and the western part is the Purvabhaadrapadaa and eastern is the other. This is the Bhaadrapadaa square. Sirrah and Aljenib makes the wider side of square on the west make the Purvabhaadrapadaa. Scheat and Markab on the east make the Uttarabhaadrapadaa.  
  



Regards,  
Narayanan
