Etymology of Sanskrit shabda "Meena" !



Dear Dr G.N.Jha,



Thanks for telling us about lecture of Rajesh Rao. Indus script is not easy subject.



By the way, what is the etymology of the shabda "Meena" (fish) assuming that it is Sanskrit word? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

The presentation by Mr Rao is good entertainment.  
  
He should understand that the excercise he has undertaken is a serious  
one - probably much more than solving a crossword puzzle. And therefore  
he may consider obtaining latest data and research in the area to get a  
comprehensive understanding of the issues involved. In this context, I  
would like to recommend a recent publication titled "Origin of Indian  
Civilization" (DK Printword 2010) edited by Bal Ram Singh.  
  
I am wondering what made Mr Rao cite Parpola whose expertise on Indian  
languages is questionable when he traces the word 'meen' to Tamil. I am  
sure all in this group would agree that 'meen' has a Sanskrit origin. I  
think it is high time intrepretation of India is done little more  
sensibly than what it has been done so far.
