Respected Professor Iyengar,  
Ravana's cot is only an imaginary statement on the basis of the appearance of an imaginary square. Naturally when one who is having ten heads, and for him to lay upon if a cot is necessary, then the head part should normally be widened. I got this idea from a Malayalam blog of which I put a link if you like to look at the pictures of P & U Bhaadrapadaa as square :

The blog post discusses about pegasus, the flying horse according to the Greek Mythology. The post also claims that Ptolemy also included pegasus in his list of 48 constellations. The blog was posted on Sunday, 9th January, 2011. But the blog post does not give any reference to any Ravana cot story, rather than the mentioning that Indians call it as Ravana cot. It also claims that pegasus could be visible by 8pm every day in India. It says that Indians call Bhaadrapadaa square for the combination of P & U Bhaadrapadaa. The confirmation on the Mina Rashi's elements of constellation was on the basis of a conversation between Narada and Pulastya in the Vamana Purana. It reads :  
धनिष्ठार्द्धं शतभिषा प्रोष्टपदांशकत्रयम्। सौरं पद्मापरमिदं कुम्भो जङ्घे च विश्रुते॥  
प्रोष्ठपदांशमेकन्तु उत्तरा रेवती तथा। द्वितीयं जीवसदनं मीनन्तु चरणावुभौ॥........................  
इति श्रीवामनपुराणे पुलस्त्यनारदसंवादे हरललितः पञ्चमोऽध्यायः॥ (These are quoted from the Sabdakalpadruma under the word राशिः)  
It is clear from the picture in the blog link that one side of the cot like figure is widened. Please see the link :
