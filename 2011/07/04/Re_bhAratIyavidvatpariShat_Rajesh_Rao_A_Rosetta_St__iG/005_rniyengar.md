Dear Dr.Narayanan,

Some time back we discussed Nakshatra names when you explained the  
older names of P & U.Bhadrapadas. These were known as Proshthapada.  
You gave valuable information:

प्रोष्ठपद the Sabdakalpadruma gives the following  
details:  
प्रोष्ठपदः। पुं०। (प्रोष्ठी गौस्तस्येव पादौ यस्य सः।  
''सुप्रातसुश्वमुदिवेति।''  
५। ४। १२०। इति अच् प्रत्ययेन साधुः। प्रोष्ठपदी  
नक्षत्रविशेषस्तद्युक्ता  
पौर्णमासी यत्र मासे। अण्। पक्षे न वृद्धिः।) भाद्रमासः। इत्यमरः॥  
(नक्षत्रविशेषः।  
यथा। महाभारते। ६। ३। १४। ''शुक्रः प्रोष्ठपदे पूर्बे समारुह्य  
विरोचते॥'' यथा  
च मार्कण्डेये। ३३। १५। ''अजाविकं प्रोष्ठपदे  
विन्देद्धावांस्तथोत्तरे॥''  
गोतुल्यपदयुक्ते। त्रि। इति व्याकरणम्॥)

NOw you have posted new interesting information that the four  
Bhadrapada square is 'RavaNa's cot'  
Please provide the reference for this also.

Thanks

RN Iyengar
