Respected Professor Bhattacharya,  
I have only heard about the name, naturally, of the great prolific scholar and teacher Mahamahopadhyaya Pattabhirama Sastri, from Professor Satya Vrat Shastri and Professor Satkari Mukhopadhyaya. And, Sir, you were being a direct disciple of him, you can kindly share more with us about the teaching methodology, versatility in scholarship, intimacy towards the listeners, extreme respect for the Shastras etc. that he might have practised in his life time. I will love to read it such proficiency, dedication and intimacy that a good number of people had in certain period of time.  
Regards,  
Narayanan
