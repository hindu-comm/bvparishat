Respected Professor Patnaik,  
  
The term "पन्नग" is a synonym of snake. "पन्न" means downward motion. पन्नं अधोगमनं पतितं वा गच्छतीति। गमॢ गतौ।
अन्तात्यन्ताध्वदूरपारसर्वानन्तेषु डः (Panini Rule 3-2-48). सर्वत्र पन्नयोरुपसंख्यनम् (Katyayana Varttika Rule) इति गमेर्डः। पद्ग्यां न गच्छतीति वा विग्रहः। सर्पः is the meaning according to Amarasimha.  
  
The Hindi version of the Oriya Mahabharata is available in the Google book from internet. Vaikuntha is the location of Narayana. There is a Vaikuntha named Pannagabandha where Pannaganarayana is residing, who is shapeless, having colour of transparent glass prism. Neither night nor day can hardly enter into Pannaganarayana.  
  
The context is the conversation in between Vyasa and the King Bhumanyu. Vyasa says : King !, Listen, I explain scientifically. The gods among their groups incarnate in between space of heaven and earth. Duryodhana is an apparent incarnation of Pannaganarayana. You, Bhumanyu! had become the King of Bhutala (earth) after breaking shackles of Svarga, Martya, Patala, Sutala, Rasatala and Atitala etc. Bhumanyu's daughter Bhanumati had been the wife of Duryodhana for many a number of births. King! your daughter Bhanumati did continuous thinking about Pannaganarayana for one lakh years to achieve Pannaganarayana for herself. So, it is gods' wish that you gave your daughter to Pannaganarayana. One Brahman called Sudraka also did penance of Pannaganarayana for long. But its result never went as equal to the dedication of Bhanumati."  
  
The notion behind this story might be how dedicated you are for many a number of births to achieve something virtuous; and secondly, the genuine matching of marital relationship might inherit even era after era, thirdly, rebirth soul transformation, fourthly, quality transformation through many births, acquiring virtues though multiple births etc. These messages might be what Vyasa wants to teach the world. For twelve thousand years Nara and Narayana did penance and fight to defeat Sahasrakavaca, on alternative fight and penance method; where Nara was Arjuna and Narayana was Krishna.  



Regards,  
Narayanan
