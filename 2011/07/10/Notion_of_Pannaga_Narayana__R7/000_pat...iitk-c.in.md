Dear Colleagues,

Would you kindly enlighten me on the notion of Pannaga Narayana? There is  
reference to him in the Mahabharata that the Odia poet Sarala Das wrote in  
the 15th century. It is said that he was cursed to be born in the mortal  
world. He is surely not Narayana (Vishnu), that's quite clear in Sarala's  
text itself. What is the notion of Pannaga Narayana in the tradition?

I will benefit immensely from your input.

Best respects,
