I think this is the verse I had heard long ago:



अप्पा कुट्टिरयं साधुः कुट्टित्वात् पन्निकुट्टिवत्।

पाम्बुकुट्टावतिव्याप्तं तद्भिन्नत्वं निवेश्यताम्॥



The meaning for both Panni is pig, (it is not correct reproduction of Tamil word, Panri would be the one, through malayalam panni.). I recollected from my memoryपाम्बुpaambu (is संवृत उकारः common for many Tamil and Malayalam common stock words)which means separately serpent and not related with the previous one as the verse itself makes it clear. कुट्टि- is also Tami/Malayalam commonstock word, meaning young one. अप्पा is Tamil Interjection word denoting exclamation. How this child is smart, like cub of pig.Easy wayof escaping अतिव्याप्ति by modifyingthe hetu,with"tadbhinnatva" is made the point here. This was Iheard from the above verse from my Malayalee friends.The one you have heard may be a Tamil version of the same idea.
