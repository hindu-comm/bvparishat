Madam



I am just curious here. I started off by wondering why you reject the intended meaning of Dr. Singh, namely the system of KaNaada. Then, two curious usages struck me: VaiSeshika Schoolof Vedanta and Chemico-physics.On further investigation, it turns out that the first is an instance of somebody reporting without understanding the terms used. Here is an abstract of Dr. Singh's presentation where all the terms are used properly: <http://www.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/centerforindicstudies/ved2011_drsingh_abstract.pdf>The second one, 'chemico-physics'isnew to me, apart from sounding (to me, that is)quiteinelegant. Googling showed it to be used by non-English speakers like Koreans and Chinese expressing themselves in English; but since Dr. Singh is a Professor of Chemistry, I think we should accept it usageas SishTaachaara.



The operative part of the paper seems to be that"an attempt is being made to extract universal knowledge of *Vedic* tradition through chemical interpretations of the elements of substance or *dravya* of *Vaseshik* concept with examples of explaining cause of chemical toxicity, origin and evolution of life, and realization of self as the source of universe and infinity" as opposed to looking"for references of metals, atoms, etc. in the text \[of the Vedas\]to somehow justify the validity of the ancient knowledge rather than *vice versa*. "



Here is a paper of Dr. Singh <http://www.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/centerforindicstudies/chemistry_vedic.pdf>which gives some of his thoughts on the subject of Chemistry and VaiSeshika, especially from Page 5 onwards. To me it looks like just like Allopathy can benefit from borrowingsome aspects of Ayurveda (for instance, theeffect of various food substances on the body; when we get sick,we usually take themedicinesprescribed by the modern doctor, but disregard his/her advice of 'eat what you feel like'and follow the traditional 'pathyam') and become holistic, Chemistry should also consider each molecule not just in isolation but in space and time. While as a suggestion this might be valid, it takes decades offollow-up research to make visible progress. Earlier the research money was controlled by a culture which would reject all this as superstition or mysticism; now that India is much richer and many decision-makers know first hand the validity of traditional knowledge - what would happen if one were to eat too many mangoes on a single day? Modern medicine does not know, but grandma knows - hopefully some research grants would be made.
