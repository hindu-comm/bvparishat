 Koenraad is essentially right, but he is wrong to say "how come none has been argued for in confrontation with any of the other decipherments, Sanskritic or Dravidian or other? How come no one (except for SR Rao, as mentioned) has tried to fit the proposed history of Harappan and Brahmi in the wider history of scripts?"



 Jha and I have made a brief comparision with both Brahmi and Aramaic. Instead of debating us, Witzel & Co diverted attention from the obvious conclusion of Harappan as Vedic with personal attacks and raising irrelevantissues like the Harappan horse.(On a technical matter, there is no 'Dravidian' script independent of Brahmi.)



 Recognizing that the climate was not conducive to an informed debate, Jha and I decide to hold back any more publications of our results until the climate improved.In the meantime Jha died and I have been too busy with my work on natural history and genetics, and more recently on Vedanta and quantum physics, which has attracted a good deal of attention.



 So exploring the evolution of scripts (and number systems, the should be studied together) is low on my priority list. If this means loss of important results, it is not my fault. India scholars (Elst included) should have ensured a healthy climate instead of advising me to withdraw our work and concede the Witzel-Farmer claims. Again, Parpola's advocacy of the DMK ideology (for money) has received no condemntations from the linguists (including Elst).



 Why shouldI treat such people as reputable scholars and colleagues, especially when I can deal with my science colleagues in a professional manner, with civility and on the basis of mutual respect.



 In the meantime, Witzel & Co are in disgrace, I went to Cambridge, Mass and presented my findings in his face and he wouldn't dare face us at Dartmouth where Elst was also present. And the field is also facing a meltdown, with little money and few students. So, why should I waste time on such people?



 So, my advice is set your house in order. Right now there are too many amateures and academic pretenders for a serious person to waste his time on.
