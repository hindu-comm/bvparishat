It is not a point of the cradle land. It is a point of racial and linguistic approaches. Your approach appears to be racial. The basic tenet of linguistic family, that is, existence of a dialect free language has not neen met as yet. Instead theyinvented 'nostratic'. I do not go in merits and demerits of this thesis which was itself sidelined, but the fact remains that language isnot a genetic outcome, but a social product. We must start thinking rather than exchanging our classnotes.
