We should not quote authorities. We must place facts and logic to support our contention. Dr. Bhattacharya being more knowledgeble than me must be aware that the term Arya denoted prosperious, master and the 'class' owning property, deemed to be ideals being more civilised. Briefly, Aryans were like seTha- shreSth, saahu-saadhu, and were model of their siciety. Their language, the traders language - and their fortified habitations as attested in Dashly, Sapally and Kurgan culture were originally dubbed as aaryan and aaryaanaa. That creates confusion as we have numerous locations claiming to be habitat of Aryans.

I wish to start a dialogue, not to win the argument. We should think rather than cite. What Shintasta meanfrom which the Andronovo people (the Aryans)are shown to be advancing towards India (by Prpola and thier likes)? and why towars India alone? Shintasta means the country of Sindhis. They called themselves Sindois even much klater. They had changed many local geograophical names in their nostalia. These things are on record. If need be I shall elaborate.Let us note that they are not Aryans, but Sindhis returing for their safetytowards their cherished home which they hardly reached, during the imponderable catastrophy nest to glaciation. That is prolonged aridity and extreme meterological vagaries. The period corresponfing to Vedegha Mathav episode. I want that we should discuss to understsand better than to prove ourselves better.``
