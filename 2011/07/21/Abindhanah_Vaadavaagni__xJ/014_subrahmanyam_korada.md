The statement that something is not there in Vedas is not authoritative . There are 1136 Sakhas , according to Patanjali of Paspasa .  
Obviously not all of them are available .  
  
Further , Patanjali cautions (Paspasa) -- asti aprayukta.h iti
sAhasamAtrameva .  
  
Vacaspatimisra said the word 'kus'A' is not there . But Deeks.ita says it is there in Veda -- Praudhamanorama under 'jAnapadakun.d.agon.a ..' .  
  
Earlier also many scholars made the same comment . I have already made this point clear long ago .
