Respected Professor Bhat,  
  
Thank you very much, Sir, for your predominant guess.  
  
M. M. Williams Dictionary also says : abindhana (masculine). 'having water (ap) for fuel', submarine fire (Ragh. xiii, 14).  
  
Your guess is more strong with the fact the Magnesium and Sodium will burn under water. How does magnesium and sodium burn underwater? They react violently with water forming hydroxides. This process cleaves the O-H bond of water and releases energy as it is an exothermic reaction. You usually think of water as a fire extinguisher. This is true but only for combustion reactions that require oxygen to combust. When water participates in the reaction, this doesn't hold up and energy is released.  
  
Please see this link on this regard :
