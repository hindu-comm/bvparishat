Namaste!  
Please note I did not say that VaDavaa is not there in the VEDAS. I  
only wrote: "The word VaDavaa is not found in Vedic literature till  
the Asvalayana GS..". In what sense my statement is not authoritative?  
If the word is found in any available Vedic text I would be grateful  
for the information. Scholars more knowledgeable about vyaapti,  
avyaapti etc may kindly enlighten me in what way I am wrong as far as  
pratyaksha evidence is concerned. I would be happy to be corrected
