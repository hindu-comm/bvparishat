Dear Scholars,

The word VaDavaa is not found in Vedic literature till the Asvalayana  
Grhya sutra, where it is the name of a lady teacher (vaDavaa  
praatitheyii). The connection between the fire of the same name and  
its relation with a horsehead is intriguing. I have investigated this  
in some detail in my paper published in the Indian J of History of  
Science, 2004. Since the paper is too long I am herewith attaching 3-4  
pages which refer to VaDava (M and Fem) as a fire. My understanding  
is; technically it was a natural fire which from a distance looked  
like a horse-head or moving like a horse.... If we treat the  
Mahabharata (text) as older than the PuraaNa(texts), this fire was  
originally feminine and celestial, brought down to earth/ocean  
(possibly meteoritic impacts. Adiparvan: see attachment for full  
quotes). However the word is also used in a generic sense of  
underground fire in the Mahabharata (Tirtha Yatraparva where it is in  
Kashmir).  
I see a relation between the MBh sky-fire (Tvaastrii tu savituh  
bhaaryaa vaDavaa ruupa-dhaariNii..) and the Birth of the celestial  
Horse in RV (1.162 & 163). No doubt, these RV hymns are taken to refer  
to Ashvamedha by Yajnikas, but basically the hymns describe a horse  
like object in the sky.

Before the word denoted any sea-fire, I think it was associated with  
the drying of the River Sarasvati (Skaanda Pu,  
prabhasa-kshetra-mahatmya). It should have been a petroliferous fire  
along the river course. Oil being lighter than water would have burnt  
on the surface looking like a running horse-head from a distance. I  
don't think the term 'abindhana' was meant to be taken in a literal  
sense.

Submerged volanoes are also possible, which would seem to be burning in water.  
All this was connected with a natural disaster, the outlines of which  
can be downloaded or read in full at

There is a town or place in Gujarat called Wadhva or perhaps  
originally VaDava. Does this have any link to the topic under  
discussion?

\> the process. This is just a guess of the property of sodium of reacting withair and water alike burning violently and the production of sodium chloride in the ocean.  
\>  
\>\>\>Thismay be the basis for the concept ofthe fire using the water as fuel, which is a real fact in case of sodium metal coming into contact with water. The Puranic episode supports this destructive property as related to Rudra, or a horse created by him residing in ocean which emits firebasis for theepithet वडवानलः, and वडवामुखः.Kalikaapuraana, etc.
