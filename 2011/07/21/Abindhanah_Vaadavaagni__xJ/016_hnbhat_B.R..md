Just copying the reply to your above query posted by one member Anandaghanam in a separate thread(created separately to point out this), if you have not read that thread:

Now I have not checked the text of Taittiriya Brahmana, but it it is verifiable, text, it is to be taken granted that in your opinion Taittiriya Brahmana is later that Ashvalayana GS as inferable from your sentence. It depends on the chronology acceptable for Vedic Literature, which is subject to variously differing opinions among the scholars.

  

By the way, I could not locate in Rgveda the word, with the commentary of Sayana, published from Mysore.
