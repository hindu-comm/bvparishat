Dear Narayana  
Vaadavagni refers to marine fire. samudre agni-utpatti. The cause of  
that may be different.  
Abindhanam divyam Vidyuadaadi. This is the line from Tarkasamgraha of  
Annam bhatta, where he classifies the substance fire into four-divya,  
bhauma, audarya and aakaraja- devine, of earth, of stomach and of  
mine. For divya (celestial) fire he writes above sentence i.e. that  
(lightening etc) of which the fuel is fire.
