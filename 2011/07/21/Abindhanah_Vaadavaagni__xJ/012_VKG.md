Dear Sri Narayanan!

I have the following ideas to share.  
1. Ap (Jal) necessarily does not mean, just H2O. Liquids may be  
denoted by this.  
2. Srushtikrama, described in Upanishat also says - Agner Aapah.  
Adbhyah Pruthiwee. (Since the Kaarana has its presence in the Kaarya;  
Agni is present in a subtler form in Aapa.  
3. The simily given in Chhandogya is typical. As the body is  
overheated, sweat oozes out. Water is the Direct reaction of the  
excessive heat.  
4. Similarly, one Mantra in Agni chayana, also narrates this well.  
(Divaspari Prathamam...)  
Here I would like to interpret, Agni as energy; who has three  
principal places/ Originating points. a) Divine world (Dyuloka)/  
Celestial Matter (b) Creatures like us (c) Water

Thus, we can say that Hydro Carbons, construed as Ap (Jala); is the  
fuel for Agni.  
Saraswati Mantra - Maapasphareeh Payasaa Maa Na Aadhak - also explains  
this concept better. If we take the word as Erstwhile Saraswati River,  
it also means the HydroCarbon Deposits in the Saraswati Basin, in the  
current day Rajasthan's Barmer District and regions, where onshore/  
inland Oil Exploration is successful by ONGC/ Cairns Combine.  
(The prayer succinctly gives a wonderful message to humankind, with  
the connection with Oil-wars).

More thoughts are welcome.
