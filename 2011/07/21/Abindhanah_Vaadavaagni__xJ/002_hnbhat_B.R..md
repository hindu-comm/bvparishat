Just a guess.



In all probability, where thereare under waterdeposits ofores ofsodium highly reacting to wanter and oxeygen, So the deposits of sodium metal may glow and form sodium cloride and hydrogen using the oxeygen in the water. But since the water is unlimited and inexhaustible, it ever produces sodium chloride, in other words salt produced by the process. This is just a guess of the property of sodium of reacting withair and water alike burning violently and the production of sodium chloride in the ocean.



Thismay be the basis for the concept ofthe fire using the water as fuel, which is a real fact in case of sodium metal coming into contact with water. The Puranic episode supports this destructive property as related to Rudra, or a horse created by him residing in ocean which emits firebasis for theepithet वडवानलः, and वडवामुखः.Kalikaapuraana, etc.



But someone scholar with the properties of the sodium deposits in the ocean should confirm this guess as I am not competent to do it. This may be a fact or a fiction too.
