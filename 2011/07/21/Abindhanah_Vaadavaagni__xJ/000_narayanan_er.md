Respected Scholars,  
There are two popular terms in Sanskrit : Abindhanah & Vaadavaagnih as synonyms. Kalidasa uses the term abindhana in his Raghuvamshamahakvya (13-4) : अबिन्धनं वह्निमसौ बिभर्ति प्रह्लादनं ज्योतिरजन्यनेन ।। The etymology of the term आपएव इन्धनमुद्दीपनसाधनं यस्य सः अबिन्धनः। (A type of fire stimulated with the fuel of water !!!). My question is whether the abindhana concept is simply rhetoric or water could be used as a fuel, as the moderners experimenting with the non-organic ingredients like monoxide form of H2O, peroxide form of H2O2 etc.  
Regarding Vaadavaagnih, the Siddhantasiromani of Bhaskara speaks in its Goladhyaya :  
लङ्काकुमध्ये यमकोटिरस्याः प्राक् पश्चिमे रोमकपत्तनश्च।  
अधस्ततः सिद्धपुरं सुमेरुः सौम्येऽथ याम्ये वडवानलश्च।  
कुवृत्तपादान्तरितानि तानि स्थानानि षड् गोलविदो वदन्ति॥  
Whether it is वडवा or बडवा (people say: वबयोरभेदः), it is female horse.  
There are synonyms for the ocean originated fire Vaadavaagni, like बडवाग्निः, बडवामुखः, etc. and etymology of the term is बडवायाः समुद्रस्थितायाः घोटक्या मुखस्थोऽग्निः। There is an Aurva sage's supporting Puranic story behind it as well. (the Matsya Purana 150 ??) . Here also, I doubt, whether it is a story for the sake of a story or something profound scientific in it.
