Dear Sir,



I know I am not competent to explain the details of the concepts in
their respective ritual contexts. They have already been explained in their own way by Sri VK Ghanapathi and Vipratheertha.



I am here with attaching twocompiledpdfpages containing the related entries in the Vacaspatya lexicon for your reference andmorecan be read from the same about the concept.



Astheyobviously appear, they are derived etymologically from the verb उक्ष सेचने (**उक्ष सेचने** १. ७४५) + ल्युट्. prefixed with अव, उप, परि, प्र etc. with their meaning moduled by the prefixes as explained by VK Ghanapathi and defined in the message of Vipratheertha. More of the usages are probably to be found in श्रौतसूत्र-s and गृह्यसूत्र-s in their ritual context.
