Pranam  
Usually, this relates with the sprinkling of water. Let me explain, by  
the way - we are trained and practice.  
Though it has a contextual etymological relevance; it is Roodha.  
All the three are positions of the palm while sprinkling water.  
1) Prokshana - The palm is facing up (towards sky). (Pra - Good, Soak/  
Sprinkle)  
2) Abhyukshana - The water trickles from the (loose) fist bottom, as  
the thumb is up. Normally this corresponds to Deva Teertha. (Abhi -  
Well/ Round/ Against)  
3) Avokshana - The palm faces the ground. (Ava - Down, Sprinkling)
