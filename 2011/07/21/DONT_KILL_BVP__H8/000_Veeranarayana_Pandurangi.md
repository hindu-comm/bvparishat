dear all,

I am very much afraid that BVP which started with the great goals is witnessing many many mails from our members which have nothing to do with its goals. stop them immediately if you all want to contribute to bvp. for example

  

kalyanaramans posting has nothing to do with bvp

# US-India, form an Indian Ocean Community as counterpoise European Community

  

jayamanikyashastrins posting

# Fwd: How beautiful this Friendship.!!!!

is still getting continued for nothing. please stop if you want to contribute to bvp. DONT Kill BVP

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
