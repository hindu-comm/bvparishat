Namaste  
  
1. I resonate with the views expressed by all of you here. There is  
a world of problems with understanding of 'Bharateeya Ithiahsa-Purana -  
Darshana-Shastra ' in an alien model and language. The threads need to  
be crisp and focussed. The general postings of social issues can be  
taken out by moderator. I believe a reading of the 'Group description'  
will be the guideline for such channelling of the posts.  
  
2. Regarding Dr. Narayan Joshi (giravani; who is in a senior age  
group) and the related posts made by him, please recognize that he is  
bringing in a perspective, as a trained scientist and interested in  
Mahabharata itihasa beyond India. This aspect of study is not normally  
taken up in Indian circles. And about other questions on semantics, he  
raises: Dr.Joshi is a researcher in accoustics and well trained  
physicist. His interest in 'Vaak' deliberation would be in what can be  
captured in the instrument and lab, rather than esoteric 'paraa- vak /  
sphota' et al. If his questions fall outside the defined boundary of  
BVP forum, then moderator may please be courteous to say that the  
issue raised falls beyond the scope of BVP. The deliberations can  
still go on in a private space.  
  
  
(I have removed much of the trailing part of the mail.).
