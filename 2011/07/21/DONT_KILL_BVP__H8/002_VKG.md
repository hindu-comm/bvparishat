I absolutely agree with Sri Pandurangi!  
  
Some of the personal exchanges are creeping into the domain. And, one  
more important note.  
  
Please refer to the Character Notes; usually emanating from one  
[gira...@juno.com](). These make the mails longer and and entire daily  
digest very heavy and distracting.  
  
I also request members to update their browsers and send the relevant  
portions. Otherwise, some of the mails, with all previous attachments,  
run into four/ five pages.  
  
Kindly cooperate.

July 21, 2011 Respected Scholars, Namaskar! Back to Aryans ! I respect  
views of both Dr.Bhagwan Singh and Dr. D. Bhattacharya. To the best of  
my knowledge nobody has discovered that pristine, dialect free  
language, the mother of all Indo-European languages as Dr. Bhagwan  
Singh stated. At the same time we cannot ignore close linguistic  
relationship of the ancient Indians with the ancient Persians. So the  
observations of Dr. D. Bhattacharya are also correct. And in free  
Indian society everybody has right to present his views without fear  
of any other views. Having said this, I will greatly appreciate if Dr.  
D. Bhattacharya will kindly illuminate us by suggesting possible  
location (or locations) of ancient residence of undivided Aryan family  
according to his understanding. I am fully familiar with ancient  
history of all nations from Finland to Afghanistan. All over Asia  
there was presence of Aryans in the ancient time. This is unsolved  
puzzle. I repeatedly suggested on this list, that when European  
scholars come to India for conferences, please ask them questions  
about presence of Indo-Aryans in their countries in the ancient times.  
Instead Dravidians want to get glorified by talks of Dr. Parpola from  
Finland and non-Dravidians would like to get glorified by talks of Dr.  
Kazanas. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

It is not a point of the cradle land. It is a point of racial and  
linguistic approaches. Your approach appears to be racial. The basic  
tenet of linguistic family, that is, existence of a dialect free  
language has not neen met as yet. Instead they invented 'nostratic'. I  
do not go in merits and demerits of this thesis which was itself  
sidelined, but the fact remains that language is not a genetic  
outcome, but a social product. We must start thinking rather than  
exchanging our classnotes.BS From: Dipak Bhattacharya

Whether one believes in it or not, the question of Aryan invasion is  
irrelevant here. One cannot deny that the cultural ancestors of the  
Vedic and Irano-Aryan people lived together somewhere, in India  
according to you -- so it seems. The formative elements of the myth  
date back to that age and region. This has nothing to do with an Aryan  
invasion/ immigration theory  
Without taking part in any debate, this much is to be granted that it  
is not compulsory that everyone should have a common belief as in  
totalitarian states. Ours is a free country. This has to be respected  
with humility. I believe with respect that you and everybody have  
right to have personal convictions. Everyone deserves the same  
consideration.

This is not a reply but just a query. Does Dr. Bhattacharya still  
believe in Aryan race, Aryan invasion/migration? BSFrom: Dipak

Some comments were made by me on the possible confusion between the  
&#7770;gvedic and Avestic Ap&#257;&#7747; nap&#257;t on one hand and  
the Avestic fire in the deep sea and Va&#7693;av&#257; on the other in  
a paper entitled &lsquo;Ap&#257;m nap&#257;t in the &#7770;gveda and  
Avesta&rsquo; published in the Journal of the Department of Sanskrit,  
Vol.XIII, 2005,1-14 Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata. The relevant  
passage is cited below and may be taken for whatever it is worth. The  
Avestan description is inconsistent &mdash; Ap&#257;&#7747; nap&#257;t  
does not live in the deep sea -- but it allows me to still maintain  
that the two are different and that it is possible that the myth of  
Va&#7693;av&#257; fire is the same as that of the fire of the deep sea  
in Avesta and that the two hail from the days of undivided Aryans.  
BestDB pp.5-6&ldquo;There is another myth which may give rise to  
confusion about the relation between the two Ap&#257;&#7747;  
nap&#257;ts. Ya&scaron;t.19-46-53 tell of a fight between the Good  
Spirit and the Evil Spirit where &#256;tar, the fire god, fights  
against Azi Dah&#257;ka for the Glory that cannot be seized by force  
(axvar&part;ta xvar&part;na). The Glory ultimately goes to Ap&#261;m  
nap&#257;t who lives in the deep sea (vouru ka&#7779;a). The story may  
be related to the Puranic myth of Va&#7693;av&#257;-fire of the deep-  
sea, which K&#257;lid&#257;sa (Raghu. 13.5) mentions as &lsquo;fire  
with water as fuel&rsquo; and might have its origin in the sight of  
natural fire produced in mineral oil by the undivided Aryans. But  
there is no reason to see any identity of &#256;tar and Ap&#261;m  
nap&#257;t in the story. &#256;tar is the son of Ahura Mazda while  
Ap&#261;m nap&#257;t belongs to the waters. Avestic theology does not  
harp on monistic equations as in the &#7770;gveda. Also, there is no  
theory known to me about any relation between the Va&#7693;av&#257;  
fire and Ap&#257;&#769;m nap&#257;&#769;t.&rdquo;
