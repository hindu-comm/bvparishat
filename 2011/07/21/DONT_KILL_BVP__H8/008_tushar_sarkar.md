Dear Scholars and Friends,  
I am a regular reader of postings on thebvp site.Of late, I read some postings on 'killing BVP' & also responses to it. Personally, I became aware of our ancient Indian history & tradition, especially from the postings by scholars like C.K.Raju (on Indian Mathematics tradition), of S.Kalyanaramana (on Harappan script & cultureas well as onancient Aryan culture etc.,). I believe theseshould beconsidered extremely relevant topicsfor any **'vidvan'**who is an open-minded Indian. I saw someone expressing the view that Kalyanaramana's postings on 'Indian Ocean Community' is **NOT** relevantfor BVP site & its objectives.I strongly disagree.Once we take 'vidvan' in its broad sense, drawing a sharp line between what is relevant and what is not, becomes a very tricky matter. I admit that some postings in the past ( for example, the one on what price some Muslim organizations 'proposed/fixed' for non-muslim Indian girls, for Muslim youths to marry') is **certainly irrelevant.** But the veryfact that I differ from some others about the relevance of postings by Raju, Kalyanaramana etc., shows how important our personal biases are for drawing a line between 'relevant' & 'irrelevant'. Possibly, most of the BVP members are Sanskritists, yet I feel that some of the postings on the etymology/derivation of some Sanskrit words/ meaning of some prakriti-pratyayas are not that terriblyrelevant to the BVP objective either.This does **not** entitle me to say that they are irrelevant. Relevance is a matter of being dovetailed into one's personal academic **orientationGestalt.**In Information Theory, using**redundancy** is a way of eliminating uncertainty/error. There may be some irrelevant postings in BVP. Consider those as needless 'redundancy'.However,in order to blockthem, itcanhardly bean advisable strategyto'throw the baby alongwith the bath tub'-- to kill the BVP site itself. Long live BVP site.
