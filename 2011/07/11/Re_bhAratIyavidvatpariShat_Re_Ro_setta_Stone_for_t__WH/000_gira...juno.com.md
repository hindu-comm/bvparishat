Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Indo-Aryans in Parpola's country



Dear Dr. N. Rajaram,



Thanks for informing us the political side of certain scholarly work. Last year Dr. Parpola visited India. He talks about Tamil language etc. I do not know whether he talks about the presence of Indo-Aryans in his own country Finland in the ancient time. That history of Finland will also be helpful to understand the ancient history of India. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

 No one is denying give-and-take between Sanskrit and Tamil or any other languages, but what authority does Parpola have to claim Tamil origin for known sanskrit words?



 Also, Tamil records, meaning inscriptions go back only about 2000 years at the most. Harappan seals are at least twice that old. How does he fill that huge historical gap with the fish etymology?



 Parpola has been in the pay of Dravidian politicians for the long time. Most recently he received a Rs 20 lakh 'Classical Tamil' award for 'proving' Harappan civilization to beling the creation of Old Tamils.



 We can similarly claim that South Indian temples like Mahabalipuram, Madhurai, etc were built by Punjabis, say Sikhs from Amritsar.



 If someone pays me 10 crores, I am prepared to say that Tamils built the Pyramids of Egypt also.



 The whole enterprise sounds very fishy to me.



N.S. Rajaram
