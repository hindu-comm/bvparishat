Dear KalyanaRaman,

Thanks for the posting.

Do you also have any information on the svara's for chanting? (of udaatta, anudatta, svarita, prachaya etc?) Do we have any set of rules for these svaras. I have heard different versions of rules none of which are consistent when applied practically.

The classical example being rangasvara. In yajur veda most people chant it as ending in 'gum' ( as in rudram 'sahasrasho vaisha gum heda eemahe...). Also the svara prakriya of panini also does notseem to address all the situations we have in vedas today.

Any clue from any scholar is greatly appreciated.



Thanks
