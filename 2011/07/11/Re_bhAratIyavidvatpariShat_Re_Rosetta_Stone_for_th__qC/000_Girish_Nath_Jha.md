Etymologies can be forced, false and be questioned as grammarian's  
jugglery. Evidence gathered from Such exercises should be always  
secondary to the actual use of this word in a text and a context by the  
very people who own the language. I would therefore emphasize on the  
textual reference for this word which are in plenty even earlier than रघुवंशम्  
that Apte has quoted. Here is one from Ramayana -

शिंशुमारोरगगणैः मीनैः अपि च चञ्चलैः । विद्युद्भिः इव विक्षिप्तैः आकाशम् अभवत्  
तदा ॥ (रामायण 1.42.12).

I found at least 25 references in Ramayana, 54 references in Mahabharata  
for this word. Please check this word in other texts as well on my site  
<http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/vedanta/index.jsp> by typing the word in the  
text box and clicking the text you want to search this in.

If a Tamil text can cite an earlier reference to this word, there should  
be no difficulty in accepting it of Tamil origin. And even if it belongs  
to Tamil, it still is a common heritage of whole of India not only  
south.

On a similar note the, the argument concerning the origin of the word द्रविड  
can be settled by citing numerous references from Mahabharata –

1)  
पाण्ड्यांश्चद्रविडांश्चैव सहितांश्चोड्रकेरलैः । अन्ध्रांस्तलवनांश्चैव कलिङ्गानोष्ट्रकर्णिकान्  
॥  
Reference: 2.23.28.0.48(सभापर्व>दिग्विजयपर्व>अष्टाविंशोऽध्यायः  
(28)>श्लोक#48)  
2)  
द्रविडाः सिंहलाश्चैव राजा काश्मीरकस्तथा । कुन्तिभोजो महातेजाः सुह्मश्च सुमहाबलः  
॥  
Reference: 2.24.31.0.12(सभापर्व>राजसूयिकपर्व>एकत्रिंशोऽध्यायः  
(31)>श्लोक#12)  
3)  
यत्र सर्वान्महीपालाञ्शस्त्रतेजोभयार्दितान् ।सवङ्गाङ्गान्सपौण्ड्रोड्रान्सचोलद्रविडान्धकान्  
॥  
Reference: 3.32.48.0.18(वनपर्व (आरण्यकपर्व)>इन्द्रलोकाभिगमनपर्व>अष्टचत्वारिंशोऽध्यायः  
(48)>श्लोक#18  
4)  
ततो विपाप्माद्रविडेषु राजन्समुद्रमासाद्य च लोकपुण्यम् । अगस्त्यतीर्थं च पवित्रपुण्यं  
नारीतीर्थान्यथ वीरो ददर्श ॥  
Reference: 3.33.118.0.4(वनपर्व (आरण्यकपर्व)>तीर्थयात्रापर्व>अष्टादशाधिकशततमोऽध्यायः  
(118)>श्लोक#4)  
5)  
प्राच्यैः प्रतीच्यैरथ दाक्षिणात्यैरुदीच्यकाम्बोजशकैः खशैश्च । शाल्वैः समत्स्यैः  
कुरुमध्यदेशैर्म्लेच्छैःपुलिन्दैर्द्रविडान्ध्रकाञ्च्यैः ॥  
Reference:  
5.58.158.0.20(उद्योगपर्व>उलूकयानपर्व>अष्टपञ्चाशदधिकशततमोऽध्यायः>श्लोक#20)

6)  
पुरोगमाश्च ते सन्तुद्रविडाः सह कुन्तलैः । आन्ध्रास्तालचराश्चैव चूचुपा वेणुपास्तथा  
॥  
Reference: 5.55.138.0.25(उद्योगपर्व>कर्णोपनिवादपर्व>अष्टत्रिंशदधिकशततमोऽध्यायः  
(138)>श्लोक#25)

These are some of the references from Mahabharata (search the JNU  
Sanskrit site for more details)  
The argument that this derived from दमिल \> द्रमिल \> द्रविड (as given by  
some scholars) by way of citing its occurrence in a Cylonese chronicle  
is far fetched, because even the latest portions of Mahabharata would be  
earlier than Cylonese Mahavamsha. Considering the secondary evidence  
(from grammar), it is a fairly established phenomenon of sound change  
from Sanskrit \> Prakrit that conjuncts get simplified and -r- gets  
dropped from Sanskrit to Prakrit and modern Indian languages. Therefore  
the derivation process like dravida \> davida \> damila would be more  
logical than the one given earlier by the likes of Zvelebill, Caldwell  
and our own much revered linguist Krishnamurthy.

In fact, many of the properties of this word (if we relate it to the  
base ’द्रव) like 'prosperity', 'strength' etc can be found to be in  
agreement with various meanings assigned to the word 'आर्य' ..

On a similar note, a close comparison of Indo Aryan and Dravidian  
languages, one may find surprising similarities. The areal and  
typological similarities among Indian languages (across so called  
genealogical boundaries) are so great that one may even fancy a common  
origin for them. This has support from the genetic studies as well. The  
genetic relationship among Indians (north and south) are far more closer  
than the between North Indians and the Europeans. I wish the  
genealogists had taken into account the areal and typological features  
of Indian languages into consideration. And i also wish the awards were  
given to our own linguists like Prof Subbarao, Prof Anvita Abbi and  
others who have phenomenal knowledge on Indian languages and linguistic  
area.

It is not surprising that more and more scholars are now finding fault  
with the comparative method which created an imaginary PIE and derived  
Sanskrit from it. In one of my recent presentations, i have shown the  
absurdity in the argument by taking selective examples to prove a point,  
and have argued for a common Indic origin for India's languages.

Hope this helps

No one is denying give-and-take between Sanskrit and Tamil or any other  
languages, but what authority does Parpola have to claim Tamil origin  
for  
known sanskrit words?

Also, Tamil records, meaning inscriptions go back only about 2000 years  
at the most. Harappan seals are at least twice that old. How does he  
fill  
that huge historical gap with the fish etymology?

Parpola has been in the pay of Dravidian politicians for the long time.  
Most recently he received a Rs 20 lakh 'Classical Tamil' award for  
'proving'  
Harappan civilization to beling the creation of Old Tamils.

We can similarly claim that South Indian temples like Mahabalipuram,  
Madhurai, etc were built by Punjabis, say Sikhs from Amritsar.

If someone pays me 10 crores, I am prepared to say that Tamils built the

Pyramids of Egypt also.

The whole enterprise sounds very fishy to me.

we

etymology,

Tamil. Is

and

words
