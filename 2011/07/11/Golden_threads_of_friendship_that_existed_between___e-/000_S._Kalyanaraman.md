Gracing the southwestern corner of the Monas(Freedom Square), at the downtown central business district in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, this statue depicts Arjuna Wijaya, the charismatic archer from the Indian legend Mahabharata, with a bow and arrow, riding a chariot of six galloping horses - a scene supposedly taken from Bharata Yuda War when Arjuna defeated Karna. The monument holds great significance for the Indonesians, with some believing that the very figure opens a door to the spiritual world...  
  
“Ramayana and Mahabharata are most popular in Indonesia. They were probably translated in the 11th century during the reign of King Airlangga in the ancient Kawi language. King Airlangga was himself a great scholar and ascetic who spent many years in the jungle in meditation. Ramayana and Mahabharata are the basis of innumerable dances, plays, sculptures, paintings and music themes.”  
  
“In August 1927 when Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel prize winner arrived at Tanjung Priok harbor, he burst into a verse in the memory of the golden threads of kinship that have existed between India and Indonesia.”  
  
“In 1947, Biju Patnaik flew a private plane full of medicines to Indonesia and also rescued Mohammad Hatta and P.M. Sutan Sjahrir from the Dutch and brought them to India. In 1951 when Nehru visited Bali he said, "this is the morning of the world."  
  
“The earliest historical record is in Ujung Kulon National Park, West Java. An early Hindu archeological relic of a Ganesha statue from the 1st Century AD has been found on the summit of Mount Raksa in Panaitan Island. The next historical record is in the area of Kutai on the Mahakam River in east Kalimantan. Three rough plinths dating from the beginning of the fourth century are recorded in the Pallavi script of India. The inscription reads: "A gift to the Brahmin priests."  
  
"The famous Batu Tulis (stone writing) near Bogor in Western Java is on a huge black boulder in, around 450 A.D king Purnawarna inscribed his name and made an imprint of his footprints, as well as his elephant's footprints. The accompanying inscription reads, 'Here are the footprints of King Purnawarna, the heroic conqueror of the world'. This inscription is in Sanskrit and is still clear after 1500 years. This is the oldest archeological monument in Java. (Candi) Badut near Malang in East Java was built in A.D 760. Candi is the name of the Hindu Goddess of Time and Death. This area is literally strewn with ancient Hindu temples and even today temples are being dug out from the ground".

“During the 8th and 9th century, the world's largest Buddhist complex Borobudur and Prambanan the largest Hindu temple complex in Indonesia were built near Yogyakarta in Central Java. In the 10th Century, students were sent to Nalanda Buddhist University in N.E.India”.  
  
“The national emblem of the Republic of Indonesia"Garuda Pancasila" is adorned with the Garuda in the Indonesian history holds a place of honor. It is a symbol of national emblem with Wishnu riding it. Garuda sculpture is shown in countless temples. Garuda stands for complete devotion to Lord Vishnu and subsequent freedom from evil. Garuda also stands for the freedom of the people of Indonesia from foreign rule”.

“In Sumatra in the 12/13th Century arose the great Kingdom of Sriwijaya. However, it was during the reign of King Hayam Wuruk of the Majapahit Kingdom that the Prime Minister Gajah Mada united the entire Indonesia into a single state. It was the golden era of Indonesia.”  
  
“The national emblem of the Republic of Indonesia – “Garuda Pancasila” is adorned with the with the words Bhineka Tunggal Ika- which means Unity in Diversity. The concept of Bhineka Tunggal Ika was started during the 8th–9th centuries in Central Java to create an understanding between Hinduism and Buddhism. Classic example is Candi Shiwa - Buddha. Afterwards King Airlangga made use of it in the 11th century. However it was Mpu Tantular the court poet of the Majapahit kingdom who during the reign of King Hayam Wuruk propagated this idea of a Unity in Diversity, in his poem”.  
  
Mention must be made here of Panca Sila, the 5 basic principles of the Republic of Indonesia. They are: Faith in one God, Nationalism, Democracy, Humanity and Just Society. All over Indonesia, at Govt. places you see Garuda, the vehicle of the Hindu God Vishnu alongside with a Panca Sila plaque. Indonesians are extremely proud of their historical cultural past. Indonesia like India is secular and even one of their currency notes carries a picture of Lord Ganesha”.  
“Although there are hundreds of dialects throughout Indonesia, yet Bahasa Indonesia in roman script is understood everywhere and this is what unites them all in their outlook. Indeed “Bhineka Tunggal Ika” ‘Unity in Diversity’ stands proved through Bahasa Indonesia, which shares many common words with Sanskrit like Guru, istri, suami, putri, putra, warna, Akasha and niscaya. Bahasa Indonesia is a very artistic language. Matahari means eye of the day which means Sun.”

Indian noted writer Tagore makes return to Java at JIS  
The Jakarta Post \| Sat, 05/19/2001 2:22 PM \| Life  
  
  
By Mehru Jaffer  
  
JAKARTA (JP): As he stepped down at Jakarta's Tanjung Priok harbor in August 1927, India's poet philosopher Rabindranath Tagore burst into verse in praise of the ""golden threads of kinship that existed between Indonesia and India"".  
  
The Little Theater at the Jakarta International School in Cilandak will resonate on Saturday night as an ode is once again paid to the legendary Tagore, not just a poet but also a social reformer, educationist, composer, painter and humanist.  
  
Tagore's visit to Java and Bali were part of a series of lecture tours he organized for himself to share with the rest of Asia his romantic and idealized concept of a single eastern civilization. Most of Asia at that time was a slave of colonial masters and Tagore felt that Asia must find her voice if humanity was to be saved. The greed of western countries caused him great concern.  
  
And wherever the Calcutta-born Tagore went he attracted large crowds, for he was already world famous. W.B. Yeats wrote the introduction for the English translation of Gitanjali (Song of Offerings), which won for Tagore the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913.  
  
Over the years, the Indian poet's initial concept of a spiritual East standing aloof from a materialistic West flowered into a world ideal that he hoped would one day unify all humankind. His religion, he explained to Albert Einstein during their 1930 conversation at Einstein's home near Berlin, was in the reconciliation of the super personal man, the universal human spirit in his own individual being.  
  
Tagore advocated a worldwide commerce of heart and mind so that the individual's sense of purpose in life is enhanced. He took the initiative to contact leading thinkers in other parts of Asia. In Java one of his closest allies was Ki Hajar Dewantoro, founder of the Taman Siswa schools, and the country's first minister of education. Dewantoro was inspired by Tagore's talk of nationalism without closing the door to modernism.  
  
A literal translation of kindergarten or the garden of children, the Taman Siswa schools remain the oldest national education institutions here, started in 1932. Dewantoro was impressed with Tagore's school at Santiniketan and Viswa Bharati, the world university founded by Tagore in 1918 with all the money he received as Nobel laureate. Dewantoro, painter Affandi and Dr. Ida Bagus Mantra of Bali visited the university of universal learning which Tagore saw as a center of Indian culture and also the thread linking India to the world.  
  
The idea was to revive the traditional Indian way of teaching, in the open, under a tree, in close contact with nature. Both Tagore and Dewantoro believed that all the elements in one's own culture have to be strengthened, not to resist western culture but to accept and assimilate it, to get mastery over it and not to live at its outskirts.  
  
Tagore died in 1941 but his ideas continue to live through the works of all those who look upon all civilizations in different continents as being complementary to each other. It is in the same spirit that Abhyudaya, an Indonesia-India cultural assembly came into being half a decade ago. Since then every May is dedicated to the memory of Tagore whose birth anniversary falls this month.  
  
Chitrangada, an episode about a warrior princess from the Mahabharata which Tagore wrote as a dance-drama, was performed in the past by Indian dancer Nilanjana Ghosh along with Balinese dancers, and also Tridhara, yet another offering of Indian dance, music and song to Indonesian audiences.  
  
""As we live, work and bring up children in foreign countries it becomes our personal responsibility to keep them connected with our culture and values,"" says Aparesh Mukerjee, production manager and one of the founders of Abhyudaya.  
  
The highlight of the evening will be an excerpt from a film on Tagore made by Satyajit Ray, perhaps the greatest film maker of India and an alumnus of Santiniketan.  
  
The Performance will take place at Little Theater, the Jakarta International School, Cilandak Campus, on May 19, at 6.15 p.m. Further Inquiries at 021-7500340
