This predates the Indus Valley (or Harappan) civilization by several thousand years.



David Frawley and I have always held that Vedic culture spread from the coastal regions to the interior and north. Manu moved from Kerala to the Sarasvati valley which became established in the north. (See *Hidden Horizons* by Frawley and Rajaram.)



This also accounts for the strong maritime symbolism in the Vedas and the Puranas. So we are not in the least surprised by the supposedly 'new' findings-- in fact we anticipated them in several of our publications.
