Dear Dr Joshi:



 Change will come if young people have a say in the matter. I lecture both in India and the West (US and UK) and I am struck by the fact that the audiences in India are much older even though a good percentage of the audience in the West also is composed of young Indians.



Recently, in a talk on Quantum Reality and Vedanta that I gave in Bangalore, the person who chaired my talk was a 'distinguished' senior scientist who I could tell knew nothing that had happened in the last 30 years. He didn't know what I was talking about though it was a non-technical talk.



Best regards,

N.S. Rajaram
