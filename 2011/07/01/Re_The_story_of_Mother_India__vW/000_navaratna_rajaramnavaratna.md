Namaste Bal Ramji:



 The following article is by Susan Huntington who appears to be sensitive to Indic traditions. Note also she doesn't talk about the Aryan invasion.



 You might invite her at a suitable time.



 **Susan L Huntington is professor in art history at Ohio State University.** *Among other books, she is the author of the Art of Ancient India (Weatherhill)*



** It might be worth sendin her the programs of the Vedanta and the Origins conferences.



Best regards,

N.S. Rajaram
