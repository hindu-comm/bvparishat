Sorry. I do not entertain authorities where facts and evidence are available. Rasaa may be Ramha, but is it not mentioned just there that the locale of the PaNis was 'jaguri.h paraacai' i.e.'immensely far away and unreachable from the locale of Indra andhis retinue? The problem mustbe discussed in the light of thearchaeological findings having due regard for the textual information. Kyzilkum was the Aryan (Harappan) colony, from where they operated to exploit the mineral deposits of lapis-lazuli rich rocks of northern Afghanistan. BS``
