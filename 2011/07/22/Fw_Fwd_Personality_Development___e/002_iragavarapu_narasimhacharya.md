Dear Friends,  
The Govts at the centre and at States must be alerted first in this  
regard.No body is now  
bothered about this.The personality buildup and the character buildup  
aspects have been completely ignored.The character certificate is not  
asked for any -where for any purpose.The Education which is to mould  
the character has become now money mongered.The system has to be  
overhauled.  
Regards,  
ivnacharya.
