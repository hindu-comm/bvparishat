\<The place was known as Khwarzem (Chorasmia). Further speculation is possible but I do not like to indulge in them>



Dear D. Bhattacharya, Thanks for above reply. I am familiar with Dr. Ernst Herzfeld research.The present name of this ancient land is Uzbekistan. According to my understanding Khwarzem is the name from middle ages. If anybody has information on the ancient name (Sanskrit related)of this land, please share your knowledge with us. Thanks. Dear Dr. Bhattacharya, Please send to me email version (if available) of your papers on this subject. It is always pleasure to exchange views with you. Thanks again. N.R.Joshi.
