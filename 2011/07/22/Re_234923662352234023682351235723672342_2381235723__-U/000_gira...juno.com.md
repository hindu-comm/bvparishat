Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Back to Aryans !



I respect views of both Dr.Bhagwan Singh and Dr. D. Bhattacharya. To the best of my knowledge nobody has discovered that pristine, dialect free language, the mother of all Indo-European languages as Dr. Bhagwan Singh stated. At the same time we cannot ignore close linguistic relationship of the ancient Indians with the ancient Persians. So the observations of Dr. D. Bhattacharya are also correct. And in free Indian society everybody has right to present his views without fear of any other views. Having said this, I will greatly appreciate if Dr. D. Bhattacharya will kindly illuminate usby suggestingpossible location (or locations) of ancient residence of undivided Aryan family according to his understanding. I am fully familiar with ancient history of all nations from Finland to Afghanistan. All over Asia there was presence of Aryans in the ancient time. This is unsolved puzzle. I repeatedly suggested on this list, that when European scholars come to India for conferences, please ask them questions about presence of Indo-Aryans in their countries in the ancient times. Instead Dravidians want to get glorified by talks of Dr. Parpola from Finland and non-Dravidians would like to get glorified by talks of Dr. Kazanas. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

It is not a point of the cradle land. It is a point of racial and linguistic approaches. Your approach appears to be racial. The basic tenet of linguistic family, that is, existence of a dialect free language has not neen met as yet. Instead theyinvented 'nostratic'. I do not go in merits and demerits of this thesis which was itself sidelined, but the fact remains that language isnot a genetic outcome, but a social product. We must start thinking rather than exchanging our classnotes.
