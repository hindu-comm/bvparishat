Traditionally it is believed and observed in Orthodox families across Andhra Pradesh -- for good pronunciation avoid ---  
onions , all kinds of meat and other TAmasAhAra . They blunt the tongue . For details refer to Caraka and Susruta .  
Raw Kapittha (Kaith - Hindi) , curd etc temporarily affect the SvarapetikA .  
  
If the student is not trained - right from childhood - the Sanskrit Alphabet then also - after certain age - it will become difficult to pronounce certain letters . People of some states pronounce 'nasan' for Nation etc.  
  
If the child is studying other subjects , it is better to ask him to perform Sandhyavandanam and learn Bhagavadgita etc to have good pronunciation .
