Dear members of bvparishat  
Distance Education offered by RSS.  
Is it controlled from Sanskrit Academy, Osmania University, Hyderabad?  
In the Eligibility fro Acharya, why only a person who has passed  
Shastri will be eligible? There are many students doing B.A with  
Sanskrit honours in general colleges. Will they not be eligible to do  
Acharya in Sanskrit.  
How is the reverse possible? A person after doing Shastri can do M.A,  
in Sanskrit in any Indian University.
