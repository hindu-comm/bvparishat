Thanks you sir.The reference is from Geeta Press Edition. 

  

Next to वाल्मीकि, भरत names संस्कृतम् and प्राकृतम्, in the context of वागभिनय and explains both in detail and their application in नाट्य from Ch.15-18. An abridged grammar of Prakrit Language, is also appended which is the fore-runner of Bhamaha and even Chanda, the early grammarians of Prakrit, whose works are available.  
  

Dandin, explains

  

संस्कृतं नाम दैवी वाग् अन्वाख्याता महर्षिभिः।

  

which reminds us the popular line:

  

देवीं वाचमजनयन्त देवाः, तां विश्वरूपाः पशवो वदन्ति।

  

and calls the same as संस्कृतम् variety of वाङ्मयम् - वागेव वाङ्मयम्, स्वार्थे मयट्। Hence can be certainly be taken as the name of the language in which the description of the महाकाव्य and its components follows in his text are composed and are applicable.
