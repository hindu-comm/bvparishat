In classical literature, Valmiki, honored as आदिकवि, has used this term संस्कृत in the sense of Language spoken by Brahmins:  
  
Aranyakanda Ch.11sloka56/57  
  
इहैकदा किल क्रूरो वातापिरपि चेल्वल: /  
  
भ्रातरौ सहितावास्तां ब्राह्मणघ्नौ महासुरौ /  
  
धारयन् ब्राह्मणं रूपंइल्वल:संस्कृतंवदन् //  
  
  
Sundarakanda Ch.30Sloka17and18  
  
अहं त्वतितनुश्चैव वानरश्च विशेषत: /  
  
वाचं चोदाहरिष्यामि मानुषीमिह संस्कृताम् //  
  
यदि वाचं वदिष्यामिद्विजातिरिवसंस्कृताम् /  
  
रावणं मन्यमाना सा सीता भीता भविष्यति /

  

If one wants the above references can be interpreted as "refined speech" or sophisticated speech. But it is open for discussion, whether it means in the above context the name of the language to day we cal संस्कृतम् or not.

  

Certainly,

  

In नाट्यशास्त्र , and other works on काव्यमीमांसा, it is definitely used for the language called संस्कृत today, along with the two other varities or more regional dialects related to Sanskrit as such, प्राकृत, and अपभ्रंश, which do not include Veda-s under the literature classified as प्राकृत. Here too scholars differ in the use of the term प्राकृत., प्रकृतिः संस्कृतम्, तत्र भवम् प्राकृतम्, is one view and the other, प्रकृतिरेव प्राकृतम्, स्वार्थे अण्, but in either definition, वेद-s are not included in those texts on rhetorics. Anyhow, वेद-s are not subjected to study by these authors, as they were concerned with classical literature and their study is limited to it. The मीमांसा and न्याय shastra-s though deal with speech in general, they are not concerned with classification and categorization as their main object is the function of the लौकिक and वैदिक sentences taken as granted the classification. as done by व्याकरणशास्त्र. अथ शब्दानुशासनम्। केषां शब्दानाम्? लौकिकानाम्, वैदिकानां च" as we find it in महाभाष्य.  
  

This is my limited knowledge of these two words. Much more can be expected from the learned scholars of this group.
