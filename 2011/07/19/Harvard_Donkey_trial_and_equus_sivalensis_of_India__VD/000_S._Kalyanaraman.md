### Harvard Donkey trial and *equus sivalensis* of India which debunks the AIT horse import theory

Harvard Donkey trial and *equus sivalensis* of India which debunks the AIT horse import theory  
  
Sottovoce: Harvard Donkey Trial is another name for the CAPEEM lawsuit argued in a California court in the context questioning reliance on AIT theory in California Textbooks. A Harvard argument was that what was referred to as horse in ancient texts of India was in fact a donkey.

Twenty Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Animal Industry for the Year 1910 (Feb. 10, 1912) United States Bureau of Animal Industry  
  
Here are some key excerpts from the report which should set AIT Arabian horse-import into India proponents to rethink and examine the possibility that references to horses in the Rigveda may refer to *equus sivalensis* type of horses (NOT donkeys as shown in the Harvard Donkey Trial). Note: Note: It is likely that the tonga-s found on the village streets on the foothills of Siwalik ranges are in fact carts drawn by the species of small types of *equus sivalensis.*  
  
Excerpts:  
  
In a paper published in 1904: on The Multiple Origin of Horses and Ponies,^ I recognized three distinct types of horses, viz, the Prejvalsky, Celtie, and Norse types. In 1907 I pointed out that these three types might be known as the " steppe," " plateau," and " forest " types,' and in 1909 added the " Siwalik " type to include horses allied to  
*Equus sivalensis* of the Indian Pliocene deposits.\* (p.163)  
  
Up to the end of last century it was generally taken for granted that in all the modern horses the face is nearly in a line with the cranium, that horses with short-pillared molars have long been extinct, and that the broad cannon (metacarpal and metatarsal) bones  
of Shires and Clydesdales are the product of artificial selection. Now, however, it is realized (1) that though in some modem breeds the face is short and in a line with the cranium, in others it is long and so strongly bent downward that it forms, as in the Baringo zebra, an angle of nearly 20° with the cranium; (2) that in some fossil Pleistocene horses the cannon bones are relatively as short and broad as in Shires and Clydesdales, and (3) that in some modern horses the internal pillar of the molars is as short as in the oldest true horse hitherto discovered — ^the *Equus sivalensis* of the Siwalik hills of northern India. The only horse skulls from the Pleistocene deposits of Europe, sufficiently well preserved to admit of the relation of the face to the cranium being accurately determined, are those found in the grottoes of Grimaldi near Mentone, and the only well-preserved Pliocene horse skulls hitherto found in Asia belong to *Equus sivalensis* of India. But notwithstanding the absence of well preserved skulls it has been possible by making use of new methods to obtain a considerable amount of evidence in support of the view that domestic horses had a multiple origin, that they include amongst their ancestors not only varieties allied to the wild horse which still survives in Mongolia, and varieties adapted for a forest life, but also varieties specialized for ranging over boundless deserts and plateaus, and for living amongst foothills and upland valleys.(p.165)  
  
Bearing all these facts in mind, it may be provisionally assumed that *Equus silvalensis* of India was a tall, broad-browed horse characterized by a long, tapering deflected face and an interorbital prominence, a long neck, high withers, and a high-set-on tail. As Arabs and Indian horses with a prominence between the eyes are usually fleet but of an uncertain temper, it is extremely probable that *Equus sivalensis* belonged to a fleet race characterized by an indomitable disposition. (p.174)

The multiple origin of horses and ponies (1904) by J. Cossar Ewart Nature, Volume 69, Issue 1799, pp. 590-596 (1904). DOI: 10.1038/069590a0

Abstract  
Now that systematic attempts are being made to improve native breeds of horses in various parts of the world, it is obviously desirable to settle once for all whether, as is alleged, occidental as well as oriental and African races and breeds have sprung from the same wild progenitors, and more especially if all ponies are merely dwarf specimens of one or more of the recognised domestic breeds of horses. To be in a position to arrive at a conclusion as to the origin of the various kinds of domestic horses, and at the same time find an answer to the important and oft-repeated question, What is a pony?
