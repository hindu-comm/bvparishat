 The whole of the no horse' argument was a Red Herring anyway, a diversionary tactic to conceal the collapse of the AIT behind a mask of personal attacks.



 At the recent Origins symposium which had speakers from Europe, U.K., as well as U.S. and India, no one talked about the horse. None of the AIT stalwarts showed up in spite of the invitation. Probably for that reason, the discussions were literate and civilized.



 (We had good Harvard participation at the Vedanta and Foundations of Science symposium that just preceded it, where latest developments were presented. Understandably, there was no mention of the horse; the focus was mainly on duality and reality in Vedanta and quantum physics.)



 The horse debate now belongs to natural history as it should-- when and where horse was domesticated. This happened long before the ending of the last Ice Age. Last February, I was invited to a Workshop in Delhi that included archaeologists like R.S. Bisht as well as geneticists (including Oppenheimer of Oxford).



 The curious thing is that European linguists themselves, at least some sane ones, are acknowledging the limitations of their methodology. They admit it cannot be used to make statements about migrations, invasions and/or other historical issues. There was some mirth at my identification of IE-PIE homeland as the linguistic departments.  

 We are making inroads into school curricula also judging by the response of participants at a teachers training workshop where I made a presentation on the Vedic Harappans.



 The latest underwater findings off the Konkan coast also support our views of the maritime origins.



 Let us not waste any more time debating these people and get on with the real work. I am focusing on two books-- one onnatural history background to the Vedic and the other on Vedanta and Quantum Mechanics.



 Western Indology is dying, with students becoming unemployable. Don't waste time arguing with them. Focus on changing the curriculum in India. A good beginning has been made with the rout of DMK in Karunanidhi. Parpola's prostituting himself in full public view by taking money from Karunanidhi has hardly helped their cause.



 A lot of new findings are coming our way. Let us use them properly and built a credible alternative.
