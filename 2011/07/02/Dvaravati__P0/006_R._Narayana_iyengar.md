Dear Scholars, Namaste!  
Location of Dvaraka/Dvaravati is an important question. I feel this is  
yet to be settled satisfactorily. In my studies I find there is a  
strong case for Krishna's Dvaraka having been nearer to the town of  
Paat.an. in Mehsana district of Gujarat. Please see the detailed  
reasoning in the attached publication in the Journal of the Geological  
Society of India.

kind regards

RN Iyengar
