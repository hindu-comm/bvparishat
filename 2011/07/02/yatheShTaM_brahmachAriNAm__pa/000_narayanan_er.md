Respected Scholars,  
  
I have forgotten the source of a quotation from a commentary to the Jaiminiya Sutras, as quotation is as follows :  
  
अष्टौ ग्रासा मुनेर्भक्ष्याः षोडशारण्यवासिनाम्।  
द्वात्रिंशच्च गृहस्थानां यथेष्टं ब्रह्मचारिणाम् ।।  


I could desperately had any access to this verse in the Bhattadipika as well. I think it might be from some other commentaries and one of them, I am sure, which discuss a context with श्येनेनाभिचरन् यजेत etc. and prior to this the said verse is quoted. So,  
1. I request our esteemed scholars' help to identify the name of the commentary.  
2. What is approximate volume of a ग्रास according to ancient system ?  
  
Regards,  
Narayanan
