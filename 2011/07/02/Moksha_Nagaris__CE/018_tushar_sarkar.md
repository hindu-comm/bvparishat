Respected Scholars,  
 I was reading with interest the postings on 'moksha nagaris'. Found Dr. Jadu Moharir'sobservations on the topic very sensible and un-romanticallyrational. If we accept his view then the so-called 7 or 8 'moksa nagaris' can be regarded as ancient/Indian counterpartsof the 'Ivy League' Universities in the USA. I (and many of my friends) did their Masters/Ph.D's from various good universities in North America\[nearly four decades ago whenalmost allhad getfull scholarships, as no foreign exchange would normallybe allowed for study abroadby the then Govt. of India rules\]. I never had the impression thatour IIT's are any less in academic standing compared to any universityin the States. All the IIT students I knew came with full scholarships.I fail to understand why today any Indan student would die to get a US degree, incurring such enormous amounts of expenditure. May be they have money to burn or else, we as a nation are suffering from a sort of inferiority complex. Namaskar.  
 Tushar Sarkar.
