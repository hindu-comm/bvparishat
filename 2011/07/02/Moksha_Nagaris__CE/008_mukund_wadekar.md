If Puri is taken in the general sense of Town., the seven number is clear. The source and the antiquity of the verse is yet to searched out. The Mayapuri is Hardwar. and dvaravati is dvaraka in Gujarat. There is no doubt Importance of Puri as Moksanagari, but this specific verse may not be referring to it.
