Panis and Phoenicians!



Dear Dr, Bhagwan Singh, Thanks for giving us information. Now the location of land of Panis is controversial.If I understand you correctly, you bringing our attention to the mention of the land of Panisbeing far away from the locale of Indra and his retinue. Some scholars are of the opinion that the ancient Phoenicians were Panis. Phoenicians were traders par excellence in the ancient world and controlling the international trade from their land on the coast of Asia Minor. Romans who wanted to control trade of India had three wars with Phoenicians. These wars in Roman history are known as Punic wars. The word Punic is also suggestive of Panis. The land of Phoenicians was certainly far away from locale (assumed here as ancient Khwarism) of Indra. On the other hand some other scholars are of the opinion the land of Panis was somewherefromKhwarism to Sindh. In this situation it would be of great help if we find direction of Sarama's travel-towards west or towards east from theancient landof Indra. Is there reference to this effect? Please anybody else has any knowledge, reference, please let us know. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Sorry. I do not entertain authorities where facts and evidence are available. Rasaa may be Ramha, but is it not mentioned just there that the locale of the PaNis was 'jaguri.h paraacai' i.e.'immensely far away and unreachable from the locale of Indra andhis retinue? The problem mustbe discussed in the light of thearchaeological findings having due regard for the textual information. Kyzilkum was the Aryan (Harappan) colony, from where they operated to exploit the mineral deposits of lapis-lazuli rich rocks of northern Afghanistan. BS``
