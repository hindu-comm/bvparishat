Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Let us desensitize the issue of history of Ancient India!



Dear Dr, Bhagwan Singh, Thanks for raising question



\<What Shintasta meanfrom which the Andronovo people (the Aryans)are shown to be advancing towards India (by Prpola and thier likes) and why towards India alone?>



Both Dr. Parpola and Dr. Kazanas are telling the half story to people of India because they know lovers of half stories are in Indian population. The story will be completed when they will tell us who migrated to their respective own countries from Asiain the ancient time and why? In order to bring out the truth of the ancient history of India and Asia, we need to desensitize this issue. Taking positions prematurely on the issue do not promote impartial research. In the same way presenting the ancient history of India as the history of Kuru-Bharata tribes only (as in O.P.Bharadwaja book) does not serve the purpose. Shrikant Talgeri in one of his books says history of Purus (concentrated in Northwest of the subcontinent)is not the history of the whole India. There were thousands of tribes in the ancient India other than Purus. In this context I feel we have not explored the ancient history of the southern India fully. In the Old Testament there are Tamil words. South India's trade was going with Jewish king Soloman. There must be trade agreement written between them.Who were kings in Kerala in 1000 BC who signed trade agreements with Soloman and in what language? I am looking for answers to this questions. Please share with us any information you have in this regard so we can improve our understanding. Thanks. NRJOSHI.

We should not quote authorities. We must place facts and logic to support our contention. Dr. Bhattacharya being more knowledgeble than me must be aware that the term Arya denoted prosperious, master and the 'class' owning property, deemed to be ideals being more civilised. Briefly, Aryans were like seTha- shreSth, saahu-saadhu, and were model of their siciety. Their language, the traders language - and their fortified habitations as attested in Dashly, Sapally and Kurgan culture were originally dubbed as aaryan and aaryaanaa. That creates confusion as we have numerous locations claiming to be habitat of Aryans.
