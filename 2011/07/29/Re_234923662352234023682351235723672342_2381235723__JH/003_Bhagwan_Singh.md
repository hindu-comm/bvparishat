Dear Joshi ji,

We must be very clear when we geographically locate a people. There are many opinions, and many theories are evasive arguments of those who are confused. Hypotheses can not replace factual position which is the point of convegence point of multipolar evidence. When clueless we build hypotheses, when we come to a finding allhypotheses are set aside. So let us locate Indra. The Dasas and Vritras are invariably identified and addressed as people ofhills/mountains. Indra and his hosts must be residing in plains otherwise this epithetfor the formers does not carry any meaning. His votaries inhabit the Sarasvati Valley. This Sarasvati has as its tributaries -Apayaa, and DrSadvati. The inhabtants of this area were settlers comingfrom north-east that is aparaajitaa disha or Aishanii dishaa (as per BrahmaNas. This is also borne out by the reference in the RVwhere it is said that having found it the bestlocale the Bharata's set up Agni here. Settling of Agni or movement of Agni, and in a solitary referencedisappearance of Agni is symbolic way of telling the habitaion, movement and disappearnce of the Fire worshippers. The country of PaNis (Northern Afghanistan in which Harappans had set up their colony at Kyzil Kum) was accessible to votaries of Indra after crossing numerous rivers and scaling difficult terrains, the most difficult being Rasaa which may or may not be Ranhaa. I guess it to be Kokcha ancient Kokanada.

As for Phoenicians they had migrated to Mediterrnean coast around2500 BC, after having suffered a long spell of tremers in their original habitat. Archaeology of Dholavira, southern Pakistan and even some Vedic references confirm that Gurarat and Sindha, at least, had suffered badly around the same tme. It may be guessed that they could have been earlier inhabiting coastal belt and had been expert navigators at that stage itself. I have not made deeper studies about them but they appear to have never been challenged by anyone before the Romans overthrew them and burnt their prosperous Carthage.But within the limit range of my knowledge I do not concord to their identification with PaNis or VaNiks despite hponetic congruence. The identification of Hillebrandt holds good in case of PaNis, but bot in case of Sarasvati which must be at a very long distance from the home of the PaNis who find their mention in Avesta' Greek records and Chinese sources as well as hostile tribes.

Incidently, while placingtribes we may also note that they have been changing their locus even in historical times. In RV the maruts are shown returning home after crossing the rivers of Punab \_ journey mentioned west to east.Incidentally, have you ever the occasion to read The Vedic Harappans, authored by me. There these aspects have been discussed in some detail. ``

Panis and Phoenicians!



Dear Dr, Bhagwan Singh, Thanks for giving us information. Now the location of land of Panis is controversial.If I understand you correctly, you bringing our attention to the mention of the land of Panisbeing far away from the locale of Indra and his retinue. Some scholars are of the opinion that the ancient Phoenicians were Panis. Phoenicians were traders par excellence in the ancient world and controlling the international trade from their land on the coast of Asia Minor. Romans who wanted to control trade of India had three wars with Phoenicians. These wars in Roman history are known as Punic wars. The word Punic is also suggestive of Panis. The land of Phoenicians was certainly far away from locale (assumed here as ancient Khwarism) of Indra. On the other hand some other scholars are of the opinion the land of Panis was somewherefromKhwarism to Sindh. In this situation it would be of great help if we find direction of Sarama's travel-towards west or towards east from theancient landof Indra. Is there reference to this effect? Please anybody else has any knowledge, reference, please let us know. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
