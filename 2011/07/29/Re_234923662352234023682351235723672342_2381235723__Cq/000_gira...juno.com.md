Dear Prof. Narang, Thanks for the reply and information on Usanas. I may not be able to get your paper here in USA. Please kindly let us know what is the custom of Siappa.Was it common to north India and land of Usanas? Was Usanas connected with Ushana kavi? There were Kavi families in ancient Iran. Even today Paarasi families have names like Kavi Khusro, Kavi Kabaad etc. Thanks again. N.R.Joshi
