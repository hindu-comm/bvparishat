Dear Shri Shobhan Ganji,  
I have replied to a question on the etymology of the Sanskrit term MEENA to Dr. N. R. Joshi in the following way, a few days ago (on Mon, 4 July, 2011) :  
The term मीनः is in masculine gender from the root मीञ् हिंसायाम् with a suffix नक् supported by the Unadi rule 3.3 फेनमीनौ, and the derivation will be मीयते हिंस्यते इति मीनः। Amarasimha gives a lexical support to this as मत्स्यः (1-10-17). Why it is in masculine gender ? The Panini Linganushasana says : नोपधः, the syllable न् as the penultimate one to the अ ending like इनः, फेनः etc.  
The terms MEENAM & MEEN (both used for fish-singular) is used in Tamil and Malayalam. I don't know the Tamil etymology of the term.  
There are different approaches in perceiving knowledge in India and the West. The Amarakosha of Amarasimha is a Sanskrit Lexicon but not a Tamil one. There are sincere people in the West too, but there will be deliberate attempts to topple the system of traditional learning, with a pretext that the traditional learning has almost been vanished in India. The great Max Muller though learned Vedas and Classical literature, but too failed establish his predominant fundamental thinkings on own Semitic religion upon the well-learned Indians. Irrespective of Jains, Buddhists, Yajnikas or any group in India were thoroughly trained in Sanskrit & Indian culture with the oral tradition in the past. That tradition cannot be erased from the society very easily.  
We are still the victims of colonialism since the seventeenth century, but no need of panic. There is a minority of younger generation in India, with the blessings of old and respected well learned scholars, are learning Sanskrit traditionally irrespective of their caste and creed, with a great sign ahead unchallengeable by any force in the world. The moto is: commitment, dedication, hard work to learn the treasure and culture by keeping the morality and ethics intact. I am sure Sanskrit and culture will be protected at any cost at least in India.



Regards,  
Narayanan
