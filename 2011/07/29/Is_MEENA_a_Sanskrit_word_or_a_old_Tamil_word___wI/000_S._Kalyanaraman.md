**Is MEENA a Sanskrit word or a old Tamil word ?**

**  
**

  
From various sources it can be safely said that this word is definitely a Sanskrit word and it is borrowed into old Tamil and other dravidian languages. This allegation by some Indologists who are deciphering Indus script that MEENA is only found in Dravidian languages is quite fraudulent.  
  
Below we will present reference to this word in Puranas and the etymology of this word.

The confirmation on the**Mina**Rashi's elements of constellation was on the basis of a conversation between Narada and Pulastya in the Vamana Purana.  
  
धनिष्ठार्द्धं शतभिषा प्रोष्टपदांशकत्रयम्। सौरं पद्मापरमिदं कुम्भो जङ्घे च  
विश्रुते॥  
प्रोष्ठपदांशमेकन्तु उत्तरा रेवती तथा। द्वितीयं जीवसदनं**मीनन्तु**  
चरणावुभौ॥........................  
इति श्रीवामनपुराणे पुलस्त्यनारदसंवादे हरललितः पञ्चमोऽध्यायः॥  
  
  
"The term मीनः is in masculine gender from the root मीञ् हिंसायाम् with a suffix नक् supported by the Unadi rule 3.3**फेनमीनौ**, and the derivation will be मीयते हिंस्यते इति मीनः मत्स्य: । Amarasimha gives a lexical support to this as मत्स्यः (1-10-17). Why it is in masculine gender ? The Panini Linganushasana says : नोपधः, the syllable न् as the penultimate one to the अ ending like इनः, फेनः etc.  
  
The term also used to represent the last Rashi starting from Mesha ( अन्त्यभम् ). It says : मेषादिद्वादशराश्यन्तर्गतान्तिमराशिः। It includes the the last one (or three??) fourth of Purvabhaadrapadaa, Uttarabhaadrapadaa and Revati. Two female fish are appearing to represent the fundamental goddess of this Rashi. I doubt that is it the one fourth of Purvabhaadrapadaa or three fourth of Purvabhaadrapadaa??. I hope the astronomers will pardon me if my learning is wrong. "**
