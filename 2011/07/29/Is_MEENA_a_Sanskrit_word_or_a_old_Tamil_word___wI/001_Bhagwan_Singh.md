It is not easy to tell in caseof quite a large number of words whether they are Sanaskrit or non Sanskritic which includes Dravidian and Mundari and even some extinct languages. You find them deeply imbedded down to colloquial level. These terms may better be called Indic. So with miina. There is a string of words mn, mana, manu, E. man,moon, and Skt. miina with semantic core 'to shine' going back to etyma mn=water. To which source theis last one belonged we can not be sure. Elaboration is not warranted. As Caldwell had very emphatically said terms relationg to sciences, arts, philosophyetc. have been borrowed by Dravidian from the Aryan. The term which refers to a constllation as well, is definitly a borrowing in Dravidian from Sanskrit. The etymology from a given root may be suspect but not the fact that it is most likely to be Sanskrit. Min, minati = to injure, to killetc. have`` another semantic source.
