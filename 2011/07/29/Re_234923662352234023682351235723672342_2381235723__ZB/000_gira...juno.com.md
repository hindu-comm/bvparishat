Respected Scholars Namaskar!



I would like to thank Dr. Narayan E.R. and Dr. Kalyanraman for helping us to settle the issue of Sanskrit word Meena. Two years ago I asked the question on BVparishat, "Is there a book or research which explains systematically how sounds from Sanskrit words change in Tamil words, in other words were the laws similar to Grimm's rule etc invented between Sanskrit and Tamil? I know that certain number of Sanskrit words were accepted in Tamil as they are but certain other Sanskrit words undergo systematic sound changes in Tamil. To the best of my knowledge Tamil has less number of VarNas relative to Sanskrit (please correct me if I were wrong). That also need to be taken into consideration. Both languages are very old in the subcontinent. It is also true that origin of certain Sanskrit words from UNaadi sootras is difficult to guess. If I am correct UNaadu sootras offer etymological speculations of certain Sanskrit words instead of etymological derivations. Please correct me if I were wrong. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
