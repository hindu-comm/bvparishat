One has not only to read a text but read it critically to arrive at the germinal essence. See that Hartzafeld writes about the 'al-aual' of Iranian mythical history who reached there with all the knowledge of arts and sciences. Something similar to the Sumerians who also reached Southern Iraq with similar competence. Now we shall have to look for a civilised people and civilizational zones none of which is found anywhere but India - note that Harappan civilization was typically Indian and it had reached its maturity at the foundation stage of Indus cities. Its formative period is Sarasvat Pradesh where Bhirrana, KuNaal, etc. much antidate acknowledged Harappan phase. It was a composite culture.

Note again in Hertzfeld the Naotaras arriving with new knolwdge and Navagvas in the RV goind from Vedic domain. (Don't mind spelling and structural slips in my responses``. I do not recheck as a habit.)

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
