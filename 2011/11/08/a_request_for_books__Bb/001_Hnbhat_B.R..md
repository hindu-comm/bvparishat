Here is the link to download Prabandhachintamani of Merutunga:

  

<http://www.4shared.com/document/AEml40Ia/Prabandha_Chintamani_of_Merutu.html>

  

You can download Prabandha kosha also from this Jainlibrary site:

  

<http://www.jainelibrary.org/book.php?file=016085>

  

and

  

<http://www.jainelibrary.org/book.php?file=002648>

  

by registering yourself you can download both the books directly from the site.. I have downloaded all the three. The last one seems to be in two parts and may not be complete.
