With regards,  

What do you mean by New edition? whether all the volumes of New Catalogus Catalogorum are published ? Last three volumes are yet to be printed. Up to vol 39 till the entry सुहोदित was published in 2015.  
You can ask to [directorpubl...@gmail.com]() or the Registrar of University of Madras about the status.
