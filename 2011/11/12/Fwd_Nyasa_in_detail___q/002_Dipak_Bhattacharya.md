Dear Ghanapāṭhiji,

Unfortunately I am not aware of texts in Malayalam or English. There must be some discussions among the works of Sir Arthur Avalon.

Among Sanskrit works in Devanagari the *Śāradātilaka* with the *Padārthādarśa* might help. The matters come up also in the Śāktānandataraṅgiṇī by Brahmānanda Giri ed. PañcānanaŚāstrī, published in the Bengali script Calcutta, 1349 (Bengali Era).

Traditionally the teachings are handed down in the guru-śiṣya or family line so that practitioners find it difficult to refer to books though they themselves perform the act without fault. Also, I am afraid, traditional *sādhakas* may avoid a forum to discuss matters of personal practice. There are sectarian restrictions. But the nityasandhyā manuals available in every script and major language at least mention when to perform the aṅga- and karanyāsas.

There must be other books but I have consulted only the two books mentioned above and the nityasandhyāpaddhatis. The two books were consulted long ago and that too as a PhD scholar.

There must be more knowledgeable persons in the Parishad who can inform better.

Best

DB
