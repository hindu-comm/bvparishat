Mr. Iyengar's suggestion seems to be feasible. 100 years is the approximate life time of human being in Kali Age according to AgnipurANa cited in my post earlier and the same is corroborated with the statement from Mahabhashya cited by Prof. Korada. There may be exceptional cases, more or less by the margin of some years and the margin of 25 days or night would be precise calculation of approximate 100 years said in general. 364+ days a year. ... or so would become margin of the said figure. There may be exceptional cases, on the calculation of Dasa-s in each case:
