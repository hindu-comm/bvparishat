Dear Mr Iyengar ji,

Namaste.Thanks for the researched article on the historicity of Krishna.In my note I stated "s'rUyate".This could be due to the belief that Krishna was a [pUr.napuru.sa](http://pUr.napuru.sa) and he lived the fullest life span which is mentioned as 120 years.Is it Garga Samhitaa or some other source which has also the details of the life of Krishna,I have to find out.

What baffles me is the mention of 'extra five nights' over and above 120 years.Has this any sanctity in any work on astrology ? I remember the mention of 58 nights in the MBh Anu. Pa. that Bhi.sma was on the bed of arrows.Earlier I noted that in astrology two distinct views are adopted on human life span as 108 and 120 yrs.What goes into having such perception is general observation and speculation or something deeper is yet to be known.

I remember seer Aayu.skaama in AV : maa puraa jaraso m.rthaa.h ! But when does this *jaraa* routinely sets in is mostly a cultural belief.Some take JarA who put an end to Krishna's physical existence as symbolic of old age *'jaraa' !*

Best regards,

SMMishra
