Pranams to Scholars!  
The progressive discussion on the age of Sri Krishna is very interesting. Hence I too would like to place before you a few my thoughts for relishing and rumination.  
Though I cannot immediately give I am sure that there are internal evidences in the Mahabharata itself regarding the age of Lord Sri Krishna. As it has been mentioned by Sri RN Iyengar ji and all other scholars Lord Sri Krishna lived for 120 years. At the time of Sri Krishna's Niryana, Arjuna also was 120 years old. Both were equal aged.  
  
Another interesting thing is that 120 years span is middle age and not old age at the time of Mahabharata. Among the warriors of the Mahbharata war there were some warriors of 200 years age also. It seems 200 years is old age during that time. If we take the instance of Bhagadatta, the son of Narakasura and the ruler of Pragjotisha pura, we can get lot of information in this regard. On the fourteenth day of Mahabharata war Bhagadatta was killed by Arjuna. This incident of killing Bhagadatta was very interesting one.  
While Arjuna was fighting with the sapta maharathins Bhurisrvas, Bhuridatta and others Bhima was approaching Arjuna to assist him. At that time Bhagadatta mounting on a Demon-Elephant of Supratika clan attacked Bhima.  
That elephant was attacking Bhima. Bhima was running around the foot of the elephant to save himself. Arjuna was alerted by Krishna. Arjuna hurled few powerful Arthachandra Banas and cut the trunk and legs of the elephant. Bhagadatta got angry and hurled a Visesha Narayana Shakti on Arjuna. This Narayana Shakti was given by Varahaswami on the request of Bhudevi to Narakasura as soon as he was born. Narakasura handed over it to Bhagadatta. Bhagadatta has now used it on Arjuna. Sri Krishna knows that there is irresistible by any other astra. . So stood up in between Arjuna and that Astra. That Narayana Shakti assumed the form of a garland and adorned the neck of Lord Sri Krishna. Then Krishna asked Arjuna to kill Bhagadatta.  
Here the trickery fight of Arjuna is admiring. Bhagadatta was a great warrior. His arrows were very powerful. He gave a very tough fight. Then Arjuna keenly observed. Bhagadatta was having golden Pakshma Sutras.
Usually it was the fashion and need of the old people of those days to use Pakshma Sutras. The eyelashes of old people of those times were said to have no power to open comfortably. So they used to make a hole each to both the eyelashes and insert a golden string through the holes to hold up the eyelashes tying the other end of the string to the ears.
Bhagadatta also used those Pakshma Sutras to hold up his eyelashes. Having known this Arjuna first cut the two Pakshma Sutras with two arrows. When the eyelashes fell down and the eyes of Bhagadatta were closed Arjuna using a powerful arrow killed the enemy. At the time of his death Bhagadatta was 200 years old. There were many other warriors of 200+ years age participated in the Mahabharata war.  
This description is available in the Mahabharta. From this incident it can be understood that 200 years us the normal old age during the Mahabharta times. References can be had from the Mahabharata. As I could not have the Mahabharata text readily with me I could not give the textual support for this. Soon I shall try to add.  
With warm regards to all,
