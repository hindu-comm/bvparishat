The Vajikarana Prakriya and The Svastha Vritta of Ayurveda will surely extend our longevity. There are many contemporary examples for this.
Sir Mokshagudam Visheshvaraiah , the Architect of Modern Indian Technology, lived for 108 years. Just 10days ago Shri Bhadrakali Ganesh Rao the renovator of the Famous Bhadrakali Temple of Warrangal has passed away at the age of 110 years.  
My own Grandfather Sri Sri Sri Paripurna Prakasananda Bharati Mahaswami attained Brahmatva at the age of 105years. He was the founder principal of the Government Ayurvedic College, Vijayawada, Andhra pradesh. He was an expert in Rasavidya.  

There are many more living examples in our surroundings who have crossed 100+ years of age and living very happily even today.
