Namaste!  
Unless the author of the 'shabdamala' defines his 'varsha' it would  
not be possible to discuss how the extra 25 day/nights come in. My  
tentative guess will be as follows: The year was originally taken to  
be the nominal year with 365 days. But actually the solar year was  
known to him to be 365 and quarter day long. Hence after 100 nominal  
years an extension of 25 day/nights had to be granted. Life period is  
known (by observations) to be a statistical quantity. Hence 100 would  
be a most likely value of the elderly population. I feel this is how  
the Vedic texts also are to be understood. Theoretically there may be  
no upper limit. Again like other natural events (floods, wind speed  
extreme values) some people live beyond (statistical) expectations. We  
do read in the news papers some one to be 108, 110, 130,...
