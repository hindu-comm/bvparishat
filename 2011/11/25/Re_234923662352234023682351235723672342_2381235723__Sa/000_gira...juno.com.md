Dear Dr. V. Pandurangi, I am sorry I forgot to cut the lower part of posting. I will take care of that next time. .

Since Dr. Bhattacharya brought the subject of fonts,I have one question about fonts used in India. I am writing a paper in English. It has Sanskrit words written using Roman (English) letters. For that we need a font which will produce letters with diacritical marks. For a party in India in order to see those diacritical marks properly, what font should I use? What is commonly available on computers of scholars who use Sanskrit in Roman script? I used recently "Arial Unicode MS" font. Is that available commonly? In the past I used Arialnew font and mailed font folder along with soft copy of the paper. The party in India installed font on his computer and he had no problem in seeing diacritical marks. Some font files are small and some are very long. Please help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Dr.Joshi uses a Unicode non-compliant font. For those whose computers do not have the same non-Unicode font installed with them Unicode will display them as per its code which will be unintelligible to them and to most of us. To overcome the problem a Unicode font is advised.
