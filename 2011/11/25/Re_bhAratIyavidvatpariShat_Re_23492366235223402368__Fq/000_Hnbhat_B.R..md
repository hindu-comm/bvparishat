But I think it is not the problem with the fonts. In the message text we can read the same fonts and if it is with the subject line with the diacritical mark, diacritic mark can be avoided in the subject line. The same numbers appear in the subject line of Bhattacharya's message also in your compouter:

  

Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Re: {भारतीयविद&# 2381;वत्परिषत्} Filter, Host ...  

  

The same numbers increased by the reading of the same message and it is nil in Pandurangi's message:

  

**Subject:**Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Re:

  

However, Aerial Unicode MS would be readable in MS Windows. Or try changing the subject line using your own fonts if it is the problem in reading the Unicode Devanagari subject line in the messages you receive from BVP. Aerial Unicode has Devanagari Fonts also.
