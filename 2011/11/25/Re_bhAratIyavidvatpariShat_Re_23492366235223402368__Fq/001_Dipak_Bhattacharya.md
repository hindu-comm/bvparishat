\<The same numbers appear in the subject line of Bhattacharya's message also in your compouter:>  

So, because I did not change the subject line. It does not appear in this letter, I hope.

  

Arial Unicode MS will be found installed by default in every Windows system. In Wndows 7 + MS Word 2007 all the diacritics will be found in the Symbol inventory. In the same operative system one can create shortcut of every diacritic of the Symbol inventory. All the diacritics will be found with TNR and many other fonts too in the Windows 7+MS Word 2007 system.

There is one deficiency. The vocalic r will be with a dot below r like ṛ but not with a small ring below. I have been advised that downloading Gandhari Unicode might solve the problem but I have not succeeded till now. I myself designed and edited one. That was printable but, naturally, not Unicode compliant. So Internet did not accept that.
