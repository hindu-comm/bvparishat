Esteemed Professor K Subrahmanyam and Dr Pandurangi,

  

Thanks for the elucidation on the issue on hand regarding s'rotra and s'abda.

  

Kumarila's position is untenable in Nyaaya as what he speaks of as the organ of hearing is actually the seat (indriya-golaka)of s'rotrendriya.When [ghraa.na](http://ghraa.na) is naasaagravarti,rasanaa is jihvaagravarti,tvak is akhila-s'ariira-varti and [cak.su](http://cak.su) is k.r.s.na-taaraagra-varti,then why should s'rotra be kar.na-s'a.skulyavacchinna.m nabha.h and not kar.na-s'a.skuli is not clear in Nyaaya-Vais;e.sika to me.

It could be likewise : s'abda-graahaka.m s'rotra.m kar.na-s'a.skuli-varti !

  

Again an untenable position that s'abda is the object of cognition and it's inherent cause 'aakaas'a' is the organ of cognition ! Or we distinguish the two 'aakaas'a-s' - one as producing sound and the other as receiving the same.

  

In Saa.mkhya the organ of hearing is an evolute of ahankaara,but in Advaita Vedaanta it's a product of the saattvika component of aakaas'a tanmaatra.But in Nyaaya the same emerges out of p.rthvii bhuuta : Cf. ghraa.na-rasana....s'[rotraa.niindriyaa.ni](http://rotraa.niindriyaa.ni) bhuutebhya.h.

  

In Ny.Bh. '[niyata-vi.sayaa.niindriyaa.ni](http://niyata-vi.sayaa.niindriyaa.ni) bhautikaani abhautika.m mana.h'.In Saa.mkhya manas comes from ahankaara and in Advaita from the collective aspect of the saattvika components of the five tanmaatra-s.

  

When the seat or locus of a particular sense is defective then the same is said to be dysfunctional in Saa.mkhya,in Aayurveda the corrective is applied to resume the functioning by medicine.

  

In Saa.mkhya and Advaita the indriya-s are a part of the subtle body which are carried to a next life,but in Nyaaya and Miimaa.msaa it's not so.Only mind accompanies the self in transmigration.Ina new body sense organs are made fresh from the five bodily elements.

  

The expression 'naasaagravarti' is tip of the nose as commonly accepted.The psychologists may vary,but sometimes they also do come back to s'aastraic positions,For example earlier it was their thesis that various tastes are experienced at various locations on the tongue, but now they have taken the whole organ as experiencing various tastes ! Another point,in the GItaa 'VI 'sa.mprek.sya naasikaagra.m sva.m' etc. the point mentioned according to some practitioners is the spot between the eye-brows where the nose reaches.

  

sapras'rayam,
