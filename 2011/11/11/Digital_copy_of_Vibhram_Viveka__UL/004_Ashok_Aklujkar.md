I have seen Prof. Lambert Schmithausen's edn and translation of the Vibhrama-viveka in German (a very remarkable, although not yet perfect, revision of the great Kuppuswami Sastri's work). However, I am not aware of a French edn. Since the Vibhrama-viveka shares several kaarikaas with the Brahma-siddhi, could it be that Mr. Vishal Agrawal is in fact referring to a French translation/exposition of the Brahma-siddhi? This I know as:La Philosophie De Mandana Misra, Vue A Partir De La Brahmasiddhi, authored by the late Madeleine BIardeau and publlished by Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient in 1969. However, ifthere is a separate French publication dedicated to the VV, i would be delighted to have its publication particulars. And thanks to Mr. Agrawal for the scan ofKuppuswami Sastri's edn.
