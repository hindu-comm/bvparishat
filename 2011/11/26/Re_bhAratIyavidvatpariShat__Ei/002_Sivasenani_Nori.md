Sir

  

Before you hit the send button, kindly edit the subject line and remove all matter starting with "Re:..." upto the beginning of the actual subject - in this case "Filter...".

  

Or, better still, open a gmail account - even if, specifically only for BVP, and slowly move to gmail. Juno was a great company a decade ago; I guess it no longer keeps pace with technological developments.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
