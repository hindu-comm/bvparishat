### Decoding Indus Scipt Susa cylinder seal: Susa-Indus interaction areas

Background  
  
Fish glyph on a Susa pot has been decoded as Indus script. See<http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/11/decoding-fish-and-ligatured-fish-glyphs.html>That the pot came from Meluhha has been further substantiated by analysing Susa-Indus interaction areas.

In particular, there is a bronze sculpture excavated in Susa, called Sit Shamshi. "Sunrise (ceremony)" This large piece of bronze shows a religious ceremony. In the center are two men in ritual nudity surrounded by religious furnishings - vases for libations, perhaps bread for offerings, steles - in a stylized urban landscape: a multi-tiered tower, a temple on a terrace, a sacred wood. In the Middle-Elamite period (15th-12th century BC), Elamite craftsmen acquired new metallurgical techniques for the execution of large monuments, statues and reliefs.<http://tinyurl.com/coobwur>  
  
I suggest that this religious ceremony in front of a ziggurat is a sandhyavandanam (morning prayer to the sun) by the metallurgist artisan from Meluhha. The prayer is a veneration of the ancestors whose remains are interned in the ziggurat/stupa. Further researches have to be done on the continuance of similar traditions in the metal smelting areas on Ganga valley, sites such as Lohardiwa, Malhar, and Raja-nal-ki-tila (where Rakesh Tiwari has found evidence of iron smelting in ca. 18th century BCE).

The ziggurat model is also comparable to the evidence of the ziggurat in Mohenjodaro and a stupa at Chaneti in Haryana.<http://www.thebuddhistforum.com/buddhist-art/monuments/stupas/148-buddhist-stupa-at-chaneti.html>

The discovery in Susa, of a cylinder seal (now in Louvre museum) with Indus script inscription (shown below) is a landmark event in historical studies.  
  
A seal made in Meluhha. The language of the inscription on this cylinder seal found in Susa reveals that it was made in Harappa in the Indus Valley. In antiquity, the valley was known as Meluhha. The seal's chalky white appearance is due to the fired steatite it is made of. Craftsmen in the Indus Valley made most of their seals from this material, although square shapes were usually favored. The animal carving is similar to those found in Harappan works. The animal is a bull with no hump on its shoulders, or possibly a short-horned gaur. Its head is lowered and the body unusually elongated. As was often the case, the animal is depicted eating from a woven wicker manger.

This monograph researches the Susa-Indus interaction areas Susa-Indus interaction areas Location of Susa, in relation to Tal-i Iblis, Shahr-i-Sokhta and Mundigak provides a framework for analyzing the interaction areas of Indus civilization. Tal-i Iblis is a historic site which produced copper artefacts dated to ca. 6500 BCE. Artifacts found: metallurgical crucible fragments, pieces of copper ore, small copper objects and some slag…With dates falling unequivocally within the 6th millennium BCE, these laboratory analytical and experimental results make Tal-i-iblis the earliest site in Western Asia and in the world whose archaeological remains indicate the development of a copper extractive metallurgy. An MIT report examines a small corpus of artifacts from Tal-i Iblis, Iran dating to the mid-6th millennium BCE. When excavated in the late 1960s, these artifacts were presumed to be evidence of an early copper smelting technology on the Iranian Plateau, and they were delivered to MIT for further analysis.
