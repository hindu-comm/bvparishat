Sir



In gmail there is a section called Settings, in which you can enable transliteration. Once youswitch it on, inRich formatting mode (another feature which can be switched off or on, visible when you are componsing an email), thefirst-left button above the box in which you type the message will have an Indian script alphabet(अ) displayed. After that you simply click that button, activate the transliteration mode, and type the word you want phonetically in English.



For instance 'sundaraeshvaran' would be displayed as सुन्दरेश्वरान which after some 'editing' can be displayed as सुन्दरेश्वरन। To 'edit', you need to press backspace as if you were about to delete it; Gmail senses that you are not happy with the result and suggests alternatives.These alternatives are not always perfect. For example, in the second rendering above, a halant ismissing. To generate a halant, adifferent trick needs to be used. Justtype 'n' in transliteration mode, and we will get न् whichwe can copy to replace the fullन to get सुन्दरेश्वरन्.



The process is actually not that complicated. I deliberately chose an example, which explains a bit more of tweaking. Others are plainer and achieved in one step. For instance, Sundareshvarahgives सुन्दरेश्वरः in a single step, as it is a regular and popular word-form.
