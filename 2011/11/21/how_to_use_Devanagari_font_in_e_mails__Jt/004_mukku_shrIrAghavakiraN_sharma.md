It is possible to type in Devanagari easily on any of the following Windows operating systems: XP/Vista/7. I did not work on others, so I do not know. Enabling the \[Inscript\] keyboard will suffice to type inDevanagari. This enabling is done through changing your Regional Language settings as explained by Sri Dipak Bhattacharya.

  

Gmail transliterator (as explained by Sri SivasenaniNori) is a good tool, but that confines its immediate usage to Gmail.
