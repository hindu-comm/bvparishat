Dear Friend,

If you have Windows 7 with MSW 2007 you will get the font easily.

1.You can click Arial Unicode MS 'SYMBOL' where you will get the Devnagari script fonts with all the necessary signs and numerals. But in this option the output will be slow.

2.For fast typing you may choose the Devnagari keyboard. For that go to the control panel, click Region and Language, choose 'Keyboard and language', choose Sanskrit from the language. bar. The next options will appear in the box. Back to MS Word you will find a button in the task bar indicating EN or SA or something with which you have so far worked. Left click it. The SA option will appear in a list. Choose it. Now you may use your keyboard in the inscript system which you have to learn. But that is very easy. You check the keys to know what is what, it will soon become an easy task to write in Devnagari. The output will be internet compatible as in the previous option. One problem- the numerals will be in the European script.  

3. Thirdly, you may download Baraha which is a Unicode compliant independent processor. Its outputs too will appear undistorted in the Internet. Its numerals are in Indian but it has some problems that you will slowly learn through practice.  

I hope this may help. You may write to me off the List and tell me if the above helped.

Best
