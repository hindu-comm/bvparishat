 There is an easy way to check whether 2003 will do or not. See the drop down list in the font option button appearing in the toolbar atop the MSW page. If it offers Mangal you will have no problem. If that list lacks Mangal there will at least be Arial Unicode MS. Check the Symbols button with Arial Unicode MS as the font. If the Symbols here include all the Devnagari characters then too you will have no problem.  

 In any case you must go to the Region and Language option in the Control Panel and do as I advised. Be careful not to delete the existing options like English. Sanskrit with Devnagari must be an 'Addition'. If you are successful please mail to me.The task will become much easier if, additionally, you can choose an on-screen keyboard action.
