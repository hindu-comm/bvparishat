Dear all,

There is an exquisite collection of badhas with picture illustration composed by renowned scholar

Bannanje Govindacharya in his book commentary on Madhvavijaya (in Sanskrit).

There is a separate parishishta named "Bandha Meemamsa" which has a collection of about 49 bandhas along with pictureillustration and the shlokas composed by author himself.

It is published by Ishavasya Pratishtanam, Udupi. The phone number is (0820-2525396 / 2521047).

The book also has other interesting scholarly topics such as "Chando Meemamsa", "Alankara Meemamsa", "Kaavya Meemamsa" etc.



Best regards,

Pavamana
