Dear Sir,



Just a clarification regarding the Thyagaraja Krti in Begada

The meaning of the Thyagarajaswami Krti will be as follows:

1\. Jyaavaranuta= praised by the best archers (jya=bow; vara=best)

2.jyajavara+ husband of the daughter of Earth (Jyaa=earth;ja=daughter;vara=husband)

3\. bidaujavaraja= younger brother of Indra (upendra) (bidauja= indra; avaraja= younger brother)

4\. jyaavra-aja-rudra-ananeesura bhaavaneeya= adored by kings (jyaa+ vara= the husband of Earth or Bhupati), Brahma(aja),Siva (Rudra),avaneesura (brahmins)
