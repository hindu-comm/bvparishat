Thanks to both Dr. HNBhat ji and Shri Shrivathsa B.  

First let us take a little exercise to analyze what Shri Shrivatsa said. If बिडौ-जावरजाश्रित is an adjective of Tyagaraja the text will give us the meaning that Tyagaraja becomes dependable and बिडौ-जावरज becomes dependent. I think this may lead to some incongruity.  

Then coming to Dr. HNBhat ji - Yes. It seems to be very convincing split to read it as बिडौजावरज+आश्रितत्यागराज. It can very much satisfy the existing doubt. Thanks a lot to Dr. HNBhat Ji.

Indeed I missed it. But the reason for missing it is the tradition of singing it in vogue among the Carnatic singers.

They are always splitting it as : बिडौजावरजाश्रित and then त्यागराज is associated with the subsequent epithet and sing like त्यागराजज्यावराजरुद्रावनीसुरभावनीय! Hence this confusion. I sincerely thank Prof. Ramakaran Sharma Ji, Prof. M. Sri Raghava Kiran garu, Dr. HN Bhatt Ji and Shrivatsa who enlightened me with their scholarly explanations for my doubt.

With warm regards to all,  

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
