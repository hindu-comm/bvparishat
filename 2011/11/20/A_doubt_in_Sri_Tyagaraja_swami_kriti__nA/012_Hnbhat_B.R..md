Can you give the reference to the Dictionary you referred to to get the meaning you have given for ज्या?

  

According to

amarakośa - kṣatriyavarga II

  

मोर्वी ज्या*शिञ्जिनी*गुणः ।५३\|\| It is the stinge of the bow. and these are all the meanings in the Dictionary:

  

(in geom.) the chord of an arc (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
a bow-string (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
\[gramm.\] the root jyā



>

> 
> > 
> > 3\. bidaujavaraja= younger brother of Indra (upendra) (bidauja= indra; > avaraja= younger brother) >
> 

  

And this has been suggested in many of the earlier postings. Do you have any reference to ईन्द्रः by the synonym बिडौज (ending in short vowel अ) other than the popular synonym बिडौजस् - which would be in the place बिडौजोवर० in the compound you have suggested and not बिडौजावर as it is seen the verse. Any clarification for this additionally with authentic source?

> 
> > 
> >

This is indeed a novel finding. The collocation of kings with ब्रह्म and रुद्र is not at all expected and ज्यावर is not used generally to mean the kings, than explicitly भूपति, and other popular terms with the synonyms of earth where the word पति means the lord and not the husband.

Any reference to this usage can be helpful to make the clarification in the context than mere guess.
