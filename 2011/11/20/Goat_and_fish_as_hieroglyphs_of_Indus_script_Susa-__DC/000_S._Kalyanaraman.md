### Goat and fish as hieroglyphs of Indus script: Susa-Meluhha interactions

Susa-Meluhha interactions

  
<http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/11/mohenjo-daro-stupa-great-bath-modeled.html>This blogpost notes that the ziggurat shown on the Sit-Shamshi bronze compares with a ziggurat which might have existed in the Stupa mound of Mohenjodaro (lit. mound of the dead), indicating the veneration of ancestors in Susa and Meluhha in contemporaneous times.

Shu-ilishu's cylinder seal. Department des Antiquites Orienteles, Musee du Louvre, Paris.'Based on cuneiform documents from Mesopotamia we know that there was at least one Meluhhan village in Akkad at that time, with people called 'Son of Meluhha' living there. The cuneiform inscription (ca. 2020 BCE) says that the cylinder seal belonged to Shu-ilishu, who was a translator of the Meluhhan language. "The presence in Akkad of a translator of the Meluhhan language suggests that he may have been literate and could read the undeciphered Indus script. This in turn suggests that there may be bilingual Akkadian/Meluhhan tablets somewhere in Mesopotamia. Although such documents may not exist, Shu-ilishu's cylinder seal offers a glimmer of hope for the future in unraveling the mystery of the Indus script." (Gregory L. Possehl, Shu-ilishu's cylinder seal, *Expedition*, Vol. 48, Number 1, pp. 42-43)

Comparable to the ligatured-fish glyphs discussed in this blogpost are the ligatures found on a basin of Susa decorated with goat-fish figures (discussed below).  
  
While a composite comparable glyph has not been identified in the corpus of Indus inscriptions,there are seals which show fish glyph together with antelope glyph; fish glyph together with composite bull + heifer glyph.

Seal. National Museum: 135.  
  
The rebus readings of the hieroglyphs are: mẽḍha ‘antelope’; rebus: meḍ ‘iron’ (Ho.) aya 'fish'; rebus: aya 'cast metal'.  
  
A Susa ritual basin dated to ca. 12th or 13th century BCE depicts goat and fish ligatured into a 'fabulous' or 'composite' animal representation, clearly intended to connote the underlying hieroglyphic meaning.  
  
At what point in time, the glyphic representations denoting native metal or cast metal artefacts and which were used to authenticate trade transactions of the civilization, using Indus script inscriptions, were deified can only be conjectured. This shift from use in trade to use in cultural/religious contexts may have occurred -- in the interaction areas such as Susa and Meluhha -- between 19th and 13th centuries BCE (i.e. between the time when the continued use of Indus Script glyphs is attested, say, 19th century BCE and the time when the same glyphs or cognate glyphic representations were deified, say, 13th century BCE).  
  
This conjecture has a semantic basis in mleccha (meluhha) -- the underlying Indus language. A remarkable evidence is provided by a lexeme in Kota. The lexeme is:*kole.l*‘smithy, temple’ (Ko.)*kol*‘working in iron, blacksmith (Ta.)(DEDR 2133)  
  
An artifact produced in a smithy becomes a deified representation in the attributes of divinities represented in a temple because the smithy itself is perceived as a temple. The creativity of the smith or artisan finds a parallel in divine creation or the cosmic dance traditions of Indian linguistic area.  
  
The Susa ritual basin with the ligatured goat and fish can be interpreted in the context of deification of pictorial representations as detailed in the embedded note and also in the write-up presented about the artifact in the Louvre Museum  
  
The composite glyphic of goat-fish on the Susa ritual basin can be compared with the more comprehensive composition glyphic which is exemplified by the inscription on m0302.  

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SUIu0jGbeRs/TskQyzfOK2I/AAAAAAAAQNg/auTu-u-brLc/s320/m0302.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SUIu0jGbeRs/TskQyzfOK2I/AAAAAAAAQNg/auTu-u-brLc/s1600/m0302.jpg)

Mohenjodaro seal (m0302).  
  
The composite animal glyph is one example to show that rebus method has to be applied to every glyptic element in the writing system.  
  
The glyphic elements of the composite animal shown together with the glyphs of fish, fish ligatured with lid, arrow are:  
  
--ram or sheep (forelegs denote a bovine)  
--neck-band, ring  
--*bos indicus*(zebu)(the high horns denote a*bos indicus*)  
--elephant (the elephant's trunk ligatured to human face)  
--tiger (hind legs denote a tiger)  
--serpent (tail denotes a serpent)  
--human face  
  
All these glyphic elements are decoded rebus:  
  
*meḍho*a ram, a sheep (G.)(CDIAL 10120);  
*kaḍum*‘neck-band, ring’  
*adar ḍangra*‘zebu’  
*ibha*‘elephant’ (Skt.); rebus: ib ‘iron’ (Ko.)  
*kolo*‘jackal’ (Kon.)  
  
*moṇḍ*the tail of a serpent (Santali) Rebus: Md. moḍenī ʻ massages, mixes ʼ. Kal.rumb. moṇḍ -- ʻ to thresh ʼ, urt. maṇḍ -- ʻ to soften ʼ (CDIAL 9890) Thus, the ligature of the serpent as a tail of the composite animal glyph is decoded as: polished metal (artifact).  
  
*mũhe*‘face’ (Santali); mleccha-mukha (Skt.) = milakkhu ‘copper’ (Pali)

Śrīvatsa symbol variants found at Kankalitila, Mathura,late1st cent.BCE: with variants in about five Jaina āyāgapaṭṭa-s; a fish is shown in the middle apparently tied to two strings (or, molluscs) on either side; apparently, this ligatured pictorial formed the basis for the evolution of the Śrīvatsa symbol almost looking like a stylized trident. (After Pl. 30 C in: Savita Sharma, 1990,*Early Indian Symbols, Numismatic Evidence*, Delhi, Agam Kala Prakashan; cf. Shah, U.P., 1975,*Aspects of Jain Art and Architecture*, p. 77). The hieroglyph composition of fish tied to a pair of molluscs can be read rebus: ayira ‘fish’; dhama ‘tie’; hangi ‘snail’; pair ‘dul’; Rebus: arya, ayira ‘noble’; dhama ‘global ethic’: ayira dhama; ayira sangha ‘community’; dol ‘picture,form’. Thus, the composition connotes the message: ariya dhamma, ariya sangha. When the scribe had to depict a grapheme which sounded close to the word, ‘dhamma’, the artisan chose the form of a tied up up – tied to a fish, ayir; rebus: ayira, arya. The use of ‘fish’ glyphs (ayir ‘fish’) can be explained as rebus representations of the nobility associated in Jaina tradition with the word ayira (metath. Arya) ‘noble person’. Pali: Ayira (& Ayyira) (n. -- adj.) \[Vedic ārya, Metathesis for ariya as diaeretic form of ārya, of which the contracted (assimilation) form is ayya.

This is an example of evolution of Indus script glyphs in the context of the Indian cultural traditions of representing a smithy as a temple and using artifacts read rebus and used on sculptural traditions of Indian art and architecture. Similar evolution of glyphic representations in Mesopotamia and Babylonia can be explained in cultural contexts and the context of a temple for many divinities of the Mesopotamian/Elamite/Babylonian traditions.

Bassin cultuel orné de poissons-chèvres, Epoque médio-élamite. Technical information: Ritual basin decorated with goatfish figures.Middle Elamite period  
Susa, Iran Limestone H. 62.8 cm; W. 92 cm Jacques de Morgan excavations, 1904-05 Sb 19 Near Eastern Antiquities.  
  
[Ritual basin decorated with goatfish figures](http://louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226445&CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226445&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500804&baseIndex=1&bmLocale=en#)  
  
This limestone basin dates from the 13th or 12th century BC. It was used for ritual libations. The decoration depicts goatfish figures around a sacred tree in reference to the Mesopotamian god Enki/Ea. This reveals the full extent of the mutual influence of the Iranian and Mesopotamian cosmogonies. The sacred palm, the ancestor of the Assyrian sacred tree, reflects the importance of dates as a food source in the region.  
  
  
Description  
  
A basin symbolizing the water cycle  
  
This basin was broken into several pieces when it was found and has been reconstituted. Used by priests in their ritual libations, liquid was poured out over the basin and was then collected for re-use. There were two types of ritual libations. The first reflected the water cycle, with water rising up from underground, filling rivers and wells. The other was an offering of beer, wine or honey, poured out for the deity in anticipation of his meal. The decoration of this basin suggests it was used for the first type of ritual libation. It is made in the shape of the realm of Enki/Ea, Apsu, the body of fresh water lying beneath the earth and feeding all the rivers and streams. Apsu is likewise represented in the bronze model called Sit-Shamshi (Louvre, Sb2743). The fact that it was found in Susa indicates that the Elamites adopted certain aspects of Mesopotamian mythology.  
  
Goatfish figures around a sacred palm  
  
The rim of the limestone basin is decorated with a single repeated motif: two goatfish figures, or Nou, on either side of a stylized tree. These creatures were the attributes of Enki/Ea, the Mesopotamian god of underground water, symbolizing his power to replenish vegetation, represented by the sacred palm tree. A similar stylized tree can be seen on the stele of King Untash-Napirisha (Sb12). The tree consists of a central trunk with a number of offshoots curved at the tip and with three palmettes on the upper part. The image is completely stylized, bearing only a very distant resemblance to actual date palm trees. This symbol of plant life reflects the importance of date palms in the region. Dates were a staple foodstuff for the local population. This type of sacred palm was the predecessor of the sacred trees of Assyria. A relief from the palace of Assurnazirpal II in Nimrud depicts a winged spirit with a bird's head in front of just such a sacred tree (AO19849). The upper part of the basin is decorated with an intertwining pattern resembling flowing water. The inside of the basin consists of a series of squared steps leading down to the bottom of the dish. Traces of an inscription, too worn to be read, indicate that there was originally a text along the edges of the basin.

This stele with four registers was commissioned by the Elamite king Untash-Napirisha for the city of Chogha Zanbil. It was later moved to Susa by one of his successors, probably Shutruk-Nahhunte I. The four registers depict the god Inshushinak acknowledging the monarch's power, two priestesses accompanying the king to the temple, minor deities - half-women, half-fish - holding streams of water, and two creatures - half-men, half-mouflons - who are guardians of the sacred tree.  
  
  
Description  
  
A stele with four registers  
  
King Untash-Napirisha dedicated this stele to the god Inshushinak in Al-Untash, now known as Chogha Zanbil, the new religious capital he had built 40 kilometers southeast of Susa. This region thus became the political and religious heart of the kingdom of Elam. The stele must have been moved to Susa by one of his successors, probably Shutruk-Nahhunte I, at some point in the 12th century BC. The stele is decorated with four registers separated by a guilloche frieze framed by two serpents whose heads confront each other at the top of the stele.  
  
The king ceremonially acknowledges the deity  
  
In the upper register, the deity Inshushinak welcomes Untash-Napirisha. Between the two figures is carved a dedication in Elamite, naming Inshushinak god of the Susa plain. He is sitting on a throne that seems to consist of the coiled bodies of serpents: the god is holding the horned head of one of the snakes. The god also bears his divine insignia of a ring and a stick. The Mesopotamian tradition is depicted in Elamite style. Snakes were honored in Iran as a symbol of fertility. In the 2nd millennium BC, snakes were closely associated with the "god with a serpent and flowing streams," corresponding to the Mesopotamian deity Enki/Ea, god of underground water. The two snakes along the edges of the stele are probably marking the borders of Enki's realm of Apsu, the body of fresh water that was believed to encircle the world.  
The second register depicts Untash-Napirisha, flanked by his wife Napir-Asu and probably his mother, the priestess U-tik. The two women are accompanying the king to the temple for the ceremony. The names of the two women are carved on their forearms, which are crossed over their stomachs in the usual pose of sculpted figures of the Middle Elamite period.  
  
Supernatural guardians of nature  
  
The third register depicts a minor goddess with a fish's tail instead of legs. She is holding streams of water flowing from several vessels. By perpetuating the water cycle, she underlines its importance in nature, particularly for plants, represented by a stylized tree in the lower register. It was believed that supernatural beings like this deity lived in Apsu. Here, the streams rather resemble ropes, mirroring the sinuous lines of the serpents. It is clear that these are Elamite deities because of the cow's ears sticking up from their hair, in addition to their human ears.  
In the bottom register, two creatures - half-men, half-mouflons - flank a stylized tree that represents plant life. These figures are the equivalents of the Mesopotamian half-man, half-bull figures. Their role here may be to replace the acolytes of the god Enki as nude heroes guarding his realm. By guarding the underground water, they protect the sacred tree, which represents the way that plants flourish when they are watered. These two lower registers have been carved to form a symmetrical composition.
