Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



I will present my findings with my power point slides on " Mahabharata-History or Mythology?" on Nov. 20 in Houston, at Durgabari Temple from 12 noon to 1.30 pm.



There are three models of the ancient Indian history.

Model 1- Aryan invasion of ancient India

Model 2-Out of India theory. This also includes the thesis of Dr. Bhagawan Singh.

Model 3-Mahabharata Empire over Asia-My Model-Indo-Asians before Indo-Europeans!



Slides from the Middle-East ancient history (especially from Persian Empire of the known history) will be shown. I found better picture of the mount Mujavant in the book on China. That will be included. Thanks to Dr. Kalyanraman for his posting some time back on Mount Mujavant. That posting had a good map. That will be included.



Last year one person from audience in BORI presentation asked question about Krishna because I did not talk about Krishna in my presentation. I showed him last slide, "Krishnayan" but stopped there. Now with great courage I will show slides on Krishna's people in order to see the effect on audience.



Krishna's research is real research. Other things-Aryans etc are secondary nature.! Thanks, N.R.Joshi
