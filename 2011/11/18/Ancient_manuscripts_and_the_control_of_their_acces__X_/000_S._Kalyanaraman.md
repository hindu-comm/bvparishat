### Ancient manuscripts and the control of their access

On 14.11.11, a[blog post](http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/11/manuscript-has-been-discovered-with.html)was made: A manuscript has been discovered with Indus script: Lucy Zuber Buehler (2009).  
  
This resulted in a lively discussion among scholars engaged in studies of ancient civilizations. This also led to a survey of ancient Buddhist manuscripts on birch-barks etc.and an update was made to the blog post on Nov. 17, 2011.  
  
Some ethical issues arise and have to be deliberated upon.  
  
1. Some people had announced a 'prize' for the discovery of an Indus script inscription with over 50 symbols. The context of this announcement was a 'conviction' on the part of the announcers that they were certain that such a long inscription would never be found because Indus script was produced by 'illiterates' and did not represent writing. The title of a paper which led to this announcement was:[The Collapse of the Indus-Script Thesis: The Myth of a Literate Harappan Civilization.](http://www.safarmer.com/fsw2.pdf)  
  
Was the prize announcement a fair challenge? Were the rules for awarding the prize unambiguous and clear? For example, a condition for the prize award reads: "...must be accepted as genuine by a consensus of recognized Indus researchers." The announcers have to ponder after keeping the prize money in an escrow account: How will a consensus be ensured? And, who are the recognized Indus researchers?  
  
A number of ethical questions arise. I will flag some.Is it a legitimate work of the museums of the world to engage in 'collecting' manuscripts? If the University of Vienna is responsible for the 'genuineness' of the manuscripts collected, what measures should they adopt to ensure 'genuineness'? 'Consensus of recognized researchers'? Is it ethical to keep such collections in museums instead of returning them to the states from where such artifacts provenanced? This issue has been debated, for example, in the context of some artifacts in Schoyen collection (see below).  
  
What is the ethical role of the academe in this issue? In the case of the undergraduate thesis about a birch-bark manuscript said to contain Indus script with about 200 symbols, was it correct for University of Bern to announce a review of an artifact in University of Vienna while harboring an apprehension that the artifact could be a fake? Shouldn't Univ. of Bern have conveyed such an apprehension to Univ. of Vienna?  
  
Methinks, the role of researchers and academe, in particular, should be to present facts as they emerge without making*a priori*assumptions and ensuring that as objective an account as possible is rendered for the benefit of those interested in ancient civilization studies.  
  
Is it too much to ask for empathy in dealing with the mists of history when an archaeologist or an anthropologist has to rely on very flimsy evidences to reconstruct or imagine cultural advances in the story of human civilization? Or, citing Ananda Coomaraswamy, should one shrug one's shoulders and move on: “Myth embodies the nearest approach to absolute truth that can be stated in words.” — A. K. Coomaraswamy,*Hinduism & Buddhism.*Myth is, afterall, “A metaphor for what lies behind the visible world.” (Joseph Campbell,*The Power of Myth*).

"In the fax (presented on the NRK website) Schøyen writes that he wants a refund of $37,500 from the dealer for three ‘Indus script’ fragments that had turned out to be fakes. It seems that these fragments were the ones said to have come from the cave. Not surprisingly, market demand for ancient texts has led not only to looting but also to the production of forgeries. Looting is often described with the simile of tearing the pages of the book of history. With the production of fake texts, new pages are added and history is, quite literally, rewritten."
