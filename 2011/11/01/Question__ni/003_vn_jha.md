'x is different from y' or'y is different from x'means 'x possesses difference of y' or'y possesses difference of x' where difference is a distinct category of entity.One canalso paraphrase it as 'x possesses absolute absence of the state of being of the form of y' or'y possesses the absolute absence of the state of being of the form ofx'

**taadaatmya is that state** and itmeans 'the state of being of the form of any entityx' and it is neither a quality(guna)nor a generic property(samanya).x is related to x by identity.it is the identity relation by which x exits in x and does not exist in any entiy other than x and hence, a particular kind of svarupasambandha.
