"cloth is not pot" & "this pot is not that pot" both these usages  
the Naiyayikas can explain very easily. In first case when we say  
"cloth is not pot" we want to convey that in cloth there is a mutual  
absence whose counter-positiveness is delimited by potness. Therefore  
a cloth is different from a pot. Take the second example: "this pot is  
not that pot". Here we want to convey that in the particular pot there  
is a mutual absence whose counter-positiveness is delimited by  
individuality of the particular pot. A pot is different from another  
pot and in this case in that particular pot there a mutual absence  
whose counter-positiveness is limited by individuality of that pot. To  
make the point clear employing Sanskrit terminologies I would say पटे  
घटत्वावच्छिन्नप्रतियोगिताकः अन्योन्याभावः विद्यते। परन्तु घटान्तरे  
घटत्वावच्छिन्नप्रतियोगिताकः अन्योन्याभावो न विद्यते। किन्तु  
तद्व्यक्तित्वावच्छिन्नप्रतियोगिताकोन्योन्याभावः विद्यते। अस्मादेव  
कारणात् द्वयोः प्रयोगयोः भेदो भवति।
