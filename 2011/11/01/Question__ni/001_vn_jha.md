***a*** is equal to or identical with 'only ***a'*** and hence **a  
**is different from 'all that is not **a'. This is the idea of bheda** in Nyaya. Because 'cloth is cloth, therefore, cloth is not pot'. Because 'this pot is identical with this pot; therefoe 'this pot is not that pot'. Look carefullyinto the definition of anyonabhava as given in Tarkasangraha.
