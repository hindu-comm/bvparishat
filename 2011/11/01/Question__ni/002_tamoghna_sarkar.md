I understand but a pot can be distinguished from a cloth by means of generic properties.My point is when we say that they are different(bhinna),we should not construe that difference by means of generic properties because tadatmya surely is not a generic property.But Matilal [et.al](http://et.al) have shown that way in course of application of the dictum that the absolute absence of a property and the difference of that property-possessor is extensionally equivalent.we should not construe unrestrictedly "difference of pot" as "absolute absence of potness". Am I correct? My another question is does nyaya admit tadatmya in categories like quality ?
