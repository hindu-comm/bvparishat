Hi,  
  
I think the question was more about 'public recitation' as opposed to learning/ practice. However, I am not sure I quite link public recitation is linked to practicing.  
  
Anyways, one of the examples I was given why ghana is NOT preferred in Ashirvachanam is thus - Consider the shruti - ".... aparamchana jarasa marate patiH ..... ". I was told that this when recited in vikruti pathas, the meaning would change drastically from a 'ashirvad' to a 'shapa' to the newly married bride without them realizing it. There are many scholars on this list who could probably suggest how this could be possible.  
  
Also, I am being a bit curious on your point (b) below, that Vikruti patha is preferred on over the mula-patha. Could you please elaborate. I was involved in the recently concluded Telanganda Vedasabhas in hyderabad (Oct 19-23), and couldn't find any such preference. We have Ghana swasti in addition to the regular swasthi daily, and couple of other occassions, but no preference as such. But may be I missed something.  
  
  
Thanks  
Vissu
