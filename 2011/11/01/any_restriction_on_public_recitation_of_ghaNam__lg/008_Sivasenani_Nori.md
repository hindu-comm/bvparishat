Only Kramaanta-svaadhyaayins are usually allowed. Krama is a vikriti paaTha. Even if some scholars who are only well versed in samhitapaaTha only join, the dakshiNA given varies: samhitapaaTha scholar gets the least, next the kramaantasvaadhyayin and finally the GhanapaaThi.

  

If one explores the reason, it could be that minor mistakes in svara or akshara might not be caught that quickly in samhitapaaTha; whereas this mistake gets amplified in krama and many times so in Ghana. So, when a scholar sits in a sabha and recites a vikriti paaTha, the perfectness of his 'grantha' (that is his knowledge of Veda) is so much more clear.
