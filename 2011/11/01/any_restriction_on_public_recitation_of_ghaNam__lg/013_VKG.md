I am in total agreement with what is stated by Sri Siva Senani.  
  
Ghana Paatha and Vikrutis including Pada, Krama, Jataa are for  
preservation of the Moolam.  
  
Display of these aspects to demonstrate the mastery and enthuse  
students and future scholars; as well as challenge the participants to  
maintain the association with Moolam.  
  
Otherwise, we fall in the category of  
यस्तित्याज सखिविदं सखायं न तस्य वाच्यपि भागो अस्ति।
