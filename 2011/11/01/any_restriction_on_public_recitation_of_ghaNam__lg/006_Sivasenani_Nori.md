I do not know if the obvious is being missed.

  

Not only ghanapaThanam, VedapaThanam was never intended to be done in public. Many vedic scholars do not like mikes to be on, or any sort of recording to be done, when they start the vedapaThana.

  

If Ghana is not practiced how will 'raksha' happen? If there is never a need to demonstrate, why will anybody practice? There have to be certain venues where this mastery needs to be demonstrated. One such is a 'Vedasabha'.

  

I am associated with 'Vedasabhas' that our family members conduct through a trust, and had occasion to interact with very old scholars (say Srimaan PaaNDuraN\~gaacharya, who is 85+, maybe pushing 90) who quite often talk about their fathers / teachers and what their
grand-fathers / paramagurus said (for instance, Sriman Pandurangacharya's father refused a salary post to be the principal of Vedic school, on the matter of principle that Vedic knowledge is amulya and cannot be measured and paid for on a monthly basis - on an aside, they say Viday can be learnt by a) guru-SusrusheNa, b) pushkalena dhanena, c) vidyayaa ca).

  

Through out these interactions, there seems to be complete clarity that:

  

a\) VikritipaaTha is not used in any ritual

b\) VikritipaaTha is preferred in the Vedasabha (Ghana and Krama \[which is of the type namaste te rudra rudra manyavo for namaste rudra manyava ..\] are the ones which are recited in our sabhas) and for pariksha. The usual term I heard is a kramaanta-svaadhyaayin. First a student learns the samhitaa paaTha, then pada-paaTha and then krama-paaTha, before being certified as Vedic scholar. This certification is done in pareekshaa sabhas, which are one type of Vedasabhas.

  

These Vedasabhas, in a way, are public; in some ways, they are not. Though there is no formal restriction on entry of any persons in our sabhas, the earlier versions seemed to be for a limited audience, though not so much by explicit instructions, but in an implicit lay-of-the-land sort of way.  
  
During other events like marriage or griha-pravesh, though there is an elaborate ghana-recitation, it is always followed by ASirvachana mantras in samhita-paaTha. There never seemed to be any attempt to replace the mantras by any vikritipaaTha in any ritual, however small, in the circles that I am exposed to, even as Ghana was regularly heard.

  

In AP, these events are called 'sadasyam', which in earlier years used to have Saastra-artha charcha as well (not just in Vedas or mimaamsaa but in other angas and darSanas as well). We call the same event a 'Vedasabha', when not associated with any samskaara or family function and as sadasyam when associated with these. These are access-controlled events, and to that extent 'not public'. Implicitly, it is upto the Yajamaana to ensure that no rules regarding public recitation of veda are violated.

  

I hope Br. Sri. Ve. Mu. Vamsi Krishna Ghanapathi gaLu would state the siddhanta, as it were.
