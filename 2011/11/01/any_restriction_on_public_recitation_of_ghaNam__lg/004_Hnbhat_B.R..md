Anyhow I don't have any opinion about whether Veda was recited outside the context which it was meant to be recited. Originally they were meant for sacrificial purposes, Rik for praising, sAma- for singing, yajus- for offering the sacrifice. The remaining, Atharva - is presumably a manual for domestic or personal use of the "mantra"s. The question now revolves about whether the yAga-s were performed in public or in Yaga-shala-s which is sanctified as the term signifies. All are welcomed at the Yaga-shala, in participating to discharge their duties. This is just idea I have about the Vedic practice in ancient times rather it can be a guess.



The emphasis on आनुपूर्वी is because it is the प्रकृति or natural form of Vedic Texts as संहिता-s or compilations. The others are called विकृति-s displaced in order. The melody of reciting or the piety earned gained it the popularity and as the शिक्षा you cited clearly extols its practice. At least by the time of the शिक्षा-s (if historicity is applicable in respect of Vedic Literature) and otherwise, it is अनादि all the Vedic Literature and goes back time immemorial.

  

This was discussed in this forum some time ago:

Hope this covers many aspects of the विकृतिपाठ.

  

They are just not विकृति-s as घणपाढ is for घन-पाठः, but are meant for helping the memorizing the texts as it seems apparent from the extol position in the शिक्षा-s meant for teaching the methods of teaching/recitation.
