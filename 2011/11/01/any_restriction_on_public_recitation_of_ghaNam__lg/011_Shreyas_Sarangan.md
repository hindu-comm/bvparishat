श्री:

Dear Dr. Subrahmanyam,



I was under the impression that this anuvAkam from the Taittiriya Aranyakam was

specifically for the brahma-yagna "nitya-karma" and not in the context of general paarayanams

in a sadas.



Please correct me if I am mistaken.



Iam still unable to find any specific pramanas in the smrithis/shiksas against

recitation of vikruthi-pathas at this time.As you mentioned, it is best to follow thedesha-sampradayam

and shistacharam.



dhanyosmi,

-Shreyas
