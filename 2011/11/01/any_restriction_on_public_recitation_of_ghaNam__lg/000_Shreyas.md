श्री:

  

Respected Scholars,

  

प्रणामाः!

  

One of of my friends mentionedthat public ghaNam was frowned upon because it was like "regularly arresting the breath of Parabrahman".

  

Is there any suchrestriction on recitation of ghaNam or other vikruthi modes in public?

Either way, are there any pramanas?

  

Can scholars point to any documented records of public ghaNa/jata parayanam

prior to the beginning of the 20th century?

  

Regards,

Namo Veda Purushaya!

-Shreyas
