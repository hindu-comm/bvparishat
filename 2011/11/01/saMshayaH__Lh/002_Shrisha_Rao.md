It is said in that page that it is from br.hat sam.hitA. Definitely it is not the famous work of VarAhamihira. Second time it is quoted in SAn-kara darSana(p. 405) of the same edition. There it is said that this is pUrvAcAryair uktam. If I remember correctly, it is quoted even in vedAntasAra by sadAnanda. At present, I do not have vedAntasAra. I am sorry if I am wrong regarding second reference.

The earliest available citation, which also tags it to a text called बृहत्संहिता though not the well-known one as noted, is in Madhva's BSB. This is also the earliest known citing source for the well-known verse अल्पाक्षरमसन्दिग्धं सारवद्विश्वतोमुखम्, अस्तोभमनवद्यं च सूत्रं सूत्रविदो विदुः which is part of a longer extract.
