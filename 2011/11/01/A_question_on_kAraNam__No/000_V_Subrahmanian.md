Namaste.  
  
The word 'kAraNam', cause, can mean 'nimitta kAraNam' (Instrumenta cause) or / as well as 'upAdAna kAraNam' (material cause). Is there any provision in Grammar for the application of the word 'nimittam' to extend to mean 'upAdAnam' also contextually?  
  
Also there is a rule 'निमित्तापाये नैमित्तिकापायः’ - does this rule apply restrictively to instrumental cause only?  
  
Any help in this regard is welcome.  
  
Warm regards,
