**Dear Parishat Members,**

**  
**

Dr. ABS Sastry, from Srimaharshi Research Institute of Vedic Technology (SRIVT). Dr. BLV Prasad of NCL, Pune and Dr. K. Sridhar of NMRL Ambarnath are also involved in this project. In this project we have been able toconsistentlymake nanopurecopper of 20-30 nm in areproduciblemanner. The technique is very simple, inexpensive, does not needsophisticatedequipment and does not produce any toxicbyproducts. We have been able to show that these nano copper particle have promising antibacterial nature and a few other interesting properties that can be of industrial importance.

  

Recently DST along with CII has invited entries on innovations intechnologies. This was one of the entry. About 3 weeks back this project was shortlisted (50 projects shortlisted out of 850 entries) based on poster presentation in Bangalore for the final presentation in Delhi on November 16th. In the final presentation this was chosen as one of the five best innovations and an award was presented to Dr. Sastryon 17th November. I thought of sharing this news with you. The award certificate is attached with this mail.

The process of synthesizing nano copper using pure herbal extracts can be exclaimed as 3E process i.e. economical, eco-friendly and efficient technology. By using the herbal/plant extracts the usage of any toxic chemicals and its wastage which is harmful to ground can be avoided. In the whole process, there is no need to use electricity and since the whole process finishes in 15 minutes, the man hours required is also minimal.

***National Award by India Innovation Initiative i3:***

For the first of its kind, SRIVT developed nano materials through herbal route. These nano particles have shown enhanced properties when compared to their modern counter parts. Nano materials of 100 % pure and size ranging from 5-50 nm and yield above 90 % were produced. They have been checked for applications in ship bottom coating which gave encouraging results than conventional nano materials. For this work SRIVT has been given national innovation award by Department of Science and Technology and Confederation of Indian Industry in New Delhi. The nano materials produced by SRIVT are relatively of very low cost and are eco-friendly and energy efficient in synthesizing them. This by so far is very economical in making nano materials in large quantities (scaled up to 5 kgs) and bulk production is possible which is a breakthrough in nano technology area. Through this SRIVT proved that the knowledge enshrined in the ancient Vedas will go a long way in finding effective solutions to the problems threatening Global Society today and will be an eye-opener to the future generations and that the knowledge gained and crystallized by the SRIVT could be converted into Low-cost, High -Efficiency and eco-friendly technologies capable of generating stream of innovative products and services.
