*PraNaamaaH sarvebhyaH*.



the word ***chaalanee*** stands for a sieve. but a filter has a wider connotation. It is a device that separates two things by letting one pass through it but stopping the other. the mixture may be even two gasses

; or evenwords or ideas as used in the internet. In that sense, the word ***chaalanee*** is inapplicable. hence ***shodhakam***, or even ***shodhakee*** would serve a better purpose. the word Host also has several applications

in the English language. Hence the word *aathiteyaH*stands for only one annotation, as one whohosts a party. A host also a carrier of a disease. He is a host to Malarial germs and must be quarantined. A host is a holder of

some things. So the wordsuggested ***aathitheyaH*** will not suit in those senses. So the words ***dhaataa*** or ***dhaarakaH*** may serve in those senses, to convey the real sense.---- srk.
