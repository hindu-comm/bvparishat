Certainly if one knows that these words stand for conveying the connotations of filter or filtering in the native language (British/American/Australian or Indian or International usage), but not for any one who know target language Sanskrit only would get any idea of the filter with these two words. This is my sincere opinion.

  

There are no synonyms exactly in any one language as each has got its own identity in the language, and it would be too far to expect it between the two similar words in two languages belonging to two different cultural and social heritages for the purpose of translation. Only explanations in many cases would convey than some how far fetched and forced translations. In such case, there is no need of a translation of it for understanding host language as he already knows it. This is the common problem of translation between any two languages. The same is the case of Sanskrit English Dictionaries too.
