nama.h pathik.rdbhya.h !

  

It's interesting to note the discussion on filter moving ahead.Truly has Bhart.rhari assumed :

***prajnaa viveka.m labhate bhinnair aagama-dars'anai.h /kiyad vaa s'akyam unnetu.m sva-tarkam anudhaavataa //***

  

The suggestion by Dr Korada Subrhmaniam ,Dr Rani Sadashiva Murthy and Dr S R Krishnamurthy are very welcome in the process to deepen our thought and to make it wide-based.The word 'nisyandanam' in Ayurveda is based on the Vais'e.sika and it deals with drava-dravya.The prefix 'ni' may stand for a regulated method.Aadya-syandanaa'samavaayi-kaara.na.m dravatvam is the definition for anything liquid.This is another matter if it is saa.msiddhika or naimittika.Again,the word is from the aatmanepadii root 'syandU [prasrava.ne](http://prasrava.ne)'.But by extended application this could be used to denote filtering of solid and gaseous material too.'Gaalinii' should be for liquids only and not solids.

  

In Hindi and many other Indian languages we use the expression 'kapa.daa-chaan' in such a case.In O.dis'aa the words 'caa-ch.naa' and 'ghia-cha.naa' or filtering tea or ghee is common.This may be a prakritized form of 'nisyandana' or '[k.saara.na](http://k.saara.na)'as I see it.This word is used for filtering or purifying powdered solid and liquid both.I read in the school science book that when water is impure then the sediment is allowed to settle down and when the water above is poured out slowly in to another pot,this is called '[avasara.na](http://avasara.na)' as the teacher was explaining the English word to us in O.dia.

  

Our dhaatu-s numbering beyond the accepted about 2000 of them indeed speak of our variegated usages over the thousands of years in the sciences and life situations.But certainly we seem to have fallen from grace as we have not kept our great memory alive thus putting the language to disuse.Bhart,rhari rightly observed in anguish :

***daivii vaag vyavakiir.neyam as'aktair abhidhaat.rbhi.h / anitya-dars'inaa.m tveva.m vaade buddhi-viparyaya.h //***

***  
***

Another thing comes to mind that the common expressions are taken up by different s'aastra-s with ascribing specific sense through freedom of stipulation and there it's not objectionable if the technical sense differs from the original primary meaning.

Therefore also any effort to locate the meaning of a word exactly in it's root may not yield the desired result.The Bhaa.sya definitely guides us : anekaarthaa hi dhaatavo bhavanti !

  

Best regards,

SMMishra
