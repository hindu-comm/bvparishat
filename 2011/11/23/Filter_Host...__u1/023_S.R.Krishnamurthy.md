Pranaams.



the word ***Nisyandanam*** (nisyandam) is annotated by V.G.Apte in his dictionary as a ***discharge, stream***. *syandU = prasravaNe iti dhaatuvRuttiH*. Apte says *syand* is to drop. we can deduce therefrom that ***nisyandanam*** is downward flow; [acc.to](http://acc.to) which there is no suggestion of any filtering there. further, the Amarakosha does not include ***nisyandita*** or ***nisyanta*** to indicate the purified; it runs as: ***nirNiktaM shodhitaM mRuShtaM nishshodhyamanavaskaram***.



Moreover today we have filter of terms, and ideas on internet. So we have to look for appropriate words for each application. May the researchers come forward withe their suggestions. - srk
