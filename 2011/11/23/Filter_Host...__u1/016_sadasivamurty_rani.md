Pranams to respected scholars!

I have a humble submission regarding the Sansrkit equivalents of Filter. As found in the Dictionaries the word FILTER is a device used for removing impurities from any liquid or gas. It is not meant for solid substances.

So for such purpose "Nisyandanam" (It is Dantya sakara only but not Talavya sakara as suggested by Shri VKG) is used in Sanskrit. Nisyandanam is the process meant for filtering according to Rasatantra Texts and Ayurvedic texts.

"Where as TATAU" and "GALINI" are mostly meant for solids to get the finest and softest particles of the solids. They are meant for sieving. Though a Sieve or TITAU is sometimes used for liquids it is not called filtering. A SIEVE is said to be a utensil with network or perforated bottom through which liquids or fine particles can pass.

This Sieving process is not so efficient as Filtering in removing the impurities. This is as per my observation of the said texts.

With regards to all,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
