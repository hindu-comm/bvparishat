Pranam

I thank all the scholars for the exhaustive list of suggestions. Titau  
was thought to be Cheta is Telugu/ Mora in Kannada.

Gaalani, Chaalani or Yougika or Roodha - we need to find out.

Another pleasant surprise is that Sri Korada Subrahmanyam garu has  
started using Devanagari fonts, which makes reading his posts  
enjoyable and reduces strain.

Pranams to all the scholars once again.
