Thanks Dr नारायणन ji , Dr Narang जी and other scholars to suggest and clarify the issues regarding caalanii,titau or aatitheya.I shall look to the dictionary to find the IE cognates.Thanks for the good verse by Udbha.ta.  
As per the usage of the word 'host' in different contexts,it is due to semantic extension which is a fact.When we have 'paying guests' now,see what a change has the original connotation of the word 'guest' - 'atithi' has undergone.  
The word 'titau' is a rare one because of it's structure which has seldom a parallel in Sanskrit.Otherwise this could be like 'titavu' or 'titayu'.We look to the U.naadi suutra to find a derivation.Fine,but it's form makes it appear more close to Prakrit expression,which indeed is indicated by the very mantra involving 'titau' in the R.V.  
I couldn't understand why 'lavitra' can't describe S'iva.When [Vi.s.nu](http://Vi.s.nu) could be 'kara.nam,kaara.nam,kartaa' why can't S'iva be 'Lavitram' ?  
Then you say he could be only 'Lavitaa' and not 'Lavitram' as the latter is instrumental only.For [Vi.s.nu](http://Vi.s.nu) 'kara.nam'and 'kaara.nam' are also equally instrumental.Further we advance the logic that it's not so in the lexicon or established usage ! To me an adjective comes to be an epithet and then it tends to be a name.Cf.'yaani naamaani gau.naani' in Vi.s.nusahasranaamastotram.Suppose one writes : 'lokatraya-lavitra.m ta.m kaalaagnirudram ulba.nam' or 'loka-traya-lavitraaya kasmaicin mahase nama.h' - then shouldn't one take it in the sense of S'iva in the context ?  
  
अस्तु तावत, -  
लोकतंत्राश्च ते शब्दा: कवितंत्राश्च ते क्वचित, /  
प्रवृत्तौ बुधतंत्राश्च व्युत्पत्तौ न निरंकुशा: //  
यथैश्वरोSनादिकृत: संकेतो वात्र कारणं /  
आधुनिकै: कृतस्तद्वत्कथं न ग्राहको भवेत् //  
  
Best regards,
