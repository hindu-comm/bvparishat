Dears,

I am surprised why 'pavitra' and 'vivecana' are not mentioned as words  
for 'filter'. The first is used in this sense in many Vedic texts:  
Braahma.nas to Suutras, and even later in ritual texts, though it  
looks this intended meaning of pavitra is hardly understood. It could  
be made of bunch of ku"sa grass or hair of cow or deer, or a piece of  
cloth, depending on the context. For example, when a ku"sapavitra is  
placed on gh.rtapaatra, it is actually meant for filtering the ghee.  
The juice of Soma is filtered using a pavitra made of cow's hairs. The  
second as a noun is found in the Paatravidhi of Lakulii"sa Pa"supatas.  
This text will soon appear as an article in Sa.msk.rtasaadhutaa, a  
Volume in honour of Prof. Aklujkar. But vi-vic in verb forms are used  
in this sense already in Kau.n.dinya's Bhaa.sya. Kau.n.dinya uses  
jalapavitra to mean 'water filter'. I cut and paste a footnote from  
that article:

"I translate vivecana as ‘a cleaning implement’. It can be anything  
instrumental in cleaning that is desired to avoid killing tiny  
creatures, such as a filter, a bunch of feathers, a fan, or the hem of  
one’s cloth. There are passages in Kauṇḍinya’s Bhāṣya and in the  
Ratnaṭīkā, where the root vi+vic is used in the sense of certain types  
of cleaning: vastraśikyabhasmādhārabhaikṣa-bhājanādīni muhur muhur  
vivecayitavyāni. kasmāt. prāṇino hi sūkṣmacāriṇaḥ kṣipram eva vilayaṃ  
prayānti. tasmāt sūkṣmai rāṅkavapavitraiḥ (conj. Sanderson,  
aṅgapavitraiḥ Ed.) pakṣmacāmaratālavṛntair vastrāntair vā muhur muhur  
vi\<vecya> (conj. Sanderson) (Kauṇḍinya’s Bhāṣya on Pāśupatasūtra I.9  
(p.17)); vastrāntādimṛdupavitreṇa vivecya (Ratnaṭīkā p. 19). I am  
grateful to Prof. Sanderson for kindly providing me with these  
references.  
At this point, I would like to note that Kauṇḍinya mentions two  
cleaning implements, one for cleaning the water and the other to clean  
the ground, when he tells us of the marks of an ascetic in general:  
bhikṣos tridaṇḍamuṇḍakamaṇḍalukāṣāyavāsojalapavitrasthalapavitrādi  
liṅgam (Bhāṣya on Pāśupatasūtra I.6 (p.12)). The Pampāmāhātmya, which  
appears to gather materials from earlier Pāśupata sources, also  
mentions both of them (jalasthalapavitre dve, Uttarabhāga 11.43c)."

  
Best,

Diwakar
