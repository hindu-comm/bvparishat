Dear Colleagues,

Yes this is correct!

I followed the interesting discussion on *cālanī* and *titau* with interest. It already struck me that as per Bhānuji Dīkṣita’s commentary on the AK *cālanī* is in the feminine gender and is not formed by *ata ini ṭhanau* or *supy ajātau ṇinis tācchīlye*. Cf., his remarks on AK. 2.9.26^(b) cālanī titaüḥ pumān: *cālyate anayā yā* and at the end of the paragraph on cālanī: *dve* *calanyāḥ*. The adjective *pumān* in the AK refers only to *titaü*.

*Cālanī* is formed with lyuṭ and the long *ī* indicates the rūḍhi gender as in *sammārjanī*, *sammohan**ī*, *godohan**ī*, *samūhanī* etc. Such words are of Vedic origin but later their currency became restricted in literary Sanskrit. Many of them survived in dialects.The ni suffix in NIA languages is a reminder of the Vedic ustage.  

Best
