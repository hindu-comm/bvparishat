Respected Scholars Namaskar:

  

Reference and use of filter appears to have been in use and seems to be be applicable ffor solids as well (R^igveda 10-71-2).  

  

saktu\\'m iva\\\` tita.a\\'unaa pu\\\`nanto\\\` yatra\\\` dhiiraa\\\` mana\\'saa\\\` vaaca\\\`m akra\\'ta \|\\\\  
 atraa\\\` sakhaa\\'yaH sa\\\`khyaani\\' jaanate bha\\\`draiShaaM\\' la\\\`kShmiir nihi\\\`taadhi\\' vaa\\\`ci \|\|{10}{071}{02} \\\\  

  

To me, they (vadika sages) were clearly emphasizing the utility aspect of that "FILTER" for purification, whether it was used for Solids, Liquids or for language (vaak). Therefore could we not regard grammar as as sieve, a filter that enables one to retain and understand the core meaning of the statements !?  

  

Any additional thoughts would be highly appreciated.

  

I would like to understand the term "anvadhyaayam" that has been used for vaidika language.  

  

Thanks you all in advance,

  

Best regards,  

  

Dr. Yadu
