Namaste.

  

Someone told me that the names 'Lavit' and 'Lavitra' are those of Lord Shiva. I request the scholars of this group to please explain to me with references if these names indeed pertain to Lord Shiva. The correct Sanskrit forms of these names could also by mentioned.

  

With thanks and warm regards,
