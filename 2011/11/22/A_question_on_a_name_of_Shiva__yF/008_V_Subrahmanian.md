I thank all the scholars who have responded so far with their views.
The question originated due to the names found in the following:

  

[http://hindubabynames. childnamesworld.com/babynames. php?religion=hindu&gender=boy& alphabet=l&pageno=8](http://hindubabynames.childnamesworld.com/babynames.php?religion=hindu&gender=boy&alphabet=l&pageno=8)

  

Since I wanted an authentication I posed the question.
