*अर्ति*-*लू*-धू-सू-खन-*सह*-*चर*इत्रः । । ३,२.१८४ । ।

  

The word लवित्र is derived in the sense of any cutter, or destroyer broadly. But I can't say about लवित् formation, but the formation would be लवितृ - लविता, लवितारौ लवितारः can be derived with तृन् one who cuts. and not lavit or lavitra as you have mentioned. The first seems to be impossible and the second "lavitra" is derived in the sense of any instrument for cutting and doesn't denote the agent of the action. लवितृ - would be the agent of lavana (cutting) and you will have to find the corresponding epithet with reference to apply it to shiva. Otherwise it would not be possible. It is not among the popular epithets of Shiva known in lexicons as I know.  
  
If your friend can come up such an usage with precise meaning applicable to Shiva, it can be further considered.
