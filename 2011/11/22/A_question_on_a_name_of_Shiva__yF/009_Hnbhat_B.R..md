Anyhow it is not an authentic source to be quoted in bvparishat. I  
wanted the reliable authentic source if any.

There are many other names posted in these similar websites and people  
asking for their meaning in sanskrit. "Lavitra" unless othewise  
required by the Puranic context, will denote any cutting instrument  
only and not any God in that particular and it is not popular also in  
the lexicons.

1lavit- could not be found in any Sanskrit Dictionary. If found  
anywhere in other authentic sources in Sanskrit or in any language, it  
is welcome always.

As to Piyali Dikshit's proposal, it can be any god and not  
specifically Shiva. as is clear in the following definition of  
bhagavat:

  
utpattiM pralayaM caiva bhUtAnaam agatiM gatim/  
vetti vidyaam avidyaam ca sa vaacyo bhagavaan iti//

unless it is warranted in any Upanishat like tajjalaan.
