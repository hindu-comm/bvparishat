Indus script inscription on the gold pendant.  
  
Decoding (rebus mleccha) of inscription on pendant  
  
kana, kanac = corner (Santali); kañcu = bronze (Te.) sal ‘splinter’; sal ‘workshop’ (Santali)  
dāṭu ‘cross’ (Te.); dhātu = mineral (Skt.)  
Four + three strokes are read (since the strokes are shown on two lines one below the other) : gaṇḍa ‘four’ (Santali); rebus: ‘furnace, kaṇḍ fire-altar’; kolmo ‘three’ (Mu.); rebus: kolami ‘smithy’ (Te.) Vikalpa: ?ea ‘seven’ (Santali); rebus: ?eh-ku ‘steel’ (Te.)  
  
Thus, the inscription is:*kancu sal*(bronze workshop),*dhatu aya kaṇḍ kolami*mineral, metal, furnace/fire-altar smithy.  
  
The inscription is a professional calling card -- describing professional competence and ownership of specified items of property -- of the wearer of the pendant.  
  
There are many miniature tablets of Harappa which show that the inscriptions were inscised onto the objects.

Lal The Indus Script: Some Observations Based on Archaeology, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 2 (1975), pp. 173-177Published by: Cambridge University Press. "The overriding of the signs shows that the direction of writing was from right to left," notes BB Lal.

Sealings of baked clay from Kalibangan. They carry the same legend and do not bear any reed- or cord-marks on the reverse.

"Inscribed potsheds from Kalibangan. The example at top left would suggest that, in all probability, the V-like sign is derivable from the shape of a vase," says BB Lal.<http://www.docstoc.com/docs/103144662/bblalindusscript19752-10>
