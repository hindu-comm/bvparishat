 I haven't had a chance to go through the whole thing yet, but right at the beginning I see a problem. The author seems to confuse the world of the Vedas with the world in which the *Bhashyakaras* lived. The two are not the same. Anone who comments on the Vedas (and that includes me) is a Bhashyakara of sort. We cannot extend the infallibility of apaurusheya (impersonal) knowledge to the views of the Bhashyakaras. No Bhashya is apaurusheya.



 Science and Veda are not opposed-- they have nothing that stand in opposition to one another. I happen to be a Western trained scientist. But I don't oppose the Vedas for that reason. Only I oppose invoking the Veda or any scripture (necessarily paurusheya) in science as proof. It is a subtle point though-- I have used metaphysical concepts from Vedanta (of Shankara and Madhva) in trying to understand some paradoxes arising in explaining quantum reality. These have been well received by the scientific community probablybecause I have taken some care to state them clearly.



 I may have more to say in due course. I am grateful to Sri Ganesh for bringing this to my attention.
