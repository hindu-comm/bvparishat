Respected Professor Krishnamurthy and Professor P.K.Mishra,

  

I admit that it was a mistake in my part that I could not produce the scripts in a proper way due to lack of font support. Beacuse I sent it from Windows XP with a pretext that everything appears on one's machine is universal, as I failed install the Brahmi and Grantha fonts in Linux, whereas Linux normally provides Unicode fonts of currently used languages only. I regret over the disturbance caused if any for the group readers due to the appearance of Roman characters without having any meaning matching to the given title. I hope I can produce Brahmi characters for your kind help within a week's time. I assure you that I will test them with my own mail as an experiment and will be send in public only if the characters are correct. Thanks for valuable directions.  

Regards,

Narayanan
