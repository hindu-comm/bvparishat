### Decoding fish and ligatured-fish glyphs of Indus script (S. Kalyanaraman, November 2011)

Background  
  
Stastistical analyses on ‘fish’ and related glyphs on Indus writing system are presented in two recent issues of Bulletin of the Indus Research Centre: No. 1 (Sept. 2009), The Indus script: text and context, a stastical-positional analysis of significant text segments by Sundar Ganesan et al.; No. 2 (August 2011), The Indus fish swam in the great bath: a new solution to an old riddle by Iravatham Mahadevan. Both monographs assume that signs have to be distinguished from pictorial motifs (or field symbols) for determining the semantics of the messages conveyed by the script. Positional analysis of ‘fish’ glyphs has also been presented in: The Indus Script: A Positional-statistical Approach By Michael Korvink, 2007, Gilund Press.

A hypothesis of this monograph that both signs and pictorial motifs are integral parts of the messages of Indus script. Both types of glyphs are read rebus to decode the Indus inscriptions of Indus language compiled by artisans (e.g. lapidaries, smiths) of the civilization.  
  
Susa of Mesopotamian civilization received (ca. 3rd millennium BCE) a pot containing metal artefacts shown in the figure. The pictures are thanks to Prof. Maurizio Tosi who made a presentation on the interaction areas of the civilization in an international conference in Delhi (2010). <http://www.docstoc.com/docs/63999062/sarasvatiinteractionareas>  
  
The pot and its contents had perhaps originated from Meluhha since the pot had a ‘fish’ glyph inscribed. I suggest that this Indus script glyph conveyed the message from Indus artisans to merchant associates of Susa, that the pot had ‘metal’ contents. The glyph is read rebus in mleccha (cognate, meluhha), the underlying Indus language. ayo ‘fish’; rebus: ayo ‘metal’. With this decoding framework of Indus script cipher, the ligatured-fish glyphs can also be read in the context of metal artifacts archaeologically attested of the bronze-age civilization.  
  
Argument

Picture of Susa pot (cf. Maurizio Tosi) is, in my view, a ‘rosetta stone’ of Indus script. Other ‘rosetta stones’ such as the tin ingots with Indus script glyphs are discussed in the book, Indus script cipher (2010) by S. Kalyanaraman<http://tinyurl.com/6f49g49>  
  
Any decipherment of Indus script has to consistently explain the writing irrespective of the objects on which the writing is presented.  
  
Mahadevan has to explain his reading of the ‘meaning’ of the fish and related glyphs in the context of the inscribed fish glyph on the Susa pot.
