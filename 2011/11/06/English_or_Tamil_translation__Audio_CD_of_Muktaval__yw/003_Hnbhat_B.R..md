Sorry. I have got the pdf file of the NyayasiddhantaMuktavali Edited with English Translation by E. Roer (1850). I had downloaded it from DLI.net. and I have converted into pdf. If needed, I can give the link to download the pdf.  

Here is the link to the parental Directory of DLI:

from which the image files can be downloaded.
