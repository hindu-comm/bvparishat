The file contains just the text portion only and is not critically edited. But only the text portion, as the initial label makes it clear, might have consulted for typing in the text details are given..

  

Just I meant, it can be used for searching the words within the file using Devanagari Unicode fonts and didn't mean that it is prepared for research purpose. It is for only for personal use and not for any critical publication that it is prepared..
