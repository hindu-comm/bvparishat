My sinceremost thanks to Dr.s H.N.Bhat, Rani Sadashiv Murty and Surendra Mohan Mishra. I have not yet downloaded them but I am sure that this will help. My own book edited by Mm. Pañcānana Tarkaratna seems to be a bit outdated. Hence this request.  

Please do not hesitate ask for any academic assistance from me that I can render through the BVP.

Gratitude to and best wishes for all

Sincerely

Dipak Bhattacharya
