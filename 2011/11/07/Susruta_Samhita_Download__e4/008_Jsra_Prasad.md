Sir,  
  
Pranam. Just for your information! [National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage](http://iihm.ap.nic.in/), Hyderabad (erstwhile IIHM) has produced CDs on Charakam and Sushrutam at an affordable price. Both are digitized with Chakrapani and Dalhana's commentaries in Sanskrit. You may contact the Director for details.  
  
Otherwise, [I-SERVE](http://www.serveveda.org/), Hyderabad has also prepared a CD on Charaka Samhita with search facilities.  
  
Its an irony that no critical edition is available on any Ayurveda text. A research group in Switzerland seems to working on critical edition of Charakam with 50 manuscripts.  
  
Can you please give us the details of your own publication?  
  
Thanks,  
Prasad
