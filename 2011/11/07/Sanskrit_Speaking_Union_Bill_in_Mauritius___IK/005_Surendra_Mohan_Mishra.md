Thanks.Sanskrit belongs to no party or government in particular.In Rajasthan it was during a Congress govt that a position of a state rank minister especially for Sanskrit was created and still continues till date.M.P. has also such a provision.  
In a meeting of the Samskrit Bharati I noted that the one of the cases of best progress in Sanskrit propagation is being achieved in Kerala.The Muslims at Deoband have since years a Sanskrit Suraksha Samiti as it has recently brought out a Sanskrit translation of the Quran authored by a Muslim girl.My point is that those who fear that by taking to Sanskrit and her popularization they would be unpopular with the masses are wrong.Either they lack conviction or they lack the guts to convince others like Swami Vivekananda or or a present David Frawley (Pandit Vamadeva Shastri ) or many more before and after,the list is unending !  
Warm regards,  
SMMishra
