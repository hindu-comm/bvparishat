Dear Sir,  
  
Thanks for adding more information to the context.  
It is really admiring to know that a minister works for the  
cause of Sanskrit in Rajasthan. As you said, it is no wonder  
when one can see Muslim girls studying Nyaya, Vedanta, Vyakarana  
in places like Tripunitura.  
  
I like your last comment. Yes, they don't have either Conviction  
or GUTS. Is 'Vishvwa Guru' has become and want to remain as'Vishwa  
Sishya'?  
(taking the precedence of Pakistan, Germany and Mauritius)  
  
Dhanyosmi,  
Prasad
