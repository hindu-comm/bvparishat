To continue the list of esteemed Prof. Sharma ji and to join with dear JSR Prasad, in our times the state of Uttarakhand is the first state to declare Sanskrit as the second official language.The other states and the centre ought to follow justifying the great mottoes - like 'satyam eva jayate' - on which we have established ourselves as a great nation uniquely connected to our more than ten thousand years of culture and civilization.Sanskrit is undoubtedly that golden mean and connect ! Our soul is convinced as everyday new research is pouring out lending evidence to the unimpeachable might of eternal Samskrit.But how long more shall we take to accept this in action?  
Best Regards.
