Sir,  
  
Thanks for this important information. Indeed, it seemed a 'vision document' of the said project, that has been officially gazetted. It was context relative when mighty Hanuman said to himself -  

यदि वाचं प्रदास्यामि द्विजातिरिव संस्कृताम् ।  
रावणं मन्यमाना मां सीता भीता भविष्यति ।।  

Imagine, Indian political system, quite often than not, frightened whenever there is a rightful agitation in support of Sanskrit in India. And the oppression continues victimizing Sanskrit. May be, two significant gestures of governments are apparent, post independence - 1. Declaring year 2000 as Sanskrit year and 2. The leftist government in Kerala is broad hearted to start a Sanskrit University.  

  
With Regards
