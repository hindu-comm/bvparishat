2. The leftist government in Kerala is broad hearted to start a Sanskrit University.  

  

dear sir ,  
 regarding your second observation I would like to bring to your notice to the fact that it is not a leftist government which established a sanskrit university in kerala, but a congress government headed by late Sri K. Karunakaran with the blessings of the then prime minister of india late Sri.Narasimha Rao was instrumental in establishing it. It's first vice chancellor was the then chief secretory Sri R. Ramachandran Nair . As usual left were dead against it and opposed it with tooth and nail.  
  
with regards,
