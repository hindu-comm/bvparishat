Respected Scholars,  
  
Namaste. Forwarding a link on deciphering Sanskrit equivalents of Indus Valley seals.  
It is claimed that certain 'rebus principle' is used in doing so. Its definition in the page  
is as follows -  
  
"In linguistics, the Rebus principle means using existing symbols, such as pictograms, purely for their sounds regardless of their meaning, to represent new words. Many ancient writing systems used the rebus principle to represent abstract words, which otherwise would be hard to be represented by pictograms."  
  
What was also interesting is to note this sloka:  
हिमालयं समारभ्य यावदिन्दुसरोवरम् ।  
तं देवनिमित्तं देशं **हिन्दुस्तानं** प्रचक्षते ।। (बृहस्पत्यागमः)  
Of course, this was just a reference in that page.  
  
I never followed any discussion on this topic, you may ignore this information if already its been discussed.  
  
Regards  
Prasad
