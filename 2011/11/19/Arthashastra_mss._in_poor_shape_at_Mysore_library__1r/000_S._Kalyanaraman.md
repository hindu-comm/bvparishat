One of the prized treatises on statecraft and economy, Arthashastra, has been lying in a state of near danger at Mysore's Oriental Research Institute.  
  
MYSORE: After ensuring that one of the oldest global treatises on statecraft and economic policy was reinstated for posterity, the Oriental Research Institute (ORI), Mysore, is on the verge of losing one of the earliest available manuscripts of Kautilya's Arthashastra. It's falling victim to maladministration and the vagaries of time.  
  
The discovery of the manuscript of the 4th-century BC work from a heap of palm-leaf manuscripts, by scholar Rudrapatnam Shamasastry who published it in 1909, resulted in historians the world over acknowledging that India did have an enviable textual history.  
  
A century later, the 450-year-old manuscript is now peeling off. "It is in great danger. There is not even a locker to keep it safe," sources at ORI informed The Times of India. The national treasure is merely wrapped in a cloth and kept in a cabinet, they said. A lone guard keeps watch during night at the institute.  
  
Arthashastra and about 60,000 other manuscripts at the institute came close to being reduced to ashes in two fire accidents sparked by short-circuit in 1996 and 1998. Sadly, till date, the manuscripts have not been secured in fireproof chambers.  
  
A fumigation machine donated by the Ford Foundation to protect manuscripts from insects, fungi and algae is not working. ORI has neither funds nor autonomy, the sources said. "There is a crisis, and we are seeking funds to address it," admitted ORI director M Shivakumaraswamy. "Presently, all we are doing to preserve the manuscript is by way of oil treatment. But more needs to be done."  
  
ORI lacks funds to maintain script  
  
The neglect, according to sources in the ORI, is because the institute has neither funds nor autonomy. A cultural specialist at US consulate general in Chennai, Ratna Mukherjee, had visited ORI recently and promised to get special funds, he said, adding they have also approached the varsity.  
  
The institute was established as Oriental Library in 1891 by then Mysore Maharaja, Chamaraja Wodeyar. It became Oriental Research Institute in 1943 and is attached to Mysore University since 1916. Among the prized possessions of the ORI are an original oil painting of Saraswathi by Raja Ravi Verma, Sharada Tilaka, Natya Shastra and Natya Manjari.  
  
rediscovery of Arthashastra According to Sanskrit scholar S Jagannath, an expert in manuscripts, the ORI manuscript of Arthashastra is at least 450 years old. These manuscripts have a lifespan of 700 years, he said. The manuscript, believed to be a reproduction from the original, was given by an unidentified Tanjore scholar to the institute.  
  
Shamasastry edited the manuscript and published it in 1909. Arthashastra's publication led to paradigm changes in the study of ancient treaties as till then Niccolo Machiavelli's 15th-century work, The Prince, was believed to be one of the oldest authentic texts on the subject. Shamasastry went on to become an Indologist of great repute, giving the institute, in the process, a brand value.
