Greetings,



The syndicate members of University of Mysore are a bunch of jokers. The VC is also helpless and there is huge discrimination on caste, no one is worried in university about the status of the manuscripts, but they always are engaged in playing caste politics. We went and offered help to conserve, digitize free of cost and they made us run for 6 years. We had also requested ISRO to set up the base station there and ISRO promptly had given all equipments and a huge bandwidth to ISRO to put up in the EDUSAT programme, the equipments rusted in one of the departments due to caste politics played by previous director Prof. Devaki. VC's hands were tied as the syndicate member one called Gopinath created ruckus and stopped as they said that the whole initiative is led by "brahmins". This is the kind of leadership the university has and respect towards the Indian Cultural heritage.



regards,

Ramachandra Budihal.

Dear sir,



There is no iota of doubt that the officials of Mysore University are not taking required care regarding the manuscript used by Dr. R.Shyamasastry.Apart frompraising ORI to the sky for huge manuscript collection, authorities are not doinganything.Some organizations like RCL(Regional Conservation Laboratory ) had submittedproposal forpreservation of the manuscript. But unfortunately the former officials did not show interest.I hope at least now the officials of University will open their eyes.



**Among the prized possessions of the ORI are an original oil painting of Saraswathi by Raja Ravi Verma, Sharada Tilaka, Natya Shastra and Natya Manjari.  
**  
I do not know who said this to Mr.Aravind. ORI does not have original oil painting of Saraswathi by Raja Ravi Verma. Which NatyaManjari he is talking about ?



Mr.Aravind did not meet me personally. He conversed with me on telephone for only one minute ! I did not say that the manuscript of
Arthashsastra isexactly 450 years old. Itold that ms. of Arthashastra *may be* 400 years old. He added 50 years ! I thinkcarbon dating is necessary to know the exact date of the manuscript of Arthashastra.



He saidthat hewants to bring this matter to the notice of Governor of Karnataka.



Let us hope that the outcome will be best protection for the manuscript.



Since Mr.Aravind mentioned my name in the report, I had togive some clarifications.



SJ
