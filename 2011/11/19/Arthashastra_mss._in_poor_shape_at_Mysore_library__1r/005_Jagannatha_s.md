The descriptive catalogue declares thatcondition ofa ms. is good. But when we see the actual ms. we wind that the ms.is in dilapidated condition which means that the condition of ms.*was* good when the DC was prepared. This is very unfortunate that in spite of availability of trained persons inmanuscript preservation,the authorities are not appointing them. Some organizations like Mahabharata Samshodhana Pratishthana have very sophisticated equipments and they are ready to do neat job. But the non- cooperation of the concerned authorities is main obstacle as Sri Ramachandra Budihal hasalready informed.Manuscript preservation requires more than oiling. The sooner the officials realize this the better. Actually this is very serious matter. In couple of decades, all the manuscripts (that are not properly looked after) of
our country will be on the verge of destruction. Because of heavy traffic, thick dust is formed on the manuscripts at ORI, Mysore.Officials are not taking this dangerous situation seriously. Instead of appointing trained bodies in manuscript preservation, theysometimes conduct manucriptological workshops where manuscript preservation is one of the subjects!!This is ridiculous.Let them realize that taking care ofphysical safety of manuscripts is more important than conducting workshops.
