Dear sir,



There is no iota of doubt that the officials of Mysore University are not taking required care regarding the manuscript used by Dr. R.Shyamasastry.Apart frompraising ORI to the sky for huge manuscript collection, authorities are not doinganything.Some organizations like RCL(Regional Conservation Laboratory ) had submittedproposal forpreservation of the manuscript. But unfortunately the former officials did not show interest.I hope at least now the officials of University will open their eyes.



**Among the prized possessions of the ORI are an original oil painting of Saraswathi by Raja Ravi Verma, Sharada Tilaka, Natya Shastra and Natya Manjari.  
**  

I do not know who said this to Mr.Aravind. ORI does not have original oil painting of Saraswathi by Raja Ravi Verma. Which NatyaManjari he is talking about ?



Mr.Aravind did not meet me personally. He conversed with me on telephone for only one minute ! I did not say that the manuscript of
Arthashsastra isexactly 450 years old. Itold that ms. of Arthashastra *may be* 400 years old. He added 50 years ! I thinkcarbon dating is necessary to know the exact date of the manuscript of Arthashastra.



He saidthat hewants to bring this matter to the notice of Governor of Karnataka.



Let us hope that the outcome will be best protection for the manuscript.



Since Mr.Aravind mentioned my name in the report, I had togive some clarifications.



SJ
