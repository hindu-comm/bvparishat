Dear scholars. I am a research student working on Gajashastra. Even I came across the same with my work. According to the records there were two works of Hastyayurveda while only one is available and the other was not found even when the scholars tried to locate. So this manuscript treasure has to be maintained properly. The scholars are very helpful to others but helpless to the manuscripts.

While at TSSM/Tanjore, some of the manuscripts have been handwritten and named as RV which means REWRITTEN VERSION. Some of the Manuscripts pertaining to my subject are totally dilapidated and are totally reduced to pieces.  

Dhanyavad.
