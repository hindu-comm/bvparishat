Romanized script for Sanskrit and Defend Sanskrit instead labeling others!



Reference--- posting by Dr.Tirumal Kulkarni-Attack on Sanskrit and Brahmins. At the end of that article there is website. Ivisited it briefly. The author (looks like a Sindhi man) would like to develop Romanized script for Sindhi language. In India it is repeatedly said Sanskrit is presented with many different scripts of India. With spread of Internet and computers, if somebody from newgeneration like this author starts promoting Romanized script for all languages of India including Sanskrit, how Indian people will react to that situation? Is not computerization of Sanskrit is small step in that direction? I saw this trend in few other countries. I do not recommend it. But it may happen.



Attack on Sanskrit- Please defend Sanskrit- On this list it is written several times that Sanskrit words have multiple meanings. Upasargas have multiple meanings. Samaasas can be broken in different ways. Is this true or not? Please do not misunderstand me. I do not support the author of that article. But instead of defending Snskrit by giving appropriate example, you are labeling the author.



Labeling others-this is India did for thousands of years calling others Vris'ala, Mlenccha, Yavan (mixed race). This labelingwas not meant for only outsiders, it was used within the boundaries of the subcontinent.



Dr. Veeranarayan Pandurangi posted article of 1915 on the time of Patanjali. In that article there is one paragraph-in it it is said in Mahabhasya that those who worship 33 vedic godswere Aryans and other like Moryas (idol worshippers) who wander from door to door were non-Aryans. If I am interpreting that paragraph wrongly, then somebody who read that English article of 1915, pleasepresent heredirect corresponding Sanskrit lines from Mahabhasya. It is well known that Vratyas were called non-aryans in ancient India. Kikata people were called non aryans (I think-Yaska)I am not saying this was case of racial discrimination like European authors. However it throws light on different tribes (who were practicingdifferent customs)inthe ancient India. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
