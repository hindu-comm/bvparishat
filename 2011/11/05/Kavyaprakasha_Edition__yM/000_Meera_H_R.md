Namaste.

  

I would like to know where (which library / individual) I can find a copy of Kavya Prakasha edited by Sri. Gajendra Gadkar (especially Ullasa-s 4-9). There is an abridged version containingUllasa-s1,2,3,&10 by the same scholar. I am looking for **the entire (or at least Ullasa-s 4-9)**Kavya Prakasha as annotated by him.

  

Thank you.

  

With regards,

Meera
