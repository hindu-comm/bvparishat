As far as my information goes, Gajendragadkar translated, annotated and critiqued only the ullaasas that were prescribed as a textbook at the U of Bombay. A criticism of his critique is found in a Marathi edn of the same ullaasas by K.S. Arjunwadkar and A.G. Mangaruu.lakara/Mangrulker, published in 1962 in Pune by Deshmukh Prakashan.
