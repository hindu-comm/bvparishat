Thanks for the kind information.I indeed remember my association with the late Prof. Dipak Ghosh and retain some of his works which he offered to me.I have also listened to his cassettes which also contained Sanskrit Gitanjali.One thing I found that those translators who have no direct access to Bengali language have tried to be true to the translated version of the original,but have often missed the emotion.If it's a blank verse or metric translation in Sanskrit the diction,meter and most importantly the subtle emotion must be the focus so that one is as close to the heart of the great master.Dipak dada was apparently better as he followed the tone and melody of the original.While Tagore translated his Gitanjali into English,as I know,it was W.B.Yeats who read through and suggested some alterations for rendering the expression more elegant.Translation is in fact a highly technical job : kavir eva vijaanaati kave.h karma na caapara.h !I think there must be a working bibliography of Tagore's works and their renderings in other languages along with the research works carried out on his great literature.I would very much like to read the Navadvipa Naiyayika's translation ! Best regards,SMMishra
