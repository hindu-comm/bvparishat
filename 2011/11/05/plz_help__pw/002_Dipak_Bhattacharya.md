There are quite a few translations done in Eastern India. One of the latest was by late Professor Dr. Dipak Ghosh of the University of Calcutta who translated the poems and put them into tune after Tagore. He demonstrated them through performances in a few cities in India. As far as I remember the Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar published some of them. A Sanskrit Pandit of Assam translated them in the early nineties. The Visva Bharati had till then a monopoly over Tagore's writings. I examined them and found them to be of good quality and was instrumental in securing the Visva Bharati's permission to publish them. But the translator, whose letters are with the Visva Bharati, did not contact me after their publication.  Long before them a reputed Naiyayika of Navadviipa (Ajit Nyaayaratna) first translated Tagore's poems in Gitanjali into Sanskrit. He printed them under private enterprise. I have with me translations done in the early twentieth century. They are worn out and a bit pinholed so that the publication details are missing.
