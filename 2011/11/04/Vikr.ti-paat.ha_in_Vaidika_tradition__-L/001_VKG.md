Dear Professor!  
Sri Iyengar!  
  
Pranam. I am delighted to see new aspects/ points of research such as  
correlation between square roots and Varga.  
  
As you have rightly pointed out, Varga is made for the convenience of  
the learner. It has equitable distribution of Mantras. As the name  
Ashtaka denotes, it consists of 8 Chapters (Adhyayas). Thus 10  
Mandalas are divided into 8 Ashtakas.  
  
Each Adhyaya has a number of Contextual groupings of Suktas (which are  
common for both the systems); Mantras (Rik) categorised as Vargas have  
a general grouping of Five per Varga.  
  
Hence, the Maharshi based Mandalas (uneven in size and form) may  
scatter across Ashtakas.  
  
Jaya Guru Datta
