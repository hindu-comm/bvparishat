Report on Mahabharata presentation



Dear Shree S. R.Krishnamurthy, It was nice that you wrote about your work in your posting. Do you have science degree? It is just curiosity. It helps to understand certain concepts. And if you do not have it, it makes no difference. On each of your work, please write at leastone paragraph at your convenience to make readers of BVP understand your efforts.



You talked about Ramayana. Now I will talk briefly about Mahabharata. Indian scholars have produced critical edition of Mahabharata. Many may not agree with it.It is expected that scholars differ. That way the front of knowledge advances. Now about my presentation in Houston. Before presentation my heart was racing fast. It is always dilemma-what people will think about you when you handle subjects of Mahabharata (and Ramayana) so dear to the hearts of almost all Indians.



As I mentioned before presentation included slides from the countries of the whole Asia. Not many Indians think that there could be connection of Mahabharata beyond the boundary of the subcontinent. Outside nameswere also unfamiliar to audience. After presentation one gentleman and his wife said to me that they were glad to seeDr. Amartya Sen was wrong calling Krishna mythological. But along with came with very disturbing slides on the last days of Krishna. That was hard for at least one senior gentleman who asked me after presentation-did you believe in god?. If yes, you would not have done this research. Vyaasa composed Mahabharata and Vaalmiki Ramayana and that's it. No research on that!



However after some people left, young people doctors, university students more in favor of accepting new ideas, they gathered around me, took my phone number and said thatthey will call me,they would like to know more. This is so because time for presentation was one hour (luxury in USA) and not all points can be explained in this very sensitive subject. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Respected Scholars,

Writing on the above subject, Dr. N.R.Joshi has appended to my name the appellation of Dr. I would like to humbly point out that I do not hold any such title. I am just a researcher, who ventured into research to find
