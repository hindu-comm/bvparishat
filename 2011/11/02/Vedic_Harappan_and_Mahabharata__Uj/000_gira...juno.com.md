Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



The book ,"Vedic Harappan" is very comprehensive. Dr. Bhagwan Singh has collected a lot of information in this single book. He has listed Sanskrit words from all walks of ancient life in India, navigation, trade, military terminology, weapons, almost everything is here and well presented in the support of his thesis-enterprising ancient Indians colonized the region west of the subcontinent. Vedic references are given.



On the page 13 of the book, "Migration of some leading houses of Iran from Ganga Valley is of course attested(Herzfeld 1947)" The reference of Herzfeld is given.



Herzfeld offers the names of the dynasties of Persia of the known history (540 BC) and also adds that these dynasties were related to Mahabharata dynasties of India. Their names are inscribed in rocks in Persia. This is a great puzzle. How in the known history we find presence of Mahabharata dynasties in Persia but no trace in India at the time of 54O BC. ( If we have definite evidence contrary to my thoughts, please let me know).The war was between Kurus and Srinjayas. Both were present in the ancient history of the Middle-East.The names of these dynasties I reported in my earlier postings on BVP. I have shown all this in my power point presentation in 2010 in Pune-Evidence of Mahabharata outside of the subcontinent.

Thanks. N.R.Joshi
