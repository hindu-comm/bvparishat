 This is an illiterate rant based on missionary propaganda. It does not merit a refutation but I will just take up one point-- his claim that "**The language of theSindhu or Indus Valley Civilization has still not been deciphered, precisely because it had existed much beforethe emergence of Sanskrit. The language of Sindhu Valley Civilization could not have vanished if it had been derived from Sanskrit."**



 That is precisely the point-- **it has not vanished,** because it still exists in the form of Sanskrit and the many Prakrits down to the present day. He also confuses script with language. Sanskrit was (and is) written in many different scripts. I havce a complete *Valamiki Ramayana* in Kannada script, but the language is still Sanskrit. (Incidentally Valmiki was not borna Brahmin but a hunter.)



 We should publicize such creatures and their writing, it will discredit the whole tribe. This is what Witzelites used P.N. Oak's work for. It was this kind of writing by Hindu enthusiasts that hurt our case in the California school dispute. There was a book by a self-appointed religious guru called *The True History of Hinduism* in which he claimed that Hinduism was over 3 trillion years old! (The age of the universe is estimated to be 14 billion years.)



 Our enemies exhibited it as the kind of religious obscurantism that would be introduced in the revised curriculum. It also helps Hinduphobics like Doniger to present their version as scholarly work.



 You cannot separate Indus (or Harappan) archaeology from the literature from the same region, namely the Vedic. It is like separating Egyptian archaeology from Egyptian literary records.
