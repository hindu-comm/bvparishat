Subject: \[INDOLOGY\] De Nobili Research Library Prize for 2012  
To: [INDO...@liverpool.ac.uk]()  
  
  
Announcing the “De Nobili Research Library Prize” for 2012  
  
  
The association „De Nobili Research Library – Association for Indology and  
the Study of Religion”, Vienna, aims to promote research on Indian  
religions, especially from the point of view of the mutual encounter  
between Christian spirituality as well as Christianity and Western thought  
in general, and the various manifestations of Indian religiosity. To  
further this aim, the Association disseminates the results of such  
research through the organisation of symposia and public lectures, and  
especially through its two publication series (see  
<http://www.istb.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/sdn/sdn.cgi>).  
  
This year, the Association decided to promote its aims in still another  
way. It herewith announces, for the first time, an essay competition.  
Students, young researchers and others interested in the Christian  
encounter with Indian religions are cordially invited to submit an essay  
on the topic “Dimensions of the Christian Encounter with the Religions of  
India: Aims, Possibilities, Ramifications”. The previously unpublished  
essays may be written in English or German, and should amount to  
approximately 18,000 words. A prize committee consisting of members of the  
Association and an external referee will evaluate the submitted essays in  
a double-blind review process. The best essay will be awarded with the “De  
Nobili Research Library Prize” for 2012; the prize money amounts to €  
2,500. The prize may be shared by two winners.  
  
Essays should be formatted in 12 pt, with 1.5 line spacing, and submitted  
in PDF-format until May 20, 2012, the 407th anniversary of Roberto de  
Nobili’s arrival in India, to the Deputy Secretary of the Association, Dr.  
Marcus Schmücker, at [Marcus.S...@oeaw.ac.at]().  
  
With best regards,  
  
Karin Preisendanz, Chairperson of the Association

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
