It is not that anvyaya is ok but only the samaasa is not permissible. The rule samartha.h padavidhi.h refers to all types of anvaya. The impermissibility of dvandva here too is ultimately an anvayadosha = syntactical defect, because matsyaghoshau itself can be a dvandba samaasa. It is not permissible here in this sentence. That is the main point in the construction. It is simply unable to yield a sense as a vaakya. Each word taken sundrly will give a meaning but not the whole as an organised sentence. That makes the samaasa asamarthitaa.srita
