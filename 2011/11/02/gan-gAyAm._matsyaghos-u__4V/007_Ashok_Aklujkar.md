Such sentences have been discussed since the time of Pata;jali (dhava-khadira-palaa;saa;s chidyantaam etc.). A sophisticated elaboration is found in the V.rtti-samudde;sa of the Prakiir.naka-kaa.n.da of Bhar.r-hari. There are modern studies of this chapter (in addition to translations by K.A. Subramania Iyer et al) by Mithilesh Chaturvedi and M. Srimannarayana Murti, among possibly others. Kindly check:

  

*Bhart®hari: Language, Thought and Reality.*(ed) Chaturvedi, Mithilesh. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass.(the bibliography at the end under "Murti")

  

and the 1976 and 1999 surveys of research on Paa.nini by George Cardona (under "Narayana Murti, M.S." in the first).
