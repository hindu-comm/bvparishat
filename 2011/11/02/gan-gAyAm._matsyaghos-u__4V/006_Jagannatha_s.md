Respected scholars!

Thank you all for your śāstric responses. I learnt many things from the postings of Dr. Veeranarayana Pandurangi,Prof.subrahmanyam Korada, andDr.Dipak Bhattacharya. Thank yousirs for enlightening me on *yugapad vṛttidvayavirodha.*Now, what about *nagare rāmakṛṣ**ṇ**au* *staḥ* ? How does a single verb make two sentences? What is the śāstric difference between *rāmakṛṣṇ**au* *staḥ* and *rāmaḥ asti kṛṣ**ṇaḥ ca*? Is dvandvasamāsa belongs to the category of
asamarthasamāsa ? (The moment we here the sentence *rāmakṛṣṇ**au* *staḥ* we assume that this is single sentense.) I sincerely apologize all of you, if I did not catch clearly your responses.

SJ
