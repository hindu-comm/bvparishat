Dear Jagannathji,

So far as the sentence is concerned in *nagare rāmakṛṣṇau* *staḥ there is only abhidhāvṛtti. There may be rūḍhilakṣaṇā but that is as good as abhidhā.*

*Moreover, the rule samarthaḥ padavidhiḥ is not a bookish rule to be applied after hair-breadth vicāra that will not be intelligible to any layman. The rule is one based on common sense that will be clear even to a child beginning to understand language analysis. Just test whether it gives sense or is barred by common sense i.e. whether the pre-samāsa and post-samāsa sentences/phrases are intelligible and conforming to practice and rules. There are two sentences in nagare rāmakṛṣṇau* *staḥ -- nagare rāmaḥ asti and nagare kṛṣṇaḥ asti. The meaning is clear and abādhita. Now apply the padavidhi cārthe dvandvaḥ. The duality of the citizens allows one to apply the dual number after combining them and the tiṅprakriyā rules allow the same to the verb. So the meaning is abādhita even after the samāsa. So it is samarthāśrita in every respect. What is the problem then?*

*Best wishes for all*

*DB*
