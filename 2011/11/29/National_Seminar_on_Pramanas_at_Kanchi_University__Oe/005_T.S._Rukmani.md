Dear Dr Sankaranarayanan,

I have already registered for this seminar. I had asked whether I can be provided with local hospitality and accommodation during the seminar. I had also said that I will be in Chennai and could be picked up or told how to reach this place. Please let me know if this is possible so that I can plan my trip to your University to attend the seminar.

Thank you

Om

Rukmani
