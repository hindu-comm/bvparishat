Hi Namaste!

  

I am looking for Kaasika with nyaasa and padamanjari with bhaavabohini vaakyaa.

Editors are Dr Jaya shankar lal tripathi and Dr.Sudhakar Malaviya.

This book is from Tara Printing Press. 

Any advice where I can get this in Delhi or Kanpur ? or from any place( mail I mean, I am looking for hard copies of 10 volumes)

  

  

with warm regards,

bhavadiyaa,

vasudhaa
