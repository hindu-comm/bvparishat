Nama.h pari.sade !

Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam,

This is my humble submission :

Here in the word "J\~naataartha" in Dr Yadu's quote 'artha' is  
'prayojana' and not 'object' or .'meaning' as it seems more  
appropriate.

But he may ask the [lak.sa.na](http://lak.sa.na) of 'artha' - there is no harm as finally  
what is understood is 'artha' and it's nature.

In 'nityaa.h s'abdaarthasambandhaas tatraamnaataa mahar.sibhi.h /  
suutraa.naa.m saanutantraa.naa.m bhaa.syaa.naa.\~n ca pra.net.rbhi.h  
//' - s'abda,artha and their obtaining sambandha are referred to as  
nitya by the Vaiyaakara.na-s.

But in the view of the Naiyaayika-s the [var.na](http://var.na) 'ka' as it emerges with  
utterance and vanishes subsequently,is non-eternal whereas 'katva' as  
a universal is nitya.Cf. 'so'ya.m ka iti buddhis tu saajaatyam  
avalambate/' in Muktaavalii.

Now if 'sabda' is nitya according to the grammarians,it's difficult to  
ascertain which one is fit to be called so - the Paraa,the Pas'yantii  
or the Madhyamaa ? Some say Bhart.rhari speaks of 'Pas'yantii' as the  
highest.And Paraa is 'nirvikalpaka' and so 's'abdaananubiddha' - it's  
experience to a yogin also should be 's'abdaananubiddha'.If the  
experience of "Paraa" which is equated with Brahman is without  
s'abda-sa.mspar'sa,then in Vaiyaakara.na's view there is at least one  
pratyaya which is not savikalpaka,that is associated with verbal  
character.Will this not lead to 'sva-samaya-virodha'  
self-contradiction ? Where then is S'abdabrahma located among these  
three possible locales ?The Vaiyaakara.na-s seem to vary.

In fact this needs a more classified discussion.

Best regards,

SMMishra
