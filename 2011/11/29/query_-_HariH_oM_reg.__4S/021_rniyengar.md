Additional information:  
Rkpraatis'aakhya of Maharshi S'aunaka 15th chapter Omkaara-paTala.  
This records how the teacher and students sit. Students request the  
teacher "te'adhiihi Bho3 ityabhichodayanti...." Next the teacher  
starts: "sa O3miti prasvarati trimaatrah. prasvaarasthaane sa  
bhavatyudaattah.\|chaturmaatrovaa.....\|\|" The commentary of UvvaTa does  
not mention "Harih." \[However it discusses 'Sthaana' in terms of seven  
positions. This may have some relation with the seven svaras of  
classical music\].
