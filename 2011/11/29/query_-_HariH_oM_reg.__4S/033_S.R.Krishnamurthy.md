Dear sri Jagannatha,



I have retained as much of SayanaBhashya (including Yaska's nirvachanas)as is not inappropriate to the context; as I have declared in the beginning of that chapter so as to collate with the text. Kindly go thro verses 1-10 of the sukta, together with Bhashya; and then you will be able to appreciate. "tam avishwam invaam" is "avishwaminvaam".

As regards Varjya, VRujee varjane is both in Rudhaadau and churaadau (causative). Since varjanam (gerund), and varjam (indeclinable) are derived therefrom; and (rasavarjam - B.Gita 2-59) are in vogue;I am of the opinion thatVARJYA canalso derived likewise. I have derived varjya (g.7) equivalent of varjayitva in g.10 or varjitva. I am not aware of any nishedha for that. If one is brought to my notice, I shall modify the same. Else it stands. Thanks for the response.
