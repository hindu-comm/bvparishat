As I know, this hariH om, (in the place of Hello) is popularized by followers of Chinmayananda and adopted by Samskrta bharati. Because of Sanskrit conversational camps, it is spreading now a days throughout our
country. There is sanskrit nipaata Halaa. But the problem with Halaa is, its use is restricted to sakhiisambodhana. *Hande Hanje hallaahvaane niicaam cet.iim sakhiim prati*.(Amara). I think this halaa can be used in the place of Hello in spite of its use is restricted to sakhiisambodhana. (Mriga is used for deer in particular and any quadrupedal animal in general). The caller (if he/she is aforeigner) thinks that the receiver is saying Hello because, single word can be pronounced in so many strange (some times even funny) ways in English !
