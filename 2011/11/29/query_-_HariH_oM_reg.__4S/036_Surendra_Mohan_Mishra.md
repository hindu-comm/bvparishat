namaa.msi [paari.sadye.su](http://paari.sadye.su) !

Is it not a fact that with the cult of Vaishnavism being pervasive in  
the south and elsewhere that this "hari.h om " tag as prefix or suffix  
came to be a part of the tradition of Vedic chanting in some branches  
?  
The s'loka quoted as read at the end of a chanting session among the  
Taittiriiya-s should be a later practice.Such interpolations and their  
justification are abundant in our popular tradition and while editing  
a given recension it's a routine practice to point out such passages  
as later additions and the editor adduces reasons to the same based on  
his information.

\> वेदाक्षराणि यावन्ति पठितानि द्विजातिभिः।

\> तावन्ति हरि-नामानि कीर्तिताणि न संशयः॥
