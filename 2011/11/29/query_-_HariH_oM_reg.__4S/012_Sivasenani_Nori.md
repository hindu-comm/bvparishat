A parallel example would be Jai Ramji ki versus Jai Shankarji ki as greetings and leave taking words. The former is much more common than the latter.



We do not knowthe reason, but oneform of greeting seems to be morecommon. In cases like this, network effects are verypowerful and usually, they cannot be changed.



To ponder on the strength of network effects, just look at the keyboard.In English the most common keys are most inconveniently placed (e, s, are on left-middle-finger-top-row andleft-ring-finger-base-row). This is in stark contrast to the modern Inscript keyboard, where the repha (र), the most common Indic letter gets right-index-finger-base-row-base-position. The difference is network effect. When Remington and others started making type-writers, apparently keys used to get jammed as the mechanism was much slower than the speed of human fingers. So in order to slow down typing- and hence jamming of keys - the most common letters were placed in difficult position. Now, the asdf keyboard cannot be changed; if a new keyboard is introduced, none of the existing stock of typists would accustom themselves with it; even if some rational thinker wants to do so,he hesitates because he would thenhave to master two pattersn if he hopes to useother machines apart from his own computer;so every manufacturer keeps reproducing the old keyboard. And the old keyboard increases in strength. This is not just theory. When an intrepid mobile manufacturer introduced the ABCD keyboard, one year back, it did not click.



There are many inefficient end-results we have due to this network effect, but it is very difficult to change that. We use four limbs to drive a car, whereas two fingers suffice for locomotives and aeroplanes. We use a calender which is 23 days off the true motion of heavenly bodies (Sankranti should be on Dec 21, not Jan 14, I believe). By the way, there is an official calender which is more scientific, but except Government gazettes nobodyuses that.Indians still talk in feet and inches, never mind the official metric measures policy.



It requires an extra-ordinary personality to change such things: A Omar Khayyam could change the Persian calender; a MustafaKemal Ata-Turk could purge Turkish of Arabic elements and adapt the Roman script; a Sankaracharya could start new traditions (panchaayatan pooja etc.) - but otherwise, established conventions cannot be changed. We need a yuga-purusha to do that.
