Dear All,  
Hari Om  
In the HImalayas, in areas such as Rishikesh, Uttarkashi - the words 'Hari Om' is commonly used as obesence to elders as well as giving our love and regards to somebody. One finds it actually being used for many purposes. When we meet some one we greet with the words Hari Om; when we want to request that person's attention again we say Hari Om; and when we want to say good bye again we say that too with a Hari Om. Thus it is a multipurpose word.  
Gurudev Swami Chinmayanandaji studied under Swami Shivanandaji and later under Swami Taopvanamji in Rishikesha, Uttarkashi and Gangotri -- the place where Hari Om is in vogue, even now among the Sadhus as well as the general populace. Thus the words Hari Om came to be used by his students, disciples and well as the members of the Chinmaya Mission. Swamiji used to interestingly pun on the word Hari Om as Hurry Home, meaning Attain the Paramatman, which is alone our true Home.  
Thus the words Hari Om has a tradition behind it and not restricted to the Chinmaya Mission or created by Swami Chinmayanandaji.  
Also, we use HariH Om at the end of all Vedic chantings too - HariH Om. Sri Gurubhyo namaH. HariH OM. Thus has a hoary tradition. It is remembrance of the Lord and is hence prefered to 'Hello'.  
Cannot Hari and Hara be trully one alone? Cannot HariH Om also be HaraH Om in essence?  
In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayannada
