> हरिर्हरति पापानि , हरः हरति पापानि are both admitted. I think 'HariH > Om' is also popular in the vedAdhyayana sampradaya too: 'shrIgurubhyo > namaH hariH Om'. HaraH Om is also not as easy sounding as HariH Om.

The question was the choice between the two in outside the context of Vedadhyayana and wishing mutually.

  

For which all the vocatives could be used in general common to classical literature and हरिः ऊँ is equally valid as हरःऊँ orऊँ नमः शिवाय which is a proper salutation in the social context. or हर हर महादेव!

  

Otherwise, भोः will be enough.
