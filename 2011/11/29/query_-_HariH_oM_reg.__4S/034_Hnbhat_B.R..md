According to Panini, the क्त्वा suffix is substituted by ल्यप्, as perसमासेऽनञ्पूर्वे क्त्वो ल्यप्॥[७।१।३७](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/GoToSutram/7.1.37)

and next सूत्र prescribes in the same case, क्त्वा also in छन्दस्. This means without गतिसमास, which is obligatory for लुप्. Otherwise, it is grammatical aberration in classical and Vedic literature. In Vedic literature, बहुल rule may be made use of, in case of such aberrations. रसवर्जम् also has got the substitution णमुल् for क्त्वा, in certain case and it has got its own requirements and different shades of meaning, even without क्त्वा. Mostly it is substitution for क्त्वा. Now it is up to you, to give any exception to the above rule that ल्यप् requires the compound समास except (without) नञ्. or without compound, any विधि other than the above for verbs without prefix.
