hariH OM,

namo vidvadbhyaH,

  

 I am in need of "advaita ratna rakShaNa", the book by shrii madhusUdana sarasvatii. is anyone in the group aware of it having been published anywhere? If someone in the group can help me procure a copy, I promise to defray the concomitant costs.

  

 I am not able to procure the book from any of the popular publishers, nor am I able to find a digital copy on DLI. Please help.

  

svasti,

       JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,

                               
shrivathsa.
