Dear Sri Panchamukhi

  

Could you elaborate on what you mean by English notes? Is it an English translation of the bhAshya? I am asking because, for instance, Shankara's bhAshya English translation, (without the original Sanskrit commentary) alone runs into hundreds of pages. I expected that the case would be similar with Madhva's bhAshya, though I have never seen his bhAshya. There seems to be a disconnect between the number of commentaries and the total number of pages in the two volumes. Or am I missing something here? Please clarify.

  

Thanks

Kalyan
