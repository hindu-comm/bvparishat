Dear Kajyanji,  
  
You are missing something very important, probably a need to sri Madvacharyas commentary. As it is clear from Prof. Panchamukhi communication the English part is not word to word but has the summaries. The 1985 Sanskrit critical edition published by Raghavendra trust of the same book runs to around thousand pages.Why do you expect Madhavcharyas bhasya translation into English will run to thousands of pages?  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
