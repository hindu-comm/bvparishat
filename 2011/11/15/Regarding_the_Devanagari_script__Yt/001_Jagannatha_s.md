Dear V.Subrahmaninan,



Madhvacharya's original sarvamula works are in Tigalari script. This script resembles Malayalam script. What is the basic difference between these two scripts is Malayalam is very beautiful because of its ornamental style. Tigalari lacks thisornamental structure. Another difference is even Kannada works are available in Tigalari. Recently some Tulu works are also found in this script.In general,(barring a few exceptions) Tigalari manuscripts have Kannada number system.



One can safelydeclare thatRamanujacharya's worksare in Grantha script. Grantha means \`\`Sanskrit book'' in this context. Samskrita can not be written correctly (with exact required phonetic symbols) in Tamil. So Samskrita Scholars of Tamilunadu started a different type of script and they called it Grantha which was (and is) used for writing Samskrita works in Tamilunadu. Fortunately, this script is not dead. Even today it is in vogue in some parts of Tamilnadu. Even though it looks like Tamilu script,there aresome differences. The ones who do not know Samskrita can not read Grantha script correctly, in spite of theirhaving knowledge of Tamilu.



That a manuscript cannot survive more than 200 years in its original under normal conditions is totally wrong information.I do not know
whotold this during manuscript exhibition. Palm leaf manuscripts can survive more than 500 years, if they are very carefully looked after. Actually palm leaf is the hardest material used for writing.The life of paper manuscript is less.



Autograph copies of Shankaracharya'sworks might be in old Malayalam or Grantha, I guess.



For other points you raised, I hope learned scholars of bvparishat will give more details.
