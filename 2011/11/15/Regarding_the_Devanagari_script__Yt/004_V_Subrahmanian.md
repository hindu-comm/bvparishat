Dear Sri Jagannatha,

  

Namaste. 

  

While thinking about the inputs and reply provided by you, I felt that in the case of Shankara and Madhva who are known to have traveled throughout the country and debated and interacted with a variety of people of a variety of regions, their works, at least the seminal ones, would have been in the script that was popular across the regions. A localised script could address only a specific people of that region but the works of the above Acharyas were not confined to a local audience.
In that respect I think they would have penned their works in a script that was wide in use/vogue then across the country. Also they themselves are known to have had a wide/in depth knowledge of works that would most probably have been available in the popular script. Just like they felt that Sanskrit, being the most popular among scholars, is the language that is apt for writing their bhashyams, a script that is also the most common among scholars across the country would have been used by them to write the bhashyams. So a two-way use of the vyApaka lipi could be thought of in this instance. Thinking on these lines it looks very improbable that Shankara would have written in Malayalam or Grantha script. Also Shankara had direct disciples from different places of the country. Sureshwara from the north wrote the vArtika for Shankara's bhashya/s. It is unlikely that he knew theMalayalam orGgrantha script.  

  

Here is a resource on Grantha:

Your comments are welcome. I am just sharing my thoughts.

  

Warm regards,
