Dear Subrahmanian,



I had thought that your query was regarding the exact scripts the
AcAryas employedwhile theywere composingbhAs.yas. Copies and recopies of the Sam.skr.ta works are available aplenty in almost all the scripts of our country. For example, amanuscript of bharata's nAt.yaSAstra is available at ORI which hasKannad.a script. It does not mean that bharataused kannad.a script while composing nAt.yaSAstra!
My replyfocuses on the point the scripts AcAryas might have used.



**This is the first para of your posting:**



I have a few questions regarding the Devanagari script that we use today to write Sanskrit. Was this the same script used by authors over a 1000 years? For example, *did Shankaracharya write the bhashyam literature in the present-day Devanagari?* Is there any research on this question? If the present Devanagari did not exist in those days, from when did the present script come into vogue? What was the script that existed then? *Did Ramanujacharya and Madhwacharya use a different script?* It is said that the sarvamUlA grantha-s of Madhwacharya have been discovered in their original. Would anyone give more details on this? *What is the script used there?*
