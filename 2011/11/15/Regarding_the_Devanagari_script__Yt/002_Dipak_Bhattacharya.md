Dear Subrahmanianji,

There are well-known studies on the evolution of the Indian scripts. Bühler’s *Indian Paleography* (transl. from German by J.F.Fleet) is the oldest. The most comprehensive synchronic description will be found in G. H. Ojha’s *Prācīna bhāratīya lipimāla* which has been reprinted. You better consult, if available, A. H. Dani’s *Indian Paleography* Oxford, 1963 which is very informative. The answers to your questions are best answered here. You will also find a helpful bibliography on each chapter. Dani was a devoted student of late Professor A. S. Altekar. Of course, it does not mean that all his views are acceptable.  

Best
