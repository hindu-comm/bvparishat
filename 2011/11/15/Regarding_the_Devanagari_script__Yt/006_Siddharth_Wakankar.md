Dear Sir,

I may intimate to you that the late Lipikar, Shri L.S.Wakankar of Bombay,had done extensive research on the Devanagari script and the evolution of the letters.He published that work under the title,Ganesha-atharvashirsha-An Ancient IndianApproach to Phonetic Writing,which was published in 1966 by the Tata Press,Bombay.He had written another book in Marathi,with the title,Devanagari-Udbhava va Vikas.It was a series of three lectutres delivered at the Pune Uni.and brought out in the form of a book by Man-sanmana Prakashan,Pune. You may profitably refer to that book as Shri Wakankar had devoted his life to the study of scripts.He was the person who computerised all Indian Scripts,besides Ceylonese and Burmese He was the Technical Director of the Institute of Typographical Research,C/O Shri Bhat,Bank of Baroda Building,Ganapati Chowk,Opposite Kavre Cold-drink House,Budhvar Peth,Pune-411020 For.his other research work on Devanagari,you may directly contact Shri Bhat or his colleagueProf. Mukund Gokhale of Pune who was working with Wakankar.
