Namaste.  
  
I have a few questions regarding the Devanagari script that we use today to write Sanskrit. Was this the same script used by authors over a 1000 years? For example, did Shankaracharya write the bhashyam literature in the present-day Devanagari? Is there any research on this question? If the present Devanagari did not exist in those days, from when did the present script come into vogue? What was the script that existed then? Did Ramanujacharya and Madhwacharya use a different script? It is said that the sarvamUlA grantha-s of Madhwacharya have been discovered in their original. Would anyone give more details on this? What is the script used there?  
  
During an exhibition by the Oriental Research Institute, Mysore, in Bangalore a few years ago, some specialists who explained the various exhibits such as different types of manuscripts in palm leaf and other forms including paper, said that a manuscript cannot survive more than 200 years in its original under normal conditions. What normally happens is that constantly copies would be made and it is these that we receive down at our times. Would someone throw more light on this?
