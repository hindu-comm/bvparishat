### A manuscript has been discovered with Indus script: Lucy Zuber Buehler (2009)

Photograph of lower portion of mss. Media identity number SN05 1000, 7086 in: Western Himalaya Archive, Vienna, 2009 (See[photo gallery - Figures 1 to 4 appended to thesis](http://www.isw.unibe.ch/content/e4229/e4357/e4536/e6397/e6398/BachelorthesisLucyZuberbuehler_ger.pdf)).  
  
This is a sensational discovery of a bark manuscript with Indus script (See embedded document). In a lucidly argued[thesis](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/103016650/LucyZuberbuehlerindusscriptmss2009), Lucy Zuber Buehler (2009) demonstrates that the provenanced manuscript does contain writing in Indus script.  
  
"The artefact in question consists of a strip of what would appear to be several thin layers of bark, with seven lines of symbols running across it. A cursory perusal of the approximately 200 symbols, could lead a layperson with a rudimentary knowledge of the Indus script, to propose that the text at hand might have been composed using signs that appear in the Indus script, for some of the most common and well-known Indus signs seem to be present on the bark manuscript. It remains to be seen, however, exactly how many of the graphs on the bark object could be considered attested Indus symbols." (ibid., p. 3)  
  
It is time for the announcers of a[prize](http://www.safarmer.com/indus/prize.html)to settle and pay up the prize money, without waiting for decoding/decipherment/translation of mss.
