Dear all,

  

The posted message was sent to Prof. Asko Parpola, an expert in Indus Script, for his comments. He has opined thus:

  

Dear Professor Bandyopadhyay,  
Many thanks for kindly sending me this message. It was forwarded to me also by Professor D. P. Agrawal, who asked me to comment on it. I wrote to him the following:  
There is no doubt whatever that this is a fake. Similar fakes with Indus script on birchbark were offered for sale in London about ten years ago, and I presented photographs of the best at South Asian Archaeology 2003 conference in Paris with a shock effect - many people believed that this was a real find. That manuscript, for which they asked 8 million pounds, was however radiocarbon tested, and found out to date from the latter part of the 20th century CE. I am recognizing the same handwriting in this piece as in some of the other mss then examined by me. I think it is the work of the same Pakistani fakers who were trying to sell the "mummy" of an "Achaemenid princess" some years ago.

  

The above observations speak itself.

  

Best

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
