Namaste.

  

It is said that the औत्पत्तिकसूत्रम् in the शाबरभाष्यम् for the जैमिनि-sUtras contains the sentence'शुक्तिकाहि रजतवदवभासते' that Shankaracharya mentions in the adhyAsa bhAShya as an example for adhyAsa. I request the learned members to give details as to the context in which the sentence is found in this early mImAmsaka text.

  

Regards,
