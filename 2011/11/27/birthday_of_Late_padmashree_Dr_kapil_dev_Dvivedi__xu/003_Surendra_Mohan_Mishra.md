Late Padmashree Dr Kapil Dev Dvivedi was born this day.As a Sanskrit  
scholar of great acumen in his field he was a tireless soul for the  
growth of Sanskrit in modern India.His numerous publications have  
lasting value for the erudite and the students alike.

His life has certainly inspired love and commitment for Sanskrit among  
his disciples and those who knew him.
