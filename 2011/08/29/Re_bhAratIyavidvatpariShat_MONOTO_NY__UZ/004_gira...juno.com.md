Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



VeNu,VeeNAand VANI (VedavANI)



Thanks Dr, Sadasivamurti rani for telling us music related terminology. I support your suggestion. We need scholars of music and Saamaveda on bvparishada. My specialty is sound, acoustics. There is whole Mechanical spectrum just like electromagnetic spectrum. Sound is a mechanical wave. Both music and language involve low frequency sounds. Now quality of sound has to do with Timbre. It depends on wave shape. It is the quality of sound makes us to distinguish between two instruments when they are playing the same tones. Please suggest the book that gives accurate Sanskrit and its corresponding English terminology in music. I know English terminology. I collected some Sanskrit terminology from Pundit Keshava Ginde (inventor of 18 inches long flute) during his visit to USA. Among all musical instruments the flute is the best-more energy in fundamental frequency and less in only few harmonics. That is why Krishna uses it-his low fundamental frequency. Animals get attracted by low frequency-cows were coming to listen to his flute. VeeNa ( of Naarada and Sarasvati), and VeNu (of KrishNa) are the best analogue instruments. Piano , Harmoniumare kind of digital-either this note or that note. Apply the modern information theory to sound of flute and one will get surprising results. An educational institutein Houston took copy right on my power point presentation on "Physics of Music" because they gave grant to design it. There is lot more to talk.Please bring some knowledge from Taandya Brahmana of Saamaveda here. I discussed here before Udgith etc. Thanks. N.R,Joshi.
