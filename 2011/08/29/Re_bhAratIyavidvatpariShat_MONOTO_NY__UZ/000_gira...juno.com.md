Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Do accents have phonemic values ?



Thank you Pro Korada



**ekas'ruti.h**

****

**I read differently in different books-one says accent is produced by stress while other says it is produced by change of tone. Which one is correct? Stress will change amplitude of sound which is perceived as loudness. Tonal change will change frequency which is perceived as pitch change.**

**Again Indian music devides one octave in 22 S'rutis. Any connection to **ekas'ruti.h ? I also read that accent have phonemic values. WilI they contribute to change of meaning? Is there research paper or book on it? Please help. Thanks.****
