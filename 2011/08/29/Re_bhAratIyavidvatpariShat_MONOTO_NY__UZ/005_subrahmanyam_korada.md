**ekas'ruti.h**

****

**I read differently in different books-one says accent is produced by stress while other says it is produced by change of tone. Which one is correct? Stress will change amplitude of sound which is perceived as loudness. Tonal change will change frequency which is perceived as pitch change.**

**Again Indian music devides one octave in 22 S'rutis. Any connection to **ekas'ruti.h ? I also read that accent have phonemic values. WilI they contribute to change of meaning? Is there research paper or book on it? Please help. Thanks.****

**N.R.Joshi  
  
the 'ac' will have three (in total seven) Svaras depending on the place where it is uttered - uccaih udAtta.h , nIcairanudAtta.h , samAhAra.h svarita.h (all Panini) . uccaih = tAlvAdisthAnes.u
UrdhvabhAges.u uccAryaman.a.h ac udAtta.h .  
  
Any change in Svara will effect the meaning .  
  
Please refer to PaninIyas'iks.A -- the Svaras , i..e nis.Ada etc have emanated from UdAtta etc.  
  
Tone can be fine or coarse .  
  
Loudness is in 'dhvani' (s'abdagun.a) - see Paspas'Ahnikam and TaparastatkAlasya -- Mahabhasyam .  
  
Ekas'ruti is without applying UdAtta etc.  
  
S'r.ti in SamgItas'Astra is raising the tone (pitch) . Not Ekas'ruti .
