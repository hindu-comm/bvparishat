The Kaavya-miimaa.msaa cannot be the source of the citation. It is just one of the texts that cites the verse. As I wrote in my email on the subject, the verse has been cited inthe Vaakyapadiiya-v.rtti (unlikely to be later than the5th century A.D.),which would beat least 3-4 centuries before the time of the KM. Therefore, the truth in the current state of research is that we do not know the source of the verse. All we know is that it is older than the5th century A.D.
