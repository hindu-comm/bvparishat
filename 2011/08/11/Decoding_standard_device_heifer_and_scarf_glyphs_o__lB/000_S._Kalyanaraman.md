**Decoding standard device, heifer and scarf glyphs of Indus Script as lapidary crafts: turning (metal-smithy), copper mineral work, stone-cutting**

  
The glyphs on Indus script relate to stone-workers emerging into the bronze age working with copper ores and other minerals, stones used as grinding stones, ring stones, and creating beads for necklaces. The Indus lapidary-artisans worked with stones -- mineral, gemstones and other durable semi-precious stones such as agate, carnelian, horn and bone, terracotta pastes and even made copper plates with inscriptions using an invented writing system referred to as Indus Script. They were lapidaries – cutting, polishing, or engraving durable stones. They were also stone masons who could chisel inscriptions and create raised metal (copper) tablets.  
  
This monograph complements the recent discovery of a seal discussed in ‘Decoding inscription on Indus seal of Mitathal’ (August 2011) – with particular reference to: Excerpts from: Prabhakar VN, Tejas Garge, Randall Law, 2010,[Mitathal: New observations based on surface reconnaissance and geologic provenance studies](http://tinyurl.com/3nay3dg), Man and Environment XXXV (1): 54-61 <http://tinyurl.com/3nay3dg>  
  
The path-breaking work of Randall Law (2008) is a pointer to the stone resources used by Indus artisans -- lapidaries, masons and smiths. (cf. Randall William Law, 2008,[Inter-regional interaction and urbanism in the ancient Indus valley: a geologic provenience study of Harappa’s rock and mineral assemblage](http://tinyurl.com/3s22o4m), University of Wisconsin-Madison <http://tinyurl.com/3s22o4m>). In this dissertation, Randall Law compares grindingstone, chert, steatite, agate, vesuvianite-grossular, alabaster, limestone and various metal artifacts to samples of those materials collected from sources across South Asia, evaluates and documents inter-regional interaction and urbanism in the Greater Indus region of Pakistan and northwestern India -- South Asia's first urbanized society, the Indus Civilization (ca. 2600 to 1900 BC).  
  
Consistent with these insights provided by Randall Law and in the report on the discovery of the Indus seal in Mitathal,[Indus Script Cipher – Hieroglyphs of Indian linguistic area](http://www.amazon.com/Indus-Script-Cipher-Hieroglyphs-linguistic/dp/0982897103/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1312462166&sr=8-1)by S. Kalyanaraman provides the decoding of the glyphs of Indus Script – read rebus -- on the the Mohenjo-daro tablet.

The Mohenjo-daro tablet inscribes three glyphs carried on shoulders in a procession. \[Mohenjo-daro. Terracotta tablet. After Marshall 1931, Pl. CXVIII,9\].  
The carriers of the glyphs have upraised arms: eṛaka 'upraised arm' (Ta.); rebus: eraka = copper (Ka.)  
  
The glyphs from left to right are: 1. Standard device; 2. Heifer; and 3. Scarf. These glyphs are decoded, read rebus in mleccha (meluhha) of Indian linguistic area.
