Happy Independence day.  
  
We observed that there are thousands of people interested in learning  
Sanskrit over the internet. Many organizations are providing the  
same.  
  
  
There is no platform to exhibit the Sanskrit skills and it is  
difficult to find Sanskrit speaking people in day to day life. Here,  
we invite you all to Sanskrit micro blogging.  
  
Now,we <http://sanskritcentral.com>, have decided to encourage Sanskrit  
lovers by creating a twitter like micro blogging site. ..where the  
people do their conversations in Sanskrit. The site may help Sanskrit  
lovers to see Sanskrita Bhaashitam.
