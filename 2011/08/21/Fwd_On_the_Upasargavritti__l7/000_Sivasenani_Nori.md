Namaste Senani ji,  
  
thank you very much for your query.  
  
Your question can be easily answered, since all the necessary information is  
included in my critical edition of the Viṃśatyupasargavṛtti and its Tibetan  
translation. You may perhaps draw the attention of the members of your  
group towards this publication. On my website I have provided a few  
facsimile pages and a summary in English (<http://www.dragomir->  
[dimitrov.net/bookstall.html#Vimsati](http://dimitrov.net/bookstall.html#Vimsati)).  
  
The excerpt you are referring to is taken from the oldest MS of the  
Viṃśatyupasargavṛtti accessible to me. This is a Nepalese codex written in  
Nepal Samvat 541 (i.e. AD 1421). The script is generally called (old) Newari.  
With the kind permission of the very friendly and helpful authorities at the  
National Archives in Kathmandu, I have included a colour facsimile copy of  
the complete manuscript, as well as of two other related manuscripts, all  
photographed in Nepal.  

  
\> Prof. E. Narayanan came up with the following decipherment (but the  
\> meter is not known to him):  
\>  
\> प्रपरापसमन्ववनिर्दुरव्य  
\> ङपयाप्यतिसूदपयश्च।  
\> प्रतिना सह  
\> लंपितव्यापपूपयावधिलब्धम  

\> ्र।।  
\>  
\> I wonder if you could let us know the correct reading of that verse.  
  

The correct reading of the stanza, as now printed in my edition, is:  
  
प्रपरापसमन्ववनिर्दु-  
र्व्याङ्न्यधयो ऽप्यतिसूदभयश्च।  
प्रतिना सह लक्षयितव्याः  
पर्युपयोरपि लक्षणमत्र॥  
  
It is composed in the Vegavatī metre (sa-sa-sa-ga, bha-bha-bha-ga-ga,  
10/11). In the old manuscript there are minor errors which have been  
corrected in the above text. I am attaching a page from my edition with this  
introductory stanza, so that you can check the critical apparatus. Further  
details about this and other similar texts can be found in the philological  
notes included in my book. The enumeration of the upasargas (in different  
order and form) occurs in various grammatical treatises, e.g., in  
Puruṣottamadeva’s Bhāṣāvṛtti ad Pāṇ. 1.4.59, Bhaṭṭayajñeśvara’s  
Gaṇaratnāvalī 1.26, as well as in the Upasargavṛtti, the Laghūpasargavṛtti,  
and elsewhere.  
  
I may also note in connection with the stanza quoted by Mr. T.G. Srigith and  
commented by Ashok ji that I know a very similar version of it with  
upasargagaṇaḥ instead of upasargavidhiḥ in the fourth pāda, and this can be  
read in the anonymous Upasargavṛtti (published in Benares by Vrajabhūṣaṇa  
Das in 1905). In the anonymous Laghūpasargavṛtti (ed. Krishnamacharya  
1962) almost the same appears, again with upasargagaṇaḥ in the final pāda;  
however, there we have the variant kavibhiḥ in place of kavinā. I have  
quoted this stanza composed in the Toṭaka metre (sa-sa-sa-sa) in my book:  
  
प्रपरापसमन्ववनिर्दुरभि-  
व्यधिसूदतिनिप्रतिपर्युपयः।  
उप आङिति विंशतिरेष सखे  
उपसर्गगणः कथितः कविना॥  

  
\> Recently, Dr. Dhaval Patel (a doctor of medicine and a Sanskrit  
\> enthusiast) posted a work in that forum called 'Upasargavrittih', typed  
\> straight from a manuscript found in Pathan, Gujarat. The first verse and  
\> first vritti from that work are given below at the end of this email.  
  

I assume that this manuscript is fairly short (some 6-7 folios). Would it be  
possible to make images of it available to me, so that I can check it myself?  
It will be necessary to examine a longer portion, in order to draw a firm  
conclusion about the nature/origin of this text. I would gladly let you know  
the results of my examination, if you could provide me the material. In any  
case it is clear that the introductory stanza of this text composed in the  
Anuṣṭubh metre is different from the one in the Viṃśatyupasargavṛtti. There  
is a slightly different order in the enumeration of the meanings of pra, which  
happens to be identical with the corresponding passage in the above-  
mentioned Upasargavṛtti.  
  
All the best,  
D.D.
