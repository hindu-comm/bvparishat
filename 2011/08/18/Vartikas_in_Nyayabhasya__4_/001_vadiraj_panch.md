Dear Professor Veeranarayana Pandurangi.

Congratulations, Greetings and Abhinandanani!!

I have felt greatly delighted by the conferring of Vedavyasa Sammana on you. It is a well deserved honour bestowed on you. I am sure many more honours will come your way in your career.

I feel proud of you.

Please visit Sri Mantralayam and deliver a discourse and conduct pathas for a week or so in our Sri Gurusarvabhouma Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, where I am now Chancellor. Let me know when you can come.

I am very keen to have visiting faculty pathas from distinguished scholars, in Nyaya, Vyakarana, Meemamsa, Alankara, Vedanta and specific works like SrimanNyaya Sudha, Sri Parimala, SrimatChandrika, Sri Nyayamruta etc., at our Vidyapeetha. I want to use this forum to request retired Professors etc. who can spare some time for this purpose to let me know.

Please send all yours and your University's Publications to our Vidyapeetha Library. I will ask our people to reciprocate.
