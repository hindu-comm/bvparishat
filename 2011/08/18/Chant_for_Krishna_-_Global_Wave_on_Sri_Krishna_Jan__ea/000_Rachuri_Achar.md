Dear Scholars,

  

कृष्णं वन्दे जगद्गुरुम् ।

  

  This is a call to take part in the **Chant for Krishna - Global Wave on Sri Krishna Janmasthami for World Peace**.

  

Q. Why Chant?

In view of the the turmoil the world is in presently in, with all-round corruption, extremism, unrest, lawlessness, riots and arrests of noble, we feel it is the right time for Sri Krishna Janma in everyone's heart.

Sri Krishna said -

यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत ।

अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ।।

*When ever there is an attack on Dharma and Adharma is on the rise, I would manifest myself in this world (i.e I would manifest the power of Atmatva - Swamitva - My Lordness over everything)*

Only Lord Krishna can remove all the hatred, ill-will, anger that has crept into everyone's heart. Lord Krishna saves us if we pray and propitiate Him. What would be the best way to please Lord Sri Krishna?  
  
We have come up with a unique way to please him.

On the auspicious occasion of Sri Krishna Janmasthami, let us please Lord Shri Krishna by welcoming him to our hearts by way of chanting a mantra which symbolizes his Lordness over ourselves and everyone else.  
  
So, friends, to create a universal sense of Brotherhood in the world and to send a peace message to every human being that we are all sons and daughters of the same Almighty, let us all chant the Mantra

## Mama Swami Harir Nityam Sarvasya Patireva Cha

the most beautiful message of the scriptures which addresses Krishna as Hari - the remover of all defects, and conveys the meaning that "Sri Krishna is my Eternal Master and also the Master of Everyone else in this universe!!!".  

Q. What is a Wave? How does it work?

When people living in different time zones across the globle chant the Mantra one after the other, the chanting can be visualized as travelling from east to west of the Globe like the waves of an ocean. We want to make this happen on Sri Krishna Janmasthami!!

To achieve this, people who live in the far east (time zone which is farthest from GMT i.e GMT +12) should chant the Mantra from their respective locations exactly at 8 am. This will be followed by people who live in the next time zone and so on till the wave reaches far-west.

This way, the wave travels from the Land of Sunrise to the Land of Sunset, thus creating a spiritual wave across the globe, uniting everyone across the globe in a spirit of Universal Brotherhood and thus brings World Peace at large by the divine Grace of Lord Sri Krishna!!!

The wave thus created can be visualized at the following link [http://chantforkrishna.atmashrama.org](http://chantforkrishna.atmashrama.org/ "Chant for Krishna")

The requirement is that every chanter who can come online should visit the above link. This way we can track the wave on the world map as it progresses towards west in the service of Lord Krishna!!!

If you have any questions you can write to[acharya....@gmail.com]()

I request you to spread the word and take pains to paste it in pubic places like Maths, Institutes and Apartment Complexes for this noble cause and help us tospread this message around the globe!!!
