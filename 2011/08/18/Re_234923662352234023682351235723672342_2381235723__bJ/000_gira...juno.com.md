Medicinal Use of Grass



Are there medicinal use of Grass-Munja etc?



Thank you very much Prof S. Korada. New generation of Indians migrated to USA ask many questions about our ancient traditions. Most of Swamis and Babas visiting from India to USA and holding camps to promote Indian culture among new generation talk only about Yoga and God realization. Parents either forgot old traditions or simply do not have answers. Many migrant Indians never opened Panchaanga when they were in India. Now with scientific overdose of questioning in USA they realized they never understood Sanskrit terminology used in Panchaang although itwas in their regional language like Daate Panchaanga in Marathi. Recently a young student saw photo of North Indian lady pouring milk on a cobra, and asked question about Naaga worship on Naaga Panchami. That is why I asked the question on bvparishad. Many organizations in USA are always ready to find fault with Indian traditions labeling Indians as tree and animal worshippers. At least some explanation helps. So thanking again Prof S. Korada, I end my paragraph. N.R.Joshi.

in the earlier mail I inadvertently quoted Manusmr.ti for Pavitram .  
  
'pavitram pavayis.yan pUto medhya.h ' - etc. Mantras support the practice of Pavitram -- pavitram dhr.tvA .. (Kalpa)
