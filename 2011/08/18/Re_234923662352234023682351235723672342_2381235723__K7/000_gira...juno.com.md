**Respected Scholars, Namaskar!**

**When Kurus were speaking Sanskrit in North India, what language Kerala was speaking at the southern tip of the subcontinent?**

****

Recently Dr. Kalyanraman is posting many highly informative sections of published research paperson Indus script and seals along with his own research. I highly appreciate his scholarship in establishing continuity of the ancient Indian religion, culture and civilization as against the western scholarship of importing Vedic religion of India into India (AIT theory). In his posting of dated Aug 15 on **Indus economics, language and** **script,** a linguistic map of the ancient India is included depicting south India-Dravidian, Tibet-Tibeto Burmese, Some part of north Gujarat and south Pakistan – Mleccha and then Sarasvati-Ganga area- Vedic and some other area as Munda. Dr. Kalyanraman uses simple rebus method and he had made considerable progress in deciphering Indus seals and glyphs. He adds that there was lingua franca which included glosses from all these ancient Indian language families. From the article it appears that there was literary language (which one-not mentioned) in addition to mleccha which was a shared super-set of glosses from all language families mentioned above. In this description language families separate from Vedic (and/or Sanskrit) are assumed to exist in ancient India.



This poses interesting scenario of the ancient history. Where did Vedic or Sanskrit come from? Assume that it originated in North India somewhere. According to OIT theory Indians pushed their ancient brothers (Anu and Drahyu or some other tribes) beyond Khyber pass. As result of their migration into western countries, the whole Indo-European language family came into existence from Afghanistan to England to Sweden. On the other hand Purus who left in the subcontinent could not spread their pure Vedic or Sanskrit over the all subcontinent because even today there are Dravidian language words present unrelated to Sanskrit words although these languages imported many Sanskrit words over thousands of years of the history. Such ancient languages of Europe disappeared long ago. This is puzzling situation. It becomes more puzzling if we accept Mahabharat war around 3000 BC in North India. What language Kerala was speaking when Kurus were speaking (assumed) Sanskrit? And in 3000 BC there were Indo-European languages in Europe as Aryan presence all over Asia is attested even as before 5000 BC.



This is my effort of understanding ancient Indian history. Please correct me if needed and offer information you have please so that we all can grow together in our knowledge. Please pardon me for long posting. At least it proves to Dr. Kalyanraman that I am reading his Indus script postings. Thanks to Dr. Kalyanraman again. N. R. Joshi.
