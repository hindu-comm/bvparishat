Ordering of lexemes in their alphabetical order is missing in Sanskrit lexicons (until we come to the time of ;Sabda-kalpa-druma, Vaacaspatyam etc. in the 19th century, obviously inspired by the Western language dictionaries that came to India). However, a few lexicons in which thealphabetical order is applied \*to the ends of stems\* exist in Sanskrit. These are, in effect, reverse dictionaries (stems ending in "a" are given first, then those ending in "aa," and so on), although they do not try to cover all the known words of Sanskrit. See Claus Vogel, 1979, \_ Indian Lexicography\_, Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, p. 305.
