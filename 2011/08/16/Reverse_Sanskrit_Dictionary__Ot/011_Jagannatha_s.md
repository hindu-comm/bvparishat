Respected scholars,



Thank youall very much for detailed information. I would like to add:

1\. Among the Nanartha Antya-anukrama koshas, Naanaarthaarnava-sankhepa by Keshavasvami is biggest which has nearly 5000 verses. It was edited by Pandit Sri Ganapathishastri.

2\. Vanmayarnava by Mahamahopadhyaya Ramavatarasharma of last century,
published at Chowkhamba, Varanasi is of same category. It is also very big.

3.Dhatupatha fits into the same category as Dr. Hari Narayana Bhat says. Some Shloka Dhatupathas are available. They are in antyanukrama style. The famous Dhatupatha in verses is Kavikalpadruma by Vopadeva. He has given his own anubandhas to dhatus.Kavikalpadruma is edited by Dr. G.B.Palsule and published at Deccan College, Pune (Even though it was published one or two times formerly, it is the Palsule's editionwhich is best). I have seen some portions of a Shlokadhatupatha on the lines of antyaaksharanukrama in some issues of Vidyodayapatrika. I do not know who authored this. It seems even Appashastri Rashivedakar of Samskrita Chandrika famewrote a Shloka Dhatupathain Antyanukrama.
