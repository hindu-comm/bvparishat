Indus economics, language and script

  

Chanhu-daro was called "Sheffield of ancient India," by Mackay, the excavator of the small Indus site.  
  
This 'Sheffield' used Indus script to encode underlying Mleccha (Meluhha) speech.  
  
The transition from Stone Age into Bronze Age resulted in stone-workers' and lapidaries' competence being complemented by 1) invention of metallurgical technique of alloying minerals to create hard metal and metal artefacts and 2) invention of Indus writing system. Both inventions of the artisans drew upon the repertoire of mleccha (Meluhha) language of Indian linguistic area to trade with their contact areas and to create a record of their economic transactions.  
  
Many researchers have analyzed and documented economic facets, in particular, of the Indus civilization area and their insights support the decoding of inscriptions of the civilization, in the context of economic activities by Meluhhans, who are mleccha speakers of Indus language and users of Indus script. The areas investigated by researchers and scholars also cover, in an inter-disciplinary evaluation of archaeology, literature and language of ancient times, an extensive civilization area across the Persian Gulf and in maritime trade contact with Mesopotamia, detailing the material resources used for bead-making, manufacture of grinding stones, of copper plates/utensils/tools/weapons - many with inscriptions, agricultural products used/produced, metallurgy including alloying, casting, forging:

The contribution of Randall W. Law co-authored with Prabhakar VN and Tejas Garge has been linked in the decoding of 1) a[Mitathal seal](http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/08/decoding-inscription-on-indus-seal-of.html)with Indus script and underlying language and 2)[glyphs of standard device, heifer and scarf](http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/08/decoding-standard-device-heifer-and.html)used on the Indus inscriptions. The standard device, sangada, is shown as relatable, rebus, to[stone-workers](http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/08/blog-post.html)called sangataras. संगतराश lit. ‘to collect stones, stone-cutter, mason.’ संगतराश संज्ञा पुं० \[फ़ा०\] पत्थर काटने या गढ़नेवाला मजदूर । पत्थरकट । २. एक औजार जो पत्थर काटने के काम में आता है । (Dasa, Syamasundara. Hindi sabdasagara. Navina samskarana. 2nd ed. Kasi : Nagari Pracarini Sabha, 1965-1975.) पत्थर या लकडी पर नकाशी करनेवाला, संगतराश, ‘mason’.  
  
The cumulative conclusion drawn from these contributions is that the primacy of economic activities necessitated the invention and use of a writing system to convey messages using the language – lingua franca – of the civilization. This inference is consistent with the insight provided by James Muhly: invention of alloying tin with copper to create bronze alloy heralding the Bronze Age had to be linked with another invention: the writing system used in economic activities, in trade transactions, in particular.  
  
The objects on which the Indus script is inscribed are part of the material artefacts discovered through archaeological excavations. It is, therefore, reasonable to evaluate the writing system on these inscribed objects in the context of other economic activities of the civilization – activities such as cultivation of rice, millet or maize (glyphs related to which had been used in the script), mining of mineral resources, lapidary crafts on precious- and semi-precious stones – turning the stones into beads used on necklaces and other ornaments, bones, ivory, stone-work related to ring-stones – used as architectural supports in buildings, grinding stones – used in households for grinding cereals or pulses into edible flour, metallurgical activities of alloying minerals into metals, casting and forging them into household utensils or artisan tools or weapons.

The challenge of decoding the writing system is, in effect, the challenge of identifying the words used by the people of the civilization engaged in such economic activities – without invoking an a priori assumption of a religious or political basis for the use of glyphs of the writing system.  
  
It has been shown that a Mohenjodaro tablet inscribed with three glyphs: standard device, heifer and scarf – decoded rebus related to the workshop of stone-workers and mineral-workers or miners.  
  
As Randall Law has demonstrated, the stone work covered a variety of resources: grinding stone, chert, steatite, agate, vesuvianite-grossular, alabaster, and limestone. In addition to these resources, bone, ivory, copper, tin, arsenic, meteoric iron were also used to produce artefacts as archaeologically attested.  
  
In what language and with what words did the creators of the urbanized civilization refer to these resources?  
  
A clue is provided by the inscriptions already decoded in a known language in a known writing system: Mesopotamian cuneiform inscriptions.

Decryption of Indus script cipher of hieroglyphs of[Indian linguistic area](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Oeuzs-1w68c/TLM7Zd_5WQI/AAAAAAAACH8/gUDb7iCLyLM/s1600/MAP.jpg), announced in[Indus Script Cipher – Hieroglyphs of Indian linguistic area](http://www.amazon.com/Indus-Script-Cipher-Hieroglyphs-linguistic/dp/0982897103/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1313248565&sr=8-1)(2010), avoids the pitfalls of many past decipherment claims. The work is premised on the Indian linguistic area and consistent with the principle of occam’s razor, uses a simple rebus method to read all the glyphs – pictorial motifs with glyptic elements and signs with glyptic elements – as based on words of the Indus language from a repertoire of artisans’ work attested archaeologically. The Indus language is independently delineated by the linguistic area’ principle and a comparative[Indian Lexicon](http://www.scribd.com/doc/2232617/lexicon%20linked%20at%20http:/sites.google.com/site/kalyan97/indus-writing)provides the glosses for matching words with glyptic elements and identifying homonyms which render the message content of inscriptions. The set of glosses from the Indian linguistic area lead to a decipherment of the messages as representations of the repertoire of artisans – lapidaries, miners and smiths. The underlying language – for glosses which render the glyptic elements and concordant homonyms -- is not exclusive Munda or exclusive Sanskrit or exclusive Dravidian but the lingua franca which included glosses from all three language families – with glosses borrowed from one another. Evidence for the decipherment comes from the cultural continuum including punch-marked coins and sculptural glyphs of the historical periods which continued to use the glyphs of Indus script. Evidence is also provided to equate the Indus language with a language category called mleccha (cognate: meluhha) attested in Mesopotamian texts, in an archaeological context and attested in ancient Indian texts which point to mleccha as a language with shared super-set of glosses, as lingua franca clearly distinguishable from literary language – just as Prākṛtam is distinguishable from Sanskrit. Thus, mleccha is construed as the set of glosses shared in the Indian sprachbund in contact situations and the context of history of changes in phonetic forms and/or semantic expansions of glosses.
