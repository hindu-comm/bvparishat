I don't think there is any searchable database for Amarakosha, while pdf versions are available in [archive.org](http://archive.org) or DLI collections. I think there is one searchable database online too combined with other texts. I could not locate right now.

  

About the names of lexicons, I attach a survey of Sanskrit lexicons and their schemes, by some author, I don't remember. This will help to know about other lexicons/Thesaurus in Sanskrit. Credits are due to the author of the article.



Here is a link:

to Amarakosha.

  

There are some other lists given in the introductions to Amarakosha and Trikandashesha.
