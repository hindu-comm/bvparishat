\> Dear Sir,  
\> I am in search of online version of Amara-kosha. I also want to know names of some other thesaurus of sanskrit online. I have gone through given links for this purpose, but could not find any of them. Please help.

See <http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_amarakosha.html>, in particular the links marked "ITX."

Regards,

Shrisha Rao
