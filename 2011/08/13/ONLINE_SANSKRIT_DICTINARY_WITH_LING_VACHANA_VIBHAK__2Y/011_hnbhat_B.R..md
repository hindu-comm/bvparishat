Here is something I wanted to bring to your notice:

  

अर्थः :: देवः\|वर्गः :: स्वर्गवर्गः\|अमर,निर्जरस,देव,त्रिदश,विबुध,सुर,सुपर्वन्,सुमनस्,त्रिदिवेश,दिवौकस्,आदितेय,दिविषद्,लेख,अदितिनन्दन,आदित्य,ऋभव,अस्वप्न,अमर्त्य,अमृतान्धस्,बर्हिर्मुख,क्रतुभुज्,गीर्वाण,दानवारि,वृन्दारक,दैवत,देवता,दिव्योपपादुक,विवस्वत्,अनिमिष



The above is the list of synonyms I got

  

The first is the word निर्जर- (निर्गता जरा येभ्यः - ते निर्जराः) ending in अ, but the word जरा is replaced by जरस् optionally, by the rule "जराया जरसन्यतरस्याम्"when followed by case-ending beginning with a vowel as we are taught to decline the word while learning सिद्धान्तकौमुदी. So only in case-endings beginning with a vowel, it will get the form निर्जरस् in the word. Otherwise, it is निर्जर ending in "अ" and not either निर्जरस् or निर्जरस as seen listed in the synonyms of Amara I got during the search. 

  

The next is the word ऋ+भु - ending in उ as derived from the root भू + डु prefixed with ऋ = either Aditi, or the स्वर्ग as अव्यय like the words मितद्रु etc. according to the Vartika. And not ऋभव as shone in the list above, ending with "अ". Here below is the entry I got from शब्दकल्पद्रुम CD database.

Anyhow other entries also need to be rechecked for accuracy. Otherwise, such errors would be glaring ones if one tries it at random.
