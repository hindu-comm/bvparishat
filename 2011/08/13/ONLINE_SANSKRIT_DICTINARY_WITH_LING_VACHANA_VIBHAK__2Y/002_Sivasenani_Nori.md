The Monier-Williams dictinoary is about the maximum coverage in these dictionaries. The next level of dictionary / encyclpedia are represented by the Vaacaspatyam and Sabdakalpadruma. These are at least four times more in sheer bulk than Monier-Williams. Many of the entries in Vaacaspatyam read like veritable essays with most of the relevant source material being quoted there itself.For Vedic karmas (thatis my limited exposure to using theVaacaspatyam),all the required information is given under one heading with all the references;I doubt whether more comprehensiveinformation can be compiled without a few weeks of effort. Similarly in terms of etymology, Taranatha Tarka Vacaspati is a mostaccessibleguru. Soft copies of both the dictionariesare available freely (they are out of copyright) on the internet. Links to the twelve volumes (six of each, about 1,000 pages in each volume) are given in:

The Sanskrit Academy, Hyderabad also sells a Vaacaspatyam CD for Rs. 100/- which makes the entire Vaacaspatyam searchable. Given the treasure in that, it is almost as good as free. This project was shepherded by Dr. Shrinivas Warkhede.



I heard that there is a similar project to make the Sabdakalpadruma searchable, but I do not know the status of that project.



It would be nice if one of the Indian Universities takes the database and makes the search available online, along the lines of dictionaries listed in the email below. Many in this group criticise Western Indologists, but it is striking that all the online resources listed are the result of those same institutions.Now we have 14 dedicated Sanskrit Universities, a number of other Institutions and Universities with very good Sanskrit departments, the know-how to make search available, the required resouces (budget etc.),a need from both academic scholars and general enthusiasts for such a resource, and a unique resource in both these dictionaries being more or less made searchable. It would be a truly great contribution to Sanskrit studies along the lines of the IITK super site on Vedanta.
