Madam



There is a version of Amara Kosha in roman diacritical letters, in three volumes without any vyaakhya,available at <http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gret_utf.htm#Lex>. You can use the search feature in your browser(Ctrl+F) feature to find a particular word. One needs to be careful in using this feature. For instance the maaghakaavyam uses a word sIrin; if you search for this word, you will not find it, because it is listed as sIrapANih. sIra is a plough, and the one whohas a plough (sIrin) and the one who holds a plough in his hand are equivalent, both of course referring to Balarama. The input has been done by Messrs Avinash Sathaye and Pramod SV Ganesan in April 1997.



The same has been made available in Devanagari characters at <http://sanskritworld.in/unicode-sanskrit-books/>. This page itself is pretty long. So it is quicker tosearch the pageusing the string Amarakosa.



If you want with vyaakhya, there is one available at <http://www.archive.org/details/amarakoa00amaruoft>and many vyaakhyasat <https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=64ca520e752d39ed&id=64CA520E752D39ED%21135#cid=64CA520E752D39ED&id=64CA520E752D39ED%21378>courtesy the Digital Library of India and Mr. Ajit Krishnan.



There are a number of Koshas like the Halayuda kosha, Vaijayanti, Medini kosha, Dhananjaya naama maala and a number of ekaakshara koshas, apart from the first 'thesaurus' of the world (what a shame to use a 200-year old name to describe a 2500+-yearold work): the nighaNTu.  

Sometime back, on 13th April 2011, there was post in this forum itself by Sri Krishna Kumar ([adlbna...@gmail.com]()- I think the Kaumudi is his subject of research) mentioning that the Siddhantakaumdui names eight koshas. I reproduce a part of that email here:



"... the author\[of theSiddhanta Kaumudi\]has used 8 names of different kosas.  
1. Amarakosa  
2. Kosha  
3. Dharanikosa  
4. Medini kosa  
5. Samsaravarta Kosa  
6. Viswakosa  
7. Haima Kosa  
8. Halayudha kosa

number 2 named kosa is my problem. The author has used word 'कोशात्'  
and 'कोश' in different areas and it is not amarakosa.. we are getting  
the words like इति अमरकोशात्, इति मेदिनी कोशात्, इति  
विश्वकोशात्. ..but here we are getting कोशात् only. then which kosa it  
is, who is the author. if it is [published.in](http://published.in) this book, the author  
quoted the word kosa more than 78 times."



On the same day, Prof. S. P. Narang replied: "You may check: Vogel: Sanskrit Lexicography or my: Sanskrit kosasastra ke vividha ayama ( Hindi Language ) ( A history of  
lexicography). Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi, 1998. References to a  
number of works are available in the bibliography."
