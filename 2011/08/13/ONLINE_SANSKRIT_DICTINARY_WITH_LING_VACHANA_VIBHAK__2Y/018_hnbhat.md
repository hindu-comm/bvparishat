Shabdakalpadruma and Vācaspatyam are also listed but can't be accessed, it appears. If these too are available, then the resource can be of very great utility.

Here are both dictionaries available online along with many others.

Please check each and find suitable to you. All give the Sanskrit words and not ling vacant vibhakti. Also the two mentioned do not give vacant vibhakti and only give only linga of the word as in any dictionary. Some give the words nominative case, but not in all cases. One should learn from grammar books in all the vacan and vibhakti and dictionaries are not meant for it.
