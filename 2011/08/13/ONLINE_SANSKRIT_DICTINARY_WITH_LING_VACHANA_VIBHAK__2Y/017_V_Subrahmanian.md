Thanks for the link. Of the several dictionaries listed there, it appears that not all are available as of now. Only three of them are checked in the boxes. Shabdakalpadruma and Vācaspatyam are also listed but can't be accessed, it appears. If these too are available, then the resource can be of very great utility.

  

Kindly clarify. 

  

regards
