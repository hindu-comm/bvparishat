Introduction  
  
Schoyen Collection of manuscripts (MS) in Oslo, Norway, list the following eight Indus seals (all carrying inscriptions composed of hieroglyphs which can be read rebus in mleccha) These are included in <http://www.scribd.com/doc/2232464/epigraphica> This URL contains pictures of some manuscripts from the Schoyen collection which comprises most types of manuscripts from the whole world spanning over 5000 years. It is the largest private manuscript collection formed in the 20th century. The whole collection MSS 1-5245, comprises 13,010 manuscript items, including 2,172 volumes. 6,510 manuscript items are from the ancient period, 3300 BCE - 500 CE. Included in this manuscript collection are some epigraphs closely associated with the script of the Sarasvati-Sindhu (Indus) civilization.  
  
\* MS 4602 Indus Valley, ca. 3000 BC  
\* MS 5062 Indus Valley, 2200-1800 BC  
\* MS 5065 Indus Valley, ca. 1800 BC  
\* MS 2645, Afghanistan, 23rd-21st c. BC  
\* MS 4617, Indus Valley, ca. 2200-2000 BC  
\* MS 4619, Mohenjo-Daro, ca. 2200-1800 BC  
\* MS 5059, Indus Valley, 2200-1800 BC  
\* MS 5061, Indus Valley, 2200-1800 BC  
  
...It is remarkable that almost all the hieroglyphs used on the two seals – MS 5059 and MS 2645 – relate to the repertoire of a turner/smith artisan of the civilization and provenance from Meluhha (mleccha) – using mlecchita vikalpa (alternative form of cryptographic writing) on Indus script. The annex details many lexemes cognate with these rebus readings. These lexemes are from the Indian linguistic area and are relatable to the hieroglyphs of the Indus script.  
  
...In the context of a typical Indus script glyph – crocodile - an exquisite[Bastar bronze](http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/08/decoding-bastar-bronze-sculpture-of.html)statue depicting a mother and a crocodile clinging to her breasts has been reviewed. The ‘crocodile’ glyph is also seen on a Seal of the Schoyen collection: MS 5059.The Schoyen collection also includes MS 2645 (Indus cylinder seal) and MS 2814 (Cuneiform inscription) which clearly point to the possible interactions between Meluhha and Mesopotamia.  
  
...That these glyphs read rebus point to a legacy of stone-workers, turners is consistent with the archaeological evidence of the artefacts associated with the Indus script seal finds.
