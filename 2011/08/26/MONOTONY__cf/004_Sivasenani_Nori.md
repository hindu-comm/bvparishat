I think nIrasa\* is the amongst the closest for the intended lakshaNArtha of monotonous, in which sense it is more commonly used.



There is a utility for reverse search provided by University of Cologne available here: <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/>. It also includes Apte's English - Sanskrit dictionary.

The searches result in: ekasvara, ekaSruti, ekayama, kUj, tAna and viralabhakti(and variants thereupon). The last one is interesting; it is used by Kalidasa in RaghuvamSa.



bhavati viralabhaktir mlānapuṣpopahāraḥ

svakiraṇpariveṣodhbedaśūnyāḥ pradīpāḥ  
ayam api ca giraṃ nas tvatprabodhaprayuktām

anuvadati śukas te mañjuvāk pañjarasthaḥ // Ragh_5.74 //



MallinAtha: viralabhaktih - viralaracanah bhavati.  
  
M. R. Kale's translation: The flower-offering, being withered, has become loose in texture; the lamps are void of the throbbing circles (halo) of their light; and this your sweet -speaking parrot resting in its cage, imitates our speech employed to rouse you.



He has the following in notes: viralam bhaktiryasya.napumsakapUrvapado bahuvrIhih. If we dissolve as viralA bhaktiryasya we shall not get virala, pumvadbhAva being prohibited with words of the priyAdi class to which bhakti belongs. According to bhojarAja, however, viralA bhaktiryasya will also do, if bhakti be derived from bhaj by adding 'ti' bhAve (meaning 'arrangement'). See Mallinatha on driDhabhakti XII.19.

\* as used by the poet Trivikrama Bhatta in Nalachampu in describing Aryavarta: "grAmyakavikavitvamiva nIrasasyamanoharah". The play there was that the grAmya kavi's poetry is nIrasa,devoid of elements of interest and that Aryavarta is beautiful with water and crops (nIra.sasya.manoharah).
