Monotony = single or same sound throughout  

===========  
Thanks for coming up with precise meaning for the technical terms and their usage. Each lcanguage has its own रूढि which cannot be translated into another language. In Sanskrit, we have the maximum योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी which holds good for each of the languages accoding to its रूढ meaning. Cultural elements in the language conveyed could not be translated at all vis-a-vis to another language.  
  
I too endorse your opinion. Only if any, an explanation in another language would be proper than a literal translation. Monotony has a and negative meaning pejorative inclination in its usage, than the positive technical meaning of एकश्रुति as used in Sanskrit language.
