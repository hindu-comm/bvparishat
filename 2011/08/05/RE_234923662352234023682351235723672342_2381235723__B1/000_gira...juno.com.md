Respected Scholars, namaskar!



Sanskrit and Information Theory!



I agree with views expressed by Prof Tushar Sarkar. I am delighted at his reference to Information theory and Redundancy. As a matter of fact it would be great research project to apply some of rules of Information theory to Sanskrit. In linguistics redundancy and information are discussed along with formality and flexibility. Information content per letter-sound of Sanskrit is worth discussing. Also how much formality should we bring in our language? This question is related to the fever of Sanskrit grammarians for "Laaghavatva". If language is to be used by all people, then percentage of formality and flexibility certainly comes into play. Would it be wrong if I say higher the formality, the greater is the tendency of people not to use it or modify it by increasing redundancy. Thus came into existence the play between Sanskrit and Praakrit (apabhransha bhaas'a) in the ancient India. On this background to calculate information and redundancy in Sanskrit would be interesting project. In my book (not published yet) I discussed this topic. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Dear Scholars and Friends,  
I am a regular reader of postings on thebvp site.Of late, I read some postings on 'killing BVP' & also responses to it. Personally, I became aware of our ancient Indian history & tradition, especially from the postings by scholars like C.K.Raju (on Indian Mathematics tradition), of S.Kalyanaramana (on Harappan script & cultureas well as onancient Aryan culture etc.,). I believe theseshould beconsidered extremely relevant topicsfor any **'vidvan'**who is an open-minded Indian. I saw someone expressing the view that Kalyanaramana's postings on 'Indian Ocean Community' is **NOT** relevantfor BVP site & its objectives.I strongly disagree.Once we take 'vidvan' in its broad sense, drawing a sharp line between what is relevant and what is not, becomes a very tricky matter. I admit that some postings in the past ( for example, the one on what price some Muslim organizations 'proposed/fixed' for non-muslim Indian girls, for Muslim youths to marry') is **certainly irrelevant.** But the veryfact that I differ from some others about the relevance of postings by Raju, Kalyanaramana etc., shows how important our personal biases are for drawing a line between 'relevant' & 'irrelevant'. Possibly, most of the BVP members are Sanskritists, yet I feel that some of the postings on the etymology/derivation of some Sanskrit words/ meaning of some prakriti-pratyayas are not that terriblyrelevant to the BVP objective either.This does **not** entitle me to say that they are irrelevant. Relevance is a matter of being dovetailed into one's personal academic **orientationGestalt.**In Information Theory, using**redundancy** is a way of eliminating uncertainty/error. There may be some irrelevant postings in BVP. Consider those as needless 'redundancy'.However,in order to blockthem, itcanhardly bean advisable strategyto'throw the baby alongwith the bath tub'-- to kill the BVP site itself. Long live BVP site.
