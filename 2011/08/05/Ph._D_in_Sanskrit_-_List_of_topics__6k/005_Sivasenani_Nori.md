Sir



You are right. In trying to follow up on your comment, I came across two more resources.



One is the INFLIBNET, the Information and Library Network of UGC, which has over 2.25 lakh dissertations in its database (there are eight other bibliographical databases - including one of books). The same can be searched here:<http://indcat.inflibnet.ac.in/indcat/>



There are 6,950 theses available when we search with the keyword Sanskrit under Subject.



INFLIBNET has another project called Shodhganga, which is a repository of Ph. D. theses. One can search it here: <http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/>#



The number available is much lesser, but the entire thesis is available.For example, here is one of the theses that had come upI searched for"advaita": <http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/1358>



I am pleasantly surprised to know all this (I am not from an academic background - was trained as an engineer and manager, worked for 17 years and took a break to study Sanskrit - now in second year of MA). Surely the learned Professors on this list would know all about it; even so, if there were a few like me who do not know, I thought it would be useful to post this.



One important appeal to all scholars. Please do submit your work to Shodhganga. That gives two benefits: First, your work would be noticed more - nowadays it is not kavitvam that brings in fame and money, but it is paaNDityam; so, more noticed means better "prospects". Second, it would be a service to fellow scholars. To see how much scope there is, consider this: We have nearly 500 Universities in India; of these, theses from only 230 Universities are available in INFLIBNET; and about 25 Universities have made their theses available on Shodhganga.
