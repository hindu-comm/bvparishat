There is no dought that Prof. K. V. Sarma has done a great work by  
listing all the sanskrit thesis of Indian Universities and we have to  
greatful to Prof. Siniruddh Dash and Prof. Kutumba Sastry, by whose help  
it has come to exit. I feel like it is not a problem. But it need to  
updated time to time at least twice in a year. Which ever way you write  
people will understand. It is not like earlier.  
  
Second thing the second sanskrit commissioner can suggest for "National  
Manuscript Library" where we can also preserve this thesises also they  
can take care of updating this website.  
All the manuscri library can either provide or borrowed a copy of there  
manuscripts to make a complete Manuscript Library in India. From  
individual also we will try to get of there manuscripts.  
Hope that will be a great work.
