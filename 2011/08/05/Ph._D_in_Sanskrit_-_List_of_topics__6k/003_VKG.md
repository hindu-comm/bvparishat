Dear Sivasenani  
  
Please note that it is the Project of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, not  
of the said professor.  
He might have provided the link or some of the inputs. Similarly UGC  
maintains a database, out of which Sanskrit might have been separated.  
  
The links were provided to us some time earlier by the members of this  
forum.  
Regards
