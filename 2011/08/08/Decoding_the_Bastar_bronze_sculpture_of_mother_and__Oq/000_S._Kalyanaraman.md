### Decoding the Bastar bronze sculpture of mother and crocodile

[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZgsoW8Y5Msk/Tj87j3lqsDI/AAAAAAAAOiY/J6X9C5KY2D4/s400/bastar1.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZgsoW8Y5Msk/Tj87j3lqsDI/AAAAAAAAOiY/J6X9C5KY2D4/s1600/bastar1.png)

This is a bronze sculpture attributed to Bastar artisans. I found this statue shown in a[blog post](http://knowbastar.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/the_mother_goddess_folk_bronze_from_bastar_zk06.jpg). This description claims the bronze to be from Bastar (Orissa). But, a blurb on a slide showing the same statue on a school ppt links it to Indus civilization reads: "Small sculptures in stone, terra cotta, and bronze appear to represent priestly or governmental officials, dancing girls, and perhaps mother goddesses." <http://www.leon.k12.fl.us/>  
Location of Bastar (southern Chattisgarh, close to Orissa border)

I think the artist is trying to convey something important through the use of the motifs. In my usual penchant for rebus reading, I thought this could refer to a cowherd woman, goi; also meaning 'lizard, crocodile' in Oriya language. I think we have to refer this to some Bastar tribespeople and investigate further. Conjecture 1: Could this be a method used by the Bastar artisan to denote the Oriya lexeme, goi?  
  
Or. goi ʻ female of cowherd caste ʼ (CDIAL 4289)  
N. gohi, guhi ʻ crocodile ʼ; A. gũi ʻ iguana ʼ,Or. gohi, goi, gui; Mth. gohi ʻ alligator ʼ (CDIAL 4286).  
  
Conjecture 2: Is there any significance for the motif of lizard/crocodile clinging to the body of the exquisite brass statue? The bronze sculpture is a legacy of the metaphors of Indus civilization which used glyphs to denote lexemes - in particular, the repertoire of artisans.  
  
Bastar is in a rich mineral belt of India; a veritble of mine or rich iron ore resources (see news report annexed).  
  
Consistent with my reading rebus of many bizarre Indus glyphs, I think this bronze statue (made using the cire perdue technique) is to be read as ligatured glyph using lexemes from Indian linguistic area.  
  
The lexemes which match the orthography of the sculpture are as follows:  
  
  
kāru a wild crocodile or alligator (Te.) ayakāra ‘blacksmith’ (Pali) kāruvu = mechanic, artisan, Viśvakarma, the celestial artisan (Te.)  
  
kōla = woman (Nahali) Rebus: kol ‘metal; working in iron’ (Ta.)  
  
dhāˊtu n. ʻ substance ʼ RV., m. ʻ element ʼ MBh., ʻ metal, mineral, ore (esp. of a red colour) ʼ Mn., ʻ ashes of the dead ʼ lex., ʻ \*strand of rope ʼ (cf. tridhāˊtu -- ʻ threefold ʼ RV., ayugdhātu -- ʻ having an uneven number of strands ʼ KātyŚr.). \[√dhā\]  
Pa. dhātu -- m. ʻ element, ashes of the dead, relic ʼ; KharI. dhatu ʻ relic ʼ; Pk. dhāu -- m. ʻ metal, red chalk ʼ; N. dhāu ʻ ore (esp. of copper) ʼ; Or. ḍhāu ʻ red chalk, red ochre ʼ (whence ḍhāuā ʻ reddish ʼ; M. dhāū, dhāv m.f. ʻ a partic. soft red stone ʼ (whence dhā̆vaḍ m. ʻ a caste of iron -- smelters ʼ, dhāvḍī ʻ composed of or relating to iron ʼ); -- Si. dā ʻ relic ʼ; -- S. dhāī f. ʻ wisp of fibres added from time to time to a rope that is being twisted ʼ, L. dhāī˜ f. (CDIAL 6773)  
  
(B),,(B),,(B),,(B),,(F) {NB} \`\`^breast, ^teat; breast-^milk''. Pl. \<-le>. \|\<-kui>,\<-kwi> \`woman'. E.g.\`to hold the breast (a form of courtship)'. @B15260,N51. #6882.  
  
\`\`^big-headed'':  
Sa. DaDu \~ DaTu \`big-headed'.Mu. DaDu \`big-headed'.KW DaDu@(M068)  
  
So, I read the sculpture as denoting:  
DaTu kola kaaru: DaTu 'big head'; kola 'woman'; rebus: dhatu 'mineral'; kola 'metal'; kaaru 'crocodile'; rebus: kaaru 'artisan'. Thus, the sculpture denotes the mineral, metal artisan.  
  
Mineral resources of Bastar  
  
[Chhattisgarh spots four new iron ore deposits](http://www.miningtopnews.com/chhattisgarh-spots-four-new-iron-ore-deposits.html)  
Monday, April 23rd 2007  
Chhattisgarh has located four new iron ore deposits with an estimated 71 million metric tonnes of finest quality reserves.  
The state’s mineral department conducted a widespread survey for a year and located iron ore reserves of over 40 million metric tonnes in Iklama and Sindhari areas in Kawardha district, an official release said Monday.  
‘Besides Kawardha, 15 million metric tonne iron ore reserves were located in Rowghat area in hilly Bastar district, 11 million metric tonnes in forested Aridongri region in Kanker district and about five million metric tonnes in Dantewada district’s Bailadila pockets,’ the release added.  
Officials claim that Chhattisgarh’s hilly chain, beginning from Dalli Rajhara in Durg district to Bailadila, has two billion tonnes of iron ore stocks that alone account for India’s 18.55 percent of total iron ore reserves.  
Chhattisgarh, ranked second in the country in mineral production, has 20 percent of India’s iron ore deposits.  
The state’s Bailadila hilly region, divided into 14 deposits, is one of the world’s largest and finest quality iron ore stocks where public sector National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd (NMDC) has major iron ore facilities since 1967 for large domestic supply and exports to China and Japan.  
The state government signed a deal in July 2006 with the NMDC to set up a joint venture for opening up a deposit no-13 in Bailadila – with 35 million metric tones reserves.  
Information from: IANS via [in.news.yahoo.com](http://in.news.yahoo.com)  
  
Chattisgarh  
  
Among India's most mineral-rich states, producing 28 major minerals, including coal and iron ore.  
  
Produces approximately 16% of India’s coal, 10% of iron ore, 5% bauxite, 5% limestone and 88% tin.  
  
Fifth largest contributor to the value of minerals produced; generating Rs 5049 crore in 2004-05.  
  
Mining contributes 12% to the state's GDP  
  
About 90,000 ha of land is under mining.  
  
44% of the state's land area is under forests (12% of the country's forested area); most of the dense forests are in the mineral-rich districts.  
  
Ranks 2nd in terms of total forest land diverted for mining in India.  
  
Tribals comprise 31% of the state's total population - Dantewada, Bastar, Surguja are most mined districts.  
  
About 40.5% of the state's population lives below the poverty line. Despite large-scale mining projects, six of the seven key mining districts are listed in the 150 most backward districts in India.  
  
The state is witnessing increased industrial activity in recent years. This has been accompanied by protests in different parts of the states – Bastar, Korba, and Dantewada districts, in particular.  
  
DANTEWADA  
  
Has rich reserves of iron ore, tin and corrandum. Around 2010 ha of land in the district is already under mining with leading steel companies envisaging interest in the district.  
  
Rich forest reserves with 64% of its land under forest cover and almost 79% tribal population. Although rich in natural wealth, the district has not seen much development - only 30% of the population is literate; about a half of the state's population has access to clean drinking water; and less than 25% population has access to electricity. The district ranks seventh among the 150 backward districts of the country.  
.  
Essar Steel acquired land for its steel plant in the tribal villages of Dhurli and Bhansi, despite widespread local opposition. Many suspect that the company, in cahoots with the government, used coercion to obtain special permission from the Gram Sabha to acquire land in this Schedule V area.  
  
Dantewada and the neighbouring district of Bastar is affected by naxalism. Maoists are against transfer of land to the companies and have threatened to disrupt mining operations. In a recent attack, some villagers who had handed over their land to Essar Steel, were killed.  
BAILADILA  
  
The hills are rich with dense deciduous forests - an ecological hotspot; its vast reserves of high quality iron ore also places the area's biodiversity under serious threat from mining.  
  
Mining and industrialisation have devastated the region, especially places like Kirandul, Bacheli and Bhansi.  
  
The Shankhini and Dankini rivers, which flow through the region are among the most polluted in India. Shankhini is often referred to as 'lal pani' (red waters); people from about 100 villages are dependant on this water source.  
  
Iron ore tailings from National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC)’s Bailadila mines have polluted the river and also damaged 35,000 ha of agricultural and forest land. On account of this, state government directed the company to dig 200 wells in 65 villages affected along the river.  
  
Most of the drinking water wells are dry.

BASTAR (on the right bank of Indravati river)  
  
Government here too has helped private mining companies to acquire land in Schedule V villages of Bastar. The companies are Tata’s plant at Lohinduga and NDMC’s plant at Nagarnar.  
  
Nagarnar has witnessed a long-drawn conflict between the locals and the state over land allotment to the public sector NMDC. The struggle also turned violent when activists protesting against the project were apprehended and shot at by the police; 45 people, mostly women, were injured and around 250 people were jailed.  
  
An inquiry conducted by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (NCSCST) concluded that the acquisition process violated the constitutional mandate for scheduled areas and therefore was null and void.  
  
Inspite of the NCSCST findings and protests by locals, the state government still went ahead with the land acquisition process.  
  
Nagarnar steel plant is yet to start functioning because of technological failures in using iron filling waste from the Bailadila mines.  
  
Conclusion  
  
Clearly, the statue has to be meaningful for the artisan who made this exquisite bronze using the cire perdue technique of bronze casting which harks back to the days of Indus-Sarasvati civilization. Similar technique is used for bronze casting in Swamimalai on the banks of River Kaveri in Tamil Nadu.  
  
Further investigations are needed to unravel the metallurgical traditions of Bastar and their roots which perhaps may lie in Sarasvati metallurgical heritage.  
  
The rebus reading of the glyptics of the sculpture (woman, breasts, crocodile)is relatable to the Indian linguistic area. The reading is suggested as a calling card of a smith of Bastar: mineral, metal, artisan: dhatu kola kaaru. It is significant that the lexeme khar means 'blacksmith' in Kashmiri; kaaru denotes a crocodile in Telugu language. kola means 'woman' in Nahali language. kol means 'metal' in Tamil. dhatu means 'mineral' in Prakrit language; datu also means woman's breast in Munda language. I suggest that these lexemes relate to the Indian linguistic area from the days of Indus-Sarasvati civilization and the practice of using[hieroglyphs](http://tinyurl.com/3onyak4)decoded as connoting, rebus, the repertoire of artisans.  
  
Yes, there is a time gap of millennia between the possible date of this Bastar bronze and the Indus-Sarasvati metallurgical, sculpturl tradition exemplified by the 'dancing girl' bronze wearing the same types of bangles and anklets as shown on this Bastar bronze. Yes, the Hindu civilization has an abiding presence and continuum in the Indian linguistic area - as evidenced by the use of metaphors of Indus script glyphs which continued into the punch-marked and cast coins of the historical periods. One early coin showed a crocodile catching a fish as note by[Theobald](http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2011/08/Yes,%20there%20is%20a%20time%20gap%20of%20millennia%20between%20the%20possible%20date%20of%20this%20Bastar%20bronze%20and%20the%20Indus-Sarasvati%20metallurgical,%20sculpturl%20tradition%20exemplified%20by%20the%20'dancing%20girl'%20bronze%20wearing%20the%20same%20types%20of%20bangles%20and%20anklets%20as%20shown%20on%20this%20Bastar%20bronze.%20Yes,%20the%20Hindu%20civilization%20has%20an%20abiding%20presence%20and%20continuum%20in%20the%20Indian%20linguistic%20area%20-%20as%20evidenced%20by%20the%20use%20of%20metaphors%20of%20Indus%20script%20glyphs%20which%20continued%20into%20the%20punch-marked%20and%20cast%20coins%20of%20the%20historical%20periods.%20One%20early%20coin%20showed%20a%20crocodile%20catching%20a%20fish%20as%20noteS%20by%20Theobald.). W. Theobald,*Symbols on punch-marked coins of Hindustan*(1890, 1901). This glyptic combination is a unique metaphor of Sarasvati hieroglyphs evidenced in Indus script inscriptions. This metaphor of fish + crocodile read rebus: aya kaara 'metal smith'.
