Please do not forward such anonymous junk mail containing false alarms. There are many such that circulate continually (authored by people who have more free time on their hands than most of us, and very little sense of social responsibility). There are websites (most notably, [snopes.com](http://snopes.com)) which debunk such urban myths and legends.
