Here is a question for which I would appreciate answers from our learned audience.

The three gunas (sattva, rajas and tamas) are used as categories of classification in many knowledge systems in Hindu thought. While the philosophical schools and Ayurveda are well known where this classification occurs the Gita as we all know uses this tripartite division for so many things like sraddhaa, yajna etc (17^(th) chapter for instance). While I have seen papers by scholars on some aspect of the three gunas there does not seem to be a single book (to the best of my knowledge) on the three gunas dealing with the concept in a comprehensive and comparative manner. Perhaps in my limited knowledge I am unaware of such a work. I would be grateful to scholars who can throw light on (1) whether there is such a comprehensive work on the GUNAS and (2) where else do we find this classification used widely apart from philosophy and Ayurveda

. Thank you

Om
