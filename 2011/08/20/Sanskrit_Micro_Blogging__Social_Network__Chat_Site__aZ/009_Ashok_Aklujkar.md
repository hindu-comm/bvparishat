Dear Rukmani,

  

Please see Helaa-raaja's commentary on the first two kaarikaas of the Li:nga-samudde;sa. Toward the end, you will see a citation with tathaa hi sa.mgrahakaara.h pa.thati, "sa.mstyaana.m ... striitvam, prasavo .... puµstvam, avivak.saata˙ ... napuµsakatvam" iti. The Sa.mgraha is ascribed to Vyaa.di in the Vaiyaakara.na tradition.

  

To understand the quotation you will need to read practically the whole of the Li:nga-samudde;sa (which is not a long chapter) but most importantly thecommentary on the first two kaarikaas.

  

ashok
