Dear Rukmani,

  

See chapter 13, Li:nga-samudde;sa, of the third book, Prakriir.na-kaa.n.da, of Bhart.r-hari's Vaakyapadiiya, K.A. Subramania Iyer's translation of it (1974, Delhi: MLBD) and his summation of the chapter in his 1969 bookBhart.r-hari: a Study of theVaakyapadiiya in the Light of the Ancient Commentaries, Poona: Deccan College.

  

But all this will be philosophical and in your second post on the matter you clarified that you were looking for something other than philosophical.

  

The tradition of looking at grammatical gender through the Saa.mkhya way of thinking in terms of three gu.nas probably goes all the way back to Vyaa.di, that is, to pre-Pata;njali times.

  

ashok
