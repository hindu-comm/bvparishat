Thank you Ashok for this information. I am familiar with those works but they concentrate on the philosophies mainly. I also am familiar with Gerry Larson’s Ayurveda paper. But I would like to know if apart from popular usage the three gunas are used seriously in any other branch of scholarship like literature, drama, etc., and whether there are any books on that.
