Hello Ashok,

This is very interesting. Even though philosophical it is a different
take to just a philosophical approach to the ‘guna’ issue and I certainly welcome this. The grammatical gender based on the Samkhya ‘gunas’ is a novel twist. You say it goes back to ‘Vyaadi”. But how do you infer that? Is there some reference somewhere which makes you say that? If you do have any further information on that please let me know. I have Subrahmania Iyer’s Bhartrhari book and will certainly check this out. Thank you for the reference.

Om
