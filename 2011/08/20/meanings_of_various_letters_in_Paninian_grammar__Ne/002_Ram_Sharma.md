Thanks,Prof Aklujkar,for your enquiry about the PaaNinian single letters.As far as I can see ,they are mostly used as the tools of linguistic description.EG It-designated K debars guNa-vRddhi ;in Taddhita it serves as a descriptive tool for vRddhi of the initial vowel of the stem.

 Sometimes,the single letters are used as shortest symbols of bigger morphophonemic alterations.EG Pha =Aayana,Cha =Iiya,Gha=iya,kha=iina.Dha=eya .

 Also as a tool for describing the placement of the relevant operation.EG it-designated m in shnam serves as a tool for describing the placement of na after ru in surface forms like ruNaddhi.

 I hope ,the BVParisHad including Prof. Aklujkar is participating in WSC in Jan 2012,More we can discuss about ``such problems there during Jan 5-10 ,2012.



All the best for the ParisHad and also for an eminent scholar like Prof Aklujkar,

 Ram Karan Sharma
