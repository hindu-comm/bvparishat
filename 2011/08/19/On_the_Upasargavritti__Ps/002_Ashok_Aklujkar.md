The Upasargavritti to which you have referred is probably the same as the one edited by Dragomir Dimitrov. See the attachment for publication details.

As far as I could quickly check, the text sent by Shri Dhaval does not agree with the text edited by D.D. Nor does it agree with Tilaka's Nipatavyayopasargav,rtti published in 1951 by Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanams Press or the anonymous Laghuupasargav.rtti edited by V. Krishnamacharya and published in 1962 by Adyar Libary. However, a closer examination is necessary.
