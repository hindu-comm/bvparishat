Yes this is the upasargavritti which was supposed to follow chandravyakarana, as far as my limited knowledge goes.

But the manuscript is silent on that aspect...

  

In the manuscript, it follows another work "SaTkArakam (षट्कारकम्‌)" written by rabhasanandi... He was a buddhist / shvetambar jainist monk..

So it is quite possible that it might be the work of some Buddhist grammar....
