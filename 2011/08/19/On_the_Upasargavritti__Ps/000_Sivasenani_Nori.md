Congratulations! I have not earlier seen any work on Upasargas and so as a first impression find this very useful from a strictly pedagogical point of view. People read Sanskrit grammar to 'learn the language' that is, understand the meanings of words and sentencesbetter, yet the stand of grammarians is that their science only teaches the correct form of words and it is Niruktam that teaches meanings of words (while mImAmsA is supposed to teach the science of interpretation of sentences). In etymology, grammar is the preferred tool, but not the only one. Keeping aside the fine nuances in these views,a beginner gets only a vague idea of what Upasargas mean, and yet Upasargas are most frequent. A hypothesis such as"if we treat Upasargas and Dhatus asmeaning-units and compile a list of 20 most frequent meaning-units found in any given corpus, at least half would be Upasargas" might actually be tenable. Still, the sense conveyed by these important building blocks of words is not readily available with examples and only needs to be understood over time and with exposure. This work, to me with my limited knowledge, seems to serve the need brilliantly.



I glanced through the work, but did not read fully or inspect any element minutely. Based on that, my observations are:The difference between the 20 upasargas listed in the opening verse and the famous 22 prAdayah of grammar are that nis and dus are missing here. This work seems to assume that nis and nir are identical in the sense they convey, as are dus and dur. One couldconjecture that such, indeed, is the case and that in grammar they are differentiated to deal with the differing sandhi aspects. Normally such a conjecture should be supported by examples, but I am not learned enough in either grammar or literature to readily quote examples to support this conjecture. Either way, one could broadly say that the sense of all upasargas is more or less covered by this work.



There is supposed to be a Upasargavrittih attached to the Chandravyakarana composed by Chandragomin, a famous Buddhist philosopher and scholar of around 7th century AD. Is this that work? I do not know. Just another thought.
