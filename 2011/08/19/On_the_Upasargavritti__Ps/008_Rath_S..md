The script is not Oriya, but Ranjana script (Vartu variety, Newari). It has similarities with Oriya, Bengali etc..(eastern variety) as these scripts are direct descendants of Proto-Bengali -- which is from Eastern Naagarii ... and so on.  
With kind regards,

The proper course of action would be to contact Dr. Dimitrov at [dragomir...@hotmail.com]() \<mailto:[dragomir.dimitrov%40hotmail.com]()\> , but I get a feeling that the two works are not the same. The title of Dr. Dimitrov's paper has the verse containing the twenty upasargas in a script that looks like it is related to Bengali (scholars who can read Bengali could help). A picture of that verse is attached. I tried to decipher a few of the letters and they could be:  
  
20 Upasargas.jpg\<<https://webmail.vuw.leidenuniv.nl/exchange/raths1/Drafts/20%20Upasargas.jpg>\>  

?????????????????????????? ??? \_ ??????????? \_ ? \_ ?

????? \_ ...

  
This order does not confirm either with Dr. Dhaval Patel's text, or with the verse sent by Dr. Narayanan. Looks like this is a different version.

The Upasargavritti to which you have referred is probably the same as the one edited by Dragomir Dimitrov. See the attachment for publication details.  
  
As far as I could quickly check, the text sent by Shri Dhaval does not agree with the text edited by D.D. Nor does it agree with Tilaka's Nipatavyayopasargav,rtti published in 1951 by Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanams Press or the anonymous Laghuupasargav.rtti edited by V. Krishnamacharya and published in 1962 by Adyar Libary. However, a closer examination is necessary.
