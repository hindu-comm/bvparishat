Dear Sri Sivasenani Nori,  
Thanks for the great effort in bringing a photo of the manuscript on Upasargas to BVP. Whether it be Oriya, Bengali, or Old Type Devanagari, Tirutakshari, Asamese script as you like to call, it is very interesting to read. With my limited capacity of reading Devanagari, I tried make it in the following way. Criticism is welcomed on my limited view. I read it in following way:  
  
  
प्रपरापसमन्ववनिर्दुरव्याङपयाप्यतिसूदपयश्च।  
प्रतिना सह लंपितव्यापपूपयावधिलब्धमत्र।।  
I failed to find a metre also, so I am not sure whether I am correct up to what extent.
