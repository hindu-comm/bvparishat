The proper course of action would be to contact Dr. Dimitrov at [dragomir...@hotmail.com]() ,but I get a feeling that the two works are not the same. The title of Dr. Dimitrov's paper has the verse containing the twenty upasargas in ascript that looks like it is related toBengali (scholars who can read Bengali could help).A picture of that verse is attached. I tried to decipher a few of the letters and they could be:



![20 Upasargas.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/748493a8197b06f/20%20Upasargas.jpg?part=0.0.1 "20 Upasargas.jpg")



प्रपरापसमन्ववनिर्दुरत्याङ् न्य \_ याऽप्यानिसू \_ प \_ ।

प्रति \_ …



This order does not confirm either with Dr. Dhaval Patel's text, or with the verse sent by Dr. Narayanan. Looks like this is a different version.
