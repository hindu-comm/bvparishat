Dear Pandurangee,  
Your question is genuine but you overlooked a point; you overlooked the definition of Bhashya. Please remember सूत्रार्थो वर्ण्यते यत्र वाक्यैस्सूत्रानुसारिभि:। स्वपदानि च वर्ण्यन्ते भाष्यं भाष्यविदो विदु:  
In the light of this definition it is very clear that the authors of Bhashyas many times insert their own lines and comment them. There is no debate whether or not Vatsyayana wrote whole Nyayasutra; rather a few scholars doubt whether all Nyayasutras are written by a single author?
S C Vidyabhushana accepts that only first chapter is written by Akshapada and beginning from second chapter the left part is written by Gautam. In 1971 one book is published from Varanasi named वैदल्यसूत्रम् the book was available in Tibatan language and this was recreated in Sanskrit by Sampan Dorje. This book is written by Nagarjuna. The special character of this book is that Nagarjuna refutes every Sutras of first chapter of The Nyayasutras. He begins the text तर्कज्ञानाभिमाने
वादं य: कर्तुमिच्छति। तस्याहङ्कारनाशाय वच्मि वैदल्यसूत्रकम्।।  
Some scholars, therefore, think if in front of Nagarjuna he would have refuted all the Sutras not only sutras which belong to first chapter. Hence they conclude that the author of all Sutras is not one person; first chapter is written by Akshapada or Gautam, whatever the name be. The other chapters beginning from second is possibly written by Bhashyakara but" without showing his own name. Therefore there are many such' passages in the Bhashya. To refute this thesis I wrote a paper in 2002 entitled प्रथमाध्यायातिरिक्त न्यायसूत्रों का लेखक कौन है? I established that there is no such need to postulate the concept that other chapters are written by Any other person. The paper was published in the journal समाज धर्मदर्शन from Allahabad.
