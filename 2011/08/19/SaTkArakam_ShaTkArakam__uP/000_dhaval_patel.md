I feel great priviledge to present before this forum another work on grammar edited crudely by me.. (I came to know that this work has already been published by Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute)..

  

It is named SaTkArakam (षट्कारकम्‌). As upasargavRttiH deals with upasargas, this work deals with kArakas (कारक) and vibhakti pratyayas (विभक्ति प्रत्यय)

The author is known as rabhasananda or rabhasanandi (रभसनन्द / रभसनन्दी)

  

Hope you all enjoy this work...
