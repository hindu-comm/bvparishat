Respected Professor Pandurangi,  
It is of course the matter of happiness that Sanskrit University, Tirupati is always bringing out new treasure to the Sanskrit world, and currently in the form of भूषणसारतत्त्वप्रकाशिका by Professor K.V. Ramakrishnamacharya, Professor of Vyakarana, RS Vidyapeetha, Tirupati. I hope that the readers of such work can improve the knowledge and concept of grammatical studies with the help of such works. It also will be helpful if any reputed scholar like him, or himself, comments upon the texts like Vyutpattivada etc. with the initiation of such Sanskrit Universities.

Regards,  

Narayanan
