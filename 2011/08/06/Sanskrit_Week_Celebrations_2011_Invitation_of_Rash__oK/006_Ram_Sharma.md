We are all grateful to Dr Karan Singh,the then Chairman ,Central Sanskrit Board who gave the idea of celebrating Sanskrit Day on RaksHabandhan day.Some of Indian PaNchanga (Kameshvarasigh Darbhanga SaMskRtavishvavidyalya PaNchaaNgam e.g)lists this day as SaMskRtadivasaH.This is a day or now a Saptaaha when we should introspect and review ourselves about our responsibilities and those who are in the Govt should remind the govt of their responsibilities towards this PanINdian living language or tradition and a wellrecognised potent factor of national integration.

 All the best,

 Ram Karan Sharma``
