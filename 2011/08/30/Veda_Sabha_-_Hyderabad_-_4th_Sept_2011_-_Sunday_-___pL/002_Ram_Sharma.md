We should all congratulate bhagyanagara Vedasabha for organising such a sabha in Sep.It is unfortunate that i will not be physically present there.But spiritually speaking ,I have been always attaching much more importance to preservation of our great`` oral tradion of tadadhiite tad veda.Long live such Sabhas !Longlive such living embodiments of Vedas!
