\> Indra VyAkaraNa and Chandra VyAkaraNa

\> There is an interesting reference to the grammar of Sanskrit in the book, “On the Aindra School of Sanskrit Grammarians, “ by A.C.Burnell---in 1608 a Tibetan Lama TArAnAtha compiled a very remarkable history of Buddha’s teaching in India, in which he, more than once alluded to the Indra grammar. In his account of PANini, he states that though it was said in Tibet that Indra VyAkaraNa was earlier, this must be held of the region of the gods and not of Aryadesha. He added that according to the knowledge of Pundits the Chandra-VyAkaraNa agrees with PANini and the KalApa with the Indra VyAkaraNa ( I do not have idea about the truth in this). However my question is this-------------  
\> In the praise of (PANini) VyAkaraNa, the often narrated story is of Brihaspati teaching Indra for thousands of years without end in the foresight. Is Indra in Brihaspati-Indra story the same as author of Indra VyAkaraNa or different? Does Indra VyAkaraNa exist today? Was it PrePANinian VyAkaraNa? PANini mentioned the names of at least 10 grammarians before him. The list of Pre-PANinian grammarians appear to be slightly different in different references. Was Indra included in it? Let me have fortune to increase my knowledge through valuable opinions of scholars of bvparishat. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.

I am very far from being a scholar of Sanskrit, but here is what I know:

\(1\) The Paninian grammar is demonstrably incomplete, in the senses that (i) some well-known words like कृपालु are not explained by it, cf. the आलुच्-प्रत्यय not being stated to apply to कृपा in स्पृहिगृहिपतिदयिनिद्रातन्द्राश्रद्धाभ्य आलुच् (III.2.158); (ii) some other words like विश्वामित्र are explained in a one-off way rather than by application of a general rule or principle; and (iii) some usages like the occurrence of ळ in words like महिळा are not explained at all. There is a verse (quoted by Raghavendra Swami) purporting to list other grammars: इन्द्रश्चन्द्रःकाशकृत्स्नोऽपिशलिः शाकटायनः \| पाणिन्यमरजैनेन्द्रा एतेऽष्टावादिशाब्दिकाः \|\|

\(2\) Cardona's important study (1976, p. 146) notes: "In the Aṣṭādhyāyī Pāṇini mentions by name ten other persons, all presumably grammarians: Āpiśali, Kāśyapa, Gārgya, Gālava, Cakravarman, Bhāradvāja, Śākaṭāyana, Śākalya, Senaka, Sphoṭāyana." (See अष्टाध्यायी I-1-16, I-2-25, III-4-111, V-4-112, VI-1-92, VI-1-123, VI-1-130, VII-2-63, and VII-3-99 for such references.)

\(3\) There is a Jaina grammar that is still studied by adherents of that religion. I have heard that it is compatible with the Paninian grammar except that the Vedic usages are discarded.

\(4\) The चान्द्रव्याकरण is said to have influenced the काशिका (Cardona 1999, pp. 242--243); it is also said by others that the महाभाष्य on the अष्टाध्यायी was lost for many years and the tradition of its study had ceased when the काशिका was written (7th cent. CE?), which is why there is no explicit reference to the महाभाष्य in the काशिका. I have also heard that some सूत्रs of the चान्द्रव्याकरण are still extant but don't know where.

\(5\) The Aindra grammar was the primary source for Tolkappiyar's early Tamil grammar (Cardona 1976, Mimamsaka 1984).

\(6\) The names of Āpiśali and Kāśakṛtsna are mentioned by Patanjali in the महाभाष्य under अष्टाध्यायी IV-1-14. A शिक्षा text by आपिशलि, and a धातुपाठ as well as fragments of a grammatical सूत्र text both by काशकृत्स्न, are said to be yet extant. Kāśakṛtsna is also mentioned by name in the ब्रह्मसूत्र, viz., अवस्थितेरिति काशकृत्स्नः (I-4-23).

\(7\) Śākaṭāyana is only known from brief references by Yāska and the Paninians. Patanjali \`\`refers to Śākaṭāyana as the grammarian who held that all nouns  
were derived from verbs'' (Cardona 1976, p. 147).
