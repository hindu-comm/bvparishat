Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Indra VyAkaraNa and Chandra VyAkaraNa



There is an interesting reference to the grammar of Sanskrit in the book, “On the Aindra School of Sanskrit Grammarians, “ by A.C.Burnell---in 1608 a Tibetan Lama TArAnAtha compiled a very remarkable history of Buddha’s teaching in India, in which he, more than once alluded to the Indra grammar. In his account of PANini, he states that though it was said in Tibet that Indra VyAkaraNa was earlier, this must be held of the region of the gods and not of Aryadesha. He added that according to the knowledge of Pundits the Chandra-VyAkaraNa agrees with PANini and the KalApa with the Indra VyAkaraNa ( I do not have idea about the truth in this). However my question is this-------------

In the praise of (PANini) VyAkaraNa, the often narrated story is of Brihaspati teaching Indra for thousands of years without end in the foresight. Is Indra in Brihaspati-Indra story the same as author of Indra VyAkaraNa or different? Does Indra VyAkaraNa exist today? Was it PrePANinian VyAkaraNa? PANini mentioned the names of at least 10 grammarians before him. The list of Pre-PANinian grammarians appear to be slightly different in different references. Was Indra included in it? Let me have fortune to increase my knowledge through valuable opinions of scholars of bvparishat. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
