Book Description  
Publication Date: July 1, 2007  
India, once a major civilizational and economic power that suffered  
centuries of decline, is now newly resurgent in business, geopolitics  
and culture. However, a powerful counterforce within the American  
Academy is systematically undermining core icons and ideals of Indic  
Culture and thought. For instance, scholars of this counterforce have  
disparaged the Bhagavad Gita as a dishonest book ; declared Ganesha's  
trunk a limp phallus ; classified Devi as the mother with a penis and  
Shiva as a notorious womanizer who incites violence in India;  
pronounced Sri Ramakrishna a pedophile who sexually molested the young  
Swami Vivekananda; condemned Indian mothers as being less loving of  
their children than white women; and interpreted the bindi as a drop  
of menstrual fluid and the ha in sacred mantras as a woman's sound  
during orgasm. Are these isolated instances of ignorance or links in  
an institutionalized pattern of bias driven by certain civilizational  
worldviews? Are these academic pronouncements based on evidence, and  
how carefully is this evidence cross-examined? How do these images of  
India and Indians created in the American Academy influence public  
perceptions through the media, the education system, policymakers and  
popular culture? Adopting a politically impartial stance, this book,  
the product of an intensive multi-year research project, uncovers the  
invisible networks behind this Hinduphobia, narrates the Indian  
Diaspora's challenges to such scholarship, and documents how those who  
dared to speak up have been branded as dangerous
