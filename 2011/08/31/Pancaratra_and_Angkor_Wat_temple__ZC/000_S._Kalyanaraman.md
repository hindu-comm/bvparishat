This monograph seeks to establish that Angkor Wat temple was a temple in the Pancaratra tradition, a temple for Vishnu -- Vrah Vishnulok (Sacred Abode of Vishnu), presiding deity Vishnu, to whom the temple complex is dedicated. In the 13th century the Khmers embraced Buddhism and King Jayavarman VII absorbed Bauddham Wat into Vrah Vishnuloka. That is why these temples are inclusive of Hindu dharma and Bauddha dhamma traditions of worship.

King Jayavarman VII, National Museum, Phnom Penh, twelfth century. A number of similar statues have been found, and are also presumed to be his likeness. There is no intimation, in these statues, that the King was venerated or worshipped in a temple. In the Pancaratra tradition of temple construction and consecration of murti-s, artistic embellishments are invariably found in all murti-s to connote their sacredness (such as a mukuta or ear or neck ornaments). Such embellishments are absent in the statues of King Jayavarman VII, thus belying the hypotheses of some scholars who claim that some temples were 'funerary temples'.

Soldiers descend from Mount S'ivapada. Inscription K.268 was translated by E. Aymonier (1904) and George Coedes (1911). Represented twice are the king, two of his ministers and the rajahotar. Total 19 dignitaries are shown: Vrah kmraten an - VKA (His Lordship) are six; kamraten an - KA (Lord) are two and Anak sanjak - AS(protectors of the king) are eleven. The inscription records 'tnvay kamraten an pandita' ('the presents from the honorable pandits'); 'samtac vrah pada kamraten an paravishnuloka na stt nau vnam S'ivapada pi pancuh vala' ('His Majesty Paramavishnuloka, at the moment when he is on Mt. S'ivapada to make the army descend'); VKA's are: 'Shri Virasinhavarman', 'Shri Jayendravarman Ldau'; 'Shri Virendradhipativarman Chok Vakula'; 'Shri Virayudhavarman'; 'Shri Mahipatindravaman Canlattai'; 'Shri Ranaviravarman'; 'Shri Rajasinhavarman'; 'Narapatindravarman'; 'Shuradhiparivarman'; KA's are: 'Dhananjaya', 'Shri Varddha'; AS's are: Kancas Pryak, Mat Gnan ti hau; Vidyashrama ti hau; Virajaya, Aso Vnya Chlan to hau. Another message of the inscription is: 'Vrah pada kamraten Paramavishnuloka' ('The holy feet of his Grace Paramavishnuloka'. King Suryavarman II stands on the royal elephant turning his head back, accompanied by 15 parasols, five fans, six flywhisks, four banners and a standard with a statuette of Vishnu on the shoulder of Garuda.

A carved pedestal supports a linga. Tra Kieu. Ht. 43 cm. (Courtesy Paisarn Priemmattawat). Tr Kieu was known as Simhapura to the Chams. Glover (Glover, I.C., 1997,*The excavations of J.Y. Claeys at Tra Kieu*,*Central Vietnam, 1927-28*from the unpublished archives of the EFEO, Parts and records in possession of the Claeys family, JSS 85: 173-86) identified the settlement to the 5th and 6th centuries, with initial occupation in the last two or three centuries BCE. A fragment of pottery from the lowest layer has been identified as rouletted ware closely paralleling Arikamedu finds in India. This suggests maritime exchange was in place during the late first millennium BCE. (cf. Charles Higham,*Early cultures of Mainland Southeast Asia*, Chicago, Art Media Resources Ltd., p. 273)  
  
Paramavishnuloka is a reference to the memory of the ancestor, Suryavarman II 'he who has reached the realm of Vishnu'. All Suryavarman's ministers and associates are united on Mount S'ivapada. Rajahotar's presence denotes a s'raddha observance (remembering the ancestors). Vrah Vlen 'sacred fire' is carried in an ark on a type of palanquin, preceded by an orchestra.  
  
From S'ivapada of Chams to Vishnuloka of Suryavarman II is a remarkable syncretism of the traditions which have been documented in Indian traditions documented in Pancaratra samhitas (e.g. Sattvata and Ahirbudhnya Samhitas), Ramayana and Mahabharata -- and adapted in Angkor Wat and associated sites of the Cham-Kampuchean-Thai peoples who orgnized themselves into a state, Rajyam governed by*dharma-dhamma*Hindu-Bauddham continuum.  
  
Royal sacred power derives from adherance to*dharma-dhamma*, the eternal, cosmic, universal law. The sacred temples of Angkor are a testament to the sacred power of*dharma-dhamma*. Ancestors are deified and merit is earned by constructing temples, constructing reservoirs and performing*dharmic*acts.  
  
From Vishnuloka to S'ivapada, the function of the temple is to depict the steps for final liberation and attainment of Vrah Vishnuloka. This panel is the closest one gets to a s'raddha, an event venerating the ancestors with specific reference to royal associates in King Suryavarman II's reign.

It will be an incomplete representation of the message of the temple to view it as a 'funerary temple' for some kings of ancient Cambodia (cf. George Coedes, 1963,*Angkor, an introduction*, London, OUP, p. 38). Nor is it valid to record that the parikrama (circumambulation) of the temple praakaara has to be done counter-clockwise because in the Indian historical tradition, Ramayana chronologically precedes Mahabharata.

Angkor Thom and Angkor Wat depictions of Samudra manthanam  
92 asuras, 88 devas pulling the snake Vasuki.  
  
Both the epics do recount the narrative of Samudra manthanam (churning of the ocean).  
  
The divinity common to both the epics is Hanuman. The parikrama is done as in any Mandiram (temple) clockwise - starting with the Battle of Lanka narrative from Ramayana. Yes, there are narrative panels of Raja Suryarman's army on the march close to the Kurukshetra war narrative panel. This interpolation clearly demonstrates that there is no counter-clockwise parikrama prescribed for the worship in the temple of Angkor Wat.  
  
That the main entrance to the temple is from the West is not enough justification to indulge in flights of imagination that the temple has been constructed as a mausoleum for Kings and their ancestors. Yes, there is veneration of ancestors in both Hindu dharma-Bauddha dhamma traditions. The entire galaxy of divinities are deva-s who are pitr-s (ancestors). Rajadharma was the dominant theme and the Rajas were required to protect and promote dharma handed down from generation to generation. Dharma-dhamma is inviolate, eternal.

(After Fig. 21 in Vittorio Roveda opcit.: Dharma and Citragupta) Dharma is personified in the Sattvata and Ahirbudhnya Samhitas as one of the 39 Vyuhas (divine emanations). In a remarkable panel as part of the narratives describing svarga and naraka (heaven and hell), Dharma pronounces and Citragupta records the judgement on one's merits related to life-performance. Aymonier (1904,*Le Cambodge*, Leroux, Paris, III: 265) and Coedes (1911, Les bas-reliefs d'Angkor-Vat,*Bulletin de la Commission Archeologique de l'Indochine*, Paris: 204) have provided a reading of the inscriptions explaining the nomenclature of 32 naraka (hells) starting from Avici to Raurava (See below).

Bas relief panels showing[37 svargga (Top register) and 32 naraka (Bottom register)](http://www.billspictures.net/angkor/pages/ang030.htm)  
  
Names of 32 naraka detailed in 36 inscriptions (also listed in Sukhathai dynasty King Luthai's*Trai Phum Phra Ruang, or the Three Worlds of King Ruang*which describes cosmology of Bauddham, classifies people by their karmic merit and narrates traditions of Thai cakravartin (universal ruler)of the first realm; the next realm is Caturmaharajika (rulers of four directions); the third is Tavatimsa, realm of 33 divinities ruled by Indra. Emulating Indra, cakravartin becomes Indra. King Luthai became Mahathammaracha (Mahadharmaraja 1346-1374 CE) due to the righteous rule under dharma and Sukhothai with a Buddha stupa, became Indra's city. cf. Grace Morley, Arputha Rani Sengupta, 2005, God & King, the devaraja cult in south Asian art and architecture, Daya Books; M. Roeske, 1914, L'enfer cambodgien d'après le Trai Phum 'les Trois Mondes',*Journal Asiatique*, novembre-décembre 1914, t. IV, série XI : 587-606):  
  
Avici, Kriminikaya, Vaitarani nadi, Kutsthalmali, Yogmaparvata, Nirucchvasa, Ucchvasa, Dravattrapu, Taptalakshamaya, Asthibhanga, Krakaccheda, Puyapurnahrada, Asrikpurnahrada, Medhoharada, Tikshnyastunda, Angaricaraya, Amvarisa, Kumbhipaka, Talavrksavana, Kshuradharaprvata, Santapana (?), Sucimukha, Kalasutra, Mahapadma, Padma, Sanjivana, (Inscripitons 31 and 32 unreadable),Shita,Sandratamah,Maharaurava, Raurava.  
  
In 921 CE King Jayavarman IV transferred Indresvara, S'iva in Phnom Bakheng to Koh Ker, the short-lived capital. At the summit of the central pyramid,was the*kamrateng jagat ta rajya*'lord of the universe who is royalty'.  
  
That this was no intimation of the King as God or that there was no intent to built up any 'cult' is evident from the following epigraphs of King Yasovarman and King Rajendravarman.  
  
In the final lines of an inscription, he asks his successors to maintain Lolei where the statues of his parents were erected: 'Guard this*dharma*which for me is like a bridge.' In an inscription at Pr Rup, King Rajendravarman proclaims: 'They claim correctly that supplication is the death of kings, as it has for a goal the fulfilment of their wishes. But what I proffer, out of a passion for*dharma*, and having only the well-being of this*dharma*in mind, is that this supplication is for the immortality one should try to achieve.' (loc.cit. Coedes, opcit., p. 27). In these inscriptions, dharma refers to 'sacred establishment', 'eternal law', 'religious practice' and also 'rajadharma' (or royal responsibility to protect dharma) - a responsibility which has to be perpetuated. The 'bridge' referred to by King Yasovarmaqn is a continuum which links the ancestors remembered in statues and the descendants who have to carry on this sacred responsibility of protecting*dharma*.  
  
[Two brothers, Po Khun Bangklanghao and Po Khun Phameung (Po Khun was a Siamese title of high nobility) took Sukhothai from Mon hands in 1239. Bangklanghao ruled Sukhothai as Sri Inthraditaya – and began the Phra Ruang Dynasty - he expanded his primordial kingdom to the bordering cities. At the end of his reign in 1257, the Sukhothai kingdom covered the entire Upper Chao Phraya valley.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhothai_Kingdom)

(After Fig. 17 Fork in the road which leads to either the Heavens or the Hells in: Vittorio Roveda, 2008,*Sacred Angkor - the carved reliefs of Angkor Wat, River Books, Weatherhill, Inc., CT, USA)*)One inscription on this bas relief engraved between parasols of figures ascending the 'middle path' (that is, the middle register)reads: 'These, the two higher (ways), are the route to the heavens (svargga).

The panel includes a narrrative portraying divinity (wearing conical caps) carried on palanquins on the high path to Svargga. (After Fig. 18, Vittorio Roveda opcit.)  
  
In the Bhagavata Purana tradition describing the process of creation, both Rama and Krsna are recognized as avatara-s. Avatara is a sacred place, a tirtha. It is the descent of divinity upon earth to enable people to cross the continuum of life-and-death, to attain mokSa, reach svarga, Vrah Vishnuloka.) अवतार \[p= 99,1\] \[L=17339\] m. ( Pa1n2. 3-3 , 120) descent (especially of a deity from heaven) , appearance of any deity upon earth (but more particularly the incarnations of विष्णु in ten principal forms , viz. the fish tortoise , boar , man lion , dwarf , the two रामs , कृष्ण , बुद्ध , and कल्कि MBh. xii , 12941 seqq.) In Pancaratra tradition related to temple construction and worship, there are 39 Vyuha (including the ten Avatara), detailed in this monograph.  
  
The central theme of Angkor Wat mandiram is the Samudra manthanam (Churning of the Ocean) which is a narrative of creation cosmology in the Hindu dharma-Bauddha dhamma traditions.
