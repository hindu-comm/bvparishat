Dear Prof D.D.Misra,



Thanks for responding to my inquiry about the birth date of Bhagwan Buddha from you article. As a researcher I am open minded to research of other interested persons. I have discussions with them on this list. In addition I immediately get the books or references suggested by scholars like Prof. Narang, Prof. R. N. Iyengar, read them and raise the questions again. We need cross references to accept such important date as birth date of Buddha. I feel this issue must have been settled long ago because religion of Buddha had impact on larger area of Asia.



As far as the writings of Sir William Jones and of other western scholars, it is directly or indirectly admitted in the book of Dr. Trautmann (I wrote about this before on BVparishat) the convoluted motive of these scholars. So it is not necessary to waste our time in blaming them. We have to do our own research irrespective of outcome. We should not be tied ourselves to a particular view point especially based on our language or religion or political situatios. In short we have to desensitize this issue.The whole USA is the country of the migrants and they contribute to the progress of the country. Whether we are original residents of India or migrants has nothing to do with progress of the current India. As far as saving Sanskrit, only one reason is enough. It is heritage of India and current languages are related to her. If we find other applications, well and good. Thanks.N .R.Joshi.

*Respected Scholars,*

*I am grateful to Shri N.R.Joshi for having commented on my article on Puranic Chronology whether he agreese with my opnion or not; because I have found that those who disagree generally prefer to ignore such articles and keep on repeating about the birth of Lord Buddha in 567 BC. *
