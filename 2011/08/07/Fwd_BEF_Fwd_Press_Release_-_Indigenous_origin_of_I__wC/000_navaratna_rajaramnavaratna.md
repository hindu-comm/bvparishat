**Subject:** Press Release - Indigenous origin of Indian civilization gains currency at scholar's meet



Dear Media colleagues,



Attached please find press summary of a very critical symposium on the origin of Indian civilization. Origin of Indian civilization has remained a contentious scholarship since colonial era. As India’s economic fortune rise, and as Indian diaspora grows, civilizational issues are becoming subject of relevant discussion from grade school textbooks to college courses, and of course media descriptions. The symposium on the Origin of Indian Civilization held at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth focused on technical and scholarly advances. More details are available at <http://www.umassd.edu/indic/originsofcivilization/>.



I hope you will be able give your due consideration in publicizing the outcome of this event.



Best regards,



Bal Ram
