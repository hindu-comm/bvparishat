Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Ethymology of word “Naaga” and Naaga worship in Hindu-religion



\(1\) August 4, 2011, was the day of Naaga panchamI-ShraavaNa shuddha panchamI. Similarly Maargasheersha Shukla panchami is celebrated in Maharashtra (I do not know about other states of India) as Naaga-Dive. Here Divaa means lamp. On this day a lamp of sweet (such as Petha, Barfi, Gulab jamun etc) is made for each family member of the house. Some families draw pictures of Naaga sarpa (Cobra) family on the wall-Cobra parents and two children. What is the significance of this custom and how wide spread is the custom in the rest of India?

\(2\) Recently Dr. Kalyanraman is posting many informative articles on this list. One of them was about Southeast-Asian countries and contact of India with them of the known history. In this respect I would like to add that the name of the country LAOS is actually Naaga-Devo.

\(3\) Mahabharat king Parikshit forcibly married Naaga (or Sarpa) king Vaasuki’s daughter Niwal Dai who went second time to bring nectar from the well located in the kingdom of Parikshit. She needed nectar (Amrita) to cure her father Vaasuki from leprosy. Vaasuki initially agreed to give her to Parikshit. (More details can be obtained from the book of O.P.Bharadwaj). We all know Parikshit was killed by Cobra (Takshak) bite. This incident was followed by Sarpa-satra of Janamejaya, the son of Parikshat. Where exactly was located kingdom of Vaasuki in the ancient time -I do not know. Indra was protecting Takshaka. References to Naaga people in the ancient India are plenty like Kaaliyaa Naaga from Yamunaa river.

\(4\) The word Naaga has multiple meanings-Cobra, elephant, a peg projecting from a wall, and many more. The name Naaga-Ahvaya was also the ancient name of Hastinapur, the capital of Parikshit. So could anybody please help me on the etymology of the word “Naaga”?

\(5\) In India there is deity by the name Ananta-Naaga-NaaraayaNa. Prof, Korada has given us meaning of the word “NaaraayaNa” around July 4, 2011 on this list. Now the question is-does that meaning work in the context of Ananta Naaga NaaraayaNa, Agni NaaraayaNa, Soorya NaaraayaNa and Vis’Nu NaaraayaNa? In the last example could NaaraayaNa mean coils of cobra Shes’a under Vis’Nu? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
