Had He not lived beyond 30, it is impossible to write bhashya at the age of 32. Then the reference from Aryavidya Sudhakara -  
*ashtavarshe chaturvedi  
dvaadase sarvasAstravit /  
shodase krtavAn bhAshyam  
dvAtrimse munirabhyagAt //  
*is in question. According to G.N.Kaviraj, the portion on 'Keralotpatti' in Brahmanda Purana (as referred to me by Dr.Narayanan) gives Sankara an age of 38 years.Quite strange. Ref: 'Life and Thought of Sankaracharya', G.C.Pande, MLBD, 2004 p.98
