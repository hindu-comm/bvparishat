Sanatsujata is another name for sage Sanat, and Sanat is a name of Brahman-the Hiranayagarbha too. It is heard to be the Sanatsujatiya of Sanatsujata is appended to the Mahabharata, and it is to be clarified, as the work covers the Vedanta doctrines. There are printed books available of the Sanatsujatiya with Shaankarabhashya. The term shaankara denotes that which belongs any Shankara. Aadi Sankarabhagavatpaada by his age of 32 has produced the Brahmasutrabhashya, 10 major Upanishadbhashyas, Bhagavdgitabhashya, Vishnusahasranamabhashya, Prapancasaratantra and the Sanatsujatiyabhashaya as well. I felt the language of the Brahmasutrabhashya is a bit of tougher than the Upanishadbhashyas or the Bhagavdgitabhashya. People in the name of modernity compel to confuse any author or commentator if they fail to get a direct indication of the composers of works. Modern people usually think in this way : How can Vyasa be capable of composing more than one lakh verses in his life period; whereas the eminent people like us fail to compose even a single verse!!! There is no remedy for such types of thoughts. Then comes to the argument that these works belongs to Aadishankara, such and such works belongs to Madhyashankara or by any of the Shanakaras other than the Aadi and Madhya. Such people do not take spirit and message of those monumental works; where the objective of such works is not to be meant to expose the self qualifications. In the case of Shankaracharya, his aim is to covey the Vedantic ideology to many a number of generations. He hardly expected any M.Phil, Ph.D, D.Lit, or Mahamahopadhyaya by his age of 32, might not have demanded any copyright to his works, rather than to establish the advaita theory for generations. The trend called modernity is to composes something, put the name in block letters and subside the title of work as they deserved to be and earn some sort of degrees and awards. If you have profound scholarship is apparent through such Vedantic doctrines in different styles and idiom of writing why should you bother about the identity card of any ancient author, unless they provide their identity along with their works.
