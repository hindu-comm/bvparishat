While I was searching for a ebook of Dhvanyaloka, I came across these amazing compilations on Archive.org -



1\. The Kavyamala series of Nirnay Sagar with 95 works on Alankara Sastra and some kavyas: <http://www.archive.org/details/Kavya_Mala_Series_Of_Nirnaya_Sagar_Press>. The user who has uploaded these books maintains a blog (mainly a collection of ebooks) at <http://sanskritebooks.wordpress.com/>but has no given personal details. तस्य तपो वर्धताम्।



2\. The Kavyamala anthology series containing 14 gucchas and 129 poetical works. This was uploaded by Dr. Dhaval Patel, whose blog has this description: "I’m a Doctor by degree and a Government servant by profession. I am serving in one of India’s most elitist Indian administrative service. I am an officer of 2008 batch of IAS. I completed my MBBS from Ahmedabad and was doing my MD (radiology) before getting selected to the service. My EmailId: – [drdhav...@gmail.com]( "My Email ID")"



3\. I have not yet checked this out, but he has a collection of unicode texts in Sanskrit across a wide variety of genres listed here <http://sanskritworld.in/unicode-sanskrit-books/>. This corpusis a veritable gold mine for researchers trying to describe the features of language, their evolution over time etc.



I am taking the liberty to include Dr. Dhaval's email ID in the 'cc' fieldand hereby thank him.



Dr. Dhaval Patel: You have built an amazing collection. Congratulations and best wishes in your endeavours.
