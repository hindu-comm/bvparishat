Dr. kulakarni,

Congratulations for organizing workshop on such an important topic. I request you to kindly put the gist of all papers on bvparishat list, so that such scholars are also able to derive benefit, who are not able to attend it. I have read the paper of Rick Briggs on sanskrit and computers and am very much interested to read your paper.Regards,

Rajkumari trikha
