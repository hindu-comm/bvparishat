There is an interestingarticle on the history of the Dollar in The Economic Times today (<http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/forex/how-dollar-was-almost-issued-by-india-once/articleshow/9593534.cms>).



According to it, "The story starts in 1519, when a European nobleman, the Count of Schlick, started making coins from a silver mine he owned in a place called St Joachimsthal, now called Jachymov, in the Czech Republic. St Joachimsthal coins, which stood out for their large size and good quality, were called Joachimsthalers, shortened to thalers or dollars. They became so popular that others started making similar coins."



'sthal' is the root in Joachimsthal, so the etymology of dollar is: sthal--> thaler--> dollar.
