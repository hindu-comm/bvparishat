A key note.

  

The literary meaning of a word "in one language" may not be the same in another language, though the word is borrowed. The word suggested by us means literally the same as the English word as used in Kannada, who are familiar with the English word. But in the case of Sanskrit, it may not have the same literary meaning and may not mean the same as monotony unless one knows it is a translated word for monotony. In the second case, the translation is not at all needed as the reader knows already the meaning of monotony. If he doesn't know that it is a translation of monotony or one who doesn't know the meaning of monotony, I doubt it hardly would mean the same.

  

I can had given several examples for this.

  

The same with the English word monotony.

  

The adjective form of the same word is used in English as a mathematical term:

The synonym in English is humdrum. how about translating this word? दुन्दुभिः ?
