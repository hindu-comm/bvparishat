Anyhow, thanks for one more suggestion.

  

Again, Monotony is a word belonging to the category of पङ्कज etc. where it can be interpreted as born of mud as well as lotus. In the English word too, Monotony is the lacking interest or boring due to monotone (of the speaker/user of the words). So also, वैरस्य would convey lack of interest, uninteresting only without the cause of monotone (not necessarily the musical reverse of ArohaNa and avarohaNa in Indian music). Strictly speaking, रस has got a wide range of meaning varying in degrees. So mutual transplantation would not be doing any justice to both the languages. For academic purposes, the translation would be enough if it conveys the meaning to the one familiar with the target language(without the knowledge of the host language or little knowledge). That is the success of the translation. Not whether it strictly follows or conveys the same idea as in the host language.
