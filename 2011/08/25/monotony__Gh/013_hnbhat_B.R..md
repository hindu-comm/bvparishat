punaruktidoShaH - tautology - useless repetition. is not the same as monotony.

  

What about चर्वितचर्वणा?

  

Literal translations would amount to translating as translating पङ्कज
as born in mud,, or कुशल with grass-cutter. The literal translation of चर्वितचर्वणा - would be chewing the same or as given by MW:

  

" chewing the chewed "' , tedious reiteration BhP. vii , 5 , 30 P‚². 3-1 , 15 Siddh..

  

But it does not convey the idea of monotony literally.
