Can you please provide the Sanskrit Dictionary entry for the word you have suggested? I can't understand the word at all.  
  
The below is the entry I got for the word jāmi in the DCS:  
  
a female relative of the head of a family (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
a sister (?) (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
a virtuous woman (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
name of a goddess (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))  
the daughter-in-law (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988))
