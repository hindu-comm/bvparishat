I don't add any more to this thread than the popular meaning of monotony in English Langauge:  
  
oun 1. monotony - the quality of wearisome constancy, routine, and lack of variety; "he had never grown accustomed to the monotony of his work"; "he was sick of the humdrum of his fellow prisoners"; "he hated the sameness of the food the college served"  
  
IV Acharya is almost near the meaning in English. एकतानता, or so may be properly convey the meaning. But technical terms as एकश्रुति, or ऐकस्वर्यम्, or lengthy commentaries may not help to convey the meaning of the word "monotony" is used in English Language. Even if a literally equivalent term is used, it will certainly fail to convey the popular meaning of a word in another language. As in the case of many words in Sanskrit, like धर्म, karma एत्च्. The same holds good with English words too.  
  
With regards
