Respected scholars,  
  
Pranams. I can't express my gratitude to you all for spending your precious time on the question posed by me.  
  
Thank you all.  
  
I got my answer, but as Respected Sadasivamurthy ji has urged I should come to the field now.  
  
The problem raised when I was going through "suicide", a famous short story by Maupassant. I got the word monotony (meaning tedious sameness). I wandered about a synonym in sanskrit for monotony in vain. Hence, I posed my question to Parisat. I got overwhelming response.  
  
I never thought about the sameness of sound as the meaning of monotony. But it was a good approach. However, it was not the meaning the author tried to convey.  
  
Now, I think, monotony is not जामिता. Because monotony is not mere पौनरुक्त्यम्. It has an adjective tedious and practically monotony creates boredom and depression. So, what should be the exact synonym?  
  
Finally, I came to a conclusion that we don't have a word applied in our literature conveying the same meaning (I tremble to utter this. I didn't go through the entire literature.). But I remember at least one such context where this word may have been appeared - क्षणे क्षणे यन्नवतामुपैति तदेव रूपं रमणीयतायाः. The poet here does not say about monotony but he wants to say (as I think) when the *monotonous* sight of something does not make somebody sink to boredom........  
  
So, Avadhaani Ganesh ji and Prof, Bhat have suggested एकतानता for the word monotony (meaning tedious sameness) may be appropriate, or seems to be so. I think it is not even चर्वितचर्वणम्, because the word does not mean an action but a state of something. Hence, an adjective or प्रकारः. For instance, we can't say "समानं खाद्यं चर्वितचर्वणं जनयति" for "same food creates monotony".  
  
We may use एकश्रुति etc. when monotony means sameness of tone or sound.  
  
Thank you all again.
