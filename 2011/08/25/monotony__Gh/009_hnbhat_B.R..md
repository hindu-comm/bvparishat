Literally it would convey the meaning of ekadhvani in English, but I doubt whether Ekadhvani would convey the literary meaning of the English monotony (which I doubt whether it is used literally to mean "ekadhvani" we have been so far elaborating in the earlier postings. Nor the reverse also. It is never used in the literary meaning of the English word : boring, repeated in Sanskrit usage of the words. Nor monotone would convey the well-defined technical meaning of Vedic accentuation system or grammatical intonation "एक्श्रिति चासम्बुद्धौ". Even the word एकतानता would tend to convey technical meaning as in the Yogasutra:

  

तत्र*प्रत्ययैकतानता*ध्यानम् \|\|2\|\|.



The same with ऐकस्वर्यम् popular in the Vedic accentuation system.

  

Those familiar with both the language and its habits, are welcome to offer their opinion in this respect. In fact, it is a problem of Translation too (from one language to another).
