It is nice to read the Near Eastern Antiquities.

  

The Proto-Elamite tablets (Euphrates and Tigris river-shore civilization, Persia/Iraq) are accounting documents are interesting.

But the antiquity pointed up to 4th millennium B.C is not matching 2700 B.C.

  

We need concrete proof on the carbon dating results as well. It will be helpful if Kalyanaraman can provide some links on such scientific proof etc.  

  

It is important to read that there are three different numerical systems are used on the tablet: a decimal system, a sexagesimal system and a mixed system used in Babylonia mathematical system in ancient Mesopotamia.

  

It might be a fore-runner system of pictography before the scripts and symbols were in regular practice.

  

"The various operations are listed on the front side of the tablet, recapitulated, with totals, on the back at the top. " This deserves to point out to the antiquities of Asian geometrics.  

  

"New figures appear: crescent-shaped notches and dots circled with a constellation of tiny points, some of which represent fractions."

  

"A pictographical sign resembling a fringed triangle, known as the "hairy triangle," often appears, but its meaning remains unclear. "

  

Are they be the first signs of development of scripts and algebraic symbols??? The effort of Kalyanaraman is to be appreciated to bring such things into the attention of BVP readers.  

  

"A single seal was used on the document, a cylinder-seal that was rolled twice across the width of the tablet, covering most of the back of the tablet."  

The scene shows a bull symmetrically restraining two seated felines, alternating with a lion dominating two rearing bulls, each topped with a "hairy triangle."  

  

"The choice of bulls and lions was deliberate, for these animals appear to personify cosmic forces, decisive in the balance of power in the world."  

  

"In the scene, there is no durable winner or loser, but alternating, opposing forces that appear equal."

  

"The animals stand on their hindlegs as if they were bipeds, a technique characteristic of the Proto-Elamite period in which animals were often depicted in a human pose. " This statements reminds the verse of Varahamihira :

  

मत्स्यौ घटी नृमिथुनं सगदं सवीणं चापी नरोश्वजघनो मकरो मृगास्यः।  

तौलिः ससस्यदहना प्लवगा च कन्या शेषाः स्वनामसदृशाः स्वचराश्च सर्वे।।
