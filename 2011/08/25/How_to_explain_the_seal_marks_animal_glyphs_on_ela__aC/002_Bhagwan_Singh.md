Generally I get confused on any claim to decipherment of the Indus seals. But I appreciate S.K.for his comments and presentation of the glyphs on Elamite seals. They must be understood in geophysical context. Who could have depicted them and how do they affect our chronology? Those affraid of a revision of the old notions must statrt using theirown brains. Sarasvati Civilization ``not the Indus explains the mystery.
