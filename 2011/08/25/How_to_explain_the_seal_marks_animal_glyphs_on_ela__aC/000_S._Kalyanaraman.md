### How to explain the seal marks, animal glyphs on elamite tablets?

The following elamite (?) tablets are discussed:

The 'animal' glyphs on numero-script writing has been explained as a possible reference to persons.  
  
In a brilliant article in SMEA 47 (2005), p. 81-134 on Animal husbandry in Susa during the proto-elamite period (attached;[mirror](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/document-preview.aspx?doc_id=91899450)), Jacob Dahl refers to a 'crocodile' glyph as a reference to a person  
  
What is the possible interpretation of a 'croodile' glyph? I am not suggesting a link with Indus writing, but a parallel interpretation of such glyphs like crocodile, bull, boar, tiger as references to artisan-smiths emerging into the bronze age.  
  
I have one comment about 'non-objects' in the list of proto-elamite signs (App. B). While signs M336, M335, M334 and variants may relate to animal husbandry, it appears that the unique sign M340 \[crocodile (lizard?)\] relates to metallurgy.  
  
In my Indus Script Cipher, comparable glyph (+variants) refers to karaa 'crocodile' (Telugu, Tamil); rebus: khara 'smith' (Kashmiri) of Indian linguistic area (Meluhha, Mleccha).  
  
I think it may not be unreasonable to hypothesise some contacts with Meluhha as this remarkable writing system evolved in Elam.  
  
I do not know if elamite tablets have any accounting related to evolving bronze age products.

Description

In about 3300 B.C. writing was invented in Mesopotamia, perhaps in the city of Uruk, where the earliest inscribed clay tablets have been found in abundance. This was not an isolated development but occurred during a period of profound transformations in politics, economy, and representational art. During the Uruk period of the fourth millennium B.C., the first Mesopotamian cities were settled, the first kings were crowned, and a range of goods—from ceramic vessels to textiles—were mass-produced in state workshops. Early writing was used primarily as a means of recording and storing economic information, but from the beginnings a significant component of the written tradition consisted of lists of words and names that scribes needed to know in order to keep their accounts. Signs were drawn with a reed stylus on pillow-shaped tablets, most of which were only a few inches wide. The stylus left small marks in the clay which we call cuneiform, or wedge-shaped, writing.

This tablet most likely documents grain distributed by a large temple, although the absence of verbs in early texts make them difficult to interpret with certainty. The seal impression depicts a male figure guiding two dogs on a leash and hunting or herding boars in a marsh environment.

Proto-elamite tablet with seal mark

A large tablet

This tablet is the largest from the Proto-Elamite period, corresponding to the earliest urban development in the late 4th millennium BC, in the Fars region (southwestern Iran), the present regional capital of which is Shiraz. It bears traces of three different types of administrative tools: writing, accounting and glyptics, a major art form of the period, corresponding to the use of seals. There are inscriptions of both writing and numeral signs on both sides of the tablet.

The emergence of a new writing system in the Fars region

Writing emerged in Iran nearly three centuries after being invented in southern Mesopotamia. This writing system, developed in the Fars region and called Proto-Elamite for this reason, is totally independent from the writing in use at Uruk. As no bilingual text exists that would enable us to establish an equivalence between the two systems, Proto-Elamite writing remains undecipherable. However, the reading direction (right to left) and its horizontality have been detected.

An accounting document sealed with images of animals in human poses

These Proto-Elamite tablets are accounting documents. Three different numerical systems are used on the tablet: a decimal system, a sexagesimal system and a mixed system known as SE. The various operations are listed on the front side of the tablet, recapitulated, with totals, on the back at the top. New figures appear: crescent-shaped notches and dots circled with a constellation of tiny points, some of which represent fractions. A pictographical sign resembling a fringed triangle, known as the "hairy triangle," often appears, but its meaning remains unclear. A single seal was used on the document, a cylinder-seal that was rolled twice across the width of the tablet, covering most of the back of the tablet. The scene shows a bull symmetrically restraining two seated felines, alternating with a lion dominating two rearing bulls, each topped with a "hairy triangle." The animals stand on their hindlegs as if they were bipeds, a technique characteristic of the Proto-Elamite period in which animals were often depicted in a human pose. The choice of bulls and lions was deliberate, for these animals appear to personify cosmic forces, decisive in the balance of power in the world. In the scene, there is no durable winner or loser, but alternating, opposing forces that appear equal.
