Respected Scholars, Namaskar!





Rigvedic all-inclusiveness





N. Kazanas,

**

**Dr. Kalyanraman posted recently on bvparishat, the paper of Dr. N. Kazanas. I thank Dr. Kalayanraman for giving us paper with maps in it. I could not post any maps in my articles here on Mahabharat. Please see the maps in the paper of Dr. N. Kazanas. Find out where Tocharian is shown. They were outside of the subcontinent. They are described in Mahabharat. I wrote about them in my article on connection of Mahabharat to outside countries. This paper has many interesting features in it. See the maps and think what they are telling you.More later on.Thanks. N.R.Joshi
