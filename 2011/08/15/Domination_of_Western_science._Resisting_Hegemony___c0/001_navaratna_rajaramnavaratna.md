 As a probabilist myself I am not prepared to accept that probability originated in India though I am willing to consider it as a hypothesis. Permutations and combinations and the Pascal triangle were certainly known to medieval Indian mathematicians but there is no suggestion of it in Vedic texts or the Mahabharata.



 Nonetheless Dr. Raju must be complimented for opening up an interesting line of inquiry and debate. Also, I don't subscribe to the idea of Western hegemony in science, especially mathematics. Today Indians dominate several fields like software, and even probability and statistics. Pretty soon, Indian linguistics that is emrging through a combination of **Paninian linguistics and computational linguistics** will leave IE and other 'soft' linguistics in the dust. These things come and go and are part of the historical ebb and tide.



 I am amused by Witzel's fixation on horse and chariots! He can't even count the ribs on a horse but wants to hold forth on probability theory and science!
