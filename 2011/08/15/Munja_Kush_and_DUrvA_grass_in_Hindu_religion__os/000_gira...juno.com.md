Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Significance of Munja grass, Kusha (Darbha)grass and DUrvA grass in Hindu religion



August 13 was ShrAvaNa PorNimA-ShrAvaNI day. A girdle of Munja grass is made for a Brahmin boy in his Upanayan ceremony. Pavitrakas (rings) of Kush grass are used in religious ceremony. And DUrvA is usedin worship of Shri Ganesha. There are many competent Vaidika scholars on this list. Could anybody kindly explain to us reason and significance of use of these in Hindu religion please? How old are these customs? Does Munja grass has any connection to Munjavata mountain from northwest region of the subcontinent? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
