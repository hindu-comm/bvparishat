Thanks to Prof. Narang, Prof. S.Korada for contributing to my inquiry about holy grass-Munja, Kushetc. I suggest Dr. Yadu Moharir to contribute to this thread from the medical uses of these plants. Many times we use certain plants in our religious life without knowing their utility other than their auspiciousness. Kushaagra Buddhi perhaps means intellect as sharp as tip of Kush grass.
