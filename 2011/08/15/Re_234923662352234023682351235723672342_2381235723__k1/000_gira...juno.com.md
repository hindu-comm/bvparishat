Respected Shri Kalyaniraman ji:

Namaste.

The official website of ‘The Buddhist Heritage of Pakistan - Art of Gandhara’ at Asia Society in its introduction says the following:



***Introduction***

***The first textual mention of historical Gandhara, the region that lies in the northwest of Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan, was in the ninth century BCE.** Over the next nine hundred years the region was conquered by Alexander the Great, the Indian Mauryan dynasty, the Parthians, the Indo-Greeks, and finally the Central Asian Kushan Empire. This complex history, with its many cultural influences, formed the foundation for a region where Buddhism and Buddhist art would flourish and develop unique characteristic***

**I am just wondering if some knowledgeable Historian can point out that the reference to Gandhara is much older than ninth century BCE, since it occurs in Mahabharat. ( Gandhari and Shakuni).**

**You may be able to write an appropriate letter sighting other relevant references.**

****
