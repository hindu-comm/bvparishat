Respected scholars,

It is appreciable for a great extent that we have a scanned pdf version the Srirudrabhashya by Srimadabhinavasankara on the Srirudropanishad, and the credit deserved by Srimallalitalalita and Shri. V. Subrahmanian. This is to express my gratitude and I liked the Upodghata very much. With esteem respect I would like to quote the third verse which attracted me a lot:

  

भसितकवचितानां बद्धरुद्राक्षदाम्ना-

ममृतकिरणमौलेरङ्घ्रिमूले स्थितानाम्।

प्रतिदिनशतरुद्रप्रश्नशुद्धाशयाना-

ममरपतिनुतानामस्मि दासानुदासः।।

The humility of the author is expressed through the verse which is a moto of the real Indian learning tradition, which is propagated by habitual routines well established within oneself supported by ethics and morality, where there is no place for temporary gains. I sincerely salute the author.



Regards,  
Narayanan
