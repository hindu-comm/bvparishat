Thanks Dr. Kalyanraman for this post on RAMAyaNa conference in Dallas. I will try attend it.



RAmAyaNa-Ancient history

RAmAyaNa extends from India to South America in the eastern direction and Mahabharata extends from India to Europe in the western direction.



There was discussion to produce 100 PhD on history of RAmAyaNa.Good proposal!

My understanding of RAmAyaNa is different. Along with kingdom of RAvaNa there were lands of AhiRAvaNa and MahiRAvaNa. There is ancient history of NAga-mAyA and Kara-mAyA. spread over pacific ocean. There was land of Yakkha-Kuber-half brother of RAvaNa. I wrote on BVparishat about it. American Indians knew one divine monkey by the name HanumAna. This is from the book " Aryan Mexican Linguistics" published in USA long ago. However because the stigma to the word "Arya" created after World War II in the western world, scholars from Mexico are reluctant to discuss this issue. I tried to engage them in conversation but no use. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
