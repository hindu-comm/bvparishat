Dear Dr. Bhagwan Singh,



Susa-Sukha nagari?



Thanks for your reply. I am not doing anything overtly or covertly. I am reading the books on the ancient history of the Middle-east. What shall I do if I find Mahabharata provinces such as Kaamboja,Vaahlika, Madra in north Afghanistan? Do you have alternate explanation? If yes, please provide us with your information. Indians can name Middle-east cities as they want (British called Sindhu Indus). I assume that Susa you referred to was the city of Elam (If I am wrong, please correct me). It was the first capital of Darius. He then built Persepolis in the province of Fars. (This is known history). If you have ancient Indian names for Elam, Fars, Sumer, Babylonia, Bactria, Parthia, Hyrcania, please let us know, so that I can correct myself.I am always open for new information.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
