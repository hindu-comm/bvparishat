Ipersonallattach much weight toquerries raised and interventions made by NRJ. But I have my reservations when he extends overtly or covertlyIndian boundaries to accommodate the places and people known to the author of Mahabharat. MB knows of Susa that is Sukha nagari, but does that mean Indian border extended up to Sussa, despite the fact that India had contact with that city?
