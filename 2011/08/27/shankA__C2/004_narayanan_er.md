Respected Sir,

It was an exact translation of "I thought that you might have come yesterday" what Shri Gopikrishnan was expecting. He used आगमिष्यति ( लृट् ) instead of the आगमिष्यत् ( लृङ् ) due to the influence of the colloquial idiom, as a future tense verb form functions for the function of conditional mood which is absent in his local dialect. Normally all people are accustomed to think in their local dialect and make a mindset into other languages. It is right you have said: we need not borrow any idiom from any dialects. Sanskrit is rich in itself. Thank you Sir.  



Regards,  
Narayanan
