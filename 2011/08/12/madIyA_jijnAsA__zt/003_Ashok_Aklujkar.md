K.D. Sethna (\_Ancient India in a New Light\_, 1989, Delhi: Aditya Prakashan, pp. 46-54, 464) puts Varaaha-mihira in the first century B.C. His main argument consists in demonstrating that the ;Saka Era to which V refers is not the one that began in 78 A.D. but an earlier one that began in 551 B.C.

There seem to be several experts of astronomical texts in the membership of this list. I am interested in knowing whether Sethna's argument is defensible or if it can be controverted with sound evidence.

Can one attribute the theory of rotation of the Earth said to have been refuted by V only to Aarya-bha.ta-I? Is there any similarity of wording with Aarya-bha.ta's work in V's refutation?
