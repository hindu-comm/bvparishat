Dear Vinodkumar,  
Aryabhata I the author of Aryabhatiya, is known to be born in 476  
AD. He himself gives this piece of information in his Aryabhatiya as  
shashtyabdaanaam shashtiryadaa vyateetaastrayascha yucaoaadaah/  
tryadhikaa vimsatirabdaastadeha mama janmano' teetaah//  
that is he says, 3600years of KALI had lapsed when he wrote the work.  
moreover, he says then,23 years had lapsed since his birth. That means  
the work was written in the Kali year 3601 And that the author was  
aged 23 years then. Now Kali year 3601 corresponds to Christian year  
499. That gives his year of birth is 476AD.  
Now, Varaahamihira, the author of Panchasiddhaantika, Horasastra etc  
is known to be born on 505 AD. Moreover, in his Panchasiddhantika, he  
ridicules Aryabahta's theory of rotation of the Earth. As I am  
traveling right now, I am unable to quote the text.(refer to my  
article "Misinterpretation of the theory of rotation of the Earth" in  
the S V University oriental journal, for more details))  
Hence Varaahamihira, the author of famous works like  
Panchasiddhaantika, Horasastra etc, is definitely later than  
Aaryabhatiya.
