The entire Southeast Asian Region has all along been a very fertile DharmaksHetra of Sanskrit tradition.As I have known him for more than 45years Dr Karan Singh is an embodiment of Sanskrit.As the Chairman,Central sanskrit Board,he gave the mantra of Sanskrit Divasa on Upaakarma day which has now taken the shape of an international mantra.At least people assemble all over india and quite a few parts of the world that day and try to come and bring others to come closer to Sanslrit.

 Long live Sanskrit! Long live dedicated Sanskrit lovers like Dr Karan Singh!

**Time of India: 'The East has been deeply influenced by India'**  
  
The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) has opened a centre in the South Korean capital Seoul and set up a chair of Sanskrit at the Preah Sihanouk Raja Buddhist University in Cambodia. These initiatives are part of the Indian government's 'Look East' policy. ICCR president Karan Singh talked with Shobhan Saxena about India's growing soft power and need for more engagement with countries in our extended neighbourhood.
