The entire Southeast Asian Region has all along been a very fertile DharmaksHetra of Sanskrit tradition.As I have known him for more than 45years Dr Karan Singh is an embodiment of Sanskrit.As the Chairman,Central sanskrit Board,he gave the mantra of Sanskrit Divasa on Upaakarma day which has now taken the shape of an international mantra.At least people assemble all over india and quite a few parts of the world that day and try to come and bring others to come closer to Sanslrit.

 Long live Sanskrit! Long live dedicated Sanskrit lovers like Dr Karan Singh!

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
