### Decoding 'Rim-of-jar' Indus Script glyph

Decoding inscription on a Mohenjo-daro tablet (m1405) and ‘rim-of-jar’ Indus script glyph  
  
Abstract  
  
This monograph decodes ‘rim-of-jar’ glyph which is the most frequently occurring glyph on Indus script inscriptions. It occurs on over 1395 inscriptions out of over 4000 inscribed objects. It is decoded: kaṇḍ kan-ka, ‘rim-of-jar’; rebus: ‘furnace-scribe’ (Santali).  
  
Glyphs on m1405 tablet inscription: (ox, trough, body-shoulder, rim-of-jar, water-carrier)  
Decoding: Blacksmith, stone-merchant, copper (metal) smelter-scribe (arrow-maker) - ḍangur, pattar, meḍ eraka, kaṇḍ kan-ka kuṭhi

Indus inscription on a Mohenjo-daro tablet (m1405) including ‘rim-of-jar’ glyph as component of a ligatured glyph (Sign 15 Mahadevan)  
  
This tablet is a clear and unambiguous example of the fundamental orthographic style of Indus Script inscriptions that: both signs and pictorial motifs are integral components of the message conveyed by the inscriptions. Attempts at ‘deciphering’ only what is called a ‘sign’ in Parpola or Mahadevan corpuses will result in an incomplete decoding of the complete message of the inscribed object.  
  
It will be demonstrated in this monograph that this inscribed object is decoded as a professional calling card: a blacksmith-precious-stone-merchant with the professional role of copper-miner-smelter-furnace-scribe.  
  
m1405At Pict-97: Person standing at the center points with his right hand at a bison facing a trough, and with his left hand points to the ligatured glyph.  
  
The inscription on the tablet juxtaposes – through the hand gestures of a person - a ‘trough’ gestured with the right hand; a ligatured glyph composed of ‘rim-of-jar’ glyph and ‘water-carrier’ glyph (Sign 15) gestured with the left hand.

Variants (Parpola)  
  
  
  

  

The inscription of this tablet is composed of four glyphs: bison, trough, shoulder (person), ligatured glyph -- Sign 15 (rim-of-jar glyph ligatured to water-carrier glyph).  
  
Each of these four glyphs can be read rebus in mleccha (meluhhan).
