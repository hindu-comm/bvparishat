[Decoding inscription on Indus seal of Mitathal](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/88386389/Decoding-inscription-on-Indus-seal-of-Mitathal)(discovered & reported in 2010)

  
Abstract  
  
The seal belongs to an artisan. Used as a calling card and for sealing on packages, the seal describes the workshop of the artisan.  
  
Provenance of the seal

\[quote\] Abstract  
  
The Indus Civilization settlement of Mitathal, District Bhiwani, Haryana is rapidly being leveled due to agricultural activities. A short surface reconnaissance was conducted during which, among other things, a steatite seal was recovered. A small fragment of that seal was analyzed using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and determined to have been made from raw steatite that most probably originated in the Alwar District of northern Rajasthan. This, along with evidence that rock outcrops near the Haryana/Rajasthan border were being exploited for manufacture of grinding stones, indicates that residents of the site had important trade relationships extending towards the south...  
  
Mitathal is situated on the alluvial plain near a channel between the Chautang and the Yamuna rivers and is in close proximity (25 to 30 km) to the hilly outcrops of Kaliana and Tosham, which are rich in quartzite and metavolcanic rocks respectively. The site is approximately 120 km west-northwest of New Delhi, 10 km northeast of Bhiwani – the headquarters of the district of the same name, and 1.5 km northwest of Mitathal village...  
  
When walking across Mitathal one is struck by the large number of blue-green faience bangle fragments visible on the site’s surface...Ash pits and kilns of considerable size were observed on the northwestern and eastern peripheries of the site. One among these was a feature that is suspected to be a series of faience kilns...Other common surface ﬁnds were non-diagnostic bits of copper and identiﬁable copper-alloy objects such as bangle fragments (Fig. 4)...  
  

The most signiﬁcant ﬁnd by our team was of a broken steatite seal (Fig. 6). It was found on the southern slope of Mound 2 not far from the canal. Suraj Bhan’s excavation report makes note of a seal (Bhan 1975: 82, Fig. 16) collected from the surface of Rakhi Shahpur (Rakhigarhi), but no seal or sealing had previously been reported from Mitathal itself. The seal recovered by our team is rectangular in shape, trapezoidal in section and inscribed on one side. The surviving portion measures 15.50 x 14.51 mm. The section of the top and bottom suggests that it was, when complete, convex backed with a perforated hole through the width. Seals of this type were used at the site of Harappa only during Period 3C (Meadow and Kenoyer 2001: 27) and so we can conﬁdently date this surface ﬁnd to ca. 2100-1900 BC or the later part of what is commonly called the Mature Harappan Phase of the Indus Civilization.  
  
The ﬁrst sign on the face of the seal resembles a vertical eye enclosing a vertical ﬂaring stroke attached with three short oblique strokes. This sign corresponds to the sign no. 354 in Parpola’s “Sign List of Indus Script” (Parpola 1994: 77). The second sign, which corresponds to sign no. 134 in the “Sign List” (Parpola 1994:73), is composed of seven vertical strokes/bars – having four strokes in the ﬁrst row and three in the second. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the ﬁrst sign (Fig. 7) was performed at the Department of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering, IIT, Kanpur and suggested that the seal’s deeply incised characters were created with a sharp-edged metal tool...

The elemental data produced during the analysis of the Mitathal seal are listed in Table 1 in parts per million (ppm). Using canonical distriminant analysis (a multivariate statistical technique that is well-suited to differentiating various raw material sources and assigning a possible provenance to artefacts), the elemental composition of the Mitathal seal was compared to INAA-derived geologic data from 37 steatite sources within and adjacent to the area across which peoples of the Indus Civilization dwelled (Law 2008: Chapter 7). The locations of those 37 sources are noted on Fig. 11. The results of the analysis – displayed as a bivariate plot (Fig. 12) – indicate that the steatite the seal is composed of most closely resembles that from a deposit (Nangalhari-Bairaswas) in the Alwar District of northern Rajasthan, some 150 km south of Mitathal...It was not surprising to ﬁnd that the Mitathal seal is composed of steatite from the Alwar District, as that would have been one of the nearest raw material source areas for people dwelling in Haryana. However, a small percentage of the samples analyzed from Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro also appears to have come from Alwar and other northern Rajasthan sources. What we might be seeing at Mitathal then is a node near the beginning of a steatite trade route through which raw material was transported westward towards those distant cities. Hopefully, large-scale analysis of steatite artefacts from major sites like Rakhigarhi can one day be carried out in order to more effectively evaluate the extent to which raw steatite from northern Rajasthan and other source areas was utilized in the “Eastern Domain.”  
  
...The acquisition of raw material for grinding stones from the Kaliana Hills and steatite from the Alwar region of northern Rajasthan likely put residents of Mitathal in contact with, if only indirectly, peoples of the Ganeshwar-Jodhpur cultural phase. Further evidence for this southern connection may come when the provenance of some of the many copper artefacts recovered from the site is determined. \[unquote\]

The poster analyzing steatite sources is at:<https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/rwlaw/posters/Poster_4s.jpg>  
  
Evaluating the trde networks of Harappa between ca 2600 to 1900 BCE, Randall Law notes: "A total of 2586 grindingstones (whole and fragmentary) from Harappa were compared with the geologic source samples and assigned a regional provenance...(The map presented shows the sources as Kirana Hills on the westbank of Chenab river and Kaliana Hills near Mitathal)...For approximately 1000 years following Harappa’s initial settlement the majority (85%) of grindingstones were brought to the site from the nearest possible sources in the Kirana Hills – 120 km away. A trend toward the acquisition of higher-quality stone from more distant sources (225 to 400 km) slowly began in the proto-urban phase (Period 2) and culminated in the middle of the urban phase (Period 3B) when only 2% of grinding stones used at the site came from the Kirana Hills...The use of Delhi quartzite from the distant Kaliana Hills increased steadily throughout the sequence... Foreign rocks and minerals. With the possible exception of turquoise and lapis lazuli, all rock and minerals varieties at Harappa can be found in Pakistan or northwest India...Harappa's expanding trade networks. The early 4th millennium BCE founders of Harappa were participants in already established long-distance interaction networks through which certin materials like lapis lazuli and marine shell were brought to the Punjab region from sources more than 800 km away. However, the majority of rocks and minerals from site's first two occupational phases reflect an emphasis on the utilization of much closer, albeit still distant, sources. Most large griding stones were acquired in the Kirana Hills, which at 120 km were the closest rock outcrops of any kind. The black chert used by Early Harappans was from the Salt Range - 250 km away. Steatite came from regions 350 to 450 km away - the closest ocurrences in which material that would fire white could be found. All of these sources, as well as those for the lead and alabaster used during periods 1 and 2, were located in regions north of Harappa...By Period 3A, most of the chert at Harappa probably came from the Rohri Hills, 500 km to the southwest. The use of Kirana Hills sources for grindstone steadily diminished and by Period 3B most querns and mullers came from areas farther away to the west (Sulaiman Range - 225 km) and east (Kaliana Hills - 400 km)."

“Mitathal (28-50; 76-10), Dt. Bhiwani, about 10 km to the nw of Bhiwani railway station, with a twin mound…The site was for the first time put on the archaeological map by the discovery of gold Gupta coins in 1915-16. Two copper harpoons, the typical Copper Hoard tools, were accidentally discovered at the site in 1965, one of them now housed in the Arch. Museum at Gurukul, Jhajjar. Subsequently a hoard of 13 copper rings, since lost, was discovered. The true archaeological potential of the site and its Harappa affiliations were first recognized in 1967 when a few potsherd and beads of semiprecious stones, paste and faience were shown to the writer, who conducted excavations here in 1968 on behalf of the Panjab Univ…An unfinished bead and an unworked nodule of agate from the site point to the local manufacture of the beads… The large number of faience bangles with a rich variety of shapes and designs represent the popular ornament…Among toys mention may be made of the terracotta cart wheels, wheeled animals, discs with nail marks and clay balls. A quartzite hammer-stone, saddle querns and pestles, discoid balls, perhaps used as weights, cubical chert and cuboid sandstone weights, chert blades and ring stone comprise the stone artefacts. A bone or ivory stylus or pin, a ring and a square wire of copper and terracotta triangular cakes, discs with tapering sides and sling balls have also been recovered…” (Ghosh, A. 1989, An encyclopaedia of Indian archaeology, Delhi, Munshiram Manoharlal, pp. 289-290).

Glyph1 This is a ligatured glyph comprising: four numeral strokes and three numeral strokes. Each glyph denotes a lexeme and is read rebus.  
gaṇḍa ‘four’ (Santali); rebus: kaṇḍ fire-altar, furnace’ (Santali)  
kolmo ‘three’ (Mu.); kolami ‘smithy, forge’ (Te.)  
Thus, the glyph reads: kolmo gaṇḍa ‘smithy with fire-altar’.

Glyph 2 This is a ligatured glyph comprising: ‘plant’ infixed within a ‘hole’.  
dulo ‘hole’ (N.); rebus: dul ‘to cast metal in a mould’ (Santali)  
kodo ‘millet’ (Mu.); rebus: koḍ ‘artisan’s workshop’ (Kuwi).  
Thus, the glyph reads: dul koḍ ‘casting (metal) workshop.’

Seal m898 (The second sign from the right is a ligature: rice plant is ligatured to three long numerical strokes). One conjecture is that the ‘rice-plant’ glyph is a phonetic determinant of the ‘three numerical strokes’ glyph. If this conjecture is valid, both the glyphs may be connoted by the same lexeme: kolmo, ‘rice plant, three’.
