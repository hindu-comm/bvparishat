वैयाकरणकिराताद् अपशब्दमृगाः क्व यान्ति सन्त्रस्ताः/

ज्योतिर्नट-विट-गायक-भिषगानन-गह्वराणि यदि न स्युः//

vaiyākaraṇakirātād apaśabdamṛgāḥ kva yānti santrastāḥ/

jyotirnaṭa-viṭa-gāyaka-bhiṣagānana-gahvarāṇi yadi na syuḥ//

I think this is the verse you wanted to be translated. I have corrected the  
version you have given to some exten

"Where would the ungrammatical words, (like) the deers frightened by (hunted  
by) the वैयाकरण-s (like) the hunters, take refuge if there were not the  

dense forests of mouth of the astrologer, the actors(\*naṭa)\* \*viṭa\* (go

  
between the hero and heroin in dramatic language), the singers and the  
physicians."

This is translated begging pardons from our Grammarian Scholar members of  
this forum. If any aberration or deviation in the verse can be modified  
accordingly. Just I modified the text he had given from my memory.
