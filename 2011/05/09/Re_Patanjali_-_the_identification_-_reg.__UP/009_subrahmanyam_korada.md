namo vidvadbhyah  
  
Dr Rukmani -- **Patanjalis or Patanjali** ?  
  
**Bhartr.hari - Vakyapadiyam (1-147) --  
  
kAyavAgbuddhivis.ayA ye malA samavasthitA.h I  
cikitsAlaks.an.AdhyAtmas'Astraistes.Am vis'uddhaya.h II  
**  
**NAges'abhat.t.a.h - Laghuman\~jUs.A** - 1- Aptopadess'asya s'abdaprAmAn.yam --  
  
**Apto namAnubhavena vastutattvasya kartsnyena nis'cayavAn , rAgAdivas'Adapi nAnyathAvAdI ya.h sa iti carake patan\~jali.h  
**  
Also refer to the introduction of **CarakasamhitA** for more material .  
  
I simply fail to understand as to how can one draw conclusions by applying present procedures and methods to age old treatises .  
The tradition was different from what it is today .  
Even if we take an author who is alive and did a couple of books hardly will there be any evidence to prove that he is the author of all the books in question .  
  
How to trust that **Panini did JAmbavatIparin.ayam ? How can one say that Panini did As.t.AdhyAyI** ?  
  
First of all we have to bear it in mind that they follow **Yoga -- s'ama, dama , satyam** etc unlike most of today's authors .They do not want patent rights or fanfare . No selfishness .  
  
Most of such **vivAdas** had cropped up due to the History Books written by **Mlecchas and the Indiain followers** .How can a single person do such a difficult and vast treatises - is their doubt .  
  
The unfortunate situation is that one thinks that the other is as good as himself in terms of **intelligence , health , wealth etc.** without going thru the **KarmasiddhAnta .  
**  
**S'an'karAcArya under BrahmasUtra (1-3) - s'AstrayonitvAt - clearly states the greatness of Panini etc. - pAn.inyAdInAmiva jn\~eyaikades'a .....  
**  
Take up the present day statement -- yoga has enhanced my health(physical) . Nowhere is physical health discussed in Yoga and as is well known it is meant for cleansing the mind which may in turn be useful in the improvement of physical health -**.AvicAritaraman.Iyam .**  
  
On the other hand **Ayurveda** discusses both **Manas and S'arIram (Adhis.t.hAnam)** . People follow blindly --  
  
**gatAnugatiko loko na loka.h pAramAthika.h I  
gan'gAsaikatalin'gena [nas.t.am](http://nas.t.am) tAmrabhAjanam II  
**  
What is the proof to say that so and so is the son of a mother/father and vice versa ?  
  
**SAyan.amAdhava** says with continuous wars he did not have time even to perform **SandhyAvandanam** ! Do you trust his words or not ?  
  
Most of the scholars on this list have other skills not known to all others (kavitvam etc).  
If not mistaken for glory - I learned Veda , Amara , S'Astras etc while doing Agriculture (21 years) - both harvesting and rearing the livestock .  
I love to recite Veda with Vedic scholars and discuss S'Astras with fellow scholars . I may do a book on Agriculture .  
  
If **S'ani is there in As.t.amasthAna (from Lagna)** one can have diversified activities and skills in different arts and crafts .  
  
Can anybody prove that there happened a 100 years War between **Britain and France** ?  
  
Iran does not believe in **Hitler's Holocaust** ? And Britain was trying to change its textbooks to suit the same .  
  
What is the context for **Hari to say - kAyavAgbuddhivis.ayA .. ?  
**  
There are three kinds of **Dos.as** (defects) - i.e. related to **VAk , Manas and S'arIram** . In order to obviate the same the same Patan\~jali did three works - **MahAbhAs.yam , YogAnus'Asanam (S'Asanam by Hiran.yagarbha) and CarakasUtram - says avicchinnagurus'is.yaparamparA .**  
  
It is difficult to make a person believe . **VyAsa , the commentator of YogasUtras was altogether a different from PArAs'arya .**
