Dear Rukmani,

I have been gathering material on the Yoga and Vyakara.na relationship consciously since 1971. I read a short paper on this topic in 1972, concentrating on the Yoga-bhaa.sya and the Vaakyapadiiya, along with its V.rtti, at the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society held in Baltimore. Since then I have given a lecture or two on the topic, widened to include other sources, but I have not yet published the results. Apart from other demands on my time, academic and practical, the main reason for the delay is the absence of access to manuscripts of certain Sanskrit texts (these are not edited critically or the text available in the editions needs to be checked in some parts at least against older mss). One of these days I hope to be able to publish a long article or a short monograph on what I have found out. In the meanwhile, you can get some idea of my historical thinking on Pat the grammarian from my three articles in the volume \_Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir\_ (New Delhi: D.K. Printworld) and from the references made to me in the Yoga volume, edited by G.J. Larson and R.S. Bhattacharya of the \_Encyclopaedia of Indian Philosophies\_ (Delhi: Motilal Banarssidas).

Here I will restrict myself to the relatively better supported conclusions I have arrived at in my unpublished material. In stating them I will assume that the chronology given at present for early Indian philosophical works is valid, although I am feeling increasingly doubtful about its validity. At least a good case seems possible for dating \*some\* of the works to a more ancient past.

1\. The tradition of the identity of the three Pat.s (medicine, grammar, Yoga) is very probably much older that the 10th century A.D. It is unlikely to be later than the 3rd or 4th century A.D. in its origin. Bhart.rhari cannot be dated later than 425/450 A.D. as C. Kunhan Raja and others have pointed out long ago. In fact, if the dating of Malla-vaadin in the Jain sources is accepted (as Muni Jambuvijaya does; the dating has been set aside by Erich Frauwallner through an essentially circular argument), BH should be dated minimally about a hundred years earlier).

True, BH does not speak of the identity of three Pat.s in explicit terms, but we also cannot discount the possibility that his commentators preserved old traditional information (see VP 1.147already cited by Dr. Subrahmanyam Korada; the number would be 174 according to Wilhelm Rau's critical edn of the kaarikas). Helaa-raaja (not later than early 10th century A.D.), as available to us in the summary version by Pu.nya-raaja for the second kaa.n.da, presumes a tradition according to which the verse (also) conveyed bhaa.syakaara-pra;sa.msaa, which can be true of Pat only as a contributor to medicine, grammar, Yoga. Secondly, we should note that it would have been sufficient in the immediate context for BH to speak of the vaag.do.sas (and their removal). Yet he refers to kaaya do.sas and buddhi-do.sas (and their removal) as well. Using the triplet kaaya, vaac and buddhi/manas is not unusual, but which among the following two possibilities is more likely, given that BH talks of the \*removal of do.sas\* of kaaya, vaac and buddhi \*in a collective way\* \*with a terminology -- cikitsaa, [lak.sa.na](http://lak.sa.na) and adhyaatma -- that is attested in the MB (cikitsaa is attested through cikitsya) and given the later \*widespread references (references found in all three relevant system traditions) to Pat as a contributor to medicine, grammar, Yoga: (a) his verse is shaped by an awareness of the association of Pat with the systems of medicine, grammar, Yoga or (b) his verse was written with no particular intellectual in mind? Possibility (b) exists, but possibility (a) seems preferable in the current state of our knowledge. Note also my next point which is more objective in nature.

2a. The Yoga-bhaa.sya can be said to give good evidence to the effect that the Yoga-suutra author Pat and the MB author Pat were one and the same person in its (YB's) author's view (for want of time, I cannot get into the extensive discussion, largely text-critical in nature, that this remark may necessitate; let me just assure you that I have supported this thesis through several logically independent arguments).

2b. The YB is usually ascribed to Vyaasa or Veda-vyaasa. Actually it is a work of Vindhya-vaasa (also mentioned as Vindhya-vaasin). The part veda-vyaasena bhaa.site in Vaacaspati-mi;sra's introductory verse to his commentary on the YB is simply a corruption of vindhya-vaasena bhaa.site. An exchange of the places of ya and va somewhere in manuscript transmission has led to someone's (understandable but wrong) correction of vindhya-vaasa to the more familiar veda-vyaasa. Vaadi-deva-suuri cites a part of the YB as coming from Vindhya-vaasa. The views expressed in the YB largely agree with the ones attributed elsewhere to Vindhya-vaasa.

2c. From all available indications, Vindhya-vaasa is older than BH. The identity of Yoga Pat and Vyaakara.na Pat presumed in the YB, therefore, almost certainly predates BH and makes it more likely that the tradition of the identity of three Pat.s reaches back at least into the early 5th or late 4th century A.D.

(I can also demonstrate that the YB is a text that has undergone some wear and tear even before Vaacaspati's time. For this reason, too, it is more likely to be an older text.)

(The view that the YB is influenced by the thinking of certain Buddhist thinkers usually placed in the 4th or 5th century by our historians is neither unavoidable nor sustainable upon scrutiny. The only inference the internal evidence in the YB permits is that the YB author reacted to certain Buddhist views, which could very well be older than the 4th century A.D.)

3\. The tracing of the pattern/tradition to an earlier period makes it more likely but does not prove that the three Pat.s were in fact one individual. If we are good historians, we have to respect the limitation of the available evidence and leave the issue for a defensible solution when new evidence becomes available.

4\. Pat writing in the Vaidyaka tradition need not be thought of as authoring a self-standing work. He could have, like Caraka, carried out only a pratisa.mskaara of an existing text, and this could have been mainly in the area of complementing Vaidyaka with Saa.mkhya-Yoga thinking.

5\. Larson, in the Yoga volume of the EIP mentioned above, proposes that we should differentiate between a Saa.mkhya Pat and Yoga Pat. His reasoning is unconvincing to me.

6\. This post probably suffers from too much summarizing and writing done under the pressure of other work. At present you will have to believe that I have analyzed the relevant textual evidence comprehensively and carefully.

7\. Personally I do not care much about whether I disagree with this great scholar or that great scholar of the past. I respect all of them, but not to the extent of compromising the researcher's dharma that he should let the evidence speak for itself in the best possible manner. If you wish to see an example of how even great and industrious minds miss something crucial and commonsensical under the sway of contemporary historical constructions and intellectual currents, please see my article "Unity of the Miimaa.msaas: how historiography hides history," published in the recently released felicitation volume for Prof. Vacaspati Upadhyaya. The title of the volume is Vacaspati-vaibhavam, and it is published by D.K. Printworld in New Delhi.

With best wishes,

ashok
