Excuse me for responding to this old thread.



It was greatly fulfilling to go through this immensely enlightening thread.



I was just thinking of this possibility:



After ahundred years or more from now, a researcher finds Noam Chomsky's writings on linguistics and politics. He wants to know whether Noam Chomsky the author of linguistics works and Noam Chomsky the writer on politics are the same or different. To accept the two Chomskys to be the same, he demands for internal evidence within the texts on the two fields. People provide all evidences from outside the texts. The researcher insists on internal evidences. People fail to provide. The researcher refuses to agree that the two Chomskys are one and the same person.



How I wish someone interviewed Patanjali with questions such as " How do you manage to handle such diverse fields as Vyakarana, Yoga and Ayurveda?" . Panjali gives answers such as ( like Chomsky's "I don't bring my politics into my class room") " I don't bring into any one of my fields any one or two of the other two fields" .



Is it not necessary for those scholars on this list here who work in diverse fields to ensure internal evidences for their being one and the same person in all their works in different fields, if they want people to know that they are one person writing in different fields? Necessary only if they want . Did Patanjali want?
