Dear Madhav,  
Thank you so much for that brilliant summarization of the material available. So, in other words, while tradition believes in the identity of the two Patanjalis there is no hardcore evidence we have so far. Do send me as an attachment your article on “Who inspired Panini”. In the light of Nagesa’s statement I am wondering why Das Gupta would make such a definitive statement that ‘grammarians’ have not commented on this at all. I hate to think he could be wrong.
