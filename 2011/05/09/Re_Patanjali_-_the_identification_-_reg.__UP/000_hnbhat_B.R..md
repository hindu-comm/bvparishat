Traditionally it is believed that Patanjali, is has written in three different Shastra-s as per the following verse of salutation inBho0ja's Rājamārttanda commentary on the *Yoga Sūtra*s

  

योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां

मलं शरीरस्य च वैद्यकेन.

योपाकरोत् तं प्रवरं मुनीनाम्.

पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोस्मि.

  

yogena cittasya padena vācām \|  
malaṁ śarīrasya ca vaidyakena \|  
yo'pākarot taṁ pravaraṁ munīnām \|  
patañjaliṁ prāñjalirānato'smi \| \|

  

\[I bow to the sage Patanjali, who gave us yoga (Yoga for the purification of mind, grammar for the purification of speech, and medicine for cleansing the body.}

  

Other members may offer some more testimony for the identification or its denial in the light of modern research.

  

With regards
