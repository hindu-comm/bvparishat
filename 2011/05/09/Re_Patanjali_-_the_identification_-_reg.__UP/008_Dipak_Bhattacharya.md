There is copious information in Dr. Kannan's mail for which the correspondent must be thanked. But, barring information 8 and 9, none speak of the identity of the two. For example, the statement "In ***Matsya Purāṇa***, there is a mention of Āṅgirasapatañjali." is perfectly consistent with the fact that by all evidences Patañjali, the grammarian, was a Paippalādin. I shall be thankful for information on the location of this in the M.P. But what has that got to do with the identity? Both Bhoja and Cakrapāṇidatta are much later than Patañjali. Nāgoji Bhaṭṭa is even later. Decisive internal evidence is required to establish the identity.
