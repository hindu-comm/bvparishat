Dear Ashok,  
Thank you very much for taking the trouble to present so many aspects of this question and presenting them in your own inimitable way. You have brought in a richness of material and a critical appraisal of that material to bear upon the question of the identity of the Patanjalis. The way in which you are able to tackle material from so many diverse fields is truly impressive. I will try and acquire the said books in which the relevant articles on Patanjali appear when I am in India this summer.I look forward to your long article/monograph on the topic whenever it is published.  
All the best  
Om  
Rukmini
