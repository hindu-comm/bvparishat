Dear Dr.Kannan,

Thanks for the information about the M.P.  

Just to remove misunderstanding I emphasize did not take side in the debate. My own opinion is that no conclusive evidence is available for the identity or otherwise of the Mahābhāṣyakāra and the Yogasūtrakāra. We cannot say on the basis of definite evidence that they were not one, and not also the otherway round.

I give a few examples of how just the non-mention might not be decisive in determining the date of something. It is by all evidence probable that the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa presupposes the ten-maṇḍala Ṛgveda. But the term for the Ṛgveda as a ‘collection of ten’ namely *Daśatayī* is found later. The Niruktakāra definitely knew the twenty-kāṇḍa Paippalāda-Śaṃhitā but an explicit mention of the twenty kāṇḍas as such is met with first in Patañjali’s Mbh.

In the history of our languages there are examples of how extremely ancient words not attested in Classical Sanskrit surface up in NIA languages. Something might live below the surface and may show its face in congenial environment.

Best wishes

DB
