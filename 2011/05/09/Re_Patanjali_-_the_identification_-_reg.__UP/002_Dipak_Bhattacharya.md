I do not claim myself to be a grammarian. But it seems that it may not be too far fetched to assert that there is nothing to prove the identity of the grammarian and the author of the Yogasūtras. Das Gupta had his own ideas with many such identifications. He thought that the words *brahmasūtrapada* in the Gītā meant Bādarāyaṇa’s Brahmasūtras. But see Deussen on this. Far from Das Gupta’s idea the Gītā was the foundation of later Vedānta including the Brahmasūtras.
