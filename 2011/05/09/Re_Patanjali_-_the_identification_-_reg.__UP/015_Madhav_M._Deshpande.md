Dear Rukmani,  
  
I was away from home for a few days and could not get to this  
interesting discussion. Within the tradition of Sanskrit grammar, as  
far as I know, only Nāgeśa explicitly seems to believe in the identity  
of the two Patañjalis. In his Uddyota he says: seśvarasāṃkhyānāṃ  
ācāryasya patañjaler ity arthaḥ / guṇasamūho dravyam iti patañjalir  
iti yogabhāṣye spaṣṭam (Vol II, p. 294, Vyākaraṇa-Mahābhāṣya, with  
Pradīpa & Uddyota, Motilal Banarsidass, 1967). This notion of  
identity of the two (or three, if we include Caraka-Patañjali  
identity) is implicitly present in Bhartṛhari's Vākyapadīya (1.147)  
that was quoted earlier. Similar statements from Cakrapāṇi etc. are  
probably echoes of Bhartṛhari. There is no hard-core evidence to  
support this identity, but the belief in this identity is strong among  
traditional pandits. Late Pandit Narahari Narayan Bhide, who was one  
my most revered teacher in Pune around 1962, strongly believed that  
Patañjali the grammarian had a yogic understanding of Pāṇini's grammar  
and that is why we should trust him. However, as we were reading  
Patañjali's discussion of taparas tatkālasya, we came across a dual  
interpretation of tapara as both a bahuvrīhi and a tatpuruṣa supported  
by Patañjali, and later continued in works like the Siddhāntakaumudī.  
This discussion in the Mahābhāṣya surprised Pandit Bhide, because, as  
he understood it, Patañjali was not certain about the accentuation of  
the compound tapara. It could not simultaneously be ādyudātta (=  
bahuvrīhi) and antodātta (= tatpuruṣa). This discussion made Pandit  
Bhide rethink his belief in the identity of the grammarian Patañjali  
and the author of the Yogasūtras. You may find some interesting  
discussion of the history of mythologization of various personalities  
in Sanskrit grammar in my 1997 article: "Who Inspired Pāṇini?  
Reconstructing the Hindu and Buddhist Counter-Claims", JAOS, Vol 117,  
No 3, pp. 444-465. If you don't have access to this publication, let  
me know. I can send it to you as an attachment. Best,
