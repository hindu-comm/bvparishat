Dear Rukmani,  
  
Ashok has given lot of food for thought. It seems to me that a  
possible source for the traditional identification of the Patañjali of  
grammar and Patañjali of Yoga may be the Mahābhāṣya use of the  
expression vāg-yoga-vid in the Paspaśāhnika. While the commentaries  
of Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśa do not interpret the term yoga in this  
expression as referring to the yoga of the Yogasūtra, this expression  
may have given rise to a conception that someone like Patañjali was  
both a vāg-vid and yoga-vid. The term vāg-yoga could likely have been  
given an extended meaning in later times. Certainly Bhartṛhari needs  
to be looked at carefully. There are a number of studies of this  
expression and you may find them listed in the following document:
