Dear Sir,

  

You have exactly reflected my thoughts contained in my reply. The meaning of vAg-yoga is clearly explicit in the previous part of the verse,

  

yastu prayumkte*kushalovisheshe*shabdaan yathaavadvyavaharakaaleI so(a)nantamaapnoti phalam paratra vaagyogavid dushyati chaapashabdaih: II'

  

He is speaking of the correct usage and perfect in the usage of the language for all practical purposes and we are entering into all the possible connotations in different shastra-s for vAg+yoga independently or in association. I just thought of it, and you have spelled it out loudly.



It is the "kushala" who is taken up again in the second half, by vAg-yoga-vid. This much is explicit. The highlighted variant for jayam in the verse, too seems to be the the effect of such forward thinking in terms of other shAstra-s.
