I agree with both. Madhav and HN Bhat.The verse talks about, I feel ,a person in general, and says that if he is kushala etc in his use of words he becomes vaagyogavid and victorious, but if he uses apashabdas he is defiled. Vaagyogavid can be thus understood as the epithet, compliment of the kushala person Thus we can avoid the confusion arising by construing Vaagyogavid with dushyati caapashabdaih.Patanjali shows, in his usual style, the possibility of alternative interpretation( or misinterpretation) of the line and plays with the words. If sah is the agent of the sentence with two clauses, namely. jayam aapnoti and dushyati

there is no confusion. This ism my humble attempt to solve the problem.

Dear Vidvā?sa?,

  
  
  This is a fruitful discussion of what I would call the changing  

understanding of terms like vāg-yoga-vid used in the Mahābhā?ya. I am

  
not entirely convinced that the word yoga in this expression  
originally referred to the meditative yoga elaborated in texts like  
the Yogasūtras. It is quite clear that the word yoga in the  

Mahābhā?ya has multiple meanings, the two relevant in this context are  
yoga=sūtra and yoga=prayoga. The expression vāg-yoga-vid in its

  
original context could indeed have any of these different meanings: 1)  
yoga (meditative practice) of vāk, 2) knower of rules of grammar as  
well as of the usage of language, 3) knower of the prayoga of vāk.  
Given that the term could have multiple meanings, the subsequent  
history indicates that some of these meanings get highlighted in  
certain traditions, while others get eclipsed. This complexity of the  

expression vāg-yoga-vid in the Mahābhā?ya is especially evident when

  
we consider that the original citation of the verse containing this  
expression says something that is potentially problematical: vāg-yoga-  

vid du?yati cāpaśabdai?: "the vāg-yoga-vid is defiled by the

  
apaśabdas." This is then contested and finally Patañjali says: a-vāg-  

yoga-vid eva (du?yati cāpaśabdai?). What seems clear is that the

  
citation itself is not Patañjali's own verse, and that there is some  
discomfort with what the verse apparently is saying, and hence  
Patañjali in his own discussion is ultimately negating the wording of  
the verse. It is very likely that the original verse is part of a  
debate that appears elsewhere in the Paspaśāhnika: (apaśabda-)jñāne  

adharma?, athavā prayoge adharma?. Note the word prayoga in this

  
debate which contains the element -yoga. Most likely the word was  
originally used in the context of a grammatically relevant discussion,  
and then later it was interpreted in a wider context. More food for  
thought for all of us. Thanks for this stimulating discussion. Best,

Dear Sir,



You have exactly reflected my thoughts contained in my reply. The meaning of vAg-yoga is clearly explicit in the previous part of the verse,



yastu prayumkte**kushalo******visheshe****shabdaan yathaavadvyavaharakaaleI so(a)nantamaapnoti phalam paratra vaagyogavid dushyati chaapashabdaih: II'



He is speaking of the correct usage and perfect in the usage of the language for all practical purposes and we are entering into all the possible connotations in different shastra-s for vAg+yoga independently or in association. I just thought of it, and you have spelled it out loudly.



It is the "kushala" who is taken up again in the second half, by vAg-yoga-vid. This much is explicit. The highlighted variant for jayam in the verse, too seems to be the the effect of such forward thinking in terms of other shAstra-s.
