Dear Vidvāṃsaḥ,  
  
This is a fruitful discussion of what I would call the changing  
understanding of terms like vāg-yoga-vid used in the Mahābhāṣya. I am  
not entirely convinced that the word yoga in this expression  
originally referred to the meditative yoga elaborated in texts like  
the Yogasūtras. It is quite clear that the word yoga in the  
Mahābhāṣya has multiple meanings, the two relevant in this context are  
yoga=sūtra and yoga=prayoga. The expression vāg-yoga-vid in its  
original context could indeed have any of these different meanings: 1)  
yoga (meditative practice) of vāk, 2) knower of rules of grammar as  
well as of the usage of language, 3) knower of the prayoga of vāk.  
Given that the term could have multiple meanings, the subsequent  
history indicates that some of these meanings get highlighted in  
certain traditions, while others get eclipsed. This complexity of the  
expression vāg-yoga-vid in the Mahābhāṣya is especially evident when  
we consider that the original citation of the verse containing this  
expression says something that is potentially problematical: vāg-yoga-  
vid duṣyati cāpaśabdaiḥ: "the vāg-yoga-vid is defiled by the  
apaśabdas." This is then contested and finally Patañjali says: a-vāg-  
yoga-vid eva (duṣyati cāpaśabdaiḥ). What seems clear is that the  
citation itself is not Patañjali's own verse, and that there is some  
discomfort with what the verse apparently is saying, and hence  
Patañjali in his own discussion is ultimately negating the wording of  
the verse. It is very likely that the original verse is part of a  
debate that appears elsewhere in the Paspaśāhnika: (apaśabda-)jñāne  
adharmaḥ, athavā prayoge adharmaḥ. Note the word prayoga in this  
debate which contains the element -yoga. Most likely the word was  
originally used in the context of a grammatically relevant discussion,  
and then later it was interpreted in a wider context. More food for  
thought for all of us. Thanks for this stimulating discussion. Best,
