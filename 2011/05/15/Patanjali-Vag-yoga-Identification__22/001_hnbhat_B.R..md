Thaniks for a good analysis of the issue.

  

"Vaagyogavid duShyati cApashabdaiH" A debate on this part itself is an example of the overall meaning of the word "vAgyogavid".

  

And if we take vAgyogavid - as vAGmayaM tapas, it goes back to the tradition of literary personages as Bhavabhuti attested

  

RShINAm punar AdyAnAM vAcam artho 'nudhAvati\|

  

This same vAg-yoga, is the initial verse of the Adi-kavi vAlmIki -

  

*तपःस्वाध्याय*निरतंतपस्वी वाग्विदां वरम् ।

नारदं परिपप्रच्छ वाल्मीकिर्मुनिपुङ्गवम् ॥

  

2.1:*Tapah svadhyaya*ishwara pranidhanani kriya yogah



Tapas in the above above two occasions, may or may not include vAGmaya tapas, which is often equated with vAgyoga. In the first it is specifically assigned to Narada, in contrast to vAlmIki, the becoming poet, and the ready poet. Now the question comes to the same position, whether vAgyogavid is equal to vAgvidAm vara or vashyavAk in other terminology.

  

Just added one more aspect of "vAgyoga" already discussed in the previous post. Now, to come to the next common term a "compound"

*तपःस्वाध्याय needs attention in this context. tapas and svAdhyAya are independent parts of kriyAyoga as per the sUtra, as it appears, in the first face.* Now "tapas" again may include vAgyoga = vAGmayaM tapas as one of the components of kriyA-yoga. But in the first, it is commented asतपस्त्वेन श्रुतः स्वाध्यायस्तपःस्वाध्यायः । "तपःस्वाध्याय इति ब्राह्मणम्" इत्यापस्तम्बोक्तेः । by Tilaka. Though other interpretations are equally available.

  

And so the discussion may be carried on with the connotations of the words in Sanskrit in the different fields/registers of the relevant shAstra-s, which follow their own metalanguage and register of their own enabling widely different interpretations for the same words.
