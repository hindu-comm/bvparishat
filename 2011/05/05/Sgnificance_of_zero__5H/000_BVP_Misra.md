ॐ पूर्णमद: पूर्णम इदं ---- ये भी पूर्ण वह भी पूर्ण ---- निराकार भी
पूर्ण साकार भी पूर्ण -----ईशावास्योपनिषद----

***Respected scholars,***



***I am under the impression that the aforesaid Shloka is not from Ishavashyopanishad. It is Shukla Yajurvediya Shanti Mantra. More over many (or may be most) scholars interprete as a definition of infinity. ***



***I do not thing such a definition is correct, because infinity taken out of infinity does not leave infinity; What is left is an inditerminate quantity which may be finite or infinite.***

***In contrast Zero is a complete whole number by itself . 
***पूर्णमद: पूर्णम इदं. ***When zero is taken out of zero, zero is left behind.***

***It is important to bear in mind that modern mathematics (and modern science) would have been impossible without the place value of zero which was originally proposed by the Indians and was known in the west as the arabic numerals (now commonly referred to as the Hindu Arabic number system).***

***To me it appears that th compilers of the Vedas had incorporated this Shanti Mantra to impress the readers that***

***1. Zero is the most significant entity and ***

***2. Every thing arose out of nothing (not even vacuum) ***

***According to modern science the unverse was created from a point (which is referred to as "singularity") which came out of nothing.***

***With regards,***

***Yours truly,***
