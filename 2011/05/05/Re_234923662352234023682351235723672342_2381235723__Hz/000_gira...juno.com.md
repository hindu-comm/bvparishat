Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Mahabharat again-This time Shalva and his floating city from Mahabharata!



Dear Dr, Bhagwan Singh,



I agree with you. Dr. Kalyanraman has made tremendous contribution to set the ancient Indian culture and history in proper perspective. I saw the video he posted(see below). I also agree with Mr. Crimo (Author of forbidden archeology) in his observation that efforts were madeby imperial rulers to suppress the discovery of ancient artifacts from all over the world including India to bring the ancient history of the world in the line with their own scriptures.



Having said this, I now come to the main topic. The video describes the attackby floating city (Saubha or Saubhaga nagar) of king of Shalvas on the ancient city Dwaraka of ShreeKrishna. In the book of Savitri Saxena, " Geographical Survey of the Puranas-pages 111 to 113) there is some informationon Shalva. It is said there that Shalva's kingdom was also known as Martikavata. This book says Saubhanagar was its capital. It does not say anything about it being a floating city. Panini mentions their territory as including Audumvara, Tilakhala, Machakara, Yugandhara, Bhulinga and Shara-danda. The name of Yugandhara makes me uneasy. Yugandhara was also the city of Shaakala Dvipa-kingdom of Shalya along with Madra and Vahlika. These are high cheek bone people like Maadri. We exactly do not know the extent in the north of the people of Uttara Kurus. Their fair color certainly takes them further in the north of Afghanistan.



Let us assume that Shalvas were within the subcontinent in the ancient time. Question arises-how come they had floating city and Krishna or Pandavas did not have it? The video shows that Krishna was using his bows and arrows to repel the city away from Dwaraka. I request scholars of this list to throw some more light on this episode from Mahabharat if possible. Thanking you, I remain, sincerely yours N.R.Joshi.
