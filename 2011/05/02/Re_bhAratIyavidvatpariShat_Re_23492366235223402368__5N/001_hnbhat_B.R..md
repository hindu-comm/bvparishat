Dear Sir,

  

In the citation you have quoted, it is obviously explicit that it means with lalATa only the lipi - the writing on the forehead and not alone.

  

ayaM daridro bhaviteti nUnaM lipiM lalATe arthijanasya jAgratIm

  

The writing on the forehead of the beggars that "this man will be for ever be a poor" which is a religious concept that BrahmA writes on the forehead of every human being, the five things before he is born:

  

पञ्चैतानि विलिख्यन्ते गर्भस्थस्यैव देहिनः ।  
आयुः कर्म च विद्या च वित्तं निधनमेव च ॥

  

Many have versified the concept. BhartRuhari himself has stated it as unavoidable what is written on forehead.

  

यद् धात्रा निजभालपट्टलिखितं स्तोकं महद् वा धनं

तत् प्राप्नोति मरुस्थले ऽपि नितरां मेरौ ततो नाधिकम्।

  

One will get only that much wealth as written on ones forehead by the Brahma, wether it be little or great even if he be in a desert or Meru (the golden mountain) and not more than that. (by dwelling either in desert he won't get less nor on Meru the golden mountain, not any more than that).

  

In other words, it is not inherent in the word "lipi" alone but its association with forehead the meaning writing on forehead. In our place, a stylo and palm-leaf is kept on the side of the head of new born baby, on a certain day (that is expected Brahma to write his future on his head) as I had seen in younger days.  
  

Submitted with all humility,

  

With regards
