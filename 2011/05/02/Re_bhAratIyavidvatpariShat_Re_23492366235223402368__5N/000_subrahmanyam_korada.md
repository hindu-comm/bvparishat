Prof Joshi the following may be interesting --  
  
Lipi means the writing on the forehead (i.e. wrinkles ) -  
  
If the hand (handwriting ) is not clear in Telugu we call it '**brahmarAta**' ( Creator's hand) . 'Naseeb' 'fate' etc also means the same .  
  
Here is **S'rIhars.a(1-15, Nais.adham) --**  
  
**ayam daridro bhaviteti vaidhasIm  
lipim lalAte'rthijanasya jAgratIm I  
mr.s.A na cakre'lpitakalpapAdapa.h  
pran.Iya dAridryadaridratAm nala.h II  
**  
on the beggar's (**jAtyekavacanam**) forehead Brahma wrote - this person will suffer from 'poverty' , Nala , as a philanthropist , brought poverty to poverty and made Brahmalipi meaningful .  
  
**Gan.es'a** was writing **MahAbhArata while VedavyAsa was dictating .  
**  
I believe that both **'lipi' and 'anka'** , blossomed simultaneously . Right from birth one requires Language as well as Mathematics .  
  
Lipikara(rI) deals with both script and accounts . One may get more information in **Arthas'Astram** .  
  
**LaghumanjUs.A (Varn.asphot.avicAra.h) -- vyAkaran.adbhedena sthAninAm bhede'pi na ks.ati.h , lipInAm bheda iveti dik .  
**  
**Likha** --  
**Ayurvede ( tongue cleaner to be used ) -- jihvAm s'anai.h s'anai.h likhet (VAgbhat.a ? ) . Lepanam etc.  
**  
Also see **'likhyaroga' etc in S'usr'uta** .  
  
**'harin.Api haren.Api brahman.Api surairapi I  
lalAt.alikhitA rekhA parimArs.t.um na s'akyate II'
