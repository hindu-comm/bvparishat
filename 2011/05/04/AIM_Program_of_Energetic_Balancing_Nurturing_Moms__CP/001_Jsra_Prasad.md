Dear Sir,  
Thanks for letting me blissfully recollect a wonderful piece from Smriti -  
उपाध्यायान् दशाचार्यः आचार्याणां शतं पिता ।  
शतं च पितृन्माता गौरवेणातिरिच्यते ।। (म.स्मृ. १४५)  
Sravana Kumara had carried his parents on his shoulders until his last breath.  
Vainateya fought with Indra while procuring ambrosia to release his beloved  
mother from the clutches of slavery. Respecting 'mother's' wish, Sriramachandra  
went in exile. Sri Sankara come back to perform the last rites to his mother, even  
after becoming a sannyasin.  
  
The values embedded in these incidents, are inherent in our culture.  
'कुपुत्रो जायेत क्वचिदपि कुमाता न भवति'. A seminar paper is attached herwith.  
  
Yours sincerely
