**Dear Scholars,  
Good intentions need to be appreciated.  
Mother's Day is well intended, though  
we need to look at from our cultural background  
so that we can provide deeper insights and content  
to the modern context which has necessitated such  
a day.**  
**Looking forward to insightful posts/responses,  
With regards,  
Dr.Sharma.  
मातृदेवो भव is not limited to such "Day".  
**  
  
**QUOTE  
  
Don't forget that this Sunday, May 8th, is Mother's Day! The role a mother plays in a child's life is a very important one. Please give deserving recognition to your mom or other mothering nurturer from your childhood.
