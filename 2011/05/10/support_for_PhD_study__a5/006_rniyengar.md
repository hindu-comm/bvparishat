Dear Sri Kumar,  
I am curious to know what you have found so far about numbers in  
VyaakaraNa books. From your post I learn except for 2 and 6 you have  
information about others. Can you please share this with us? I wonder  
how grammar alone can help in understanding origin and development of  
number system. There are of course large number of books about  
"history of numbers" both within India and abroad. Perhaps you have  
already gone through these books at least by Google searching.  
Personally I find Naiyyaayikas have devoted more space in their books  
to discussion on (sankhyaatva) numbers. Ingalls in his book "Materials  
for the study of Navyanyaaya logic" covers interesting aspects of  
'Indian number theory' with modern western theories. My suggestion is  
don't limit your study to only 'vyaakaraNa books.' Start from the  
Rigveda,... Vedanga Jyotisha, sulba sutra..etc. I have put the  
question to several scholars why the number eight is represented as  
"[as.t.au](http://as.t.au)" in dual number and waiting for a satisfying answer. May be  
you can help me to understand this usage.  
  
All the best  
  
R N Iyengar
