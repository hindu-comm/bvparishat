The etiquette on discussion lists is that an inquirer tells the list members what bibliographic leads he or she has already collected. Then the others make additions. On most respected lists, the inquirer also posts, after the inquiry has been pursued for a reasonable time, a consolidated list of all the bibliographic resources on a particular topic that are brought to his or her attention. This is done for the benefit of the other list members, particularly as an act of gratitude toward those members who spent their time to help the inquirer and to facilitate advance in the research area concerned.

Let me also take this opportunity to note once again that messages expressing personal feelings in reaction to a news in the academic or scholarly world (typically, congratulations, condolences or commiserations) are usually sent off-list personally to the intended recipient.

Reproducing earlier messages in their entirety is also avoided. Only the relevant part is quoted.
