Andअष्टाभ्य औश्

does not prescribe aush to the feminine gender form of the numeral अष्टन्.

  

Only numerals fromएक - चतुर् take suffixes to agreee with the nouns genders in three genders. Others from विंशति etc. have their genders too fixed and forms too differ in cardinal and ordinal places.

  

I think Iyengar already know this fact and just raised the question with some perspective in his thought.
