through this Phd subject "Sanskrit numerals: a grammatical study" we  
are trying to give the grammatical structure of number system of  
Sanskrit. in Sanskrit each numbers has the special meaning and  
structure,so we are trying to research this number system of our old  
tradition.through this, we are trying to cover the history, origin &  
development and scientific structure of each number of Sanskrit. we  
have collected some materials from different vyakaarna texts like  
सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, काशिका etc and also from other Sanskrit texts. as  
best as possible we searched a lot to get the specific subject book,  
till time we have not get any related book which gives the detail of  
our number system. in our research we have not get the details of 2  
and 6 (द्वि,षट्)in any texts. any help related to this subject will be  
grateful.  
thanking You  
  
with regards
