As a part of the UGC project on 'Studies on Scientific Thoughts and Components in Vedic Literature', the School of Vedic Studies of Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, tried to focus, at least, to some extent, on numerals found in the corpus of Vedic literaturewhere some interesting points came to light. Unfortunatelyresearching in this directioncould not becontinued but I believe, a lot can bedone if a focussed attention relating to itsmany aspectsmay be given.



With regards,



Soma Basu
