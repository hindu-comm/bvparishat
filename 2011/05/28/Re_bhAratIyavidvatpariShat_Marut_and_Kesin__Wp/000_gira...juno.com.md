Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Thank you Prof. Narang for sharing your information with us.



MarutgaNa, BhadragaNa and Avagana (PART I)



We have noticed on this list different scholars interpret meanings of ancient Sanskrit words and names differently. One would like to interpret from spiritual point of view while other may interpret from the natural phenomenon. We noticed this recently in connection with the word “Marut (\*meteorite)” and Keshin (Comet). Meanings also differ in different context.

In the ancient history of the land, now called Afghanistan, one comes across names like BhadragaNa, Avagana, MarutgaNa etc. Bhadra-desh, now called Baluchistan was the country of the ancient BhadragaNa kshatriyas. The text of Brihat-samhitaa of Varahamihira refers to the group of people named Avagana along with Huns and Chinese. There were people in ancient Afghanistan known as Paaraavatagana (Pancavimsha Braahman). Paaraavataas are mentioned in Rigveda. Extending the same logic, it looks like MarutgaNa might be the name of the group of people from Afghanistan. On the other hand Afghanistan was famous from the very ancient time for her wind swept region. So Marut as wind also makes sense here. Maruts are also Rigvedic deities. However Maruts are to be identified with the winds that blow in Afghanistan from June to September. These are aptly called baad-i-sad-o-bist (Shat vimshati vaataah). These seasonal winds make roaring sound. Hence they are stated in Rigveda to be singing songs and singers of heaven. They are urged in Rigveda to cross over the rivers of Afghanistan-Rasaa, Kruma,Anitabhaa,Kubhaa(Kabul). Afghanistan was famous for windmills in ancient days. Powerful cyclonic storms develop suddenly in Afghanistan. In stage one it looks like a moving well upward (Apaam Napaat). In stage two, lower part becomes narrow and looks like a goat with one foot (Aja Ekapaad). In the final stage, lower part becomes slender with upper part spread over looking like a hooded serpent in heaven (Ahirbudhnya). The very dry swirling winds produce electric charges in air due to friction (the phenomenon of Autoelectricity well known in Afghanistan). Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Perhaps, once Saivism and Vaisnavism had been inseparable. The evidence is the Visnusuukta of the RV where a number of epithets of Visnu (e.g. girikSite) apply to later Siva. Similarly the songs of Marut and Rudra may have relation to the songs in Krishna cult. Kesins was also an independent sect which had relation to Jainism as the Jain scholars think. They were not separate and had a relation to drinking of poison. It may have a relation to Vaikhanasas ( \>\*ViSaashnasas). in the RV viSamapibat kunannamaa needs the interpretation in the light of the hypothesis above. I have not checked Arbman: Rudra ( I saw it long back) which may give important clues. Regards, spnarang

Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Maruts are described as comets by prof. R.N.Iyengar in earlier postings. Now I found in Rigved 10th mandala, (RV X.136) there is word 'Keshin" and its is described as comets by Dr. Achar. I think Nirukta says Kesha means rays (rashmi). MarutgaNa are also described as deities. and also RudragaNa. Maruts are also described as winds. Moreover the one who makes you cry is called Rudra (from root Rud-to cry). Is this correct? It is also understood that Shankara is the leader of Rudras. What is the relationship among Shiva of Shaaktas (from pair-Shiva-Shakti)and Shankara among Rudras? Are they same or different? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
