Respected Dr. S. Ramakrishna Sharma Sir,  
piyali palit has requested the file, so i had uploaded the file. but i  
feel this is not the actual place to upload this type of files. we are  
getting so many websites for the same purpose. we have to maintain  
bvparishat as a discussion forum in subjective way. i expect  
bvparishat management will accept my comment..

thanking You

With regards

krishnakumar
