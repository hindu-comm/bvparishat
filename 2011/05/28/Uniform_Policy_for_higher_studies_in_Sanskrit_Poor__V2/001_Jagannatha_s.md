Respected Pro. Piyali Palit,

Thank you very much for uploading the document. The rules and regulations framed by J.U.University are simply superb. Particularly, I am very much impressed by these two paragraphs:

21. i) The Supervisor under whom a registered candidate shall

have to work shall be a teacher of this University holding a

Doctorate degree or possessing adequate research

experience ***as evidenced by publications ***

27. (iv) If the examiners are not satisfied, the candidate may be

directed to appear again at the viva-voce examination after

six months.

Now, I request Dr. Varakhediji to include these two points while framing the norms of Ph.D:-

1\. Regarding the practical problems of research in manuscripts/editing the works according to Manuscriptological discipline.

2\. Regarding change of the title of the thesis.

S.Jagannatha.
