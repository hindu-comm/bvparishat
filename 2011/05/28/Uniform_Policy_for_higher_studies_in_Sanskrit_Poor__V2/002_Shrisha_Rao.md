\> Respected Pro. Piyali Palit,

\> Thank you very much for uploading the document. The rules and regulations framed by J.U.University are simply superb.

My apologies to you and to Professor Palit, but I must courteously but firmly disagree -- that document leaves much to be desired, and it would be the exception rather than the rule that someone getting a Ph.D. according to the policies described therein would be considered a high-class researcher or academic. A main concern of whoever wrote that document seems to be that all appropriate fees must be paid on time, as if there were hordes of doctoral students who would otherwise take their degrees and run away without paying their fees! There is little explicit concern for scholarly merit, so either that document was drafted by clerks rather than scholars, or perhaps the Peter Principle is at work.

My main complaint (other than the fee obsession) about that document is that it does not require a doctoral student to pass any type of comprehensive examination (merely saying that "examiners at the oral examination may ask questions beyond the subject of the thesis" during the final thesis defense is not sufficient, and in fact such an examination should happen before the thesis is written, and not when it is being defended). In general, a student is required, by better institutions, to possess some maturity in a "core body of knowledge" in the subject, and some additional in-depth understanding of the particular research area. Thus, for example, it would not do for a Ph.D. student in history to say, "I have written an excellent dissertation dealing with the reign of Louis XIV, but know nothing about Chinese history or Indian history" -- I am sure many of us have served on various selection committees and such where we have not taken kindly to candidates with such myopic visions! A student writing such a dissertation should know something about the histories of other countries, and should also have some in-depth understanding of French history which is the immediate context of the dissertation. Good institutions or departments define a suitable core body of knowledge and ask the student to undertake sufficient studies to cover it. For instance, many mathematics departments require a student to study some advanced algebra, set theory, analysis, differential equations, geometry, etc., though obviously not all these are actually going to figure in the student's own research. In addition, a student must pick one or more of these broad areas which is the context of research, and pass an additional, in-depth examination (which may be oral or written, or both). Some physics departments in India and elsewhere have an interesting practice in this regard -- they require a student to pick one of the volumes of "The Feynman Lectures on Physics" and pass an in-depth oral examination on the same. This "Feynman exam" is seen as a challenging and important hurdle by students, and perhaps indicates why the study of physics in India, which goes back to the traditions of stalwarts like C.V. Raman and H.J. Bhabha, still has value, unlike in many other disciplines.

Thus, rather than requiring that a Sanskrit student take just four courses at will (of which one is a wasted "research methodology" course) and scratch through with 50% in each, every such student must possess some basic mastery of a core body of Sanskrit knowledge. Perhaps such a core body could cover some four-five classical areas like व्याकरण, काव्य, etc., and additionally a student should pass a comprehensive examination in the major area of work; for instance a student wishing to write a thesis on Advaita Vedanta should, in consultation with the advisor, pick a text like the अद्वैतसिद्धि or the विवेकचूडामणि for study, and later pass a comprehensive oral/written examination conducted by a panel of experts, covering all of it. As is common practice with comprehensive examinations, a department may invite a learned scholar (or more than one) from elsewhere to examine the student, if necessary.

Just a couple of other comments: it is quite inappropriate for the department chairman to be on every Ph.D. student's committee, and a student should also be permitted to switch advisors.

Here are a couple of links with descriptions of high-quality doctoral programs; their ideas may be used, mutatis mutandis, to design better Sanskrit programs as well.
