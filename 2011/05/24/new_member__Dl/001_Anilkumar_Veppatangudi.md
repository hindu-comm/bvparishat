Here is a translation from AV Samhita edited by K.L.Joshi based on translation by W.D.Whitney & Bhashya of Sayanacharya,Parimala Publications, Delhi:

By whom were brought the two heels of man, by whom was his flesh put together? By whom his two ankle joints, by whom his cunning fingers? By whom his apertures? By whom his two uchlakhas in the midst? Who put together his footing?
