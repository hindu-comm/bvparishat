Perhaps, once Saivism and Vaisnavism had been inseparable. The evidence is the Visnusuukta of the RV where a number of epithets of Visnu (e.g. girikSite) apply to later Siva. Similarly the songs of Marut and Rudra may have relation to the songs in Krishna cult. Kesins was also an independent sect which had relation to Jainism as the Jain scholars think. They were not separate and had a relation to drinking of poison. It may have a relation to Vaikhanasas ( \>\*ViSaashnasas). in the RV viSamapibat kunannamaa needs the interpretation in the light of the hypothesis above. I have not checked Arbman: Rudra ( I saw it long back) which may give important clues. Regards, spnarang

Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Maruts are described as comets by prof. R.N.Iyengar in earlier postings. Now I found in Rigved 10th mandala, (RV X.136) there is word 'Keshin" and its is described as comets by Dr. Achar. I think Nirukta says Kesha means rays (rashmi). MarutgaNa are also described as deities. and also RudragaNa. Maruts are also described as winds. Moreover the one who makes you cry is called Rudra (from root Rud-to cry). Is this correct? It is also understood that Shankara is the leader of Rudras. What is the relationship among Shiva of Shaaktas (from pair-Shiva-Shakti)and Shankara among Rudras? Are they same or different? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
