Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Maruts are described as comets by prof. R.N.Iyengar in earlier postings. Now I found in Rigved 10th mandala, (RV X.136) there is word 'Keshin" and its is described as comets by Dr. Achar. I think Nirukta says Kesha means rays (rashmi). MarutgaNa are also described as deities. and also RudragaNa. Maruts are also described as winds. Moreover the one who makes you cry is called Rudra (from root Rud-to cry). Is this correct? It is also understood that Shankara is the leader of Rudras. What is the relationship among Shiva of Shaaktas (from pair-Shiva-Shakti)and Shankara among Rudras? Are they same or different? Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
