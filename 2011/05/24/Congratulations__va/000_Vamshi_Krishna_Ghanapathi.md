Dear Sri Krishna Sastryji!

  

This is to congratulate the efforts of the team in Delhi. As evident, major policy decision related jobs have to be concentrated and coordinated in Delhi only.

  

And your last sentence is truly relevant and should inspire all the academics.

  

उद्यमेन हि सिद्ध्यन्ति कार्याणि न मनोरथैः।

(न हि सुप्तस्य सिंहस्य प्रविशन्ति मुखे मृगाः।।)

  

It may be appropriate for many of us to use the above line,purport of your statement, as a tag line for some time to come.

  

Hoping to extend our bit of participation, for the great work of the Delhi Team, I remain.

  

Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi

With Warm Regards
