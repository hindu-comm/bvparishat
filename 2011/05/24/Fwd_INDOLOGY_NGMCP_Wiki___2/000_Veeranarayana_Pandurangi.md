Dear Members of the list,  
  
The NGMCP (Nepalese-German Manuscript \_Cataloguing\_ Project) has been testing a wiki server for some months. Primary purpose of this wiki is to publish manuscript catalogue data created by the NGMCP.  
  
The address of the server is <http://134.100.72.204/wiki/>  
  
It incorporates the information from the online title list <http://134.100.72.204:3000/>  
  
We are hoping that the scholarly community finds some use of this catalogue wiki. We plan to keep adding new catalogue data, at the same time improving existing ones. This wiki will be the primary source of information the NGMCP gathers. Please keep coming back or subscribe to the RSS feed of Recent Changes.  
  
Anonymous editing and user creation are currently disabled. There is still a possibility to create users capable of editing. Please drop me (Harimoto) a line if interested.  
  
With best wishes,

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
