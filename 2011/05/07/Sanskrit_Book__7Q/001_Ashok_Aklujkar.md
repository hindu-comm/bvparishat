As far as I know, this is not a new book for teaching Skt but a simpler, short grammar in English that high school students may find useful. Prof. Sitaram Datar (\<[sbd...@gmail.com]()\>) is a retired college lecturer. (Incidentally, he has done several excellent translations from Marathi into Skt.) As of last January, I got the impression that the book was on its way to publication. I have not been informed that it has actually been published.
