Dear Scholars,

  

I vaguely recall someone talking about a new book for teaching Sanskrit perhaps by some Prof Datar (?). It was supposed to be still in making. Can somebody give back the information and the email of the concerned professor once again? I tried searching the BVP website online, but failed to find the details. I would highly appreciate any details offered in this case. With my best wishes.

  

Yours sincerely,

  

Mrinal Kaul
