Thanks for sharing the information. Hope it works. It may perhaps discourage the appointments of "Chamchas" who occupy chairs for longer time as seen in Delhi. The system of education is getting corrupted day by day and the so called "LIFAFA" culture is rampant. Let us hope that it will lead us to the process of selection of deserving candidates/persons and not to the process of 'elimination'.

  

Regards.
