Dear Prof. Pandurangi,

  

We are glad to know that you are going to bring out a manual on research methodology and manuscriptology from Indian point of view. Tantrayukti as we find in the Arthashastra, Ayurveda, Nyaya, etc. is a marvellous concept so far as methodology of writing a text or treating a subject is concerned. Regarding manuscriptology I can refer to a learned article entitled 'Manuscriptology from Indian Sources' by late lamented Prof. Anantalal Thakur, published in the Journal of the Ganganatha Jha Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Vol. XLIII, January-December 1987    
( reprinted in Aspects of Manuscriptology, ed. Ratna Basu and Karunasindhu Das, The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, 2005 rpt. 2009).

Looking forward to your successful completion of the work and with best regards,

  

Yours sincerely,

  

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
