dear all,

thanks to recent debates on scripts and editing methods, I request esteemed members of this parishad to help me to bring out a manual on शोधप्रविधि and मातृकाविज्ञान. there are many books on this topic. but we want a book in Samskrita and more updated one. most important thing is that it should incorporate veiw points of our Indian tradition.
what we read in books available is mostly drawn from experience of latin and greek editing methods. these methods are used by most of editors for the whole last century. but still many researchers used some traditional methods. experience of such edtions should be brought to front and it should be developed fully.

I invite learned members to help us identy scholars and methods to make it a full book.
