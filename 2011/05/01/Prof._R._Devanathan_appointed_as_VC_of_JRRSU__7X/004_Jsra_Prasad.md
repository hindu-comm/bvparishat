Sir, thanks for the information.  
Its very heartening to know that the post has been occupied by a very dynamic scholar like Prof.Devanathan ji. Way back to 1997 in Vidyapeetha, when we research scholars started a coaching program for PPST students, he rendered his full help to teach the nuances of Vyakarana along with other teachers. After the concrete foundation laid down and made as a center for learning by Prof.K.V.R.K. sir, JRRSU may see new vistas and grow by leaps and bounds under the leadership of Devanathacharya ji. May I humbly convey the hearty congratulations.  
  
With Regards
