A Workshop on 'Sanskrit Computational Linguistics'  
  
We are glad to announce a workshop on "Sanskrit Computational Linguistics"  
being organised jointly by the Vyakarana Vibhag, Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan samkay, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and the Sanskrit Consortium.  
  
Dates: 12th July - 15th July 2011  
  
Venue: BHU, Varanasi  
  
Organisers: Vyakarana Vibhag, Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan samkay, BHU,Varanasi  
 and  
 Sanskrit Consortium, funded by DIT, Govt of India.  
  
  
Aim of the Workshop:  
----------------------------  
In the past three years, various tools for the analysis of Sanskrit language have been developed by the Sanskrit Consortium. These tools facilitate a person with moderate background in Sanskrit to understand any Sanskrit text with better comprehensibility.  
  
Aim of this workshop is two fold.  
a) To introduce the young students of Sanskrit to the field of Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, and  
b) To discuss the problems in the development of such tools with the Sanskrit scholars.  
  
In this workshop, we introduce to the participants following tools that have been developed by the Consortium.  
i) Sandhi  
ii) Morphological Analyser and Generator  
iii) Sandhi Splitter  
iv) Sanskrit-Hindi Machine Translation System cum reader  
v) Parser for Sanskrit (based on the aakaankshaa pra.naalii)  
vi) POS tagger for Sanskrit  
  
Each of the tool is introduced describing the four aspects:  
i) Necessity to build such a tool  
ii) The linguistic/vyaakarana background associated with the phenomenon under consideration  
iii) Data Annotation and Computational Implementation  
iv) Demonstration of the tools  
In addition to this, there will be one session dedicated for discussions on issues in computer implementation of various linguistics facts/phenomenon.  
  
It is assumed that the participants have good knowledge of vyaakarana and  
are competant enough to analyse the Sanskrit sentences at various level of analysis such as morphology, parsing, POS etc.  
  
Eligibility: Any Sanskrit Teacher or a Sanskrit Research scholar or a Post  
Graduate Student of Sanskrit with good Vyaakarana Background  
  
Number of Participants: Only limited number of seats are available to outside candidates.  
  
Lodging and boarding will be provided in the University Guest House.  
  
Please send your requests in the prescribed format (see below) by email to  
[mohan.ku...@gmail.com]() by 15th May, 2011.  
  
Since the seats are limited, you are requested to write a brief note on your  
purpose to attend this workshop and how you think you will be benefited.  
The participants will be informed about the selection by 25th May 2011.  
  
Sincerely,
