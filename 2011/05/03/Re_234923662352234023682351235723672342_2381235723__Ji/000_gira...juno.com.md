Dear Prof Korada, Thanks for giving details of "The limbs represented by 12 places of the horoscope ". Your knowledge in this subject is very deep. The subject of Paapa, PuNya, Grahashaanti, etc is very heavy to discuss. Some members of this list may add their experiences from their own life or life of others they know. Many of us certainly derive from your posting some insight into connection-Vedant-Jyotis'a-Aayurveda. Thanks again. N.R.Joshi.

Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Multiple questions on Ayurveda (Re: {भारतीयविद्व त्परिषत्} The 'abhushana' of women)  
Date: Wed, 20 Apr 2011 23:03:38 +0530  
  
namo vidvadbhyah  
  
Prof Joshi --  
VedAnta , Jyotis.am and Ayurveda are interconnected - do Ayurvedic Doctors see horoscopes of patients?- Is it common practice ? What they look for in horoscope ? Is Jyotis.am and VedAnta are part of  
Ayurvedic doctor's curriculum ?  
  
Yes , I very well remember the statement made long ago .  
  
The order of **VedAnta - Jyotis.am - Ayurveda is important .  
**  
**KAlidAsa** in **UttarakAlAmr.tam (KAlAmr.tam** of the same author is about **Dharmas'Astr**a) says the following which is an answer to - what does the planetary line up in the horoscope suggest ? --  
  
**pun.yam vApyatha pAparUpamapi vA karmArjitam prAgbhave ..  
**  
whatever **'pun.yam'** (although it is there in thier culture there is no word in English ) and **'pApam**' (sin) is committed during the earlier incarnations ( it is seen in the form of planets , which suggest comfort and grief to the native, i.e. the horoscopee) .  
  
**VedAnta** says - **Brahman** has taken the form of 'universe' thru the capacity of **'MAyA**' in order to see that the beings would face the **Karma** (nemesis) , both good and bad .  
  
It also says - one should face **Karma -- avas'yam anubhoktavyam kr.tam karma s'ubhAs'ubham .  
**  
Then what about **Grahas'Anti - - Japa - Homa - Tarpan.a , etc. prescribed in Upanis.at and Jyotis.agranthas ?**  
It is for **S'Anti and not for NivAran.A** - so that the degree of intensity may be reduced or the patient would get the stamina to sustain .  
  
Any literature that talks about transfer of PApa thru DAnas etc is an **ArthavAda .  
**  
But how to know as to when the **Pun.yaphalam** or the **PApaphalam** will take effect ? And preferably , if it is **PApaphalam** in what form will it effect , i.e. is it in the form of an accident or disease ..?  
  
It is **Jyotis.am** that nswers this question -  
  
take the natal details of the native and prepare the horoscope - the **S'ubhagrahas represent the Pun.yaphala and the PApagrahas the Papaphala .**  
  
The sixth place from ascendant **(Lagnam**) talks of three aspects - **S'atru , Roga and R.na .**  
  
Depending on the lord of the sixth place ,his companion (if any) , the planet that aspects him - we have to predict as to what kind of disease or health problem the native may encounter .  
  
**Guru stands for Kapha(Phlegm) , S'ani - VAta (Gout) , Budha - Pittam(Bile) etc.  
  
S'ukra - blood related , Kuja - bones , joints , Surgical Operation , cuts , burnings , accidents , shocks etc.  
**  
The limbs represented by 12 places of the horoscope --  
  
Lagnam - Body and S'iras  
dvitIya - speech , eyes , face  
tr.tIya - throat , ears , taste  
caturtha - sukham  
pancamam - stomach  
s.as.t.ham - roga , Apada , pId.A  
saptamam - sexual matters  
as.t.amam - mUtrapurIs.advAra  
navamam - bhAgyam  
das'amam - livelyhood  
ekAdas'am - AdAya  
dvAdas'am - dehakArs'yam  
  
Diferent positions , permutations and combinations of planets would suggest different diseases and there is a lot of literature in **Jyotis.agranthas** .  
  
Now the Doctor can (has to ) refer to the horoscope of the patient and with the knowledge of Jyotis.am , can arrive at a conclusion as to where the problem is.So that diagnosis may become easier .  
  
As most of us are aware , the Ayuredic Doctors (most of them) do not know this aspect . So the question of referring to horoscopes does not arise . Much less in their curriculum .  
  
But it was there long long ago - referring to **Jyotis.am - BasavarAjIyam (24 Adhikaran.am) offers quotations from Jyotis.am under Karmavipaka - tacchamanopAya.h --  
**  
**candraks.etre yadA bhaumo jAyate manujastadA I  
raktapittena durnAmno nAnAvyAdhisamAkula.h II (Jyotis's'Astra)  
**  
The person born when **Kuja is in Candra's house** would suffer from **Raktapitta , Ars'as etc .diseases .  
**  
**nIcasthitabhAnudss'A jvaradr.n'nAs'A s'irortikus.t.hA ca I  
bandhanapId.AkArI ks.In.endudas'Api dus.t.aphalI II (KarmavipAkasamgraha.h)  
**  
During the period of **BhAnu in NIca (i.e. when SUrya is in TulA**) and
that of **Ks.In.acandra (i.e. when Candra runs from S'uklAs.t.mI to Kr.s.n.as.t.amI** ) the native will suffer from **jvara - dr.s.t.inas'a - headache - kus.t.ham and other pId.A .  
**  
dhanyo'smi
