Respected Scholars,  
Namaskars to All of You.

I heard from someone that some Sanskrit organization has prepared e-version (in CD form) the Shabdakalpadruma with search facilities. Pl let me know which organization has done this and also the means to procure the same.

WIth pranams to all Sanskrit scholars and Sanskrit lovers,  
Alwar
