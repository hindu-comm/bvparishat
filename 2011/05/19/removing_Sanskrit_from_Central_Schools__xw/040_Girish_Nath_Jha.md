\> DEAR ALL,  

\>  
\> Congratulations to all those who have worked hard for this great  
\> achievement.  
\>  
\> This unity of sanskrit lovers should continue.  
\>  
\> The important thing i want to mention here is the immediate reaction  
from  
\> all scholars  
\>  
\> has made it happened

\>\>\> \*Lessons to learn – \*  

\>\>\>  
\>\>\> 1) Collective and coordinated effort works and it only works.  
\>\>\>  
\>\>\> 2) It is the ordinary people who plunged into the action first.  
\>\>\> They strive hard because 1) they are highly committed \[commitment  
can be  
\>\>\> measured by how much one sacrifices for the cause\] 2) their belly is  
half  
\>\>\> full 3) they are not worried of their status  
\>\>\>  
\>\>\> 3) Amongst the officers, there are both types of people -  
\>\>\> Samskrit-loving and indifferent to Samskrit. It is our work to reach  
and  
\>\>\> impress upon them. Sooner we do it in a mass scale, lesser the  
repetition of  
\>\>\> such incidents of not non-inclusion of Samskrit.  
\>\>\>  
\>\>\> 4) Samskrit is not being included not because of some people with  
\>\>\> indifferent attitude to Sanskrit, but because of the indifference of

\>\>\> Samskrit scholars/teachers for the mass-awakening work.  
\>\>\>  
\>\>\> 5) Governments and politicians are not going to give anything to  
\>\>\> Sanskrit as long as Sanskrit Scholars/teachers are confined to the  
four  
\>\>\> walls of Sanskrit Pathashalas and Sanskrit Departments.
