congratulations.

it is heartening to note that we r still valuing to preserve our indian language which is called as the mother of all
languages.

unity amongst the people is indeed preserving our culture a, values and heritage.

on a visit to israel in the recent past, i saw that the hebrew
language is coming back in their education, research and
institutions.

they r also fighting back to enrich their hebrew language.

of course jews r known across the world for their coming back spirit and perseverance.

  

hearty congrats once again for winning a worthy cause.

dr. karthik
