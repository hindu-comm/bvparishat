Dear scholars,  
CBSE has conceded all our demands.  
Attached is the Announcement of the CBSE available in its website.  
Since many of the intending Samskrit teachers/students may not know this development  
Hence -  
1) Pl put up this Announcement in the notice board of your esteemed institution  
2) Pl inform the unemployed Sanskrit youth who ever you know  
3) We should also prove that in fact there were many aggrieved candidates!!  
Chamu Krishna Shastry
