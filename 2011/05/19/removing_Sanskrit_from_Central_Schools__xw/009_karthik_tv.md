sanskrit as a language in some schools is taken up vigoriusly
in china.

so is the case in some london schools with a vedic reasearch
institute also in london`` with a franchisee in india....

ironically embarassing to indians.

germans r investing in sanskrit studies.

all this bcos they have scientifically proven data that the
language by itself brings an increase in IQ and general
health as the rhythmic sounds what we call as

uchcharan brings in positivity in mind and body.

strangely we indians r oblivious to our own richness caught up with our own politics and vote seeking populist measures.

high time the govt. realises this b4 1 more cultural invasion happens.

the westerners  r quick in spotting richness in others as also xploitin these richness to their own selfish interests.

soon sanskrit may bcome popular in other countries especially
the west and other countries and lose out in india where
it originates.

saavdhan.

**already i made a note of sri sri ravishankar's recent statement during his visit to kurukshetra that "samskrit ought to be a compulsory subject up to 10th class".baba ramdev knows yoga and the soul of india better as he is a student of samskrit and the [shastras.in](http://shastras.in/) a conference at prabhatashram in meerut i am told he spoke flawlessly and eloquently in samskrit for more than an hour.samskrit is thriving better in some states due to efforts by individuals and social bodies and rarely also by right thinking people in politics as in rajasthan and uttarakhand,but elsewhere samskrit more or less [suffers.as](http://suffers.as/) has been rightly pointed out,some people in a delegation should meet the ministers etc concerned and appraise them of the situation in the light of the supreme court's decision on the status of samskrit visa-vis other languages in india that is bhaarat.if an economically resurgent india fails to invest properly in samskrit,she will do gross injustice to her historic responsibility and those who think correctly should not stand mute spectators to the rot.regards,smmishra**
