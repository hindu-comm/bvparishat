please note the conclusion of this judgement:

  
  
**20. We, therefore, conclude by saying that in view of  
importance of Sanskrit for nurturing our cultural heritage,  
because of which even the official education policy has  
highlighted the need of study of Sanskrit, making of  
Sanskrit alone as an elective subject, while not conceding  
this status to Arabic and/or Persian, would not in any way  
militate against the basic tenet of secularism. There is  
thus no merit in the first objection raised by the Board.  
21. In the aforesaid premises, we direct the Board to  
include Sanskrit as an elective subject in the syllabus  
under consideration. Necessary amendment in the syllabus  
shall be made within a period of three months from today.  
22. The writ petitions are allowed accordingly. No order  
as to costs.**
