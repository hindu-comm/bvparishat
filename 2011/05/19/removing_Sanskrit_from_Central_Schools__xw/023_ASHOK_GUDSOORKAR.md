Respected Sanskrit Scholars and Friends,



Ihumbly suggest that this is a very important issue and we persuade the Vice-Chancellors of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Rashtriya  
Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, and reknowned other Sanskrit Universities to take up this matter with H R D Minister. Sanskrit Bharati, engaged dedicatedly for promotion of Sanskrit, can also take up this matter for national cause.



I believe, there may be many Members In BVParishad, who have capacity to deliberate, convince and influence the lawmakers in this regard.



Today, if the Government is thinking of deleting "Sanskrit" subject from the SSC syllabus, next year the axe may also fall on the Sanskrit Institutions/Universities.



Sincerely, with respects,

--Dr Ashok Gudsoorkar, Hyderabad.
