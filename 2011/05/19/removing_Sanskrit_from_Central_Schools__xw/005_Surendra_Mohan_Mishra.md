**already i made a note of sri sri ravishankar's recent statement during his visit to kurukshetra that "samskrit ought to be a compulsory subject up to 10th class".baba ramdev knows yoga and the soul of india better as he is a student of samskrit and the [shastras.in](http://shastras.in) a conference at prabhatashram in meerut i am told he spoke flawlessly and eloquently in samskrit for more than an hour.samskrit is thriving better in some states due to efforts by individuals and social bodies and rarely also by right thinking people in politics as in rajasthan and uttarakhand,but elsewhere samskrit more or less [suffers.as](http://suffers.as) has been rightly pointed out,some people in a delegation should meet the ministers etc concerned and appraise them of the situation in the light of the supreme court's decision on the status of samskrit visa-vis other languages in india that is bhaarat.if an economically resurgent india fails to invest properly in samskrit,she will do gross injustice to her historic responsibility and those who think correctly should not stand mute spectators to the rot.regards,smmishra**
