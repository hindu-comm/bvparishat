I think there is a need to spread awareness about the said Govt move among concerned people with adequate information. there is a huge number of people who are directly related to Sanskrit studies and also people
who are sympathetic for the cause. Co ordination among various groups will be a major thing in building up a strong agitation. I think as one of our friend has already suggested a leading figure or a body is in high need to channel the force present in the civil society into a well thought out movement.We, in our university are spreading the massage among the students and students in large numbers are ready to stand tall.A strong show will not only restrain the govt but also will be a good alarm for any such move for the future.
