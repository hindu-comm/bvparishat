Respected Scholars

  

Government is thinking about removing Sanskrit from the Central schools. It is already optional in ix and x .Nowhere in xi and xii. Now even in lower classes there is going on an evil effort of removing Sanskrit. We cannot expect that a govt. which is extraordinarily talented and imaginative in justifying its every wrong move will fall short in giving 'very convincing' excuses for such a decision. some of them may be lack of fund, lack of student strength or anything which you can or can not imagine. We need to come out strong and stand firm against such a move. The situation is alarming.We need to stop it at any cost.

Already Studying Sanskrit is fighting against the weave.Frustration in case of the students of Sanskrit is quite natural and understandable. Without any reward, without any recognition and receiving ridicule from their fellow mates, families and state in place of even a meagre amount of living they study Sanskrit. In such drastically odd situation this new move can prove fatal.

We believe our platform on VP can play a deciding role. Many prominent scholars and administrators are present in this space. It can obviously make a difference by being instrumental in creating a strong agitation against these fresh initiatives of betraying Sanskrit and the students once again.
