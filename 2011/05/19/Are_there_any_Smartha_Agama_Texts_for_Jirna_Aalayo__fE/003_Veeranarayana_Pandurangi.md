in kerala and partly Tulu country people perform all temple rituals according to smaarta tradition. but they do not follow paancharaatra/vaikhanasa or shaiva aagamas for that. I do not remember the exat text they follow but it is titled tantra... something authored by kerala pandit. you may consult Iishaanagurudevapoojapaddhati etc published by Sansthan.
