I forwarded your post to a vidvAn of kA\~nchI-maTha. Here is what he said :-  
  
If they submit the matter before our Kamakoti Acharya Shri Jayendra  
Sarasvati Shripada, He will be able to do what is right as He has  
guided the renovation of many many temples all over the country like  
this. Other than that I have no better suggestion to make.
