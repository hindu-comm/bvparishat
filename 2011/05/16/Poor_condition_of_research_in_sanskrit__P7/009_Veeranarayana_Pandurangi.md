**Importance of thinking new**

  

It is a proved factor, irrespective of field concerned, that development is based

on the innovation and creative thinking. Without the innovation no field can sustain

for long. It is simply the innovative thinking of great masters in Nyaya and Vyakarana

that earned these Sastras reputation in the history of humanities. The greatness

imposed upon the texts and undue invincibility of their authors seems to be the

culprit of creating a hindrance in thinking new. But the history of Navya Nyaya

belies such a false notion. The very birth of Navya Nyaya was the result of un-

acceptability of theories of Old Nyaya by Navya Naiyayikas. In fact the Nyaya itself

is totally based on the rational thinking and unbiased openness rather than on the

authority of some scriptures. These openness and innovative ideas are the main cause

of its popularity across the philosophical line. Even the very hard conservative

Vedantins and Mimamsakas have readily accepted the language of Navya Nyaya even

many of its theories.

Udayana, Gangesa, Bhasarvajna, Vallabha, Raghunatha etc. stand out as the

representatives of innovation. There would not have been the Tattvacintamani had all

the theories of Udayana been acceptable for Gangesa. Similar is the case of

Raghunatha and Gadadhara. Here a famous line of Gadadhara comes to the mind as

to “No illogical-diktat of an author will block us from accepting something based on

the power if reasoning”.

What was the need of Nagesa writing Laghumanjusa if only great authorities

were to write such texts. Similarly, criticism of Sankara’s interpretation by the

Bhaskara, Ramanuja and Madhva would have been simply unwarranted were

only Sankara to preserve rights on Brahmasutra. We would have lost the theory ofAnvitabhidhanavada were Prabhakara to be banned from writing his commentary

on Sabara. All these developments show that innovative thinking is the key todevelopment.

You need not be a great scholar to write a critique on Gadadhara. Only time

can test the stuff of material we produce. Academicia will throw out if the critique

is really bad. Time is the testing factor and not the contemporary status of critic or

criticized. Nobody can make state “Nobody would be let to criticize the Gadadhara

till I live”. Stating such things is simply an act of betraying ones ignorance. It is

arrogance without limit. Gadadhara or Jagadisa would have certainly frowned upon

such simpletons.

If any University is content of framing syllabus of all the old stuff and

hindering the new development, then it will become a big museum of dead concepts/

works, where the professors will perform the art of taxidermists.

All these amply illustrate that the need of innovative thinking is the key to

development. But this kind of innovation is dying in both Sastras, and so are the

Sastras. The texts and theories being studied nowadays are at least three hundred

years old. Yes, there are hundreds of Krodapatras written by scholars till the first

quarter of 20th century, but very few of them are innovative either in their content or

style. Most of them are dissections or fortifications done in defense of Gadadhara or

Jagadisa or somebody else, completely lacking new thinking.

For the last one hundred years there is no change of syllabus in Nyaya.

Sometimes even same editions are in prescription for the whole century. It is same

for the research also. Very few theses are devoted to new approach. This type of

monotonous teaching and research is killing the golden goose.
