The inputs by Dr. Jagannath, Dr. Veeranayana and other scholars are highly appreciated. Newly established Samskrita University in Karnataka is going to frame statutes for its Research Degree in near future. These discussions and suggestions will be useful for the same. Thanks a lot.

  

Some thoughts onprocedureof Research course in practice.

  

1\. In all most all Sanskrit versities the same procedure is followed during the admission to the research course. The Research scholar has to appear to an interview along with a proposal for his research which includes the discipline, topic, title and chapter-wise division plan of his thesis etc. The proposal once admitted by the doctoral committee on the table will be final. This practice limits the scope of research.

2\. The research students are allotted to a guide with out the consent of both. Neither their research interests, nor their mutual relation is considered. This is another barrier.

3\. No scope for interdisciplinary research as the research admission is possible with in the department of one discipline, where proper guide is not available.

4\. No foundation courses in either in research within the faculty or in allied subjects are not madecompulsoryto the research scholars.

  

In the contrast modern universities (Not state universities) have changed their system. Some ideas drawn from these systems are given here.

  

1\. The Research students must be given enough time after his admission in the research course and he must gain good amount of idea for his research and its methodology, which prepares him with good grounding for research. Hence,He must actively spend time with his guide and in courses at least for one year.

2\. After one year student must submit a proposal for his research for which a spl doctoral committee should be constituted. This committee must supervise the progress every 6 months. Student may be allowed to finalise the title when he arrives at conclusion one year /six months before submission.

3\. Student may be given freedom to chose his guide/guides according to availability. Sufficient time may be given to students to do thisexercise.
