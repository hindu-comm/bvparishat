Dear Scholars,

We should indeed thank Dr S Jagannatha for offering good suggestions of topics to be included for MA(Sanskrit) syllabus. However, one point is to be taken into consideration. The suggestion is perfectly all right if the students joining MA come from BA(Sanskrit) or BOL or from traditional schools of Sanskrit.  However, there are some Universities, who admit students with Sanskrit(as second language only) to MA(Sanskrit) directly.. This is being done with good intention of promoting studies in Sanskrit. But since the knowledge of Sanskrit of
these students is skin-deep, they may face difficulty, in studying the subjects(as suggested by Dr Jagannath) thoroughly, in MA.

  

Those who frame the Syllabi may kindly consider this. With respects,

--Dr Ashok Gudsoorkar
