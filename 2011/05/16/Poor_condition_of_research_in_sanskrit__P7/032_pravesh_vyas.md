thanks everybody for precious suggestions and discussion upon the  
topic. i am very grateful to all. i have one more request if we can  
give some examples of researchs in sanskrit field in modern relevant  
which became very useful to the society, like works of  
k.ramasubramunyams(from iit bombay, his work related to ancient maths  
are very famous in india & abroad also), dr. sampadanand misra  
(aurbindo society, pondichary), dr V.N. jha(Pune, nyaya shastra),  
dr .Girisha nath jha(JNU, new delhi). Dr. Balachandra rao (ancient  
astronomy, banglore), dr. H.V. Nagarajrao(mysore, grammer and yoga)  
special kind of work they are doing in sanskrit field and also very  
useful to the society. if we give these kind of knowledge to  
researchers. and also if we find out some very good topics in sanskrit  
which is very useful in modern context, we can take help from all  
these scholars. why don't we do research which can also be used  
commercially?
