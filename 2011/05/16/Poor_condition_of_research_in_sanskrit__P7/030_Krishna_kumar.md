Respected All,  
i am happy to see that our small comment has given a good discussion in bvparishat, same time please excuse me if said something wrong in my first comment . with all respect to our teachers and scholars, as a student, we are taking our responsibility of our lack of communication in languages. i would like to say, it was not only our mistake. we never get a chance to know what is happening in other institutions. Medium of communication in our college was always in our mother language. The basic syllabus book was not available in our library. There is no need to say about reference books and journals. 99% of students in our college was not aware of computers. In P.G there was no English paper at all, exception was only one book philology. there was no proper guidance.  
  
whenever we are not getting proper guidance how we will make a goal in our life. we are not aware that, in India how many sanskrit centers are working. we are accepting that thousands of Great Sanskrit scholars are working in research field. but as a student when ever we are not getting a chance to know about the respected scholars, how we will gain knowledge from them. there must be a plat form where we will get guidance of this great scholars. Really we are missing that part in our research studies, our college syllabus is not sufficient for us to work in the research field. we need these great scholars traditional knowledge support.  
respected teachers and great scholars in bvparishat will be be able to make a platform for the same purpose. it will be the great support for our future research.  
  
thanking You  
  
Krishnakumar
