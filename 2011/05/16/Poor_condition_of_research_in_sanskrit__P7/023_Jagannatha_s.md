Dear scholars,  
I read quiz paper. It will arouse curiosity in the literature as well subject.I am very happy that Dr.Jsra Prasad has brought it to the
notice of the members of BVParishat.Thank you sir.  
  
Now, my humble response to the postings of Dr. C. Rajendran and Dr. Ashok Gudsoorkar.  
  
First, I would like to mention an incident. Some forty years ago(I don't know the exact year) Vidwan T.G.Siddapparadhya wrote his thesis, Shakti-vishishtaadvaita-darshanam in Sanskrit.When he tried to submit the same to Skt.dept. of Mysore University for Ph.D degree , he had to face strong objection . Prof. R.Ramachandrarao put all the objections aside and allowed submission. Now a days nobody objects writing thesis in Samskrita. All the Skt.Universities demand Skt thesis for Vidyavaridhi. Needless to say, the Universities like Sampurnananda University, where the degree Vidya-vachaspathi is conferred, does want only Skt.thesis(as far as I’m aware).  
  
Without writing in English, scholars cannot have recognition. Tthat was exactly what was happened in the case of Prof.T.G.Siddapparadhya's Skt.thesis.  
  
I think there is a solution. If we mention Skt research/informative articles in our reseach works, they will attract the attention of the international scholars' community. I had written a short work **Pundarika** in Kannada based on Kadambari. In the introduction I had
mentioned edition of Bhattashri Mathuranathashastri and quoted some sentences from his skt. introduction. Some Kannada scholars showed keen interest in it.  
  
As Dr. C.Rajendran has said, communication gap caused by lack of English knowledge is another minus point to be noted.  
  
Some Skt. students from the foreign countries come to me for guidance. Basically they are Yoga students. While teaching them I use Skt. and not English. They not only understand, but also appreciate. When I visited Skt. dept, Chennai (NCC project headed by Prof. Siniruddha Dash) a scholar(I forgotten his name) told me that he frequently goes to England and teach Vedantic works to the Students. His students are from the countries like Japan, America and S.Africa. The language medium is Skt in his class.  
  
Dr.C. Rajendran opines that during the time of British Raj, we had so many stalwarts like P.V.Kane, V.Raghavan and Hiriyanna. They became famous not only because of their works brimming over information and analysis , but also because of their use of English of very high rank. Yes sir, you are correct and there is no iota of doubt.  
  
Even in the works of Skt writers(Ramajna Pandeya, for example), we can notice brilliance. As I suggested earlier,we may mention them in our research works. Even though the situation of not recognizing the
skt.research works will not change overnight, we can definitely improve the situation.  
kaalo vaa kaaraNa.m raajno raajaa vaa kaalakaaranam/  
iti te samshayo maa bhuud raajaa kaalasya kaaranam//  
  
The following suggestions of Dr. C.Rajendran shall be considered very seriously and nobody can raise any objection.:-  
  

1.Sanskrit Universities are made aware of global Indological research.

2.There is more international collaboration

3.Traditional scholars are to be appointed in Departments of Sanskrit inGeneral Universities along with modern scholars to restore the balance.   
  
Now, let me say a few words regarding  
Dr. Ashok Gudsoorkar's letter. The problem he pointed out is very common to almost all the skt.departments of the Universities. The students are of various Skt.backgrounds like Traditional, language, major subject etc.I do endorse the opinion of Dr.Ashok Gudsoorkar.  
  
Keeping Dr.Ashok Gudsoorkar's valuable opinion in mind, I venture to suggest that the Professors in the dept.s shall be given freedom to make some changes in the prescribed syllabus. (For some students, he/she may teach second sarga of Kiratarjuniiya and for other students, Pratimanataka.) By experience, they do know the students' different grasping levels (But in this case, setting question paper causes headache).  
  
I have heard that there was a scholar in Melukote in the last century who did not directly teach either Ashtadhyayi or Siddhantakaumudi.He taught only Kavyas with commentaries. The grammatical citations in the commentaries he would explain fully. As a result, his students, clearly understood Ashtadhyayi without need of any teaching !  
  
The main theme of these postings is, how to generate research mentality in students/what shall be done regarding poor quality in the thesis of Skt.students. Here also one may consider various mental levels of the students and different methods to arouse \`\`research-curiosity''.  
  
The result is important and not the process. Any different suggestions to generate research mentality in Skt.students are most welcome.  
  
S.Jagannatha.
