I am happy to see that present generation ofSanskritscholars are making sincere efforts to regain its lost glory. The state of affairs in poor research is also because of the fact that those who were at the whelm ofaffairsin the past themselves were not aware of research techniques and methodologies. If at all some of them were aware they only promoted their family members/near and dears.Its nice to see that now those personal fiefdoms are getting demolished and real serious scholars are emerging.

Good Luck.
