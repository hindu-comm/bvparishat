Thanks Prof. Rajendran for recalling my favorite verse of Abhinavagupta:



ऊर्ध्वोर्ध्वमारुह्य यदर्थतत्त्वं धीः पश्यति श्रान्तिमवेदयन्ती।

फलं तदाद्यैः परिकल्पितानां विविकसोपानपरम्पराणाम्॥

  

I think the above reflects the height of his thinking at the same time his humility towards the contribution of the ancestors. A very lofty idea for each Researcher of today to be born in mind. In continuation, he lists how to expose any idea in the text, as he has done in his अभिनवभारती, i.e. the method of commenting he followed in his commentary on नाट्यशास्त्र.
