Respected Pravesh Vyasji,  
Jagannathji has already given so many good topics and it will help research students in selecting the subject. i would like to add one more request here in front of all our respected scholars in bvparishat.  
  
Making a separate website, a complete data bank of eminent scholars and there works with contact address. So researchers will get the support of this eminent scholars. If, respected members of bvparishat, and the researchers in Sanskrit will come together, i expect this will be possible. Youngsters like us will get a plat form where we can take help from all these respected scholars.  
  
Thanking You  
  
With regards  
  
Krishnakumar
