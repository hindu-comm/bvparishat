Respected Pravesh vyasji,  
Thank you for accepting my idea. As youngster i feel for making this type of data bank, we need the guidance and support from the experience members of bvparishat.  
  
This was our idea of data bank:  
  
1. Making a website for the same purpose.  
2. Requesting all respected scholars, Teachers and Researchers to send the personal data with contact address through mail including the work they have done. (here we are not only requesting the personal data. Anybody can do the service by giving a complete data of scholars in there area. Through this we can reach our traditional scholars in local area where we are unable to reach through internet)  
  
3. Correction of Data and making the data in proper format.  
  
3. Data uploading to web with a *search engine*  
  
4. Publication of Data through journals in between 3 -6 (Subjective Level)  
  
  
We have started the back ground work by making a website and it is ready to launch. We are expecting all the respected scholars, teachers, and researchers will accept this idea and will give guidance to us for the next step.  
  
Thanking You  
  
Krishnakumar
