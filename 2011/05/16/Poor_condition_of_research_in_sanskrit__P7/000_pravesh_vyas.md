i think the condition of research is very poor in sanskrit field. most  
of researchs are not for any use. there are many p.hd on the same  
topic. students anyhow just completes their 300 pages and gets p.hd.  
so plz tell how can we make very strict rules related to sanskrit  
research. scholars can make a comitee and decide the most important  
topics in every field of sanskrit research and those topics should be  
given to the student.
