Sir,

'charvit-charvan' term is used regarding research works in Sanskrit. when it came in our notice that 99 researches has been already done on the concept of Atma in Sanskrit in India, then what is the need of 100th research on the same topic.... one scholar said ...'when 99th research is not opposed then why we should oppose its century.

we must think for new and innovative topic for research so that it may contribute to academia.

further we must think about scientific and technical research in Sanskrit.

I hope that honest researchers will get job surely but "approach method" in state university colleges must be rejected and transparent system will give us a new hope.

with positiveattitudes, we can make a change.

thanks.
