Respected scholars,

  

A goodsuggestion is given by Dr. T.Ganesan regarding inclusion of some portions from Mahabharata and Brahmana. I would like to add Ramayana.

  

Now I will try to suggest a syllabus for Sanskrit M.A.keeping three points in my mind :

1.Creativity (creativity is not a sin ! ).

2.Research mentality.

3.Command over Samskrta. 

  

I.TEXTS

Portions from Ramayana,(sundarakanda for beauty of language) Mahabharata(bhishmaparvan/dronaparvan/

karnaparvan for war technique)vidulopakhyana,Aitareyabrahmana(Shunahshepha), Ashtadhyayi(at least some sutras shall be learnt by heart in the order of Ashtadhyayi),Bhattikavya, Siddhantakaumudi,Gautamadharmasutra, Tarkasangraha, Padyakavyas(Kiratarjuniya, Naishadha, etc.),Campuramayana,initial chapters of Mahabhashya(paspashahnika), Arthashastra and Charakasamhita, Natyashastra, Mricchakatika, Mudrarakshasa, Amarakosha, Bhojaprabandha.

  

While teaching Bhojaprabandha the students shall be warned that the stories narrated in this work don't have historical value.

  

II.Practicals:

Writing general essays like वाल्मीकिमहर्षेर्भाषायां सौन्दर्यात्मका अंशाः, आयुर्वेदभिन्नेषु लौकिकव्यवहारेषु चरकसंहितया कृतं मार्गदर्शनम् etc..

Research articles like अर्थशास्त्र-मुद्राराक्षसयोः संबन्धः, चम्पूरामायणव्याख्याता रामचन्द्रबुधेन्द्रस्तस्य पाण्डित्यं च।

Composition of verses in various metres. While doing this students may
imitate the famous verses as shown by Kshemendra:

वाण्यर्थाविव संपृक्तौ वाण्यर्थप्रतिबुद्धये।

विश्वस्य जनकौ सेवे शर्वाणीशशिशेखरौ।।

Antyakshari programme.

  

III.Seminars(one fake seminar and two/three real seminars.)

  

IV.Quiz programme:

(**Q:**What is the name of the Ramayana commentary of Govindaraja?**A:**Bhushana.**Q:**There are two works. One work belongs to Vyakarana and another, Alankara. Both have the same name. What is the name? **A:**Saraswathikanthabharana.**Q:**Which is the most recent commentary written on Tattvamuktakalapa?**A:**Sarvankasha,by Vidwan K.S.Varadacharya.**Q:**A poet of last century employed various Hindi/bhojapuri/avadhi metres in his Samskrta poems. Name the poet and his works.**A:**Bhattashree Mathuranathashastri- Jayapuravaibhava, Sahityavaibhava and Govindavaibhava.**Q:**Who authored Siddhahemashabdanushasana?**A:**Hemachandra.**Q:**Who wrote Skt commentaries to Muulasuutras to all Shad-darshanas in the last century? **A:** Hariprasada vaidika muni.)

  

V.Reading the introductions of Skt works-preferably skt.introductions. Students shall be urged to notice thevariants shown.How do these variants occur? (An important part of Manuscriptology). Whether the printed editions have necessary indices or not. Reading journals/research articles. A discussionpanel shall be formed. This panel shall raise questions regarding the research articles. These are the questions(tentative). Has the author of this research article maintained the link between the main body and the title? Are his/her arguments valid? Is there any mistake in the bibliography added? Are there any printing devils? Is there any wrong citation?

  

It is not correct to argue that the repetitions may be avoided by linking science with Sanskrit-related titles.चर्वितचर्वण is possible even in the science-related titles. Studying pure literature \`\`scientifically'' is not an offence. The professors of Physics/Chemistry/ Biology do not try to appease the Sanskritists.
