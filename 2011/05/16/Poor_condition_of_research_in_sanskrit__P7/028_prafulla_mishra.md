Why there is poor research in sanskrit?

Many sanskrit students and teachers guiding them are notadequetly trained for research.

Many of them have no commitment. They donot peoperly scrutinize the matter. nor do they have continuous collection of information.

Sanskrit students get very little amount for fellowship.Many donot get. No systematic library with data bank is not available,.Poor students doing research are hunting after small jobs for which they donot justify thr research. Senior people in positions promote neopotism and curruption forwhich good students are dissartenedBriefluyusly viewed and speaking the reaech is not serio taken care of It is the govt that has great resposible to promote.
