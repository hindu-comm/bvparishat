Respected scholars,

  

As I observed, Shastric research works coming out from *Sanskrit Universities* are good. Particularly, the research works published by Sampurnananda Sanskrit University are really best. Even Sanskrit introductions brim over information. I was much delighted to read Sanskrit introduction of therenowned scholar SriVrajavallabhadvivedi to his edition of Nitya-shodashikarnava. Even very good scholarly works (like Paribhashendushekhara pub. at RSVP, Tirupati) are published by Skt.Varsities.

  

But the pathetic condition is in the skt.departments of general Universities. No research, no seminar, noencouragement to read Shastras. 

  

Command over (any) language means studying and experimenting with pure literature. It is in the pure literature we have more idioms, more proverbs, moreverities of expressions, more sentencepatterns, more verbs so on and so forth.I do not think that the downfall of education in Skt.departments caused by Kavyas. But not giving least importance to the commentaries do cause degradation. Even after having M.A in Sanskrit, most of the students do not have idea about what a commentary is and that is bad. Prescribing any kavya portion with commentaries will make the situation better, I suppose. As much as possible,the
shastric references seen in the commentaries shall be explained. It
will create curiosity to study original shastric works.

  

Even in the Pathashala system, first, kavya portions from the famous pancha-mahakavyas are taught. Subhashitas and Stotras will follow.

  

But I am not against for prescribing shastric texts. My suggestion is, any short shastric texts like Tarkasangraha are preferable and not Prakarana works like (Advaita)Vedanta Paribhasha. Without least idea of navya-nyaya, how can the students understand Vedanta paribhasha? Some portions of Arthashastra are preferable. In Siddhantakaumudi, Sandhi samasa and Karaka, as might be expected.

  

Along with the history of Sanskrit literature, history of various shastras may be prescribed.

  

Practice of composing of verses in various metre shall becompulsory. It gives good command over Chandas. Along with vrittaratnakara, Pingala chandassutra shall be considered while determining syllabus. All of us know that many shastric works are in verses. 

  

Referring, reading and study of research articles shall be necessary part of MA course. After giving required training, a fake seminar shall be organized. In this seminar, even the professors shall present their papers. They have to commit mistakes purposely. This is to test ability of the students to point out the mistakes like, not giving proper reference, unrelated arguments, grammatical blunders, notmaintaining link between the title and the main body of the article, not giving the bibliography- so on and so forth. A real seminar may be conducted when the students will be mentally ready to present papers
(In the law colleges, fake court proceedings are conducted to train the students).

  

In Pathashalasystem, after sahitya, various shastras are studied and they are optional. But in M.A., it is not possible. I venture to suggest that no subject may be optional and every subject may be consideredcompulsoryto every student. 

  

I must say a few words regarding science. The words Political science and Library science suggest that the word science is more than the
subjects like Microbiology and Astrophysics. Manuscriptology is considered as science of Manuscripts. If the Sanskritistsneglect command over Sanskrit itself and always talk about \`\`scientific'' subjects, they lose both IHA and PARA. It is quiet natural that without sound background of physics, nobody shall be able to find the theories of physics hinted in Sanskrit shastras.

  

Shallowarguments do not appeaseany scientist. We have to concentrate on what *is* available and not what *must be* available. Study of even Alankaras of pureliteraturein *scientific manner*makes Alankaric science !

**Science is not limited to Microbiology and Astrophysics.**

  

It is mypersonalexperience that a professor of Botony  frequently grumbles about repetition in the topics for research taken by Ph.D students of Botony.
