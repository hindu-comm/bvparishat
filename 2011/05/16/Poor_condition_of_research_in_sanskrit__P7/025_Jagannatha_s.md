Thank you Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi for informing this. This is really better. The ones who are behind this new research environment are laudable.  
  
Now, two other important points may be discussed.  
  
1.Some students are suggested by the guides to take any unpublished work available in at least three manuscripts for research. The candidates face difficulty here for various reasons. First of all nonavailability of three manuscripts of same work(in good condition). Some students know nothing about manuscripts. Why are they suggested to take unpublished works available only in manuscripts for research?. Second problem is the directors of Manuscript Libraries (sometimes)hesitate or
absolutely refuse to give them permission to take photos of the mss(in spite of their having official letters duly signed by their guides).In such a case, what shall the candidates do ?  
2.If the candidate, after registration, wants to change the title/subject, with the consent of the guide, he/she can do this by remitting some fees.Why shall the candidate spend the money for merely changing the title?
