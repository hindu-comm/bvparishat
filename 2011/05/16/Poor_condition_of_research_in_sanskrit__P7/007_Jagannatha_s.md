Devoid of valid information in thesis of Sanskrit Ph.D students is very serious matter.

  

These are my observations inthis regard:

  

1.Some students with Sanskrit M.A. are not interested in Sanskrit at all ! While Iwas studying M.A., more than six students had taken Sanskrit M.A. coursebecause they were denied entrance in the departments ofLinguistics, Library science and Chemistry. One among them (after completion of MA degree)got even Ph.D !

2. Unfortunately, Sanskrit departments ofUniversities do not give necessary importance to research. Teaching and listening- these are the two mantras of the dept.s. If teaching and listening are preferable in M.A. classes,in what way they are different from the classes ofprimary school ?

3. First year M.A.students shall have trainingon research(research methodology). Second year M.A students shall select a subject and submit a dissertation. M.Phil shall not benecessary. Needless to say, reading journals shall be necessary part of curriculum in the Varsity depts. By journals I don’t mean only journals of English. Apart from the journals like Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Journal, the students shall read even Sanskritjournals like Saarasvatii Sushamaa(Sampurnananda Sanskrit University, Varanasi) and Sagarika(Dr. Harisimhagowr University, Sagar, M.P.). Teaching shall be on the research topic. Discussion shall be Moolamantra in M.A and not (boring)lectures.

4.Training of writing in good Sanskrit shall be part and parcel of curriculum of Skt.depts of the varsities.

5. Students should be given this advice: *Simply quoting and making remarks(in most of the times, praising) is**not sufficient. Analysis with comparing vast literature and clearlystating unacceptability of the views of the authors plus highlighting the minus pointsin the literature(diction, intended ideas etc) are expected.*

6.As much as possible the language of the research works shall beSamskrta. While interacting with Sanskrit students, I found that the students who prefer Sanskrit in their thesis are better than those who want to write their thesis in the languages other than Sanskrit. The ones who want to write in Sanskrit do read original texts !Of course, there are a few exceptions.  

  

In one of my postings(dated 6. 10. 10), I had suggested some titles/subjects .

I will quote them here with a few changes.

think that they belong to चर्वितचर्वणcategory!
