1.  Use of ‘Functional Grammar’ and ‘Applied Linguistics’ to explain
    through the ‘syntax’, ‘sounds’, and ‘style’ dimension of discourse
    through the relation between ‘text and context’. 2.  Use “Discourse is Historical” and “The link between text and society
    is mediated” to substantiate ‘functional grammar’ and ‘applied
    linguistics’.
