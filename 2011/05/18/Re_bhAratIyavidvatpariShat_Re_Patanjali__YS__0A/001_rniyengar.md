Dear Prof.Kannan; Here is a quick response. The discussion has been  
educative for me. Thanks.  

  
\> 1. At the outset, I must say I have nothing against your interpretation if you are more or less \>on sure grounds that the position of dhruva noticeably altered at/during the time of the author \>of YS, and that it, in contrast, it ceased to be so by the time of the commentators. Or that the \>knowledge was accessible to the author, but to none of the commentators.  
\>  

I don't know the time of the author of YS. No one knows! But if he  
refers to movement of Dhruva he could be dated to c 1500-1000 BC.  
About the commentators, has any one discussed the position of Dhruva  
in detail? I would be thankful for any leads on this. I know the  
PuraNa position about Dhruva very well. If there are descriptions in  
Shastraic texts that would be interesting.

\> 4. Vyasa says, expatiating on bhuvana : from atop Meru uptil Dhruva is antariks"a-loka; and that \>this includes all graha-s, naks"atra-s, and tArA-s. (No criteria stated how to differentiate \>naks"atra and tArA). And so bhuvana-jn"Ana already has to encompass candra, dhruva and tArA. It \>is not clear how they differentiated between bhuvanajn"Ana on the one hand, and the subsumable \>tArAvyUha-jn"Ana (&/or
tad-gati-jn"Ana on the other).  
  

Meru is at the Centre of all that is held sacred, esoteric  
mystic...Perhaps our ancients started with a postulated physical  
cosmographic model which eventually lead to Kundalini etc and also  
inspired temple architecture. Meru is mentioned in the Tai.AraNyaka(I.  
7.1). Kashyapa is said not to leave Meru. This Kahyapa (Prajapati) was  
a star in the Shishumara along with Dhruva as per Brahmanda Purana. If  
the two can be combined it would mean Kashyapa was a circumpolar star.  
PuraNic astronomy starts with Meru and Dhruva which eventually became  
cultural and religious. There is an interesting paper by Mabbett on  
the symbolism of Mt.Meru. If you are interested in  
it....Please...email.  
IMHO Nakshatras are the stars along the ecliptic; 27-28 used for  
indicating the position of Moon. Later used also for other planets and  
Sun. Taara is a general word.  

  
\>  
\> 4. I do not know whether gati could be viewed as spatial. For, in that case, what is not spatial  
\>  

\> There are of course, only two things in the universe - matter and motion (Democritus). What moves is matter, and what matter does is to move. Are the two extricable, after all ?  
\>  
\> Or taken more liberally, or say, more exhaustively, or better, more logically, there are only four powers in the universe - dis', sAdhana, kriyA, &  
\> kAla (Bhartrhari). Of these, dis' and kAla are Space and Time. sAdhana is Thing/Matter and \>kriyA is Action/Motion. Space and Time are the receptacles or substrata of Matter and Action.  
\>  
  

Very interesting philosophical point! I am not comfy to discuss this  
on cyberspace! Kindly excuse me.  

  
\> 5. It is another matter with nAbhi-cakra as an A item.  
\>  

Could this be the reason why start of Ayurveda is attributed to the  
author of YS?  

  
\> 6. In fine, as the internal evidence is, I believe, somewhat inconclusive, corroborative \>external evidence alone can settle the issue - is what I feel, while trying not to disagree with \>you.  
\>  

Please disagree with me!  
  
kind regards
