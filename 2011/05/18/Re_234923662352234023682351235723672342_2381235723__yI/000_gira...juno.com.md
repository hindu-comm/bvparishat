Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Technical and Scientific Sanskrit Terminology.



I support thoughts of Shri N. Pathak about scientific and technical research in Sanskrit. I am reading second time the book of Dr. B. Seal on Positives Sciences of India. This book contains a large number of technical Sanskrit words given in parenthesis. The book is in English. I was reading it to check meanings of technical words given in the book againstmy understanding of those words based on my Phonemic symbolism theory. Recently I found out to my surprise I am not alone to think in this line. Somebody did undertake similar research in the past in India.
I was talking about technical Sanskrit to our scholar friend Dr. BVK Sastry from past ten years. He is interested in Spiritual Sanskrit and I am interested in mundane, technical Sanskrit words used by ancients. When we say that Prefixes (upasargas) do not have fixed meanings, when we say that Sanskrit verbal roots carry multiple meanings, I get a feeling that I am studying a subject which is constantly sliding under my feet. And we have seen on this list how scholars differ on interpreting meanings of ancient scriptural, spiritual words because there is no experiment to prove their original meanings. In order to stopbase sliding under my feet, I tied meanings of technical Sanskrit words to the physical properties of VarNas. This is new. Sanskrit is with India for at least more than 2500 years along with many other languages of India. So there has to be some give and take exchange in languages. Moreover we do not know how did SAnskrit names for trees, plants and animals arise. So as Dr. Surendra Mohan Mishra pointed out that this scheme (in case of the word Dundubha-water snake) may not work in all names and at this stage I agree. Howevermy scheme certainly offers the internal beauty of Sanskrit terminologyexplained withmany other words. New research is certainly needed which can be checked and cross-checked immediately. Not waiting to get God realization and then conform the validity of the spiritual Sanskrit of our best friend Dr. BVK Sastry.Thanks. N. R.Joshi

Sir,

'charvit-charvan' term is used regarding research works in Sanskrit. when it came in our notice that 99 researches has been already done on the concept of Atma in Sanskrit in India, then what is the need of 100th research on the same topic.... one scholar said ...'when 99th research is not opposed then why we should oppose its century.

we must think for new and innovative topic for research so that it may contribute to academia.

further we must think about scientific and technical research in Sanskrit.

I hope that honest researchers will get job surely but "approach method" in state university colleges must be rejected and transparent system will give us a new hope.

with positiveattitudes, we can make a change.

thanks.
