Dear Colleagues,

Could someone kindly inform me of the exact words used by Durgācārya on the following Nirukta citation?

Nirukta 3.4

**अ॒मूर्या यन्ति॑ जा॒मयः॒ सर्वा॒ लोहि॑तवाससः। अ॒भ्रा॒तर॑ इव॒ योषा॒स्तिष्ठ॑न्ति ह॒तव॑र्त्मनः।। **अभ्रातृका इव योषास्तिष्ठन्ति etc.

Unfortunately Durgacārya’s commentary on the third chapter is missing from my collection. Hence this request for help. Durgācārya must have said something on the source of Yāska’s citation. That is my main query.

With thanks in advance

Best wishes for all

DBhattacharya
