Das Gupta in his Yoga Philosophy questions why commentators of the grammatical school like Bhartrhari and others did not mention or refer to the identity of the two Patanjalis. Can any ‘vyaakarana’ please enlighten me on this. Is it true. If my memory serves me right isn’t there some reference to the YS in Nagojibhatta’s commentary as well as in the Vakyapadiya first chapter vrtti. It can bear on the date of the YS Patanjali
