Respected Scholars,

I want to know the answers of the following questions.

  

1\) Vedic or any other reference to Trikuta, a place name ?

2\) We were taught while doing graduation in Sanskrit that Arthashastra is a branch of science since ancient times. We know about Kautilya or Chanakya's work.

But I want to know about the older versions, how old is the tradition of Arthashastra ? My respected Teacher is no more. Can anybody throw some light in this aspect?

Please guide if possible.

With respectful pranams,

  

Yours faithfully,

Tapati Sinha
