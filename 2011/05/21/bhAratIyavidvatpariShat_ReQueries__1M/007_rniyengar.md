Arthashastra tradition should be older than Kautilya (c 400BC). Vedic  
parishista and other texts refer to Arthshastra as upaveda of Rigveda  
or of Atharvanaveda. "Baarhaspatyam-arthashaastram" is mentioned by  
Bhasa (c 200 BC) in his Pratimanataka. This text (or some later  
version of it) has been published by Motilal Banarsidas in 1921 when  
they were still in Lahore. This was edited by Pt. Bhagavad Datta &  
F.W.Thomas.
