It is the name of a Mountain in लङ्का according to वाल्मीकीयरामायण. 

  

  

  

The two references from महाभारत-

Ludwik Sternbach -***Canakya NitiTextTradition**:*in I - VI Volumes can be referred to for a history of Niti Tradition.

  

I think he has collected and compiled the verses found in Canakya Niti Texts from Mahabharata.
