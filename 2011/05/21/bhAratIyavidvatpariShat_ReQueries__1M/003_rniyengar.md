Trikakubh appears in the Yajurveda Samhitas. This is generally taken  
to be same as the "Trikakud" of S'atapatha and the Atharvaveda. Vedic  
Index by Macdonell & Keith mentions that 'trikakud' is the later  
'trikota' in the Himalayas.  
" Trikuta" as a name is PuraNic. Good reliable references on Ancient  
Geography are  
a) The Geography of the Puranas by Muzafer Ali  
b) Historical Geography of Ancient India by B.C. Law.  
c) Studies in the historical geography of ancient India by O.P.  
Bharadwaj  
d) Puranic encyclopedia by Vettam Mani
