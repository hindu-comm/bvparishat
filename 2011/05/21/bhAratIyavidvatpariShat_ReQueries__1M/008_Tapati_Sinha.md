Respected Shri Iyengar,

Namaskar.

Your information is of great value for my research work. I was looking for such an resource which can be related the tradition of Arthashastra to Rgveda; Arthshastras reflecting rules and traditions of certain life style.Now we can relate the branch of science of Arthashastra to a much older era than Kautilya. I am grateful for the above reference.

With respect,

Tapati Sinha
