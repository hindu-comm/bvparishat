Occurrences of Jina in speaking of the Buddha are found in the Pali canon. Similarly, Buddha in reference to a Tiirtha.mkara occurs in the Ardha-maagadhii canon. See, among possibly other sources,Maalava.niyaa, Dalasukha. 1983. Jainaagama aura Paali-pi.taka-gata kucha samaana vi.sayo.m kii carcaa. Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, p. 18.

  

On the whole, Theravaada Buddhism, at least in its early time, speaks only of the 'historical' ;Saakya Buddha with such epithets as bhagavaa, Tathaagata and Sugata. Avataaras of Buddha is predominantly a Mahaayaana Buddhist idea. There ;Saakya-muni Buddha is separated from the other Buddhas as need may arise. Amara, compiling his lexicon, is probably trying to reflect this semantic situation, which must be well-known in his time. The commentators seem to have read him correctly.

  

Whether the verse half after 15d originates with Amara or is some later scholar's effort to make up for a deficiency in Amara should be decided on the basis of the objective criteria of textual criticism. Generally, if an ancient commentator does not show awareness of a word or line in the commentandum, it can be taken as a later addition. The line sarvaj;no ...must be declared to be a later addition if we go by the indications in K.siira-svaamin, Lingaya-suuri and Malli-naatha. Please also check Mahes Raj Pant's excellent edition of Sarvaananda's commentary.

  

The question you allude to, namely why Amara leaves out Mahaaviira, is interesting and important. I hope someone will study Amara from the point of view of the jain tradition and determine if there is a pattern in his treatment.
