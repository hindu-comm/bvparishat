Simple answer is that पुराण-s do not provide any precise reckoned chronology within out reach of knowledge, but manvantara, yuga etc. beyond our limited knowledge of Christian Era. And the Historians take many of them as mythological accounts rather than इतिहास excepting Mahabharata and Ramayana (too principally poems in the first place
account ofgenealogy of kings) the remaining being based on interpretation of available evidence (physical or inferred).  
  

Hence two Buddha-s are posed when such contradiction between the two arises and even Candragupta Maurya and Ashoka-s are found to be posed in this connection to establish identity/difference of the two Buddha-s. Among the poets, क्षेमेन्द्र refers to Buddha as incarnation and Sri Sankara, the composer of विष्णुपादादिकेशस्तोत्र also refer to Buddha as incarnation of the Ten Incarnation scheme of Indian mythology.

  

I do not want to enter into the discussion whether there are two Buddha-s or the same Buddha. I leave it to the other members to prove or disprove it depending on their bent of thinking.
