As we are talking according to amarakoSha, let us not equate जिन with महावीर. It is not said there that जिन was महावीर.  
So, there is no confusion. amara is referring buddha as jina and not mahAvIra.

If any purANa says that mAyA-sutaH was mAravijayI, then OK and not otherwise as I'm considering paurANika-buddha and not that of bauddha-works.

Yes, jayadeva, etc. spred it. There is a possibility that jayadeva himself didn't study properly and failed to notice difference of buddha of purANas and that of 2500 BC.

He was known to him as mahAvIra was before him and had many followers.

There is no confusion. Actually due to similarities of ahiMsA, etc. mahAvIra and buddha are denoted by identical words as jina, arhat, etc.  
advaitins as shrI-harSha used word jina for bauddhas. Jainis were called by same word in other texts.  
So, I think there were similar words for both. And that is why mahAvIra didn't get separate place in any lexicon I checked.

Even bodhisattvas are not counted, I think.
