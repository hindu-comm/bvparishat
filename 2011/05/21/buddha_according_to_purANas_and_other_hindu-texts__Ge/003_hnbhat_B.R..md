Sorry that the quoted portion doesn't contain the exact reference of Amarakosha:

  

1.1.13-14c and 1.1.14d - 15 with Ramashrami commentary

NSP Edn.

  

The commentator क्षीरस्वामिन् expressly states that the earlier string refers to बुद्धावतार and the later to गौतमबुद्ध. Are the commentators confused, not probably, as per the style of the lexicon, Amara the string pose epithets of two persons anti-gods or veda-s. First may refer to Jina (Mahavira) but why the name itself is not taken as महवीर? In some manuscripts, after these two sets another set appears as the synonyms of जिन:

  

"सर्वज्ञो वीतरागो ऽर्हन् केवली तीर्थकृज्जिनः" appearing after 15d.

  

Interestingly other lexicons also consider the epithet जिन applicable to both बुद्ध and अर्हन् (महावीर):

  

"जिनो ऽर्हति बुद्धे बुद्धे च पुंसि स्याज्जित्वरे त्रिषु" quoted in Ramashrami commentary.
