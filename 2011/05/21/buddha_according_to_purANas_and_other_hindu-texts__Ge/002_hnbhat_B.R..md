Amarasimha (cir.4-5 century AD) provides testimony for your assertion who presented two Buddha's according to the commentators and his own way of presentation. First he cites synonyms of Buddha, the incarnation and next the descendant of शाक्य as शाक्यसिंहः, शाक्यमुनि without naming him as बुद्ध.

  

**Jina or Buddha 18  
**

**And Gautamabuddha :**

  

Gautama Buddha 7

  

( १. १. २९)स शाक्यसिंहः सर्वार्थसिद्धः शौद्धोदनिश्च सः

  
( १. १. ३०) गौतमश्चार्कबन्धुश्च मायादेवीसुतश्च सः

  

  

And your question finds place in this context. If we take both of these, the identical person, why the confusion for Amarasimha, himself between Jina = Mahavira, and Buddha. And according to the method followed, शाक्यमुनि etc. goes with Gautama Buddha and the words before it goes with जिन who is called मारजित्.

  

And it is popular in बुद्धचरित of अश्वघोष and पद्यचूडामणि of some other poet, biography of Buddha accounts for in detail his confrontation with काम and his army and his victory over him. Hence your question deserves much more consideration than simply accepting दशावतार incarnation theory which is a later development accomplished around 10th century at the earliest.  

  

Now the question is mixed up with the question why Mahavira was not at all known and even if known, how Amarasimha himself got the confusion between the two names? I do not have a ready solution. Not even a name महावीर popular by the time at least Amara compiled his lexicon? Nor why any of the तीर्थंकर-s find place or any name of the जैन Purana-s find place in his lexicon who was much earlier than our शाक्यसिंह Gautama Buddah:

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavira>

  

though both are seemingly contemporaries only separated not even by a century:

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha>

  

Though both survive till now in one or other forms of renewed versions. Was Amarasimha unaware of Mahavira Thirthankara and his followers or deliberately incorporated his epithets as incarnation of Buddha? Or never considered him as a religious reformer like Buddha?

  

More information on this point is solicited from the learned Scholars of this forum.
