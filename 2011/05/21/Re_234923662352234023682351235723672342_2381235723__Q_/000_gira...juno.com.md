Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



In the lush green field of ancient Indian knowledge, I include Chemistry,Physics, Metallurgy, Mathematics,Medicines from plants, and many other mundane sciences useful for making life comfortable here and not hereafter. Indian sciences were not only Dharmashastras but they also included physical sciences developed by ancient Indian scientists exploring nature around them.There one sees beauty of Indian scientific thinking. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Dhanyavad for the lively discussion on the net about the Researches in Samskrit. Today's generation belongs to a hybrid generation. Retaining the past, understanding the present, a new thing is to be evolved. Even our shastrakaaraas have very effectively conveyed the same as posted by the senior scholars.

But the pity is that the students both those study Shastras and others (who have taken samskrit as an optional in their degree classes) are not getting any information of the need to graze the lush green field of ancient Indian Knowledge.

As an example, we are only taught about kavyas in the degree classes. We had no information about any shastras during that time. But when we came to masters, we were introduced with all the shastras at a time. We had never even heard about the shastras before. I am not telling that we faced any hardships, but could there be any information about all those in the degree. So that the next generations of the students are atleast aware of the Shastras, streams. In the beginning, let there be an "INTRODUCTION, HISTORY, MAIN CONCEPTS" etc, just as information. This will atleast let the students to think about those in the days to come. It should feed all the relevant information in those classes. At least these could help to revive the information which has not reached the masses.

So I strongly feel, that the samskritists should release the ancient Indian knowledge in this forms.

I feel so because the ancient Scientific treatises are either not known or the present day students eventhough are highly qualified in the modern sciences are not able to think about the ancient Indian knowledge storehouse.

I feel, these could be pondered over and even I feel this could be (????) the need of the day.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
