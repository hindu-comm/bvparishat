Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Khara-ratha. Why Dhritarashtra was using Khara-ratha and not ashva-ratha? Who runs fast-khara or ashva? To the best of my knowledge, donkeys are used in desert (Middle-East)because they can find water in desert. Who was living here in desert-Dhritarashtra or Krisha or both? I read (O.P. Bharadvaja book) Vishvamitra was using bullock-cart when going to Mahavrishas.Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Respected Sir,

I doubt whether the term khara is for horse or not, but it is for donkey in the Amarakosha, as it says: gardhaba. But at the same time, ashvatara, another meaning (source not known), having ashva with a tarap suffix to have a meaning of "an excellent horse" too. atishayena ashvah asvatarah-dvirvacanavibhajyopapade tarabiyusnau. The Manusmriti too speaks about a khara-cart and an ushtra-cart.
