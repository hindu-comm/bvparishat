Namastey to all Scholars,

The verse mentioned by Dr. Joshi and referred to by Dr,       
Bhatt is found in the Gita Press edition of the MBh. also in shanty parva 242.71-73 . There it comes in the context of etymologies of various epithets of Lord Vishnu e.g. Govind, Hari,Hrishikesh, Shipivisht. While explaining the epithet Shipivisht, Yaska, the author of Nirukta is referred. The context does not permit to discard this particular shloka as interpolation. We either accept the whole chapter as the genuine one or as interpolated one. The verse in question fits very well in the context and cannot be regarded as later and isolated interpolation.
