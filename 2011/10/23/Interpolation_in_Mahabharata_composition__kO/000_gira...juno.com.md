Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Yaask's name in Mahabharata!



Appendix of the book, " Political History of Ancient India" by Dr. Hemchandra Raychaudhuri



The present Mahabharata refers to King Ashoka who is represented as an incarnation of Mahaasura------.

It shows reference to a Greek overlord (Yavanaadhipah) of Sauvira and his compatriot Dattaamitra (Demetrios?) The Shanti Parva mentions Yaaska, the author of Nirukta------



Was this error in composition or is this indication of the text composed after the time of Yaaska (700 BC ?) or is it a case of unrelated interpolation by unknown person or persons?



Although it was repeatedly posted the time of battle of the Epic as 3050BC t0 3000BC, I have not come across a book which clearly shows the time of three battles-(1) Battle (Sudaas fame) of 10 kingsdescribed in Rigveda, (2) Battle of Abhyavarti Chaayamaan with bands of Vrichivaan and (3) the last the battle of Mahabharata with respect to the time of archaeological discoveries in Mohejo-daro and Harappa. If anybody knows a book on this subject, please let me know. THere is still confusion in my mind about time line of these three battles from the ancient Indian history. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
