Here is the reference as from the data entered in DCS:

  

  

-   MBh, 12, 330, 7.1  
    **yāsko**mām ṛṣir avyagro naikayajñeṣu gītavān /  
    [Context](http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=328525) -   MBh, 12, 330, 8.1  
    stutvā māṃ śipiviṣṭeti**yāska**ṛṣir udāradhīḥ /

  

if it helps. In the Critical Edition, the Paada Index can be looked into whether these are considered as Interpolations or present all the manuscripts and confirmed.

  

The problem with Rishi names is that many popular are associated with the "gotra" name suffix added to the name of the "gotra" pravartaka Rishi-s. Panini had referred to the "gotra" of Yaska, and the all the descendants of the "gotra" could be called as यास्क-s.

यस्कादिभ्यो गोत्रे॥२।४।६३. Any one of them may be the author of Nirukta and some other among his ancestors may be referred to in Mahabharata. These reference by itself doesn't seem to be enough to consider them as interpolations.
