Dear Dr. Joshi,

  

A brief response follows my reproductions of the essential parts of your post. I had to change your order for the sake of logic in presentation.

  

Dr. Raghu Vira has addressed most of the problems you articulate in his introduction to the larger/largest version of his dictionary. Everyone wishing to preserve Indian languages should read this introduction.

  

In some parts of India, what Raghu Vira said was distorted (probably to score political points or just because there was no realization of the seriousness of the situation). He wrote that the word for a train/railway signal should NOT be something long like agni-ratha-gamana-aagamana-suucaka-loha-pa.t.tikaa but simply sa.mketa (introduction p. 49), but critics presented the former as his view.

The traditional Indian/Sanskritic way of creating technical terms was \***essentially\***the same as it is in a language like English or German. In most cases, (a) The words of the ordinary language were allowed to acquire technical senses in the specific contexts of various disciplines. (b) Extensions of the established or transparent words were done through prefixing and suffixing. In other words, the situation is not different from using "inertia" in a technical sense in physics (compare prak.rti in philosophy, artha-;saastra, [vyaakara.na](http://vyaakara.na) etc.) or giving ayas-kaanta the company of ayas-kaanti.

  

There were also meaning translations in the case of especially botanical names. Rarely sound similitude was also used.

Most of the phonetic similarity in terms coined by competent persons like Raghu Vira is there because Greek, Latin and Sanskrit are related.

Clarity of meaning comes from the context. English words seem self-explanatory to persons like you and me simply because we are used to seeing them in specific contexts. The coined words will also function similarly if we give them sufficient space and time. Bhart.r-hari in his Vaakyapadiiya observed more than fifteen hundred years ago: yasminn uccarite ;sabde yadaa yo 'rtha.h pratiiyate / tam aahur artha.m tasyaiva. naanyad arthasya lak.sa.nam //

  

Generally, paragraphs and sentences should be the units for translations. Concentrating on words is unproductive and misleading.

This seems so to you partly because you are looking at Sanskrit words with Marathi associations and a mind showing the influence of colonization, particularly Victorian ideas of what is socially proper ('Don't mention private parts'). Words like ;saastra-yoni were used without any inhibition by Sanskrit authors (Brahma-suutra 1.1.3). A marriage is no longer called ;sariira-sa.mbandha. Men introduce their wives as "Mrs" instead of patnii. And while doing this, Maharashtrians and other Indians think that they have become more scientific, liberal, progressive!

What will happen if we allow English words to enter Indian languages without any speaker-exercised restriction?

  

(This is already happening. In most of the speech you here in India nowadays, only the proper names, personal pronouns and verbs are Indian -- many verbs are in fact hybrid; the real thought-bearing words of a sentence are all English. The English words take over even where good Indian words exist. This is less so in public speeches of authors of a linguistic tradition, but in private speeches the phenomenon has virtually become a rule.)

  

First, the pronunciations of Indian words and intonations of sentences will change. Gradually morphology will be affected. Then thought-processes and creativity will change. Indian speakers will begin to think in English categories. They and the world will miss some discoveries and inventions that only their languages could have made possible.

  

(The preceding three stages are already detectable in most major languages of India. How many languages are producing anything beyond poems, stories, novels, plays etc. that the other language communities would like to translate? Probably the tribals are more blessed in this regard than the educated city-dwellers.)

  

Probably, such languages overwhelmed by other intellectual traditions will gradually become pidgins or creoles. They will eventually die.

  

If they have a large number of speakers, they would probably die a slow death. Their speakers would probably not become aware of the process until it is too late.

  

I am aware that I have expressed myself tersely in answering your last question.Each of the above paragraphs would probably be not clear to some readers of this list as to the reasoning involved. However, this is the best I can do at present. Too many other writing obligations are waiting in front of me.
