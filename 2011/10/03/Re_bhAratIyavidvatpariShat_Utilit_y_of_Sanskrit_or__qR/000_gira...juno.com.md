Dear Prof. A. Aklujkar,

Many thanks for detailed listing of Prof, Raghuvira's work and ofother related references. I knewname and work of Prof.Raghuvira from my college days in India. The purpose of my question was different. Before English arrivedin India, Indian scholars of astronomy, mathematics, even metallurgy were using Sanskrit terminology in their treatises. How did they choose those technical terms? Today English scientists take help Latin and Greek words in coining technical terms, example Hysteresis. But Indian scholars only know Sanskrit. They used Aks'a as well as KarNa for diagonal.What was the logic behind choosing such terms? There is ancient terminology in Sulva (Sulba) sutras. The book "The positive sciences of India" offers some ancient Sanskrit terminology as well as phrases. What Newton called Inertia was described long before asPoorva SanskAra in ancient books. One way it is correct. This is my opinion-If there is ancient terminology, then use that first before coining new words on ad hoc basis-Example: There is word for magnet in ancient books. It is Ayas-kAnta. Now some books called it Loha-chumbaka. From Ayas-kAnta one naturally gets the word for Magnetic field-Ayas-kAnti. Modern terminology in some cases is kinky like Generator-Janitra, Optical slit for collimation-Yoni. Many times terminology is based on phonetic similitude instead catching the concept. Other based on general knowledge, like Probability-SambhavatA, ShakyatA etc. It does not explain concept behind it. Complex number-Jatil SankyA, Kathin Sanskya. It does not explain concept. Idea is this new terminology should explain the concept instantaneously. I call that Anvarthaka SanjnA. Isac Asimov has written a book on "scientific terminology". There he describes funny aspects of English scientific words which does not have connection to the concept. If we are going to do the same, then why not use English?. That is all people do. Why to replace one useless term by another useless term? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
