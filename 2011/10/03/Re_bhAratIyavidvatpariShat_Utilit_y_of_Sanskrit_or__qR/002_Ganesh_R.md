Dear Dr. Ashok Aklujkar,  
  
I have gone through the marvelous Dictionary of Late. Raghuvira( when I was doing research in IISc, Bangalore and unfortunastely now this work is not seen in that Library) and it is very great work. I completely endorse your view. His work has been unduly treated and often ridiculed for bad reasons. By any chance, can I get a soft copy or even a hard cop of his stupendous work? Please guide me in this regard. i will be really grateful to you.  
  
with regards  
  
ganesh
