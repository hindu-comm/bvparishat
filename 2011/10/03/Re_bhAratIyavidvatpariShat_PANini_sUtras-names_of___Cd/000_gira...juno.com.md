Dear Prof Narang,



Garden of Heaven!



Thanks for reply. I am trying to get the book of V.S.Agrawal. For the time being I assume that "VarNa" was the name of a country. There is reference to this country in the book "Persian Empire" by Ernst Hertzfeld. It is also referred in the book of Sylvia Matheson as "VareNa" the 14th land, superior. Behind the name of this country there was ancient legend that the name refers to Heaven. This was north of Parthian Satrapy of Persia. Parthians were called sometimes ParNi, AparNi. This was the area what Prof D. Bhattacharya was referring to a "Chorasm or Khwarism" (the area of modern Uzbekistan). In the Jews' book, in the east where Heaven touches the Earth, in the north was the garden of Heaven This country was called Paradise in English. Behind the word Khwarism was Sanskrit name. For ancient Iranians land of gods was beyond their northern boundary.Thanks. N.R.Joshi
