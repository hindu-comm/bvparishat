Dear Dr. Bhagwan Singh, Thanks for explanation. I was not referring to the time of Parthian history (200 BC to 200 AD) Hertzfeld says in footnote that behind the name VarNa there was old legend ofHeaven. There were no gods and their Heaven in the known history of Parthians or Indians. The legendary land was somewhere north of location of Parthians of the known history. On this list in the past there was discussions about Rigveda verse about war of Indra with ladies soldiers of Namuchi. Indra captured two lady soldiers and kept them for himself. One Aacarya from India confirmed the name of the country Rusham from Vedas. All these countries were not within the borders of the subcontinent according to my search.Connection of Munjavat ( see Dr. Kalyanraman's posting on Munjavat), Soma, Indra, ladies kingdom. Rusham all indicate towards Pamir plateau and beyond. Please share your information with us so that I could correct myself. Also in the known history that area was known as Kwarism. How do you explain that name? Thanks. N.R.Joshi

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
