### Hindu dharma and Bauddha dhamma -- Ananda K. Coomaraswamy (1943)

Ananda K. Coomaraswamy asserts that Buddhism is not a new religion but rather a reiteration with different emphases of the same old Vedic teachings.  
  
Presented hereinj are excerpts from the two lectures delivered by Ananda K. Coomaraswamy in 1942 in the Jewish Theological Seminary, New York.  
  
The excerpts are from two essays of Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, which were originally published in 1943. They are authoritative expositions of the teachings of these religions as understood by those who practised them rather than understood by scholars and comparative religionists. Coomaraswamy assumes that Hinduism, even in its oldest form, was neither polytheistic nor pantheistic and it is the oldest of the surviving mystery religions whose formulations are essentially the same those of Platonism, Christianity and other traditional doctrines. Buddhism is also treated in the same manner.

ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY: HINDUISM and BUDDHISM  
  
Edited by Keshavaram N. Iengar and Rama P. Coomaraswamy  
  
1999, xxiii+87pp., notes, index, ISBN: [81-7304-227-6](tel:81-7304-227-6): Rs.250 (HB) \[IGNCA, Manohar\]  
  
The present publication comprises two essays of Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, which were originally published in 1943. They are authoritative expositions of the teachings of these religions as understood by those who practised them rather than understood by scholars and comparative religionists. Coomaraswamy assumes that Hinduism, even in its oldest form, was neither polytheistic nor pantheistic and it is the oldest of the surviving mystery religions whose formulations are essentially the same those of Platonism, Christianity and other traditional doctrines. Buddhism is also treated in the same manner. He asserts that Buddhism is not a new religion but rather a reiteration with different emphases of the same old Vedic teachings.  
  
The present edition is the first to include the later revisions and additions made by the author and must therefore be considered as the definitive edition of this seminal work which became famous ever since its first edition saw the light of day in 1943, the book consisting of the text of two lectures delivered the year before on the two great religions of India.  
  
  
KESHAVRAMA N. IENGAR, started his professional career as an architectural assistant at Madras, was associated in the field of architecture for over 25 years with the Madras and Bangalore Universities. Later, he became Professor of Architecture at the B. M. S. College, Bangalore. An amateur Hindustani Khayal singer, Sri Iengar is an exponent of the Gwalior Gharana of Hindustani classical music.  
  
RAMA P. COOMARASWAMY is the only surviving son of Dr. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. He was Associate Professor of Surgery at the Albert Einste College of Medicine, New York. At present, he is Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in Connecticut. He has authored over 40 articles in the surgical research field as well as innumerable articles in theology and philosophy.

Hinduism and Buddhism is one of the last works of Coomaraswamy and among his most significant as was recognized by Rene Guenon who, in a review written in 1946 in*Les Etudes traditionelle*s, referred to it an "ouvrage importante". Like Time and Eternity and Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power in the Indian Theory of Government, which belong to the same period in life of the author, Hinduism and Buddhism deals with the essence of the subject that it treats and it does so from a purely traditional and metaphysical point of view. The author looks upon Hinduism and Buddhism, not from a historical point of view, but from the perspective of the philosophia perennis to which A.K. Coomaraswamy would add et universalis. In a masterly manner he reaches the heart of Hinduism through the major scriptural and other traditional sources from the Â§Rg Veda to the Vaisnava, Saiva and Tantric texts and especially the Bhagavad Gita and summarizes the teachings of the tradition under the categories of myth, theology and anthology, the way of action and the social order. Coomaraswamy's perspective is strictly metaphysical throughout and he refutes many distorted ideas including the popular understanding of reincarnation.  
  
In the case of Buddhism also Coomaraswamy is more interested in the myth in the traditional sense at the heart of the religion rather than in its historic development. He sees Buddhism as the re-establishment of perennial truths and shows its proximity to the teachings of the Upanishads. After examining specific teachings of Buddhism such as the monastic regimen and dharma which he equates with the charioteer of the chariot whose symbol is present in both the Upanishads and Buddhist texts, Coomaraswamy concludes that the Buddha, the Arhat, is none other than the spirit (atman) within all beings. To quote Kapila Vatsyayan in her foreword, the "Buddha thus is Brahma, Prajapati, Light of lights, Fire or Sun, in short the first principle, and ultimately the realization of Nirvana is the flight of the alone to the Alone and is the void that passeth to the Void." (p. xiii).  
  
This new edition is well printed and includes besides the foreword of Vatsyayan a preface by Robert A. Strom dealing with the reaction to this perennial work after its appearance in 1943. We must all be grateful to K.N. Iengar and R.P. Coomaraswamy for their careful editing of this enlarged and definitive edition of one of the most important traditional studies of Hinduism and Buddhism. This truth holds even if some of the followers of Buddhism were not pleased with the way that Coomaraswamy sought to show the profound metaphysical unity underlying the teachings of the two religions. All admirers of the works of A.K. Coomaraswamy must also be grateful to Kapila Vatsyayan and the Indira Gandhi Centre for making this and other precious works of the doctor available once again.
