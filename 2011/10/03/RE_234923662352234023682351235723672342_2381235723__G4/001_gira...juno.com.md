Dear Dr. V. Pandurangi, I am glad you brought this subject. Who is spreading mythology? Indians are doing themselves. (1) In Jan 2001 Dr. Amartya Sen in Annual conference of Indian History congress at Alipur campus of the Univ. of Calcutta said that Ramayan and Mahabharat have no historical value. These two epics are simply mythology-------. (2) Dr. S.S.N. Murthy (Delhi Univ) published article in Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies (You know whose Journal is this) saying we have seriously doubt the historicity of matter presented in epic Mahabharat. (3) Govt of India publication-(around 1970) -Vyaasa was 75 percent non-aryan. (Would you like to extend this-Vyaaas's children were also non-aryan?). How many examples do you want? Now see what lover of India say-Vedas have seven layers. Mahabharata has three layers. Now how many layers Indian scholars have separated in the past 2500 years of known history? By the time researcher look at one corner of one layer he is dead. These layers promote all kinds of wild symbolism-half time hanging in the sky reaching to distant Nakshatras, half on earth. And why to give attention to archaeology? Everything can be explained using Patanjali's Yogashastra as spiritual symbology. Is not this going on India? Saadus and Babas describe all puranas with chamatkar-awe must be created so people bow down to them. Can you ask the question to Saadhus-Was Takshaka man or snake-Is this mythology or Satyalogy? This situation of Indian researchforced me to find out evidence of Mahabharata outside of India. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
