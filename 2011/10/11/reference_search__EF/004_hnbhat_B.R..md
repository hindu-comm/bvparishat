It is open to different speculations some with clues some without.

  

It is still possible that these were the basis of the Entire Paninian system, whether it was borrowed from Shaiva tradition or himself created. The other possibility is that Shaiva tradition created a text based on these Sutra-s, originally formed by Panini himself as the basic frame, and thereby making Panini deify dependent on Shaiva tradition. The legends of Panini and the story about Panini, Vararuci and Katyana, are collected in Haracaritacintamani of Jayadratha (or Jayaratha), the commentator on Alankarasarvasva, and staunch Shaivite, following the legends found in बृहत्कथामञ्जरी through the बृहत्कथा and Somadeva's कथासरित्सागर. By his declaration,

  

पाणिनिर्भगवानेव स्वयं चन्द्रशेखरः।

प्रतिष्ठाप्यते कोऽन्यो दिव्यं व्याकरणं भुवि॥२७.१६५॥

  

the complete Chapter devoted to पाणिनीय व्याकरण naming it as शब्दशास्त्रावतार, by which time Patanjali also was deified by tradition, by ascribing him the incarnation of शेष, (either by Shaivite or Vaishnavite tradition). During the transition, the नन्दिकेश्वर authored his कारिका based on the materials too to glority the omniscience of शिव-sutras, once accepted as originated by शिव himself. Traditionalists may be opposed to this hypothesis (or rather guess) and produce more evidences to prove him identical or incarnation of शिव. 

  

The use of Pratyahara-s consistently shows some relation of his scheme with those Sutra-s, though there are certain lapses. Instead of twice repeating the letter he might himself have included only one and framed his rules according to it, if these were composed by himself as the basis for his framework of grammar. But needed justification based on his use of different Pratyahara-s based on these two.

  

More debate is solicited on this point.
