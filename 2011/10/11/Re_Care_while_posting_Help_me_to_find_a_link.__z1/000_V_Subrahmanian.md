Namaste Sri Bipin ji,  
  
While sending a post to the group kindly take care to delete all posts not needed for the topic you are posting on. For instance in this post you have included all the posts that various members posted on various topics yesterday - the entire Digest. As a consequence the length of your two-line post has become enormous!!  
  
Regards,
