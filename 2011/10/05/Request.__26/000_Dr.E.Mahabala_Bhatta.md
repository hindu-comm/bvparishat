Respected Scholars, Will you please kindly enlighten me about these?

  

1)द्वादशाष्टमजन्मस्तु शनिरङ्गारको गुरुः।

कुर्वन्ति प्राणसन्देहः----------------?

  

What is the remaining portion of this? Almost all the astrologers use this verse while predicting. But they do not tell the portion left. Another thing which is not clear for me is in every Pancaangam there are two kinds of counting the eras. One is Phasali Shaka 1420-21 and the other is Kollam Shaka 1186-1187. What are these? How ,when and where these eras started? Can any body enlighten me upon these? Even a Panchangakartha . also did not clarify these to me. Hence I seek your kind help.
