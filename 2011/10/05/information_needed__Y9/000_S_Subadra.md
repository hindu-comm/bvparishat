Respected Sirs.  
In Brhatsamhita of Varahamihira,I read about impregnation of clouds  
which is called 'Garbhadhanam'. Other than Brhatsamhita is it  
mentioned anywhere else? Ialso read that through various yajnas using  
different kinds of samit and mantras the Vedic seers could impregnate  
the clouds.Can this be compared to present day cloud seeding?  
Please help me.  
Subhadra
