# Get set for a heritage channel

CHENNAI: This Vijayadashami, which falls on October 6, one more regional channel will go on air.

The channel called Krishna TV, will have Dr Subramaniam Swamy, Harvard professor and former Union Minister, as its Chairman. His Chanakya Neeti Communications (P) Ltd has become a Joint Venture Partner with Krishnaswamy Associates Media Renaissance.

Arasu Cable Corporation will offer the channel to subscribers of their 37,000 cable operators.

Krishna TV, which claims to be a heritage channel, will air programmes 10 hours per day — From 7am to 9.30am, 11am to 1.30pm, 3pm to 5.30pm and 7.30 pm to 10 pm.

With content designed in Tamil and English languages, the channel will air programmes which will focus on healthy entertainment, besides dramatised versions of the lives of saints. It will also air programmes on Vedas, Upanishads, and Tamil Bhakthi literature. Swami Dayananda Saraswati will deliver a weekly discourse on the channel as will Shri Mumtaz Ali, popularly known as Shri ‘M’, a great scholar in the Upanishads. Monks of the Ramakrishna Math, who are actively involved in the channel, are to conduct discourses and classes. A 52-episode Tamil TV serial on the life and teachings of Swami Vivekananda will be among the highlights of the channel in its inaugural year.

Kathakalakshebams by eminent artistes, besides classical music and dance concerts by leading performers get pride of place. While it will be a predominantly Tamil channel, there will be some English programmes.

Speaking at the launch of the channel, Dr Subramanian Swamy said, “We may call ourselves Tamilians first, or Dravidians, but the fact is that we are all Indians. What is our religion? What are we going to preach here? There is more to learn from our own. People gather in several numbers at the Kumbh Mela and at so many religious affairs. What matters ultimately is to be united at heart, which is actually missing,” he said as he also thanked the current chief minister of the state, J Jayalalitha for making the channel happen.

“This channel was an idea and a dream of mine for six years. For some reason or the other, it was not materialising. Today, it is out eventually,” he added. Stressing on the fact that the channel was neither commercial nor only for entertainment, co-chairman of the channel Dr Krishnaswamy said,“We want the breeze from all lands to flow into ours without uprooting ourselves. A true Hindu accepts and respects all other religions and faiths.”

Chennai, Tamil Nadu, October 4, 2011 /India PRwire/ -- KRISHNA-TV is conceived as a channel which is proud of Indian Heritage and is equally proud of the achievements of new India, using the modern tool of communication to concurrently enlighten a new generation of Indians.

KRISHNA-TV is uplinked to Intelsat-17 (66 Degree East 4015.0 MHZ) by Tata Communications. ARASU Cable Corporation will offer the channel to subscribers of their 37000 cable operators from Vijayadasami Day, 6th October 2011.

**About Krishnaswamy Associates**

"We Film To Build Bridges of BrotherhoodWe Shoot To Destroy Walls Of Prejudice!" That is the Vision Statement with which Dr. S. Krishnaswamy founded Krishnaswamy Associates in 1963 to make non-fiction films. Dr. Mohana Krishnaswamy joined his deliberately small company diversifying from exclusive non-fiction material to entertainment and fiction for Television. But the spirit of the original vision statement has been consistently maintained for 48 long years. As a writer-director of documentary and television films, Dr. S. Krishnaswamy has won several national and international Awards, including PADMASHRI from the President of India. As a Producer, Dr. Mohana has won her own Awards both in India and abroad.

The Krishnaswamys founded Krishnaswamy Associates Media Renaissance in 2009 as a Not-For-Profit Initiative under section 25 of the Companies Act, to commence a Heritage TV Channel. Apart from their own seed capital, donors contributed to ensure that modern infrastructure are created for the new TV channel. However an equally committed leadership was required to ensure the smooth functioning of the channel with requisite working capital and total involvement in the ideology of the channel.

In this context, Dr. Subramanian Swamy, the eminent visionary, Harvard professor and former Union Minister has come forward to be the Chairman of KRISHNA TV. His Chanakya Neeti Communications (P) Ltd has become a Joint Venture Partner with Krishnaswamy Associates Media Renaissance.
