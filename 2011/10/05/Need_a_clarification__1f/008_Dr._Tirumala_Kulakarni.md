Normally Vatsyayana's Kamasutra is linked with Sexology. In a talk in Poornaprajna Samshodhanmandira's seminar by Prof. Radhavallabh Tripathi I came to know that it is the very important work on to know on Indian Psychology. Psychology means 1. The Science of Mind and 2. The Science of Behaviour. So people speaking on Indian Psychology only quote from Patanjali's Yogasutra. It goes in to the details of Manas-Buddhi-chitta-Chetana-Ahankara etc.. However Kamasutra is an astonishing example of The Science of Behaviour.
