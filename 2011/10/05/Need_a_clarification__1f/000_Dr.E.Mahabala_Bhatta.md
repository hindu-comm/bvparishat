Respected great scholars, Is there anybody who has made a research on the great work of Vatsyayana called Kamasuthra? Please let me know . It is a work, I feel, very important for all the ages more so during these days. The great sage Vatsyayana depicts a very ideal family life which leads to the formation of a healthy society. Will you enlighten me on this?

Thank you and regards,
