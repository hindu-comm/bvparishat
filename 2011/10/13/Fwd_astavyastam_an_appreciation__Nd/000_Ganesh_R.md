Dear Sirs,  
  
I am just forwarding my mail addressed to our scholar/poet friend sri.S Jagannath in appreciation of his wonderful sanskrit satirical play which one and all interested in this language should read, enjoy, think and act.  
  
regards

आर्य, सादरं वन्दे, विन्दे च भवदनामयं साहितीव्रिवस्यां च।  
क्षन्तव्योऽयं जनः। यतॊ भावत्कं परमरुचिरं रूपकमस्तव्यस्तं पठित्वा य आनन्द उपपन्नॊ मयि स भवति नाद्यावधि निवेदित इति चेखिद्यते चेतः।  
अस्तव्यस्तं स्मस्तां सुरगिरममलां मानुषीकर्तुमुत्कं  
 प्रेक्षायागप्रयोगं प्रकटयति किल स्थान एवाभिरामम्।  
येनार्याणां नु वाणी पुनरिह भजते प्राणवायुं नवीनं  
 जैवो भावो मृतेस्स्याद्वर इति सुरताछ्द्मनादप्यवैमि॥  
  
Your unfailing wit, sparkling satire, striking contemporaneity and lively style have yet another won the show and I honestly deem that this is a singularly unique and effective way of dispelling the unwanted, unrealistic and more than any thing, harmful myth of Sanskrit as devavaaNi/mRtavaaNi. The plot is very original and the characterization is too natural. The racy dialogues find no room of doubt that you wield your pen with utmost felicity in employing this beautiful eternal language as it is intended to be used. My only grievance is that you being such nice padyakavi, have spared much of your creativity and unique virtue of idiomatic versification. I strongly recommend astavyastam to all seekers of sanskrit. Here we have a true contemporary writing in sanskrit that is simple and yet classical. the originality of theme is a welcoming breeze in the lore of modern sanskrit literature.
