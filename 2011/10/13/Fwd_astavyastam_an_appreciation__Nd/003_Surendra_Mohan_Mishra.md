Thanks Dr Ganesh ji for the kind words on my small verse.We have in our tradition great esteem for the S'ataavadhaanin-s among whom you stand out.The name of your institution is promising and inspiring.Once I had an opportunity to have Sri Dorbala Prabhakar Sharma here.There should be some befitting occasion when your good self and Dr Jagannath are here in our university.deva.h kaalasya kaara.nam.  
Best regards,
