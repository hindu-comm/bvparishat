Respected scholars......

I am requesting you all to discuss on contemporary issues such as
religious traditions which we have been fallowing since ages....!!!

Lots of so called revolutionary thinkers diverting youth from its routs by terming those traditions as baseless or meaningless.......!!

So scholars like you people can make use of this group to discuss on those topics and bring youths together..............!!

Healthy and constructive discussion on such topics will do wonders for the community, scholars as well....!!!!

Regards and Panamas
