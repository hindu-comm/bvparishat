Dear Friends

PraNamyA..Recently When I had been to the temple at Simhachalam there in the inscription on a pillar it was written as "Yavana Raajya sthaapanaachaarya".The pillar has

the inscription of KruShNadevaraaya in Sanskrit where-in the king during his "Jaitrayaatra"

upto Cuttack visited the said temple and offered many valuable jems to the Deity there.To stand as testimony for his visit he got the inscription inscribed on a pillar there.I was struck with surprise to look at the adjective of KruShNaraaya as"Yavanaraajyasthaapana

chaarya"The inscription belonged to the 16th century.Hither-to no body observed it and got it corrected.What did he establish ? Hindu Raajya or Yavana Raajya ? How to rectify

this historical error may kindly be pondered over by the friends of the bv parishat.The temple is in Andhra Pradesh near Vishakhapatnam.The deity is Sri Varaha LakShmi Narasimha Swamy.

Regards,

insacharya.
