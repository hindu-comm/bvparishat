Dear Dr. N. Rajaram,



Did you think about the reaction of Dr. Balram Singh to your remark on Center for Indic Studies at UMass, Darmouth? Should not you, and many of us think positively about these groups and give them chance to improve with time?



I would like to add one more item here. I am reading the book," The Vedic Harappans" by Dr. Bhagwan Singh. This book is big hammer right on the head of Aryan Invasion Theory. More later on.NRJoshi.

 I am working on an article on the subject why Hindu groups have failed to build a credible intellectual base. We have build many temples in the West but when one looks at centers of learning-- like the 'Hindu University of America', WAVES, and unfortunately of late even the Center for Indic Studies at UMass Dartmouth, they are an embarrassment.



 They are a combination of shamateurism and crude self promotion.
