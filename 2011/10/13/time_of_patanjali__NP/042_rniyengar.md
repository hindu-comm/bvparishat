Dear Dr.Sundaresan,

You have brought in an extra dimension into this discussion. The text under discussion viz.Gururatnamālāand the commentarysushamA need careful scrutiny as you have rightly pointed out. Without getting into thecontroversies between the two famous MaThas, my question to is: What could have been the motive for the poet (who ever he might have been) to bring in Iarchus and Apollonius the Greek? The commentator has enlarged on this point with more names. The printed book*Pañcaprakaraṇī*to which Shankara provided the link was published in 1891. The English text "The Indian travels of Apollonius of Tyanaby[Priaulx, Osmond de Beauvoir, 1805-1891](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Priaulx%2C+Osmond+de+Beauvoir%2C+1805-1891%22). wasPublished in[1873](https://archive.org/search.php?query=date:1873)in London. Suppose we go to the extent of postulating that the poem was composed by some one after reading the above book, what could have been the possible motives for such an exercise? This may not provide an answer to Patanjali's date, but may give a clue to some other puzzle of history. Swaminaathas'rauti the compiler of the*Pañcaprakaraṇī* in the last page of his book mentions that the Gururatnamālā has another commentary by name: *Prabhaavimars'ínii. *It is important to consult this also before drawing further conclusions. If you have a copy of this commentary, please share the same.
