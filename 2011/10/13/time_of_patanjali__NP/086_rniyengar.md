Dear Sri Vidyashankar, Namaste!

The confusion reference was to myself, not about your work. You work isविद्याशङ्कर-महारण्यम् Making way through a wide field can be confusing, butthat is not the fault of the topography., which you have ably mapped.I would be too happy to talk to you in person when you visit Bangalore in December. My interest in the contrasting lineages is purely academic. I get curious if some one claims existence of recorded or remembered history older than Aryabhata and Varahamihira. KKP is clearly a case for further study. Lo behold! their portal not only provides the names and the reigning period of the Acharyas but also the names of the years in the 60-year cycle. I have looked into these and find quite a few internal inconsistencies. A strong criticism could be: "these figures are not hard history but some kind of back fit memory and hence not reliable". But this does not answer why a religious establishment has to trace its origin to 482 BCE. Something of great importance is likely to have happened around this year. \[This might have been even a natural event such as a comet, or some celestial figure, or an earthquake\]. Also this figure is too close to the main stream date of Buddha's NirvaaNa. This coincidence can not be easily missed. I am fairly well conversant about how orthodox Brahminical institutions work in South India. Notwithstanding their deep rooted history independent or timeless view of Vedic culture, benchmarks and signatures in real time can be found occasionally, even if interpretation may throw up new questions. Prof.Paturi's point about prior existence of Tantric traditions also needs careful consideration.
