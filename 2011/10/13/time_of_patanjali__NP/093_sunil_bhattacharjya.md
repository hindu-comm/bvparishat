Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

If I have given the impression that I am advocating for the Kanchi matha, I would like t say that I have no such intention and I have not compared the Shringeri math with the Kanchi Kamakoti math. My only pain is that the other Shankara mathas like Dwarka math and the Puri math also claim that Adi Shankaracharya was born in 509 BCE and that is not the same as what the Shringeri math claims. . So in any discussion on the date of Adi Shankara, one should not bring in the Kanchi Kamakoti math to drown the main issue.  
  

As regards the great Swamijis of the Shringeri math is concerned i have the highest regards for them and to my knowledge the Swamiji had left the issue of the date of Adi Shankara to the historians to decide as one of the earlier mathadhipati had already clarified long ago that Adi Shankara was born on the 14th year of reign of Vikramaditya. The Madhaviya Shankara Vijaya says that Adi Shankara was a contemporary of King Sudhanva. There are several other clues on which one would be able to discuss the issue of the date Adi Shankara, if there is a sincere will to do so. As I said earlier, one has only to get a green signal from the Swamiji to go ahead with the discussions om the issue afresh.  

  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
