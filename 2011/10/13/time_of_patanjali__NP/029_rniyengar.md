Thanks to Prof.Deshpande for commenting on my post and for further elucidating the commentary on Gururatnamālā by Ātmabodha. Thanks to Sri Shankara for providing the original text of the *Pañcaprakaraṇī*. My interest is about the Greek names mentioned by both the author and the commentator. Sadāśivabrahmendra, I believe is same as the famous music composer (the immortal *mānasa sañcara re; bhajare gopālam* etc). He mentions in verse 10 (p20) the name of Apollonius only. However the commentator quite correctly knows the names of Prāvṛti the Śaka king and Dāmis (the Assyrian) who accompanied Apollonius to Takṣaśila. The commentator Ātmabodha on p.89 of the above book gives the date of his commentary as *netrābdhirasacandreṣu yātsu śāliśakeṣu*.

This, if I am correct, corresponds to \~ 1720 AD. It follows both the author (c1600) and the commentator knew about the visit of Apollonius to India. Some reliable details of this should have been available to them. I wonder what could have been these indigenous historical literary sources for this tradition which was carried on for nearly 1700 years ?

I looked into the *Patañjalicaritam* cited by M.Hiriyanna, which I guess should be later than the above works. I could not locate any reference to the Greeks. Scholars may like to comment.
