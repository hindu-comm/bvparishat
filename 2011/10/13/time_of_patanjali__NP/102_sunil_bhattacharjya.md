Daer Ajitji,  
  

Just a correction. I never said that Prof. Achar's paper is the sole remedy. There are a host of other remedies too in the form of the supporting evidences in the historical texts, for one who may doubt the astronomical evidences. I agree with you that we are drifting away from the main topic of the thread, i.e., the dating of Patanjali, as Adi Shankara's date is only one of the steps towards looking at the date of Patanjali. As you suggested that we should wait till we hear from Vidyashankarji after his December visit, let us write no more on the dating of Adi Shankara, in this thread.  
  

Regards,
