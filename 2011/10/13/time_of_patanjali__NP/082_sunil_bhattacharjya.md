Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

It is nice that you are going to meet the people, who matter, personally as the case is a very sensitive one. I feel that all the important people associated with the different Shankara-maths are really very sincere and open-minded people. I had been to Shringeri in the late 1980s and unfortunately for me the His Holiness.Swamiji was away from Shringeri at that time. I also went to Kudali-Shringeri math and I was fortunate that the His Holiness there was kind to give me an audience. I visited the Dwarka math also and found the people there very helpful. The Kanchi Kamakoti math too has been very helpful through my contact in Mumbai, who is close to the math. So far I have not had any access to the Puri math. I feel it will be great if all the well-meaning people of these maths can come together on this issue. I am with you on this and kindly feel free to tell me if can be of any help in this good effort of yours.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
