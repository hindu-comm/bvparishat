Dear Bijoy Misra,

  I appreciate that you don't like the word "inspiration". Perhaps, you can translate the phrase "**adhigamya maheśvarāt**" in verse "yenākṣarasamāmnāyam adhigamya maheśvarāt / kṛtsnaṃ vyākaraṇam proktam, tasmai pāṇinaye namaḥ" with some other word of your choice, rather than inspiration. The point of the paper is that the assertion that Pāṇini "received" \[**adhigamya**\] his grammar from Śiva was historically relatively late, first appearing only in the Padamañjarī of Haradatta, and that this assertion was not the only such assertion, as the Buddhists asserted a different claim at an earlier time. This article was aimed at tracing the history of such assertions regarding Pāṇini, and not to discuss the grammatical function of the Śivasūtras. I have done that elsewhere.

  If you are looking for the function of the Śivasūtras, Prof. Kannan has already pointed to several studies of the Śivasūtras. The most extensive of such studies is the Ph.D. dissertation of Wiebke Petersen, but it is in German \[Zur Minimalit¨at von Pāṇinis Śivasūtras , Eine Untersuchung mit Methoden der Formalen Begriffsanalyse\], and if you are interested, I can send you a pdf of this dissertation.
