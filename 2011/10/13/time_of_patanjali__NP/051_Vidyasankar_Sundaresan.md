Dear Prof. Deshpande,

The general tradition about govinda bhagavatpAda in all the known Sankaravijaya texts is that he was an avatAra of patanjali. Or that he was an avatAra of AdiSesha, and that patanjali was an earlier avatAra of AdiSesha too. In some of these texts, the emphasis in the description is on patanjali as the yogasUtrakAra. In others, it is the vyAkaraNa mahAbhAshyakAra. Of course, none of the texts refer only to yoga to the exclusion of vyAkaraNa or vice versa.

Giving a specific name candragupta as the birth name of govinda bhagavatpAda is unique to the patanjalicarita. I haven't seen such a reference in any of the other texts that set out to describe the life of Sankara. And this candragupta of the patanjalicarita gets transformed to candraSarman at a later time. Then again, the references to gauDapAda, govinda and Sankara are all found only in the final, eighth chapter of that kAvya. The first seven chapters have no place for these advaita vedAnta teachers. I, for one, find that transition rather odd and abrupt, and the possible equation of this candragupta/SarmA with candrAcArya of vyAkaraNa as well as with govinda bhagavat of advaita seems rather forced.

One can conjecture various reasons for how these identifications and transformations came to be, but I'd rather not get into the details of my own thoughts about it at this time, on this forum. I've already said much in the past, on other forums.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
