Namaste,  
  

The issue is more complicated than this. There is another math called the Kudali Shringei math, located on the bank of the river at the confluence of Tunga and Bhadra, whereafter the river is known as Tungabhadra. There is reference to the Sharada temple at this palce, referred in the Sharada Bhujanga Prayata Stotram as follows:  

    Kadakshe dayardhraam, kare gnana mudhraam,
    Kalabhir vinidhram, kalapai subhadhraam,
    Purasthreem vinidhraam, pura sthunga bhadram,
    Bhaje Saradambhaam ajasram madhambham., 2

This Kudali-Shringeri math is situated at a distance of about 12 KM from the Shimoga town, the head-quarters of the Shimoga district, in Karnataka  This math claims itself to be the original Shringeri math and the Kanchi math too recognizes this math's guruparampara, going back to the 5th century BCE. It is interesting to note that the Sringeri math and the Kudali Shringeri math both have the Vidyashankara temple at their premises and both the maths claim Vidyashanka Tirtha to be a mathadhipati in their maths at contemporary times. This also seems to indicate the age-old relationship between these two maths. One may consider this as an added point while looking at the date Adi Shankara.  
  

Further, it is interesting to note that a scholar, named Udaivira Shastri wrote a book on the date of Shankara in Hindi and someone translated that to English, and in that book late Udaivira Shastri seems to suggest a link between the Shringeri math and the Kanchi math around the 9th century CE, based on the guruparamparas of both the maths.  
  

There has also been claim about possible loss of records when the Shringeri temples were damaged during Hyder Ali's campaigns (which later on Tipu Sultan agreed to make amends for that) as well as during the Maratha campaign in 1791 CE, when Shringeri was looted. It was first suspected that the Pindaris were responsible for that as they used to follow the north-Indian campaigns of the Maratha armies, around those times. Upon Peshwa's instruction Raghunath Rao, a commander, carried out an investigation of the possible looting by the Pindaris and he found that the Pindaris did not loot Shringeri. The looting of Shringeri appeared to be by another robber group, over which the Marathas had no control. Greatly disturbed by the loot, the Mathadhipati of Shringeri, Shri Sacchidananda Bharati III left for Poona (Satara?) to seek redressal of what happened in the loot. Peshwa Bajirao II, a Brahmin, gave great respect to the Swamiji and eventually became his disciple. Tipu Sultan also wrote to Swamiji condemning the looting of Shringeri. It is quite possible that during the robbery in Shringeri, many of the valuable records of the past could have been lost. Fortunately the Swamiji could save some records at the time of his departure from Sringeri to Poona (Satara?). In early 20th century CE the mathadhipati of Shringeri disclosed a record, according to which Adi Shankara was born in the 14th year of the rule of king Vikramaditya. Generally people think that the earliest Vikramaditya was he, who started the Vikrama samvat in 57 BCE. However there was another Vikramaditya also before that, as Rajatarangini informs us.  
  
If all the mathas come together and earnestly try to look for the real date of Adi Shankara afresh, that too using the historical information combined with calendrical and astronomical studies, and not depending on the hagiographical details alone, it is quite possible that we myy arrive at the true date pf Adi Shankara. I feel that it is also worth considering the astronomical studies of Prof. Narahari Achar from the Memphis University on the date of Adi Shankara.
