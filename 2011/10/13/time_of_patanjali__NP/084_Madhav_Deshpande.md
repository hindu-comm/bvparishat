Dear Vidyasankar,

  

  I mostly agree with you that talking to Mathadhipatis will not help those who are interested in history. However, for me, induction of Patañjali as Śeṣāvatāra into the Chidambaram complex needs deeper investigation. Kaiyaṭa, from Kashmir, calls Patañjali by the term Nāganātha, and hence is aware of Patañjali's identification with Śeṣa, and yet he does not seem to be aware of the Prātyāhārasūtras as Śivasūtras. This suggests to me that these connections are developing separately in different regions, and then coming together in the traditions related to Chidambaram, the dance of Naṭarāja being attended by Patañjali, and also Pāṇini receiving the Śivasūtras from the Drum sounds of Śiva, as narrated by Nandikeśvara in his Kārikās. While none of this has any real relation to Grammar as a discipline, the development of these associations is fascinating in itself, and as such deserves a deeper study, which probably requires a deeper study of earlier Tamil texts and inscriptions associated with Chidambaram.
