Thanks Shankara-ji for this pdf of the works of Sadāḍiva-Brahmendra.
The pp 20-21 provide a Sanskrit commentary on the verse cited and discussed by Hiriyanna. The commentary tells the story of Gauḍapāda being a disciple of Patañjali in his prior birth, and eventually studying the Mahābhāṣya with Candraśarman, who has some connection with the Buddhist tradition, including some Greeks who had become Buddhists.
This Candraśarman is the Candrācārya referred to by Bhartṛhari as someone who recovered/reinstituted the tradition of studying the Mahābhāṣya in the region of Kashmir. An interesting mixed account of history of the revival of Mahābhāṣya studies by Candrācārya and myth of the prior birth of Gauḍapāda as a direct student of Patañjali. Ashok Aklujar may have something interesting to say about this.
