Sorry for the multiple posts, but I just wanted to point out that even an identification of the candragupta of the patanjalicarita with the candrAcArya remembered within the vyAkaraNa tradition is not made by Ramabhadra Dikshita, the author of the poem. These kinds of equations can only be made by adopting a very literal and chronological historical attitude towards the poetic imagination of Ramabhadra and his largely ahistorical kAvya. And of course, there is no candraSarmA in his kAvya either.

sushamA and the gururatnamAlA are a different matter, because they claim to provide chronological details, but reveal themselves as being more or less fanciful accounts, which cannot be substantiated even for relatively recent historical times, let alone for one or two thousand years ago.

Overall, my conclusion is that when Keith doubted the antecedents of a Sanskrit verse referring to Apollonius and Iarches, he had really very good reasons for doing so! Even TMP Mahadevan, in his slim monograph on gauDapAda, finds it necessary to cast doubt upon the authorship and time of composition of the gururatnamAlA and sushamA.

Best regards,
