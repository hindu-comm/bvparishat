dear shrisha rao,

happy deepavali greetings to you and all the members of this parishad.

  

"The Age of Patanjali"by N. Bhashyacharya,Published in 1915,Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar, Chennai \[Madras\] India

The Theosophist Office, Adyar, Madras. India, available in following link

with all of its clearcutstatements(hitopadeshas for western professors)
is still relevant in this time also.

  

**it is time that we come out of old ideas which were conceived at the height of british empire.** even Ramavatar sharma is more glaring example of how these indian pandits were super awed by mighty british power in 1905.
