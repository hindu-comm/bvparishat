Namaste Madhavji,  
  

Thank you for attaching the paper "INTERPRETING VAKYAPADIA 2.486 HISTORICALLY (PART 2)", where Prof. Aklujkar has tried to give a good historical picture of the time of Chandracharya. The scholars here may consider it an impertinence on my part for trying to put up a historical view, alternative to what is given by the great scholar Prof. Aklujkar. If that is so, I request you all be kind to excuse me and I imploringly lay for your kind attention, the following few lines, where I see a different time-period for Chandracharya, who visited Kashmir, during the rule of king Abhimanyu.  
  

The great French scholar M.A.Troyer, who was the Principal of the Calcutta Sanskrit College, had studied the Rajatarangini well and he showed that Abhimanyu ruled Kashmir till 1182 BCE and after him the next king was Gonanda-III, who ruled Kashmir from 1182 BCE to 1147 BCE, when Vibhisana succeeded him. Vibhisana ruled upto 1093 BCE and he was succeeded by Indrajit, who ruled upto 1058 BCE, when Ravana succeeded him as the king of Kashmir.  
  

Secondly, to my understanding the Sri Parvata to be in Himalyan region, probably now in Nepal and the Gupta of the Gupta dynasty are said to be from the Sri Parvata. If the list thinks that more discussion can continue, we may have to open a new thread on this topic.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
