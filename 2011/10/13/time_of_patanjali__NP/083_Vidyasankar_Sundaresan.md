Dear Sunilji,

  

Actually, things that seem like big deals to others outside, do not seem like big issues to those in the various Mathas. And vice versa.

  

For example, even with respect to the date of Adi Sankara, they don't mind saying "vayaM mathabhedinaH" and moving on to address practical matters. This happened in writing, back in 1993, a few months after a mosque was torn down in Ayodhya. This attitude seems incomprehensible to those who get agitated about whether Sankara's life was before Christ or after. On the other hand, most Hindus today can't seem to understand why the Dwaraka Sankaracharya is so vocally against building temples around a garbhagRha hosting a marble vigraha of Shirdi Sai Baba at its center.

  

As for a consolidated/reconciled history of the major Sankara Peethas, I am convinced that such a project is impossible, so long as people are not prepared to put on very critical hats when evaluating various legends, traditions, claims and counter-claims. And there needs to be sound research methodology too, drawing not only on textual sources, but also things like field studies in the sociological and anthropological disciplines, keeping an eye on history and historiography. Merely meeting various contemporary Mathadhipatis in person is not going to help such a project move further along. Now, if one's objective is to offer personal namaskaras and bhikshA to different sannyasis, that is a completely different goal, praiseworthy in its own right, but it won't necessarily add value to the research effort that is needed.

  

In any case, for purposes of academic questions about Patanjali, I think there needs to be a decoupling of the vyAkaraNa-vaiyAkaraNa sources from the confusing landscape of traditions about SankarAcArya and the various contemporary guru paramparA lineages. To me, it seems like an unnecessary complication that cannot be sorted out to anybody's satisfaction, unless those who are interested in Patanjali spend a lot of time and effort researching the histories and traditions of the advaita maThas instead!  

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
