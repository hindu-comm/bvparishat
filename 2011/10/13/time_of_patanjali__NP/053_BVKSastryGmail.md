Namaste



May be I am raising a side tracking issue on this debate \< Time of Patanjali> which has touched the relation of \< Vyakarana- Schoalrship \> and \< Advaita –Philsophy \> :: Language Grammar and Mystic -Philosophy – transcending the nameability and describability of an entity :: Avaachyataa – Anirvacahneeya – Naama Roopa ateeta \>.



These two ‘side-questions’ are triggered by the note by Professor Deshpande \< but seem to suggest to me likely avenues of future research \> where a clarity needs to emerge on direction to engage eastern and western linguistic study in the domains of **Rules of Language usage and Application, distinguished from the ‘ Advanced discourse on Philosophy of Language, leading to language bind and boundary Transcendence ( = A – nirvachaneeyataa) ’** ; more so in the context of ‘Samskrutham’.





**Side questions -1** : ( On Prof: Madhav DeshPande: , the belief within the Advaitic tradition that Gauḍapāda and Candraśarmā alias Govindabhagavatpāda were somehow related to the revival of Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya is an important indicator of the value placed on the Mahābhāṣya within the Advaitic tradition.) 



 **Vyakarana-Shaastra, as Vedanga**, **is a unified grammar approach to understand the sacred spiritual linguistics ( Language Focus - Primary) of languages present in two major classes of
works, namely Veda-Shaastra and Kaavya-Shaastra. Vedanga Vyakarana is
presenting a Unified Document and Approach for Learning Language -Tradition of Chandas and Bhashaa , for Spiritual and Sacrificial
usage ( Adhyatma = Brahma Chintana and Adhi-Yajna = Karma –Yajna Chintana ) . **

****

**** The plan in Vyakarana, seems to be, to work around
and present a means to understand words already in – use in the texts of tradition; and further generate as needed proper word-designators
for a contextual application. ( Vibhaktim kurvanti) . It is generating a ‘Naama as Shabda /Pada for use in a Vaakya’ for ‘ Yaajnika Tradition usage’. It is to connect pada with artha: ‘Roopa ( Aakruti-Kriyaa- Jaati-Samjnaa / Phala )’ – Truly and Totally through a ‘Yoga’ ( = unifying) process for a purpose. 



 The entire mechanics is one of ‘Shabda –Nirmiti’ – Art of Word-Architecture, Word-Sculpting (Shabda-Shilpa) for a purpose (Viniyoga).



 The audit of ‘Saadhutva –Shishta Sampradaaya’ is a standard of Samskruth Grammarians. The philosophy of Grammar marks the boundary on working with ‘What falls within the realm of Vaak’ and What falls beyond the realm of ‘Vaak’; the clarity of distinction between **Vachaneeyataa** \< Expression – Articulation - Naming – Designation \> and **Anirvachaneeyataa** -Transcendence.



 **(Advaita) Darshana Shaastra –as Vedanta, is a specific flavor of understanding the essence of three works presenting three paths in two language modes for a unified goal ( = Pra-Sthana- Traya : uses Language modes of (Chandas and Bhashaa) . This is** transcending
the ‘Vedanga’ boundary to explore ‘ What falls beyond the realm of Vaak’. Such unified construction of a philosophy from a meta-physical document using meta-language needs appropriate skills of grammar-tradition as ‘Vedanga’ .



 ‘Vedanga’ understands world-languages/ Human Social languages in a specific context and paradigm : Daivee and Maanushee . ( Daiveem vaacham ajanayanta devaah ; taam Vishva-roopaah pashavao vadanti). Here ‘Deva is Not ‘God’ and certainly not ‘God in Abrahamic theology and scriptures ; pashu is not animal. The four fold-layered structure of such language is presented and fourth phase of it is called ‘Human usage language’ (Tureeyam Vaachah). Spirituality (Adhyaatma) is an integral part of this language – discussion. The primary units of language (Varna-Akshara / Naada) are deeply connected with ‘Brahma’ – the ultimate unique postulate of Vednata. ( Gita 3-15: karma brahmodbhavam viddhi *brahmakshara*-*samudbhavam* tasmat sarva-gatam brahma nityam yajne pratisthitam.) The premise in ‘Vednaga –Bhashaa Chintana’ is built around the anchor of upanishad : Yato Vaacho nivartante, apraapya manasaa saha , tadeva Brahma tvam viddhi , nedam yat –idam – upAsate’ . This is the ‘ Mantra –Practice Instruction. If some thing is not nameable, but still can be sensed and engaged ( Asti – BhAti , Jaanaami tam eva/ evam anu-bhAntam) as real personal experience which is NOT an illusion or hallucination , experienced as ‘Sat- Cht- Aanadna’ in a ‘ Time –Transcendent and Time-Permeating ( Kalaateeta – Sarva-Kaalika) , how does one write a ‘Shaastra’ of such a
‘Darshana’ ? How does one teach it ? How does one debate it ? Using what means ? A challenge of explaining and expressing ‘meta-language’ in social language idiom ?



 This ‘paradigm of language of Shaastra ’ is totally outside the boxed thinking of ‘Academic Linguistics/ Applied Linguistics ’ used in ‘ Indology. The scope of definition used in these
modern disciplines would be called ‘ Saamaajika Vyaavaharika –Prakrutha / Mlecchita Bhashaa, Jaati-Bhashaa / Desha -bhashaa’ in the parlance of Samskruth traditional studies.



 In this context, a thorough knowledge of ‘Shada-Shaastra’ (Patanajli Vyakarana ) and ‘Shaastra –Bhashaa’ and ‘Yoga-Bhashaa’ may have been considered a ‘ Pre-qualification’ for a student before admission to the further advanced instructions of ‘Shabda –Brahma –Darshana Shaastra where Vak-Yoga pedagogy and methodology ’ is needed. This is Yoga way of studying Samskrutham beyond ‘ using Bhashaa aspect of Samskrutham for localized contextualized conversation ( = Sambhaashnam). It is clarity in the use of language for a social purpose for conversation and a Spiritual exploration of ‘ Communion/ Union/ Yoga as Mantra-Brahmana). This line of argument and debate-discourse is a part of the discussion and objections made on ‘Advaita’ in many ‘Vaadas’ addressing the word ‘Brahma-Anirvachaneeya’ part of commentary and attacking ‘Maayaa –Tatva’ as ‘ illusion’. In reality it is ‘ Shabda-vichara –charchaa’ and not ‘Shabda-Brahma- Jijnyasa’. 



** Then, in this context, would it be right for me to infer the statement in Shankara vijaya as a recollection of the traditional standard : Knowledge of Vedanga-Vyakarana is a pre-qualification before entering the portals of Vedanta** ; Patanjali connection to Advaita Guru-Shishya Sampradaya ? The question by Guru of Shankara seems to seek an assurance that the seeker had a clear understanding of the ‘Shabda –Shaastra’ prerequisites before learning ‘Shabda-Brahma Tattva –Darshana’ practice ?



 As far as I am aware, within Shankara sampradaya, the insistence on ‘Sarva- Shaastra –Abhyasa’ before ‘ Sannyasa –Deekshaa’ is insisted upon. This is to ensure sufficient physical, mental, social and practice-based maturity before treading the path for a ‘ position of Spiritual leadership = Sannyasa Deekshaa ’. To understand ‘Acharya Shankaras message in Bhaja Govindam’, to know the last stop of ‘ Dukrunj - Karane’ , one needs to have a full engagement with Vyakarana which teaches what all needs to transform ‘Du-Krunj Karane’ to ‘ karomi’ in Samkalpa and ‘Arjunas commitment of ‘Karishye Vachanam Tava ’ to Sri Krishna . The wisdom of Bhagavatpada in Bhaja –Govindam is not to reject Vyakarana without full engagement with it.







**Side questions -2** : On \< web site statement related :
Śaṅkaravijayas describe this connection of these two Ācāryas to the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali? > 



The works like Shankara Vijaya have an unspecified mix of history and faith; and aim to endorse a ‘ faith tradition continuity’ beyond a desire of functioning like ‘Shaastra –Itihasasa – PramaNa- grantha’.



 How right are we in contemplating ‘ Advaita Tradition-Shankara history- bridges’ using such works ? The tracing of \< belief continuity part> needs to have additional support from \< Shaastra- Paramparaa and Scrutiny of the person chosen for continuity of succession to the tradition>.



 I do understand that this is a slippery and socially sensitive issue for open debate, arising out of the link between \< Advaita and
Samkrutha- Vyakarana –Patanjali Standards \> .

 I will raise the question and leave it at that ( for private communications) . The question, for all ‘Vedanta Sampradaya instituitions would be this : 



Do we see foot-prints of ‘Shakara Vijaya Sampradaya’ reflected in Practice footprints as the guidelines and Standards adapted in
‘grooming and selecting the succession candidate ‘ Shihsya ’ by ‘ current holding - guru-peetha-adhipati’ to carry on the torch-light of tradition ? In the current period, which ‘Guru-Kul’ is providing the relevant training for grooming a ‘ Peetha-adhi-pati and a Sannyasi’? A Saffron – Robed Person for spreading the message anchored to ‘ Vyasa- Granthaavali’ in Samskrutham ? Will the ‘Sarvajna-Peetham’ occupation
be decided by selection or election or invitation ? How True and Truant are the practices in various Vyasa - Sampradaya institutions in grooming their successors for ‘ Yati-Dharma / Shaastra sampradaaya rakshaa’ and ‘ Moksha -Sannyasa Yoga’ responsibilities in line with
last chapter of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita ? Do we have a 21^(st) century community – in India or abroad who love to have such ‘ Personnel’ in our times ? What needs to be done – ***Kim Karaneeyam ? ***

Dear Sunilji and Surendraji,



On the website \[<http://www.kamakoti.org/peeth/origin.html>\], I find the following statement in relation to Govinda Bhagavatpāda and Gauḍapāda. 



"The yogi, Sri Govinda Bhagavatpada, recipient of the Mahabhashya from the lips of Sri Gaudapada, asked from within the cave, who was standing near the cave."



Do the various Śaṅkaravijayas describe this connection of these two Ācāryas to the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali? Being away from my home library, I cannot check the texts of the Śaṅkaravijayas. This connection or at least a belief in this connection of the Advaitic teachers before Śaṅkara to the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali seems most interesting to me.

Dear Sunilji and Surendraji,



  Thank you very much for your useful suggestions. The notion that Candraśarmā was the pūrvāśrama name of Govindabhagavatpāda is something new to me, and reference to him by the Paramacharya of Kanchi is also interesting. I wonder if either of you can give me some bibliographic information for these references. It is very likely that the references to Candraśarmā in the commentary on the Gururatnamālā has some traditional sources. Whether this reference to Candraśarmā is a conflation with the Candrācārya referred to by Bhartṛhari as being responsible for the revival of the Mahābhāṣya is a different question.
In any case, the belief within the Advaitic tradition that Gauḍapāda and Candraśarmā alias Govindabhagavatpāda were somehow related to the revival of Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya is an important indicator of the value placed on the Mahābhāṣya within the Advaitic tradition. This may also be an indirect way of distancing from the Śabdādvaita of Bhartṛhari (rejected by Śaṅkara), but claiming the Mahābhāṣya itself to be within the Advaitic lineage. These are just my speculations, but seem to suggest to me likely avenues of future research.
