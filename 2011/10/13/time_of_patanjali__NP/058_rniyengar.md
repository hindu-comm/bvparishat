Dear Vidyashankar,

After reading your well researched and carefully argued article on Śankaravijaya texts, I can only exclaim, confusion confounded! You are not partial to either party, but you have presented data with eye on details. I was aware of the controversies, but not of the broad picture and its possible influence on Indian traditions. Rāmānujācārya (1017-1137 CE, luckily no controversy about this figure) is also considered to be the incarnation of Ādiśeṣa and in fact his given name was Lakṣmaṇa. You may know that there is a temple at Thondnur near Melkote where a relief shows the Ācārya as Ādiśeṣa sitting behind a screen answering his numerous opponents (Jains?) simultaneously. When I read the Patañjali-carita, which belongs to a later date, I could not miss this parallelism. I had not known till I read your paper that there is a Sanskrit work that holds all the three ācāryas to have been contemporaries! Ignoring all such fanciful stories, still I wonder why the Kāñci maṭha (even if called Kumbhakoṇam) *parampara* is longer than that of Sṛṅgeri? My interest is more in the ancient (BCE-CE) transition period, rather than in the recent past, even though chronology sequencing may be rather hazy. Without going into the various conflicting claims; Śankarācārya having established a monastery at Kāñci and attaining *Mukti* there sounds realistic. In the 7-8^(th) Cent Kāñci was at its peak in many fronts. It was the border town between the Sanskritic and the Tamil cultural traditions. Buddhists and Jains had strong roots at Kāñci from c 400 BCE contemporaneous with Vedic/Vedāntic schools, if not earlier. Now coming back to the historical claims of K-Maṭha going back to 482BCE and that of Śṛ-Maṭha reaching only 820 AD as shown on their respective web sites, one needs to ponder whether both can be reconciled, instead of brushing aside one in preference to the other. Since Śankarācārya’s date is 8-9^(th) Cent, Kāñci monastic order must have had some strong reason to trace its origin to BCE period. Is it probable an already existing monastery (Vedic/Bauddha) was brought into the Advaitic fold in the above period? This is of course a speculation, but from available evidences can such a possibility be denied?

I have read in some history books that Patanjali in his Mahābhāṣya refers to *Kāñcipuraka* to mean a person from that city. Also he seems to have remarked that southerners are fond of *Taddhita* words even when not necessary (*I am no scholar of Pāṇini and Patanjali. I apologise for any mistaken information and request BVP scholars for corrections*). If legends are a way to keep traditions alive (matter of fact history is quickly forgotten!) it seems quite reasonable for the grammar tradition to have reflected back from south to north. Since there does not seem to be any academic necessity for the Kāñci Vedānta school to trace its relation to Patanjali, some real cultural links might be hidden in fossilised fashion.

Two minor points: a) Gupta may not be a definitive marker of caste. Chāṇakya/Kauṭalya was known as Viṣṇugupta although he was a Brahmin. b) The royal emblem of Mysore Wodeyars was/is the double headed eagle and not the boar.

Best regards

RN Iyengar
