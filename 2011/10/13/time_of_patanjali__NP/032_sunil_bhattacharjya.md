Apollonius of Tanya trevelled through the Parthian territory to Takshila for education. He later on took the name St Paul on return. (Now please check this point)  

  

This an absurd proposition. Apollonius of Tanya could have been Jesus Christ himself, but St. Paul could never have been Jesus Christ, simply because St. Paul was at one time against Jesus Christ's teachings. If you are interested in more discussion on it, that can be started under a separate thread.  
  

Sincerely,  

skb
