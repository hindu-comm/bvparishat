Dear Sunilji and Surendraji,



On the website \[<http://www.kamakoti.org/peeth/origin.html>\], I find the following statement in relation to Govinda Bhagavatpāda and Gauḍapāda. 



"The yogi, Sri Govinda Bhagavatpada, recipient of the Mahabhashya from the lips of Sri Gaudapada, asked from within the cave, who was standing near the cave."



Do the various Śaṅkaravijayas describe this connection of these two Ācāryas to the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali? Being away from my home library, I cannot check the texts of the Śaṅkaravijayas. This connection or at least a belief in this connection of the Advaitic teachers before Śaṅkara to the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali seems most interesting to me.

Dear Sunilji and Surendraji,



  Thank you very much for your useful suggestions. The notion that Candraśarmā was the pūrvāśrama name of Govindabhagavatpāda is something new to me, and reference to him by the Paramacharya of Kanchi is also interesting. I wonder if either of you can give me some bibliographic information for these references. It is very likely that the references to Candraśarmā in the commentary on the Gururatnamālā has some traditional sources. Whether this reference to Candraśarmā is a conflation with the Candrācārya referred to by Bhartṛhari as being responsible for the revival of the Mahābhāṣya is a different question.
In any case, the belief within the Advaitic tradition that Gauḍapāda and Candraśarmā alias Govindabhagavatpāda were somehow related to the revival of Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya is an important indicator of the value placed on the Mahābhāṣya within the Advaitic tradition. This may also be an indirect way of distancing from the Śabdādvaita of Bhartṛhari (rejected by Śaṅkara), but claiming the Mahābhāṣya itself to be within the Advaitic lineage. These are just my speculations, but seem to suggest to me likely avenues of future research.
