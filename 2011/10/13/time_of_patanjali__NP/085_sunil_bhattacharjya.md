Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

May be I misunderstood your mail and thought that in December you are going to contact the concerned persons in some maths with some of the historical questions relevant to the the date of Adi Shankara..  
  

As regards the stand of the Dwarka swami on the issue concerning the puja of Sai Baba, I think I can understand his view. Sai Baba is not the same as the hindu deities and he should not be worshipped the way the other deities are worshipped, according to the age-old vidhis. Dwarka Swami does not have objection to people paying respects to Sai Baba, like we pay respects to the holy persons such as Adi Shankara, Madhvacharya or Ramakrisjna Paramhansa  
  

One Pathak wrote a paper proposing that the year of birth of a Shankaracharya to be 788 CE, based on some documents from a particular math. Pathak had also given the name of the parents of that Shankaracharya. The date of Adi Shankara cannot be found from that information as Adi Shankara was neither born in Chidambaram nor his parents were the same as that of the Shanlaracharya as mentioned by Pathak. Moreover the year 788 is not a Nandana year, where Adi Shankara was known to have been born nor any Vikramaditya reigned from 788 -13 = 775 CE. This is just to give an example. There are many such leads, which can be studied objectively without blaming any of the other maths.  
  

If you are keen (and only if you are keen) on looking at the date of Adi Shankara afresh, as related to the Shringeri math and hopefully there will be many other people like me, so that we can try to have a fresh look at that issue, but I feel that this has to be with the blessings of H.H.Swamiji of Shringeri.  
  

Adi Shankara's date is a historical landmark and that, to my mind, that should help us in ascertaining the date of Bhartrihari (even if not absolutely correctly) and this will also be helpful towards dating Patanjali and other such ancient personalities.  
  

Regards,
