Dear Profs Deshpande and Iyengar,

  

The said gururatnamAlA attributed to sadASiva brahmendra and its commentary (sushamA) by one Atmabodhendra need careful scrutiny in light of the well-documented history of the 17th-18th centuries and also with respect to the political relationships prevailing among the south Indian maTha-s of the advaita tradition in the 19th and 20th centuries. The purported date of composition of the commentary (1720) is untenable, raising serious questions about the date and authorship of its source text too. The historical sadASiva brahmendra must have himself been a young or middle-aged man in 1720, whereas the commentary claims to be a century or more later than its source text. Supposedly historical and geographical details given in these texts should be viewed with a critical eye. I will refrain from saying much more in public on this forum, because I don't want to be an indirect cause of getting sidetracked from discussing the time of patanjali to the date and history of Sankara, along with some highly politicized issues from recent times.

  

As for textual sources, at this juncture, I'd merely like to point out that Ramabhadra Dikshita's poem, the Patanjalicarita, does not give the name of the grammarian candrAcArya as candraSarmA but as candragupta. As you all know, -gupta is not a brAhmaNa moniker, unlike -SarmA. As far as I've been able to make out, the transformation of this candra- from the -gupta of the Patanjalicarita to the -SarmA of the gururatnamAlA commentary must have happened in the 19th/20th centuries, in Kumbhakonam or Kanchipuram, in response to the many criticisms raised within the advaita sannyAsi tradition over these texts and its publishers.

  

With warm regards,

Vidyasankar

  

ps. Please do see my paper in IJHS (2000) on the Sankaravijaya texts, which expands upon these issues in quite some detail.
