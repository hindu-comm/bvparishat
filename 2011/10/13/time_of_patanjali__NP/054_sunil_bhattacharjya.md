Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

If you are referring to the Kavyamala edition of the book can you kindly mention the Sarga and the Verse-number on which Govidapada has been mentioned as Chandragupa ?  

  
As Govindapada was a brahmin I wonder how can there be any attachment of " -Gupta" to his name. Is it possible that some transcriber could have tried to change "Sarma" to "Gupta" ?  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
