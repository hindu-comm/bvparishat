In continuation of Professor Iyengar's comments, I am curious as to what might have been the Indic sources for the continued awareness of the various Greek thinkers who played some role in Indian philosophical traditions, and why the Advaitins of a reasonably late period felt the need to mention them. Clearly, by the time these late Advaitic works were composed, Buddhism had practically disappeared from India, leaving only faint memories of their philosophical views. Yet the converted Buddhist Greek thinkers remained in the memories till such a late period. There has to be a better explanation for this phenomenon.
