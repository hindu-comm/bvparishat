Gautama also in his "patati-patita-patitavya..."etc. sUtra anticipates such a position which may not be exactly Buddhist.But many such ideas were already there as are also evident in many upanishadic passages.The NyAyasUtra-s may be pre-Buddhist as is mostly believed.To accept Patanjali as pre-Buddhist is difficult.But then the K.sa.nabha.ngavaadin-s also do admit of a present time which is but momentary.Regards,smmishra
