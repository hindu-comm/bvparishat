Namaste,  
  

Kindly permit me to write a few lines on Lord Buddha's Nirvna. Both Rajatarangini and Puranic chronology say that Kanisha was living in the beginning of 13th century BCE and that is ably supported by the astronomical study of Prof. Narahari Achar. Puranic chronolgy and Prof. Achar's astronomical studies also support the date of Nirvana of Lord Buddha towards the end of 19th century. So there in no conflict of that with the date of Adi Shankara.  
  

Regards,
