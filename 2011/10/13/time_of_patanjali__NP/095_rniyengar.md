Dear Dr. Sundaresan,

  

Great. Your analytical skills (IIT+Caltech ?) show up. I wish our Universities encourage research methodology which questions every statement of history, both western and traditional, so that the cobwebs are cleared and layers of grease coatings are removed.The original mural will shine forth on its own in all its glory.

  

I look forward to talking in person later this year, when you visit Bangalore.

  

warm regards

  

RNI
