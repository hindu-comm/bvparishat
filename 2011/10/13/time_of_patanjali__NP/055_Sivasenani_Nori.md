In this context, the book Parmarthasara (<https://archive.org/details/AdisesaParamarthasara_201306>), an early manual of Advaita in Aryas, by Adisesha might be of some interest. Based on evidence within the text, some hold that this is later than Mandukyakarika. Nagesa quotes liberally from this work in Manjusha.

This fits in with a disciple of Gaudapada, an avatara of AdiSesha, teaching Advaita - though I never heard such a conjecture earlier (nor am I making one here - as I said, it might be of interest, that's all).
