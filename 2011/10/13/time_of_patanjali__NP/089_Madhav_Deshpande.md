Dear Prof. Iyengar,

  

  Thanks for your very useful suggestions, especially about the possibility of the Śiva Naṭarāja history going back to the earlier Pallava period at Kanchipuram. I am not much familiar with this history, and not knowing Tamil, I have some serious limitations. But will look into secondary publications on Nataraja and Kanchipuram.

  The Varṇapaṭala Pariśiṣṭa of the AV is indeed post-Pāṇinian. I have discussed this text in relation to Pāṇini and the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā (an AV Prātiśākhya) in my (824 pages long) edition of the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā with three commentaries, and translation (Harvard Oriental Series 1997). I had not noticed the reference to dīnāra in the Varṇapaṭala, but you are probably referring to the collection of the AV Pariśiṣṭas as a whole.

  In any case, I am fascinated by the transmission of texts in the wide Indian geography, and the development of religious associations with those texts.
