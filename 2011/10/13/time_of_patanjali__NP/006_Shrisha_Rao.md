My point in this regard was this: how would there be a situation where learning was so prevalent that the काठक and कालापक were taught in village after village in a significantly widespread area, as Patanjali says? Many people would hold that this is impossible, and some modern educational theorists would argue that it would be unrealizable unless a lot of "wired connectivity," computers, and other modern technologies were widespread, which of course was not the case in ancient India. Thus, such widespread learning is even less plausible than the existence of a true university like Nalanda with diverse faculties of study. Yet, we must acknowledge that the sheer volume and scope of our classical literature (across various fields/doctrines) entails the past existence of a system of learning that is beyond the scope of today's imagination.

\> is it possible in second century BC? how much time is needed for the loss of atleast nearly 19-20 of the rgvedic shakhas?

I don't know if an answer is possible to such a question. It may be too much to ask to calculate such precise historical details from mere linguistic analyses. (This is one of my difficulties with the recent fancy that academic Indology has had with philology.) It could however be said that the number of Vedic recensions was considerable even in relatively recent times (say the 16th or 17th centuries CE). The loss of the traditions has by no means been uniform, e.g., it appears that the SV traditions, at one time most numerous, were mostly lost first, and then the rest.

Besides, the very point that Patanjali is making in the context you cite, अप्रयुक्ते दीर्घसत्रवत्, is that one cannot dismiss words as unused (useless?), because there is a vast literature where they may have been used even if they do not appear to be in use currently. Thus Patanjali advises in the same context that we should make efforts to find out where such uncommon words have been used, and dismisses idle talk of words not being unused as साहसमात्र. From this it can certainly be inferred that Patanjali was in fact citing the \*classical\* counts of Vedic recensions, etc., rather than the sizes/counts of textual corpora that were in fact present before him at the time.

\> I think Patanjali never makes any reference to Buddhism. does he? if not he must be pre-buddha. may be around 1500- 1000 BC. (not sure of exact dates) if this is accepted as his time what is the difficulty in ग्रामे ग्रामे काठकं कालापकं च प्रोच्यते? it is quite acceptable that when there was no alternative religion in that part of india.

Not having competing religions around is hardly a guarantee in this regard. Such learning is not widespread even today in Islamic and other countries where there are no other religions, for instance; such societies are indeed mostly illiterate.

Information in early Buddhist works also does not suggest that there was a single religion around at the time of the Buddha. There are lists of dozens of doctrines given that were said to be prevalent at that time.
