Dear Vidyasankarji,

  
  

\<Indeed, as I mentioned in an earlier posting, 19th century publications of the Upanishad Brahmendra Matha state that theirs was the first advaita vedAnta institution in the city of Kanchipuram. I'll leave this matter at that.>  

  

This is the type of things that may help in finding out the original location of the Kanchi Kamakoti Matha. I am sure the Kanchi matha will also appreciate this sort pf investigation. Any idea where to get a copy of the 19th century publications of the Upanishad Brahmendra Matha ?  
  

What I can find is that Upanishad Brahmendra himself was initiated into sannyasa by a guru named Vasudevendra Saraswati in Kanchipuram. That could mean that there was an earlier matha in Kanchipuram.  
  

Regards,
