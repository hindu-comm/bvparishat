Dear Shri Jaya Prakash,

  

  Thanks for posting the pdf of this article on Patanjali by Probhatchandra Chakravarti. It appears to be a chapter in a book. By any chance, do you have any bibliographic information regarding the volume (Title, editor, publisher, date of publication), so that it would be easier to cite a full reference for this wonderful article. Best,
