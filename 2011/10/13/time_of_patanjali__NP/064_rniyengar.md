Dear Professor Deshpande,

Thanks for your M. Bhāṣya references. Please provide a link to your work on..." ...southern tradition" that you mention.  AboutKātyāyana perhaps there was more than one person by that name. Atharva veda Paris'is.t.a in the very first chapter (1.3.1) Nakshatrakalpa identifies or correlates: ... कात्यायनौ आश्वयुजौ.... Patañjali perhaps holds a lot about history of his time as you have pointed out aboutPuṣyamitra. In a paper on YugapuraaNa D.C.Sircar has pointed out Patañjali mentioning the attack of Yavanas (Greeks) on Sāketa. Hefurther interprets the word Dharmamita in YP to be the Sanskritized name of "Demetrius" a Greek who might have been the person leading the attacking.Is there any serious study or monograph onIndia at the time of Patanjali(similar to the work of VS Agrawala on Panini). If so please provide some information.
