Sir

  

One thing which was always surprising to me was that the five main prayojanas and the thirteen aanushangika prayojanas are totally related to the Vedas - as if non-Vedic people do not count, or *as if they did not exist*!

  

Other comments also indicate the prevalent thought that only the sanaatanadharmis matter. For instance: "One has to study vyakarana without any expecting any thing - nishkaaraNam - just like one studies the Vedas" (in the Paspasahnikam); or "Ashtadhyayi is useful to identify SishTas (that is Brahmins who are kumbhidhanyas, alolupas etc.)." (Bhashya on the sutra 'prishodaraadini yathopadishTam').

  

If we take all this as an attempt to establish this as a Vedanga, one should note that Yaska's Nirukta is earlier than Mahabhashya (based on internal references) and by the time of Nirukta itself, angas have been established. Even the quoted passage refers to angas with a clear assumption that Vyakarana is one of them. So there was no need to establish the Vedangatvam of Panini's text or Mahabhashyakara's commentary.

  

Finally, if Panini was around 400 BC, does that give enough time for a large Sangraha by Vyadi and multiple vartikakaras, and then a Mahabhashya by 150-200 BC?

  

Yet, in Panini's sutras itself there is the mention of SramaNa. Another contra-pointer is to Ashoka's edicts; if grammar was so well articulated and retention of the genitive affix in a compound was taken to indicate censure, why will an emperor of all the people, use the word 'devaanaampiya' in his edicts?  
  
Maybe the word SramaNa was appropriated by Buddhists later, and maybe Prakrit usages deliberately or otherwise retained improper forms - the way we see certain same-meaning words repeated in Telugu:చనిపోయెను (chanipoyenu; went-went, meaning dead) పేపర్ కాగితము (paper-kaagitamu, meaning simply paper - not used by Sishtas, but by certain uneducated rural people).  
  
History does not give up its secrets easily, I guess.

N. Siva Senani
