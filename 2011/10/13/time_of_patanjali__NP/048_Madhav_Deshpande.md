To be known to all posterity as the preceptor of a world teacher – Jagadguru*Sri Sankaracharya*– is indeed a rare honour. It evokes our sense of wonder. When we remember that*Isvara*Himself was born as*Sri**Sankara*for the spiritual rejuvenation of Hinduism, our wonder knows no bounds. But it may be asked whether a world teacher – especially if He is none other than the Supreme Lord Himself – needs a teacher. The answer is that the world will learn more readily by example rather than precept. The need for a teacher, especially in spiritual matters, is generally recognised. It is he who dispels the darkness of ignorance and frees us from all sorrow. He quickens our understanding and makes us see either what we had not seen before or what we had seen all too dimly. He makes the effulgence of wisdom which is latent in us shine forth in all its splendour. To make us realise this need for*guru*, He who is the preceptor of all preceptors set an example by Himself sitting at the feet of a*guru*. He wants us to realise that one who has not learned to obey is not fit to command and that one who has not himself sat at the feet of a worthy teacher, cannot become a teacher himself.

The preceptor who enjoys this honour of being the preceptor of*Sri**Sankara*is*Sri**Govinda**Bhagavatpada*. In his*purvasrama*, he was*Chandra Sarma*, a handsome Brahmin of Kashmir. Yearning to hear*Patanjali’s*exposition of the*vyakarana*at Chidambaram, he was coming to the South. On the bank of the River*Narmada*, he saw*Gaudapada*who under a curse from*Patanjali*for leaving the place of instruction without permission had become a*Brahmaraksas*.*Patanjali*had decreed that the curse would be lifted when*Gaudapada*found a disciple fit enough to learn the*vyakarana*. It so happened that till the arrival of*Chandra**Sarma*, every scholar who came that way went wrong in giving the ending of a tricky word and was eaten up by the*Brahmaraksas*.*Chandra Sarma*proved an exception. He gave the correct ending. The time for the lifting of the curse had come.*Gaudapada*asked*Chandra**Sarma*where he was going. On being told that he was going to Chidambaram to learn at the feet of*Patanjali*,*Gaudapada*said that the exposition at Chidambaram was over and that he would himself teach the young man. But the condition was that without getting down from the tree on which the*Brahmaraksas*sat, and without sleeping, the disciple should learn what he was taught as quickly as possible. Having no access to writing materials,*Chandra Sarma*made a deep scratch in his thigh and with the blood that oozed out wrote on the leaves of the tree all that he was taught. The instruction continued night and day without food and sleep for nine days. On the completion of his instruction, he gathered up the leaves and tying them up into a bundle, took leave of his teacher.

According to the*Patanjali-vijaya*, a work by*Ramabhadra**Dikshita*written about 200 years ago,*Chandra**Sarma*is none other than*Patanjali*himself. Feeling that*Gaudapada*was not likely to secure a suitable disciple and thus might have to languish under his curse,*Patanjali*took pity on him and was himself born as*Chandra**Sarma*. This was but one more of the many roles that*Patanjali*played.*Patanjali*is none other than*Adisesha*. Among the roles he played, those of*Lakshmana*and*Balarama*may be remembered.  
 To continue the narrative,*Chandra**Sarma*walked some distance with his precious bundle. Overpowered by sleep and hunger, he slept for a while. On waking, he found that a sheep had eaten away part of the leaves in his bundle. He took the bundle with the remaining leaves and on reaching Ujjain, he lapsed into a state of unconsciousness on the pial of a*Vaisya*. The daughter of the*Vaisya*who was struck by the radiant face of*Chandra**Sarma*found him in this state of unconsciousness on account of complete starvation and exhaustion. She fed him by applying on his body curd rice. The nourishment entered his body through the pores of the skin and*Chandra**Sarma*woke up. He wanted to resume his journey. But*Vaisya*wanted him to marry his daughter who had saved his life. On finding him disinclined for marriage, the*Vaisya*took*Chandra**Sarma*to the king. The king who was favourably impressed by the striking appearance of*Chandra Sarma*wanted him to marry his own daughter. He sent for his minister to consult him in order to see whether there was sanction in the*Dharma Sastra*for such a marriage. It so happened that the minister himself had a daughter; and so he was keen on giving her in marriage to this stranger. Thus,*Chandra Sarma*had to marry all the three girls. He stayed with them till each of them had a son by him. Then he continued his journey to find his teacher –*Gaudapada*, from whom he had learnt the*vyakarana*.*Gaudapada*had become a*sannyasin*and was in*Badarikasrama*.*Chandra**Sarma*also become a*sannyasin*, receiving*diksha*from his preceptor and henceforth came to be known as*Govinda**Bhagavatpada*.  
 While*Govinda Bhagavatpada*was with his teacher at*Badarikasrama*, sage*Vyasa*, the author of the*Brahma-sutra*visited them. He asked*Govinda Bhagavatpada*to go to the bank of the River*Narmada*and await the arrival of*Sri Sankara*who was the incarnation of Lord*Siva*. The purpose of this incarnation was to write a commentary on the*Brahma-sutra*. Prior to that,*Sri Sankara*was to be accepted formally as a disciple by*Govinda Bhagavatpada*.*Govindha**Bhagavatpada*came to the bank of the River*Narmada*. It is significant that*Gaudapada*was his teacher both before and after he became a*sannyasin*. It is significant again that to play the role of the teacher he was at the foot of the same tree on which he had sat earlier to receive instruction from*Gaudapada*.  

           *Sri Sankara*came to the bank of the River*Narmada*and offered his salutations at the lotus-feet of*Govinda Bhagavatpada*.*Govinda*accepted*Sankara*as his disciple and initiated him in all the*mahavakyas*.*Sankara*lived with his guru for sometime and learnt the spiritual truth and disciplines under him. After mastering all that had to be learnt from the*guru*,*Sri Sankara*took leave of his master to go to Benaras, where he wrote an authoritative commentary on the*Brahma-sutra*and preached the*Advaita*doctrine."

  

One of the sources for this narrative appears to be Patañjalicarita of Rāmabhadra Dīkṣita. There may be other/older sources as well.
