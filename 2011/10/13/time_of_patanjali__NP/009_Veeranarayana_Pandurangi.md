sorry for technical glitch that sent half message.

  

  

  

patanjali is clear in saying that though these words are not used in this country, they are used in desantara. Q- A series goes like this.

A. these words are used in other countries

Q. we dont find them (in this conutry)?

A. try to find them. there is very large area where these words are used. seven dvipas, three lokas, four vedas along with rahasyas divided into various types, 100 yajurvedas............ etc.

  

**sarve deśāntare**.  
(Pas_12) KA_I,8.23-10.3 Ro_I,35-39 {45/62}sarve khalu api eteśabdāḥdeśāntare prayujyante .  
(Pas_12) KA_I,8.23-10.3 Ro_I,35-39 {46/62}na ca ete upalabhyante .  
(Pas_12) KA_I,8.23-10.3 Ro_I,35-39 {47/62}upalabdhau yatnaḥkriyatām .  
(Pas_12) KA_I,8.23-10.3 Ro_I,35-39 {48/62}mahān hiśabdasya prayogaviṣayaḥ.

saptadvīpā vasumatī trayaḥ lokāḥ catvāraḥ vedāḥ sāṅgāḥ sarahasyāḥ bahudhā vibhinnāḥ ekaśatam adhvaryuśākhāḥ sahasravartmā sāmavedaḥ ekaviṃsatidhā bāhvr̥cyam navadhā ātharvaṇaḥ vedaḥ vākovākyam itihāsaḥ purāṇam vaidyakam iti etāvān śabdasya prayogaviṣayaḥ".  

  

it these are not available in his time he wont tell the opponent to find these sabas in these shakhas etc.

  

here from Q-A series it is clear thatna ca ete upalabhyantepurvapaksha rather than siddhanta.shall one go to svarga to find these wordsif it is held that these shakhas were not available in that time.
