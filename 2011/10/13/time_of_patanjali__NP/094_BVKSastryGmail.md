Namaste



**A side note**, yet which may be of some critical importance for scholarly pursuit in this thread, emerging from various pointers. 



First step is in refined articulation of the references of exploration by Time frame, Common Points of reference and Zone for investigation with pointers to ‘data’.



For me, this is a key issue in tracing a continuity and consistency of a language standard and tradition which goes by the name of ‘Samskrutha Vyakarana –Darshanam (also known as Vedanga Vyakarana / Shabda Brahma Darshanam / Vak-Yoga / Sphota Vada / Shabda –Shakti Niroopanam) ’ for which the hypothesized pedagogic approach is called ‘Yoga way of studying Samskrutham’. The technical name ‘Vak-Yoga, is a Vedic word cited by Patanjali. 



**a) Framing a Time –window and focus: The preferred broad window would be** \<3100 BCE to 1700 AD> ; with sharper and short focus in \< 650 AD to 1400 AD> to explore the local histories of prime centers of three Vedanta schools .



RNI has already identified a window marked for exploring up to 1000 BCE. My earlier mails were talking about 700 BCE to 6000 BCE covering a back period From Buddha –Mahaveer back up to Valmiki. Dr. Kalyanaraman has pushed this window beyond 6000 BCE.



**b) Zone of investigation** : Expanding from current south India narrow centricity to entire India, covering mainly Kedarnath, Badrinath, Nepal and Kashmir. The legends connect all three Acharya in one way or another to these punya-kshetras. The Dashanami Sadhu sampradaya /Akahadas , with different lens of Tantra and Yoga Sadhana are relatively more strong in these areas compared to knowledge oriented scholars and urban model ( = NagarI model) centers of Vedanta in south. I am aware I have not included some of the famous seven moksha-kshetras like - ‘Ayodhya, Mathura, Maya, Kashi, Avantika ’ in which list **Kanchi** figures prominently.



c**) Some ‘Data’ that seems hanging loose and yet to be integrated** : Claims of ‘ Somanth –First of Jyotirlingas also known as Prabhas Temple at Gujrat, claiming a 60,000 year ancestry by Puranas (?!) ; History of Bodh Gaya ( a place which still gets covered in all three Acharya’s travels somehow or other) ; History of Kashmir –and Abhinava Gupta ; Historic records of Nepal –Pashupatinath, another Jyotirlinga
place linked to visit and worship by Shankaracharya . There are differing claims from the ‘Shakti-Peethas’ on history, which again get deeply linked to Shanakras date, beyond ‘ Kanchi and Sringeri’.



I would prefer to call the expansion of the subject theme : ***From ***-‘Time of Patanjali’ ***To*** ‘ Footprints of Vedanta Brahma Jijnayasa :Vyasa tradition in India’ . This would adequately cover the
time stretch of 3100 BCE (at the lower end as widely accepted date of Mahabharata and therefore for Vyasa, who had a clear inheritance of Vedas, Upanishads and probably many understandings of essence of Veda as Kapila-Samkhya Darshana; and documented Srimad Bhagavad-Gita ) and Patanjali ( circa 200 BCE) and diversified continuity of Vedanta documented in Samskrutham, consistently taking recourse to ‘ Paninian Guideline’ for language and Vedas for purpose authentication. 



These would certainly rip open the colonial constructions of history and linguistics of ‘ Brahmi languages’ and address the core common question in the post below : \< some detailed analysis of how 19th century Indians under British colonial rule started assigning dates to our own historical events in the alien Christian calendar.\> at the base of which is buried the ‘disturbed soul of Yoga and Samskrutham’ - The distortion in understanding Yoga technicalities of
Samskruth language studies need a greater attention. The words in Amarakosha for ‘Samskrutham’ are : brAmI –BhAratI – BhaAzA- GIh – Vak- vANI – SarasvatI. Would all these be synonyms ? freely substitutable vocabulary OR different perspectives and pedagogies related to one language ? May we need a focused contemplation why the word ‘Samskrutham does not figure in classical lexicon Amarakosha for what we call and debate today as ‘Sanskrit’. And what would the word ‘DevabhazhA’ –sura-BhAratI’ mean in the context of Amarakosha. Patanjali tradition sets and guards the Yoga Standards of Samskrutham as language. (Shabda –Brahma –Bhashaa). Vedanta Tradition by Acharyas provides guidance and sets standards of practice and philosophy to understand the ‘ Brahma from the Shabda, Vak’. In this sense, both seem to me as intertwined unified traditions flowing in two streams, which can not be artificially separated using ‘ history’.
