My apologies for the duplicate postings. A couple of minor clarifications:

\> Besides, the very point that Patanjali is making in the context you cite, अप्रयुक्ते दीर्घसत्रवत्, is that one cannot dismiss words as unused (useless?), because there is a vast literature where they may have been used even if they do not appear to be in use currently. Thus Patanjali advises in the same context that we should make efforts to find out where such uncommon words have been used, and dismisses idle talk of words not being used as साहसमात्र. From this it can certainly be inferred that Patanjali was in fact citing the \*classical\* counts of Vedic recensions, etc., rather than the sizes/counts of textual corpora that were in fact present before him at the time.

This is actually under the next statement सर्वे देशान्तरे, which follows अप्रयुक्ते दीर्घसत्रवत्. However, the statements न च एते उपलभ्यन्ते, उपलब्धौ यत्नः क्रियताम्, and "सन्ति अप्रयुक्ताः" इति वचनं केवलं साहसमात्रम् invite our attention in this regard. It is not obvious that Patanjali would say न च एते उपलभ्यन्ते and उपलब्धौ यत्नः क्रियताम् if all the classical texts he mentioned had been available at the time.
