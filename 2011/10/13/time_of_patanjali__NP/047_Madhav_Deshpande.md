Dear Sunilji and Surendraji,

  

On the website \[<http://www.kamakoti.org/peeth/origin.html>\], I find the following statement in relation to Govinda Bhagavatpāda and Gauḍapāda. 

  

"The yogi, Sri Govinda Bhagavatpada, recipient of the Mahabhashya from the lips of Sri Gaudapada, asked from within the cave, who was standing near the cave."

  

Do the various Śaṅkaravijayas describe this connection of these two Ācāryas to the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali? Being away from my home library, I cannot check the texts of the Śaṅkaravijayas. This connection or at least a belief in this connection of the Advaitic teachers before Śaṅkara to the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali seems most interesting to me.
