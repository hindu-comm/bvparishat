Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  Both you and Vidyasankar have provided lots of points to ponder over. Yes, Patañjali refers to Kāñcīpura and Kāñcīpuraka in his Bhāṣya on P.4.2.104, and indeed his awareness of southern India is not surprising, if we assign him to the reign of Puṣyamitra Śuṅga in the immediate post-Mauryan period. His reference to Kātyāyana's use of laukika and vaidika, in stead of loke and vede, as a dākṣiṇātya preference for Taddhitas, would place Kātyāyana to the south in relation to Patañjali, though the Śukla Yajurveda traditions associated with Kātyāyana (cf. Thieme's identification of the Vārttikakāra with the author of the Śukla-Yajurveda-Prātiśākhya) are historically more prominent in north India, than in the south.

  Patañjali's reference to Kāñcī certainly establishes Kāñcī as a well known urban center in centuries BC. Connecting that to the claims of the Kāñcī Śaṅkara Mutt tradition would require a lot of historical evidence. What needs to be investigated is how and how early the (presumably northern) Patañjali came to be integrally associated with the Nataraja of Chidambaram. My guess is that Patañjali comes to be associated with the Advaita tradition in Tamilnadu through his prior inclusion in the Chidambaram tradition.

  I have discussed how the Pratyāhārasūtras of Pāṇini came to be associated with Śiva most likely through the southern tradition.

  Indeed, this is an exciting area to explore, and I hope someone with intimate knowledge of the Sanskrit and Tamil sources connected with the history of Chidambaram will produce some new research.

  With best wishes,
