Namaste,  
  

Thank you Prof. Iyengar for pointing out the credentials of Vidyasankarji (IIT + Caltech) and I am aware of that. I also know about your high credentials as an ex-professor of [I.I.Sc](http://I.I.Sc). ( Indian Institute of Science). In fact during my Masters in 1960, I had the occasion to see our outgoing head of the department Dr. B. Sanjiva Rao, who was earlier the ex-Director of [I.I.Sc](http://I.I.Sc). Now coming to Shri Vidyasankaraji, he also has a pleasant persoanlity as I had the occasion to meet him once at his house in Mumbai, and I have seen him always using a polished language in his mails as well as in his talks. However, when it comes to issues where one may or may not agree with each other, the personal convictions based on one's own deep study plays a more crucial role and one may stand upto anybody, be the adversary the acclaimed highest authority or a Nobel prize recipient.  
  

Now coming to the historical issues, at times one may run short of experimental methods to determine things to the scientific precision and it really so happened in modern science itself and the Avogadro's hypothesis had to be proposed. This hypothesis still holds good as there has nothing been found which violates this hypothesis. I wish that, if the opponents of the 6th century BCE birth year of Adi Shankara are unable to find the correct year of Adi Shankara to their satisfaction, they should come out with a hypothetical date of Adi Shankara that works like the Avogadro hypothesis works and not just remain in a limbo in finding the history of the Shringeri math. I reassure my friends, that I have the highest regards for the Shringeri math and remember its contributions. Let us also not forget that Adi Shankara's date is one of the key milestone in the ancient Indian history.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB.
