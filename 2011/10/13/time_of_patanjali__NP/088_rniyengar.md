Dear Prof.Deshpande,

I read your paper with interest. Pāṇini hearing the Māheśvarasutras coming out of Shiva’s Damaru is a fascinating story, (heard since my childhood) 100% mystical with likely links to Mantraśāstra. You have made many interesting points that are of general historical interest for persons like me outside the circle of specialist Vaiyākaraṇas. I like to offer the following discussion:

1) The emphasis you make about the Śivasūtras is that they seem to have close cultural and historical connection with Chidambaram, Naṭarāja and the South Indian Śaiva tradition. This needs more evidences is my view; not because I am a Vaiṣṇava! Chidambaram even though popularly known as a śaiva kṣetra now, it was not so 1200-1300 years ago. There is a temple for Viṣṇu lying on the ādiśeṣa (Patañjali if you like) watching the Dance of Shiva in the same *raṅga* the large Nataraja-complex and this is one among the 108 canonical temples for Śrīvaiṣṇavas. I realize that this by itself has nothing to do with your proposition. But the history of Chidambaram does not seem to go as far back as that of Kāñcīpuram. It is said that the first structural temple in the south is the Kailasanatha Temple at Kanchi of the Pallavas (7^(th) Cent). This temple has several stone reliefs that could be the preliminary simulations of the Nataraja concept. Nirupama Raghavan has an interesting publication “Is Siva iconography inspired by the Stars” (IJHS 2006, pp.271-295). She also refers to the important point that although the famous bronze Natarajas belong to the Chola period (when I guess Chidambaram attained its peak) the initial conception (and an image at the Albert Victoria museum) belongs to the Pallava period. More details on this point are in the paper available at (<http://www.sharadasrinivasan.com/data/shivacosmicdancer.pdf>). My feeling is that the legend of the fundamental-sutras emerging out of the Damaru of Śiva might have had its origin at Pallava-Kanchipuram, before 6-7^(th) Century. If the physical feature of Chidambaram is any evidence to depend on, then the śaiva-vaiṣṇava sectarian bifurcation should have happened a century or so after the founding of the temple-city in happier times with both icons in the same enclosure.

  

2)The Atharvaveda pariśiṣṭa (43.4.16) knows Pāṇini by name. I don’t know whether this is same as the grammarian, but most likely to be so. The text knows *Dīnāra* the NW Indian currency and hence my guess is AVP in its present form should have got fixed c 300 BC. My question is about (AV Pariśiṣṭa.47. Varṇapaṭalam) ***It starts with:*** *oṃ varṇān pūrvaṃ vyākhyāsyāmaḥ prākṛtā ye ca vaikṛtāḥ\| śrutinirvacanāt sarve vivadante vivṛttiṣu\|\| **and ends with: (47,3.6)**** varṇāḥ pancaṣaṣṭiḥ svarā dvāviṃśatiḥ samānākṣarāṇi caturdaśa aṣṭau saṃdhyakṣarāṇy ekonaviṃśatir nāminas tricatvāriṃśad vyanjanānisparśāḥ pancaviṃśatiś catvāras tv antaḥsthāḥ catvāro yamāś cāṣṭāv ūṣmāṇo 'yogavāhā daśāyogavāhā daśa* \|\| This chapter is followed by48*kautsavyaniruktanighaṇṭuḥ.*

My question is; has there been any investigation of this text vis-a-vis Sanskrit Grammar?

  

3) The author Śivarāmendrasaraswati, whom you cite, seems linked to the Kanchi Kamakoti-peetham through his name.

Best regards
