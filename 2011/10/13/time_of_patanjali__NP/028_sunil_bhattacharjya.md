Yes, historically Patanjali lived quite a number of centuries before Guadapada. Abhimanyu, a king of Kasmir in the 12th century BCE (according to Kalhana's Rajatarangini), encouraged the study of Mahabhasya. On the other hand Gaudapada could have lived in the 6th or 7th century BCE, if we accept the dating of his grand-disciple, Shankaracharya, in the early 6th century BCE, as claimed by some Shankara mathas such as the Dwaraka math.
