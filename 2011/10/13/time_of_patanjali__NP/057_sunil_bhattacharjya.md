Dear friends,  
  
As regards the dating of Gaudapada, any suppositions on the date of the text of Adishesha's Paramarthasara will be a weak proposition. At best one may consider that Abhinavagupta's time is known and it is also known that his (Abhinavagupta's) Paramarththere is a Shaivite adaptation of Adishesha's Paramarthasara.  
  

Sankhyakarika of Gaudapada seems to gives us a better lead to the date of Gaudapada. To my knowledge, during the regime of the Chines emperor Wu-Ti (156 - 87 BCE) of the Han dynasty, a chinese team came to the Guota king and the Indian king sent the Buddhist Paramartha (from Ujjain).with them. Paramartha translated Gaudapada's Sankhyakarika to Chinese. From this one can arrive at the date Gaudpada prior to the1st or 2nd century BCE.
