Dear Ajitji,  
  

You rightly said that dates arrived at by astronolical methods has differed. What has happened in many cases is due to not taking the proper data or due to misinterpretation of data. But it is not proper to cast aspersion on astronomy and modern software. Dr. Narahari Achar's date on Adi Snakaracharya using latest software cannot be disputed as those details (data) could not have been fabricated in the 19th century CE. The only thing is that the amiable Prof. Achar had not pressed his point beyond submitting that paper. His Astronomical dating of Kanishka confirms the Rajatarangini date of Kanishka. I agree to his dating of Lord Buddha as that also agrees with that Rajatarangini and the pauranic data. But I do not agree with Prof. Achar's date of the Mahabharata war as he has misinterpreted some data and I know that what he misinterpreted is due to his unfamiliarity with Astrology. Vedavyasa used both astrological and astronomical data in the Mahabharata. The Jyotish-shastra includes both the astronomy and astrology and one has to know both to be able to interpret the Mahabharata data. A well known scholar had called me a mole as I did not agree with his dating of the Mahabharata war. Another reputed historian called me "suar", which means "swine", for not agreeing to Prof. Achar's dating of the Mahabharata war. I guess Prof. Achar knows that person. I do not want to disclose their names and humiliate them, as they must be repenting now for their indiscretion.  
  

Epigraphical data are also misinterpreted by famouse epigraphers. If you want proof I can elaborate.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
