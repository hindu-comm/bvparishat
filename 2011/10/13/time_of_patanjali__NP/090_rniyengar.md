Dear Prof.Deshpande,

Many thanks for your response and information about your work. If I gave the impression that *dīnāra* appears in the Varṇapaṭala, I am sorry. It appears in Ch. 36. Ucchuṣmakalpaḥ. I cited the word only to put a time frame for the AVP. The text in its different chapters contains historically very ancient information. For example the citation to शकधूम between कृत्तिका & रोहिणी in the first chapter is most likely a sky picture going as far back as the Rgveda (1.164). Without at least a relative chronology many textual statements and practices remain obscure
and at times even misunderstood. I am impressed with your historical approach to map the intellectual tradition in time to understand our ancient texts.

Regards

RN Iyengar
