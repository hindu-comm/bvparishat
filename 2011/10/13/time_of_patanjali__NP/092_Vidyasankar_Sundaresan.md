Dear Prof. Iyengar,

  

na brUyAt satyam apriyam iti nyAyAt tUshNIm bhaveti bahavo mAm upadizanti \| tathApi "hitaM ca nAnRtaM brUyAd" iti cApyuktaM, na vA?

  

For those who may be offended by my speaking apriya satya-s, I hope the following will rather be taken in the spirit of that which is hita and na-anRta. I would like not to write more on this topic on this forum, after this particular post. I look forward to talking in person later this year, when I visit Bangalore.  

  

1\. The ancient well-attested history of Kancipura as a learning center, as a religious center, as a political capital city and as a trading center is one thing. The highly contested history(within the advaita tradition)of the contemporary institution aligned with advaita vedAnta that is located in that city is altogether quite another thing.

  

2\. Why there was a need to trace a date to the 5th century BCE is a question that will need some detailed analysis of how 19th century Indians under British colonial rule started assigning dates to our own historical events in the alien Christian calendar.

  

3\. When a source is demonstrably unreliable even with dates as recent as the 1700s, e.g. the life of sadASiva brahmendra, the celebrated avAdhUta, one has to examine its statements about even earlier times with critical scrutiny. As you have noticed, we are asked to believe that we have details of tithi, mAsa, vAra, nakshatra, etc of every Sannyasi in one lineage, reaching back to more than two millennia. Even the wealthiest gRhastha-s, with a vested interest in maintaining property and social prestige, don't maintain these kinds of details for their past family members, even for their vasu-rudra-Aditya-rUpa ancestors.

  

4\. When the daSanAmI sannyAsI tradition, which is spread all over India, has old documents that list more than 50 maThas, ASramas and akhADA centers in the early 19th century, none of which list Kancipuram, one has to give that source of evidence its due weight.

  

5\. When Tamil sources like Singaravelu Mudaliar's early Tamil encyclopedia (Abhidhana Cintamani, cf. footnotes in my IJHS paper), also say nothing about a maTha in Kancipuram, but list Kumbhakonam as one of the centers established post-Vidyaranya, those details have to be taken into account as well. The silencein old traditional sources, about the presence in Kancipuram of an advaita vedAnta institution, is resoundingly loud.

  

6\. Complaints to the British District Collector ofChengalpet, filed by the then authorities of the Kamakshi temple in the year 1842, are available, describing the Kumbhakonam Mathadhipati as a stranger to the Kancipuram region and as "a proponent of a different creed." It was effectively the British colonial administration, which handed over the reins of the Kanci Kamakshi temple to the head of the Kumbhakonam Matha at the time, due to which that Matha then came to be known as the Kanchi Matha. In my grandmother's generation, the words Kumbhakonam Acharyal/Swamiyar and Kumbhakonam matham were the only ones commonly used.

  

7\. In the 20th century, the then authorities of the Bangaru Kamakshi temple in Tanjavur (descendants of the family of the Carnatic music composer, Shyama Sastri) also contested the claims of this Matha about control over that temple. This case was disposed of in the Madras High Court, only in the year 1966 or so. Cf. the article by Vijayalakshmi and Mattison Mines, referenced in my IJHS paper.

  

8\. Another notable advaita vedanta institution in Kancipuram is the one established by upanishad brahmendra, an advaita author of commentaries on all the 108 upanishat texts listed in the muktikopanishat. The 19th century literature from this institution describes itself as the first maTha of the advaita tradition in this ancient city. If there had already been an advaita sampradAya institution there, started by no less than Adi Sankara himself, why would the disciples and grand-disciples of upanishad brahmendra claim theirs to be the first advaita maTha in the city of Kancipuram?

  

9\. An 1896 Tamil publication of the Kumbhakonam Matha itself describes this Matha as having had 4 or 5 Mathadhipatis in its lineage at the time (inta maTAtInaM tuTanki nAngu-aindu paTTankaLAka ...). All the historically attested heads of the Kumbhakona Matha were drawn from among the descendants of Govinda Dikshita, the Kannada speaking minister of three of the Tanjavur Nayakas and father of Venkatamakhin, author of the musicological treatise caturdaNDi prakASikA and father of the melakartA scheme of contemporary Carnatic music. This is certainly a well-respected family, with multiple scholarly contributions to the credit of its members, but Sannyasis in the advaita tradition are actually expected to give up all family ties. This pattern of control by a prominent family over a Sannyasi institution, spanning several generations, is not unique (some mAdhva maThas also have similar histories), but was broken only in the year 1954, when Sri Jayendra Sarasvati was appointed successor-designate. The move of the center of operations, from Kumbhakonam to Kancipuram, was still ongoing during the lifetime of Sri Chandrasekharendra Sarasvati, who lived till the 1990s. There are problems galore with the claim that it was an originally Kanci based institution that moved to Kumbhakonam and then moved back to Kancipuram, some of which have been listed above.

  

10\. Finally, why all the elaborate text-torturing by Dr. N. Veezhinathan, under the pretext of producing a critical edition of a Sankaravijaya text, as recently as the year 1970? Clearly, there was a great need to bolster an extremely weak case, which was met by utilizing a network of modern university based activity. All their unique claims - about an indra-sarasvatI nAma, about a fifth mahAvAkya (om tat sat?, neha nAnAsti kiMcana?, om?), about a Sivalinga that is supposedly mentioned by SrIharsha in the naishadhIya and about the authorship and authenticity of the anantAnandagirIya Sankaravijaya - simply fall apart in the textual sources, even within this so-called critical edition, notwithstanding all the efforts of Dr. T M P Mahadevan and Dr. N Veezhinathan. I believe I have demonstrated this in great detail in my article.

  

We can only speculate about why the contemporary Kanchi Matha wants to date itself back to 2500 years or so ago. I suspect that a large part of it is driven by an implicit drive to place any great Indian of the past to a very remote time, preferably before Christ. This is a sort of instinctive response to the conclusions of western style, academic scholarship, which tend to assign the latest dates possible. This kind of response is often misguided, in my opinion, and it ends up weakening those genuine instances when we should indeed seriously consider and actively argue for earlier dates than accepted by the "scholarly consensus" that evolves within modern academia.

  

The prime motivations of various key people who lived a century and half ago will forever be hidden to us, but the weight of evidence \*against\* the Kanchi Matha's self-reporting of its origins and history is simply enormous. Contrary to their story that the sarvajnapITha in Kanchipuram itself, all accounts of Ramanuja's life also mention that he traveled to the Kashmir seat to obtain the bodhAyana vRtti on the brahmasUtras. Certainly, Yadavaprakasa, Ramanuja and Vedanta Desika didn't have titular Sankaracharya-s to contend with in their own native Kancipuram. I'm not bringing this up to appeal to the sampradAya of your last name. Rather, I want to highlight that to mine dry and "bare facts" historical information from the colorful, non-historical material of legends and myths about historical personalities, one needs an approach that is a lot more comprehensive in its sources and that searches for internal consistency as much as possible.

  

Inasmuch as the textual and temple-based traditions about patanjali are concerned, all this to-do about Kancipuram and Cidambaram may well be a digression into a cul-de-sac, but it does need to be taken, if rAmabhadra dIkshita's kAvya on patanjali is to be studied, along with the legendary associations with the Cidambaram Nataraja temple. Interestingly enough, the older Calcutta editions of the anantAnandagirIya Sankaravijaya make Sankara also a native of Cidambaram, although Veezhinathan's 1970 "critical edition" tries to correct course and go back to the pan-Indian tradition of a Kerala birth for Sankara. What we can say for certain is that there was indeed a kind of new tradition growing in the Tanjavur region a couple of centuries ago, that attempted to weave together accounts of patanjali, gauDapAda and Sankara. As to why this was happening at the time and whether it resulted in anything more than a set of fanciful stories, all of that remains to be seen. It might simply have been a consequence of a high influx of people with multiple variant traditions, between the end of Vijayanagara, the rule of Telugu speaking Nayakas with their Kannada speaking ministers, followed by the Maratha rulers of Tanjavur. The problem, of course, is that this imagined reconstruction has had to contend with other, pre-existing legends about Sankara, handed down in the living Sankaran tradition, which is widespread in India, not localized to the Tamil speaking region. And when such fancy is mistaken to be a faithful historical narrative, by well-meaning but ill-informed people, an entirely different set of issues surfaces. All of this wanders rather far afield, so I'll now say, ity alam.

  

With namaskaras,

Vidyasankar
