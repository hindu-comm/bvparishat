**'should one go to Svarga to find out these words' - Prof
Veeranarayana  
  
There are two kinds of people in terms of S'abdAnus'Asanam
(Laghus'abdendus'ekhara , Ma\~njUs.A etc) - Lks.yaikacaks.us.ka and
Laks.an.aikacaks.us.ka .  
  
The former refers to Panini, Katyayana , Patanjali etc - for whom all the Laks.yas ( examples ) are available due to Yogas'akti (already discussed two years ago) --  
  
AvirbhUtaprakAs'AnAm anupaplutacetasAm I  
atItAnAgataj!\~nAnam pratyaks.Anna vis'is.yate II  
  
atIndriyAn asamvedyAn pas'yantyArs.en.a caks.us.A I  
ye bhAvAn , vacanam tes.Am nAnumAnena bAdhyate II Vakyapadiyam - Brahmakanda 37&38)  
  
Also , under 'pr.s.odarAdIni [yathopadis.t.am](http://yathopadis.t.am) ' (6-3-109) this aspect is discussed .  
  
So if one wants to find out as to whether a particular S'abda is right or wrong , used or not , then one should try the way of Trimunis , i.e. YogasAdhana .  
  
This is applicable to YogAnus'Asana and Ayurveda also. Otherwise let someone do a matching work .  
  
This is what was meant by Sasmkaracarya under ' s'AstrayonitvAt ' ( BrahmasUtram 1-1-3) - pAn.inyAdInAmiva .. vyAkaran.Adi ... j\~neyaikades'a ... .  
  
Laks.n.aikacaks.us.kas are people like us - we infer the 'laks.ya' thru the '[laks.n.am](http://laks.n.am)' . We do not have the capacity Panini etc. had had .  
What about 'aprayukta' -- it is better not to use this term for obvious reasons . 'aprayukte dIrghasatravat' - since today such a S'bda is not seen one should not remark that such a S'abda is / was not there .  
  
If it is said in the case of any word - na hi vaci.h antipara.h prayujyate (Bhasyam) , i.e. 'vacanti' , although it can be achieved thru Paninisutra , is not SAdhu - Patanjali etc say / clarify then that can be taken as an authority .  
  
Pl see S'bdakaustubha also (Paspasa) .  
  
Ars.aprayoga - means used in Smr.tis , Kalpa and other works done by [R.s.is](http://R.s.is) - chando vat kavaya.h kurvanti , na hi es.A is.t.i.h -- Bhasyam under 'yUstrAkhyau nadI ' ( 1-4-3)

**There is a lot to discuss . Any specific question/ doubt can be addressed .
