Dear Sunilji,



Are we talking about personal convictions or historical facts. It will be always good to speak what facts warrant. Beyond facts it’s all narration and different individuals have different abilities. Its left to ones decision if one wants to go beyond sentiments and narratives may it be historical dates or philosophical debate.

As Vidayasankarji has already said that he will be making a trip to India in December. Rather than rewrite here much of what I've written elsewhere, I would welcome an opportunity to talk in person. I estimate that would also be the better course of action, because this topic of historicity of reported paramparAs of various institutions becomes a very sensitive one, perhaps a bit too sensitive today!”

Regards

Ajit Gargargeshwari
