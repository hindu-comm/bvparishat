The IHQ volume 2 is of interest for one more reason, again concerning Patanjali. A short note by the famous M. Hiriyanna appears as follows (pp.415-16):

I request scholars to comment on the above note. Has there been any further research on the

date of Gaudapada as suggested above? Also I like to know whether there is any other Sanskrit

literary work that contains Greek personal names. The book "Travels" by Osmond Priaulx is available

on [archive.org](http://archive.org). This book refers to Apollonius (1st Cent AD), Damis, Iarchus and also to Phraotes.

I am curious to know whether Mahaabhaashya or any other Sanskrit work refers to Iarchus (Ayaarchya).

Thanks
