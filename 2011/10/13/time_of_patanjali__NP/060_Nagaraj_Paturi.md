\> Now coming back to the historical claims of K-Maṭha going back to 482BCE and that of Śṛ-Maṭha reaching only 820 AD as shown on their respective web sites, one needs to ponder whether both can be reconciled, instead of brushing aside one in preference to the other. Since Śankarācārya’s date is 8-9^(th) Cent, Kāñci monastic order must have had some strong reason to trace its origin to BCE period. Is it probable an already existing monastery (Vedic/Bauddha) was brought into the Advaitic fold in the above period? This is of course a speculation, but from available evidences can such a possibility be denied? (Highlighting mine)

  

------- Many who like both to be reconciled instead of brushing aside one in preference to the other (e.g. my father ) speculated on these lines of 'an earlier existing Sri Vidya/Tantra related maTha being revived / modified (say vegetarianized or something like that)and as a result maintained by an Advaitic order of Sannyasis'.
