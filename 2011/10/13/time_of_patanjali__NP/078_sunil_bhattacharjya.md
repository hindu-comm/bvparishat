Namaste,  
  

There are some gross mistakes in the book "India in the times of Patanjali". Let us refer to page 6 of the book. I-Ching never said that Bhartrihari was in 651 CE. I.Ching referred to one Dharmapala and conveyed that Bhartrihari was a contemporary of Dharmapala. That Dharmapala was not the King Dharmapala of Bengal, but the Dharmapala,a teacher in Nalanda, who was somewhat a contemporary of Dignaga. Most of the historians of the colonial times, dabbled in the Indian history and tried their best to interpret the chronology of the events, as was conducive to the AIT, chronology. The later scholars who accepted those AIT-aligned chronologies unquestioningly, committed errors due to their being unaware of this aspect.
