Dear Ajitji,  
  

I am talkng about personal convictions based deep study on historical facts. Most of the people today, dabbling in the ancient Indian history, have not even read the Rajatarangini properly, just to give you an instance. The astronomical dating has also been discarded by many, as the findings oppose their long-held views. One thing in favour of the astronomical studies is that the stars don't lie. The astronomical data on the events of the ancient past, given in the books, can also be verified, whether these are facts or fiction.  
  

Regards,
