Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  This is a very interesting reference suggesting Gauḍapāda as the first commentator on the Mahābhāṣya. I don't have access at the moment to the original work Gururatnamālā, but I suspect the second line of the verse quoted by Hiriyanna should read: अथ गौडपदान् फणीशभाष्यप्रथमाचार्यकपण्डितान् प्रपद्ये. While we do not know of a commentary by Gauḍapāda on the Mahābhāṣya from any other source, let alone he being the first commentator on the Mahābhāṣya, Śaṅkara, said to be in the lineage of Gauḍapāda, is intimately familiar with the Mahābhāṣya, and particularly the works of Bhartṛhari. Śaṅkara's commentary on the Brahmasūtra (Tarkāpratiṣṭhāna-Adhikaraṇa) appears to be modeled on the arguments found in the Brahmakāṇḍa of the Vākyapadīya, and his multiple explanations of the term brahma-jijñāsā seem to be following Patañjali's multiple explanations of the term dharma-niyama in the Mahābhāṣya. So, it would not be surprising if Gauḍapāda authored a commentary on the Mahābhāṣya or at least was a leading teacher of the Mahābhāṣya. However, we need more evidence for this from other sources. In any case, thank you for pointing to a very important note by M. Hiriyanna.
