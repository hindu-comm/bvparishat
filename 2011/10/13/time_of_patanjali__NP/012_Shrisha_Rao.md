Beg your pardon, but though you are correct in the details, I do not find the overall reasoning very persuasive. Patanjali here is saying that the \*words\* are all to be found in other countries, and that the scope of usage of the words extends to the massive amounts of traditional literature including the various recensions of the Vedas, etc. However, he is making no promise, and he does not have to, that the various \*recensions\*, etc., are themselves found in other countries; to conclude so is quite invalid, and showing the error of such a conclusion formally using first-order logic would be an easy student exercise using semantic tableaux or such. To consider an informal example, let's consider that I say to someone that I knew a number of working people a while ago but I do not hear of them now, so I think they have all retired. Then that someone could respond to me that no, the people I have lost touch with are all working but in other countries, and I would have to look at the entire Forbes list of corporations to find where they might be working. This can be quite accurate, but does not constitute a guarantee that all the companies on the Forbes list are themselves around; some may well have gone out of business also. It is in general not a good idea to conclude a time-variant property (such as that of being extant) of a superset (like a text corpus) based on the same property existing in a proper subset (like a set of words), unless there is an ironclad guarantee that the property of the subset and superset cannot change independently.

\> shall one go to svarga to find these words if it is held that these shakhas were not available in that time.

There however is no proven need to find every शाखा in order to find the words that Patanjali may be concerned with. For one thing, certain words can be found even though some source in which they occur is lost, because they occur in others. For instance, it is known from secondary sources that शं नो देवीरभीष्टये occurs in the पिप्पलाद-शाखा and तत् शं योरावृणीमहे occurs in the बाष्कल-शाखा of the RV. However, even though these शाखाs are lost, one would hardly regard a word like वृणीमहे as unused, because it is also found in other sources. The fact that a word exists is no guarantee that \*all\* sources where it could be found also do (only that there is \*at least one\* extant source for it), and therefore, one cannot conclude the simultaneous existence of all sources simply because some subset of words of interest did/do continue to exist.

On the original topic of this thread, the date of Patanjali, the only relevant material I am personally aware of is the Collected Works of Sir R.G. Bhandarkar, vol. 1 (1933), particularly pp. 108 ff. This is available online also:  
  
<http://oudl.osmania.ac.in/bitstream/handle/OUDL/2428/218867_Collected_Works_Of_Sir_R_G_Bhandarkar_Vol_I.pdf?sequence=2>

Bhandarkar thinks Patanjali lived in Pataliputra and "probably wrote the third chapter of his Bhasya between 144 BC and 142 BC." I leave to others to discuss whether, and to what extent, this is considered accurate as per the latest research.
