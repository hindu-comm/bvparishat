Dear Prof. Iyengar,

I'm happy that you find my paper to be well researched and written impartially. Usually, I am accused of being quite partisan. On the other hand, I'm a bit concerned that it has confounded confusion! My goal was to clarify a lot of issues of tradition, legend and history, to the best of my ability.

I will be making a trip to India in December. Rather than rewrite here much of what I've written elsewhere, I would welcome an opportunity to talk in person. I estimate that would also be the better course of action, because this topic of historicity of reported paramparAs of various institutions becomes a very sensitive one, perhaps a bit too sensitive today!

Namaskaras,  
Vidyasankar
