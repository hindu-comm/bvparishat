Madhavji,

  

I just rapidly read through the article, but got tired with the phrase "inspiration".

Why should an analytic work be labelled with an "inspiration"?
Inspirations

produce poetry, metaphors and imaginations. Panini has nothing of the sort.

To me, it is a pure scientific work. You may explore who his teacher was

and who his students were who helped retain the manuscript.

  

On Shivasutra, we need to examine its completeness as a map of human

speech system. I have not seen a paper yet. Shivasutra rejects various

modifications of vowels as perceived by the ear and gets into the production

of speech. It has a beauty of quantizing the speech system. In such a

process, it could be in conflict with the analog nature of speech which is

popularly rendered. Such quantization might have been an evolution

process, possibly tallied with the evolution of mathematics. What we need

to examine is if the metric melody forced quantization that eventually helped

create the alphabet.

  

In any case, I am uncomfortable to dump "inspiration" on analytic work as

is the practice by the Indology scholars. Authors to offer their "product" to

their esteemed deities with gratitude, but that does not reduce the power of

human contribution in the work.

  

An opinion.
