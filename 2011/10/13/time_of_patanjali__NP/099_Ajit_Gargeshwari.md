All the dates offered by astronomical methods including Rajatrangini chronicle is not beyond dispute. At best for ancient chronology one can offer tentative dates. Relative chronology makes a lot more sense. We are talking about Patanjali dates on this thread and probably we can stick to that. Stars don't lie but their interpretations does. Astronomical dating is not a substitute for archaeological epigraphical evidence where there are no such evidence one can look into other methods as tentative keeping ones own guesses and theories behind .
