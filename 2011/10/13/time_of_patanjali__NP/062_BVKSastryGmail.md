Namaste



An interesting thread with issues coming together to trace the **history –time line of Advaita personalities and footprints of Advaita tradition** used by different ‘ Peethams/ Paramparaa’, which seem apparently irreconcilable. There is a need to revisit and rewrite ‘ A consistent and reconciled history of all the peethams and traditions which would project a seamless understanding of ‘Advaita’ Tradition from a reference point of ‘Gita’ and ‘Brahma Sutras’ going back to some 3000 BCE ! Way before Patanjali , Claimed date of 1500 BCE for Shankara and Buddha by some schools. A period way before ‘ Greek intervention’ ( unless Mahabharata history itself leads to Greeks in India –Kurukshetra ). 



There are some larger issues with which these need to be linked and addressed. I articulate these without taking sides and look forward for scholarly inputs.



1. **Looking at the ‘Advaita Darshana – Acharya –Peethams History’ in the expanded frame** : Additional input regarding Acharya Shankara’s date related : The Veerasaiva Panchacharya Tradition propounds Acharya Shankara was initiated by Siddha-Yogi Renuka Maharshi, who ‘ emerged in a manner of self-manifestation’ from a ‘ Lingam’; and initiated Acharya Shankara to the secrets of Vedic Worship. This is a live tradition, held strongly by the ‘ Panditaaraadhya / Jagadguru Renukacharya paramparaa - Veerasaiva community’ and anchored to Sri Sailam Jyotirlinga Peetham, at Andhra-Pradesh and certain other parts of Karnataka.

If this connection is to be traced per claims, the landscape of this debate would stretch beyond ‘ resources used by Shankara peethams for historicity’ and the connection of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Siddhar tradition, Ujjain and Kashmir become relevant.



2**. Understanding ‘Abhinavagupta’ as a Person and Acharya,
properly**: The connection of Kashmir Saivism / Abhinava Gupta is another contentious issue. The portrayal of Abhinavagupta as a tantric,
in resources used by Shankara –Peetham is not resonating with the known history of Abhinavgupta as a lochana-kaara and author of several works on Saivism flavor of Advaita, even though the flavor of explanation may
look different ! It would be interesting to note that Vaishnvadvaita uses almost a mirror imaged model of this explanation to explain vedic tradition. Both are locked to Aagama while Vedanta schools are locked directly to Prasthana –Traya.



All these schools are built on the foundational criticality of Samskrutham Language Scholarship by ‘Panini-Patanajli - anchor’
along with its ‘Mantra-Yoga’ Flavors as ‘Yoga-Samskrutham’ linked to ‘Vedanga –Shadanga Samskrutham Education ( = Vak-Yoga Sampradaya)’.( So is the case with Buddhists and Jains also.)



3. **Understanding the anchor of Kashmir based ‘Shaaradaa Devi’ to worship at Sringeri’** in the sloka: **Namaste Shaaradaa Devi, Kashmeera –Pura –Vaasinee** : What is the importance of this link beyond a faith of ‘Goddess walking down to South from North’ ? How the worship of ‘Sri Maha-Rajnee’ at Kashmir and Sri Shaaradaa are connected through the first line of Lalitaa worship and Sri –Vidyaa Tradiitons? The first line of Lalitaa ashtottara reads : **Srimaataa – Sri maharajnee ,srimat simhasaneswari’** . The Same **Sharadaa** is worshipped as ‘**Sri Mahaa Rajnee’** in Kashmir. At Sringeri, she is goddess of learning. At Kashmir, she is the benevolent queen.





Surely, There is a need to revisit and rewrite ‘ A consistent and reconciled history of all the peethams and traditions’ ; and this may
be one of the major reasons to fight a Battle: Sanskrit ! and Swadesi History of Masters of Religions and Religious Institutions ?! That would also help to resolve whether the Samskruth word \<Gupta> would
mean \<Secret, embedded> OR \< a tag name to a Royal dynasty> OR \<
tag name after a Samskara for religion-practice Identity>.
