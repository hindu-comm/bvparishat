Madhavji,

Maheswara could be his teacher. There is tendency in general to lump

good work to unseen forces. I thought Wiebke Peterson's paper was on the

style of presentation than on the phonology of the model. We have to look

how the alphabet model can be created. Representation is not so interesting.

I am particularly interested in the neurological time of rendering a vowel

and then quantization if studied.

I will study the other papers next week.

Thank you.

Bijoy
