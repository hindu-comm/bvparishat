Recently Shrisha Rao quotedग्रामे ग्रामे काठकं कालापकं च प्रोच्यते

  
  

I have a question as towhat was the time of patanjali?

it is difficult to believe that in first or second century BC there existed, as stated by Patanjali

  

"(Pas_12) KA_I,8.23-10.3 Ro_I,35-39 {49/62}saptadvīpā vasumatī trayaḥ lokāḥ catvāraḥ vedāḥ sāṅgāḥ sarahasyāḥ bahudhā vibhinnāḥ ekaśatam adhvaryuśākhāḥ sahasravartmā sāmavedaḥ ekaviṃsatidhā bāhvr̥cyam navadhā ātharvaṇaḥ vedaḥ vākovākyam itihāsaḥ purāṇam vaidyakam iti etāvān śabdasya prayogaviṣayaḥ".

  

is it possible in second century BC? how much time is needed for the
loss of atleast nearly 19-20 of the rgvedic shakhas?

  

I think Patanjali never makes any reference to Buddhism. does he? if not he must be pre-buddha. may be around 1500- 1000 BC. (not sure of exact dates) if this is accepted as his time what is the difficulty inग्रामे ग्रामे काठकं कालापकं च प्रोच्यते? it is quite acceptable that when there was no alternative religion in that part of india.
