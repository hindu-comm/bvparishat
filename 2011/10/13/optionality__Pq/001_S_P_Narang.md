Contradicting few places, I have the opinion that the Acaryas mentioned by Panini are the dialects of various regions which were explored by various acaryas of that region and continue even today particularly in the field of phonetics. i explored and elaborated Sakalya and interpreted it as the dialect of Sialkot which preserves the same phonetics in LopaH sakalya.  
Paper: A dialect of Sialkot in Panini. In: Studies in Indology: Prof. R.V. Joshi Fel. Vol., Delhi, 1988-89, [pp.197-210.It](http://pp.197-210.It) is elaborated by a number of regional examples and phonetics. i am exploring Gargya in the same light . The region was known to Panini through tribal migration of Sansis who were known in Salaturiya and Rajasthan.  
Moreover, anyatarasyaam means: like the other languages. the suffix tara is used in sanskrit in the sense of like also. e.g. sutatara, vyaghratara etc. which changes to la in hindi. sutela, baghela. similarly anyatara. A paper in Pratidanam: Kuiper fel. vol. Regards, spnarang
