Dr. Patel,  
Kiparsky tried to justify Panini by understanding the three terms, the following way :

vaa 'prefered option'  
vibhashaa 'better not( na vaa), i.e. not prefered option'  
anyatarasyaam 'fifty-fifty option'

He worked on this problem along with Prof. S.D.Joshi for three years and had exentisively used the Scriptorium of the Deccan College Post-graduate and Research Institute where the Dictionary of Sanskrit on historical principles is being prepared.

This study is based on actual usages ( some kind of a statistical method). Please read his book, I had mentioned.
