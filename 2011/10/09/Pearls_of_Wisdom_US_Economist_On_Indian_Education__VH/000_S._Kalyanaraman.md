### **Amusing**

Cut your nose, to spite your face.

A product**[of Indian education system](http://quicktake.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/indian-education-stirrings-at-the-margin/ "Indian education – Stirrings at the margin By 2ndlook")**, at least partially, Atanu Dey lacks the grace to admit his debt. Even if he lacks the grace, he must be honest to admit his ignorance and /or expertise. Atanu Dey, by implication, is implying that other State education systems are better.

For instance, that of the USA.

Which is simply not a fact. At least from 1983, during[the time President Reagan](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/school-turnaroundsreform/how-ronald-reagan-affected-tod.html "Ronald Reagan's impact on education today |  By Valerie Strauss  |  Posted at 11:46 AM ET, 02/ 6/2011 "), the[state of the US education](http://www.cato.org/research/education/articles/reagan.html "Reagan’s ABCs  by Dan Lips  |  cato.org")system has been[a matter of great concern](http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/NatAtRisk/risk.html "A Nation At Risk - April 1983  |  Summary of US Govt. National Commission on Excellence in Education on August 26, 1981"). And if he not implying that, he must state how things are equally bad in the rest of the world.

Why just pick on India.

[![This may not quite be the State of US Education - but only an anecdote.](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/PALai5dSVljiz8Z-u6kmYr5lBnGV5AfP6x87KLc0annYA2OfZ3eX7LQTmQjvtGrh8XStNnWfa1g_5OsOMeq-ddbGLm0-wV29eSIC9_r70WSKjR7bCMHCZHkosBglCHc=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.cartoonstock.com/newscartoons/cartoonists/cgo/lowres/cgon394l.jpg "This may not quite be the State of US Education - but only an anecdote.")](http://www.cartoonstock.com/newscartoons/cartoonists/cgo/lowres/cgon394l.jpg "This may not quite be the State of US Education - but only an anecdote.")

This may not quite be the State of US Education - but only an anecdote.

### **Numbers talk**

Another angle.

Remember the US is dealing with[around 50 million children](http://www.schoolandstate.org/stats.htm "Did you know . . .  |   Statistics and Facts    ")in the US school system.

And India?

Dealing with 500 million of chidren, is the task that the Indian education system has to handle.

US is the largest economy of the world. India is 10% of the US economy (in nominal terms). Little more actually.

So, we are talking of a 1000% bigger task with 10% of the GDP. Roughly. Exact numbers will be somewhat different.

Size matters – in case Atanu Dey forgets.

Interestingly,[there are some](http://m.mumbaimirror.com/index.aspx?Page=article&sectname=News%20-%20Nation&sectid=3&contentid=20080205200802050202531219eebafdf "Japan wants Indian maths teachers  |  Japanese believe that Indians are the best in the world when it comes to teaching the subject  |  IANS  |  Posted On Tuesday, February 05, 2008 at 02:02:53 AM")500 Indian[teacher’s in Japan](http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fs20100415a3.html "Thursday, April 15, 2010  |  Why do English teachers have to be native speakers? |  English-language schools in Japan are changing stereotypes by proving that good teaching is not about nationality  |  By MELINDA JOE |  Special to The Japan Times"), teaching children, using methods that[the Japanese want to learn](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/business/worldbusiness/02japan.html?pagewanted=all "Losing an Edge, Japanese Envy India’s Schools |  By MARTIN FACKLER |  Published: January 2, 2008").

From Indian teachers.

### **What Atanu Dey does not know or forgets**

The[**issues with Indian education**](http://quicktake.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/freeing-higher-education-in-india/ "Freeing higher education in India By 2ndlook")are really the use of English**[language in higher education](http://quicktake.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/english-the-language-of-progress/ "English – The language of progress? By 2ndlook")**. English language closes doors to higher education, for all native language users – which is roughly 90% of India.

The other related question is[**how long will**](http://quicktake.wordpress.com/2010/10/31/escape-to-the-west-indian-taxpayers-cost/ "Escape to the West @Indian Taxpayers’ cost By 2ndlook")[**the dominance**](http://quicktake.wordpress.com/2010/10/31/escape-to-the-west-indian-taxpayers-cost/ "Escape to the West @Indian Taxpayers’ cost By 2ndlook")of English language last? What after that. Now, these are questions that Atanu Dey should ask and answer.

Being an economist?

### **I am not forgetting**

The real issue is the delivery model for education that the world must adopt.

The answer, my friend (figure of speech!) is what Shri (Sir) Philip Hartog, Vice Chancellor of Dhaka University (then Dacca) learnt from Gandhiji.

Something that research by Dharampal confirmed – and**[of late, a British researcher discovered](http://quicktake.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/what-kapil-sibal-does-not-know-and-hurts-us/ "What Kapil Sibal does not know and hurts us By 2ndlook")**again.

Indian private sector education model is the best.
