Dear colleagues



**Hereby I am inviting you to become member of the web list/group[bvpar...@googlegroups.com]()**(भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्).



Main objective of this group is to protect the Indian intellectual tradition and further nourish it so this tradition takes a step ahead.



It is well known fact that Samskrita scholarship is the backbone of the Indian culture, being the main factor that makes Indian culture so unique in comparison with other cultures, and is in a difficult state, if not in total danger of extinction, unless we do not take war foot to protect it. We, the Samskrita scholars, are very fortunate to be in the present situation (with all good modern facilities for writing, communication, printing etc.), after centuries of foreign barbaric rule, brutal colonial policies that made Samskrita nearly extinct, where there is no fear of external invasion, dependency, poverty (tosomeextent) etc. With Indian economy booming in recent years, Governmental funding agencies ready to provide the grants to any extent to fund projects in universities and research institutes, there is no dearth of grants. Hence I think this is the besttimeto do something more. No more, we (being in Universities with sixth and more pay commissions) can lodge complaint, which was very much a thing of daily order for the scholars of previous generations, on the lack of funds to work on these lines. Hence we need to takesomevery urgent steps to go forward.



To achieve this goal this group aims to bring all the Samskrita scholars of subcontinent on a single platform so that they can share their ideas, projects, publications, positions, news, events and so forth. All Samskrita scholars/ scholars working in areas related to Samskrita can communicate with each other through this group culminating in the dissemination of knowledge in a more easy and fastest way. It can create a much needed awareness on what is happening on the other parts of this vast country where nobody is aware on who is working on what projects and where and more importantly we are simply ignorant of mere existence of many institutions. Where is the consolidated data of what is happening in the whole ofIndia. Who knows how many universities have Samskrita departments exactly. Perhaps onlysomeclerks in UGC may hold the key to such questions.Nobody can easily look for the details of Telugu translation of Dhvanyaloka by Pullela Ramachandrudu or Bengali translation of Vyaptipancaka by Rajendra Ghosh. How can one student being in Garli (Himachal Pradesh) locate a book published in a remote village on Western ghat in southIndia?Similarly it is nearly impossible to avoid duplication of research in the absence of good single platform.

  

  
  

Hence the group of Bharatiya vidvat parishat was created on 1.1.2009 by like minded scholars. It is expanding day by day and we hope, it will include each and everyone of sanskrita scholars in near future.



with around 600 members now it has been able to bridge the scholarly gap. It has also been helping the young and promising scholars to be in contact with senior and learned. It is also helping us to undertake interdisciplinary research with inclusion of scholars from other related fields.

**What bvp has achieved since its inception: some opinions**



few mails from members may be able to describe the success of BVP.

  

"I really feel proud to be part of the BVP for many reasons.

It serves as a platform for scholars to share their views on

various Shastraic phenomena. BVP is the base for traditional

knowledge, which provides and exchanges its treasure

with others. It has become the source of identifying and

exchanging various rare texts among the scholars. It also

gives a scope for Kavyavinoda for the Sanskrit Poets. It

provides information about seminars, workshops etc.,

and helps to update our information. Many National

institutions like Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi,

Samskrita Bharati, etc have felt the importance of the BVP.

That is the reason; often they approach BVP for support

and information.

Though I do not actively take part in the discussion ofthe BVP, I always silently watch the discussion, enjoy

a lot, and get informed.

I wish the BVP a great success in its pursuit and to achievemany more landmarks.

I feel honoured to be a member of the club. I have immensely profitted from the discussions and postings of active participants. Even so I do not read all the mails as some of them could form part of private communication. Personal greetings and accolades fall in this category. But even such postings are neither embarrassing nor totally useless, as they inform us of some achievement on the part of someone whom we love. Just a matter of availability of time. In fact I have benifitted most from the mails and posings ftom Kalyanaraman ji, and the discussions among scholars on problems of Sanskrit grammar.

This has been a most rewarding experience for me. First of all I have come to know the names of a number of great Sanskrit scholars working in different saastras. Secondly I am impressed with the give and take that this forum has generated with a degree of mutual respect. And thirdly the chaste Sanskrit compositions are a joy to read specially for people like me who living outside the country do not get many chances to interact with fluent Sanskrit speakers. Thank you Pandurangiji for starting this wonderful forum.
