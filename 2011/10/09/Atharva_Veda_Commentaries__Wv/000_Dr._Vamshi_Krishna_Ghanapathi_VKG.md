Dear Scholars!

  

I would like to know the availability and existence of Commentaries (Bhaashyam) for Atharva Veda Texts. Apart from Shounaka Shaakha, does some one has any commentary to any other Shaakha, such as Paippalaada Shaakha (Prevalent in Orissa/ Jharkhand)??

  

If some one has, we would like to photocopy/ scan the text for a project.  
  
With Warm Regards  
Dr.Vamshi K Ghanapaathi
