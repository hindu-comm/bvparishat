Commentaries in languages other than Sanskrit are available for the Paippālda-Saṃhitā kāṇḍa 2 by Thomas Zehnder (German), kāṇḍa 5 by A. Lubotsky (English), kāṇḍas 6-7 by A.Griffiths (English). There is also an English transl. of the thirteenth kāṇḍa published, as far as I remember, in the USA but I lack the details. All these studies are based on the 1997 edition of the first volume comprising the first 15 kāṇḍas by the present writer which was published by the Asiatic Society, Calcutta.

Durgamohan Bhattacharyya’s 1964, 1970 edition (Sanskrit College, Calcutta)of the first four kāṇḍas was endowed with Sanskrit commentaries on selected difficult verses.

In the said new Asiatic Society edition kāṇḍas 1-15, 1997, kāṇḍa 16 (2008), kāṇḍas 17-18 (2011) there are extensive treatment in Sanskrit of difficult readings in the critical apparatus and in English in the Introductions to these works.

The 19^(th) and the 20^(th) kāṇḍa are likely to come out within a year with the said features.
