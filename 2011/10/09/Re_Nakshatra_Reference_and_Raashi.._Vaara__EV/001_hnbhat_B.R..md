Thanks for the very sincere opinion. I had also the same opinion in respect of many *mantra*-s used in daily worships also. For example, the popular Vedic Mantra गणानां त्वा गणपतिं is taken as the *mantra*for invoking गणपति in the पञ्चायतन system, presumably the son of शिव of Purana-s, depicted as Vakratunda, etc. whereas the Vedic deity as per the commentators is ब्रह्मणस्पति. Taking asसर्वं ब्रह्ममयम्, there is not anything odd in accepting any Vedic mantra, but clearly here it is based on the similarity of the name. There are many examples of the same type. याज्ञिक school is a different school of interpretation as mentioned in निरुक्त which has got its own way of interpretations and निरुक्ति for any word based on context.

  

As it happens, ब्राह्मण texts are fore-runners of our पुराण legends, the legends consideredstrictlyas अर्थवाद by commentators for glorifying the topic mentioned. This is what I understand with my limited knowledge of Vedic Literature. Traditionally, "इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदार्थमुपबृंहयेत्।" is the direct expression of the view that the purpose of पुराण-s is to popularize the contents (=religion?) of Veda if I am right in interpreting in the above often quoted piece in the commentaries.
