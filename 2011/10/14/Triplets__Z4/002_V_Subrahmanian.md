Thanks for the reply. Is यमळ exclusively used to indicate twin offsprings alone? Is त्रिकम् an exclusive term for indicating triplets or does the word have application in other contexts too? For example we can say शमादिषट्कम् .  
Even if we say त्रयाणामपत्यानां सङ्घस्य स पिता, is it not possible that one can understand it as : 'This man has three children of different ages.' ?  
  
Regards.
