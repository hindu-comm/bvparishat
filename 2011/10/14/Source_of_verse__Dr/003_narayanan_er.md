Thank you Dr. Patel for putting it in your site for the scholarly interest. Due to your site, a large number of people with Sanskrit interest can search words, phrases, passages and verses from the respective texts.  

The index of the Dhavanyaloka Locana with Balapriya published from Chowkhabha, Varanasi (1925 ??) is giving some sources for the quoted in both D and L. The index of R.P. Dwivedi version of the Vyaktiviveka too gives some sources for the verses quoted. But for the case of this verse it is not right to assume that it might be from any of the Puranas, or from the Mahabharata etc., without knowing correct source.  

My friend Shri. Shrivathsa has confirmed that this verse neither nor belonged to padma, brahma, bhAgavatam, nArada, kUrma, linga, and viShNu. Thank you Shrivathsa.  

So I repeat the quote of Mahimabhatta, with the original source curiousity:

अयाचितानि देयानि सर्वद्रव्याणि भारत!।  
अन्नं विद्या दया कन्या अनर्थिभ्यो न दीयते।।

Thanks to all scholars of the group.
