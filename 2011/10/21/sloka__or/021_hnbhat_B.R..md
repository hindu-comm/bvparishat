One more line of thinking about the वेदान्तडिण्डिम. Unless it is specifically mentioned in the colophon, it is of authorship. Like this there is another instance in Stotra Literature. There is a single verse in the श्रीकृष्णकर्णामृत २.५८ करारविन्देन पदारविन्दं मुखारविन्दे विनिवेशयन्तम्।

वटस्य पत्रस्य पत्रस्य पुटे शयानं बालं मुकुन्दं मनसा स्मरामि॥

  

and another set of the similar verses adding descriptions the different phases of बाललीला of कृष्ण is compiled by some andsometimesascribed to लीलाशुक also. In this case, supposing ब्रह्मज्ञानवल्लीमाला had the 4 verses consequently and it is still possible some one compiled enhancing the number of verses with similar ideas all ending with वेदान्तडिण्डिमः appropriating the name to the work. According to Korada Subrahmanyam, the work is also attributed to शंकराचार्य and published in the collection of प्रकरण-s.

  

The cases are similar. In one, it acquired the shape of बालमुकुन्दाष्टकम् in its enhanced version अष्टक, whereas in the middle of the 2nd शतक it fits well among all the similar descriptions. This one particularly corresponds to other PurANa-s also. The compiled one with the sole purpose of exposition of बाललीला-s of कृष्ण. In this case, 4 verses enlarged to 94 verses i.e. nearly शतक. This is just a guess on the similarity of the two instances.
