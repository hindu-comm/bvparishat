As the above link cites the second half followed by VedantaDinDima:

  

  

As it appears in the context quoted, but it only emphasizes the घोषणा as सर्ववेदान्तडिण्डिमः - makes it equal to सर्व-वेदान्तघोषणा rather than a name of any author.डिण्डिमः is a trumpet or drum used for announcement of any order of the king. दंबडी is the regional word given by महेश्वर. Literally here it means the loud announcement or assertion of all the Vedanta-Shastra.

  

As the original has already has seen this context, his question is inquisitive of its collocation with the other half found on the net in many places especially in this:

  

<http://atma.sulekha.com/mp/tagdisplay.aspx?tagtitleurl=bhajagovindam>

  

and

  

<http://atma.sulekha.com/mp/tagdisplay.aspx?tagtitleurl=Brahman>

  

and also :

  

<http://hariomgroup.net/hariombooks/satsang/Hindi/SadhanaMeinSafalata.htm>

  

The first half is collocated with another half cited in my earlier posting:

  

श्लोकार्धेन*प्रवक्ष्यामि यदुक्तं ग्रन्थकोटिभिः*।

परोपकारः पुण्याय पापाय परपीडनम्\|\|

  

Now the question becomes specific who swapped the second half each other. The last blog ascribes it to Srishankara. thats all we know. There may be many more, but without giving any source. Only 3 I could check, but none gives the source.

  

In all others, the second half is as given here above. So the question is whether the swapping is from any authentic source or done by the bloggers in their blogs fancifully ascribing it to Shankara?

  

It is easy to swap halves of verses with any popular halves independent of each other.
