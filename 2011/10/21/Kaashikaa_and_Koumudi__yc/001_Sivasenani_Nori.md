As it were, today I heard our Principal (of Arts College, O. U.), Sri Prof. T. Keshavanarayana explain how in his gurukul (in North India, affiliated to the Arya Samaj), how they would first read the Prathamaa vritti, then the dviteeyaa vritti, and then the Mahabhashya.

  

Prathamaa vritti is by Yudhishtir Mimamsak and Dviteeyaa vritti is actually the Kaashikaa.
