Sir

  

The actual sloka in Amarakosha is

  

एधा समृद्धौ स्फुरणे स्फुरणा प्रमितौ प्रमा \|

प्रसूतिः प्रसवे श्च्योते प्राधारः क्लमथः क्लमे \|\|

  

'pramitau pramaa' is the part we are interested in. In plain language it means, in the sense of 'pramiti', pramaa is used. So, the question arises: 'what is pramiti?' Different commentators answer this differently.

  

For instance, Mahesvara says: प्रमितिः प्रमा द्वे यथार्थज्ञानस्य. (We need to assume the remaining word, नामनी)

  

I follow the Gurubaalaprabodhikaa, which essentially says the same. There is another book in Telugu (author not mentioned by the publishers) which gives meanings in three languages - Telugu, English and Hindi. The English entry against these two words reads: 'true knowledge'.

  

That the two words mean the same has been shown by Dr. Sri Hari Narayana Bhat by deriving them from the root maa\~N (to measure), preceeded with the upasarga 'pra'.

  

Now, there can be a doubt that if pramaa itself means yathaarthjnaanam (following Mahesvara) or true knowledge, how could there be a word called pramaa-jnaanam, which if expanded means yathaartha-jnaana-jnaanam? This doubt can be removed by the following extract from Tarkabhaashaa, a prakaraNa grantha of nyaaya.

  

प्रमाकरणं प्रमाणम्। अत्र च प्रमाणं लक्ष्यं, प्रमाकरणं लक्षणम्।

  

ननु प्रमायाः करणं चेत् प्रमाणं तर्हि तस्य फलं वक्तव्यम्, करणस्य फलवत्त्वनियमात्। सत्यम्। प्रमैव फलं साध्यमित्यर्थः। यथा छिदाकरणस्य परशोश्छिदैव फलम्।

  

का पुनः प्रमा, यस्याः करणं प्रमाणम्। उच्यते। यथार्थानुभवः प्रमा। यथार्थ इति अयथार्थानां संशय-विपर्यय-तर्कज्ञानानां निरासः। अनुभव इति स्मृतेः निरासः। ज्ञातविषयं ज्ञानं स्मृतिः। अनुभवो नाम स्मृतिव्यतिरिक्त ज्ञानम्।

  

Notice that the naiyaayikaas have split jnaana into yathaartha and ayathaartha on one hand; and as anubhava and smriti on the other hand. So, pramaa-j\~naanam means that knowledge which is true and experienced - as opposed to knowledge which might be doubtful, untrue, or the most tenable hypothesis and knowledge which might be from remembrance rather than from immediate experience.
