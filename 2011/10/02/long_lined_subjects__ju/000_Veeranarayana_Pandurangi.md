dear all,

I request all of you to trim your subject lines so they are clearly understandable to others. recent posing by NR Joshi had a three line subject (which is certainly not acceptable).

**I call the moderaters to solve the problems.**

  

Some members getting only digest mails of BVP (which create such big subject lines) are also advised to opt for single mails in their settings of membership so single message lines can be shown and discussion goes on in one string of gmail.

  

the problem is also on the part of senders. often such messages are ignored by most members. Members have no big time to see each and every message they get. hence if you write something important out of string your mail does not reach intended readers. please help yourself and others also.
