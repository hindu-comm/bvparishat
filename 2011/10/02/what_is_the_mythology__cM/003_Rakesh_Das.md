Respected Scholars,

It seems that the British (and British-made) historians did not get the original meaning of Purana. Hence, they made Purana and Mythology synonyms. This is not a single instance. They have made the same mistake for so many concepts and words. I can remember a few like -

1\. Guru - Master

2\. Dharma - Religion

3\. Avataara - Prophet/Reincarnation (both the terms don't convey the concept avataar)

There may be so many.

Here I would like to discuss another point. i.e.(Ramayana and Mahabharata are treated as epics or Mahakavyas. But are they really Mahakavyas or they are distinguished from the real epics like Raghuvamsam etc. As these are treated as epics the characters are naturally gone to mythology as it is the trend in the west. There mythological characters mainly occurs in the epics Iliad and Odyssey. Ramayana and Mahabharata are also treated as epics. Hence, the mistake.
