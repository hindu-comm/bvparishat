***Respected scholars,***

***As far as I know the English dictionary meaning of Mythology is "False theological accounts". The English encyclopedias elaboarate the meaning as "False theological accounts as opposed to the only true theological account, i.e. birth of Jesus from a virgin."***

***It is clear that the word and the meaning were created to preserve (?) and humiliate the Pagan religious narrations. When the Europeans, for political reasons, were forced to respect the alien religions like Judaism, Buddhism, Islam etc. "mythology" was defined as "sacred narrations". The implication remains that those narrations need not be true.***

***This definition has given the Europeans, and their Indian followers, the moral courage to frimly believe that your Puranas and Itihasas are all false. Not only Lord Rama and Lord Krishna, but also Lord Buddha belongs to this category.***

***The first, and probably the most significant, falsification is about the date of Kurukshetra battle of Mahabharata, which according to the Puranana took place around 3138 BC and according to our modern history books around 1470 BC (if at all).***

***Similarly according to the Puransa, as corroborated by the Buddhist accounts, Lord Buddha lived from 1886 BC to 1806 BC and our modern scholars(?) doggedly stick to the dates 562 BC to 482 BC (?).***











***Regards.***

***Yours truly,***
