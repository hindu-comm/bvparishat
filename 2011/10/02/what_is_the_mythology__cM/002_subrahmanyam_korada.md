Mythology  
  
Unfortunately the word ' myth ' is closer to ' mithyA ' .  
  
Just like in the case of ' Theory ' , wherein one can have both good / bad , in the case of Mythology also Westerners have good and bad .  
  
**SiddhAnta.h - ante siddha.h siddhAnta.h , vAdiprativAdibhyAm nirn.Ito'rtha.h siddhAnta ityucyate . ApasiddhAnta is not SiddhAnta at all .  
  
KathA ( vAda , jalpa and vitan.d.a ) in NyAyadars'anam (AdhyAya 1 ) or
VAda ( jalpa and vitan.d.a) in CarakasamhitA (VimAnasthAnam) are useful in deciding the SiddhAnta .  
  
This is as good or as bad as Aryan Invasion Theory ( Oxford - Aryan : a Sanskrit word ! ) .  
**  
In order to generate a feeling of inferiority in the minds of Indians ( in all matters) the Westerners started using the term to refer to Itihasas and Puranas , even Upanisads .  
  
That's why the restriction - do not teach to everybody - refer to AdhyAsabhAs.ya of SamkarAcArya - s'amadamAdisampatti.h etc .  
  
The word Mythology denotes the meaning - ' not true ' / gossip etc.. 
MithyA means it is there but not true - brahma satyam jaganmithyA ( VedAntad.ind.ima.h ) .  
  
Sanskrit scholars of earlier generations did not have the knowledge of
English and they did not even know what was happening to the culture .  
  
'May his soul rest in peace " - even some Sanskrit scholars inadvertently use this . If Atma has got 's'Anti' then it should have 'as'Anti' also .  
  
May God bless you - can't you bless - at least 's'ubham bhUyAt' .
