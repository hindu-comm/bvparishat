dear all, abhivaadya.

what is the mythology? (as used byMcComas Taylor etc. in'MythologyWars')  

where is the clear cut line between satyalogy (sic? intentional) and mythology?

does this word myth say mithya as understood by Advaitasiddhi or something else?

if Rama and Krishna are sent to mythology as taught by old professors, (as one of our peethadhishji in JRRSU told audience on mahabharta facts), then who is there to survive in satyalogy? does buddha come there? what is pramana that he existed sometimes around 2600 BC? what is pramana in accepting the existence of Jesus etc?

in case if you put forward some stone inscription or somehting to prove someone's existence, there arises the doubt as to thisstone inscription may be a part conspiracy to make something real (like the literary evidence which is thrown away as part of imagination)

  

  

this is to think how long we will be teaching our students of mythology?
