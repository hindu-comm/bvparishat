There are usages like 'mithyAchAraH', 'mithyaiSha vyavasAyaste' etc. in the Bhagavadgita where the above meaning does not fit. Here is a verse from a kAvya:  
  
<http://www.khapre.org/portal/url/sa/sahitya/kalavilas/z110914111725%28%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8.%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%97.%E0%A5%A8%29.aspx>  
तच्छ्रुत्वा विकसितदृग्वदति स **मिथ्यैव** नाटयन्खेदम् ।  
कार्ये प्रसारिताक्षः पुनः पुनः पार्श्वमवलोक्य ॥१२॥   
  
Of course, on another note, that which is finite, anitya, is asatya according to Shankarachary's commentary in the Taittiriya Upanishad:  
  

यद्रूपेण यन्निश्चितं तद्रूपं न व्यभिचरति, तत् सत्यम् । यद्रूपेण यन्निश्चितं तत् तद्रूपं व्यभिचरति, तदनृतमित्युच्यते । अतो *विकारोऽनृतम्*, ’वाचारंभणं विकारो नामधेयं मृत्तिकेत्येव सत्यम्’, एवं *सदेव सत्यम्* इत्यवधारणात् ।

//As for satyam, a thing is said to be satyam, true, when it does not change the nature that is ascertained to be its own; and a thing is said to be unreal when it changes the nature that is ascertained to be its own. Hence a mutable thing is unreal, for in the text, ‘All transformation has speech as its basis, and it is name only. Clay as such is the reality.’ (Chandogya Up. 6.1.4), it has been emphasized that, that alone is true that Exists (Ch.Up. 6.2.1)//
