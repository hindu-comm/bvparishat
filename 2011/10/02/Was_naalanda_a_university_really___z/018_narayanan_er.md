Respected Professor Pandurangi,

Eradication of any dharma, I feel, is impossible. They appear to be in various changed forms through various era. Conversion is only possible when some one is ignorant about any dharma, persuaded for any temporary or monitory gains, like Yama persuading Naciketas in Katha.Upanisad: ये ये कामा दुर्लभा मर्त्यलोके सर्वान् कामान् छन्दतः प्रार्थयस्व. When Dalai Lama himself is finding difficult maintain his own ideology in passing among his followers who are very a few in number right across the world, how can he convert, and if converts, what is the use with such people for any of the dharma in the world? If we look at the Vaipulyasutras of the Mahayana tradition, composed (or revealed to the monks) in a non-standardized type of Sanskrit like the Saddharmapundarikasutra, the Divyacudaprakasha, the Divyaavdaana, the Divyamakandika etc. etc. Yes, there were exceptional people like Santideva who compiled the Shikshasamuccaya, logicians like Asanga, Nagarjuna etc., and still they failed to establish their dharma for generations chiefly due to the disinterest of the Bhikshus on learning traditional sastras rather than roam around for food and enjoy the temporary pleasures which Buddha was warning against. The Pali tradition of the other (\*\*\*\*) Yana or the Theravada Buddhism flourished in South-East Asia but outside India.

  

If any tradition has got the treasures like Vedic and Puranic standard one can follow them not blindly but at least understanding the utility for any society. If you refute them knowingly or unknowingly you should have an adequate background of any other dharma with you which should not be fragile in ideology. If we simply compare the literature of the Puranas with any of the available Vaipulyasutras of Sanskrit tradition of Buddhism, you will easily understand the standard of learning interest of the Bhikshus of that time.  

  

The Semitic group of religions too convert people right across the world, forcefully or by taming. Even mass hysteria can convert a mob of people like ducks, cows and buffaloes (गड्डलिकाप्रवाहन्यायः). But no dharma is under threat. William Jones to Max Muller studied Sanskrit with a view to converting in their mind. But no dharma is under threat. Yes, Dalai Lama has to follow some norms what the United States Government does a back seat drive, he may speak against India, no problem. Whatever be number of the converted, millions of them might be, are so fragile in thinking any idea, then what to speak of any threat from them to any of the dharmas in the world?
