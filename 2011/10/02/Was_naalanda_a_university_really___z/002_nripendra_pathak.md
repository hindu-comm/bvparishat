Dear Sir,

namaste.

buddist guru Dharmapal and Chandragupta's guru Chanakya were there and their contributions are well accepted. even Kumaril Bhatta (becoming pracchanna bauddha) learnt Buddhist theory form Dharmapal. After learning the buddhist philosophy, hedebated with Dharmapaland restablished Brahmanical Philosophy. Many Historian wrote about Nalanda and you can also find manyarchaeological proves for the same.

thank you.
