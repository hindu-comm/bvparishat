Vasudhaiva KuTumbakam has been our motto.Let us never come down from that ideal.Let us accept Lord Buddha's message of

 AhiMsa,Lord Mahavra's message of anekantavaada,Shri AdiShankaraacaarya's message of Advaita along with "saty api bhedaapagame Naatha Tavaa'haM na maamakiinas tvaM" .I see no difference in Shanka``ra,Ramanuja,Ramananda,Madhva,Vallabha ,

AbhinavaGupta,Ramananda ,Kabira and other acaryas who have been guiding us to maintain the wholistic view of life as exemplified by Vivekananda,Shri Aurobindo and othe acaryas of the east and the west.All taken togethr have been inspiring us to lead a wholistic view of Life.
