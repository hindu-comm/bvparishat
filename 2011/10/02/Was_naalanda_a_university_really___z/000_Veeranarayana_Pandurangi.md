dear friends, Happy Navaratri parva.

  

my posting is related to older nalanda rather than new one.

I have been baffled by this question for long"Was naalanda a university really"

if it was a great university then I want to get some names of professors/acharyas who taught there for centuries.

what was the significant contribution they gave?

it is easy to praise that was so and so and so on. but are there any real pramanas to establish that it was university teaching different subjects as claimed by modern buddhists? what were the secular subjects (as claimed by many advocates now)?  

  

Was naalanda a university really or it was a vihar of bauddha saadhus who enjoyed the royal partonage and roamed freely? only few dedicated to the studies of buddhism, some ayurveda, bauddha mantra shastra, and bauddha religion.
