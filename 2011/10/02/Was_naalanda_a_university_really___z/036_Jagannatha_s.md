AryAh., svasti /

  

The word viSvavidyA\[ni\]laya in the sense of University is very modern and there is no doubt. The universities were called as ghat.ikAsthAnas
in ancient times according to so many references in the articles on ancient Universities. So Nalanda University was a ghat.ikAsthana. What is ghat.ikA ? Was it timemeasuring devise ? Convocation is called ghat.ikotsava. If ghat.ikA is time measuring devise, how does the word ghat.ikotsavaconvey the meaning of convocation? Where does the word Ghat.ikAsthAna occur? In inscriptions? I recall a different
interpretation of ghat.ikA given to me by late Professor Sri Jambunathan. He had told that there are plenty of references regarding universitiesin ancient Tamil literature. Advanced students were told to pick a slip from a jar in which a subject was written. The students had to talk on the subject instantly. No doubt, it is \`\`pick and speak''. The jar from which students would pick the subject-slip was called ghat.ikA. The place or building in which these ghat.ikAs were placed were called ghat.ikAsthAna.

To what extent theseinterpretationsare true?
