Respected Sir,

Namaste.

Chanakya as a guru, governed the maurya samrat Chandragupta. TakShaShila is far away from Patliputra. Sir, I want to understand the governing relation of takShashila and patliputra, the capital of magadh. Can we logically denie Chankya's presence in Nalanda?

regards

Nripendra
