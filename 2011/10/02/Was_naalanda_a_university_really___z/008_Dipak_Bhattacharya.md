Dear Colleagues

That Śīlabhadra was a teacher at Nālandā is included in the information supplied by the link but Dīpaṅkara is stated as having belonged to the Vikramaśīla Mahāvihāra. That too was an institution of learning. Dīpaṅkara was much later. It is possible that Nālandā had already witnessed decline. Obviously either my information on Dīpaṅkara was defective or I made an error. I stated in the mail from memory which might have caused partial error. I will check. But at least one Professor’s name is known. Also is known that a big institute at Nālandā offered education. The ruins at Nālandā, after all, are not mythical. The small rooms are inferred as having served as hostels. This is plausible.

Brahminism too developed institution based studies. The ghaṭikās or ghaṇṭikās have been treated by late D.C.Sircar. But these developed much later. Amalānanda refers to some of them. It is inferable that the *maṭha*s too arranged for teaching.

More popular and prevalent, at least in Bengal, was study followed by degree (title) based on personal teaching by scholars recognized by the state/king. If the teacher died the student faced great difficulties. As I heard from my teachers, Gadādhara Bhaṭṭācārya did not get a title because his teacher had died in harness.

This type of personal teaching by recognized paṇḍitas was definitely a state of affairs not alien to Buddhism. A text in a Gilgit manuscript (this I can confirm though the book is not immediately with me) describes in detail some teachers recognised by the king and enjoying right over land.
