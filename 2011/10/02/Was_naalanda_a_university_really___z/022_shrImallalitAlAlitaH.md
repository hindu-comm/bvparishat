I don't think that many who study sanskrit have any inclination towards dharma which is stated by veda-s. They seem to be neutral.  
Unless one has studied veda-s and determined it's prAmAnyam, it will be like this. You can't expect people relishing vyAkaraNam and sAhitya to come forward to bother about this. They simply can't understand it properly.  
This is subject of philosopher with wide-opened eyes. I think you are at wrong place and so I'm.
