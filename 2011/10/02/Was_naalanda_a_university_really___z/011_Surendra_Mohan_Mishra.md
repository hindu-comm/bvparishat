Esteemed Scholars,  

Recently I had an opportunity to be at the Nava Nalanda Mahavihar for about five days and had occasion to visit the site of the ancient Nalanda University which was simply magnificent.

It had a 7×7miles campus withas many as 101 subjects being taught,which we could compare to depts or schools in a university at present.Not only Buddhism but the Vedas including the Atharva Veda were also taught.It was the place where the definitive battle between the S'uunyavaadins and the Vij\~naanavaadins was carried out.

A number of great Budddhist scholars gathered there as preceptors out of whom a few have been named in the earlier postings.The number of the teachers was about 1200 and 12 times more was the number of the students.

The remains of the huge structures are an archaeological and sculptural marvel that speak of the ancient academic design and ethos in India up to 11-12th C.E.

There is published literature on the glory of Nalanda and on those who contributed to it.

Best regards,

smmishra
