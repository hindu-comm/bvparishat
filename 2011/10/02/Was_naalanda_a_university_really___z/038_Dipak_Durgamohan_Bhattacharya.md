Dear Colleague,

Ghaṇṭikāsthānas referred to by D. C. Sircar was mentioned by me in a previous mail, the first or the second one. Please see the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā of the Atharvaveda, The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, 1997, Introduction , p.xlix, text relating to endnote 39. It deals with Amalānanda (*Kalpataru*) referring to Atharvaṇī śrutis recited in ghaṇṭikāsthānas. Appaya Dīkṣita (*Parimala*) further elaborates which too has been quoted in the Introduction by me. 

Best

DB
