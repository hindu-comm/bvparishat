I got the following information from internet :

Sri K Krishnamacharyulugives areference of ghat.ikAsthAna in his book, \`Inscriptions of Nagari'.(Ref.\`Education in Ancient India' by Hartmut Scharfe).



Sri Dinesh Chandra Sircar, in his \`Indian Epigraphical glossary ',
gives the meaning of ghat.ikAsthAna(Epigraphica Indica 14,16) as \`a religious centre, the official meeting place of learned and godly men'.

Hementions another word ghat.ikASAlA(Epigraphica Indica 25 ) and the meaning of which is \`an establishment of holy and learned man'.

This meaning is very near to viSvavidyA(ni)laya.

Two questions:

1.Is there any reference of ghat.ikAsthAna/ ghat.ikASAlA in sAhitya or SAstric work ?

2.What about ghat.ikotsava?
