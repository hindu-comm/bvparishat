why there is a doubt that Nalanda was a university? It was a free-style university with strict discipline and rules of admission. Its faculty constituted a number of sastras both Hindu and non-Hindus. special stress was on the buddhism. visitors from all over the world read; transmitted the knowledge and went away. there was no restriction of the degree. You may get it or listen to the discourses. but admission was difficult. It provided everything for study, stay and food. Regards, spnarang
