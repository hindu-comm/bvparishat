1\. one needs to understand/estimate the time of three months to burn the what amount of books. on a modest account the whole library of congress can be burnt by maximum one week. I hope the Nalanda library might not be bigger than LOC.

  

2\. if we believe the accounts of[Xuanzang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuanzang "Xuanzang")and others then we would be left counting universities in india.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuanzang>gives an account of nearly 31500 in various places from kabul to Kamarupa plus several thousands in nalanda. this vast number of scholars would have created a very large number of works if it really existed at all. it does not seem the case. his accounts claim there were some 10000 to 700 hundred resindent monks in those viharas. what these monks did? it is a big question. Mostly these monks studied buddhism and other shastras needed for the study of buddhism like Vyakarana some sahitya etc. But it is difficult to believe that they also studied veda etc. what was the main purpose of buddhism studies? they wanted eradicate the sanatan/Brahman (what western people prefer to call) tradition and tried very hard to do it. but ultimately It failed in its aim.

  

it is unfortunate that even today buddhism tries to eradicate sanatan dharma. Dalai Lama is using his post of the head of the tibetan state to encourage the conversion into buddhism. being the head of the state he recieves more attention and coverage than that is usually given to the religious heads. this thing should be discussed at apropriate levels by concerned authorities.
