I visited Nalanda ( NAlanda -may be right) in June 2009 . Although I did not take down any notes , the structures of Classrooms , living rooms , Caityas etc. as well as the literature on the boards provides ample evidence to believe that there was a Seat of Higher Learning and Subjects like Vyakaranam , Jyotisam etc were being taught for indigenous as well as foreign students .  
  
As usual , the Muslim Invaders (Khiljis) ruined everything - how come a dog , which licks a piece of leather (chappal) , knows the sweetness of sugarcane ? (Telugu Proverb) .
