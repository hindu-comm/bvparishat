\> 1. one needs to understand/estimate the time of three months to burn the what amount of books. on a modest account the whole library of congress can be burnt by maximum one week. I hope the Nalanda library might not be bigger than LOC.

I wonder where the figure of one week is arrived at, in connection with the Library of Congress. I am not personally aware of any relevant peer-reviewed literature. Books like \`An Introduction to Fire Dynamics' by Drysdale do not usually cover durations of complex fires or the effects of arson, and it might be rather difficult to arrive at a reasonable scientific model and simulation that would have predictive value.

\> 2. if we believe the accounts of Xuanzang and others then we would be left counting universities in india.

What if we believe the महाभाष्य's claim ग्रामे ग्रामे काठकं कालापकं च प्रोच्यते (under तेन प्रोक्तम्, IV-3-101), so clearly not the situation today? Else we would have to conclude that Patanjali was also making it up as he went along, though doing so would have been pointless as people around him at the time would have rejected such a claim if it were false.

\> it is unfortunate that even today buddhism tries to eradicate sanatan dharma. Dalai Lama is using his post of the head of the tibetan state to encourage the conversion into buddhism. being the head of the state he recieves more attention and coverage than that is usually given to the religious heads. this thing should be discussed at apropriate levels by concerned authorities.

I am not convinced that is a fair appraisal of the Dalai Lama as a person, or of his religion or nation. In fact, I wonder what reason exists to believe that the Dalai Lama has ever tried to convert anyone in India to his religion, or what end anyone could suggest that he would achieve by such efforts. His major concern is, and has been for over a half century, the annexation of his homeland by the Chinese and the brutal subjugation and ethnic cleansing, with nary a murmur of objection from the rest of the world, that his people are being subjected to. The Dalai Lama's activities in India are quite restricted (he needs the government's permission even to visit specific cities, attend events, etc.), an uneasy relationship that he has endured with a lot of dignity for so long -- the government under Nehru accepted the annexation of Tibet, and two generations of leaders since then have continued the folly though detrimental to India's national interests.

I personally believe that the Dalai Lama deserves a lot of credit for staying relevant in changing times, and for being able to continue to serve as an important mentor and inspiration to his suffering people. I do not flatter myself that I would be able to replicate his achievements, and unfortunately, see no sign that any of our many Babas and Swamis are capable of it either. Also, lest we forget, the Dalai Lama has unquestioned personal integrity -- he has never been accused of personal corruption or wrongdoing (except by the Chinese government's propaganda machinery, which uses profane adjectives to describe him without attempting any clear justification), unlike many of our Babas and Swamis whose shenanigans are well known.

On the subjects of (coerced) conversions or such misbehavior, it is doubtful if Buddhists of any kind have been major culprits in recent times (Ambedkar et al. notwithstanding). D.R. Chanana and D.D. Kosambi have documented Buddhists' past misdeeds (including some disturbing and cruel crimes) and the role played by the same in the near-eradication of Buddhism from India (a matter not covered in standard history syllabi, which typically ignore the causes and details of Buddhism's flight from India). However, these authors do not seem to suggest that the Buddhists had any people like Bakhtiar Khilji, Nadir Shah, Malik Kafur, Aurangzeb, etc., even then. In more recent times, much conversion activity, including a lot of cruelty and coercion on a massive scale, has been by Christians, particularly in places like Kerala and Goa. It is worth remembering that Buddhism is dealt with at length at a scholarly level right from the ब्रह्मसूत्र literature to the later मीमांसकs like Kumarila Bhatta and Parthasarathi Mishra, showing that Buddhism was considered as a serious doctrine to be debated in scholarly circles -- a form of respect never accorded to any Abrahamic religion by the classical traditions.
