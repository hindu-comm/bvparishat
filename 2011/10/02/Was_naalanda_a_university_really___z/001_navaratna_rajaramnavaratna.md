 Good point.



 I have always felt that Nalanda has been praised indiscriminately. We know no great thinkers or schools of thought-- or thinkers like Shankara, Madhva, or Panini, Varahamihira, Aryabhata, Mahavira, etc (all scientists) from Nalanda.



 None of the great thinkers or scientists of India -- late ancient or medieval -- refers to important work or thikers from Nalanda.
