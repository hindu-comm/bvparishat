Dear Kulkarniji,

Thanks for your letter but I cannot, perhaps, rise up to your high expectations. At least I cannot claim any credit for the information on the verse *yaṃ śaivāḥ* etc. It occurs in the book Subhāṣitaratnabhāṇḍāgāra edited by Vāsudevaśāstrī Paṇaśīkare which I inherited from my father. He wrote in ink on the side of the citation *iti mahānāṭake*. This is how I came to know about the source. None of the scholars who knew the verse could enlighten me about the source.

I am greatly interested in the message of the verse which runs true to the spirit of pluralism that characterizes our culture. So I tried to consult the Mahānāṭaka but could not locate a copy in our Visva Bharati University library. There is, at least once there was, a copy in the library. If you are interested I might try again when the library opens after the Dīpāvalī and let you know. Apparently this should be the Nāndī verse.

The Mahānāṭaka, is perhaps also known as Hanumannāṭaka and, also, as Pratināṭaka in Bengal. According to my knowledge, the only person who had interest in the work was Dr. Alakananda Banrerjee. He read a paper on the Mahānāṭaka at the WSC at Bangalore. A summary was included in the *Summaries of Papers* issued by the Conference. But I do not have a copy of it with me. Dr. Banerjee sometimes told me about his idea about the book.

Regards

D.Bhattacharya
