The same NyAyasUtra has been very succinctly paraphrased in Sloka form in the ancient Saiva text, Sivadharmottara thus:



अज्ञानविनिवृत्तौ च रागादीनामसम्भवः ।

रागाद्युपशमात् पुंसां पुण्यपापपरिक्षयः ।

तत्क्षयाच्च शरीरेण न पुनः सम्प्रयुज्यते ।

अशरीरश्च सङ्क्लेशैः (सन् क्लेशैः ?)सर्वदैव न बाध्यते ।

क्लेशमुक्तः प्रसन्नात्मा मुक्त इत्यभिधीयते ।

तस्मादज्ञानमूलानि सर्वदुःखानि देहिनाम् ।



Thus, as ajnaana is the fundamental cause of all miseries, jnaana, its antiodte, is the ultimate means of liberation. In fact this is the view of Nyaaya system as well as the Pasupata Saiva school.

One may also note herethe usage of the word 'duHkha'whose 'end' ( दुःखान्त duHkhAnta)annihilation is the ultimate aim.The five fundamental principles of Paasupata school are :

कारण, कार्य, विधि, योग, दुःखान्त due to which it is known asपाञ्चार्थिकनय, पाञ्चार्थिकदर्शन . Also it is well known that the Naiyaayika-s were Saiva-Paasupata-s.



That Jnaana is the ultimate means to mukti is also expressed in a different way in the Mahaabhaarata in its divimely simple style:



       न देवा दण्डमादाय रक्षन्ति पशुपालवत् ।

      यं हि रक्षितुमिच्छन्ति बुद्ध्या संयोजयन्ति तम् ।



Such seminal views hold good for all ages and they are common to all Darshana-s, including Buddhism, where, among the आर्यसत्य-s सम्यग्ज्ञान is an important one.



One cannot but be wonderstuck by such extremely great utterances of sages such as Gautama, Vyaasa, etc. and as the inheritors of such a Sanaatanadharma, definitely , we all Bhaaratiiya-s should be proud of, and much more so, because we know at least something of the Divine language Sanskrit in which all these immortal treasures are expressed !!!!.
