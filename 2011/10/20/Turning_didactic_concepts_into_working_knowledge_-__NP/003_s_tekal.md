Namaskarams Respected Vidwans,



"... **in the case of anurAdhA , the meaning ,i.e. the one which follows 'rAdhA' (Vis'AkhA) is right , but not the derivation --**

**  
it should be ' anurAdhA ' rather than ' anUrAdhA ' , i.e. there is no provision for DIrgha -- "**



I requestyou to enlighten methe vishesha of the Veda prayoga in the quoted mantras of Yajur Brahmana wrtAnuradha as in

'anUrAdhAn havishA vardhayantah" which concurswith many other mantras/prayogas as well and which seems to sound different(??) from MaharshiPanini's sutra...
