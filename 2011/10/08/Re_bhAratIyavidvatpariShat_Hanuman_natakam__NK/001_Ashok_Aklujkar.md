The verse is present in Otto Boehtlingk's \_Indische Sprueche\_ vol. III, no.6939 p. 477 according to my notes (I do not have the volume at hand to recheck the accuracy of the note). Therefore, its composition would not be later than the second half of the 19th century. The last I heard was that it was composed by a Bengali Pandit in the late 18th or early 19th century and is inscribed at some place in Bengal.
