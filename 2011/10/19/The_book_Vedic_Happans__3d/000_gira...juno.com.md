Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



The book “Vedic Harappan” by Dr. Bhagwan Singh



This is an amazing book. This book presents new perspective on the ancient Indian history, ancient rituals, Devas, Asuras, ancient conflicts, social customs and language development and linguistic picture of ancient India. The main thesis in the bookis spread of Indo-Aryans towards western Asia due to mainly extensive trading network of ancient Indian business people and artisans. I cannot make justice in few sentences to this enormously informative book.



I have two questions to scholars of this list



One of the point appears in the book is-----perhaps Sanskrit might have arisen out of multiple languages of ancient India-or Praakrit words( in at least certain cases) could be mother of Sanskrit words. The question is this-Is it possible to show at leastin some casesSanskritization of Prakrit words had taken place in ancient India before time of PaNini-(500 BC)? I appreciate if examples are cited.



The second question is difficult.



The ancient Middle-East countries had dynasties-Babylonia, Assyria, Mitannis. Hittites, Kassites, Persians. Especially Persians repeatedly claimed they were kshatriyas. Their only job is to protect and administer the country. They were not traders. The question is -Could Middle-East dynasties rise out of Indo-Aryan traders', network spreading from India westward? No doubt ancient India was trade power. I will appreciate any input from scholars of this list. Thanks.N.R.Joshi
