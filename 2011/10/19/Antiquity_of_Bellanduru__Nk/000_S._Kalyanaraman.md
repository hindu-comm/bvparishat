The little village of Bellanduru, around which the suburb has grown, has a history that dates back 2,500 years. One of the annual reports of the Archaeological Survey of Mysore State talks of ancient Iron Age tombs discovered on the lake bund.  
  
These tombs can no longer be found intact, claimed as they are by urbanisation.

However, these burials — made of rough and irregular granite slabs of various sizes and containing large-size urns, human skeletons and small and pottery utensils — were first surveyed and excavated by Bush, a British engineer from Calcutta.  
  
Out of curiosity, when Bush opened four tombs in the 1910s, he found several iron objects, including an iron sandal, dagger, needles, human skeletons and pottery.  
  
When in 1915 the Mysore State Archaeology Department opened the other tomb, they found similar objects in it.  
  
Much like the Pyramids in Egypt, these Iron Age (or Megalithic) tombs were large graves made of boulders or slabs, with utensils and other goods placed next to the deceased.  
  
Megalithic tombs have been found in large numbers especially in south India.  
  
The Bellanduru Megalithic culture tombs are part of the Pennar river culture. Similar Megalithic tombs in Bangalore region are found at Chikkajala, Jadigenahalli, Maragondanahalli, and other places.  
  
These settlements indicate the early human settlements in Bangalore region.  
  
Another discovery, not too long ago, proved trade links between the Roman Empire and Bellandur.  
  
In 1965, as many as 256 Roman coins were discovered from HAL Airport close to Bellandur. These Roman coins belong to Roman kings Augustus and Tiberius who ruled in 100 AD.
