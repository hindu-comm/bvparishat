\> Here is the excerpt from an Islamic text :  
\>  
\> Even in arabic countries the Vedas were considered to be the main source for eternal wisdom. The Vedas were often mentioned in pre islamic poetry (in arabic language)

\> "Wahowa alamus SAMA wal YAJUR minallahay Tanajeelan Fa-enoma

\> "Bursting with (Divine) knowledge are SAM & YAJUR bestowed on

\> salvation"  
\>  
\> "Wa-isa nain huma RIG ATHAR nasayhin Ka-a-Khuwatun Wa asant  
\> Ala-udan wabowa masha -e-ratun"  
\>  
\> "Two others, the Rig and Atharva teach us fraternity, Sheltering under  
\> their lustre dispels darkness till eternity"  
\>  
\> written by Labi-Bin-E- Akhtab-Bin-E-Turfa who lived  
\> in Arabia around 1850 B.C. That was 2300 years before  
\> Mohammed!!! This verse can be found in Sair- Ul- Okul which is an  
\> anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. It was compiled in 1742 AD under  
\> order of the Turkish Sultan Salim

Can you give a proper reference for a scholarly book/paper for this, please? I have some doubts about its provenance. Modern Arabic was not a widespread language (there is no evidence that it existed in its present form) in 1850 BCE, and the first writing recognizable as Arabic is considered to be from the 4th century CE (about two centuries before Mohammad). Arabic became widespread later as it was used as the official language of Islam, but any ancient Middle Eastern writing of such vintage would probably have been in another language (which may not even exist any more).
