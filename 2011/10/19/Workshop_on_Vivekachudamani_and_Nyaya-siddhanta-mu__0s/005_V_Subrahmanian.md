This is undoubtedly a fine idea. On earlier occasions I have seen the proceedings being recorded at the auditorium at the venue. Dr. Nagasampige could kindly note this request from interested members who will be unable to attend the meet. The proceedings audio and video if possible could be recorded and put on the website of the Vidypeetha for the world-community to access. Knowledge sharing is made possible without much hassles these days.
