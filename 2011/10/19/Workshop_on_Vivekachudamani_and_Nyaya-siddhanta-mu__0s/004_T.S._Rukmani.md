I would support Dr Dutta’s idea of getting access to the proceedings in one way or the other. Please advise if that is possible. This is a wonderful opportunity to listen to stalwarts in both Nyaya and Advaita. I do hope some way is found to get it across to those of us who reside outside our homeland.
