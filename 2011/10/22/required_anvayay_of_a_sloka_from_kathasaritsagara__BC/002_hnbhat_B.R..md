4th Lambaka: Naravahanadatta-janana-lambaka:

Taranga: 3 pp.91ff. Shloka: 33:

  

तस्याभवच्च विकृता वपुषीवाशयेऽप्यलम्।

ख्याता कलहकारीति नाम्नान्वर्थेन गेहिनी॥



tasya ca = And his, gehinī = wife, (who was),

khyātā = known 

nāmnā = by the name,anvarthena = agreeing with the true meaning,kalahakārī + iti = askalahakārī (=quarrelsome) 

vapuṣi+ iva - as in body, 

āśaye 'pi = in mind also

alam = very much,vikṛtāābhavat = wasdisfigured. (crooked in mind and body as well true to her namekalahakārī)

  

This is the meaning of the precise verse in page No.92. This can be interpreted in another way also:

  

His wife was disfigured in mind and body true to her name *kalahakārī ..... ....* etc.

or

He had a wife, who was distorted in mind and body alike true to her name*kalahakārī*... .... etc.

  

I can't see any problem in it, if it is the shloka referred to above correctly. If not or if I took it for another one by mistake, please give the exact text here and it can be tried.
