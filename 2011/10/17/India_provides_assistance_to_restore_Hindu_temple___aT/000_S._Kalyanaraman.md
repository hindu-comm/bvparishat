High Commissioner of India Ashok K. Kantha signed the agreement on behalf of India with the Chairman of Thiruketheeswaram Temple Restoration Society Mr. V. Kailasapillai signed in the presence of Minister for Economic Development Basil Rajapaksa.  
  
The Indian assistance for the restoration of the Thiruketheeswaram Temple is about SLR 326 million.  
  
Issuing a statement, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said the signing of the MoU today will result in the re-initiation of the restoration work which was being carried out in the years 2005-2006 at the Thiruketheeswaram Temple, but had to be abandoned due to the then prevailing security situation.  
  
The MoU was in pursuant to the Joint Declaration issued during the state visit of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to India in June, 2010, which had welcomed the proposal for restoration of the Thiruketheeswaram Temple at Mannar to be undertaken with the assistance of the Archaeological Survey of India and the College of Architecture and Sculpture, Mamallapuram.  
  
A team led by the Superintending Archeologist, Archaeological Survey of India, Chennai Circle and consisting of representatives from the College of Architecture and Sculpture, Mamallapuram had visited Sri Lanka in August, 2010.  
  
A detailed report on the restoration of the Thiruketheeswaram Temple was prepared, based on discussions with the Department of Archaeology, Government of Sri Lanka and TTRS, in addition to inputs from their field visit to the Thiruketheeswaram temple.  
  
"The historic temple of Thiruketheeswaram is one of the holiest shrines in Sri Lanka and an important symbol of Sri Lanka's cultural Heritage. The restoration of the Thiruketheeswaram Temple in Mannar, Sri Lanka is symbolic of India's commitment to assist in the rejuvenation of the social, cultural and spiritual life in the Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka," the statement said.  
  
Governor, Northern Province Major General G. A. Chandrasiri, Millinda Moragoda, Director General, Department of Archaeology, Dr. Senarath Dissanayake, Director of Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs, trustees of TTRS and other office bearers also attended the signing ceremony.  
  
India has also been supporting projects for rehabilitation, resettlement and well-being of displaced persons in the Northern Province in the areas of shelter (through roofing sheets and cement bags), health-care (providing emergency medical relief, organizing artificial limbs refitment camps and equipping hospitals), livelihood generation (provision of fishing equipment, tractors, agricultural equipment and seeds), education (repairs of schools and setting up of vocational training centres) and infrastructure development (restoration of Northern Railway lines, rehabilitation of Palaly Airport and KKS Harbour).
