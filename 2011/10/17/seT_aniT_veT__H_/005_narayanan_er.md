Respected Scholars,

The Kashika Karikas on aniṭ is interesting not because of it is a list, but the way of its presentation makes the list attractive. Precisely those are constructed in beautiful vamshastham metre, and reciting them time and again provides happiness and once it got by-hearted it could be applied according to necessity, from one's memory. From the words of the Kashika writer like इति स्वरान्ता निपुणं समुच्चितास्ततो हलन्तानपि सन्निबोधत creates a feeling that a teacher's advice with at most affection to his disciples in an attractive tone. Personally I studied the Siddhantakaumudi partially, not grammar as main topic in my college days, and I liked दुह्याच्पदण्ड्रुधिप्रच्छिचिब्रूशासुजिमथ्मुषाम् rather than the sutra: अकथितं च because the previous one is versified in anushtubh and nice to recite as well. The beauty of the Bhattikavya, the Dhatukavya and the Vasudevavijaya is that the beauty and attraction of grammar lies on its presentation too. क्वचिद्धेनूः पयो दोग्धि types of examples in the Prakriyasarvasva too are so attractive. This is only my humble opinion. It will always be good when such important grammatical themes are presented in the metres like drutavilambita to express yamaka, whereas the dhatus sound similarly could be applied for anuprasa etc. The psychology of गुडजिह्विकान्याय was relevant and people with their poetic talent applied them effectively to attract good students with a view to maintaining and conveying the system for generations. Even not being a grammarian my attention and attraction paid on these Karikas due to their metrical form, even I am not capable to understand the meaning of these Karikas without the help of grammarians. Dryness to any verse occurs if its intention is worst, as the Mahabhashaya Paspashahnika says: भ्राजा नाम श्लोकाः। अपि श्लोकाः प्रमाणम्? यदुदुम्बरवर्णानां घटीनां मण्डलं महत्। पीतं न गमयेत् स्वर्गं etc. Normally, one should not have attraction on such dry verses, or on पञ्च पञ्चनखा भक्ष्याः etc. The practice of सस्वरवेदपाठ is a system of imitation, children not knowing the meaning imitate their tutor and apply as what they heard without books, whereas even the great Max Muller can hardly work without a manuscript. It is easy to sum up the idea in Karikas and see the Sankhyakarika in excellent maatrametre. By-hearted Karikas do the function of a pen drives of two inches which carry many GBs of electronic materials.
