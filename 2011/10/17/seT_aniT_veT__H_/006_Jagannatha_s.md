AryAh., svasti /

Sri Narayanan beautifully described his joy in reading SAstric subjects composed in verses. So many times wemarveled bythe simplicity, efficacy, beauty and at the same time, firmness in style of san.grahakArikAs. After reading posting of the learned scholar, I remembered a half verse from ***daiva.***

***  
***

***na vinA vr.ttabandhena vastu prAyen.a sugraham //***

  

This daiva is a koSa of sarUpa dhAtus. It is composed in verses.(Another work of similar type is***kavirahasya***by bhat.t.ahalAyudha )

  

Author of**daiva** is purus.ottamadeva.LILASukahas written a commentary on it. The name of commentary is **purus.akAra.**

At present I don't have this work. So I can not recall the number of the verse quoted.  

  

There is a san.grahakArikA on derivation of the word***ajarghAh.
***Even though I could not understand its meaning fully I
memorizedit because I enjoy it while reciting !

  

***gr.dher yalope lan-i ser ilope***

***haln-yAdilope rapare gun.e ca/***

***bhas.bhAvajaStve ca rurepharatve***

***d.hralopadIrghe ca bhaved ajarghAh. //***

**  
**

**(siddhAntakaumudI ed. Panashikara Vasudevasharma. Nirnayasagara press
Fourth edition 1908 p.422)**

  

If I am correct, the composer of this verse is a scholar namely Dinakarasharma, the first editor of siddhAntakaumudI who supplied footnotes . Even this verse is printed in footnotes.
