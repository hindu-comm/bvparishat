Respected Sri Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyayji,



This is really exciting information. Ihad been thinking that this story does not haveany basis of Sam.skr.ta. Now I am fully convinced that it does have its roots in Yogavasis.t.ha. I checked the reference and got marvelled on seeing the verse you shown.Your view that Homaa
mightbe apabhramsha of Vyoma is also fully convincing. Thanks a lot.
