Dear friends,

praNamyA. Very recently I looked into one of the Gmails that "A Brihat Somayaaga by the name "Atiraatra" was going to be performed at Bhadrachalam in April 2012 in the details of which it is said,a bird by the name "shyena"(An Eagle like) would appear on the sky on the last day of the programme followed by the showers of rain also.So by this statement I surmise there may be homa-birds like the bird mentioned above.  
Regrds,

ivnacharya
