Dear Shri Parameshwar Puttanmane,

  
As requested by Prof. Bhattacharya I am sending the earlier posting dated 21.10.2011 again:

  
Shri Ramakrishna used to talk to many Vedic, Tantric and other scholars and probably got this information about Homaa bird (\< Vyoma-pak.sin ?) from a Vedic Pandit. Though it is yet to be traced from any Vedic text,Yogavaashi.s.tha Ramaya.na refers to such bird:  
  
vyomnaiva jaatana.s.taanaa.m mahataa.m vyomapak.si.naam /  
 bandhunaabaddhanilayaan sharadabhrasamaak.rtiin //  

(Nirvaa.na Prakara.na, Puurvaardha 15.19)  
  
Reference to such kind of bird, it is said, may be available in J\~naaneshvarii and Daasabodha in Marathi also. \[See endnotes in the[Ramakri.s.na](http://Ramakri.s.na) Kathaam.rta(in Bengali), vol 2, 2nd ed., 6th rpt., Udbodhan Karyalaya, Kolkata, 2008\].  
  
Best  
Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
