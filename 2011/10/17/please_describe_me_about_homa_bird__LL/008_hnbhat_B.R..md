Thanks for the insight. I also had the same impression. It might have become homapakshin through improper transferring and explained as Vedic bird mentioned in Veda-s because of the corruption into "homa".



It seems to more convincing than finding a source in Vedic Literature. Or may be in some Brahmana or Aranyaka stories which abound in such stories to give etymological explanations for some names. महान् खलु शब्दराशिः ...... एतावन्तम् शब्दस्य प्रयोगविषयम्*अननुनिशम्य*सन्ति अप्रयुक्ताः इति वचनम् केवलम् साहसमात्रम्।

  

उपलब्धौ यत्नः क्रियताम्।

  

is the best policy.
