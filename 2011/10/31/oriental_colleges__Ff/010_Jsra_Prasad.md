I totally agree with your response. A couple of years back, the famous Gouthami Vidyapeetham, Rajahmandry was closed down. It was a place where *chatusshastra panditais* have taught and produced a gamut of mahamahopadhyayas. Few years back, Sambhashana Sandesha published an article stating that century old Sri Chamrajendra Sanskrit College, Bangalore is facing closure.  
  
If oriental colleges face closures, it is no wonder Departments like Sanskrit in Andhra University are in high alert.  
  
The ugly scene is that politics has vested interests in academics. In such a case, the first and foremost victim is Sanskrit language as it is not coming under the modern defitinion of 'science stream'. Of course, similar issue has been discussed in BVP, sometime ago.
