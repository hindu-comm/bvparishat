Sir,  
  
Namaste. Thanks for your insightful reply.  
You may be aware getting information from Govt. departments is not easy, unless it is demanded under RTI.  
But still, I'll convey your feeling to the concerned.  
  
Sri Sringeri Saradapeetham, conducts Shastra pareeksha for the aspirants in various Shastras in Tenali. Many eminent scholars are affiliated to the 'Tenali scheme'. Really the scheme is one of the few quality schemes for Shastra poshana under the aegis of H.H. Bharati Teertha Swamiji. Sri Bhagavatula Anjaneya Sharma coordinates on behalf of the matha. Also, there is another sabha called 'Smatha Pandita Parishad' established by H.H.Kanchi Paramacharya, some three decades ago.  
  
Shastraparampara is still living and pampered because of the noble pledge of dhrma rakshana taken by various mutts like Sringeri, Pejavar, Kanchi and so on, not merely on government efforts. तस्माच्छास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ इति स्मरन्
