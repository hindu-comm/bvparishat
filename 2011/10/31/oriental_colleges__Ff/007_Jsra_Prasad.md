Madam,  
  
I am afraid, as much as I know, no peetham is offering such courses except publishing discourses in the form of books and CDs.  
But one can obviously listen/read some of their discourses at their respective web sites -  
  
Sringeri Mutt: <http://www.sringeri.net/category/upadesha-lahari>  
Kanchi Kamkoti Mutt: <http://www.kamakoti.org/newlayout/template/hindudharma.html> (one of the best books on sanatana dharma)  
Ahobila Mutt: <http://www.ahobilamutt.org/us/acharya/upanyasam/upanyasam-ys.asp>  
Pejavar Mutt: <http://www.vishveshavani.com/category/articles/vishwa-sandesha/>  
  
Another great site on scholarly discourses in Telugu that consists speaker/subject wise content is - <http://pravachanam.com>  
  
Chinmaya International Foundation is offering E-Vedanta foundation/advanced courses.  
Details are available at <http://chinfo.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=107>  
Dr.Dilip Kumar Rana, Director, can be contact for more details \<[dire...@chinfo.org]()\>.  
  
Regards,  
Prasad
