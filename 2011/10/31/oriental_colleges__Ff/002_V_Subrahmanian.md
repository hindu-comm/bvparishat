Namaste.  
  
I think this information is best collected from the Department of Public Instruction of individual States. In fact there are a number of institutions of this type run by various Mutts. Several individual Trusts also could be running such pathashalas.  
  
The Chamarajendra Sanskrit College in Bangalore is affiliated to the Karnataka State Government. It is over a hundred years old. Sanskrit with several disciplines like Vyakarana is taught here. There is a similar college in Mysore too.  
  
There is a Shastraposhaka sabha in Andhra Pradesh (Tenali ?).   
  
The Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt is also having its own school in Tamilnadu.  
The Madras Sanskrit College is also a very old institution functioning even today teaching Vedanta, pUrva mImAmsA, etc.  
  
By making the search more elaborate and extensive one can get a lot of specific information. Undoubtedly it is a stupendous task.
