Respected scholars,

  

I need some clarification on the followings:

What is the difference between Sanskrit IDAM and ETAD ? Both denotes THIS.

  

I want to know if there is any difference in sense, does it take care or indicate of some distance or proximity ? Does IDAM indicates more close than ETAD ?

  

With regards,

Tapati Sinha
