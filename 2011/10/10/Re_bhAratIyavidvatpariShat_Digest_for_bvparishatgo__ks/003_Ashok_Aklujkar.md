Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

Thanks for the link:

You gave a specific form to my approximate recollection.

  

Dr. Pradip Bhattacharya, now a retired I.A.S. officer, is a researcher by hobby. The way he has pursued the problem should be a lesson to young Sanskritists in research methodology.

  

Does anyone have access to a modern Sanskrit/Bengali epicDiinaaja-pura-raaja-va.m;sa written byMahe;sa-candra [Tarka-cuu.daa-ma.ni](http://Tarka-cuu.daa-ma.ni)? I know that the prefatory verses of this epic are in Skt. I am not sure about the language of the rest. If the dates match, the verse api svar.namayii ... may have been taken from one ofMahe;sa-candra [Tarka-cuu.daa-ma.ni](http://Tarka-cuu.daa-ma.ni)'s works and engravedon one of the entrances to the Dakshineshwar Kali temple.

  

a.a.
