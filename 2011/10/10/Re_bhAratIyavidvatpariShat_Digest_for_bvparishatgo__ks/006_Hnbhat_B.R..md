I wonder if members have looked at this page:

These links are provided by a member of another group. The first link specifically mentions the edition in which the second half occurs.

  

This sloka is seen in the edition published by Hindi Prachara Press, Madras in 1930 by T.R. Krishna chary, Editor and T. R. Vemkoba chary the publisher.

  

But it doesn't have the first half usually found quoted with it. May some other editions or manuscripts may have it. Need to be checked in the Critical Edition interpolated verses.
