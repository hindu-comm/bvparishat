BVP Management should add some spam filters.  
  
  
I report such messages as "spam" and my Gmail will not receive any messages from the sender, even if it contains some important message. That is what I do.  

  

This happens some times, if the mail a/c of the concerned person is cracked. They should change their mail ID immediately and discontinue from membership registering with a new ID if they really want to continue. The management of BVP should take some action in this respect. Otherwise, with such spam mails, some containing virus may sometime spread through the forum also while forwarding the mails received to the list.

  

I also experienced the same many times and every time I can recognize by the title of the message and immediately without opening, report the sender as spam. In Gmail you have the option to unsubscribe and report spam or without unsubscribing one can do so. I don't know about other mail accounts.

  

In any case this warrants the serious attention of the members of the BVP Management Team and the forum.
