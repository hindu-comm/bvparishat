Hi all,

while studyingकन्यायाः कनीन च॥[४।१।११६](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/GoToSutram/4.1.116),

I learnt that the word कानीनः is used for कर्ण / व्यास ..

(Those born to a vergin)..

  

MW also shows one more entry named अग्निवेश्य also asकानीनः...

Does anyone know the story why he was called कानीन (born to a vergin) ?

(PS:<http://www.oocities.org/reldictionary/names/genealogies/3-ikshwaaku-vikukshi.htm>tells that he was from ikshvaku vamsah)
