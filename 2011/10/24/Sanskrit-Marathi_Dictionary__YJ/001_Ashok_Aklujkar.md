Devasthali, Govind Vinayak (enlarged by Joshi, Y.B.; Kulkarni, G.R.) The Students' New Sanskrit Dictionary; Sanskrit into English, Marathi, and Gujarati. Bombay: K.B. Dhawale. 1955. 2nd edition. Reprint 1991 from the same publisher.

  

If this reprint has been sold out or if the publisher is no longer in business, someone should do a good scan of this dictionary (perhaps after making an enlarged photocopy) and make it available as a pdf. It is certainly worth the effort.
