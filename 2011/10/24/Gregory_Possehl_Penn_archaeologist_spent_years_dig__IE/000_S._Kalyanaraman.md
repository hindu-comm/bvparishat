Gregory Possehl, Penn archaeologist

THE REED BOAT was "ready to go," the Penn Museum professor said.  
Built with Bronze Age technology, the 40-foot craft - the "Black Boat of Magan" - was to travel the Arabian Sea from Oman to India on Sept. 8, 2005, to see how ancient mariners did it.  
  
Gregory L. Possehl, the University of Pennsylvania anthropologist, had been part of five years of planning for the 750-mile sea journey, and he and other archaelogists were confident that the rugged sailors and the fragile craft were ready to reproduce 2,000 years of history.  
  
Wrong. The little boat, made of reeds, rope and bitumen, capsized on the first day out and the experiment, long anticipated by those who dig into the ways of ancient civilizations, was over.  
  
Possehl watched the disaster from a private boat lent by the Sultan of Oman, and aided in the rescue of the crew, whose only concession to modernity had been sunscreen.  
  
But Dr. Possehl had more successes than failures during his long career as one of those diggers, specializing in the ancient civiliations of South Asia, as curator of the Asian collections of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.  
  
Possehl, professor emeritus of anthropology at Penn and a world-renowed authority on the Indus civilization of India and Pakistan, who didn't hesitate to get down on his knees and dig in hundreds of sites where that civilization flourished from 4300 to 1500 B.C., died Oct 8 of respiratory failure at the age of 70.  
  
As recently as 2007, Possehl had started a dig at the UNESCO World Heritage site at Bat, in Oman, where, he said, the largest and best-preserved Bronze Age cemetery in the region is located.  
  
On his web site, Possehl wrote in 1997 that his interests concerned the way urban centers developed in the ancient world.  
  
"My specific research and writing have focused on the first phase of urbanization in South Asia as exemplified by the ancient cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa," he wrote.  
  
"Since 1979, I have had an active program of field research in the state of Gujarat in India. The excavations in Gujarat have focused on three interrelated problems: chronology, reconstruction of subsistence activities and culture processes in a frontier region of the Indus civilization.  
  
"These are archaeological problems which are as interesting and important to me today as they were 15 years ago, when I first began to deal with them in the context of a field project."  
  
Walking through villages in India, Possehl found that he was being touched by villagers for luck. He discovered that the people consider the ficus tree sacred because of its great height, and along came this archaelogist who was 6-foot-3 - and so, naturally, he got the same honor.  
  
Possehl was born in Tacoma, Wash. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1964 and a master's degree in 1967, both from the University of Washington, and a doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1974, all in anthropology.  
  
He joined the South Asian regional studies department at Penn in 1973 and moved to the anthropology department in 1993. He retired in 2007, but continued to teach.  
  
He wrote numerous articles for learned journals, and several books, including "The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective," which was named the Outstanding Academic Book for 2003 by Choice magazine, which reviews academic works.  
  
Possehl is survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Christine White; a brother and a sister; and three grandchildren. He also is survived by his former wife, Ann Taylor, and companion, Susan West.  
  
Services: Penn will hold a memorial service at a later date.

Gregory L. Possehl; spent years digging up history  
  
By Walter F. Naedele  
Inquirer Staff Writer  
Gregory L. Possehl spent parts of his academic life on archaeological digs in South Asia, but he also paid attention to the West Philadelphia neighborhood of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.  
  
"One of the roles the University Museum plays is as a doorway for our neighbors to see what goes on at the University of Pennsylvania," Dr. Possehl explained in a 1985 Inquirer interview.  
  
Speaking of a Penn exhibit on the history of Buddhism meant in part to attract nonacademics, he noted: "This is an educational display that will be pretty, too, by the way. We don't mind being beautiful as long as we have our message."  
  
Dr. Possehl, 70, associate director of the University Museum from 1981 to 1992 and chairman of Penn's department of anthropology from 1994 to 2001, died of respiratory failure Saturday, Oct. 8, at Boston Medical Center.  
  
"Dr. Possehl was a leading expert on the rise of the Indus civilization in India and Pakistan," Penn biographical notes state.  
  
That ancient Indus society, researched at more than 2,000 archaeological sites along the Indus and Sarasvati Rivers, existed from 4300 to 1500 B.C.  
  
To help authenticate his studies, Dr. Possehl wrote on his website, he spent nine seasons on excavations of ancient sites in the Indian state of Gujarat.  
  
AltaMira Press published his book, The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective.  
  
A 2004 Penn announcement reported that the work had been named Outstanding Academic Book for 2003 by Choice magazine, which Penn described as "the key publication for academic librarians across the nation selecting books for collections."  
  
He had published papers in several scholarly journals.  
  
Dr. Possehl went far afield to share his enthusiasms with nonacademic audiences.  
  
He was one of three lecturers on a 1981 trip to India sponsored by the Women's Committee of the Penn Museum and the Friends of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  
  
In a 1981 Inquirer Sunday magazine story reporting on the trip, Dr. Possehl told the reporter accompanying the lecturers that a certain ficus tree is considered sacred by Hindus because of its size.  
  
"Greg, who himself is quite large at 6-3, is also regarded as special because of his size," the reporter wrote. "When he strides through a village, people touch him for luck."  
  
Born in Tacoma, Wash., he earned a bachelor's degree in 1964 and a master's in 1967, both at the University of Washington, and a doctorate at the University of Chicago in 1974, all in anthropology.  
  
Dr. Possehl joined the South Asian regional studies department at Penn in 1973, moved to the anthropology department in 1993, and retired in 2007, though he continued to teach.  
  
The Penn biographical notes state that "Dr. Possehl and his collaborator Dr. Vasant Shinde of Deccan College conducted four seasons of excavations at Gilund in Rajasthan," the Indian state, "beginning in 1999."  
  
"In the 2002-2003 field season, he discovered a bin filled with more than 100 seal impressions" dating to 2100-1700 B.C.  
  
"The existence of these seals, and their particular styles, offer surprising new evidence for the apparent complexity of this non-literate, late and post-Indus culture."  
  
In 2004, the Indian Archaeological Society named him an honorary fellow.  
  
In 2007, Dr. Possehl began "new excavations at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Bat," in the Persian Gulf nation of Oman, the Penn notes state.  
  
"The site consists of the largest and best-preserved Bronze Age cemetery in the region."  
  
In 2001-02, he was an Overseas Fellow at Churchill College at the University of Cambridge in England.  
  
A Penn website states that he was a member and often a chair of the university's Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility.  
  
Dr. Possehl is survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Christine White; a brother; a sister; and three grandchildren. He is also survived by former wife Ann Taylor and companion Susan West. Penn is planning a memorial service.
