### ***Half man, half lion figure in Germany***

The Löwenmensch (meaning lion-man in English)[is a puzzle](http://www.nature.com/news/2003/030904/full/news030901-6.html "Lion man takes pride of place as oldest statue  By Rex Dalton | Published online 4 September 2003 | Nature | doi:10.1038/news030901-6  News | 30,000-year-old carving might be work of Neanderthals or modern humans."). The provenance of this figure is derived from the 1870s.[Markedly](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1044946.ece "Carvings show early man’s spiritual side taking wing | By Mark Henderson, Science Correspondent | From The Times December 18, 2003 ")

These items, especially[the two Löwenmensch seemed](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/12/1217_031217_modernhumans.html "Ancient Figurines Found—From First Modern Humans? | By John Roach for National Geographic News | December 17, 2003")‘polished from heavy handling, suggesting that rather than sitting on a shelf as an artifact to be admired’.

### ***The importance of being the Löwenmensch***

These ivory artifacts are vital to the European historical narrative being developed over the last 20 years – based on these finds.

Dr.Conard in another paper claims, ‘The ivory figurines from Swabia represent one of the earliest artistic traditions worldwide”. A related academic paper on this period[goes on to say](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a905044254 "Revolution or evolution - the emergence of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe | Author: Nicolas Teyssandiera | DOI: 10.1080/00438240802452676 | World Archaeology Volume 40, Issue 4, 2008, Pages 493 - 519 "),

> Indeed, how can we not see, in the numerous and varied ornaments, > sculpted stone blocks, ivory statuettes or bone, antler and ivory > spear points, evidence of a significant and abrupt mutation in the > long history of human evolution?’.

Figurines apart, there are the odd musical instruments, which too are of ivory. Musical instruments made and used more than 30,000 years ago – in what is called as the Aurignacian period.

These incredible finds must have a credible theory behind it.

### ******How was the Löwenmensch dated?******

If this is true, I am most curious about the methodology used for dating. What samples were used for radio-carbon dating?

Academic papers presented by the team, list some 10 samples. These samples were radio carbon-dated – between 1977-2003, in different labs, by different researchers. These samples showed radio-carbon dates of 31000-41000 years BP. The error rate is less than a 1000 years. Conservative dating still puts these finds in the 30,000-40,000 years age.

10 samples over 10,000 years. That would be 1 sample per 1000 years. Usually such technology development has been accompanied by larger settlements – and not a remote cave, with sparse proof of habitation. To imagine that a few Early Stone Age people, sat down in a corner, picked a few sharp stones, and made musical instruments, sounds flimsy. Remember, in a remote cave.

However, another academic paper[does not find this remarkable](http://www.igespar.pt/media/uploads/trabalhosdearqueologia/33/22.pdf "The chronology of the Aurignacian and Transitional technocomplexes. Where do we stand? | By JOÃO ZILHÃO By FRANCESCO D’ERRICO"), as the ‘bulk of the material remained in situ, such a level of vertical displacement is also perfectly compatible with the recognition of global assemblage patterns’.

Just 10 samples. But with an age difference of over 10,000 years. Between the oldest and latest. At one site, at one stratigraphic layer. That is indeed a long period.

It means something.

### ***Strange is my middle name***

Going[back to reports by the researchers](http://www.bris.ac.uk/archanth/staff/zilhao/ta452006.pdf "The Swabian Aurignacian and its place in European Prehistory | By ■ Nicholas J. Conard ■ Michael Bolus | Pages 211-240 | Paper presented at Proceedings of the Symposium - 'Towards a definition of the Aurignacian' held in Lisbon, Portugal, June 25-30, 2002"), and a careful reading shows, that the Löwenmensch statuette of Hohlenstein-Stadel was found in the Upper Paleolithic layer – along side various other items. Organic[material like reindeer, wolf, elk, horse bones](http://users.telenet.be/cnutskes/Dries/Nieuwe%20map/M%FCnzel.pdf "Change and Continuity in Subsistence during the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic in the Ach Valley of Swabia (South-west Germany) | By S. C. MUNZEL AND N. J. CONARD")(humerus, mixed bone sample, ulna, astragalus, radius, longbone, metatarsal, longbone, metapodial). It is these bones which were carbon-dated.

Dr.Conard[the lead archaeologist, confirms](http://www.urgeschichte.uni-tuebingen.de/fileadmin/downloads/Conard/Conard___Bolus_JHE_03.pdf "Radiocarbon dating the appearance of modern humans and timing of cultural innovations in Europe: new results and new challenges Nicholas J.

It may be worthwhile to remind the academic community about[some recent demotions](http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/03/combe-capelle-rip.html "Combe Capelle RIP |  By Dienekes Pontikos | March 21, 2011").

If so much is being made out of these ivory artifacts, is it not then essential to carbon date the ivory? If the entire edifice of the evolution is based on these very ivory artifacts?

The bones are radio-carbon dated, but the entire narrative structure is built on the undated ivory figurines.

***The story grows***

Work on these sites has continued. Some more finds have been reported. Using the same technique, the Swabia region is now in danger of being called

### ***Maybe even do a DNA verification?***

The Löwenmensch figurine is made of ivory – which is usually used in context of elephant-tusks. In this case it has been proposed that this was made from[mammoth or a mastodon tusk](http://users.lmi.net/~drewid/fossil_ivory.html "Q: What is fossil ivory-is it petrified? Can you carve it? By -Andrew Werby | Last modified - Monday, October 13, 2003 2.29.19 PM")– the[ancestors of modern elephants](http://www.crystalinks.com/woollymammoth.html "Woolly Mammoths - Mammuthus Primigenius | Last Modified on - Thursday, December 23, 2010 12.08.51 AM"). The Ulm Museum where[this figure is housed](http://www.loewenmensch.de/lion_man.html "The lion man")says this was carved by ‘stone tools out of mammoth ivory’.

It is unclear on what basis the ivory type of the Löwenmensch was decided. Was it fossil ivory, of the mammoth type, or the modern African or Asian elephant tusk. The US Customs Department uses the Schreger Pattern[to decide between elephant or mammoth ivory](http://nyu.academia.edu/ClaireHeckel/Papers/338352/Physical_Characteristics_of_Mammoth_Ivory_and_Their_Implications_for_Ivory_Work_In_the_Upper_Paleolithic# "Physical Characteristics of Mammoth Ivory and Their Implications for Ivory Work In the Upper Paleolithic | by Claire Heckel | Published in the Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Urgeschichte, 2009.").

A few years after the discovery and the consensus on the Löwenmensch, methods to unravel the[DNA of the mammoth](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/11/081119-mammoth-DNA.html "Mammoth Genome Decoded -- Clones on the Way? | By Rebecca Carroll | National Geographic News November 19, 2008")were found between 2005-2009. The[mammoth genome](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/070927-mammoth-hair.html "Mammoth Hair Yields Ancient DNA, Study Says John Roach | National Geographic News | September 27, 2007")was sequenced and comparative-[DNA analysis of the mammoth](http://www.physorg.com/news10631.html "Scientists Sequence Complete Genome of Woolly Mammoth | Source - University of Massachusetts Medical School | February 7, 2006 ")too was done.

Considering what historians expect from Löwenmensch, would it not be prudent to go for DNA testing. Spectroscopic examination of the Upper Paleolithic era bones and mammoth ivory would reveal mineral traces, which may help in locating, where this mammoth tusk originated from.

### ***Stratigraphic coincidence***

The possible and logical answer to the stratigraphic coincidence, is the re-habitation of abandoned caves.

This logic appears stronger, with 10 samples sprayed across 10,000 years. So, apparently this cave was abandoned and re-occupied a few times in the 10,000 years which accounts for these chronologically widely spaced samples. The Löwenmensch and the other ivory artifacts could then belong to a probably Bronze age inhabitant – and not to the Upper Paleolithic man.

This[is relevant when it is](http://nyu.academia.edu/ClaireHeckel/Papers/338352/Physical_Characteristics_of_Mammoth_Ivory_and_Their_Implications_for_Ivory_Work_In_the_Upper_Paleolithic# "Physical Characteristics of Mammoth Ivory and Their Implications for Ivory Work In the Upper Paleolithicby Claire Heckel | Pages 77-78 |  Published in the Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Urgeschichte, 2009.")‘securely established that working fresh ivory in the Aurignacian was highly unlikely, if not impossible’. Radio-carbon dating has fixed Swabia-Jura in the 30,000-40,000 BP period. At a time when the woolly mammoth were alive and well. After the end of the Pleistocene era (1.7 million years ago-12,000 years ago), with retreating ice caps, for the Bronze Age man, weathered tusks from skeletons of woolly mammoths would have been easily available.

This also begs the question why not stone? European soft woods would have been so much easier. Simplest would have been clay. Why ivory? Such choices also indicate developed language skills. There is no evidence of any language skills in the Upper Paleolithic man here.

Can[Stone Age implements be used](http://www.geo.uni-tuebingen.de/fileadmin/website/arbeitsbereich/ufg/urgeschichte_quartaeroekologie/Mitarbeiter/conard/Hardy_Bolus_Conard_JHE.pdf "Hammer or crescent wrench?

Could rough, serrated-edge stone tools make a[figure of the woolly mammoth](http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,489776,00.html "Ice Age Art 35,000-Year-Old Mammoth Sculpture Found in Germany  | 06/20/2007 | In southwestern Germany, an American archaeologist and his German colleagues have found the oldest mammoth-ivory carving known to modern science.

Using ivory chips or bone-shards as tools, would be simple answer. Much like how Indians pioneered diamond-cutting more than 2000 years ago. But that was in a context of a nation with high language skills.

Conard /Maria Malina")? Splitting a swan-bone, down the middle and sealing it again with with birch-pitch? Stone Age Man?

Gimme a break! Puh-leeze!

***About the Löwenmensch itself***

The Aurignacian model using Löwenmensch figurine seems to be using**[the Antikythera model](http://2ndlook.wordpress.com/2009/06/07/babylonian-astronomy-the-indo-assyrian-roots/#comment-2309 "Babylonian Astronomy – The Indo-Assyrian Roots - By 2ndlook - Read comments section on the Antikythgera ")**. Discovered on a Roman ship, off the Greek coast, near the island of Antikythera, this astrolabe kind of mechanism was replicated with modern innards – and displayed, with much fanfare, as a marvel of Greek engineering. Subsequent research is showing that the Antikythera probably used Babylonian astronomy – and not Greek models of astronomy at all.

Perhaps the thinking behind this project was best[said in*The Times*, London](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1044946.ece "Carvings show early man’s spiritual side taking wing | By Mark Henderson, Science Correspondent | From The Times December 18, 2003 ").

When any historical development or find gets described as ‘abrupt mutation in the long history of human evolution’ or ‘modern humans in Europe were in fact astonishingly precocious artists (with) fast-developing artistic skills’,[Mortimer Wheeler comes to mind](http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Vpqr1vNWQhUC&pg=PA363&lpg=PA363&dq=Hellenize+almost+instantly+vast+tracts+of+Asia+populated+previously+by+nomads+or+semi-nomads+and+villagers&source=bl&ots=Xe6dlByNXp&sig=TNrozDq0FcusR5F2lBoMxWVDjcM&hl=en&ei=j8R5Ss_sDpPY7AO99YCXBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false "The shape of ancient thought By Thomas McEvilley (page 362-363)"), who said how his archaeological ‘expeditions’
