Dear Dr. Dipak Bhattacharya sir**,**

I am very sorry for not noticing your previous posting.

Since that thread was too long, I missed it.

Thank you very much for reminding me. I read it now.

This is really eye opener.Thank you once again for the reference.

REF:

Dear Colleague,  
Ghaṇṭikāsthānas referred to by D. C. Sircar was mentioned by me in a previous mail, the first or the second one. Please see the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā of the Atharvaveda, The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, 1997, Introduction , p.xlix, text relating to endnote 39. It deals with Amalānanda (Kalpataru) referring to Atharvaṇī śrutis recited in ghaṇṭikāsthānas. Appaya Dīkṣita (Parimala) further elaborates which too has been quoted in the Introduction by me.
