Gurubhyo namah!

  

First of all, there is aninterestingfact that we should all note. All the matter(including energy) is only 90% of what we see. The rest is in some kind of invisible form called dark matter(or dark energy). Any wave,longitudinal or transverse(i.e. electro-magnetic or pressure wave like sound) has some energyassociatedwith it. And what that energy can be used for is anybody's choice. But, in my opinion we don't have to worry too much about this celestial (or mythical) energy. Because,majorityof the phenomena that we see today can be explainedaccuratelyby existing theories of physics. So, even if there is something supernatural, that is only because we don't know the phenomenon. The act of comprehension discloses a completely new perspective as proven in history time and time again. But, this doesn't mean our ancient rishis were wrong. On the contrary, this gives us a new dimension to search for knowledge( truth). There is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics called as ' quantum entanglement' which is very much analogous to the concept of 'yoga(unison) as proclaimed by Patanjali'. There are many such phenomena in the Vedas and sastras which correspond to the quantum phenomena.

As to the proposed idea here that radio waves could impact the nature itself, it is very hypothetical and lacks in any scientific or emperical merit(by this, I only mean, it is not observed so far. I could be proved wrong in the future). Because the narayana mantra or whatever form of sound is a pressure wave and not a radio wave. Most animals and plants cannot respond to electromagnetic waves(other than by vision). And radio waves have to long a wavelength to have any impact on the energy environment unless we are bombarded with those( as in microwave oven). One more fact to note here is that we are always surrounded by radiowaves in the form of residual radiation(left overs after big bang) or cosmic background radiation. And they seem to have little or no effect on our system. To say something has an effect on anything, we should be able to quantitatively observe its effects on the system in consideration. Like, to say the Grahaas(planets) have an impact on humans by means of gravity thereby affecting our jaataka is absurd because, if planets do have an affect on us then, they should equally have an impact on other plants and animals which our jaataka systems do not consider. So, either our theory(in this case, the jaataka or jyotisha syetem) is incomplete or erroneous. On the other hand, the same jyotisha can be used accurately to measure the position of stars and planets and predicts eclipses. So, that part is consistent. So, by logical reasoning, we should discard the jaataka(astrology) part and only consider the jyotisha(astronomy) to have scientific merit.

So, I think, as of now, the Narada-ganam could only be mythical.

This is not meant to hurt anybody...but I am just presenting my opinion in a scientific manner. Any alternate opinion or criticism is welcome because only by criticism and dialectics do we attain true knowledge.
