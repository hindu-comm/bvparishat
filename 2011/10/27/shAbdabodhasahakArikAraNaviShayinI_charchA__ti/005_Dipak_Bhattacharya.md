Dear Colleague,  
  

*ākāṅkṣā* occurs in *na yady anākāṅkṣe* P.3.4.23 in the sense in which it is used in the Sāhityadarpaṇa but the whole concept with yogyatā and āsatti is first met with, perhaps, in the Sāhityadarpaṇa. But see Premachandra Tarkavāgīśa’s commentary on the Kāvyādarśa where the commentator deals with the idea. I told this from the memory of my student days. I do not remember the number of the verse.
