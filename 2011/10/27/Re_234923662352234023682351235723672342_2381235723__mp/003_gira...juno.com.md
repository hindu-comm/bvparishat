Dear Prof. Kapil Kapoor, it was nice to hear from you on BVP. I agree with your remark, "In our oral culture all *Rama Kathas* are authentic.". I will add " All Harikathas as well are authentic and pleasing"



In trying to make my posting short, I did not explain properly the discus ion in the paper of Shri. Mehendale. I myself was not looking for contradictions or interpolations. My interest was to find common denominator in the descriptions of geographical locations ofkingdoms describedin the Mahabharata . As you mentioned, in the case of serial writers, making any kind of conclusion based upon one narrativeisone way injustice to many other narratives.However on BVP and on many other websites educated people (not exactly history scholars) do raise questions about time, historicity, archeology as related to Ramayana and Mahabharata. Just now we saw one posting on Shri Lanka and reply of Dr. Rani Sadasive Murty to that. By the way I read your excellent book, ' Dimensions of PaNini Grammar". I enjoyed reading it. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
