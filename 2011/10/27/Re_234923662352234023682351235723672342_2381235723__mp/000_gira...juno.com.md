Dear Rajkumari Trikha,



Thanks for question. The name of Yaska appears in Shantiparva. The appendix also adds that Vaarshaganya , the Saankhya philosopher who flourished in the fifth century AD is mentioned in Shanti parva. The paper, " The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata: Its achievement and limitations," by M.A. Mehendale (BORI Annals-2007 published in 2008-pages 1-16) discusses even more contradictions. In the footnote on the page 7 he adds-Mahabharata itself calls upon its narrators to make additions to the epic and make it larger. Yaska could be gotra as suggested by DR. H.N.Bhata, I have no information if this gotra continued later on in his(Yaska of Nirukta) descendants. There is similar problem with gotra of Pandavas-Vaiyaghrapadya. We need more information.



My interest is this-How to reconcile archaeological and historical information of dynasties and provinces from the Middle-East countries carrying names of dynasties and names of provinces from Mahabharata with information available from ancient India. That is why I am reading the books of Bharadvaja, Savitri Saxsena, Dr, Bhagwan Singh, Vettam Mani, Raychoudhuri and of many other authors.



It is not easy.Within India a certain picture of Mahabharata is fixed on the mind of people and so it is very difficult to bring their attention to countries beyond the western boundary of the subcontinent.



I have noticed that Indians are ready to talk about ancient connection of India with Mexico or Maya but when I say there is no need to go that far, let us see who were next door in Afghanistan when Mahabharata war fought in the subcontinent, no sign of curiosity appears on their face. May be because many aggressions hit India in the known history from the Middle-East countries, Indians might havedeveloped aversion to their history. Thanks. Sorry for long reply. N.R.Joshi
