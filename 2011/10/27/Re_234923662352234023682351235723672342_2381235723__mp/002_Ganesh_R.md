Dear Kapoorji,  
  
It is very nice to read your insightful mail. But at the same we should never ignore the fact that there is a hierarchy in the tradition of our ancient texts (ex. munInAM pUrvapUrvapramANaM, PrasthaanatrayaM, adhibhUta v/s adhyaatma and adhidaiva v/s adhyaatma) it self which is essentially based on a grand philosophy of sublime synthesis.  
If not, for example, the work of ValmIki will be unfairly challenged with an ulterior motif by an insignificant/misinterpreted story of some body in the name of oral/minor/ignored tradition.  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
