It is only a compond with नमस् + उक्ति - नमउक्ति - as it seems to be. just like

  

इदं कविभ्यः पूर्वेभ्यो नमोवाकं प्रशास्महे। in उत्तररामचरित of भवभूति.

  

But it deems it necessary two सुबन्त-s formation of compound in both cases. Both synonyms, the first Vedic usage and the second classical usage, for the popuar नमस्कार. Both are भावप्रत्यय-s, one in feminine क्तिन् in the feminine gender, and the other in masculine with घञ् from the same verb वच् परिभाषणे.
