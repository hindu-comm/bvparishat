Oh! what a lovely discovery! In the Bh.Gita 11.42 we have this verse:  
  
*यच्चावहासार्थमसत्कृतोऽसि* विहारशय्यासनभोजनेषु ।  
एकोऽथवाप्यच्युत तत्समक्षं तत्क्षामये त्वामहमप्रमेयम् ॥  
  
Here the word 'असत्कृतोऽसि’ is in अनादर mode. If I am wrong kindly correct me.  
  
I thank the Parishad for creating such a nice platform for people like us to learn the language just by going through the posts.  
  
Regards.
