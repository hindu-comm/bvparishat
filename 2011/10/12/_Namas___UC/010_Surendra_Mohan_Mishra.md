Esteemed Scholars,

I am thankful to all for contributing to the discussion on 'namas'.The Vedic, epic and puranic use of 'namas' as a noun in neuter is very much there.

If some such use of the word is made in it's declinable form as a noun then would it be considered as merely archaic and un-Paninian or be considered as derived and justifiable ?

Has the word been so treated by any pre-Paninian grammarian (not the PrAtis'Akhya-s) ?

  

नमांसि भूयांसि लसन्तु भूयो विद्वत्सु पर्षत्कुलभूषणेषु /

व्याख्यानतो वस्तुविशेष एष्यो न संशयान्नेति बुधा वदन्ति //

Best regards,

smmishra
