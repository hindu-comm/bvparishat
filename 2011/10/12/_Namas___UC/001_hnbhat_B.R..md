I had already answered it in clear terms and could not find any source from Indian Grammar to defend it being a noun neuter gender in lexicons and grammar. You are right in your assertion as it is a popular thing for anybody knowing Sanskrit Grammar. It is considered so by Paninian system of Grammar as अव्यय by including it in the list of them provided in the rule1-1-37स्वरादिनिपातमव्ययम्॥ and none of the commentators ever remarked as it being noun too.

  

Only case government is discussed and its derivates too. 2-3-16नमःस्वस्तिस्वाहास्वधालंवषड्योगाच्च । governs dative case with the word to whom salutation is intended to be conveyed. नमस्कुर्मो नृसिंहाय, नमस्कृत्य मुनित्रयम्, etc. usages are there with the same word. स्वयंभुवे नमस्कृत्य is also available attested. The following words are derived from the same word: namas\_

नमस्यति = worships, नमस्या = worship. 

  

  
  
All the lexicographers consider it as अव्यय,one commentator on Amarakosha had remarked:"अव्ययनमश्शब्दोऽप्यस्ति"  
and supports his statement by citing examples:  
नमश्शब्दः

  

"यत्तन्नमः किमपि शुश्रुम देवताभ्यः" "त्वामन्तरेण नमसामवसानभूमिम्।" (Source not known).

(अमरकोशपारिजातः)।

Adyar Library Edition Vol.II, p.636.

  

Source not known. These can be considered as irregular usages like the one discussed in another thread on कालीन occurring in dictionary or can be accepted as justified by their usage.

  

Traditionally such usages are अव्यय-s and there may be possibly two homonyms one considered as अव्यय and अनव्यय of which do not have any clue to the source to support the other rare usage.
