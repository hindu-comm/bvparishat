From Dhaval's quotations conspicuous usage:

  

सत्कृत्येरन् - I could not explain it according to Paninan Grammar

सत्कृत्य is a Gait compound with क्त्वा,"आदरानादरयोःसदसती १।४।६३।, and now it could not be conjugated further.

.

In some works, one can notice such usages as भिक्षुस्य, भिक्षुणे नमस्बुद्धाय etc.



I don't have ready access to Buddhist Sanskrit Texts. But I am sure certain irregular forms to Paninian formations would be found in them and also in Jain Sanskrit though many have contributed to Sanskrit Literature like Buddhists contribution to न्याय philosophy.
