Respected Scholars,

The word 'namas' is accepted as an indeclinable.But can the same be taken as a noun to justify the expression 'namaa.msi' in plural ? And could someone quote the use of the word as a noun from some authentic literary source ? Or it is a grammatically unwarranted use ?

M.M. Williams says that the word is a noun but used as an indeclinable.

Best regards,

smmishra
