In Rigveda, you can find this word used in the instrumental case नमसा in these references:

6-52-17, 6-67-2, 6-67-3, 6-69-6;

  

7-2-4,7-12-1,7-16-1,7-44-2,7-83-8,7-86-4,7-91-1,7-93-7,7-97-3;

(The references are to the Mysore Edition with SayaNa-s commentary with Word Index soft copy made available)

  

More are available with Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance totaling to 96 occurrences. As I could check, the word in neuter is used in many of these, are commented as meaning अन्न or हविस् by Sayana. I have not checked every instance.

  

In Vedic vocabulary, the word is synonym with "अन्न" and also with "यज्ञ" found in निघण्टु (exact reference could not be provided right now). But in classical literature, rare usages are found with declined forms as quoted in my previous post.

  

भागवत also  has singular usage.

  

BhāgavPur, 3, 13, 43.2  
vidhema cāsyai**namasā**saha tvayā yasyāṃ svatejo 'gnim ivāraṇāv adhāḥ //

  

Some other PuraNa-s also may be there in addition to the ones quoted in my earlier post.

  

KūPur, 1, 31, 38.1  
sahasrapādākṣiśiro'bhiyuktaṃ sahasrabāhuṃ**namasaḥ**parastāt /
