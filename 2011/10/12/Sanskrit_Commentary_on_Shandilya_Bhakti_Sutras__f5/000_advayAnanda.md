Dear and respected Scholars,  
Hari Om  
  
Is anyone in the forum aware of any Sanskrit Commentary on Shandilya Bhakti Sutras. Shall be glad if I could get some information of its availability.  
  
I am aware that Sri Swami Tapovanam, the Guru of Sri Swami Chinmayanandaji, the founder of the Chinmaya Mission, had written a Sanskrit Commentary on this text -- but that is not traceable to my knowledge.  
  
In Shri Guru Smriti,  
Advayananda
