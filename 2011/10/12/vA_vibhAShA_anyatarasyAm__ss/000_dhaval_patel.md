Hi all,

There are three words which are used to denote optionality of an operation in Paninian grammar.

वा  विभाषा अन्यतरस्याम्‌..

  

Now the question which i have in mind is this:

Paninian system is very much strict about brevity.

so why would he use अन्यतरस्याम्‌ when he could use वा ?

  

Is there any difference between these three words denoting optionality ?
