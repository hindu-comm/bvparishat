Like ‘itarA’ being the name w.r.t. Aitareya Upanishad, there is a woman by name ‘anyatarA’ and her opinion is ‘anyatarasyAm’.

You may listen to the video lecture at our site <http://ihg.cdacb.in/ihg> under ‘Vyakarana as Vedanga’ by Prof. V. Srivatsankachar.

--  

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।  
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
