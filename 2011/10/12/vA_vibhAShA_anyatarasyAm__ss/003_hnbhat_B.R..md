Dear Bhattacharya,

  

Thanks for the information. The question asked by Dr.Dhaval was why he is using  वा, विभाषा and अन्यतरस्याम् interchangeably or any specific principle behind using these in the relevant सूत्र-s. All these meant optional operation, is obvious, in the case of विभाषा it is clearly defined as you have already explained. For the two others, is there any special purpose than optional operation. अन्यतरस्याम् is to be considered as a technical term **अव्यय resembling inflected form of the pronoun अन्यतर in the feminine gender locative singular as there is no noun corresponding to it. Hence it is a peculiar usage of the word. **



I also had heard of the article by SD Joshi and Paul, referred to by Dr. V N Jha, but did not have a look into it. It is said there is little difference between the use of the three. Generally they are treated as synonyms except the three specific environments of विभाषा.
