Great finding of our great Grammarian. Thanks for the explanation. But I could not understand, accepting the name अन्यतरा as of some women, how the maxim "संज्ञोपसर्जनीभूतास्तु न सर्वादयः" सर्वो नाम कश्चित्, तस्मै सर्वाय. Following this, it should be अन्यतरायाम् in the locative, or अन्यतरायाः in the षष्ठी as he usually refers to others opinions in the षष्ठीविभक्ति, as in लोपः शाकल्यस्य, लङः शाकटायनस्यैव, व्योर्लघुतरः प्रयत्नः शाकटायनस्य, etc. and never used other grammarian's name in the सप्तमी to offer their opinions.

  

He might have invented some lope holes in the maxim to defend his contention. Anyhow, ingenious innovation. Somebody may shed light on these points, if available from the clip of audio.

  

Thanks for the information and the link.
