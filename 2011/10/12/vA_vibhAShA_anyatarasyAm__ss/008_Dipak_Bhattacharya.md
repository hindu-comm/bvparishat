Dear Narayanji

I too thank you! This paper was unknown to me. But i must tell you that I did not miss a lot by not reading it. Kiparsky's remark::

“Sanskrit scholars did not even think of Vedic as a precursor of the classical language, so a fortiori they would not have dreamed of differentiating between older and more

recent forms of the Vedic language. They surely had the notion of a corrupt vs. authentic reading in a Vedic text, but lacking philological methods they must have selected among variants on the

basis of their 'synchronic judgments of relative grammaticality.'”

When the Veda is supposed to have preceded our existence according to the traditional view the unqualified statement of Kiparsky requires qualification. And what is this"synchronic judgments of relative grammaticality.'? How wrong Kiparsky is also evident from Panini's qualification of usage as mantre/amantre, BraahmaNe etc. The distinction is synchronic, true, but as effective as when based upon the evolutionary theory. This holds good for the concept of aarsha proyoga too. I also failed to be an admirer of Bronkhorst's negative approach to ancient philologists. He completely failed to understand my analysis of Nirukta's approach to etymology which Yaaska meant to serve prayer and sacrifice. Bronkhorst failed to understand this and bluntly and wrongly remarked that I thought that Yaaska was like a normal modern etymologist. I sent a protest but he opposed the publication of the rejoinder.

One cannot emulate either the conduct or even the theory.

Still I regret that I do not have a copy of Kiparsky's Paanini as a variationaist. I read it in 1982 when abroad and did not find it interesting. At least the information was no better than what one gathers from the Mahaaabhaashya. Do you know to whom to write to to get a copy? I ask because I repeatedly wrote to the BORI for purchase of some books but got no reply. Do you know if the CASS will reply if I wrote to them? Then I shall write to them.  

Best
