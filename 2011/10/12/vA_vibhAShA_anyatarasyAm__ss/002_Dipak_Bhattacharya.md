Dear Shri Patel,

The operation of vibhāṣā seems to have been envisaged by Pāṇini in *na veti vibhāṣā* (1.1.44). Three types of options prāptavibhāṣā, aprāptavibhhāṣā and prāptāprāptavibhhāṣā – option of what has been enjoined, not enjoined and of both have been mentioned by Patañjali . Apart from in the examples given in the Mahābhāṣya and by Vāsudeva Dīkṣta their operation can be seen also in the employment of the options in the declension of the sarvanāmans mentioned in the Gaṇapāṭha. It will be unnecessarily tedious here to show the operation which you can yourself examine. See particularly the options on *jasaḥ śī* as explained by the Siddhāntins. This classical to-the- point approach here is very lucid.

To be fair the points have been stated by the older school too. And Jayāditya and Jinendrabuddhi too are lucid. But Vāsudeva seems to have only young entrants in mind.

All said the Mahābhāṣya seems to think that the exigencies can be solved impromptu! See the Bālamanoramā on this.

Best
