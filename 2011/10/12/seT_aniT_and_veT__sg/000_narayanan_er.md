Respected Scholars,

  

I request for the complete verses regarding सेट्, अनिट् and वेट्, as I have seen those verses in an Introduction of Acharya Prahlada Giri version of the Ashtadhyayisutrapatha, published from one of Chowkhabha groups from Varanasi, which is not available with me at present. To my memory, it starts as:  

  

अनिट्‌ स्वरान्तो भवतीति दृश्यतामिमांस्तु सेट: प्रवदन्ति तद्विद:।  
  
So, I request for the rest of the verses, text or link if any. Thanks.  
  

Regards,

Narayanan
