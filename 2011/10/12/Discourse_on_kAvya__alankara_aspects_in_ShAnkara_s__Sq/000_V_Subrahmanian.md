Namaste.  
  
Kind attention: Sri R.Ganesh.  
  
Sri ShatAvadhAni R.Ganesh in one of his discourses on the VivekachUDAmaNi in Bangalore at the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs had made a mention of the possibility of a lecture series on the kAvya / alankara aspects found in Shankaracharya's bhashya sAhitya and stotra sAhitya.  
  
May I know, Sir, if you have any definite plans of giving that discourse ? I am making this query on the PariShat's list so that several other members residing in Bangalore could become aware of such a rare and wonderful proposition.  
  
With warm regards,
