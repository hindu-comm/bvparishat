Contact of Indus language speakers span an expansive area from Muztagh Ata to Altyn Depe along the Silk Road, from Rakhi Garhi to Haifa across the Persian Gulf, and are attested by evidences of the eagle and other glyphic narratives. In the Mesopotamian epic of Anzu, the eagle steals from Enlil the Tablets of Destinities, a deed which causes the norms to be suspended and ‘all brightness to be poured out.’ Anzu flies away with his prize into his far-away mountain. He is vanquished ‘cut down with weapons’. There is testimony in writing – on Indu script glyphs and on Mesopotamian cylinder seals -- for this expression of life-experience, which finds echoes in allegories, metaphors and narratives in the oral Vedic-Avestan traditions of soma-haoma.  
Elamite lady spinner. Musee du Louvre. Paris. An elegantly coiffed, exquisitely-dressed and well fanned Elamite woman sits on a lion footed stool winding thread on a spindle. The stool on which the lovely Elamite lady sits has the legs of a lion or panther; the fish is also placed on a similar stool in front her.This five-inch fragment is dated 8th century BCE. It was molded and carved from a mix of bitumen, ground calcite, and quartz. The Elamites used bitumen, a naturally occurring mineral pitch, or asphalt, for vessels, sculpture, glue, caulking, and waterproofing.

“…a neatly sewn theory, with careful borders and no loose threads, will scarcely reveal the inexhaustibility of man’s expression of mystery and therefore will miss his mortal capacity for immortality.” (Knipe, David M. (1967). "The Heroic Myths from Rgveda IV and the Ancient near East" from History of Religions, Vol. 6, No. 4 (May, 1967), p. 360)  
  
"Like the Revelation (śruti) itself, we must begin with the Myth (Itihāsa), the penultimate truth, of which all experience is the temporal reflection. The mythical narrative is of timeless and placeless validity, true nowever and everywhere: just as in Christianity, 'In the beginning God created' and 'Through him all things were made,' regardless of the millennia that come between the datable words, amount to saying that the creation took place at Christ's 'eternal birth.' 'In the beginning' (agre), or rather 'at the summit,' means 'in the first cause': as as in our still told myths, 'once upon a time' does not mean 'once' alone, but once for all.' 'The Myth is not a "poetic invention" in the sense these words now bear; on the other hand, and just because of its universality, it can be told, and with equal authority, from many differnet points of view...It is in the marvels themselves that the truth inheres. 'There is no other origin of philosophy than wonder, ' Plato, Theatetus 1556. And in the same way Aristotle who adds 'therefore even a lover of fables is in a way a lover of wisdom, for fables are compounded of wonder' (Metaphysics 982B). Myth embodies the nearest approach to absolute truth thatn can be stated in words. (AK Coomaraswamy, Rama P. Coomaraswamy, 2004, 'The Myth' in: The essential Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, World Wisdom, Inc., p.267, p. 273).  
  
“In Sumero-Akkadian mythology, Zu is a divine storm-bird and the personification of the southern wind and the thunder clouds. This demon, half man and half bird, stole the "Tablets of Destiny" from Enlil and hid them on a mountaintop. Anu ordered the other gods to retrieve the tablets, even though they all feared the demon. According to one text, Marduk killed the bird, but in another text it died through the arrows of the god Ninurta. The bird is also referred to as Imdugud or Anzu.” <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_(mythology)>

"...we have Toch. A. \*ancu 'iron', the basis of the derived adjective ancwaashi 'made of iron', to which corresponds Toch. B encuwo, with the parallel derived adjective encuwanne 'made of iron'...The two forms go back to CToch. oencuwoen- [non.sg](http://non.sg). \*oencuwo, the final part of which is a regular product of IE \*-on...This noun is deprived of any convincing IE etymology...The term Ved. ams'u-, Av . asu- goes back to a noun borrowed from some donor language of Central Asia, as confirmed by CToch. \*oencuwoen-...the BMAC language would not belong to the Indo-European family; it does not seem to be related to Dravidian either...New identifications and reconstructions will certainly help to define more precisely the contours of the BMAC vocabulary in Indo-Iranian, as well as in Tocharian."(p.192)\]

Pinault parallels amśu of Rigveda with añcu of Tocharian. In Tocharian it means 'iron'. Tocharin language as an Indo-European language has revealed a word anzu in Tocharian which meant 'iron'. It is likely that this is the word used for soma in Rigveda. I have posted about this in the context of identification (discussed in this blog) of Muztagh Ata of Kyrgystan as Mt. Mujavat (mentioned as a source of soma in Rigveda). It is notable that in Mesopotamian legend of Ninurta, god of war and agricultural fertility hunts on the mountains, Anzu which is the lion-headed Eagle with the power of the stolen Tablet of Destinies. The 'eagle' is identified as śyena in Rigveda and Avesta (saena meregh) as the falcon which brought the nectar, Soma. It is likely that soma as electrum (silver-gold ore) was bought from the traders who brought anzu from Mt. Mujavat.

A winged jackal? This is a leaded bronze figure of a beast with eagle wings. This indicates that eagle hieroglyph connoted ‘lead’. If the beast is a jackal, the vikalpa is: kol ‘tiger, jackal’; read rebus: kol ‘pancaloha or alloy of five metals’ (Old Tamil) Leaded bronze figure of a winged beast. Parthian or Sasanian, about 3rd century CE. Said to have been found near the Helmand River, Afghanistan. There is considerable debate about the date of this fabulous creature. It has been repaired several times and has a fourteenth-century Islamic inscription on one leg which cannot be read with certainty. However, the object probably dates either to the Parthian or Sasanian period. Fantastic creatures such as these dragons are often depicted in Sasanian art and are also found on the stone façade of the Islamic palace at Mshatta in Jordan, dating from around CE 740.  
  
Alternatively, the Parthian period may be suggested, as the decoration on the chest is very similar to that found on furniture legs now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. These are very like Roman examples of the second to third centuries AD. Perhaps therefore a date in the late Parthian to early Sasanian period is possible for this piece.

<http://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/an/web-large/1982.5.jpg> Shaft-hole axe head with bird-headed demon, boar, and dragon Period: Bronze Age Date: ca. late 3rd–early 2nd millennium B.C. Geography: Bactria-Margiana Culture: Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex Medium: Silver, gold foil Dimensions: L. 15 cm Classification: Metalwork-Implement Description. Ancient Bactria and Margiana were areas along the Oxus and Murghab rivers in modern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. While these areas were sparsely inhabited during much of the third millennium B.C., by about 2200 B.C. permanent settlements with distinctive forms of architecture, burial practices, and material culture had been established, supported in part by active trade with parts of Iran, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley.  
  
This silver-gilt shaft-hole axe is a masterpiece of three-dimensional and relief sculpture. Expertly cast and gilded with foil, it represents a bird-headed hero grappling with a wild boar and a winged dragon. The idea of the heroic bird-headed creature probably came from western Iran, where it is first documented on a cylinder seal impression. The hero's muscular body is human except for the bird talons that replace the hands and feet. He is represented twice, once on each side of the axe, and consequently appears to have two heads. On one side, he grasps the boar by the belly and on the other, by the tusks. The posture of the boar is contorted so that its bristly back forms the shape of the blade. With his other talon, the bird-headed hero grasps the winged dragon by the neck. This creature is distinguished by folded and staggered wings, a feline body, and the talons of a bird of prey in the place of his front paws. Its single horn has been broken off and lost.
