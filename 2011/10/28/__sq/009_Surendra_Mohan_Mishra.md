The late Pandit Kulamani Mishra,a great Dharmashastra scholar of Odisha,prepared a map on cloth and colored it that showed the path of the Cloud messenger up to Kailas mount.His starting point was Ramagiri in Koraput district of Odisha as pointed out by Dr Narayan Dash.This place is nearer to Da.n.dakaara.nya justifying the passage " [janakatanayaa-snaana-pu.nyodake.su](http://janakatanayaa-snaana-pu.nyodake.su) " ! But as Prof. P.K. Mishra has rightly observed we couldn't be whimsical in our choice of a place simply based on a similarity of place name.  
Yesterday we had Kalidasa-jayanti.The day of course marked the day of release for the Yaksha,the day of his long-awaited s'aapaanta.But our acceptance of it as his birthday is our own faith and conviction which however has no textual or corroborative evidence ! Best regards,SMMishra
