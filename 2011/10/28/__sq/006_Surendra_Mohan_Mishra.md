The work on Meghaduta is excellent as the translation has remarkable flow and felicity.But the route map is not complete.It misses Brahmavarta and Kurukshetra in between Dashapura and Kanakhala.Mathura and Vrindavan shown in the same map refer to the ancient S'Urasena which comes before Brahmavarta.Another map appearing in the Kalidasa Sanskrit Academy edition(2008) of Kalidasa's Works,Vol.I,p.424 may be seen.I have information that one Dr Bhave of Pune,a physician by profession,was so fascinated by kalidasa's Meghasandesha that he took a helicopter to make an aerial survey of the cloud's chartered route from Ramtek to Kailasa. Someone could have his map which would be of great interest !Tomorrow is DevapravodhinI EkAdas'I,the good day that saw the release of the Yaksha from the curse and his reunion with his beloved.This is the day on which the immortal poet is believed to have been born !
