Dear colleagues,

McGill University's Indian Ocean World Centre  
([http://www.indianoceanworldcentre.com/](http://www.indianoceanworldcentre.com/)) invites applications for  
a doctoral fellowship for the study of the transmission of ideas  
either within the Indian Ocean World (i.e., any region(s) from Africa  
to the Middle East to South and Southeast Asia to China) or between  
the Indian Ocean World and other cultures, such as Arabic or  
Chinese. Among the possible subjects of investigation are: logic and  
debate, grammar, mathematics and astronomy. The successful candidate  
is expected to have a good reading knowledge of one or more of the  
relevant languages. Interested applicants should send Prof. Brendan  
Gillon ([brendan...@mcgill.ca]()) a two-page outline of a project  
proposal and a CV. The proposal must make clear how it fits with  
project and the subjects of investigation listed above. The successful  
candidate's department of affiliation will depend on his or her  
project and background. Possible departments of affiliation are: the  
Department of Philosophy ([www.mcgill.ca/philosophy/](http://www.mcgill.ca/philosophy/)), the Institute  
for Islamic Studies ([www.mcgill.ca/islamicstudies/](http://www.mcgill.ca/islamicstudies/), the Department of  
East Asian Studies (<http://www.mcgill.ca/eas/>) and the Department of  
History ([www.mcgill.ca/history/](http://www.mcgill.ca/history/)). The successful applicant must meet the  
criteria for admission to the relevant department and complete its  
degree requirements, but will be working under the partial or complete  
supervision of Prof. Gillon.  
  
The deadline for application is January 15th, 2012 and the fellowship  
will start in the Fall of 2013.
