As I recall, the late Sushil Kumar De has an article on theMahaa-naa.taka /Hanuman-naa.taka. It should be available in a collection of his essays::[Aspects of Sanskrit literature](http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=227784&recCount=10&recPointer=5&bibId=1894731), Calcutta: K.L. Mukhopadhyay. 1959.

  

The play is usually dated to 10th century A.D. It is primarily a collection of unusually beautiful verses pertaining to the Raama story, probably taken from different sources. The two names,Mahaa-naa.taka andHanuman-naa.taka, probably signify two versions in which the play is available (there is a story associated with Bhoja according to which theHanuman-naa.taka was discovered in his time in the form of rock inscriptions in a river bed; please check the Bhoja-prabandha of Ballaa.la).

The following is not for those who think of the verse concerned as a scripture, with the wording of which one should not tamper (actually in uuha one does tamper to some extent).

  

The insight and feeling in the verse are noble and truly commendable, but in my view the author should have worked a little bit more on his expression. To leave out the conception of divinity as a female is to miss a large and distinctive part of Indian religiosity. The Naiyaayika concept of God is not limited to kart.rtva. The Miimaa.msakas do not exactly elevate karman to godhood. Neither school is primarily a school of religion or devotion like the ;Saiva or Vai.s.nava schools. Therefore, in Mahima-bha.t.ta's spirit, I decided to rewrite the verse. I used the opportunity also to update the content. The result achievedsometime before 1997is given in the attachment.
