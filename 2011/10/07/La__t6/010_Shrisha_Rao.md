\> Dear Subramanianji,

\> I thank you for your observations. You are absolutely correct. But these things deserve much more intensive study than they have till now got. What I can hesitatingly pronounce is the following. But I remind you that it is not that I claim absolute correctness in so enigmatic a phenomenon.  
\> Most of the retroflex laterals represented by ḷ in modern Indian languages are not descended from the Rgvedic intervocalic ḷ that comes as a combinatory variant of ḍ. For example, in Oriya the ḷ will be found in words like kuḷa, mūḷa etc. But the ḷ here has nothing to do with the intervocalic ḍ pronounced as ḷ in the Ṛgveda. The ḷ in kuḷa is probably of dental lateral origin and is by no means a trilled intervocalic retroflex in origin as in, say, the Oriya word amaṛā pāṭha or in Jharsuguṛā. The Oriya word amaṛā pāṭha has the intervocalic ḍ uttered as a trilled ṛ. Clearly this has no connection with the Ṛgvedic phenomenon.

However, it is certain that some ळ usages other than intervocalic are traditional; e.g., the word बहळ survives in Kannada and is found in older manuscripts, but contemporary editions are likely to modify it to बहुल. In his 1971 edition of Madhva's महाभारततात्पर्यनिर्णय, Bannanje Govindacharya says in one footnote that the word बाहुषाळी is the correct form and that बाहुशाली is पाश्चात्य (not sure what his justification is for this claim).
