The question is not whether there ळ in Dravidian languages and in some other Indian languages. The available are the substitutes for the palatal ल turned to ळ as in common in Sanskrit - ल to ळ, in selected words, and native in the languages. But the question is whether the same is identical with the intervocalic velar substitute 

ळ for the ड and ढ as described in the प्रातिशाख्य with clear instructions of articulation तालु च जिह्वामूलीयं च स्थानामाह वेदमित्रः quoted in the first post.  

  

There is no question of the मूर्धन्य ळ existing in Dravidian languages. To focus the point, whether it is identical with the one described in the प्रातिशाख्य or not. It is described as trilled palatal by Bhattacharya and his opinion is that it is not identical with any of the ones existing now. It is his opinion.
