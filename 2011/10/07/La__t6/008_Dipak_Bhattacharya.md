Thank you Dr. Nori! Professor Narasimhacharyulu, himself a brilliant scholar and an old friend of mine, is undeservingly eloquent on me. Do not take that seriously.

In fact I studied mainly the Sanskrit Sahitya Parishad edition of the RP because when I became a student M.D.Shastri's edition of the text with Uvata's Commentary was not available in the market. It was reprinted later but I thought that P. Shastri's commentary was sufficient for me. The division by M.D.Shastri into suutras was also not quite palatable to me. Obviously the verses are meant as verses and not as suutras. Is it not so? The imposed extraneous character by M.D.Shastri was one of the reasons for my not taking to the M.D.Shastri edition. The same thing happened with Surya Kanta's edition of the Atharva Pratisakhya. Surya Kanta's many ideas cut at the root of our long standing tradition. It seemed to me, perhaps wrongly, that M.D.Shastri's work also required careful study before being accepted in toto. I may be wrong but I have to state my position. I shall read his arguments very carefully from the pdf. file sent by you.  

As for Surya Kanta you may see that Professor M. G. Deshpande too argued against him. I myself have dealt with very extensively with Surya Kanta in the very recently published third volume of the Paippaldasamhitaa.

Best wishes and sincere thanks
