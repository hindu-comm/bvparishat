In the recently quoted verse from the mAdhavIya shankara vijayaH there is this word 'बहल’:  
  
ब्रह्मैकं परमार्थसच्चिदमलं विश्वप्रपञ्चात्मना  
शुक्ती रूप्यपरात्मनेव *बहला*ज्ञानावृतं भासते ।  
  
When I came across this word for the first time I was reminded of the Kannada बहळ. As you say, it is likely that this word could get modified to 'बहुल’ from where we get the word 'बाहुल्यम्’.    
  
However, the word बहल is also listed in the Apte dictionary and down the line the word बहुल too appears. The meanings: very much, copious, abundant, plentiful, etc. are given for both the words.
