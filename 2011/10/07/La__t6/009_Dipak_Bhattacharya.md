Dear Subramanianji,  

  

I thank you for your observations. You are absolutely correct. But these things deserve much more intensive study than they have till now got. What I can hesitatingly pronounce is the following. But I remind you that it is not that I claim absolute correctness in so enigmatic a phenomenon.

Most of the retroflex laterals represented by ḷ in modern Indian languages are not descended from the Rgvedic intervocalic ḷ that comes as a combinatory variant of ḍ. For example, in Oriya the ḷ will be found in words like kuḷa, mūḷa etc. But the ḷ here has nothing to do with the intervocalic ḍ pronounced as ḷ in the Ṛgveda. The ḷ in kuḷa is probably of dental lateral origin and is by no means a trilled intervocalic retroflex in origin as in, say, the Oriya word amaṛā pāṭha or in Jharsuguṛā. The Oriya word amaṛā pāṭha has the intervocalic ḍ uttered as a trilled ṛ. Clearly this has no connection with the Ṛgvedic phenomenon.

The matter was extensively dealt with by the present writer long ago. But I do not claim that all the problems relating to them have been solved. The zh\<\>ḷ phenomenon of many Dravidic words is an enigma that deserves closer attention than it has. This is a phenomenon that asks for enquiry by its own merit and, according to me, might help in better appreciation of some standing problems.

Best
