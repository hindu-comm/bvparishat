Dear Colleague,

Many thanks!  

The rules are valid for saṃhitā. The state exists in *bahaḷa* and *bāhuṣālī*. There is no pause (virāma) after ḷ in them, nor after the vowel preceding them. Hence the ‘ḷ’s are intervocalic (*ajmadhyastha*). The basic postulates have been dealt with in the Ṛkprātiśākhya and the Mahābhāṣya.

Best
