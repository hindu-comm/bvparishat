I said trilled lateral and did not comment on whether that exists now or not. By genre it is not different from the Rgvedic ळ. Ignoring for the moment the Prague-school phoneticians' view that no two sounds of two languages are the same, we may maintain that they often belong to the same genre. In the IPA both might appear as the same sound under the same symbol. This is true of the Rgvedic ळ in ईळे and the Oriya ळ in मूळ
