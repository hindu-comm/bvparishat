नत्वा तत्रभवन्तम् आचार्यदीपकभट्टाचार्यमहोदयं सविनयं समर्पयति शिवसेनानीः

  

Sir

  

I heard my teacher Srimaan Prof. B. Narasimhacharyulu, former Head of Dept., Department of Sanskrit, Osmania University speak very highly of you. I deem it an honour to correspond directly with you, Sir.

  

I gather from the introduction (attached) to his edition, that MD Shastri followed UvaTa in determining the text of the praatiSaakhya. MD Shastri has shown with internal evidence that UvaTa does not consider the first ten stanzas to be a part of the praatiSaakhya. There is an available commentary (vritti, not bhaashya) on the first ten verses which, according to the colophons, is by Vishnumitra. MD Shastri has also shown how earlier editors were mistaken in their opinion about the first ten verses.

  

The introductory pages are attached. (It is a large file - 1.9 MB).
