\<However, it is certain that some ळ usages other than intervocalic are traditional; e.g., the word बहळ survives in Kannada and is found in older manuscripts, …... In his 1971 edition of Madhva's महाभारततात्पर्यनिर्णय, Bannanje Govindacharya says in one footnote that the word बाहुषाळी is the correct form and that बाहुशाली is पाश्चात्य. ….>



The ḷ in बाहुषाळी = *bāhu**ṣāḷī* is intervocalic. Also that in बहळ unless it is read bahaḷ instead of *bahaḷa.* Kittel’s entry (p.1093)is
**ಬಹಳ **that is *baha**ḷa*.
