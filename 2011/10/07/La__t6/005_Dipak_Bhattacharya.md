9 10 11

Dear Dr. Bhat,

You are welcome!

Please note that the two verses जिह्वामूलं तालु चाचार्य आह etc and ळकारतामेति स एव चास्य have been numbered differently by me and Shri N. Siva Senani as 21, 22 and 11,12 respectively. This is so because I followed the Sanskrit Sāhitya Parishad edition by P. Shastri where the numbering starts from the very first verse while Shri Senani followed M. D. Shastri’s edition where the numbering starts after the first ten verses enumerating the Varnas and dealing with other introductory matter. The rationale of M.D.Shastri’s enumeration is not clear to me.

Best
