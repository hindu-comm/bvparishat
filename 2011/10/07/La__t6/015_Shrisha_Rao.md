However, in that generous sense almost all consonant letters in Sanskrit are intervocalic! For it to be so in the RV sense, one would have to parse the words as बहट् + अ (or बहड् + अ), and बाहुषाट् + ई (or बाहुषाड् + ई) respectively. Perhaps you mean that this is indeed so, but in my much more limited experience I have never come across बहट् or बाहुषाट् and wouldn't know what to make of them.

There are also usages like ल becoming ळ under the influence of the prefix प्र, as लय becomes प्रळय (as with मान and प्रमाण), which does not necessarily happen with other उपसर्गs (cf. विलय, विमान). This surely needs a more specific explanation than being intervocalic.
