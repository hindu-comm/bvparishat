Recently there was a discussion on the samskrita group regarding this letter.

I thought it would be interesting to float this in this group also..

  

The crux was that Whitney's grammar provides that

ळ is used when it occurs between vowels like अग्निमीळे..

whereas ड is used when it has a consonant at any end.

  

the examples in ऋग्वेद also seem to corroborate it...

अग्ने सुखतमे रथे देवानीळित आ वह \|1.13.4  
इळा सरस्वती मही तिस्रो देवीर्मयोभुवः \|1.13.9

ईळते तवामवस्यवः कण्वासो वर्क्तबर्हिषः \|  
हविष्मन्तोरंक्र्तः \|\|1.14.5 etc..

  

The counterexample of ड is found in this case

विशो-विश ईड्यमध्वरेष्वद्र्प्तक्रतुमरतिं युवत्योः \|  
दिवः शिशुं सहसः सूनुमग्निं यज्ञस्य केतुमरुषं यजध्यै \|\|6.49.2

  

Thus the empirical evidence suggest that the logic derived by Whitney is correct...

  

But i would like this august group to shed some more light and if possible with references..
