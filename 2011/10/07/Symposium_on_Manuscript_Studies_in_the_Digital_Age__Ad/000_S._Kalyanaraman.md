### *Writing the East: History and New Technologies in the Study of Asian Manuscript Traditions*

In partnership with the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Penn Libraries are pleased to announce the 4th annual[Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age](http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/lectures/ljs_symposium.html "Overview"). This year's symposium will explore a range of issues relating to Asian reading and writing cultures, especially as they pertain to the manuscript source. Our focus will be on Asian manuscripts from the Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian traditions. We will bring together scholars representing these traditions to examine the ways in which hand-produced texts shape both meaning and interpretation, and to a larger extent, the cultural norms that define their use. We will also consider the role that modern digital technology can play to facilitate the study of manuscripts today.

Participants include:
