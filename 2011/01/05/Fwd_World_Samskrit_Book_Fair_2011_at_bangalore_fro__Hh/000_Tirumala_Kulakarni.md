The World Samskrit Book Fair  
  
Samskrit is very much thriving. See it, Believe it, Embrace it!  
Objective  
  
The Annual World Samskrit Book Fair is a collective effort by all the major  
Samskrit-related institutions in India and around the world to popularize  
and stimulate innovation enabled by Samskrit and its rich knowledge base.  
Through organizing a book fair, we intend to achieve multiple objectives:  
Give a fillip to modern Samskrit research and literature,  
Encourage Samskrit scholars to innovate and publish,  
Create a ‘market’ for Samskrit publications,  
  
Instill confidence into Samskrit students about the future of Samskrit as a  
career path, and  
  
Popularize Samskrit and mobilize public support for its promotion.  
  
The event is open to the general public of all ages and backgrounds with or  
without knowledge of the Samskrit language. Though the entire event will be  
conducted in a totally immersive samskrit environment where all the  
volunteers interact in Simple Samskrit, people of all ages and backgrounds  
can easily understand and enjoy.

during January 7-11, 2011 (Friday thru Monday).
