I fully agree with Sri Narasimhacarya .  
  
In fact, I feel bad for not giving the Sanskrit material in Devanagary . But the duties  are taxing and it is taking much more time to type in Devanagary . I shall try to learn fast typing .  
  
Yes , in order to understand the 'tAtparyam' of Vedas one should study - Upavedas , VedAngas , Dars'anas  
etc. wherein one gets the explanation / clarification etc , that are authentic as they are offered by .R.sis, who - are Mantradra.s.tAra.h , had Yogipratyak.sam unlike us .  
  
Just an observation -- may be due to oversight -- it is 'k.setriya' (k.setrIya means something else) and 'sambaddha' (sambandhita) is preferable -- sambaddham ( x asambaddham = irrelevant) .  
  
Abaddham means -- manasA na baddham ( manasyanyat vacasyanyat etc.)
