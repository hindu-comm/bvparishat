\>Yes , in order to understand the 'tAtparyam' of Vedas one should study - Upavedas , VedAngas , Dars'anas etc. wherein one gets the explanation / clarification etc , that are authentic as they are offered by .R.sis, who - are Mantradra.s.tAra.h , had Yogipratyak.sam

unlike us .  
  
Unfortunately, the highlighted points are overseen and crossed taking a 'clean drive' by most of the scholars, researchers, Indologists and 'scientists'.  
  
And what 'prayOjanaM' is envisaged becomes more significant in the context of "one should study" all that is listed, for a life time and more(if any!).  
  
The required Upaasanaa for "Yogipratyaksham" empowerment involves 'diirghakaala-nairantarya' saadhanaa, anushThaanam.
