Namo vidvadbhyah

I may be permitted by Dr Joshi and Dr Sastri to post my response on BVP as many scholars will come to know the points and may offer comments .

An important suggestion – please do not look the following discussion from the point of view of Western Linguistics , which is insipid and undependable .

VyAkara.nam is compiled by Yogis with the help of Yogabalam and therefore impeccable .

Pa tanjali enumerated the chief purposes of Vyakaranam in Paspas’A – rak.sohAgmalaghvasandehA.h prayojanam .

When one gets Vaidikas’abdas from Vedas and Laukikas’abdas from Loka (s’i.s.taloka of AryAvarta ) what is the necessity of VyAkara.nam ?

Rak.sA , i.e. VedAnAm rak.sA and Laghu = to get thousands of s’abdas thru a simple device (laghunA upAyena mahato mahata.h s’abdaughAn pratipadyeran ) .

Laukikas’abdas are also to be protected ( from natural change) and without a constant form and meaning of S’abda it is a futile exercise to compile a VyAkara.nam -(Paspas’A)- siddhe s’abdArthasambandhe lokato’rthaprayukte s’abdaprayoge s’Astre.na dharmaniyama.h (KAtyAyanavArtikam) –

nAnarthikAm imAm kas’cid vyavasthAm kartumarhati I

tasmAnnibadhyate s’i.s.tai.h sAdhutvavi.sayA sm.rti.h II(VakyapadIyam 1-29)

S’bda is used for communication , i.e. here s’abda is VAkyam ( or MahAvAkyam depending on the length of meaning to be conveyed) .

But sentences that are used , being used and going to be used are infinite in number . Therefore .R.sis had come down to Padam . Even Padas are infinite in number . So there should be a device by which one , without going to the catalogue of words (PratipadapA.tha). can get the Padas .

The device is – prak.rti – pratyaya – vibhAga . Offer a single Prak.rti and many Pratyayas – kAryam , kartavyam, kAri.h , kara.nIyam, kriyA, kara.nam, karma, kartA, kAra.nam, kArakam , kartum , k.rtvA, karoti, kari.syati, kAram kAram, k.rti.h , kArayAmAsa etc.

The origin of this terminology goes back to Veda – GopathabrAhma.nam – omkAram p.rcchAma.h , ko dhAtu.h ? kim prAtipadikam ? .. ka.h pratyaya.h ? …

Earlier to PA.nini , there were PrAtis’Akhyas of different Vedas and VyAkara.nams of Lasukikas’abdas .

PA.nini , with his unparalleled ‘Yogabalam’ compiled ‘A.s.tAdhyAyI’ , which takes care of Laukikas’abdas and the Vaidikas’abdas of 1137 S’Akhas . And that’swhy PA.ninIyam only is called VedAngam .

There is a single Spho.tas’abda and the same is ‘vyAk.rta’ by different sages differently –

Yadekam prakriyAbhedai.h bahudhA pravibhajyate I

tadvyAkara.namAgamya param brahmadhigamyate II (VAkyapadIyam 1-22)

Rama.ha , bhavati –

PA.nini – rAma + s ; bhU + a = ti .

S’Aka.tAyana – rAma + ru ; bhU + ati

S’Akalya – rAma + ri : bhava + ti

anvAkhyAnAni bhidyante s’abdavyutpattikarmasu I

bahUnAm sambhave’rthAnAm nimitam kincidi.syate II (VP 2-170)

vairavAsi.s.thagiris’A stathaigArikAdaya.h I

kais’cit kathancidAkhyAtA nimittAvadhisankarai.h II (171)

yathA patha.h samAkhyAnam v.rk.savalmIkaparvatai.h I

aviruddham gavAdInAm bhinnais’ca sahakAribhi.h II (172)

kais’cinnirvacanam bhinnam giratergarjatergame.h I

gavatergadatervApi gaurityatrAnudars’itam II (174)

gaurityeva svarUpAdvA gos’abdo [go.su](http://go.su) vartate I

vyutpAdyate na vA sarvam kais’ciccobhayathocyate II (175)

AnvAkhyAnam (vyutpatti) may differ from VaiyAkara.na to VaiyAkara.na, but the Padam is the same The word ‘gau.h’ is analysed differently and some (like Aukthikya ) argued that gos’bda denotes the meaning ‘gau.h’
there need not be any ‘vyutpatti’ .

As far as the Pratyayas are concerned --

No doubt the complete word only conveys the meaning but in order to exhibit the analysis PA.nini compiles a Pratyaya keeping ‘lAghavam’ (brevity) in mind –

By appending or prefixing a Var.na as ‘it’ he can suggest something – V.rddhi or no V.rddhi , Gu.na or no Gu.na, Svara etc .

The [idvar.na](http://idvar.na) ruled by ‘halantyam’, ‘las’akvataddhite’ etc(

1-3-3,8) will get ‘lopa’ by ‘tasya lopa.h’(1-3-9) after serving the purpose.

.Nvul -- .nvult.rcau (P 3-1-133) – here in .nvul - ‘ .n’ is for V.rddhi by ‘aco’n.niti (7-2-115) , ‘l’ is for litsvara (pratyayAt pUrvam udAttam) by ‘liti’(6-1-163) , ‘vu’ becomes ‘aka’ by ‘yuvoranAkau’ (7-1-1) –

k.r + .nvul – k.r + vu – k.r + aka – kAr + aka – kAraka ( + sup – kAraka.h/kArikA/kArakam)

k.r + t.rc – here ‘c’ is for ‘antodAtta’ by ‘cita.h’ ( 6-1-160) , although there is no marker for Gu.na, it is effected by ‘sArvadhAtukArdhadhAtukayo.h’ (7-3-84) , Gu.na and V.rddhi in the place of ‘.r’ will be ‘rapara’ by ‘ura.n rapara.h’ (1-1-51) , ‘subAdi’ – kartA.

.du k.rn ([kara.ne](http://kara.ne)) - .du is for ‘ktri-pratyaya’ by ‘ .dvita.h ktri.h’(3-3-88, ktrermam nityam) and as a result we get the word ‘ k.rtrimam’ ; the ‘n’ (cavarga) is for ‘nitsvara’ by ‘nnityAdiarnityam’ (6-1-167) , i.e AdyudAtta

k.r + .nvul – k.r + vu – k.r + aka – kAr + aka – kAraka ( + sup – kAraka.h/kArikA/kArakam).

The ‘p’ s itsamjnA (s’ap, kyap, sup etc) is for ‘anudAtta’ by ‘anudAttau suppitau’ (3-1-4).

The ‘r’ (anIyar – tavyattavyAnIyara.h -3-1-96) is for ‘madhyodAtta ‘ by ‘upottamam riti’(6-1-214) – kara.nIyam .

The ‘t’ ( tavyat )is for Svaritam by ‘titsvaritam’ (6-1-182) – kartavyam .

The ‘k’ in ‘ktvA’ etc (not in Taddhita) is to arrest ‘Gu.na’ and V.rddhi’ by ‘kniti ca’ ( 1-1-5 ) – k.rtvA , bhuktvA .

In ‘pacAdi’ ( nandigrahipacAdibhyo lyu.ninyac.h, 3-1-134) we find
‘deva.t ‘ and the ‘.t’ is for effecting ‘nIp’ by ‘ .ti.d.dhA.nan…(4-1-15)- devY .

In Taddhitas , the ‘n’ (cavarga) ‘.n’ and ‘k’ are for ‘Adiv.rddhi’ by ‘taddhite.svacAmAde.h’ (7-2-117) and ‘kiti ca’ (7-2-118) –

Das’arathasya apatyam pumAn – das’aratha + in(ca) – by ‘ata in’(4-1-95) – dAs’arathi.h .

Parvatasya apatyam strI – parvata + a.n , by ‘tasyApatyam’ (4-1-92) –

pArvata – ‘striyAm’ nIp by ‘.tiddhA.nan…’94-1-15) – pArvaty .

dharmam carati – dharma + .thak , by ‘dharmam carati’ (4-4-41) –dhArmika.h .

‘Kvip’ etc are called ‘sarvalopi-pratyaya’ - then what is the purpose ?

In order to become a ‘PrAtipadikam’ by ‘k.rttaddhitasamAsAs’ca’ (1-2-46) some ‘k.rt’ has to be applied .

All this PrakriyA is ‘k.rtrima’ (artificial) and not real . But a best device to gain vocabulary .

The above analysis is called ‘alaukika’ , i.e. useful exclusively in S’Astram .

KArakas are meant to show that there is only six types of S’akti in the universe . Following usage they take place .

‘Gha’ (taraptamapau gha.h -1-1-22) etc are SamjnAs , so that there will be brevity .
