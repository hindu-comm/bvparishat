Dear Group Incharge

Bharatiya Vidya Parishat

  

Dear Sir

Sub: Request for forming your group and placing regular messages in the group



I am K.V.Krishna Murty, Chairman, I-SERVE, Hyderabad.

I-SERVE is a voluntary research institute, dedicated to Vedic sciences. The attached brochure gives you some details about our organization. For more details please visit our website [www.serveveda.org](http://www.serveveda.org/).



Dr. Srinivasa Varakhedi is a friend of mine and he encouraged me to give this message to you.



I have been a member of BVP group since a few years and I am getting the messages regularly and I love them very well.



Now, I request you to please include our messages also in your group, since all the work we do is Sanskrit related and is of interest to Sanskrit scholars.



If you give us the procedure for this, we follow it regularly, when ever we send messages, related to our activities and related discussions.



We are participating in the World Sanskrit Book Fair 2011, Bangalore and a related message is herewith attached. If it is acceptable to you, please include this message in your group (BVP group) messages.



Hoping to meet you in person, in near future and thanking you,

With Kind regards

K.V.Krishna Murty
