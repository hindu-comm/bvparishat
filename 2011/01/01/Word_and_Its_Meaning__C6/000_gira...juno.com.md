Respected Scholars, Namaste!

First I wish you all happy new year day and happy coming year 2011.

Iam reading the book, " Word and Its Meaning, A New Perspective in the Light of Jagadish's Shabda Shakti Prakashika" by Dr. K.N.Chatterjee from Banaras Hindu University (1980).There is one whole chapter on a single Sanskrit word "Pankaja".

This is very old and interesting topic-Meanings of Sanskrit Shabdas.That is why my focus was on it from beginning when I initiated discussion on this list in 2009. Everybody was involved-Mimamsakas, Naiyayikas, Vais'eshikas, Grammarians. Jainas, Bauddhas. A lot of research is being promoted now on ancient Indian sciences. I feel discussions on the ancient technical words would bring out new perspective on Sanskrit.Thanks. N.R.Joshi
