hariH OM,  
  
 I am honoured to be in this group. Got to know about the group from shrii kalyANarAman. Now I see that there are a few very respected friends of mine in this group (shatAvadhAnii R. gaNesh for instance). I wish to humbly submit the following to the eminent group members:  
Am an alumnus the Indian Institue of Science, currently running an engineering solutions business in Bangalore (this is my part time activity). Otherwise i have finished the adhyayana of pUrvArchika of sAmaveda, and six maNDalas of R^igveda in the traditional method.  
  
 My interaction with shatAvadhAni gaNesh has been one of immense cordiality and he has been extremely magnanimous in overlooking my blunders.  
  
 I am in this group to listen to the learned members. I am sure I will benefit immensely with this association. Thanks again for having included me in this group.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
