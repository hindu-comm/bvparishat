*January 13, 2013*



 Even in a limited sense, as a physical discipline, we have archaeological evidence for the practice of yoga from Harappan sites that go back more than 4500 years.



 But these people, Wendy Doniger & Co,keep repeating the same falsehoods *ad nauseum* in the expectation that they can saturate people's minds and there is no room left for the truth.



 The real problem as we found during the Calfornia School curriculum battle is that there is no **authoritative reference work** that projects our viewpoint that we can point to and silence our critics.



 The result is we have to fight each battle by improvising responses, like fighting brushfires.



 In the proposed ***People's History of India*** we plan to cover yoga in some detail, tracing its origin from the Vedas.



 But what we need is a similar project that we may call ***Indic Encyclopedia of Philosophy*** that puts our stamp on all philosophical questions looking at them from an Indic perspective.



**For Balramji:** Let us plan for such a project under UMass Indic Studies Center. That will provide focus as well as serve a great purpose. I will help you in every way that I can. We can discuss it when I next visit you. Doing things piecemeal doesn't get us very far.



If the Hindu community is serious about preserving its heritage and showing it in positive light, it must wholeheartedly support such a project. They should stop complaining and start putting their money where their mouth is. I can think of no more worthwhile project.
