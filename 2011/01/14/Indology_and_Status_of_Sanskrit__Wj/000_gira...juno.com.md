Respected Scholars!



Yellabela tagori Vande Matadri ! Greetings on Shubha occasion of Makar Sanskranti.



Editor: Jan. E.M. Houben

Book: Indology and Status of Sanskrit: Contributions to the History of the Sanskrit Language.



The contributors of articles in this book are heavy weight Indologists from India and the world-Ashok Aklujkar, Madhav Deshpande. Saroja Bhate, Hans Henrich Hock, Johannes Bronkhorst, Sheldon Pollock, Jan Houben..

I am reading the book. I felt that understanding about origin or the ancient history of Sanskrit of these scholars differ from the Indian scholars supporting idea of revealed texts. The article by Prof. Deshpande on "Features of Priestly Sanskrit" is interesting to read.



Many of these scholars will be visiting India in Jan 2012 for Sanskrit conference. It will be good opportunity to have with them meaningful dialog on issues raised here on bvparishat.



My feeling (I may be wrong) after reading some articles from this book: Although the racial theory of Aryan invasion/migration lost its sharp edges, its twin Linguistics (Indo-Aryan/Dravidian)is still kicking strong. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
