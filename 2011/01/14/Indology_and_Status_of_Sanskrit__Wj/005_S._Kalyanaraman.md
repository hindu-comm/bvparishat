The use of the word 'priest' or 'priestly' is insulting. Madhav should retract this usage and apologise.

  

See the etymology for the word in English:O.E.preost,shortened from the older Germanic form represented by O.S., O.H.G.prestar, O.Fris.prestere, from V.L.\*prester"priest," from L.L.presbyter"presbyter, elder," from Gk.presbyteros(see[Presbyterian](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Presbyterian)). In O.T. sense, a translation of Heb.kohen, Gk.hiereus, L.sacerdos.
