hariH OM  
shri joshi,  
  
 I have been running a discussion with a group of entrenched sanskrit haters who want to "cleanse" kannaDa of its "sanskrit infiltration". You may find the discussion here:  
[http://www.google.com/buzz/116261552480996514711/WhFxtxcj4fY/ನ-ನ-ಇಷ-ಟಪಟ-ಟ-ಒ-ದ-ವ](http://www.google.com/buzz/116261552480996514711/WhFxtxcj4fY/%E0%B2%A8-%E0%B2%A8-%E0%B2%87%E0%B2%B7-%E0%B2%9F%E0%B2%AA%E0%B2%9F-%E0%B2%9F-%E0%B2%92-%E0%B2%A6-%E0%B2%B5)  
 The people in the above discussion (members of a group called "banavAsi baLaga") have established deep rooted connections with ground level groups (who can do the dirty work of breaking glass panes, throwing stones, etc.) like karnATaka rakShaNa vedike (karave). I have heard that these are the same people who help getting the karave members released on bail in case they get arrested.  
  
 In the course of the discussion, I felt that there is a need to collect references to journal papers related to linguistics which have been written by people with non-colonial mindsets.  
  
 The sprouts of Sanskrit Hatred if not nipped in the bud will soon bloom into the shoots of Brahmin hatred to begin with and then to the tree of Hindu hatred.  
  
 I will soon be starting a blog where i will collect linguistic papers which have been published by neutral linguists. I solicit your help in this regard.  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
