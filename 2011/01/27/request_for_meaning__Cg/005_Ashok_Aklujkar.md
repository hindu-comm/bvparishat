The verse naatyartham ... needs one correction in addition to the excellent corrections proposed by by Drs K. S. Kannan and H.N. Bhat. lubdham should be lubdha (i.e., a nominative sg. with the visarga dropped in sandhi before udvejayet). There is no point in characterizing the potentially exploitable person as 'greedy' or implying that the ocean (the parallel of the exploitable person in the analogy) is greedy. It is also not likely that lubdham was intended as an adverb.
