Thank you very much Dr. Bhat.Such a beautiful meaning I never imagined. Simply great!

Thanks also for the second verse. My difficulty is with the dRStaanta. As you have said we must consult a medical expert (Aayurveda, ofcourse).

Sorry, my computer cannot read any other fonts. It has shown ????? in place of Devanagari in your mail. I could not therefore read the verse in your other mail. Can you send it in Roman? I feel more encouraged by your response.

Here is another verse for your consideration:

yata evaagato doSastata eva nivartate/ agnidagdhasya visphoTashaantih syaadagninaa dhruvam//

Thanks again

Bhate

I think the first poses no problem as it simple in its assertion.



???????????????????? ??????????????????

?????????? ?? ???????? ???????????????

(Cited in ???????????)

The golden strings friendship assuming different forms, have got a touch stone (??????-????????) called ?????? (indirect references).



The idea is that most your friends may express different greetings to you in your presence (praising you vividly = glittering like the golden lines). But if they hold the same value in your absence, they have to be considered true to friendship they keep. The purport is that in your absence they will find fault with you and only to please you they exhibit friendship to gain something from you. Only those who maintain the same opinion about you even in your absence, they are to be considered as true friends. I liked this verse very much.

?????? ???? = ????????, ????? ?????????? = ?????????? ???

??????? ???????? (????), ???? - ???? (???? ???)?

?????????????? (touch stone for verifying the genuineness of gold)

?????? ??? ?????????????????****????????****???????



"??????? ????? ???" ?????????, ????????????? ???????? ?? ??????????????????????, "??????-????????" ??? ?????????? ??????????? ????????

In the second,



durlabho'pyuttamah praayah svajaateeyena labhyate/karNakotaragam vaari vaariNaivaavakrSyate //



??????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????

?????????? ???? ?????????????????

(???????????. ??)



also seems to be simple in the idea conveyed.

The wise man will generally be found out (recognized) by another man of his genre (another Uttama).

The printed reading ??????????? also make the same sense. This reflects the same idea as:



????????? ???????? ???????????????????

? ?? ??????? ???????? ??????? ?????????????

and too

"????? ???????? ?????????" If good men fail to recognize other good men, how can others recognize?



But the problem is the analogy of water based on some practice of medicine. Analogy is perfect, based on ???????.



Water crept inside the ear lobes, is to be extracted with water only.(Only medical experts can explain the idea) reminding us of the analogy in the last verse of ??? and ??????. But the analogy is beautiful.



Thanking you once again for bumping two more beautiful verses,

With regards
