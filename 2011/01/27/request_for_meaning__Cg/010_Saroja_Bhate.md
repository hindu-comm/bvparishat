I apologise for the delay as I was out of station. Many thanks to Dr. Kannan(the same old friend of mine, I guess),Dr. Bhat, Dr. Aklujkar, Meera

(who rightly voiced my difficulty), and Dr. Ganesh. So, arthaarthitayaa is upalakSaNe tRteeyaa .and not hetau or karaNe I also agree with the corrections . In fact I found the correction suggested by kannan in the printed text, but the other intelligent corrections suggested by Aklujkar and Bhat need corroboration by . pathabheda recorded somewhere. Lubdha(h) would, indeed, be far more acceptable.So also the compound ashvaratnastreeh which would better explain the plural after stree

Thanks again.

Here is another verse:

sacchidranikaTe vaaso na kartavyah kadaacana / ghaTee pibati paaneeyam taaDyate jhallaree yayaa//.

Please help

@Ms.Meera.H.R.

  
  
Yes; as you have noticed, there is a discrepancy in that verse. This is an example of krama bhanga dOSha as per Alamkaarashaastra. However, the analogy is catchy and the wisdom implied here is impeccable. Hence we have to bear with such distortions of mythological sequences.

Namaste.



The story of the churning of the ocean occurs famously in these places: Bhāgavata (8.6-8), Mahābhārata (1.16) and Rāmāyana (1.45).



The story in Bhāgavata gives that Hālāhala appeared first(8.6.25), followed byUccai?śravas (8.8.3), Airāvata (8.8.5)etc. Even in Mahābhārata, Hālāhala is the first to appear (1.16.15) followed by the good things.

The verse here mentions the poison appearing last.



Would someone please clarify?



Thank you.

Regards,

Meera

Dear Sir,



Thanks for the excellent correction. Now it should be alright.
