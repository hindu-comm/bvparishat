Dear Profs. Kannan and Bhate,

Assuming that the later part of the verse describes the operation of a  
water clock employed in those days - which used to be designed in such a  
way that as it keeps sinking by a certain amount through a contrivance  
attached to it, it will keep ringing a bell to denote that a certain  
amount of time has elapsed - the import of the verse could be understand  
as follows:

\`Though the water pot (men) with a hole rings the bell (through certain  
activities) and thereby draws the attention of people towards it (them),  
we must not forget that it (they) will definitely sink in due course, and  
hence it is not advisable ....'

To me, the message the poet wanted to give seems to be don't rely on it  
(them), as the show exhibited by them is only temporal!

Would be glad to have your views on this.

Thanks much, and  
Best regards,  
-Ram.
