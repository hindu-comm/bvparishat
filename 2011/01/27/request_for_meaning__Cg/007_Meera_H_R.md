Namaste.

  

The story of the churning of the ocean occurs famously in these places: Bhāgavata (8.6-8), Mahābhārata (1.16) and Rāmāyana (1.45).

  

The story in Bhāgavata gives that Hālāhala appeared first(8.6.25), followed byUccaiḥśravas (8.8.3), Airāvata (8.8.5)etc. Even in Mahābhārata, Hālāhala is the first to appear (1.16.15) followed by the good things.

The verse here mentions the poison appearing last.

  

Would someone please clarify?

  

Thank you.

Regards,

Meera
