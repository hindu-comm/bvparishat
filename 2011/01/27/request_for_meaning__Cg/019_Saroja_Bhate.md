I thank prof.s Ramasubramanian, Kannan, SP Narang and others for helping me understand the meaning of the verse.Though the exact nature of Jhallari is still not clear to me, I can imagine a small hanging pot filled with water and having a hole at the bottom from which water drops on a metal upsidedown-dish-like instrument striking another metal dish below it and thus creating a musical sound. Interesting, isn't it?Some one should design such an instrument. May I seek more help for the following?:
