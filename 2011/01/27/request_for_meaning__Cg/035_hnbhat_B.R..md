Dear Madam,

  

He had just asked whether we could put a "avagraha" to prashlesha before \[a\]nIti-vidhi-prayuktAm. He had given the source as Hitopadesha 2.25. I am reproducing his message itself:

>   

> Respected Madam,

> The verse ishitopades'a2.62.

> Are we to read anavagrahabeforenIti?

>   

> Kannan

> Bangalore

  

I too didn't get any idea. Better the text of Hitopadesa with commentary be consulted. I found the source as given in SubhAShitaratna-bhaNDAgAra as from Pancatantra 1.70. Better to consult the text with a commentary. I could not find time to get Pancatantra text with a Sankrit commentary from our Library. I will do so as early as possible.

  

It doesn't seem so simple
