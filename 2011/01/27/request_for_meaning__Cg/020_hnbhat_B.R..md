I think the first poses no problem as it simple in its assertion.

  

सौहार्दस्वर्णरेखाणां उच्चावचभिदाजुषाम्।

परोक्षमिति को ऽप्यस्ति सुवर्णनिकषोपलः॥

(Cited in कुवलयानन्दः)

The golden strings friendship assuming different forms, have got a touch stone (सुवर्ण-निकषोपलः) called परोक्ष (indirect references).

  

The idea is that most your friends may express different greetings to you in your presence (praising you vividly = glittering like the golden lines). But if they hold the same value in your absence, they have to be considered true to friendship they keep. The purport is that in your absence they will find fault with you and only to please you they exhibit friendship to gain something from you. Only those who maintain the same opinion about you even in your absence, they are to be considered as true friends. I liked this verse very much.

सुहृदो भावः = सौहर्दम्, तानेव स्वर्णरेखा = स्वर्णरेखा इव।

उच्चवचं नैकभेदम् (अमरः), भिदा - भेदः (भावे अङ्)।

सुवर्णनिकषोपलः (touch stone for verifying the genuineness of gold)

आकर्षः इति सुवर्णपरीक्षार्थो*निकषोपलः*उच्यते।

  

"शाणस्तु निकषः कषः" इत्यमरात्, शाणापरपर्यायः निकषशब्द एव स्पष्टप्रतुपत्त्यर्थम्, "सुबर्ण-निकषोपलः" इति प्रयुक्तः। अर्थभेदस्तु नात्येव।

In the second,

  

  

durlabho'pyuttamah praayah svajaateeyena labhyate/karNakotaragam vaari vaariNaivaavakrSyate //  

  

दुर्लभो ऽप्युत्तमः प्रायः स्वजातीयेन लभ्यते।

कर्णकोटरगं वारि वारिणैवावकृष्यते॥

(वृद्धचाणक्य. ३३)

  

also seems to be simple in the idea conveyed.

The wise man will generally be found out (recognized) by another man of his genre (another Uttama).

The printed reading उत्तमप्रायः also make the same sense. This reflects the same idea as:

  

विद्वानेव विजानाति विद्वज्जनपरिश्रमम्।

न हि वन्ध्या विजानाति गुर्वीं प्रसववेदनाम्॥

and too

"सर्वः सगन्धेषु स्निह्यति" If good men fail to recognize other good men, how can others recognize?

  

But the problem is the analogy of water based on some practice of medicine. Analogy is perfect, based on साजात्य.

  

Water crept inside the ear lobes, is to be extracted with water only.(Only medical experts can explain the idea) reminding us of the analogy in the last verse of घटी and झल्लरी. But the analogy is beautiful.

  

Thanking you once again for bumping two more beautiful verses,  
  

With regards
