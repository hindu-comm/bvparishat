Dear Madam,

  

I had re-typed the matter relevant to the verse in my recent message in roman letters in the forwarded message. If you were not able to see it, here I again reproduce it: In the forwarded message, he had typed the corroboration with the Ayurvedic texts.

  

Just I am re-typing the reply I got for the above verse from a a friend of mine. Just discharged from his "vicikitsaalaya" with his expert "cikitsaa" on the "vicikitsaa" on the verse you handed over to me.

  

shlokasyaasyaayam abhipraayaH. yataH, yena kaaraNena, doSha AgataH, \[tata eva nivartate =\] tenaiva nimittena tasya doShasya, shaantiH (nivRuttiH) kartuM yujyate.

  

It is only justifiable that the blunder commited by anybody, is remedied by the same person responsible for it. In other words, the person responsible for any blunder (doSha) is find remedy for the same. (should not be tossed to other for remedying it.) This seems apparently the purport. We have to get the person responsible, to do the remedy for the errors. (and not anyone else).

  

The second half gives the example well founded on the treatment of burning with minor injuries, as explained by my friend. I could not re-type whole of his explanation. But just re-type only related portion (if you can read the devanagari font, you can read it yourself).

  

agnidagdhasya kasyacit puruShasya visphoTasya = agninimittajaatasya budbudavad dRushyamaanasya sphoTasya, shaantish = cikitsA, dhruvam agninaiva = agnikarmaNaiva, kriyate. agnikarma nAma agninA dAhaH. ............ karmaitad bahuShu vyAdhiShu ciktsArUpeNa nirdiShTam asti. yaadRucChikadagdheShu tuttha-dagdham ityavasthA kAcidasti, .... tutthasya agnipratapanaM kAryam uShNaM ca bheShajam" iti

  

It seems burning in the case of skin burning, is the treatment prescribed.

  

Since he had to attend his "cikitsAlaya" he could attend to our "vicikitsA-laya" of the verse sent to his "cikitsAlaya" for treatment, he could not reply earlier. Hence the delay. We have to thank this friend for his expert advice on the point.

  

The example in the other verse, "karNakoTaragataM vAri vAriNaivAvakRuShyate" is simple experience in every day life. If water crept inside the ear, it pains for a while. But if we are in water, diving inside the water, forcefully opens ear drum and extracts the little water crept inside. It is the experience during swimming in a pool generally. But he could not defend such a treatment according to Vaidya texts.

  

कर्णकोटरगतस्य जलस्य प्रभूतजलप्रवाहैण बहिरपहरणं प्रायशः क्रियते लोके । चिकित्साशास्त्रे तादृशं किमपि न मया दृष्टम् ।

  

karNakoTaragatasya jalasya prabhUtajalapravAheNa bahirapaharaNaM prAyashaH kriyate loke. cikitsAshAstre tAdRushaM kimapi na mayA dRuShTam.

  

Hope this explains both the examples in the previous verse, and the present one you have forwarded. I wish you would be able to read Devanagari fonts. Sorry for the delay.

  

With regards
