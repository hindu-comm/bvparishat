Thank you for tossing two more verses for scrutiny. For the first is not so simple, as it seems to be liable to different sets of syntactical relations, but the number of the plural form of noun *sukhAni* only need to be corresponding to six.*sukhAni =* sukhapradaani, sukhakaaraNaani. Only the realtion they can be related to a single person or every person. (as the case may be interpreted). All are six causes for happiness. The other relations intermediary may be mutually related or not unless there is any specific reason to deny such interpretation on grammatical grounds. It is preferable that the first two sets are related to a single person and probable the third one too.

  

Even though there is constant source of income, if the health is not constant (health is wealth is the modern proverb relating both) and naturally both are expected to be related to the same person. The next too ***priyA ca bhAryA, priyavAdinI ca***too by its disposition relate to the same bhArya(wife) who is dear to one and sweet in speech. (which may rarely coincide). Then remains the last set *vashyash ca putro {a}rthakarI ca vidyA*= obedient son and money earning learning (may be related to the son himself, as the first already has *nityam arthAgama*constant source of income. by which this additional qualification may be a repetition if referring to the same person). Now remains their relation to a person in all these causes of happiness coincide (by chance) or independently be taken as applied to different persons (in which case there is no mutual relationship between the all causes needed). This verse is from **ViduranIti** in the Udyogaparva of Mahabharata. In the chapter, there is an emphasis is seen on the numbers one to 10 enumerating merits, demerits, etc. This is one of the groups comprising of six members of ***sukha***-s. Now it is left to you and other members whether *priyaa* is to be detached its relation with the common substantive noun (which is absent in other pairs) or not. In both ways too it can be defended. IF you separate priyA from bhAryA, the priyavAdinI bhAryA is a separate cause, than priyA (lover). In modern culture, girl friend and life partners are different (just joking) and there is no guarantee that one will get a life partner a girl he had loved.

  



The second is a verse from Bharavi's *KiratarjunIya*3.40 the depth of sense is synonym with his poem. "*bhAraver arthagauram."*

  

yasho 'dhigantum sukhalipsayaa vaa manushyasamkhyaamativartitum vaa/

nirutsukaanaamabhiyogabhaajaam samutsukevaaNkamupaiti siddhih//

  

Literally, abhiyoga = constant effort emphasised, without worrying about the result (nirutsuka)(=persistently continued till the success is achieved) in short. The words are spoken by Draupadi to Arjuna, who was worried about his separation with her. With this background, the verse has to be understood and interpreted. The literal meaning of the phrases are not posing much difficulty in understanding individually. But their mutual syntactical relation makes it little more difficult. All the gerundive phrases in the first half are directly related with the abhiyoga =energetic effort (Monier-Williams, Sir M. (1988) which again is to be related with ***nirutsuka***free from anxiety. So, the first half of the predication goes like this:

  

Those who are engaged in constant energetic effort (abhiyogabhaajaam) in no way worried about any thing (than the target or/ without being daunted by the anxiety about the success) (nirutsukaanaam) either in their endeavor to achieve glory, or aspiring after happiness or to become outstanding among the fellow men (manuShya-saMkhyAm = manuShyagaNanaam, ativartitum = to become prominent in the total population. saMkhyA = gaNanaa ) (excel the glories of all other men = khyA = prakathane; saMkhyAnam = saNkhyA, samyak khyAnam prasiddhiH),
will certainly have the success (siddhi) in their laps (aNka) like a girl fallen in deep love (or it may be wife or lover) will approach her lover by herself (even though he is not showing any interest in her) (***samutsukA = anuraktA kAntA, iva***). This state of *nAyikA*is called *abhisarArikA***in rhetorics.

  

samutsukA iva siddhiH a\~nkam upaiti gives the analogy beautifully by ***saMasokti* **with the same words interpreted accordingly with the upmAna and umameya sentences. nirutsukAnAm aNkam samutsukA (anuraktA kAntA) iva upasarpati. "utsa^Ngacihnayor a^kaH" (the word a\~nka is used in the sense of utsa\~nga, which may mean lap and embrace (kroDa)). In short, the idea is that energetic effort without anxiety (about the success) will certainly yield success (achievement of the goal is due to constant energetic effort). This is the short of the idea in the verse, I can give. More can be culled out of it as you scrutinize more of it. This interpretation I got from the lexicons available to me and not depending on the English Dictionaries. (I only noticed today that they miss many of the shades of meaning offered by the lexicons in Sanskrit. Possibly I might have missed casually by overlooking.).

  

Sorry for the reply became lengthy. Hope the members would pardon me.
