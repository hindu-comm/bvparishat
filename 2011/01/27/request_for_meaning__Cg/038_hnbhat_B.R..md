Dear madam,

  

I think you have not read my second mail completely.

  

It has to be interpreted in both ways by shleSha and hence the print doesn't show the "avagraha" as it would bar one of the interpretations. Only by :shleSha" even without the sign, one can interpret in both ways. If "avagraha" sign appears it bars the other interpretation naturally. Thats why the editors haven't put the "avagraha" sign intentionally.

  

Please go through my mail if available. If not I will forward the same again.

  

With regards
