Dear Madam,

  

I Prof. Kannan was correct in assuming the insertion of "avagraha" sign which is optional by virture of which it can be interpreted in both ways (without "avagra" sign) and the source is confirmed as Hitopadesha 2.62.

  

The second half is to be split with and without "prashleSha" and related with the first assertion and the next assertion respectively. And then, the intended sense is automatically derived from the verse. Just reproducing the interpretation of the commentary thereon:

  

mEdhAvinaH = wise-men,vipattim = (kaaryanaasham)he failure of the endeavor,anIti-vidhi-prayuktAm = nIti-vidhinA vinA prauktAm, caused by applying the improper means (to achieve the goal),
apAya-samdarshana-jAm (produced in advance by the sight of the impediments = apAya-sandarshana) puraH sphurantIm iva darshayanti = will present a vivid picture of it (the failure) well in advance. In the same way, nIti-vidhi-prayuktAm siddhim = the success due to the proper application of the means (to achieve the end), upAya-darshanajAm = (produced in advance by the sight of the means or tools) puraH sphurantIm iva darshayanti ca = need not a translation again.).

  

In short wisemen are able to predict clearly the failure or success of any endeavor at the sight of the means or the impediments (depending on whether you follow the proper method or not) in advance.

  

Hope this has made the issue clear to be related with and without prashlesha of a+ before anIti.

  

With regards
