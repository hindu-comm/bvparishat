@Prof\. Kannan Sir,  
  
May i suggest that the verse "sachchidra.... " may be interpreted in a different way?  
I feel that it is the 'gaLige baTTalu'( in kannada, may be termed as ghaTI paatram in Skt.)  
along with the jhallari ( ref. to books like Maanasollaasa or samgeetaratnaakaras' vaaadyaadhaaya too.The jayaghaNTaa \> jaagaTE(in kannada) a bronze disc which is used to beat according to the time so that the "prahara-s" can be indicated) are focused here. In this fine verese of LOkaneeti fragrant with the apt employment of pun in words like sachchdra, taaDyatE etc. the work of a ghaTee-yantra is taken as an analogy to suggest the difficulties faced by the good who are compelled to stay in the compenyof the bad.  
GhaTee-yantra comprises of a big vessel filled with water and a small bowl with a small hole at the bottom floats in it. As time elapses, this small bowl getting filled with water sinks in the big vessel. Then the observers, having seen this, indicate the time by beating the bronze disc, the jhallari. Pls refer to the ghaTikaasthaana-s of our past well documented in the edicts where teaaching, study and research too used to go on.  
Pls bear with my "apaTeekshEpa" in this discussion!!  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
