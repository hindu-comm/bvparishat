Namaskaaraah. Lakshavaaram anugrheetaasmi.

I am very happy to read your long mail Dr. Bhatji. Now the explanation comes from the aurhority and is therefore acceptable.Thank you Dr. Narang for your comment. Since my doubts are getting cleared I feel more and more tempted to place before the scholars my difficulties. Uktam ca, kaavyashastravinodena…. iti!

Please tell me which is the sixth in the following:

arthaagamo nityamarogitaa ca priyaa ca bhaaryaa priyavaadinee ca/

vashyashca putro’rthakaree ca vidyaa SaDjeevalokasya sukhaani raajan//

Is priyaa to be separated from priyavaadinee bhaaryaa to make the number 6?

Please also help in understanding the exact meaning of the following wellknown verse

yashodhigantum sukhalipsayaa vaa manushyasamkhyaamativartitum vaa/

nirutsukaanaamabhiyogabhaajaam samutsukevaaNkamupaiti siddhih//

Dhannyaasmi

Bhate

Dear Madam,



I had re-typed the matter relevant to the verse in my recent message in roman letters in the forwarded message. If you were not able to see it, here I again reproduce it: In the forwarded message, he had typed the corroboration with the Ayurvedic texts.



Just I am re-typing the reply I got for the above verse from a a friend of mine. Just discharged from his "vicikitsaalaya" with his expert "cikitsaa" on the "vicikitsaa" on the verse you handed over to me.



shlokasyaasyaayam abhipraayaH. yataH, yena kaaraNena, doSha AgataH, \[tata eva nivartate =\] tenaiva nimittena tasya doShasya, shaantiH (nivRuttiH) kartuM yujyate.



It is only justifiable that the blunder commited by anybody, is remedied by the same person responsible for it. In other words, the person responsible for any blunder (doSha) is find remedy for the same. (should not be tossed to other for remedying it.) This seems apparently the purport. We have to get the person responsible, to do the remedy for the errors. (and not anyone else).



The second half gives the example well founded on the treatment of burning with minor injuries, as explained by my friend. I could not re-type whole of his explanation. But just re-type only related portion (if you can read the devanagari font, you can read it yourself).



agnidagdhasya kasyacit puruShasya visphoTasya = agninimittajaatasya budbudavad dRushyamaanasya sphoTasya, shaantish = cikitsA, dhruvam agninaiva = agnikarmaNaiva, kriyate. agnikarma nAma agninA dAhaH. ............ karmaitad bahuShu vyAdhiShu ciktsArUpeNa nirdiShTam asti. yaadRucChikadagdheShu tuttha-dagdham ityavasthA kAcidasti, .... tutthasya agnipratapanaM kAryam uShNaM ca bheShajam" iti



It seems burning in the case of skin burning, is the treatment prescribed.



Since he had to attend his "cikitsAlaya" he could attend to our "vicikitsA-laya" of the verse sent to his "cikitsAlaya" for treatment, he could not reply earlier. Hence the delay. We have to thank this friend for his expert advice on the point.



The example in the other verse, "karNakoTaragataM vAri vAriNaivAvakRuShyate" is simple experience in every day life. If water crept inside the ear, it pains for a while. But if we are in water, diving inside the water, forcefully opens ear drum and extracts the little water crept inside. It is the experience during swimming in a pool generally. But he could not defend such a treatment according to Vaidya texts.
