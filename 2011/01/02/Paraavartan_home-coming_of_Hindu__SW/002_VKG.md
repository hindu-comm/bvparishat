Pranaam  
  
It is amusing, that the issue of Paraavartana or Parivartana is quoted  
conversion.  
  
It is virutally and practically impossible for any one to convert or  
reconvert. None of the original texts have a concept of Conversion.  
Because, they do not take cognizance of any other lateral faith, as  
all of them are very recent (compared to the antiquity of the Faith.)  
  
Secondly, the term Hindu is also unIndian, I mean does not have  
sanction of our Vedic Culture. Should you like to be called by  
someone, by a nickname, as he likes?? (Persians started this word  
Hindu). It is similar to English people calling, Chennai as Madras,  
Mumbai as Bombay.  
  
And finally our identity, is Bharateeya. And our Clans are Aarya. We  
should be unequivocal in vehemently oppose any other nomenclature.  
(Or, if we are followers of Adwaita, any name/ identity or lack of it  
should be fine, for its impermanence).  
  
Only possibility for conversion is Praaschitta, for a fault of  
Adharma. deliberate or otherwise.  
  
Rest of the inferences border on whimsical interpretation, I believe.  
  
Regards to one and all.
