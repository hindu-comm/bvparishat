Hindu Katham Bhuyate  

How to Become a Hindu  

\*Vratyastoma\*  

One view is that vratya were people of North East Bharat responsiblefor Upanishadic thought and the origin of Bauddham. Four kinds ofvratya institutions are prescribed for homecoming (paraavartan ofHindus who have strayed away from the faith and those who did notpractice the Hindu faith):  

uddaalaka penance, a caandraayaNa, ashvamedha orvratyastoma.(Nagendranath Ghose, Indo-Aryan Literature and Culturalorigins, 1934)  

Kashatriya like Shivaji were vratya who had to undergo upanayanaprior to coronation.  

Most of the people of ancient India before the advent of Christianity or Islam were Hindus.Many ancestors of present-day muslims and christians in India were Hindu.It is likely that most of the present-day people in India professing religions such as Christianity or Islam can consider themselves to be descendants of Hindu pitr-s.

Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, eminent philosopher and former president of India, confirmed Swami Vivekananda's views in his well-known book,*The Hindu View of Life*(p. 28-29): "In a sense, Hinduism may be regarded as the first example in the world of a missionary religion. Only its missionary spirit is different from that associated with the proselytizing creeds. It did not regard it as its mission to convert humanity to any one opinion. For what counts is conduct and not belief. Worshipers of different Gods and followers of different rites were taken into the Hindu fold. The ancient practice of*vratyastoma,*described fully in the*Tandya Brahmana,*shows that not only individuals but whole tribes were absorbed into Hinduism. Many modern sects accept outsiders.*Devala Smriti*lays down rules for the simple purification of people forcibly converted to other faiths, or of womenfolk defiled and confined for years, and even of people who, for worldly advantage, embrace other faiths."...There are many organizations in India active in reconversion, some motivated by fears of non-Hindu dominance in regions once all Hindu. The Masurashrama in Mumbai specializes in reconversions through the*shuddhi shraddha*, purification ceremony, bringing dozens of converts back into the Sanatana Dharma each month. Masurashrama founder, Dharma Bhaskar Masurkar Maharaj, set a strong precedent in 1928 when he organized the purification rite for 1,150 devotees in Goa who had previously converted to Christianity. About the same time, Swami Agamanandaji of the Ramakrishna Mission in Kerala reconverted hundreds to Hinduism, as did Narayana Guru. More recently, two South Indian ashramas -- Madurai Aadheenam and Kundrakuddi Aadheenam -- have brought thousands of Indians back into Hinduism in mass conversion rites. Since the early 1960s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad has reportedly reconverted a half-million individuals through*shuddhi*ceremonies all over India. The VHPactivities are extremely distressing to Christian missionaries who, according to an analysis published in HINDUISM TODAY (Feb. 1989), spent an average of $6,000 to win over each convert.
