Respected scholars,

It is quite nice to listen to the various types of comments on the Vedas. The meaning of the word Veda has been intererpreted by grammarians on the basis of the evolutionary mechanism for words from their corresponding Verbal Roots, such as VIDL-JNAANE (*vid* - to know) etc.* vedyante jnaanaani ebhyah iti vedaah.* etc.etc like interpretations are possible to derive them. Somebody interpret in different way that *mantrabraahmanyor vedanamadheyatvam.* etc. Here, the question is how far liberal it is to interprent the *mantra*s, when they are properly accentuated,andareintentionallyas well as grammatically sound? As, I quote Patanjali:

*dustah sabdah svarato varnato vaa*

*mithyaaproyukto na tamrthamaaha.*

*sa vaag vajro yajamaanam hinasti*

*yathendrasatruh svarato'paraadhaat.*

Then if so, who can be the *aaptah* to interpret the* mantra*s to provide an exact intended knowlege which revealed to our ancient sages?

Regards
