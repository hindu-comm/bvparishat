Dear Murthiji

thanks for giving detailed note on many works done by various scholars. but the question is whether these researches are based on the vedas? true there are many works on rasaayana shastra and works like brhatsamhita do contain many sceientific subjects.

these discoveries/researches are based on the hard study of minerals/chemicals or some other matters. but not certailnly on the Rgveda or yajurveda. but what our rgveda or yajurvedas contribute to this worldly knowledge.



similarly we know Shri PR Mukund is high scientis working in US. but I request him to let us know which vedic rca inspired him to find what? please enlight us.

veeranarayana.
