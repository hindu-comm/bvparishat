Dear sirs¸

My purpose is not to remark sarcastically regarding the serious studies of Vedas. Even study of Vedas from modern point of view hasits own advantages. I do know it. I am notsittingin the attacking seat.But sometimes the relations shown in some articles I could not digest. And I ascertain that my article did not aim at any scholar but the articles I could not tolerate.



When a scholar(I can not remember his name) posted the verseअवतारत्रयं विष्णोर्मैथिलैः कवलीकृतम् । इति संचिन्त्य भगवान् नारसिंहमुपेयिवान्।। nobody objected by saying that was ridiculous attack on AVTAARA belief/ philosophy/ theory.

It is unfortunate that some of our own scholars can not digest the statements that can generate smallest smile. I had read a statement न प्राप्नुवन्ति यतयो रुदितेन मोक्षं स्वर्गायतिं न परिहासकथा रुणद्धि। (quoted by Maasti Venkatesha Iyengar, in his introduction of NammaUUrina Rasikaru, a Kannada work by Goruuru RamaswamyIyengar)in a Kannada book some where. I heard twice this famous verse from ***doctors***:

वैद्यराज नमस्तुभ्यं यमराजसहोदर।

यमस्तु हरते प्राणान् त्वं तु प्राणान् धनानि च।

Specialists in education field themselves cut jokes on teachers.

I would like to cite an example from विश्वगुणादर्शचम्पू by वेङ्कटाध्वरि. Being very good Vaiyaakarana and author of a grammar work (भाष्यस्फूर्ति), he composed the following verse:

टिड्ढाणञ्द्वयसच्चुटू ङसङिसस्तिप्तस्झिसिप्तस्थमिब्-

वस्मस्तानचि च ष्टुना ष्टुरत इञ् शश्छोट्यचोन्त्यादि टि।

लोपो व्योर्वलि वृद्धिरेचि यचि भं दाधाघ्वदाम्नाज्झलाव्

**इत्येते दिवसान् नयन्ति दिवसान् शब्दान् पठन्तः कटून्।।**



It generates only smile and nothing but smile. No Vaiyaakarana get enraged by reading this verse and shout: ***This is unfortunate that you are makingridiculous remarks on Sage Panini without whom the whole edifice of Sanskrit would not have existed.***



Let me say once again affirmatively: My posting aims at the shallow argument and not informative research articles of anybody.



If the scholarshave felt hurt even after reading all theseexamples, I sincerely apologize all of them.



Jagannatha.
