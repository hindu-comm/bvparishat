Namaste.  
I am not a Samskrita scholar. I am not scholar of the Vedas.  
I have been a professor of electrical engineering, with many, many publications and chairing many international conference in my field, all over the world.  
I can say this. My rudimentary understanding of what is in the Vedas has resulted in really boosting my ability to discover things in the wireless (RF)  
engineering, for which the international body Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) recognized the work by awarding me the title of Distinguished  
Lecturer. Just 2 months back, I was invited to give the luncheon keynote speech at the IEEE International Conference on Systems on a Chip (SOCC). I owe it all to what is in the Vedas.  
I find it extremely sad that our own scholars are ridiculing what is truly our wealth that affects everything. Truly tragic.  
I request the people maintaining this site to kindly remove my name from this list.  
Prof. P.R. Mukund  
  
PS: You can google search my name, and you will find thousands of hits that the "west" has raved about what "we" have done.
