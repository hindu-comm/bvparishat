I agree. It could be claimed that Vedic knowledge helps sharpen the mind generally, and it could even be said that it has other worldly benefits, à la आप्नोति ह वै सर्वान् कामान् आदिश्च भवति य एवं वेद and other such statements, but that is not to say the Vedas are themselves repositories of deep scientific knowledge. There are claims of science being found in the Vedas, but there is no instance of new scientific advancement (rather than an unconvincing claim of old, often elementary science) coming from the Vedas.
