I thank all the scholars cordiallyfor supporting my view. Now I would like to share three jokes. No.1 was told by Prof.Kannan, Bangalore. Both No.2 and No.3 I had heard somewhere else.



**No.1.**



Mr.X: You said that Veda has everything, right?



Mr.Y: Yes, everything.



Mr.X: There is a boy namely चामि। Does your Veda have any reference of that boy?



Mr.Y:Yes,Veda does have a reference of that boy in the mantra सत्यं त्वर्तेन परिषिञ्चामि।



**No.2.**



Mr.X: You said that Veda has everything, right?



Mr.Y: Yes, everything.



Mr.X: Does your Veda have any reference of नस्य (**sternutatory powder**)?



Mr.Y:Yes,Veda does have a reference of नस्य (**sternutatory**



**powder)** in the mantraएतावनस्य महिमा



No.3.

(Indian pride).

In a conference of archaeologists, a research scholar told to the audience:

\`\`I am research scholar from Babylonia. While excavating in Babylonia for research, we found wires of copper.It shows that our forefathers were capable in sending messages through cable.''  
An Indian stood up forthwith and told:

\`\`I am research scholar from India. While excavating in India for research, we did not find any wire of any material. It shows that our forefathers were capable in sending wire-less messages!''



S.Jagannatha.
