MAnanIya JagannAthamahOdaya,  
  
BhavatAm pattra-paThanEna nitAntam tiShTOs'mi.  
  
YadyadbhavatA nyavEdi pratyapAdi ca tattadakhilam nUnamanavadyam iti mepratibAti.  
  
Being a serious student of modern science and technology along with my first hand understanding of the vedic-vedangic-puranic literature with quite a lot of study in these related fields since three decades, I sincerely feel that much of the so called vedic science is utter trash.
Yes, our ancient literature has many references to science in the modern sense. But much of it is dated. It is sheer inferiority complex that has made many of our scholars and so called scholars to harp the broken strings of "vedic science". Those who know this home truth well also indulge in such draavidapraanaayaama-s at many instances often with an eye on artha-maana-mOha-bharama-s. All these self styled vedic-scientists are unable to materialize even small things that challenge the modern science. Any number of papers, projects, seminars and claims are only heading towards bhuktayE na tu muktayE... Hence i sincerely feel that it is time at least now to cast off this false mask and understand the Vedic and Sanskritic literature in the light of what our past masters said in the light of our own dispassionate logic so that the respect of both modern science and "vedic science" are faithfully restored.  
  
I once again appreciate your bold and pertinent remarks which are full of reason and rhyme.  
I know too well that this is very natural to you as I have the good fortune of knowing you since two decades. Especially your verses in anushtubh in the second mail in this thread are too sharp, crisp and conclusive. these remind me the impeccable BRhaspati sutra-s, Udayanacharya's AtmavidyAvivEka and other such masterly works that boldly challenged the ignorance of their times.
