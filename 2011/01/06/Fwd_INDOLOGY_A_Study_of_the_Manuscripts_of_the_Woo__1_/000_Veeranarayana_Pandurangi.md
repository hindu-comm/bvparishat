Subject: \[INDOLOGY\] A Study of the Manuscripts of the Woolner Collection, Lahore  
To: [INDO...@liverpool.ac.uk]()  
  
  
On behalf of the Woolner Project team at the University of Vienna, I am  
pleased to announce the public release of a new database of information  
about the manuscripts of the Woolner Collection in Lahore.  
  
Many of you will already be aware of the 9000 or so Indic MSS owned by the  
Punjab University Library, that were collected from 1913 onwards by Prof.  
Banarsi Das (lecturer in Hindi at the Oriental College, Lahore) and his  
colleagues, to form a memorial library for the Principal of the Oriental  
College, Prof. A. C. Woolner. Two volumes of a catalogue were published  
(1932, 1941).  Since that time, more manuscripts were added, and the  
collection has been kept in good condition. A small number of scholars have  
visited the collection in Lahore over the years. However, the Punjab  
University Library has not routinely employed a specialist librarian with  
skills in Devanagari, Sanskrit, and related languages, so the collection has  
remained hard to access for those unable to visit in person. It also became  
difficult, with the passage of years, to match the catalogue numbers with  
the accession numbers and shelf numbers of the manuscripts.  
  
Three years ago, a joint project was begun between the University of the  
Punjab, the University of Vienna, and Geumgang University, S. Korea.
The  
goal was to study and digitally preserve the philosophical manuscripts in  
the Woolner Collection, and to bring access and information about the  
collection up to date. The project was initiated and led by Prof. Karin  
Preisendanz, of the University of Vienna.  Two major goals of that project  
were to photograph the manuscripts digitally, and to create a database of  
up-to-date information about the manuscripts, with a strong prosopographical  
dimension.  
  
The Woolner manuscript database has been under intensive development, and  
yesterday, the Department of South Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies of  
the University of Vienna was pleased to be able to launch the database  
publicly, at this address:  
  
<http://www.istb.univie.ac.at/swc>  
  
Due to copyright restrictions, the digital images of the manuscripts cannot  
be shared at this time. We hope that negotiations with the University of  
the Punjab on this matter may be fruitful in the future. At the present  
time, only registered users with a login ID and password may see the images  
(approximately 6500 images, covering beginnings and endings of manuscripts).

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
