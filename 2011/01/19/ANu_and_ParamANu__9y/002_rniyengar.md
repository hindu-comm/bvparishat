The word ANu is Vedic! Please see the beautiful NaaraayaNasUkta:  
  
नीलतोयद-मध्यस्थ-द्विद्युल्लेखेव भास्वरा \|  
नीवारशूकवत्तन्वी पीता भास्वत्यणूपमा \|\|  
"Brilliant like a streak of lightning set in the midst of the blue  
rain-bearing  
clouds, slender like the awn of a paddy grain, yellow (like gold) in  
colour,  
in subtlety comparable to the minute ATOM, (this Tongue of Fire) grows  
splendid."  
(Swami Krishnanada's translation)

\> Jan. 19, 2011 Respected Scholars, Namaskar! ANu and ParamANu Discussion on Veda and Science, Vedanta and Quantum Mechanics etc is interesting.Quantum mechanics offer four quantum numbers to describe energy states of an atom. I heard (Sanskrit) words ANu and ParamANu. Who used these words in the ancient India first? Do they appear first time in Vaishes'ika Darshana? Is any internal clue to fix time of that Darshana? How are they defined in Vaishes'ika Darshana or in other ancient book of India? I assume that ancient Indians did not have knowledge of the foreign language words atom or electron or nucleus. Did they discover electron? If yes, what is its ancient Sanskrit name? I would like to request Sanskrit scholars to suggest me the etymologies of the Sanskrit words ANu and ParamANu. Why the name Vaishes'ka was chosen for that Darshana? Thanks. N.R.Joshi
