Regards, It appears that the word anu is derived from the root an which is in Prana. It was both in individual and Universal. Tlhe same concept is in aatman>atmos which has also the same concept. Perhaps, Vaisesika borrowed from the concept: to breathe and not to breath and made the choice of the root an. It is only hypothesis to be investigated in details. spnarang
