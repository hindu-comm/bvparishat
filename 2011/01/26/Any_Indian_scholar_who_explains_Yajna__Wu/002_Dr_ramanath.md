Recent authors like Staal are not basically different from Oldenberg but adopt modern techniques of description. But the list is by no means exhaustive. Reference as available till 1972 may be found in the above mentioned study by the present writer. Many have come up since then. The subject is so complex that helping just through an Internet forum is not possible. Information on the older works may be gathered from Renou’s Bibliographie Védique (1928). Post 1930 works are mentioned in the five volumes of the Vedic Bibliography that have come up.
