Respected scholars,  
I have no claims to Vedic scholarship. Nevertheless I have looked into  
some aspects of Yajn\~a usually translated as sacrifice, associated  
with offerings (living or material). The word appears more than 375  
times in RV. If we have to understand the earliest concepts about  
Yajna RV can be the only source. Later texts surely have developed on  
the RV thoughts. Since yajna is a living concept even today  
deciphering the oldest yajna would be difficult if not impossible. I  
present below to show that at least in one place (SaucIka Hymns) the  
yajna refers to offering of “moon” by “agni”, which is metaphorically  
a total lunar eclipse. Comments are welcome!( I will be out of country  
for a week. I will read the comments but response may be delayed.)

Saucīka Hymns  
Sūkta (10.52) is about viśvedevāḥ,(VD) attributed to the authorship  
of Saucīka Agni the traditional seer of the hymn. It is possible the  
name of this composer is notional and not meant to denote a real  
person. If viśvedevāḥ can be rendered as all-gods, saucikāgni can  
be translated as indicator-fire. This makes one wonder what the  
connection between viśvedevāḥ and agni was. Quite interestingly hymns  
(10.51) and (10.53) are also by Saucīka Agni and these also contain  
cryptic metaphorical references to devāḥ and agni.  
  
Hymn (10.51) is in the form of a conversation between devāḥ and agni,  
where in (v.2), agni wonders ‘how many gods have clearly beheld my  
form’. There is also an allusion, like in RV (3.9) considered  
previously, to agni hiding in secret places. The legend outlined in  
the hymn is briefly as follows. Agni had three elder brothers who  
were doing the work of carrying sacrificial offerings to gods. The  
three died due to the harsh vasat sounds uttered during the  
sacrifices. Hence the youngest fire known as Saucīka fearing the same  
treatment will befall him was hiding in waters, till viśvedevāh found  
him and requested him to come out and help in carrying sacrificial  
offerings to gods.  
10.051.05a ehi manur devayur yajn\~akÀmo....agne \|  
10.051.09c tavÀgne yajn\~o 'yam astu.....  
Saucīka agrees to their request under the condition that he should  
have prominent role in the yajna and that he should get the prayāja  
and anuyāja offerings. BD explains the legend at great length and  
concludes  
  
tavāgne yajna ityetat pratyārdhi svistakrcca sah\|  
yasya trīni sahasrāni nava trīni śatānica \|\|  
trimśaccaivatu devānām sarvāneva varāndaduh\|  
tato’gnih sumanāprīto viśverdevaih puraskrtah \|\| (BD 7.75,76)  
  
This establishes that bringing saucīkāgni was the prime role of the VD  
deities numbering 3339. The next hymn RV (10.52) devoted to VD starts  
with agni asking VD to instruct him as to how he should pass on the  
sacrificial offerings to them. In (v.2) agni mentions aśvins as the  
adhvaryus and samidh or moon as the Brahman in the yajna. Quite  
cryptically this samidh is offered as oblations to aśvins. The Vedic  
tradition does not identify aśvins with any specific celestial object  
but is quite clear that samidh should be equated with soma and the  
moon. The next verse (v.3) alludes to counting of days or nights,  
where the reference is to one who springs to life month by month and  
each day (aharahar jāyate māsi māsi). The conclusion that this should  
be a reference to moon is unavoidable. Agni being honoured by 3339  
gods is the theme of the last verse (v.6) of this hymn.  
  
Hymn (10.53) contains nine verses attributed to VD and two to  
saucīkāgni. In the first two verses (v.1, 2) VD laud agni who is  
sitting as the leader of the sacrifice. Significantly (v.2) is the  
mantra arādhi hotā prescribed to be meditated upon at the start of the  
Vedic darśa-pournamāsa rituals to be observed at every syzygy. In (v.  
3) it is declared  
  
Agni has arrived with the life given to him by the gods and has made  
our offerings  
to the gods auspicious. We have obtained the secret of the sacrifice.  
  
Even though tradition attributes this statement to VD, as a matter of  
fact the poet is describing a lunar eclipse, since moon as per the  
previous verse was the sacrificial offering. Moon was also the  
Brahman who in Vedic parlance is the presiding officer during a  
sacrifice. The word also means one who had grown big indicating a full  
moon. The life given to agni by the gods can be guessed to be  
connected with the number 3339. This secret of agni who was the tongue  
of gods for drinking soma was known to the composer.  
  
The next verse (v.4) is by agni declaring the best advice by which  
gods can overcome asuras, where this word is used obviously in a  
negative sense. Linked with the moon and the DP rites the word asura  
should have been a reference to the eclipse shadow. This verse is also  
prescribed for use in the DP rites (tadadya vācah prathamam masīyeti  
samāpya\| Āśvalāyana Grhya Sūtra 1.2). The next verse is also said by  
agni, but the second-half of (v.5) is more appropriately by the human  
poet requesting earth and sky for protection from earthly and heavenly  
pollution (amhasah). Sāyana interprets amhasah as pāpa, which in  
turn is usually rendered as sin. However, if we recognize that the sky  
picture of moon being offered in sacrifice by agni as an eclipse, the  
word amhasah refers more appropriately to the cosmic pollution  
caused due to the covering of sun or moon during an eclipse, a  
religious belief widely prevalent in cultures influenced by the Vedic  
world view. In (v.6) agni is asked by VD to follow the sun protecting  
the luminous path, which is a poetic but unmistakable reference to the  
ecliptic. In (v.7) the deities eligible to partake soma are asked to  
arrive in a chariot that is eight cornered or is bound eight fold.  
  
Hymn (10.54) is about Indra the supreme force of RV. It was observed  
previously that the covering of the sun by svarbhānu was removed by  
Indra (RV 5.40.6). Here again in (10.54.6) Indra is said to establish  
the light in the celestials.  
  
Hymn (10.55) in the first two verses (v.1-2) refers to Indra addressed  
as Maghavan with secret celestial forms. In (v.3) he is said to  
envelop heaven and earth with the same type of light. He oversees in  
various roles the five deities (panca devān), the seven-times-seven  
(saptasapta or forty-nine) entities season by season, along with the  
Thirty-four (catustrimśatā). The three numbers naturally refer to  
objects in the sky. Sāyana’s gloss takes the five deities to be the  
five tribes that include humans, which meaning is unacceptable as  
humans are not referred as devāh in RV. The next verse (v.4) is  
about Usas. In verse (v.5) the reference is to vidhu that is Moon,  
whom Sāyana interprets as Indra in the form of Time (anena kālātmka  
indrah stūyate). The verse roughly translates as  
He is woken up from his slumber running his course with many around  
him.  
He who died yesterday is living today.  
  
The next verse (v.6) is even more cryptic mentioning the arrival of  
the ancient red bird which has had no nest to dwell in (arunah  
suparnah anīdah). Again Sāyana takes the red bird to be Indra,  
equated by him with vidhu the moon. If the poetic language is  
disentangled the context is of a celestial event in which moon is seen  
and an apparition of red colour also appears. Mention of the red  
colour of moon makes a strong case for taking this hymn to be  
describing a total lunar eclipse, which in the all encompassing  
perception of the Rsi was a yajna. \[VD and agni and the number 3339  
appear also in the third book. This hymn RV 3.9 does not contradict  
the above thesis. To keep the post short I avoided the other details\].

\> I have not much to contribute as for as textual support is concerned. All the authorities with few exceptions have been working on the premise that Aryans came to India with their language and culture in India and as such their earliest literary product was the Rgveda. In recent researches this thesis has been demolished. RV alludes to pratna or older poets and almost all the extent verses are nutna or new. I think an attempt must be made to determine the older nature ans meaning of yajna, specially in view of the referencer to prathamaani dharmaaNi. The term aajya used for ghee served to Agni in ritualistic yajna is understandably ghee derived from goat.Ritualistic yajna precedes gavya or ghee derived from cow milk by thousands of years. Cattle domestication appears to have stated around 5th millennia before CE. We can not have a good idea of yajna merely on the basis of works written three to four years BP.Can there be a way out to look behind
