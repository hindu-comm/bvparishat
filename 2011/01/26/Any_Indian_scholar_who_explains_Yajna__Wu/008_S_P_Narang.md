Regards, As given by scholars, there are a number of varrieties of Yajna and its interpretations, relevance, contradictions, procedures etc. Sects have contributed a lot in modern ages with an objective of getting money also. The internal concept may be contradictory. Agne naya supathaa: is contradictory to raaye asmaan for a nivrtti maargii but for pravrtti maargii it is relevant. But yaam medhaam devaganaaH.....is a universal concept. Svaamii Dayaananda made the choice of the mantras for their procedure which may not be acceptable to tradition. For modern relevance, it must be selected afresh on the basis of the concepts needed which may not be universal but different as per need. My approach may be bad for tradition but it can make Yajna more for modernity which is necessary. I may refer to a book: Ish Narang: The science of Agnihotra:Delhi, 2009. Concepts in this must be elaborated for further thought. spnarang
