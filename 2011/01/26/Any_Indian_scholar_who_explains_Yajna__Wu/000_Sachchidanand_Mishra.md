Dear Scholars,  
An ex-student of mine is doing research on यज्ञ in a foreign  
university. She wants to know where she can find out some ideas and  
philosophical explanations of यज्ञ. She asked me. She thought it would  
be good if she could focus in her work on some text, because the  
subject, the vedic ritual (यज्ञ), is very broad and exists in  
different forms in many texts. If you know of any Indian scholar who  
explains यज्ञ it will be nice.  
With warm regards
