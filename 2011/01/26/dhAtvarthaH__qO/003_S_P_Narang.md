Regards, Notwithstanding the similar resultsthrough grammatical analysis, the locus of the philosophers differ on the issue. Mimamsakas care for the kriyaa or vyaapaara more than the person whereas Naiyaayikas care for the person ( prathamaanta) more than the kriyaa. That is why the words and the epicentre of the analysis differs. Most of the texts have mixed up the issue. spnarang
