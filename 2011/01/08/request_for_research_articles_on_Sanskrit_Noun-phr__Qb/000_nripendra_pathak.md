Respected scholars,

PraN.Ama

I am working in Sanskrit-Hindi Machine Translation area. My M.Phil. topic is "Challenges in Sanskrit-Hindi Noun Phrase Mapping".unfortunately I could not find any article on Sanskrit Noun Phrase ( in modern linguistics area) in our library.

If you find any article or you know any modern linguistics study on Sanskrit noun phrase, please help me by providing reference or link of the same.

I will always be thankful for your kind blessings.
