India is unfortunately only country in world where hating own country  
and its heritage is considered only sign of knowledge. Parody of Vedas  
by Dr. Jagannatha and its appreciation by Sri Dipak Bhattacharya are  
views under that category. They have not looked either into modern or  
ancient astronomy and consider Vedas as verses of illiterate persons.  
I am giving some examples of Vedic science much before any such  
invention in western science-  
(1) Measures of galaxy are given in all astronomical texts, various  
places in Rigveda, kathopanishad, also. That was not known when  
Einstein gave his theory of relativity in 1905/1912.  
(2) In 1902, Madhusudan Ojha had written about axial rotation of  
galaxy as manvantara of 30.68 crore years. He explained that human  
mind is image of galaxy as number of particles are same in that (100  
billions) as per Shatapatha Brahmana verses explained by Sayana also-  
so the axial rotation of galaxy was called Manvantara. No. of stars in  
galaxy was estimated in 1985. Till today, its rotation period is  
uncertain. Rotation of sun around galactic center is estimated between  
20-25 crore years-close to that figure.  
(3) Vishnu purana (2/7/3-4) state 3 earth/sky pairs and state that  
sizes of world structures starting from man to earth , solar system,  
galaxy, universe are in same ratio of 1 crore. It is also explained in  
several ways in most other puranas and 3 sky-earth pairs of vedas.  
This sequence of sizes is not explained in any of 22 alternatives of  
modern cosmological theories which have proliferated after strive for  
Unified theory. They all assume and explain homogenous, isotropic  
universe which is not seen at any scale.  
(4) Size of smaller worlds are successively smaller by 1 lakh-man,  
cell (Kalila), atom, nucleus, jagat particles of 3 types  
(chara=lepton, sthanu=baryon, anpurva=meson). 3 more levels are stated  
not discussed in modern quantum electrodynamics-(5)Deva-danava, (6)  
Pitara, (7) Rishi. In this sequence, Rishi should be about 10 power 35  
parts of 1 meter which is considered Planck's length in quantum  
mechanics. The time taken by light rays to cross this distance has  
been called Paramanu of Time in Bhagavata purana (3/11) which will be  
of order of 10 power 43 parts of 1 second. that is starting point of  
physics in 'Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawkins. Needless to  
say, this part was not inserted by me after reading Hawkins book. No  
theory of biology, quantum mechanics explains sequence of microworlds.  
(5) Kalman's Mathematical system theory assumes infinite system of  
world hierarchy. That is correct for mathematical formulation, but  
real world has only 13 levels of Vishva as stated above. Thus 'Vishva'  
indicates number 13 in all texts of astronomy. Abstract element of  
consciousness makes 14 levels of Bhutas (living beings) having mind.  
So manu=14 as in 'Agni-Jihva Manvah'. This Shantipath also was not  
inserted by me. As 'Vishva' means 13, Panini in his ganapatha also  
has included 13 words under heading Vishva.  
(6) Size of solar system in neither defined nor estimated till now.  
That is clearly stated in famous verse of Rigveda not inserted by me-  
Trimshat Dham Virajati, Vak patangay Dhimahi. Prati vastoh aha dyubhih  
(Rigveda 10/189/3). However, its meaning needs knowledge of Dhama, and  
its measure in 'aha' units. It is given in several other units in  
puranas also. Measures in 6 different units have mutual difference of  
10% whereas estimate of farthest Woort cloud in solar system has error  
of above 50% (75000 to 150,000 AU).  
(7) Till 1974, solar wind was known up to earth orbit only. Mariner  
probe in 1975 showed its existence near Mars. On basis of Bhagavata  
purana. Balakhilya sukta of Rigveda and Yajurveda (1/1), i calculated  
it up to Uranus orbit (3000 sun diameters from sun) and was mentioned  
in 3 papers published from Govt institutes of Melkote, Ujjain and  
Allahabad. The issue of Melkote was 1 year later than next year's  
issue and still carried editorial against it due to our natural  
tendency of hating our country. In other 2 institutes, no body  
understood implications and so it was published. It also calculated  
60000 balakhilyas of above 135 kms size at average distance of 60 AU.  
Uranus probe of 2007 found both these and then Pluto was removed from  
planet list. It estimated 70000 Plutonic bodies from 45-60 AU of above  
100 kms size.  
(8) On earth itself mines were completely surveyed in time of Prithu.  
Till today, prospecting of gold, silver is guess work only. These were  
mined all over world and are mentioned in vedas.  
(9) Aryabhata and Surya siddhanta have stated that north pole is in  
ocean and south pole is on land mass. North pole was reached by  
Admiral Peary in 1909, but in same year Bala Gangadhara Tilak had  
written 'Arctic Home in Vedas'. Amundsen had visited south pole in  
1931, but only in 1985, it was confirmed to be on land mass and not in  
channel between 2 land masses of Antarctica.  
(10) Rotation period of major axis of saturn has been stated to be 39  
in 432 crore years in Surya siddhanta. Till today there is no  
theoretical or experimental estimate of this figure.  
(11) All puranas and astronomy texts tell about 4 points on earth  
surface separated by 90 degree longitude. this is not possible without  
accurate geodetic survey of earth. Valmiki Ramayana, Kishkindha kanda  
(40/54, 64) tels that a 'dvara' was constructed by Brahma to mark end  
of east direction. That is location of Mexican pyramid, 180 degree  
east of Ujjain. That verse also was not inserted by me.  
None of the arguments can convince persons ignorant of any math or  
science who think that people in vedic era were more ignorant than  
them and stick to hating Bharata as sole sign of learning-Arun

\>  Great medieval thinkers like Shankara and Madhva went deep into metaphysical problems like the nature of reality in theirBrahma-sutra Bahshya.I find all this, particularly Madhva'sTattva-vivekato be helpful in my research on quantum reality. This has generated a good deal of interest in scientific circles in the West, but scientists in India are too timid to invoke Vedanta out of fear they may lose their caste as scientists. Western scientists seem to have no such concern.

\>  In my work on quantum reality I have argued that the problem with quantum physics is that there is no clear separation ofpratyakshafrom theanumaanaas there is in Relativity.This is reflected in the confused state of the postulates of quantum physics (formulated by Von Neumann).

\> It is quite nice to listen to the various types of comments on the Vedas. The meaning of the word Veda has been intererpreted by grammarians on the basis of the evolutionary mechanism for words from their corresponding Verbal Roots, such as VIDL-JNAANE (vid- to know) etc. vedyante jnaanaani ebhyah iti vedaah.etc.etc like interpretations are possible to derive them. Somebody interpret in different way thatmantrabraahmanyor vedanamadheyatvam.etc. Here, the question is how far liberal it is to interprent themantras, when they are properly accentuated,andareintentionallyas well as grammatically sound? As, I quote Patanjali:  

\>  
\> dustah sabdah svarato varnato vaa  
\>  
\> mithyaaproyukto na tamrthamaaha.  
\>  
\> sa vaag vajro yajamaanam hinasti  
\>  
\> yathendrasatruh svarato'paraadhaat.  
\>  

\> Then if so, who can be theaaptahto interpret the mantras to provide an exact intended knowlege which revealed to our ancient sages?

theories ofphysical science (this is the only meaning of the word science known to some Vedic scientists) in the Vedas is discovered onlyAFTERthe theory is disvcovered in the West. That the Big Bang theory exists in the Vedas comes to notice only after the theory is propounded in the West. That wireless existed is noticed after the invention of the radio comes to one's knowledge. The same is true of the Vedic television. Didany researcher of the nineteenth century note their existence in the Vedic times? Why they did not is a question.
