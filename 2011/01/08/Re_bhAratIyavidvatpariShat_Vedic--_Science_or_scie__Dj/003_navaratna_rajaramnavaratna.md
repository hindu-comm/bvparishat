 I thank the members for raising these questions. I am currently working on a book on **Reality in Vedanta and Quantum Physics,**** where these ideas are relevant and will be dicussed. At a metaphysical level, Vedanta and the scientific method are compatible as long as we remain in the non-theistic level. The question is the role of theism.



 Some of these questions will be addressed in the forthcoming **International Vedanta Symposium** to be held on July 6 and 7 at the Center for Indic Studies, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, USA.



 This will be followed by an **International Symposium on the origins of Civilization** on July 8 and 9.



 Please go to the Center for Indic Studies, University of Massachusetts for details.
