***Respected scholars, ***

***It appears to me that much of the confusion about the contents of the Vedas as well as the other scriptures of India and their interpretation arises out of consitently overlooking the chronology of the ancient and medieval scholars of India.***

***For example in the letter given below it is stated "***Great medieval thinkers like Shankara and Madhva*** ...". It begs the questions like***

***1. What is medieval period in BC, AD, Vikramabda, Kaliyugabda etc.?***

***2. When was Shankara born and when was Madhwa born?***

***3. Similarly when did scholars like Panini and Patanjali live?***

***In addition to chronology, it is important to understand the geography.***

***Yours respectfully,***

***DDMisra  ***
