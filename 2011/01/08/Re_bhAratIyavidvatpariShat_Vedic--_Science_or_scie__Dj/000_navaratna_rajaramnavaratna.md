 We should make a clear distinction between science, which is a body of knowledge and the scientific method, which is a metaphysical description (and prescription). It was formulated as a method by Francis Bacon, a contemporary of Galileo, but not a practicing scientist.



 It is an anachronism therefore to apply it to Veda and Vedanta and expect them to conform them to these much later ideas.



 Rational metaphysics which includes the scientific method is however of untold antiquity in India. Patanjali in his *Yogasutra* says:



 *pratyaksha, anumaana, aagama* as the basis of knowledge. (Here I limit myself to the study of physical world, which is what metaphysics is about and not the soul.)



 Great medieval thinkers like Shankara and Madhva went deep into metaphysical problems like the nature of reality in their *Brahma-sutra Bahshya.* I find all this, particularly Madhva's *Tattva-viveka* to be helpful in my research on quantum reality. This has generated a good deal of interest in scientific circles in the West, but scientists in India are too timid to invoke Vedanta out of fear they may lose their caste as scientists. Western scientists seem to have no such concern.



 The main point is we must make a distinction between primary knowledge (*pratyaksha*) and inferential knowledge (*anumaana*). The primary knowledge is called ontology and inferential knowledge is epistemology. (This is approximate.)



 In my work on quantum reality I have argued that the problem with quantum physics is that there is no clear separation of *pratyaksha* from the *anumaana* as there is in Relativity*.* This is reflected in the confused state of the postulates of quantum physics (formulated by Von Neumann). This was the starting point for John Stewart Bell and the famous theorem he discovered.



 The point of all this is, the issues are both subtle and complex and we should not seek simplistic answers. I hope to address some of these in my forthcoming book on the subject.
