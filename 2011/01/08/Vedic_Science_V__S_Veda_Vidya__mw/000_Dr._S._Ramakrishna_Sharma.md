Respected Scholars,  
  
Although the following was posted a few moments ago along the long thread  
of Vedic Science(?!) Discussion The Mail was rejected for crossing the limit  
of 4MB file. I uploaded the Invitation PDF which happens to be 7+MB  
  
You may download the Invitation which contains details of Sessions and Papers  
[Conference Invitation.](http://www.scribd.com/doc/46464277/Veda-Vidya-Conference-Invitation)  
  
\>Here I would like to propose for a slight change in the phrase "Vedic Sciences". Instead let us say it  
"Ancient Indian Scientific Literature (May it be pertaining to the Samhita or Brahmana and Arnayaka or  
Upanishads or Six Vedangas or Puranas and Itihasas or Independent Treatises on different Knowledge Disciplines).  
  

After discussions with [Physicist,Philosopher Prof. Sunder Sarukkai](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xepm7x_philosopher-prof-sunder-sarukkai-in_creation) at Manipal  
and a few others over net-chat I decided to change the title term "Vedic Science/s"  
of the Three Day International Conference at Udupi, which is being coordinated by me.  
  
VEDA VIDYA encapsulates vast area of Ancient Indian Scientific Literature(To begin with, this  
is a postulate which requires to be researched; the arena of unpublished Manuscripts not to be  
spared) and Veda bound(meaning having Shraddha in Astikyam) Traditional Resources(including  
experience based practices).  
VEDA VIDYA has the UPA-VEDAS(not listed in the above quotation. As rightly pointed out by  
Dr.B.V.K Sastry(who is participating in the Veda Vidya Conference) these are APPLICATIONS  
involving TECHNOLOGY(of whatever kind/type/grade let it be from the modern stand point).  
  
[Ayruvedic Biology](http://www.scribd.com/doc/35017855/ayurvis) would sound a blatant anachronism if "Biology" is reserved only for that  
Western/Modern branch of science discipline. But as it is used by Professor M S Valiathan FASc,  
an eminent cardiologist and medical scientist, and a profound scholar of Ayurveda, who  
has been pioneering the idea that this is a fertile field for original scientific research at the highest level,  
let us be magnanimous to extend condescending acceptance to the term, for the time being.  
  
A better term would be आयुर्वेदीयजीवशस्त्रं ।  
  
Foundation for Indian Scientific Heritage as a registered Trust with the active research support of  
a growing team of academically competent experts in the disciplines of Modern Science with sufficient  
mastery in Vedanga Vyakaranam and Samskrutam, Prakrutam and Pali, and other Indian Languages  
(who are NOT slaves of English Dictionary) hopes to redeem the generation from the ऋणत्रयं without  
hurting and getting hurt . Of course English will be given due place, which as a window  
language is good, but as a door it has dwarfed us, betrayed us.  
  
The Invitation to the Conference is attached. About 40 papers received, of which  
a few are only abstracts, will be made available for study and criticism/evaluation in due course.  
I really pity them who (sent their papers) are unwilling to attend the Conference for the reason  
"why should I, if my paper is not selected?"  
Humility is not a policy. It is a quality, a spiritual value; the foundation on which every other virtue is  
based and balanced.  
VEDA VIDYA,(both Para Vidya and Apara Vidya) denotes holistic, integral and integrated discipline  
of Sciences, Arts and Humanities. To isolate, separate and compartmentalize any or each of them would  
betray the purpose of Veda Vidya. Keeping in view the inner connectivity and inter-relatedness of  
different Vidyas embedded in the Vedas and allied literature we need to develop the world view of  
the Rishis from their platform of experience.
