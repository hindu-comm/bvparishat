Dear Kalyanaraman,  
Thanks for your response and elaboration. You are right; I did not  
want to get into details. I was just putting down my thoughts for my  
own clarification! As I see BVP is not a serious group of scientists.  
My own purpose here is to receive useful information from scholars  
particularly on subjects like MImAmsa, VyaakaraNa, NavyanyAya whch are  
Great Subjects by any standards. When relation between Science and  
the Vedas or Shastras are taken up I find we (Indians/Hindus)  
including members here are coloured more by religion rather than by  
the innate thought processes of the texts. This shows up mainly in the  
form of following dogmas:  
  
1) Ancient texts are sacred or holy. They should not be discussed  
other than in the way my sampradaya or MaTha or denominational Guru  
prescribes.  
  
2) All knowledge (past, present, future) is contained in the Vedas.  
  
3) I may not know what that stupendous Vedic knowledge is; but our  
ancients knew this.  
  
4) A corollary to the above is; Sanskrit texts written become more and  
more sacred as they get older. It follows a 13th Century text (if its  
date is known) should be more (religiously) revealing/sacred than one  
written in 17th Century.  
  
I am not very articulate in expressing my thoughts! But the above is  
my present personal picture that I can share with you. I find in  
recent years much of Sanskrit scholarship in India is caught in a time  
warp of the above kind. Since no serious original Shastric/Vedic work  
has originated in the last 100 years (My ignorance may be tolerated,  
corrected and excused) and hence arguments in discussions tend to be  
defensive bordering on the offensive.  
But I wonder whether Shastraic discourse was like this before Raja Ram  
Mohun Roy killed Sanskrit medium education in this country with the  
help of the British. My own short but sweet experience in the Mysore  
Sanskrit Pathashala during 1950’s was totally different. I can frankly  
say I have carried more questioning spirit from my teachers there (who  
had no English education) rather than from my school and college  
education.  
  
When it comes to the scientific method to which you have referred I  
think it is universal. The results of the method may be different  
depending on the starting axioms. Please see the point (2) above. It  
is more an axiom than a dogma. If this is expanded as it appears to  
have been done in the Upanishads, the Yoga and Vedanta darshanas it  
leads to approximately: ‘knowing that knowledge there is nothing else  
to be known’. This is the Spiritual knowledge of ‘existential unity of  
the universe’ or in short ‘mysticism’. While this is very real,  
fantastic and deeply satisfying to the knowledge seeker, in what sense  
can this be compared with modern western science? Indeed why it should  
be compared and for what purpose? When a western scientist in serach  
of fundamental knowledge gets a dim perception of the self-similarity  
of the BrahmaaNDa and the PiNDaaNDa he exclaims about the Vedic  
Rishis. This naturally resonates a tender chord in the average Hindu  
heart! Nothing more than that.  
  
Naiyyayikas did recognize “alaukika pratyaksha” but no serious  
investigation has happened on this (to the best of my knowledge)  
within the tradition. So when “Vedic Science” is mentioned I feel  
uncomfortable and I try to distinguish between ‘scientific  
information’ like ancient astronomical observations and ‘scientific  
thoughts’ (or scientific naturalism) which has lead to rituals,  
religion and practices, which is cultural and not always  
‘scientific’ (like the current UttaraayaNa TarpaNa)  
  
Planet vs Graha: I read with interest your question. But ancient  
Indian ‘astronomers’ used the phrase ‘pancha-taara-graha’ to indicate  
the ‘five planets’ (see aaryabhatiya). The word ‘graha’ indicates  
originality in the observations and the ‘scientific naturalism’ that  
is at the root of both Hindu astronomy and religion. \[ Planet means a  
wanderer. This wandering would be known only relative to the fixed  
stars when they were grasped or occulted\]. ‘taara-graha’ is ‘star-  
grasper or star seizer or star holder’. This in modern terminology is  
occultation of stars. Hence there is nothing wrong in the name  
‘Graha’. Moon, Rahu and Comets also occult the stars. Hence they are  
also Grahas, but only for religious purposes. Siddhantic astronomers  
did not need Rahu as ‘graha’ for their scientific work. They used the  
better word ‘Paata’ for the nodes. The present day confusion with  
chhaaya-grahas is the creation of astrologers. There seems to have  
been a theory in ancient times that Sun seizes moon or moon enters Sun  
on amaavaasya (Candramaa amaavaasyaam  
aadityamanupravis'ati....aadityaadvai candramaa jaayate\|\| Aitareya  
Bra. 40.5). In this sense sun also could be called a ‘graha’. The nava-  
graha concept in a finished religious form first appears in the  
Atharva-veda-parishishta. However, Ketu quite correctly was the Comet  
and not the descending lunar node as it is explained by Hindu  
astrologers on the popular TV shows!(Compare also: Nilakantha's well  
regarded but astronomically wrong commentary on the MBh.)
