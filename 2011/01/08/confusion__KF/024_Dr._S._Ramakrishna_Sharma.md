Dear Sri Kannan,  
  
Kind of you to put the pUrvaapara of the context.  
My Guru never used to allow any joke of any sort  
even on characters of Sri Ramayanam and Sri Mahabharatam.  
  
He used to mention that पण्डितलक्षणम् is दोषदर्शनं.  
That is very much needed in the context of the topics  
under discussion.  
  
The BVP Group will be duly acknowledged for whatever  
is drawn from the discussions and incorporated in the presentation of  
Keynote Documentary for the Conference, under preparation.  
  
Let there be more light than smoke and heat in and through  
the manthanam taking place here.  
  
Dhanyo'smi.
