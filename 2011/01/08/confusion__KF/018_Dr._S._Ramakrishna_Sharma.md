\>the beauty/significance of the sense of these words  
\> in their natural and original settings  
  

What else could be the natural and original settings  
than the living atmosphere without any value conflict  
of any sort(like compliance to keep and please  
and give company to those who do not value the values  
and the practices required by the values)?  
  
When the very Veda Mantras are used to tailor 'jokes'  
how can there be efficacy when such persons take them  
up for viniyoga?  
  
Vak-shuddhi, Chitta-shuddhi and vichara-shuddhi are  
essential for Mantra Siddhi. Even 'harmless' jokes using  
Veda Mantras, Names of Acharyas, Guru-Parampara  
betray ignorance and shraddha.
