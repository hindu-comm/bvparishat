Dear Prof. K.S.Kannan Sir,  
  
  
I am very happy that you have entered in to this debate at the right time. I have nothing but my sincere appreciation for your insightful mail. I hope that our scholars agree with it in total and save the respect and dignity of both Sanskrit heritage and modern scientific spirit.  
  
regards
