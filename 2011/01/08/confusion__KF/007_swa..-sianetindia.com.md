Hello,  
There have had heated exchanges between the Naiyayikas and Mimamsakas  
on Vedaapaurusheyataa. The statement "Vidhireva tavad garbha iva  
srutikumaryah pumyoge manam" of the Nayayikas is famous. Sri Narayana  
Guru the leader of Kerala renaissance has said: "Vedaapaurusheyataa  
means that we do not exactly know who the composers of the hymns  
were".The hymns are real since they have come down to us.  
Paurusheyataaa and Apaurusheyataa are arguments respectively of  
materialists and idealists the confrontation between whom will continue.
