Dear All,  
That there is confusion is clear. But I am worried because the  
discussions are not structured. I do wish the heat that is getting  
generated will eventually show some light to at least a few  
individuals. Precise definitions like in Nyaaya are important in  
science (by this I mean exact sciences such as physics/mathematics/  
astronomy... not political science!). The second feature invariably  
related with science is "measurement or quantification". As is known  
in the early stages of (western) scientific development these were  
weak but as of now these are taken for granted. This can also be  
called "rigour" in arguments, proofs, measurements, observations,  
writing, presentation of scientific books etc. since we are arguing in  
English, IMO the words "Vedic" and "Vaidika" should be discriminated.  
This would solve some difficulties. For example: as already pointed  
out by Prof.Kannan, The work of Swami BK Tirtha is Vaidika GaNitam but  
certainly not "Vedic Mathematics".  
If some one likes to distill some scientific information that surely  
would be contained in them Vedas have to be "analysed" in the above  
spirit. Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranykas and the Upanishads have to be  
sifted and analysed separately. The objections in some orthodox  
circles to include AtharvaNa along with the other Trayee have to be  
threadbare discussed. What comes out of such investigation will be  
valid within the ambit of "modern science". I feel “Vaidikas” as a  
community of intellectuals left out the initiative of doing this work  
to Westerners. At present we can only repent. Not that every one  
should approach Vedas in this fashion only. But for those who like to  
find in the Vedas "science as understood today" I find no other way.  
Argument of "apaurusheyatva" is weak as is well known to the Vaidika  
tradition. The best that one can logically say is that the "Aanupurvi"  
is fixed from time immemorial and we may not know the persons ( not  
just their names; some of which in the RV are notional and same as the  
devata) who for the very first time saw them or composed them. This  
would force one to accept that creation has no beginning. This  
interestingly can be a good scientific theory (not yet verifiable) and  
I feel Vaidika tradition through the PuraNas has very well developed  
this concept. The four Yugas, Manvantaras, Kalpas etc are such  
theories only; none of them historical or as connected with humans in  
India in an archaeologically verifiable Aanupuurvi. This helped the  
Siddhantic astronomers to express irrational numbers as fractions of  
high accuracy. This theory is again Vaidika but not Vedic, but I do  
not see any reason why it can not be called a scientific hypothesis.  
As is known Carl Sagan and others like him have praised this concept  
of time. If Sri Mukund and others like him find inspiration by  
studying the “Vedas” it should not be surprising. \[These happen due to  
mental and psychological forces working at deeper levels of  
consciousness which are the prime playing fields of the Upanishads the  
Veda-ends. These are real but not necessarily reproducible, verifiable  
much less provable by known scientific methods on which I don’t like  
to digress.\]  
The above can be reduced to a historical statement that the Vedic  
corpus is not completely available to us today. Scientific approach  
demands we better find the reasons for this. That once upon a time the  
Vedic knowledge/practices had stopped or got seriously disturbed is  
mentioned in the Mahabharata. Ground evidences are available for a  
natural disaster of tremendous proportion having occurred in NW India.  
Today this remains only as a distorted memory of the drying up of  
River Sarasvati. The Vedic texts received by the post-disaster people  
are the ones available to us in a concrete form. We are grateful to  
our ancestors for having preserved these against severe odds. But such  
a knowledge base need not look totally consistent due to long gaps in  
time and space. I strongly feel any discussion on the Vedas without  
accepting that the four parts may belong to different periods in time  
and nurtured by different groups of people will be futile. I am aware  
some persons try to telescope all Vedic texts and even the Itihasas  
into one big mass of PramaaNas and enforce their arguments. This will  
hold attraction in religious gatherings, due to cultural and social  
coherence. But this will not work in “Science”.  
Non-recognition of the above points leads to accepting mere  
“Paramparaa/sampradaaya” as pramaaNa. This results in distortions in  
practicing, teaching, interpreting, understanding or deriving  
inspiration from the Vedas. I should point out here that observing  
UttarayaaNa is a Vedic practice. It was also a correct Vaidika know-  
how in the PuraaNas, but got degenerated into mere letters without  
spirit in the medieval Smriti (Vaidika in some sense) books and at  
present many ‘vaidikas’ (of unquestioned sincerity) observe it on the  
wrong day. The PramaaNa for this is neither Pratyaksha, nor Anumaana  
not at all Upamaana but some kind of Aapta-vaakya(?)which is certainly  
not Vedic. I raised this question already once but none wrote a  
rejoinder.  
  
kind regards

\> I think we have to use the generic word saastra for any science and specify the particular branch with proper names like bhautasastra, sasyasastra, rasaayanasastra etc. In the famed

Even the word tantra has a broad connotation and is seen as a way, logic, application etc. Vijnaanam is taken as that knowledge which is confirmed by experience (ref. to Sankara-bhaashyam on the gita: Jnaanam vijnaana-sahitam). Hence there is nothing fundamentally wrong in using such words as Indian equivalents for science and technology. For that matter, no word, eastern or western in origin is "safe" and absolute. The mechanism of yoga and rudhi are too well known to you of course. But it is the viveka or the sense discrimination of we the users is very important. This can only work when we have a dispassionate and sincere mind to seek the truth. As abhinavagupta opines in his Lochana, all these words or classifications are too relative and yet practically workable, we have to cautiously adhere to nirvishesha-anubhava alone.

We must perhaps work out where the sets/fields of (the scope/aims of) Science and S'Astra overlap, and where not (with respect even to their denotations as well as connotations). If these are somehow formalised, and presented as a caveat at the outset, some confusion at least can be avoided. I cannot immediately think of a better solution.
