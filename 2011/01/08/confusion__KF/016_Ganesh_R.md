@Dear Prof. kannan Sir,  
  
Many thanks for your generous introduction of mine. As I woe much to your kind and friendly gestures since many years, this is not new to me too!  
I think we have to use the generic word saastra for any science and specify the particular branch with proper names like bhautasastra, sasyasastra, rasaayanasastra etc. In the famed Amarakosa, we have of course the word vijnaanam (shilpa-saastrayoh) which can also be used both in the sense of science and technology. Even the word tantra has a broad connotation and is seen as a way, logic, application etc. Vijnaanam is taken as that knowledge which is confirmed by experience (ref. to Sankara-bhaashyam on the gita: Jnaanam vijnaana-sahitam). Hence there is nothing fundamentally wrong in using such words as Indian equivalents for science and technology. For that matter, no word, eastern or western in origin is "safe" and absolute. The mechanism of yoga and rudhi are too well known to you of course. But it is the viveka or the sense discrimination of we the users is very important. This can only work when we have a dispassionate and sincere mind to seek the truth. As abhinavagupta opines in his Lochana, all these words or classifications are too relative and yet practically workable, we have to cautiously adhere to nirvishesha-anubhava alone.
