Dear Dr.Ganesh,  
Thanks. The Jain University meeting with contributions from your  
goodself and others was personally satisfying. We are still in the  
process of putting together a small group of dedicated persons to  
focus on some particular aspects of our ancient history and culture.  
The concept is emotionally very appealing but challenging in  
practice!  
  
best regards  
  
RN Iyengar
