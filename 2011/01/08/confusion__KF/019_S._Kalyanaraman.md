Kannan ji,

  

Thanks. Yes,शास्त्र is certainly a synonym of science.

  

शास्त्र**सिद्ध***a.*established by sacred authority. वेदान्तशास्त्र, न्यायशास्त्र, तर्कशास्त्र, अलंकारशास्त्रIn compounds such as these, the use seems to get associated with 'sacredness'.

  

In the western idiom of 'science', the tendency is to move away from 'sacredness' to 'materialism'.

  

Can the use ofशास्त्र be as restrictive as 'science' even when the word is applicable to both social and physical sciences? Would it be appropriate to translate chemistry asरसायनशास्त्र ?

  

धन्यवादाः
