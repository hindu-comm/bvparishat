 "Pranams to Joshiji!  
After reading your posting of above reference I got a doubt requesting you to clear it.  
May I be enlighted by explaining what is meant by "Priestly Sanskrit"? Is it a race-based classification? Have we ever had such classification lie Priestly Sanskrit, Royal Sanskrit and so onin our literature?  
What purpose is kept by the author in mind in using the phrase "Priestly Sanskrit"?  
With Warm Regards,  
Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty "





My reply.--- Dear Dr. Rani Sadasiv Murty,



Please do not worry. Nobody writes about racial division or racial theory about the ancient Indian history anymore, That theory is disappearing. Only thing left is Linguistics-Indo-Aryan, Vedic, classical Sanskrit, Dravidianetc.



In the article "Priestly Sanskrit" the author descibes variations in reciting Sanskrit mantras by small town or village priest who does not have much knowledge of Sanskrit grammar. This is all. And Shrikant put the paper on the website. PLease read that.



If you remember correctly in my postings on bvparishat, I never supported Aryan invasion theory. What I was saying that we have to give explanation of the large Indo-European language family. There are certain facts from archeology of the Middle-East that we cannot ignore. That took me to explore connection of Mahabharat history to the history of the Middle-East countries.



The second problem is the origin of Sanskrit. There I focused on only ancient technical San skit words.



In the scholarly discourse I cannot talk about revelations, or Yougika bala orSaamarthya of the ancient Indian sages. This posting is for many other members, so that they can correctly understand my position in my postings. Sometimes I have to pose questions to extract information from many top level scholars of this list. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
