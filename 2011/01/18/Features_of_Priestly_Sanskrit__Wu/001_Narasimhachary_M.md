Dear friends: Abhijnana Sakutalam of Kalidasa (Act V) provides the best example of "Priestly Sanskrit". The dialogues of the royal priest can be illustration in point. The way the Purohits speak is markedly different from that of others, although all speak Sanskrit. This can best be appreciated when an accomplished actor takes that role and speaks, with a peculiar intonation and style. My late-lamented Professor Dr V. Raghavan used to say that Kalidasa was a master of using different styles in the spoken Sanskrit suited to different characters.  
  
Sincerely  
  
M. Narasimhachary
