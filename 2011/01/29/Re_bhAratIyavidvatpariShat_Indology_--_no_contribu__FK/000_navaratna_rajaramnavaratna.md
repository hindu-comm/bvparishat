Dear Sri shatavadhani Ganesh:



 The 2012 World Sanskrit conference will be held in Delhi. I have suggested that there be a panel discussion on this topic. If that happens, you should be on the panel. In any event, you should be attending it, I'll take care of it.



 In the 2002 Conference in Delhi, I chaired a panel on the Vedic Harappans, how we should see the harappan civilization as part of Harappan. It went fairly well but Shrikant Talageri made a hash of it by raising irrelevant issues.



Best regards,

N.S. Rajaram
