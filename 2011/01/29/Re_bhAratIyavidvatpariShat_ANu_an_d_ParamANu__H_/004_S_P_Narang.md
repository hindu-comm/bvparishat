Regards, Please write the details whether Bhartrhari had the allusions to Jain ( anu ) philosophy. the verse cited is interpreted both for Buddhism and Jainism. Are there any definite opinion of anonymously quoted in Vakyapadiya II where a number of opinions are quoted for Vakya? Aiyar says Bhartrhari had no knowledge of Jain concept. If someone can give the opinion of Biardaeu-- French. spnarang
