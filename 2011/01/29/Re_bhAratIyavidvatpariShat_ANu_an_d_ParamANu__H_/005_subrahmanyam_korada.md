1. Allusions of Hari to Jain / Bauddha 2. Summary of Definitions of Vakya by Bhar.trhari in VAkyakA.n.da  
3. Hari had no knowledge of Jainism  
  
Following Hari's V.rtti and the commentaies of HelArAja and Pu.nyarAja the conceptes of Hari are discussed . There certainly are allusions to Bauddhas and Jainas . In most of the cases both of them go hand in glove. So the verse is not separately discussed .  
  
Even **KumArilabha.t.ta** in **S'lokavArtikam**(ApohavAda etc) mostly refers to Bauddhas only .  
  
A theory gets established after a prolonged VAda and VivAda --  
  
kAvyasyAtmA dhvani.h - **budhA.h**  
dhvane.h abhAva.h - **apare**  
bhAkta.h -- **anye**  
vAcAm avi.saya.h - **kecit**  
**asti dhvani.h - Anandavardhana.h  
**  
It is believed that Bhart.rhari belongs to 5 th Century AD . Even if we do not go into the chronological details the Theories of Jainas and Bauddhas were there (**svalak.sa.nam svalak.sa.nam or sarvam svalak.sa.nam - Bauddhas ) before Hari .**  
  
As far as Jainas and Bauddhas are concerned it is the same **VijnAnam** that is both VAkya and VAkyArtha .  
  
Since time immemorial (anAdi) there has been 'bhedavAsanA' in 'VijnAna' in terms of VAkya and VAkyArtha . As a result a thing (here VAkya and VAkyArtha) , although there is no 'VibhAga' and 'RUpa', appears to be having the same due to 'aropa' -- this is the **S'AkyasiddhAnta** .  
  
The same is not mentioned separately by Hari as VAkya falls under ' **buddhyanusamh.rti.h** ' .  
  
so far as the VAkyArtha is concerned it is akin to ' pratibhA vAkyArtha.h ' of VaiyAdkara.nas --  
  
[vicchedagraha.ne](http://vicchedagraha.ne)'rthAnAm **pratibhAnyaiva jAyate** I  
**vAkyArtha iti tAmAhu.h** padArthairupapAditAm II (VP 2-143)  
  
Sambandh.h -- in Bauddhamata **'kAryakAra.nabhAva**' is the sambandha between VAkya and VAkyArtha .  
  
Hari explains the reason --  
  
avikalpe'pi vAkyArthe vikalpA bhAvanAs'rayA.h I  
atrAdhikara.ne **vAdA.h pUrve.sAm bahudhA gatA.h** II (2-116) etc .
