*January 29, 2011*



 In general I agree with Pollock's views and I wish him success on his Indian classics series. My one reservation is over hisobservation:



 "I have been coming to India for long, but in all these years I am yet  
to meet a student at the university level who knows enough Sanskrit  
that could fill this cup of coffee."  
  
 I can only say that he has been going to the wrong places. I can find him at least a dozen students in and around Bangalore who would be happy to engage him in conversation in Sanskrit. The real problem is the competence and capacity of Sanskritists in Western academia. They are quite articulate in English but become tongue tied when they have to express themselves in Sanskrit. This was painfully appparent when Michael Witzel of Harvard toured India in 2009 summer when schoolchildren exposed his limitations in Sanskrit.



 Of course, no Western Sanskritist has produced any worthwhile literature in Sanskrit, while many Indians have attained distinction in English and other languages. I hope Sheldon Pollock proves to be an exception.
