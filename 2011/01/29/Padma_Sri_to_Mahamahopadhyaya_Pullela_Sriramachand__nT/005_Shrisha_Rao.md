Honoring a great scholar late in life is not itself inexcusable, but consider that other Padma Shri awardees in this and recent years include actors/actresses Saif Ali Khan, Irfan Khan, Deepika Padukone, Aishwarya Rai, Tabu, Kajol, etc., besides some sportspersons (some of whom have had only a couple of good years, one good tournament, etc.) and some politically-connected littérateurs whose depth of scholarship is far from indisputable.

Using the Padma awards to further political sponsorship and the cult of celebrity is a serious lapse, and demeans the awards themselves. Romila Thapar, for all her well-documented foibles, was quite right to reject such an award a few years ago stating that she would only accept academic and professional awards rather than those given by the government. I wish more scholars would take a stance similar to Grigori Perelman, who declined the Fields Medal (the highest award in mathematics) saying that those wanted to give him that award were not qualified to evaluate his work, even positively.
