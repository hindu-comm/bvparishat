With due respects to all scholarly members, I humbly submit the following.  

  
Let us all greet the great scholar and contributor of our times - Pullela Sri Ramachandrudu. Padma awards are given in recognition of the service to the nation. Though very late, His services are recognised.  
  
We need not evaluate the awards on the basis of the recipients.  
  
At the same time, in order to keep the decorum of the list, let us NOT compare any scholar by name.Wish members will understand the spirit of my words.  
  
regards,  
shrivara

 A padmashri award means nothing to a great scholar like Sri Ramachandrudu. It is given to second rate movie stars and sports stars Sania Mirza and second raters like Sheldon Pollock.



 I see a Padma Sri as an insult, given by bureaucrats. A real scholar doesn't need such bread crumbs thrown at him. I would reject it if ever awarded.
