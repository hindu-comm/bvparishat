SarvEbhyO namaH,  
  
It is indeed very heartening to know that a great scholar and poet Dr. P.Raamachandrudu gaaru, a tireless worker in the field of translating the vast treasure of Sanskrit in to Telugu along with very insightful interpretations, has been honored with the Padmashree award.  
It is true that Sri. Pullela gaaru and the likes of him have to be honored with even more greater awards and recognitions. However, I really feel happy that Sri.Pullela gaaru, a silent worker who self-lessly serves the divine tongue is noticed by the people at the centre of power. I am really proud that I know personally sri. Ramachandrudu and have read most of his works.. Here is my heart felt regards to him:  
  
padmashreeh padmashreeh  
  
prajvalti mudaa prabhaata-saaraseeva  
  
pullela-vidushO hRudayE  
  
samskRuta-sUryENa haasitaa ruchiraa  
  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
