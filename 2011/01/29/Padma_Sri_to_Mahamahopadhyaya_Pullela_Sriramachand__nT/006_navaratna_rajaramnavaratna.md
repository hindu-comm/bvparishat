 A padmashri award means nothing to a great scholar like Sri Ramachandrudu. It is given to second rate movie stars and sports stars Sania Mirza and second raters like Sheldon Pollock.



 I see a Padma Sri as an insult, given by bureaucrats. A real scholar doesn't need such bread crumbs thrown at him. I would reject it if ever awarded.
