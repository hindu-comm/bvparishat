सर्वेभ्योविद्वद्भ्योनमः



This being a forum where great scholars contribute, I thought silence was golden. Today I make bold write to express my happiness at the news of महामहोपाध्यायः पुल्लेलश्रीरामचन्द्रुडु getting the Padma Sri award.I am sure many in this list know of him. The only sad part is that this greatmanhad to get this honour one yearafter Padma SriSheldon Pollock. I have reada fewarticles by Sri Pollock butdid not find anything (to the extent mylimitedknowledge permitted) to establish him as a bigger scholar than MM P. Sriramachandrudu. I hope that we will have more Padma awardees from amongst Sanskrit scholars in the future.

\> Precise textual references, please. Also an explanation of why the words actually found in the texts are best accounted for with your understanding (= kindly spell out how one starts with the literal or etymological or traditional meanings of the words (the meanings given in ko;sas, dictionaries, received Sanskrit commentaries, etc.) and arrives at the meaning you attach to them; clarify why your meaning is better). What is the word used for 'galaxy'? Is it constant through the texts? How do we know that it means exactly the same thing as 'galaxy' in modern astronomical texts? If more than one word is used, are the attested words definitely synonymous? If not, how do their meanings or shades of meaning differ?

\>

\>\> (2) In 1902, Madhusudan Ojha had written about axial rotation of

\>\> galaxy as manvantara of 30.68 crore years. He explained that human

\>\> mind is image of galaxy as number of particles are same in that (100

\>\> billions) as per Shatapatha Brahmana verses explained by Sayana also-

\>\> so the axial rotation of galaxy was called Manvantara.

\> Precise reference to where Ojha said what you attribute to him, please. Which part of the ;Sata-patha Braahma.na and Saaya.na did he refer to? Why do you think his understanding is correct or better? How was the information that a/the galaxy and human mind have the same number of particles obtained? Did Ojha mean a particular galaxy or a galaxy in general? (By the way, I have great respect for Pt. Madhusudan Ojha as an innovator. At a difficult time for traditional scholarship, he showed how independent and creative it could be. The tradition needed such a model. I wish there were more like him. Whether he is right or wrong in this or that respect is for the specialists of each field to decide.)

\>

\>\> (3) Vishnu purana (2/7/3-4) state 3 earth/sky pairs and state that

\>\> sizes of world structures starting from man to earth , solar system,

\>\> galaxy, universe are in same ratio of 1 crore. It is also explained in

\>\> several ways in most other puranas and 3 sky-earth pairs of vedas.

\>\>

\> Since the Puraa.nas vary considerably in containing or not containing particular passages, will you kindly give the wording of the passage(s) you have in mind? Is it found in any critical edition or an edition based on more than one manuscript from different parts of India? Are there any variant readings available? What precisely are the "3 earth/sky pairs," that is, what are the Skt equivalents meant by your English terminology? The same question with respect to "solar system." What is the word used for 'system' in your sources? If no particular word is used, what leads you to conclude that a 'system' is meant?

\>

\>\> (4) Size of smaller worlds are successively smaller by 1 lakh-man,

\>\> cell (Kalila), atom, nucleus, jagat particles of 3 types

\>\> (chara=lepton, sthanu=baryon, anpurva=meson). 3 more levels are stated

\>\> not discussed in modern quantum electrodynamics-(5)Deva-danava, (6)

\>\> Pitara, (7) Rishi. In this sequence, Rishi should be about 10 power 35

\>\> parts of 1 meter which is considered Planck's length in quantum

\>\> mechanics. The time taken by light rays to cross this distance has

\>\> been called Paramanu of Time in Bhagavata purana (3/11) which will be

\>\> of order of 10 power 43 parts of 1 second. that is starting point of

\>\> physics in 'Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawkins.

\>

\> Again, a focused and well laid-out demonstration of this passage will be much appreciated. In particular, how did you determine that the Skt words you cite have the meanings you attribute to them?

\>

\>\> (5) ... 'Vishva' indicates number 13 in all texts of astronomy.

\>

\> Some examples with text specification, please.

\>

\>\> As 'Vishva' means 13, Panini in his ganapatha also

\>\> has included 13 words under heading Vishva.

\>

\> Which part of the A.s.taadhyaayii do you have in mind? Are there other examples in which Paa.nini, who is known for including only what grammar needs -- who is admired for his keen sense of relevance, allows extraneous information, such as the metaphorical meaning of a word, to determine the number of items he will treat under a particular heading?

\>

\>\> (6) Size of solar system in neither defined nor estimated till now.

\>\> That is clearly stated in famous verse of Rigveda not inserted by me-

\>\> Trimshat Dham Virajati, Vak patangay Dhimahi. Prati vastoh aha dyubhih

\>\> (Rigveda 10/189/3). However, its meaning needs knowledge of Dhama, and

\>\> its measure in 'aha' units. It is given in several other units in

\>\> puranas also. Measures in 6 different units have mutual difference of

\>\> 10% whereas estimate of farthest Woort cloud in solar system has error

\>\> of above 50% (75000 to 150,000 AU).

\>

\> Why should this .rk be viewed as concerned with the solar system? What did the ,Rgveda have to gain by stating that the size of the solar system is not defined or estimated? If your point is that what is not known now was also not known in the time of the .Rgveda, how does that support your main point that scientific knowledge of a far advanced kind is contained in the Veda? Does it, in fact, not contradict your main point.

\>

\>\> (7) On basis of Bhagavata purana. Balakhilya sukta of Rigveda and Yajurveda (1/1), i calculated

\>\> it \[= solar wind\] up to Uranus orbit (3000 sun diameters from sun) and was mentioned

\>\> in 3 papers published from Govt institutes of Melkote, Ujjain and

\>\> Allahabad. The issue of Melkote was 1 year later than next year's

\>\> issue and still carried editorial against it due to our natural

\>\> tendency of hating our country.

\>

\> How does Melkote editor's not agreeing with your calculation mean that we Indians have a natural tendency to hate our country? If it is a natural tendency, can we really do anything about it? Why (or how) was it given only to a particular country/people?

\>

\>\> (8) On earth itself mines were completely surveyed in time of Prithu.

\>\> Till today, prospecting of gold, silver is guess work only. These were

\>\> mined all over world and are mentioned in vedas.

\>

\> I am aware of passages which can reasonably be taken to mean that, according to traditional historical memory, P.rthu started mining and agriculture. Which passage(s) can be taken to mean "completely surveyed"?

\>

\>\> (9) Aryabhata and Surya siddhanta have stated that north pole is in

\>\> ocean and south pole is on land mass. North pole was reached by

\>\> Admiral Peary in 1909, but in same year Bala Gangadhara Tilak had

\>\> written 'Arctic Home in Vedas'. Amundsen had visited south pole in

\>\> 1931, but only in 1985, it was confirmed to be on land mass and not in

\>\> channel between 2 land masses of Antarctica.

\>

\> Specific passages from Aarya-bha.ta and Suurya-siddhaanta, please. The exact intent and logic of your next two statements is unclear. Are you saying that Tilak's book was instrumental in Admiral Peary's success in reaching the North Pole?

\>

\>\> (10) Rotation period of major axis of saturn has been stated to be 39

\>\> in 432 crore years in Surya siddhanta. Till today there is no

\>\> theoretical or experimental estimate of this figure.

\>

\> Precise text reference, please.

\>

\>\> (11) All puranas and astronomy texts tell about 4 points on earth

\>\> surface separated by 90 degree longitude. this is not possible without

\>\> accurate geodetic survey of earth.

\>

\> Exactly which passages do have you in mind? If the earth was thought of as circular, why would the idea of four points separated by 90 degrees not suggest itself to someone in a culture advanced in geometry \*without an accurate geodetic survey\*?

\>

\> You are obviously a very widely read man with considerable imagination. If your statements were written with an awareness of the need for logical and philological exposition that many members of this forum feel, the effort you invested would have been will be rewarding. Hence this request to follow the usual method and standards found in presentations of the historical kind.

\>

\> You may think that I am asking for too many citations. If the statements you made were of the kind 'Kaalidaasa wrote the Raghu-va.m;sa.' I would not have asked you to provide these citations. Actually, if you wanted to be taken as a true historian (of the field you covered), you should have provided these citations without anyone asking you for them. Scholars do not assert without specifying the evidence and explaining how it supports the assertion. This forum, as I understand it, is for scholars and for the training of future scholars by providing examples they can emulate. You are clearly a scholar. It should not take you much effort to make presentations like a scholar and fulfill your obligation to this forum.

\>

\> If in answering my questions you feel the need to refer to your published writings, please refer only to those writings in which the expected method is followed and which are truly pertinent. Also, please give all the particulars of publication, so that consulting or ordering those publications will be possible for persons like me.

\>

\> If you think, what I am expecting will take much time, please invest that time. I am in no hurry.
