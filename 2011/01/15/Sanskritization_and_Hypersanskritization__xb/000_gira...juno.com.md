Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Sanskritization and HyperSanskritization



Many of us love Sanskrit and engage in promoting it. On this list I raised question in the past about "Technical Sanskrit" . It means to understand the existing Sanskrit technical terminology from the ancient Indian scientific books and then create new terminology for modern scientific terms. However in the enthusiasm of proving that Sanskrit can be used for writing articles on Computer science or on any other modern science, lovers of Sanskrit knowingly or unknowingly engage in what I call "Sanskritization" and in some cases "HyperSanskritization".



Please visit the website "Learn Sanskrit-Sanskritam Shikshaamahai" and look at "Dictionary of Technical Terms" created by Shri Ramachandra Rao. Such efforts were going on for many years and even by well known Sanskrit scholars. Experience tells that such Sanskritized terminology does not become popular and people return to English technical terms. Terminology has to be internally consistent. My efforts are directed to that end. So repeatedly I write more attention should be given to semantics of Sanskrit shabdas.



My thoughts: In order to create reasonable terminology one has to fix meanings of Upasargas. One has to fix meanings of minimum number of Sanskrit Dhaatus frequently used in technical terminology. I know the prevalent view of Sanskrit scholars-Upasargas have no fix meanings and Sanskrit Dhaatus have multiple meanings. This has created a lot of confusion in creating new modern scientific terminology and interpreting the existing terminology from the ancient books. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
