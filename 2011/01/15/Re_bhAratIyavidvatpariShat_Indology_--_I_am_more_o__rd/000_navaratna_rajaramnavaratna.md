 I am optimistic. Correcting distortions and making it part of the academic mainstream should be done independent of Sanskrit. The state of Sanskrit is quite healthy judging by the enormous interest in Sanskrit. The just held Sanskrit Sameelan in Bangalore was absolutely jam packed. Almost all the books were sold out.



 We need to focus our attention on building up academic programs which reflect our viewpoint. I have in mind institutions like the Center of Indic Studies at UMass. I am sure there are others, but this is one I know well.



 We should become the academic mainstream and not just keep fighting past distortions and complaining. We need to get out of the reactive frame of mind and become proactive by building an alternative. This is what I have been doing ever since I formed the **Naimisha Research Foundation** in 2000, which held its first workshop in 2000 March with participation by Frawley, Kalyanaraman, Talageri, Shatavadhani Ganesh, N. Jha (in absentia, I read his paper). Sri Brijmohan Thapar, Sudarshan Maini and several others have been supporting our efforts. So it is our job to carry things forward.



 Coming back to 2000, it is no accident that Witzel and Romila Thapar launched their attack on Jha and myself, also in 2010, a few months after the Naimisha Workshop and the release of my book with Jha. Although the 'Harappan Horse' article carried Witzel-Farmer name, the two were unknown in India at the time until Romila Thapar introduced them to N. Ram of *Frontline.*



** To his credit, Ram later contacted me and published my response along with an interview. But Witzel, true to character, keeps citing only his article and never my response. I faced off with Witzel twice after that, in 2006 at Dartmouth, MA and last year in Cambridge, MA where he sat through my two hour talk on Vedic-Harappan relationship.



 He has done nothing new in the past ten years except repeating the discredited 'No Harappan Horse' dogma. There has been enormous progress in natural history and genetics in particular none of which he and his students have the slightest comprehension of. They don't know and they don't want to know.



 But the world has moved on, judging from over 20 talks I gave in U.K., U.S., India and Europe last year alone.In fact, I am leaving for Delhi tomorrow for a workshop on these topics at which the Oxford geneticist Stephen Oppenheimer, archaeologist R.S. Bisht and others will be present. It is being hosted by Jyotsna Suri (wife of the late Lalith Suri) who is a staunch supporter of our program.



 The important thing is for us to be proactive and build our own program and quality sources. I see the ***People's History of India*** project that we have just launched as the next phase. My hope is our legacy will be something positive-- a new foundation, and not just complaints about past injustices and exhortations to young people to continue battles that we should have fought.



Let us join in this effort to build a new foundation for future generations.



N.S. Rajaram
