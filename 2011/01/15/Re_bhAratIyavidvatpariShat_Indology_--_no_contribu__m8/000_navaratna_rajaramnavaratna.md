*January 15, 2011*



** Sanskrit language and literature existed for thousands of years before Indology and Indologists came on the scene. When such people project their importance now and say 'after us, the deluge' it is for their survival, not the survival of Sanskrit.



 The only contribution Indologists have made is bringing out editions of some Sanskrit books. To take one example, what contribution to Sanskrit has Edwin Bryant who is quoted as an authority even by Indians, has ever made? Yet, he is regarded as one of the more knowledgeable Indologists by gullible Indians (also ignorant of Sanskrit).



 Here is a stark comparison. Indians started learning English at about the same time that Europeans started learning Sanskrit-- in the 18th century. Many Indians have excelled in English and have attained distinction in English literature. Can anyone show me a single work, even a *subhaashita* by a European in Sanskrit in the same two centuries and more?



 When the Harvard Sanskrit professor Michael Witzel toured India in 2009, his ignorance was exposed by schoolchildren. But Max Muller was smart, he never came to India and succeeded in preserving his mystique. These Emperors have no clothes.



 These Indologists have used Sanskrit for their own benefit, written about Sanskrit, but have made no contribution to it. It is just a means of livelihood to otherwise unemployable people. **It is all clothes and no Emperor.**



 Indology, Indo-European Studies, etc is a Holy Cow that has enabled its priesthood to make a good academic living even though the cow has given no milk.



 **LET US ORGANIZE A PANEL DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC AT THE 2012 WORLD SANSKRIT CONFERENCE.**
