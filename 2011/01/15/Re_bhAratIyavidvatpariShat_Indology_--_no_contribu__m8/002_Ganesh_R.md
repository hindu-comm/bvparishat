@Dr.Navaratna Rajaram,  
  
Sir, it is very well said. Only Indians can, must and will save Sanskrit and not any other western 'scholars'. In one of my articles too I had made my observations on similar lines as to the lack of western scholars' original Sanskrit writing -barring a very few exceptions which have least bearing on the aspects of rich form and content- and had juxtaposed this with the astounding achievements of Indians like Sri Aravind maharshi. The best and greatest achievement of any language has to be realized in the poetic and scientific usage of the same and in this regard 90% of the western scholars and their Indian counterparts
miserably fail. Hence it is high that we realize the hard truth that our Sanskrit can only be served by us.
