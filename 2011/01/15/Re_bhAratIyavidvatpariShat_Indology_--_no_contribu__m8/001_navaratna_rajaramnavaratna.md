 (1) AllowIndology to die a natural death. If Indians cannot save Sanskrit, we cannot expect Western Indologists tosave it. at least, don't allow them to save themselves in the name ofsaving Sanskrit. That is what they are trying to do now.



 (2) Establish India Studies programs in universities; i.e., gain control of academia.



 (3)Produce academically credible works and authoritative sources. This is what we are trying to do with our *Peopl'eHistory of India* project. This is only a beginning.
