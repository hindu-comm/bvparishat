 This goes with Parpola getting Rs 10 lakhs from Karunanidhi as an expose of the Dravidian movement. The Dravidian University, like the Dravidian ideology is the creation of Christian missionaries.



 The prime mover in the creation of the Dravidian University was the late Father Kamil Zvelibil.

## 8,029 Dravidian PhDs rigged

Jan 14 2011, Hyderabad

Jan. 13: The state government is all set to cancel 8,029 PhDs awarded by the Dravidian University over the last two academic years.

While universities like Osmania and Andhra, which have been functioning for decades, registered less than 500 PhDs, the government was shocked that the 10-year-old Dravidian University awarded thousands of PhDs in a single academic year.

The university has been offering PhDs in distance education mode against the norms set the University Grants Commission and the All India Council of Technical Education and also allowed private institutions to set up study centres to offer MPhil and PhD programmes. The recent norms making M.Phils and PhDs mandatory for appointment as professors and principals in colleges have led to huge demand from students to obtain these qualifications.

The government had received specific complaints against the university that the study centres were charging \`50,000 to \`1 lakh for each PhD depending on the subject and its demand. The government has also decided to initiate an inquiry against vice-chancellor Prof C. Ramanaiah for the irregularities.

“The committee has recommended abolition of 8,029 PhDs awarded during 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years,” said Mr Damodara Rajanarasimha, minister for higher and technical education.
