Dear Scholars,

PraNAma!



As some of you might have noticed, the people in our group are repeatedly misspelling the name of our holy languge. Some spell it Sanskrit, some Samskrit and some even Samskrut! This is happening with the language which is now considered a standard language free of regional/social variation. (Though Panini has given some space for regional variation, but for we people these variations are no more regional but just some available options to use them in expressing ourselves). People are nowadays trying to compliance with Panini so that the deviation in the languagemay not occur and we have a pure, uniform, uncorrupt languge for which we are proud of.



So, in such a situation if we deviate even in spelling the name of the language, it would be very ironic and funny thing. Therefore, I request the scholars to make a consensus to spell the name of the language uniformly. This is a serious issue.



With kind regards,

Madhav
