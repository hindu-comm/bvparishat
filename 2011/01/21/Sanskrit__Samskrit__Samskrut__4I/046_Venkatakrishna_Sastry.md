Namaste

  

1\.   This whole exercise of  chasing the question of ' How to Pronounce' placed in the frame of how to 'read properly the ( manu-) scripted text' / How to manu-script the voiced text of Samskrutham - 
is a wild goose chase ! 

  

     The base and basics of ' Samskrutham' are thrown to wind using inappropriate linguistic models , pushed in through different conventions of ' language scripting, publishing and digital ( Language) technology innovators ! ! 

  

    There is a wise saying : When in doubt, go back to basics ! So let us get to the basics of Samskrutham- Scripting of Articulation . 
In Technology terms, this is ' Speech to Text' - 'Text to Speech' challenge. 

  

***Note***: This is not lecturing or exercise to earn a brownie point. This is sharing one plausible approach that may resolve the issue debated in this thread.

     I do understand and respect the wisdom of senior scholars in this forum who may hold a different perspective and alternative explanations.



2\.  The debated question has several perspectives and parts, combined !: The debate is not new ! Patanjali has addressed this in the Bhashya at the outset; and declared that ' Shikshaa' is the Base and Basics of Shuddha Samskrutha Uccharanam; and SHIKSHAA is built by the standards of ' Veda'.

  

   ( What happens when Veda itself is corrupted? Go back to the physiology, Anatomy, Science of Human Body as presented in the Yoga and Ayurveda Shaastra).



Getting back to the cluster of questions debated in this thread, there are four involved issues :

  

संस्कृत में "सम्" ध्वनि आनी चाहिए या "सङ्" या "सन्"? अनुस्वार को कैसे बोलें ? - Focus is on Script to Articulation .

  
"कृ" के प्रति में आश्वस्त हूँ कि यह "ऋ" के अनुसार बोला जायेगा न कि "रि" या "रु" \| Exclusion of Phonetic value linked to a script symbol .A filtering criterion.

  
लिप्यन्तरण में कैसे लिखा जाए, यह प्रश्न बाद का है, परन्तु कैसे उच्चारण किया जाए वह पहले निर्विवादित होना चाहिए \| Scripting and Transcription / Transliteration - Porting of phonetic value across scripts of different alphabet sets using languages.

  
इस समय में मात्र लिखित से अधिक दृश्य और श्रव्य माध्यम भी उपलब्ध हैं यथा youtube, [howtopronounce.com](http://howtopronounce.com) इत्यादि, हमें उनका उपयोग कर कोई मानक उच्चारण नहीं बना देना चाहिए ? रोमन लिपि में कैसे लिखा जायेगा यह मेरे लिए सबसे निम्न वरीयता का प्रश्न है \| - Challenges of Self- Learning Sanskrit / Corrections to available resources using
digital media resources thrown in to cyber space by enthusiastic volunteers desiring ' Glory of Sanskrit'  :: The challenge of ' Samskrutha Shuddha Uccharanam ' ( as Patanjali declared : शुद्धाः पठ्यन्ते  

  

And these can be resolved only when Paniniya Samskrutham is studied
as 'Vedanga, Yoga- Bhashaa, Vak- yoga' using the ' base and basics of Paniniya Shikshaa'. Any other model would be improper pedagogy and inappropriate.  

***  
***

***{ Ground reality hypothesis taken to build the above position  are as follows :***

**( i) Devanagari scripting of current period ( and used in digital devices / computers as Fonts/ Glyphs) is not the ancient original historical script of Samskrutham, which can be pushed back to the time of Panini or earlier to him ! The ' script of that earlier period
could be any thing per wild guess, fancy and strong voice of proposing
scholar, to be called as - Brahmi, Cuneiform, Hieroglyph, PIE Script, IVC seal script, ancient Tamil ….. . **

**  
**

**    Therefore, if the Word form has been derived using Paninian rules, then the base of ' Paninian rules': namely the Maheswara Sutra
Varna -Samaamnaaya' needs to be implicitly accepted for its ' Phonetic Value'. If English does not have the script / phonetic equivalent for the ' Varna - ऋ ', then the scripting of the word ' संस्कृतं / सं स्कृ त म् using characters of Roman alphabet set always causes a confusion.**

**  
**

**(ii)  What we have for current debate is having a focus on specific scripting convention of Indic Brahmi languages - human voice as a ' Devanagari Script standard form '.  The technical traditional name for this is ' lipi-Shaastra' : a forgotten tradition in Indian Linguistics ; and ignored / discredited in other wise academic linguistics ! The available studies have a heavy leaning on the ' western model of Script evolution in Social languages, substantiated as ' manuscript evidence'.!
 The focus of Computational linguists on 'Font rendering on screen' does not address the issue of ' Logic of Language Scripts' Designing : Why a specific shape for the phoneme अ  and how elongated sound is by a side marker आ ? and not a Capital convention letter symbol or ' aa' as two characters ? . The design philosophy of ' Brahmi Devanagari Scripts' is not adapted in scripting conventions .**

**  
**

**(iii)  The ' ( modern) Devanagari Brahmi Scripting convention'
belongs to a specific historic period, not older than some 1500 years from now, a human construct of scripting ( mainly) languages of Bharath. This convention carries an alphabet set - sequence and agglutinating character representation model to script the sounds of Indian languages. This ' Character set, sequence, structure of Devanagari Brahmi/ Naagari' is different from the foreign languages 
like Latin- Greek, Hebrew, Modern English, Aramaic, French, German, Chinese, Japanese's, Thai... and 'Within India language scripts also, like Gujrati, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Tulu and the like.**

**  
**

**    The adoption of common character set does not make strong ground to make phonetic equivalence of scripted form same across languages. This argument, possibly opens a new line of exploration on Samskruth- Prakruth relations as ' Common Shikshaa- Different Grammars' model of language relations.  **

**  
**

**(iv) The Script Symbol- Sound Value association in modern Devanagari Brahmi Scripting uses the ' Character set- sequence' provided by the Shikshaa Shaastras ( and probably some from Praatishaakhyas). The history of 'Shikshaa shastra based Character set -sequence' goes back to Pre-Paninian period; and forms a foundational input to build the rules of  Vedanga- Vyakarana (grammar) .**

**  
**

** Here also, regional languages have a slight variation in the Swaras- Vyanjanas compared to Paninian Shikshaa set. The significance of these variations in base set of 'Swara- Vyanjana'- phonemes is a key issue that needs to be understood and highlighted in Samskruth studies. So also is the issue of ' Accent marking on Swaras'- a convention which historically goes back way before the IPA diacritic conventions ! and Arabic scripting conventions ; and European language scripts differences .**

**  
**

These **prime issue are addressed in the Vedanga Vyakarana Texts as : How does the speaker make a ' Word' ( Technically ' Pada' - which is carved out from ' given base Prakruti' by addition of ' prataya' ( meaning modifiers) using a set of processing rules ( - Prakriyaa) and make it a part of 'Communicative Sentence (= Vaakya) , which is ARTICULATED ( = उच्चारित ) . This is what Patanjali brings up right upfront in the discussion : ' That is a 'Shabda' - by articulation of which the ' communicative meaning is conveyed ( - येन उच्चारितेन संप्रत्ययो भवति स शब्दः ) This is also the reason to carefully understand the opening question of Vedanga Vyakarana reading ' अथ शब्दानुशासनम् and NOT as ' पदानुशासनम् or वाक्यानुशासनम् ').**

**  
**

**The tradition of 'Vedanga Vyakarana' has kept its unmodified singular focus on ' SHUDDHA UCCHARANA' ; and has not diluted itself to the debate of 'How to Script a sound'. The decoding of scripted text was the exclusive domain and skill of the Masters of Language Traditions ( Achaarya ). The scripting conventions of Veda- Shaastra related were held by Shaastra -Guru- Kuls; The scripting conventions of state administration were regulated by the State education ( Raja - Guru - Kulas / Vanik- Vyavahara - Guru Kulas). **

**  
**

**Shikshaa Shaastra provides the ' Voice - Pronunciation basics of Vedanga Vyakarana; and delegates the 'scripting convention to another discipline called ' LIPI -Shaastra'. LIPI-Shaastra has different conventions in domain specific applications - as ' Bhoota- Akshara lipi ( for Tantras), Bhashaa Lipi for Administration ( Artha Shaastra Vyavahara), Encrypted Scripting for Secure transmission of messages ( Guhya / Goodha lipi), Popular language scripts by regions ( desha bhashaa lipi).**

**  
**

**In other words, The scripted form and convention is RIGHT for SAMSKRUTHAM if it yields the ' Shuddha - uccharana of Pada /Shabda'. If not, it is NOT ! It does not matter who promoted the convention - Be it Harvard Kyoto, or ISCII or IPA diacritics. **

**  
**

***The corollaries of this are* :**

**  
**

**Samskrutha Shabda can not be scripted properly using ' arbitrary spelling model conventions of users choice scripting language'. Any effort to do this will always lead to a cleavage between the ' Scripted Text and Articulated Sound'. **

**  
**

Samskrutham can not be taught- learnt as ' Shuddha - Bhashaa' just based on scripted book model resources, device centric voice repeaters in applications which carry regional language flavors ;  Learning Samskrutham as ' Classical Language: meaning NOT SPOKEN/ NOT ARTICUALTED is an Oxymoron that damages the 'Paninian Tradition' and along with it pulls down the ' Vedic Education- application- utilities'. An error of modeling the pedagogy of Samskrutham in the last three hundred years can not be allowed to kill the Paninian pedagogy of Samskrutham with a grater historicity and practical utility.

  

I stand open for correction on the above points, by the learned scholars.

retrieving the

  

\<regional variation in the pronunciation of r̥ is very old and the evidence comes from many sources including Prakrits/Pali. The Pāli words miga \[Skt. mr̥ga\], tiṇa \[Skt. tr̥na\], kicca \[Skt. kr̥tya\] indicate the "(r)i" pronunciation, but the same language has kata \[Skt. kr̥ta\], mata \[Skt. mr̥ta\] indicating the "a(r) or (r)a". The vernacular variations of Kr̥ṣṇa as kaṇṇa, kānhā, kisnā, kisan etc, indicate a similar variation. The English spelling "Sanskrit" is probably based on what the British heard in north India.
