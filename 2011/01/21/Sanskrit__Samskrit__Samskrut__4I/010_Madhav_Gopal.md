I thank all the participants in this discussion. It appears that the word Sanskrit to signify the Sanskrit language is a better option. The Roman script is not perfect for even writing English, so we should not expect it to be suitable for other languages like, say, Sanskrit. Somewhere we have to compromise and the correct pronunciation will only be known when an 'aptapurusha/aptamahila' will pronounce that word as we do in English also. So, as the Roman script is not reliable from pronunciation perspective, only convention has to be respected, and this would come only when we here an 'aptapurusha/aptamahila' uttering a particular word.  
  
There are many words in English also which cannot be represented correctly through the script. A script like Roman is just to give some clue about the pronunciaiotn, and thats why IPA was invented to teach English in non English speaking countries. This orthographic disorder may be due to some historical reasons, which can be investigated separately. But the thing that is important and appreciable in the case of English is its stable, standard, widely accepted and practiced writing convention, which, unfortunately, we Indians do not have for our languages.  
  
So, it is true that संस्कृत cannot be written correctly in Roman script without diacritics but we have to just have a powerful convention to encode it in Roman (without diacritics, as they are great barriers for writing fastly) and it is, as many of you have said, **Sanskrit** (after considering many factors).  
  
Anyway, I do not claim it to be immune from criticism. Let us see what other scholars, especially from South India, in the group say about this solution.  
  
Jayatu Sanskritam!
