Dear Scholars,

I never said that 'ri' is the exact transliteration of ऋ. I only meant  
it would be close to ऋ, please kindly read my mail again. Its  
transliteration and pronounciation as 'ru' is very unnatural in North  
India. I guess, you will not find a single North Indian scholar  
spelling it as 'ru' while we have many southern scholars spelling it  
as 'ri'. We all know that ऋ is symbolized as ṛ as Prof. Deepak  
Bhattacharya says, but this symbol is out of Roman script, so we are  
proposing some close representation in the script which we find 'ri'.  
In Roman script when we write 'ri' for ऋ, it does not necessarily  
require that one has to pronounce it as रि. I hope things are clear  
now.

regards,  
madhav
