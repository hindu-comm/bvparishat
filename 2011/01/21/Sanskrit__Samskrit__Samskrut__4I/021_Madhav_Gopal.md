Actually, in Indian context where by Roman script we mean 26 letters from A to Z, ṛ is out of these letters, so could be thought of as non-Roman loosely speaking. Also, our keyboardsdo not facilitate its printingeasily.So, we need 'ri' which is within Roman as it does not have any external symbols. In fact, sir you have understood me again wrongly.
