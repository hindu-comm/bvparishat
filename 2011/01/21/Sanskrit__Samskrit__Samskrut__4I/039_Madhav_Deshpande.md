Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

  The regional variation in the pronunciation of r̥ is very old and the evidence comes from many sources including Prakrits/Pali. The Pāli words miga \[Skt. mr̥ga\], tiṇa \[Skt. tr̥na\], kicca \[Skt. kr̥tya\] indicate the "(r)i" pronunciation, but the same language has kata \[Skt. kr̥ta\], mata \[Skt. mr̥ta\] indicating the "a(r) or (r)a". The vernacular variations of Kr̥ṣṇa as kaṇṇa, kānhā, kisnā, kisan etc, indicate a similar variation. The English spelling "Sanskrit" is probably based on what the British heard in north India.
