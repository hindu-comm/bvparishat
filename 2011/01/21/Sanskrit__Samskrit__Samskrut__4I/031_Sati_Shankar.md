AdarNiya visvadjana,

Found interesting information here in this thread, Thanks to you all for all the arguments.

Please allow me to put my observation, though related but in wider sense.

The point is ,

When we go through all the indological literature right from 18th century, we find, quotes from Greek, Latin, Arabic, etc etc in their original scripts for sake of originality and ,barring a few, ,while writing Sanskrit quotes they adopt roman, diacritical etc...not devnAgari. Why is it so.... to make devnAgari extinct? For us at least, use of devnAgari should be preferred while quoting, then, in a way, the problem of this thread itself will be solved.

Just an observation.

Regards

Yours

Sati Shankar
