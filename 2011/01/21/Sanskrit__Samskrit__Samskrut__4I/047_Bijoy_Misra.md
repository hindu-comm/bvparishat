Dear Dr. BVK and friends,

I would think that we avoid using phonetic transliteration as much as possible

such that the words read as we might speak. Hence I suggest replacing "kru"

with "kR" and do reevision wherever we can. Our goal must be not that the

reader may read but to drive the point that the sound is important.
Hopefully

individual efforts locally would catch up to help clear the articulation.

Thank you.
