Namaskaara to all.  
  
I was away from discussion for long. This discussion thread on the word "sanskrit" is very interesting one. I had this problem when i came to the Sanskrit Academy three years back. I dont recall all points that were discussed in those days, however, i remember that we had resolved to set a proper standard for such usages instead of following the bad tradition.  
  
The modern usage of "sanskrit" does injustice to the spelling of saMkqta. Both M' anusvAra as well as q kaara are wrongly spelt. Hence, it is better to set a new proper standard as per our standard transliterations. Though it is highly impossible to write the word exactly as it is written in any of the standard transliteration schemes, it is better to write it as close as possible to the same. Let us start writing Samskrta, which may become standard after some years of use and this will be accepted by one and all.  
  
In this age of Internet it is very easy to set the new standards. What do you say?  
  
jayatu Samskrtam.  
  
regards,  
shrivara
