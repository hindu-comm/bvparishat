I think the question is valid and needs consideration by the group. अनुस्वार is the substitute for the म् sound. Thus, रामं is pronounced as रामम्. But in संस्कृत the अनुस्वार is pronounced as न् and not as म्. This is because the म् gets assimilated to न् under the influence of the स् that follows. So, the question by our friend is: once म् has changed to न् will it not be more appropriate to write संस्कृत as सन्स्कृत?  
  

I think he has a point.
