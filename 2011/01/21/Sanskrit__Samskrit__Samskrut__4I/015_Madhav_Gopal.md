Namaste to all!



Actually sir if we want to have "Samskrta" then we should have "Samskrita" instead, as only 'r' will not be able to represent the ऋ. Thus it would be close to the same. The respected scholarsdo not seem to be interested in this matter. So, now what you and I can do for the new standard?
