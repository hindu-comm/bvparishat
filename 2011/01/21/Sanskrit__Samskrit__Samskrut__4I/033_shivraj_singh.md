Saul Levin (<https://www.binghamton.edu/cnes/people/emeriti/saul.html>) in his books routinely used devnagari to write sanskrit. It was so refreshing to read his books because one did not have to keep ITRANS/Harvard Kyoto etc. around.

  

Is this a sign of cultural imperialism whereby a group who cannot read sanskrit/indic languages natively, decided to come up with a phonetic alphabet and made all "brown people" learn it?

  

What is the status of academic journals? Would they not accept papers if sanskrit quotes are in devnagari and not IPA etc.?

  

Also does some vidwan know / or can we create a list which shows what sounds from other Indo European languages \*cannot\* be pronounced using devnagari alphabets?
