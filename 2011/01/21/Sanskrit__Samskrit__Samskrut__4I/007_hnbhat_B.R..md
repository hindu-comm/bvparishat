In fact it is half way between samskrutam and sanskrit. samskrit, samskrita, sanskruta, etc. are all corrupt forms in between in zeal to reinstate sanskritised forms (influenced by the softwares encoding systems used for getting devanagari fonts) for the anglicized form.

  

Sanskrit is accepted throughout English writings by western scholars and available as such in English dictionaries too as some scholar pointed out. There is no obvious reason to revert back from it to again sanskritize the same back to Indian English.

  

And diacritics in roman alphabets are not available in all the softwares used for devanagari. But if one wants, it is already available, in AerialUnicodeMS fonts in the windows which can be conveniently created for typing by creating keyboard shortcuts. Itrans software too has got the facility, but it cannot be used directly as Baraha software in messages or on any web page.
