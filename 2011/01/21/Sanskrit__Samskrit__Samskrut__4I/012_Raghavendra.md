This is just a thought  
  
Anglo-saxon provides great felicity writing Sanskrit than devanaagari,  
  
For example  
  
धर्म is simply written as \*dharma\* the way it is pronounced but not in the case of former. The रेफ़ is written after writing म.  
  
Complex words and constructions of Sanskrit can thus be written easily and with great felicity.  
  
thanks

\>I thank all the participants in this discussion. It appears that the word Sanskrit to signify the Sanskrit language is a better option. The Roman script is not perfect for even writing English, so we should not expect it to be suitable for other languages like, say, Sanskrit. Somewhere we have to compromise and the correct pronunciation will only be known when an 'aptapurusha/aptamahila' will pronounce that word as we do in English also. So, as the Roman script is not reliable from pronunciation perspective, only convention has to be respected, and this would come only when we here an 'aptapurusha/aptamahila' uttering a particular word.  
  
  
There are many words in English also which cannot be represented correctly through the script. A script like Roman is just to give some clue about the pronunciaiotn, and thats why IPA was invented to teach English in non English speaking countries. This orthographic disorder may be due to some historical reasons, which can be investigated separately. But the thing that is important and appreciable in the case of English is its stable, standard, widely accepted and practiced writing convention, which, unfortunately, we Indians do not have for our languages.  
  
  
So, it is true that संस्कृत cannot be written correctly in Roman script without diacritics but we have to just have a powerful convention to encode it in Roman (without diacritics, as they are great barriers for writing fastly) and it is, as many of you have said, Sanskrit (after considering many factors).  
  
  
Anyway, I do not claim it to be immune from criticism. Let us see what other scholars, especially from South India, in the group say about this solution.  
  
Jayatu Sanskritam!

Dear Colleagues,  
No problem rises with the word Sanskrit meaning संस्कृत in day to day transactions like, say, news paper reporst. We have been used to untoward spellings also in marriage invitation cards. But this forum is for specialists. The diacritical marks had been developed for specialists and new learners. So, for them ie also for fora like the BVPa special romanised or otherwise written international character system is necessary. Some Western scholars -- very few in number but they do exist --write Greek words in romanised forms. That means they have given up the Greek characters. That is possible for Sanskrit too. In any case, whatever it be. an international system of Sanskrit
writing/transliteration consistent and unicodised is essential. Barring the vocalic r and l the current diacritics more or less serve the purpose for Sanskrit. But it is insufficient for Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, Oriya etc..  
  
Best wishes for all.
