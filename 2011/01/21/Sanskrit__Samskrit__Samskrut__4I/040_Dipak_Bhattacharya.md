Dear Colleagues,

It may sound heretical but the pronunciation of the vocalic r̥ as in *mr̥ga* occurs outside Sanskrit. The final -r in *Sartre*_(,) for example. is uttered as a vocalic r.Phonetic concepts still somewhat lag behind in Europe; at least behind good Pāṇinians. Kuiper uttered the final re of sartre as re while it should be like the Vedic ṛ.

Sorry for the lecture
