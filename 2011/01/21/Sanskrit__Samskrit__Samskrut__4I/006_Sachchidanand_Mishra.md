Dear Scholars,  

Seeing all these responses we can see very clearly that if one is willing to write Sanskrit in English he/she is led with his own grammatical practices. I would suggest to use **Sanskrit** without any diacritical marks for it is more acceptable. In the list of languages, in the regeonal and Language options of Windows and many version of Linux, in all English Dictionaries the same spelling is accepted. Even if one searches**Samskrit**at Google it gives result ***"Showing results for Sanskrit. Search instead for Samskrit".***Therefore, using the word Sanskrit is more acceptable.
