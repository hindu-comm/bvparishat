We generally pronounce ऋ as रि, but as रे when reciting Veda (Shukla Yajurveda Madhyandina Samhita), and if someone pronounces ऋ as रु we regard them to be influenced by the accent of western or southern India (not sure) .

  

I think all three pronunciations to be equally valid, having forgotten how our ancestors vocalised the letter.
