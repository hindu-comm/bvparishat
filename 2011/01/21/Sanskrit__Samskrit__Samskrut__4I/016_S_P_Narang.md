Regards, R. has gone to a number of vowels and consonants which are in Sanskrit and Modern Indian Languages or has taken a different shape. It is evident from the Paninian sutra itself: uraNaraparah. Infact, it was an independent sound like Lr. ( which took a different shape in MIL and also disappeared or difficult to pronounce). Details: Wackernagel, Macdonell, Renou. So its pronunciation like ri or ru is only regional variant and cannot be universalized. Its gun.a and Vr.ddhi had further nazalised forms which are not noted bySanskrit grammarians but are preserved in the dialects like Multani, Jhangi, Peshawari (expected from Pahini) e.g. karendaa, karaindaa>kr.>kar. Panini did not touch thembecause he was concerned with Sanskrit only. The variants can be further found slowly in the lost Samhitaas which are not noted by Bloomfield. For acceptance of R. we should accept both ri and ru and its variants. Our persian teacher spoke: samskirit which is a Persanized version of Sanskrit because he was not able to speak R. We can accept only one form and respect it like : we the people of Sanskrit. spnarang
