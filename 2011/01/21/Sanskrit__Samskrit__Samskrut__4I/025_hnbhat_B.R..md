Interestingly in प्राकृतप्रकाश (व्याकरण of प्राकृत), which lists the rules for संस्कृत to प्राकृत, there are 4-5 sutras for ऋ.

आदेः \[अतः\]। (आदेरेत्याध्यायपरिसमाप्तेरधिकारः)

ऋतो ऽत् ।१.२०।

इदृष्यादौ।१.२१॥

उदृत्वादौ।१.२२॥

अयुक्तस्य रिः॥१.२३॥

क्वचिद् युक्तस्यापि॥१.२४॥ तारिसो तादृशः।

  

This is the sequence of replacement of vowel ऋ in Prakrit. The general rule is that ऋ in the initial postion of the words except those included in the exceptional list of ऋष्यादि and ऋष्यादि have got the ऋ in the initial position only. In other cases, than those included, this vowel will be replaced by रि when it is not appended to other consonant. Only exceptional cases are just listed like तादृशः - तारिसो। And exceptionally वृक्ष becomes रुक्खो.

  

And it is not अनादेः as noted by Prof. Kulakarni.

  

This is just for information about the phonetic change of the vowel in question in Prakrit. But nothing to do with the debate on how to represent the word "Sanskrit" or the pronunciation of the vowel nor justifying any of the orthographic representation.
