नमस्ते

  

Irrespective of what you writeSanskrit/ Samskrit/ Samskrutit is critically important what do you speak when you read. Do you read संस्कृतम् or some other word. If one do not read/speak this word asसंस्कृतम् than is it highest corruption. Anywayसंस्कृतम्is a phonetic language and many scripts of the world has tried to document this language but I tell you roman script cannot do justice for the phonetics of this languages. No matter how hard you try. Best it can be written in any Indian script like Kannada, Telgu, Malyalam, Banglaand Devnagari. Therefore, if you want to write it properly use these languages because these languages provides the framework to catch every sound ofसंस्कृतम्.Sanskrit/Samskrit/Samskrutare search engine friendly words for non-indian people who cannot speak/write any of the Indian languague.

  

Warm Regards

Hari
