dear madhav,

you think thatऋ has to be pronounced as RI because in some parts of India it is pronounced in that way. but you should note theऋ is pronounced asRUin other parts. once i was discussing this problem with a renowned scholar in Delhi, he said actuallyऋ has to be pronouncedneitheras 'RU' nor as 'RI'. it has to be pronounced as R as a pureconsonant, without the addition of any vowel.hence it seems 'Samskrta' is better, instead of Sanskrita.
