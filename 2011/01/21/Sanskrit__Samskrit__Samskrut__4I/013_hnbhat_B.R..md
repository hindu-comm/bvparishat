As usual, the question/suggestion to write "Sanskrit" with correct spelling (to denoted the language denoted by that name in English usage of the word) asked casually but seriously has received from different ends different considerations.

  

First , the use of the spelling for writing the word "Sanskrit" in english language to denote the language as per the English dictionaries seems to be acceptable from the use of the word in any context of discussion in the English language and there is no possibliity (generally) to use the word "Sanskrit" in writing using Sanskrit Language (using Devanagari alphabet) unless the writer volitionally intends to do so. The word "Sanskrit" is an accepted English word form to denote the Sanskrit Language. Hope this is clear that in the above the word "Sanskrit" is not the same as the word "संस्कृतम्" which is a perfectly inflected Sanskrit word with different meanings than denoting the language (which can be used to denote the language too). And this word can be given wide range of usage in Sanskrit and definitions and etymologies within the scope of the word and the discussion has gone round about from English usage of IPA/ Anglosaxon history of alphabets to Vedic period of usage of Sanskrit language among the learned members of OUR forum.

  

The use of diacritical marks using IPA is fine option to safeguard against misinterpretations in writing the words/sentences Sanskrit language if one wants to use roman alphabet. (so that "mala" = माला, मल, मला, माल the confusion may be avoided in the sentences/words) embedded/quotations inside an article in English and on the other hand, the message/article can be written using Devanagari (देवनागरी/देव-नगरी) fonts even within English/Sanskrit message. Using "baraha" software as in this to clearly mark the word may be helpful too. This is the other option for using IPA diacritical marks which is not easily accessible for writing in messages here for everybody. Whenever possible, diacritical marks may be used to avoid confusion between the actual word intended. (I have not tried using key-board shortcuts to ArialunicodeMS fonts (symbols) in messages online, but was useful in creating word documents with Sanskrit words. I-translator has the transliteration system too, but it cannot be used to type on web page directly unlike Baraha software (which doesn't have transliteration IPA like Itranslator). It would have been better if such transliteration device was included inside BarahaDirect itself.

  

Hope this sums up the discussion from different angles as it has been discussed so far.

  

Thanks to Mr. Madhavji for raising the question and all others who contributed to the discussion on the issue.
