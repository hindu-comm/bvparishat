The argument of सकर्तृकत्व is based on the concept of ईश्वर by the twin schools नैयायिक (rejuvenate with its twin) and वैशेषिक-s.

  

यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्वं यो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति तस्मै ।

तं ह देवं आत्मबुद्धिप्रकाशं मुमुक्षुर्वै शरणमहं प्रपद्ये ॥१८॥  
  
yo brahmanam vidadhati purvam  
yo vai vedamscha prahinoti tasmai ।  
tam ha devam atmabuddhiprakasam  
mumuksurvai saranamaham prapadye ॥ 18॥  
  

while मीमांसक- school holds they eternal (neither human made nor divine origin) (accordingly the definition of नास्तिक differs). Both tended to guard it against the objections based on the possibility of errors (in accepting them as human made). This is what I grasped from the primary texts of Nyaya. नैयायिक-s hold that every कल्प they are created as above as in the श्वेतश्वतर verse. There clearly it differentiates the use of ब्रह्म and वेद (all the four, and not the त्रयी). The नैयायिक view in general in respect of the names of ऋषि-s associated with them that they were revealed to these ऋषि-s in each कल्प and मन्वन्तर. "स्मर्तारो न तु कर्तारः" in general.

  

The errors in human creation of Veda-s are listed out in Nirukta too and the related statement in Nirukta was also subjected to disputes from both sides in another topic.

  

This one with fresh fervor and vigor as I can notice revived by Mr. Prathosh discussed from different angles. I am just watching the developments as I do not have deep access to the original texts of the commentaries.
