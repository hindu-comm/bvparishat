It is not much of a problem if one remembers or looks up the statements and arguments correctly.

The question itself is quite ill-founded, à la अबद्धं पठित्वा कुचोद्यं करोति. The definition of वेदत्व is अकर्तृकत्वप्रसिद्धिमद्वाक्यत्वं वेदत्वं, not as you seem to remember, and nowhere does the टीका claim that a गूढकर्तृकवाक्य is itself automatically taken as अनृत; such a claim is quite unnecessary to make. The exact discussion of गूढकर्तृक compositions, under the मूल statement न च केनचित्कृत्वा वेद इत्युक्तं वेदसमम् -- परम्पराऽभावात् is as follows (pp. 140--141 in the 1969 edition):  
  
अकर्तृकत्वप्रसिद्धिमद्वाक्यत्वं वेदत्वमिति यद्वेदलक्षणमुक्तं तदयुक्तम् । गूढकर्तृकस्य कृताकर्तृकत्वप्रसिद्धिकस्यापि वाक्यस्य वेदत्वप्रसङ्गात् । अन्यथाऽतिव्यापकत्वादित्याह -- न च केनचिदिति । वेद इत्युक्तं कृताकर्तृकत्वप्रसिद्धिकं वाक्यं वेदसमं प्रसिद्धवेदवद्वेदत्वोपेतं प्रसज्यत, इति शेषः । हेतुमाह -- परम्परेति । अकर्तृकत्वप्रसिद्धिमत्त्वं नाम अनुपलभ्यमानप्रत्यक्षादिमूलत्वमित्युक्तम् । अस्य चाध्येतृपरम्पराऽभावेन यस्मिन्विच्छेदस्तदीयप्रत्यक्षादिमूलत्वमनुमानेनोपलभ्यत एव । विमतं वाक्यं एतत्प्रत्यक्षादिमूलं अस्मिन्विच्छिन्नपरम्परत्वात् । यद्यस्मिन्विच्छिन्नपरम्परं वाक्यं तत्तत्प्रत्यक्षादिमूलं यथा सम्प्रतिपन्नमिति । अतो नोक्तं वेदलक्षणं गूढकर्तृकेऽस्तीति ।  
  
Later on (p. 142), in connection with subsequent मूल statements, the टीका takes up the question that a गूढकर्ता's compositions lacking a परम्परा, which has been taken as a हेतु, can itself be unproven, which is where the problem (for you) occurs: नन्वेवं तर्हि गूढकर्तृके परम्पराऽभावस्य हेतोरसिद्धिस्स्यात् । वसिष्ठादय इव गुढोऽपि कर्ता प्राक्सिद्धमेवेदं मया दृष्टमिति वदत्येवेति चेन्न -- तद्वचनस्यानृतत्वात् ।  
  
Therefore, the point here is this: the पूर्वपक्षी objects that a गूढकर्ता also falsely claims that his secret composition existed earlier, and was "seen" by him (as the famous Vedas were by sages such as वसिष्ठ, etc.). Thus the हेतु used previously, that a गूढकर्ता's compositions lack a परम्परा, is vitiated. To this, the टीका gives the सिद्धान्त response that the objection itself is invalid, because the पूर्वपक्षी admits as a premise that the गूढकर्ता is stating a falsehood, that his own composition in fact existed earlier. Therefore, such a falsehood cannot in turn be a हेतु for the पूर्वपक्ष objection (which itself is of the form of an अनुमान, and thus must play by the same rules).  
  
Thus, the टीका does not go into the ontological status of the actual गूढकर्तृकवाक्य itself, which it does not need to do. However, when the पूर्वपक्षी offers a rejoinder by claiming that the हेतु of परम्परा अभाव given is असिद्ध and cannot be used, then the टीका replies that in turn the हेतु used by the पूर्वपक्षी in making this claim is admitted by him to be false (and therefore cannot sustain his claim), thus vitiating the objection itself and affirming the original सिद्धान्त inference न च केनचित्कृत्वा वेद इत्युक्तं वेदसमं परम्पराऽभावात्.
