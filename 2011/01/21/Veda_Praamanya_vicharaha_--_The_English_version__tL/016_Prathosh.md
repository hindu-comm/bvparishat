Shri Dr.HN Bhat,

Of course this debate needs such an amount of vigor. Because, without  
Apourusheyatva, there is no Praamanya of Vedas, without Praamaanya of  
Vedas, there is no GOD. So, all of us (Vaidikas) should first and  
foremost struggle to establish this concept logically.

\>\>The argument of सकर्तृकत्व is based on the concept of ईश्वर by the twin  
schools नैयायिक (rejuvenate with its twin) and वैशेषिक-s.

यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्वं यो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति तस्मै ।

Correct, but नैयायिक argument is " Anyonyashraya grasta". Vedas are  
flawless because they are God's words and God is there because Vedas  
say so!! SO, without God, there is no inerrancy of Veda and without  
that there is no God!

But one can say that नैयायिकs use "Sakartrukatvaanumana" to prove God  
but all Vedanta schools have thoroughly refuted it. We can open a new  
thread to discuss that as well. So, its our responsibility to  
establish the ierrancy of Vedas before we discuss any inner issues of  
Shruti or Smritis. In my opinion, the vigor this post has is still not  
enough! It needs even more strong discussions. Don't you think so?
