Dear Shrisha Rao,

This is what happens when English is used to express Vedanta views. My  
question seemed कुचोद्य to you. I didnt mean that gudhakartruka vakya  
itself is anruta. As you said, its of no consequence. Let me clarify  
my doubts.

I completely agree with your arguments. But look here carefully.

विमतं वाक्यं एतत्प्रत्यक्षादिमूलं अस्मिन्विच्छिन्नपरम्परत्वात्\| This  
is the anumana used to take off the ativyapti of veda lakshana in  
Gudakartruka vakya. Isn't it? Two questions I ask here,

1\) vichhinaparamparaatvam assiddham tatra manaabhavaat. What pramana  
exists in Vichhinnaparamparaatva of a vakya?

2\) वसिष्ठादय इव गुढोऽपि कर्ता प्राक्सिद्धमेवेदं मया दृष्टमिति  
वदत्येवेति चेन्न -- तद्वचनस्यानृतत्वात् । --- When you dont know the  
aapti of Gudhakarta, how can you say that he says anruta?

Another thing is -- किंच मधुछंदादीनां विप्रलंभकत्वं किं न स्यात् ? ते  
एव वॆदानां कर्तारः  
किं न स्यु: ? How do you answer this? How can you say there is no  
Vichhinnaparamparaatva there?

\>\> To this, the टीका gives the सिद्धान्त response that the objection itself is invalid, because the पूर्वपक्षी admits as a premise that the गूढकर्ता is stating a falsehood, that his own composition in fact existed earlier.

What if it is not admitted that the person referred to as गूढकर्ता is  
stating a falsehood? How is then hetu becomes swarupasiddha?

Let me make one point clear to you, I am not here with the intention  
of refuting Tika, I have highest regards for it. But I want to  
understand it more clearly. You might know that there are people now  
who claims that they are "seers" of Veda. You may say that even that  
has been discussed in Mula quoting a Smriti vakya - "  
Vimshallakhana..." but how do you establish its praamanya before  
establishing veda pramaanya? My concern is to just understand things  
better.
