hariH OM,  
shri senani,

  
  
*"yAh being interpreted as stotrANi is quite proper in thecontext of the hymn.The Hymn praisesIndra for his various brave deeds like slaying of Vritrasura and in thethirteenth rik says that Indra would do newer brave acts - "*

 In that case, using adhyAhAra, it will be read as "navyAni stotrANi bravAma"... an uncommon usage. the general usage in veda is stotram / stotrANi - gAyAma / gAyata. Moreover the following was written in my earlier mail to shri moharir:

  

1.  I don't know if the equation "stotra = veda mantra" holds good.
    Because veda mantra has been addressed as "gAvaH" (te.amanvata
    prathamannAma gonAM), vANIH (indraM vANIranUShata), bR^ihat, arkAH 2.  stotra is also a technical word in yaj\~na (as far as i remember,
    there is a shastra and a stotra before an Ahuti, shastra being
    R^iks, stotra being sAmans.  

*"here are more specific references to various seers as 'makers' of the hymns."*  

I wish to hear from you about specific references.

  
  
*"The structure of the rik, to the extent one may generalise is: "God, you are great for you did this and this;so I give you havis/soma and sing your praises; therefore,please bestow wealthupon me"; in so many instances it is clear even to the beginner that singer of those praises has composed it."  
*

Let us not have hand-waving arguments. If it is "clear even to the beginner", then let the "beginners" decide. If one takes your definition of R^ik, we will have to let go of the "cream" of the veda which never talks in the above tone.

  
  
"Visvamitra is referred to as 'kAro'in the Nadisuktam (III.33)."  

sAyaNa bhAShya clearly says "kAro = shastrANAM kartaH". Hence he is not someone who "made" mantra, he made (pronounced) "shastras" (not shAstra, shastra). Also note the sentence before kAro: "उत्तरा युगानि उत्तरेषु याज्ञ्निकेषु यगेषु अहःसु उक्थेषु कारः शस्त्राणां कर्तः". Clear cut reference to the prAtaH savana in a yaj\~na.

  
  
"In the ninthrik in that hymn, Visvamitra addressing the two rivers Vipasa and Sutudri says:



O shu svasArah kArave SriNota, yayau vo dUrAdanasA rathena \|

ni shu namadhvam bhavatA supArA, adho akshAh sindhavah srotyAbhih \|\| 9 \|\|



(O sisters, listen to the words of mine, a stotrakartA (kArave). I have come from afar by chariot and bywagon. Bow low and be easy to cross with your waters below the wheels)"  
  

 stotra kartA:  
1. A person who "praised" the rivers with the shastra (as said above and probably a stotra) of the preceding R^iks.  
2. In every yaj\~na there is a person who is "praShTotA" (prakarSheNa stauti iti), can we call all such priests as having "written" or "made" the hymn? vishvAmitra was a vehicle of delivery of the mantra. The first vehicle nonetheless.  
  

"The issue is not so much internal references but the way to interpret these. Many times, I get the same feeling thatDr. Yadhu Moharir gets -along the lines of "Ah! but I clearly see the poet here!"but I know that till Istudy MimAmsA completely, I should not come to a judgement aboutit, for MimAmsA is the science of interpreting Vedas."  

 Bhagavaan is the greatest poet in us all... Hence it is not surprising to see kavitva in anyone's talk (some more, some less).

  
  
"Till I know better, I will believewhat my father and his fathers believed: that Vedas are apaurusheya. "  

 Agreed.

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
