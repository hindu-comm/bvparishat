hariH OM,  
Shri Moharir,  
  
 I am sorry if any parts of my mails gave you an impression of me "denouncing" sAyaNAchArya. "Denouncing" is a very strong word.  
  
 My sAmaveda AchArya keeps saying that sAyaNa is like "andhon ki lakDi", i.e. the blind man's stick. It was among the first to give us the direction in understanding veda. Why would I "denounce" it when I have been quoting it!!!  
  
 The above said, one cannot also deny that we shouldn't stop at sAyaNa or even yAska. We should try and understand what veda actually means.

  
  
svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

shrivathsa.
