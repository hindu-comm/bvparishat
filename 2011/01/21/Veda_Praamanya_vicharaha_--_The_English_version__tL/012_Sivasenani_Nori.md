namo vidvadbhyah



yAh being interpreted as stotrANi is quite proper in thecontext of the hymn.The Hymn praisesIndra for his various brave deeds like slaying of Vritrasura and in thethirteenth rik says that Indra would do newer brave acts -



kathO nu te pari carANi vidvAnvIryA maghavanyA cakartha \|

yA co nu navyA kriNavah SavishTha predu tA te vidatheshu bravAma \|\| 13 \|\|



"Since Indra is going to perform new brave deeds, we are going to make new stotras to praise those new brave deeds" is the sense captured in the fifteenth rik.



So, I submit that no liberties have been taken by Sayanacharya. Similarly the interpretations of both brahma and sukrita are quite proper.



There are more specific references to various seers as 'makers' of the hymns. The structure of the rik, to the extent one may generalise is: "God, you are great for you did this and this;so I give you havis/soma and sing your praises; therefore,please bestow wealthupon me"; in so many instances it is clear even to the beginner that singer of those praises has composed it. For instance, Visvamitra is referred to as 'kAro'in the Nadisuktam (III.33). In the ninthrik in that hymn, Visvamitra addressing the two rivers Vipasa and Sutudri says:



O shu svasArah kArave SriNota, yayau vo dUrAdanasA rathena \|

ni shu namadhvam bhavatA supArA, adho akshAh sindhavah srotyAbhih \|\| 9 \|\|



(O sisters, listen to the words of mine, a stotrakartA (kArave). I have come from afar by chariot and bywagon. Bow low and be easy to cross with your waters below the wheels)



And the rivers reply in the next rik:



A te kAro SriNavAma vacAmsi, yaYAtha dUrAdanaSa rathena \|

ni te namsai pIpyAneva yoshA, maryAyeva kanyA SaSvacai te \|\| 10 \|\|



(O stotrakartA (kAro), we listen to your words, you who have come from afar by chariot and wagon. Like a mother feeding her son, like a maiden desirous of embracing her man, we shall bend.)

  
The issue is not so much internal references but the way to interpret these. Many times, I get the same feeling thatDr. Yadhu Moharir gets -along the lines of "Ah! but I clearly see the poet here!"but I know that till Istudy MimAmsA completely, I should not come to a judgement aboutit, for MimAmsA is the science of interpreting Vedas. We can know the 'thousands of years of thought' regarding the apaurusheyatva (by the way, there is no South Indian bias in writing 'ru' here- ri is not admissible) only if westudy the various texts of MimAmsA.



Till I know better, I will believewhat my father and his fathers believed: that Vedas are apaurusheya.
