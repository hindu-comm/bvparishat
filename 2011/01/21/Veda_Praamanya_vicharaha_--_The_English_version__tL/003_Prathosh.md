Dear Shrisha Rao,  
  
Thanks for your reply. You have come to the point exactly.I am  
studying Vedanta under PS Sheshagiri Acharya, ( The first disciple of  
HH Vishvesha Thirtha and a classmate of D. Prahlad Acharaya). I have  
studied Tatvanirnaya 7 years ago with 6 commentaries in detail from  
him. I know each and every step Shri Madhwacharya and Shri Jayathirtha  
has taken to establish Apourusheyatva. But I have an unresolved  
question in that Tika itself. Even my teacher and most of us( Scholars  
of Madhwa community ) face that problem.  
  
The problem is as follows---  
  
While defining the vedatva, which is -- Avichhinna Paramparatva, he  
questions the presence of that in "gudha kartruka vakya" also. And the  
answer given is -- " Tadvakyasya anrutatvaat" . ( Refer VTN Tika ). My  
question is what is the pramana in the vakya of gudha karta being  
anrtua? There is another problem. Lets discuss one after the other.
