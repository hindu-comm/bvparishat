Vidvadbhyo namah.  

Sri Shrivathsa,



I have taken the context of the sUkta being commentated upon and submit that, that ought to remain the context and not the context of differentiation of a Veda mantra from a stotra. My intention is to show thatsAyaNAchArya has not taken liberties in this instance. Iunderstood the word 'stotra' in the non-technical sense, i.e. as notopposed to Sastra, in asmuch as the very word rik is explained as 'ricyate stUyate iti rik'.



The largercontext is the paurusheyatva or otherwise of Vedas. Then,even if we take Viswamitra as a kartA ofSastras (and not a stotra), Sastras being very much a part of the Vedas, we will need to say kartA means a singer (or pronouncer as you put it) to avoid human authorship of the Vedas. Sceptics are bound to argue that such a reading is farther from the more often used (as in bhAshyakAra, sUtrakAra etc.) meaning of'writer'.

  
I had given the NadyahsUktam as an instance of indication of human authorship within the Vedas and believe that it is sufficient to bring out the fact that both in the Veda and in the bhAshya, that Visvamitra is a karta of a part of Veda is freely admitted. The reconciliation of this with apaurusheyatva lies in Mimamsa, which treats such instances as arthavAda.



This also brings us to the 'cream' of Vedas. My understanding is that vidhi vAkyas are the main purport of Vedas according to mImAmsakas; the arthavAdas serve to reinforce the vidhi vAkyas like 'svargakAmo yajeta' or 'paSukAmo yajeta'. Cattle here is one form of wealth. So from a Mimamsa view-point, obtaining wealth(along with Svarga etc.) is indeed one of the mainreasons for actions ordained by the Veda.



From a Vedantic view point the teaching about Brahman is the most important part of Veda and I can understand your objection from that point of view, but then I was not defining a rik, rather giving the general structure of a hymn and bringing out how one sings praises (whoever has written those praises) and seeks wealth in return. From here to the conclusion that the rishis themselves would have written these praises, is, but a small step.



Mygeneralisation (qualified as it was) wasneither Mimamsaic or Vedantic, butapplies tothe bulk of the hymns in the Rigveda. In all the following hymns of Rigvedathe structure that I proposed obtains (by the way, my statement about general structure pertains to a hymn, sUkta, not a rik):



I.4 (Indra), I.8 (Indra), I.9 (Indra), I.10 (Indra), I.12 (Agni), I.15 (Indra, Maruts & others), I.16 (Indra-Varuna), I.20 (Ribhus), I.22 (Asvins, Savita, Vishnu and others), I.26 (Agni), I.29 (Indra), I.30 (Indra, Asvins and Ushas), I.31 (Agni), I.34 (Asvins), I.36 (Agni), I.41 (Varuna and others), I.42 (Pushan), I.47 (Asvins), I.48 (Ushas), I.49 (Ushas), I.51 (Indra). The list can go on but I guess the above 21 give a fair idea of what I suggested. \[As an aside, in the remaining thirty hymns, there is still a strong element of desire, only not for wealth, but for well being, health, security,freedom from sin and freedom from god's wrath.\]



That said, we need to take these as arthavAda, and be motivated to perform a sacrifice and/or prepare oneself to know Brahman. I heard that none of the persons mentioned in the Vedas are to be taken as historic personalities, but that they ought to be treated as characters, as it were. I have not reached this point while studying any main text and request the Pandits (not only the ones who have paNDA, thediscrimination between the eternal and the ethereal, but Pandits as used normally as well)to give suitablepointers for studying that aspect.



I also checked up your statement that the verb gAyata is used more frequently with the object 'stotras' and indeed found it to be so. Thank you for the same. I also value the rigour this forum demands in usage of words like 'stotra'; that would only make one more precise in one's communication.
