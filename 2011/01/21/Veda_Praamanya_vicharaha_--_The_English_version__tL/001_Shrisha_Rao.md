I think you mean un-authored; "unmanly" has a very different and inappropriate meaning only.

In Madhva's विष्णुतत्त्वविनिर्णय, it is said: अपौरुषेयवाक्याङ्गीकारे न किञ्चित्कल्प्यम् ।

अपौरुषेयत्वं च स्वत एव सिद्धम् । वेदकर्तुरप्रसिद्धेः । अप्रसिद्धौ च कर्तुस्तत्कल्पने कल्पनागौरवम् । अकल्पने चाकर्तृकत्वं सिद्धमेव ।

The commentaries on the विष्णुतत्त्वविनिर्णय may be consulted for a better understanding.
