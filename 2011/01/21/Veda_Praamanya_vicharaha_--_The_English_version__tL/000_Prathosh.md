Vidvad varebhyo namaha.  
  
I am posting English version of my earlier post as I didn't get any  
reply on the topic! Perhaps I may get some views this time.  
  
My question is this -- How is Veda praamanya ( or the credibility ) is  
established? As someone in one of their posts pointed out, tools of  
knowledge can only be one of the three. Pratyaksha ( The sensory  
perception) , Anumana ( The Logical Deduction ) and Aagama ( The  
scriptures or words).  
  
One cannot establish veda praamanya using pratyaksha since no body  
have any sensory perception vouching it being "pramana" or credible.  
  
Neither aagama can be used. Because the credibility of the scriptures  
used to establish the praamanya of Veda itself can be questioned.  
( There are a lot of ancient Jaina, Bauddha and Charvaka Scriptures  
which say that the Vedas are apramana ).  
  
So the only way to establish Vedas credibility is by using deduction.  
The only way of deducing it is by "accepting" it being Apourusheya or  
unmanly. Thereafter, shabda which is unmanly ought to be credible  
since apramanya of any shabda is due to the Dosha or defects of the  
Vakta or the man who creates the vakya.  
  
Now, when the situation is so, the problem boils down to the  
establishment of Apourusheyatva of Vedas. Even that has to be done  
using one of the above mentioned tools. I am very curious to know how  
it is done which is very important in establishing the credibility of  
Vedas.  
  
Let us open up a debate on the topic.
