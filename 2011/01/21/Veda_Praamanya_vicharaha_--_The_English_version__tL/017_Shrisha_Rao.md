We should be careful with that line of argument -- there are many who would use it to condemn all Indian culture and traditions.

Or, if you prefer, a crisp and to-the-point answer would be: yes, very much so.

Your reasoning is along the lines of a well-known attempt to derive authoredness from intentionality; i.e., to say that as a Vedic statement has intentionality (i.e., it conveys intent), the speaker of the same must be its author, who carries the intention and thus provides the intentionality. In other words, the authoredness of the Vedas is derived as a corollary of the claim, "The intentionality of a statement is only from its author."

This sounds reasonable, but does not hold up on closer examination; for instance, in line with provisions in the U.S. Constitution, a President of the United States takes the following oath of office (which Barack Obama famously flubbed at his inaugural and had to do over the next day): "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." U.S. Presidents have sworn this oath for over two hundred years. The intentionality in the oath is theirs, not that of the author (whoever he may have been). If one posits that a statement acquires intentionality only from an author, then no U.S. President is actually bound by his oath of office (this would certainly appear to be at least what some Presidents have believed, but that is a different topic!). If one grants that intentionality can arise from the speaker rather than only from the author, then the inference of Vedic authoredness falls apart.

Madhva also cites RV 8.75.6 as an example of a Vedic statement that has intentionality and also itself says that it is eternal, which is explained by his commentator (p. 240 of the 1969 edition of the विष्णुतत्त्वविनिर्णय) as: "तस्मै नूनमभिद्यवे वाचा विरूप नित्यया । वृष्णे चोदस्व सुष्टुतिम्" इति मन्त्रस्यायमर्थः -- अभितो द्यौः प्रकाशो यस्यासावभिद्युस्तस्मै अभिद्यवे वृष्णे वर्षित्रे नूनं निश्चितं हे विरूप नित्यया वाचा वेदलक्षणया सुष्टुतिं शोभनां स्तुतिं चोदस्व प्रेरय कुरु इति विरूपऋषिं प्रत्युच्यते ।

Years ago, towards the end of the previous millennium of the common era if memory serves, I had posted on the old Indology list this example and an analysis of why नित्य in RV 8.75.6 should have the same meaning even when analyzed using the approach of philology common among Western scholars. Michael Witzel was quick to dismiss this, but unfortunately the learned professor did not deign to actually articulate a specific error of fact or reasoning in what I had written. Those interested in this line of inquiry are encouraged to carefully study the matter for themselves with reference to the विष्णुतत्त्वविनिर्णय and its commentaries and subcommentaries, and Carl Darling Buck's "A dictionary of selected synonyms in the principal Indo-European languages: a contribution to the history of ideas."

In general, while it is not easy to accept that the Vedas are अपौरुषेय, contemporary Western theories about them seem, if anything, even more implausible. For instance, it is claimed that the Vedic language is a vernacular, and that later Classical or other Sanskrit is a more formally structured language. However, the primary, definitive characteristic of a vernacular is that it can be easily used by most people in a society, many of them with little or no formal education. Does anyone seriously believe that the Vedic language is that easy to pick up and use? Can anyone freely compose a ऋक् on the spot to convey an everyday message, such as "I will take a bath while you sweep the floor," which one ought to be able to easily do using a vernacular? It is actually seen that those who master the Vedic language (and there are very few of those) learn a lot of classical Sanskrit first before they can even begin to approach it. Madhva and his commentator say that this objection is in fact raised in the RV itself, vide कश्छन्दसां योगमावेद धीरः को धिष्ण्यां प्रति वाचं पपाद (१०-११४-९), whose purport is conveyed (after an explication of the direct meaning) as, वेदार्थस्य ज्ञाता ज्ञात्वा व्याख्याताऽपि दुर्लभः किमुत तत्कर्तेति (ibid.).

Objections to Vedic unauthoredness, whether classical or contemporary, seem to be of three major types:

\(1\) Based on sententiality (वाक्यत्वहेतु): the Vedas are composed of sentences, thus they must have authors. Jayanta Bhaṭṭa (10th. cent.?) gives the well-known illustration that if sentences could exist without authors to form them by putting together words in a proper order, then threads should likewise come together spontaneously to form cloth, sans the agency of a weaver. The intentionality argument is a special case of this.

\(2\) Based on component destructibility (वर्णनाश): a whole cannot exist if its parts do not, and thus, a whole cannot be eternal if its parts are destructible. The वर्णs that are parts that make up the Vedas only exist when uttered, and are thus subject to creation and destruction. Therefore, the Vedas cannot be eternal and thus must have authors.

\(3\) Based on temporal and such references: in the Vedas one sees narration of stories such as the romance of Ūrvaśī and Purūravas, the war between Indra and Vṛtra, etc., and also references to specific locales or artifacts such as Gandhāra or the river Sarasvatī. Therefore, the Vedas must relate only to these and must therefore have authors.

The first is dealt with by showing that the वाक्यत्वहेतु is vitiated (वाक्यत्वहेतोः सोपाधिकत्वम्) and thus cannot be used for such a derivation. The second runs afoul not only of the classical Vedantic teachings, but also contemporary linguistic theory which also accepts the distinction of phoneme and utterance. The third is answered, inter alia, with reference to cycles of time, धाता यथापूर्वमकल्पयत्, etc.
