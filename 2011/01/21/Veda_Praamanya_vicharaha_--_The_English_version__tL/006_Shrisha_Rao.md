\> This is what happens when English is used to express Vedanta views.

No, it is what happens when someone does not study a subject with the seriousness it deserves, and raises half-baked doubts based on silly misunderstandings. Why blame English for this? I also note that Vyāsarāja says that serious study can be done in other languages, and that Sanskrit can in turn be abused to describe or study śṛṅgāra and other useless subjects also.

\> My question seemed कुचोद्य to you. I didnt mean that gudhakartruka vakya itself is anruta.

That is exactly what you said, however; I quote, "My question is what is the pramana in the vakya of gudha karta being  
anrtua?"

\> As you said, its of no consequence.

Thanks. Case closed.

\> Let me clarify my doubts.

These doubts seem to have little to do with what you said before, and only seem to show your general lack of depth of understanding in this topic.

Much as I would like, given my own unfortunate tendency to enjoy idle chatter and other questionable behavior, to engage in this puerile discussion further, I will have to cease and desist for want of time -- I trust that others will take up your queries, or else that you will find the answers you seek by engaging in serious study at the feet of a qualified master (which of course is the preferred way).

Shrisha Rao
