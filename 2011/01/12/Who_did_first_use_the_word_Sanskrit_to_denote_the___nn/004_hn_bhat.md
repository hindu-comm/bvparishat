Apart from Vaikhanasa Sutra quoted by by Iyengar (of which the meaning in the context is not clear from the quoted portion without commentary), Valmiki Ramayana has got this usage seemingly in the sense of Sanskrit Language (of the classical literature):

  

Rām, Ār, 10, 54.1  
dhārayan brāhmaṇaṃ rūpam ilvalaḥ**saṃskṛtaṃ**vadan /

  

The context is the story of Ilvala and Vatapi deceiving passers by in guise of brahamana speaking Sanskrit language.

  

and among the technical literature it is usedAṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā

  
AHS, Utt., 4, 14.1  
devadvijātiparamaṃ śuciṃsaṃskṛtavādinam  

  

Of rhetoricians Dandi uses exactly in the same meaning as language:

  

kathāpi sarvabhāṣābhiḥ**saṃskṛtena**ca badhyate /1.38 of Kavyadarsha.

  

नाट्यशास्त्र too analyzes pathya as संस्कृतं प्राकृत languages. (right now I don't have correct reference)/

  

With regards
