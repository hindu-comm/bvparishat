It is not at all compatible with the quotation of the words of Hanuman himself quoted from Ramayana quoted in the previous message by Maheshwaran Nair.

  

It clearly supposes that all the twice born (dvijati) were speakingthis "SaMskRtaaM Vaacam"and Hanuman for the same reason feared that if he also uses this like the द्विजाति, Sita may mistake him for Ravana, who himself was a twice born .

  

So the belief is not compatible with the above quoted words of Hanuman himself as reported by Valmiki.
