Dear All,  
  
Before our School/College Note Books(and Text Books?)  
capture the raw-clay-mold-minds of our children  
can we provide the Symbol of our Samskruti to our children?  
Do we have any?  
  
Pardon me for the photo attached. Such photos are hot-cakes  
which draw the attention of children.  
What is the scope of "कौमारे भागवतान् धर्मान् आचरेत् "  
with "the Commission of Human Rights of the United Nations approved  
the new International Symbol of Marriage."?
