Dear Sir,

  

You can use BarahaDirect.exe partof Baraha9 which is conveniently used by me for typing Sanskrit fonts in the mail message or chat box or messenger. The present version is Baraha10 and it has been made premium for continuous use of IME (in the place of Direct.exe in earlier versions of Baraha) for more than 10 minutes (free service) and it is charges for registration 19$.

  

Even without registration, you can use IME for 10 minutes. IME set up is separately available too. BarahaDirect.exe is not available now as the earlier version is no mo more available in their site. If you prefer, I can send the link to Baraha9 I had downloaded earlier. IME has some other problem too I have seen. It doesn't show they typed matter in chatbox dialogue input box (while typing) and only it is visible in the sent message. But this doesn't affect other messages or any applications. Here is the link to the software site:

Vedic accents too should be available. I have not used it for typing documents.

  

With regards
