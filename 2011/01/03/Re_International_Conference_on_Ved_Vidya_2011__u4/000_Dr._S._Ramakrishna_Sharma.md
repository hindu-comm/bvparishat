Dear Prof.Ram Gopal,  
  
As already conveyed to you that the tickets as per your request were  
booked and the PNR no was sent to you by SMS. I do possess a copy of the same.  
  
In spite of this, without cancelling the schedule sent to you, you have now come out  
with this surprising mail. It has caused financial loss to the Organizing Committee  
and damage to your reputation.  
  
The matter will be brought to the notice of Pujya Swamiji. I leave the matter to the guardian  
Deity of Udupi.  
  
Without any sense of moral responsibility you have done this to a Spiritual Institution which  
has 700 years of living tradition.  
  
Your ticket details are as follows.: IA PNR-78X6LR Ramgopal/Dr/ETKT-058-1763217319  
IC179 20Jan 11-00 BOMIXE OK.IC/RCNYUP.  
Generated by Amadeus.  
  
This will certainly back fire on your future pursuits of knowledge.  
  
With regrets.
