Namaste  
  
The discussion seems to be heading to personal animosities of scholarship; and it seems time to have some serious additional input that needs to be looked at in relation to the above topic, calmly and quietly. The debate of 'Shaastra' in the context of 'Traditional studies' and its continuous flow is one thing. Another thing is to look at the developments in allied fields and see how it just gels with the current studies.  
  
While I don't want this to be a diversion round on this thread, it is good to keep track of the following developments while these discussions are on:  
  
**The challenging question is this**: If the ancient 'Shaastrajna's could identify several of atmospheric changes, earth layers et al, without any use of the modern sophistry of equipments, then what was their method to arrive at the same goal? facts ? Predictions ? Patterns ?  
  
**Ref:** US Patent dt.August 11, 1987  - 
<http://www.crashrecovery.org/haarp/US-Patent-No-4.686.605.pdf>  
  
**Subject**: Method and apparatus for altering a region in the earth's atmosphere, ionosphere, and/or magnetosphere  
  
**Project name** : HAARP **\[HAARP is acronym for “High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program”. The official [HAARP](http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/index.html)site of states it “is a scientific endeavor aimed at studying the properties and behavior of the ionosphere, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and defense purposes.**  
  
**Brief Note**: **”\]****Most people** never even heard of HAARP, but fact is, HAARP installations exist and are most likely than not, responsible for a lot of foul weather and earthquakes in the past 15 years. Investigate and you will find the facts. Or just stay ignorant and blissful. It's up to you.

  

Your Country/family/friends/patriots, fellow human beings, nature and our Mother Earth need you to "WAKE UP". **This weapon was brought into the world over a hundred years ago by Nikola Tesla and patented by Bernard Eastlund.** US PATENT #4,686,605 <http://crashrecovery.org/haarp/US-Patent-No-4.686.605.pdf>

  

**What is HAARP ?**

  

HAARP is acronym for “High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program”. The official [HAARP](http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/index.html) site of states it “is a scientific endeavor aimed at studying the properties and behavior of the ionosphere, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and defense purposes.”

  

Outlining the object of it also adds up “HAARP program is committed to developing a world class ionospheric research facility consisting of:

-   The Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high power transmitter
    facility operating in the High Frequency (HF) range. The IRI will be
    used to temporarily excite a limited area of the ionosphere for
    scientific study.

  

-   A sophisticated suite of [scientific (or
    diagnostic)](http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/diag.html)
    instruments that will be used to observe the physical processes that
    occur in the excited region.

“Observation of the processes resulting from the use of the IRI in a controlled manner will allow scientists to better understand processes that occur continuously under the natural stimulation of the sun.”

  

“Scientific instruments installed at the HAARP Observatory will be useful for a variety of continuing research efforts which *do not* involve the use of the IRI but are strictly passive. Among these studies include ionospheric characterization using satellite beacons, telescopic observation of the fine structure in the aurora, and documentation of long-term variations in the ozone layer.”

  

**Is HAARP responsible for foul weather and earthquakes ?**

  

There are some HAARP sites identified two years ago. They left some key ones out: Chile (HAARP earthquake as President was sworn in), Cyprus (Black Sea Storm), Dushanbe Tajikstan (Tien Shan gold belt), and ANTARCTICA - the most important one. Plus, they forgot all the Russian installations - more than any other country.

  

Here are the main mining projects of Eurasian Mining Company inc. which are all located where mining riches are located.
<http://www.eurasianminerals.com/s/Home.asp>. Started by Frank Giustra who flies around the world to secure mining contracts in these key places after of the country he wants to mine in.

 

The HAARP sites are located globally where the richest mineral belts are located. Subsurface mineral exploration has been done from satellites by radiotomography that is 100% accurate  
  
For your information while deliberating on vedic traditions and modern science related.
