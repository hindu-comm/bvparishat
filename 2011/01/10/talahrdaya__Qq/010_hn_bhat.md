I have already checked with Hemachandra's Abhidhanacintamani published in St.Petersburg (reference given in my previous message) it is one of the five kosha-s by Hemachandra, that deals with synonyms in general whereas the others have specific objective, nanartha, desi namamala etc. The reading only differs and the same *vigrahavakya* explanation same is given as quoted from Hemachandra's lexicon with reference to a different edition (but not edition specified). If there is any bibliography to the printed edition available, it could also be verified. From the lexicon quoted, the use of tala only also means the same thing.

  

May be found in other lexicons also, like Rajanighantu etc. special lexicons specific.
