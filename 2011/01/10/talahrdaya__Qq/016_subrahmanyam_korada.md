Thank you Dr Kalyanaraman , sorry for the belated reply .  
  
The Occidental Method does not talk about the 'deciding factors of meaning ' . As most of us are aware , their approach towards Language is quite different , changing and in most cases, confusing . Clarity is simply sacrificed .  
  
This book is first of its kind , i.e. both Oriental and Occidental are put in a nutshell .  
  
Since 2008 till date there was no Review from America , Canada , Britain and Pune (BORI) .
