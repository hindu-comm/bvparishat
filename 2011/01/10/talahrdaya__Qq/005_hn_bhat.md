Dear Bhattacharya,

  

In continuation of my previous message, I found the source lexicon cited in शब्दकल्पद्रुम software of Rashtriyavidyapitha, as follows:

  

तलहृदयम्।

(क्ली) (तलस्य पादतलस्य हृदयमिव।) "पादतलस्य मध्यम्" इति हेमचन्द्रः (३।२८२)।

  

I have not checked the edition of both the शब्दकल्पद्रुम and हैम-कोश

  

Hope the lexical source is located, but has to be checked with the source.
