I discussed '**talah.rdaya**' in my book - Theories of Language - Oriental and Occidental , p 65 .  
  
The term is in **Upaveda - Vaidyakam , Caraka and S'sruta .  
**  
There are Deciding factors of Meaning / **Arthanir.nAyakA.h in VAkyakA.n.da of VAkyapadIyam such as Samyoga, Viprayoga etc .**  
  
Similarly there are **36 Tantrayuktis in CarkasamhitA (40, SiddhisthAnam) and 32 in S'usrutasamhitA ( Uttaratantra , 65-4, Bhattaraharicandra , the commentator, enumerates 40 ) ( in Arthas'Astram also 3-15 ).  
**  
I prepared a coprehensive list of **32 Tantrayuktis and illustrated** .  
  
The text from my book --  
  
**24 . Sams'aya.h : offering reasons / causes for two different things is ' Sams'aya ' . For example " hitting on talah.rdaya ( center of the sole of the foot ) would be fatal . , whereas chopping off legs or hands would not be fatal .**  
  
**Bonus info : The nerves from 'tlah.rdaya ' are directly connected with the head . Application of coconut oil on 'talah.rdaya' at the time of bed would cool the eyes and brain .
