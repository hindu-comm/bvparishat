Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Science In Vedas



I am not getting postings of bvparishat in my mail box ([gira...@juno.com]()). So I am responding independently.



If we accept "Vaidika rituals " and their Mantrasas science, then to preserve original recitation of Mantras, the sciences of Phonetics and Phonemics and Phonology were developed way before Panini. Letters of alphabet of Sanskrit VarNa-mAlA arranged according to their origin in human vocal tract is scientific. **Any science is contemporary activity**. As time passes on meanings of certain Vaidika words used in rituals thousands of years ago may become less clear. So my research was focused on Sanskrit words and their meanings. Changes in grammatical endings have taken place. Everybody knows that. I am reading the book "The Vedic Etymology" by Dr. Fateh Singh from Rajasthan. One can see various etymologies of very ancient words. Last year I wrote on etymology of Sanskrit words from Shatapatha Berahmana. Since Vedic or Sanskrit is very old, there might be internal mechanism to preserve meanings of Sanskrit words. Assumption is made here that Sanskrit has preserved at least 70 percent of her ancient words intact. Here I focused my research. In order tocheck the originality of Sanskrit, I went searching towards the ancient history of the western countries (because of Indo-European family of languages) and I discovered extension of Mahabharata Empire beyond borders of the subcontinent. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
