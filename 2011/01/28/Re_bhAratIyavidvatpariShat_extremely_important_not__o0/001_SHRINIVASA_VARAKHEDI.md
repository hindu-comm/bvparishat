Dear members,  
  
Let us appreciate the efforts taken by the present management team of the BVP. I support the view expressed by the BVP leader.  
  
I also appreciate if any scholar comes forward to join us in management and other voluntary works.  
  
I also propose to hold the first bi-annual meet in a suitable place to decide the future of the BVP. I am happy to share that many conferences are held by getting contacts through BVP.  
  
warm regards,  
shrivara
