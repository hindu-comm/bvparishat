a good discipline is warranted and the parishat would be a good platform to clarify , discuss and educate onself with more information and instruction.Also an opportunity for getting acquainted with new scholars and workers in different fields of knowledge..  
academic and impersonal appraoach would be the content.``.

**Subject:** {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} extremely important notice to all the esteemed members  
  

  

dear all esteemed members, good belated wishes of Republican day to you all.



itis good twoyearsthat bv parishat is established to (as explained in welcome message)share your ideas, research papers, presenations, projects etc., to discuss the issues related to Sanskrit Research - Philosophy, Literature, Grammar, Science and many more....

ithas been more than successful in its purpose as experienced byall the members.there is no more need to invite scholars to become members as we did in initial times. now it has nearly 450 members.it hascome to a position that more and morescholars are requesting to be members without invitation. we will see a day when this forum will become only one foremost group dedicated to this purpose. this day is sooner than we imagine.

  

  



this mail is to address some of the problems we are facing in bvparishat. let us clarify.





1.in recent times we have seen many unrelated messages flooding the bvparishat.  this type of flooding will serve no purpose of anybody. bvp is not a dustbin to send a Cc message that is meant to be sent to other such groups.this has led to protest by many colleagues. **we are extremely sorry to have taken extreme steps to prevent such floodings.** But we hope to good times in near future when we need not take such steps. we promise to take such steps. many mails political in nature/ with unproven allegations against certain scholars/ totally unrelated contents may harm bvp's reputation.



**we request all the members to exercise extreme restraint on sending anything not related to the subjects stated above in welcome message.**



we need bvp for ourselves. we need it for our own life i.e. samskrit. bvp has to be protected by each and everybody member from anything that harms it. it will serve his own purpose. it is not for me or you, it is for all of us.



2\. similarly we have seen some colleagues are using words not certainly suitable for scholars. **it is important to maintain the decorum of the forum.** offcourse it is true that many a time we face a situation we are tempted to make to a little bit harsh remarks. but the language should be very courteous and discussions should be cordial.

even if some juniours seem to make unwanted remarks on any matter we need to make them aware of the problem and let them correct it by themselves. belittling colleagues and abusing them is not acceptable in any case.

we should be very careful in our aim whichis very clear in the following verse which appears in all the messages sent to bvp

  

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।

तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.).

  

it is crystal clear for all the members as to what this samgraama means, and with whom we are fighting. we should make ourselves assured that our ammunitions are not misdirected.

  

3\. it is extremely necessary to have a good advisory board and a strong management team to run the forum more efficiently. we invite all the members to come forward to suggest anything that will improve bvp as well as to take part of management so that no single person should be burdened with many tasks.

  

we request everybody to take this message very seriously and help the Samskrit studies to grow up.
