Dear Srinivas Varkhedi,  
This awareness has come late. But it is correct that many types of  
personal mails and writings do not serve well. I remained a reader for  
some time in this group. It is nice to read academic questions and  
relevant replies to them. May be some conferences and new seminar  
themes emerge out of this discussions. I accept that some regulations  
should be there now. I will come forward to help.  
Society is very big. Lovers of sanskrit and sanskrit related subjects  
are many. Eminent personalities from other fields of study with  
genuine interest or awareness about sanskrit, sanskrit linguistics,  
bharatiya darsana may be allowed to share their views. This option  
may broaden the research area. Interdisciplinary themes will come.

I read in the past that sanskrit will be removed from schools slowly.  
Need of study of sanskrit may be understood slowly, if  
interdisciplinary subjects, degrees and diplomas are offered at a high  
level study. New programes may be developed. What are the areas of  
study (philosophy, linguistics, history, archeology, astrology and  
astronomy, ayurveda) where people do without the knowledge of  
sanskrit. But it is always felt that basic knowledge of sanskrit to  
understand a text would have been better.

Scholars from all these area may feel like expressing their idea to  
design new courses. Introducing these in university and colleges is  
another big task. But this idea is like pouring from the top.  
thank u.  
ndash.
