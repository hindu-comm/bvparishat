 Most of it is speculation and wishful thinking. At a metaphysical level Vedantic thinkers Shankara and Madhva (in the *Brahma-sutra Bhashya* and *Tattva-viveka*) had addressed problems in reality that have come up following quantum physics. But one has to be careful and not make excessive claims.



 Any similarities need to be explored in the metaphysics and not in details like particle physics. I am working on a book on the topic.
