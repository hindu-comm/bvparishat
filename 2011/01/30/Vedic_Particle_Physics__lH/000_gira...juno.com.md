Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Vedic Particle Physics.



In the recent three day (Jan21 to 23) conference( in Udupi-I think) Dr. Khem Chand Sharma from Delhi presented paper on "Vedic Particle Physics" . Some members of this list attended the conference. Could any body throw light on that presentation?



There was another paper-Vedic Science viz-a-viz Modern Science by Dr. Chandra Prakash Trivedi, Indore. How was it? Any information?



Because of internet availability, at present there are many websites of people from India and people of Indian origin from foreign countries. Many of them are writing on Physical Sciences in Vedas-even Nuclear Physics. I would like to study how ancient Indians coined such words in Particle Physics and Nuclear Physics. Any help is appreciated. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
