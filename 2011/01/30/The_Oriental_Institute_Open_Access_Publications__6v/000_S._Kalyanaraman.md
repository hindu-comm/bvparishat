Starting in 2004, the [Oriental Institute](http://oi.uchicago.edu/) committed to digitizing all of its publications and making them available online, without charge. The minimum for each volume, old and new, current and forthcoming, will be a Portable Document Format (PDF) version following current resolution standards. New publications appear online at or near the time they appear in print. Older publications will be processed as time and funding permits. About than two hundred and sixty five volumes are now online.
