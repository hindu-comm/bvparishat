Dear Dr. K:  
  
All sounds are essentially a "pulse". they originate a "0" and get to the max at "1" or "100" on the Y Axis.  
  
Sane scenario can be applied to electro-magnetic radiation as well.  

  
This also can be extrapolated to concepts documented by sages, who were the visionary scientists of their times. Their ides created a pulse and set the change in motion.  
  
That is probably the reason why Sanskrit language may have applied / used the term " shabda" that could be applied to meaning - a "word", a sentance or a paragraph or the whole concept. Expert opinion from Sanskrit grammarians on this list would be most welcome to improve my understanding of Sanskrit terminology from the technoical perspective.  
  
Thank you in advance,  
  
Best regards,  
  
Dr. Yadu
