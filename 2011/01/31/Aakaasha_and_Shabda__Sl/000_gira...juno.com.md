Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Subject: Aakaasha and Shabda.



Thanks Dr. Kalyanraman for presenting multiple meanings of "GuNa"

But my question remained unanswered. I will repeat it.



Itis said that GuNa of Aakaashis Shabda. I never understood this. Aakaasha is one of the five Mahabhootas of ancient Indian philosophy. If we assume Shabda means sound, then how can sound be the "GuNa" of Aakaasha (vacuum)? Sound needs material medium for propagation. Ialso asked ealier the etymology of the word "Shabda" (The root Shabd means to sound--Apte Dict.).



According to my understanding Shabda is sound pulse. In Sanskrit literature Shabda may mean many different things. I am familiar with that. My question is how Shabda is GuNa of Aakaasha.

Please help.Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
