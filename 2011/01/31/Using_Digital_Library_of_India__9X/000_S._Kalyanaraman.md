The holdings of the Digital Library of India are fantastic, but some may find the DLI interface for viewing single images cumbersome and prefer working with a PDF file. A piece of freeware for Windows called "DLI Downloader" ([http://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/dlidownloader/](http://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/dlidownloader/)) claims to help with this, but I haven't been able to get it to work for me. Instead, I've been using a slightly more involved process to create PDF's from the individual images in DLI. It was suggested to me that some members of H-ASIA may find this useful, so I am sharing it here. Caveat: I'm using a PC andAdobe Acrobat(Full, not Reader) for this process. I can't speak to how or whether this will work on other platforms and with other PDF creation programs.  
  
To begin, you'll need to download all the individual images of the desired text from DLI. The freeware program called "LTVT Image Grabber" can do this after its default settings are changed as I describe below. The program can be downloaded in the file "Image_Grabber.zip" at[http://ltvt.wikispaces.com/Utility+Programs](http://ltvt.wikispaces.com/Utility+Programs). After downloading, extract Image Grabber from the ZIP file onto your computer and follow these steps:  
  
1. In an internet browser (I use Firefox), locate the desired book in DLI and open the first page image by clicking on the "BookReader-1" link. This will open a new tab or window with a single page of the book. At the center of the bottom of the screen, to the right of the navigation arrows and page number indicator ("X of Y Pages") is a menu box with options like PTIFF, HTML, TXT, RTF and Meta. Ensure that PTIFF is selected.  
  
2. Note down the final page number (the Y value in the "X of Y Pages" area) between the navigation arrows at the bottom center of the page. You'll need this for step 7.  
  
3. Right-click somewhere on that browser page and select "Copy Image Location" (in Firefox, at least) to copy the image URL to theWindows clipboard. Note: this will not be the same URL that is listed in the web browser address field at the top of the window.  
  
4. Start up the LTVT Image Grabber program and click on the tab "Numeric Sequence" near the top of the window in order to reach the settings that need to be altered.  
  
5. In the field labeled "Number Prefix" replace whatever is there with the URL copied from the browser in Step 3.  
  
6. Make the following changes in Image Grabber:  
6a. In the field "Number suffix" type ".tif" (withoutquotation marks)  
6b. In the field "Downloaded file name suffix" also type ".tif" (again, no quotes)  
6c. Click on the Destination Folder button to choose where you want the downloaded images to be saved. Ultimately each individual downloaded image will end up in this folder, with the name "AS15-M-" followed by the downloaded page number.  
  
7. Also in Image Grabber:  
7a. In "Start #" enter the first page number (usually 1)  
7b. In "End #" type in the number that you observed in step 2.  
7c. In "# Digits" enter the number of digits in the final page number (usually 3, or occasionally 4 for very large files)  
  
8. Return to the "Number Prefix" field where you pasted the DLI image address in step 5.  
8a. Delete the ".tif" from the end of the address  
8b. Delete the final two, three or four digits of the remaining address, corresponding to the number you typed in "# Digits" in step 7c. If this step isn't followed exactly, Image Grabber will give error messages when you try to download.  
  
9. Click on the "Retrieve Files" button at the lower left of the Image Grabber window, and the downloading will begin. It may take some time for all of the images to download, depending on the size of the book and internet connection speed.  
  
10. Once the downloading is finished,open Adobe Acrobatand go to File \| Create PDF \| From Multiple Files. This will call up a small window asking where to look for the files. Navigate to the destination folder you entered in step 6c, select all the images to be added to your new PDF document, and follow through with the rest of the self-explanatory Acrobat process to create a single PDF from all the individual image files.  
  
This may seem complicated at first glance, but after a couple tries the logic of it will be obvious.
