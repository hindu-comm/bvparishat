The actual problem in the DLI is not so much about downloading images. downloading images can be done in various ways (i use orbit downloader). But the criminality of their work has been:  

1.  total callousness in naming books: There has been no naming
    standard. R^igveda has been named as Rigveda, Rgveda, Rugveda etc.
    Not limited to names of works, it extends to names of people as
    well.  
2.  not allowing google to index but having their own search. Their
    whole interface sucks!!! 3.  No plan in scanning: Multi volume books have different versions and
    some volumes are missing Eg. in the Vedic Concordance (12 vols) of
    Vasubandhu, i was able to locate at least two copies of 3 volumes
    each, the other volumes are missing. 4.  Some scans are truncated at the top, bottom, right, left (this was
    in earlier scans, the later scans seem ok). 5.  Some scans are unnecessarily large (some individual pages containing
    only text are larger than 200k).  

Another instance of tax-payers money gone down the drain. Any high-school student team would have done a better job.  
  
I shouldn't stop at the above. In case Shri Kalyanaraman or anyone else in the group has any connections with the authorities who are in charge of DLI, I am ready to do the indexing work for them (notwithstanding the fact that i passed out of high school 15 yrs ago).
