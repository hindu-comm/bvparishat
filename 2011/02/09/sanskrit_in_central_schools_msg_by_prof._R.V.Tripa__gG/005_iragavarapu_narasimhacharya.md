Dear Friends,  
The message forwarded is very much regretted.There are certain good  
ministers like Shrimati Purandareswari in the HRD.Those who know her  
intimately may be contacted  
to impress upon the need for Sanskrit at this juncture as we  
experience morale degradation every-where.  
Regards,  
ins.
