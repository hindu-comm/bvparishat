Sir,

TheHonorable Court's direction onthat case (299/1989) is clearly overlooked by the govt. we must file a case of "contempt of Court" in this regard in Supreme Court.

this will help in restoring the Sanskrit Studies in Schools.

technical aspects of Sanskrit like "the role of Sanskrit in language technology" is be produced as asupportive argumentin this regard.

to understand German, the study of Sanskrit will be helpful as it is claimed that both languages are similar (syntactically).

we should collect arguments in favor of importance of Sanskrit in modern studies and produce those facts in Court.

we will do it:)
