Dear Sir/friends,

It is a very sad and painful incident that the Govt of India/HRD is going in a wrong directon to kill our culture, language, own thinking, our customs our past and present history. Every Indian should question for the justification implementing zerman language in the foundation stage of a child. Are they not Indians and why are they nourshing and growing other languages and culture. It is a very shameful for us that we are not coming out in the streets like other countries. It is the resposibilities of every Indian to protest the same. I think they have forgotento Gandhiji, Vinobhaji, Aurovindo, Vivekananda, Dr Radhakrishnan, Raman maharshiand their massages to country-men; what we can say aboutsages and seersof India. My strong feeling is that we should make one sound and one opinion to protest and keep safe our mother and source of our culture and life.
