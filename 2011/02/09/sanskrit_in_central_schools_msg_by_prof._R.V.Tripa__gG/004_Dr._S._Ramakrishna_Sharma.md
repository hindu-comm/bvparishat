Respected Scholars,



I have uploaded a PDF which is useful as a

support document to argue for the cause of Sanskit.

It contains the clinical findings of a team of surgeons

who have applied Sansskrit to set right the speech

of children who were victims of cleft palete syndrome.

I have shared it with BVP and F.I.S.H Groups.



Dhanyo'smi.
