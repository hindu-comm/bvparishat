**About ‘Atmopasana Dhyana Yoga’ (Universal Meditation technique):**

*“Every human being is made to be a beacon of divine light, radiating
peace, love, and beauty. Every day as we live our lives, our hearts can become clouded by life events, pain, and other impressions that may cloud the mirror of our hearts*

*Why is it that so often we are not in a state of peace, love, and mercy within ourselves? When we are not in a state of love , peace and harmony, our lives become imbalanced . As a result , unhappiness and even physical diseases enter into our lives.*

*In the Meditation workshop, participants will learn the fundamental principles of “ADY” and gain the tools necessary to start or expand their practice. Appropriate for beginners as well as experienced practitioners, this is a great opportunity to learn about the benefits of daily sadhana (meditation), and to uncover some of the mysteries underlying the sacred science and technology of Vedic tradition.”*

This Meditation Workshop was earlier conducted as part of **DASOHAM-2010**. **(National Workshop on Spiritual Research Methodology**) held at Brigade Millennium, Bangalore. The memories of the workshop are still fresh and many Atmopasakas (meditators) have requested to arrange the workshop so as to re-live those magical moments of meditative bliss.

Please find the feedback of the participants who have attended DASOHAM-2010 in the post script below.

Haraye Namaha,

**PS: Feedback from DASOHAM-2010:-**

1.At a time when most of Universal Dhyana techniques are patented by "so called gurus" , here is one such dhyana which is truly universal and is in sync with the concept of " vasudeva kutumbakam " Hearty congratulations to all the members who made the workshop a grand success.- Krishna Rao

2.The "Atmopasana Dhyana" course can be useful for beginners like me if practiced.I did attain a wonderful state of mind during the session. -Vijayasarathi Anandateertha

3."Thank you very much for giving an opportunity to be in that divine environment.I was very much impressed by the Meditation class. It was absolutely simple and really helpful. I was in search of a verse which really appeal to my antaraatma. I was greatly helped by the verse that is taught." - Shubha

4.I want to congratulate Acharya Atmadasa for this grand success of the workshop. 30min meditation procedure was really a wonderful experience for me. I would like to share some of my experiences here. As the process of meditation started it took me to a higher plane where after some time i could see some flashes intermittently. This happened for 4 to 5 times and at the end my body became very light and i could not feel my presence. I kindly request acharya to guide further in this regard and conduct sessions further. -Dr. Manjunath. G
