Sir



Durmukha occurs every 60 years. For instance all the following years (AD) are Durmukha as per one authority (Sewell, Robert and Sankara Balkrishna Dikshit; "The Indian Calendar: With Tables for Conversion of Hindu and Muhammadan into A.D. Dates and Vice-versa"; Swan Sonnenschein & Co. Ltd., London, 1896): -  
  
342-43, 401-2, 461-62, 520-21...

1113-14, 1176-77, 1232-33, 1291-92, 1350-51...

1656-57, 1716-17, 1776-77, 1836-37, 1896-97,



Further the mAsa is named as Tula; this could be a solar month, corresponding to the latter part of the lunar month, ASvayuja or the first part of kArtIka. We need to check in which of those years, the KrishNaikAdaSI corresponds to Saturday and uttaraphalguni. I will try considering it to be ASvayuja.



Technically palm leaf manuscripts can be quite old, but I have considered only the five years given in line 3 above and found the following dates to be ASvayuja krishNaikAdaSI in those years (following the source quoted above):



Nov 1, 1896, Sunday, Purva phalguni (equi-distant nakshatras, Garga siddhanta) or Uttara Phalguni (Brahma Siddhanta)

Nov 4, 1836, Friday, Purva phalguni (equi-distant nakshatras, Garga siddhanta) or Uttara Phalguni (Brahma Siddhanta)

Nov 6, 1776, Wednesday, Purva Phalguni (equi-distant method) or Uttara Phalguni (Garga & Brahma siddhanta)

Oct 20, 1716, Monday, Uttara Phalguni

Oct 4, 1656, Saturday, Magha (equi-distant method) or Purva Phalguni (Garga & Brahma siddhantas)



None of the above matches exactly, but one could make a few observations:



\- The month looks like an amAnta month (now used in South India) because ASvayuja krishNaikAdaSI could conceivably be also an Uttara Phalguni only in amAnta months and not in pUrNAnta months (now used in North India).

\- In the above, I have assumed the year to be the luni-solar one (used in South India), not the one based on Jupiter (used in North India)

-The above are for the longitudes of Ujjain, so thetithi could be displacedby aday on either side for placesfurther east or west of Ujjain.



In effect, I am unable to give the correct answer, but I hope the above shows how the co-relation ought to be done. With more work, one might be able to figure out the exact date, esp. if one were able to look at the condition and content of the manuscript.



Presently, I do not persevere further because a difference of one day is quite common given the different systems (Suryasiddhanta, Aryasiddhanta etc., with bija or without bija etc.) followed by different groups of people and we have two dates in 1836 and 1656 which are quite close to the one described in the colophon. Also different tables prepared by different scholars seem to indicate different dates (mainly due to the value of bIja used), differing by usually no more than a day, and rarely two.
