Dear Madam,  
  
Happy to read your mail. Thanks so much.  
Yes, we are fine, doing well. Jan is busy with his teaching in Paris and  
I am busy in preparing for my courses at Heidelberg, Bucarest and Amsterdam.  
Hope that you are fine. We are looking forward to seeing you in Delhi in 15WSC.  
  
With warm regards from us,

\> \> Since the month is mentioned as 'Tula' (solar) I guess it could be a Southern manuscript. 20116-17 AD would be Durmukhi Samvatsar. Going back in multiples of 60 years we get 1596, 1656, 1716 etc. I checked up the date with Yano's Pancanga software. It shows 1656 AD was Durmukhi, 14th October was Saturday, Krishnapaksha, Ekadashi. THe Nakshatra was Magha/U.Phalguni. The output is copied below.
