Dear Dr.Rath,  
I will try. But the text is problematic as you have pointed out. My  
worry is it appears to be a mix of Sanskrit and Hindi(?). "sevā me"  
sounds odd. Also why the first word is "rāma" with a long 'a'?. My be  
one has to search for all aśvina śu pancamis matching with Thursday  
and correct the year.  
regards

RNI

\> Since the month is mentioned as 'Tula' (solar) I guess it could be a Southern manuscript. 20116-17 AD would be Durmukhi Samvatsar. Going back in multiples of 60 years we get 1596, 1656, 1716 etc. I checked up the date with Yano's Pancanga software. It shows 1656 AD was Durmukhi, 14th October was Saturday, Krishnapaksha, Ekadashi. THe Nakshatra was Magha/U.Phalguni. The output is copied below.
