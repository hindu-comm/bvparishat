Dear Dr. Mrs. Mahulikar,



Here issome tentative calculationbased on the informations you have given for the palm-leaf manuscript.



a. Friday (not saturday: mandavAsara), 22 October 1897 CE. Sake 1819, Vikrama Samvat 1954. Durmukha samvatsara, AsvinaKrsnapaksa 11

This calculation is according to Luni-Solar cycle (Southern).



b. Tuesday 3 November 1885 CE, Saka 1807 Vikrama 1942 , Durmukha samvatsara, AsvinaKrsnapaksa 11 (Brhaspati cycle, Northern)



Incase the ms.seems to beolder than this period (which can be ascertained from the calligraphy/style of the script), then the close calculation could be,

    a. Friday 27 October 1826 CE;  Saka 1748, Vikrama 1883, Durmukha samvatsara, AsvinaKrsnapaksa 11  (Brhaspati cycle, Northern)

As you know that the Samvatsara is a 60-year cycle \[in Luni-Solar (southern) and Brhaspati cycle (Northern)\] which only comes in different years in both,

the months, tithi, days, paksha etc. differ accordingly. Seeingyour information, Ipredict that perhaps the colophon writing is over in Friday midnight

that is saturday early morning and the scribe has put mandavAsara.Because forlast few centuries Durmukha samvatsara, AsvinaKrsnapaksa ekadashi

has not come on saturday (in both).Incase you find the ms. much earlier (which definitely can not be older than 15th/16th century considering India's climatic

condition), then I can provide some more dates earlier than the above ones (containing the same samvatsara, tithi etc.) Since the place of acquisition (south or

north), thetype and calligraphy of the script is not known to me, so I hope this might go more close with Northern calculation and help you in some extent.



With kind regards,

Saraju Rath
