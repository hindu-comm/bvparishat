Since the month is mentioned as 'Tula' (solar) I guess it could be a  
Southern manuscript. 20116-17 AD would be Durmukhi Samvatsar. Going  
back in multiples of 60 years we get 1596, 1656, 1716 etc. I checked  
up the date with Yano's Pancanga software. It shows 1656 AD was  
Durmukhi, 14th October was Saturday, Krishnapaksha, Ekadashi. THe  
Nakshatra was Magha/U.Phalguni. The output is copied below.
