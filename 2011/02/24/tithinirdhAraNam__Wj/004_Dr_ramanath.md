Dear Sir,  
Please see following:  
''The Shaka year 1098, Durmukha samvatsara, A. D. 1177. At this time  
king Hemadrideva of an unknown royal family was ruling at Tekkali  
(modern Barshi Takli). He defeated Rajala, son of Mallugi, ruler of  
Khandesh, who was advancing on Tekkali with a large army. Later,  
Kholeshvara, the general of the Yadava king Singhana, defeated  
Hemadrideva and probably annexed the country to the Yadava dominion.  
The inscription, records that Gamiyaya, a minister of Hemadrideva,  
constructed a temple of Vishnu, a deep tank and a well at Tekkali. The  
temple is probably identical with the present one dedicated to  
Bhavani.'' (please see for more detail on website, Maharashtra,  
Gazatteers department)
