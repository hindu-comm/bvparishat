Dear Prof. Iyengar,  
Thanks so much and this goes perfect with the informations. I too have a similar problem and  
does not match with Yano's panchanga software. Could you please help me?  
  
rāma saṃvat 1885 \|\| śrīkṣetra kā \|\| śyām nā \|\| gara-brāhma\|\| ṇena Vedamūrtiguru Ganeśa Bhaṭajī Dādā  
Gore atharvavedi tasya caraṇa-sevā me a˚ \|\| arpaṇaṃ aśvina śu\[klapakṣe\] 5 gu\[ruvāre\] saṃ 1875 (sic).  
I do not understand why there are two sa.mvat(s), and which one is to be correct and taken into account.  
Since the calculation for sam.1885 (vikram) comes Thursday, 5October, 1828 CE, I would appreciate if  
you would kindly throw some light on it.  

  
With kind regards,  
  
Saraju Rath
