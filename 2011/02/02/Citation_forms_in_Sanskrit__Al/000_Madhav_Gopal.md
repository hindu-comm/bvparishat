Respected Scholars,

PraNaama!  

I was wondering about the citation forms in Sanskrit. Generally, the citation form is one which is used as a mainentry in the dictionary. The Sanskrit dictionaries do not show any consensus regarding the citation forms as some use pratipadika as main entry and some nominative singular form. So, which one should be assumed as citation form?
