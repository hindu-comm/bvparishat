I think now the verse is correct. Vaamana is the same person who wrote the famous kaashikaa along with Jayaaditya and is the celebrated author of kaavyaalamkaara-sutra-vRtti too. In fact his erudition in grammar is understandable even this work on poetics as he has devoted a section it self on grammar and this has later led to may works like mukhabhooshaNam, apaaNineeya-paaNinikaraNam etc. Bopadeva, a scholar in poetics and vedaanta was in the court of Devagiri-Yaadava-s and this kingdom was destroyed by the khilgis of Delhi. Maadhavaachaarya (pUrvaashrama-namadheya of sri. VidyaaraNyamuni) became a great motivator in the founding of the famed Vijayanagr empire which came as a supreme Hindu-reaction to the Islamic onslaught in 1336 C.E.  
Hence the now corrected version of the verse under discussion is perhaps acceptable form the view point of chronology. In case of errors, I have to be gladly corrected by the scholars.
