Namamsi,

     I would like to make some light on this topic. there is a debate on the औजिढत् a usage in vaiyaghrapadyavartika (शुष्किका शुष्कजङ्घा च क्षामिमानौजिढत्तथा)Vamanaexplainedजि patha is traditional patha, ज patha is only Pramada.which is criticized by Vopadeva in कामधेनु, there Vopadeva said that theजि patha is not a proper patha. the text should beऔजढत्, butthis is a contradicted explanation and this was made with jealousy. later Madhavacharya criticized it and commented that the opinion of vamana is acceptable. for more details you can refer the Shabda Kaustubha of Bhattoji (8th Ahnika sutra 1.1.59).
