Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Sanskrit-Deva BhAshA or Mother of all mother tongues



In the beginning I would like say that I am not here to demote Sanskrit or Vedic.



I am reading the book “The Sanskrit Language” by the author T. Burrow (1955).The book presents words from classical Sanskrit, words from Vedas, Avesta, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Finland, and words from many ancient dialects of Europe, ancient Iran. Ancient Central Asia. The author compares them, presents phonological changes, etc. As I understand the book, the author treats Sanskrit as one of the languages of the spectrum of Indo-European language family and does not treat Sanskrit or Vedic Sanskrit as mother of European languages.



The author talks about Aryan invasion of the subcontinent. I am not worried about it. From 1955 to 2011 a lot of new research came in the light and hence invasion theory is losing its previous glow. However from the point of view of some Indian scholars, Sanskrit is presented time and again as Deva bhAs'A and mother of all languages. Within the subcontinent scholars like Dr. Sunitikumar Chatterjee have published research on languages of the ancient India and their relation to Indo-Aryan etc.



Here is my question: I am looking for a book written by an Indian Sanskrit scholar (or scholars)proving Sanskrit as mother tongue of all European languages such as Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, German, Polish, Finnish etc. giving concrete examples. I am not interested in the position paper. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
