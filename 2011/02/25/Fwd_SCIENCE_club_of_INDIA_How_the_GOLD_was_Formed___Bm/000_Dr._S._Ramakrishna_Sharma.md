How the GOLD was Formed and Where the GOLD comes from?‏  
  
Dear friends of Kutch, Geology, Science and History,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
How the Gold  
was Formed AND Where the Gold comes from?  
  
  
  
Dear friends of SCIENCE,  
Geology, Mythology Sanskrit and History,  
  
  
  
It is believed by scientists that  
Gold element formed in the solar system along with the formation of the SUN,  
planets and Solar system (about 4.5 Bn years ago). But may be possible it has  
been formed before that while universe was formed (about 13.5 Bn years ago).  
And as earth and planets formed the heavy metals remained deep in underground  
in the Magma of the planets.  
  
  
  
1) Volcanic  
ash  
  
  
  
So the source is from the underground and when ever volcanic  
eruptions occurs it also brings the gold crystals with the ash. Mt Meru has  
plenty of Gold component in Volcanic ash as the chemical analysis report  
suggest.  
  
  
  
2) Meru and Gold  
  
  
  
It's very nice to have interest in Mt meru and Geology and Mythology, so I  
forward you some thing more about it.  
  
  
  
Jain geography has lots of unsolved secrets - same as said in HINDU PURANS. Thought  
it explains of YOJANS it is still unclear what is exact measurement of YOJANS,  
and why it is not matching with scientific astronomical measurements.  
  
  
  
Many  
geologists ask first question what is JUMBU DWIP? AND WHERE IS IT? So answer is  
in Sanskrit language and in Vedas as Indian continental plate is separated form  
Gondwanaland land,  
  
  
  
We have  
been and are hearing words "JUMBU DWIPe, BHARAT KHNDe, ARYA VRUTe, KUTCH  
PRADESHe" in many processes to locate the place of the rituals. Which in  
SANSKRIT language says in SAPTAMI vibhakti (DWIPe of Dwip , KHNDe of KHND,  
VRUTe of VRUT, PRADESHe of PRADESH) of that nouns which means in IT  
(inside). Gondwanaland land means JUMBU  
DWIP. So it is said so "JUMBU DWIPe, BHARAT KHNDe"  
which means actually Kutch is in the BHARAT KHAND (geological name Indian continental plate). Inside the  
ARYAVRUT which is PART of JUMBU DWIP - geological name Gondwanaland land).  
  
  
  
If The Kutch was  
under water at that time of "SAMUDRA MANTHAN" means churning of the sea,  
that's the original land and so has fossil records back to that date. and also  
rich in Minerals, fuels, Metallic and jewels as well. As DEVAs and DANAVAs  
could retrieve those at that time why not now? On the BACK of the (Turtle) means KUTCH. And next question in line comes from the  
geologists is always where is Mount  
MERU?  
  
  
  
IN TANZANIA  
close to famous Kilimanjaro and  
ONLY about 130 Km WEST is the MT MERU  
nearest airport is ARUSA  
Airport,  
  
  
  
MOUNT  
MERU is in AFRICA now in Tanzania  
Log Latitude are: 3° 14' S; 36° 45' E more details on <http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=11205>  
4565 meters, 14,977 feet,  
  
  
  
Seeing the view of Mt MERU we see the Mt Meru  
is in Valley (Great Rift Valley of Africa) means  
  
it has been  
lowered down with the rift valley. Otherwise height of Mt Meru was more than  
that (14,977 ft + 6000 ft rift valley depth = 20977ft which is higher  
than Kilimanjaro) which is east of Mt MERU and is younger than Mt MERU.  
And also it has been said in Purana that MUNI AGATSYA (Sage Agatsya) made  
Mt MERU to Lower down !!! and then Mt Meru remained lower down since than. Meru  
means to be made of gold  
  
  
  
  
  
But  
what's the point of discussing this with ritual shlocks of Vedas?

Isolation  
Distance to Higher Peak: 69.93 km/43.46 mi  
Nearest Higher Neighbor: Kilimanjaro (ENE)  
Which  
is south of the Equator so why Kutch and Mount MERU  
so far away? The answer lies in Geology it self that After the separation from  
Gondwanaland land (Jumbu Dwip) Africa - Madagascar and Indian continental  
plate (BHARAT KHAND) are separated from each other at about 5cm /year and came  
to the present place after so 250 million years later and with the collision of  
the BHARAT KHAND- Indian continental plate and Asian plate created HIMALAYA  
about 60 Mn years in process and is still active to increase the height of Mt  
Everest (original name -QOMO LANGAM) and also decreasing the size of Nepal by  
5cm /year.  
  
  
  
And  
also said in PURANs that Meru was North of us - (UTTARE MERU) Indian  
continental plate was south of Equator and south to Mt MERU close  
to Madagascar which has moved more south now.  
  
  
  
And  
so we have similarity in fossils find of Africa and KUTCH  
- wild life, farming and civilisation also. recently Crocodilian fossil finds  
in Kutch also confirms similarity and SOON Human bone fossils 4.2Mn years old  
will be digg-ed out of Kutch soil as in Ethiopia <http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/jul2003/foss-j25.shtml>  
  
  
  
3) Pyrites - Iron pyrites, Fools gold a tell-tale  
signs of Gold  
  
  
  
Such Volcanic ash and deep hot water streams drains such  
chemicals on the surface and may deposit on surface of IRON OXIDE of Earth  
crusts to form the IRON PYRITES and Golden Pyrites.  
  
  
  
Those Pyrites looks shiney like GOLD But they are not real  
GOLD CRYSTALS so also known as the “FOOL’S GOLD” as it mimics the  
real gold shining. The are water drain also drains plenty of iron oxide in the  
water and so water discolouration is seen in drained underground waters also  
Known as “KAYO” which has dissolved iron oxide in the water. Water with iron  
oxides also has sulphides and chemical composition and reactions which makes  
the “FOOL’S GOLD” shining like GOLD.  
  
  
  
BUT as said Fools gold isn’t the not real GOLD CRYSTALS But is the tell-tale  
signs of Gold suggesting that area rich in the the “FOOL’S GOLD”,  
suggests that area also has the invisible microscopic crystals of the real GOLD CRYSTALS underground  
in the UPSTREAM AREA from where the possible water drains from volcanic  
underground area. And also proportion as higher the “FOOL’S GOLD” higher  
the chances of higher percentage of gold% in underground research area.  
  
  
  
  
Microscopic gold crystals and arsenic and that is typical ID  
of the GOLD abd can be identified with the source of the origin of GOLD from  
the UNDERGROUND Mining area. Customs’ can verify the source of mining area from  
the chemical composition of the GOLD imported. E.G. whether is from Australian  
mines or South African mine or from Indian KOLAR Mine source Of Deccan  
Volcanism.  
  
  
  
4) Kutch’s  
“Fools GOLD” Pyrites  
  
  
  
  
  
The  
PYRITE from Kutch is giving such proofs today  
as well. We have plenty of Coal and some one some day will find diamond as well  
and also gold and IRIDIUM AND PLATINUM in KUTCH.  
Do not be surprised Kutch has Iridium Rich  
layers in KHATROL range hills from ANJAR to Gadhshisha. see the report of GSI  
on iridium layers of KUTCH. and Where iridium  
is there not only KT period suggests Dinosaurs but also Next element of  
Chemistry is Platinum as well.  
  
  
  
{SO Kutch has plenty of Gold underground and in beds  
of rivers. many visit Ghana in WEST coast of central Africa to gold find trips  
from waters of the river bed. SIMILARLY KUTCH Rivers had drained plenty of  
gold in river beds in ancient times. And now those rivers are dried up but  
their river beds are still holding those GOLD Crystals as fossilised Gold stones as  
geological GOLDEN OOLIGHTS and Pyrites. ALSO 750 years ago MAMAI Deva said in  
their "VANIES" that 'SON ZARENU JUDADHO' and presently it is in  
river beds of river SONZAR in Powerpati area ZURA hills of NAKHTRANA of NW of  
KUTCH.  
  
  
  
Not Only that But also Plenty of transitional  
elements like IRRIDIUM I (Ir, 77) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium> is availabe in kutch so precious  
metals like Platinum and Uranium is also hidden along with Iridium layers  
of Khatrod of ANJAR. Coal mine of Lakhpat is also hiding diamonds under pressure  
at deeper layers.
