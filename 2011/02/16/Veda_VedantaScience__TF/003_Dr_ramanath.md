With due regards  
I request to Prof Joshi that please contact the Coordinator of the  
Conference Dr.S.Ramakrishna Sharma, for the paper of Dr. Khem Chand  
Sharma (Delhi) presented on "Vedic Particle Physics" in Jan 21-23  
seminar,Sri Vadiraj Rsearch Foundation, at UDUPI. And for the  
clarification on his posting I will send my ideas within few days as  
at present I am out of station.  
Thanks
