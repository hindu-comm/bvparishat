Madam



It is a wonderful tool, the importance of which for a beginner cannot be over-emphasised. 100 Slokas is about the optimum kind of work load where one gets to understand the concepts and encounters most of the frequently used forms. On top of it, the selection is genuine classical language (including usages not explained by Panini?); most importantly, it is rAmakathA giving, as is said, both puNyam and purushArtham.



It is very heartening to note that we nowhave some good quality resources to learn Sanskrit. The entire team which worked on this needs to be thanked by the Sanskrit-loving community. Kindly pass on to the team,the gratitude of many who silently appreciate this. The Chitrapur Math site (<http://www.chitrapurmath.net/sanskrit/sanskrit_Iesson.asp>) is seen as one of the best places online to learn Sanskrit. The present site complements that very nicely.



There are a few specific questions on the notation used:



a\) What is the schematic followed in the analysis of vibhaktis? For instance, what does 'B' in 'B-A' mean? The latter clearly is the case - A for prathamA, B for dvitIyA and so on. For some verbs 'B-v' is indicated, for instance, in the case of paripapraccha, but not so for others, for instance: SrooyatAm. I thought 'v' in 'B-v' in paripapraccha might indicate present tense, as a similar notation is used for bibhyati, icchAmi etc.; but, I see that 'B-v' is also the lable for 'abraveet'.



b\) Similarly in the vigrahavAkyAs for samAsas, there isa problem with the notation used, T7 etc.



c\) Many kridanta-avyayas like tumunantAs, ktvAntAs etc. are not marked, like jñAtum and SrutvA; similarly particles like ch and hi, adverbs like ''param', and other avyayas are not marked. I can understand that this might not have been within the scopeof the project - but from a beginner's view-point,words like 'sAmpratam' do require some explanation.



d\) Similarly in the case of the tiÑgantas; even if one were not a mImAmsaka, onedoes not deny the importance ofverb in a sentence; I found that identifying the verb first helps me in deciphering aSloka the fastest.The beginner is left wondering about the details of the verb - in which lakAra is paripapraccha? What is the dhAtu in that? And so on. One reason why some modern teachers seem to by shying away from introducing the bAlarAmAyaNa or nalopAkhyAnam as an introductory text is because the number of lakAras taught are now reduced to five - that leaves the internet-savvy beginner all the more clue-less about lakAras like lit.



A related question. What is the level of automation involved? Say, is anusArakaat thelevel where it could take aRaghuvamSam and do 70% of so of the analysis of the text into pada-pATha, identification of each componentas a subanta or tiÑganta and then thegender, prAtipadika, case and number / dhAtu, tense/mood, person and number. This abilit gives the chance for a reasearcher to determine the mudrA or mark of a particular author using the statistical analysis (as some scholars attempt to determine whether Sri Sankara wrote a particular work depending on the usage of mAyA, avidyA and ISvara in particular senses) of a part of the text.
