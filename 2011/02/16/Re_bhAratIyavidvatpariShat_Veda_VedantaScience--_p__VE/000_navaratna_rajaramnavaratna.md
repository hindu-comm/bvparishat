 It is serious conceptual error to claim that Veda and Vedanta (I leave out Vedanga) discuss scientific 'facts' as we understand them today. They do not. They do however provide us the tools which may prove to be helpful in understanding the foundations of modern physics at a metaphysical level.



 The major foundational problem is the concept of reality-- is it objective or of our own creation. Put another way is it *apaurusheya* (unmanifest) or *paurusheya* (manifest). Science is *paurusheya,* so how can it ever be a complete description of nature which is not *paurusheya?*



 This in Vedantic terms (as I describe it) is the central problem of modern physics. This is called the problem of reality-- in the sense, is what science **describes** (not what it **calculates**) can ever be real and objective? This was what the Bohr-Einstein debate was about, anticipated 700 years ago by Acharya Madhva in his *Tattva-viveka* in his criticism of Shankara.



 Please note that we need to bring a non-theistic outlook into the problem and not invoke god. If we do we will be no different from Christian theologians whoopposed Galileo. This means we must formulate a Vedantic framework suitable for modern physics and not just claim (without evidence) that Veda and Vedanta discuss science. I am doing that in a book I am currently working on.



 Particle physics is important but not as fundamental as the Reality Problem. Incidentally, nothing important has happened in particle physics in 25 years when it was discovered that neutrinos have mass. (The HADRON collider experiment failed to discover the Higgs Boson throwing a monkey wrench into the Standard Model of particle physics.)



 The last **fundamental** advance was the discovery of Bell's theorem in 1964. It is a set of inequalities but I have given it a Vedantic interpretation in the context of the reality question.



 One has to study some modern physics and metaphysics before one can appreciate some of this. It is naive to make tall claims about science and Vedanta without knowing physics. The best popular book I have seen on the subject is *The Trouble With Physics* by Lee Smolin.



 We are inviting Smolin as a speaker for the Conference on Vedanta and Science to be held on July 6,7, 2011 at the Center for Indic Studies, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. (See Attachment)
