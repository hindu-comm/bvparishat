Regards, Mandapam and mantapam are the variants only. d.a is found in a number of words like man.d.aa = fat bread ( a heaplike bread)l ; man.d.ii = a place where people come together in a rush for sale and purchase. Its derivation may be from the word Mr.t = made of earth and man.d.apa may be similar in structure. Also: man.d.aavalii, man.d.olii etc. Man.d.ala in architectural sense is also related to man.d.apa which are not only in Megh0 of KD but also structures in java and Bali etc. for Bauddha archtectural structures like Stuupa and preserved by UNESCO as Heritage Structures. A number of similar words in Indo-Aryan can be found in Turner: Dictionary: available on internet also. spnarang
