It was an appreciably good discussion on 'I'svara'.The first use may be located in the Vedic Concordance of VVBIS&IS,Hoshiarpur or could be traced with the Dictionary project at Deccan College.  
As per the word formation Dayananda at U.nAdi SU. 5.57 says : अश्नुते आशु शीघ्रम् करोति जगद्रचयति स ईश्वर: स्वामी वा । टित्वात् 'ईश्वरी' । वरच्प्रत्यये 'ईश्वरा' ।।  
The Bhik.su'sabdAnu'sAsana of Jaina Vishvabharati has the following :  
ईट् (स्त्री०) ४।१२९ , ईड: (पुं) १।३ , ईशा (पुं) ४।१९० ,ईशान: २।२७ , ईश्वर: २।१९२ ।  
Here the last is derived from the root a'sU'nt vyAptau meaning thereby 'all-pervading',but the first two are from IDa'nt stutau whereas the subsequent two are from I'sa'nk ai'svarye.\[Otherwise the word 'I'svara' also can be had from 'I's' to master (I's-varac) .'I'sa' also gives the same meaning - (I's - ka)\]  
Accordingly I'svara in the systems has been accepted as all-pervading and supreme lord or master.  
The NyAyasUtra 'I'svara.h kAraNa.m puru.sakarmAphalyadar'sanAt' points to such a God.A similar kind of allusion is in the Mahimnastotra,but it has also a non-dualistic spirit unlike the rigorously dualistic NyAya.This is the PA'supata way of looking at I'svara or Pati.  
In the Advaita'saivAgama or I'svarAdvayavAda of Kashmir,the word 'I'svara' assumes perhaps the widest significance.He is transcendent and immanent both.The fourth among the 36 principles is also 'I'svara' constituting the supreme knowledge aspect of the Supreme Godhead Parama'siva or Parame'svara.
