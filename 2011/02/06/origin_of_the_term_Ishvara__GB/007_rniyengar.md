Dear Yadu,  
Thanks for your additional explanations. I was only responding to the  
"first use" question of the word; not at all to the meaning/s. I hold  
that many sanskrit words are "nuanced". To translate them into  
isolated English equivalents without the support of the context could  
be wrong and sometimes self defeating. Of course currently in Indian  
English we do many such colloquial translations. But when technical  
words are concerned we may be erring if the fundamental postulates of  
the subject are not factored into the explanations at every stage.  
Hence the earliest usage of the word is of interest to know the  
background thoughts that leads to a word like Is'vara which closely  
means 'the (desired one) best among the leaders'. Like several other  
words Is'vara is also used with modulated meanings varying over time  
and perhaps regions. This has enormous cultural implications. One  
example: How correct is the equation "Is'vara=God"? I personally feel  
this is half-correct, that is half-wrong! In my understanding the  
worshipful Hindu-God includes God's Creation also, whereas the  
worshipful English-God originating in the Semitic culture is just the  
Creator. His creation is not worshipworthy. In fact there can exist an  
anti-God also, as if that is the complimentary set for God, to make up  
the universal set! Is there any thing similar in Hindu Shastraic  
assertions that can be interpreted as "Is'vara-abhaava"? 'NirIs'vara'  
is not same as the above. I like to be enlightened.

About the equation Is'vara=S'iva. Yes, you are right. I hold this to  
be a later development, after Rudra the ferocious the 'originator of  
the Maruts' (in RV) was considered benign/gracioius imbued with  
'S'ivatva'.

regards  
RNI
