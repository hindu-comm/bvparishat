Dear Scholar  
I have not seen the word ईश्वर used in Main Upanisadic texts. Please  
help me in this regard. In which text first time the term ईश्वर has  
used. Not ISa. Is there any similarity between ID(agnim iDe  
purohitam), ISa (ISavasyamidam sarvam) and ईश्वर. Where is the origin  
and first time in which context the term has been used ?  
Thanks
