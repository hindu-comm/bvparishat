I don't know if this would be considered the first use or not, but ईश्वर occurs literally a couple of hundred times in the Mahābhārata. In the BG alone it occurs some eight times. In the context of ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशेऽर्जुन तिष्ठति (BG XVIII-61), Śankara defines it as ईश्वरः ईशनशीलः नारायणः, and in fact reads अर्जुन as an epithet of ईश्वर (on the authority of अहश्चकृष्णमहरर्जुनं च, RV VI-9-1) rather than as addressing Arjuna the warrior. I am not sure of the व्युत्पत्ति to get ईशनशीलः नारायणः from ईश्वरः but there presumably is some. In the Mādhva tradition ईश्वरः is read as ईशेभ्योऽपि वरः (cf. Madhva's गीताभाष्य on BG IV-7), i.e., one who is superior even to Brahma, Rudra, etc., or if used with Rudra, one who is superior to the deities led by Indra.
