नमस्सभायै सभापतिभ्यश्च !

With due apologies for raking up this topic once again..

Being a new entrant, I was going through the old threads and this one  
caught my attention. I am also particularly interested in the  
etymology of the word Ishvara. In this regard, I request the erudite  
scholars of this group to examine the word de-novo with reference to  
one of the Rcas in shrI sUkta - tAM padminIM "IM" sharaNamahaM  
prapadye..., to see if the word Ishvara is by any means a derivative  
of IkAra svara

It would be of interest to note that the word "IM" has esoteric  
connotations in shrIvidyA shAstra. Tantra shastra proclaims :

tAm IkArAkSaroddhArAM sArAtsArAM parAtparAM  
praNamAmi mahAdevIM paramAnandarUpiNIM..

Regards  
आत्रेयरामशर्मा

\>  
\> Although term iishvara does not appear in R^igveda uses of root "iish" appears in "maa no duHsha.nsa iishata" (1.239), iishe hyagniramR^itasya (7.4.6), iishe yo vishvasyaaadevaviiteH (10.6.3),  
\>  
\> Another word that appears to have been derived from the root "iish" is "iishaan". "iishaano yavayaa vadham (1.5.10)", iishaanoso ye dadhate svarNaH (7.90.6).  
\>  
\> Word "iishaana" appeareing in yajurveda and atharvadeva appears to be prominently referrers to as an adjective of "siva" & "rudra", which became shivaa's name. "shvaraH sharva iishaanaH (amara
