Abhivadaye,

  

Purnapramati, a Center for Integrated Learning, is a new school started in Bangalore, which integrates Samskrit, Philosophy and Culture in main stream education at elementary level. The school is working with a goal to groom kids with strong foundations in both modern and Indian classical systems.  
  
Currently, the school is organizing its annual event "Purnapramati Utsava". The 4 day long in-house event is scheduled to conclude with a public program on Feb 6th. Young kids of age less than 6 years will share their experiences of integrated learning through a short play, incorporating diverse aspects of learning.  
  
Please find the invitation attached.  
  
On behalf of the team Purnapramati I extend the invitation to all the members.  
  
  
Regards,  
Srinidhi V  
(On behalf of Team Purnapramati)
