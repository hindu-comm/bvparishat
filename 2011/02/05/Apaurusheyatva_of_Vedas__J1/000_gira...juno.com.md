Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Please understand that I am not here to demote importance of Vedas. But I like many who are not Vedic scholars struggle to come to an correct understanding of certainversesfrom Vedas. There are great Vedic scholars on this list. So I thought that I will ask few questions. Withtheir nobleminds they will forgive me for my ignorance.



Here is my information. Please correct me if I were wrong. (1) There are river names in Vedas from the northwestern part of the subcontinent bordering Afghanistan. (2)There is name Parikhit in Atharva Veda. (3) In Rigveda there is a verse describing war of Indra with Abalaa senaa of Namuchi. He defeated lady soldiers of Namuchi and kept two lady soldiers for him.(I have no references at hand).



In the PDF file posted sometime ago on this list there was article of Prof Pralhadachar. In that article it was presented that the sequence of phonemes in Vedas is not created by human sages. It is eternal from creation to creation. Sages only read them, do not create them. If this is true then why eternal Vedas (existent versions)carry geographical information of the particular area of the earth (northwestern part of the subcontinent bordering Afghanistan)and river names therein?

If these names arethe sequences of phonemes as errorsin readingsof sages with their internal eyes, then we do not have the original they read from to prove that these are errors.

If we assume these are not errors then Vedas become paurusheya. If we assume these are errors, there is no way to check the original to prove that. We are in the loop as described by Shree Pratosh.



Note: My historical research shows to me that ladies kingdom was in the north of Afghanistan. There is description of war of ten kings. Indra's kingdom was in the area of Pamir mountains. Indra had wife Shachi, daughter of Puloma. He had son by the name Jayanta. If we accept all this is Arthavaada according to Mimaamsaa, then there is no question.



The question then shifts to the science of performing Yajnyas as described in Vedas. We have seen on this list how difficult is the subject of Vedic Yajnya with or without animal sacrifice.Until now nobody described on this list meaning of the Sarpa-satra of Janamejaya in which Indra along with Takshaka were pulled down to fall in the fire of Yajnya. Is Indra from Vedas different from Indra of Sarpa-satra of Janamejaya? If this is Arthavaada, no further question.



No body denies that Vedas have great moral principles and original ideas about creation and the creator.From that point of view their importance for the whole humanityis beyond dispute.Please enlighten us so that we grow with you in our knowledge. I have no intention to hurt emotions of anybody. Take this as debate. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
