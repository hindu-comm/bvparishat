Sir



I do not know about sarpa-satra (that is not the full details, I do know that it was conducted by Janamajeya), but there is a yajña called SyenayAga which is discussed quite extensively in mimAmsA texts. This is performed to destroy one's enemies and that is a perfectly legitimate aim. Only not being arthavat - that is not being beneficial - it and other such yajñas are excluded from the scope of dharma (which is otherwise described as 'yAgAdireva dharmah').These yAgas are not arthavAdas - they have a vidhi and all subsidiaries thereof.



For the other questions, I am not eligible to talk about them, at least not yet.
