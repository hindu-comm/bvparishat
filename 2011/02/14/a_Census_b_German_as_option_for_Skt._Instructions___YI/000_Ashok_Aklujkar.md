The following is the wording of the relevant Census instructions part. In my experience, the number of persons in India who can understand spoken Sanskrit even if they do not speak it or speak it only to a small extent is large. True, this number used to be much larger, but it is still substantial, and the Government of India needs to be made aware of this fact through the Census at least until another convenient way acceptable to the Government becomes available in the very near future.

Q. 11 : OTHER LANGUAGES KNOWN  
Write up to two languages in order of  
proficiency excluding mother tongue.  
6.78 You have recorded the mother tongue  
under Question 10. Enquire whether  
the person knows any other  
languages, Indian or foreign, and  
record up to two languages in the  
order of proficiency as returned by her/  
him in the boxes below this question.  
In addition to mother tongue, if the  
person knows only one language,  
record this language in the upper box  
and put dash (–) in the lower box. In  
case she/he does not know any  
language apart from her/his mother  
tongue already returned in reply to  
Question 10, put dashes (–) in the  
boxes under this question (See Fig. 6.60).  
*  
*6.79 The number of languages recorded under this question should not be more than two. These  
languages should be other than the mother tongue of the person enumerated and be recorded,  
one after the other, below Question 11 in the order in which the person speaks and understands  
them best and can use with understanding in communicating with others. The person need not  
necessarily be able to read and write these languages. It is enough if she/he has a working  
knowledge of these two languages to enable her/him to converse in those languages with  
understanding.
