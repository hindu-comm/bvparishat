Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Dr. A. Aklujkar, "While poems and stories are doing reasonably well, there is hardly any growth of serious, philosophical, theoretical or scientific literatures in the regional languages."



I agree with this observation of Prof. Aklujkar. On the other hand there are names of reputed scientists from Maharashtra on the board of Marathi Vijnyaana Paris'ada. Some how Marathi scientific terminology does not appeal to the readers. In many cases it appears as Sanskritization instead of touching the original concept. We need Anvarthaka Sanjnyaa even they are long. I have written on this list before on this subject. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} (a) Census (b) German as option for Skt  
Date: Sun, 13 Feb 2011 15:46:35 -0800  
  

Prof. Gauri Mahulikar has forwarded to you the message that was forwarded to me (the credit for the Marathi message should not go to me).

The English text I had prepared contains some additional thoughts. Kindly read it and act as expeditiously and extensively as you can in the interest of Sanskrit. Since I reside outside India, I do not know the stage at which the Census is and how exactly it is being conducted in various parts of India. I would suggest contacting all the college and high school teachers of Sanskrit in your vicinity first.

Text should be sent in your emails, letters etc. and should be made the content of your talks, telephone calls etc.:

Translate it in the regional languages and Sanskrit, wherever necessary. (Because I will soon be leaving Germany for Canada, I do not have the time for a Skt translation at present.)

The subject heading I would suggest for the Census-related message: "The 2011 Census and the cultural unity of India".

**Text:**

"The census being conducted now has two questions asking for three specifics pertaining to language:

10\. What is your mother tongue?

11\. What are the other two languages you know well?

This is an appeal to you to give Sanskrit and an Indian language (not English) as the specifics in answering question 11.

  
Why?  
  
Sanskrit is present in all Indian languages -- our languages, although we may not realise that we are using Sanskrit words and thinking with Sanskrit concepts when we use our mother tongues. A Most of us use Sanskrit as a part of prayers, mantras etc. as well.  
  
If the place Sanskrit has in the lives of most Indians is not conveyed to the Government of India, it will continue to take Sanskrit (and related cultural languages of ours like Pali and Ardha-magadhi) out of mainstream education. (A move is already under way, contrary to the spirit of a Supreme Court decision some years ago, to give German as an option for Sanskrit in the schools run by the central government). Before long, the money being spent for these languages will be diverted to other uses.  
  
Over the last sixty years or so, Sanskrit has gradually been taught to a significantly reduced extent or has been taken out of the curriculum in some schools. What have been the consequences? Creativity in Indian languages has gone down. It is no longer organic and robust the way it used to be. More and more Indians are uttering sentences in which nothing except common verbs like "is" and "speak" are Indian. The rest of the words that bear the specific or significant content come from English. Hardly any new business nowadays comes up with a truly Indian name for itself. Housing colonies no longer display the culture-enriching names with which they used to remind us of our great cultural ideals. While poems and stories are doing reasonably well, there is hardly any growth of serious, philosophical, theoretical or scientific literatures in the regional languages. The nourishment these languages used to draw from each other is now confined to the translations the Sahitya Academy may sponsor, usually too few and too late. Each language brings with it a way of perceiving the world. India must be the only country in the world that is handing over all those wonderful ways to English on a platter.

With Sanskrit wiped out from the face of India, we will lose ourunique cultural identity in no time. Listing Sanskrit as a response tothe above Census question 11 by each one of us can go a long way insaving this ancient and powerful language from oblivion. In its saving is also the saving of our other beautiful languages."

--------------

As for the decision regarding making German an option for Sanskrit, if you have anyNRI relatives and friends, urge them to put the Govt of India on notice that if it is going to take steps that diminish or destroy the indianness of India, they, the NRIs, will think of turning their money and talents elsewhere. A few such messages will have greater impact than the protests of a hundred Sanskritists. Unfortunately, that is the reality of our times.

This is the time to keep our internal differences apart and to make credible demands (avoid hyperboles, do not argue only on the basis of faith; stick to proven facts; make statements by keeping the other side's possible way of thinking in mind).

Writing directly to theMinister of Human Resource Development, Mr. Kapil Sibal, would be efficient.

  

A list of other ministers to whom letters could go can be prepared on the basis of:

<http://india.gov.in/govt/cabinet.php>

(roll down the screen for Ministers of State (Independent Charge) and Ministers of State)

  

If anyone can get the emails of the ministers or their principal secretaries, pl compile them systematically and make them available to the list.
