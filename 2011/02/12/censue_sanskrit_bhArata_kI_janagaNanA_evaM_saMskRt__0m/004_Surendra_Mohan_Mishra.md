Thanks Dr Kartikeyan, to ascribe to Samskrita this epithet "God's Own Language" ! In fact this is so.For the MImAmsaka-s this could be "god's own language" as there is no "God"in the system,but "gods" as Indra,Agni etc. do exist..For the materialist this also could be a fast language for health and wealth and wisdom.The wise are also "gods" as per the S'atapatha BrAhmaNa.Thus the secularly wise are no less godly ! They may adopt Samskrita as a sure way to know the best details of material existence.  
  
I look forward to the day when lacs and crores of our people, very truthfully, would be in a position to mention Samskrita as their Mother tongue.So far we have to adopt this pAk.sika satya as a need.  
  
There was a long debate on how to write 'Sanskrit' in Roman.I have finally decided to write "Samskrita" and have asked my students to do so.In the South or South-east,if someone writes "Samskruta" I have no objection.The best is '.r' but this is not keyboard-friendly in fast writing.But that 'n' in the word must be replaced with 'm'.Let this be a good start for the kind of Samskrita we want to spread sincerely.Shakespeare may argue as to what is there in a name,but in BhArata a name signifies a lot.Our nAmakarana samskAra testifies to this fact.  
  
Regards,
