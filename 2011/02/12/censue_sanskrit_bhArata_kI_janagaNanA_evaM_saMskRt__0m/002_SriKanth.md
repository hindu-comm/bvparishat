sabhAyai nama:  
  
Today they came for census data collection at our home and I have  
given Sanskrit as second language for all of us in our family apart  
from our mother tongue Tamil. I feel like a squirrel that helped Sri  
Rama. I have asked all other family friends to do the same. After  
seeing the Bangalore Sanskrit Book fair, I strongly believe number of  
Sanskrit language speakers will show up strongly in this census.  
  
Srikanth.
