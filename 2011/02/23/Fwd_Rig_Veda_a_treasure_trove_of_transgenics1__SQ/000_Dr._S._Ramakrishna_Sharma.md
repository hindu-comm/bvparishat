Rig Veda a treasure trove of transgenics

There is a sudden global interest in India’s ancient scriptures—The Vedas. The Rig Veda in particular has attracted lot of attention in the recent past. Experts have started the decoding of vedas for unraveling the scientific knowledge that the treasure book holds.The first revelations about transgenic animal sciences will be done by an Indian vedic scientist, Dr Chandraprakash Trivedi, at an international conference on human genetics that will be held in March in Cape Town.  
  
Trivedi, who successfully decoded the vedic inscriptions in the form of various scientific seals found in the Indus Valley civilisation, said that the secrets of transgenic human and animal sciences were hidden in the vedas and, if used well, the findings may lead to a larger development of human and animal lives.  
  
He said, “The decoded vedic hymns and depictions have tons of data on transgenic animal sciences. However, the process of decoding had been slow due to constrain in human and financial resources. But Indian vedic researchers have arrived at a point where they can showcase the findings to modern biologists.”  
  
“The discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by Watson and Crick in 1955 has brought about a revolution in the field of biotechnology. The Indus Valley civilisation’s pictographic symbols on the seals are cytological models for teaching and they explore the cellular genetic evolution on the earth with genetic recombination. Its literary evidences are in the vedic hymns.” The hymns, when decoded, relate to the complex processes like the synthesis of chromosome, DNA replication, protein translation, and nucleotide pairs for nuclear reaction.  
  
Demonstrating one of the decoded hymns of the Rig Veda Dr Trivedi explained, “The Tvasta (as the DNA is referred to in the Rig Veda) that gives shape to all creatures is termed as an omni form (visvarupa) and it proves that DNA is present in all living beings.  
  
The same hymn goes further and identifies the ‘Brhaspati’ which is the nucleus embedded in the DNA. Similarly, there are codes for photosynthesis, the development of eukaryotic cell, bio-geo chemical cycle, oxidation, and reduction, and even global warming, which is elucidated in Atharva Veda, which is what comes at the end of consumption of the world’s resources.”  
  
Dr Trivedi has been running from pillar to post to gather resources and clearances in the corridors of the government and professional bodies to attend the conference. “If we are not able to present the facts and findings before the global experts of bio-sciences in the global conference, I doubt we can put up these findings anytime in the near future.”
