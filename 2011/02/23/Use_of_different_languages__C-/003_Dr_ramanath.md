Dear Scholar  
I think that Shri Irangavarapu narasimhacharya has clarified whatever  
I urged. However, please read mother tongue instead of mother tung. I  
am sorry for mistake, sometimes it happen due to typing mistake.  
Please give your comments if you have understood my contention on my  
earlier posting.  
Thanks
