Dear Scholars,  
praNamyA. What our scholar friend suggested is better to follow.As  
regards the verses or quotations in sanskrit it's better to write them  
in sanskrit script.If they are  
written in English script it may seem difficult to read.Both sanskrit  
and English can be used in this forum freely.As there is translation  
system available in the computer  
I think scholars may be at liberty to select the national language  
"Hindi" also if inevitable.  
Regards,
