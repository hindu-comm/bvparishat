Dear Sir, 

  

Please forgive me if my comment annoyed you. I just wanted to make the point. But got a doubt whether it could be any American spelling variant for the same word as in many other cases and checking with the dictionary I got the specific meaning for the word "tung" and added that too.

  

I think I have not seen any other language used in the discussions in this forum in any threads unless the words from other languages are taken for the purpose of the discussion. So I have no comments.

  

I too agree that Narasimharya is correct as google offers translation for any page from any language as every internet user using Google browser is familiar with.

In spite of the facility available for translation, I don't think it is desirable to use too many languages and make the reader to take a round about to translate each message for reading, in a common forum like this dedicated for scholarly discussions. Either Sanskrit or English can be well used even though I don't have any aversion to the use of Hindi.

  

Just I remember a similar incidence during a chat with one of my young friend who is a Hindi/Marathi speaker knowing Sanskrit and ITI student. He typed in Hindi with one of his Tamilian friend who in return typed in Tamil which he could not understand and asked me to translate. He simply replied him that if you use Hindi (your language) to type (even though he could read and write Hindi), he will use Tamil typing and tamil language (which my friend could not at all understand). Why should we too create such a situation here too? I don't think we have to do such a thing.

  

I completely agree with your posting to avoid such a situation just I placed above and then resort to translation device for each message.



With regards
