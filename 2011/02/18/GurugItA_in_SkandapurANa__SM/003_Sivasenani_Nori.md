Sir



I somewhere heard that skAndapurANa is the favourite for nikshiptas,that is insertions. If someone wants some piece to pass off as purANa, it is simply inserted in the skAnda. One example is the SatyanArAyaNasvAmivrata section in the RevakhaNDa - apparently outside of South-Central India (witha bit of spillover in the East and deep South), this particular section of skAndapurANa is not popular.



I wonder if this accusation about skAndapurANa is true?
