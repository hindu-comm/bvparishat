Esteemed Scholars,  
  
I have a point to clarify.The celebrated GurugItA is considered to be a part of the Uttara-khaNDa of the Skanda-purANa as shown by the colophon of the GurugItA.In many printed editions of the SkandapurANa,as I got it, the GurugItA portion is missing.Can anybody kindly enlighten me on any printed text / manuscript which has the GurugItA as an itegral part ?  
  
Regards,  
  
SMMishra
