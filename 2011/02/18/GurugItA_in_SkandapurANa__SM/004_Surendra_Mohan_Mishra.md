Thanks Shri Senani ji, This is my point of inquiry.I want printed text/manuscript evidence to get the clue as to whether this was an integral part or this is a later interpolation.In case of the latter possibility,around what time could this have occured.No doubt this is a highly respected text in the Shaiva-Shaakta tradition.Regards,SMM.
