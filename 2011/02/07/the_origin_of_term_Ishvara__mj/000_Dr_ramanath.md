Dear Scholars  
With due regards  
The term ईश्वर has not used in priciple upanisadic texts. We do  
not find the term ईश्वर used in the sense of as a creator God even in  
the kalidas's literature. Although the term in the kalidas's  
literature has been used at several places.  
My question is simple  
i. In which text first time the term ईश्वर has used? Not ISa or any  
other twisted word like aiSvarya etc.  
ii. Is there any similarities between ID(agnim iDe purohitam), ISa  
(ISavasyamidam sarvam) and ईश्वर?  
iii.Where is the origin of this word, in which text and in which  
context the term has used ?  
  
Thanks
