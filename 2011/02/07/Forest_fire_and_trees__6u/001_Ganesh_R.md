Dear Deepak Bhattacharyaji,  
  
IN several puraana-s we do have the worship of trees along with some or the other note on their protection. However it is in the Bhavishyapuraana that we can see many allusions to the protection, planting and esoteric uses of trees. It may be this section that may interest you sir...  
  
regards  
  
ganesh
