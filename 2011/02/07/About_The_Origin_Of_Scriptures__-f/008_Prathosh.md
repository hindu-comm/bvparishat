शिवसेनानी महोदयाय नमः \|

Indeed I faced some problems apparently in Tatva Nirnaya Tika. But  
that do not mean that Tika itself is problematic. Those were due to my  
ignorance perhaps. The issues there is so subtle and one need to look  
at it from different angles. This statement made by Shri. Madwacharya  
is very strong -- "Apourusheyatvam cha swata eva siddham". This give a  
completely new directions of looking into the matter.

I discussed the matter with many scholars and have come to a  
conclusion. No other school than Dwaita has proved the concept of  
"Apourusheyatva" so neatly beyond doubts, in my opinion.

When you said -- "किन्तु यदिदानीं संशयाः जायन्ते श्रीमन्मध्वाचार्यमते

  
वा सायणाचार्यभाष्ये वा  

तान्प्रति यदि भवान् किञ्चित्वक्ष्यति तर्हि धन्यतराः भविष्यामः। ", I  
thought there are some other doubts than what I had. That's why I  
asked you to explain those.

My doubt which I had posted earlier is fairly clear to me now.
