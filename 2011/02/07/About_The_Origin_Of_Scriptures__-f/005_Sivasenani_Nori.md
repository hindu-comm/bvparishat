नमस्ते।

वेदानामपौरुषेयत्वविषये श्रीमन्मध्वाचार्यस्य केƒपि संशयाःआसन्नितिन मतिर्मम। किन्त्वाचार्यस्य तत्त्वनिर्णये तत्त्वनिर्णयटीकायाञ्च यत् स्थापितं तदवबोधने केचन संशयाः सन्तीति भवताएवोक्तम्।तदेव मयोद्दिष्टम्।



I have  
\> studied Tatvanirnaya 7 years ago with 6 commentaries in detail from  
\> him. I know each and every step Shri Madhwacharya and Shri Jayathirtha  
\> has taken to establish Apourusheyatva. ***But I have an unresolved  
\> question in that Tika itself. Even my teacher and most of us( Scholars  
\> of Madhwa community ) face that problem.***

  
\> The problem is as follows---  
\>  
\> While defining the vedatva, which is -- Avichhinna Paramparatva, he  
\> questions the presence of that in "gudha kartruka vakya" also. And the  
\> answer given is -- " Tadvakyasya anrutatvaat" . ( Refer VTN Tika ). My  
\> question is what is the pramana in the vakya of gudha karta being  
\> anrtua?
