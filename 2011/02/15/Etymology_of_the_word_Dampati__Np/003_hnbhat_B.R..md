It was simply considered as sysnonym of wife and husband, couples as found in usage and noted in lexicons of classical Sanskrit as noted by AmaraSimha:

  
2.6.38****

दंपती जंपती*जायापती*भार्यापती च तौ

The same tradition was followed for grammatical analysis by grammarians and even though दम has got the meaning of house, it was not seen recorded in the meaning of "two house holders" as given by Monier Williams. This meaning can be the same as used in Vedic occurences, if any deviating in sense. Generally used in duel everywhere in the sense of couple.(generalization of the meaning, leaving house and wife specific meaning apart). Here is the concordance with the vedic usage of the word in duel in respect of Asvins, (for which the meaning damasya pati = house holder) is given. In classical language, it is used in the sense of couples and accordingly the द्वन्द्व compound has been explained by Panini to suit the meaning in the classical language.

Here are the other references for the word दम्पति -RV.10.162.4b; AVS´.20.96.14b;**AVP.7.11.5b;**

MG.2.18.2b.

  

The others are later Dharmasastra texts and the first one is the basis of Monier Williams explanation for deriving it from dama+pati meaning householders.



Hope this would be helpful for your further enquiry. And it was simply included by Panini's classification under the द्वन्द्व compound following its classical usage for which Prof. Korada has provided support for both the interpretations. Even if the meaning of householder is to be explained by the same word outside grammar or Dharmashastra. as can be seen in the occurrences in the Bloomfield's concordance given above. For history, you can refer to the original sources provided by the list. For classical usage, there are many, but only for the meaning of householders, a special query may be needed going through all the occurrences. As per the texts, in Digital Sanskrit corpus it is used in duel only and the meaning in each occurrence can be checked online from the database with context.
