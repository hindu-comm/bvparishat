Thank you for your observation.  
"वर्ध॑मानम्स्वे दमे।" = (१.१.८)  
गो॒पा ऋ॒तस्य॑ दीदिहि॒ स्वे दमे॑...(3.010.02a)  
स्व आ दमे सुदुधा यस्य धेनुः स्वधां पीपाय सुभ्व‌न्नमत्ति \|  
सो अपां नपादूर्जय‌न्नप्स्व 1न्तर्वसुदेयाय विधते वि भाति \|\|  
(2\|35\|7\|\|)  
  
In all the three above instances, the word is interpreted as house or abode and followed preceded by the स्वे in one's own. And its usage, except the ones cited in Vedic texts, in the sense of house, in classical language, is to be looked for. Anyhow, it cannot be a "dvandva" compound (as noted in the राजदन्तादि group, in the sense of the two masters of house, but दमस्य पत्यौ, a "tatpurusha" compound with the substitution of दम् for the word दम not recognized by grammar.

  

This was the purpose of the query raised by the member. Why not the word "दम्पती" cannot be derived from the word "दम" with the meaning as two masters of the house, i.e. husband and wife as recorded in the lexicon (modern) cited in my post. Any answer from Paninian grammar for the question raised? It can be a case of archaic usage Vedic occurrences, (if the case demands obligatorily such a meaning) as the two masters of the house = husband and wife, it can be sanctioned as छान्दस, unless a singular form for it in classical language as दमस्य पतिः = दमपतिः, or दम्पतिः is attested. In respect of the meaning too this holds good. 

  

More light in this respect is solicited.  
  

Sorry for the inadvertent usage of duel for dual.

  

With regards
