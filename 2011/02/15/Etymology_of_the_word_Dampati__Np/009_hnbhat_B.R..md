The discussion is about the etymology of the compound word "दम्पती" in the masculine gender dual and the word is considered as synonym of जायापती. So in the other compound too the word जाया is considered as substituted by दम् + in compound with the same word पति as already explained by Dr. Subrahmanyam Korada:

  

> **JAyA ca patis'ca = dampatI / jampatI / jAyApatI . 'JAyAs'abdasya > jam-bhAva.h dam-bhAvas'ca nipAtyate Vikalpatvena.**

  

Both jaM and daM are considered the synonyms for the word जाया. Monier Williams takes it as substitution for the word दम which means wife in this case (specially noted) as can be seen in the portion quoted from the Dictionary. That was to point for discussion why it could not be derived from दम itself in compound being substituted by दम् with पतिmeaning two masters of the house.
