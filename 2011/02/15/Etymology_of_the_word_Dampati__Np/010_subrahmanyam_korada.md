If we say that 'dam' and 'jam' are synonyms it means differently -- they are independent words and can be used as replacement to 'jaya'  
just like 'amarA nirjarA devA.h' .  
  
-- jam and dam are just substitutes if and only if - the word jayA' is followed by the word 'pati' in a DvandvasamAsa .  
  
They are not synonyms , i.e. cannot be employed independently or in any other context .  
  
This is what is meant by 'dambhAva' and 'jambhAva' (untranslatable ) .  
  
The conclusion is that a S'astra has to be learnt / discussed face to face and translation is not cent per cent authoritative .
