***Respected scholars,***

***I am distressed to note that even highly learned scholars who have studied Sanskrit, English, Comparatitive Philology, History and other subjects so well are indulging in deductions (and thus arguements) without considering the correct chronology.***

***It is like comparing a 111 years old senile man who is a great scholar, but now unable to recall any thing and a bright 11 years old boy who is enthusiastically learning to become a great scholar. For example most of us still believe that Mahapadmananda was a contemporary of Alexander and Chandragupta Mourya married the daughter of Selucus; where as in fact Chandragupta Mourya was dead some 1200 years before Alexander.***

***For your ready reference I am attaching a brief write up on chronology.***

***I earnestly request you to please read it and send me your comments. If you feel the views expressed in the write up are silly and wrong, ****please feel free to write so.***

***Eagerly waiting for your comments,***

***Yours truly,***

***D D Misra
