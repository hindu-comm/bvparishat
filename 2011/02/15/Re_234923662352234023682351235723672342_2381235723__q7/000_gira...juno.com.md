Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



No need for saving Sanskrit



Many Indian scholars of Sanskrit and foreign scholars of Sanskrit believe that Sanskrit is one of the languages of Indo-European family. Many believe that PIE was mother of all languages of this family.It is few Indians claim all the time that other languages of the world came from Sanskrit without giving proofs. Unless and until foreign scholars of comparative philology and proponents of PIE comeforward and present proof that it was Vedic or Sanskrit was mother of at least of all languages of Indo-European family, there is no use of Indians running here and there to save Sanskrit.Here we claim big status for Sanskrit and a foreign scholar along with his Indian disciples come forward to present contradictory evidence. If one would like to glorify oneself unilaterally, then it is OK. There is nothing special in Sanskrit from the point of view of modern linguistics except complicated grammar. That why people of India have changed Sanskrit into many other easy grammar languages. Now everybody is running after English which is the language of glorified IT professionals in India. Please do not tell me that Sanskrit is divine. Arabs think Arabian is divine. One more point. Can you show me the proof that Sanskrit was not changed from 1500 BC to 500 BC (the time of PaNini)? Outside scholars say it is changed. Who is right? Show me proof. The Principle of Least Action on the part of language users always works. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
