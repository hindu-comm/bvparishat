Dear Prof. Aklujkar



I am not an absolutist in the matter of ethics or maybe, even faith, for that matter, yet at the same time am keenly aware of the slippery slope of making the ends justify the means. I don't want this to sound personal, but maybe presence or absence of personal gain alonedoes not determine the dhArmikatA or otherwise of an action: what if a Sanskrit-hater suggests that your svArtha extends to the entire Sanskrit-knowing community? Such svArtha is quite possible since the I-ness extends to the body-mind-intellect complex ordinarily and to the entire car when one is driving (as seen in the expressions, 'I was hit in the rear') - in this case it could easily extend to the entire Sanskrit-knowing community. This is the essence of one accusation against Indology departments in American and Eurepean universities. And in many cases, personal gain is indeed a vaild goal.



Regarding the right way of protecting the interests of Sanskrit, within the Census framework:



First I would like to bring two peices of data to attention:

a\) as per Census 2001 (<http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.htm>), 14,135 declared Sanskrit as their mother tongue - there are only 4 other languages had been declared as their mother tongue by fewer persons:Chakhesang (the language of three tribes in Nagaland), Simte (spoken mainly in South Manipur, also in Myanmar, Mizoram and parts of Assam), Afghani/Pushto and Persian. I am unable to get the reference right away, but when I last looked at these figures, 10,000 was the cut-off mark to be listed as a language. Yet, Sanskrit is a 'Scheduled Language'. Thenext language in the 8th Schedule of the constitution, which was declared as a mother tongue bythe fewestwas Bodo with some 13.5 lakh.

b)as per the Census tables (<http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement7.htm>), there were 2,212persons who declared Sanskrit as their mother tongue in 1971; 6,106 in 1981; and 49,736 in 1991.Suddenly it fell to 14,135 in 2001. What is at work here? Another such campaign in 1991? These things show up at themacro level.



Based on the above, what we can gather is that the importance given to Sanskrit is dis-proportionate to the number of speakers, maybebecause Sanskrit is the basis for the vocabulary in almost all major Indian languages except Tamil, Urduand Kashmiri and maybeBodo and Dogri. In fact the word we have in Telugu for 'vocabulary' is 'dhAtupushTi'. Such an angle - that Sanskrit is required to strengthen and rejunevate Indian languages is the more honest and effective angle to take in protecting the interests of Sanskrit.



Regarding the email, it is quite in order when it issent to the

i\) Professors inSanskritDepartments at Universities. We have nearly 500Universities in India - at least 300 have a Skt Dept? x 4 Professors = 1,200?

ii\) Lecturers in Sanskrit in Degree Colleges. Nearly 18,000 degree colleges - 3,000 offering Skt? - 4,500 lecturers?

iii)Teachersof Sanskrit in Schools. 3.2 lakh+secondary schools in 2007-08as per this document of Govt. of India:<http://education.nic.in/AR/AR2009-10/AR2009-10.pdf>, p327 - of which at least some 32,000 schools teach Sanskrit? So another 32,000 Sanskrit teachers?

iv\) Vedic Scholars. AP alone has 350+ certified (by TTD mostly)Vedic Pandits - maybe there would be 1,000 kramAntasvAdhyAyis in AP - So, say around 10,000 in the country?



This way we get about 47,700 - possibly many more - who can legitimately claimto, and who ought to, know Sanskrit very well.



A different way to look at the number who could possibly know Sanskrit very well is:



v\) All those with Ph. Ds.in Sanskrit (I remeber seeing a list 7,000+Ph. D thesistitlesin India - most of the scholars should still be alive)

vi\) All those with MA degrees in the 100+ departments have been offering Sanskrit MA for the last 50 years - Osmania University alone would have graduated 50 x 20 = 1,000 scholars in the last 50 years; there might be at least 50 to 60 such universities out there?



This way about 50,000 - 60,000 have some serious post graduate education in India.



We can also make one more justification - that this list would anyhow reach only those in the above categories. Either way such a quailfication would make it the right way to about it.



While I write this (male, married, 40 years, Hyderabad, a full time student of MA, Sanskritand a businessman), I am acutely aware of the gulf of difference in the power I yield and the other tenured Professors on this list yield and that they could do much more with a single signature thanwhat I could do in ten years. So, I write this in humility and with an anxiety to avoid arm-chair criticism.Even so, fudging Censusdata deliberatelyis wrong; ensuring that the truestate is reflected in the Census is quite alright.
