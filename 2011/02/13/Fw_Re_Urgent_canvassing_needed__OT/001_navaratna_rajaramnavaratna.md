 Why should Sanskrit be gone? I see more interest today than in my student days. all one had to do was attend the Sanskrit book fair in Bangalore a month ago. There was no room even to stand.



 This "Sanskrit in danger" is the cry being raised by Western academics like Witzel and Sheldon Pollock to get money for their sinking Indology (including Sanskrit) programs.



 Why should they be rescued? Is Sanskrit worth saving if it needs to keep these departments alive. If Indians cannot keep their classical language alive, Westerners won't do it for them. These scare tactics are meant to save themselves, not Sanskrit.
