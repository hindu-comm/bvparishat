Doesn't truth have a place anymore? I can understand some sections sacrificing truth to push their interests, we have even come to expect such behaviour; but a forum of Sanskrit scholars doing the same is an altogether different matter. The scholars here know dharma too well, there is no need toopen a discussion onthat. This is simply not the right way of protecting the interests of Sansrkit.
