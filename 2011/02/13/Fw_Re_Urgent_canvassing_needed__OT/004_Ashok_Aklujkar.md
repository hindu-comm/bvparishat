Dear Shri Siva Senani,

  

Before I decided to help with the initiative, the question you have raised occurred to me too. 

  

My response to the initiative that reached me would have been different (a) if the Census question had sought to find out all the languages the prospective respondent knew, (b) if there had been a clarification that no language will be delisted as a language (i.e., declared dead) if the number of persons knowing it fell below a certain level, (c) if there had been assurance that the 'number argument' will never be used against Sanskrit, (d) if the possible loss coming from our inaction would not have been so great as to affect India's unique identity, and (e) if the actions of the Government so far had been such as to inspire confidence that it indeed was committed to enabling Indian languages to withstand the pressure of English. 

  

Yes, some Indians may be bending the truth a little bit when they report that they know Sanskrit well. Some may fuzz the distinctions between knowing a language well in terms of reading, writing and/or speaking and knowing a language well as inherent in their mother tongue. To that extent, the Census figures coming after the initiative's success will not reflect reality or will not reflect it very precisely. This would ethically be a serious matter if it resulted in depriving some other language of its rightful place. It is obvious that, given the history of India's education in the last sixty-odd years, the number of persons who will put English as their first or second language will be far ahead of those who will do the same for Sanskrit. Thus, as i see it, the intention behind the effort is the non-aggressive one of ensuring that Sanskrit does not come down so much as to not get even the 'breathing space' in which something could be done for its survival. (A census is done only once every ten years. Decisions based on its statistics cannot be undone for a long time.)

  

The question you have raised is not only a reminder of dharmasya tattva.m nihita.m guhaayaam but also of what democracy can do and cannot do (how its dependence on numbers allows the average to smother excellence, that is, something good for a society) and also of whether there can ever be a context-free, absolute ethic ('speak truth even if doing so leads to a loss of the very thing for which truth was accepted as a value'). If the intention of Vyaasa or Sm.rti authors was to uphold the "absolute ethics' view, they would not have qualified the sentence satya.m bruuyaat with priya.m bruuyaat or given us the notion of aapad-dharma. The criterion to be applied, I think, is to make sure that one is not going against an ethical value for personal gain. The initiative suggested meets that criterion as far as I know.

  

If you are not an upholder of absolutism in ethics, what criterion did you apply when you declared, "This is simply not the right way of protecting the interests of Sansrkit"?

  

Suppose we did nothing in the Census, do we have altrnative ways and sources that would right the resulting unwelcome situation **\*definitely and without involving any compromise with ethics\***r? (I assume that yad bhaavi tad bhavatu is not your view.)
