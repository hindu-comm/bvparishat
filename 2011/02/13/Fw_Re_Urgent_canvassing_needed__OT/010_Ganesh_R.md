> ***1) A section of the people (officially declared as Hindus and some > of them facing enquiry for false caste/tribe certificates) in > Kandhamal district of Orissa have been specifically instructed by > their revered priests to put English as their mother tongue (first > language) even though they do not know English at all. I do not see > any reason why such an instruction should have been given only in > Kandhamal district of Orissa. Therefore I believe (though I have no > information) that such instructions must have been given to many more > sections of people in different parts of India and it is being done > secretly.

> ***2) A few groups of people (including those mentioned in item 1 > above) have been been specificaally advised to omit Sanskrit from the > list of 4 (four) languages they know, even if they have read it in the > school. I do not know how the number 4 (four) is significant, because > I am told that in the census you are required to state only three (3) > languages.*** ***Urdu has been suggested as one of the 4 (four) > languages though it has not been formally taught.******I would like to > add that in Orissa schools 4 (four) languages are taught, namely > Oriya, English, Hindi and Sanskrit (in that order of importance).*** >
