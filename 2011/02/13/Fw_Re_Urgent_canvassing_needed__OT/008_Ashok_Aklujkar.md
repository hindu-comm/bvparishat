Dear Shri Siva Senani,

Thank you for a beautifully written argument backed by considerable study and constructive thought. You have written in a nuanced way that is rarely noticed in discussion lists.

Some of the facts you mention were generally known to me (e.g., how the number of persons who gave Sanskrit as their mother tongue changed from one census to another). But you added much precision to them. Thanks for this as well.

You write: \>that Sanskrit is required to strengthen and rejunevate \[--> rejuvenate\] Indian languages is the more honest and effective angle to take in protecting the interests of Sanskrit.\<

I agree. Cf. the last two paragraphs ("Over the last sixty years ..." and "With Sanskrit wiped out ...") of my very first email on the matter. The anonymous Marathi message which prompted my action did not make this point. I added it, because I recognize its importance and practical power. That I have thought about it for a long time should be clear from another post I hope to be able to send in the near future. On 13 February, however, the frame for my thinking was the impending Census stage.

I do not disagree with your determination, at the end of your post, of what is right and what is wrong. This, I hope, is indicated by my second post on the matter. I am also aware of the danger of getting into a situation in which one begins to use the ends to justify the means. However, I thought that some deviation was justified. You did not think so. Could this not be due to my estimation that the situation called for aapad-dharma, whereas you did not arrive at the same estimation? I see a crisis of national proportions in the current state of India's languages. Further, while I do not know for sure how seriously the Census statistics are taken by the bureaucracy and the ministers, I do see a trend toward taking them more and more seriously (probably as a consequence of the increasing availability of powerful computers). I also consider it alarming that a few years ago a Central Government minister could even make a remark to the effect that Sanskrit was irrelevant for modern India. (I assume the newspapers concerned reported correctly.) As I do not live in India as much as you do and as my sources may not be as widespread as yours, I could very well be wrong in the estimation on the basis of which I proceeded. Please feel free to correct me.
