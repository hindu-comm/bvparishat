Dear Scholar Friends

Hari Om



Chinmaya International Foundation Shodha Sansthan (CIFSS) is a research centre, affiliated to Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan (Deemed University established under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India), New Delhi, under the Scheme of Adarsha Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya/Shodha Sansthan. The objective of the scheme is to support and promote traditional Sanskrit learning and research especially on Sanskrit Studies and Manuscriptology. This is also recognized by Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam and Indira Gandhi National Open University, New Delhi. CIF Shodha Sansthan is a leading centre for advanced learning in Sanskrit and Indology in India with a good academic environment.



It is well known that Sanskrit is the most ancient, classical, scientific language. Studying Sanskrit gives light to ancient as well as modern science and technology. Many research activities being done in the field of Sanskrit and innovative outputs are coming up in day to day life. In the World and Oriental Sanskrit Conferences, new ideas and research methodologies are emerged from different disciplines of Sanskrit. In the upcoming 15th World Sanskrit Conference of New Delhi, 2012, Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan is going to bring out several volumes of state-wise **Directory of Sanskrit Institutions/Colleges/Pathashalas in India.**



These volumes will help the scholars, researchers, administrators for their official and academic purposes as well. All information related to the college/Institution will be included along with academics. After compilation of the information, the directory will be published and released in the World Sanskrit Conference and put it in the web for public.



RSKS has entrusted to Chinmaya International Foundation Shodha Sansthan for collecting information Sanskrit Institutions of Kerala and Tamil Nadu states. Therefore I am sending herewith the **questionnaire** for getting the details of institution/college/university. I would like to request you to fill up each column with necessary details and send it to the following address before 31st March 2011, so that we can compile and make it in the form of a directory. Soft copy can also be sent through email.



(**Kindly see the attached proforma and Iwould like to request to pass
the mail and proforma to all Sanskrit colleges, Vidyalayas,Pathashalas and Sanskrit Institutions of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.)**
