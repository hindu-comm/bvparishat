The Union Finance Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee has ear marked 100  
Crore for Aligarh Muslim University for their upcoming Centres in  
Murshidabad in West Bengal and Malappuram in Kerala and a whopping 200  
Crore for Maulana Azad Education foundation.  
  
While Aligarh University got 50 crore each for itâ€™s two centres to  
promote Arabic and Islamic studies there were no mention about any  
funds to popularize Sanskrit. The discrimination is more visible when  
Pranab da earmarks only 10 crore for setting up Kolkata and Allahabad  
centres of Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya, Wardha.
