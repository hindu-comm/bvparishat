Dear Mr Das,

I already read the Sankarabhasya on the Isavasyopanisad and its English translation by swami Gambhirananda \[Ramakrisna Mission\].My problem is that what the following mantra means :

Andham tamah pravisanti ye asambhutim upasate.

Tato bhuya iva te tamoya u sambhutyam ratah //ISA-12//

Swami ji translates the view of Sankara and writes :

Those who worship the unmanifested(prakriti) enter into blinding
darkness; but those who are devoted to the manifested (hiranyagarbha)
enter into greater darkness.

Here the problem arises :

1,what is the import of the worship of asambhuti-avyakrita \[ unmanifest\] prakriti and sambhuti- karyabrahma\[ hiranyagarbha \].Hiranyagarbha is mentioned in hiranygarbha Sukta too where it means
a huge form of paramatma as

Hiranyagarbhah samavartataagre bhutasya jaatah patir eka aasit.

.In this way hiranyagarbha has two meanings. what import should be taken here as authentic?.

2.what is the system of said worships of avyakrita prakriti and
sambhuti ?

In haste I could not use diacritics.

Dr.Jha.  
To begin with we must know the definition of Sambhuti and Asumbhati. Asumbhati implies KARANA( the causal element) OR Prakriti,wheras Sambhuti implies KARYA. Since it's KARYA ,it is liable to be creation/production or dissolution/destruction.  
Thus according to this mantra from Isa Upanishad --  
  
If a person worships or adores asumbhati he would be entering into the darkness(i.e Andham Tama Prabishabti) of ignorance.  
  
If a person worships or adores Sambhuti he would be entering into even more( i.e Tatu bhuo eba te tama) darkness of ignornace.  
  
In fact this sloka implies te difference in approach betwee Karya and Karana. Too much reliance on Karya ( the other name of Vidya or Upasana of Gods) would lead to a more disastrous consequence than Karana or asumbhati, the worship of which leads us to a state of relative Moksha.( whereas worship of Sambhuti can at best help us overcome death.) This is reflectied in the very next sloka of Isa Upanishad, which says---  
  
Vinashen Mrityum Tirtya AsunbhatimAmrtyamUshnate.  
  
This word Vinashen implies Karya i.e Sambhuti.  
  
  
Thanking You, ALAKENDU DAS.
