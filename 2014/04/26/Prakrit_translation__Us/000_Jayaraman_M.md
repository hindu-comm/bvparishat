Dear Friends  
  

I have an ancient Sanskrit Drama. Sanskrit Chaya has to be provided to prakrit passages of the drama. I am looking for a prakrit-Sanskrit scholar who can help me in this. Appropriate monetary compensation will also be provided. Your help will be greatly valued.  
  
regards  

Jayaraman
