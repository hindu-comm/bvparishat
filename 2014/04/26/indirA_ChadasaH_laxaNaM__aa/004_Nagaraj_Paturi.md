1\. This is a member of Trishtup group which comprises of all the 11 Syllable meters.



2\. Within the pattern \|\|\| S\|S S\|S \|S the break/pause (विरति) is after the first two GaNas (feet). i.e. III SIS- SIS IS is the pattern.



3\. This is one of those meters which runs like मात्रिक while in fact being वर्णिक.



4\. The singing pattern is आरोहण in the first half III SIS न न न ना न नाandअवरोहण in the second half SIS IS ना न ना न ना.



5\. It sounds like मात्रिक because the first half and second half are 8 Matras each. Also if split as III SIS and SI SIS, the मात्रिक pattern is 3+5, 3+5 too. i.e. त्रिस्र +खंड, त्रिस्र + खंड. त कि ट +त क त कि ट , त कि ट +त क त कि ट.



6\. What is very interesting about both the pieces गोपीगीत? and श्रीभार्गवराघवीयम् is that the pattern of "the two parts of a foot (line?) (पाद?)beginning with the same consonant, the second syllable of all four feet (lines?) (पादाः?)in a verse has the same consonant" which is being considered as a feature of चित्रकवित्व is a prosodical rule for not only this meter but all the Sanskrit-borrowed meters in *Telugu*.



7\. There are several bhajan like Stotras for Guruvayur Appan and Swami Ayyappa in this meter sung in maatrik tal style.
