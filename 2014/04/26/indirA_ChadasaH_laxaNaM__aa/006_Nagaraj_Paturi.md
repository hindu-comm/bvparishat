Poojya Nityananda mishraji,



Namaskar,



There was no difference of opinion on my part with regard to Gopigita or Gopigita being part of Bhagavata. My question mark was to check whethermy spelling (particularly the number एकवचनorबहुवचन) was correct. Thereferences provide confirm एकवचन.



Second is also not a difference of opinion at all. It is certainly चित्रकवित्व only in श्रीमद्भागवतम.



I was providing information to all thescholar-fraternityabout prosodical rules in the Telugu literature. I was informing that these two aspects :

1\. the two parts of a line beginning with the same consonant and

2\. the second syllable of all the four lines of averse having the same consonant



are rules to be followed when a versifier versifies in Telugu in meters borrowed from Sanskrit.



3\. Thanks for all the alternative names of the meter Indira.



4\. It was PuNya-giving to hear/watch Gurudeva's तादात्म्यभरित भक्तिरसात्मक rendering of the meter.



5\. To render a वर्णच्छंद in rhythmic form is the most interesting part. I was trying to show how some of the वर्णच्छंद such as this onehavethe quality of the मात्राच्छंद.
