I would like to join Sri Mishraji in thanking Shatavadhani Sri Ganesh Ragaji.



Sri Ganeshji aptly mentioned 'Vadi' of Telugu and Kannada. 'Praasa' is the word for the feature of consonant in thesecond syllable of all the four lines being the same. For example one can say that Mishraji followed णकारप्रासाin the गणपतिस्तुति.



Vadi is followed for both the native Telugu/Kannada meters and Sanskrit borrowed meters whereas Praasa is followed only for the Sanskrit-borrowed meters.



As a मात्राच्छंदः the same rhythm as in Indira can be found in SI SIS -SI SIS आरोहण: ना न ना न ना अवरोहण:ना न ना न नाalso. But then as a वर्णच्छंदःthis turns into SIS ISS ISI Sर य ज ग .But then it goes into पंक्ति group.



Non-rhythmic swinging beauties such as मंदाक्रांतः and rhythmic longer beauties such as कविराजविराजितम् are equally enjoyed by Sloka-singers. Each variety has its own beauty.



Thanks again,



Nagaraj
