गोपीगीत is the name of the 31st chapter of the 10th canto of the भागवतम्, given by भागवतकार himself. Please see the first snapshot attached.  
  
I do not think the चित्रकवित्व features are part of the prosodical rule, as they are not used in all the verses.  
  
The name ललित for the metre and वंशीधर's citation of the prosodic rule which I mentioned can be seen in the two snapshots.  
  
These are from the edition of SB with multiple commentaries published by Bhagavata Vidyapeetha, Sola, Ahmedabad.
