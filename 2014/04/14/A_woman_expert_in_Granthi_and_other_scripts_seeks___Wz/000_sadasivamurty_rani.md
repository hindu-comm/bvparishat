Respected members,

One of our woman-students who obtained her Ph.D., and M.Ed., Degrees from our Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha is now staying in Visakhapatnam. She is conversant with Granthi and other ancient scripts. She has a good knowledge in Sanskrit and computers. 

Long ago I saw a posting in BVParishat seeking assisting hands for computerizing MSS. by offering online service.

As her husband has settled in Visakhapatnam she cannot move from that city but she can offer online service in computerising any Manuscripts on worthy remuneration. .

If any institution or individuals are interested to avail her such services please let me know and I shall introduce her to them.

With Warm Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
