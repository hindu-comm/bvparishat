In the PanchadashI (6th chapter) of Swami Vidyaranya we have this verse/s:

  

``` upAdAne vinaShTe.api kShaNa.n kAryaM pratIkShyate . ityAhustArkikAstadvadasmAka.n ki.n na sambhavet .. 54.. ```

``` tantUnA.n dinasa.nkhyAnA.n taistAdR^ik{}kShaNa IritaH . bhramasyAsa.nkhyakalpasya yogyaH kShaNa iheShyatAm .. 55.. ```

``` ```

``` The context of the above verses and the meaning of the two verses can be seen here: ```

52. That the superimposition causing the identity of 'I' and 'Self' is caused by nescience has already been treated. When this nescience is negated, its effect is also terminated.  
  
53. The veiling of the real nature of the Self and the identity superimposition, are caused by nescience, and they are destroyed when nescience is negated. But so long as the fructifying Karma continues, the mind and body, the effects of illusory projection of nescience, continue.  
  
54. The logicians hold that when the material cause of an object has been destroyed its effect continues to appear for the next moment. Similarly why cannot the body of a knower of truth persist for some time when its cause, the nescience, has been destroyed ?  
  
55. According to the logicians the cloth keeps its form for the next second - the threads (its material cause) that last for a few days are destroyed. On the same reasoning, the body may persist for a proportionately long time when its cause, the ignorance of countless ages, is destroyed.  
  

``` 56. (Doubt): The logicians have assumed the truth of this theory without any proof. (Reply): We assume it on the ground of Shruti, experience and reasoning; why should it be improper ? ```

``` ```

``` warm regards ```
