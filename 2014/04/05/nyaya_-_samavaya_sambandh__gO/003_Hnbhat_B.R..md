Very good Doubt for a Vedantin. Every Darshana has got their own authorities and all follow their own logic. There is not any doubt for them in their followers. Why should others' blame unless one want's to blame others? Nyaya accepts Ishvara and it is pramaNa for them also according to Shruti. Not by itself, it is accepted because of Sarvajna, of Ishvara, the Aptavakya. Why should Vedantin's should accept their stand? They have their own standard of Pramana to judge. There should not be any discussion on propriety or impropriety. The प्रमाण accepted and their acceptance forms the validity of the PramaNa in their School. There is no rule that it should be proper for others or their validity accepted by others. The same holds good in respect of other schools also, for a neutral observer.
