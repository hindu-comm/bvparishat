Namaste,  
  

Sarpas are not necessarily Nagas. Vasuki, who gave out the poison during the Samudramanthna was a snake. As the story goes he later on, to escape from the wrath of Garuda, took the shelter of Lord Shiva and that is how he came to adorn the neck of Lord Shiva.. On the other hand Ananta is non-poisonous and Lord Vishnu lies on him as his bed. Laksmana and Balarama are considered to be the avataras of Ananta.  
  

Sincerely
