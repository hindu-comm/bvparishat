किमुद्दुष्टमिति न स्पष्टतया न ज्ञातम्। तथापि श्रीशंकराचार्यवचसि प्रामाण्यं स्वीक्रियते, अथवा स्तोत्रवचांसि प्रमाणत्वेन स्वीक्रियते चेत्, षडक्षरस्तोत्रे वासुकेः शिवस्य कण्ठभूषणत्वेनोपवर्णनं दृश्यते।

  

वाहनं वृषभोयस्य *वासुकिः कण्ठभूषणम्* ।

वामे शक्तिधरं देवं वकाराय नमोनमः ॥ 5  

  

इममेवोल्लेखं

 मनसि निधाय, भवता पुराणं प्रमाणमन्विष्टं चेत्, तत्र न लब्धमेव।

  

शिवषडक्षरीस्तॊत्रम् आचार्यशङ्करकृत-मिति श्रूयते।

  

शिवपञ्चाक्षरीस्तोत्रे

 च,

  

नागेन्द्रहाराय त्रिलोचनाय भस्मांगरागाय महेश्वराय। नित्याय शुद्धाय दिगम्बराय तस्मै न काराय नम: शिवाय ॥1॥  

  

वासुकिरेव नागेन्द्रत्वेन वर्णित इति भाति, न तु शेषो वा तक्षको वा।

मूलं तु स्वयं मृग्यता

मनयोः

स्तोत्रयोः प्रामाण्ये।



  

कम्बरामायणानुसारेण, वासुकिः शिवस्य कङ्कणत्वमभजत इति वर्ण्यते।

  

If you know English,

here is the extract of context in Kambaramayana, where Vasuki became bangle कंकण of शिव as given in Puranic Encyclopedia, if you know English:

  

3\) The length of Vāsuki. The Devas and the asuras

decided to get Amṛta (Ambrosia--the celestial honey of

immortalily) by churning the sea of milk. The Devas

went to bring Mandara-mountain, to be used as the

churning rod. Their attempt was futile. The asuras

made a trial with the same result. The Bhūtagaṇas

(Guards) of Śiva also made a vain attempt. On the

instruction of Viṣṇu, Garuḍa went and brought the

mountain as easily as an eagle takes away a frog. Now

Vāsuki should be brought. The Devas and Gandharvas

failed in that attempt also. Garuḍa who was haughty

of his strength and speed, went to the city of the nāgas

(serpents) and requested Vāsuki to come to the sea of

Milk. Vāsuki replied that if the matter was so urgent

he had no objection for being carried to that place. He

took the middle part of Vāsuki in his beak and flew up

higher and higher and reached beyond the horizon.

Still the lower half of Vāsuki was lying on the ground.

So he took Vāsuki in his beak as folded in two. Still

the result was the same. Garuḍa became aware of the

impossibility of carrying Vāsuki and returned, ashamed

and disappointed. Viṣṇu rebuked him for his arrogance.

After this, Śiva stretched his hand to Pātāla. Vāsuki

became a small bangle on that hand. Thus Vāsuki was

brought to the shore of the sea of Milk. (Kamba

Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
