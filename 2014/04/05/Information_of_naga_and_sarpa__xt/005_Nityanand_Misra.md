I don't know of Purāṇic references, but some medieval works in Prākṛta suggest that Śeṣa adorns the chest of Śiva.  
  
Here is the first reference from the Ayodhyākāṇda of Rāmacaritamānasa (1574–1576 CE) -  
वामाङ्गे च विभाति भूधरसुता देवापगा मस्तके  
भाले बालविधुर्गले च गरलं यस्योरसि व्यालराट्।  
सोऽयं भूतिविभूषणः सुरवरः सर्वाधिपः सर्वदा  
शर्वः सर्वगतः शिवः शशिनिभः श्रीशङ्करः पातु माम्॥  
  
व्यालराट् is itnerpreted as Śeṣa in several commentaries including Bhāvārthabodhinī. I will check Mānasapīyūṣa, Siddhāntatilaka, Vijayānandī and the commentary by Jvālāprasāda Miśra and confirm the interpretation there.  
  
The second reference is even more clear in identifying Śeṣa as Śiva's adornment, it is the 200th verse of the Bhaktamāla (circa 1600 CE) -  
  
कबिजन करत बिचार बड़ो कोउ ताहि भनिज्जै।  
कोउ कह अवनि बड़ी जगत आधार फनिज्जै॥  
सो धारी सिर सेस सेस सिव भूषन कीनो।  
सिव आसन कैलास भुजा भरि रावन लीनो॥  
रावन जीत्यो बालि पुनि बालि राम इक सर दड़े।  
अगर कहै त्रैलोक में हरि उर धारैं ते बड़े॥  
  
Quick translation (cannot capture the beauty of the original though) - "The wise thought and opined who in their view is the greatest. Somebody said Pṛthvī is the greatest, as she bears the whole world. Somebody else said as Śeṣa bears Pṛthvī on His head, Śeṣa is the greatest. Then somebody said Śeṣa was borne as an ornament by Śiva, so Śiva is the greatest. Then somebody said Śiva is borne by His seat Kailāsa, so Kailāsa is the greatest. Then somebody said Rāvaṇa bore Kailāsa in his arms, so Rāvaṇa is the greatest. Then somebody said Bālī defeated Rāvaṇa, so Bālī is the greatest. Then somebody said, Bālī was felled by Rāma using a single arrow, so Rāma is the greatest. Finally, Agradāsa said that Bhaktas who bear Hari (Rāma) in their heart are the greatest."
