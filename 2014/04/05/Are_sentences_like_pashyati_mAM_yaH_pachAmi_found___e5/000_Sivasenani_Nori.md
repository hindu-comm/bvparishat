While reading a paper by Prof. Paul Kiparsky ("Architecture of Panini's Grammar" in G. Huet, A. Kulkarni, and P. Scharf (Eds.): Sanskrit Computational Linguistics 2007/2008, LNAI 5402, pp. 33–94, 2009), I came across the following sentence (numbered 63 on page 55) (Extract given below the the email):

  

पश्यति मां यः पचामि

  

(The intended sense is: यः पचति, सः अहम्, मां च पश्यति (देवदत्तः)।)

  

Prof. Kiparsky invokes (not in so many words, but by way of summarization) the three rules

  

1.4.105 युष्मद्युपपदे समानाधिकरणे स्थानिन्यपि मध्यमः॥

1.4.107 अस्मद्युत्तमः ॥

1.4.108 शेषे प्रथमः ॥

  

to justify the cited sentence. According to him "If the verb ending expresses the role of a ﬁrst or second person pronoun, itis ﬁrst or second person, otherwise it is third person." (Rule No. 61, p54). I can follow how the above follows from the sutras, but am not sure that this applies in the sentence quoted.

  

The best proof is the existence of such sentences in usage. I request the learned members of BVP to let me know if sentences of the sort पश्चति मां यः पचामि are to be found in literature or Sastra-granthas as udaaharaNas.

‘He sees me, who am cooking’

The “subject” is the third person relative pronoun ya- “who”, but, as rule \[61\] predicts, the verb in fact agrees with the head of the relative clause, in this case with aham “I”. Any rule specifying agreement in terms of subjects would have to be supplemented to get ﬁrst or second person agreement here. P¯an.ini’s rule, however, covers this situation directly. In \[63\], the verb is coindexed \[1\] with both aham “I” (ﬁrst person) and with yah. “who” (third person), and ﬁrst person verb agreement is correctly enforced as before.

  

\[1\] Co-indexed means having samaanaadhikaraNa, as Prof. Kiparsky uses the term.
