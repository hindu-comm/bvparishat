Namaste,

  

I heard about a research paper on the subject of shades of differences in meaning between "vibhAShA, vA, vikalpa, bahulam, and anyatarasyAM" in pANinIya vyAkaraNa. I do not remember the author or exact title or any other details about the paper. Would anyone kindly share any information about any paper/article on such a subject?
