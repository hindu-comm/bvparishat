Namaste,  
  
The word "Asad" has been misinterpreted by many. The Veda itself says that "Sad" came form "Asad" and there is nothing unholy about "Asad". The very appearance of "Sad" is due to the role of Maya (the Svetasvatara Upanishad says Maya is the Prkriti). The great Shankara's Mayavada teaching is that the appearance of the "Sad" is due to the role of Maya and the Brahman is Sakshi-roopa Sadasad-viheena. The Vedantin's effort is to realize this great truth and transcend the "Maya". This concept appears somewhat abstract to a non-Shankarite
