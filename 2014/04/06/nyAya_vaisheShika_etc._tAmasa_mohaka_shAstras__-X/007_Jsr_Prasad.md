Wonderful comment. Bhakti, like jñāna, is one of the paths to self realization.  
  
None of these paths are necessary further, when one realizes like - भिद्यते हृदयग्रन्थिश्छिद्यन्ते सर्वसंशया: । क्षीयन्ते चाऽस्य कर्माणि तस्मिन् दृष्टे परावरे ।। (मुंडक 2.2.8). But, we also need vyavahāra, since most of us live in the mundane life. Considered tāmasika or otherwise, Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika are more at this level to sharpen our inert intellect to understand the true reality. Schools like Nyāya etc. kept alive the vāda tradition, for ages together, contributing to a great corpus of jñāna. An anecdote about Udayana, a great scholar of Nyāya, is really interesting. Once he went to pay the obeisance to lord Jagannath at Puri. Testing his endurance, Jagannatha closed the doors of sanctum sanctorum. Annoyed and anguished, Udayana recited a verse - ऐश्वर्यमदमत्तोऽसि मामवज्ञाय प्रवर्तसे । उपस्थितेषु **बौद्धेषु** मदधीना तव स्थितिः ।। So, he himself proclaimed that, he was the savior of sanātanadharma from the clutches of Buddhists. At some other point, the same Udayana (I hope!) reiterates the significance of Nyāya as follows - मोहं रुणद्धि विपुलीकुरुते च बुद्धिं सूते च संस्कृतपदव्यवहारशक्तिम् । शास्त्रान्तराऽभ्यसनयोग्यतया युनक्ति तर्कश्रमो न कुरुते कमिहोपकारम् ।। Thanks to Sri Subramanian ji for bringing forth an interesting piece.
