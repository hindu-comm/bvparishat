I came across the following as said in the Padma purana:

Rudra said:  
O goddess, listen. I shall tell you about the vicious texts in a sequence. By merely remembering them even the wise ones would be deluded. First I myself proclaimed the Shaiva, Paasupata (texts) etc. Hear about the ones which were proclaimed by the braahmanas into whom my power had entered, after that: Kanaada proclaimed the great  
Vasheshika text. (padma puraaNa, uttara-khaNDa, 236.2-4)

//Lord Shiva replied, "O goddess, please listen. In sequence I shall tell you about the tamasic texts. Simply by remembering them even wise persons become deluded. First,I Myself proclaimed the Shiva, pasupata, and related texts. After my power had entered him, Kanada preached the Vaisesika Philosophy. Similarly, Gautama preached Nyaya,and Kapila preached the atheistic Sankhya. Brihaspati preached the much-censured Charvaka doctrine, and Buddha proclaimed Buddhism to destroy the demons.//

  

I was told that the padmapurana also mentions that the jaimini (pUr.mI) and vyakarana shastrams are also listed as 'tAmasic and mohaka shAstras' but I did not locate that verse. In any case we have:  

  

In the Yajnavalkya smRti there is the mention of 14 vidyA sthAnam-s:

  

पुराणन्यायमीमांसाधर्मशास्त्राङ्गमिश्रिताः ।

  

वेदाः स्थानानि विद्यानां धर्मस्य च चतुर्दश ॥१.३॥  

  

I would like to know from the scholars of various shAstra-s on this group whether the vaisheshika, nyAya, etc. disciplines are admitted to be tAmasic, mohaka, and not studied therefore. Also, are these shastra-s not the ones mentioned in the 14 vidyA sthAnams? My curiosity was aroused upon seeing these widely studied disciplines are also listed a one's causing delusion, etc. Hence this jijnAsA.
