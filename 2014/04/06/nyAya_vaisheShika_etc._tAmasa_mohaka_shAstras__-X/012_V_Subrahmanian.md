The reason for their not being authentic is explained with reasoning in the URL given below:

Regarding the incompatibility of these two lines with not only Advaita as taught by Shankaracharya but the Vedanta shastra taught by Veda Vyasa too, here is an old post in this forum:

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/sDJvRaqyoys/wbtzziMBGIAJ>

  

The first highlighted line has a slightly different reading as seen in many transliterations:

  

svakarmarUpam tyAjyatvam atraiva.....

  

In the Bhagavad GItA (admitted by all as a work of Veda Vyasa) we have verses like:

  

na karamaNAmanArambhAt naiShkarmyam purusho'shnute (BG 3.4)

  

and 'naiShkarmyasiddhim paramAm sannyAsenAdhigacChati (BG.18.49)

  

And the Vedic utterances like 'na karmaNA na prajayA dhanena, tyAgenaike amRtatvamAnashuH'' (kaivalyopanishat and mahAnArAyaNopanishat) , 'nAstyakRtaH kRtena'(munDaka up.) 

  

None can succeed in mapping these two lines with Advaita and Vedanta in general.

  

Moreover, many vaiShNavas don not consider Shankaracharya to be a 'brAhmaNa' which Shiva is supposed to be saying in the above. 

  

<https://in.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/SUMADHWASEVA/conversations/messages/31539>

  

And there are debates on the 'kartRtva' of that asat shAstra' : whether it is Shiva Himself as explicitly said in the above verses, or a person in whom Shiva's ''Avesha' took place.  



  

There are several such inconsistencies across the various 'pramANa vAkyams' shown from various purANas, all of which are supposed to be authored by Veda VyAsa!! Someone showed me another classification of puranas into saattvik, etc. from another purana, maybe, the gAruDa.
While some puranas overlap, there are others which are quite contradictory in the two classifications.

There are several verses across the puranas which declare the world to be mAyA. One might have one's own interpretation of the word and that is how we have so many schools of thought, each vehemently condemning the other and holding one's own as the ''çorrect . Here is one such, from the srImadbhAgavatapurANam:

  

यदिदं मनसा वाचा चक्षुर्भ्यां श्रवणादिभिः ।  

नश्वरं गृह्यमाणं च विद्धिमायामनोमयम्।। ११-७-७ ।।  

**श्रीधर-स्वामि-टीका**-  

ननु गुणदोषाभ्यां विषमे लोके कुतः समदृष्टिः स्यामत आह –**यदिदमि**ति । मन आदिभि**र्गृह्यमाणं**मनोमयत्वान्मायेति**विद्धि**। तदपि न स्थिरं, किंतु**नश्वरं**विद्धि ।। ७ ।।

  

So, here is another ''self-contradiction' across VyAsa's own works, vyAsa declaring his own work as mAyAvadam and that it is ásacchAstram''
And one can point out verses from puranas of vyAsa himself which teach 'jivaparyoraikyam', etc. stated above.  And one can argue that such verses are not of that meaning etc. And eternally go on such debates..
