Here is a reference to the two classifications:

The two references do count 18 purana-s each but the names of the 18 differ. In the first nArada is there and not in the second. Aditya is in the second and not in the first. Shiva is missing in the second. I do not know if the nine verses in the garuda purana talk about attaining heaven, hell etc. thru those puranas. While some puranas shown asraajasika in the first classification and are therefore (a)shubhapradaaH, they become niraya-hetavaH in the second. The opposite is also seen with regard to a few puranas across the two classifications. The Padma purana itself is demoted to rAjasika status in the garuda purana.
