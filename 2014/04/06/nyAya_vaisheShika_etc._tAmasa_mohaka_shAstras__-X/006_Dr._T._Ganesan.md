If VaishiShika and Nyaaya shaastra-s are taamasic, then what about the adulatory statement  
 काणादं पाणिनीयं च सर्वशास्त्रोपकारकम् । kaaNaadaM paaNiniiyaM ca sarvashaastropakaarakam. ???  
  
The vary notion that some texts (or group of texts) are tAmasic and raajasic, etc. as held by some teachers of late has been completely demolished and refuted ably by both Appayadiikshita (in his Sivatattvaviveka, and some othrs) and by NiilakaNThadiikshita (elaborately in the introductory part of his commentary on the SivaaShTottarashatanaamastotram).
