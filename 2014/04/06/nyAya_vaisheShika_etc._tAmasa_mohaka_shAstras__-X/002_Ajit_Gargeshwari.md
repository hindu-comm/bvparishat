Never heard Sattvic, rajasic and Tamsic Shastras looks like a new classification system. Vaisheshika, NyAya are Darshans and all Darshanas have Moksha are their culminating point. I would not read or bother too much about blogs there is plenty of such material on the internet.  

I know Nyaya is studied both traditionally and in collages and universities.
