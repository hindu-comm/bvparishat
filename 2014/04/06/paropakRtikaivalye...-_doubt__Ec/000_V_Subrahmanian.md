The following verse is available on the internet:

  

**<https://tinyurl.com/pfqhh2m>**  

  

परोपकृतिकैवल्येतोलयित्वा जनार्दनः ।

  

गुर्वीमुपकृतिं मत्वाऽवतारान् दशाग्रहीत् ॥  

  

In the second line, however, there is a variation in reading:

  

गुर्वीमुपकृतिं मत्वा ह्यवतारान्दशाग्रहीत्॥  

  

I would request the scholars here to clarify which of the two is the correct reading or whether both are correct.

  

warm regards
