Thanks for posting this.

I

n the Introduction (<http://www.sanskritdocuments.org/sites/giirvaani/giirvaani/skka/skka_intro.htm>)of this document/book

it has been mentioned :

"One recent Telugu work is the cyclopedic work of late brahmashrI pAtUri sItArAmAnjaneyulu gAru, a publication of Tagore Publications. This contains a lot of info about the birthplace of the poet, showing evidence from rock edicts, temple-wall-scribings, findings of archeologists etc. This contains whole lot of bibliography, c.fs of Vedic purports, and what not."



I shall soon post some of these details here in English for the benefit of those who can not understand Telugu.



The same late brahmashrI pAtUri sItArAmAnjaneyulu gAru, has published another book with the thesis that the author of Shivamahimnastavam, Sri Pushpadantacharya is none other than Vararuchi the grammarian, one of the munitraya.



I shall soon post those details too.
