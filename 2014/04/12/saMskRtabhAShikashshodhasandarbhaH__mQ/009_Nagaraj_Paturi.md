This is a highly useful thread towards the development of a style sheet/style manual for Sanskrit and other Indian research work writing.



Central Institute of Indian Languages was trying to develop one.



Is the current discussion with reference to an already existing style manual or is it Pujya Nityananda Misraji's own upajna?



In any case,this kind of work is useful for many research students.



Thanks for the work.



Namaskar.



Nagaraj
