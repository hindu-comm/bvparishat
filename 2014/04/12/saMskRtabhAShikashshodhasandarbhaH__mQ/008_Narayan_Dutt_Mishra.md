विशिष्य श्रीमन्नित्यानन्दमहाभागेभ्यो धन्यवादा यैर्मानसस्थवचनानि शोधोद्धरणरूपेण कथम्प्रस्तोतव्यानीति वैशद्येन विज्ञापितम्।

  

Sir,I am thankful to you for helping me in this regard. I was just asking about these types of examples only (Caupai -अमिय मूरिमय चूरन चारू (मा. १/१/२)) because of unavailable numbers there but it’s your kind response that you have discussed here all the things related to quotations from मानस.

                    However, I am thinking that there is no provision to show the difference between Harigitika and Chhanda etc. Meanwhile here should be different rule, as I felt for this example of Chhanda – चिक्करिहिं दिग्गज डोल महि गिरि लोल सागर खरभरे...etc. Which is shown in your nice paper (It helped me a lot indeed)at page no. 12, I think - <http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/pdfs/NM2011RamacaritamanasaProsody.pdf> (but in my copy of Shriraamcharitamaanasa published from Gita Press, Samvat 2032, here is shown its no. – छन्द-1 before the lasting of दोहा-35 –So is it 5/35/11 or …. what is the solution?) I didn’t find same no. after this particular (Chhanda) Harigitika -मंगलकरनि कलिमलहरनि तुलसी कथा रघुनाथ की..(I found it Chhanda written here. But it is Harigitika-although it is kind of chhanda itself, thanks for clarifying this.)

 Respected Sir, Please let me enlighten about this, waiting for your kind reply.
