The citation style I proposed for RCM is something I came up on my own, based on some general principles of unambiguity (uniqueness), comprehensiveness, sequential indexing, and conciseness. Along with these general principles, the experience of citing various RCM verses in annotating, typesetting and publishing many papers and books. A good citation style need not indicate the metre (e.g. शार्दूलविक्रीडित, दोहा, श्लोक, छन्द, et cetera) of the verse(s) cited - it adds no value and makes the citation longer - this is something the prevalent RCM citation styles do, but I am not a fan of this for the reasons stated.  
  
My proposal is still in a draft stage, and I will share it when I am finished. I expect the proposal will be adapted by a published edition of RCM soon.
