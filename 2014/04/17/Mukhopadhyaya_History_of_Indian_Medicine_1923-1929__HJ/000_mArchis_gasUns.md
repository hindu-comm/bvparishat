Namaste

  

 As per Filliozat there is an interesting book and I've located it only at<http://niimh.ap.nic.in/Data/library.html>

Are there any scholars from Hyderabad connected to the library? I would love to find a way to see at least list of subjects.

13. History of Indian Medicine Vol. I Girindranath Mukhopadhyaya Bhisagacarya English University of Calcutta 1923

14. History of Indian Medicine Vol. II Girindranath Mukhopadhyaya Bhisagacarya English University of Calcutta 1926

15. History of Indian Medicine Vol. III Girindranath Mukhopadhyaya Bhisagacarya English University of Calcutta 1929

  

Thank you again,

M.G.
