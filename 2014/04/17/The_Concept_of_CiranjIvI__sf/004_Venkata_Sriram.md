The above rahasya has been mentioned in Ananda Ramayana while expounding the  
sapta-chiranjeeva rahasya and their presence in kali yuga.  
  
It is a known fact that there are 7 chiranjeevis viz.  
  
1. ashwatthAma  
2. bali  
3. vyAsa  
4. hanumAn  
5. vibhishana  
6. krupAchArya  
7. parashurAma  
  
All the above 7 are chiranjeevis in kali yuga. But the secret expounded in Ananda Ramayana is that even though they are immortals in Kali Yuga they never show their celestial and divine form in Kali Yuga which is filled with anAchAris, duSTAs etc.  
  
Their presence is felt in the present kali yuga in the form of their vibhUtis which is given below:  
  
1. the presence of "ashwatthAma" is present among highly accomplished "mantravAdins" (the mastery of mantra / tantra shAstra is the vibhUti of ashwatthAma)  
  
2. the presence of "bali" is present among those kings who are ruling their kingdom with righteousness.  
  
3. Those rAma-bhaktAs who are ever-intent in singing the names of Lord Ramachandra and who are always immersed in the parayana of Srimad Ramayana and are uplifting the common folk with initiations of rAma mantra are having the vibhUti of "hanumAn".  
  
4. Among the rAma-bhaktAs, those who have attained the bhakti of "shAnta-rasa", are having the vibhUtis of "vibhISaNa".  
  
5. Those courageous soldiers who have courage to fight the enemy and protect the bhArata dEsa, in them, the vibhUti of "kripAchArya" is found.  
  
6. Those courageous dharmAchAryAs in whom both krOdha & vIrya aspects are there, in them is found the vibhUti of "parashurAma".  
  
Then the most important question was asked as "how to identify vyAsa in kali yuga"?  
  
The answer given was:  
  
Those samskrita mahApaNDitAs having mastered the vEdAs, shAstrAs, dEva-bhASa and abide in sadAchAra, dharmAnuSTAna and worship shrIrAmachandra and kriSNa, are VERILY THE FORMS OF VYASA (tE jnEyA vyAsa-mUrtayaH).  
  
So, in this way, the sapta-chiranjeeva-vibhUtIs are spread across in kali yuga and make their presence felt among sadAchAris and dEva-bhaktAs.
