The idea of 'never-ending life' is contradictory to the prakRti niyama.
jIva, which means prANa-dhAraNatva requires body too. Whatever is created has to end at some or the other time. By resorting to various siddhi-s one could prolong the destruction of the body but not eternally. 

  

In the kaThopaniShat, there is this instance of Yama offering Nachiketa
...'chirajIvikA .' and for that nachiketa replies that such a long life is only relative and will last only till Yama is at the cosmic post.
This means, till that kalpa ends. 

  

**Mantra 1.1.24:**

**एतत्तुल्यं यदि मन्यसे वरं**

**वृणीष्व वित्तंचिरजीविकां च ।**

**महाभूमौ नचिकेतः त्वं एधि**

**कामानां त्वा कामभाजं करोमि ॥**

**  
**

**Mantra 1.1. 27 -**  
**न वित्तेन तर्पणीयो मनुष्यः**  
**लप्स्यामहे वित्तम् अद्राक्ष्म चेत् त्वा ।**  
**जीविष्यामो यावत् ईशिष्यसि त्वं**  
**वरस्तु मे वरणीयः स एव ॥**

**In another context, while discussing 'eternal post', Shankaracharya, in the bhAShya (reference not immediately available) cites this verse of the purANa:**

**  
**

**\[viShNupurANam\]  
**

**  
**

**AbhUtasamplavaM sthAnaM amRtatvam vibhAvyate**

  

**This means: Till such time the pancha bhuta-s continue to exist without undergoing praLaya, dissolution, such a post or position could remain and not thereafter. **

**  
**

**Maybe other puraNa-s have definition/meaning of the concept of chiranjIvi. **
