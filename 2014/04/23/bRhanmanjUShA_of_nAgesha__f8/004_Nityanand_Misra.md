Thanks Prof. Aklujkar Ji, Prof. Sachchidanand Mishra Ji, and Prof. Korada Ji for your responses. Thanks to Ajit Gargeshwari Ji for sharing the scribd link of the Laghumañjūṣā with three commentaries, which I am sharing with the group for everybody's benefit

Prof. Korada Ji says "But it (Gurumañjūṣā) is not available", whereas what Prof. Aklujkar Ji has a book which is supposedly the Gurumañjūṣā = Mañjūṣā edited by Mahākavi Kālikāprasāda Śukla? Maybe it is not considered authentic by all scholars?  
  
I will try to get in touch with SSU regarding the publication - the publication page on the SSU website is empty. I doubt if these classics are available on Amazon/Kindle store or Flipkart - they all should be!! I may have to wait till my next visit to India to get the book.  
  
Meanwhile, if anybody has the book which Prof. Aklujkar posted pages from, and is willing to send me a photocopy, please get in touch with me. I will bear all photocpying and postal expenses.  
  
On Śābdatva and Śābdabuddhitva, it appears that they are used in the same sense conventionally (by रूढि). From a purely यौगिक perspective, I cannot see how the words शाब्द and शाब्दबुद्धि can means the same thing. The former is a तद्धितान्त (शब्द + अण्) while the latter is a समास (शाब्दी चेयं बुद्धिश्चेति शाब्दबुद्धिः) - there has to be some difference if we only consider the etymology.  
  
Thanks, Nityānanda
