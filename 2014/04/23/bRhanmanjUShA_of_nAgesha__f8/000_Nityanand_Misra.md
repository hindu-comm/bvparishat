Namaste



1. Is there a published version of the Bṛhanmañjūṣā of Nāgeśa? It is referred to in the Bhūmikā (page 3) of the Paramalaghumañjūṣā with the Jyotsanā commentary by Golokavāsī Paṇḍita Kālikāprasāda Śukla (1961: Baroda Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya, MS University of Baroda).



2. How many Mañjūṣās did Nāgeśa author? Two, three or four? Is Bṛhanmañjūṣā same as Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntamañjūṣā? Is Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntamañjūṣā same as Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntalaghumañjūṣā? I ask because I found three books on DLI which are titled as Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntamañjūṣā (Barcodes 4990010096006, 5990010099029 and 99999990293874), but all of them have the same text as the Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntalaghumañjūṣā. Surprisingly, the book with Barcode 5990010099029 has the heading Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntamañjūṣā till page 240 of the PDF (page 239 in the book) which changes to Laghumañjūṣā from page 242 (page 241 in the PDF) halfway in the book!!



And finally



3. On page 27 of MSU's 1961 edition of the Paramalaghumañjūṣā, the reading is तद्धर्मावच्छिन्नविषयकशाब्दबुद्धित्वावच्छिन्नं प्रति तद्धर्मावच्छिन्ननिरूपितवृत्तिविशिष्टज्ञानं हेतुः. On page 10 of Chowkhambha's 1963 edition of the Laghumañjūṣā (with the commentary Ratnaprabhā by Sabhāpati Śarmā Upādhyāya), the reading is तद्धर्मावच्छिन्नविषयकशाब्दत्वावच्छिन्नं प्रति तद्धर्मावच्छिन्ननिरूपितवृत्तिविशिष्टज्ञानं हेतुः. Is there a variant reading? I ask since I see शाब्दबुद्धित्वावच्छिन्नं in the VSPLM edition and शाब्दत्वावच्छिन्नं in the VSLM.
