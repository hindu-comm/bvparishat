नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Payagunda Vaidyanathabhatta says that the term लघु indicates
गुर्वप्येका मञ्जूषा अस्ति । But it is not available.

परमलघुमञ्जूषा is not considered as authoritative by scholars of Andhra as there are differences with लघुमञ्जूषा।

शाब्दबुद्धित्वावच्छिन्न etc does not change the meaning.

  

Some commentators use the term लघु to say that the commentary is brief -

  

श्रीमदाद्यापदाम्भोजद्वन्द्वं वन्दे’र्थसिद्धये।

निरुक्तविवृतिं लघ्वीं ब्रुवे दुर्गमतं यथा॥ निरुक्तव्याख्या

  

But the only problem is it is stated by a direct student of Nagesa.

  

There is लघुशब्दरत्न also - विस्तरस्तु अस्मत्कृते शब्दरत्ने मदन्तेवासिकृतशब्देन्दुशेखरमञ्जूषयोश्च द्रष्टव्य इति शुभम् (end of first part of Sabdaratna - Haridikhita - it is followed by - श्रीगुरुचरणसरोजाभ्यां नमः।

  

Scholars say that Sabdaratna is written by Nagesa with गुरुभक्ति and it is true that many sentences of Sabda.. are seen in Nagesa's works.

  

शब्देन्दुशेखरः --

  

Nagesa says शब्देन्दुशेखरः - people call it लघुशब्देन्दुशेखरः and at the end of - - the first part, लकारार्थप्रक्रियान्ते , कृदन्तान्ते च it is seen - विस्तरस्तु बृहच्छब्देन्दुशेखरे द्रष्टव्यः / बोध्यः।

  

Even in the commentary on ल श शे , called ज्यौत्स्नी and another टीका , the authors refer to बृ शे ।

  

There are eleven copies of बृ शे available and the Publishers (Sampurnananda Uni) claim that Nagesa revised / corrected his work for seven times.

I compared both ल शे and बृ शे and found variation in a number of issues .

  

Scholars from Andhra do not take बृ शे as authoritative.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
