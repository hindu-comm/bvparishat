Bṛhanmañjūṣā= Guru-mañjūṣā =mañjūṣā. The other versions are Laghu-mañjūṣā and Parama-laghu-mañjūṣā.

Please see the middle part of the second sheet in the attached. The first sheet contains publication details.

  

Given the rarity of the mss of theBṛhanmañjūṣā (which name does not seem to have ever been employed in mss or by Naage;sa's followers and critics; onlyGuru-mañjūṣā is said to have been employed by Vaidyanaatha [Paayagu.n.de](http://Paayagu.n.de))and the abundance of the mss of theLaghu-mañjūṣā, it is possible that some authors have usedmañjūṣā when they meantLaghu-mañjūṣā. A careful collation of all references made withmañjūṣā as the source specification is needed, as also a critical edition of theLaghu-mañjūṣā.

  

Prof. George Cardona of the University of Pennsylvania has worked on a critical edition of theParama-laghu-mañjūṣā, but the edition has not been published as far as I know.
