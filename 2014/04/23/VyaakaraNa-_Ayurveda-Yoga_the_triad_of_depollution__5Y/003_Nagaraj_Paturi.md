Noam Chomsky is the modern linguist that has been discussed repeatedly in comparison to Paniniyan tradition.



Relation between Chomsky's linguistics, his psychology andhis human biologyis well known.



Field dealing with mindamong ancient Indian sciences is Yoga. Ayurveda dealt with human biology.



Irrespectiveof the identity of the three Patanjalis, validity of the grouping ofVyakaraNa, Yoga and Ayurveda may be viewed from this perspective.
