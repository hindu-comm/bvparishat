Dear Dr. Yadu Ji,  
  

Namaskar. First of all, apologies for a belated response to your post. Recently, we've worked on a PhD thesis that has some theoretical answers for your some of your questions.  

You'd asked that 'why so many names are associated with different species?' If I understood your question correctly, then the justification goes something as follows:  

  
Nomenclature in Ayurveda is based on several characteristics. This is particularly true in case of synonyms as we saw in case of 'Duḥsparśā' etc. Names of the herbal plants are popular based on the following factors:  
  
**'Habitat'** = plants that grow on surface/water/surface of other trees and [parasites](http://www.indianmirror.com/ayurveda/ayurvedic-herbs.html).  
**'Conventional Usage'** = plants like '*guḍūcī*'. Etymological meanings says - 'that which protects health'.  
**'Plant morphology'** = plants like '*śatāvarī*'. That which spreads in hundred ways is *śatāvarī*.  
**'Dialectical diversity'** = herbs like '*elāvāluka*'. in some parts of Andhra it is called '*kūturu buḍama*', in some other it is known as '*nūgudosa*' (more on this later!)  
**'Symbolic'** = example: '*gojihvā*'. That means - 'a drug, whose touch is as coarse as the touch of the tongue of a cow'.  
**Resemblance to animate/inanimate (?) beings'** = example: *'maṇḍūkaparṇī*'. Leaves of this herb look like a frog.  

**'Inherent potency'** = example: '*putrañjīva*'. This herb has inherent potency to bestow male progeny.  

**'Foreign origin'** = example: '*nepālinimba*'. Originated from the Nepal region.  

**'Temporal'** = example: '*graiṣmī*'. It is produces only in the summer time.  

  

Besides the above, nomenclature formed on specific actions on '*tridoṣas*'. Thus, Rājanighaṇṭu says -  

नामानि क्वचिदिह रूढितः स्वभावात् देश्योक्त्या क्वचन च लाञ्छनोपमानाभ्याम् ।  

वीर्येण क्वचिदितराह्वयादिदेशात् द्रव्याणां धृवमिति सप्तधोदितानि ।।  
  

Next, Different cell structures of same species?  
  

Some two years back, as part of a PhD thesis, we did an experiment on '*Maireya*' that was explained by Kautilya in Artha Shsatra to check the therapeutic effects. Out of the six surās he mentioned, we initially ventured upon the '*meaka*' to study it using GC, MC, TLC and distillation techniques. With great effort we've collect a very old age type of rice called 'Āditya '. *Elāvāluka*' is one of the herbs in the formula by which we can mix the rice ferment and make the surā, for any testing. On investigation and personal visits, we found that the very herb in some parts of Andhra is called '*kūturu buḍama*', in some other pats known as '*nūgudosa'.* Fine. But experts alerted us that either of the equivalents of the herb is authentic and just they are 'substitutes'. One need to go to Himalayan range to fetch the 'original' e*lāvāluka.* So, we confined ourselves to 'Maireya' experiment and reached a resonable result. All this is due to the confusion on the 'original' vs 'substitute' trend in pharmacy. I heard that '*maṇḍūkaparṇī*' substituted for '*brāhmī*'. I assume, you are well aware of the list of controversial herbs in Ayurveda.  
  

Sorry to say that Ayurvedic pharmacies (most of them) prepare spurious medicines and god only knows the 'originality' of the herbs used in preparations. Hence, no wonder why cell structure of the drugs could be different. I tried to say something related, with my little experience in this field. I believe, Ayurveda scholars in the forum can throw more light on this issue.  
  

Thanks,  

Prasad
