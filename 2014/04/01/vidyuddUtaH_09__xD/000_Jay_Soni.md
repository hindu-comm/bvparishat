Dear Colleagues and Friends,  
As usual, it is a pleasure to present to you the next issue of Vi-dū.

The poem translated into Sanskrit for the second anniversary of Vi-dū is an unusual tribute, and "is translated with a purpose of enriching Sanskrit literature with contemporary contents, themes and ideas written in a modern Indian language. It aims to highlight the point that Sanskrit is capable of expressing 21st century ideas with equal or more effect."  
  
I trust you will also enjoy reading it.  
  
With best wishes,  
Jayendra Soni  

Secretary General, IASS
