नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Prof Joshi -  

"In your book, “Theories of Language,” you listed “Yuktis” in connection with Medicinal terminology. How will you translate Yukti or Tantrayukti in English?"  

  

---

तन्त्रयुक्तयः are there in अर्थशास्त्रम् , चरकसंहिता and सुश्रुतसंहिता । They are useful /essential in deciding the meaning .

So you may call युक्तयः as ' deciding factors of meaning' or 'devices for deciding the meaning' .

  

15 th अधिकरणम् of अर्थशास्त्रम् is styled तन्त्रयुक्तिः( जातौ एकवचनम्- Korada) ।

  

"तन्त्रयुक्तयः" - is the first सूत्रम् । Here is the commentary of म म गणपतिशास्त्री -

  

"तन्त्रयुक्तय इति । तन्त्रम् अर्थशास्त्रम् ; तदाश्रिता युक्तयः अभिधीयन्ते इति सूत्रार्थः’।

  

In वैद्यकम् (चरक & सुश्रुत) तन्त्रम् is वैद्यशास्त्रम् ।

  

So , depending on the context one has to decide as to whether तन्त्रयुक्तयः are in अर्थशास्त्रम् or चरक or सुश्रुत ।

  

Finally , तन्त्रयुक्तयः are 'deciding factors of meaning in a शास्त्रम्’ ।

  

Bhartrhari , in वाक्यकाण्ड of वाक्यपदीयम् has enumerated some deciding factors of meaning - संयोगो विप्रयोगश्च .... and the same are quoted in अलङ्कारग्रन्थाः ।

  

"शब्दार्थस्यानवच्छेदे विशेषस्मृतिहेतवः" - हरिः

  

The origin is in महाभाष्यम् - ’ अर्थात् प्रकरणाद्वा ’ (एकः पूर्वपरयोः6-1-84)

  

                  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

"At the end of your book there is Glossary. Could we call it Nighantu? "--  

  

You may call it - it is a bilingual Nighantu.

  

                \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

  

"If we choose the English word, “term” for SamjnA, then SamjnAparibhAs’A
would become Terminology" ---

  

A group of technical terms such as वृद्धि , गुण , समास, टि , घु , भ etc is called Terminology .

संज्ञा can be translated as Name or designation as it is common to all cultures .

परिभाषा - the term itself is technical and culture specific and as such it cannot / should not be translated -

  

अनियमे नियमकारिणी परिभाषा । (परिभाषा = blaming / admonishing - Patanjali)

  

It should be संज्ञापरिभाषम् ।

  

                   

धन्यो’स्मि
