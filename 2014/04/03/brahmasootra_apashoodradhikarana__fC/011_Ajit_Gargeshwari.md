As far as I understand the commentaries the uddesha of writing bhashya for realization of Self or Brahman not to get into elaborate discussions about Varna or Jati which is within the scope of Dharma sutras rate than Brahma sutras.  

The Bhashyakaras views only talks about adhikarin or who has the capability to correctly understand the sutras Thanks
