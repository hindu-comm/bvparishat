respected sir, thank you for your precious reply. i agree to your point
in which you have describedCommentators are just attempting to be faithful to the original work and explain the view of Bādarāyaṇa as they understand it.

but still they are the brahmagyaani they are giving a meaningful direction to the society. they should have given their own thoughts also on it. and all the bhashykaras are trying to explain brahmasootra according to their sampradaaya then these all are actually their own commentries. whatever they think they described. as radhakrishanan have opposed them they also should have denied that system but they didn't. why ???? may be because they all agree for such varna and jati system.
