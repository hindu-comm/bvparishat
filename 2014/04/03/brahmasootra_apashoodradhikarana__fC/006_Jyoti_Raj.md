respected sir, thank you for the reply. but i am still stick to my point. according to s.n.das gupta the time period of badarayan was 2nd century b.c .. i cannnt say it was dwapar yug or something else. i am just searching out why the badarayan and shankar, ramanuj etc. have excluded sudras (by caste) from the study of Brahmavidya. shankar says in his bhashya - जातिशूद्रस्यानाधिकारात् \| and even in geeta (१८.४८) he defines the word सहजं as सह जन्मना एव उत्पन्नं सहजं किं तत् कर्म कौन्तेय सदोषं अपि त्रिगुणत्वाद् न त्यजेत् \| i am searching have they ever said something to support sudras? that i coudn't find out in the bhashyas. and my work is stick to the brahmasootra, i cannot go far away which is not related to the vedanta.

  

thank you sir .
