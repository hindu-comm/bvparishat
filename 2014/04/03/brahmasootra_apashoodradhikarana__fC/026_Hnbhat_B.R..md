It makes some difference or may make great difference. I am not much interested in the topic anyhow. Just a suggestion. The second assumes the researcher is the final authority on the interpretation than producing the views and interpretations of Acharya-s as he has understood himself from the context. This makes the difference in the result of the result of the research too.
