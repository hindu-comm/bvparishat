I have seen one reference to this in the Aanandagiri Teekka on Sankara's Bhasyam for the 16th verse in Advaiata Prakarana of Gaudapada Karika for Maandookyopanishad. While Sankara leaves it as "Varna" the teekkakara refers to Sudra in particular. Which I felt it as twisting the original by compulsions of the time.
