I don't think that any of the posters said that - 'shUdra-s have adhikAra to study veda-s and if they don't study they can't study brahmavidyA too'.  

They said that - 'shUdra is ineligible to study veda-s and hence they can't acquire brahmavidyA through upaniShad-s, i.e. veda-s'.  
  

So, there is no contradiction. shUdra-s have no adhikAra for veda-adhyayana and hence can't acquire brahmavidyA through them.  
  

Again, your lines about 'some lines'



shows that you are either not aware of or could not appreciate smR^iti-s, etc. which support varNa-vyavasthA. That's OK. But, don't hope to get this stand validated by old AchArya-s. Why should they comply to your prejudice ?

This again shows that you consider advaitavAda opposed to varNa-vyavasthA, which of course is not the case. How could sUtra like sarvApexA cha yaGYAdishruteH ashvAdivat, etc. follow if that was the case?  

Try to search internet to get this solved. vidyAsha\~Nkara, subrahmanian have written many replies for such doubts on advaita-L and advaitin forums.

If you could point that portion in commentary, we will try to have a look.

This is just repetition of your previous doubt.

That's why vidyAsha\~Nkara said that people can attain brahmavidyA through other means as itihAsa, purANa, etc. and nityAnanda supported it by quoting purANa.  

As bhagavatpAda allows anAshramI-s, so he allows varNI-s related to shUdra category, for the same reason that brahmaGYAnI-s are seen in shUdra category too.
