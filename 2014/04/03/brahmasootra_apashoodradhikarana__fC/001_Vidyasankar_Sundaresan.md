Dear Ms. Raj,



I am not aware of the contents of the bhAshyas of rAmAnuja and later commentators, but I'm afraid you have not understood the SAnkara bhAshya on the apaSUdrAdhikaraNa correctly. The gist of the final viewpoint expressed there is as follows.



Those ineligible to study the veda cannot pursue the Srauta, i.e. aupanishada, route to knowledge of brahman. However, for the qualified brahmajijnAsu (said qualifications were already listed in the adhyAsa bhAshya, i.e. introduction section of his brahmasUtrabhAshya), the road to brahmavidyA lies through the smArta category of the itihAsa-purANa. He quotes a text that says, "zrAvayec caturvarNAn" and confirms that the itihAsa-purANa is open to all, irrespective of varNa. Please note that the text par eminence here is the mahAbhArata, which contains the gItA, which in turn, is the smRti text par excellence, and one of the three prasthAna-s on which vedAnta bases itself. Sankara never claims that a SUdra is incapable of attaining the qualifications that he considers essential for brahmajijnAsA. And he had already decoupled brahmajijnAsA from formal study of the vedas or performance of the rituals enjoined in them.



I'm afraid you are not going to find anything denying the caste system or even criticizing it. However, do note that in Sankara's system, the ideal brahmajnAnI is beyond varNa and Asrama. This is because the identity of thisjnAnI is not bound by human society at all. Nevertheless,why should one presume that Sankara or any other bhAshyakArafrom the vedAnta schools should have denied varnASrama as a system that orders human society? Isn't it rather presumptuous to expect that these authors should have subscribed to contemporary concerns about varNa?



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
