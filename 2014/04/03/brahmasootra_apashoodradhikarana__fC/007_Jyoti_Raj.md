respected sir thank you for your reply. I agree to your such a meaningful point, that a sudra who have not studied vedas is not entitled for Brahmavidya. But there is again self-Contradiction in the bhashyas, because when a sudra wants to study veda bhashyakaras do not allow them to study it (brahmasutra 1.3.38) bhashyakaras quotes some of the lines of smritis and gautam dharma sutras .  , according to shankar's metaphysics everything is brahm then a sudra should also called as a brahm.

  the second point is that, yes i agree they allow sudras to listen puran and itihas, but in the brahmavidyabharana teeka of shankar bhashya the teekakar says that sudras are not allow to read even the puranas and itihas or mahabharat in which the brahmavidya is mention.

 the third point has been described thatSankara's system, is beyond varNa and Asrama and if it is beyond the varna and asaram then why doesn't he allow sudras to study brahmavidya and vedas.. he allow to study brahmavidya to them who have broken the rules of asaram vyavastha, but he s not redy to break the rules of varnavyavastha."विधुरादिनां द्रव्यादिसम्पद्रहितानां चान्यतमाश्रमप्रतिपत्तिहीनानामन्तरालवर्तिनां किं विद्यायामधिकारोऽस्ति किंवा नास्तीति संशये, नास्तीति तावत्प्राप्तम्, आश्रमकर्मणां विद्याहेतुत्वावधारणादाश्रमकर्मासम्भवाच्चैतेषामिति। एवं प्राप्त इदमाह- अन्तरा चापि तु' अनाश्रमित्वेन वर्तमानोऽपि विद्यायामधिक्रियते। कुतः? तद्दृष्टेः। रैक्ववाचक्नविप्रभृतीनामेवंभूतानामपि ब्रह्मवित्त्वश्रुत्युपलब्धेः" (३.४.९.३६ ब्रह्मसूत्र शाङ्करभाष्य)
