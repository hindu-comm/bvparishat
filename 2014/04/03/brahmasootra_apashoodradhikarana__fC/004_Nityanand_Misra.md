If the context is itself titled Apaśūdrādhikaraṇa, the view of the author of Brahma Sūtra is probably quite clear. Commentators are just attempting to be faithful to the original work and explain the view of Bādarāyaṇa as they understand it. We cannot expect traditional commentators who lived hundreds of years ago, in an entirely different milieu from today, to voice views which are considered politically correct today, especially when they are explaining someone else's work.

Having said that, several commentators make a distinction between Brahmavidyā as taught in the Vedas, the study of which as per their view is not open to Śūdras, and the Brahmavidyā arising out of listening the Purāṇa and Itihāsa works, which in their view are open to all. This is the traditional position, as also stated in the Bhāgavatam (1.4.25) -

strīśūdradvijabandhūnāṁ trayī na śrutigocarā

karmaśreyasi mūḍhānāṁ śreya evaṁ bhavediha

iti bhāratamākhyānaṁ kṛpayā muninā kṛtam

  

You may want to read the views of S Radhakrishnan who, at the end of his translation of Apaśūdrādhikaraṇa (George Allen and Unwin Limited, 1960, pp. 306-309), rejects any such restrictions "The restrictions with regards to Vedic study cannot be defended ..."

<https://archive.org/stream/Sarvepalli.Radhakrishnan-Brahma.Sutra-The.Philosophy.of.Spiritual.Life/Radhakrishnan-Brahma.Sutra-The.Philosophy.of.Spiritual.Life#page/n308/mode/1up>

So you may say that Radhakrishnan is the only one here supporting the Śūdras and opposing the caste system. But at the same time he is also opposing Bādarāyaṇa himself. A modern writer is free to do that, but bear in mind that the work is not a Bhāṣya if the author does this. For a work to be considered as a Bhāṣya, it has to be faithful to the original work.
