You must first know and clearly state the difference between Varna and Jati. Please don't mix up 20 century concepts of Jati into a thousand 1500 year old bhashya then the bhashya will become clear. All commentators are influenced by the society they lived and the texts and knowledge they had in hand at a given point of time at which they wrote their commentary
