I had almost decided to keep silent on this thread, but I think I will after this one posting. May I venture to suggest that you adopt an analytical approach that takes away modern emotion about varNa and evaluates this topic objectively?



1\. As far as advaita vedAnta is concerned, AtmavijnAna is one thing, study of the veda is another. Please re-read Sankara's commentary on the very first sUtra, to see how effectively he decouples the two. There is no self-contradiction in the bhAshya. The contradiction lies in the modern expectation that study of the veda is somehow a guarantor of liberation in vedAntic terms. That it is not, is one of the first things taught by almost every vedAnta sampradAya. One can be a highly learned scholar of the veda and yet remain completely enmeshed in saMsAra. Another can be completely innocent of what passes for education and yet be a jnAnI. The bhakti oriented schools of vedAnta will all say similar things about the bhakta who is fit for moksha as well.



2\. In theory, "everything is brahm, then a sudra should also be called as a brahm" sounds like a fine enough argument, but it completely misses the point. The jnAnI, a samadarzI,is not necessarily a "social reformer," the way our contemporary mentality expects him or her to be. From the jnAnI's perspective, everything changes, because he no longer values worldly differences, but precisely because he doesn't value worldly differences, he doesn't feel impelled to go around "making a difference" in the world. So, for the rest of theworld, nothing changes.



3\. The author of brahmavidyAbharaNa is not Sankara bhagavatpAda. If you wish to understand what Sankara himself says about this adhikaraNa, the corresponding bhAshya is simple enough to grasp. I daresay the bhAshya-s of other vedAnta traditions on this adhikaraNa are also not all that complicated. Sankara explicitly says that listening to the itihAsa-purANa is for all varNa-s and explicitly affirms a route to AtmajnAna through that. Please note that Sankara never talks about "reading" any text, even for the brAhmaNa varNa. It is always about listening, SravaNa, from which everything else follows.

  
4. The word vidhura means widower. Hardly anyone chooses to break ASrama vyavasthA by becoming a widower. It just so happens that a wife may predecease the man, leavingthe gRhastha an anASramin. Assuming that other qualifications for knowledge exist (again, go back to Sankara's introduction for this),such a man does have adhikAra. Without a wife, heloses adhikAra for somesignificant ritual actions, but not for jnAna - that is the conclusion.Similarly with women with vAcaknavI, i.e. gArgI, ofone oftheupanishat-s, or men like raikva, mentioned in another upanishat, who are affirmed to have adhikAra for jnAna. Sankara does not say that such people somehow have adhikAra for certain significant ritual actions, which require a husband-wife pair, inspite of being single. In any case, the argument you make about Sankara's flexibility towards those who do not fit into an ASrama hardly carries over identicallyto the varNa part of traditional society. This is because the analogy to people who don't fit neatly into one or the other ASrama can only be people who don't fit neatly into one or the other varNa, not people who belong clearly to one of the varNa-s.



5\. Also, may I suggest that you complement a study of the texts with a study of the ground realities, as known from history? In the advaita tradition, you have recorded evidence of various kinds of ascetics who were not born into the brAhmaNa varNa. If you read up on the Dasanami Akhadas and their membership, or if you visit a Kumbha Mela and observe the Dasanamis in person, you will find a huge number of them who were born in families that are technically SUdra or of disputed varNa. Nowadays, you will find a number of women too, but note that women renunciants were not non-existent even in the past. These arepeople who have followed the traditional path of renouncingall their family connections, property and social standing, in pursuit of moksha. From the non-advaita traditions also, you will find lots of examples that are not brAhmaNa men, dating back to more thanhundreds ofyears. These are well known enough and I don't have to list them here.  
  
You can hardly blameancient authors from various vedAnta traditions for not sharing the colonial and post-colonial hang ups about caste in India. Finally,for a young scholar pursuing a PhD, a piece of unsolicited advice - you don't have to be apologetic about any aspect of India's past and you don't have to assign blame to anybody for any wrongs, real or perceived. It is what it is, and your research would benefit from not being preloaded with value judgements.



Best wishes,

Vidyasankar
