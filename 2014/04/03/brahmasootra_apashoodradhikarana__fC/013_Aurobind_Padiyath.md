Ms Jyoti,

You are mixing up two status of existences to make a contradiction between them.

One is Vyavaharika and the other being Pramarthatha.

All explanations and books and bhasyas have relevance only in the first and hence they are under the influence of the Dharma (rules) of that state of awareness. And in the later stageज्ञाते द्वैथम् न विद्यते .

And you may wonder if they are True Knowers of the Paramarthata how can they have vyavahara? Do not we explain to the children saying ""look at the blue sky!!! how beautiful the golden cloud looks in it???"" While we know that the sky is not blue and the clouds per say have no colors... what happened to our knowledge when we do that? It is an example of Vyavahara with the Knowledge of the Truth.
