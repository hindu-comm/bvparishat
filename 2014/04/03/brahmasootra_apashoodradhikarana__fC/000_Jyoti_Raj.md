I am pursuing PhD on Apashoodradhikarana of Brahmasootra (1.3.34-1.3.38), in which badarayna, all the bhaashykaras. and teekaakar have excluded shudras from brahmavidya. according to shankar, ramanuj, madhva, vallabh etc. sudra (by caste) is not qualified to undertake Brahmavidya.

I have read whole bhashyas of shankar, ramanuj, vallabh, madhva and nimbark but i couldn't get even a single line in which the would be
denying the cast system, or else supporting the sudras. kindly help me to find out some supporting lines.
