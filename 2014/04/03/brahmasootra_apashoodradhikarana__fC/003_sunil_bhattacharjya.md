Badarayana lived in the Dwapara yuga and at his time the Shudras were not allowed to observe Tapa but in the Kali yuga the Shudras have been allowed to to perform Tapa.  
  
तस्मिन्द्वापरसंख्ये तु वर्तमाने युगक्षये अधर्मश्चानृतं चैव ववृधे पुरुषर्षभ \|  
तस्मिन्द्वापरसंख्याते तपो वैश्यान्समाविशत् न शूद्रो लभते धर्ममुग्रं तप्तुं नरर्षभ \|  
हीनवर्णो नरश्रेष्ठ तप्यते सुमहत्तपः भविष्या शुद्रयोन्यां हि तपश्चर्या
कलौ युगे \|  
  

There could have been such strictures on reading the Vedic texts too for the shudras in the Dwapara yuga. However there were cases where such strictures could be lifted in deserving cases, such as what happened in case of satyakama.
