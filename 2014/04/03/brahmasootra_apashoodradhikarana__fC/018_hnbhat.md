OK. Very fine. Please give the topic of your research specifically. It is a wellknown fact "Apashudradhikarana" topic in general denies Vedadhikara to Shudra, which is anticipant for Vedanta (literally the final portion of Veda-s) and its contents. Now please give us briefly your idea that made you think the Shudra's are supported in any of the Bhashya's qualifying them for Vedadhyayana and Vedantadhyayana. Leave alone Brahmasootra. That is the way to approach a forum, to put forward your idea first and ask others' opinion. There should have been many earlier studies on this topic as it is of common interest of public today.
