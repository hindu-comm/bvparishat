You have answered the question yourself. They all agreed with the वर्णव्यवस्था. Can they be faulted if they agreed with a social system?  
  
I am surprised that a serious student as you makes a statement like -  
  
"As radhakrishanan have opposed them \[sic\] they also should have denied that system but they didn't"  
  
The statement belies a foregone conclusion - that the वर्णव्यवस्था system was "wrong" and the commentators should have denied it but they did not. The statement is an opinion masquerading as a fact.  
  
It is like saying As "Abraham Lincoln opposed slavery, the prophet of Islam should have abolished it but he did not."  
  
One cannot use standards of today to judge historical figures.
