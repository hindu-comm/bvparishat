The apashudradhikarana, could be dragged into anywhere. First it is based on the statement consequently in order । शुगस्य तदनादरश्रवणात्तदाद्रवणात्सूच्यते हि । १,३.३३ । क्षत्रियत्वगतेश्च । १,३.३४ । उत्तरत्र चैत्ररथेन लिङ्गात् । १,३.३५ । संस्कारपरामर्शात्तदभावाभिलापाच्च । १,३.३६ । तदभावनिर्धारणे च प्रवृत्तेः । १,३.३७ । श्रवणाध्ययनार्थप्रतिषेधात् । १,३.३८ ।

  

which bases on the etymological derivation of the word so as to conclude श्रवणाध्ययनार्थप्रतिषेधात्, and now one can debate only how how this statement and conclusion totally denies ब्रह्मविद्या to Shudra. It explicitly concludes श्रवण-अध्ययनार्थ as the प्रतिषेध and not knowing ब्रह्मविद्या by other means, as one can do read it with books or directly like विदुर who is by birth. The topic discussed mostly in these days, whether शूद्र is eligible to वेदाध्ययन and which is antecedent to ब्रह्मविद्या as described in उपनिषत्-s. And the topic could be elongated whether it is जातिशूद्र, which again is often discussed in many other forums, whether caste system वर्ण system is by birth or not. Many are fond of such discussions and this अपशूद्राधिकरण is heatedly discussed. And one can interpret the Bhashya sentences conveniently to support their views.

  

Now our member wanted to write a Thesis on this अपशूद्राधिकरण with his own insights. Welcome. Anyhow here is a link on Vedic Research I found while Googling, an article on this Adhikarana,

Some of the members might have been contributed to the article.
