Dear Friends,  
  

There is a commentary on the Ananda Lahari called Sudha-Vidyotini (Sudhaa-Vidyotinee). I shall be grateful if any scholar can give me details as to get a copy of that. This commentary was written by a Vakataka prince, who was probably a brother-in-law of Kalidasa-II.  
  

Regards,
