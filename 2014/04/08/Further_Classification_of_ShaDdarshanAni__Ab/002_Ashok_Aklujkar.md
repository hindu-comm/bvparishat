The original reading of paada 'b' probably was रजसान्विता rajasaanvitaa.  
  
In such cases a literal translation (especially a literal translation following the dictionary meanings given by early Sanskritists/Indologists) can be misleading. The intended message will probably be better conveyed through something like the following: "Vedaanta takes man to his/her inner being (makes him introvert, that is, looking within himself), reflective-meditative. Puurva-miimaa.msa takes him/her to activity (makes him extrovert and engaged in sa.msaara). Ratiocination (frequently) makes him indecisive and hence inactive, which state arises when tamas is dominant."  
  
a.a.
