Vidvadbhyo NamaH,

  

Vedanta is classified as sattivic (mode of goodness), mImAmsA is rAjasic (mode of passion) and nyAya and hetuvAda are designated as tAmasic (mode of ignorance).

  

The following verse is found in the first chapter of Devi BhAgavatam:

  

sAtvikam tatra vedAntam mImAmsA rAjasammitam

tAmasam nyAyasAstram ca hetuvAdAbhiyantritam

  

  

Dhanyo'smi
