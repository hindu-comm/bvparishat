Namaste

*The verses comparing various Purāṇas to the body of Śrīhari are from Purāṇa (Padma Purāṇa). The verses categorizing them into Sāttvika Tāmasa Rājasa are also from Purāṇa (Padma Purāṇa and Devī Bhāgavatam).  
*

  

Yes, very much.

Though not related to main discussion, this is what (pl. see image attached) MR Kale says about पद्मपुराण source of शकुन्तला story in his commentary on "The Abhijnana-shakuntalam of Kalidasa" (MLBD, Delhi, 10th Ed. 1969, Reprint-2005). Thought, would share it as an instance researched on by a great scholar like Kale, on this पुराण issue.

  

There were other instances as well when पद्मपुराण authenticity was at question (no other पुराण enjoys as many cases of contradictions as this one, as I *heard* it-).

And I also read that- it is देवीभागवतम् for the first time, which raises issues of greater and lesser gods (esp. विष्णु, शिव, देवी comparisons). (References due from me. Will provide as soon as I find where exactly I read it.)

  

Rest is to be decided by authentic sources, and the issue is waiting for a serious research.

Thankyou
