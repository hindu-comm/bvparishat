The verses comparing various Purāṇas to the body of Śrīhari are from Purāṇa (Padma Purāṇa). The verses categorizing them into Sāttvika Tāmasa Rājasa are also from Purāṇa (Padma Purāṇa and Devī Bhāgavatam).  
  
One can say the former contradict the latter, but if we say that, are we not implying there is Vyāghātadoṣa in the Purāṇas? Or are we saying (without proof) that the latter verses are interpolated?  
  
What is needed is Sāmañjasya between these two, not necessarily rejection of one position and acceptance of another.  
  
Karapātra Svāmī has written that any Vyāghātadoṣa in our scriptures is only apparent, and exists until a Sāmañjasya has been established.  
  
It would be interesting to see how various commentators have explained them. Are there any known commentaries on Padma Purāṇa we may consult? What adds to the difficulty in understanding Purāṇas is that Guru Parampāras exist only for some of them Purāṇa - I know the Śrīmadbhāgavatam is still learned traditionally in Gurukulas but other Purāṇas - I am not aware.
