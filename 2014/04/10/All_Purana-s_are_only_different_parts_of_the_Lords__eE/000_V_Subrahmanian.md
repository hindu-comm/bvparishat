Someone sent me the following verse, though not correctly showing, which depicts the Lord's Body as representing the various purana-s. A nice imagery. Although parts are named differently, the Madhwa school does not admit svagata bheda in the Lord's Body. One cannot hold one part of the Lord's body to be superior to another.
