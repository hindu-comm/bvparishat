Yes, the timing and authenticity of Purāṇas are questioned by many, but even the most intelligent and wise challengers have no conclusive answers - they give their "opinions" and "beliefs" but no concrete proofs. Some believe Padmapurāṇa predates Kālidāsa (as Kane cites), some believe it copies from Kālidāsa's work (as Kane "believes" - "It seems ..."), some others believe Padmapurāṇa predates Bhavabhūti and Uttararāmacarita draws from Padmapurāṇa, some others believe Padmapurāṇa came around 1000 CE. In all this debate, nothing is proven beyond doubt, these are all conjectures and.or opinions (something like there was Jaya, then Bhārata then Mahābhārata). The traditional Āstika belief is that the eighteen Smṛtis and eighteen Purāṇas are compositions of the same seers who saw the Mantras of the Vedas. In the absence of concrete proof from any of the questioners, I have no choice but to believe in somebody's view. In such a case, I would rather believe in this traditional Āstika view.

Firstly we do not even know if this is an example of Vyāghāta. The comparison to body parts, and categorization as Sāttvika, Rajāsa, Tāmasa may be two different perspectives. Is this contradiction? Subrahmanian Ji and Prof. Ganesan seem to suggest this is, but I do not think there is a contradiction here. If this is contradiction, then one can argue that Gītā 18-41 (ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशां शूद्राणां च परन्तप। कर्माणि प्रविभक्तानि स्वभावप्रभवैर्गुणैः॥) which admits different Guṇa for four Varṇas, contradicts the Puruṣasūkta (ब्राह्मणोऽस्य मुखमासीत्। बाहू राजन्यः कृतः। ऊरू तदस्य यद्वैश्यः। पद्भ्‍यां शूद्रो अजायत॥) which says the Varṇas came from different body parts of the cosmic Puruṣa. When we talk of Sāttvika, Rajāsa, Tāmasa - there is no superiority or inferiority intended, it is the inherent Guṇa which is being talked about.  
  
Secondly, sweeping statements like "no other पुराण enjoys as many cases of contradictions as this one" need to be corroborated with evidence and examples. It is expected that Western scholars and modern writers reject the historicity and authenticity of Purāṇas, or call them as "full of contradiction". But coming from a traditional scholar like you, suggestions that Purāṇas have Vyāghāta or interpolations is a bit surprising.

Research is most welcome, but cannot decide for all in this case - Purāṇas are matters of faith for a large section of Hindu population. Historicity and accuracy of immaculate conception, virgin birth, splitting of the moon, al-Buraq, et cetera can all be researched - but those who believe in these hardly bother about research.
