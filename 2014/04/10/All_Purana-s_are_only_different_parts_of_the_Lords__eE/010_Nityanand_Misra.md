Thanks for the link. I went through the first 16 or so pages of the book, after which the discussion moves to other points. An elaborate Purvapaksa (of whom it is not clear, but certainly not the Puranic Paksa) says that the Shaiva Puranas are unauthentic or only authentic when they agree with Vaishnava Puranas. The Purvapaksa makes certain interpretations based on the Sattvika-Rajasa-Tamasa categorization of Puranas/Mahatmyas in Puranas. This Purvapaksa is contradicted by the commentatory.  
  
However, I did not find a single place where the Sattvika-Rajasa-Tamasa categorization in Puranic verses per se is contradicted or contested. Nor is it indicated that they were concoctions. Maybe I missed it or maybe it is in a different work, please point out in either case where the author has contradicted the Puranic verses.  
  
In fact, the commentator has cited similar verses from the supposedly Shaiva Puranas like Matsya, Skanda and Linga which talk about similar Sattvika-Rajasa-Tamasa categorizations, e.g. Mahatmya of Siva being greater in Tamasa Kalpas, et cetera.  
  
The claim that the Padma Purana verses are interpolated by Vaishnavas needs corroboration and is not helped by the cited commentary. Surely Vaishnavas did not concoct those verses in Shaiva and Shakta Puranas also!  
  
What I did find was that the commentator has shown एकवाक्यता in the Puranas. And in his favour he cites that whatever Kalpa Brahma had in mind when he first uttered the Puranas, corresponding to that Sattvika-Tamasa-Rajasa Kalpa, different (divisions of) Puranas came into existence. This is the Samanjasya that I was referring to, which confirms the belief that there is no self-contradiction in our Puranas.  
  
Similarly, some Puranas leading to Niraya surely has a deeper meaning, which we may not be aware of. Maybe some commentary on Padma Purana will help.
