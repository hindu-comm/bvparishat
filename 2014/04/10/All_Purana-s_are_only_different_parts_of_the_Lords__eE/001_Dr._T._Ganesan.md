If each of the 18 purANa-s forms each part of God's Body, then there is absolutely no question of dumping some purANa-s as taamasa, raajasa and praising others as saattvika. !!!  
  
A similar view is also found in the Saiva Agama tradition where each of the 28 Muula Agama-s forms part of one of the holy limbs of Siva, of which there are verses in certain Saiva Agama-s.
