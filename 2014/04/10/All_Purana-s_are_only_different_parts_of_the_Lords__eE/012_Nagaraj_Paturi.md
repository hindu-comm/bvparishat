The guNa-wise classification of purANas (even dars'anas/s'Astras) was
discussed in the threads

These linksare for the benefit of those interested in the connected discussions.



Body parts imagery is to communicate the idea of intertextuality andorganic unity among purANas.



guNa-wise classification of purANas is neither in consonance nor in dissonance with the body parts model of looking at the set of purANas.



These two are two mutually independent perspectives.



The validities of these two perspectives are not interdependent too.
