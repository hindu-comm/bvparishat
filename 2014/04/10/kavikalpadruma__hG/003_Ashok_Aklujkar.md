Dear Dr. Patel,

  

Pl see the attached.

  

It seems that a few pages of this (excellent) edition were not properly cut on the right side in the binding process. As a result, pp. 14-15 were probably missed in scanning because the sheet containing them was not separated from pages 13 and 16.

  

a.a.
