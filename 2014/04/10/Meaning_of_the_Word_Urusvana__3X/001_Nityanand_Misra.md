उरु as an adjective means "wide , broad , spacious , extended , great , large , much , excessive , excellent" (Monier-Williams).

The word finds place in the ध्यानम् of रामरक्षास्तोत्र

नानालङ्कारदीप्तं दधतमुरुजटामण्डलं रामचन्द्रम्

उरुजटामण्डलं = large locks of matted hair

स्वन means "sound , noise (in the older language applied to the roar of wind , thunder , water ; in later language to the song of birds , speech , and sound of any kind)" (Monier-Williams)

उरुस्वन is a बहुव्रीहिसमास - उरुः स्वनो यस्य स उरुस्वनः

It may be translated as "one having a strong voice". Monier Williams says "of strong voice , stentorian."

The right word depends on the context. गम्भीरस्वर may be used if the meaning is "a deep voice". Apter suggestions can be made if you let us know the context.
