For a woman's name, उरुस्वना (Urusvanā) would be correct and not उरुस्वन (Urusvana) which is masculine. In this context the meaning would rather be "one who has a great voice" and not "one with a strong voice", unless the "strong voice" meaning is actually intended (which could be the case if she is a Soprano or heavy metal singer).
