Hello Sir,  
  
I was looking at the meaning of the sanskrit word "Urusvana" as I found  
this to be closest to mean "Of Strong Voice". Could you help me with how  
you translate "Urusvana" and the inherent meaning of the word.  
  
Is there a better word or any synonyms?  
  
Any help is welcome.  
  
Thank you,  
  
A A Khare
