Dear scholars,

I have come across a manuscript in the library of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai (acc. no 619) entitled द्वादशवाक्यविचार/द्वादशवाक्यविवरण. It isa mss based on Vedanta.

Author and time of the mssare not mentioned.

It is a small mss of 48 folios, with last folio/s missing.

Does anyone know of such a mss in any other library.

We have checkedin the catalogues published by of Madras University, BORI and NMM. No such entry is found there.

Please let me know if anyone has more details
