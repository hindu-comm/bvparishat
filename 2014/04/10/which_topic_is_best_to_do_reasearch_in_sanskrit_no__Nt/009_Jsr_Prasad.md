Namaste.  
  

I just have checked the post of Dr. BVK Sastry.  

I appreciate the nice thoughts.

Indeed, a serious issue to contemplate and decide on. Gone or the days, when it is believed in 'या विद्या सा मिमुक्तये'. Now the modified version I hear is 'या विद्या सा नियुक्तये' ।

Good idea. Chance to look at the grave distortions by some so-called indologists. People can remedy the affect of 'Wendy Syndrome' etc. Let us root out such 'syndromes' or 'diseases' at its mutative state itself.

Can be a worthy study. For instance, one can explore the inherent medical principles in the maxims of vernaculars/ folk cultures.
