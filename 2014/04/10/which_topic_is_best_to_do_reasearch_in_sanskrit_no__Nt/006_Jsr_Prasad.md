Dear Pavan Kumar,  
  

First of all, your question carries only a subject line, nothing else in the body text. I presume that you intended to join for a research degree. If so, following are some of my comments.  

-   For what purpose you want to do research, for knowledge sake or
    employment? What is your background, Sanskrit or Science? You
    studied Sanskrit as main language or second language? Do you want to
    conduct interdisciplinary research in Sanskrit (linguistics,
    philosophy, vedanta-physics, indigenous medical systems,
    neurology-yoga etc.)? You wanted your research thesis to submitted
    in Sanskrit?

-   If your research is purely for academic purpose/knowledge sake, then
    you have to choose suitable research guides in institutions where
    research is more encouraged. If you are looking for a research
    degree linked to employment, then I need not to say anything on
    this. But one suggestion! For better employment prospects, consider
    joining for a śikṣāśāstri (B.Ed.) and/or śikṣācārya (M.Ed.) in
    Sanskrit Vidyapeethas. Still this subject is in demand but the
    competition is high.  

-   As per the higher education system in India, some
    innovative/interdisciplinary/trans-disciplinary research departments
    have been started by UGC. You have all options to explore these too,
    if you are a science student with Sanskrit as second language.  

-   Nowadays, almost all academic institutions maintain respective
    institutional websites. Hope, you are acquainted with search
    engines, you may explore the research interests of the faculty as
    per your identified/thrust area. You may lock on one or two
    institutions and try as per their admission guidelines. You may
    probably meet respective faculty personally, to discuss things in
    advance.

&nbsp;

-   If you select Vidyapeethas, affiliated/recognized colleges as a
    research avenue, then you have good chances to interact with the
    guide in Sanskrit to proceed further. Vidyapeethas facilitate you to
    submit your thesis in Sanskrit. This does not mean, you can not
    interact with guides in Sanskrit, in institutions other than the
    referred!  

Long back, Prof. Jagannatha (of this forum) has kindly send the forum a list of topics that can be chosen by the young researchers. Recently, I believe, Dr. Vamsikrishna Ghanapathi has also discussed this issue in a thread. It is possible that I might have missed some other names who have discussed about this issue here. Whatever it is, you may search through the old posts of BVP, pertaining to your question.  
  
Certainly, it is good to create a database of research topics. But śāstra wise, area (interdisciplinary, śikṣāśāstra etc.) wise topics need to be identified. Also, we need to see, whether the topic is meant for a PhD hypothesis or contribute to a general interest. I second Dr. Ramachandran Mahadevan's suggestion.
