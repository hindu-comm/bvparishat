There are huge number of possibilities.



Itis a good idea to create a ***research topic bank*** as part of BVP.



It is better to encourage listing ***only intriguing questions ***as topics.



A database with fields such as



"Contributor",



"Additional contributors/modifiers/ rectifiers along with suggested modification/rectification",



"The branch of knowledge to which the topic belongs",



"The branches of knowledge that might help in study",



"preliminary previous literature",



"suggested reading",



"Expected benefits",



can be created.
