While the adhikaraNa has the gloss of bhAmatI, nyAyanirNaya (of Anandagiri who has commented on the prasthanatraya bhashya of Shankara) and Ratnaprabha and also has been provided with a vRtti by sadAshivendra Saraswati, the theory of interpolation is to be cautiously considered.
The siddhAnta lesha sangraha of Appayya dIkShitA too has included discussion on this adhikaraNa in the third pariccheda. So, the ancient sampradAya has not raised doubt as to the interpolation of this adhikaraNa.
