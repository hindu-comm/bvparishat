Swami Shivananda considers the Adhikarana as an interpolation.

It may be a pertinent research problem to see whether this adhikarana fits into the coherence of the argument of the book.

Unless Sriman/Srimati Jyoti Raj makes his/her research question or research problem clear it does not make sense to continue the discussion.

Nagaraj
