Re: Brahma Sutra - apasudradhikaraNa

  

I advise Sriman Jyoti Raj to study the Govinda Bhashya commentary (on Vedanta Sutras) of Srila Baladeva VidyabhushaNa for a dyanamic and broad-minded commentary on this contentious topic. As rightly said, none of the traditionalists mentioned herein looked at the issue as logically as explained in the Govinda Bhashya commentary. Sriman Jyoti Raj may also consult the works of Shri Dayananda Sarasvati, the founder of Arya Samaj. One may click the link given below to directly get into the subject:
