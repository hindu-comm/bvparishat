Dear Subrahmanyan,

  

  

There is no question of interpolations with the traditional commentator's in the Shastra-s and the commentators on other fields, mostly in साहित्य often raise the authenticity and प्रक्षेप of the readings and some times, of the verses. For example, the commentator Mallinatha, though considering as प्रक्षेप still comment on the texts.
It is in the interest of modern researchers, originality and interpolations are considered based on critical editions based on original manuscripts. I don't know whether the Swamyji had himself critically edited the text of Brahmasutra or written himself a commentary which he has defended the theory of being the AdhikaraNa in question of being interpolation.
