I am sorry. I overlooked that you were looking for a utility forDevanagari script. Unipdf does not help.



1\. What you need is an OCR software for Devanagari script.

2\. One should also distinguish between pdfs made from word processors and the pdfs from scanned devanagari documents.Conversion of the first type is now possible. Conversion of the second type is not fully developed even for roman script.



Sorry again.
