Good Morning All,



Dr. S. Manikya Sharma, a reputed scholar in Ayurveda/Sanskrit, has been invited as a visiting fellow in the Dept. of Sanskrit Studies for a period of one month, effective from 1st April, 2014. We planned to read Caraka Samhita text in original. Initially, we planned to start with sutrasthana. Further, if time allows, we would like to read the vimaana and/or sareerasthaanas. Indeed, listening to a great exponent in Ayurveda, especially on Caraka, is a delight. The lectures mostly will be in Telugu and the speaker can summarise thegist of discussion in Hindi too. Further details are as follows -



Commencement of Lectures : 9th April, 2014

Time: 11:00 am to 1:00 pm
