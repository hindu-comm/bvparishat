Apte does not, it is an OCR error. Apte lists them as “10 U.” 10 stands for 10^(th) Gaṇa and U for Ubhayapadī. The notation is (in regular expression) –

((\[1-9\])\|10) \[APU\]

where the numbers denote the Gaṇa and A, P and U stand for Ātmanepadī, Parasmaipadī or Ubhayapadī.

Don’t trust the machines, refer the scanned version when in doubt.

In this regard I like the work of Universität zu Köln (<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/index.html>) where I can search digitally (which is much faster), and then click on the link to open the scan of the page (which is more reliable, especially with Śabdakalpadrumaḥ and Vācaspatyam as their Sanskrit OCR is not as accurate as the English one). That way I get the best of both worlds – search with digital speed and read with human accuracy, though access speed is still a barrier with (takes a couple of seconds to load the PDF even on 100 Mbps connection).
