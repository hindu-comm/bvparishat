Dear Friends I received the following posting from Drs. David and Nancy Reigle

"Regarding Kamaleswar Bhattacharya, someone had posted a question about whether his French book on the Atman in Buddhism had been translated into English. It has. We contacted him many years ago about this, wondering about it, and then offering to prepare it for publication. He sent us the English translation that someone had made for him, and that he had revised extensively. Nancy typeset it for publication, and he again made a number of corrections and revisions to the typeset text. This took years. We were just awaiting his index, but otherwise it was ready for publication. We just now applied to join Bharatiya Vidvat Parisat, in order to post this information. But since we are not Indians, and we live in the United States, perhaps we will not be able to join this Google Group. In any case, we wanted to let you know. We also wanted to thank you for posting about his passing, which we did not know of. It had been a year or so since we last heard from him."
