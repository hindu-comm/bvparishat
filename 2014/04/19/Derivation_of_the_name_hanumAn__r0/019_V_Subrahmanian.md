Thanks for the uttarakANDa verses. There are these two verses too subsequently:  
  
ततो गिरौ पपात एष इन्द्रवज्राभिताडितः ।  

पतमानस्य चैतस्य वामो हनुरभज्यत ॥  
  

Here, the injury caused *while* falling is stated.  

  

तस्मिंस्तु पतिते बाले वज्रताडनविह्वले ।  

कुक्रोध इन्द्राय पवनः प्रजानामहिताय सः ॥  
  

Here, the unsettled, falling, of Hanuman, owing to the vajra-striking is stated.  

  

Then in the 36th sarga,  
  

मत्करोत्सृषटवज्रेण हनुरस्य यथा हतः ।  

नाम्ना वै कपिशार्दूलो भविता हनुमानिति ॥ ११ ॥  
  

In this verse, Indra says: Because his cheek (hanu) has been injured/wounded by the hurling the vajra weapon by me, this exceptionally good kapi will be known as 'hanumAn'. Here 'abhajyata' is not used but 'hataH' is used. And the reason for his getting that name is also clearly stated.  

  
  
अहमस्य प्रदास्यामि परमं वरमद्भुतम् ।  
इतः प्रभृति वज्रस्य ममावध्यो भविष्यति ॥ १२ ॥   
  

Pacifying vAyu, Indra grants a boon to Hanuman: Henceforth Hanuman will be immune to my vajra weapon. That means 'now he has been wounded but henceforth he will not be affected.'
