Thanks for these links. In one dictionary (shabdakalpadruma) the word 'hiDimbAramaNaH' is given for the word 'hanumAn'.

but no mention of any hiDimbA in any way.  

  

One could check if BhIma had a name 'hanumAn' so as to justify the'hiDimbAramaNaH' entry in the listing shown at the top. This is just my guess.
