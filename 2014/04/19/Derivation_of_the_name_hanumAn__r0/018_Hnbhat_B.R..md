There is nothing wrong in the line. चाद् गिरौ निपातेन च, which means by च, it means "by falling over the top of the mountain". the recollection of the incidence of falling over the mountain in addition to the falling of Vajra. This makes clear, the meaning of भन्जो आमर्दे

  

m. crushing , handling roughly S3ak. MBh.  

  

than breaking into pieces, as we understand from the usage of भङ्ग, derived from the same root, which is used to mean the part, or piece. the part Hanu broken away. It left only a prominent mark on his cheek a distinguishable Hanu, which makes him having प्रशस्तहनु. Also any of the meanings of Matup applicable to his Hanu.

  

This is what the commentators got the meaning. This also meant later वज्रस्य च निपातेन, only Vajra struck forcibly on the cheek, but the cheek was not broken into pieces or cut away from the face or at least had no effect than leaving a mark. "विरुजम्". Of course, the verbal form can be derived from the verb भज् सेवायाम् as done by the commentator Sri Ramabhadracharya.

  

This is my sincere opinion and is not intended to challenge the commentary by Sri Ramabhadracharya.

  

The other usages of simply भङ्ग without breaking into two, भ्रूभङ्गलीलानियमितशरधिं राममन्वेषयामि, by the gesture of curving the brows, Rama, who controlled the ocean. a sign of anger. And अङ्गभङ्ग as gesture, of refreshing, one's body without breaking the sense of breaking the limps apart.
