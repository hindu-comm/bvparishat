Thank you for raising the question. For authentic explanation, we may have to test Hanuman himself or ask somebody who treated Hanuman whether it is chek or jaw that was swollen. We can get the report of Valmiki, who would say only hanu was hit 

  

Here is the report by जाम्बवत् to remind him of his birth and power about the incident

  

अभ्युत्थितं ततः सूर्यं बालो दृष्ट्वा महावने ।

फलं चेति जिघृक्षुस्त्वमुत्प्लुत्याभ्युद्गतो दिवम् ।। 4.66.20 ।।

शतनि त्रीणि गत्वा ऽथ योजनानां महाकपे ।  

तेजसा तस्य निर्धूतो न विषादं गतस्ततः ।। 4.66.21 ।।

तावदापततस्तूर्णमन्तरिक्षं महाकपे ।  

क्षिप्तमिन्द्रेण ते वज्रं क्रोधाविष्टेन धीमता ।। 4.66.22 ।।

तदा शैलाग्रशिखरे *वामो हनुरभज्यत ।*

*ततो हि नामधेयं ते हनुमानिति कीर्त्यते ।। 4.66.23 ।।*

We do not know whether it is cheek or jaw meant by Hanuman.

  

  

The same dictionary gives:

  

हिडिम्बा hiDimbA f. wife of hanumat  

  

As we know हिडिम्बा was a demoness who married Bhima and Hanuman is a batchelor, ब्रह्मचारी ever.
