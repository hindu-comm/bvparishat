You are right. Two lexicons also give this as synonyms of Hanuman.

  

हिडिम्बापतिः, पुं, (हिडिम्बायाः पतिः ।) हनू-

मान् । इति शब्दरत्नावली\|

  

हिडिम्बारमणः, पुं, (हिडिम्बाया रमणः ।) हनू-

मान् । इति त्रिकाण्डशेषः ॥

  

But the word हिडिम्बजित् is used as synonym for भीमसेन. May be some version of Bengali Vaishnava school identifying भीम and हनूमान् both are पवनपुत्र-s and वैष्णव-s as such. The writer of त्रिकाण्डशेष, पुरुषोत्तमदेव belonged to Bengal. There may be some story to support this epithet to Hanuman, taking Hidimba away from the story from Mahabharata story as two lexicographers list this as husband of Hidimba, synonym of Hanuman.

  

Any help may be there in the commentaries on Hanuman Chalisa, provided by Nityananda.
