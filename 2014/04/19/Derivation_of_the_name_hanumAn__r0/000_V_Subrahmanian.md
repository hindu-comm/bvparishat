Namaste

  

Is there any authentic (purANic/other) text which gives the reason why Anjaneya is called 'hanumAn'? This dictionary page gives several meanings for the word 'hanu' like jaw, tooth, cheek:

  

<http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&beginning=0+&tinput=+hanu&trans=Translate&direction=AU>  

  

There is a story that says that Indra dealt a blow with his vajra weapon to the young Anjaneya and thus the name owing to a swollen jaw/cheek.

  

Any authoritative explanation is welcome.
