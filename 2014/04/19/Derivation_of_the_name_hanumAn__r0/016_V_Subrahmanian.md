These words seem to be of Ravana and not of sItA:

While from the VR narration it is not clear (at least to me) why Indra comes into the picture, in this book, one could see some information on this:  
  
<http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nmmkM0fVS-cC&pg=PA629&lpg=PA629&dq=hanuman+and+other+puranas&source=bl&ots=B46aHZnNj7&sig=PSD0Fv9anJ7ozj3PDr_8fcRrVuA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l6ZSU4_gGYGNrQeP9IDADg&ved=0CIEBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&q=hanuman%20and%20other%20puranas&f=false>  

  

In the above link there is an assortment of puranic/other sources from where the story of Hanuman is culled out. 

  

Here are some verses from the VR on the topic:

  

शतानि त्रीणि गत्वा ऽथ योजनानां महाकपे ।

  
तेजसा तस्य निर्धूतो न विषादं गतस्ततः ।। 4.66.21 ।।  
  
  
तावदापततस्तूर्णमन्तरिक्षं महाकपे ।  
क्षिप्तमिन्द्रेण ते वज्रं क्रोधाविष्टेन धीमता ।। 4.66.22 ।।

  

On page 230 of the google book referred above there appears to be a missing link (in the VR here) supplied: Hanuman, having receded from his advancing (towards Sun), comes down (tAvadApatataH) and enters the antarikSha loka. Here the google book story supplies: Hanuman encountered rAhu, appearing bigger than Sun. He sees Indra's Airavata and decides to eat it. Indra is infuriated at this. This point is not present in the VR narration and hence the question: why did Indra come into the picture? is not readily answered.  

  
  
तदा शैलाग्रशिखरे वामो हनुरभज्यत ।  
ततो हि नामधेयं ते हनुमानिति कीर्त्यते ।। 4.66.23 ।।

  

Hanuman is at the top of the Mountain. So, from antarikSha, he is on land, on top of the mountain, upon being hit by Indra's weapon, on the left chin/cheek.  

  
ततस्त्वां निहतं दृष्ट्वा वायुर्गन्धवहः स्वयम् ।  
त्रैलोक्ये भृशसङ्क्रुद्धो न ववौ वै प्रभञ्जनः ।। 4.66.24 ।।  
  
  

सम्भ्रान्ताश्च सुराः सर्वे त्रैलोक्ये क्षोभिते सति ।  
प्रसादयन्ति सङ्क्रुद्धं मारुतं भुवनेश्वराः ।। 4.66.25 ।।  
  
  
प्रसादिते च पवने ब्रह्मा तुभ्यं वरं ददौ ।  
अशस्त्रवध्यतां तात समरे सत्यविक्रम ।। 4.66.26 ।।  
  
  
वज्रस्य च निपातेन विरुजं त्वां समीक्ष्य च ।  
सहस्रनेत्रः प्रीतात्मा ददौ ते वरमुत्तमम् ।। 4.66.27 ।।   
  
Here, the tilaka commentary says:

वज्रस्य निपातेन चाद्गिरौ निपातेन च । विरुजं तज्जनितपीडाभाववन्तम् तेनाप्यनुत्पादितव्यथमिति यावत् ।। 4.66.28,29 ।। \[there seems to be some mistake in the highlighted first word. In any case Hanuman falls to/on the mountain having been hit by the vajra.   

  
स्वच्छन्दतश्च मरणं ते भूयादिति वै प्रभो ।  
स त्वं केसरिणः पुत्रः क्षेत्रजो भीमविक्रमः ।। 4.66.28 ।।

  

Here, Hanuman is given the boon of svacchandamRtyu, similar to the one BhiShma had received from his father Shantanu. In the google book story we see Brahma giving Hanuman the boon of life till the tenure of brahma.
This appears to explain the chinranjIvi status that was discussed in another thread in this forum.   
  
मारुतस्यौरसः पुत्रस्तेजसा चापि तत्समः ।  
त्वं हि वायुसुतो वत्स प्लवने चापि तत्समः ।। 4.66.29 ।।

I do not quite understand the connection between the name HanumAn and suShumnA nADI and hanumAn's own achievement.
