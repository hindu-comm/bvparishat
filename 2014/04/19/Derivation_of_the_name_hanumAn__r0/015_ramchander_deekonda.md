vidvadbhyo namaH,

  

I reproduce a paragraph from a scholarly exposition of Ramayana by Shri Guntur Seshendra Sarma in his acclaimed work titled "ramayaNa rahasyAlu". I am sure it would throw some more light on the subject.

  

".......Thus, Sita having sighted Hanuman in a Saiva personification (*aho! bhImam aho! rUpam*) she understood *HanumAn* to be none other than *nandikesvara*. (cf: *kim esha bhagavAn nandI bhavet sAkSAd ihAgataH)*. The intention of *vAlmIki* may please be understood. In *sundara kanDa* 35:82 we find a statement of *HanumAn* as "*hanumAn iti vikhyAto loke svenaiva karmaNA*". But, what is the deed he has accomplished is not given there. Thus, his deed has been left to our imagination. In *kishkinda kAnDa*, *jAmbhavAn* informs his*janma vRttAnta* to *HanumAn*. " *kshiptram indreNa te vajram krodhAvishTena dhImatA; tataH sailAgra sikhare vAmo hanurabhajyata, tato hi nAma dheyante hanumAn iti kIrtyate: (* 66: 23 and 24) (HanumAn presumed the rising Sun to be a fruit and tried to swallow it. On this Indra got enraged and threw his vajra at him which broke his left jaw. Hence the epithet HanumAn) How can we reconcile this to the previous statement of *HanumAn?* To do that would be an example of foolishness. *HanumAn* means one who has jaws or who has his left jaw broken. Is it not so? Therefore, this definition does not fit here. It is meaningless to name someone as 'with jaws'. *Hanumat* means the one with jaws. But who is that? "*antareNa tAluke ya eshastana iva Alambate - sendrayoniH" (iti taittirIyam)* that which is'smi dangling between two *tAlukas* is *sushumna;* and that is the *brahmadvAra*. Therefore, does not *tAlukAvat* refers to *sushumna?* That is the meaning of *HanumAn. HanumAn* asmasculine gender has become the proper name. **It is befitting to name a *yogi as sushumna.* Therfore, *Hanuma* is a *yogi*.
Now, the statement *"hanumAn iti vikhyAto loke svenaiva karmaNA"* is beautiful and clearly convincing. ..."

  

This is my translation from " ShoDasi RamAyaNa RahasyAlu" of G Seshendra Sarma.
