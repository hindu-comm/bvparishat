I think this is a kliShTakalpana. Without the api the verse gives a straight meaning and without taking the word as 'ahataH'. Is there any pAtha available that way? Unless one wants to somehow force the intended interpretation, there is absolutely no difficulty in that verse. And it is also clear that one has to struggle to interpret this verse in this way so as to somehow align it with the kishkindha kAnda verse containing abhajyata for which the seva artha was given.  
  

There is a reading:  
  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/ramayana/valmiki.htm>  
मत्करोत्सृष्टवज्रेण हनुरस्य यथा क्षतः \|  
नाम्नैष कपिशार्दूलो भविता हनुमानिति \|\| ११\|\|  
  

It is easy to make it 'akShataH' and derive the meaning one wants.

In fact the verses:

  
  
ततो गिरौ पपात एष इन्द्रवज्राभिताडितः ।  
पतमानस्य चैतस्य वामो हनुरभज्यत ॥  
  

Here, the injury caused *while* falling is stated.  

  

तस्मिंस्तु पतिते बाले वज्रताडनविह्वले ।  
कुक्रोध इन्द्राय पवनः प्रजानामहिताय सः ॥  
  

clearly show that owing to Indra's attack, Hanuman fell on the mountain and while/upon falling he was injured. It could be argued, upon seeing the uttarakanda verses, that the vajra did not even touch the cheek; it only caused his fall and maybe because his cheek contacted a boulder, owing to the vajratADana vihvala, got injured. So, the idea that the hanu was worshipped/seva by the vajra does not fit here. Even if one wants to save Hanuman's cheek from injury, there is no way that one can establish that Hanuman did not fall owing to the vajra-attack. That Hanuman became unsettled and fell owing to the vajra attack infuriated Vayu against Indra is also clear from the verse. One's purpose of saving Hanuman from Indra's attack will not get fulfilled by these explicit verses of Hanuman's fall owing to the attack. And it would be extremely unreasonable to argue that despite the fall, unsettlement, and the injury stated by the verses, that the cheek did not get injured. Those who are against Hanuman's cheek being injured are also not happy with the awkward fall of Hanuman owing to the attack. And also about the portrayal of Hanuman as a child-prankster trying to catch the rising sun 'thinking' it to be a fruit, and then getting distracted by rAhu, and then again distracted by the Airavata. There is no other cause decipherable for the fall other than the vajra attack. So to argue that the cheek did not get injured/affected while also not trying to save hanuman from the fall admitting the awkward fall due to the attack is akinchitkaram, in my opinion.  
  

Also here are two more verses of the uttarakANDa 35th sarga:  
  
पुत्रस्तस्यामरेशेन इन्द्रेणाद्य निपातितः \|  
राहोर्वचनमाज्ञाय राज्ञा वः कोपितोऽनिलः \|\| ५९\|\|  
ततः प्रजाभिः सहितः प्रजापतिः  
सदेवगन्धर्वभुजङ्गगुह्यकः \|  
जगाम तत्रास्यति यत्र मारुतः  
सुतं सुरेन्द्राभिहतं प्रगृह्य सः \|\| ६४\|\|

  

And I do not find any great purpose served by saving Hanuman from such a supposed ignominy.  

  
  
पाणिनीयतन्त्रे मतुबादयः प्रत्ययाः क्षत्यर्थे न भवन्ति। ते तु भूम्नि, निन्दायां, प्रशंसायां, नित्ययोगे, अतिशायने, संबन्धे/संसर्गे, अस्तिविवक्षायां वा भवन्ति। अत्र मतुप् भूम्नि न कृतः, यतो हनुमतो बहवो हनवो न सन्ति। निन्दायामपि न, यतो हि कदाऽपि हनुमतो हनुः निन्दितो नाभवत्। नित्ययोगेऽपि न, यतो हि सर्वेऽपि कपयः हनुभ्यां नित्ययुक्ताः। एवमेव संबन्धे/संसर्गे अस्तिविवक्षायामपि मतुप् न युक्तिसम्मतः। अतिव्याप्तिदोषात्। अत एवात्र प्राशस्त्ये अतिशायने वा मतुप्स्वीकर्तव्यः। “प्रशस्तो हनुरस्य”। “अतिशयितो हनुरस्य” वा। उभयत्र वज्रप्रहारेण हनुक्षतिः न सङ्गच्छते। मते हनुक्षतौ च विनयपत्रिकायां तुलसीदासवचनं निरर्थकं भवतीत्यमतिपल्लवितेन।  
  

There is an impression that there are many a-pANinian usages by Valmiki.

In a verse in the uttarakANDa, 35th sarga Indra vows to kill Hanuman for the misdemeanor explained in the earlier verses.  
  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/ramayana/valmiki.htm>  
  
राहोर्विक्रोशमानस्य प्रागेवालक्षितः स्वरः \|  
श्रुत्वेन्द्रोवाच मां भैषीरयमेनं निहन्म्यहम् \|\| ४३\|\|  
  

And then is the sequence shown here, in continuation of the above:  
  
  

एवमाधावमानं तु नातिक्रुद्धः शचीपतिः \|  
हस्तान्तेनातिमुक्तेन *कुलिशेनाभ्यताडयत्* \|\| ४६\|\|

There is nothing to show in this verse that the vajra even touched the cheek.  

ततो गिरौ पपातैष इन्द्रवज्राभिताडितः \|  
पतमानस्य चैतस्य वामो *हनुरभज्यत* \|\| ४७\|\|

That the assault caused Hanuman to fall and while falling his left cheek was injured is what is clear here. If the cheek was not broken and the vajra did not cause it, there is no prasakti for the kAvya to invoke the part hanu and then coin the name hanumAn.  A mere falling caused by the vajra and nothing at all happening to Hanuman would not warrant the VR to coin the name and declare it as something that would become popular.
  

  
  
So, Indra's intention while hurling the vajra on Hanuman was to kill him. But it caused Hanuman to fall and the cheek was injured. That is the meaning one gets from the verses, without trying to doctor them.
Therefore, the boon is in assuaging Vayu's wrath and saying: *mama vajrasya* avadhyaH bhaviShyati. Without that qualification, the boon is meaningless. This is because Indra wanted to kill Hanuman. This is my thinking.
