अकारप्रश्लेष and multiple meanings of roots are very common and basic principles used in interpretation in many commentaries. There is nothing क्लिष्ट about them for scholars who have some advanced knowledge of grammar. सिद्धान्तकौमुदी does it in case of नाज्झलौ (PS 1-1-10), where भट्टोजी takes दीर्घ आकार and प्लुत अकार as प्रश्लिष्ट to get deeper meanings. लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी does not do this, as it is for learners who may find सिद्धान्तकौमुदी क्लिष्ट. Many commentators resort to multiple meanings of roots, including that of हन्. An example is विषमविलोचनस्य वक्ष आजघ्ने in Kirata 17.63) where commentaries explain आहन् as "to strike" and not "to injure or maim". But some people find even किरात epic and Mallinatha to be क्लिष्ट, it is not a fault of भारवि or Mallinatha.  
  
Often our minds are conditioned with regard to पदच्छेद by what we read (in books or manuscripts), rather than what we hear - traditionally शास्त्र was heard from Guru which does not condition the mind in this way. And anyway old manuscripts in Sanskrit did not use spacing.

I do not buy this argument - firstly it cites a mailgroup conversation. Secondly, those who claim that VR has many non-Paninian usages completely discount the fact that many commentaries on VR explain the so-called non-Paninian usages in a perfectly Paninian framework. Finally, those claiming so neither attempt a Paninian interepretation, nor an interpretation from any other grammar - they are not even sure which grammar (Aindra, Caandra, etc) is followed in VR. In absence of other resorts, the discipline of Paninian grammar is our only guide.

There is no doctoring - only an interpretation of a गूढार्थ. For those who find गूढार्थ doctored, they are better off sticking to the सरलार्थ. There are many who do not understand गूढार्थ of मानिषाद प्रतिष्ठां verse explained in multiple ways than commentaries, they are better off taking it as शापात्मक.
