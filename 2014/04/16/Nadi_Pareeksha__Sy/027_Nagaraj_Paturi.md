The quotedphrase is found in Kathopanishad.



शतं चैका च हृदयस्य नाड्य\\-

स्तासां मूर्धानमभिनिःसृ‍तैका ।

तयोर्ध्वमायन्नमृ‍तत्वमेति

विष्वङ्ङान्या उत्क्रमणे भवन्ति ॥ 2-3-16॥



In Shankarabhashya the एका has been taken as Sushumna. Since Sushumna is a subjective reality butnot an objective, material entity, the remaining शतं, हृदयःand the process ofअभिनिःसृतिshould also be taken as subjective facts rather than objective, material entities. हृदयः is theentity located near अनाहतand the locus operandi ofअंगुष्ठमात्रपुरुषwhich is again a subjective universal fact like the above ones.
