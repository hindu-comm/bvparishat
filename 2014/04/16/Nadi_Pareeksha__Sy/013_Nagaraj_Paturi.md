Hope this article in an Ayurvedic journal will be of some help to you.

  

You seem to know Telugu. Basavarajeeyamu, main source of this article is a Telugu book. That itself is a compilation from several ancient works.

  

The oft-quoted Sarpagati, Mandookagati stuff seems to be from Sarngadhara Sanhita. I have the pdf in Telugu script. It has a very brief discussion on Nadipariksha.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
