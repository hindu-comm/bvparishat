Mr. Mārcis,  
  

Dr. Raghavan is a frequent traveler and he organizes medical camps for the mercury/endosulfan effected villages. Someone has to inform him about his emails. I hope, other scholars that you wrote to, may respond too.

Its really interesting to observe that the seminal texts in Ayurveda, as you mentioned, do not have any clear references to nāḍīparīkṣā. I heard this from scholars during some lectures. I do not know whether precisely this is the reason to argue that pulse examination is the contribution of Buddhist monks (around 8th C.) in India. Most of the Vedic (not Vedas, as per mīmāṃsakas!) and allied literature has been written in sūtra style (though, Caraka followed both verse and prose). The concept of sūtra is six kinds in Vyakarana and four types in Ayurveda. I firmly believe that the āyurvedasaṃhitās are contemporary to Upanishadic literature, at least. This is based on the style of dialogs. Further,
Ayurveda is believed to be an *upaveda* of Atharva Veda. As, the nature of sūtra is to maintain precision and it brevity one has to go through entire Caraka Samhitā, along with Cakrapani commentary, to explore the hidden links to pulse examination. Parallelly, if one looks at Yoga sūtras, except a sūtra (2.46) nothing is elaborated upon āsanas. Nowadays, a whole lot of āsanas are being taught based on 'Haṭhayogapradīpikā', 'Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā' etc. But can we argue that the Yoga sūtras consist nothing related to āsanas, except that of 2.46? The same is the case with nāḍīparīkṣā.  
  

Sri Sivakumar has pointed out an interesting episode. Hence, references to the neuro-dynamics of 'mudrās' was not a strange thing in ancient India. In similar lines, I assume it for pulse examination too.  

  

Thanks,  
Prasad
