Dear Sir/Madam,

  

Many scholars of Ayurveda hold the view that the Bruhattrayee of Ayurveda does not contain any reference to the Nadees as such and the Nadees could be the invention of the Tantrikas who were expert in anatomy.The claim could be investigated into and supported with research. There are many Sanskrit Texts termed as Nadeepareekshaa(by Raavana etc.),but,no definite answer to prove/disprove this claim seems to be given.

Any light on this would be welcome.

Thanks and regards,

  

Siddharth Wakankar(91-9427339942).
