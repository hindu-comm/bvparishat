1.There are many aspects of actual practice of Ayurveda that do not find a direct mention in Brihattrayi. Nadipariksha is one among those.



2 Many skill fields are hard to document. Nadipariksha is one such. S'aarngadharasamhita and others are attempts to achieve this difficult task.

There is a rhyme and rhythm in the intuitive subjective knowledge. Sri Rani Sadashivamurthy Mahodaya and such other bhishagvaras know more
just in the form of skill/intuitionthan what they are able to articulate.



3.Notions involved in Nadipariksha are closer to Svarayoga than to Tantra.



4\. Tamil Siddha tradition /Tamil Siddha medicine also has Nadipariksha. One of the sources of thepresent Ayurvedic practice could be this too.



5..Nadipariksha is said to beused in veterinary Ayurveda also. My elders used to tell me that use of Nadipariksha is more for the diagnosis in animals, dumb humans etc., than for humans who can speak.
