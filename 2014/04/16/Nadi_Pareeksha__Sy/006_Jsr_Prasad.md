Namaste.  
Let me take liberty to say something, before an Ayurvedic doctor responds.  
  

First of all, I appreciate your interest in this topic. As Prof. Meulenbeld has pointed out, historically, it is believed that, Rāvaṇa is said to be the first author on Nāḍīśāstra. But I am not sure about Kaṇāda's text and whether he is one and the same as the founder of Vaiśeṣika school of philosophy. For your question \<**Is there an authoritative****nadi vaidya (an ayurvedic doctor who specializes in reading the pulse) living nowadays**?\> the answer is yes! I personally know Vaidyaratnam Dr. Raghavan of Kerala. He is a great authority of this science. He says that pulse is your "résumé and it is also 'orchestra of one's life. By deeply studying this science, it is not only possible to predict the diseases/symptoms of diseases, but also the past and future of the diagnosed. It is astonishing to note that a great exponent of nāḍī, can even go back to the previous births (as strongly believed in our tradition). But this can be achieved only on certain prescribed days according to Dr. Raghavan. There seems to be more than one nāḍī, say, nine nāḍīs. You may be interested to read his paper in the June 2012 issue (Vol. 47, No. 2) of INSA journal. It is titled 'Patient-centered Therapy of Ayurveda Approaches and Applications' which consists some valuable information. You may also want to visit visit doctor's website at \<<http://dathathreya-ayurveda.com/default.htm>\> and his email id is \<[drrag...@gmail.com]()\>.  
  

Next, \<"**The issue is that the scholar does not mention which are the major ones**">. I don't think, there are any major or minor texts considered here. For instance, the doctor who I referred to, follows Dattatreya tradition.  

  

Then, \<**Is there a good book on the subject?**\>. Bookish knowledge is only for jñāna but nor for 'vijñāna' please. I say so because,
nāḍīśāstra has certain nuances and subtleties. However, I presume, you just wanted to know the subject matter in this case.  
  

In Hyderabad, there is Dr. Rangacharyulu who practices nāḍī. He practices at a place called Kacheguda in Hyderabad. But he is also grown old. Of course, I never met him personally. Further information on nāḍī experts: Dr. G.G. Gangadharan is the medical director of Institute of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, Bangalore. He is also an enthusiastic exponent of pulse examination. He can be reached at \<[vaidya...@frlht.org]()\>. Once I heard Prof. [M.A. Lakshmi Thathachar](http://www.samskrti.org/chief.shtml) saying about Dr. Rangamannar (if I correctly recall the name), another expert of nāḍī in/near Bangalore. You may like to clarify things from him.  

  

You've referred to Dr. Vasant Lad's book. By the way, Dr. Lad has put up an informative video on '*marmas'* in you tube.  

  
Regards  

Prasad
