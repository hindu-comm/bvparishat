Namaste.



Thanks indeed for this news-making work. This I think isthe most detailed work and the only work specially focussed on the topicso far on Nadipariksha.



This is a more holistic diagnostics centered around Nadipariksha and merely limited to Nadipariksha.



Transliteration into Devanagari might render wider use of the work.



The author श्रीमदळहतिरुमल माडभूषिश्रीनिवासाचार्युलु says:



नानामुनीनानां वचनै रिदानीं समानतासद्भिषजाभ्योगात्

सोपद्रवारिष्टनिदानलिंगान्निगद्यते दोषविनिश्चयोयं



No names of previous works seem to have been quoted.



Thanks again,



Nagaraj
