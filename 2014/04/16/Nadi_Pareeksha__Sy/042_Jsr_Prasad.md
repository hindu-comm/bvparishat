True. But unfortunately, I don't have immediate access to it. I gathered this information Prof. Manikya Sharma, when he used to visit us, sometime in May '14. I do not have a photostat copy of it, either. Otherwise, i'd have shared it with you. Let me explore more in this direction, that can be helpful. Next, I am thinking of an alternative way in acquiring the book. A renowned Sanskrit scholar, 'Padmashri' Prof. Ramakanta Shukla was the editor-in-chief of the 2 vol set of Vishnusahasranama of Pt. Satyadeva. You may want to ask the scholars of BVP to get his contact, through which a link can be established to reach the family of Pt. Satyadeva in Bhiwani, in order to acquire नाडीतत्त्वदर्शनम् । Hope, this may be of some use.
