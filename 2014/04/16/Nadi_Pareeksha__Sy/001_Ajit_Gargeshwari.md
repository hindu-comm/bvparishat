Nadi shastra belongs to that branch of aurveda which will be used by a doctor for diagnosis taking pulse. An aurvedic doctor reads pulse in a different way than an Alopathic doctor, several books have been written on the subject Nadi Vijnana: Ancient Pulse Science by Upadhyaya and Dr. Sarva Deva  

All Aurvedic doctors read nadi and its not lost in Taxasila. So your best bet would be to to ask a Aurvedic doctor or read related books to find more information.  

Aurvedic doctors on this list may respond
