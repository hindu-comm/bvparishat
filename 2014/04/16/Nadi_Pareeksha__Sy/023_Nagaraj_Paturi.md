Dear Sri Bhat,

Thanks for the timelymoderation. Without such intervention, there is always a chance of deviation from the focus.



But did not the very first message from the initiator of the thread focus on practice?



He asked:



"Is there an authoritativenadi vaidya (an ayurvedic doctor who specialises in **reading the pulse**) living nowadays?"



It was nadipariksha "reading the pulse" that was in focus, not nadivijnan in general.



Only in a later message, the initiator says:



In thic case jñāna would be enough as I'm looking for a text to translate some part of it as an addition to an ayurvedic Sanskrit reader in Russian.



Still the focus is nadipariksha only.



Brihattrayi 's discussion of Nadis in general is known. When people say those major three works do not discuss, they are talking about Nadipariksha.



Text of Sarngadharasamhita discusses Nadipariksha directly. Text of Basavarajiyamu does the same. But in both books,Nadipariksha forms a part. The books are not totally dedicated to Nadipariksha.Theinfo on a book fully dedicated to Nadipariksha alone, will be a newsmaker.Texts of Sarngadharasamhita and Basavarajiyamu were discussed in the thread before the respectable contribution by Bhishagvara Sri Sadashivamurthy . Male and female Nadis, Sarpagati, Mandookagathi etc mentioned in his contribution were already part of Sarngadharasanhita and Basavarajiyamu discussion.



The Bhishakji, did add Charaka's discussion. But that was Nadis not Nadipariksha.



Trying to trace the source of Nadipariksha to Buddhism ( by Prof. Prasad) , to Tantra ( by Sri Siddharth Wakankar) , to Svarayoga and/or Tamil Siddha( by Nagaraj) were all part of trying to grapple with the question why the texts of Brihattrayi do not discuss Nadipariksha.



The scarcity of detailed texts on Nadipariksha was being explained in the form of difficulty in the documentation of skill-fields such as Nadipariksha.



Anyway, let us hope the Ayurvedic doctor consulted willbe able to contribute the list of relevant books on the focus of the thread initiator.



Thanks again, for a timely moderation.



Regards,



Nagaraj
