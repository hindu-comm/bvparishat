Respected Scholars

  

I am not sure whether this question is directly related to the topic of this thread.

I wanted to know, whether the term Naadee referred to by Upanishad Texts and Aaranyaka/ Brahmana Texts is the same as the Naadee of the subject matter.

  

-   I wanted to know, whether those Shatam Chaika Hrudayasya Naadyah
    etc. are physical or meta physical, similar to Shat Chakra. -   If physical, Naadee can be translated as Nerve in English???

Regards
