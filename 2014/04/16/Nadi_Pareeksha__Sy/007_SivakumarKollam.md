SAdara praNAmam,  
  

Many authoritative works on NadisAstra are there in Tamil.  

There is an incident in the life of SriVidyAdhirAja Chattampi SwAmikal  

One of the saints from Kerala on meeting whom Swami Vivekananda  

referred as "remarkable".The incident is this:  

On his parivrAjaka period Vivekananda met VidyAdhirAja at Eranakulam  

in Kerala. They started conversing in Sanskrit, the common language of  

scholars at that time.Vivekananda enquired about the significance of famous  

Chinmudra. VidyAdhirAja explained the neuro dynamics of the mudra  
by quoting a passage in Tamil from an old commentary of BrihadAranyaka  

hearing which Vivekananda was astonished and remarked that SwAmiji has been  
asking the question to many scholars whom he met all along his travel  

through BhArat and didn't meet anyone who could answer the question to  

his satisfaction and VidyAdhirAja is a "remarkable" saint.Later SwAmiji directed  

his gurubhAyEs who visited Kerala to meet VidyAdhirAja  

The notable point is the knowledge of nAdIs provided by Tamil literature  

Namaste.
