I had been observing this thread from the beginning. The very request was to know whether there are any published or unpublished works on the subject on are available and the details of the works नाडी-विज्ञान, as the book referred to gave some titles and no more details of the books.

  

And the other related request is to sort the list of available books (if published) and details of manuscripts (if unpublished) solely devoted to नाडीविज्ञान as he names नाडीपरीक्षा according to major and minor works studied. And not the references in Ayurvedic Books or the practices he wanted to know (though he seems to be interested, his interest was to translate one of the major books into Russian or English).

  

Other details furnished by the contributors are interesting and really enjoying. His purpose of the request was as he could not a sorted list of the books on नाडीविज्ञान so that he could select one major work for translation into Russian/English. I could not see any pointed replies to his question, which expects either publication details and author etc. if published and if unpublished, the details of the manuscripts and its contents. Once again, any major works written on नाडीविज्ञान and not the major works in Ayurveda referring to or prescribing नाडीपरीक्षा in diagnosis. Since he could not find any book in the book he mentioned in the first post and the book on the History of Ayurveda Literature, the request was placed as I could understand from his several replies.

  

Just wanted to focus on the point of the request once again and not on the greatness and effectiveness of नाडीपरीक्षा in practice as I can see most of the replies are focusing. Only Dr. Sadashiva Murthy/s reply contains references to some names Caraka and its commentaries quoting them.

  

I have forwarded the request to one of my friend who is a Ayurvedic doctor with experience and presently doing MD with focus emphasized, so that he could prepare a list of available books in his library. No reply has been received yet. May be busy with his practice and studies.
