Respected Scholars,

I have been silently following the interesting postings of this thread. So I too would like to add some information. My father under whom we were taught in the field of Ayurveda was a great expert in Nadi Vijnana besides his expertise in Vedas, Vedangas, Puranas, various Sastras and other disciplines of ancient Indian Knowledge. Unfortunately he is no more now.

But his knowledge to some extent is with us in our family members in inherited form . So I would like to share some of the aspects of Nadi Vijnana in this present thread of postings as I could learn from my father.

1\. Reference to the number of Nadis:

  In the process of giving the details of anatomy Susruta gives the following details: त्वचस्सप्त, कलास्सप्त, आशयास्सप्त, धातवस्सप्त, सप्त शिराशतानि, पञ्च पेशीशतानि, द्वे दशोत्तरसन्धिशते, सप्तोत्तरं मर्मशतं, चतुर्विंशतिर्धमन्य:, त्रयो दोषा:, त्रयो मला:, नवस्रोतांसि, षोडशकण्डरा:, षोडश जालानि, षट् कूर्चा:, चतस्रो रज्जव:, सप्त शेवन्य:, चतुर्दश सङ्घाता:, चतुर्दशसीमन्ता:, द्वाविंशतिर्योगवहानि स्रोतांसि, द्विकान्यन्त्राणि चेति, सार्धत्रिकोटिरोमकूपाणि।

तत्रैव व्याख्याने कणादविरचितात् नाडीविज्ञानात् -

साधत्रिकोटिनद्यो हि स्थूलास्सूक्ष्माश्च देहिनाम्।

नाभिकन्दनिबद्धास्ता: तिर्यगूर्ध्वमधस्थिता:॥

In this manner total number of Nadis were specified in the ancient Indian Ayurvedic texts as equal to the number of hair pores in our body.

(Which is specified as: Three and half crore hair pores and Three and half crore Naidis). Accordingly in the later texts each hair pore is said to be the source of one Nadi.

तिस्र: कोट्यो.अर्थकोटी च यानि लोमानि मानुषे।

नाडीमुखानि सर्वाणि घर्मबिन्दुं क्षरन्ति च॥

कन्दमध्ये स्थिता नाडी सुष्म्नेति प्रकीर्तिता।

तिष्ठन्ति परितस्सर्वाश्च्क्रेऽस्मिऩ् नाडिकास्तथा॥

So SuShumna Nadi is said to be the source of all the Nadis.

  

2\. Testing the Nadis of Male and Female:

 While testing the Nadis for male the right hand is to be tested.

 For female the Nadis in their left hand should be tested. The reason for this is the Tortoise like Navel part (Nabhikurma) of men is facing downwards and the Nabhikurma of women is facing upwards in their natural structure. So the Nadi vyavastha or the Nadistructure of Male and Female is mutually in opposite direction. Hence while testing the right and left nadi systems are to be taken into consideration.

3\. Nadi as the life testing principle

The Nadi in the Angushtha (Thumb) is called JIVASAKHINI. It is the Witness of human life. So while determining the life of a person this NADI should be thoroughly tested.

  

4\. Synonyms and Names of Nadis:

स्नायुर्नाडी वसाहिंस्राधमनी धामनी धरा।

तन्तुकी जीवितज्ञा च सिरा पर्यायवाचका:॥

These are synonyms of NADI.

As far as the classification of Nadis is concerned:

Vata Nadi, Pitta Nadi, Sleshma Nadi and Sannipaata Nadi are the major Nadis.

5\. Nadis in a healthy body

The moment of Nadi in a healthy human body is similar to that of the moment of a stable snake. In a healthy person the Nadi is found with out any irritation in the mornings, some what hot at noon time and very rapid in gait in the evenings.

  

6\. Nadis in disease affected:

If the people are Vata dosha patients their nadi moves in a cyclic motion.

If they are affected by Pitta roga it is very much fickle.

If they are affected by Sleshma Roga their nadi is very slow and steady.

In combinations of Vata and Pitta or Vata and Sleshma and so on the Nadi also has a mixed gait.

In the Vatarogas the Nadi moves like a snake or leach.

In the Pitta roga it flies like a crow or a frog

In the Sleshma roga its moment is equal to that of a Peacock or swan or Dove or cock.

  

7\. Death prediction with the help of Nadi etc.

From the Nadi moment the death of the person also can be perfectly predicted. The time of prediction can be between one hour to six months depending on the pace and features of Nadi.

Similarly through Nadi Pariksha we can infer the life style and food habits of the human beings also.

These are a few aspects I could present here. There are many more which I can present along with textual authenticity.

Regards,
