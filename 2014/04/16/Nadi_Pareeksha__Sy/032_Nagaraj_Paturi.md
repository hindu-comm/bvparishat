This is great news!



More and more Nadipariksha sources are pouring in.



Omly recently Smt. Usha Sankaji posted the following in another related thread:



Namaste

For Telugu knowing people here is a treatise on nADI subject.. (stumbled on this while searching for something else.)  

It has Samskrt mUla-shlokas with Telugu meaning.

I responded to that as follows:



Namaste.



Thanks indeed for this news-making work. This I think isthe most detailed work and the only work specially focussed on the topicso far on Nadipariksha.



This is a more holistic diagnostics centered around Nadipariksha and merely limited to Nadipariksha.



Transliteration into Devanagari might render wider use of the work.



The author श्रीमदळहतिरुमल माडभूषिश्रीनिवासाचार्युलु says:



नानामुनीनानां वचनै रिदानीं समानतासद्भिषजाभ्योगात्

सोपद्रवारिष्टनिदानलिंगान्निगद्यते दोषविनिश्चयोयं



No names of previous works seem to have been quoted.



Thanks again,



Nagaraj

समानतासद्भिषजाभ्योगात् is समानत स्स द्भिषजाभियोगात्



Sorry for the typo.



Regards,



Nagaraj





I copied all that here since all that belongs here in this thread.



Now one more great news.



This research in this forum will go a long way in helping the research on Ayurvedic books in general and Nadipariksha books in particular.



Thanks.



Nagaraj
