It is interesting but not seemingly genuine. Nowadays, anything can be coined for popularity. Of course, there are some positive sides too, like SVYASA, Bangalore has coined 'Yajnopathy'. This is to test the effect of 'yajna' on environment and human beings with scientific studies.



Yes you are right. I agree. I found it connected to the discussion.

The very doctor (not an MBBS/BAMS!) boasts that Nadipathy prescribes 100 types of treatments. It is irrelevant to include therapies like Foot spa therapy, Nail therapy, Ozone therapy, Smile Yoga/Taiji :(, and foreign therapies like Sujok, Acupuncture, Thai massage, Traditional Chinese therapy etc. under 'Nadipathy'. The doctor limits the scope of Rishis to 'doctors' only, while claiming this science to be 'older' than Ayurveda. There are lot of video testimonials. Anyone can pretend to be a patient cured from Nadipathy. Let us be aware!



There is no justification for the name, given the huge number of other things included.
