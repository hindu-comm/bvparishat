Namaste,

  

Sorry if it is the wrong place to ask, but after Taxasila has been destroyed, I rely upon this learned community, though the question is more about ayurveda than Sanskrit. Is there an authoritativenadi vaidya (an ayurvedic doctor who specialises in reading the pulse) living nowadays? I guess Dr. Naram could bear that name, but I'm nobody to decide. I have attached a chapter fromMeulenbeld's book on nadi shastras, but the issue is that the scholar does not mention which are the major ones. I would want to try to find them. Or find an expert. Or both. Is there a good book on the subject? Has there ever been an English or Hindi translation of at least some of them? Thank you so much for support over years, I rely upon you once more.

  

May the force be with you,

M.
