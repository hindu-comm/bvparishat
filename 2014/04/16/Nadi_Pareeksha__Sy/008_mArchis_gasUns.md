Namaskar,

  

Dr. Prasad, you returned me hope, thank you so much. I wrote toDr. Raghavan,Dr. G.G. Gangadharan andProf. M.A.Lakshmithathachar (aboutDr. Rangamannar). I'm not sure if I've located the right[Dr. Rangacharyulu](http://www.indiaonapage.com/Abids/Doctor/itemdetail-94130/Dr-Rangacharyulu-N-C.htm) (Kachiguda, Hyderabad).

I mean if one has Charaka he can manage without Ashtanga or vice versa. Some texts that have influenced others.

In thic case jñāna would be enough as I'm looking for a text to translate some part of it as an addition to an ayurvedic Sanskrit reader in Russian. So as I should no cut off an arm of a guru for the sake of the book I'm asking for scriptures. And yes, I understand that in this topic it's not of the practical value, still. Wonder what tradition does Dr. Lad follows, must be something around Pune, maybe. A very detailed and interesting answer.

Sivakumar, the story is interesting, too bad that my Tamil is worse than my Telugu which is worse than my Old Iranian.
