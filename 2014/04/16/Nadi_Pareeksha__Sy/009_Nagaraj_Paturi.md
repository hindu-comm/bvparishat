Namaskar,



Since you said you are currently interested in the jnana part only, I do not know whether it makes sense to tell you the following:



Dr. Rangachari 's son is now practising in his father's clinic using the same method. The clinic is called Ayurvedakalamandiram. They have a



website <http://ayurvedakalamandiram.com/>



There is a huge number of Ayurvedic practitioners continuing with Nadi pareeksha method, in my knowledge. But the diagnosis is usually only to the extent of relative levels of Vaata, Pitta, Sleshma/Kapha.But Dr. Rangachari or his sonlist avery big number of symptoms to the patient, asking him "These are your symptoms. Do you agree or are there any differences in your actual experience?" In almost all the cases, the amazed patient says "You are right. Nothing more, nothing less". For this, the patient needs to go very early in the morning with empty stomach. Then there is the prescription and the remaining course of treatment.For the rest of the course of treatment, the early morning empty stomach visit is not essential.



The Maharshi Ayurveda doctors ( mostly disciples of Late Sri Balraj Maharshi) also follow Nadi Pareeksha. One Dr. Raju is practising in Sahara Estate, Hyderabad. VaidyaDr. J R Raju of Delhi is another one talked about for success with Nadi Pareeksha practice.



Namate.
