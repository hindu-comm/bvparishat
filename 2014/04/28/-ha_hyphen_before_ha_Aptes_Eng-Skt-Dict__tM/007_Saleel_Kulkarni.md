नमो नमः।



As regards the representation of र्‍+ह्‍ as र्‍ह्‌ by Prof Apte in his dictionary, I wish to present my thoughts as under.



A. In the discussion under the topic 'English Spelling of Sanskrit Word' Prof. Korada had supplied the following information.



Recently there have been serious discussions regarding the pronunciation of words like -



अपराह्णः , मध्याह्नः , ब्रह्म , बाह्यम् , ह्रासः, प्रह्लादः , आह्वानम्
etc. .



The matter is discussed in शिक्षाग्रन्थाः --



हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तम् अन्तस्थाभिश्च संयुतम् ।

औरस्यं तं विजानीयात् कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम् ॥ पाणिनीयशिक्षा



ङ - ञ - ण - न - म -- are वर्गपञ्चमाः । य - र- ल- वाः अन्तस्थाः ।



Examples are given . Here, in all, the हकार is to be pronounced as if it is the second letter . The sound should emanate from the उरस् (chest).



We come across people , even scholars , pronouncing in the same order as they are written. It is due to lack of knowledge of शिक्षा ।



Here is कौण्डिन्यशिक्षा -



हकारान्नणमा ऊर्ध्वाः पूर्वं तु प्रसरन्ति हात् ।



The letters न , ण and म , which are seen next to हकार , would come in the first place .



----------



B. To this Nanasaheb had objected. He said,



Prima facie, the verse in the Pāṇinīyaśikṣāthat has been cited–

हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्तस्थाभिश्च संयुतम्।

औरस्यं तं विजानीयात् कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम्॥ १६ ॥

talks about the pronunciation of the consonant “h”, under certain specific conditions, as a pure pulmonic consonant (औरस्य) without any effort from the glottis (कण्ठ). This verse does not talk about reversing the order of pronunciation (hm -> mh, hn -> nh, hr -> rh, etc) in those conditions.



-------



C. I think the point “if पाणिनीय शिक्षा supported the convention that the हकार should be pronounced as if it is the second letter”, was not settled.



D. I am sincerely interested in knowing the exact position.



E. My thoughts.



1. Prof. Apte seems to have followed that convention while representing ह्र as र्‍ह.



2. Was the convention followed in the region around Maharashtra (to which Prof Apte belonged) while speaking Sanskrit? Or was it the influence of the local (Marathi) language? (Local languages have always played an important role in influencing the pronunciation of Sanskrit words, some prominent examples being the pronunciation of ज्ञ, ऋ, लृ etc.



3. It may be pointed out that in Marathi (and perhaps in some other Indian languages too) प्रह्लाद is generally (unless there is a Sanskrit context) pronounced as प्रल्हाद, ह्रास as र्‍हास, आह्वान as आव्हान, ब्राह्मण as ब्राम्हण, मध्याह्न as मध्यान्ह etc. Only while quoting Sanskrit shlokas, quotations or examples the words are pronounced as per the original Sanskrit pronunciations.



4. In Marathi, distinction is made between the pronunciation of र्य and र्‍य, र्ह and र्‍ह. The pronunciation of r in र्‍य and र्‍ह is short; while the pronunciation of the रेफ in र्य and र्ह (as in Sanskrit) is slightly elongated, extended, which makes the vibration in the रेफ clearly audible. Thus the two kinds of representations are actually related to two different kinds of pronunciation in Marathi.
