Namaste



A related but side issue:

Devanagri writing is designed by purpose as a True scripting convention where the visual script must be true to the sequencing of the sounds as pronounced. ( lipyakshara-aanupoorvee must be same as uccharana-varna-aanupoorvee).



If the print /write convention has adapted a different modality, as noted here, how has this affected :

a) Reading of the scripted word ( directly and in transliterations: Classic example being the pronunciation of ha and ma combination in brahma).

b) Change in the ‘ Shuddha –Paatha’ standard across different regions of India in teaching schools ?



(I am not sidetracking in to the technical challenges of devanagari voice transcription, Unicode –ISCII shortcomings and difference of conventions used in transcriptions the character symbols of different languages and the like. If some one desires to highlight these issues, it is a bonus issue here.).
