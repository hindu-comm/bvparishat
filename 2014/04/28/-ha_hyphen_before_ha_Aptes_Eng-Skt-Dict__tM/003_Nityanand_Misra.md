Yes, I have, but not in Sanskrit. In several Prakrit languages including Hindi, Awadhi, Braja, Marathi, there are two type of र् in conjuncts. The ligatures र्ह, र्य, etc are used, where there is more effort in pronunciation of र् (it is "hard", this makes the previous syllable long if it is short for prosodic considerations). The ligatures र्‍ह, र्‍य, etc are used where the र् is pronounced quickly with less effort (it is "soft", has no effect on the length of previous vowel, so गिर्‍यो is three instants and गिर्‍यॊ is two).

In Unicode, the ligatures can be typed using the Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ, U+200D). For example

र्‍ह = U+0930 U+094D U+200D U+0939

Contrast with र्ह = U+0930 U+094D U+0939

र्‍य = U+0930 U+094D U+200D U+092F

Contrast with र्य = U+0930 U+094D U+092F

Some examples of words with the softer र् -

1. Hindi: दर्‍या meaning river or sea (loan word from Persian, also used in geographical names like Amu Darya).

2. Awadhi and Braja: Singular past tense forms like गिर्‍यो (he or she fell), उचार्‍यो (he or she pronounced). In Awadhi and Braja typography these are sometimes indicated by another ligature - the normal र character followed by य which is typed differently - with an "open hook" to the left (instead of joining with the line on top). A sample use from the RCM 6.84.9 is गिर्‍यॊ धरनि दसकंधर बिकलतर बान सत बेध्यो हियो. The normal Sanskrit र् here would violate the Harigitika meter which has 28 instants in the 2-2-1-2 x 4 sequence - गिर्‍यॊ(2) धर(2)नि(1) दस(2)कं(2)धर(2) बि(1)कल(2)तर(2) बा(2)न(1) सत(2) बे(2)ध्यो(2) हि(1)यो(2).

3. Marathi: वर्‍हाड meaning the procession of a groom (cognate with Hindi बरात, both orginially come from Sanskrit वरयात्रा).

When one wants to show the softer variant of the consonant explicitly, the र्‍ह/र्‍य forms are used - but many print and online publications simply use र्ह/र्य. Most Sanskrit publications do not use the र्‍ह/र्‍य forms. Maybe typographic constraints or the influence of the Devanagari as used in Maharashtra made Apte do this.
