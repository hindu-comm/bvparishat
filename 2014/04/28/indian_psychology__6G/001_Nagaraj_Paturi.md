What is this all about?



Did any individual or organization start a project? Are these objectives, methodology set for the project?



Or,



Is a project being suggested to be taken up by the interested individuals/ organizations? Are these objectives, methodology being suggested to be taken up by those who, inspired by this message shall take up the project?



"Interdisciplinary" can not be used this way because "Sanskrit" is not a discipline. "Sanskrit Studies" " Sanskritic studies" could be.



यदि प्रयत्न नहीं किया तो संस्कृत की रक्षा के नाम पर हमने क्या किया?
क्या "भारतीय मनोविज्ञान को एक विषय के रूप में कम से कम बी०ए० में पढाना " ही संस्कृत की रक्षाका एक मात्र साक्ष्य होगा?



It is heartening to see such a strong emotional concern for the development of Indian theories in competetion with the prevalent western models.



But the thread initiator needs to take a stock of all the great amount of great work being done in this regard and a way forward can be chalked out based only on that.



Yes, "Sanskrit studies" based contributions to ***psychology*** have a great scope for further work.



BVP is the right forum to consult for taking stock of the existing work in this direction, consolidate the same and initiate further work.



Scholars may share their own work and links to sources of other works.
