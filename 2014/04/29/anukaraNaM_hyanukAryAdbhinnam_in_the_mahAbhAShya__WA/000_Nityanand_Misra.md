Namaste.  

I am tracing the source of the statement “anukaraṇaṁ hyanukāryādbhinnam”. It appears to be from theMahābhāṣya.

On page 220 of the Vaiyākaraṇabhuṣaṇasāra with the Darpaṇa commentary by Harivallabha and the Subodhini commentary by Candrikā Prasāda Dvivedī (2013 reprint, Chaukhambha Sanskrit Pratishtan: New Delhi), Dvivedī Ji says that statements stating both Abheda and Bheda Pakṣas between Anukaraṇa and Anukārya are in the Mahābhāsẏa. Dvivedī Ji cites the following statements –

(1) For the Abhedapakṣa: प्रकृतिवदनुकरणं भवति under the महाभाष्य on the शिवसूत्र “ऋऌक्”

(2) For the Bheda pakṣa: अनुकरणं ह्यनुकार्याद्भिन्नम् under the महाभाष्य on the सूत्र “मतौ च्छः सूक्तसाम्नोः” (PS 5-2-49).

I found the first statement in both the GRETIL digital edition (based on the Kielhorn/Abhyankar edition) and in the Chaukhambha edition with Pradīpa and Uddyota.

I could not find the second statement in either the GRETIL edition or in the Chaukhambha edition (although there is discussion on Anukaraṇa and Anukārya in all three – Mahābhāsẏa, Pradīpa and Uddyota on PS 5-2-49).

Does anybody have access to (an)other edition(s) of the Mahābhāsẏa which has/have this statement (अनुकरणं ह्यनुकार्याद्भिन्नम् under मतौ च्छः सूक्तसाम्नोः)?

Thanks, Nityānanda
