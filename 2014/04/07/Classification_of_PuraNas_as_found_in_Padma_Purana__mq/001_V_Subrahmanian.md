(Even among the three-type classification, it is held by Madhwas that those parts that do not contradict vishnu-pAramya is acceptable and those opposed to this is to be rejected. One madhwa yati has even said that Vyasa considers the non-vishnupara puranas as pUrvapakSha. Madhwa has cited from the skanda purana also to his favour.

  

I am also surprised that the brahmasutras contain some references to 'jaimini's view' which are not really rejected by vyAsa. In fact Dr.Mani Dravid sastri has pointed out extensively how Vyasa adopts/follows the method of jaimini in his sutra construction. Since I am not very well versed in the comparative study of both the mImAmsA darshanas I cannot delve into the specific instances of samvAda between the two. In this light it is surprising that Vyasa would classify Jaimini darshana as tAmasa. One way of doing a samanvaya would be perhaps to say that the classification is not in toto but bhAgashaH; avirodha aspects are admitted but only the virodha aspects are condemned.

  

  

Also it is surprising that Shiva is said to be the power behind those shAstra pravartaka-s like Gautama and KaNAda and Jaimini to bring about the downfall of those who study (even smaraNa) of those shAstra-s. And Vedanta formal study is said to commence only after one is well grounded in nyAya, pU.Mi. and vyAkaraNa, which themselves are said to lead to hell (mohaka). How can mohaka / tAmasa shAstra aid the understanding of Vedanta?
