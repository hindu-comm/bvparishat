There is no wonder if one utilizes the contents of Shastra, though not as a whole:

  

यथा कश्चित् मांसार्थी मत्स्यान् सशकलान् सकण्टकान् आहरति नान्तरीयकत्वात् स यावत् आदेयं तावत् आदायं तावत् आदाय शकलकण्टकान् उत्सृजति ॥

  

In the same, from all the other Shastra-s, any learner of other Shastra take what is useful and leave out what is not useful or harmful to his purpose. This the method followed by Sarvadarshana Sangraha, taking the logic from Nyaya, Mimamsa for Vedic Nyaya-s, to be followed, and Yoga for meditation purpose, etc. Finally arrived at the conclusion of they all culminate in Vedanta which is his favorite subject. This is followed by all the scholars in different Shastra-s. One cannot attain all the moksha-s contended in the Moksha Shastra-s. The concept of Moksha is also different from each Shastra to Shastra, which doesn't interfere with the goal of other Shastra, unless one wants to argue out and establish his is superior. This is in the mundane level, as each Shastra has its own contents of knowledge generally accepted by others. The Nyaya-s are utilized to the maximum by both Dvaitins, Vishishtadvaitins and Advaitins.
