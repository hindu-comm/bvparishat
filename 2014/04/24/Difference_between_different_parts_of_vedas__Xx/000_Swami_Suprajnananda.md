Dear members,

Namaste.

  

There are many parts in the vedas like Aranyakam, brahmanam, samhita and upanishad. For examples, there are Taittireeya Aranyakam,Taittireeyabrahmanam,Taittireeya samhita and Taittireeya upanishad. How each part of the vada is defined. what is Aranyakam, what is brahmanam etc? Is there any authoritative definitions of these things?
