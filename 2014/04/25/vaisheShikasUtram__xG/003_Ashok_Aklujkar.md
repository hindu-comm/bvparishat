Dear Dr. Bhat,  
  
Has S.D. Gupta given any references from later works that speak of a Bhaaradvaaja commentary on the Vai;se.sika-suutra? The part you reproduce from his book touches upon the evidence only for Raava.na's commentary (for the existence of which, known as Ka.tandii, Muni Jambuvijaya and others have given much evidence).  
  
To whom does the "he" in your sentence "he doesn't mention any name \[such?\] as Bharadvaja Uddyotakara there" refer?  
  
a.a.
