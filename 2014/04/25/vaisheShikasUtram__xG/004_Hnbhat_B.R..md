No. He doesn't give any reference than merely mentioning it name Bharadvaja-vritti as given in the snapshot.

SD Gupta does not give any detail as to his Gotra as Bharadvaja, in the section on Nyaya Literature, referring to Uddyotakara.

  

But I too got the reference from the colophon of Varttika, to the gotra-name appears in the colophon of Nyaya-Varttika,

  

यदक्षपादप्रतिमो भाष्यं वात्स्यायनो जगौ।

अकारि महतस्तस्य *भारद्वाजेन*वार्त्तिकम्॥

  

(5.2.colophon) quoted in notes in Google Books,

"A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools"  

By Satis Chandra Vidyabhusana p.70

  

So there is every possibility for the confusion between the two Bharadvaja's.

  

With regards
