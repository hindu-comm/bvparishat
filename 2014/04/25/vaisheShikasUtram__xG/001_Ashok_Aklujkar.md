The assertion that there is a v.rtti on Vai;se.sika-suutra by Bhaaradvaaja could be based on confusion. There is a commentary (commonly known as Vaarttika)on the Nyaaya-suutra. This commentary is authored by Bhaaradvaaja Uddyotakara. It is understandable if a commentary on theNyaaya-suutra was mis-remembered as a commentary on theVai;se.sika-suutra and if a gotra-based epithet ofUddyotakara was mistaken to be a personal name.

  

The vaarttika of Uddyotakara was printed long time ago in the Bibliotheca Indica series.
