This is the information found in the History of Indian Literature, by SD Gupta:

  

![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/4015a1ff8a24e9a9/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

  

It is known through commentaries only as per the above snapshot and not printed when SD Gupta compiled his history. May be later it might have been found and published if Lalitaaji has seen the publication. Otherwise, it may be a mistaken memory for the commentary of Udyotakara's Vartika on the Vatsyana Bhashya. (p.307, Vol.) and he doesn't mention any name as Bharadvaja Uddyotakara there. So it is a different commentary by Bharadvaja on Vaisheshika Sutra-s which was probably lost according to SD Gupta.

  

And He doesn't give any commentary by Bhikshu other than the Vijnanabhikshu, who wrote commentaries on different works and any work is ascribed to him in the Nyaya-Vaisheshika literature or any work ascribed to any other Bhikshu in the section of literature on Vaisheshika Philosophy.
