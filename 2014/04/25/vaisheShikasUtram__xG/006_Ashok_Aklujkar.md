In the present state of our knowledge, the conclusion should really be that your source S.D. Gupta has given unfounded and misleading information. The object of confusion should not be 'two Bhaaradvaajas,' but Gupta's thinking.

If Gupta gives similar information about other authors / Nyaaya authors, what you state here shows the inconsistent nature of his procedure and becomes a sign of (although not sufficient evidence for) less than careful scholarship.

I was aware of this evidence. That is why I put forward the hypothesis of possible confusion on the part of the source of Shri Lalitaalaalita's information. There is no doubt that a Bhaaradvaaja commented on the Nyaaya-suutras (indirectly through Pak.sila-svaamin Vaatsyaayana's bhaa.sya), but no evidence has so far been given even to posit another Bhaaradvaaja in the Nyaaya-Vai;se.sika tradition as a commentator of the Vai;se.sika-suutra. Even after such evidence is given, we have to determine if this second Bhaaradvaaja could have been idential with Bhaaradvaaja Uddyotakara.
