Dear Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya,



"That is the world’s first paradigmatic structure of phonemes." You said it.



The younger scholars on this list probably need to know this in further detail particularly in comparison with the 'Alphabet' of English and many other such languages.



For example, usually 'a,e,i,o,u ' are listed as vowels of English. In fact they are not . ए,बी,सी,डी etc. are all names of the script symbols. 'a, e, I, o, u' are just the script symbols used quite often to representthe vowel pronunciations of English. 'y' not listed here also is used to represent vowel pronunciations.



Point is, even these script symbols are not listed in a row in English and such other languages.



The actual vowels of English such as the ones in the pronunciation of
cut, call, cot, coffee, sit, seat, put, fruit, boot, pure, poor, etc. arenot listed at one place.



That in all the Indian languages, inspired by Sanskrit varNamala, varNamalas are taught to babies in a an articulatory phonetics based scientific paradigm and that such an arrangement is as old asṚk-Prātiśākhya I.9-15 needs to be circulated among the general Indian public.



Thanks for this wonderful reminder.



Regards,

Nagaraj
