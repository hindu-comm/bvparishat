The alphabet is an haphazard graphic representation of sounds while the Praati;saakhya listed the sounds orally when alphabets were not in use. We inherited that orally or through written books. The difference between the alphabet and our phoneme paradigmatic structures are now reduced. Only one should note that the alphabet is haphazard without any science while the Praatisaakhya list is scientific.  

In order to know its method the subsequent verses need to be understood and compared with the IPA
