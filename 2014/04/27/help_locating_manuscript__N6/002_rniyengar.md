Dear Dr.Dash,

  

Thanks for your response. The info in NCC is almost same as in CESS of Pingree. However, what I am looking for is "Gaargiiya Jyotisha", which I think is subsumed in the similarly sounding Garga-related manuscripts.

After collecting four manuscripts from three different libraries I have located in one of them YP and a part of Gargiiya.

  

Thanks

  

RNI
