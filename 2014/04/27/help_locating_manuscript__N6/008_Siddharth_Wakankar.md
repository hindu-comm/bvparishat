Dear Prof.Iyengar,

Pl.write to:

Shri Bhanwar Lal Mehra(R.A.S.),                    
  Nodal Officer:       Dr.Vasumati Sharma : Ph.and fax- Same.

Director,RORI,                             
         Mobile No.:09351321206.

Ph.and Fax :0291-2430244;

[direct...@yahoo.com]()         

  

If somebody can write and talk to them in Hindi,the answer will be easy to get.OR just send a mail/fax by giving the exact titles and Accession Numbers of the Mss. and the name of the Collection/Place like Alwar,Bikaner etc. and they will try to locate/find out.That also will take some time.

Best luck.
