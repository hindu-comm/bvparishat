Dear Scholars,

  

I am interested in a text known as vrddha-gargiya-jyotisha that also contains the yuga purana. I have the latter text as translated by Mitchener. But my interest is in the other part which I am unable to locate. Wikipedia entry says:

  

The***Yuga Purana***("Story of the Ages") is an ancient Indian text, part of the larger[Puranic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puranas "Puranas")literature. It is considered as one of the oldest Purana, written around 250 CE. The Yuga Purana consists two chapters, within the larger text of the*[Gargi Samhita](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gargi_Samhita&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gargi Samhita (page does not exist)")*, also called*Vriddha Gargiya[Jyotisha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyotisha "Jyotisha")*(Astrology of the Sage Garga). It is the most extensive Indian text to describe the invasion of the country by foreign rulers ([Indo-Greeks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek "Indo-Greek")and[Indo-Scythians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Scythian "Indo-Scythian")) during the 2nd and 1st century BCE.

  

I did write to ORI-Baroda, BORI and ASB-Kolkata to collect Gaargya-samhita and one more called vrddha-garga-samhita. The above libraries are listed in the book by Mitchener as containing the VGJ. But none of these manuscripts know any Yugapurana. May be I am searching in the wrong place! Most probably Vrddha-Garga and Garga refer to different traditions, as even Bhattotpala differentiates their statements. Any lead to the text (published or otherwise) of Vrddha-gaargiiya would be helpful.

  

regards

RN Iyengar
