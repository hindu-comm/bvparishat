Ashok,  
 The problem is not the firing of people. Instead the attitude of the professors at these institutions. The big names never ever visit the library. They send their minions to get the books. If they themselves had to search for these books the system would be fixed in no time.  
  
 See the english left but they left sahabs behind.
