Dear Prof. Iyengar,  
  
I share your anguish. Although there are a few impressive exceptions, we find at these institutions not only an absence of karma-yogic spirit (which Sanskritology and Indology badly need at this time) but also an absence of any shame of the form 'I am not doing the job for which I am paid.' We need an ombudsman who will be able to dismiss smug non-performers immediately. We need a set of rules that will be uniformly applied all across India and be based on the premise that a librarian's or director's first responsibility is to help scholars -- to be their servant, not to be an obstacle in their path, (ultimately) just to satisfy the position-holder's ego. On the other hand, we need to make Sanskritists less meek (or more vocal) and capable of concentrating on unidentified manuscripts and fragments (not just depend on lists and catalogues published long time ago). There is a national crisis of preservation of Indian languages and literatures, and yet very little awareness that there is a crisis -- sadly, sadly disproportionate to how populous and culturally rich and distinctive the country is and how much money the various governments spend on education.
