Dear Members,

Please help me with the contact address of National Library, Kolkata. The web site

[www.nationallibrary.gov.in](http://www.nationallibrary.gov.in)

seems to be defunct for the last two years. Contact menu returns: "facility will be provided later" or some such message! The Director's page seems to have been uploaded in 2011 or 2012. Registration menu is also dead. As per NCC posted by Dr.Dash and also in CESS, a Gargiya J is available at NLI. I would appreciate the name, phone and postal address of the person to be contacted.

  

As a lover of Sanskrit I share my anguish that it is very difficult to get information from even the most famous Mss libraries of the land. I do not know how others feel about their experience.  

  

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
