Dear Shri Ajit Krishnan,

  

  The Aupasana.com website is wonderful, and I have benefitted from its rich collection of books. I have one question. What is the Devanagari font used for your "Test Page for Browser Support".
Occasionally I need to type Vedic accents on my Mac, and the placement of accent marks is always a problem. Any help you can suggest is welcome. With best wishes,
