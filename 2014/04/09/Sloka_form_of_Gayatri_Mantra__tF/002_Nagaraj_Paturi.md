Many thanks to Sri Ajit Krishnanfor the गायत्रीशिष्टार्थमालाpdf. This is a valuable compilation. All those interested in Gayatri-study will be greatly benefitted by downloading this.Any info on the compiler Ajitji?



All I said is,



'Those who can not/ do not want to use the Mantra version of the Gayatri Mantra can freely use the sloka version as a substitute'.



A sloka version can never be the same as the mantra version.



But a substitute that does not carry stipulations has many advantages during contemporary times.



Another info that was helpful, again thanks to Sri Ajit is that this sloka is attributedto Agastya.
