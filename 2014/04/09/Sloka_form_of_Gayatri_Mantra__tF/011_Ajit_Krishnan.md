namaste,

  

<http://aupasana.com/pages/suktas/browser-test.html>  

  

The test page above was designed to render vedic accents using the Siddhanta font. It went through a few iterations to test how different browsers handle common taittiriya shakha accents on different platforms. I tried various fonts (Sanskrit 2003 / Siddhanta / Noto Sans) on different browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox) on different platforms (Windows 10, Mac OSX, Linux, iOS) and really didn't find a solution that worked well across them.

  

I personally type vedic selections directly into Microsoft Word using the Siddhanta font. This works on both Windows and Mac OSX, though there are a couple of oddities in typesetting the dirgha svarita (on a mac there are a few cases where two svaritas in sequence render as a dirgha svarita while the dirgha svarita code point does not render correctly ... and the behavior is the opposite on Microsoft Word on Windows).

  

You can install the Siddhanta font using the builtin FontBook on OSX, and then install the latest version of Microsoft Word. For an IME, I use the Lipika IME (<https://github.com/ratreya/lipika-ime>) which supports custom input schemes, and also understands the Google IME scheme file format.

  

If you would like, I can provide the exact .scm file that I use on OSX to render vedic accents.

  

sasneham,
