Thanks Korada mahodaya for yourpresentation of the mimamsa method.



The key is in the the meaning of प्रचोदयति for प्रचोदयात् .



SaayaNaachaarya provides the justification.



It may be idiomatic in Sanskrit both in loukika and Vaidika to use प्रचोदयात्for प्रचोदयति moresignificantly in Vaidika. Particularly in a relative clause it seems usual. Even in contemporary Hindi such expressions seem to be idiomatic in relative clauses.
