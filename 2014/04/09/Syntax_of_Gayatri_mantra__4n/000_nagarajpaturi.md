Saayanaachaarya in his Vedabhashya takes Gayatrimantra as a single sentence with यत्तदर्थक structure. Some of the modern scholars like Sir William Jones, William Quan Judge etc. did the same, probably following Saayanabhaashya.



But R T H Griffith takes it as two different sentences. Many modern scholars like Swami Vivekananda, Prof. S. Radhakrishnan followed Griffith's approach.



Saayanaachaarya's approach connects यो of the third paada and तत् of the first paadaand takes the third paada as a relative clause.



Griffith ignores the word यो .



What prompts Griffith to take the third paada as an independent sentenceseems to be the tense/mood of प्रचोदयात् .



Saayanatakes the contextual meaning of प्रचोदयात्asप्रचोदयति.Hence connecting the third paada as a relative clause doesn't come as problem for him.
