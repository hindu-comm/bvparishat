Thanks to both Dr Siddharth Wakankar and Dr Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay for sharing sharing their suggestions.I wrote to the list only because there is not much published information available on him. Obviously, we do have all the volumes of KSTS available in PDF including the ones edited by J.C. Chatterjee. But as I had mentioned in my message I have been interested in questions related to Orientalism and Post-colonial studies hence I am looking for more information on him which is unpublished. Thanks anyway for your email.

  

Best wishes.
