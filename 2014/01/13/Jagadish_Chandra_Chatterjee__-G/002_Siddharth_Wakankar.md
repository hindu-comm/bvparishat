Dear Sir,

        I have one reference for your perusal.

It is just possible that this Jagadish Chandra Chatterjee might be the same for which you are searching.

The Upanishads-Translated into English,with a Preamble and Arguments by G.R.S.Mead,B.A.M.R.A.S. and Jagadish Chandra Chattopadhyay(Roy Choudhuri),

published by:Theosophical Publishing Society,London,1896.

Best luck.

  

Prof.Siddharth Wakankar
