Dear Sir,

You may contact the authorities of the Asiatic Society,Kolkata and the National Library,Kolkata.It is just possible that he might have studied at Varanasi also.

Other senior scholars hailing from J&K like Dr.Kausalya Valli or the present Head of the Skt.Dept.of Jammu University(Dr.Niharika Jalali) and her colleagues might be of some help to trace his biographical details.

Did you contact Prof. Dr.Navajivan Rastogi sir or Dr.Kamaldatta Tripathi?

Best luck in your search.

Regards,

  

Prof.Siddharth Wakankar
