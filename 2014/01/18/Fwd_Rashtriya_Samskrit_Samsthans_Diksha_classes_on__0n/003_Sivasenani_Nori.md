Sir

  

Dr. Narasing Rao is the teacher; he is a member of the Executive Committee of the Sura Bharati Samiti and he has been teaching (in Pragati College, Hanuman Tekdi, Hyderabad) for the last 30 years +. He is very well known to guruji, Prof. B. Narasimhacharyulu.

  

The soft copies (actually videos uploaded on You Tube) are available at<https://www.youtube.com/user/AdvaitaAcademy?feature=watch>along with many other videos. Many advaita related articles are available at <http://advaita-academy.org/pages/default.aspx>. The book followed is available at Sanskrit Academy, Tarnaka, Hyderabad.

  

If you contact Dr. K. Aravind Rao (also a member of the Executive Committee of Surabharati Samiti, Hyderabad) it might be possible to take part in the other courses.

  

Best regards

Senani
