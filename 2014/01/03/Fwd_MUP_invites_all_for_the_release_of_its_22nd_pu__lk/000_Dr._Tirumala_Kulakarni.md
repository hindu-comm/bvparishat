Dears

  

I personally invite you to the book release function of the book which is co-authored by me.

  

I have written in the preface that -

"Three kinds of readers may find this book useful:

1. People from technical backgrounds like computer science, and western logic, who are curious about the contribution of Indian logic and its historical role

2. People who are already familiar with traditional śāstras other than nyāya and wish to know more about nyāya

   3. Traditional scholars who are curious to know how these śāstras are relevant in today’s age.

  

"Thespeciality of this book is that a student from a technical background, Jaideep Joshi, pursuing Ph.D. in IISc, having understood the age-old concepts, has co-authored this book."
