Prima facie, the verse in the Pāṇinīyaśikṣāthat has been cited–

हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्तस्थाभिश्च संयुतम्।

औरस्यं तं विजानीयात् कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम्॥ १६ ॥

talks about the pronunciation of the consonant “h”, under certain specific conditions, as a pure pulmonic consonant (औरस्य) without any effort from the glottis (कण्ठ). This verse does not talk about reversing the order of pronunciation (hm -> mh, hn -> nh, hr -> rh, etc) in those conditions.

As for commentaries on Pāṇinīyaśikṣā, I know of the Pañjikā and the Śikṣāprakāśa. Pañjikā does not comment on this verse. Śikṣāprakāśa comments on the verse, but only talks about the effort and says nothing about reversing the order. Here is the commentary -

<https://archive.org/stream/PaniniyaShiksha/paniniya_shiksha#page/n99/mode/1up>

Yes, Kauṇḍinyaśikṣā does talk about reversing the order under certain conditions -

हकारान्नणमा ऊर्ध्वाः पूर्वं तु प्रसरन्ति हात्। ४४ ।

but this is Śikṣā as per Kauṇḍinya, and not as per Pāṇini. I have not seen the above in the editions of Pāṇinīyaśikṣā I have access to.

Are there any traditional or modern commentaries on Pāṇinīyaśikṣā which interpret the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā verse हकारं पञ्चमै... to imply *a change or order or articulation in addition to change of articulation effort*? Does Nāgeśa interpret it that way when he talks about उरस्यम्/औरस्यम्? What does Damodar Mahato say on this verse? The book is ISBN 9788120823853 published by MLBD, but I do not have a copy or online access.

There are key differences in various Prātiśākhya and Śikṣā works, and it is important to make this distinction. I doubt if we can arrive at a “Pāṇinīya conclusion” bycombining interpretations ofone verse from Pāṇinīyaśikṣā and one from Kauṇḍinyaśikṣā.

Given this, I can only say that the evidence presented so far is not sufficient to conclude that Pāṇinīyaśikṣā ordains that the order of articluation of consonants in hm, hn, etc is to be reversed.

Now coming to Joshi Ji's original question, how such words must be written in English. The answer varies, depending on the type of publication. For scientific publications like journals, books for scholars, research papers, etc they are better written using a standard and consistent transliteration scheme like IAST, and *spelt exactly as they are spelt in Saṁskṛta* (no matter how they are pronounced as per Pāṇinīyaśikṣā or Kauṇḍinyaśikṣā). Harvard Kyoto and ITRANS, despite popular on the Internet and also on this forum, are jarring on the eyes – the mixed case and tilde look utterly horrible in a printed publication. For non-scientific publications like newspaper articles, blogs, non-serious books, one may use the popular spellings using the Roman script without diacritics.  

An example. If you are writing a scientific book or research paper for select audience, please use “Jñāneśvara” (IAST). If you are writing a book for the masses or a newspaper article, use “Dnyaneshwar”. “J\~nAneshvara” and “JJAnezvara” – never in a formal publication, probably okay on blogs and emails.
