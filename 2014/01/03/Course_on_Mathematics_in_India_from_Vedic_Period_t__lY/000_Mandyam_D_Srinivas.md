Last May, Prof. K. Ramasubramanian of IIT Bombay, Prof. M. S. Sriram of Madras University and myself delivered a course of 40 lectures on
"Mathematics in India: From Vedic Period to Modern Times" under the NPTEL Programme of IIT Madras. The videos of these lectures have recently been uploaded by NPTEL at the URL

Withe best regards
