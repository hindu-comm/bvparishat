Dear Alankar Sharmaji,  
  

Yes, I could also locate the verse in the translation of Avadhuta Gita by Banamali Chaturvedi.  
  
The great Dattareya had the realization that the soul is without any gender. So also was for the great Adi Shankaracharya. But for those deluded people who do not see that way but sees the women as an object of attraction and enjoyment, there is the real danger. That is probably the purport of the verse. However the Nath Sampradaya seems to think that the verses 11 onwards in the chapter 8 are interpolated.  
  

Regards,
