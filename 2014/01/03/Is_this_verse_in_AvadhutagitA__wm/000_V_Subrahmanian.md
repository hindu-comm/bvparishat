In the following page I came across a verse shown below:  

  
<http://satsangdhara.net/bh-ram/bhk6a68.htm>  
  

॥ श्रीएकनाथमहाराजकृत ॥  

॥ श्रीभावार्थरामायण ॥  

युद्धकांड  

  
यां दृष्ट्वा चित्तवैकल्पं स्पष्ट्वा सत्यांशसक्षयः ।  
संभोगे मरणं याति सा स्त्री प्रत्यक्षराक्षसी ॥५॥  
  

This verse is interspersed in the MaraThi work above. Source of the verse is not given. I could not make out the meaning of the highlighted word.  

  

I heard that a verse somewhat similar to the above both in meaning and the last words स्त्री प्रत्यक्षराक्षसी is found in the 'avadhUtagItA' too. It seems the verse starts with: दर्शनात् हरते चित्तं...  

On a search in the internet for these words I did not get any results.
I request members here to give reference if any to this verse in the avadhUta gitA and the verse shown above with source/author.  
  

Thanks and regards
