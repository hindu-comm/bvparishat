Dear Scholars,

It could be sprushtvaa satyaanshasamkshayah.(?)

Some years back,I came across another reading- sambhogaat harate veeryam,naaree pratyaksharaakshasee.

The meaning may/need not be deriding a woman,but,cautioning a man to be aware of the pitfalls-which are against the patidharma.

Even the Bible says that a man should not give his semen to any woman except his lawfully wedded wife-suggesting thereby that he should not have sexual relationship with any other lady-which is considered as a sin-paatakam- in almost all the religions.

I shall try to give the entire verse(esp.the second line,the first being-darshanaat harate veeryam) as and when I am able to locate it.

  

Thanks and regards,

  

Prof.Dr. Siddharth Y. Wakankar
