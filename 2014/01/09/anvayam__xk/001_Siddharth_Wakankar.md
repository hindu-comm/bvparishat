Dear Usha,

Some fifty years back,my Sanskrit Teachers from Mumbai gave me a very easy and good piece of advice about the anvaya of a verse.

Hence,I was not required to look in for any write-up-book/paper/chapter- for knowing the guidelines for such a prayatnam.

  

First,find out the verb/verbal form from it,then you can recognise the kartaa(from the purusha and the vachana of the verbal form) as well as the karma,try to find out their adjectives.Lastly,see if there are any adverbial forms/avyayas and other padas. While translating in English,start from the last pada of the particular samaasa-which happens to be adjective/s of the kartaa/karma etc. and then you are successful in correctly construing the entire verse. The same should apply to long padya-passages also.

I have been using this simple method for more than 46 years.

Best luck in your intellectual endeavour.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y.Wakankar
