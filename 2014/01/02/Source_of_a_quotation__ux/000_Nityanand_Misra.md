Namaste  
  
द्वारं किमेकं नरकस्य नारी  
  
Where is this originally from? Any pointers to the original source would be appreciated.  
  
I came across some articles on the Internet and one book ("Bhartṛhari Śatakam" in Hindi by Jagadīśvarānanda Sarasvatī, Subodh Publications, ISBN 9788170780502, page 152 - <http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=T4EsDIwJLH8C&pg=PT157>) which say this ascribed to Ādya Śaṅkarācārya. The Internet sources say this is in the Praśnottarī. However I have not been able to locate the verse in a published version of Praśnottarī.  
  
DISCLAIMER: The sole reason behind asking is that I need to cite this quote which is presented as a Pūrvapakṣa in a work I am currently editing. There is no other objective. There is no offence whatsoever intended to anybody, and I do not want any debate on the merits or demerits of the quotation.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
