Many thanks to Prof. Vineet Chaitanya Ji, Prof. Sankarji Jha and Shankara Ji for their responses.  
  
Prof. Vineet Chaitanya Ji, could you confirm if the Gita Press publication ascribes the work to Kalidasa or to Adya Sankaracharya? Or to somebody else? Could you help with the ISBN or Gita Press code?  
  
Thanks again, Nityanand
