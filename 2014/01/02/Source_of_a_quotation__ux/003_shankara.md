Mishraji,  
  
Chaukhamba has published 'Prasnottara Manimala' attributed to Kalidasa. I do not have a copy of the book. Those who have access to this book can check if it contain this verse.  

<http://www.chowkhambasanskritseries.com/books.php?id=1265354780>  

  
Yet, Kalidasa Apocripha of SC Banerji (Chaukhamba publication) doesn't list 'Prasnottara Manimala' among works attributed to Kalidasa.  
  

regards  
shankara
