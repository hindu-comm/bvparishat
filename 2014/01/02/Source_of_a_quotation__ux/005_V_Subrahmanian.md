There is a popular work called 'prashnottara-ratnamAlikA' attributed to Shankaracharya. This work does not have that line.  
  

In another work called 'maNiratnamAlA' this line is found:  
  
[http://www.scribd.com/doc/101238331/Mani-Ratna-Mala](http://www.scribd.com/doc/101238331/Mani-Ratna-Mala)  
  

It is in the third verse, third line.
