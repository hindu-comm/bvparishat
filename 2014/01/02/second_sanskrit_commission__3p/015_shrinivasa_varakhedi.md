Namaste all,

  

Today I had discussions with Dr. Ramanujam CDAC who is a member of Sanskrit commission. He will be giving full time for commissions activity. He will be an access for BVP members. I will assist him to take the points posted on BVP.

  

Therefore I request the members to take part in this creation of future of Sanskrit. Each n every point you make here will carve the future of Sanskrit. Kindly stand in the future that you imagine for Sanskrit and share the points with us.

  

For better management we announce the topics to be taken up for discussion. Throw light on the same topic.

  

Thank you very much.

  

With regards,

Shrivara
