Dear all,

  

With a new hope on the eve of sankranti, that govt might take necessary action to remove the "error" in the said circular and recirculate it, I am to request all sanskritists and indologists start sketching some good plan for future of Sanskrit in india. Let us BVP also author a collective draft plan to submit to the commission on behalf of BVP.

  

I seek support.

  

With regards.

Shrivara
