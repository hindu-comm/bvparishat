Respected All,

  

Namaste.

  

Thanks to the unknown force that instigated to issue the corrected circular on constituting Second Sanskrit Commission. As Prof. Varakhedi opined, we should start a new thread for discussion and he should coordinate the same. We need to re-look into the plight of current Sanskrit education, based on the past recommendations (of 1st Sanskrit Commission) to ensure all such recommendations are effective to date and no lacunae peeps over the implementations. For the past six decades, since the first Sanskrit commission's report (1957), radical changes took place in the curriculum of higher education in India. So, considering these temporal changes, the future recommendations of Sanskrit propagation should be devised, as I feel.

  

Before expressing any of our views, we need a thorough study and understanding of aspects of Sanskrit education, say, from the system of Veda *pathasalas* to interdisciplinary research in Universities. Interested can access<http://www.teindia.nic.in/mhrd/50yrsedu/u/45/3Z/Toc.htm>to know more about the recommendations of the first Sanskrit commission, in order to revisit, bring forth innovative ideas.

  

It is fortunate that eminent scholars and researchers are members of our forum (including some new commission members). I believe, soon, honorable members of BVP will ponder over the pestering issues in Sanskrit promotion in our country. The views of members can be categorically classified to make a detailed report to be submitted to the Sanskrit Commission by coming June/July. The views expressed may be the core of Sanskrit scholarship in our country and should form helpful material for the Sanskrit commission's final report.

  

Thanks and regards,

Dr. Prasad
