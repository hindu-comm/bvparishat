Thanks Dr. Mahender for circulating the letter that avoids unnecessary confusion.

  

Anyway we have really great and accomplished people in the commission. We are sure that the Chairman and the other honourable members of the committee, who themselves are experts in various fields of Sanskrit, will create a clear roadmap for future of Sanskrit and Indlogical studies and research. However, as we know some of the members are the members of BVP. Hence I request all of you to start sharing your ideas in one thread, so that they can collect these plans and take it to the notice of the commission.

  

lets start writing in the same thread or a separate one. BVP manager can support us in this matter.

  

I also request Dr. Ramanujam to take initiative in this work as a senior member of BVP as well as the commission. I will be coordinating this thread.

  

with warm regards,

shrivarakhedi
