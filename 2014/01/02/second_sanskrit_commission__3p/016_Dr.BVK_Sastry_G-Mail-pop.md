Namaste



1. Congratulations to Dr.Ramanujam and good wishes for his success in shaping the future of deliverables from Sanskrit Commission.



2. IF a percentage of what all has already been put up as wish list from Samskrutham traditions can be brought on working models with political will and strength in the spine through the wisdom persuasion of the experts, much can be achieved .Swalpamapyasya Dharmasya, trayate mahato bhayaat.



Let not the work be save the ‘head’ at the cost of the ‘body’ creating a Rahu-ketu’ syndrome. The whole body (Vishwam) has to get the benefit from Samskrutham. When not all are ready to ‘ hop on to the Moksha flight’, a two wheeler at least needs to be delivered to the common user in global village society.



We are with you for this.



Regards

BVK Sastry
