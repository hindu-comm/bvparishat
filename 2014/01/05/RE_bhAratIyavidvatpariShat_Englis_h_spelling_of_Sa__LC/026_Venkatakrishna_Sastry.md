1\. Try for the pronunciation of the words like \< ले ह्यः \> \<मह्यम् \> \< बाह्यः> \<देवाः - देवः \> and see the difference that occurs in the pronunciation effort. Observe for the clarity on visarga - anuswara in single and combined varnas.  
  

2\. For the poetry lines where one gets the visarga - in the middle and the end of the paada, there are additional rules of the Chandas which guide.  
  

3\. Other wise, the visarga sandhi rules apply. from grammar.  
  

4\. To get the feel of variations in visarga, in veda, listen carefully to the Sri Rudra prashna - the Namakam -Chamakm keeping atext in front and following the vedic chant. You will be able to see the variations along with the issues of accents.  
  

5\. On visarga :Can it be heard independently - No. The pronunciation of visarga, independnet of swara /vyanjana is possible. It is felt by the speaker at the Kantha sthana. The ear can not grasp the sound of vsarga independent of the base from where it is produced or associated with. Therefore the default experience in listening is visarga always felt heard along with a swara . Why not a vyanjana ? For the vyanjana with ardhamaataa kaala can not take the visarga combination -association. And vynajana takes the default a-kaara in pronunciation. It is for this reason, the poeticians consider the savisrga vyanjana varna as a guru ( which requires greater effort and time in articulation). Can visarga have elongation ? No. But visarga can occur at the end of the deergha swara. (DevAH - devaH देवाः - देवः Both forms are there in singular and plural. ).  
  

English 'h' as a spelling alone can not explain all these variation issues. HN Bhat has provided useful details. This is why Samskruthamm is to be learned as a Voice culturing ( उच्चारण  ) discipline and Voice recognition as pure sounds and NOT as a scripted language, where one depends upon fuzzy phonetic system.  
  
This is the foundational error that Indian Sanskrit schools have inherited from the colonial teaching models and Classical language teaching model, where very other language of the world is mapped to the phonetics of Greek /Latin /English.  
  
The innovation on the top of this by the indian schools is to add the ' regional language pronunciation flavor ( देव भाषा treated and taught as देश भाषा / विदेश भाषा ) '.  
  
This makes Samksrutham of today carry a deviation from the PRIMARY SHIKSHA and PRATISHAKHYA Standards of ' Cultured pronunciation'. i.e. the Patanjali Commitment for teaching Samskrutham has been given a good let go. The Patanajli tradition commitment is : ' उपदेशाः शुद्धाः
पठ्यन्ते ' - The voice tradition of teaching will be in compliance with the Shikshaa Shastra standard.   

  

More may be explained by scholars.
