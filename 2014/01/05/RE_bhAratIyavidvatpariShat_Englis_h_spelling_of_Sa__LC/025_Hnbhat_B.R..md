Anyhow I do not know वर्णवाद which makes synonyms, शकृत् = सकृत् equally correct on differentiation with or without change in meaning.

  

And where phonetic changes are concerned, as metathesis, etc. changing the words, with and without meaning, it has been said:

  

प्रायो भवेयुः प्रचुरप्रयोगाः प्रामाणिकोदाहरणे प्रतीताः । रूपादिभेदेषु विचारणेषु विचक्षणो निश्चयतामुपैति ॥५३॥

  

क्वचित्मात्राकृतो भेदः क्वचिद्वर्णकृतोऽत्र च । क्वचिदर्थान्तरोल्लेखाच्छब्दानां रूढितः क्वचित् ॥५४॥

  

by the lexicographer Purushottama, which is not exclusive for Vedic vocabulary and collected differently pronounced words in his शब्दभेदप्रकाश ---

  

भवेदमर्ष आमर्षोऽप्यङ्कुरोऽप्यङ्कूर एव च । अन्तरिक्षमन्तरीक्षमगस्त्योऽगस्तिरेव च ॥३॥

  

he has noticed these and some more pairs.

and for Vedic Vocabulary, Yaska attests the changes, आद्यन्तविपर्यय in his nirukta: "पञ्चविधं निरुक्तम्"

  

"वर्णागमो वर्णविपर्ययश्च द्वौ चापरौ वर्णविकारनाशौ धातोस्तदर्थातिशयेन योगस्तदुच्यते पञ्चविधं निरुक्तम्"॥ and draws examples for each.  

  

वटु and बटु, शिञ्जिनी and सिञ्जिनी, or शिञ्जारव or सिञ्जारव do not change their meaning, like शकृत् and सकृत् or शकल and सकल.

  

How वर्णवाद explain this with its fixed meaning for letters according to Mr.Joshi?

For laymen like me, the meaning is fixed by usage and only theories help to justify the meaning by usage and it is the work of lexicographers to record such variation of syllables as Purushottama deva has done, in his special Kosha, I cited, who has written thesarus त्रिकाण्डशेष also शब्दभेदप्रकाश out of interest in recording such variations of syllables with and without meaning. And द्विरूपकोश seems to be listing such words:

  

"मृणाले तु बिसं बिशम्" both बिस andबिश are used to denote मृणाल.

  

There are some more द्विरूपकोश-s by different lexicographers. Purushottamadeva also has written one.
