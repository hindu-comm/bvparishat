Thank you Bhat ji for your answer. May be I would have started a separate thread for this.  
  

I just had a difference of opinion with one of my friend about pronunciation of words like devAH, without anything to follow after visarga. I was mentioning him that this will sound like devAhA, whereas he argued for devAha. He was telling that articulation point 'A' becomes 'a' for visarga. Neither of us had any reference to mention.  
  

  
Regards,  

J Prasad.
