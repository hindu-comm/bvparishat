My question is was was Sanskrit mother tongue? for women were not allowed to learn Sanskrit. It was perhaps a "Father tongue", except probably during the vedic age when Vedic Sanskrit was a spoken language which we never use in classical language. Even now or a thousand years back Sanskrit was and is a spoken language of the elite, educated or scholars. So vernacular influences must have been very old and even Panini knew that.  
  

If one keeps a language rigid intentionally then one can keep it pure or free from regional language influence else it might not be possible to know what is the correct way to pronounce each and every word with absolute correctness .That is the reason why there is no unanimity even among the siksha granthas. Take for instance English is there any thing called perfect pronunciation an Englishman (even within UK people pronounce the same word differently) an American and Indian would pronounce in a different way
