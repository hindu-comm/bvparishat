Namaste  
  

Why doubt on \< devAḥ \> whether it is at the end of a verse? or stand alone as a shabda roopa ?  
  

The last phoneme is \< visarga ; the transform of the -jas pratyaya \> and it should be pronounced as visarga. Why bring in the \<- h> sound ?  
  

Visarga pronunciation causes \< breathe to go out of mouth + And come to a stop + lips open out , before the next reset for any articulation of any varna.  
  

If you change this to \<-h> sound, then the last part of the pronunciation would end up as an effort at the \< kanTha = Throat> point with \< \< breathe flowing out of mouth + stop of effort at Kantha , causing a friction feel + lips open out , before the next reset for any articulation of any varna.>  
  
Try out the difference with clean visarga pronunciation and visarga ending up with a \< -ha>. Observe the movements in mouth, air flow. You can see and feel the difference.
