नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Prof Joshi --

  

1.The word Brahma should be pronounced as Bramha/ Am I correct?

  

yes , it should be औरस्यम् ।

  

2.How do we write Hansa(Swan), Dhvans (destroy), Sanskaara (impressions)in English? What nasal (Anunaasika) should we use?

  

Hamsa , dhvamsa , samskara . The 'm' is used for अनुस्वार ।

  

Dr B V K Sastry --

  

1.How would one read 'sa-hRu-da-ya' (art -appreciator) - 'su-hR-t'(Friend) ? or even the Panini sutra : hR^ikroranyatarasyAm (1-4-53);  hru hvareshChandasi ( 7-2-31) ? Should these sutras be read as Rh-kroranyatarasyAm (1-4-53);  Rh- vha-reshChandasi?

  

सहृदयः - here there is no room for doubt as the letter 'ha' , is followed by 'ऋ’ (and not र - अन्तस्थः) ।

Same is the case with सुहृत् and हृक्रोरन्यतरस्याम् ।

  

In the case of ह्रुह्वरेश्छन्दसि , since , in both the letters ह is followed by र and व , both ह्रु and ह्व are to be pronounced as औरस्य ।

  

However , as has already been mentioned , better to depend upon श्रुति , rather than spelling in Devanagari or Roman .

  

Even during the time of Patanjali , students were not paying special attention to शिक्षा ।

  

Irrespective of gender and caste , just like in the case of vernaculars and foreign languages today , much less number of people care for good pronunciation .

  

As a result प्राकृतम् is prescribed to some people in Sanskrit Dramas .

  

शिष्टाः are defined under पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम् (6-3-109) and they were very particular about the use of language , including pronunciation .

  

This is what is meant by the word संस्कृतम् , a language that has got संस्कार - सम् + कृ + क्त (नपुंसके भावे क्तः 3-3-114 ) , संस्कृतम् अस्य अस्तीति मत्वर्थीयः अच् , यथा दुग्धा गावः , विभक्ता भ्रातरः , - संस्कृतम् ।

  

संस्कृतं भक्षाः - is पाणिनिसूत्रम्।

  

आचार्य हरिनरायणभट्ट did a good विश्लेषणम् । Yesterday I forgot to mention this . We are thankful to him .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
