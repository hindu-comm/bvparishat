Namaste,  
  
Pronuncfiation of "aparAhnah" as "aparanhah", "madhyAnah" as "madhyanhah", "brahma" as "bramha", "vAhyam" as "vAyham", "AhvAnam" as "Avahnam" (or the popular "AvAhanam") can be well-taken. However when it comes to deciding whether "hrAsah" to be pronounced as "rAhsah" or "rhAsah" and "prahlAdah" as "pralAhdah" or "prahlAdah", your clarification will be necessary.  
  

Regards,
