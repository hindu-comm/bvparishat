Namaste,  
  

Yes, you said it. This reminds me of what Krishnamenon told to an Englishman. He told "I did not pick up English like You did, I learmt the lamguage". One, who learns a language properly, is expected speak and write it correctly. May be, in the ancient times the women and the children in the brahmin families just picked up the language and they communicated with the people of other varnas in the common language and the latter could have contaminated their speech. When I visited the Sanskrit speaking village Matthur (Mattur) near Shimoga, I was amazed at seeing the small children speaking Sanskrit fluently. Manu did talk about the existence of two bhAshAs then.
