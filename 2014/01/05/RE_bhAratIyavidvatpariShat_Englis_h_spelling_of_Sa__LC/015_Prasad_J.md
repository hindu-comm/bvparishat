Thank you Sastry ji and Bhat ji for your replies.  
  

I have not studied shikShA but just heard from people that both 'ha' and visarga are pronounced from kaNTha. Is it true? Also I have heard that we pronounce visarga short, with sudden stop, when it comes in between of the verse, but pronounce it full when it comes at the end of half or full verse. I may be wrong on this. What is that full pronunciation of visarga and how will be that different from ha-varNa?  

Also interesting to know how would we pronounce devahaH? At the of the verse, I always pronounced as devahaha. In the middle of verse, however, I pronounced visarga with sudden stop.  
  
  

Regards,  

J Prasad.
