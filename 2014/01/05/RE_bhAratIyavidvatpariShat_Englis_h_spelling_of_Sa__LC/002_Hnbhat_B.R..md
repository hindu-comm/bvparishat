Thanks for Prof.Korada, for the explanation for pronouncing the "h" "as if it is the second letter". for the word उरस्य or औरस्य in the Panini's ShikSha, following the line of Kaundinya ShikShaa ---

  

**कौण्डिन्यशिक्षा -**

  

**हकारान्नणमा ऊर्ध्वाः पूर्वं तु प्रसरन्ति हात् ।**

**  
**

which almost follows the explanation. It is almost the same as Prof. Korada has interpreted combining both:

  

"Here, in all, the हकार is to be pronounced ****as if it is the second letter**** . The sound should emanate from the उरस् (chest)"

  

Please note the emphasis "as if it is" and not exactly it is changed as the second letter as "the न ण म - letters that follow "ह" moved backwards from ह.

  

So, if we take the Kaundinya's line literally, which strictly applied to अपराह्ण, अह्नाय, मध्याह्न, and ब्रह्म, to अन्तःस्थ-s, यरवल-s,

  

ह्यः - should pronounced as य्हः, and कह्लार should be कल्हार, प्रह्लाद as प्रल्हाद.

  

I could not see any problem with these. But,

  

In अर्हति गर्हाम्, the pronounciation is not different from the pronounciation of ह्रद, or जिह्राति, or ह्रादः।

  

And गर्ह्य will have to be pronounced as गर्य्हा (gar*yhaa*"

the "य्" moved before. Hence the "h" it is "as if it is the second letter makes sence.

  

There may some particular cases, where there won't be differenciation would be similar. In short, the sequences, like the "rh" अर्हा, गर्हा may not different in pronounciation from the "hr" sequence in "ह्रा"\| For other y, v, l there is no combination as "yh" "vh" or "llh" I have seen and in those cases, there is no problem of confusion between the two in pronunciation.

  

I was thinking or उरस्य or औरस्य, वर्ण as special as it is not the place of origin of sound स्थान for any other वर्ण-s listed in the alphabet. But only for this particular case and it looks strange in others "as if it is the second letter" in the above sequences and not as it is the second letter in अर्हन्, अर्हः etc. गर्हा, गर्हते, गर्ह्यः etc. as it would abolish the difference between the two sequences.

  

I hope this is the intention of explanation of उरस्य of Panini in accordance to Kaundinya Shiksha.
