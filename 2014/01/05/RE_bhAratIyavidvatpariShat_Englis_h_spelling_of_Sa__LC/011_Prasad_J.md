Namaste,  
  

Thank you Prof. Korada Mahodaya for you answers. This thread is indeed becoming interesting.  
  

I have one question about pronunciation.  
  

How to pronounce devAḥ at the end of a verse? Will it sound devAhA or devAha? I feel it should be devAhA but some scholars debate it for devAha. Also any reference from shikShA-grantha?  
  

Regards,  

J. Prasad
