Dear Dr. Bhatji,  
  

You said as follows and you used the most adequate expression "as if - - - - overlapping" and that removes all the misunderstanding :  
**  
**

**Quote**

  
the case in ब्रह्म which is not written as ब्रम्ह, but heard as if they are overlapping.  

**Unquote**  
  

Even for a layman the light hissing sound of "h(a)" in "Brahma" is almost blacked out by the dominant sound of "m(a)".  
  

Regards,
