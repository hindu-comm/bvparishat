Alright. You are depending on how you pronounce : visarga in ful and visarga short.

  

As you have already heard, (if you have correctly heard what is pronounced by others), it is pronounced as कण्ठ्य as per अकुहविसर्जनीयानां कण्ठः, equally for कवर्ग and अकार also.

  

The question discussed in this thread is about हकार which is pronounced as कण्ठ्य, but in combination with certain letters following listed, unlike other कण्ठ्य-s, it is pronounced as उरस्य, and it is unique in pronounciation, which is not in common with any other वर्ण of the alphabhet. It is heard as if it is म्ह, ण्ह, etc. but never written like that and it is a Unique pronounciation called उरस्य and looks like swaped their position in pronounciation.

  

Now coming to the pronounciation, it is correctly pronounced, but how do hear the विसर्गः - which undergoes in Sandhi, different forms, which are recorded and written as they are pronounced as in Sandhi. Now your case

it is in isoloation, विसर्ग without anything to follow or विसर्ग itself, in certain cases. How do you distinguish the same विसर्ग in देवः, कविः, शम्भुः as ह, हि and हुः or alike as ह?

  

It is sometimes heard like ह, हि or हु but not ह, but इ, or उ imposed on विसर्ग, like the case in ब्रह्म which is not written as ब्रम्ह, but heard as if they are overlapping.

  

अयोगवाहा विज्ञेया आश्रयस्थानभागिनः।(14)

  

rules the position of विसर्जनीय, sharing the place of articulation, on which they are imposed. So, the articulation points of अ, इ, उ are shared by the विसर्गनीय also, resulting in the pronounciation as if ह, हि, हु etc. but never देवह, हरिहि or शम्भुहु as it is mistaken, but heard like it.

  

Others may have offer their opinion on this question.

  

Others may debate on what is आश्रयस्थानभागिनः for the अयोगवाह letters. This makes the difference between the pronounciation, रामं (वन्दे) and रामम्. as both are heard alike.
