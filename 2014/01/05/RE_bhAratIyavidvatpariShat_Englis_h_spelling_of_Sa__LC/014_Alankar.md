Paranaam learned scholars and Guruvars,

  

A very interesting thread discussion is going on, and I am overwhelmed with the depth of knowledge.

  

Still I am confused to use the words used as examples, Is there a sammati how these should be pronounced for us 'atyalpagyaanis'.

  

ब्रह्म, ब्रह्मा, प्रह्लाद, आह्लाद, सुहृद, ह्यः,आह्वानम् , मध्याह्न etc.

  

Thanks,

Alankar
