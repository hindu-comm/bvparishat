Respected Scholars, Namaskar!  
  
Dear Dr. H.N.Bhat,  
  
Thanks for helping me on etymology of the word Gardabha. DR. BVK asked the question-whether my invented meaning of the phoneme /g/ fits to the meanings of Ganes'a, Garuda and Gardabha. For first two I had no problem. Now sometimes people refer to Sanskrit names of animals, plants and metals. I do not know from where these names originated. If any book is available on the etymology of names of plants, metals, please let us know. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
