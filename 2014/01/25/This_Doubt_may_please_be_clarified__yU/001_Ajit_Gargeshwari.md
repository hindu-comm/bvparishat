This is simialr to wife who is a women are called भार्या (feminine) and दाराः (masculine) and कलत्रम्i (neuter). If this usage is allowed then why not for संस्कृतम् (neuter ) and भाषा (feminine). Sanskrit genders are not like English I hope this helps. I don't understand the question of Ramachader.
