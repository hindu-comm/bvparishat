I thank Shri HR Bhattji for his convincing explanation.

Sirs,  
My copy of Valmiki Ramayana has this Text.

  

***yadi vaacam pradaasyaami dvijaatiriva samskRtaam***

***raavaNam manyamaana maam bheetaa seetaa bhavishyati***

***  
***

According to this version, during the times of Ramayana, not all men/women spoke Sanskrit, but only the twice-born. 

  

Any comments.
