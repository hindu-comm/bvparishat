Namaste

  

I deeply mourn the loss of a great grammarian of Samskrutham and kannada; a sahrudaya of highest order, a poet and vedantin.

  

I propose that a fitting memory lane program be organized at karnataka sanskrit university and kannada sahirya parishat to pay tributes recognizing tbe contribution of vidwan Sharma to Samskrutham, Kannada and vedanta.

  

Please do let me know how may i be of support in organizing this program in Feb third week.

  

Regards
