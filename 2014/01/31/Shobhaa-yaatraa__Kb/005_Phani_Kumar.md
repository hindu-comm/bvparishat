Namaste. Very true,Bhatt Sir. The usage of the word appears to be quite common in many languages,though. There was a movie in Marathi by this name. When Shri Guru Granth Sahib is taken out in procession, it is called shobhyatra of the Holy Granth in Punjab and elsewhere.

One finds that words originating in one language , when they represent a popular activity etc, will often find favour with speakers of another language while engaging in similar activity. Words like "bandh", "dharna" are two such. In the days of popular press and and TV channels, spreading of such usage to climes other than the place of its origin is not dificult at all.Shobhayatra could be no different.Shobhayatra differs from these words only in being a sanskrit compound. So looking for it source might well become a profitless pursuit.

Shubhnaam is another word which is becoming quite common in many languages. One may soon be tracing its source.(I have even heard its english equivalent "good name" as in "What is your good name?", though no native speaker of english uses such an expression.)

Thank You.
