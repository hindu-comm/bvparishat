Literally, yaatraa can convey the idea of 'walking, marching'. However, it has also acquired the sense of 'fair' (as in "country/county fair") and 'carnival', (especially in the form "jaatraa/jatraa) where there is a lot of movement and walking from one stall or tent to another or merry-go-rounds, roller-coasters etc. but not exactly a procession or processions. Secondly, if the context is capable of indicating that an elaborate, noticeable, continuous or public worship of a deity will take place, it is not necessary to add a word connoting 'beautification. decoration' or 'auspicious' etc. Such is the case in the Anargha-raaghava passage because of the words 'bhagavata.h puru.sottamasya." (A similar observation can be made with respect to Bhava-bhuti's phrase "hbhagavata.h kaala-priya-naathasya yaatraayaam".)

  

Where contextually a need is felt to specify or emphasize that 'decoration, showing off' or 'merriment' is involved ";sobhaa" is added (in India 'reverence', 'religiosity' and 'merriment' can go together). So, ;sobhaa-yaatraa can be used for a marriage procession (the bridegroom riding a decorated horse or the married couple riding in a buggy or chariot), the procession celebrating a person's Jaina diik.saa, Lord Jagannaatha being taken out in a chariot, and so on.

  

In the context of this discussion it should be remembered that associations with shared Skt words are not exactly the same in all parts of India. They are frequently only similar.

  

The semantic phenomenon involved is essentially the same as in "yaatraa" and "tiirtha-yaatraa" (although different vigraha-vaakyas may be offered to explain the compounds ";sobhaa-yaatraa" and "tiirtha-yaatraa"). In some parts of India, "yaatraa" by itself is commonly understood in the sense 'pilgrimage' and the addition of "tiirtha" is not deemed necessary unless there is some contextual necessity.
