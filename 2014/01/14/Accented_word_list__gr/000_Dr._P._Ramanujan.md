Samhitas necessarily retain accents in tradition.



Pada-patha is the authentic list of accented Vedic words.



Accent is not there in Brahmanas of most shakhas except, Krishna YajurVeda fully and Sukla YajurVeda partially (due to bhashika svvara).



Aranyakas and Upanishads also except Isavasya and Taittireeya&Mahanarayana are unaccented.
