Namaste

  

IF. Veda is \< mantra-brahmana> According to meemamsaa tradition

  

AND

  

Vikruti patha's are paurusheya as generally understood,

  

THEN

Which discipline dictates the Swara- shifts between Samhitaa as rishi darshana. And ashta vikruti patha classification as paurusheya? Why? Is vikruti patha also to be treated as darshana?

  

Vedanta schools may do away with swara issue and go by the esoteric tatparya vrutti. Indologists are indifferent and insensitive to this issue, as they deal veda as a document of history in a dead / classical language.

  

But mantra- yajna viniyoga can not do away with swara. This is the crux point of samskrutham from veda as the language of yoga- aagama - tantra - ayurveda traditions. Any school teaching this aspect of samskrutham ?

  

Without this tagged clarity, the word in computational linguistic
listing- scripting- analysis could be heading to a dangerous end. The essential foundation of  Veda- varna/ vaidiKa pada = accented sanskrit word which is given in taittireeya as \< varnaH swaraH, mAtrA balam, sAma santAnAH> is destroyed.

  

Swadhyaya- japa / dashagranthee parayanam guidance on traiswarya/ text only is a practice guidance(- anushasanam) with a specific goal like rakshaa, asandeha. That is not the issue here.

  

Please clarify further.
