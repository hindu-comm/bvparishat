@Veeranarayana Pandurangi : Thanks for the pointer. I will work on it and get back.  

@ Sampath Kumar - Sir, the manuscript has 150 legible, but the last letter is not legible. Is it possible to search for 1502,1503,...1508 as well ? Mostly it is in vikrama samvat, as in western belt - this was preferred mode of calendar. but not sure.  
  

Thanks for the help
