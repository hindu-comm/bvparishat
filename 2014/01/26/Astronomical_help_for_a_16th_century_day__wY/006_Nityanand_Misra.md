I do not have an answer - I do not use any Panchanga software. However, one needs to be extra cautious while using Panchanga software packages for dates before 1750s. 1752 CE was the year when the Gregorian calendar was adapted in Britain and to correct the old Julian calendar, 11 days were "deleted" from September 1752. September 2 1752 (Wednesday), was followed by September 14 1752 (Thursday).It was not until the early twentieth century that all European countries changed to using the new Gregorian calendar, this is the reason why the Russian Revolution of 7 November 1917 was called the "October Revolution" as the Russians were still using the Julian calendar right till 1917. The Panchanga maker for our Ashram, Dr. Ramadhar Sharma (a PhD in Mathematics in addition to being a scholar of Hindi and Jyautisha) told me once that several popular Panchanga software packages do not correctly handle this Julian to Gregorian shift.

  

There should be a quick way to check, if the software does not flag any warnings or errors for Panchang for any of the "non-existent" dates between September 3 and September 13 1752 (both included), then it does not handle the dates before September 14 1752 correctly and the Panchanga shown for older dates is incorrect.
