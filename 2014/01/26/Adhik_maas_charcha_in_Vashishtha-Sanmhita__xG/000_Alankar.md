Namaskar Vidwatjjan !

गणतन्त्रदिवसस्य शुभकामना: !!  

  

I found a reference of Adhik maas at following link :[Adhik Maas](http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jj_JpunW_8YC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=adhik+maas+32&source=bl&ots=B1JSh1Mt7a&sig=7cJ9SrD2lUgQ208BjXytXAN-f-8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_sfgUom6BqnOiAe3xYGgBA&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=adhik%20maas%2032&f=false), Which says that Adhik maas has been discussed in Vashistha-Sanghita. When I got Vashistha Sanghita from DLI, I couldn't get any reference of Adhik maas in vashishtha Sanghita. I have read many a pages on internet which refer the same thing but could any one of you guide me towards the shlok in Vashishtha Sanghita ?

  

Thanks,  

Alankar
