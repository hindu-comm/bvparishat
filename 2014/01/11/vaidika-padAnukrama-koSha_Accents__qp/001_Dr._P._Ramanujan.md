I am interested in Vedic indices and OCR for accented texts. If someone is wanting to work, I could participate in checking and cleaning up.

My site [www.parankusa.org](http://www.parankusa.org) has pada-patha of RgVeda and Krishna YajurVeda. Also, SamaVeda pada is available. These are in Devanagari script.
