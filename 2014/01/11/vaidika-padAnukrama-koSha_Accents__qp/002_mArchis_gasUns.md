Dr. Ramunajan,

  

Thanks for your interest in list of words with vedic accents. There is one more person from BVP from Bangalore who was interested in this project two months ago. I can make an OCR of fine quality, but DLI scans are of miserable quality. First step would be to find all the volumes in a library (they are not cheap so I can't afford to order them from Russia) and re-scan them with 300 DPI grey scale or even 600, but 300 should be just enough. It's a simple task, but just scanning would take 2-3 weeks. After that I would run Oliver's OCR engine and that is where the real work starts - we get a dirty text to edit. It would take not less than 5 years, if there would be two people involved. Because it's not a day job, so maybe even 10-15 years. But anyway it would be finished before the Poona Dictionary get till middle of "a".

  

M.G.
