Namaste



On \< the biggest list of accented vedic words \> ? In which case the entire documents of veda is the \<total list>.



My understanding so far has been that ALL vedic words are ‘accented (Sa-swara). Is there any \< Vedic Word> which is \< Vi-Swara /Apa-gata –swara> ?



In \< Bhashaa> also we have \<swara>, which may not have that strict regulation compared to Veda.



Can some one clarify on this point ? In case there are \< Vedic words> without accent> ?



Regards
