Dear Colleagues,

I have a couple of Suggestions for the Sanskrit Commission.

  

\(1\) Sanskrit Literature dealing with Scientific and Technical
subjects is very vast and though some outstanding contributions are made to these fields,still,much work needs to be done,mainly because, most of the Texts are still found in the form of Manuscripts-scattered all over India.Such works be unearthed and studied by a team/teams of Sanskrit scholars and Scientists/Technocrats.Such collaborative endeavour will definitely bring some tangible results.

  

\(2\)  There are many printed Sanskrit Texts which need to be Critically Edited and studied from the Scientific points of view.One such successful attempt is/was recently made by Prof.Dr. R.N. Iyengar of Bangalore by publishing his book,viz.Parasharatantra-studying it from the Astronomical angles.

   

  

  On this background,I have one very important observation to make for wider consumption of the scholars.  
  

  There are very few Sanskrit scholars who can make a difference between Astronomy and Astrology.This observation is based on my personal experience -shared by Prof.R.N.Iyengar also. We had submitted a Proposal for a Critical Edition of Garga-samhita-only Astronomical Study,and not astrological-but,unfortunately,it was not approved,because the Experts(?) on the Committee of a Delhi-based Nationally Important Institute-devoted to the study/spread and Critical Editing of Sanskrit Texts-opined that it is a work on Astrology.We sent an explanatory note supporting our view-point in response to that Official Letter,but ,to our dismay,we never received any reply.

  

   If we Sanskritists behave with this status-quo-ante-ism and with closed eyes and vision,it is the responsibility of the Commission Members firstly to enlighten our so-called Experts to make a sincere effort to widen their vistas and look beyond their limited vision(?).Then only Sanskrit will have a really bright future and utility in modern times also.

  

  It is absolutely important that We Sanskritists embrace a multi-disciplinary approach in consonance with the times to uplift the position of Sanskrit.  

 

  I beg a pardon of the scholars if I had inadvertently hurt their feelings with some of my strong(or caustic) words,based on experience.

  I wish success to the Commission in its Task.

  

  Thanks and regards,
