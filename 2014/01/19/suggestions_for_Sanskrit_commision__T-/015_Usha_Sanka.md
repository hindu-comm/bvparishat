Respected Sir

My request was simply to change the existing spelling of Sanskrit to "samskrtam" (that's my suggestion- if elders find a better replacement then they might suggest, which will find its nearest sound to संस्कृतम्.)

I do not know what historicity of some word matters when we want to change it, because we are seeing its bad effects on samskrtam community.

Question here is not about historical prominence of that word"Sanskrit" but its being wrongly pronounced. "Sanskrit" needs change, and let it be started from spelling- that represents the Divine Language.

People do change their places' names, their own names when they feel that the spelling is wrong or it leads to wrong pronunciation of the intended sound. It is quite natural in the world.

When Bombay changed to Mumbai, Calcutta to Kolkata, Peking to Beijing - it was not historicity of the word that mattered, nor who gave it when, but it was wrong name with wrong pronunciation that was in question. People looked for what was right for them, chose it, fought for it, got it- but never cared its Historicity or even phonetics. And whole world took it without question and changed in their records started to pronounce it very consciously. No one questioned later ever again. Now no on e asks, why Mumbai, why not bombay? Same we can expect for samskrtam too, in future.

There might be many reasons for distortions in sounds and spellings (especially when in case with a language like English - which can just change anything to anything, - "a" alone has 8 different sounds- I was told in my MA class, and we all know Shaw's example of "ghoti" = Fish. Shakespeare himself used 16 different spellings for his name, but interestingly never used what we use for his name now.)

But when one gets an opportunity and need to change something bad, and wrong, then one has a just reason to go for it. Yes, it is to some extent emotional need of the people too.

1\. Since the commission has given me an opportunity to ask for some issue that concerns me,

2\. and since and only since I heard always "samskrtam" very clearly always- and not सेंस्क्रिट्/ स्यांस्क्रिट्/ सैंस्क्रिट् from the Indian speakers when they pronounced the word,

3\. Since many people insisted for the same in different seminars and educational group meetings, and individual requests, (I am just giving voice to all those people's words and thought)

4\. the need was deeply felt in me, that time has come for a change,

5\. since I heard in my Grammar class clearly that it is "m" that an anusvara sounds when preceded by "sa" (as I was myself an advocate of "n" not "m" previously- and was defeated with enough evidence from vyAkaraNa and shikSha)

I found it useful issue to raise for. These are my reasons.

Since this is a language issue, it is quite natural to look for phonetic grounding. I request elderly members in the group, who are more learned than me in the group to speak on it. Because Sanskrit/Samskrtam is not my personal question, but related to everyone who are attached, connected with her. She is everyone's mother equally, not my own.

  

Whether they take action upon it or not, I personally request the commission members to give a serious thinking to this issue and make it one of the points of proposal.

Thankyou.

-Usha
