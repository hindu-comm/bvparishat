You have missed the point. Douglas Harper was not cited for pronunciation, rather it was cited for the fact that the word Sanskrit was first used in Western languages in 1610s. There cannot exist an "Indian pronunciation source" to ascertain the historical use of a word in a European language.

Grammar and sound science are not exclusive. Only grammar can teach optional forms of different words not Shiksha. Anybody who thinks otherwise is mistaken.

I did not advocate any pronunciation (I wonder if you read arguments and bother to comprehend them or simply respond). I have a theory about the spelling with n. Even if you hear the way "Sanskrit" is pronounced in French -

<http://www.larousse.com/en/dictionaries/french-english/sanskrit/70119>

The tilde in IPA indicates nasalization of the vowel. The consonant 'n' is not pronounced. The audio is here

On the contrary, rejecting a source without even understanding what it is being used for is a bad idea. The Century Dictionary was cited to show that three variant spellings of the word existed in the past. That is not an "Indian issue" - that is a "Western historical fact". Having edited Wikipedia for multiple years on Indian topics and having been involved in multiple WP:RS discussions, I very well know what is a reliable source and what is not.

There seems to be communication gap. I would suggest you read my mails again before responding. If I explain a linguistic phenomenon, I do not recommend we follow the same.

Please go ahead and ask. I wish you luck. But it is going to be a long shot for the commission to change established English (and Spanish and Portuguese) spellings.

I would not say you were rude, but you seem to argue without understanding the point being made by the other person.
