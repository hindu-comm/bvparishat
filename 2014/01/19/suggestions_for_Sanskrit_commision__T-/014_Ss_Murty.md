Respected scholars,

The Commission should recommend to Govt.  that:

1\) samskritam should be a compulsory subject upto high school level so that the foundation will be strong enough to study further in the
colleges and universities.

  

2\) in the examinations samskritam paper should be answered in samskritam only I.e. In Devanagari script.

  

3). Spoken Sanskrit should be introduced as one of the subjects from high school level.
