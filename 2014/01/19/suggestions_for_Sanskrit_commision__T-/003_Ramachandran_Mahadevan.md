Dear BVP Members,

  

Public libraries in Delhi,Calcutta,Mumbai and Chennai

Are to be supplied with a copy of each book

Published in India as per Act promulgated

In the 1950s.

  

I am in Bangalore.

Those who are in these principal

Cities should check the Sanskrit

Section in these libraries.

  

Warm Regards

  

Ramachandran M
