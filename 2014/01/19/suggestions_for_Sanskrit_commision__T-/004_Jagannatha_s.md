**there should be some provision / scheme to get digital copies of those manuscripts, which are stored in the India Office Library, London etc.**

Respected Vasantkumarbhattavaryaah, namaamsi bhuuyaamsi \|



Yes sir, there is no iota of doubt.

I have heard some bad stories regarding demand of hefty fees from mss. libraries of foreign countries for providing digital copies of mss.(Now a days this diseace isspreading slowly among even the mss. libraries of our country )



**Public libraries in Delhi,Calcutta,Mumbai and Chennai  
Are to be supplied with a copy of each book  
Published in India as per Act promulgated  
In the 1950s.**



Dear Ramachandran sir, thank you for this information.

Thereis necessity of inclusion of all the public libraries of our country, or at least, p.libraries of all major cities in the said act.

At present, only a few old Samskrta books are inthe public library of Mysore(opp. Ayurveda College)
