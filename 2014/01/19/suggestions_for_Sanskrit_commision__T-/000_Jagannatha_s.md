Aaryaah, svasti \|



It is expected that members of BVP are going to give suggestions to Sanskrit commission.

These are two suggestions from my side :

The commission may create-

1.A scheme for all the public libraries of our country to purchase Samskrta books.

2.A uniform policy for providing digital copies of mss. preserved in Manuscript libraries to the research scholars.
