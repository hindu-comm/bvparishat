If two forms are valid, one can use any of them. In fact in olden days both “Samskrit” and “Sanskrit” spellings were used. You can check this by referring to the Century Dictionary, Vol. VII, Page 5336. An image of the page is attached.

Missed a word in typing. That should read “In case of संस्कृतम् as there is no vowel at the end” – it is clear from what follows – “and hence no scope for 8-4-56” –since 8-4-56 applies only to vowels at end of sentences. Please refer the rule.

Nothing to do with optional valid Paninian forms? Why? When two forms are valid, both are correct as per Panini.

Did I say it is not valid? I said all 18 are valid, out of which सँस्कृतम् is one.

Please refer SK or LSK or any work on Shiksha to know this.

It is my opinion, since both "Samskrit" and "Sanskrit" were used in English earlier (Century Dictionary). "m" for Anusvaara, and "n" for Anunasika seems to be the reason.

There are examples. Refer pronunciation of French preposition “sans” (without) – the last s is silent and the n nasalizes the previous vowel. The word exists in old English too, Shakespeare has used it in the exact same meaning of "without". Refer Jaques' monologue in Act II Scene VII of *As You Like It -  
  
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,  
That ends this strange eventful history,  
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,  
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.  
  
*The composition of As You Like It (c. 1600) and first publication (c. 1623) is the same time when "Sanskrit" was first used as per Etymology Dictionary. Subjective probability is significant that "n" was for nasalization.

It is well known that Candrabindu (Anunasika) is for nasalization of vowel. It is also well-known that “n” in French is for nasalization of vowel. You can find sources easily for both. Please consult SK, LSK, Shiksha works and French pronunciation guides.

I do not know, but less likely. India was under the rule of Jahangir in 1610s.

The script for English is not phonetic. Then why bother?

I use both - "n" where the readers are not familiar with the language (and expect the standard English seplling), and "m" (or "ṁ") where they are. However for standard English, I do not recommend changing the current spelling.

Pronunciations of thousands of Indian words have changed in English. It is a natural linguistic phenomenon. Better correct our own pronunciation, than trying to change English spelling (as if the Commission could).

Now you are getting emotional. I am all for correcting pronunciation by Indians. But not for changing English spelling. Orthography in English is not as phonetic as some other languages (e.g. German), follows its own rules and evolves with time as per usage in English. Can the Commission change it?
