"reliable source?" more than Indian pronunciation?

"Samskrit/Sanskrit- both good?" Then let's take which suits Indian pronunciation. Obviously the first. Better than use second one- and let it become सेंस्क्रिट्, the first is much better option even if "wrong replacement". Lets get near ourselves, not English.

"rule?" You mean vyAkaraNa? Perhaps, no need- because शिक्षा is sound-science - vyAkaraNa can only tell what letter comes there.

"Nothing to do?" Yes.., when what we use is Right one.

Once what we use is valid, authenticated, then why worry about other forms and advocate their pronunciation in between?

True- how to pronounce is decided byशिक्षा. Butशिक्षाcannot be learnt from books and prints. It is by शिष्ट's उच्चारण that we always learn it. I always heard from Indian, traditional, samskrtam educated elders - majority of them, and so must have you, the anusvAra in the word in case as "m" and never otherwise. So it is more than authentic source for me- what elders say and how they pronounce it. (I was even asked to give up "n" by several authentic vyAkaraNa people, when I myself in ignorance advocated it).

"Century Dictionary"? Non-Indian source to decide upon Indian issues is a bad idea.

Many people from North India pronounce English as "इंग्लिस्" and some may put it in writing as well- and some time when it becomes popular, might find a place in Hindi Dictionary too.. with logic- that it is "there" in the people's speech. Then, will England change the spelling of English as "inglis"?

  

In DD Hindi news, I hear "चीन, रूस" for China and Russia respectively. Because my people say it that way- will those countries change their spellings? How can something out of native land become authentic source? Because it seems a reason to you?

"French""Jaques"?? I meant examples from samskrtam, not non-samskrtam. Let us not be bothered what changes to what in other languages.. as we have seen in case of "penchant"- two different pronunciations for same spelling. Sir, please I request you to stick to Indian sources for samskrtam. We are no more under a foreign rule. Let "us" decide the spelling and give them. Please..?

"French pronunciation"- No- I would not do it. I would stick to my Gurus', Elders' pronunciation, especially when it is right, and try to find a near by spelling to represent that in a foreign tongue.

"India was under the ruleof Jahangir?" Fortunately, now we are not. So let us - in this FREE India - think like Indians with Indian brains and refer to Indian authentic sources.

"why bother?" True. That's what I meant when I went for "samskrtam". Why bother about how English will take it? Bother what will be the fate of samskrtam in hands of English. We cannot leave her as सेंस्क्रिट् anymore.

"I do not recommend" - Instead of recommending different spellings, we can decide one which will represent samskrtam the best way and then everyone use the same? One "Sanskrit" for some kind of people, samskrtam(ṁ) for others, saṁskṛtam for yet other set of people? Do English people use things same way? "inglis" for some, "Inglish" for some and "Engleeshu" (ఇంగ్లీషు) for some?

"Better correct our own pronunciation," Yes- it will be achieved by changing spelling with immediate effect. Because "Written Word" reaches more people, for a longer time than spoken word. (as in case of Dictionaries that you quoted. They will never change even when the word needs. So lets not kill her with a spelling that takes away her life.)

"Can the Commission?" Let us at least ask them. Putting a proposal itself if opposed, then what can anyone say?

Previous Commission took some decisions and it decided fate of samskrtam all these years. We all are aware of the consequences. Now its time for us to decide her fate, and it is a question of the future generation, not past. So let us forget what mistake happened in 1600 (under Non-Indian ruling), or what is written in some age old (non-Indian) Dictionary, and look forward for a bright future and meaningful existence of samskrtam on this Earth.

  

Thankyou for letting me have a say. Sorry if I was rude. That was not intentional. (Previous mail went off before I could refine it- :)) It was not to hurt anyone. I am a deep lover of samskrtam, and want her have a better place - atleast in India (-Looking forward for the day when world will call her "bhArata").
