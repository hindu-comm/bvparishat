Namaste,  
  

I think the commission should urgently look at the etymology and meaning of different words at different historical times and particularly in different contexts.  
  
Let us look at meaning of the word "Kavi". Sometime ago in this very forum of the very learned scholars there was a discussion as to why the Adi Kavi Valmiki was not called the highest of the Kavis. What yours truly could think of at that time was that Hanuman was most likely considered a higher Kavi than Valmiki, by none other than Valmiki himself. What one may find most fascinating is the fact that Lord Krishna, the Main speaker of the Bhagavad Gita, himself have reportedly given a very different meaning of the word "Kavi", when he said in the "Geeta-saar" as follows :  
  
नवद्वारमिदं गेहं तिसृणां पञ्चसाक्षिकम् /  
क्षेत्रज्ञाधिष्ठितं विद्वान् यो वेद स वरः कविः //  
  

Similarly the word "Varsha" has been used in the Ramayana by Valmiki to mean "day", yet unfortunately the scholars have refused to accept that meaning of the word Varsha when it came to its use by Mayasura in his book on Jyotisha, which was composed before Valmiki's Ramayana. That had disastrous conbsequences in the interepretation of the span of the chaturyugas. I stop at this as a detailed discussion on the Chaturyuga would take a lot of space and time.
