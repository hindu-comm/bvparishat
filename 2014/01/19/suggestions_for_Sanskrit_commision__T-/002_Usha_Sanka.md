Namaste,

First suggestion from me would be-

changing of the spelling "sanskrit" (pronounced as सेंस्क्रिट् even by saMskRtaM scholars themselves). It should be better a "saMskRta", or "saMskRtaM" -the best. (saṁskṛtaṁ) or at least - "samskrtam" (since Roman diacritics are not everywhere available). Let it start with th ename of the commission- "samskrtam" commission.
