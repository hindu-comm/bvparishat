A couple of quick suggestions from me - some ideas overlap with what other members of the list have also suggested.

  

\(1\) Creation of a centralized digital library (searchable digital text, not scanned books) for Saṁskṛta works, financed by the Government of India and state governments, coordinated by a Saṁskṛta university, supported by all Indian universities which have a department of Sanskrit, and managed by Saṁskṛta scholars with a professional set of data standards, proofreading standards and editorial standards. For editing works in Saṁskṛta, I use many online resources for referring and searching digital Saṁskṛta text - for example GRETIL (Georg-August-Universität Göttingen), Cologne Digital Sanskrit dictionaries (Universität zu Köln), Pandanus (Univerzita Karlova v Praze), Sanskrit Heritage Site (INRIA), Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (Universität Heidelberg), Vedic Reserve (Maharshi University of Management), et cetera - all works of a professional set of people. I do not know of any such high-standard digital corpora from India. We have [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) with many texts, but is more an amateur work put together by a motley crew of volunteers rather than the university-standard corpora in the European and US universities. My dream would be to see the largest digital library of Saṁskṛta works hosted by an Indian university - a library which combines the best of traditional Indian scholarship with the latest technology, and is run in accordance with professional standards aimed at providing access to text with least pain. Digitized PhD dissertations can also be hosted. If it makes sense, the same library may also host manuscript scans - in which case it would be a digital text cum manuscript library. And all of this has to be free. Just like the corpora of the European and US universities. And professional - not like DLI which has the "Chalta hai" attitude written all over.

  

\(2\) Identification of steps needed to attract Indian and global talent to pursue doctoral and postdoctoral degrees in Saṁskṛta and related subjects in India. How many top-notch students do our Saṁskṛta universities attract from India and other countries? There are the rare exceptions like Daniel Ingalls Sr and Robert Svoboda, but can we say with conviction that one or more Indian universities are to Saṁskṛta studies what MIT, Stanford, Oxford etc are to Math and Statistics, in terms of publications, research and attracting talent?
