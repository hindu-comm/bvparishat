"Valid" anyway- right? So why go for others? Let us keep on it.

Let they be. We have nothing to do with them.

****संस्कृतम्****, is there in the list you give. Why not valid?

What is the pronunciation of अनुनासिक.? Where does it come from? Like what letter?

What source says nasalization is essentially "n"?

But unfortunately - I do not know any of foreign languages \[(except Indian English). Hearing the French pronunciation for first time. Thank you. Here as I observe from spelling - (if at all it matters in pronunciation- it hardly does in those languages) it is "n" followed by "v" and "n" followed by "b" - ("अम्वोम्वाम्ब्ला"if I hear it right- with an untrained ear).

Bad example- "penchant" has "n" followed by "ch" - which will essentially be equal to वर्गपञ्चम of thatवर्ग..what we find will be "ञ" in this case- UK one says- पँचन् kind of thing and US says a clear "n"

and here in संस्कृत the case is "--" followed by "s". So we need to fill in if its "m" or "n". Could you please cite examples where an anunAsika is followed by letter "s"?

Source please?? "Source for chandra-bindu sound equal to French sound etc."- please quote for Sanskrit Chandra Bindu too. Only then we could compare - right? Get a vaidika or laukika pronunciation for our benefit.

Right.

And so- fortunately, I never heard Sanskrit pronunciation in the light of any of these languages mentioned above. My ears always heard that word as "सम्-स्कृतम्" "సమ్-స్కృతం" whenever I pronounced the word - I said - "सम्-स्कृतम्" and not "सन्-स्कृतम्". Please try once sayingसन्-स्कृतम् yourself.(because as per you anunAsika =n; right?)

OK. Agreed.I would definitely want to know who transliterated it in 1600s. Indians?

It is matter of samskrtam- not English. If needed, we can break those standards. Better than spoiling our own words in the light of their "phonetically poor alphabet" spellings.

Fine. Once we decide upon "n" or "m" let us come to that. For me it is secondary. May be I would prefer second one. Would like to know your choice. Second too. Right?

Right.

But let the wrong pronunciation continue- killing every "samskrtam"

At least begin with India. Lets correct ourselves. World will follow. When we can accept other countries' reformations in spellings, why can't they ours? India no more wnats to spell Sanskrit. She wants "samskrtam". Who will object to native land's will (other than her own native people? :) )
