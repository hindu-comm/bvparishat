Fully agree with your thought

As first step, language teachers/lecturers at school/graduation level are to be trained with the

Developed class wise material . This may take hardly 6 months if we attempt sincerely by using

Media too. Training may take one year ( total strength)

Next development of texts based on the try out with the trained teachers/ lecturers

Then at the school level trained personnel can implement as compulsory subject.

If this thinking process is amicable, then make use of it

With best wishes
