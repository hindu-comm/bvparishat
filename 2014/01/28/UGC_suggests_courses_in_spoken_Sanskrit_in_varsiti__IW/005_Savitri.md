Good efforts.

As an educationist, suggest to implement SANSKRIT Bhasha at the basic level itself I.e.

From Primary level itself as Second Language.....Sanskrit/Hindi in the context of THREE LANGUAGE

FORMULA.  Or.  In the case of Two language formula.."......Mother toungue as first language and  
Sanskrit ......as Second language

If acceptable, then make it compulsory at the school level itself is my strong opinion
