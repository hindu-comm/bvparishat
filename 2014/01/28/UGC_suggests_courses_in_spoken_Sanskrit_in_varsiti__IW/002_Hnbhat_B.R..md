I agree completely with Prof. Jha.

  

The need to implement the plan is the meeting of the man power sufficient to implement the plan. Training the teachers in service and the fresh out come of novice Teachers with the newly planned Teaching Materials improvised in the first place is the first need. Also outcoming Acharya-s should be provided necessary training before they come out of the Institutions of Teachers' Training, Vidyapeetha-s or Teachers Training Colleges as the case may be.

  

Then only the plan of reforming the Education of Sanskrit may be successful.
