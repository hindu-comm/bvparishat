Dear Dr.Varkhedi,

Sincere thanks for this pioneering effort in popularising Sanskrit and trying to project its utility in modern times also.

There are some persons-not from Sanskrit background,but,interested in the study/spread of Sanskrit- who are trying their best to arrange to teach Sanskrit right from the Nursery level-which should not be difficult for a child to learn.This scheme should try cover such individuals/agencies also,so that there is a large-scale effort in this direction.It goes without saying that first the Teachers-who intend to impart this to the participants-must be well-equipped with the modern techniques/tools [etc.to](http://etc.to) improve their performance-without any iota of inferiority complex.

My best wishes to you and all involved in these yeomen services.

  

Prof.Siddharth Wakankar
