Compliments to Dr Varkheri and his team !  
Indeed it's a good news. Now what is required is the vision to make use of this golden opportunity. Fresh teaching materials are required to be developed on scientific methods developed by Linguistics and equally important is to train the teachers who will teach them accordingly. Emotions should not be allowed to overpower rationality.
