Namaste,

  

Definition of the Indic Akṣara on p. 70-71 - anything to add to it?

It is the first definition that is a good one, academic and full.

It uses a RegEx style, what is even better and has a practical use.

Indic Akṣara V\[m\]\|{C\[N\]H}C\[N\](H\|\[v\]\[m\]) - structure of syllable in Hindi.
