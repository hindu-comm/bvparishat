I have translated two children's novels. One was published by Samskrita Bharati. The second one is ready for printing. Third one is a collection of short stories on which I am still working..

  

1.Palayitaschanakah - It's a story of a small boy who ran away from home.

2.Sahasinah Balah - a story of four children among whom two children run away from home and meet the other two.

3\. Balah Svastana Paurah - discusses on contemporary problems of children like child labor, gender discriminatin, child education etc.,
