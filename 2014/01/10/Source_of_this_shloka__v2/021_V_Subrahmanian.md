Even without bringing in the three schools of Vedanta, one could look at this verse in the light of some verses of the Bh.GitA:  
  

dehabuddhyA tu dAsaH -  
  

In the Bh.GitA the Lord specifies:  
  
"मन्मना भव् मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरू \|  
मामेवैष्यसि सत्यं ते प्रतिजाने प्रियोऽसि मे \|\| 9.34  
  
Devote your heart, mind, religious sacrifices and prayers to Me for eternity O Partha, and you shall, without fail, attain Me forever. This is My promise to you, My devotee.  
  
यत्करोषि यदश्नासि यज्जुहोषि ददसि यत् ।  
यत्तपस्यसि कौन्तेय तत्कुरुष्व मदर्पणम् ॥  
Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give, whatever you practice as austerity, O Kaunteya, do it as an offering to Me. (9.27)  
  

Surely this practice is possible only with the identification with the body-mind by the devotee.  
  

jIvabuddhyA tvadamshaH -  
  
ममैवांशो जीवलोके जीवभूतः सनातनः ।  
मनःषष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि प्रकृतिस्थानि कर्षति "॥15-7॥  
  
"The Eternal; Jivatma in this body is a part, amsha, of My Own being; and it is that alone that draws around itself the Mind and the five senses, which rest in Prakrti."  
  

The devotee affirms this teaching of the Lord that he, as the jIva, soul, indeed is an amsha of that Great Being.  
  

AtmabuddhyA tvamevAham -  

##### उदाराः सर्व एवैते *ज्ञानी त्वात्मैव मे मतम्* । आस्थितः स हि युक्तात्मा मामेवानुत्तमां गतिम् "॥ 

#####  Lord Krsna instructs Arjuna : B.G. 7.18. 

#####  "Indeed all these are noble, but *the man of wisdom is My very Self;* such is My view. For such a devotee, who has mind and intellect merged in Me, is firmly established in Me alone, the highest goal."

The Lord has also said:

अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थित: ।  

अहमादिश्च मध्यं च भूतानामन्त एव च ।। 10. 20 \|\|

 O Arjuna!, I am the Ultimate Consciousness situated within the heart of all living entities and I am the beginning, the middle and the end as well of all the living entities.

The aspirant who also knows to discriminate the Self, AtmA, from the body-mind complex and the transmigrating soul, jIva, identifies himself with the Atman, Consciousness.

The advanced mumukShu identifies himself with the above feeling.
