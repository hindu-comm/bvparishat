Beg your pardon, but the questionable provenance of the verse (and  
thus its uncertain standing as a normative text) aside, it is hardly  
right to say that Dvaita is to be characterized as "dehabuddhyA."  
While one can (dis)agree with any Vedantic school on whatever grounds,  
one must admit that they are all "AtmabuddhyA" only; the Dvaita  
objection to being characterized as dehabuddhyA could be, for example,  
on the strength of न त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपाः, न चैव न  
भविष्यामः सर्वे वयमतः परम् -- i.e., that though the kings' bodies are  
to be destroyed (when they expire in the war about to begin), the  
entire multitude present is described as eternal.
