Yes. I don't think the verse appears in the Telugu work written in Telugu language in Champu format with both verses and prose sections in Telugu language throughout in three Ashvasa-s and I checked the beginning few pages and last pages and could not find any verse in Sanskrit language.

  

It contains two commentaries two in Telugu language and the commentary may contain some verse in Sanskrit quoted, but the member has not given any reference to the page number or verse number to check. I doubt whether he has read the work completely and really located the verse or just by guess he had written it is found, like other replies. Anyway, it is a philosophical work compiled from contents extracted from Sanskrit Brahmanda Purana, Adhyatmaramayana, and may be some other Samskrit Purana-s and composed completely in Telugu language.

  

For, Sankarachartya's Pancaratna has only five verses and there is not any such verse as available on the net. And Hanumannataka also doesn't contain it for the first look and one will have to go through about more than 200 pages and 14 Acts as there is no alphabetical verse Index.

  

The Anthology called Suktisudha or Suktisudhakara of Gitapress is not available online and could not be checked.

  

I request the member to provide the exact location of the Sanskrit verse in the book "Sriramanjaneya samvaadamu" .
