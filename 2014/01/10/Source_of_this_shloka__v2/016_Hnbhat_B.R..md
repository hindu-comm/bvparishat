OK. It seems they also have mistaken the Gitapress Edition. But it is a fact that only the last verse is from Hanumatpancaratna and it does not contain any more verses those the five as given in the text available online.

  

I could not check in any other editions of Hanumatpancaratna and it is obvious that Hanumatpancaratna has got only Five verses plus phalastuti as given in the page.
