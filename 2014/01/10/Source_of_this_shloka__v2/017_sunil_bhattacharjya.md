Namaste,  
  

What I understand that historically when Hanuman, as the representative of Sugriva, assumed the form of a (normal) human being and met Lord Ram for the first time in Kiskindhya, the latter asked him "Kostvam?". It was then that Hanuma told him that verse "deha - - - -". Thus this verse seems to have some Ramayana context.
