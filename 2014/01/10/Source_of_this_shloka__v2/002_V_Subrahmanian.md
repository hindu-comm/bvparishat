Here is a part of a mantra from the Brihadaranyaka upanishad 4.4.5:  
  

               काममय एवायं पुरुष इति।
            स यथाकामो भवति तत्क्रतुर्भवति।
              यत्क्रतुर्भवति तत्कर्म कुरुते।
             यत्कर्म कुरुते तदभिसंपद्यते॥

    You are what your deep, driving desire is
            As your desire is, so is your will
            As your will is, so is your deed
            As your deed is, so is your destiny

# “Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habits. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.”
