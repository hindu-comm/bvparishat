There are two readings entirely changing ihe meaning.

  

dehabuddhyaa **tvadaasosmi jeeva** buddhyaa tvadamshaka: aatmabuddhya tvameyvaaham iti mey nishcitaa mati:

  

<http://www.narayanashramatapovanam.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=321:dvaita-or-advaita&catid=50:ask-swamiji&Itemid=134>  

  

as appears in the above blog.

  

  

" dehabuddhyaa ***tu daaso'ham*** jeevabuddhyaa tvada.nshakah \|
Aatmabuddhyaa tvamevaaham iti me nishchitaa matih \|\| This

describes the situation of dvaita, Vishishtadvaita and Advaita.

  

In the first it clearly means I am not your servant tu+adaasa.h

  

and in the second, tu daasa:

  

This is from another group with both the readings, but without any reference to the context:
