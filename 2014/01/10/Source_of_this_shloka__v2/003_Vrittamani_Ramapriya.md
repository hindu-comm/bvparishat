Dear Scholars,

I am looking for the source and completion of the sloka that runs like:

  

dEha budhyA tavadAsO4smi

jIva budhyA tvadamsha:

Atma budhyA tvAmEvA4smi...

  

I understand this is a reply by Hanuman to Rama, but I could not locate that in the following Ramayana texts:

1.Valmiki Ramayana, 2. Adhyatma Ramayana, 3. Ananada Ramayana and 4. Adbhuta Ramayana.

  

I do feel obliged by your response (s).

  

Ramapriya
