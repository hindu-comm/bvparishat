Yes.

Yes, it is a mistake. Monier-Williams dictionary though very good has several mistakes which are not quite obvious and require knowledge of grammar to detect. Śabdakalpadrumaḥ and Vācaspatyam avoid these as there focus on Pāṇinian grammar is much stronger.

  

For example MW lists **gavī** as a word for speech under L=64340.2, and cites शिशुपालवध 2/68 as example.

  

# गवी

|                            |                             | |----------------------------|-----------------------------| | **(H2B)गव\[L=64340.2\]** | *f.*speechS3is3.ii , 68. |

  

This is grammatically wrong since taking **gavī** as a prātipadika in Śiśupālavadha makes no sense at all. The word is the compound**śeṣagavī** resulting from samāsānta suffix **ṭac** from **śeṣago** which is mandatory by **PS 5.4.92 gorataddhitaluki**. There is no possible Anvaya of**śeṣa** in the context of the verse if **gavī**is taken as independent word in the verse. Mallinatha's explanation of śeṣagavīḥ is Pāṇinian.

  

The approach I take with M-W is "trust, but verify".

  

PS: The translation "demi-god" for "deva" (used by ISKCON throughout) is also questionable from a grammatical point of view, since the word "deva" does not have the sense of either "half" or "minor".
