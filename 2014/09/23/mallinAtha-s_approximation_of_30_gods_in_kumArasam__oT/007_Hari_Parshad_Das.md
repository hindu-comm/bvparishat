dear nityanandaji,  
  

thanks for your reply and your views on Monier Williams. That is a really good explanation.  
  

as far as translating deva to demigod is concerned, it is not a purely grammatical translation but also carries philosophical connotations which can be found in many places (e.g. in Bhāgavatam 7.9.13)  
  

Much is lost in translation (especially the subtle connotations) and thus sometimes the translators add words to explain it better. For example, the word 'jāyakam' is explained by the lexicographers as 'jayati gandhāntaram'. In the original term, there is no conception of 'gandhāntara' but it is introduced by the lexicographers to clarify the connotation. Similarly, in the tradition of krishna-bhakti, the term 'deva' as found ordinarily in many places does not have the same connotation as the term 'deva' found in the Viṣṇu-sahasranāma. Therefore, translations are usually accompanied by philosophical connotations.  
  

regards,
