Your explanation is correct, but the Sanskrit it wrong. This is what Mallinatha has meant by त्रिः = त्रिरावृताः, दश = १० = त्रिदश - परिमाणं येषाम्। as clear by वयःपरिमाणं by another commentator.

  

It cannot be as you have given. You cannot have त्रिः दशाः - because the word is दशन् or दशा in the word.

  

You can have तिस्रो दशाः येषां ते - त्रिदशाः। Having three stages of life. and never have the fourth stage.

  

The same is meant by तृतीया दशा in the third stage of life = त्रिदश. where the word त्रि- stand for third. in compound, the suffix is lost.

This is already explained.

This has been explained by Ramashami.

It is परिमाण and not संख्या, as you have misunderstood. You have been misunderstanding all the definitions given in the beginning itself.

You yourself have included the definition in your first post, but wrongly explained in Sanskrit. त्रिः means त्रिरावृत्त the repeated number of times,"संख्यायाः क्रियाभ्यावृत्तिगणनेकृत्वसुच्" ५।४।१७ " द्विरह्नः" इति। "द्व्त्रिचतुर्थ्यः सुच्" ५।४।१८।.

  

Here it means ten multiplied by three, means thirty. त्रिरावृताः दश.

  

If it is applied, to दशा, the same, the three stages only in life. The last is alway permenant. तिस्रो दशाः येषां ते, or त्रिः दशा - त्रिरावृत्ता दशा. And hence तृतीया दशा येषां ते। Always enjoying the third stage यौवन only.

  

This is the whole of the explanations with the number दशन् or दशा - stage. And there is nothing wrong in the etymologies given by the commentators and Mallinatha.
