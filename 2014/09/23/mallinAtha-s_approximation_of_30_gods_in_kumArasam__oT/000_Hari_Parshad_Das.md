\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~  
  
dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams.  
  
While reading the formation of the word 'tridaśa' in various dictionaries, I found out that every commentator interprets this word in various ways to refer to the demigods:  
  
1) trirdaśāḥ yeṣāṁ sadā te tridaśāḥ - Those who are always in the third state of existence. If life is divided into a span of 100 years, the demigods remain eternally in the third decade (in other words they always remain 25 years of age). tridaśa as 30.  
  
2) tṛtīyā yauvanā daśā sadā yeṣām te tridaśāḥ — Those who are always in the third state of existence named yuvāvasthā or youth.  
  
3) trīn tāpān daśante te tridaśāḥ — Those who (have the capacity to) extinguish the three kleśas.  
  
Now someone pointed out to me that in Mallinātha's commentary to Kumārasambhava 3.1, he interprets tridaśa as 30 gods:  
  
tridaśān = trir āvṛttā daśa parimāṇam eṣām iti tridaśān devān (3 x 10 = 30 -- Please see attached screenshot)  
  
I wanted to ask if there is something wrong with this commentary? I have never seen anyone else approximating 33 to 30 before. Later lexicographers too do not include Mallinatha's definition in their kośas.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo' bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
