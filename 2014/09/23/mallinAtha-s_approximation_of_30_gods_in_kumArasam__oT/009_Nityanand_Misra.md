The word is listed in bothŚabdakalpadrumaḥ and Vācaspatyam.

  

In the electronic version of Śabdakalpadrumaḥ on the website of the Universität zu Köln, the word shows up when searched by the nominative singular form "tridazaH". Some words are indexed by the uninflected form, some by the inflected form. (Who wants an online digital dictionary offering POSIX regular expression search in Harvard-Kyoto? ME!!! Then I would just search for "tridaz.\*" and not be bothered at all.)

  

# tridaśaḥ

[TABLE]

In the electronic version ofVācaspatyamon the same website, the word shows up when searched by the lemma form "tridaza" instead

  

# tridaśa

[TABLE]
