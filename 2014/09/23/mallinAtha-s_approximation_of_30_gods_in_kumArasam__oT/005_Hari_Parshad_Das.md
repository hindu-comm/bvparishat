great. so the mistake is in misunderstanding parimāṇa as saṅkhyā when in actuality, it should be understood as vayaḥ parimāṇa. Am i correct?  
  

So I think Monier Williams also has made a mistake when it says that tridaśa is an approximation of 33 (please see attachment)  
  

thanks again and warm regards,
