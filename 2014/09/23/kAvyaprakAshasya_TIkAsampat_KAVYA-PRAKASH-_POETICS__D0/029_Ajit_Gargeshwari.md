\< . The **onus to publish** is on a research scholar but the **onus to digitize** and make manuscripts not in copyright accessible to all lies with the library that posses them. >  
  

Let me clarify what I meant to get editions out of manuscripts is the job of a research scholar that can be under copywright but to make manuscripts not in copyright accessible to all lies with the library that posses them as they are not under any copyright\\  
  

I never said one should not care for IPR are works in old manuscripts under IPR? No not at all.  
  

The below sentences are beyond my limited comprehension. If you would like you might explain. Thanks  
  

  
"Whose **onus is it to train and guard the pedagogy which shapes scholar of a tradition** ?  
  

In short, it is all about ‘naming the price’ and drawing the ‘ personal lakshman-rekha’ which is a convenient and flexible one ! Do one prefer to follow the old and older ancients (poorvaih poorvatarih krutam :: Rishi’s who created the knowledge document and shared it for loka-kalyana \> or stand by \< nootanaih rishibih :: like the IGNCA et al holders of manuscripts, \> ? What would be the right stand in a scenario of ‘Jnana-Panya’, in the words of Kalidasa?"

  

Regards
