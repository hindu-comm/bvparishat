Oriental libraries are the custodians of manuscript. I don't understand how can copy write laws apply to old manuscripts. It can only apply to an edited book based on the manuscript.does a library own the copy write of printed books the answer in no similarly for manuscripts. I don't think any commentator of Kalidasa, kavya prakasa except for modern commentaries held any copy write.  
  

When public money is used to support oriental libraries they are duty bound to make to make them accessible to interested people. In the age of digitization its easy to digitize and cost will always be less for the manuscript repositories if they do it. They can charge a fees to recover costs that perfectly fine.  
  

I am of the opinion since India has the largest collection of manuscripts government should pass law to make digitization mandatory and for institution that run on public money should with a charge give the digitized version to interested scholars. If they refuse action should be taken against them after all public money spent should help scholars and interested readers. Please note access to the originals should be always restricted for the trained specialist.  

I am opening a line of thought
