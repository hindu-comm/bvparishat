If they are not taught or do not understand simple laws as you say they should not be there is the positions they are in. You say it is up to the research scholar to publish unpublished that's right what about
thousands of manuscripts lying on the library shelf that should be digitized and made accessible that's what I have been saying. The onus to publish is on a research scholar but the onus to digitize and make manuscripts not in copyright accessible to all lies with the library that posses them
