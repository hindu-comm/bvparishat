My point was only to make out that the people in charge of the manuscripts nor their directors, do not understand it. I don't think there is any exception from the copyright for the old manuscripts, written centuries ago or any clarification that the rule do not apply the works of centuries ago in certain cases. Even if any, the people need not be aware of it.

  

They are taught/adviced about the importance of preservation of the valuable assets of India's Literature through such documentation and preservation courses every year and its Cultural its value. But not about the use of this invalubale heritage and bring it into light is one of the purposes of preservation. That is the up to the Research Scholars to bring into light unpublished works in the manuscripts.
