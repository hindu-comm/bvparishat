Your counting is wrong. It is not sanketa is counted as one, but these are three commentaries by three different authors which you have not noticed. And, as Prof.Ashok Aklujkar pointed out, the Kavyaprakasha Khandanam is not strictly a commentary, but a critical note in the strictest sense. This seems to be the reason for counting only 16 as commentaries.

  

But there should be 17 commentaries.

  

Of these, the first Sanketa by Manikya Candra has been published from ORI Mysore and some of the titles are already published, if not all.

  

Please see the attachment in the response of Ashok Aklujkar for a detailed assessment of the Edition.
