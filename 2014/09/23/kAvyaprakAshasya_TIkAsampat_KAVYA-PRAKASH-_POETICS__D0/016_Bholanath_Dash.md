Dear Sir,

Thank you very much for going through NCC and commenting on it. We are understanding your difficulties and feelings. Getting Manuscript is a big task. NCC is giving only information about the placement of the mss. Whatever records are available with NCC they are referred in it. It is not final one, time to time it is to be updated according to availability of data. For details of each Manuscript Catalogues, Hand lists and survey report kindly refer to Bibliography of NCC which is given in some volumes (Vol. I. XI. XV. XXVIII.) If possible visit the NCC library.

The volume you have commented on was compiled in 1968. Lot of efforts have gone over that. Many works have been done, many reports have come out. Why don’t you do a consolidated reference on Kavyaprakasa and its commentaries available in all the manuscript repositories, if you are interested in the text. If all our scholars will take up one one text, the reference will come out comprehensively and the entire world of scholars will be benefited.

NCC can do, whatever is available with it. If you have manuscripts and you do not share the list of them to NCC, how NCC will incorporate the reference. And yes, if the place is closed, do you think that NCC will drop that reference from its list? It is high time now for the scholars to think, how one will be able to get a copy. Yes, some places are closed, but do you think the famous ORIs are sparing the copy to you easily ?



NCC shows the light how and where to go.

Thanking you.

Sorry because we have the experience of hard work behind the NCC, it hurts us.
