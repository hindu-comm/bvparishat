Namaste



I have difficulty in understanding your later post reading \< . The **onus to publish** is on a research scholar but the **onus to digitize** and make manuscripts not in copyright accessible to all lies with the library that posses them. > Whose **Onus is to keep the right interpretation** and identity of a tradition ? **whose onus is it to keep to the standards of a language of text** ? Whose **onus is it to train and guard the pedagogy which shapes scholar of a tradition** ? 



Do I understand then that all that goes on in the name of ‘ Digitization –manuscript preservation’ et al is a way of :

- (I ) sugar coated tapping in to a Cultural Heritage of a language tradition for a premeditated purpose ?

- (ii) convenience of knowledge-trade with no bars of ruling law of IP /Patent or Scholarship, as a free for all to interpret and create sensation ?



In short, it is all about ‘naming the price’ and drawing the ‘ personal lakshman-rekha’ which is a convenient and flexible one ! Do one prefer to follow the old and older ancients (poorvaih poorvatarih krutam :: Rishi’s who created the knowledge document and shared it for loka-kalyana \> or stand by \< nootanaih rishibih :: like the IGNCA et al holders of manuscripts, \> ? What would be the right stand in a scenario of ‘Jnana-Panya’, in the words of Kalidasa?
