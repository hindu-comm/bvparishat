Yes, indeed. I could not get any such Edition with Google Search.

  

It will be helpful if the details of the Edition is given. The information in the "History of Classical Sanskrit Literature" of Krishmachariar (rev.Ed.1989) gives in sec.849 to 864 the detailed information about the commentators on Kavyaprakasha, with the commentaries available to him at the time of the compilation. And NCC also gives information to the published commentaries in addition to manuscripts.  

  

Thanks in advance.
