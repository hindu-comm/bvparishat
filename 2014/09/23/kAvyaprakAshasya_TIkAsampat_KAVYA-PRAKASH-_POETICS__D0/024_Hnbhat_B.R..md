"All rights reserved. The authors retain all copyrights in any text, graphic images and photos in this book. "

  

The authors allow publisheers to copy and publish for a period of years, but reserve the copyright with themselves.

  

This is what they mean. "book" may be in the manuscripts form or in printed form, but the rights vested in the writer of the book could not be time barred. for the purpose of copyright rule. So copying the manuscripts of the books written by the authors, for any purpose, would be violation of the copyrights law unless the publishers have purchased the copyright for royalty. Though the copyright law was made in recent centuries, for the custodians, they could apply the same rule. For them, they are like the printed Editions, books only in the manuscript form.

  

This is the reason why they raise such an issue.
