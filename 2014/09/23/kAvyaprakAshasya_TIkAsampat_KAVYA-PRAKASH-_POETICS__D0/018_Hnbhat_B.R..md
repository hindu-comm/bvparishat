Anyhow it is not the fault of NCC department or the compilations available in different catalogues or lists at a place, from different Libraries or private collections at the time of the compilation of the Volumes. From the time of compilation, till the publication of the volumes, many things might have changed. Many New Catalogues published by other Manuscript Libraries, have come out, and newer Volumes of the Catalogues. All the Catalogues do not follow the same system of Cataloguing.

  

It is up to the researcher to get a consolidate list, by checking the Catalogues/Lists referred to in the NCC and sort out existing/available manuscript work one is interested in. Then comes the question of accession to the manuscripts. There are some collections of Manuscripts made available online by the Institutions themselves, free or online payment. But many of the Manuscript Libraries (Gov. and Private) alike, do not even give access to their collection easily. There are several Jain Bhandagars which do not have permission even to allow their collection (considered holy) to outsiders. This was the condition when I was looking for the manuscripts.

  

In this digitalized age of every document, I don't there has been any improvement in the condition. Though digilized, they raise the issue of copyright as the custodians of the manuscripts, if you ask for a copy (even though they have any facility, mostly do not have or available for your use).

  

Most of the catalogued manuscripts are microfilmed and a copy kept at IGNCA. It is a good gesture of Humanity Sources Department to preserve to manuscripts. BUT the copyright issue makes to run around the Libraries to get a permission, even if they are available at present or at least only then you can know whether the mss. is lost and not available. IGNCA is also not responsible to give you the access to the manuscripts directly or if you want, provide a copy as they are not custodians of the original manuscripts.

  

This is my experience. These are some of the difficulties experienced by the scholars looking for manuscripts. But NCC or IGNCA, both are not responsible for these.
