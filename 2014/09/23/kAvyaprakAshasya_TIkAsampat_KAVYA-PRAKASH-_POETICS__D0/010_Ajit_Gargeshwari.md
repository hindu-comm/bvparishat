I always have a question on New Catalogus Catalogorum where can one get the manuscripts one mentions there, I know the palce is given.. Unless manuscripts are made accessible it might be of no use at all. One can mention a manuscript of this work is available XYZ place and if one wants to see it the place might be closed or not easily accessible
