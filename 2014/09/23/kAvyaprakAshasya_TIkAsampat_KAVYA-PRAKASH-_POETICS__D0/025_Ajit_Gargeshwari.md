For a large number of paper, britch bark manuscripts the rule does not apply. Recent unpublished manuscripts of authors if deposited in public repository then copyright laws apply This law will **not** apply to to hundred and thousands of old manuscripts kept at various oriental libraries and institutions.  
  

If I make a lot of money in **most cases not**, from a manuscript borrowed from a manuscript library then the library might want a share in the profits earned as I am using their material but that's not because of copyright laws.  

  

I do understand what you say giving an example if I compose a work and that is deposited in a manuscript library then copyright laws may apply but not for old works
