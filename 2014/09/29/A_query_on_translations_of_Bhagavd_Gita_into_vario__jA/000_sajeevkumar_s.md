Respected scholars, Greetings of the day!  

  
Could you please tell me into many languages Bhagavad Gita has been translated? Kindly give the authentic number of translations available in various languages.  

  
I have already searched on Google and there is no authentic information found.  
  

Thank you.  

Sajeevkumar
