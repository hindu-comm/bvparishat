Thankyou Ramachandran sir. I will wait for the copy.

Murty sir,Thankyou for the explanation. This clears my doubt.  

Just wanted to ask one question to all elders.

Eg. All the *laksmI-aShTottara-Sata-nAmas* are intact and only one *nAma* changes, or has a different reading in our books (ordinary publications). Then should we look for only authentic book sources and forget the rest? Or should we try to find reason why this change occurred at all..?

In this case gItA press gives "*kSIRoda-saMbhavA*" and never mentions "*krodha-saMbhavA*" at all. Then should I (in situation where an explanation as that given by Murty sir is missing) just leave the other *nAma* and go with one given by that "authentic" source??



Because in case of stotras (unlike *kAvyas* and *SAstras*) we come across many publications as they are near to *sAmanya-janas* (I mean non-Samskrta people).. and they to take it from some already prevalent sources. Generally people who want to read those stotras do not go for critical editions in the case of stotras..

\[Not to mention the singers who introduce many more mistakes in stotras by lack of knowledge. They care only for tune and voice but not correctness/existence of *pATha*.\].

If some one wants to know if a pATha is there or not, then what is the way? I also do not know if there exists any critical edition for stotras.. (even popular ones) at all till date!!

  

If there is none, then - one suggestion. Many aspirants of PhD keep asking for some topics.

Can they take a study of this and try to make a critical edition?

Can it be considered as PhD?

If at all someone wants to attempt at this topic, what should be the approach?

Where should one start looking for them?

As we have many different main-sources for stotras.. like *purANas, itihAsas* etc. can we at least try to bring one good volume with *pAThAntaras* (if possible with explanations)?  

Please guide me.
