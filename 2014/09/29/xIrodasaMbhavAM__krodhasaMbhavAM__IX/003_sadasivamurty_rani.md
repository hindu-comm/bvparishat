How can लक्ष्मी be क्रोधसंभवा..?  

I confine to answer this question in the present context.

To understand this a keen reading of Devi Bhagavata will be of a great help.

There are several episodes in Devi Bhagavata which explain the cause of Goddess Lakshmi's Re-birth from the Kshira sagara.

She took a decision to be born again from Kshira sagara because of the : 1. Anger of Durvasa against Indra 2. Anger of Vishnu 3. Her own Anger on two occasions.

1. Once Durvasa went to Heaven. Having greeted Indra he gave him a garland of Divine flowers. Then Indra was in a drunken mood sitting on the back of Iravata. I threw the garland carelessly in the head of Iravata. Several honey bees swarmed around the garland and started drinking the honey in it. Iravata got disturbed with the act of the bees and threw the garland on the ground hit with its feet. Durvas got angry with Indra and cursed him to fore go Svarga Lakshmi. Soon SVarga Lakshmi abandoned the Heaven merged in the Mahalakshmi in Vaikuntha.

2. The Mahalakshmi in Vaikuntha was the daughter of the sage Bhrugu and his wife Khyati. Bhrugu named her Lakshmi and made her the spouse of Vishnu. She was proud of her status and had a thought that it was because of Her Vishnu became rich. Vishnu understood her heart and kept quiet. Through years She started blessing both good and bad people equally with riches. Vishnu saw all this and advised her to be born again from the Milky ocean so that she would be Sattvik by nature to bless only good people. Mahalakshmi got angry with His words and put an end to her life as the daughter of Bhrugu. (This episode can be seen in Vishnu Purana)

3. Just before the above incident Vishnu and Siva were fighting against the group of demons named Halahalas. Being in invisible forms Gouri and Lakshmi were helping their husbands. Hari and Siva got victory over Halahalas. Having known that Gouri and Lakshmi were the source of their victory Hari and Siva got Angry with them. They had an exchange of Angry Words. As a result Gouri and Lakshmi quit them and by the advice of Jagadamba they were born again on two different occasions - Gouri as Sati and Lakshmi as the daughter of Kshira Sagara in Sagara mathana.

Even in the Hayagriva Avatara Vrttanta of Devi purana the anger of Lakshmi cause her to be born again.

Hence the epithet "krodhasambhava" has become a popular epithet of her.

Blessings,
