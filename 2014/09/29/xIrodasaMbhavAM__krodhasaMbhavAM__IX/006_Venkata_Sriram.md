Namaste,  
  
dEvi is indeed "krOdhasambhavAM" ie., One who is born from Anger. Let us see how.  
  
In dEvi mAhAtmyaM, the Mother Durga (also called mahAlakSmi) takes birth from the anger of shiva & viSNu. In 2nd adhyAya (vide sloka nos. 9 & 10):  
  
itthaM niSamya dEvAnAM vachAmsi madhusUdanaH  
chakAra kOpaM shambhushcha bhrukuTIkuTilAnanau .........9  
  
tatO(a)tikOpapUrNasya chakriNO vadanAtataH  
nishchakrAma mahattEjO brahmaNaH shankarasya cha ......10  
  
anyESAM chaiva dEvAnAM shakrAdInAM sharIrataH  
nirgataM sumahattEjastacchaikyaM samagacchata .......11  
  
When the demon mahishasura conquered the swarga and the post of Indra, all the deities including Indra & Brahma approached shiva and viSNu for help. Having listened to them, both viSNu and shiva displayed anger.
Similarly, the deities who were present there, displayed anger there.
The "krOdha" that is produced from all the deities including indra, shiva, viSNu, brahma etc. got accumulated in front of them as "Agni" (jwAlA vyApta digantaraM) and later assumed a beautiful form of a lady which is none other than Goddess Durga as described below:  
  
atIva tEjasaH kUTaM jwalantamiva parvataM  
dadrushustE surAstatra jwAlAvyApta digantaraM  
  
atulaM tatra tattEjaH sarvadEvasharIrajaM  
EkasthaM tadabhUnnArI vyAptalOkatrayaM tviSA  
  
So, the nAma "krOdhasambhavAM" is very much apt and can be included in "lakshmi ashttOtara" without any inhibitions. However, "kshIrodasambhavAM" is also one of the pATabhEda.
