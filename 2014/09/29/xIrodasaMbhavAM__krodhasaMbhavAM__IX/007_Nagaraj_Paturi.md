Dear Sriram,



dEvi is indeed "krOdhasambhavAM" ie., One who is born from Anger



-- dEvi is indeed krOdhasambhavA.



So, the nAma "krOdhasambhavAM" is very much apt



-- So, the nAma "krOdhasambhavA" is very much apt





The pāṭha कामाक्षीं क्रोधसंभवां has कामाक्षीं along with क्रोधसंभवां.



So bringingdurgā in connection with thatpāṭha may not be wrong.



Otherwise, features ofdurgā do not match with those of lakṣmī.
