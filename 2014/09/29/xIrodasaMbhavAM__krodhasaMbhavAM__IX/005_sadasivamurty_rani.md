Chy. Usha!

Blessings and Best Wishes.

Many factors play their prominent role in determining accuracy or authenticity of Stotra sahitya.

1\. Traditional practice. 2. Available literature in print 3. The knowledge of the users 4. The source texts from which these stotras areextracted 5. The Pauranic episodes connected to coining these Names of the Gods and Goddesses and so on.

We have to take all these factors and many more into consideration before coming to any conclusions regarding the authenticity of a text.

  

For instance in the Lalitha Sahasra Namastotra there are several text
variations depending on Samaya and Kaula sampradayas. Both type of text variations are correct according to their respective sampradayas. For those who don't know much about the prevalent sampradayas either of the text variations may seem wrong.

IF we take the Jayamanagala Vyakhyana of Bhattanarayana and Saubhagya Bhaskara Vyakhyana of Bhaskara Raya - The Two commentaries over Sri Lailitha Sahasranama stotra we can see several striking differences there.

Similarly lacking the related episodic knowledge also sometimes cause wrong coining of names.

for instance there are two popular epithets of Sri Lalithamba in the Lalitha Sahasra nama stotra: In all the popularly available texts these two epithets are found with no variation.

मन्त्रिण्यंबाविरचितविषंगवधतोषिता

विशुक्रप्राणहरणवाराहीवीर्यनन्दिता

But these two epithets don't agree with their source episode in the Lalithopakhyana of Brahmanda Purana. As mentioned there:

Vishukra was the Minister of the Demon Bhandasura. Mantrini and Syamalamba is the Minister of Goddess Lalithamba.

Vishanga was the Commander in Chief of the Demon Bhandasura.

Varahi Mata is the Commander in Chief of Goddess Lalithamba.

In the war occurred between the Armies of Bhandasura and Lalithamba

Syamalamba or Mantrini killed Visukra and Varahi mata killed Vishanga.

From this view point if we read the above two epithets we can judge how incorrect those two are. The correct text should be like this according to the vast description of the slaughter of these two demons found in the Lalithopakhyana.

मन्त्रिण्यम्बाविरचितविशुक्रवधतोषिता

विषंगप्राणहरणवाराहीवीर्यनन्दिता

Even in the Ghorakhpur publication of Srilalitha Sahasranamastotra the same mistake occurs regarding these two epithets.

Regarding the authenticity (as attested by you) of Ghorakhpur editions I am silent as I have my own observations which out of my fear of space and time I cannot present here.

Regarding bringing out critical editions of the stotras through Ph.D programme it has its worth provided the researcher is confident to produce sufficient material (in both quality and quantity) to satisfy the expectations of the Commonly accepted standards of Ph.D Prgramme. PLEASE DON'T ASK AGAIN ABOUT WHAT ARE THE COMMONLY ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF Ph.D Programme.

For instance one woman candidate of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati got her Ph.D Degree under the guidance of Prof. K. Ramasuryanarana Garu for her work on "The Study of Alanakras in the Lalitha Sahasra Nama Stotram".

Through her writing she could convince the scholarly world to award her Ph.D. Degree.

So nothing is technically deniable to be subject for Ph.D Programme. All that depends on individuals' strength.

Blessings and Best Wishes
