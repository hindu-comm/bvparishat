Namaste,  
  
The one para-dEvata shines as lakSmi, saraswati & durga depending upon the functional aspects which can be seen in "lakshmi ashtOttara" itself. A few names from lakSmi ashtOttara are navadurgA, mahAkAli, brahmaviSNushivAtmikA etc.  
  
Also, in dEvi mAhAtmyaM (also called chaNDi saptasathi), the dEvata of madhyama charita that describes the mahishAsura vadha is "mahAlakSmi" which is "abhinna" from "durgA" vide vaikrutika rahasyaM:
