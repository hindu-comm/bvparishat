1. There is a book by Ekkirala Anantacharya  
called, "Vision of Aryan Glory" in which there is  
a chapter called 'Aryan idea of Yajna' . The book is  
nowadays, published and marketed by The World Teacher Trust,  
Muppidi colony, Vishakhapatnam. 2.  
We conducted on behalf of Veda vijnanavedika, Hyderabad,  
lectures on the effect of Yajna on environment. I gave one  
of those lectures. 3. Aryasamaj and  
Aryasamajis individually published books on effect of Yajna.  
One of them from Hyderabad wrote a dissertation on  
'cloud control through yajna. 4.
