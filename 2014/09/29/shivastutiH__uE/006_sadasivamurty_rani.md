Chy. Usha!

I have started my home work to split the stotra word wise. In the mean while I here is an attempt to split word wise the particular line you
underscored in your latest mail i.eमृड योडुपतिध्र जगत्त्रितयाकृतयंत्रण भक्तिविधानकृतां ॥6॥

  

मृडय - Be Gracious or Be Pleased or Be Delightful

Here the verbal rootमृड् has two forms 1.मृडति (6th class), 2. मृड्नाति (9th class) and both the verbs carry the same meaning. Here we have मृडय which doesn't fall in either of these two classes. The poet being a sage (Angiras) may expect this to be conjugated as a verb of 10 gana (Curadi gana). This is not my conclusion. This is just a possibility I am thinking of.

उडुपतिध्र - The Bearer of Moon on head (उडुपति: चन्द्र: उडुपतिं धरतीति उडुपतिध्र: - यथा - महीध्र:, कुध्र:)

I think in the following two phrases there is no problem.

जगत्त्रितयाकृतयन्त्रण ! भक्तिविधानकृताम्

I shall continue my exercise and after completing I shall join again.

Blessings,
