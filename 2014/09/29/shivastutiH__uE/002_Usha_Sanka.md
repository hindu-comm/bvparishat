Sir,

I am aware of it. But it was solely for home-purpose, self-reading. That's why, taking some liberty.

For publishing, I know it is wrong.

Hyphens are used to suggest that -this is whole word.

In Telugu copy, all samsata padas were wrongly separated; spaces used at wrong places..

So just wanted to make sure that punctuation is done correctly.
