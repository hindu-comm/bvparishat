In VaghulAbharaNa , it is Vaghula+AbharaNa. There are many Vaghulas in personal names. But whether Vaghul as in Narayanan Vaghul is related to this Vaghula or not is not clear.



Vaghula as in VaghulAbharaNa is AdaraNIya Subrahmanyamji suggested the Tamil tadbhava form of the Sanskrit Vakula only. Tamil dictionaries do not cover vaghula. They cover it as vakuLa. vaghula is found in the day to day colloquial pronunciation and modern written forms where colloquial, pronunciation-faithful writing prevails. 'gh' is the English spelling adjustment for an allophone of the phoneme represented by க் . The form of க் between two vowels in Tamil pronunciation appears close to gh but in fact is much lighter than घ .



Other example of the same type is naghulan. This is the Mahabharata character nakulan or the animal nakula only. Here again Tamil dictionaries cover nakula only and naghula. There is a movie called Naghulan too.
