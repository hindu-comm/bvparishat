Vedavyasa with the help of his four disciples classified the Vedas in the late Dwapara yuga. To my understanding the Vayu Mahapurana says that before the classification of the Vedas, all the Vedas and the Puranas were together was a composite called the Yajurveda. After the classification of the four Vedas, the puranas were given the status of Veda by calling it the fifth Veda.  
  
It was Vedavyasa, who composed the Mahabharata after the passing away of the Pandavas and obviously it was composed in the beginning of the Kali yuga. After writing the Mahabharata the sage Vedavyasa wrote the Bhagavata purana on the advice of Narada and this means the Bhagavata Purana was also written in the beginning of the Kali yuga and it cannot be a part of the Ashtadasha Mahapuranas.  
  
The Bhagavata purana which says "Krishnastu Bhagavan Swayam" is considered the highest of the Puranas. The other Bhagavata forming the part of the Ashtadasha Mahapuranas is obviously the Devi Bhagavata or the Mahabhagavata purana.
