Namaste  
  
This precisely is the contentious issue being debated. Should the thread issue here be inviting \< chiranjeevi vyasa> to intervene and resolve this issue of ours living in \< kali- yuga>?  
  
1) one : \< vedic times>.. What is that ?  
  
2) two ; which version of which veda? -- \<. According to vedic version he is ciranjivi (long-lived) -he is to live at least till the end of this kali-yuga and he is the person who will initiate satya-yuga of next cycle (refer to cyclictime discussion thread in this group) after this kali-yuga is at end. \>  
  
The borders of faith, logic, mystic do not coalesce properly here, unless one consciously overlooks it.  
  
I have no difficulty if this topic is placed in faith or mystic basket. Certainly not in science, history segments.
