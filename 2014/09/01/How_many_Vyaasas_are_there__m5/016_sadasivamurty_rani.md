Pranams to all scholars!

In the progressive discussion on the topic "How many Vyaasas are there?" if it is keenly observed nowhere the question of "Historic Documentation" was spoken of in the initial mail triggered in this string. For two reasons the citations from Vishnu Maha Purana and Devi Bhagavata Maha Purana were given by me. The first reason is the TITLE OF THE  STRING ITSELF i.e. How many Vyaasaas are there?

The second reason is the fifth question of the same initial mail of this string i.e. \<(5) Who is Veda VyAsa? The same as the first VyAsa?\> When the scholar who initiated is prepared to accept many VYAASAS giving some information from some authentic sources is not felt wrong by me. Moreover while saying\<The list of the Vedavyasas of the present Kalpa as found in the Sri Vishnu Mahapurana is as follows:.. \> I did not pass any comments of my own. Simply I have given the texts from both the Maha Puranas (Vishnu and Devi Bhagavata).

When the very question is about the number of VYASAS where does the question of complexity arises if the list of VYASAS is given?

In this context I have a few questions -

My next question is about the word HISTORIC. Can there be any specification of HISTORIC and NON HISTORIC DOCUMENTS as far as our INDIAN HISTORY is concerned? Can we distinguish between the HISTORIC PERSONALITIES and MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONALITIES?

Can there be any definite proof to accept VEDA VYASA as a HISTORIC PEROSONALITY? If there is no definite proof and if we have to conclude him as a part of Mythological sections how Vishnupurana and Devi Bhagavatha cannot be worthy sources to speak about him?

My curiosity is about two more things:

1. a ‘ linear time scale’ , 2. the basic premise of a ‘ history of a society ’  

First I I would like to ask about the second one "The History of Society". If our PURANAS cannot be accepted HISTORIC DOCUMENTS to speak about our ancient India which historians can help us to know about our Ancient Indian Society?

a) Are they Historiographers of Enlightenment School such as\_ James Mill, Robert Orme, Buchanan, Tyler and Dubois, Elphinstone, Grand Duff and Willima Erskine?

b) Or are they the Sympathetic historians like - Sir William Jones, Cunningham, Wilkinson, Munro, Malcolm and others?

c) Or are they the Evangelical Historiographers like Shore or Grant?

d) Or are they the Administrator Historiographers like Mark Wilks, Grant Duff, James Todd, Babington Macaulay, William Hunter, Co. GB Malleson?

e) Or are they the Rationalist Historians like - Rajendralal Mitra, RC Dutt, Ray Chaudri etc?

f\) Or are they Economist Historians like - Major D. Basu, RC Majumdar,
Cy Chintamani and Surendranath Banarjee?

g\) Or are they Marxist Historians like - Hiren Mukherjee, R. Plame Dutt, Kosambi and others or their latter influenced professors like Romilla Thaper, Dr. Bipin Chandra and others?

COULD WE GIVE ANY COMFORTABLE PLACE TO THE NATIONALIST HISTRIANS LIKE - Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Swami Vivekananda, VD Savarkar, Mrs. Annie Besant and others who tried to bring out volumes of Indian history with true National Spirit?

In this context I would like to quote a few lines from HISTORY- ITS THEORY and METHOD written by Prof. B. Sheik Ali, Former Vice Chancellor of Mangalore University who speaks about the Historic validity and content of PURANAS.

QUOTE:

"The scope of the Puranas, eighteen in number, is very wide indeed, almost a popular encyclopedia of ancient and medival Hinduism dealing with religious, philosophical, historical, personal, social and political matters. These books contain accounts of kings and Rishis, religious beliefs, worships, observances and philosophy, personal social and political ordinances about all kinds of miscellaneous matters. To make proepr use ofhtis rich material superficial knowledge of Sanskrit will not help. We need great proficiency. With their commentaries it may not be possible to understand their real meaning.

Even today Good many a thinker of past like Vyasa, Valmiki, Kalidasa, Panini, Kautiliya and others have not been fully rehabitated in history.....

do find in the literature of the past whether Ramayana or Mahabharata or Puranas or the Heroic Poem or the legends, plenty of material which is the hard core of History such as customs and manners, methods of warfare and art of government, trade and commerce, farming and agriculture, philosophy and religion, education and learning, genealogy of kings and rulers and all other essential aspects that form culture."

Now Indian needs NATIONALIST HISTORIANS and not the RATIONALIST HISTORIANS any more.

  

Now I would like to deal with thea ‘ linear time scale’ -

We never hesitate to tell our children and grand children that Valmiki and Vyasawere the contemporaries of Rama and Sri Krishna. We never hesitate to tell them that Rama belongs to Treta Yuga and Dvapara Yuga. Even at a very tender age at which they cannot understand about YUGAS we tell them these stories of RAMA and KRISHNA as happenings in the YUGAs specified above.

But here we prepare to give very tough fight in the forums like this arguing against the YUGA and KALPA concept.

All our day to day ritualistic activities are based not on Christian era but strictly followingVikrama Saka which according to our Indian Astronomers began in 58 BC and Salivahana Saka began in 72 AD.

But we are not able to accept KING VIKRAM. We speak about Chandra gupta Vikramaditya only. We doubt about the deeds of Salivahana.

We accept Yudhisthira Saka but not Yudhisthira.

In our everyday Sandhyavandana and Nitya pujas in the sankalpa we say -

अद्य ब्रह्मण: द्वितीयपरार्थे स्वेतवराहकल्पे वैवस्वतमन्वन्तरे कलियुगे प्रथमपादे....अस्मिन् वर्तमानव्यावहारिकचान्द्रमानेन ....संवत्सरे उत्तरायणे / दक्षिणायने...मासे ....पक्षे.......तिथौ....वासरे...नक्षत्रे...योगे....करणे...शुभतिथौ.....शोभने मुहूर्ते...  

Is this not Linear Time Scale?

While the western time scale consists of Seconds - Minutes - Hours - Days - Years and finally Era...

  

We have still larger units of time - Beginning with: Lipta we have in progressive order - Vighadiya- Ghadiya - Tithi and Vasara - paksha - Masa - Rtu - Ayana - Samvatsara - Yuga - Mahayuga (Caturyuga) - Mavantara - Kalpa (A Day of Brahma), Brahma's Year and Brahma's Purva parartha and Dvitiya Parartha...and all these time units are in our regular ritualistic use...still we feel delicacy to accept their validity...???????

Why this weakness? or Is this a kind of hypocricy? (Accepting this time scale in all our Samskaras and Nitya Karmas...we hesitate to accept them as a part of our historic legacy). When we cannot believe them can we stop using them in the marriages and other auspicious samskaras in our houses?

SO LET US THINK IN A WAY REQUIRED TO REBUILD OUR INDIAN HISTORY FROM OUR OWN SOURCES (Vedic, Puranic and Itihasa Sources). First let us refrain ourselves from using the word MYTHOLOGY referring to our ITIHASAS and PURANAS.

Warm regards to all.
