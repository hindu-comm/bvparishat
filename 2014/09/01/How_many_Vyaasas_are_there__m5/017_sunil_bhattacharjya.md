Namaste,  
  

You seem to be very sceptic about the ancient history abd the ancient Indian chronology but many like me are not. that is because the puranic chronology has been proved by astronomical observations. Dr. Narahari Achar has proved beyond doubt, using astronomical software and data from the canonical texts that the date of Lord Buddha and the date Kanishka are respectively in the 19th century and 13th century BCE. His papers are available in the Scribd. The same way he also showed that Adi Shankara lived in the 6th century BCE. Unfortunately, for this brilliant scholar, he had problem in finding out the correct date of the most important landmark in the ancient Indian History, that is, the date of the Mahabharata war and that is because he did not recognise that fact the Kali yuga started in February 3102 BCE. Brahmagupta had given long ago the traditional information that the Sakanta kala or the Shalivahana saka started in the 3179th year of the Kali era. The Mahabharata also says in the Vanaparva that the Kali would start soon (achiraat) and it did, when Lord Krishna passed way. The puranas say that on the very day Lord Krishna passed away, the Kali yuga started and that means that the Mahabharata war occurred 36 years before the start of the Kali yuga, that is towards the end of the 3139 BCE. Even the date of Ramayana is roughly known to be about 3500 years before the Date of the Mahabharata war and a definitive work on that should appear soon, as attempts have been going on that . So puranic persoanlities are not necessarily mythical. That is not to say that there were no exaggerations and one objective for that atiranjan could have been the manoranjan of the readers.
