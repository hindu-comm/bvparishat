Dear Sunilji,



If you have a reference to Dr. Narahari Achar's work on the date of Adi Sankara, I would appreciate it. I am not aware of it and I haven't found anything online that shows that he worked on it. I have found references to Dr. Achar's work on astronomical dating of the Mahabharata and Satapatha Brahmana and even one to the dateof Buddha, but not of Adi Sankara.



Please note that as far as I am concerned, this is only a request for a direct pointer to Dr Achar's work, not an invitation to debate the date of Adi Sankara once again.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
