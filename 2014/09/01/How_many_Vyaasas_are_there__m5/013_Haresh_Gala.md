Namaste,  
  

According to My understanding, Different Duties were given to different groups/Clans/Gotras.  
  

VED Vyas and its Down Generations all called themselves same Name( Like Surname Today ) for Many Group Activities They are all VYAS Grp of People.  

Since Duties are assigned for Keeping particular 'VED' and related Knowledge ( Written and Oral ) to these Grp VYAS all must have Added / Modified content in the name of VED Vyas and that tradition was continuous for many centuries.  
  

In Purans there is a Traditions of Writing history aftter Particular Period in Future Tense format and Earlier in Past Tense Format. This does not mean , History ( Content ) was not added as Time progressed.
This Methods and ways some text are written has created confusions in many minds and we have lost thinking how to Interpret them Correctly and in Unbiased Way.  
  

Hope we see both Mythology ( with Historic content ) and History in Right Way and Interpret things with Practical Realities of Life of Past as seen from many archaeological finds.
