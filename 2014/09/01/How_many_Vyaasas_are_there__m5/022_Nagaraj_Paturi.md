Coming back to the original question, what is interesting is that the idea of 'multiple Vyaasas' also has two perspectives.



1\. traditional Indian 2. modern western



Modern western idea of multiple Vyaasas is that different extant worksconsidered to be those ofVyasa are in fact written by different individuals in different historical moments sometimes several centuries apart.



Traditional Indian view of multiple Vyaasas can not be mixed with this. For example, it can not be said that one of the extant works is authored by one of the PuraaNa-listed Vyaasas and another by another PuraaNa-listed Vyaasas.
