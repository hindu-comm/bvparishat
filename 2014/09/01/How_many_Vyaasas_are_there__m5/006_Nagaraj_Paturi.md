AadaraNIya Sunilji's words are, as always, good samples of the traditional Indian way of looking at these issues. Dvapara Yuga, Kali Yuga etc. are all part of the 'Indian mythical'/' Indian mythological' cyclic time which is different from 'historical' linear time. 'mythical'/'mythological' and 'historical' are two different ways of looking at the past. Neither is more superior to or more'correct' than the other.



Levi Strauss, the epoch-making cultural anthropologist, in his book 'Myth and Reality' asks his readers to imagine what would be the reaction ofmyth-believing people, not exposed to what we call 'history', to the'historical' accounts of the past. He says such people, after hearing the 'historical' accounts of the past would say, "Oh! That is what your mythology says!" Mythology is the myth-believer's history and History is history-believer's mythology.



Belief in mythology as the 'real' accounts of the past and belief in the infallibility and inalterability of the myths is not peculiar to traditional Indian society. Plato was such a strong believer in mythology as the 'real' accounts of the past and belief in the infallibility and inalterability of the myths that he wanted to banish poets from his dream commonwealth because of their tendency to alter narrative details of myths in their poetic works. ( Kalidasa's S'akuntala story is an altered version of the S'akuntalopakhyana of Mahabharata. No one sought to banish such people in ancient or medieval India even in their dream proposals .)



Even religions which are often described as 'historical' or 'history-centered' are in fact anchored to myths for the validity of some of their central beliefs.



There is a huge amount of modern western scholarship dedicated to make sense of myths / mythology , particularly the mythical way of looking at the past in the disciplines of philosophy, psychology, cultural anthropology, religious studies, literary criticism etc. Prof. Mircea Eliade, the guru and paramaguru of many of the contemporary professors of religious studies focussed on the beauty of the Indian mythological concepts such as cyclic time and went on to show how most of the contemporary western, apparently non-religious theories too are modelled in the lines of the myths of linear time of those societies.



Coming to the present point of discussion, one Vedavyasa who classified vedas composing many other works such as Brahma Sutras, Mahapuranas andMahabharata is a mythological idea and different authors composing different books of that set is a historical idea. Neither of them is more correct than the other. Both are valid within their paradigms. To be aware that they belong to two different paradigms of understanding and not to mix the two paradigms of understanding with each other solves many of the issues of contemporary times.
