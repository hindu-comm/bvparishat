I think we must pick this thread from where Prof. Paturi left and focus on what Dr. Joshi asked.  
  

This is not a historical perspective but a view one can get from Puranic mythology.  

  

Bhagavata is a superior literary piece but doesn't make Vyasa a ciranjivi to support the view that he is the compiler of Vedas, Brahma Sutars and Puranas. He is said as 6th Krishna Avatara or 1/6 amsha of Krishnaas. Hence he is known as Krishna Dvaipayana. One can arrive at different conclusions given by different Puranas. According to some puranas Brahma, creator first created, Veda-s, Purana-s, dharmashastra-s and taught them to the sages and not the sages did not copose the puranas .This information is there in Bhagavata Purana.  

Relevant quotes can be given by searching the puranas.  
  
वेदो धातृमुखादभूदिममृषिर् व्यासो विभज्य स्वयं  
शिष्येभ्य: प्रददौ, पुराणनिवहान् वेदार्थसारानथ।  
चक्रे, तान् लभते स्म मे गुरु, रिमे ज्ञाता मयैषां द्विजाः!  
सर्गादीनि च लक्षणानि; सकलं ब्रह्माश्रयं वर्तते।।  

  

Now the historical question needs to be discussed

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
