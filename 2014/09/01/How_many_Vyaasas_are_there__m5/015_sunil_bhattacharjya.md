Can one portray a time line of ‘Vyasa’ ( or in this case Many Vyasas)
that can be reasonably visualized ?

Yes, This is important. But to my knowledge there is no systematic statement on this in the puranas or elsewhere. We only know that Badarayana Vyasa, who wrote the Brahmasutra, belonged to the fourth generation after Vedavyasa, who classified the Vedas, and that is according to the Sama Vidhana Brahmana, if my memory serves me right.  
  

However Manu permits descendents, direct or otherwise, to adopt the names of the persons of the former generation, There were 30 Janakas, starting with Janaka, who was the foster-father of Mother Sita. This may make it generally difficult to find out precisely which Vyasa wrote what. My personal feeling is that the date of the Vyasa, who wrote the commentary on the Yoga-sutra of Patanjali, might not have been before the 13th century BCE, again assuming that Patanjalai was a contemporary of Panini.
