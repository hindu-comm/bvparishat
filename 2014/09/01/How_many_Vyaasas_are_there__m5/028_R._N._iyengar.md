My dear Ajit,

  

Since as the moderator you wrote "Now the historical question needs to be discussed" I like to point out the following. Issues of faith and belief are beyond external analysis. but if some one claims his/her belief is historical, then others will have a say because it has to be their history also! Changing slightly what Dr.Nagaraj posted i see there are two groups: a) Saampradaayika b) Vaichaarika. The two are not independent nor against each other. (a) likes to brush under the rug historical sequencing of which event in the Puranas precedes or succeeds what. Overall historicty of Krishna does not mean all that is said about his 'times" in the various Puranas are sequentially consistent. Examples of such instances would definitely make group (b) to point out interpolations or late nature of the redaction of such texts. At best contents of parts of the Bhagavata and parts of MB may be by the same person; but certainly not the whole. Apart from its high literary style Bhagavata has not maintained the (hi)story line of MB in the same fashion. Balarama is said to have traveled to south India (Tirupati, Kancji, Srirangam, Kerala, Kanyakumari) before reaching Kurukshetra to witness the fight between Bhima and Duryodhana. In MB Balarama travels only for 42 days, where as in Bh he is said to travel for one year. I find this to be a-historical even though I am not a westerner, but a believing Vaishnava. There are many other suchcontradictoryepisodes in the various puranas. I for one feel that there was only one sage Vyaasa author of Jaya and one seed-Purana, out of which the 18 have evolved as the branches of a tree.

All this does not make the संप्रदाय to be branded asअवैचारिक . The intention seems to be different from narrating linear/cyclic history. Perhaps they wanted the readers to forget the time line andperceiveself, life, world, universe in a different way, where historical personalities are mere supports in a play.
