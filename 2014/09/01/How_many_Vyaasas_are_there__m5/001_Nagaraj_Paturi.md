There are two views with regard to this:



1\. Traditional Indian



2\. Modern-western



Even according to 1, Vyasa of Yogasutra bhashya is not considered to be the same as the Vedavyasa to whom all other works mentioned by you are attributed.



The wordvyāsa means classifier. Vēdavyāsa means classifier of vēdas.



Bhāgavata purāṇa is included among aśṭādaśa purāṇas.



According to traditional view, Vēdavyāsa is the author of all the aśṭādaśa purāṇas,Mahābhārataand Brahmasūtras.
