Hare Krishna.  
Dear Sirs,  
Here I would like to highlight one thing - the information of a  
person's being tri-kala-jna that is mentioned in many of Vedic  
Literatures. These puranas, Vedas, etc are been accepted as being  
written by rsis who are tri-kala-jnas (one who knows past, present and  
future). It may be an unacceptable phenomenon according our tiny  
brains to accept, but if one neutrally studies Vedas and puranas one  
will at least be able to conclude that it was a widely accepted  
concept in the Vedic times. Now for our empiric minds there is  
something to look at:  
Just read Srimad Bhagavatam, 12th Canto, Chapter 1,2. There the  
qualities of today's age are mentioned in minute details which proves  
to be correct. One who is expert in astrology knows that these vedic  
systems did have very detailed system to know future events in  
details. And vyasa-deva is known as Mahamuni, means the best of all  
the munis. He is also known as tri-kala-jna. So it is not surprising  
to find the mention of Bhagavata purana in other puranas like  
padma-purana (which is contented to be highly tempered) and Matsya  
Purana (the oldest one). The author knew that he is to write that  
also.  
Moreover, the age of knowledge cannot be determined only by knowing  
when it was penned down; this is very logical. Now there is another  
conception in Vedic literatures, that of this knowledge's being  
eternal. It is manifested to us in different proportions at different  
times by the medium of rsis like Vyasadeva. Thus Bhagavata Purana  
although, penned down later, did not came into existence at that time,  
it was already there. Bhagavad-gita 4.1-2 gives the pramana for its  
(this knowledge's) being of much older origin than at the time Krishna  
taught it to Arjuna.  
  
Now regarding Bhagavata Purana's origin and importance and this very  
topic under discussion, one of the very famous Gaudiya Vaisnava  
Scholar Acharya, Jiva Gosvami, has written one book called  
Tattva-sandarbha. It is in Sanskrit and discusses this issue with all  
logic, cause & effects, etc. It is attached with this email. I would  
request scholars to go through this text.  
  
Regarding a list of different Vyasas being mentioned: Vyasa is a rsi  
that is given responsibility to make the knowledge of Vedic literature  
inteligible to people of kali-yuga who are short memoried (SB 1.1.10).  
Thus he expands the extent of explanation just as more explanation is  
required to teach a topic 1st standard student compared to a 10th  
standard student. Also he needs to write the instructions as people in  
kaliyuga won't be able remember much; otherwise in other yugas a  
disciple used to remember whatever a teacher teaches just by once  
hearing it (sruti-dhara). Thus the Vedas are known as sruti.  
So for every kaliyuga there is one Vyasa and the list names of Vyasas  
are mentioned for different kaliyugas. Krishna-dvaipayana-vyasa is the  
name of Vyasa for this kaliyuga (current time) and he is the author of  
puranas etc. According to vedic version he is ciranjivi (long-lived) -  
he is to live at least till the end of this kali-yuga and he is the  
person who will initiate satya-yuga of next cycle (refer to cyclic  
time discussion thread in this group) after this kali-yuga is at end.  
Thus it is not amazing that vyasa can be author of different books  
composed with a very great time difference if we accept the statements  
of vedic literatures mentioning long life of vyasadeva. (Logically  
speaking "if it is not in my experience, it must not be true" doesn't  
seem to be a very sound logic).  
  
\[Note: I have reference for each statement and someone interested can  
ask for it.\]  
  
Thankyou,
