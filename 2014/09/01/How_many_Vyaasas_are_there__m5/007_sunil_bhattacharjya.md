If Levi Strauss talked about the Chaturyuga system as mythical he was obviously unaware of the astronomical aspect of the Chaturyuga.There is a precessional cycle, where relatively speaking the Pole-star makes a circle, the period of which varies from 22,000 to 26,000 years, the mid-value being 24,000 years. This 24,000 years cycle is equal to one ascending Chaturyuga of 12,000 years plus another descending cycle of the Chaturuga of 12,000 years. So generally speaking, there is nothing mythical labout the Chaturyuga cycles. Of course the Shastras say that king is the cause of the kaala and that can alter the yuga period at micro level. The Kali yuga according to the Vishnu purana and the Bhagavata Purana started on the day Lord Krishna passed away. The Mahabharata war took place at the fag-end of the Dwapara yuga as given in the Mahabharata also, in the following verse :  

Antare caiva samprapte kali dvaparayo radhut \|

Samanta pancake yuddham kuru pandava senayoh \|\|

Here “antare” means “between” and “iva Samprapte'” means “as if reached”. The verse therefore refers to the war just before the end of the Dwapara yuga and just before the beginning of the Kali yuga. Several scholars in the past has misunderstood this verse, which led them to think that the Mahabharata war took place in the Kali yuga, whereas the Mahabharata war actually took place towards the end of the Dwapara yuga, i.e., in the ending Sandhyamsha of the Dwapara yuga. Now even though the Kali yuga started in 3102 BCE, the kali could not exert its full force till Yudhishthira was on the Earth as Yudhishthira went for Swargarohan only after 25 years of the start of the Kali yuga, as the Puranic Kali-yuga-rajavrittanta tells us. It is also believed that the virtuous Parikshita also cinstrumental in keeping the Kali's power at bay till he was living , i.e., till the first 25 years of the Kali yuga.
