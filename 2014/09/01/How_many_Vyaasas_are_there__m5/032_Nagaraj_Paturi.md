May I clarify a few things here:



The word 'myth' has two kinds of usages. 1. In general English, there is a usage of the word in the sense of 'not a fact'. 2. In academic studies, the word is not used in that sense. Here, it is used in the sense of ' a narrative of the past as believed by a social group handed down to that group from very ancient times, considered sacred by that group, part of religion of that group usually narrating things such as creation of the universe, creation of several other entities according to that social group '.



In the academic sense, myth does not mean 'non-factual'. Myth too in this sense is factual only. But mythical factuality ('puraaNic factuality' to use an Indian term)is different from historical factuality.



To consider historical factuality as the only factuality and to use the word 'myth' in the sense of 'non-fact' in academic discourses is a symptom of academic immaturity.



Solet us not struggle to get 'historical' status for all our respected narratives of the pastbygetting trapped into the propaganda ofobsolete enlightenment age academics.



One Vēda Vyāsa composing all the extant works considered to be those of Vyāsa and the idea of multiple Vyāsas as listed in the Purāṇas are all facts only , but mythical ('purāṇic' ) facts.To prove them to be 'historical facts' is an unnecessary exercise. They beingmythical factsdoes not reduce their status as facts at all.
