Namaste,

Balarama is said to have traveled to south India (Tirupati, Kancji, Srirangam, Kerala, Kanyakumari) before reaching Kurukshetra to witness the fight between Bhima and Duryodhana. In MB Balarama travels only for 42 days, where as in Bh he is said to travel for one year. I find this to be a-historical even though I am not a westerner, but a believing Vaishnava.

It appears to me that Balarama made two pilgrimages. One regular pilgrimage, which was well-planned and that took one year, when he covered the length of the country from the North to the South and back. The second was made in haste when Balarama found the war to be inevitable and he did not want to participate or nor to watch the war between his relatives. At that time he just went to the Prabhas kshetra and returned in 42 days, halting at a good number of place on the bank of Saraswati , the river of many holy saras.
