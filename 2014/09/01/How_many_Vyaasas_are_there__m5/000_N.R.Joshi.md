Respected Scholars, Namaskat!



How many VyAsas were there?

(1) According to my understanding Krishna DvaipAyana VyAsa composed the original epic Mahabharata (Jaya).



(2) BAdarAyan VyAsa composed Uttara MimAmsA



(3 )The third VyAsa composed VyAsabhAs’ya on Yoga sUtras. In VyAsaBhAs’ya the Buddhist doctrine and customs have been very severely dealt with by the author. This VyAsa is then certainly different from the first two VyAsas.



(4) Which VyAsa composed BhAgavata PurANa ? Some scholars believe that Bhagavat Purana was composed in 11th century AD. If that is true then he is another Vyaasa.



(5) Who is Veda VyAsa? The same as the first VyAsa?



Please help me to clear my confusion. Thank. N. R. Joshi
