Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

I read the piece on the astronomical dating of Adi Sankara by Prof. Achar, quite sometime ago. As far as I remember it could be either in Dr.Kosla Vepa's mail or in one of the mails of Dr. Kalyanaraman. Can you kindly give me a little time for me retrieve that ?  
  

Regards,
