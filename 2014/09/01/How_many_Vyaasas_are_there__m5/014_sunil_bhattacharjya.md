In Padma purana, if my memory serves me right, Now you may ask me as to how the Padma purana, composed earlier than the Bhagavata purana can say about the Bhagavata purana, which was composed last. For that you will have to look at the Panchalakshana of the puranas, which permits the puranas to be updated.
