Namaste,



I need clarification regarding the kriti "shri gaNanAtham bhajAmyaham".
Here is the link :



<http://sahityam.net/wiki/Sri_Gananatham_Bhajamyaham>



The last charanam extolls gaNapati as "AnjanEya avatAram".



I couldn't understand how "gaNapati" is extolled as "AnjanEya avatara".
Going by the footnote clarification, it has been stated that the evidence to this has been taken from "sangraha ramayana".



I would like to know what exactly has been referred to in"sangraha ramayana" regarding the gaNapati as Anjaneya avatara. Doubts have also been expressed whether Saint Tyagaraja has ever composed this kriti.



Thanking you in advance.

sriram
