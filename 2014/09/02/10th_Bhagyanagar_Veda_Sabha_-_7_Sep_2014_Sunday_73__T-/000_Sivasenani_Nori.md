There would be seven rounds to cover the seven*kāṇḍa*s of the samhitā part of the Krishna Yajurveda and three rounds to cover the*Brāhmaṇa*, and one to cover the*Āraṇyaka*and*Upaniṣat*portions.

  

*Ghanapāṭhis*would recite the*ghanapāṭha*of the*panasas*in the samhita;*Kramapāṭhis*would recite the*kramapāṭha*. Scholars of other branches ofVeda, if present, would recite at the beginning or end of each round from the relevant portions of the particular branch.
