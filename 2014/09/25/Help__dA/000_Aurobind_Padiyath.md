Pranam,

Hari Om !!!  

As a child I was introduced to many shlokas to by-heart. Given below is one in my memory. I am sure it is part of some bigger one. I will be grateful if anyone can give the full version of it with the details of the author of it and where it is appearing in case it is a part of some major work.

  

""तव भक्त भृत्य परिचारक भृत्य भृत्यस्य भृत्येति मॉं स्मरलोकनाथः।""

  

Thanks in advance

Aurobind Padiyath
