Anyhow, I could not find any grammatically incorrectness if it makes any sense for you. But I in the second पाद, तव एव has विसन्धि is considered as a दोष, metrically. But it is also present in the same place एष एव. The meaning of त्वद्भृत्क- is doubtful. and the addition of one more भृत्यस्य in the same line, makes it redundant for the third पाद. Otherwise there is change or incorrectness in the other reading.
