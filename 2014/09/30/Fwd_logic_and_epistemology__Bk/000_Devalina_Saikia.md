Opportunity Again !!

  

April 2015

  

13  to  25

  

Foundation Course in Indian Logic and Epistemology (Tarkasangaraha)

  

at the Karnataka Sanskrit University, Bangalore.

  

After this Foundation Course, there will be 3-level course in Navya Nyaya Language and Methodology. This will be the last chance for those who could not attend the Foundation course before. Hereafter I shall not teach this course again. You will teach. Therefore, those who want to learn Navya Nyaya in contemporary idiom can start from the Foundation Course.

  

Also tell your friends who are interested.

Best wishes,

VNJha
