Just Google for information on "dhanurved" which is a general subject,  
but also it will come up with English publications and also possible  
e-copies in public domains. \]  
  
If any particular text you want, you may give the details of the text,  
and bibliographical details, publication date, place etc. Flat request  
I want "dhanurved e-text" doesn't mean anything than you suppose  
something published and it is available in e-copy with someone.  
  
Here is one of such pages, in English I got from Googling:  
  
<http://www.atarn.org/india/dhanurveda_eng.htm>  
  
and there will be many publications also on any topic. And also many  
works in manuscripts themselves, information of which may be available  
in Catalogue of Manuscripts, like  
Aufrecht Catalogus Catalogorum (2014 edition) available for search online:  
  
<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/ACCScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php>  
  
and New Catalogus Catalogorum, which is in print and available for  
Sale in the New Catalogus Department at Madras. For updated  
information you may contact the Department. Already published Vol.IX  
should contain the letter ध and look for the entry धनुर्वेद. You may  
find the titles of works published under the name if published and if  
not the details about the manuscripts through Catalogues in different  
Libraries.
