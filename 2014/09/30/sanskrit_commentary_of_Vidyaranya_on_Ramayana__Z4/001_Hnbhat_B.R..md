I you want to know how many Commentaries on Valmiki Ramayana, please  
read "The History of Classical Sanskrit Literature" by M  
Krishnamachariar, revised Edn. published in 1985, if not a second  
revision thereafter. from p.22 the section : COMMENTARIES, onwards  
with details of the writers and more information. Or you can check the  
updated New Catalogous Catalogrum, with the Supplement, on Ramayana  
where you can find updated details of the commentaries on Ramayana in  
manuscripts. Older Catalogue of Aufrecht Catalogus Catalogorum (2014  
edition) you can search in this link:  
  
<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/ACCScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php>  
  
Popular ones are published online in this link:  
  
<http://valmiki.iitk.ac.in/index.php?id=introduction>  
  
Hope you can find the information you asked in the above sources.
