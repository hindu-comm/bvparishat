It will be nice if one can find out which word was actually used by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, as he is said to have mastered the Sanskrit Grammar so thoroughly that he had even challenged the great scholar of his time, Vishvavijayi Keshava Kashmiri Bhattacharya to a debate on Sanskrit grammar. It is said that the debate could not take place as Mother Saraswati herself intervened. Later on Kesdhav Kashmiri Bhattacharya initiated Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to the Dvadashakshari mahamantra.
