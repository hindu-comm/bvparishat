Yes sir, I missed the visarga. The correct reading is "कीर्तनीय:".  
  
This is a famous verse amongst Gaudiya Vaisnavas and is a part of  
eight verses given by Lord Chaitanya (famous as ShikShAShTaka).  
English meaning of this verse is as follows (if 2nd reading is taken):  
  
"One who thinks himself lower than the grass, who is more tolerant  
than a tree, and who does not expect personal honor yet is always  
prepared to give all respect to others can very easily always chant  
the holy name of the Lord."  
  
So if visarga is added to "kIrtanIya" then both versions can be correct?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
