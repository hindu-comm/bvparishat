That makes it more difficult. तरोः is the genitive singular, which could be translated as tree's - the phrase तरोरिव सहिष्णुना will then have to be translated as "by one, like a tree's, capable of bearing a burden" which is not correct (here tree should not be thought of as a burden, that would make it an asamartha samaasa; rather it is the burden-bearing quality of the tree that is intended to be spoken of). So we have to resort to something called प्रथमार्थे षष्ठी - the genitive used in the sense of the nominative. This is seen, very rarely though, in books of grammar itself - for instance in the गणसूत्रम् ग्लास्नावनुवमां च wherein (according to Balamanorama under 2353 व्यथो लिटि 7.4.68) षष्ठी is used in the sense of प्रथमा.

  

In comparison तरोरपि is more forecful, more symmetrical and more grammatically straight forward.
