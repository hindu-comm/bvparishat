taroḥ is the form in both the ablative singular and genitive singular of taru. Ablative singular makes sense here. See below.

Or, "from/compared to a tree" if the ablative is taken.

?? I don't get the translation? Are you taking the genitive by2-3-50 षष्ठी शेषे? Why not take the genitive by PS 2-3-65 कर्तृकर्मणोः कृति since the wordसहिष्णु has the इष्णुच् suffix ordained by PS 3-2-136 अलङ्कृञ्निराकृञ्प्रजनौत्पचौत्पतौन्मदरुच्यपत्रपवृतुवृधुसहचर इष्णुच्, and इष्णुच् is aकृत् suffix by PS 3-1-93 कृदतिङ्. So maybe a better translation with the genetive is "as it were by one who forbears a tree".

Anyway you are right that the genitive may not make sense in this verse. But with the ablative, it can be translated as "as it were by one who is \[more\] forbearing than a tree". Which makes sense.

AsamarthaSamāsa?? Where is theSamāsa here for the question of Sāmarthya to even arise?
