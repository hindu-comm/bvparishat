हरये नमः।  

  

In the first version of the verse, in the second paada, is the reading तरुरिव or तरोरिव ?

  

The second version with तरोरपि would add to the force of the verse, apart from being more symmetrical in sense (Hari ought to be praised by lower than the lowest species of plants and the one higher (i.e., with more ability to withstand burdens) than the highest of the species).
