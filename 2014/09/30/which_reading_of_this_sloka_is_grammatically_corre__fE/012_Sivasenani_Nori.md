Sri Misra

  

I indeed interpreted with शेषषष्ठी because the sense of "one who bears a tree" (which results from interpretation based on कर्तृकर्मणोः कृति) is not really apt in the context, as you yourself pointed out. (There are much bigger burdens to bear than a tree). This is what I tried to indicate in the explanation but the word "like" is missing - ... that would make it like an asamartha samaasa ...

  

The problem with using the ablative is that the particle इव would become nirarthaka. Of course, one could then invoke the principle निपातानामनेकार्थत्वम् and propose something like अप्यर्थे इवशब्दः but the less these principles are invoked, the better it is.

  

Hence the conclusion that the former version was "less straight-forward".

N. Siva Senani
