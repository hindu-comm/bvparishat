Google search shows that both readings are found in published sources from reliable and reputed authors/publishers.

  

Hazari Prasad Dwivedi quotes the reading with तरोरपि

A 1976 edition of Kalyāṇa (by Gita Press) has the तरोरिव reading

Gramatically both make sense with a slight change in meaning.
