Okay.  
  
So here I have either इव or अपि after तरोर् \| So here also meaning  
should differ slightly as तरोरपि means "more than a tree" and तरोरिव  
should mean "like a tree" - if I am not mistaken. But both reading are  
grammatically correct and meaning may be slightly different although  
making sense in both readings.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
