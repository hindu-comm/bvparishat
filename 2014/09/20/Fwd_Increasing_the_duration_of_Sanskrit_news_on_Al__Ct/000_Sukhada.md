Dear all,

Greetings for the oncoming festive season!

"For the love of Sanskrit"

Petition: Increase the quantum of Sanskrit news programmes on All India Radio and Doordarshan:  
  
<http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/longer-sanskrit-news-bulletins-on-air-and-dd-news.html>  



Please sign the petition for the love of Sanskrit, and also suggest it to your friends. Thanks

I am sure you are aware of the daily Sanskrit news bulletins of All India Radio (6.55 AM - 7 AM and 6.10 PM - 6.15 PM) and Doordarshan (DD News -6.55 AM), which have been broadcast daily for over 15 years on DD and for 40 years on AIR.

These news bulletins have grown in popularity over the years, and AIR even makes available the audio files and transcripts of the news on their website: <http://newsonair.nic.in/NSD-Audio-Bulletins-News-Schedule.asp>  

These news bulletins have shown how Sanskrit can be used simply and sweetly in day to day situations... and are a great source for learners and practitioners of Sanskrit.

I have been listening to the morning AIR Sanskrit news bulletin almost daily for over 35 years.

A petition is being proposed to be made to the authorities to increase the quantum of Sanskrit news programmes on AIR and DD to reflect their growing importance and relevance.

The petition is here:
