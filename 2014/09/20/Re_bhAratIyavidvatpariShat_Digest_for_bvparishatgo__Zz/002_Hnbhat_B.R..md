Dear Sir,

  

Please see this topic in our group for the source and discussion of the saying:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/hZqpk6y2ROg/M3yLwiMMJjYJ>  

  

where the quotation is traced to चित्सुखी, and Prof. Korada has discussed the meaning of it from all other sources and the implications of the maxim.
