Thanks for the information. Time of Panini is around 500 BC. Shakas entered the subcontinent around 150 BC.. That was the reason for asking question. Knowledge of Yavanas in the area around Peshavara (Panini was from that region) is quite possible in 500 BC. Thanks again. NRJoshi.

"yavana" is mentioned in this sUtra:



४.०१.०४९ इन्द्र-वरुण-भव-शर्व-रुद्र-मृड-हिम=अरण्य-यव-**यवन**-मातुल-आचार्या-णाम् आनुक्

4.01.049 indra-varuṇa-bhava-śarva-rudra-mṛḍa-hima=araṇya-yava-yavana-mātula-ācāryā-ṇām ānuk





which refers to the script of "yavana"(-s) according to the Vartika:



"यवनाल्लिप्याम्" as यवनानी in the feminine gender.









The reference you have given is not compatible, if It refers to the Adhyaya, Pada and Sutra in order of Ashtadhyayi as there are only 38 numbers in the referenced a पाद as the last सूत्र is कडाराः कर्मधारये \|\| PS_२,२।३८ \|\|. The word शक appears in the सूत्र as



शक-धृष-ज्ञा-ग्ला-घट-रभ-लभ-क्रम-सह-अर्ह-अस्त्य्-अर्थेषु तुमुन् \|\| PS_३,४।६५ \|\|



but it refers to the verb शक and not to any proper name. The same with this also:



सनि मी-मा-घु-रभ-लभ-**शक**-पत-पदाम् अच इस् \|\| PS_७,४।५४ \|\|



refers to the same verb.



As such I could not find the word शक by name in अष्टाध्यायी. I don't know whether he has used any other words to denote these two people. The first occurrence of यवन is to derive the feminine gender from the word in the meaning of the script as यवनानी. Other wise it would be यवनी whatever is meant by the word.
