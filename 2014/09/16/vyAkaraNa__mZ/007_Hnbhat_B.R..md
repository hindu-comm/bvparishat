I don't think the concept of व्यवस्थितविभाषा is itself is a परिभाषा, but Nagesha's परिभाषा is the guide to the concept. And hence, whether
व्यवस्थितविभाषा does not open a discussion whether it is a Paribhasha or not. In the strictest sense, अनियमे नियमकारिणी परिभाषा. While the "नवेति विभाषा" proides the optional application, of विभाषा providing optionally two forms to which विभाषा applied, this convention, is used in order to justify a single form in certain words, and some others the other form only and some others both the forms, even though the विभाषा could be applied as per the विभाषा सूत्र-s. This depends on the usages where the विभाषा सूत्र-s are applicable. It is governed by the व्यवस्था, of the words as applicable to the individual cases. This is meant by Nagesha's Paribhasha. "This means in order to justify certify certain forms, covered by विभाषा, they are restrictedly used in certain cases." which otherwise allow only both optional cases wherever the विभाषा function governed by the relevant सूत्र-s is applicable.

  

The word परिभाषा may have several meanings according to the context, and recorded in the Dictionaries, General and Technical. The meaning of व्यवस्थितविभाषा itself conveys the idea of a restricted usage of विभाषा as the same is explained as the restriction व्यवस्था is governed by the usage of the words in question, which evade the विभाषा-सूत्र-s.

  

The catagorization of विभाषा is made in another way depending on the function made option by the relevant सूत्र-s, as प्राप्तविभाषा, अप्राप्तविभाषा, प्राप्ताप्राप्तविभाषा, and व्यवस्थितविभाषा is just another convention, to restrict the option in certain cases. This is different in nature, from the other three, which are used to identify the function it makes optional.
