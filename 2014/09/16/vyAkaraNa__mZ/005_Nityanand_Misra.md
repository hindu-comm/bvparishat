Dr. Paturi, how is vyavasthitavibhāṣā a paribhāṣā?  
  
A Paninian rule which offers an option is vibhāṣā (e.g. PāSū 6.1.30 **vibhāṣā śveḥ**).  
A Paninian rule which helps interpretation of other Paninian rules is a paribhāṣā (e.g. PāSū 1.1.3 **iko guṇavṛddhī**). In addition, maxims or conventions which help in understanding or application of Paninian rules are paribhāṣās (e.g. PaŚe 93.4 **anudāttettvalakṣaṇamātmanepadamanityam**).  
  
Hence by definition a vibhāṣā is not a paribhāṣā. By implication a vyavasthitavibhāṣā is also not a paribhāṣā.  
  
The statement **vyavasthitavibhāṣayāpi kāryāṇi kriyante** is indeed a paribhāṣā, but it is not a vibhāṣā, and hence not a vyavasthitavibhāṣā either.
