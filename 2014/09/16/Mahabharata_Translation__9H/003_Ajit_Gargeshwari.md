Please search DLI or archives. You will get Mahabharata with verse by verse translation in to English. What Usa ji, was asking for a word to word translation with vigraha prose order etc which I think none exists for Mahabharata as seen in the web site she included in her post

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
