Namaste

Has there been an attempt to translate **Vyasa's Mahabharata** -

(*not just bare meaning/translation, but with anvaya and word to word meaning for shlokas*)  

1\. either as a whole

2\. or any parts of it- some part of main story or the upAkhyAnas individually-

3\. into English or any other Indian languages

4\. in the net (any web site or e-books) or in real-books, (I mean hard copies)

  

-something similar to this one-  

<http://valmikiramayan.net/>??  

  

I am aware of one PC Roy's and another MN Dutt's - but it is as a whole- only English translation.

Then I saw Vidura NIti word-to-word translations (as a part of college syllabi) and Yaksha prashnas in internet.

Please excuse me if this question is already asked before- and help me with link of that discussion.

Thankyou very much in advance.
