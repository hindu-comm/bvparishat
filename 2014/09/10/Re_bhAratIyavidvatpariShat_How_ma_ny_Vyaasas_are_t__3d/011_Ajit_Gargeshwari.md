Brahma Sutras are called Vedanta Sutras as they deal with vedanta which are placed end of vedas. Brahma Sutras are sometimes termed as Uttara Mimasa sutras and not all the Upanishads. Brahma Sutras expound the philosophical doctrine of Brahman and not all the views of Upanishads. Upanishads are used as one of the pramanas in Brahma Sutras. There may be a gradual transition of thought from Mantras to upanishadical thoughts as modern scholars say.  

  

I think we need to make a new thread as this not related to how many Vyasa are there
