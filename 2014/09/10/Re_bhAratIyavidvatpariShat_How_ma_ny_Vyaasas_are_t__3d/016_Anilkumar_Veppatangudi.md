**Shri N.R.Joshiji,**

**Honestly I do not know which Vyasa wrote Brahma Sutras or that there are many Vyasas. P.V.Kane( History of Dharma Shastras) places Vedas to Upanishads between 4000 BC to 1000 BC. He dates Manu Smriti between 200 BC to 200 AD. If Brahma Sutras refer to Smritis as a scholar has mentioned then Brahma Sutras should be later than 200 AD. All this is strictly based on data in books and certainly not based on any historical research.**

**Regards,**
