Your "Uttar Mimamsaa" and "Brahmasootras" would refer to the same text. You probably mean "Mahaabhaarata" where you have typed"Brahmasootras".

  

There are good reasons for distinguishing the Brahma-suutra author (Baadaraaya.na orBaadaraaya.na-vyaasa) from the Mahaabhaarata author (K.r.s.na-dvaipaayana orK.r.s.na-dvaipaayana-vyaasa). For want of time, I cannot dig up the scholarly literature giving direct or indirect evidence for this. At present, you will just have to take my word for the fact that such literature exists.

  

I have to be given the source, the original Sanskrit text, for the statement "Badarayan Vyaasa was the fourth generation (within 100 years) of Dvaipayan Vyaasa" before I can evaluate its historicity even in a preliminary way.

  

In the Vyaasa or Veda-vyaasa lists so far produced on thisforum (another one is said to exist in the Yoga-vaasi.s.tha), there are certainly some historical elements. Each will have to be determined carefully. A critical edition of the lists should be the first step (something similar to what Pargiter did with the Puraa.na lists of rulers).

  

The lack of symmetry or absence of artificiality in the coining of the names of individual Vyaasas indicates possibility of historicity.Secondly, the very fact thatVyaasa or Veda-vyaasa is used in the plural indicates that the tradition had anticipated what some modern scholars have said through such words as "Vyaasa had become a cultural institution". Some links and bits of information could have naturally been lost or become corrupted over in a long tradition. Our emphasis should not be on the deficiencies but on recovering what we can. Nor should we fail to distinguish between the certain, the probable and the possible within what we become inclined to consider historical. Over-confident and simplistic claims have done much harm to historical understanding all over the world but particularly in India.
