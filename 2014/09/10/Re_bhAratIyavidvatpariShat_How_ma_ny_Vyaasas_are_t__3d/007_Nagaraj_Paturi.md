My sentence was :



There is no book called Uttara Mimamsa. There is a book called Brahma Sutras. The Shaastra/Dars'ana to which it provides sutras is called Uttara Mimamsa.



Your response was:



Thanks for your input Prof N. Paturi. I have difficulty in understanding the sentence, Could you kindly add some more explanations please. Thanks.



Some more explanations:



If there is a sentence, " The book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematicalaid the foundations of Classical Mechanics " , in this sentence, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica is the name of the book and Classical Mechanicsis the name of the science/discipline dealt in that book.



My sentence 'There is a book called Brahma Sutras. The Shaastra/Dars'ana to which it provides sutras is called Uttara Mimamsa.' was something like



There is a book called Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica. The science /discipline to which it laid the foundations is called

Classical Mechanics.



Vyaasa's book 'Brahma Sootras ' is to the aastika dars'ana calledVedanta/ Uttara Meemaamsaa what Jaimini's bookPoorva Meemaamaasaa sootras is to the aastika dars'ana calledPoorva meemaamsaa.

Bhartrihari's Vaakyapadeeyam tells us that PaaNini's AshTaadhyaayi is the Sootra Grantha for the VyaakaraNa Dars'ana /VaiyaakaraNa Dars'ana/ PaaNineeya Dars'ana/ SphOTa Dars'ana. He also tells us that the very purpose of Vaakyapadeeyam is to preserve the VyaakaraNa Dars'ana /VaiyaakaraNa Dars'ana/ PaaNineeya Dars'ana/ SphOTa Dars'ana that was originally preserved in Sangraha, after Sangraha became extinct it was preserved in MahaabhaaShya and then was secured from s'ushka tarka and comprehensively consolidated in Vaakyapadeeyam. So according to Vaakyapadeeyam ,
