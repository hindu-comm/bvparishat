**I do not know how appropriate it is to classify Brahma Sutras as Vedanta. Each Veda is supposed to have four sections- Mantra Samhita, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads. A gradual transition from Prayers, Rituals, Contemplation and Philosophical thoughts. Vyasa is supposed to have written BrahmaSutras distilling the essence of Vedas. Brahma Sutras, Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads are the Prasthana Traya. It may be more appropriate to classify Upanishads as Uttara Mimamsa and Vedant. I would like to be educated.**
