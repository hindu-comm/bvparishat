Dear Dr. Joshi,  
  

It means there is no book called Pūrva Mīmāṃsā but there is a book called Brahma sūtras beginning with Athato Brahma jijnasa. The division of Mīmāṃsā is based notion of a dichotomy of the Vedic texts into a Karmakanda and Gyana Kanda*. *Because Uttara Mīmāṃsā is Vedanta, the term Mīmāṃsā generally denotes Pūrva Mīmāṃsā as per quoting a wiki
explanation and thats what Prof. Paturi said.
