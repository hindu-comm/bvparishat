Thanks Dr.V.N.anilkumar for your input.

You said," Vyasa is supposed to have written Brahma Sutras----" Could you be specific- Which Vyasa? There are many Vyaasas. People say or write without exactly telling us which Vyaasa composed what? That was the purpose of my asking the question: "How many Vyaasas are there?" in the beginning of this discussion. Thankis .N.R.Joshi
