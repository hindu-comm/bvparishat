Dear Dr. Joshi,



You said:



Aa I understand Badarayan Vyaasa is the author of Uttar Mimamsaa. And Krishna Dvaipayan Vyaasa is the composer of Brahmasootras.



Prof. Ashok Aklujkar said in response to this :



Your "Uttar Mimamsaa" and "Brahmasootras" would refer to the same text. You probably mean "Mahaabhaarata" where you have typed"Brahmasootras".

If Prof. Aklujkar is right, you meant "Mahaabhaarata" where you have typed"Brahmasootras", then it is a different matter.



I said the same as "Your "Uttar Mimamsaa" and "Brahmasootras" would refer to the same text "



If you really meant what you typed, then my clarification was required. If no, please ignore my clarification.
