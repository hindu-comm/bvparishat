Happy to see that Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam brought this significant issue for discussion. Also happy to see him mentioning Sphota in this discussion.



There are two debates connected to this issue:



1\. Prof. George Cardona , in his "Pāṇini : A Survey of Research", categorically says that Aṣṭādhyāyīis just a grammar of a specific language and to look for universals in it is not correct. He says this while dealing with the studies comparing Aṣṭādhyāyīwith the modern linguistic theories particularly with the Chomsky's TG grammar and his 'linguistic theory'. He mentions particularly Kiparsky and Staal here. Staal, Frits (1988). *Universals: studies in Indian logic and linguistics*. University of Chicago is a well known work.



2. Sphōṭa is treated as Bhartrihari's own theory by Prof. Cardona and many others and is not treated as 'in Pāṇini' (VP 2-481 to 2-488 not withstanding).



In my opinion , these two issues are mutually connected.



Vākyapadīyam is obviously a bookdealing withuniversals. In VP 2-481 to 2-488, Bhartrihari's claim is that the purpose of his book is to provide the theoretical foundations of Aṣṭādhyāyī gathered with the help of his Gurus from the Mahābhāṣyawhich preserved the foundations provided by Sangraha.



I argued on these lines , in myunpublished MPhil dissertation (1987, University of Hyderabad).I presented this in various scholarly platformsand the proposal was wellreceived by almost all the Indian scholars. The greatvaiyākaraṇa “Vyakarana Vageesha” Vidwan Peri Suryanarayana Shastri garuwho called sphōṭa as the pāṇinīya philosophy in hisTelugu book Sarvadars'ansangrahamu too fully agreed with me and encouraged me to pursue it further.
