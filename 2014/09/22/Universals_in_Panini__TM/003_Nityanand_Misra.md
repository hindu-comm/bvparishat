Thanks for sharing the presentation which is indeed very useful.



Couple of minor suggestions/corrections:



Slide 4

यत्तर्हि तदिङ्गितं चेष्टितं निमिषितम्, स शब्दः? नेत्याह, क्रिया नाम सा।

is translated as

“Is it that which performs actions like gesturing, blinking etc.? But that is an action.”

“That which performs actions” is the agent (कर्त्ता), not the action (क्रिया).

The translation of the question may exclude "which performs" and may be put as:

“Then that which is the gesture, the movement, the blinking – is this Śabda?”

Here is translation by S D Joshi and JAF Roodbergen (page 14, Paspasahnika, Univ of Poona 1986)

“Then this which we know as a gesture (or) a movement (or) the winking of the eye, is that the word?”



Slide 14

Example of sixth type अधिकार (Headings) is given as भूवादयः धातवः ॥१.३.१॥

From what I have read, भूवादयः धातवः ॥१.३.१॥ is a संज्ञासूत्र (definition) and not अधिकारसूत्र (Heading).
