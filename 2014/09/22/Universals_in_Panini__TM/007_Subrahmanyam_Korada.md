नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Sri Subramanian

  

I mentioned this (the verse is there in Samkarabhasyam on Taittiriya) while explaining बौद्धार्थ to Prof N R Joshi very recently.

  

Long ago some people told me that this is by Suresvaracarya in Vartikam . As we know he authored Vartikam on two Upanisats only. I stopped checking his works as soon as I came across the verse quoted by Acarya.

  

It may be Acarya borrowed the verse from a work that is not known to us today. Because if we follow Acarya's style (शैली) except in the beginning he does not compile a श्लोक ।

  

Anyway my search has been inconclusive.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
