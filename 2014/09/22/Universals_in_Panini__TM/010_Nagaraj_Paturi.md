One of the European professors whose name I would like to bring to the notice of the list, as one of those agreeing with the inseparability of Ashtaadhyaayee and vaakyapadeeyam and universals in Ashtaadhyaayee/vaakyapadeeyamis Prof. Peter Raster of Germany. He is highly articulate in English too.



I met him at EFLU , Hyderabad and organized his lecture on the concept of self-referral in Paniniyan theoryat our Vedavijnaana Vedika, Hyderabad. 



I found his homepage through web-search:
