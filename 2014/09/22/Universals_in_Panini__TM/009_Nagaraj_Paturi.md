The greatvaiyākaraṇa “Vyakarana Vageesha” Vidwan Peri Suryanarayana Shastri garu, in 1987,suggestedthat someone should apply the Paniniyan concepts to languages like English to prove their universal applicability.I recently found the following in the publications catalogue of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha:



**English Grammar from Paninian Perspective**

(Proceedings of National Symposium)

Chief Editor : Prof. Harekrishna Satapathy

Editors : Prof. S.Styanarayana Murthy ; Dr. R.J. Rama Sree ; Dr. Srivisa Varakhedi

2007; Size : Royal Octavo ; pp.233 ; **Rs.190/-**

This book contains the proceedings of the "National Symposium on English grammar in the light of Paninian perspective" organized by Rashtriya sanskrit vidyapeetha, held in November 2005. It is well known that Panini has written grammar for Sanskrit language. However, it is also believed by many scholars that the concepts used herein are universal and applicable across all languages. In order to show the universality of the Panini's grammar, it is necessary to extract the universal concepts from the core source and show their applicability in other languages. The universal concepts can be derived when we apply Paninian way of analysis to other modern languages. This fact has been established by many research activities through application of the Paninian concepts on Indian languages and their results. Therefore a new approach was thought. Aim of this approach is to explain some of the structural differences in English and Indian languages (with Hindi as starting ) from Paninian viewpoint. The present book comprises four sections - Theme papers, Response papers, Symposium addresses and a brief account of panel discussion on Interdisciplinary research program.
