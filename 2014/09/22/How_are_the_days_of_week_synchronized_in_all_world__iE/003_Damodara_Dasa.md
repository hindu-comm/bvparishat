Hare Krishna.  
Dear Sirs,  
  
Thankyou for your tries to reply.  
My main question is not exactly how are the days in a week named but  
how come the names of weekdays match in all cultures when there was no  
communication and the nomenclature systems are expected to be  
developed independently.  
  
Subrahmanyam Korada has thrown some light based on Greek Invasion  
theory how the similarity between german and Indian nomenclature  
systems can be explained. This may be one possible expanation although  
may need more research.  
  
I would like to know if someone has already done research in this  
field, tracing the origin of weekdays nomenclature (may be its system  
also), tracking its spread in to different civilizations in  
chronology, etc. Also study of first introduction of day names in each  
language literatures can be very helpful.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das.
