The names of days are given in the Chapter (Chapter No. 4) on "Varaprakaranam" in the "Atharvanajyotisham" (also called)Atmajyptisham). The word "Saptaha" is also mentioned in the Ashvalayana grihyasutra. All these go to show that the weekdays were named after the grahas long ago in India, much before it was done in any civilization. Moreover it is well known that Alexander ordered the texts on Mathematics and Astronomy to be converted from Persian to Greek. It is quite possible that he did that for the Indian texts also when he invaded western India.
