Namaskar,  
  

Names of Days are Derived from Hora  
  
The naming of the week days were done on the basis of moving horas only. For example if the sun hora is there at the time of sunrise, then the day is called as Sun's day – Sunday. If moon hora is there at the time of sunrise, the day is called as Mon day. Like this other week days have been named.
