I got a list of week days in different languages in a web page:

  

<http://www.omniglot.com/language/time/days.htm>

  

and you can start by studying the cultures and traditions the people speaking the languages, chave developed. Here is the tradition of the week days in trans cultures in Vikipedia:

  

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_days_of_the_week>

  

Only the common factor is all have only 7 days for a week , but only different names. You can check the list given if any have 6 or 8 or a different numbers. 

  

Just googled the topic you have picked up and landed in the above two pages. But there are many other result pages, which may be interesting for your purpose.

  

Wish a happy research.
