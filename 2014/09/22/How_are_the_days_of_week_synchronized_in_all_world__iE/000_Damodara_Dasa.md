Hare Krishna.  
Dear sirs,  
I was trying to study world traditions. I found one strange thing that  
in majority of them the days of week are snychronized considering the  
name of planet they are referring to.  
  
For Example:  
  
Sunday = Sun planet = ravi (Hindi) = ravivAra  
Monday = Moon Planet = soma (Hindi) = somavAra  
Tuesday = Mars Planet = mangala (Hindi) = mangalavAra  
wednesday = Mercury = budha (Hindi) = budhavAra  
Thursday = Jupiter = guru (Hindi) = guruvAra  
Friday = Venus = Sukra (Hindi) = SukravAra  
Saturday = Saturn = Sani (hindi) = SanivAra  
  
Similarly you will find in other languages that the name of the day  
they refer to planet and the same day is refering to the same planet  
in other language or tradition. For example if today is somavAra (day  
belonging to soma or moon) in hindi calendar, then today is monday in  
english calender (the day belonging to moon).  
  
Now as we know there was no medium of communication between these  
traditions and the system of nomenclature of days is expected to be  
independently developed. Then how the nomenclature is so synchronized  
in all these traditions? How scholars explain this?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
