Hi All  
  
Long time back I had an opportunity to visit French Institute Pondicherry. Although this institute has good number manuscript material on shaivagamas, it also has other manuscripts on updanishad, etc., One thing which pulled my interest was the text narayana hrudayam and laxmi hrudayam which is mentioned as it is taken from text called "Atharvana Rahasya". I have a book called hanumath stuti manjari written by sri Radhakrishna sastri. In this book also I do find a stotra called Saptamukha hanumath kavacham.  
  
At the staring of this sloka it is mentioned as "Ukhtam Atharvana Rahasye". Also in the most celebrated book called "Sri Tatva Nidhi" we could find many dhyana sloka taken from Sri Atharvana Rahasya.  
  
So here's my question  
  
1) Whether the text Atharvana rahasya exist?  
  
2) If at all it does exist is it preserved in any of the Oriental Institutes like "MORI" Mysore or "BORI" Pune.  
  
Scholars please throw some light on this.  
  
Thanks  
C.R.Bala
