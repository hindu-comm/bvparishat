Introduction  
Sanskrit, indeed, is one of the most exceptional languages of the world, perfect and highly potent in its linguistic expression. The alphabet of this language is flawless and comprehensive. Organized scientifically within the five distinct mouth positions, the sounds of Sanskrit are extraordinarily capable of creating the highest degree of resonance and clarity of articulation.  
  
This exhibition 'Varnamala' is organized to explore not just the wonders and splendours of Sanskrit Alphabet, but also to showcase the power of primal sounds which hold the key to the cosmic sound and reflect the prime power of creation.

  
  
The Main Focus of the Exhibition is threefold:  
• Phonetic Values of the Sounds of Sanskrit Alphabet  
• Inner significances of the Letters of the Sanskrit Alphabet  
• Practical Value of Learning Sanskrit Alphabet  
  
The exhibition is open to all, to spread the experience of the beauty and charm of an ancient Indian treasure.  
  

The exhibition will start with a Meditation at 9.30am on Monday, Sept. 22, 2014.
