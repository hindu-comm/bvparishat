Namaste

This is a question asked on behalf of a mother who wants Samskrt material for her kid.

Are there any picture-books -like with cartoons etc. having Samskrtam rhymes for very young children? Little kids below 5 years age?

There was once a post in BVP on this.. I could not locate it.

Please give me information on any children-literature available.. but apart from Samskrita Bharati.. because she is aware of that institution and has all material they have produced.

Be it online or off-line.. please let me have details.  

I had once seen टुप् कविताः "Tup kavitAH" of Jagannatha sir (ORI, Mysore, a member of BVP) in my library. It has good Samskrt rhyme-like songs.

But it has only text- no pictures. Even that will help for the mother.

Thankyou very much in advance.
