Are you referring to this post?

I have tried these books

<https://www.mlbd.com/BookDecription.aspx?id=17474>

They have pictures but I was not very happy with the quality of the text.



A post by our friend Marcis Gasuns talked about BookBox's videos rendering folk tales from the world in Sanskrit

There is also the translation of the Amar Chitra Katha Ramayana into Sanskrit - again quality of translation is not very good but sufficient for children who are beginning to learn.

You may try the CBSE books on Sanskrit. Some pictures, not many, but quality of text is quite good.



Sanskrit Chandamama - I do not know if it is still published, has some pictures.
