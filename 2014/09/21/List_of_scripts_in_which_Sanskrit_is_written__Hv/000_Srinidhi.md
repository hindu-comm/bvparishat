**Sanskrit**is written in various scripts over generations throughout South, South-east,Central and East Asia.There is script whose name is Sanskrit.  
Most of these scripts are descended from**Brahmi script**. Brahmi script was employed for Sanskrit and local Prakrit languages.

Its contemporary, Kharoshthi was used in Gandhara.Many scholars consider the Ashokaninscriptions recorded on rocks, stone pillars,excavated caves and stone slabs to be the earliestBrahmi records.

The spread of Buddhism and Hinduism to South-east, East andCentral Asia made Indian scripts and Sanskrit to develop inthese nations.

This made Sanskrit as an International language, was used extensively in official, religious records and Literature. Many of these scripts are now obsolete.

Hence, a revival isrequired on these vulnerable writing systems which in turn canpreserve Indianliterature and heritage.

  

Presently Sanskrit is written in all majorIndianscripts except Tamil and Gurmukhi in which this language is not natively written. But, since 19th century Devanagari has became a de facto and official script for Sanskrit language at national and international level.

But at regional level vernacular scripts are stillprevalent. Many of these scripts are used to write local languages,while some of them are used for Sanskrit only!

There is script whose name is Sanskrit.

Most of scripts are written from left to right similar to Devanagari and Latin. But , Sanskrit is also written from Right to Left in Kharoshthi script similar to Arabic. In Mongolian Galik version Sanskrit is written from Top to bottom.

All the script mentioned here are Brahmic( Indic scripts) . But Latin, Mongolian are one of the non-Brahmic scripts. Sanskrit is written in more than*40 scripts*. This makes Sanskrit , a language written inlargest number of scripts in the world!

  

*But there is no single place or website whichprovides entire list of scripts in which Sanskrit language is written. This is an attempt based on my knowledge andresearch.*
