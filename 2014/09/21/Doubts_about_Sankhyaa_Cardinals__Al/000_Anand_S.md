Respected Scholars,  

These are few doubts regarding the cardinals.  

1, Noticed that (Prakriya Bhashya P. 204) for the cardinals from panca to navadasa the numerals have no gender difference. Why is it that way? Till catvari there is gender difference.  
  

2, From ekonavimsatih, vimsatih etc. is in the form of mati sabda and they have declension in the form of singular, dual and plural. Why is that the previous ones do not have it that way and have only one form.  
  

3, Similar is with trimsat etc. which is in the form of marut sabdah  
  
Pranams
