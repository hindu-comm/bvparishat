That means they do not have any difference in form. up to दश, though they do not denote स्ंख्या alone up from एक up to दशन्.

  

"संख्याः संख्येये ह्यादश त्रिषु"

  

and the words up to अष्टादश are used to denote only the counted numbers and take the gender of the words they refer to.

विंशत्याद्याः सदैकत्वे सङ्ख्याः सङ्ख्येयसङ्क्ययोः।

सङ्ख्यार्थे द्विबहुत्वे स्तस्तासु चानवतेः स्त्रियः।" अमर २.९.८४

  

From the words like विंशति etc. are used to denote numbers twenty संख्या and the counted things. संख्येय. They are used in singular only when they denote संख्येय and when they are used to संख्या, they are used in duel and plural.

  

  

example: विंशतिर्गावः। as denoting the number counted संख्येय.

विंशतिर्ब्राह्मणाः, विंशतिः स्तियः, विंशतिः छत्राणि।

  

But the other wise, when denoting the number only, twenty, संख्या --

  

ब्राह्मणानां विंशतिः, द्वे विंशती, तिस्रो विंशतयः।

  

Note up to नवति, all numbers are used in feminine gender only.

  

but the numbers differ, when they denote संख्या only. but in feminine gender only.

  

After शतम्,

  

This is what Amarakosha has given as referring to the usage of the words denoting the numbers.

There is no change in form Already explained by विंशत्याद्याः सदैकत्वे applies here also. in gender and number.

  

And also from शतम् onwards, up to कोटि,

  

कोट्याः शताऽऽदिसंख्याऽन्या वा लक्षा नियुतं च तत्।  

  

they are used in neuter gender, both for संख्या and संख्येय, but take द्विवचन and बहुवचन, also like the above. Only the gender in the case of लक्ष it is used sometimes in feminine gender also. But the word कोटि is used in feminine gender.

  

पङ्क्ति-विंशति-त्रिंशच्-चत्वारिंशत्-पञ्चाशत्-षष्टि-सप्तत्य्-अशीति-नवति-शतम्># । । PS_५,१.५९ ।

  

in order, पङ्क्ति meaning ten onwards up to शतम् are listed in the above सूत्र.

  

For more details you can refer to the commentaries on Amara also.

  

\- पङ्क्तेः शतसहस्रादि क्रमाद्दशगुणोत्तरम्।
