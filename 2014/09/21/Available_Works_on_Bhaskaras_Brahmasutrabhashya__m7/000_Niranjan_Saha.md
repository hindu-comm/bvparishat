Dear list members,  
  

Namaskar!  
  

I'd be greatful if any body could point out me the available works on Bhaskara's Brahmasutrabhashya (I do have the original bhashya but need to know the availability of other works made on this bhashya either in Hindi, English or in any other Indian languages).  
  

Sincerely,  
  

Niranjan Saha
