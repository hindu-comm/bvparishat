This is very sad. Unlike many others Dr. Sankaranarayanan was keen on Vedic settlements mentioned in the grants. I noted in 1997 that his bringing to light 6th century Atharvavedic settlements in the Godavari deltas (The Viṣṇukuṇḍins etc; first noted by Fleet but elaborately commented upon by Sankaranarayanan) was helpful in determining the Atharvavedic migrational trail from Karnatak to Bengal, Orissa and Mithila via Andhra. Talking with him in 1997 was a pleasure. Sankaranarayanan was sober and worked without any attempt to come to the limelight. The loss will be felt.Kindly convey mt condolence to his family members.
