As I am looking for the complete postal address, phone number, etc. of the Manuscripts Library, Chennai, which has been featured in the above news item, I request members here in the know of this to please help me. On a search I could get only this much:  
  
Postal *address*: *Government Oriental Manuscripts Library* University of *Madras* Library *Chennai* 600005 India.
