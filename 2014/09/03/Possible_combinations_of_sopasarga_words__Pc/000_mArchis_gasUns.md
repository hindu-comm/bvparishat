Namaste,

  

How many different combinations of sopasarga words are there in Sanskrit? I used an .xls (Woerterbuch-Praefix_Stat_250k_101213_v8) macro on 250 000 Sanskrit (and a few non-Sanskrit that are in Sanskrit dictionaries) and it gave me 1974 results, many of which are false positives, some need correction, lesser part are correct. So the final number should be much lower. I need only unique cases, so some after correction will be no more of interest for the statistics.

If we have “praty” instead of “prati” in the file it’s not because there is such an upasarga. It’s because how .xls works and I manipulate it that way. So that should not be meant to have some deep meaning behind it.

The only book with examples I know is 5 volumes of Upasargartha Chandrika, all scanned, here is vol. 1. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/o84ao5xj0rzx8uj/Bharatiya-UpasargarthaChandrika-P1-1976.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o84ao5xj0rzx8uj/Bharatiya-UpasargarthaChandrika-P1-1976.pdf?dl=0) Full list at [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bxi5hp4nwxvc5xy/1974-upasarga.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bxi5hp4nwxvc5xy/1974-upasarga.txt?dl=0) Can you help me to clean the file?

  

Fine:

-   731 dur-ati 2 duratikrama

-   1327 sam-pra 285 sampradātā

-   1828 vi-ni 173 vinikarttavya

-   819 nir-ā 151 nirāka

  

To-be corrected:

-   25 abhi-pra-ṇī 2 abhipraṇī

-   1961 vy-ud-a 4 vyuda

-   908 ni-vī 4 nivīta

-   1669 ucch 123 ucchiṃhana

  

False:

-   1713 ul-apa 4 ulapa

-   512 ā-sv-a 4 āsva

-   1659 sv-a-sv-a 5 svasvakāla

-   1 a 11607 a

-   149 an 1766 anakṣ

-   1614 sv-a 1365 sva

-   235 an-ava 131 anavakara
