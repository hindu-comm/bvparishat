Namaste,

  

Thanks for your detailed as always answer. I'm working on a new edition of Palsule since 2006, as a proof I'm adding one layer of the work as a .pdf. Too bad I did not meet him when he was still alive in 2004. The work is almost done, still last proofreading is ahead and there is nobody to write the preface. A lot of mistakes have been corrected. So yes I know Palsule and when you say "I have not counted the number of Dhatu-s." I can say - I have, about 20 times, because I have found lost ones and deleted duplicates. aṃça on page 1 is 1, hvel on page 164 is 3690. After a year I'll know the final number. I'm compiling a concordance of roots, in which Palsule's concordance is only 1 column, so it takes time - something I should never have started.

21x3690=77490. But that is not what I want to know. I treat each combination of upasargas as unique. So the number is around 1000? times bigger than 77490. Here I need help, because of the combinations. That way I can check Carudeva Shastri as well afterwards - how many are realized in real language. I count vi, ni as unique, but vi-ni as a combination unique as well.

I have counted upasargas and pratyayas. Now I need help, to make the data closer to what the language actually is, otherwise the NLP tools add false positives that should have not be there.
