Theoreticlly there may be combinations of prefixes (upasarga-s 20 or 21) x the maximum number of धातु in various धातुपाठ-s by different writers. A concordance of Sanskrit Dhatupatha-s - G B Pasule gives a concordance of different roots given by different compilers of Dhatu lists.

  

I have not counted the number of Dhatu-s. Possibility of number of combination may vary between the actual usage (covered by the compilers of the dictionaries available) and theoretical possibility (20x21 x the total number of roots). A list of combination of used prefixes with roots (used) is given by CarudevaShastri, in his178971256-Upasargartha-Chandrika-Part1- 5 (Bharatiya-Vidya-prakashan-NewDelhi-1976) a practical guide on the use of the prefixes with difference of meaning from the cited usages from different sources. and the compound word formed with the prefixed verbs would amount to a large number than the roots (verbs) listed with their basic meanings.

  

Congratulations for your efforts.
