Sorry. I had posted this reply without seeing the reply by Prof. Ashok Aklujkar, who had already provided the source. Just my point to be added was only to change the topic, when the message do not relate to the topic in the thread, "How Many Vyasa-s." in which he had posted his requested. Hence a new thread for the topic with different subject line for the topic was started.

  

With regards
