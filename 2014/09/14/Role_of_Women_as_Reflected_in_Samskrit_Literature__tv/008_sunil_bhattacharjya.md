Namaste,  
  

I don't think Jayanthi Manoharji used any offensive languaage. It coud be somewhat frustrating to her that men are not trying to get involved in looking at the issues related to women. Man can participate and give proper feedback wherever necessary. Some years ago I found some ladies doing Manu-bashing, as if all the ills of the women are due to the Manu's so-called one-sided laws. I had to inform them that Manu framed the laws to suit the social conditions prevailing in the Satya yuga. There have been gradual changes introduced in the subsequent yugas and accordingly different Smritis are meant for the different yugas. Parashara smriti has been written specifically for the present yuga and many of the Manu's strictures have been modified to suit the present age.  
  

Regards,
