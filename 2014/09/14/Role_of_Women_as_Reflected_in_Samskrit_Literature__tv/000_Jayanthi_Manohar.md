Dear Scholars,  
  
All are welcome to the National Conference on “Role of Women as Reflected in Samskrit Literature” on 15th, 16th and 17th Sep 2014 at Aksharam, 8th Cross, Girinagar II phase, Bangalore – 560085. This is organized by Karnataka Samskrit University, Bengaluru.  
  
Many such conferences organized on women issues suffer from the absence of men participants in the podium as well as among audience. We hope to see them more in number in this conference. Please see the program list attached.
