Dear Shrivatsa  

Its a simple invitation to a conference as said in the invitation all are welcome. I donot understand the reasons for your concerns s. I don't think Jayanthi Manohar or the confernce organisers have has any such intentions as you are thinking and its good you decided to end this exchange.  
  

I donot understand why Jayant Monohar needs to include sentence such as " " Many such conferences organized on women issues suffer from the  
absence of men participants in the podium as well as among audience." for a conference invitation which is not the normal way of inviting and invite controversies which were not needed
