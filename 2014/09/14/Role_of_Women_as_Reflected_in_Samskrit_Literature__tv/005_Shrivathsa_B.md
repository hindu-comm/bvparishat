Inclusion of conference organizers in my response was because an impression was sought to be conveyed (that of men not attending "such" conferences due to reasons which were unfairly imputed on them).  

As far as my reason for writing what i wrote, i think i have expressed them sufficiently in my previous post (suffice to say that Ms. Manohar's mail was gratuitously offensive towards men. As this group consists of men of merit, i felt that the way the invitation was put was wrong, i am thankful that you saw this point).  
  

svasti.
