" Many such conferences organized on women issues suffer from the absence of men participants in the podium as well as among audience."

 I don't understand why this should be seen as "suffering". There is no reason why listeners of a certain sex will keep away from talks of this sort if they were really interesting. Or is this a warning to prospective male listeners?!

Without even providing the details of what will be presented, you want participation of men? And on top of it, accuse them of non participation? Don't you think it is too much to expect of us?

If what you say is true, it is something for the organizers of such conferences to introspect. Please spare us of unnecessary accusations.
