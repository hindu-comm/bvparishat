Some four years back, I presented a paper titled 'The Place women in Sanskrit literature' in a 3 day conference on 'Women Empowerment in Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi Literatures.' Since then, the paper was not edited. it is available at <http://www.scribd.com/doc/48898097/The-Place-of-Women-in-Sanskrit-Literature>. I believe, the grammatical mistakes can be ignored in this compilation of thoughts.  
  

Though, this conference was organized by a college, there was an equal number of male participants including senior professors and research scholars.
