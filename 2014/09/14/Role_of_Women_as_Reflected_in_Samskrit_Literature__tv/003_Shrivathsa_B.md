" My only concern is to have more number of interested people in the conference."  

 Seems like my mail was misread.  
1. Often, concerns are not reasons enough for accusations.  
2. Whenever I have seen a proper talk organized, the organizers take the pain to inform the prospective attendees about the contents of the talk. But then, here it seems that you want men to attend a conference merely because it is about women. (Thereby imputing meanness to them for not attending, one can grant you the fig leaf of informing us of the topics, nothing more).  

3\. None of the forum members are responsible for the low turnout of men in your previous conferences (may be that the tone of your talks was too sermonizing, may be they were downright boring, may be you didn't advertise the talks well enough for men to know of it, may be you advertized in the same accusatory tone in which you advertized it here. Why don't you and the conference organizers introspect on these lines? A film director seldom accuses the audience for his film having flopped!!!)  

3\. A request for men to attend would have been more appropriate rather than an accusation made in a sermonizing tone. This forum has many men who are of very high merit and I found the tone to be insulting to them. Nothing less.  
  

 I wish to end this exchange here if the idea has been conveyed clearly enough to you.
