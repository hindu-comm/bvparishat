Namaste

Very happy to have this information.

I had heard that Japanese have very good feeling for गङ्गा and they dream of taking bath atleast once in their life time. Just heard from someone who visited there.

  

Only if Indians residing in foreign lands let us have more a picture of what amount or extent or ways of Hindu संस्कृति the natives of foreign lands (non-Indians) follow. It will be a good study.. at least in countries around India.

  

This is not wanting to prove anything- but we feel happy to be connected in some way. And it will improve our knowledge about ourselves too. Sometimes we are unaware that some ritual found *there* was once here! So it will be a happy reunion.

May be BVP members who are NRIs can contribute in more of these aspects.. by sharing whatever they can observe, study and understand by virtue of their stay..

Thankyou so much.
