Worship of Vedic gods in Japan  
----------------------------------------------  
  
Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kyoto reminds me of our visit to that beautiful temple city. An invitation to present my paper in 14th World Sanskrit Conference in Kyoto, Japan gave me an opportunity to look at the history of Japan which tells us about the divine bond between the two countries.  
  
Toji Temple, visited by our P.M in Kyoto is known as Guardian Temple that has huge idols of Ashta Dikpalakas - Guardian deities along with Buddha. It was founded in 794 AD.  
  
1.Taishaku (East; Indra).  
2.Ka (SE; Agni)  
3.Emma (South; Yama)  
4 Rasatsu (SW; Nirruti- Rakshasa)  
5.Sui (West; Varuna).  
6.Fu (NW; Marut, Vayu)  
7 Bishamon (North; Kubera, Vaishravana).  
7.Ishana (NE; Ishana – Śiva).  
8 Gat (Moon- Candra)  
  
There are Temples dedicated to Indra in Shibamata area and Katasuhika ward of Tokyo. Philip Franz Von Siebold, a German scholar has listed 131 Shrines dedicated to Goddess Sarasvati and 100 to Lord Ganesha in Tokyo itself in 1832.  
  
We can see the idols of Shinto and Budhism along with Vedic deities placed in the same temple side by side. They co-exist along with Vedic thoughts, Rituals, Tantricism and Buddhism. The Japanese also perform "homa" known as "goma" to their deities even today.  
  
Worship of Hindu gods continues in Japan even now because It is commonly believed there, that the Hindu deities if worshipped properly; bestow material benefits and other favors in day to day life quickly. Many Hindu Gods which were integrated into Indian Buddhism travelled far and wide and reached Japan and have got an exalted position there. It is interesting to note that the Japanese retained the status of Indra from Vedic period and worshiped him as main deity bestowing powers to the Kings in their combat by many Emperors.
