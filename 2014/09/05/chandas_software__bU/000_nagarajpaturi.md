## Description

This program displays the long (guru) and short (laghu) vowels in Å›lokas in accordance with the rules of Sanskrit prosody.  
  
N. B. If you have verses in different codes (HK, ITRANS,,,) before using program convert them into "Balaram" code using online "diDrunch" tool.



I did not try it myself. I am going to try. Wanted to share so that someone may know to try it better.
