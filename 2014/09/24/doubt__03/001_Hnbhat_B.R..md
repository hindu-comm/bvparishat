Please read the above link for the function of "ca" in your sentence also. Morphologically you are right.

  

  

स्वरादिनिपातमव्ययम् (१-१-३७).  

  

  

All the निपात-s are अव्यय-s as per the above rule, and च is a निपात, under the contdition laid down in this rule, listed as the first member of the group चादि:

  

चादयोऽसत्त्वे , १।४।५७॥

It is named by Panini himself f

  

  

तिङ्स्त्रीणि त्रीणि प्रथममध्यमोत्तमाः (१।४।१०१)

  

and again himself classified as एक-द्वि-बहु-वचन

तान्येकवचन-द्वि-वचन-वहुवचनानेकशः । १।४ ॥ १०२॥  

  

The reason you asked has been answered by Panini:

  

युष्मद्य्-उपपदे समान-अधिकरणे स्थानिन्य् अपि मध्यमः ॥ पा.सू.१,४.१०५ ॥  

  

मध्यम-पुरुष suffixed are used along with the कर्तृ युष्मत् whether it is used or not, in एक-द्वि-बहु-वचन.

  

And also the same with the pronoun अस्मद् also. In other words, the above two मध्यम and उत्तम पुरुष suffixes are used with युष्मद् and अस्मद् only as the कर्तृ.

  

If you ask why he has said so, please learn grammar in the proper method. We follow the rules laid by Panini.

  

  

all the three पुरुषप्रत्यय-s are again divided into three.
