I think Hari Prasad Ji is looking for the Kaundinyaayana-siksha which is a very recent work by Sivaraaja Acaarya Kaundinyaayana after whom the text is termed 'Kaundinyaayanasikshaa'. In this work the author tried to compile all the tenets of Siksha-saastra. Most probably this work was a PhD thesis submitted to Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Varanasi. It is published from Chowkhamba Vidya Bhawan. However, I don't think it is available online.  

Regards,

Deepro.
