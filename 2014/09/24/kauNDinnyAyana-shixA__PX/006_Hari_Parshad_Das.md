Dear vidvaj-janas,  
  

pranams!  
  
My thanks to all of you for your kind replies. I was looking for the edition whose details were given by Sri Deepro Chakraborty. I am looking for the one by Shivaraj Kaundinnyāyana. It seems that this śikṣā is the most comprehensive one till date. But nonetheless, my thanks to all others too.  
  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari pārṣada dāsa.
