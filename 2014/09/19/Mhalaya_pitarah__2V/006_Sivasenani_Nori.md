Sir

  

Thank you for pointing out the same. Even if one did not have this specific verse in mind, one would have to necessarily arrive at the same position after a bit of thought. Though Stia is an ayonija, for all karmas, she has to be treated as the daughter of Janaka. Of the many kind of children mentioned in various sources, aurasa is only one of them - so, biological connection was never the only aspect in deciding parenthood in our tradition. Still, it is a sign of confusion in me that I cling to these notions.

  

I am thankful to BVP and scholars who responded - to this or other posts - for helping cleanse such acquired notions and making sure that one is alert in thinking and presenting.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
