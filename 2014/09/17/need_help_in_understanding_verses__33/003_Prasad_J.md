Thank you Misraji for your reply.  
  
I used Critical edition, published by ORI, Baroda.  
  
This is Viṣṇu Purāṇa 5.29.31. The context is, Kṛṣṇa has killed Narakāsura, and when he went inside Naraka's palace, he saw 16100 maidens. Commentaries do not give any input for this verse. As I don't know much Panini rules, your reply was very helpful to dig out more in this matter. I went through the karmavyatihāra section, and I feel, there might not be karmavyatihāra here. I also thought it as ārṣa, however, as you said, I thought to seek help from scholars before concluding that.  
There are more of such verses, having the form dadṛśe.  
E.g. 5.19.4:  
rāmakṛṣṇau ca dadṛśe yathāpurvaṁ rathe sthitau  
vismitākṣas tadākrūras taṁ ca kṛṣṇo ’bhyabhāṣata  
  
5.23.16:  
bahirāvāsite sainye mathurāyā nirāyudhaḥ  
nirjagāma sa govindo dadṛśe yavaneśvaram  
  
5.24.4:  
ityuktaḥ praṇipatyeśaṁ jagatām acyutaṁ nṛpaḥ  
guhāmukhād viniṣkrānto dadṛśe so 'lpakān narān  
  
This can give you more idea about this.  
  
  

Your reply for the second question was very helpful. Indeed it is sambandhavivakṣā. I just saw the Śrīdhara Svāmī's commentary, and he writes, atas tava prabhāvādikaṁ mayā kathaṁ stūyate stotuṁ śakyate.  

And I used present progressive, because the context is, Pṛthvī is glorifying Kṛṣṇa, and she continues doing that even after this verse. However, simple present tense would also work nicely.  

  
  

Thank you.
