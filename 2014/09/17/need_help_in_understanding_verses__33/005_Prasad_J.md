Thank you Misraji for your reply. I always look forward to the posts of few people, and in my gratitude, you are one of those.  
  
The example from Adhyātmarāmāyaṇa is very similar to stūyate tava kiṁ tadā. Also the explanation of vartamānasāmīpya in commentary is very interesting. Thank you for that. I was also thinking about a rule, which states that, śak dhātu can be used in connection with the words having 'tum' pratyaya, in regards to stotuṁ śakyate. I need to find a Pāṇini rule for this. An example for this would be paṭhituṁ śaknoti (or śakyate).  
  
Śrīdhara Svāmī doesn't say anything about dadṛśe. His commentary is available online, however in Bengali script: <https://archive.org/details/vishnupuranasvaprakash>  

Śrī Viṣṇu Citta's commentary is in Devanāgarī: <https://archive.org/details/Vishnu_Purana_with_Vishnuchittiyam_-_PB_Annangaracharya_1972>  

I am also in search of other online commentaries.  

  

Sometimes Vedic usage is seen in Purāṇas, so can dadṛśe be such a case?  
  

Thank you.  
  
  

Prasad J.
