Respected scholars,  

Namaste.  
  

Can dadṛśe form be used in kartari prayoga, as mentioned in the following verse? Monier-williams mentions it also as ātmanepadī dhātu, used in Vedas. Will this be applicable here?  
kanyāpure sa kanyānāṁ ṣoḍaśātulavikramaḥ  
śatādhikāni dadṛśe sahasrāṇi mahāmune  
  

Also please help me to understand meaning of the last lines of following verses.  
tvaṁ kartā ca vikartā ca saṁhartā prabhavo ’pyayaḥ  
jagatāṁ tvaṁ jagadrūpaḥ stūyate ’cyuta kiṁ tava  

  

vyāpī vyāpyaḥ kriyā kartā kāryaṁ ca bhagavān yadā  
sarvabhūtātmabhūtasya stūyate tava kiṁ tadā  

Does this mean, 'Acyuta, why do I glorify you?' or 'Acyuta, what can say to glorify you?'

  
paramātmā tvam ātmā ca bhūtātmā cāvyayo bhavān  
yadā tadā stutir nātha kim arthaṁ te pravartate  

Does this mean, 'For what reason your glorification is happening?'  

  

All the above verses are from Viṣṇu Purāṇa.  
  

Thank you.  
  

Prasad J.
