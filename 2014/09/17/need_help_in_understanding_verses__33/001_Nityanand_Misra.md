Could you please cite the verse numbers so that the context and/or commentaries can be seen. Citing the publication details also helps in case there are variant readings.

  

Caveat lector, the below answers do not take the context into account.

dadṛśe can result in kartari prayoga in the Paninian system by the rule PS 1.3.14 karttari karmavyatihāre. The context will have to be seen to see if a karmavyatihāra explanation fits here. Else one can go for a nāmadhātu derivation or assume another root using ākṛtigaṇatva of dhātupāṭha. I like to try for all possible derivations within or extensions of Paninian framework before saying that a form is Ārṣa or non-Paninian.

stūyate is karmaṇi third person prayoga or bhāve prayoga, so first person may be avoided in the translation.

tava can be explained by sambandhavivakṣā.

I would prefer "happens" to "is happening". Any reason to prefer the present progressive?

te is from PS 2.3.65 kartṛkarmaṇoḥ kṛti
