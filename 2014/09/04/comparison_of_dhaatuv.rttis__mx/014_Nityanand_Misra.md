By using the Asandigdha (unambiguous) property of Aṣṭādhyāyi + Dhātupāṭha, one is led to conclude that Pāṇini did not intend to apply **PS8-4-66 udāttādanudāttasya svaritaḥ** to the dhātupāṭha.

  

If he did, then udātta anudāttet roots like **DP1-2 edha vṛddhau** will become udātta svaritet in the dhātupāṭha.

If they did, there will be ambiguity regarding whether the roots were originally svaritet or anudāttet. This will lead to ambiguity in scope of rules like **PS1-3-12 anudāttaṅita ātmanepadam** and **PS1-3-72 svaritañitaḥ kartrabhiprāye kriyāphale**. This in turn will lead to ambiguity if such roots are ātmanepadī (edhate only) or ubhayapadī (edhati/edhatedepending on nature of kriyāphala), and the aniṣṭatva of forms like edhati will not be established. Similarly for roots like **DP1-997 hikka avyakte śabde** to **DP 1-1043 guhū saṁvaraṇe** which are udātta svaritet (**DPGSiti hikkādaya udāttāḥ svaritetaḥ**), there will be ambiguity if the roots are ātmanepadī (hikkateonly) or ubhayapadī (hikkati/hikkatedepending on nature of kriyāphala), and the iṣṭatva of forms likehikkatiwill not be established.

  

Objection: By **PS 8-2-1 purvatrāsiddham**, **PS 8-4-66 udāttādanudāttasya svaritaḥ** is assiddha with respect to both **PS 1-3-12 anudāttaṅita ātmanepadam** and **PS 1-3-72 svaritañitaḥ kartrabhiprāye kriyāphale**. This means for a root which was originally anudāttet but became svaritet due to **PS 8-4-66 udāttādanudāttasya svaritaḥ**, its svaritettva is asiddha with respect to PS 1-3-12 and PS 1-3-72 and it would still get ātmanepada affixes by **PS 1-3-12 anudāttaṅita ātmanepadam**.  

  

Response: Sādhūktam, but the ambiguity still stays. How do we know if that root was originally svaritet, or if it was originally anudāttet and later made svaritet by PS 8-4-66? The only way is to have both the original and final readings for such roots, the former before and latter after the operation of PS 8-4-66. No dhātupāṭha has two readings.  

  

Therefore, if the Aṣṭādhyāyi and the Dhātupāṭha are to be held as unambiguous, the conclusion that 8-4-66 does apply to dhātupāṭha.
