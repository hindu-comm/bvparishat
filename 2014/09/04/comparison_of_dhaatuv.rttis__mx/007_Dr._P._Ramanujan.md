Yes. Mechanically find & replace is possible.

However, the anudatta marking is not for the word, i.e, dhatu, but the 'it' only, as these dhatu-s are 'anudattet'.

By Panini sutra, 8.4.66, if dhatu is udatta and 'it' is anudatta, the 'it' portion has to be marked with svarita.

Only while analysing, i.e, sandhi splitting between dhatu and 'it', the latter would be anudatta.
