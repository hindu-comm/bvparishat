Namaste,

  

 Wonderful work.Why Comparison of Paninian Dhaatuvrttis? It's a Concordance, not Comparison. And would need to have a .pdf for download, otherwise on web एध॒ँis displayed incorectly. Bibliography in Devanagari would be great as well, because the transliateration used is a bit odd. As per <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/Student_Thesis/shailaja_PhD.pdf> - I'll want to read it in full.
