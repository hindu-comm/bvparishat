Hello,  

Thank you for your feedback.  

  

She actually did a comparison, and not just prepared the concordance.  

Regarding the transliteration, only IAST is used.  

  

Regarding PDF: If you see the interface, this is not just concordance, but we are also providing links to the actual v.rtti.  

The meaning field is also sensitive to the mouse movement. You will get the 'meaning analysis' in a tooltip if available, when we bring the cursor over the meaning.  
  

The roots are also linked to the existing verb conjugator available at our site.  
  

With a PDF, some of the functionality will be lost.  
  
Regards,  
Amba
