Oh, right. My work on remaking Palsule ready for a new print started in 2006 and good to know no one else ever tried.

The thing I lack the most with this work is it's **not reusable**. I would want an .xml or .xls - something I can play myself with.

Make at least a .pdf, because an online service is great, but open source, code and grammar info - even better. Thanks.
