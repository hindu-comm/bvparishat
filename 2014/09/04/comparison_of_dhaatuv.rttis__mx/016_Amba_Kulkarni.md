Thank you Prof. Bhat for the explanation.  
  

Yes, the whole purpose of the exercise was to add the information of 'functional' accent, so that only with the help of dhaatupaa.tha with the functional-accented-root with the anubandha information and the [ga.na](http://ga.na) information, one can generate the verbal conjugation following Panini.  
  

Till now such a dhaatupaa.tha was not available in electronic form.  
  

In Palsule's concordance the dhaatus are listed alphabetically. This leads to loss of information. Because, Panini uses the information of order of the dhaatus in suutras such as rudaadibhya.h saarvadhaatuke (A 7.2.76).  
  

Now with the help of a machine interface, one can get all the three views: sorted alphabetically, sorted according to the meanings and also the original order.
