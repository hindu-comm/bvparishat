Dear Mārcis,  
  

एध॒ँ is a rendering problem. Here she has given the svara information along with the ँ symbol. Because of the underscore, a standard Unicode symbol used for udaattasvara, it is rendered as एध॒ँ. The font which is used is not supporting to display both together.  
  

So are you (or any scholars in this group) aware of any font which avoids this type of rendering problems and display it properly?  
  

Thank you.
