ब॑र॒हँ यूनिकोड् Baraha Unicode font

  

ब॑र॒ह॓ Unicode

  

All the three Unicode accent fonts available.

  

I could not understand the accent system which is complicated. As I can see from the Madhaviyadhatuvritti, the above list beginning from एध up to कथ are उदात्ता अनुदात्तेतः।

  

कत्थान्ता उदात्ताः, अनुदात्तेतः

  

which means the धातु-s up to एध are उदात्त and अनुदात्तेत्

  

Both of the accents have functinal importance.

  

The second has the government of आत्मनेपद suffixes and this mark should indicate the पद of the verb. The second also has grammatical function, as in एकाच उपदेशेऽनुदात्तात्  7-2-10 which is different from the accented इत्. Here the verb is having उदात्त accent, but having अनुदात्त as इत्। Hence accentuation mark should be presented with both marks since both accents have grammatical functional importance. I think it is this attempt that resulted in the above presentation.
