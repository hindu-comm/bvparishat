Some counter-examples where ड occurs between vowels

  

अडिग,आडम्बर,उडुगन,उडुप,चकडोरी,डावाँडोल/डामाडोल,डीलडौल,निडर, बेडौल,सुडौल,विडम्बना, etc.

Many Tatsama words in Hindi have ड changed to ड़, but the pure Tatsama form is also correct and is preferred by purists like me. But some Tatsama words (examples above) do not have this \[optional\] change.

Sometimesट in Sanskrit changes to ड़ in Hindi, e.g. ताटका becomes ताड़का.I prefer ताटका in Hindi (unless citing original Prakrit sources like RCM which uses ताड़का as in 1.356.8 केहि बिधि तात ताड़का मारी॥).This change is also seen in Tadbhava words for example घटी becomes घड़ी,
घोटक becomes घोड़ा, etc. However this is also not universal, e.g. पटु stays पटु, कटु stays कटु (even though the Tadbhava कड़ुवा the change is made) and कटुता stays कटुता.
