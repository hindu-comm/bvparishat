Of course not!

  

Its the Prakrit effect. ड़ is a Prakrit sound different from Sanskrit ड. However, ड is pronounced as ड़ when Tatsama words are used in some Prakrits of Northern India (maybe even in Bengali - I am not sure), hence the wrong orthographic convention in the book (even in this standard book!). This is a perfectionist's nightmare.

  

Similarly, ळ does not exist in Laukika Sanskrit, but several publishers in the Southern India follow the wrong orthographic convention of writing ल as ळ in Sanskrit works.
