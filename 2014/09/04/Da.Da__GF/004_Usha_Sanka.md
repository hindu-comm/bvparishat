Thank God.



I was afraid, how I missed it all these years!! Was confused having found it in an authentic dictionary!

OK. There are many places in that dictionary which conform to Bengali standards more than Samskrt. Same case with Vachaspatyam. Both originate from same land.. it seems.

Then I share it.



I experience that every now and then. I have to invent new ways to search for those words.

Minor issues, I should say- but enough to mislead a Samskrta-adhyAyI.

In other works bearable.. may be. Surely not in a dictionary. That original word will be lost for the world, for ever, as far as that dictionary is concerned. Eg. I searched for pravAla in SKD.. never found it. Opened Apte- searched- then found this -"see prabAla" - then the issue was hit, searched SKD- searched prabAla.. and found it.

I think, everyone using those dictionaries might have experienced this.. it's not my experience alone. There is a need to give atleast an alternative word in digital dictionaries for such entries.

  

Thankyou once again.

-Usha.
