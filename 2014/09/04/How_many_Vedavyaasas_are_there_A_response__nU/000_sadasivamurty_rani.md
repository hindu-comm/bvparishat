Pranamsto all scholars!

In the progressive discussion on the topic "How manyVyaasasare there?" if it is keenly observed nowhere the question of "Historic Documentation" was spoken of in the initial mail triggered in this string. For two reasons the citations from VishnuMahaPurana and DeviBhagavataMahaPurana were given by me. The first reason is the TITLE OF THE  STRING ITSELF i.e. How manyVyaasaasare there?

The second reason is the fifth question of the same initial mail of this string i.e.\<(5) Who is VedaVyAsa? The same as the firstVyAsa?\> When the scholar who initiated is prepared to accept manyVYAASASgiving some information from some authentic sources is not felt wrong by me. Moreover while saying\<The list of theVedavyasasof the presentKalpaas found in theSriVishnuMahapuranais as follows:.. \>
I did not pass any comments of my own. Simply I have given the texts from both theMahaPuranas(Vishnu and DeviBhagavata).

When the very question is about the number ofVYASASwhere does the question of complexity arises if the list ofVYASASis given?

In this context I have a few questions -

My next question is about the word HISTORIC. Can there be any specification of HISTORIC and NON HISTORIC DOCUMENTS as far as our INDIAN HISTORY is concerned? Can we distinguish between the HISTORIC PERSONALITIES and MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONALITIES?

Can there be any definite proof to accept VEDAVYASAas a HISTORICPEROSONALITY? If there is nodefiniteproof and if we have to conclude him as a part of Mythological sections howVishnupuranaand DeviBhagavathacannot be worthy sources to speak about him?

My curiosity is about two more things:

1. a ‘ linear time scale’ , 2. the basic premise of a ‘ history of a society ’  

First I I would like to ask about the second one "The History of Society". If ourPURANAScannot be accepted HISTORIC DOCUMENTS to speak about our ancient India which historians can help us to know about our Ancient Indian Society?

a)Are theyHistoriographersof Enlightenment Schoolsuch as\_ James Mill, RobertOrme, Buchanan, Tyler andDubois,Elphinstone, Grand Duff andWillimaErskine?

b\) Or are theythe Sympathetic historianslike - Sir William Jones, Cunningham, Wilkinson, Munro, Malcolm and others?

c\) Or are theythe Evangelical Historiographerslike Shore or Grant?

d\) Or are they theAdministrator Historiographerslike MarkWilks, Grant Duff, James Todd,BabingtonMacaulay, William Hunter, Co. GBMalleson?

e\) Or are they the Rationalist Historians like -RajendralalMitra, RCDutt, RayChaudrietc?

f\) Or are they Economist Historians like - Major D.Basu, RCMajumdar,
CyChintamaniandSurendranathBanarjee?

g\) Or are they Marxist Historians like -HirenMukherjee, R.PlameDutt,Kosambiand others or their latter influenced professors likeRomillaThaper, Dr.BipinChandra and others?

COULD WE GIVE ANY COMFORTABLE PLACE TO THE NATIONALISTHISTRIANSLIKE - SwamiDayanandaSaraswati, Swami Vivekananda, VDSavarkar, Mrs. AnnieBesantand others who tried to bring out volumes of Indian history with true National Spirit?

In this context I would like to quote a few lines fromHISTORY- ITS THEORY and METHOD written by Prof. B. Sheik Ali, Former Vice Chancellor ofMangaloreUniversity who speaks about the Historic validity and content ofPURANAS.

QUOTE:

"The scope of thePuranas, eighteen in number, is very wide indeed, almost a popular encyclopedia of ancient andmedivalHinduism dealing with religious, philosophical, historical, personal, social and political matters. These books contain accounts of kings andRishis, religious beliefs, worships, observances and philosophy, personal social and political ordinances about all kinds of miscellaneous matters. To makeproepruseofhtisrich material superficial knowledge of Sanskrit will not help. We need great proficiency. With their commentaries it may not be possible to understand their real meaning.

Even today Good many a thinker of past likeVyasa,Valmiki,Kalidasa,Panini,Kautiliyaand others have not been fullyrehabitatedin history.....

do find in the literature of the past whether Ramayana or Mahabharata orPuranasor the Heroic Poem or the legends, plenty of material which is the hard core of History such as customs and manners, methods of warfare and art of government, trade and commerce, farming and agriculture, philosophy and religion, education and learning, genealogy of kings and rulers and all other essential aspects that form culture."

Now Indian needs NATIONALIST HISTORIANS and not the RATIONALIST HISTORIANS any more.

  

Now I would like to deal with thea ‘ linear time scale’ -

We never hesitate to tell our children and grand children thatValmikiandVyasawere the contemporaries of Rama andSriKrishna. We never hesitate to tell them that Rama belongs toTretaYugaandDvaparaYuga. Even at a very tender age at which they cannot understand aboutYUGASwe tell them these stories of RAMA and KRISHNA as happenings in theYUGAsspecified above.

But here we prepare to give very tough fight in the forums like this arguing against theYUGAandKALPAconcept.

All our day to day ritualisticactivitiesare based not on Christian era but strictly followingVikramaSakawhich according to our Indian Astronomers began in 58 BC andSalivahanaSakabegan in 72 AD.

But we are not able to accept KINGVIKRAM. We speak about ChandraguptaVikramadityaonly. We doubt about the deeds ofSalivahana.

We acceptYudhisthiraSakabut notYudhisthira.

In our everydaySandhyavandanaandNityapujasin thesankalpawe say -

अद्य ब्रह्मण: द्वितीयपरार्थे स्वेतवराहकल्पे वैवस्वतमन्वन्तरे कलियुगे प्रथमपादे....अस्मिन् वर्तमानव्यावहारिकचान्द्रमानेन ....संवत्सरे उत्तरायणे / दक्षिणायने...मासे ....पक्षे.......तिथौ....वासरे...नक्षत्रे...योगे....करणे...शुभतिथौ.....शोभने मुहूर्ते...  

Is this not Linear Time Scale?

While the western time scale consists of Seconds -Minutes- Hours - Days - Years and finally Era...

  

We have still larger units of time -Beginningwith:Liptawe have in progressive order -Vighadiya-Ghadiya-TithiandVasara-paksha-Masa-Rtu-Ayana-Samvatsara-Yuga-Mahayuga(Caturyuga) -Mavantara-Kalpa(A Day of Brahma), Brahma's Year and Brahma'sPurvapararthaandDvitiyaParartha...and all these time units are in our regular ritualistic use...still we feel delicacy to accept their validity...???????

Why this weakness? or Is this a kind ofhypocricy? (Accepting this time scale in all ourSamskarasandNityaKarmas...we hesitate to accept them as a part of our historic legacy). When we cannot believe them can we stop using them in the marriages and other auspicioussamskarasin our houses?

SO LET US THINK IN A WAY REQUIRED TO REBUILD OUR INDIAN HISTORY FROM OUR OWN SOURCES (Vedic,PuranicandItihasaSources). First let us refrain ourselves from using the word MYTHOLOGY referring to our ITIHASAS and PURANAS.

Warm regards to all.
