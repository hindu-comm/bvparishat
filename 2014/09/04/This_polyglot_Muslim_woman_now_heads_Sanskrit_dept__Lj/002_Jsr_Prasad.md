Respected Prof. RNI sir,  
  

Thanks for this valuable information. Dr. Nasreen's affiliation to Sanskrit demonstrates a positive attitude of breaking all barriers. Kudos to her parents who encouraged her to become a Sanskrit professor. As she rightly pointed out in the DH interview, we need to create better employment opportunities in Sanskrit studies.  
  

During my visit to Tripunithura Sanskrit college, long back as a student participant, I observed that 2/3rd of the students were girls and half of the girls were from Muslim community studying various shastras such as Nyaya, Vyakarana and Vedanta. Sanskrit University at Kalady must have considerable number of students from non-Hindu community.  
  

Regards,  
Prasad
