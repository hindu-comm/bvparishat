They need not tally. Simply because they have different recensions as you have already noticed besides two main versions: दश-पादी and पञ्चपादी, and the वृत्ति-s can be different versions as their source text.Even either Dasapadi, or Pancapadi. The Editors should have noticed them in numbering. whether they are having 1.... to 5.. or 1.xxx to 10.xxx, unlike अष्टाध्यायी, of Panini. but Kashika, Mahabhashya and other commentators have different texts and with different numbering.

  

You can follow the edition for numbering, if you are looking for giving a reference. Or you can give all the numbers in both Dasapadi, or/and Pancapadi, with the numberings in the Vritti-s on all the versions. Pancapadi has come down through Siddhantakaumudi for us. Like Asthtadhyayi, it may have difference in numberings and the number of Sutra-s in different recensions. Just a glance at numbering, if the numbering goes beyond 6.01 it belongs Dasapadi. Anyhow there is a searchable version of Pancapadi in Devanagari You may try in it, if the number tallies. You can find the same Sutra-s in different sections in Dasapadi.
