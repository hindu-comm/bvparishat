Brahma varchas is a unit of gayatri parivar and they were conducting researches on the effects of yajna in the laboratory arround1984.I think a visit to the site in Haridwar on Haridwar Rishikesh road will be very useful. May be they have some website too. The Devsanskriti vishvavidyalaya is also managed by gayatri parivar, popularly known as Shantikunj institution started by Late Shri Ram Sharma.
