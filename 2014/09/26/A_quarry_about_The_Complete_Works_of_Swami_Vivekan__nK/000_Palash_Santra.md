Respected Scholars.  
Praanam.  
Myself Palash Santra a Ph.d Scholar from Rashtriya Sanskrit  
Vidyapeetha. I want to do a Critical work on the Book "The Complete  
Works Of Swami Vivekananda".  
I searched a lot, but could not find any works in Ph.d on this Book.  
but i am still in doubt. is there any work done on this Book? if you  
have any information about this matter kindly inform me..  
Thank You.
