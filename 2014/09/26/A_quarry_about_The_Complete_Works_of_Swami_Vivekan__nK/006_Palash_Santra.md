Thank you all for your response.  
Actually I know, The Complete Works Of Swami Vivekananda is not a  
single book, it has 9 volumes. as I am reading this volume base Book  
from last February and it is continuing. It has a vast area. It is not  
possible to do a Critical work on the whole 9 volumes. So I have  
thought to select a particular area. It may like, "A Critical Study on  
Advaita System in The Complete Work Of Swami Vivekananda."  
  
Some persons suggested me to change the title, according to their  
suggestion the title is, "A Critical Study on Advaita thinking of  
Swami Vivekananda." but the problem is there is another book exist in  
Bengali, named, "Vivekanader Advaita Chinta", (Vivekananda's Advaita  
thinking), Written by Dinesh Shastri Ji,  
  
So, it ll be a copy work if I go with the Suggested Title.  
I am in confusion.  
Some suggestion are needed.
