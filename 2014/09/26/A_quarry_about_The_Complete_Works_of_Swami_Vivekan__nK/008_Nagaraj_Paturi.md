This or 'contemporaneity of the Advaita thought of Swami Vivekanda' should be good enough.

Please go through the book "Vivekanader Advaita Chinta", if you know Bengali. Or, you may take the help of someone who knows Bengali.



Respond to that book in your dissertation.

-Your work will not be called a copy work if you bring out new analyses or contribute new knowledge on the same topic.



But as suggested by Dr. Prasad, before anything, make sure you are confident of your training in Vedanta in general and Advaita Vedanta in particular.
