Dear Palash,



is there any work done on this Book?



-'Complete works of Swami Vivekananda' is not a single book.



What is the area of research within the purview of Rashtriya Sanskrita Vidyapeeth that you view your proposed work as belonging to?



If it is in general on Vivekananda's literature/ thought, there are some critical works done . Some are PhD works. Some are not.



But be sure, is it on a book or books of Swamiji or on his thought? What is the area of research?



Best wishes.



Nagaraj
