It is a collection of his writing during his life time. Now it is available online.

  

Published in 9 volumes and unpublished works including Appendices.

  

But one should select the area and topic first and ask if the topic has been studied by others. He should survey the literature available in the area in the libraries. Anyhow, Mr.Shankar has given a list of topics studied on Vivekananda. It may be covering all the thesises or there may be. some list of Thesises were published in some sites, in BVP itself the lists were provided. Some lists are published also.
