As part of your hypothetical proposal, a fragment of 'literature survey' is done by Sri Shankara and other senior members of this forum. Until unless you narrow down your focus to a certain topic, it is highly difficult for us to suggest you to confine to a topic. Here follows the comments:  

  

> It is not possible to do a Critical work on the whole 9 volumes.

  
Good, you realized the intensity of work involved in the complete works of SV.  
  

> So I have thought to select a particular area. It may like, "A > Critical Study on  
> Advaita System in The Complete Work Of Swami Vivekananda."  

  

the chosen topic is totally contrary to your previous statement. When it is not possible to work on the entire set of volumes, how can you study critically the complete works. Even if you want to extend your study to the whole of Swami Vivekananda's works, are you equipped to deal with his kind of references and discussions to Jainism, Buddhism, Christianity, Samkhya and Yoga, in the realm of Vedanta? Swami Vivekananda's repertoire is so vast, he covers Vedantic aspects from East to West.

Let's assume that this subject has not been dealt by any scholar in any language, even then, the scope is very wide given your resources and time frame. Refer back to my previous comment. You need to introspect your strengths and weaknesses in the domain of Advaita Vedanta. In terms of management, you are advised to make a SWOT analysis (S - Strength, W - Weakness, O - Opportunity, T - Threat). Believe me, this is not to belittle your enthusiasm in the subject, but only a suggestion to introspect your ability based on the resources at your disposal. Being ambitious and enthusiastic is different than completing the thesis systematically within the stipulated time.

I went through the indices of all 9 volumes. Based on your current interest, it seems that the 2nd volume may be appropriate to your hypothetical question. Vol. 6 also has got some discussion on comparative religious studies. You are advised not to use big terms in your topic like 'Vedanta' etc., but minimise to certain terms like '*nishkama karma'* , '*avidya*' and so on and so forth. It is up to you to decide and lock on a topic within your own purview. Because, you know your strength better than anyone else. If we suggest any topic, that may be a biased one or based on our own interests.  
  

A question:  

As much as I know, Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha follows a policy to submit *Vidyavaridhi* thesis in Sanskrit only. Are you fully prepared to critically analyze Swami Vivekananda's thoughts on Vedanta culled out from his books in English and present them back in Sanskrit?  

  

A suggestion:  

Sri Ajit ji and Sri Subramanian ji have tried to point you to the use of 'quarry' in the subject of your post. But you are continuing discussion in the same thread. As a researcher, you should be positive to cultivate a trait to learn from elder's suggestions.  

  

However, come back to us with more precise question and we wish you good luck in your project.  
  

Best wishes
