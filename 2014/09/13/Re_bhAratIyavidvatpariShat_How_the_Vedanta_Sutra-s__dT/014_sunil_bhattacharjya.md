Namaste,  
  

You may be referring to the inscription found in the Parthasarathy (Krishna) temple in Parthivasekarapuram (Parthivapuram, in short) village in the Kannyakumari district. The temple was built by the Ay king Karunandadakkan,who claimed to belong to the line of the Yaadavas or Ayars, traced their ancestry to the Yadu kula of Lord Krishna.. The temple was consecrated in 857 CE. There is possibility that the copper plate could have been prepared during the reign of King Vikramaditya, who succeeded (Kok)Karunandakkan. The Directorate of the Archaeologiacal Survey of India may be able to throw more light on this.
