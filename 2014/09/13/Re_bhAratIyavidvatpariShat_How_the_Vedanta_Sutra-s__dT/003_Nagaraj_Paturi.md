1\. In fact मीमांसाis the short version of वेदार्थमीमांसा. Both पूर्वमीमांसा andउत्तरमीमांसाare वेदार्थमीमांसा only. brāhmaṇas and āraṇyakas also do the same. That is, they too do vēdārthavichāraṇā only. Jaimini followed the path shown by the brāhmaṇas and āraṇyakas that did vēdārthavichāraṇā in a karma-oriented way in his mīmāmsā sūtras. Vyāsa followed the path shownby the Upanishad-portions of the brāhmaṇas and āraṇyakas that did vēdārthavichāraṇā in a mōkṣa-oriented way in his mīmāmsā sūtras. To distinguishVyāsa's mīmāmsā sūtras from the Jaimini's mīmāmsā sūtras, all the words such as पूर्वमीमांसा andउत्तरमीमांसाcame into vogue. Thus there is no surprise that what you see in Brahma sūtras is vēdārthavichāraṇā and not upanishadarthavichāraṇā , of course, vēdārthavichāraṇā inthe upaniṣanmārga.



2.'nyāya-prasthānam' is ahighly significantword. This word is used in books such as vākyapadīyamtoo. Invākyapadīyam , Bhartr̥hari distinguishes betweenśuṣkatarka /svakapōlakalpita tarka andāgama orśāstraviśiṣṭatarka. Evenśankarāchārya means āgama or vēdāntaśāstraviśiṣṭatarka by 'nyāya-prasthānam'.Second important point that comes out from the word 'nyāya-prasthānam' is that what a book like Brahmasūtras can do is toshow 'the method' but not toprovideentire content of the subject exhaustively.
