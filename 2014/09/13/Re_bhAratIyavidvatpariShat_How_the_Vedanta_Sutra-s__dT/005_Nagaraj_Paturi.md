1\. Thanks for bringing Ramanuja's view into discussion.



2\. But there was no post mentioning the view that purva and Uttara Mimasa are opposed to each other.



3\. None of the posts were specifically Advaitic though S'ankara was mentioned for some alternative words such as शारीरकमीमांसा and वेदान्तमीमांसाfor the content of the Brahma Sutras.



4\. That Ramanuja accepted separate identity for Vedanta Sutras is evident from his separate commentary to the Sutras.



5\. Continuity between the two mīmāmsās is found right from śankara. Of course the details of the kind of continuity vary from one school of Vedanta to the other.



6\. That Pūrva and Uttara Mīmāmsā are opposed to each other entirely is not found in any school. But certain views of pūrva mīmāmsā are taken as pūrvapakṣa in some discussions of Vēdānta just as they are taken in some discussions of nyāya and vyākaraṇa darśanas.



But various views in this regard are certainly worth discussing.
