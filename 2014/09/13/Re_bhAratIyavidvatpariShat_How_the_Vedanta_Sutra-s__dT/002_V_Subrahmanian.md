It may also be noted that the Brahmasutras are called 'nyāya-prasthānam' since it uses logic to decide on the purport of often apparently conflicting shruti vākyams. That is why one can find the hetu-panchamī in many sutras: shāstrayonitvāt, Ikṣhateḥ nāśabdam, tattu samanvayāt, etc.  
  
Another feature to be noted is that the sūtra prasthāna takes the aid of smṛti too as is evident in several sūtras such as 'smṛteśca', '....pratyakṣānumānābhyām'.. (here 'pratyakṣa' refers to śruti and anumāna refers to smṛti). In the bhāṣya one can find the mention of Bhagavadgītā, manusmṛti, etc. as references for smṛti, although the adhikaraṇas are such as having upaniṣadic sentences as viṣayavākyas.
