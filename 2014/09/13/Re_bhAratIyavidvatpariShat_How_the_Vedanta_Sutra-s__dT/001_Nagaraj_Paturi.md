V. Subrahmanianji already quoted the words of S'ankaracharya as:



यथा चायमर्थः सर्वेषां वेदान्तानाम्, तथा वयमस्यां *शारीरकमीमांसायां* प्रदर्शयिष्यामः । *वेदान्तमीमांसाशास्त्रस्य* व्याचिख्यासितस्येदमादिमं सूत्रम् —



S'ankaracharya's is the oldest of the discussions on Brahmasutras. Thus the words शारीरकमीमांसा and वेदान्तमीमांसा are the oldest among the words used in reference to the subject matter of the Sutras that are being called Brahmasutras.



AadaraNIya Anilji's impression seems to be that Brahma Sutras are being considered as the Sutra form of Upanishads only and that is why those sutras are being considered Vedanta.



The Sutras are being called Vedanta not because they are 'distilled from' Upanishads but because they do the same thing as the Upanishads do. Brahmajijnaasaa is what the Upanishads do and that is what the Sutras do too. Most of the non-Upanishadic BraahmaNas and AaraNyakas discuss the Mantrabhaaga of the Vedas from the Karma-oriented perspective. Such a discussion is done in the Jaimini's Meemaamsaa Sutras. Upanishads / Upanishadic portions of the BraahmaNas and AaraNyakas discuss the Mantrabhaaga of the Vedas from the MOksha-oriented perspective.Sutras that are being called Brahma Sutras do the same as what Upanishads / Upanishadic portions of the BraahmaNas and AaraNyakas do. That is the name Vedantagiven to Upanishads is given to these Sutras too.
