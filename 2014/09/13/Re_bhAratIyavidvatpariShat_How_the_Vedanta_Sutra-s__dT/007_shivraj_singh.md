Dear Scholars,  

I recently came across a reference that I am trying to corroborate:  
  
A learned scholar sent me this snippet:  
  
"Kokkaru Nanthadakkan's inscription written 1100 years ago. It was written on "The fourteen hundred thousand, forty nine thousand and eighty seventh day having expired after the beginning of Kali yuga.""  
  
Is anyone familiar with Kokkaru Nanthadakkan? Does anyone have a fascimile of the inscription?  
  
Best Wishes,  
Shivraj
