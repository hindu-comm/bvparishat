A small correction. Not the complete Veda-s, but the subject dealing with ब्रह्म as he has explicitly refers to as explained by Madhusudhanasarasvati in his प्रस्थानभेदः --- श्रवणाख्यविचारप्रतिपादकान्न्यायानुपदर्शयन्ती भगवता बादरायणेन कृता । तत्र सर्वेषामपि वेदान्तवाक्यानां साक्षात्परम्पराया वा प्रत्यगभिन्नाऽद्वितीये ब्रह्मणि तात्पर्यमिति समन्वयः प्रथमाध्यायेन प्रदर्शितः ।

  

See for the rest of Prasthana-s explained by Madhusudana Sarasvati ---

So you have been educated so long ago, what is प्रस्थानभेद, and what does ब्रह्मसूत्र-s deal with. So by the scope of its subject, it can be called वेदान्तशास्त्र and the the सूत्र can be called safely as वेदान्तसूत्र-s or ब्रह्मसूत्र-s or शारीरकमीमांसा or उत्तरमीमांसा to contrast with पूर्वमीमांसा by topic dealt with by the topic dealt with. And प्रस्थानत्रय is another one, combining the texts and classifying the literature, on the whole, for वेदान्तशास्त्र.

  

But in my opinion, मीमांसा as वेदाङ्ग primarily denotes both, where Vedic Sentences are sorted our by the topic dealt with. Hence the differentiation. Up to ब्राह्मण-s the topic dealt with is कर्म or चोदना or धर्म. The उत्तरमीमांसा deals with the deals with ब्राह्मण-s and आरण्यक-s where ब्रह्म is dealth with. उपनिषत्-s are spread in between ब्राह्मण-s and आरण्यक-s.

  

  

वेदान्तः, पुं, (वेदानां अन्तः ।) उपनिषत् ।  
इति हेमचन्द्रः । वेदव्यासप्रणीतदर्शनशास्त्र-  
विशेषोऽपि । यथा । वेदान्तो नाम उपनिषत्-  
प्रमाणं तदुपकारीणि शारीरकसूत्रादीनि च ।  
इति परमहंसपरिव्राजकाचार्य्यश्रीसदानन्द-  
योगीन्द्रविरचितवेदान्तसारः।  

  

Other scholars may suggest more in the matter of naming the Sutra-s by बादरायण. I would like to know the title of the sUtra-pATha, from the colophon as in the manuscripts. Otherwise it should have been mentioned explicitly I am writing this work. In the absence of both we can just follow the traditional practice appropriate found in the commentaries.

  

With regards
