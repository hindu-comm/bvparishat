Yes. I have also heard of it. It may be due to his popularity as the prfounder of Advaita theory out of Vedanta Sutra-s, before Ramanuja and later it remained attached to his. And Ramanuja's differentiated by adding qualification as विशिष्ट because of the difference from Ramanjua. When Madhva came with his न्याय, logically established अद्वैत was wrong in theory, and only Dvaita, based on तर्कसिद्धन्त, his theory was called द्वैतसिद्धान्त, and not द्वैतवेदान्त. शङ्कर feels, अनुभव as प्रमाण, but it is excluded in a सिद्धान्त. This seems to be the reason to differentiate. I could not substantiate my view with quotations from any original source.

The relationship between the two is only both are called as मीमांसा, as the वेदाङ्ग, divided into two कर्ममीमांसा and शारीरकमीमांसा, which have different views. Only Advaita, does not accept कर्म as means for मुक्ति, or ज्ञानकर्मसमुच्चय. And hence by themselves, are not opposed to each other, as the topic itself is different totally. It depends on the commentators. Badarayana and Jaimini are referred to in both.

  

Jaimini ---

  

ante tu *bādarāyaṇas* teṣāṃ pradhānaśabdatvāt / Jaim_5,2.19 /  



and so on.and refers to himself in

  

karmābhedaṃ tu *jaiminiḥ* prayogavacanaikatvāt sarveṣām upadeśaḥ syād iti / Jaim_6,3.4 /  

  

The same with Badarayana, who refers to Jaimini

  

ata eva na devatā bhūtaṃ ca \| BBs_1,2.28 \|

sākṣād apy avirodhaṃ ***jaiminiḥ*** \| BBs_1,2.29 \|

  

References to himself:

  

anusmṛter *bādariḥ* \| BBs_1,2.31 \|  

ṛdyapekṣayā tu manuṣyādhikāratvāt \| BBs_1,3.24 \|  
tadupary api *bādarāyaṇaḥ* saṃbhavāt \| BBs_1,3.25 \|  

  

madhvādiṣv asaṃbhavād anadhikāraṃ ***jaiminiḥ*** \| BBs_1,3.30 \|

jyotiṣi bhāvāc ca \| BBs_1,3.31 \|

bhāvaṃ tu ***bādarāyaṇo*** 'sti hi \| BBs_1,3.32 \|

and so on 14 occurrences refer to himself. Here the difference betwen the two is evident. This is a side point, both the authors refer to themselves by name.

  

Except these clear differences, both are not opposed to each other as the topic is at all different, कर्म and ज्ञान as is denoted by the words by the commentators, कर्ममीमांसा and शारीरकमीमांसा.
