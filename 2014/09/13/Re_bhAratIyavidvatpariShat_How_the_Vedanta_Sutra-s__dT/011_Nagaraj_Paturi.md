1\. AadaraNIya Ajitji, you are right. One of the representational aberrations that happened during the 19th century representations of Indian culture to the outside world was the impression created about Advaita Vedanta that that was the only school of Vedanta. Is orientalism of the European scholars responsible for this? In this case, no. There appears no scope for any conspiracy theory in this regard on the part of the Europeans. It appears to be just a part of the process of learning about a new culture on their part. But there was no dearth of efforts to correct the situation on the partof the Indian scholars. Please look at the attached snapshot of an 1899 book, an English translation of Sri Bhashya by M. Rangacharya and M BVaradaraja Aiyengar. Please take note of the absence of any tone of disgruntlement in the words of the two translators.

  

Swami Vivekananda too, used the word Vedanta almost synonymous with Advaita in his general speeches.But he did not miss to bring it to the notice of his audience that there were the other schools of Vedanta too. His general use of the term Vedanta in the sense of Advaita Vedanta was rooted in his personal subscription to Advaita. But on many occasions he highlighted the non-Advaitic schools of Vedanta also. Advaita Ashrama/Ramakrishna Math published a book 'Bhakti Schools of Vedanta' by Swami Tapasyananda. 

  

2\. Thanks to Dr. H N Bhat who responded to your responses and clarified many issues.

  

3\. All Advaitins take Poorva Meemaamsaa as their guide in the aspects of their practice wherever it is relevant. These aspects are not small in number and are not less significant.
