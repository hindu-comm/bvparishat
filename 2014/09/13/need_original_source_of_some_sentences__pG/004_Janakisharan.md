\> Try to provide more hints from MSS if they are present.  
  

These sentences are written as in व्याख्या by the author of the MSS. The name of the MSS is कैवल्यदीपिका of Krishna Pandita. In his own commentary of कैवल्यदीपिका he quoted these sentences.

  
  
\> BTW, It is not necessary that all are quotes from other works, they may  
\> be his own kArikA-s. So, confirm that all shloka-s you presented are  
\> brought as 'quoted' by the author.  
  

All the shloka-s/sentences are presented here are not own quotations of the author. as everywhere he writes "तथा चोक्तं", "इति उच्यते", "इति श्रुतेः", इति स्मृतेः", "इति वचनात्" etc. If you need I will display the full paragraphs where these sentences are presented.  
  
thank you
