Dear Usha Sanka,  
  
Audio-visual lecture on "Indian culture found in neighbouring countries"  
A cultural journey to Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan.  
  
I am indeed happy to know your interest about this topic. As you have told, such information makes us feel happy and proud about our glorious past. I and my husband Mr.B.S.Manohar have been giving Audio-Visual Lectures on the above subject based on our visits to Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia and Japan and further research conducted thereon. Please see the notes attached.  
  
We feel as though we are seeing our own culture in a mirror when we visit our neighbouring countries. It is heartening to know how our dear Girvana Bhasha is connected with their spoken language and culture.

NamasteVery  
happy to have this information.I had  
heard that Japanese have very good feeling for  
गङ्गा and they dream of taking bath atleast once  
in their life time. Just heard from someone who visited  
there.  
Only if  
Indians residing in foreign lands let us have more a picture  
of what amount or extent or ways of Hindu  
संस्कृति the natives of foreign lands  
(non-Indians) follow. It will be a good study.. at least  
in countries around India.  
This is  
not wanting to prove anything- but we feel happy to be  
connected in some way. And it will improve our knowledge  
about ourselves too. Sometimes we are unaware that some  
ritual found there was once here! So it will be a  
happy reunion.May be  
BVP members who are NRIs can contribute in more of these  
aspects.. by sharing whatever they can observe, study and  
understand by virtue of their stay..Thankyou  
so much.-vinItAउषा

            Worship of Vedic gods  
in Japan  
  
                 
----------------------------------------------  
  
  
  
Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kyoto  
reminds me of our visit to that beautiful temple city. An  
invitation to present my paper in 14th World Sanskrit  
Conference in Kyoto, Japan gave me an opportunity to look at  
the history of Japan which tells us about the divine bond  
between the two countries.  
  
  
  
Toji Temple, visited by our P.M in Kyoto is known as  
Guardian Temple that has huge idols of Ashta Dikpalakas -  
Guardian deities along with Buddha. It was founded in 794  
AD.  
  
  
  
1.Taishaku (East; Indra).  
  
2.Ka (SE; Agni)  
  
3.Emma (South; Yama)  
  
4 Rasatsu (SW; Nirruti- Rakshasa)  
  
5.Sui (West; Varuna).  
  
6.Fu (NW; Marut, Vayu)  
  
7 Bishamon (North; Kubera, Vaishravana).  
  
7.Ishana (NE; Ishana – Śiva).  
  
8 Gat (Moon- Candra)  
  
  
  
There are Temples dedicated to Indra in Shibamata area and  
Katasuhika ward of Tokyo. Philip Franz Von Siebold, a  
German scholar has listed 131 Shrines dedicated to Goddess  
Sarasvati and 100 to Lord Ganesha in Tokyo itself in  
1832.  
  
  
  
We can see the idols of Shinto and Budhism along with  
Vedic deities placed in the same temple side by side. They  
co-exist along with Vedic thoughts, Rituals, Tantricism and  
Buddhism. The Japanese also perform "homa" known  
as "goma" to their deities even today.  
  
  
  
Worship of Hindu gods continues in Japan even now because It  
is commonly believed there, that the Hindu deities if  
worshipped properly; bestow material benefits and other  
favors in day to day life quickly. Many Hindu Gods which  
were integrated into Indian Buddhism travelled far and wide  
and reached Japan and have got an exalted position there. It  
is interesting to note that the Japanese retained the status  
of Indra from Vedic period and worshiped him as main deity  
bestowing powers to the Kings in their combat by many  
Emperors.
