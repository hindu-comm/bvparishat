Hare Krishna.  
Dear Sirs,  
I could find following in Srimad Bhagavatam 3rd Canto, chapter 11  
regarding time measurement units in those times:  
  
One truTi - 8/13,500 second  
One vedha- 8/135 second  
One lava - 8/45 second  
One nimeSha- 8/15 second  
One kShaNa- 8/5 second  
One kAShThA-8 seconds  
One laghu- 2 minutes  
One daNDa- 30 minutes  
One prahara- 3 hours  
One day - 12 hours  
One night - 12 hours  
One pakSha- 15 days  
More higher time scales are also mentioned there like yugas,  
divya-yugas, days-nights and life time of brahma. May be this can  
help.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
