1\. It is neither improbable nor inappropriate for 'lipta' to have a Greek origin.



2\. It is true that the history of a'lipta' with a Greek origin would help throw light on Greek-Sanskrit interaction.



3\. Currently the word 'lipta' as a time unit is widely being circulated in the majority of Indian astrological circles. Whether it has come into this degree of currency without any authentic textual source (through probably some undocumented oral tradition) or it has a textual documentation of an older time needs to be verified.



4\. The Paraas'ara Samhita quote I gave is from secondary sources which did not provideproper references to the original sources.



5\. I shall be on a look out for the primary source and shall get back to you if I am successful in my efforts.



6\. Let us also wait for AadaraNIya Sadashiva Murtyji to return from the pilgrimage.
