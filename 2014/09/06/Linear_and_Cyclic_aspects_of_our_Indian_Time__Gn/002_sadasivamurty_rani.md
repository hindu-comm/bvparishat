rniyengar mahodaya!

Pranams.

Thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to once again go through our Ancient Indian Astronomical works and KOSA granthas. The word LIPTAA is found in the Units of Kshetra and not in the Units of Kaala in Texts like Surya Siddhanta. But in Brahma Siddhanta and Parasara Hora Sastra there is a recommendation to the extent of adapting the names of KAALA Units to Kshetra Units and vice versa. Even Vacaspatyam (Nighantu) LIPTAA (AAkaranta Strilinga Sabda) is given as a time unit.

I could collect some more sources in support of LIPTAA as a KAALA unit. But now I am starting to VARANASI and come back on 15th September to my place. Then I shall take the opportunity to give my detailed answer.

With warm regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
