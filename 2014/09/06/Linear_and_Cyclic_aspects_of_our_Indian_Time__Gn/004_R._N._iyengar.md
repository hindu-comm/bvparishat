Dr.Murty,Namaste, The reference texts cited by you are well known (see below). But they do not seem to support your meaning of "Lipta"as a small measure of time. I could not locate ''lipta in BPHS. For that I await your return from the holy city. Utpala in his commentary on Br.sam quotes Parashara-tantra (brought out by me in book form in 2013).

There are two definitions for Kaala here. The older one is 2.1. But a new one is added in 2.2 which contains the word Liptaa. Kaala-kshetrayoh saamyam means only a similarity but not sameness.

Like 30 muhurtas for a day there are 30 parts in a Rashi etc..The kshetra above is the path of sun (ecliptic), with respect to nakshatras, though not explicitly stated to be so in this place.

Since I am working on the historical foundations of siddhantic astronomy, (particularly about its indigenous roots), this discussion has become necessary.

  

thanks
