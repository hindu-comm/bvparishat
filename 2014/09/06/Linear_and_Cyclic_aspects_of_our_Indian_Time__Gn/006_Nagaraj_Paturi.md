Parāśara Samhita has verses giving time measure in terms of liptas.



AadaraNIya Rani Sadashiv Murtyji's explanation that the words forspatial/angular measures being extended metaphorically for time measures is not unusual is convincing.Such a usagehas parallels in western terminology for time measure also. The most used terms 'minutes' and 'seconds' themselves are examples. It is well known that they are both angular and time measures.
