I realize that the present widespread use of lipta vilipta as time units in almost every corner of Indian astrological circles in all the discussions of Ancient Indian time measure traces its use to Parasara Samhita as quoted by Bhattotpala in his commentary of Brihat Samhita only. Everyone seems to be going with तत्र कालाक्षेत्रयो स्साम्यम्

.

The copy of Brihat Samhita I have is from Archive.org and is a 1946 publication with PVS Shastry's English translation.
