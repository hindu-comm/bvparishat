Namaste

  

The question of \< greek astronomy/ astrology as source of vedic astrology/ astronomy> can not be satisfactorily resolved without

Total clarity \< on antecedent - precedent- derivative> Modelling and relation of Greek-Latin and other languages in relation to

Vedic language, in the frame work of Paninian rules.

  

In the current scenario of debates, there is an abundant prejudice overloaded in the views of debaters on both sides;

The greek influence team looking at a historic linear time scale and

Indian thinkers preferring larger than life cyclic time scales.

  

The instrument based time measure - like the seconds based on natural oscillation of a quartz crystal, the frequency of light coupled the measure of speed of light need to have a clarity of concept

In traditional frame.

Translating light- year = jyotirvarsha; seconds= a specific unit of time connected to wink of eye or articulation of a sound unit is extremely individualized working.

  

In short, there is a critical need to revisit the theories of languages and language- derivative vocabulary across technical disciplines.

  

The errors of translation and text- inaccuracies have added newer dimensions in these studies; these are also to be addressed.
