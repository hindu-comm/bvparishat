Dear Prof.Paturi, I am not questioning whether 'Lipta' could be used for time measure. The doubt is whether it WAS used by our ancient astronomers or sky watchers as a 'time measure'. For clarifying this I have to depend on Sanskrit texts and hence my curiosity. I would be greatly obliged if you can quote and give references to "Parāśara Samhita" (publisher, chapter/verses) which you mention in your post. It will be of immense interest to me if it is different from the prose text I have quoted from Utpala's commentary on the Br.Samhita. Since "lipta' as an angular unit (arc-minute) is original to Greece, notwithstanding its Sanskritic-sound-form, study of this issue helps one in knowing how and when the interaction might have taken place. As a matter of fact Kala and Vikala were used for the same angular units namely Lipta and Vilipta by some but not all. Hence there is a possibility even in pre-siddhantic period there was the concept of angle measure, but this is not a well studied topic (to the best of my knowledge). Now, one may point out 'Angula" and "Angle" are perhaps phonetically too close(I am not a linguist)and hence "angula' of the Shulbasutras could have been used for the "kshetra" that is the space in the sky. But there are no evidences for such use. Angula is a linear measure in the shulba sutras. The concept of 'similarity between time and sky-space' goes back to the Matrayaniya AraNyaka (6.14-18), but the smallest angular-space measure indirectly mentioned there is "amsha" taken to be equal to one-fourth of Nakshatra-span. The status of the word "Lipta" as a Snaskrit word is of historical importance. In this connection I request BVP scholars to enlighten me on whether traditional Sanskrit Grammarians have used "Lipta" as a time measure in their texts anywhere.
