A keen study of our astronomical texts help us to appreciate their intelligence in introducing both Linear and Cyclic aspects of our Indian Time.

एवं विधेरहोरात्रै: कालगत्योपलक्षितै:।

अपक्षितमिवास्यापि (ब्रह्मण:) परमायुर्वय:शतम्॥

यदर्थमयुषस्तस्य परार्धमभिधीयते।

पूर्व: परार्धोऽपक्रान्तो ह्यपरोऽद्य प्रवर्तते॥

While Lipta is one of the lowest units of time the HIGHEST unit of time is BRAHMAUYU   =(360KALPAS AND 360 KALPA LENGTH OF TIME X100 = 100YEARS of BRAHMA). This is not Cyclic. This is Linear only.

Further TWO PARARTHAS (Purva Parartha - First Fifty years of Brahma's age and Dvitiya Parartha - The later Fifty years of Brahma's Age ) are also Linear.

Then the KALPAS and PRALAYAS (The days and Nights of Brahma’s age) are also Linear as our HUMAN DAYS and NIGHTS.

Each of these KALPAS consist of 1000 Mahayugas. These Mahayugas are CYCLIC.

In a span of KALPA there are 14 MANVANTARAS. Each Manvantara is equal to 71 MAHAYUGAS.

These Manvantaras CYCLIC.

The Four Yugas in each MAHAYUGA are LINEAR to that MAHAYUGA. In relation to the next MAHAYUGA they are CYCLIC.

**Here there are two versions of YUGA PRAMANA.**

KRTA YUGA = 17,28,000 years or 1728000/360 = 4,800 years

TRETA YUGA = 12,96,000 years or 12,96,000/360 = 3,600 years

DVAPARA YUGA = 8,64,000 years or 8,64,000/360 = 2,400 years

KALI YUGA is 4,32,000 years or 4,32,000/360 = 1,200years

Here Second Yuga pramanas of Each yuga i.e. 4,800yrs, 3,600yrs, 2,400yrs, 1,200yrs are in DIVYA VARSHAS and not in HUMAN VARSHAS. According to Suryasiddhanta ONE HUMAN YEAR = a DAY for GODS. Such 360 days make a DIVINE YEAR or DIVYA VARSHA. So when the time lengths of KRTA, TRETA, DVAPARA and KALI in HUMAN YEARS are divided by 360 we get the lengths of those YUGAS in DIVYA VARSHAS.

After YUGAS and MAHA YUGAS the 60 years PRABHAVA to AKSHAYA – They are CYCLIC.

The Reason for accepting certain units TIME in CYCLIC scale is for achieving brevity in expression just as the brevity is achieved through using POWERS in ALGEBRA. – 2² , 2¹² and so on. Due to that brevity it is easy to remember.

WHAT CAN BE THIS BRAHMAN? –

Puranas have different kinds of interpretations such as explicit, implied, mystic and so on. Explicitly though the word BRAHMAN refers to the four headed BRAHMAN – The Popular Creater-GOD as per the implied meaning which can be derived from the root verb of BRAHMAN i.e.बृंह् - वर्धने, बृंह् - विस्फोटने

Deriving BRAHMAN from these verbs may help us to bring a comparison between the popular western BIG BANG THEORY and the process of the EMERGENCE of the UNIVERSE from BRAHMAN. The Popular HIRANYA GARBHA SUKTA of RGVEDA has very close resemblance with the western BIG BANG THEORY.



In both these senses – BRAHMAN can be the OMNI PRESENT ENTITY manifested as UNIVERSE. Perhaps for this reason only the Upanishadic Texts say – SARVAM KHALU IDAM BRAHMAN. Accordingly the UNIVERSE is considered to be the phenomenal manifestation of BRAHMAN.

So BRAHMAYU in the Astronomical texts is the AYUSH of the UNIVERSE.

SOME SPECIAL LINEAR ERAS IN INDIAN CALENDAR – on par with the present Christian Era year – 2014.

1. KALPABDA – 1,97,29,49,114 years

2. Srshti Samvat – 1,95,58,85,114 years

3. Vamana Samvat – 1,96,08,89,114 years

4. Sri Rama Samvat – 1,25,69,114 years (in the 17^(th) Treta Yuga the Ramayana took place according to some sources) (out of the fear of time and space I am confining to this extent)

5. Srikrishna Samvat – 5,239 years

6. Yudhisthira Samvat – 114 years (This is from the day of Yudhisthira’s ascending the throne after the Mahabharata War)

7. Bauddha Samvat – 2588 years

8. Sri Shankaracharya’s Samvat – 2293 years

9. Vikrama Samvat – 2072 years

10. Salivahana Saka – 1936 years

For all these TEN calculations textual sources are there. But in the present mail I am confining to this much information only.

With warm regards,
