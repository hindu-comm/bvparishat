Dear Dr.Murty,

The word "Lipta" \[a word of Greek origin\] seems to have been used for denoting the angular measure of "one minute" which is 1/60th part of a 'degree'. "Vilipta" also appears which is 1/60th of Lipta, that is the modern angular (arc) 'second'. It would be interesting if you could kindly provide siddhantic astronomy text reference to 'lipta' as a unit of time. The real Sanskrit word, Lipta carries the meaning of "smeared, anointed,.." and I am unable to relate this meaning with a time measure. Please help.

Thanks

RNI
