That is the theory. In practice, they have books whose copyright is still valid or claimed to be valid. I know of my grandfather's work (copyright owned by the Trust named after him - by the way, the Trust recently received a significant amount from a publisher in return for the rights for the next twenty years) and a book by a Professor who taught me (he is in his 50s, his copyright being very much valid) which are there on DLI. Both these are in Telugu. Even famous works like that of P. V. Kane's History of Dharmasastra - available on DLI - are claimed to be under copyright by their owners, BORI in this case. The definitive English translation of Sankaracarya's commentary on the Brahmasutras by Swami Gambhirananda is also available on DLI - this could be claimed to be under copyright. And, so on.

  

Hence, the need for caution.
