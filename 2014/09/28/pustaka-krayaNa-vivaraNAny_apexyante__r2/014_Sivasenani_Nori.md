Sir

  

I know Shankar-ji has gone a great service over the years with thousands of books; I also know that some of the members have a huge library of e-books. A private collection is different. I would still think that it is not prudent to publicly share links to downloaded books without verifying their copyright status. Specific replies are given in line.

DLI has scanned many books whose copyrights are still valid. The burden of proof does not shift on to copyright-holders; if they sue, DLI would have to pay. So the fact that DLI has decided to scan a book and make it available is no proof that users are free to do whatever they want. DLI may still have some protection because they only display one page at a time (somewhere the terms would or should say that the user agrees to use only part of the book for academic purposes). A book downloaded using the DLI downloader has no such protection available. Distributing such a book by broadcasting a link to the downloaded book in a public domain (which is publicly searchable) is a definite violation, if the copyright is still valid.

There is one more clause I think - for studying or some such thing. Further one can actually distribute copies of up to 10% of the book for academic purposes, if I remember correctly.

While DLI is a great boon especially in fields like Sanskrit, assuming that everything available on DLI is copyright-free is not advisable.
