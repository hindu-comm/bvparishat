No, Sir, I do not have an objection to P. V. Kane's or Swami Gambhirananda's books being on DLI. Nor have I ever said DLI should not be there. What I am saying is entirely different. Just because DLI has a stated policy, it does not mean that all the books in DLI are out of copyright or copyright claim. Such being the case, it is prudent not to broadcast links to downloaded books. One reason why copyright violations are not pursued is that it is difficult to get good evidence and then pursue it through courts. What happens when a download link is broadcast in a group like BVP which can be searched using Google is that all the required evidence is made available in an absolutely tamper-proof way. If any member of BVP or other groups wants a book, all that he or she needs to do is ping the person with the book and they can do privately whatever they want. This is better for all concerned.

  

I also did not say, imply or suggest anything about enforcing our Trust's copyright on my grandfather's works. The only reason why I quoted that was to give a solid example of a book for which copyright is still in force and the book is on DLI. Nor am I an advocate of aggressive copyright enforcement.

  

All that I advocate is prudence.

N. Siva Senani
