Its for the copy write holders to respond about Kane's HOD or Sw. Gambhiranandasbooks. When they have no objections why should you? Are you sure DLI is keeping his books with the copy writers holders objection I don't think so  
  
If you are the copy write holder of your grand fathers book please write to DLI if you want the books to be removed.  
  

One has to draw line between genuine business and academic needs. If the balance is maintained then knowledge can be made accessible to all else it will remain on the dusty racks of some oriental library and over time moths and worms will eat away the books kept there  

  

Know ledge in books especially those contained in Indological and Sanskrit books is not Sidney Sheldon novel or a movie or Pop song which will cause significant revenue loss to publishers if it is kept legally in DLI for preservation and making it accessible to a larger audience. this in turn will make more people read those books and publishers will get benefited as they would have increased their reader ship base.
