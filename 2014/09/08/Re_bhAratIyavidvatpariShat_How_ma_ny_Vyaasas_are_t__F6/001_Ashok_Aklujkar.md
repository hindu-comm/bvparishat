The author of the Yoga-bhaa.sya is no Vyaasa or Veda-vyaasa or K.r.s.na-dvaipaayana Vyaasa. The authorship should really go to Vindhya-vaasa (known as a Saa.mkhya thinker, sometimes also through the synonymous form Vindhya-vaasin).

  

The attribution to Veda-vyaasa in an introductory verse of Vaacaspati-mi;sra's Tattva-vai;saaradii is either a corruption of Vindhya-vaasa in the manuscripts of theTattva-vai;saaradii or a misreading of his manuscript source byVaacaspati-mi;sra (a critical study of the mss of the Tattva-vai;saaradii is needed to determine the specific cause; in any case, the corruption I have suggested is very probable; all it ultimately needs is reading the two syllables dhyavaa as davyaa).

  

In the Nyaaya-vini;[scaya-vivara.na](http://scaya-vivara.na) of Vaadi-raaja-suuri, the Yoga-bhaa.sya is cited as vindhya-vaasino bhaa.syam.Vaadi-raaja-suuri lived about 1025 A.D. He is earlier than K.sema-raaja, a student of Abhinava-gupta, Maadhava, the author of the Sarva-dar;dana-sa.mgraha and Vij;[naana-bhik.su](http://naana-bhik.su), the author of the Yoga-vaarttika, whose attributions resembles the one in the Tattva-vai;saaradii.

  

The fact that the Yoga-bhaa.sya refersto views such as those of the Vainaa;sika, ;Sunya-vaadin, and K.sa.nikavaadin presents no problem when the work is ascribed toVindhya-vaasa. Nor does the absence of Yoga-bhaa.sya as an achievement of a Vyaasa or Veda-vyaasa in the lists of Vyaasas that have so far been presented.

  

I have presented my view of Yoga-bhaa.sya authorship in lectures since 1994. The view has also been reported on p. 40 of the Yoga volume, published in 2008, of the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies (general editor Karl H. Potter, vol XII editors Gerald James Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya).

  

The text of my lecture has not been published so far. I have not finalized it because I was hoping to have the benefit of a critical edition of the Yoga-bhaa.sya or of at least an edition of that work based on a consultation of mss from different parts of India. Dr. Philipp A. Maas has made considerable progress in that direction, but it will be quite some time before I can consult his work in depth.

  

A preliminary study of at least the introductory section of the Tattva-vai;saaradii on the basis of mss from different parts of India will also be helpful. However, I do not know of any scholar working on it, and I am personally occupied with several demanding research projects in widely separated areas of Indology.

  

As I recall, the subject 'how many Vyaasas' has already been discussed to some extent in Bhagavad-datta. 1974-78. *Vaidika Vå:nmaya kå Itihåsa.* 3 vols. (in unexpected reverse chronological order: 1978, 1976 and 1974) out of 5 projected vols. Expander and editor: Satya-;sravå. Naii Dillii: Pra.nava Prakaa;sana. Hindi. Originally published: Vol. 1, Pt. 1: 1927. Vol. I, Pt. 2: 1931. Lahore: Dayananda Anglo-Vedic Studies.
