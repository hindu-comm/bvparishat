Namaste  
  
I have a digital scanned copy of Upasargārthacandrikā and the print/scan quality is not very good (Visargas and Anusvāras are difficult to make out in the scan). Please refer the attached snapshot of pages 186-187 of the second volume (1978 edition).  
  
Under the entry samāgam, I am tracing the citation from Rāmayaṇa which is highlighted in red. Cārudeva Śāstrī Jī gives the citation 4.44.78 but I did not find the verse there.  
  
Any pointers would be helpful.

PS: The citation may be incomplete or a variant reading. For example the citation just before the highlighted one reads क्व नु वयं तं नरं समागच्छेम यो नस्तद्रूपमापादयेत्पुनः. The complete verse is actually क्व नु नाम वयं सर्वाः कालेनाल्पेन तं नरम्। समागच्छेम यो नस्तद्रूपमापादयेत्पुनः॥ (म॰भा॰ १.२१७.१३)
