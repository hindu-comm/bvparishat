namo vidvadbhya:

As Sri Mishraji has pointed out, it is best to consult someone who knows the subject as there are many books available.

I am attaching a small articlee on Upasana by my late father Dr NS Anantharangacharya. Its a review version and there could be some typos.

Also, my father's thesis 'The Philosophy of Sadhana in Vishishtadvaita' would give you a lot of useful info and also ref works. You may contact me

separately if you need a copy and I can courier it to you. You can reach me on [9845012325](tel:(984)%20501-2325).
