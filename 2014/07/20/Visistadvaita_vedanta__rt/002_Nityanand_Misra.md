Out of curiosity, did you choose the topic yourself or was it recommended by somebody? If you chose it yourself, should not the availability of books and published material be researched before choosing the topic? If recommended by somebody, could you please check with them first on sources on the topic?

As mentioned in नारद भक्ति सूत्र’s second and third aphorisms, भक्ति/उपासना as per Bhagavān Ramanujācārya is of two types साधन/उपाय and परा/परम – you will get much more information if you go through secondary and primary sources.

Śrībhāṣyam being a phenomenal 900-year old masterpiece, there is no dearth of secondary literature available. You may want to start with a literature survey of secondary sources – books, dissertations, articles, commentaries, etc on the Śrībhāṣyam/Viśiṣtādvaita, and see what topics these secondary sources cover. You may have already referred A History of Indian Philosophy by Surendranath Dasgupta and A History of Early Vedant Philosophy by Hajime Nakamura, if not please do. Both these works would point you to other numerous references. While there would be enough secondary sources in English and Sanskrit, a lot more sources presumably will be in Tamil. Some Hindi sources, e.g. Chandra Dhar Sharma’s भारतीय दर्शन: आलोचन और अनुशीलन Harendra Prasad Sinha’s भारतीय दर्शन की रूपरेखा and others might also be helpful.

The other approach is to look up in the primary source. If you have not read the full Śrībhāṣyam, you may want to get a Unicode/IAST (i.e. searchable) copy of the work. You may then locate occurrences of words like भक्ति/उपासना/ज्ञान/साधन/साधना et cetera in the Śrībhāṣyam and study the contexts, commentaries, sub-commentaries et cetera.
