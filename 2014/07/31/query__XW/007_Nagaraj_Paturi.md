"The story here is that the Buddhist use of the Sanskrit word sūtra is based on the mistaken notion that the Prakrit (especially Pāli) word sutta derives from the Sanskrit word sūtra. This is understandable since Pāli resolves almost all conjunct consonants to double consonants. But if you ever look at a sūtra you can easily see that they are an entirely different genre of texts, with more in common with abhidhamma style texts - they are terse, almost like bullet points. There is none of the narrative style of the Buddhist sūtras. It is far more likely that sutta derives from another Sanskrit word, sūkta".



-------------- ṭhe blogger is not denying that the word sūtra is in widespread use as a synonym of 'sutta'. He is disagreeing with those who are using it as such. He feels, " It is far more likely that sutta derives from another Sanskrit word, sūkta. "



His argument in support of his sūkta--> sutta and sūtra-/->sutta hypothesis is that sūtra is ' terse, almost like bullet points.' and
'There is none of the narrative style of the Buddhist sūtras.' (Note his own use of the word sūtra in this context).



Though he gives the su+ukta etymology he is not taking the yougika meaning here. Because he says, "Sūkta is a name for the verses of the Vedas and it seems likely that this is another case of conscious imitation of Brahmins by Buddhists " sūkta as a vēda mantra is being used in a rūḍhārtha not yougika.



He calls sūtra bhuddhist usage only since he says, "So the use sūtra by Buddhists derives from the early Prakrit traditions"



I was only pointing to the widespread use of the word sūtra as a synonym of sutta by Buddhists themselves.



Blogger is hypothesizinga derivation. I am speaking about widespread usage.
