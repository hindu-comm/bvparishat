Dear scholars  
I would like to know 1)is there any definition(laksana) of Sutta in Buddhist tradition just as the sutra-laksana is provided as:  
alpākṣaraṃ asandigdhaṃ sāravad viśvatomukham  
astobhaṃ anavadyaṃ ca sūtram sūtravido viduḥ//  
  
2) whether the word 'sutta'(sans. Sutra) can be derived from  
'sukti" (su+ukti)  
Su+ukta= sukta  
and therefore, 'sutta'  
Is this possible?
