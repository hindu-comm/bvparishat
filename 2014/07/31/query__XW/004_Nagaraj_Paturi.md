You are absolutely right about the the grammatical possibility. Among these two derivations, one is progressive assimilation the other is regressive assimilation. In pali itself, examples for both these phonetic changesin relation toSanskrit are to be seen.Butin all the names of theBuddhist suttas the word sutta has been derived as sutra\<\> sutta only. At many places scholarsused the word 'sutra' asthe synonym of 'sutta'.



There probably are some Buddhist Suttas where the word Sutta is derived from the Sanskrit Sukta. I have yet to see an example.

Nagaraj
