Dear Dr. Madhu Kapoor,



You yourself mentioned '(sans. Sutra)' beside the word 'Sutta'

.

What makes you bring the other etymologies into discussion ? Is it because some of the suttas concern moral principles?



But Sutta \< \>Sutra is the way thisPali word is used.



But alpākṣaraṃ asandigdhaṃ etc. is applicable only the sutras of Vedic literature. Sutta \< \>Sutra of Buddhist literature does not even have a structural similarity. Suttas are abundantly available online. Please go through. You will be able to see for yourself.



Regards,



Nagaraj
