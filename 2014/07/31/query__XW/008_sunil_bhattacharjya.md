Was there any gradual evolutionary change in the words "Sutra / Sukta'
starting from the pre-Buddha times (when Vedic Sanskrit alone prevailed), to the times of Buddha when Buddhist literature was in the Shuddha -Magadhi or Pali, to the times of Ashvaghosha and Nagarjuna, when the Mahayana Buddhist literature came to be written in Buddhist-Hybrid Sanskrit, to the times of Panini, when the classical Sanskrit started.
