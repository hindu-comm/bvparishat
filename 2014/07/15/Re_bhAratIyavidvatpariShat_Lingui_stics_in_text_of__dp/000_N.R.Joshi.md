Dear Dr. Jasra Prasad and BVP scholars,



I apologize for my error in typing the word.



It is Prasamshita\`Vaakya in 8th chapter of Vimaana sthaana of Carakasamhitaa.



Is the root in Vimaana "maa = to measure?"



'विशेषेण मीयते ज्ञायते दोष विशेषाद्यनेनेति विमानम्...' - It is called Vimana, by which one gets acquainted with details on the doshas.



Does it mean Diagnostics in modern medicine?



But then how does this meaning fit to the meaning of aeroplane as in Pushpaka Vimaana of Ramayana and the top (Vimaana) of the tall tower of temple or building?



Please help us to understand intricasies of our Sanskrit Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

My initial search to find 'प्रशंस्त/प्रशंसा वाक्यम्' did not yield any result. You may please write either in diacritic roman, ITRANS or Devanagari.

As we know, it is the third sthana among the eight sthanas of Caraka Samhita. Chakrapani Datta, the able commentator, describes Vimana as - 'विशेषेण मीयते ज्ञायते दोष विशेषाद्यनेनेति विमानम्...' - It is called Vimana, by which one gets acquainted with details on the doshas (three humors), drugs etc. Information from this sthana proves its utility to initiate any treatment further.



With regards,

Prasad
