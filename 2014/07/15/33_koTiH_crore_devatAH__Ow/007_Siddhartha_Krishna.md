Dear Shital ji,

Namaste,

As per the Rig Veda Samhita the accepted number of the Devas is thirty-three - तान्रोहिदश्व गिर्वणस्त्रयस्त्रिंशतमा वह (ऋ० १.४५.२) i.e. “Lord of Red Courses (Agni), propitiated by our praises, bring hither the thirty-three divinities.” Similar quotations include: ये त्रिंशति त्रयस्परो देवासो बर्हिरासदन् (८.२८.१) “May the thirty-three Devas sit down upon the sacred grass.” इति स्तुतासो असथा रिशादसो ये स्थ त्रयश्च त्रिंशच्च।मनोर्देवा यज्ञियासः (८.३०.२) “Destroyers of foes, the Devas adored by humans are thirty-three and are thus praised.”

The Rig Veda itself provides no clarification on the names of the ones which are to be included in the thirty-three gods. However, Aitariya Brahmana, which also is part of the Rig Veda, there two distinct groups of thirty-three Devas: “त्रयस्त्रिंशद्वै देवाः सोमपास्त्रयस्त्रिंशदसोमपाः – अष्टौ वसव एकादश रुद्रा द्वादशादित्याः प्रजापतिश्च वषट्कारश्चैते देवाः सोमपाः; एकादश प्रयाजा एकादशानुयाजा एकादशोपयाजा एतेऽसोमपाः” (ऐ०ब्रा० २.१८) i.e. there are two classes of the thirty-three Devas, the first class consists of the Somapas, drinkers of Soma, and the other who are to be propitiated by oblations of Ghrita, not by libations of Soma. The second class, evidently, is little else than personifications of sacrifices. 

A similar list is provided by Maharshi Yajnavalkya to Vidagdha Shakalya in Shukla Yajur Veda Shatapatha Brahmana/Brihadaranyaka Upanisad (3.9.2): अष्टौ वसव एकादश रुद्रा द्वादशादित्यास्त एकत्रिंशदिन्द्रश्चैव प्रजापतिश्च त्रयस्त्रिंशाविति – “The eight Vasus, the Eleven Rudras, and the twelve Adityas, these are thirty one. Indra and Prajapati make up thirty-three.” Then he provides their names:

*8 Vasus*

कतमे वसव इत्यग्निश्च पृथिवी च वायुश्चान्तरिक्षं चादित्यश्च द्यौश्च चन्द्रमाश्च नक्षत्राणि चैते वसव एतेषु हीदं सर्वं हितमिति तस्माद्वसव इति (बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद् ३.९.३) “Which are the Vasus? Fire, earth, air, sky, sun, heaven (abode of light), moon, stars: These are the Vasus for in them all this is placed, therefore, they are called Vasus.” Acarya Shankara explains, “The Vasus transform themselves into bodies and organs of all beings which serve as the support for their work and its fruition as also into their dwelling places. They help other beings to live and they themselves live. Because they help others to live they are called Vasus.” Please note that the word is derived from the root “vas” which means to live or to dwell. How these Devas are related to the body can be found clearly expressed in any Vedanta Prakarana Grantha.

*11 Rudras*

The 11 Rudras stand for the 5 Jnanendriyas, 5 Karmendriyas and the mind: कतमे रुद्रा इति दशेमे पुरुषे प्राणा आत्मैकादशस्ते यदास्माच्छरीरान्मर्त्यादुत्क्रामन्त्यथ रोदयन्ति तद्यद्रोदयन्ति तस्माद्रुद्रा इति॥बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद् ३.९.४॥ “Which are the Rudras? These ten breaths in a person with the mind as the eleventh. When they depart from this mortal body, they make us, his relatives, weep. So, because they make us weep, therefore they are called Rudras.” Please note that the word “rudra” is derived from the root “rud” which means to weep.

*12 Adityas*

The sun in a year’s 12 months: कतम आदित्या इति द्वादश वै मासाः संवत्सरस्यैत आदित्या एते हीदं सर्वमाददाना यन्ति ते यदिदं सर्वमाददाना यन्ति तस्मादादित्या इति॥३.९.५॥ “Which are the Adityas? Verily, the twelve months of the year, these are the Adityas, for they move carrying along all this. Since they move carrying along all this, therefore they are called Adityas.”

In other words, the 8 Vasus are related to the space dimension of the universal Samashti/Virat Purusha (collective being), the 12 Adityas are related to time dimension of the Universal Samashti/Virat Purusha, and the 11 Rudras are related to the Vyashti Purusha (individual being).

Indra is explained as “thunderbolt” and Prajapati is explained as “animals.” See 3.9.6

Ultimately, all these 33 Devas are nothing but manifestations of One Supreme Life force known as Brahman, as Maharshi Yajnavalkya clearly points out in his concluding remarks: कतम एको देव इति प्राण इति स ब्रह्म त्यदित्याचक्षते (बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद् ३.९.९) “Which is the one Deva? Prana. He is Brahman. They call him ‘tyat’ – That.”

Here I must add that according to the masters of the Nirukta, one of the 6 limbs (angas) of the Veda, there are only 3 fundamental Devas in the Vedas: Agni on the earth, Indra in the intermediate regions and Surya in the heaven, i.e. Light in three regions. All Devas are seen manifestations of these 3 Devas only. Finally, even these three Devas are also seen as manifestations of the Supreme Light, Atman, the Self.

Now, let me come to your question: What are 33 Koti Devas?

First let me point out to the following statement by Maharshi Yajnavalkya: कतमे ते त्रयश्च त्री च शता त्रयश्च त्री च सहस्रा इति, स होवाच महिमान एवैषामेते त्रयस्त्रिंशत्त्वेव देवा इति (बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद् ३.९.१-२) “Which are those three hundred and three and three thousand and three Devas which are heard in the Nivid (group of Mantras giving the number of the Devas which are recited in the hymns of praise to the Vishve-Devas – All-Devas)? To this Yajnavalkya said, They are but the manifestations of them, but there are ONLY thirty-three Devas.”

Based on this statement, we can say that the same stands for 33 Koti. Also, in Sanskrit, bigger numbers, such as सहस्र कोटि etc. denote “infinity,” as is stated by many Sanskrit commentators on Mantras like सहस्रशीर्षा पुरुषः सहस्राक्षः सहस्रपात् etc. This is in line of the well-known Vedic statements: अनन्ता विश्वे देवाः (शुक्लयजुर्वेद शतपथ ब्राह्मण १४.६.१/२.११) “All Devas are infinite.” It is also logical. Agni, for example, is the Deva of Fire. In other words it stands for the Consciousness that resides within fire. We can call this अभिमानिदेव or उपहित-चैतन्य to use the Vedantic terminology. But how many manifestations can you have of Agni? The answer is obvious… Infinite. In this sense Devas are “Koti.”

This is the Vedic position on the 33 Devas.

Finally, a word of caution from a Vaidika: “Never make the mistake of mixing up the highly extolled Devas of the sacred Vedas and that of lower importance mentioned in the mythological stories of the Puranas (or even in the Brahmana texts). Otherwise one will always remain confused." Don't misunderstand this to be a word of caution from an Arya-samaji scholar, as many might suspect, but it is based on a saying of no one else then Madhavaracharya (1296-1386?) himself, who was a great authority on the Vedas(as is clear from his books on Mimamsa), who inspired his younger brother Sayanacharya to write a commentary on all the Vedas and was the master-mind behind the great Hindu Vijaynagar Empire, and finally, who, under the name of Vidyaranya Muni, became the 12^(th) Shankaracharya of Shringeri Peetha and was one of the greatest scholars of the Advaita Vedanta Tradition: त्रयस्त्रिंशद्देवेषु श्रुता वस्वादयः पुराणप्रसिद्धेभ्यो वस्वादिभ्योऽन्ये॥पराशर धर्म संहिता माधवभाष्यम् vol. १, p. २०८॥ In the Vedic scriptures Devas are seen as mere manifestations of the One Supreme Existence (Sat): “Some call it Indra, other Mitra, Varuna, Agni, or Garutman with beautiful wings who resides in the heaven. The Existence is One, but the wise express it in numerous ways. Some call it Agni, Yama or Matarishva.” (Rig Veda 1.164.64) Ultimately, it is एकमेवाद्वितीयम् – ONE ONLY, DEVOID OF TWO. But why then do we need all these Devas? For tat-tvam-padartha-shodhana. But this is another story, so let me leave it for now. Hari Om.
