Yes, that is what I wanted to share, but was not sure if that can come in this thread. According to Apastambha . Shudras can prepare food for the brahmins only if the cooking is supervised by a brahmin. A brahmin has to be in charge of the cooking and has to take the role of the chief cook and its implications are obvious. This ensures the use of not only the sattvik food ingredients, it also ensures the cleanliness levels appropriate to the brahmins.
