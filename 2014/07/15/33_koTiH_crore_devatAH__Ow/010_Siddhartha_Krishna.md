For some reason I'm unable to post my answer to the questions raised in the thread started by me about a Brahmana being a cook. So, I'm posting my detailed analysis here. Respected Moderators may inform me what to do in this case. Thank you.

> Artha Shastra is of no help other than it mentions (see 1.19.23) > Mahanashika (chief cook) between a chikitsaka (physician) and > mauhurtika (astrologer), which are clearly both occupations of a > Brahmana. But then on the other hand it mentions an “araalika” (cook) > along with persons occupied with professions that we would generally > ascribe to the Shudras, such as snapaka (procurer of water for > bathing), Astaraka (spreader of bed), kalpaka (barber) and prasaadhaka > (toilet maker) etc. see Artha Shastra 1.12.9.
