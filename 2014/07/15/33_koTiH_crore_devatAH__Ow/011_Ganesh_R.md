Dear Scholars,  
  

I have seen in the aapastaMbasUtra-s that SUdra-s, under the supervision of BraahmaNa-s, can even prepare food for shraadddha-s. Even in Gautama-dharmasUtra-s, it is stated that a brahmachaarin or a saMnyaasin can have their food(bhikShaa) from shUdra-s.  
  
As I am out of my country, now it is not possible for me to provide the exact references and hence beg my pardon.  
  

regards  
  

ganesh
