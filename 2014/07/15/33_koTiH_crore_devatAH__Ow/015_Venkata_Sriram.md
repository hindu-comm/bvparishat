Namaste,



Sorry for posting in wrong thread but i am replying to Ganesh's mail.



The Apastamba sUtra says as you mentioned:



parOkshaM annaM samskrutaM agnAv adhisrityAdibhiH prOkshEt

tad dEva pavitraM iti AchakshatE



The shudras can cook the food under the supervisions of a brAhmaNa.
When the cooking is over by a shudra, the brAhmaNa who was supervising should place the food on the fire and sprinkle with water. Only then it becomes pure and fit to be offered as vaishwadEva.



However, there are rules & regulations given to a shudra as a part of his conduct like trimming of nails, beard, moustache on the 8th day of every paksha; they should bath having their dhoti & anga-vastra on and should cook the food only with those clothes on their body.



Long back, i discussed this aspect of shudra-cooking before my guruji and he too approved this. He said that after the main cooking is over, the shudra steps back and the final touches like adding spices mixed with oil (in telugu we say "popu veyyadam") is done by officiating brahmin which is fit to be consumed by brahmins.



regs,

sriram
