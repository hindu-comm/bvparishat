Thanks Siddhartha Krishna Ji for the elucidating reply.  
  
I have read that Akṣapāda Gautama accepted the Devatās to be 33 crore in number. I do not have the exact source with me now, maybe scholars on the list may help with this.  
  
Purāṇic sources like Vāyu Purāṇa do seem to interpret Koṭi as crore. For example  
  
त्रयस्त्रिंशद्देवतानां ताः कोट्यो विमलात्मिकाः  
पाशेनाग्निबलेनाऽशु बद्धाः सिंहबलेन च  
Vā Pu 30.160  
  
Also see Vā Pu 61.138, and the entry for Devatā in the work Paurāṇika Kośa of Rāṇāprasāda Śarmā.
