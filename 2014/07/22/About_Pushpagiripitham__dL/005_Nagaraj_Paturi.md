"That said, my apologies to those who felt that I had given way to acrimony and harsh language. It was unintentional from my side".



 - I for one, did not feel that you gave way to acrimony and harsh language.



For that matter, as one of the contributors to the thread, I too have to apologise for any inadvertent harshness on my part.



But on my part, as a reader of this thread , I was inspired to go through abig number of great books, learnt new concepts, new ways of



looking at things, new methods of reasoning and so on. Sometimes,debates ontopics about which people have strong feelings,



generate some heat along with a great amount of light. Your expressionindicatesa scholarly self-moderation that can go a long way



inkeeping the conversations within certain healthy limits. I do not think any one on any side of the argument in this thread has any



personal ill-feeling.āgraha and abhinivēśa for a certain side of the argument is natural and nice. Respectfully differing with the other side



is a hallmark of sanskritatva. I shall continue to strive to keep it in me.



sudhīvidhēyah,



Nāgarājah
