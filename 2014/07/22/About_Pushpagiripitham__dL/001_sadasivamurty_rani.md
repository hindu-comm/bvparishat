Respected scholars,

Pranams to all..!

In the ongoing discussion on Pushpagiri Pitham it is taking lots of twists sometimes going to an extent of using language not required in this forum of high esteem as observed by Sri BVK Sastry garu and other scholars.

The discussion at its beginning was about the origin of Pushpagiri Pitham. But later the scholar who rouse his voice against Pushpagiri Pitham has never continued to speak about that Pushpagiri Pitham but the discussion further deviated from its root and taken many turns and twists proceeding with a shower of questions and condemning statements concentrating on two topics:

1. About the Matha System of Sankara Advaita Tradition and 2. About The writings of Advaita Tradition calling them hagiography.

In the process of refuting the arguments on the side of Sankara Advaita the thread has gone to such a height even to deny the validity of the writings of Vidyaranya and scholars of his rank. IF we go on refuting even the writings of such saints and scholars we shall be left with the theories resulted from the foreign pursuits which are basically tertiary by nature.

HENCE ON THESE TWO TOPICS AND A FEW OF THE OTHER ASPECTS I WOULD LIKE PRESENT MY OBSERVATIONS FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE SCHOLARS.

1. MATHAMS and SANYASA SYSTEM

In the Indian traditional - tetragonal social system of Ashrams - Sanyasa Ashrama is honored with a high regard.काषाय दण्डमात्रेण यति: पूज्यो न संशय: is the general notion of respect of all walks of life.

Parivrajaka or Parmahamsa or Hamsa or Avadhuta or even any other kind of monk is adorable to the society.

Whether it is in Advaita system or Dvaita system or Visishta Advaitha system or even in any other system a Sanyasi is considered as an Acharya as we call them Sankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya or Nimbarka Acharya.

  

All these systems have with great faith accepted the principles found in our Indian Tradition laid down for a Sanyasin. In the beginning A Sanyasin was a Parivrajaka. But later keeping in view of the social necessity Institutionalization was given its due importance.

Here in this context I quote a few citations from Pancha Tantra Text of Vishnu Sarma about Matha System:

अस्ति दाक्षिणात्ये जनपदे महिलारोप्यं नाम नगरम्। तस्य नातिदूरे मठायतनं भगवत: श्रीमहादेवस्य। तत्र च ताम्रचूडो नाम परिव्राजक: प्रतिवसति। स च नगरे भिक्षाटनं कृत्वा प्राणयात्रां समाचरति। भिक्षाशेषं च तत्रैव भिक्षापात्रे निधाय तद्भिक्षापात्रं नागदन्ते अवलम्ब्य पश्चाद्रात्रौ स्वपिति।......(तस्य समीपं तस्य सुहृत् अन्य: कश्चन परिव्राजक: समागत:। तस्मिऩ् मन्दादरं मूषकेभ्य: भिक्षारक्षणतत्परं ताम्रचूडं दृष्ट्वा क्रोधाविष्ट: सुहृत्) - ....भोस्ताम्रचूड! मया सह साह्लादं न जल्पसि। तद्रात्रावेव त्वदीयं मठं त्यक्त्वान्यत्र मठे यास्यामि।  

Here the following conclusions can be drawn.

1. By the time of writing Pancha Tantra Text (Its time is known to the scholars) or in the times before the Pancha Tantra - The Matha System was existing. Parivrajakas were the owners of those Mathas. They were not prohibited by the then social system to stay for a longer span of time.

2. They used to stay there on permanent basis and not for a temporary span.

3. There must have been several such Mathas : Hence the friend of the parivrajaka says:तद्रात्रावेव त्वदीयं मठं त्यक्त्वान्यत्र मठे यास्यामि।

Here interestingly the friend says:

नैतद्वेत्सि यत्त्वया मठाश्रयव्याजेन नरकोपार्जनं कृतम्। उक्तं च -

नरकाय मतिस्ते चेत्पौरोहित्यं समाचर।

वर्षं यावत्किमन्येन मठचिन्तां दिनत्रयम्॥

So though parivrajakas were possessing ownership over Mathas such act must have been prohibited in Dharma Sastras of those times.

  

Hence from this story it can be inferred that Possessing of Mathas was common in ancient days for Parivrajakas and that tradition was accepted by The Monks of Sankara Advaita tradition also as the monks of other systems too did so.

  

If we keenly observe Institutionalization of Snayasa tradition through Mathams or Pithams seems to be a social and historical necessity.

MONKS HAVE TWO DUTIES: 1. ATTAINING SALVATION THROUGH SELF REALIZATION 2. UPLIFTING THE WORLD FROM MISERIES THROUGH THEIR TEACHINGS.

शान्तामहान्तो निवसन्ति सन्त:

वसन्तवल्लोकहितं चरन्त:।

तीर्णास्स्वयं भीमभवार्णवं जनान्

अहेतुनाऽन्यानपि तारयन्त:॥ - Vivekacudamani of Sankara Bhagavatpada

In the process of uplifting the Mandadhikarins and Madhyamadhikarins the Advaita System accepted the role of Bhakti also sayingमोक्षसाधनसामग्र्यां भक्तिरेव गरीयसी\|

For this sake Advaita accepts the deities like : Shakti, Vishnu, Shiva and others as various phenomenal aspects of Saguna Brahma. Till one attains the knowledge of Nirguna Brahma Tattva worshiping these deities seeking their favor to bestow The Knowledge of Moksha upon the sadhaka is preferred than living being bound by the snares of the world.

Hence to instruct the general public towards the Vedantic teachings the mathas were developed.

2. NOW ABOUT THE WRITINGS OF ADVAITA TRADITION:

I shall take another opportunity to deal with the Status and validity of the Hagiographies in Sankara Advaita tradition. But I reiterate the aspect of prohibitions and recommendations of Advaita Tradition regarding the Matha Vasa or about the prolonged stay of the Monks in a particular place for a longer time:

The following are the 8 instances prohibiting and recommending the stay of Sanyasins in a same place for a longer time:

  

१. पिता मता स्वसा भ्राता स्नुषा जाया सुतस्तथा।

ज्ञातिबन्धुसुहृद्वर्ग: दुहिता तत्सुतादय:॥

यस्मिऩ् देशे वस्न्त्येते न त्र दिवसं वसेत्॥

शान्तामहान्तो निवसन्ति सन्त:

वसन्तवल्लोकहितं चरन्त:।

तीर्णास्स्वयं भीमभवार्णवं जनान्

अहेतुनाऽन्यानपि तारयन्त:॥

These citations are taken from PARAMAHAMSA DHARMA NIRNAYA OF SRI RAMANANDA SVAMIN. It is surely not a hagiography. It is a Dharma Sastra Writing consolidating the ancient views of Dharma Sastras and Upanishads regarding the Dharmas to be followed by Parmahamasas.

  

I welcome the valuable comments of Dr. GANESHAN regarding his PARTICULAR DENIAL of PUSHPAGIRI PITHAM Authenticity with the Inscriptions and Monumental references which he possessed instead of generalizing the subject.  

Warm Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
