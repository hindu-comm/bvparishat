Sunilji, there is no need to speculate one way or the other, with probably-s and maybe-s.  
  
There are many sociological studies available, with varying levels of detail in them. With respect to the ground realities of saMnyAsin-s, maTha-s and ASrama-s in India, the books written by Ghurye, Jadunath Sarkar and Sadananda Giri come to mind.  
  
With respect to the theoretical prescriptions, P V Kane's volumes on the dharmaSAstra are an invaluable resource. In particular, see chapter 28 of Vol II in his History of Dharmasastra. One may also consult the numerous upanishat texts collected together as Sannyasa Upanishads (Paul Deussen's classification), the yatidharmaprakASa of vAsudevASrama, the yatidharmanirNaya of viSveSvarasarasvatI and the more recent compilation of yati dharma regulations by SrI rAmAnanda sarasvatI that Prof. Rani has mentioned in this discussion.  
  
There is abundant material in these sources to draw definitive conclusions about the history and evolution of how saMnyAsa ASrama dharma has been observed and preserved over the centuries, within the Sankaran tradition.  
  
That said, my apologies to those who felt that I had given way to acrimony and harsh language. It was unintentional from my side.  
  
Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
