Namaste

  

1\. The noting of Rani Sadashivamurthy and Sunil Bhattacharya has brought up some important points that one must consider in addressing the valid issues raised by Dr. Ganeshan from Tamil Saiva perspective. If one strips the language adjective, tamil Saiva in its roots and essence is same as vedic tradition. ( i am aware that some die- hard tamil historians demanding greater antiquity for tamil/ seeking Sanskrit as a derivative of Tamil would not relish this statement). All that these scholars need to do is to revisit the original sources of tamil and vedic saiva, as documented in aagama works, without prejudice.

  

The technical difference between three Sanskrit words may help to resolve many doubts here. The three key words are: mAThAdhipatya (- head of a traditional knowledge education system, a social institution), PIThAdhipatya ( - master of a Shaastra school of interpretation, a continuance of masters tradition, not loaded with societal devotee interruptions for social issues-resolution: a shaastra adhyayana adhyaapana - saadhanaa- upaasanaa center:  and Sannyasa (- of several orders and life style choices, sampradayas/ a post vana- prastha phase generally for a moksha sadhanaa.

All these have a common dress code of Saffron. But the guiding and binding rules are different!

It is like the sacred thread yajnopavita, worn by the three varnas commonly(?) which binds the wearer to different level of commitment to dharma- ashrama- vyavahara rules and level of compliance.

  

What we seem to have at present Shankara- maThas is really a PITHAdhipati technicality. What many other maTHa's have are maTHDhipati. The real Sannyasi is totally obscure and absent in modern institutional context.

  

In public media and politically charged environment, what is being expected of PIThAdhipati by society is the role- play of a ' Dharmaadhikaari'- an administrator of community resources and traditions as a CEO of a religion corporate on the model of a Church.

  

In this sense, the portrayal of history of several Sannyasa traditions in books of philosophy ( so profusely and authoritatively quoted) show the lack of clarity on the dynamics clearly indicated in the meaning of Samskrutham technical terms: maTha and PITha , sannyasa as an Ashrama- dharma and sannyasi as a societal professional - scholar- master of a tradition.

  

The observed social aberrations in practice should not be used to make a charge on lack of clarity on part of tradition in providing proper guidelines .

  

Here are my submissions and additional notes in relation to this.

  

Sannyasa is an ancient tradition under vedic varna- ashrama frame of social lifestyle indexed with spirituality. In this backdrop, Dharma-Shastras and Artha- Shastra texts have clear guidelines on the social and spiritual role plays of Sannyasi.

  

This clarity of thought and backdrop goes prior to the congregational models of Sangha/ vihara/ chaitya-aayatana where Sannyasi (?- saffron wearing yogis) lived together under a common community- congregation code.

These congregations were primarily yoga- practicing communities, different from vedic gurukula models and concept of brahmana- agrahara which is yajna performing social communities, leading a gruhastha life style.

  

State/ king- had little say on the internal administration of these institutions. These institutions were knowledge centers; and never became a social power struggle center as an alternate to Kings authority. Chanakyas arthashaastra has clear guidelines on how disputes between such institutions were to be resolved by the king, using the help of a Dharmaadhikaari. Patronage and kings faith issues are different from institution administration. Buddhist institutions records show how these institutions vied to get financial patronage from state and wealthy patrons.

  

The internal rules of congregations of such Sannyasi- saffron wearing yogis is the technicality of a ' maTha'.

Over a historic timeline, good practices of different congregations must have shaped the new formats and roles of several orders of Sannyasa- yoga practitioners and maTha's ; all having a common dress code of Saffron! The dashanami - sannyasi's of different akhadas have a different rulebook and life style compared to the ' pure vedanta oriented resident sannyasi ' model institutions.

  

This is common across all sections - be it saiva- vaishnava- bauddha- jaina et al. virakt- matha model of Saiva sannyasi would play a different social role compared to a jangama or veeramaheswara model. Gorakh nath panthis would follow different model from the bhairava -
bhairavi models. Yet all of them swear by Dharma.

  

Ignoring all these internal factors of ' sannyasi by saffron clothe+ institution - congregation living' ; and going to draw a caricature of
maTha history would be like using the logic -' every animal with a tail is a monkey'! to describe the entire animal kingdom.

This basic flaw is due to inaccurate translation of technical Sanskrit terms which uniquely describes different systems of Saffron dress wearing yogi-heads of religious institutions.

  

There has been a social aberrations over last two centuries where Saffron dress is being used as a shopping list item by several brand institutions and people claiming the title of Sannyasi! The commoditization- promotion of tradition for brand building and pecuniary gains is unchecked by state as well as authorities of tradition! The colonial model of ' Sanskrit studies and translations' have enriched this aberration to spread far and wide in the 21 st century. Technology now, has speeded up this degradation process.

  

It is in this background, the shift in the role play of classical vedic ' sannyasa' for ' moksha goal aspirants' to the ' Social institutions model of maThas' guarding a ' sacred tradition' needs to be understood.

  

This perspective of historicity- dynamics of Sannyasa traditions discharging their loka- sangraha: Social responsibility in the spirit of Ishaavassya upanishat  needs to be properly rewritten and presented by scholars.
