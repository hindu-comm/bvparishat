Respected Sir,

  

The book PARAMAHAMSA DHARMA NIRNAYA as you've pointed out in the comments, it is an abridged/concise form of an original larger text called PARAMAHAMSA DHARMA VIMARSHA. The unabridged version is not readily available for reference or purchase. It will be very kind of you to suggest me a source to acquire this book or seek as reference if possible in its larger form as the 'Dharma Vimarsha' text.

  

Thank you.

  

Regards,

Amit Parmar
