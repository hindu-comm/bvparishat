Dear Scholars  
Charana Vyuha related to Rigveda said to be a composition of Sage Sounaka has interestingly anecdote on Vaalakhilya Mantras.  
While presenting the number of Mantras in Rigveda, it states that this portion is not includes to certain Gotra clans or recension.  
It also gives the regions each Veda Shakhq Adhyayana. Now we can correlate this text with actual practice. It is clearly mentioned that those without Vaalakhilya will have lesser number of Mantras.  
Refer to Rigveda Khanda of Charana Vyuha.  
Shubham.
