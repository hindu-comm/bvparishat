Sir,

Sayana has included valakhilya hymns in his compilation but did not comment on it.In Kerala valakhilya hymns are not being recited.

The Hoshiarpur edition contains the padapatha.The satwalekar edition also contains these hymns.They are included in the 8th mandala

and are not being treated as parisisshtas.Obviously Kerala brahmins would have seprated before valakhilya was added to the main text.

Kindly contribute your valuable suggestions/information on the subject.
