Dear Poduvalji,  

You have put an interesting question but the assumptions made therein may require reformulation. How are we to conclude that 'Sayana has included valakhilya hymns in his compilation'? They occur in the edition, true. But how to conclude that Saaya.na did not regard them as Pari;si.s.tas? As Sontakke reports a commentary was made in Revaanagara sometime and that was inserted in his edition by Sontakke.It is natural to conclude that this need of a commentary was felt after Saya.na's commentary came into being.  

That means their appendix status remained as such even at the time of Saaya.na. Even if they were read by Saaya.na and his sahaadhyaayins, the status had not changed. Inclusion in the main text is not so important as the secondary status.  

This is corroborated by the khilas of the AV;S and other khilas of the RV. The other khilas, eg the kuntaapas have always been kept separate from the Rgveda. They got place in the 20th kaa.n.da of the AV. But this is immaterial as there is no commentary. They are strictly pari;si.s.tas. The vik.rtis of the AV;S as Professor Deshpande personally told me do not include the Kuntaapas. That means tradition has always excluded them from the main body of the canonical redaction, as with the AV so also with the RV.  

As to your specific query about the Kerala Rgvedins -- that they do not recite the Vaalakhilyas means that they follow the authentic tradition. The new one of reading them in the main body is not an authentic one.  

Best
