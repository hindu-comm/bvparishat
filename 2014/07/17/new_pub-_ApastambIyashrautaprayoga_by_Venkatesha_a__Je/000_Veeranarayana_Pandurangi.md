Dear all  
here is a new publication in vedic studies आपस्तम्बीयश्रौतप्रयोग by Bra. Shri. Venkatesha avadhani Published by Shruti Shankara samskrita samshodhana pratisthanam, Mattur, Shivamogga.  

  
This two-volume-work is the volume second of the same title. it deals with महाग्निचयनम् in detail.  

  
The first part deals with many karikas related to agnichayana and there are many detailed chitrapatas of agni. But most interesting part is detailed discussion on the chronology of Apastamba. Editor critically reviewed the views of Richard Garbe (earlier editor of Apastamba shrouta sutra) Vijayapal vidyavaridhi C G Kashikar etc. and finally establishes the antiquity of Apastamba vs Bodhayaya/Baudhayana. Finally first part is finished with a discussion on Shyena.  

  
Second part contains full prayoga of agni. More older shulbakarikas and many details of agnichiti.  

all the karikas edited are based on palm leaves used and corrected by many generations of agnihotrins.   

  
This present work, based on the authentic tradition, along with Vol 1 published earlier add greatly to the scholarship on Vedic rituals. I hope this will be followed by many other worth publications in future.  

  
This Book can be purchased from Shruti Shankara samskrita samshodhana pratisthanam, Mattur, Shivamogga. phones 08182-237724, 9448836895, email. [shruthi...@yahoo.co.in]()
