Dear Sri Ramanujan ji,

  

Namaste and thank you for your reply. Yes, I required the Bhasya for the 8 slokas starting withयो ब्रह्मा ब्रह्मण..., At the end of the 8 slokas there is one slokaविष्णो त्वं नो अन्तमश्शर्म यच्छ ... Is there any other bhasya available for the above mantras, if Sayanacharya has not commented upon them?

  

Thank you for your reply.
