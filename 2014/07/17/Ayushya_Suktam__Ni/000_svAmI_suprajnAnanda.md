Dear Friends,

  

Namaste.

  

I am searching for the Sayana Bhasya for Ayushya Suktam. I am unable to get the same. How to find out in which Veda the Suktam occurs?

  

When I searched the net, I got the reference that the Suktam belongs to Krishna Yajurveda Samhita (1.3.1.10.3) But, I am unable to reach in any of the books and could not find the Sayana Bhasya for the same too.

  

Thank you in advance.
