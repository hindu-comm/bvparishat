On this occasion I would like to add some information that a Tele-Serial in 33 Weekly Episodes by name SARASWATI - SANATANA PRAVAHINI was telecast by SVBC (Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel). The last episode of this serial ended with yesterday i.e. on 30-06-2014. 

The theme of this serial is to visualize the eight origins of the River Saraswathi with Vedic, Pauranic, Historical, Geographical and Scientific Evidences in different regions of India and also to prove its continuous influence on INDIAN CULTURE through generations through several millenniums.

I am further happy to add that THE THEME AND SCRIPT OF THIS WAS WRITTEN BY ME.

Soon SVBC is going to release this in DVD format to bring it to the reach of public.

Warm Regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
