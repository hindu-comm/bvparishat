The diagram given below might help in visualising what Sri Nagaraj Paturi explained:

the sum of squares of a and b is equal to the sum of square of c.

  

This is part of a discussion on how to construct squares in such a way that the sum of areas of two squares is equal to the area of a third square. The next sutra gives the sides of rectangular triangles (but not the hypotenuses):

  

त्रिकचतुष्कयोर्द्वादशिकपञ्चिकयोः पञ्चदशिकाष्टिकयोः सप्तिकचतुर्विंशिकयोर्द्वादशिकपञ्चत्रिंशिकयोः पञ्चदशिकषट्त्रिंशिकयोरित्येतासूपलब्धिः ॥ ४९ ॥

  

"In (triangles formed with sides of 3 and 4; 12 and 5; 15 and 8; 7 and 24; 12 and 35; and 15 and 36, this (a third square whose area is equal to the sum of areas of two squares) obtains."

  

The hypotenuses in the above cases would be 5, 13, 17, 25, 37 and 39 respectively.

  

A special case of the above is seen in a square, wherein the square of the diagonal is double the square of sides. This is spelt out in sutra 45: समचतुरस्रस्याक्ष्णयारज्जुर्द्विस्तावतीं भूमिं करोति ॥ ४५ ॥ One might notice that term "bhumim" which means area has to be read into sutra 48 (the one which states what is known as the Pythagorean theorem).
