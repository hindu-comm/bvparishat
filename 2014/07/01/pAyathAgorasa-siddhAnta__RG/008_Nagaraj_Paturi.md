Sri Sivasenani Noriji has said as follows anticipating the adhikaara related question :

  

A special case of the above is seen in a square, wherein the square of the diagonal is double the square of sides. This is spelt out in sutra 45: समचतुरस्रस्याक्ष्णयारज्जुर्द्विस्तावतीं भूमिं करोति ॥ ४५ ॥ One might notice that term "bhumim" which means area has to be read into sutra 48 (the one which states what is known as the Pythagorean theorem).  

  

Thanks toSri Sivasenani Noriji, I downloaded the pdf.

  

A snapshot of commentary on the present Sutra i.e., Sutra 48 is attached here.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
