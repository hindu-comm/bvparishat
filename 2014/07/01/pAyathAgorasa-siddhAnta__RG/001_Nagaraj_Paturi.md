"The ropealongside the diagonal of a rectangle (दीर्घचतुरस्रस्याक्ष्णयारज्जुः)creates (करोति)the collective (उभयं)area that is separately (पृथग्पृथक्)created by the (ropes alongside the)horizontal (तिर्यङ्मानी)and vertical (पार्श्वमानी) sides of the rectangle".



The area created by aline segmentis the area of the square which has the line segmentas itsside.



The above sutra can thus be restated as "the square of the diagonal of a rectangle is the sum of the squares of the horizontal and vertical sides of the rectangle".



The diagonal, the horizontal side and the vertical side of arectanglemake the three sides of a right angled triangle , the diagonal of the rectangle making the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle.



Rest is obvious.

Nagaraj
