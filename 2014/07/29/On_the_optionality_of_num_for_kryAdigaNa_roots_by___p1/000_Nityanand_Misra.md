Dear list members

  

I am doing a literature survey on the optionality of the augment num for kryādigaṇa roots by PS 7.1.80 ācchīnadyornum. I am sharing my findings so far, and would like you to suggest any more resources which have covered this topic. As there is disagreement over the topic by current published sources, I would like to go through any other available sources which I may have missed to get a complete picture.

  

Source 1: Puṣpā Dīkṣita’s Aṣṭādhyāyī Sahajabodha Volume III (Third edition, ISBN 978-81-7702-121-4), p 66. Mātājī says that the augment num is optional for all kryādigaṇa roots. Snapshot shows two forms for roots krī and jñā.

  

Source 2: Bṛhaddhāturūpāvalī of T. R. Kṛṣṇācārya (Trivandrum, 1924, pp. 344 to 365): The Ācārya does not list any form with the num for kryādigaṇa. Snapshot from page 346 shows only one form for root krī.

  

Source 3: Kṛdantarūpamālā of Paṇḍita S. Rāmasubrahmaṇya Śāstrī Volume II (Madras, 1966). The author does not list any form with num for kryādigaṇa. Snapshot from page 284 of second volume for root krī attached. Note he does give the two forms nī and ntī wherever in his opinion there is an option.

  

Source 4: Kṛdantarūpasaṁgrahaḥ. Author unknown, probably from Karnataka. The author surprisingly lists only one form with the num (ntī) which appears to be incorrect as शप्श्यनोर्नित्यम् (पा॰सू॰ ७.१.८१) obviously does not apply here.

  

Pointers to any more references here would be helpful. As of now, I feel Puṣpā Dīkṣita’s interpretation is correct (I will reply later with the reasons I have).
