Dear list members  
  

Please see a snapshot of page 80 of first khaṇḍa of Cārudeva Śāstrī's Vyākaraṇacandrodaya (1987 reprint, MLBD, ISBN 9788120825185).  
  

He cites a usage  

  
sā dadarśa nagānnaikān naikāśca saritastathā  
(सा ददर्श नगान्नैकान् नैकाश्च सरितस्तथा)  
  

The source given in the work is Naiṣadha 12.81, but the citation appears to be incorrect. I could not find the verse in the 12th canto of the 1912 Nirnay Sagar Press publication of Naiṣadhīyacaritam, nor in the digital edition hosted by Pandanus e-texts library.  

  

I would be much obliged for any pointers to the source of this citation.
