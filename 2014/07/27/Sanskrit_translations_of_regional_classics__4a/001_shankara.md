Namaste,

  

SN Sriramadesikan (<http://snsriramadesikan.com/>) has translated into Sanskrit, the following Tamil classics. Most of these are available at DLI.  

  

Tirukkural  

Chilappadhikaram (Nupurakavyam)  

Andal's Tiruppavai (Tiruppava Slokaah)

Pattuppattu

Vemanapadya

  

Sukadeva Muni has translated Japji of Guru Nanak into Sanskrit - "Japuji Sahibah"

Mahadev Oka & AV Khasnis have translated Jnanesvari into Sanskrit - Samskrita Jnanesvari and Girvanan Jnanesvari.

  

The following book published by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan on studies related to various states of India provides detailed information on this subject.

Recently when I came across a Sanskrit translation of Tirukkural, I wanted to know about the past research work on Sanskrit translations of regional languageclassics and any thread already in BVP on this topic. ( Any help for search of previous thread topics in BVP?)



Regards,



Nagaraj
