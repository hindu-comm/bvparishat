Dear Sri G Suryaprasad,



Glad to know your interest in educating the school children about Sanskrit.



What is the format of the exhibits? Would you like to display each article as an exhibit or would like to create exhibits such as charts based on the articles?



The topics are highly vast and the number of articles available on each of them also is very big.



Are you looking for some readily/quickly usable stuff, easily convertible into exhibits?



Best wishes,



Regards,



Nagaraj
