Respected acharyas and nagaraj acharya ji, namo vaha.

  

My actual objective in exhibit charts etc., is to showthe school childrenhow sanskrit is a great language. My plan, as you asked,to create exhibits such as charts based on the articles. Though the topics are highly vast, i would like to take gist of article and prepare a chart.

  

Yes acharya ji, even i am looking for some readily/quickly usable stuff, easily convertible into exhibits.

  

  

Respected acharya nagaraj ji, i am very grateful for your response.  

Dhanyavaadaaha.

  

once again i humbly all scholars of this group to help in this regard.

regards.

g suryaprasad.
