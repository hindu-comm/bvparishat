I think the matter is now very serious, let me clarify on the record –

DISCLAIMER

To Whom It May Concern:

I, Nityanand Misra, s/o \[NAME WITHHELD DUE TO PRIVACY REASONS\], do hereby declare that I am not and do not claim to be a reincarnation/co-incarnation of either the [*companion of Caitanya*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nityananda), nor the [*Avadhūta of Ganeshpuri*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagawan_Nityananda), nor the [*Maha Nirvani Akhada’s
Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Nithyananda). Any resemblance of my name to that of actual persons, living or dead \[or liberated/enlightened\], is purely coincidental. I shall not be held accountable for any association whatsoever to the honorifics used for the three persons named above (and any more persons, *mutatis mutandis*,whose name I may coincidentally share) for me in either speech or print and consequently I shall not be liable for any damages resulting from any sort of libelous or slanderous ramifications thereof apropos the persons named above.

Lest there be any doubts on my silence on the matter hitehrto, it may be known that in my limited capacity as a part-time student of the grammar of the Sanskrit language as formulated by one Mr. Pāṇini, s/o Mr. and Mrs. Paṇina and Dākṣi, lived circa 4th century BCE, I have always interpreted the use of the appellation Pūjya for me on this forum via the aphorism PS 3-3-113 *kṛtyalyuṭo bahulam* which allows for the use of the *kṛtya* affix *yat* (which is the affix in the term Pūjya in question here) optionally in the sense of an agent, in addition to the sense of “deserving” as already ordained by PS 3-3-169 *arhe kṛtyatṛcaśca*, thereby giving an optional meaning of the word Pūjya as a “worshipper” in addition to its usual meaning “worthy of being worshipped”. Having understood Pūjya as a “worshipper”, it has never been my intention to misinterpret the term as meaning “worthy of being worshipped” or misappropriate it for any personal benefits.

I hereby certify that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my information. This notice being written in Hong Kong is governed by Hong Kong law and any dispute shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts.

Signed on this day, the twenty eighth of July of the year Two Thousand and Fourteen of the Common Era.

Nityanand Misra
