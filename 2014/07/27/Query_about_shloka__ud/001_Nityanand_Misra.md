Atharvaveda Samhita 3.24.5 has this



शत॑हस्त स॒माह॑र॒ सह॑स्रहस्त॒ सं कि॑र। कृ॒तस्य॑ का॒र्य॒स्य चेह स्फा॒तिं स॒माव॑ह॥ अथर्ववेदसंहितायां ३/२४/५ ॥

I do not knowifthis is different from what you were looking for. Maybe a paraphrase of thisVedic verse. Anyway what isवीतर? Is itवितर by any chance?Also if it is a verse than सहस्रहस्तं च वीतर/वितरhas one syllable too many (eight are expected). Some may say that is fine and can becounted as an Upajati, but in most cases such extra syllables arescribal/printing errors or अपपाठ.

वितर can come from the root वि + तॄ प्लवनतरणयोः (in लोट् मध्यमपुरुष एकवचन).

वि + तॄ as in its use by जयदेव –

वितरसि दिक्षु रणे दिक्पतिकमनीयम्। दशमुखमौलिबलिं रमणीयम्॥ केशव धृतरामशरीर जय जगदीश हरे॥ गी.गो. १.७ ॥
