My initial search to find 'प्रशंस्त/प्रशंसा वाक्यम्' did not yield any result. You may please write either in diacritic roman, ITRANS or Devanagari.

As we know, it is the third sthana among the eight sthanas of Caraka Samhita. Chakrapani Datta, the able commentator, describes Vimana as - 'विशेषेण मीयते ज्ञायते दोष विशेषाद्यनेनेति विमानम्...' - It is called Vimana, by which one gets acquainted with details on the doshas (three humors), drugs etc. Information from this sthana proves its utility to initiate any treatment further.

  

With regards,

Prasad
