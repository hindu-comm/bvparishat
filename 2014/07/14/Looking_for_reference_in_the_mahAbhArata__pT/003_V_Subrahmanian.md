Many thanks for the references. After getting the information that it is in Shanti parva chapter 337 and verse 38 - 40, I looked for a text and found the PDF referred to which is the shanti parva. I scrolled to chapters 335 onwards and looked for the wanted verse without missing any verse. I expected it to be in the vicinity of 337 and looked for the verse in a few chapters after that. Now that I know from your reference that it is in chapter 359 up to which I did not go in my search.  

  

regards
