In the Brahmasutra bhāṣyam of Shankaracārya is this information:  
  
BSB 3.3.32:  
  
अपान्तरतमा नाम वेदाचार्यः पुराणर्षिः विष्णुनियोगात् कलिद्वापरयोः सन्धौ कृष्णद्वैपायनः सम्बभूवेति स्मरन्ति ;  
  

I made a search in this edition of the Mahābhārata, having known from a google search that the name 'apāntaratama' occurs in the 337th Chapter verses 38 to 40, of the Shanti parva:  
  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/mbhK/pdf/mbhK12.pdf>  

  
After a detailed search I could not locate the event/verses. There is indeed the narrative of Shuka's birth, etc. and Vyāsa's name involved there. I request help to locate the above mentioned event/verses in the Mahabharata or any other smṛti.  
  

Warm regards
