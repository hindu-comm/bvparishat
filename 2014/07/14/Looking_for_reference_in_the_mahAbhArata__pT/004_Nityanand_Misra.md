You were looking in the right chapter of the wrong edition. Please keep in mind that the chapter numbers in the North Indian edition, the South Indian edition and the BORI edition may differ by a large number in some cases. The Kumbakonam edition has a lot many more chapters which are not present in the North Indian or BORI edition. If your source refers the chapter number in the North Indian edition and you are searching in the chapter of the same number in the South Indian edition, more often than not you will not find the verse. As it is not always stated which edition of MBh is being referred, best to search digitally (in a Unicode Nagari or IAST version) - takes the least time and effort. Several digital editions are available online.
