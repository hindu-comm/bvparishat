Perhaps you may know if the excellent publications of Rajaram Shastri are still in a condition allowing their xeroxing. They were published in extremely briitle paper in the twenties. The copies I have are not even worth handling, not to speak of scanning. But the Vishveshvaranand Institute is well equipped. You could perhaps write to the Directpr, VBIS&IS or Director VVRI for information on Rajaram's books.
