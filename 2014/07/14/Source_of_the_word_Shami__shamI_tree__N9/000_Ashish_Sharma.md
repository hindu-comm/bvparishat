Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars

Pranaam

  

I am trying to find out different sources of word "Shami/शमी" tree.

Somewhere they have mentioned that Ram did puja ofShami/शमी tree and other place it was mentioned that Pandavas had kept there weapon under the custody ofShami/शमी tree.

It was also mentioned in different blogs thatShami/शमी word have been used in vedas etc even they told that first time, Pururva had used Shami for ignition but I am unable to find all these sources.

So I request you all that if you can tell me the exact source, along with the shloka or mantra/richa and its translation then I will be very much thankful.

  

  

Regards
