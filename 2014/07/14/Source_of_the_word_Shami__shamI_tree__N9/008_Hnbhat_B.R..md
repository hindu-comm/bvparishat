The verse is found on the net on many web pages:

  

शमी शमयते पापम् शमी शत्रुविनाशिनी ।

अर्जुनस्य धनुर्धारीरामस्य प्रियदर्शिनी॥

करिष्यमाणयात्राया यथाकालम् सुखम् मया ।

*तत्र निर्विघ्नकर्त्री त्वं भव* **श्रीरामपूजिता**\|

  

Emphasising on the relation with Rama and Arjuna both. The relation with Arjuna is clear from the Mahabharata context given by Mr.Nityananda. Now the question is specific. The relationship and mention that
**श्रीरामपूजिता\| and its source. May not be in original Ramayana of Valmiki, but some other versopm/**

**  
**

**The second half of the first verse has the following variant:**

**  
**

**शमी शमयते पापं शमी लोहितकण्टका ।**

**धारिण्यर्जुनबाणानां रामस्य प्रियदर्शिनी ॥**

**करिष्यमाणयात्रायां यथाकालं सुखं मया ।**

**तत्र निर्विघ्नकर्त्री त्वं भव श्रीरामपूजिते ॥**

**  
**

**which is grammatically correct reading. Probably this is not from Ramayana verse.**

**  
**

**I could not find the information in the Index of Names and Subjects in ValmikiRamayana. Not it is found on the online versions availble. These Verses are quoted in the pages with Vijayadashami, related with Rama's Vijayayaatraa, according to the web sources.**

**  
**

**Ashish wanted to find the soruce for this information that Shami was worshiped by Srirama on his Vijayayatra as the second verse above seems to convey the idea.**
