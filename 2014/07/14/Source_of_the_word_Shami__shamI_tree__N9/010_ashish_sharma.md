Dear Guruvars

Pranaam

  

I am really thankful to my Guruji H.N Bhat Ji who had put forward a correct query. Now I wish to add more in that query.

Its being told that before conquering Lanka, Ram did Puja of Shami in south India. Some people now worship Shami on vijaydashmi ie the day day when Ram had killed Ravana. Some where it is mentioned that wood of Shami tree being used in making Ram Hut(then what is the point of worshipping Shami by Ram?).

Hence many thoughts from many places.

If you all can guide me that from where I can get the correct detail and from which book? Valmiki Ramayan, Adhyatm Ramayan or in some Puraan?

  

Waiting for reply

  

Regards
