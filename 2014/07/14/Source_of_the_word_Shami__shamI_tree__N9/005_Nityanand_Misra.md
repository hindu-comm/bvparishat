I doubt if this is in the Vālmīkīya Rāmāyaṇa, it may be in some other version. Can you confirm your source?

Refer the Astrasaṁsthāpana chapter of the Virāṭaparva (fourth Parva) of Mahābahratam.



It is the fourth chapter in the Virāṭaparva of the North Indian edition. You can find the original verses about hiding the weapons in the tree and Hindi commentary published by Gita Press here -

In the South Indian (Kumbakonam) edition, this is chapter number seven in the Virāṭaparva. You can read the verses here -

In Kisari Mohan Ganguly's translation, this is the fifth chapter in the Virāṭaparva. You can read the English translation here -

As the scholars have already provided verses with the numbers, please look up any of the available translations you have access to.

Some sources trace this narrative to the Ṛgveda X-95, but I did not find any reference to the tree's name in the hymn X-95.The narrative is present in the Harivaṁśa (see verse 1-26-44 onwards)
