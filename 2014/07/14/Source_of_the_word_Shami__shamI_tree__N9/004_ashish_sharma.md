Dear Guruvars

  

Pranaam

  

Thanks for the help still I need following details:

1\. Shlok/ extract from valmiki ramayana where Ram did Shami puja along with translation.

2\. Shlokas where Pandavas had used Shami Tree for keeping their weapons along with translation.

3\. The mantras/richas told by you, i need translations also.

4\. Mantra where Pururva had used Shami wood for ignition along with translation.

  

If any other detail you can give with proper translation then it will helpful for me.

  

5\. I have heard that their is a correlation between shami and Shani. Is their any classical texts/mantras/shlokas from Puraan etc. for the support?

  

  

I am thankful for your support.

  

Regards
