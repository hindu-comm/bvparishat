Dear Guruvars

Pranaam

  

I heartily thanks to Nityanand Ji and Dipak Ji for their valuable support.

Sh. Nityanand Ji, I have read following shloka on Shami:

शमी शमयते पापम् शमी शत्रुविनाशिनी ।  
अर्जुनस्य धनुर्धारी रामस्य प्रियदर्शिनी ॥

  

This shloka had given me some idea that might be their is some relation between Ram and Shami tree. Might be its not true but if you can give some guidance then it will be helpful.

  

Regards
