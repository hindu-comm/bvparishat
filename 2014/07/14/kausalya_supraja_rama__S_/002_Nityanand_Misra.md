Please excuse typos, and it would habve helped had you asked for an English explanation in the beginning.



The verse is originally from Vālmīkīya Rāmāyaṇa (1.23.2).

kausalyā suprajā rāma pūrvā sandhyā pravartatē  
\[kausalyāsuprajā rāma pūrvā sandhyā pravartatē\]  
uttiṣṭha naraṡārdūla karttavyaṃ daivamāhnikam



The question is whether the usage kausalyā suprajā / kausalyāsuprajā is compounded or uncompounded.



The short answer is that both uncompounded and compounded usages are possible. The former is perfectly explained as a Laukika usage by the Paninian system. The latter can be explained only as an exceptional Laukika usage or as a Vedic usage by the Paninian system.



For the long answer and reasoning, the Prakriyā and grammar of the forms are needed.



To know if the usage is compunded or not, it is necessary to know what is the compound in suprajāḥ.



The options are prādibahuvrīhi or prādikarmadhāraya/prāditatpuruṣa (karmadhāraya being a subset of tatpuruṣa).



\(1\) If taken as prādibahuvrīhi, the decomposition is śobhanā prajā putro yasyāḥ sā suprajāḥ (she whose son is brilliant/distinguished is suprajāḥ). The base form we get is suprajas as follows

su + prajā -> PS 5.4.122 nityamasicprajāmedhayoḥ -> su + prajā + asic -> su + prajā + as -> PS 6.4.148 yaci bham yasyeti ca -> su + praj + as -> suprajas

In the nominative singular we get

suprajas su -> suprajas s -> PS 6.4.14 atvasantasya cādhātoḥ -> suprajās s -> PS 6.1.68 halṅyābbhyo dīrghātsutisyapṛktaṁ hal -> suprajās -> PS 8.2.66 sasajuṣo ruḥ -> suprajāru -> PS 8.3.15 kharavasānayoḥ -> suprajāḥ.

In this prādibahuvrīhi sense of suprajāḥ, the compounded usage kausalyāsuprajāḥ does not make sense, and only the uncompounded usage makes sense. Then the meaning of the uncompounded usage kausalyā suprajāḥ is "Kausalyā is one whose son is brilliant/distinguished" or "Kausalyā is the mother of a distinguished son". Govindarāja explains that the verse in this case would mean

O Rāma, \[because of you\], Kausalyā is (i.e. became) the mother of a distinguished son, the eastern Sandhyā begins, arise, O the lion amongst men, the auspicious daily duties are \[now\] to be performed \[by you\].



\(2\) The other option is to take supraja/suprajā as a prādikarmadhāraya/prāditatpuruṣa. The decomposition is śobhanāḥ cāsau prajā (putraḥ) ceti suprajaḥ. As PS 5.4.122 nityamasicprajāmedhayoḥ does not apply (it is applcable only in case of bahuvrīhi), the base form is supraja and the nominative form is suprajaḥ, meaning a distinguished son.

In this prādikarmadhāraya/prāditatpuruṣa sense of suprajaḥ, the uncompounded usage kausalyā suprajaḥ does not make sense, and only the compounded usage kausalyāsuprajaḥ makes sense. kausalyāsuprajaḥ means the distinguished son of kausalyā.

However this creates a problem, as rāma in the vocative case, so for must be kausalyāsuprajaḥ. The vocative form of kausalyāsuprajaḥ is kausalyāsupraja.

Then the reading must be kausalyāsupraja rāma. And indeed, Śivasahāya in the Śiromaṇi commentary takes the reading kausalyāsupraja rāma. How does one explain the form kausalyāsuprajā rāma if this meaning is taken?

What Govindarāja says is that one can consider asic in suprajāḥ in case of karmadhāraya as an ārṣa usage and then take the elision of the Visarga which changes to 'r' (by PS 8.3.14 ro ri) and elongation of previous vowel by PS 6.3.111 ḍhralope pūrvasya dīrgho'ṇaḥ. This involves making the elision of r by PS 8.3.14 ro ri a siddha (accomplished) operation from the perspective of PS 6.1.114 haśi ca. How? Govindarāja does not explain but my belief is it is the PS 8.2.3 na mu ne where the first word ("na") can be separated to mean that in some cases, 8.2.1 purvatrāsiddham does not apply.

The other option Govindarāja gives is that by PS 7.1.39 supāṁ sulukpūrvasavarṇāccheyāḍāḍyāyājālaḥ (which is again applicable in the case of Vedic usage), there is the elongation of the vowel in kausalyāsupraja to give us kausalyāsuprajā. The elongation can be achieved by either pūrvasavarṇa or by āt substitution of the vocative su.  

Hope that helps.
