There is a vrata called taṭākōddhāravrata ( taṭāka+uddhāra+vrata) mentioned and described in detail in various mahāpurāṇas and upapurāṇas.



I shall get back to you with references soon.



This is part of vratas described by purāṇas such as vr̥kṣārōpaṇavrata (vr̥kṣa+ ārōpaṇa+vrata) and others.



 vrata of purāṇa isequivalent ofyajña of vēda.



Regards,



Nagaraj
