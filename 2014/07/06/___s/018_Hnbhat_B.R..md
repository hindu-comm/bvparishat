Simple comproise would be आ(समन्ताद्)गरः - आगरः = हालाहलः, the highly dangerous venom, तेन सह वर्तते - सागर। सागर is popular meaning. But for अन्योक्ति, all the unnatural meaning would be required, with the same meaning and nothing unnatural. Here it would mean the same thing, whether compounded or vocative. Better vocative from the same word with two different meaning. In the other way, it would take the adjective itself vocative functioning as denoting the ocean, and the सागरगर्जितम् - would mean venemous shouting for the purpose of Anyokti.

Yes. The variant reading has the correct line metrically:

  

*वातोल्लासितकल्लोल* धिक्ते सागर गर्जितम् \|.

यस्य तीरे *तृषाक्रान्तः* पान्थः पृच्छति वापिकाम् \|\|

I too agree the metre would accommodate the femine form वापिकाम्।

  

But the last didn't mean much for me. If it is in masculine, it would taking the meaning: the verb would be related with the first half, as its object, and वापिक would refer to the ocean itself. It is not question at all for that matter. It is just a remark and does not mean any thing in the context. And also even with वापिकाम् it cannot be a direct object, but does in some way,, mean The thirsty passer by asks the pond (sweet water) on the shore of the sea, ignoring it. some more comments may be needed to justify the meaning of पृच्छति in the context.

  

Here is the same verse with the first पाद changed as above, in a Marathi blog:

१२८४. वातोल्लासितकल्लोल धिक्ते सागर गर्जितम् \|

यस्य तीरे तृषाक्रान्तः पान्थः पृच्छति वापिकाम् \|\|

  

अर्थ

  

उसळलेल्या वाऱ्यामुळे मोठी गर्जना करणाऱ्या सागरा तुझा धिक्कार असो \[कारण\] तुझ्या किनाऱ्यावर तहानलेला वाटसरू विहीर कुठे असेल त्याची विचारणा करतो. \[सागरान्योक्ती सागर = कंजूष श्रीमंत; वाटसरू = गरीब याचक\]

  

In this case, it is clear the reading suits better वापिकाम् than in masculine gender.
