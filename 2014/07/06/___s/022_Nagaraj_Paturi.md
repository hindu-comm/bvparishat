Thanks a lot Prof. Kulkarni.



My instant response was



There is a vrata called taṭākōddhāravrata ( taṭāka+uddhāra+vrata) mentioned and described in detail in various mahāpurāṇas and upapurāṇas.



Without your post, "various mahāpurāṇas and upapurāṇas. " in my response would not have been substantiated.



Thanks again.



Regards,



Nagaraj
