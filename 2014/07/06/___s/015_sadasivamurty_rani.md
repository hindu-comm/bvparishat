Respected Scholars and Ashok Ji,

I may be excused for posting the same content again. In the attempt of my earlier posting it was incompletely posted without my effort. Hence this repetition of posting.

Prof. Ashok Ji!

Pranams!

My sincere thanks to you for suggesting typing/input changes in posting.

Having seen your suggestions I once again verified my sources and the following are my observations:

1.तरङ्गमालिकाभील धिक्ते सागर गर्जितम्।

यस्य तीरे तृष्णाप्राप्ता: पान्था: पृच्छन्ति वापिकम्॥

This sloka is collected by me from Samskrita Sukti Saurabham published in Telugu Script by Telugu Academy published in 2007. This is also found in Subhashita Manjari (also a collection of Sanskrit Subhashitas in Telugu Script).

In this sloka our changes are suggested by you.

1.आभील

The first oneआभील needs no correction and it meansभीकर

तरङ्गमालिकाभील (सम्बुद्धि) - means one who is dreadful with his chain of waves  

2.सागरगर्जितम्

There are two readings. In the modern text there is space after Sagara (taking it inसम्बुद्धि). But in another text called subhashita manjari also this sloka is found whereसागर is taken to be suggestive of being poisonous

andसागरगर्जितम् means 'poisonous' roaring (by dint of Anyokti referring to the insulting denial of poor by rich people). Further suggestions from the scholars may clarify this.

3. तृष्णाप्राप्ता:

Here is it not possible to support it by the vigraha vakya तृष्णया (सागरं) प्राप्ता: तॄष्णाप्राप्ता:? The wordतृष्णा means thirst . Soतृष्णाप्राप्ता: are those who approached the ocean with thirsty feeling.

4.वापिकम्

वापि: andवापिक: are found in masculine gender also. So the text in both the sources have the same reading.  

  

II\. The rest of the two slokas are taken from Subhashita Ratna Bhandagara from which my inputs don't differ. Further discussions may be judged by the scholars.

With warm regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
