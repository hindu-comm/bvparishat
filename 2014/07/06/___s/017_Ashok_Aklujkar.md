Dear Dr. Murty,  
  
Thanks for making me aware of the meaning of आभील. I agree with you that no change in the first paada is needed.  
  
In the second paada, there must be a noun in the vocative that makes the use of ते (= तव) possible. Whether one reads an additional meaning 'poisonous' in the word सागर would be a matter of personal taste. I would find the investing of such a meaning in the word unnatural if it can be had only by imagining स + गर in the place of सागर or by some other verbal compromise.  
  
The third paada does not sound metrically proper to me.  
  
What is your authority for वापि and वापिक as masculine? Even if they are recorded by some lexicographer with that feature, do we have an any occurrences that would make out ;sloka composer's preferring them in that gender, even when the metre can accommodate the usual feminine वापी/वापिका?  
  
Best wishes.  
  
a.a.
