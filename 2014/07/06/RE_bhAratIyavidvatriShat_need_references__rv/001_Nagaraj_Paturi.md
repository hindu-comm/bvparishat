One way of approaching this issue is to look into upākhyānas of devotion to parents.

  

A book with details :

  

**Devotional Literature in South Asia: **Current Research, 1985-1988

R. S. McGregor

Cambridge University Press, 25-Sep-1992 - - 322 pages

traces the history of such stories as part of an article on Pundalika story. A snapshot of the relevant part is attached here.

  

Dharmavyadhopakhyana as narrated in English on a website is being shared here as a pdf.

  

Dharmavyadhopakhyana is Mahabharata vanaparva 196-206

  

One good verse from there is

  

पिता माता च भगवन्नेतौ मे देवतं परं

  

यद्देवतेभ्यः कर्तव्यं तदेताभ्यां करोम्यहं

  

We may continue to work on other such upakhyanas.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
