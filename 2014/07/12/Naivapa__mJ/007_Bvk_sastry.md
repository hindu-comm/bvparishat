Namaste

  

One practical literary usage in Bhasa's drama: pratima natakam (- pre Kalidasa ).

  

Context: dasharathas last words to kaikeyi after Rama left to forest to comply with the dasharathas boons given to kaikeyi.

Dasharatha: नैवापमम्बु भरतेन न मे प्रदेयम्

Bharatha is prohibited/ deaurhorized from offering the - naivammambu- the waters offered as a part of pitru- karma shraaddha.

  

A fathers right and choice on who can offer pitru karma .
