Sorry. The context is different. I read the line in Campuramayana, in Ayodhyakanda Verse No.21:

I don't remember reading this line in Pratimanataka. Anyhow needs to be checked. The line is the 4th Paada in Campuramayana. The reference in Pratimanataka is to be checked. Please give the exact reference in Pratimanataka so that both verses could be compared.

  

Thanks for the use.
