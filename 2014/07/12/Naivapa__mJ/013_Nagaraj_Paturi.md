In Matsya Purana where pitr̥ tarpaṇa is discussed, the word nivāpah has been used in its plural form 'nivāpēṣu' . Moreover, 'nivāpa' is listed among a group of items used for pitr̥ tarpaṇa.

  

The snapshots of two pages from the relevant part of Matsya Purana with the word 'nivāpēṣu' highlighted are being shared.
