The issue can be divided into two aspects:



1\. S'ankara's methodology of handling the explanation of reality by differentśāstras : In this aspect śankara's approach of dividing śāstras into śāstras dealing with 'natural-reality' and śāstras dealing with 'supernatural reality'. His advice is to take recourse to śāstras of supernatural reality only when issues of that reality are discussed and to handle all the 'natural-reality' related issues with the help of śāstras dealing with that reality. This methodology is found used by him right from the upōdghāta to jagadvyāpārādhikaraṇam in sūtrabhāṣya and all other books of him, with or without using the words 'vyāvahārika' and 'pāramārthika'.



2\. The use of the exact words 'vyāvahārika' and 'pāramārthika'
