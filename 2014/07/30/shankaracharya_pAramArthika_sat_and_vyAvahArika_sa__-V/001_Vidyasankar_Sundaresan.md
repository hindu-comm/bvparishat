Please consult the bhAshya on bRhadAraNyaka maitreyI brAhmaNa - yatra tu dvaitam iva bhavati ... yatra tv asya sarvam AtmaivAbhUt ... and the mUrtAmUrta brAhmaNa - neti neti ... satyasya satyam. These are just two instances out of a vast number in the prasthAnatraya commentaries.  
  
Or, go to <http://sanskritdocuments.org> and follow the link to upadeSasAhasrI. There are many occurrences of vyavahAre, vyavahArA and vyavahita, as also vyavasthita, vyavadhAna and vyavasyati.
