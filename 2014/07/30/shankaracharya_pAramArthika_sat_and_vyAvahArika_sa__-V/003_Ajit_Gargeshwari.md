Reading sutras isolated or bereft of context will not help one to see the context of the sutras and understand them . Please ask you teacher about methodology of reading Sutras and bhashyas in Sanskrit works. That might help

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
