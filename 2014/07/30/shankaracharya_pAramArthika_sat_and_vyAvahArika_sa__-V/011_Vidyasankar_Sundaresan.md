No sUtra sankhyA. I'm referring to the corresponding upanishad bhAshya. If, as Sri Subrahmanian has suggested, you log on to <http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net>, you can use the search feature, select the brahmasUtra bhAshya and look for occurrences of the terms you are interested in. However, one definitely has to look beyond the brahmasUtra bhAshya, to get a bigger picture of Sankara's thinking, so you might as well use the search feature on the other bhAshyas as well.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
