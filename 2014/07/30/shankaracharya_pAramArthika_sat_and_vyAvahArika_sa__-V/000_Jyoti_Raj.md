Does shankaracharya differentiate between पारमार्थिक सत् and व्यावहारिक सत् ?

if yes then from where i can get it ?

  

my teacher wants to know about it because he says these concepts came later in the vedanta ...

  

i gave the referenceएकस्यैव तु भेदव्यवहार उपाधिकृतः, यथा घटाकाशो महाकाश इति । (ब्रह्मसूत्र १.२.३०, शाङ्करभाष्य) but he is not ready to accept it ...

  

if i am right kindly provide me the reference and if i am wrong then kindly suggest me the right way.
