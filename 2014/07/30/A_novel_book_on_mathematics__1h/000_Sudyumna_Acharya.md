The book 'Ganit Shastra ke Vikas ki Bharatiya Parampara' by Dr. Sudyumna Acharya is a novel addition to the long series of compositions on Indian mathematics. It aims to discuss the theorems that have been invented and developed long through ages. It provides graphic description of the theorems with proofs in chronological order. The author has brought together all the data into a single compass of volume and then put them into comparison with modern mathematics. The theorems were specially underlined that have been entitled to be known with Indian mathematics. The scholars are requested to appreciate and disseminate the book widely--sincerely yours--Dr.Sudyumna Acharya.
