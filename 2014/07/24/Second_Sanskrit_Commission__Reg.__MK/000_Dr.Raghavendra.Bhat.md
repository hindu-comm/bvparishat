Respected Scholars,

As a Sanskrit scholar,I am very much curios to know about second Sanskrit Commission and its present status..([RESOLUTION DATED 10.01.2014 REGARDING APPOINTMENT OF SECOND SANSKRIT COMMISSION](http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Res10012014.pdf "PDF will open in new window"))

(<http://mhrd.gov.in/circular?term_node_tid_depth=All&tid%5Bhsid%5D=0&tid%5Bhierarchical_select%5D%5Bselects%5D%5B0%5D=119&tid%5Bhierarchical_select%5D%5Bselects%5D%5B1%5D=130&tid%5Bflat_select%5D%5B%5D=130&op=Update&hs_form_build_id=hs_form_edd7ceee057565a9fc2dae47556730f6>)

Is it started its duty? Is it does Sanskrit Survey?

I am kindly requesting scholars to enlighten me in this regard.

  

with warm regards,
