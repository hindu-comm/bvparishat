Dear friends,  
  

I have presented a paper on the Dotted Record, which has a great bearing on the dates of several Buddhist scholars of the past and also on the date of Lord Buddha. This area has been a disputed one and the proper interpretation of the Dotted record has a great role to play in this. The paper is attached for your perusal and feedback.  
  

Regards,
