I am not an expert. But I found the paper quite interesting.



I remember Prof. Ashok Aklujkar having said in a speech in Pune that all the dates pertaining to the Indian historical personalities as well as Indian literary works will keep sliding back as more and more evidence surfaces. He also made a presentation taking the dates of Lord Buddha and Emperor Ashoka back by a few hundred years, which the Indologists present there vehemently protested against.



Isn’t it high time we Indians made original independent research and rewrote our own history based on facts and interpretations not tainted by the prejudiced views of the earlier western historians? Of course that is going to meet with a lot of furious criticism by the so called elites, self proclaimed secularists and those brainwashed in the Macaulayan education system. But in the interest of the truth as well as pride for our land, our people, our culture and our traditions, that must be done.
