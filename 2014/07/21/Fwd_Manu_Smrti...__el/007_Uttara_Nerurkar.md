Prof. Dr. Surendra Kumar has done a lot of research on Manusmrti. He has published an expansive commentary in Hindi, which is published by Arsh Sahitya Prachar Trust. He has also tried to figure out and remove extraneous insertions over the ages based on context, contradictions, etc. The reduced version is available as Vishuddha Manusmrti, again published by Arsh Sahitya Prachar Trust. (About half of this latter book is dedicated to explaining the basis for deletion of certain shlokas.)

  

You may find it helpful, if the student understands Hindi.

  

Regards,

  

Uttara Nerurkar,

Vedic Scholar.
