Namaste,  
  

Some scholars consider the Manav Dharma given by Manu as Saarvabhauma, Saarvakaalika and Saarvajanika. I shall be thankful if any scholar can throw some light on this by giving the information, as to where is this said in any of the canonical texts ?  
  
I am finding it difficult to agree to this, for the reason that, it is given in the Parashara Smriti that according to Vedavyasa the Manu Smriti was meant only for the Satya (Krta) yuga. In the Parashara Smriti the sage Parashara also lets us know that he wrote the Smriti (i.e., the Parashara Smrit) at the express request of Vedavyasa, who requested him to write a Smriti, appropriate for the Kali yuga, as till then no such text existed which could be passed on to the Kali yuga.
