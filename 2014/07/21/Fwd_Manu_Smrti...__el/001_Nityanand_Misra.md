Dear Sir,



How have you been? It's been a long time since we spoke last (more than seven years!) - when you were still working on your Operations Management book. I did visit the campus a couple of times after graduating but could not meet you. Hopefully we can meet when I am there next (later this year or next year). Good to know about this research work.

  
Here are some references which may be useful to your student -



Manava Dharma Shastra (Institutes of Manu) with six Sanskrit Commentaries (Medhatithi, Sarvajnanarayana, Kulluka Bhatta, Raghavananda, Nandana and Ramachandra). Ganpat Krishnaji's Press, 1886, Bombay.  
<https://archive.org/details/manusmriti>



Manusmriti or Manavadharmashastra. With Hindi translation by Pandit Girija Prasad Dwivedi, Lucknow, 1917.  
<https://archive.org/details/ManuSmritHindi-GpDwivedi>



The following papers may be of good use - it appears the same person is credited in different ways in the two papers.



N. Sivakumar, (2009) "Values-based corporate governance and organization behavior – guidelines from Manusmriti for ethical and social responsibility", Corporate Governance, Volume 9 Issue 5, pp.573–585

Kumar, Shiva N. and Rao, U.S. (1996). "Guidelines for Value Based Management in Manusmriti," Abhigyan: The Journal of Foundation of Organisational Research, pp. 45–54.



The authors have another paper which may be of interest



N. Siva Kumar and U. S. Rao (1996). "Guidelines for Value Based Management in Kautilya's Arthashastra," Journal of Business Ethics, Volume 15, Number 4, pp. 415–423



Hope this helps.



Regards, Nityānanda
