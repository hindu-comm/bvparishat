Thanks for alerting on time. As a co-Nazi with regard to grammar, I feel ashamed not to have noticed the uncountable nature of the noun 'software'. I was probably trapped into this by the google searchsuggestions. Some non-Nazi on some blog was arguing that given the usages such as 'Mathematics', there is nothing 'non-native' about 'softwares'. There are lamentations on several blogs that 'softwares' is creeping into English all over the world. But I would always go with the pedantic side.



Thanks.
