Sorry for being a grammar Nazi, but that is not a result of a limitation of the spellchecker. Rather it is a mistake which is being correctly flagged. The word “software” is a mass noun and has no plural in either British or American English (I am not sure if dictionaries of other variants of English list the plural). Think ofthe word “software”like “furniture”, “advice”, “traffic” et cetera – no plural. So “softwares” is wrong usage – an error often made by non-native speakers of English – you probably want to use “programs” or “software packages”. Your spellchecker is doing a good job by flagging it. Simlarly "a software" is wrong.
