Spellchecker softwares for Indic languages are in their formative stage only. The plugin compares the typed word treating it as a glyph sequence to the word (glyph sequence)in the database included in the plugin. The word that does not match with any word in the data base is given a red underline. There is a provision in these plugins to add new words into the database. This is not useful for creative sandhi and samaasa formations. But this is useful just as a reminder in praamaadika skhaalityas in typing the established words.



Limitations are inevitable even for English. For instance, 'softwares' was given an error mark in this message. Suggestions were 'software', 'software's' and 'soft wares'.

Nagaraj
