In my opinion any standard dictionary is the best source for spell check in Sanskrit.

This is different in case of English. The reason is : In English language we usually don't write as we do pronounce. So the spelling of a word in English is different from the way it is pronounced.

It is not so in Sanskrit. We spell as we do pronounce. So any standard Sanskrit Dictionary can help us to check our spellings.

With warm regards,
