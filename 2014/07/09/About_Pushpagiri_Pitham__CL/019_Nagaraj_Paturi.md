"My basic question is how the \[advaita\]vedAnta saMnyAsa tradition which in its origin was absolutely innocent of any maTha or organised monastery with retinues and elaborate worship, etc. and which insists its saMnyAsI-s (paramahaMsa, avadhUta, bahUdaka, .....) perform only praNavajapa and which stresses utmost on the vow of aparigraha, etc.
for them, and which has next to nothing to do with temple, and whose basic doctrine was everything is mithyA other than kevala Brahma,"





-What is the evidence for

1".which in its origin was absolutely innocent of any maTha or organised monastery with retinues and elaborate worship, etc"

2\. and which insists its saMnyAsI-s (paramahaMsa, avadhUta, bahUdaka, .....) perform only praNavajapa

3\. and which has next to nothing to do with temple
