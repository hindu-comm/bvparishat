Dear Dr. Ganeshan ji

The information you have with you about the Shaiva Pithams and Pushpagiri peetham with strong support of inscription is great research value. Thanks for your valuable postings on this topic.

But won't it be better to have a separate thread of mails on the issue of Pushpagiri Peetham instead of clubbing it with the event of the felicitation of Prof. K. Subrahmanyam garu?

With warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
