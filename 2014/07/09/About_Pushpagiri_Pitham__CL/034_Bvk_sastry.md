Namaste Nagaraj Paturi

  

1\. I do not understand the \< ????> mark response on your post. What is your point of objection?

  

2. I believe i have responded clearly to your basic question reading \<
the \[advaita\]vedAnta saMnyAsa tradition which in its origin was absolutely innocent of any maTha or organised monastery with retinues and elaborate worship, etc. >.

  

Sannyasa tradition comes from its vedic roots. Advaita flavor of Sannyasa tradition comes under the wraps of Yoga- sampradayas.

  

Regarding organized monastery part, The clarity rests in the understanding of the meaning of the word \< maTha> as given in Amarakosha, the prevalent sanskrit dictionary of language usage- period.

  

Your charge on advaita sannyasa tradition for absolute innocence of
temple worship of elaborate worship and ritual traditions is not substantiated. The social institutional part of a maThadhipati and personal sadhana part of a Sannyasi should not be mixed up.
