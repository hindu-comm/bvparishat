In what way it "does not suit an academic debate and an academicforum such as BVP" ?  
What did you find so offensive and unsuitable in my expression ?  
  
  
But you did not retort when Mr. Vidyasankar used the same expression before me ?  
Mr. Nagaraj, you are not the moderator here and by any standard, I have not used any ashliila or anaucitya word here.  
If you are interested in the discussion, please participate.  
  
Ganesan
