1.Which pre-S'ankaravaidika book**prescribes** writing bhāṣyas as a vidhi to a samnyāsī? Which pre-ś'ankara book **prescribes** engaging in polemics as a vidhi for a samnyāsī?Which pre-S'ankaravaidika book**prescribes** reviving uttara-mīmāmsā studies as a vidhito a smnyāsī?

2.. Do śaivas of Pāśupata, Kāpālika, Kālāmukha, Vīraśaiva and other such strands belong to the same single tradition of śaiva? If no, is it justified to quote Pāśupata documents while talking about present day śaiva maṭhas and temples? If yes, are the actions that lead to the emergence of Kālāmukha , Vīraśaiva and other ‘trends’ in śaiva
**prescribed** in Pāśupata texts?

Nagaraj
