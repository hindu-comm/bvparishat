Dear Dr. Ganesan,



It is interesting that you should cite the jIvanmuktiviveka of vidyAraNya now andascribe the birth of the Sringeri maTha to vidyAraNya and not Sankara in an earlier post, while also holding that there is a fundamental incompatibility between the very existence of maTha-s and the ideal lives of parivrAjaka saMnyAsin-s in the advaita tradition. I'm afraidyour idea of what a parivrAjakashould be is a fictional one, bearing no relation to social and historical actuality.The reason is as follows.



The vidyAraNya who wrote thejIvanmuktiviveka is the very same vidyAraNya who inherited a leadership position in the advaita tradition established at Sringeri. He is also traditionally credited with having founded maTha-s at Hampi, Pushpagiri etc. Even if you doubt whether it was the 14th century vidyAraNya who established these other maTha-s, you cannot deny the existence of an advaita maTha at Sringeri and its connection with the very samevidyAraNya and his predecessors, bhAratI tIrtha and vidyAtIrtha. There is too much inscriptional evidence from early vijayanagara history to substantiate this. However, if you were to look for even a single reference to a Sringeri pITham or a SaradA temple or a vidyASankara templein texts like pancadaSI or jIvanmuktiviveka, you will find nothing. You will find hardly anything even in the commentaries and sub-commentaries to these texts. So there you have it - a great silence in the textual evidence about maTha-s from the same authors whom we know, from other independent historical sources, to have been intimately involved with thefunctioning of at least one maTha, if not many more.



Nor can you deny the prior existence of an advaita institution (let's not call it a maTha, if you so prefer) in Udupi, a century or so before vidyAraNya, and associated with theeven more ancient temple complexes of Ananteshwara and Chandramaulishwara there. It was this advaita institution which got transformed into the tauLavaashTa maTha-s of dvaita tradition after the time of AnanatIrtha, aka madhvAcArya. So you see, an institution of one school can easily change into an institution of another school of thought, depending upon the charismatic leadership and work of specific people in history. You give due importance to and treat sensitively a variety of traditional accounts, most of which will not be found in written sources, inscriptional or otherwise,and many elements of which will contradict one another. Yet, unless you can see that such accounts nevertheless retain a huge amount of factual information,you will never see a comprehensive picture and you will never be able to see why there is nothing majorly problematic about parivrAjaka-s staying in maTha-s or advaita vedAntin-s being associated with temple construction, administration and ritual.



It is interesting to methat you ask for textual authority, when you know very well that the bulk of any Indian religious custom comes from SishTAcAra, which can change with historical circumstances. Each maTha in the advaita traditon has its own unique customs in addition to certain basic features that are common across them. Much of it simply reflects what is remembered by old-timers associated with each maTha and passed on to younger people, in an oral tradition context, even to date. You are perhaps following the contemporary news about the role of the Puri Sankaracharya in the Jagannatha temple and its Ratha Yatra. It stands to reason that none of the rituals, customs and traditions of the Puri Govardhana Sankaracharya Matha and its relationship to the Puri temple would apply to any of the other maTha-s in the advaita tradition.



If you would like tohold that as a daNDi/paramahaMsa saMnyAsin in the advaita tradition, the Puri Sankaracharya should have no role to play in the Jagannatha temple, you might as well hold that all advaita vedAntin-s should drop dead the instant they say that the AtmA has no deha.



As for the term kApila-saMnyAsa that you cite, I second Sri Lalitaalaalita's request for an exact textual reference. I do not recollect having seen this phrase in either viSveSvara sarasvatI's yatidharmaprakASa or vAsudevASrama's yatidharmanirNaya, which broadly describe whathappens in thetraditional saMnyAsa circles corresponding to advaita vedAnta. In any case, discussing the term kApila is quite peripheral to the broader issues you see with the very existence of maTha-s within the saMnyAsa tradition of advaita vedAnta. One could simply point to at least one place in the gItAbhAshya where Sankara himself equates sAMkhya to vedAnta - jnAtavyAH padArthAs saMkhyAyante yasmincchAstre tat sAMkhyaM vedAntaH.



Finally, I would urge you to also take seriously the distinction that Sri Lalitaalaalita draws between advaita vedAnta as a system of thought/interpretation and what he broadly calls vaidika saMnyAsa. There is an intimate connection betweensaMnyAsa and the idealof the jnAnI in advaita thought, but advaita vedAntins will be the first tohold steadfastly to the fact that vaidika traditions of saMnyAsa, including the multiple bylanes leading to the big path of nivRtti dharma, was \*not\* invented by Sankara. It predates him.



I myself prefer to use the term brAhmaNa saMnyAsa, in order to include the vastly diverse traditions of renunciation followed by SrIvaishNava-s and mAdhva-s in the south and the various Saiva oriented daSanAmI akhADA-s in the north. Iacknowledge that some features in each of these traditions may not be found in what academicians would consider vaidika sources today, but would like to point out that these multiple traditions still remain distinctively brAhmaNa in nature and that they preserve the centrality/superiority of vaidika traditions in their conceptions and practice of saMnyAsa.



With best regards,

Vidyasankar
