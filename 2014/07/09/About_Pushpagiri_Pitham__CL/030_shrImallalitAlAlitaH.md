You are too much extending everything.  

sAmpradAyika-s don't accept this thing. sha\~Nkara's vAkyA-s should be understood in accordance with vidhi-s of sannyAsa. You should also consider his other sentences about sannyAsa while talking about it.  

There are many types of sannyAsa described in gItA, which has created illusion about their meaning for you. Don't force on it when you are confronting others in debate. It will just reveal your ignorance of bhAShya and saMpradAya and give others chance to blame us.
