I wanted to follow Ajitji's moderation. Not to continue the discussion on that.



Mine was not a moderation.



I did not allege any aślīlatva.



" gobbling up everything under the Indian hot sun"



is a sweeping generalization.



It is well within the norms of a debate/logic to point out ativyāpti as a dōṣa.



I only said that sweeping generalizations can not be debated.



Regards,



Nagaraj
