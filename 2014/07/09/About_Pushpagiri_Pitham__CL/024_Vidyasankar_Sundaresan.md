Dear Dr. Ganesan,



I have indeed read David Lorenzen's book on the kApAlikas and kAlAmukhas. The work is not newto me.



Is there tangible inscriptional evidence for a maTha ofthe advaita vedAnta tradition at Sringeri from before vijayanagara times? I would be the second to unequivocally say that there isn't. And I would only be second because the first to say sohas beenthe Sringeri maTha administration itself. Over the last two centuries, the Acharyas and adminstrators of the Sringeri maTha have always accepted that their documented history emerges in the 14th century, along with the rise of the vijayanagara empire, but they always hold that theirtraditional history takes them back to the time of Sankara. In theperspective of the Sringeri maTha administration,this is analogous to Indian history itself emerging in a documented form only a few centuries before Christ, even though the origins of vaidika civilization are undoubtedly much, much older.The only people who seem to have a problem with this situation are either those who have something against the Sringeri maTha in particular or against advaita vedAnta in general.



Let us leave aside the identity of a mAdhava with vidyAraNya for the purposes of this discussion, because the birth name of one individual is irrelevant here. That said, I would ask you to provide concrete references to back up your claim that there are inscriptional references to kAlAmukha AcAryas and institutions in the Vidyasankara temple itself. The oldest date for this temple can only be in the 14th century, around the time when the first two rulers of the vijayanagara empire lived. Architecturally, the Vidyasankara temple bears all signs of being later Hoysala and early Vijayanagara in nature.This is also the time in which bhAratI tIrtha and vidyAraNya lived. Now, it is beyond any question that these two were Sankaran advaita vedAntins, that they were the most prominent thought leaders of the associated saMnyAsa tradition at the time, as also heads of the maTha at Sringeri.



If it is true that there is evidence for kAlAmukhas in inscriptions **at the Vidyasankara temple itself**, then I would very much like to learn what exactly such evidence amounts to, as I have never heard of or seen it myself before your posts on this forum. Ifsuch inscriptionsexist, itwould beincredible evidence for the co-existence of Saiva kAlAmukhas and advaita vedAntin saMnyAsins at Sringeri, \*after\* the year 1347 CE. If such co-existencecan be proved by inscriptional evidence from the Vidyasankara temple, at a time when the advaita vedAnta institution and its associated temples rapidly grew in size and its range of activity as a result of royal patronage, then there is nothing to preclude the co-existence of kAlAmukhas and advaita vedAntins at the sameplaceat an earlier time either.



I am very surprised that you are quite unaware of the documented presence of jainas in the region. There is a jaina basadi in Sringeri even today, with a quite old temple dedicated tothe tIrthAnkara pArSvanAtha, which was renovated a few decades ago with financial assistance from the advaita vedAnta maTha administration. Inscriptional evidence for the presence of jainas in the region goes back at least to the 12th century. There are those who claim that the Sarada temple used to be a jaina temple dedicated to padmAvatI, albeit without much evidence for such an assertion (in my opinion). Another well-known placenot far from Sringeriis dharmasthala, where the Siva temple was constructed and has always been administered by jaina management, with pUjA being conducted by vaishNava mAdhva priests. There is no doubt about the fact that there were always multiple faiths represented in the region, a lot more than the solely Saiva kAlAmukha presence that you would like to highlight. Today, you will find Muslims and Christiansin quite significant numbers in and around Sringeri, with mosques and churches too. It is a free country after all. Local Muslims believe that there is a Sufi Pir buried in the side of the hillock where the old Malahanikareswara temple sits, in the heart of Sringeri town. You might want to read Leela Prasad's Poetics of Conduct (Columbia 2006) for more details.Still, I wouldn't be surprised if one day somebody claims that a Sufi dargah got converted to a saMnyAsin samAdhi temple that then became a big Siva temple in Sringeri.C'est la vie.



May I draw your attention to a little noticed seal published in the Epigraphica Carnatica by Lewis Rice? It dates from the 13th century, many decades before the timesof vidyAraNya and vijayanagara. It is a seal of vidyASankara, found in the same Malanad region,with references to gauDapAda and salutations to dattAtreya, along withthe symbol of a boar. Exact page details of publication in EC may be found in Antonio Rigopoulos's work,Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin and Avatara (SUNY, 1998). Is there any inscriptional evidence for a maTha of the advaita vedAnta tradition, a century before harihara and bukkarAya or bhAratI tIrtha and vidyAraNya lived? No. However,please ask yourself why would a saMnyAsin named vidyASankara need an officialseal incorporating a well known royal emblem of the Chalukyas (varAha), unless he was already part of an institution that needed to interact with society at large and with local rulers in particular?



Is there a traditional stancethat an advaita maTha has been around at Sringeri since the times of Adi Sankara? Yes. Do we have pratyaksha evidence that an advaita maTha existed and functionedat Sringeri before the 14th century? No.Canwe make an anumAna from this vidyASankara seal, or perhaps an arthApatti from the documented later history, that such an institution must have existed before the 14th century? We very well can. Otherwise,between kAlAmukhas, supposedly at theVidyasankara temple, and jainas, supposedlyat the Sarada temple, a few yards away, wecan resort to nothing except magic to explain how Sringeri became such a celebrated center of advaita vedAnta in the 14th century. Other than the one seal mentioned above,older evidencehas not beenfound.However, construing absence of evidence as evidence of absence is a logical fallacy that scholars often commit, knowingly or unknowingly, and I'm afraid a lot of research into the history of Indian religous institutions often falls prey to it. I could write a lot more, but instead let me just cite my paper on history and hagiography in the Sankaravijaya texts, published in the International Journal of Hindu Studies, 2000. It is far more probable that what the Sringeri maTha says about itself is correct, namely that a pre-existing small forest ASrama grew into a big maTha in the 14th century, because of patronage by the newly emergent royalty of Vijayanagara.



Your assumption that temples and/or maThas are fundamentally incompatible with samnyAsa and/or advaita vedAnta is not only not right, it is not even wrong. Sorry to be so blunt. Also, permit me to disagree sharply from your stance that there is an incompatibility between advaita vedAnta (or more generally, aupanishada) streams of philosophical reflectionand Saiva traditions of worship. Indeed, the vIraSaivas of Karnataka recount a tradition that their revaNasiddha gave Adi Sankara a Sivalinga, which is now beingworshipped in Sringeri. This tradition is even mentioned in the auto-commentary to the Sringeri maTha's own guruvaMSakAvya, written in the 16th century or so. Thankfully, the vIraSaivasdo not claim that Sringeri was a vIraSaiva institution before it was an advaita vedAnta institution. Probably because a vIraSaiva institution associated with revaNasiddha continues to function and flourish on its own, at nearby Balehonnur in the Chikkamagalur district. This about wraps up all that I want to say with respect to factors outside of advaita vedAnta proper and its tradition of saMnyAsa.



Now, why all this discussion about Sringeri in the context of the Pushpagiri Pitham? It was because in one of your earliest mails on this topic, you sought to portray vidyAraNya, not Sankara,as the founder of a maTha at Sringeri and then proceeded, in the same sentence, to cast doubt on even that, saying that there are kAlAmukha inscriptions in the Vidyasankara temple. So let me reiterate, I would very much like to see that claim backed up with concrete details about such inscriptional evidence.



As far as the advaita vedAnta maTha at Pushpagiri is concerned, please let me take back my earlier statement that implied that it was established by vidyAraNya. As per documented historical records, the pushpagiri maTha was actually established as a branch of the Hampi virUpAksha pITha, some time in the 17th century. The Pushpagiri and Hampi maThas continue to have close institutional linkages to date. The Hampi virUpAksha maTha is said to have been established by Vidyaranya, but again, there are those in academic circles, who think that the Hampi maTha came into existence not in the 14th century, but only in the time of Krishnadevaraya. As per all available accounts,the Pushpagiri maTha was established even later than the battle of Talikota. The declineof the Saiva lineages in the Andhra country, of which you speak, had to have happened much before then. There can be no real relationship connecting the historical Saiva lineages of Amardaka, Golaki and Pushpagiri with the Pushpagiri Pitham that is a saMnyAsi maTha with affiliation toadvaita vedAnta today.



As for paramahaMsa-s, their supposed sole reliance on praNava-japa and how that seems incompatible with temples and maTha-s in your eyes, I will comment on it at a later date. I am hard pressed for time today.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
