Dear Dr. Ganesan,



With all due respect, may I suggest a refresher on pUrva mImAMsA, especially as it impinges upon uttara mImAMsA, i.e. vedAnta? The vidhi - pratishedhaSAstra isvery nuanced. For example, the statement"panca pancanAkhA bhakshyAH" is absolutely \*not\* an injunction to eat five different five-nailed animals, but an injunction \*not\* to eat any other animals. Whether one eats the five five-nailed animals or does not eat them is left to individual choice. In contrast, "tasyaitad vratam ... ... na kUrmasyASnIyAt" is a direct prohibitionagainst eating tortoise meat, not for everybody, but onlyfor one who has undertaken a particular vrata.One really needs to understand how vidhi-s and pratishedha-s are structured, how they operate and how they are interpreted as social, cultural and politicalcircumstances evolve.



In advaita vedAnta, for the jnAnI, no vidhi-s and no pratishedha-s are binding. He who knows brahman has gone completely beyond all rules. Whether he lives alone in a forest or manages a temple in a bustiling tIrtha, whether hewanders naked or whetherhe wears a crown and sits on a throne, none of these matter. For the jijnAsu who becomes a saMnyAsin, there are rules and regulations. None of these really prohibit saguNopAsana of various forms and none of these enjoin \*only\* praNava-japa. Indeed, from an advanced advaita vedAntic perspective, mere japa is meant for manda-madhyama buddhi-s. The uttamAdhikArin's meditation on the praNava is not japa. In any case, please take a look at the various texts described as saMnyAsa upanishads. Patrick Olivelle has a convenient English translation published by the Oxford University Press in 1998. Or you could go to the Adyar Library's editions of these texts with the commentaries of the celebrated upanishad brahmayogin. You will see that many of these texts list temples as one of the allowed places where saMnyAsin-s may reside. This isthe very thing that you presume saMnyAsin-s should have avoided. Given the vast diverstiy of temples and their origins, it stands to reason that advaita vedAntin saMnyAsin-s may have resided in temples operated by Saiva siddhAntin-s or pASupata-s orin temples managed by bhAgavata-s or pAncarAtrin-s or even in temples managed by tAntrika-s.



Have the customs and practices of saMnyAsin-s in the advaita vedAnta tradition changed and divergedover time? Yes, absolutely. There is no quarrel with that statement. However, are these changes alien to or contradictory of the principles of advaita vedAnta or of old conceptions of saMnyAsa? Absolutely not, as far as the traditional maTha-s with centuries of history behind them are concerned.



What happens today is debatable, but that is a topic of an entirely different discussion, is it not?



Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. I would still very much like a concrete reference or twoto studies of inscriptional evidence of kAlAmukha-s in the 14th century vidyASankara temple.
