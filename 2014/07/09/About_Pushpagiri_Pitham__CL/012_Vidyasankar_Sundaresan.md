Please read Ananda tIrtha, not AnanatIrtha.

I meant to say, "You have to give due importance to ..."



In a nutshell, my point about the Pushpagiri Pitham is this.One should point to specific evidence that could indicate that a non-vedAnta Saiva institution got converted to an advaita vedAnta institution. Such evidence could take the form of inscriptional evidence or the life story of specific individual(s) who brought about such a conversion. Otherwise, it will only be a leap of logic, converting an assumption,"this is what must have happened," to a conclusion,"this is what indeed happened," without a clear path between them. Evidence for the existence of a Saiva order inthe place at some point of time in the past is not sufficient to prove the theory that it got converted to an advaita institution that exists today in the same place.



This is especially so because the assumption is based on at least one false premise, namely that renunciation in advaita vedAnta thought is fundamentally at odds with the existence of institutions to house renunciates. If advaita thought is supposedly structured in such a way as to have prevented either Sankara or vidyAraNya from establishing institutions on their own, the same reasons should have also prevented their followers fromtaking over and converting institutions belonging to other traditions. Conversely, if one can point to mechanisms by which a transformation into an advaita institution from another tradition could happen, then the same or similar mechanisms should have allowed advaita vedAntins to establish their own maTha-s and ASrama-s too.

Vidyasankar
