By śankara's time, temple construction and temple were well established. Evenaccording to those who believe in a non-idol worshipping, non-temple worshipping pure Vedic beginnings, Vedic culture got merged into an idol-worshipping, temple-worshipping culturewell beforeśankara's time Emergence of purāṇas, itihāsas,āgamic temples , temple-āgamas etc. istheorized to be simultaneous interconnected process which iswell beforeśankara .Thatśankarawas part of such a purāṇic / aitihāsic culture is evident from the fact that he included bhagavadgīta in the prasthānatraya of vēdānta and also from the fact that he wrote a bhāṣya to the thousand names of the purāṇic viṣṇu. Thus all the śankara's literature was written by him not in a pre-temple, pre-purāṇic, pre-āgamic Vedic culture but in a post-temple, post-purāṇic, post-āgamic Vedic culture, with śankara being very much part of that culture. He never wrote anything against idol-worship, temple-worship or purāṇic or āgamic culture.

  

It is a highly romanticized imagination about śankara, based on his emphasis on nirguṇatva of bramha to view him as opposed to idol-worship , temple-worship etc. It is again another romanticized imagination about śankara that he opposed grihasthāśrama, or that he was opposed to karmamārga. He not only did not oppose karmamārga, but his bhāṣyas very clearly show that he was a great supporter of all the vihita karmas. By his time, vihita karmas were not limited to Yajna etc. but included temple-worship , idol-worship etc. He goes to the extent of concluding his brahmasūtra bhāṣya with the proclamation that it makes no difference whether you are a saguṇa śaraṇa or nirguṇa śaraṇa to be able to attain anāvr̥tti . A snapshot is being shared.
