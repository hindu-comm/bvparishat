You, sir, were theone who brought in pUrvamImAMsA, by first talking of vidhi-s. I just made it clear to you that you quitemisunderstand the entire thing.



If you do not wish to waste time, please do not tread into unknown territory without the necessary maps to help you navigate. You keeppiling up random speculation on top of unwarranted assumptions and tryto present it all as if itwere a well-reasoned conclusion. Others have given you various references, which I daresay you will brush aside, for they don't confirm your prejudice.



Enough said,

Vidyasankar
