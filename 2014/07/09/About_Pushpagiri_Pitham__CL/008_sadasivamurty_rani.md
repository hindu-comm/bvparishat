Ganeshan Mahodaya!

I am sorry. I am misunderstood by you. I sincerely appreciate from my heart your efforts to bring out the sources of Pushpagiri and such Mathams. When I saw your first mail on this subject I thought it was a passing comment on Pushpagiri Matham as its name was connected with the felicitation of Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam Garu. Hence there itself I gave my reply.

But after seeing your consequent mails on this subject I could understand the intensity of your pursuit.

I too have something to say in this connection. But if I continue there itself it will be a confusion to others. Hence I requested you to continue this in a separate thread.

By the by I am the great grand son of Srimat"Paramahamasa, " "Parivrajakacharya, " "Mantacharya, " "Daivajna Sarvabhauma, " Sarvatantra Tantra" "Jagadguru" **Bodhananda Maha Swami** of Srimadabhinava Virupakshapeetha of Sri Vidyaranya tradition.

I have some sources to say about this tradition.

I shall share my views afterfurther progress of this discussion to some extent by the other scholars as am at present busy with a few activities which are to be paid immediate attention of mine.

I always have high regard for you Ganeshan Ji!

With warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
