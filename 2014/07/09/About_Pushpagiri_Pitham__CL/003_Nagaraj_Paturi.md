"As I had said in connection with an earlier thread in this same forum, Advaita VedAnta saMnyAsI-s are either ParivrAjaka-s or KuTIcaka-s or BahUdaka-s which fundamentally means that a strict Advaita vedAnta monk is supposed not to stay at a particular place for more than a night or two".



\- Which Advaita authority has said this?



In what way, 'KuTIcaka'-s or 'BahUdaka-s' is connected to "supposed not to stay at a particular place for more than a night or two"



"It is common knowledge that Advaita VedAnta does not prescribe temple construction/temple worship; nor such an act is part of its spiritual practices by any stretch of theory or imagination".



-Where does it proscribe it either?



"And, interestingly, which is again significant in this connection, we do not find any Saiva theme or motif or purANa stories depicted in the VishNu temples !! Needless to say who is more inclusive !!"



-Whose 'we are more inclusive' claim is being counter-argued by Dr. Ganeshanji here? Did any of those Vishnu temples people claim in this forum, "we are more inclusive" ?



There are many other questions like that.



Regards,



Nagaraj
