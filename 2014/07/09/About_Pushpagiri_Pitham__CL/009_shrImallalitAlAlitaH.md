I know that, but consider it that even they can't deny that they are vaidika-s. So, I took common things, sannyAsa, vaidikatva, etc. in consideration and replied.

Correct. Even here they can't say that their rituals deviate from veda-s and smR^iti-s.

Actually, as paramahaMsa-s are vaidika-s and just follower of Philosophy of sha\~Nkara-bhagavatpAda, similarly the eka-daNDi-paraMparA is anAdi, vaidikI and is just a stream which holds to advaitavAda.  
Both are similar.  
Both say that they have anAdi-paraMparA, are veda-prAmANyavAdI.  
Remember that govidna-bhagavatpAda was himself a sannyAsI live in o\~NkAreshvara on the banks of narmadA, where even now paramahaMsa-s are visible.  
  
This is what is our (of sannyAsin-s of both streams) point of view.  
What you are presenting is not accepted by us.  
That's why I called there is not anything called advaita-sannyAsI.

It means that Philosophy or Philosopher doesn't devise sannyAsa, but veda-s.

Both traditions, daNDin-s and daNDa-tyAgin-s, of paramahaMsa-sannyAsa which follow veda-s for everything and accept Philosophy of advaita as correct explanation.

Even layman, who has faith in veda-s, accept this.  
And that's why the difference is of vaidika-sannyAsI and agamika-sannyAsI and not of advaita-sannyAsI and shaiva-sannyAsI.

The goal of sannyAsa, according to veda-s is moxa.  
The means of achieving it is GYAna. Now, this GYAna comes from veda-s. veda-s are interpreted by various Philosophers. And, this is where a bunch of sannyAsI-s chose to stick to advaita-vAda which was later explained and supported by bhagavatpAda. Others are following what they think is correct.

Actually our texts don't call us by this name.  
So, the text which names us kApila, must be from a person who is either outsider or knows many traditions but had inclination towards them.  
If you could show the text and the author explains why he called us kApila, we will think about it. Otherwise, this term appears alien.

sA\~Nkhya thing is OK when one calls us by this name keeping in mind explanations put by us.  
Otherwise, it is also not acceptable.

No, but he becomes siddha!!:)  
BTW, kapila was not a sannyAsI. So, how could anyone relate him to sannyAsa ? Because sannyAsI-s follow his philosophy, isn't it? This is why I didn't accept this term for sannyAsI-s.

The purANa-vAkya-s which I can't present now.  
I'll try to find exact place in purANa and commentary of upaniShad-brahmendra.
