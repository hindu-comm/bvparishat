Does śankara prohibit samnyāsis from performing vihita karmas? Where to look for an answer to this question? It is the Gītā ,the path-integrator book .śankara's inclusion of this path-integratorbook in the prasthānatraya itself is an indication of his tātparya (utmost interest) in path-integration. It is in thebhāṣya of the Gītāthat he dealswith the issue of samnyāsi vis-à-vis vihita karma.In thebhāṣya on the third chapter, he says, asamnyāsi does not incur pratyavāya by not performing karmas. Hence he *need not*perform vihita karmas. 'Need not' does not mean 'should not'. Gītākāra himself brings the question of why jnāni performs vihitakarmas just in the way a person for whom such karmas are ordained performs them. Gītākāra says, 'he does it for lōkasangraha' (for the lōka =common people to take inspiration from him).śankaraexplains the heat of the Gītākārawithout disagreeing with him.Thus for śankara, a samnyāsi's performing ofkarmas such as dēvatārchanais at least for lōkasangraha if not out of his own choice of spiritual activitiesas there is no prohibition against this choice for a samnyyāsi.
