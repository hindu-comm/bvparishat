Dear Dr. Ganesan,

I had thought of not responding to your observations about the Pushpagiri Pitham on the thread announcing the felicitations for Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam, but now that this new thread has been initiated, may I request you to provide references to a few scholarly papers/books that talk of these inscriptions? We can discuss the supposed kalamukha origins of an establishment at Sringeri later, but before we get into that, please enlighten us where you stand on the kriyAshakti - vidyAraNya connection, as also on the supposed Jaina background.

I find it curious that all those who would postulate any origin under the hot Indian sun for Advaita institutions, anything except the brAhmaNa saMnyAsa tradition itself, do not see that the mutual conflicts between Saiva origins and Jaina origins cannot be simply wished away. Especially, considering the documented long history of antagonism between these two groups in southern India.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
