NamasteDr BVK Sastry.



.



The "charge on advaita sannyasa tradition for absolute innocence of
temple worship of elaborate worship and ritual traditions" was not mine."absolute innocence of temple worship of elaborate worship and ritual traditions" was a quote from Dr. Ganesan.



Your previous message was reflecting that misunderstanding. My " ????" was my surprise at that misunderstanding.



You were in factresponding to Dr. Ganesan . But you said that you were responding to me because you were under this misunderstanding. Hence the expression of surprise.



No more misunderstandings or surprises now.



Regards,



Nagaraj
