When I asked which authority says, I was particularly asking which Advaita Vedanta authority has the lines meaning

"a strict Advaita vedAnta monk is supposed not to stay at a particular place for more than a night or two".



KuTIcaka is the one who stays in a KuTI.



BahUdaka has no prescription of not to stay at a particular place for more than a night or two.



"*You are posing /repeating the question which I had put.*"



I did not repeat sir, I said "PRO-scribe" not "PRE-scribe" PRO-scribe means 'prohibit'



I asked,



'Where does it ***proscribe*** it either?' (Emphasis new)



It means,



"In which Advaita authority did you find temple construction/temple worship is prohibited?"



In which way a Vishnu temple evidence counters the claim by Ganeshji? Did he say, Vishnu temples are more inclusive?



Which Shaivite tradition are you talking about? Tamila Saiva tradition, Virashaiva tradition or Shivadvaita tradition?



If you are looking for Vedanta books prescribing temple construction, then please enlighten me which śakti viśiṣṭādvaita ***vēdānta*** text *prescribes*



temple construction/temple worship.



Which Vedanta book of any traditionprescribes temple construction/temple worship as part of its Vedanta discussion?



Prescribing temple construction/temple worship is not an expected part of a Vedanta book.



Its a methodological flaw to look for such prescriptions iin the books whose subject matter is not such prescriptions.



Advaita Vedanta practice is what Advaita Vedanta practitioners did, have been and are still doing. Textualism ignoring practice while studying spiritual traditions has been a serious lapse in many religious studies in general andindological religiousstudies in particular. Borrowing such flawed methodologies for the present discussions does not lead us to a right understanding.
