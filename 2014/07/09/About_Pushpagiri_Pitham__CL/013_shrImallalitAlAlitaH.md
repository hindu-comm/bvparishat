I've to say something here:  

As far as I know about shrIvidyA tantra-s I've seen that they become avadhUta, etc. but I've not seen a vidhi there for sannyAsa.  

Again, stories of such avadhUta-s tells that the took sannyAsa according to veda-s and practiced veda-vihita-dharm, and tAntrika-kriyA-kalApa, both.  
So, I wish to say that there appears no sannyAsa in those tantra-s.  

When they take sannyAsa and become avadhUta, there shrIvidyA mantra is merged in devI-praNava (because long will cause vixepa-AyAsa !! - seen in some tantra-s).  
If anyone has proof for sannyAsa according to Agama-tantra-s, please present it here so that we could dissect it.  

In this way, the base of question appears to be shattered.
