The verse is originally from Vālmīkīya Rāmāyaṇa (1.23.2). Historically it has been explained both ways.



If taken separately, suprajāḥ is taken as bahuvrīhi - śobhanā prajā putro yasyāḥ sā suprajāḥ. nityamasicprajāmedhayoḥ (PS 5.4.122) applies to result in asic suffix. suprajāḥ is then explained as an adjective of kausalyā. rāma, tvayā kausalyāḥ suprajāḥ, pūrvā sandhyā pravartate ... is the interpretation.



If taken as a compound, the karmadhāraya vigraha is to be taken - śobhanaścāsau prajā putraśceti suprajaḥ. Then ṣaṣṭhī tatpuruṣa compund kausalyāyāḥ suprajaḥ kausalyāsuprajaḥ. The vocative form then should have been kausalyāsupraja without the visarge. Govindarāja explains that one can either assume asic suffix in karmadhāraya as ārṣa usage or supāṁ sulukpūrvasavarṇāccheyāḍāḍyāyājālaḥ (PS 7.1.39).



Govindarāja in the Bhūṣaṇa explains both ways - uncoumpounded and compounded.



Nāgeśa in the Tilaka gives only one explanation in which the words are not compounded.



Māheśavratīrtha in the Tattvadīpikā gives both explanations.



Mādhavayogī in the Kataka prefers the compounded reading, and says that suprajā is not intended for kausalyā, no comments on grammar though.



Śivasahāya in the Śiromaṇi gives the reading kausalyāsupraja rāma.

  
This is also the first verse in Śrīsītārāmasuprabhātam of my Guru, and he gives both explanations inthe Hindi translation(like Govindarāja).
