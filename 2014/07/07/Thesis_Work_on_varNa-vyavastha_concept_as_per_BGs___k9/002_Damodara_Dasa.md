Hare Krishna.  
Respected Sirs,  
  
I am Damodara Das from ISKCON Salem, TN. We are trying to establish  
small model villages functioning on the basis of chAturvarNyam system  
as described in bhagavad-gItA i.e. guNa-karma-vibhAgaSaH.  
Thus we are researching on this topic for last 5 years. As we have to  
implement this principle in our community we won't be satisfied just  
to have a theoretical understanding of the matter but in stead need  
practical information and guidance. Thus the topic raised by Sriram  
will be very helpful if it is discussed thoroughly with good scholars.  
I am very enthusiastic to be a part of such a discussion both online  
and personally also.  
  
In my efforts I have come across one book named "Brahmana and  
Vaisnava" which is an essay written by the then renowned scholar and  
Gaudiya Vaisnava Acharya Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura  
(1920s). Following is the link to that:

I would also like to get the article mentioned by Sriram if possible.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
