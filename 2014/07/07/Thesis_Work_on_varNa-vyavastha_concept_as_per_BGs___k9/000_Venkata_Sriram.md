Namaste,



I am looking for detailed thesis work on the concept of chAturvarNa vyavastha in the lines of BG's guNa-karma vibhAga. If it is from traditional scholars, it would be better.



I have a short article on this concept by one of the greatest scholars of tarka & vedanta of Andhra Pradesh by name Br.Sri.Bulusu Appanna Sastry Gar which comes as a short introduction to his gita-bhashya.



regs,

sriram
