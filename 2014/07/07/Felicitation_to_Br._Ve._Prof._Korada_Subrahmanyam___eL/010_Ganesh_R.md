Dear Sirs,  
  

The memorial temple vidyaashankara at SRngEri has lot of vaiShNava sculptures that include the famed daSaavataara-s too. This perhaps cannot happen in any staunch Shaiva mutt. Only an advaita-vEdaanta mutt having equal regards for all the theistic sects of sanaatanadharma can have such an inclusive approach. Apart from this many inscriptional evidences have been shown by many scholars and much of this is available in Kannada. I request the scholars to review this.  
  

regards  
  
ganesh
