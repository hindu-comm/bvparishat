Though not connected with the topic on hand, I just want to say that  
when one reads the name of the Pushpagiri Pitham, one is reminded of the  
Saiva Matha situated at Pushpagiri in the medieval period; Amardaka,  
Golaki and Pushpagiri are the three great and widely popular Saiva  
Matha-s that had their Acharya lineages spread through out the  
Madhaydesa (Narmadaa river basin), the Andhra (especially the Kakatiya  
region) and then the Tamil country.  
Hundreds of inscriptions are spread through these regions describing the  
saiva Acharya-s, their activities and the royal patronage they received.  
  
Probably the present Pushpagiri Pitham had been converted into a Vedanta  
matha in the later period.
