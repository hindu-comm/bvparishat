"In the VP on the other hand he is free to give full scope to his own views".



\- In spite of Bhartrhari making it very clear from 2-481 to 2-488, that VP does not contain his own views but is a



preservation of



nyāyabīja-s/nyāyaprasthānamārga-s/āgama-s/vartma-s of pāṇini-vyāḍi time carried from saṅgraha through mahābhāṣya



to vākyapadīyam ,



why do we have to call Bhartrihari's words as his own views?



Following Bhartrihari, the word sphōṭa darśana is being used asthe synonym of pāṇinīyadarśana or vaiyākaraṇa



darśana. It is being used asthe name given to the pāṇinīya (vaiyākaraṇa)vision of self-truthrelation, pāṇinīya



(vaiyākaraṇa) epistemology, pāṇinīya (vaiyākaraṇa) ontology, pāṇinīya (vaiyākaraṇa)metaphysics, the pāṇinīya



(vaiyākaraṇa) model of cognition in general, pāṇinīya (vaiyākaraṇa) model of speechcognition in particular, pāṇinīya



(vaiyākaraṇa) model ofcreativity in general, pāṇinīyan model of speech creativity in particular.



It is in this sense thatvedānta or any other darśana does pūrvapakṣa to sphōṭa darśana.



dhvanyālōka isan example of how this general philosophy can be applied to specific cases such as literary semantics,



dr̥śyakāvya aesthetics andśravyakāvya aesthetics, particularly rasa -aesthetics. 



The phonetic aspect ofsphōṭa is only a special case of sphōṭa.



ākr̥ti, vyakti, buddhistha śabda are part of this special case. While dealing with this special case, Bhartrihari's claim is



that he is not adding any new concept like buddhistha śabda, but is just giving words to some of Patanjali's



ideas as carried by him from sangrahakāra.



With regard to meaning also there is a parallel concept called sampratyayārthadistinguished from bāhyārtha discussed



by Bhartrihari. But all these are, according to him, pāṇinīya ideas, not hisown.



Sorry if I deviated from the focus of the thread.



Othermembers may bring it back to track.
