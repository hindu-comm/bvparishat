Respected Scholars , Namaskar!



From the article by G .B. Palsule in the book Bhartrihari: Philosopher and Grammarian;

Editor Saroja Bhate etc



Mahabhashya of Patanjali (Mbh.). Mahabhashya DIpika (Dip) and VakyapadIya (VP) and Bhartrihari (Bh)



In the Dip, Bh was commenting on the Mbh. Now the Mbh has in all probability used the word Sphota only in a phonetic context. Further only two views, Aakriti and Vyakti, are mentioned in this context in the Mbh (Pratyahara Aahnika on Vaartikas 5-15 Vol I p 16-18). This may be the reason why Bh gives prominence to these views in DIp.



In the VP on the other hand he is free to give full scope to his own views. That is why he gives prominence to the buddhistha shabda there.



My question: There are many scholars of Mbh and Bh on this list. Could you please explain to me Aakriti, Vyakti and Buddhistha shabda in the context of Sphota as understood by Patanjali and Bhartrihari? Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
