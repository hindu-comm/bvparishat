Dear Aparna,

How are you ?

I find this WAVES Newsletter extremely informative.

  

My best regards to Dr. Shashai Tiwariji and her team of scholars.

Her effort and enthusiasm are very inspiring.

  

May I know the last date of sending ABSTRACT for the forthcoming WAVES conference as I am eager to attend it in the holy city of Varanasi.

Thank you and best wishes,

  

Dr. Soma Basu
