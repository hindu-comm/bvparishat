करं कृष्णमिवाचरति does not make sense in this context. That would mean "acts on/behaves with the कर (=hand) as if it (=the hand) were कृष्ण=black.” The hand cannot be compared to something black in this context, only the piece of coal can. Furthermore then the form would be कृष्णीयति which is not the reading.

True, something is amiss if अन्वय of कृष्णायते is taken with करम्. For when क्यङ् is ordained by कर्तुः क्यङ् सलोपश्च (पा॰सू॰ ३.१.११), the resulting नामधातु is अकर्मक or intransitive as per माधवीया धातुवृत्तिः and hence it cannot take an object. 

Here is माधवीया धातुवृत्तिः on कर्तुः क्यङ् सलोपश्च, after listing all कर्तरि –

शयेनायते .... (then all forms in ) ... उपमानकर्तुरिवोपमेयकर्तुः प्रत्ययान्ते धातावन्तर्भावात्तत्र लादयो भवन्ति। अकर्मकत्वाद्भावे च शयेनाय्य्ते। ...

One way to justify it is to take the अन्वय of करम् with दहति – note that दहँ भस्मीकरणे is सकर्मक (e.g. नैनं दहति पावकः) and needs an object which is missing here – hence करं दहति.

उष्णः अङ्गारः करं दहति शीतः च कृष्णायते – A hot piece of coal burns the hand, while a cold piece \[of the same\] acts as if it were black \[colour\] (i.e. stains the hand).

Or it may be a प्रामादिक प्रयोग.

What do the commentaries say?
