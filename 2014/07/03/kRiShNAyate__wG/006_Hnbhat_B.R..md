And in which case, even though the form looks alike, the विग्रहवाक्य would be करं कृष्णमिवाचरति and the क्यच् suffix would be by "उपमानादाचारे" resulting in the form कृष्णीयति।

  

The complete verse is in Hitopadesha:

  

दुर्जनेन समं सख्यं प्रीतिं चापि न कारयेत्।

उष्णो दहति चांगारः शीतः कृष्णायते करम्॥

  

Here there is something incompatible to grammar.

  

उष्णो दहति चांगारः शीतः कृष्णायते करम्॥  

  

Please explain the use of the क्यङ् in this case, as the agent is a अङ्गार when hot burns the hand and when it is cold it blackens it.

  

According to the meaning intended, it would take onlly क्यच् and would take कृष्णीयति करम्। and could not take क्यङ्.

The use of क्यङ् or क्यष् (under भृशादि) would take agent either अङ्गार or कर. and not करम् as the object of कृष्णायते\|
