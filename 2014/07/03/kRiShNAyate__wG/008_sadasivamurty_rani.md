Thanks to Prof. Ashok Aklujkar ji. For the corrections you suggested. Yes...by mistake I used the Nominative form of the wordकर\| As you said it should not beकर: and should be करम् only. It should be accusative form only.

But there is another doubt: While giving the sloka you said:कृष्णो दहति चाङ्गारो\| How

कृष्णाङ्गार can burn the hand?

Thanks to Prof. HN Bhat Ji also.

1\. Sir according to your posting there is a doubt about the agency
between अङ्गार and कर \| As explained by youअङ्गार only can be the agent of blackening and the object is कर\| Hence अङ्गार should be in Nominative case and कर which is being blackened should be in Accusative case.

2\. Should it beक्य़च् or क्यङ् ? is another question raised by you.

Here I would like to draw your kind attention to the following possibility:

As far as the functions are concerned क्य़च् is used in इच्छार्थ and क्यङ् is used in आचारार्थ\| Here अङ्गार in the act of blackening assumes the very character of BLACK and having become BLACK blackens the hand. This is a figurative attribute as in case ofलिम्पतीव तमॊङ्गानि वर्षतीवाञ्जनं नभ:। Thus the अङ्गार having becomeकृष्ण blackens the कर \|(करं कृष्णीकरोति )तथा करं कृष्णीकर्तुं अङ्गार: कृष्णायते (कृष्ण इवाचरति)।

As this isआचारार्थ I thinkक्यङ् can be the better choice.

Moreover, if the famous sloka of Pancatantra is to be supported क्यङ्
can be more preferable than क्य़च् as क्य़च् allows the Parasmaipadi Dhatvartha only and not the Atmane padi Dhatvarta.

In this context I would like to quote from Vacaspatya regarding the functions of क्य़च् and क्यङ्\|

क्य़च् - य - इच्छार्थे धात्वंशप्रत्यय:। समुदायान्तोदात्त:। पुत्रीयति।

क्य(ङ्)ष् - य - आचाराद्यर्थे धात्वंशप्रत्यय:।

ङित्वे आत्मनेपदम्। भृशायते।

षित्वे उभयपदम्। लोहितायते्-ति

I shall be happy to be enlightened by your further comments.

Warm regards to all.
