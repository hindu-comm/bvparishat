As far as my knowledge is concernbed this comes under sanadyanta dhatu vritti. Particularly comes in क्यङ् वृत्ति।

This is an adjective derived verb and used in the sense of blackens.

i.e. कृष्ण इवाचरतीति कृष्णायते।

उष्णो दहत्यङ्गारो शीत: कृष्णायते कर:। is a much heard example for this usage.

If I am wrong I may be corrected.

With warm regards, 

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
