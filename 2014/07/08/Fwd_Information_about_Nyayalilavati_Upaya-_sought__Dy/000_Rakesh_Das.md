In reference to the information about Upaya by Vardhamana asked by Rev. Prof. KVRK.

  

Vardhamana wrote all his Tikas under the name Prakasa that is also known as Upaya. This information is given in the book mentioned on pages 19 to 21. I have made a translation of that part. It is there in the attached file. Please go through this.
