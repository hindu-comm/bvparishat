I thank Dr. Gargeshwari.

One historical note. The verse in the AVP, a Saṃhitā known to Yāska and Pāṇini and in some mantras exhibiting close affinity with the Ṛgveda, should be the earliest occurrence. The AVŚ on the whole pre-supposes the AVP. And it (AVŚ 2.1.1)reads *yátra víśvaṃ bhávaty ékarūpam*/

Another point. The engraved citation on the northern gate of the Santiniketan Ashram, Visva Bharati, near the Prayer Hall could have been taken from the Yajurveda or the AVP, one cannot be sure. Though the Paippalāda-Saṃhitā was not well-known at that time, the version had appeared in the second kāṇḍa of the AVP edited on the basis of the unique birch-bark Kashmir ms by L.C.Barret in JAOS Vol.30 in 1910 with the reading :*yátra víśvaṃ bhávaty ékanaḍāṃ*. Barret (and Raghu Vira who followed Barret) wrongly read the actual reading *ékanaḷaṃ* as
*ékanaḍāṃ*. Though the whole version in the Kashmir ms was full of misreadings and lacunae, Barret had edited correctly with the reading *ékanīḍaṃ.* 

The Visva Bharati (at that time Brahmacharya Asram) Library subscribed to the JAOS from the beginning. So, theoretically, Tagore and Vidhusekhara Shastri, who helped Tagore in such matters, could have taken the pāda from the AVP 2.6.1 which then was available to the savants.
