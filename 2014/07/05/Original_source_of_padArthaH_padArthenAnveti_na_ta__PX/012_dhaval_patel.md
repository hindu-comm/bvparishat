Not directly related to the original query, but maybe relate to the discussion of अर्के चेन्मधु.  
 In Gujarati we have a phrase आकडे मध which means easily achievable. Here the Gujarati word आकडे corresponds to अर्के of sanskrit i.e. small poisonous shrub. So I suggest that the correct reading may be अर्के
