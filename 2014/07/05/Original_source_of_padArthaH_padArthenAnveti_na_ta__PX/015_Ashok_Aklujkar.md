As I recall, the late K. Kunjunni Raja published an article on arke/akke in the Adyar Library Bulletin several years ago. Can someone with easy access to the article send it as an email attachment or summarize its content?  
  
I do not think पदार्थः पदार्थेनान्वेति, न तदेकदेशेन is the same as the सामर्थ्य/असामर्थ्य or गमकत्व/अगमकत्व principle. The latter is a fact of life/language. A competent speaker (usually a native speaker) can serve as authority in regard to it. The former is a hermeneutical principle, specifically to be invoked when a choice is to be made between two understandings of a sentence. It advises an interpreter not to go against, as far as possible, an interpretation that preserves the unity of word and word meaning. It is a principle that must have developed in Miimaa.msaa and is (rightly) applied by the Vaiyaakara.nas whenever necessary. Its expression with a specific sentence might have taken place in a relatively later period, but it must have been known to the muni-traya of grammar in some form.  
  
Appealing to or pointing out the relation of पदार्थः पदार्थेनान्वेति, न तदेकदेशेन in the discussion of [saapek.sa](http://saapek.sa) samaasas such as deva-dattasya guru-kulam is understandable, but the principle does not determine if the specific usage is found, if its use should be continued / is recommended or if its meaning is X or Y (the meaning is whatever the competent speakers say its meaning is). How to articulate the problem the usage presents and how to solve the problem is the work area of the ;saastrakaaras, and that is where पदार्थः पदार्थेनान्वेति, न तदेकदेशेन enters as a general observation on the language under discussion (which abounds in compounding ).
