Yes all three are different, though related,principles. नागेश states that the principle of गमकत्व in the भाष्य (the principle of वृत्ति/विशेषण in the वार्त्तिक as per Dr. Korada) is theमूल (origin/root)of the principle पदार्थः पदार्थेन ...



If I may paraphrase the difference you pointed out, सामर्थ्य/असमार्थ्य and गमकत्व/अगमकत्व govern प्रयोगसाधुत्व, given a specific विवक्षा. Whereas पदार्थः पदार्थेन ... govern the अन्वय/शाब्दबोध, given a specific प्रयोग.



The corresponding roles (and similarties) in the principles can be compared to those in the designs of an encoder and decoder in a lossy communication system.



The priniciples aid in making the communication as lossless as possible - i.e. the resulting शाब्दबोध being as close to the original विवक्षा.
