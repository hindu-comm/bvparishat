Thanks again for your response Dr. Korada.



I think this is where there is a difference of opinion. Does Patañjali reject the Vārttika and propose a new principle of gamakatva? Or does he accept the Vārttika and offers gamakatva as an explanation for exceptions to the rule.



You rightly point out that Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśa have not stated that the Vārttika has been rejected. The counter-argument is that Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśa only explain portions of Mahābhāṣya and do not offer a full commentary (like Mallinātha does for Mahakāvyas) - hence their silence on acceptance of rejection of the Vārttika can be construed any way.



My first impression when I read the Vārttika and Bhāṣya along with Nāgeśa's comments was that the Patañjali was formulating a new principle (then I did not think about whether it was a rejection or an extension of the Vārttika) and Nāgeśa was explaining this new principle of Patañjali.



On reading S D Joshi's comments and thinking deeper, I seem to agree with his interpretation that the Patañjali rejects the Vārttika, maybe not in direct words but by advancing his own theory of gamakatva which can account for forms unexplained by the samarthatva.



Some more search into this on the Interney shows that there are more authors who seem to think the same that the Vārttika is being criticized or rejected -



The Syntax and Semantics of Sanskrit Nominal Compounds. Siniruddha Dash. University of Madras, 1995. p. 13: ... Since we cannot justify these compounds with the help of sāmarthya, and since gamakatva seems to account for everything, Patanjali thinks that gamakatva is really a better idea.



Kauṇḍabhaṭṭapraṇītaṃ vaiyākaraṇabhūṣaṇaṃ, Volume 1. Bhāratīya Vidyā Prakāśana, 1987. p. 350. ... the Bhāṣyakāra has rejected the Vārttika and solved the question of propriety or otherwise of such combinations as ऋद्धस्य राजपुरुषः, देवदत्तस्य गुरुकुलम्, &c. by the गमकत्व of the sense. In other words, if the sense is clear the compound is allowed.



Bhāshā, Volume 15. Central Hindi Directorate, 1975. p. 26. अगुरुपुत्रादीनाम् ... कि इन या ऐसे अपवादों को छोड़कर अन्यत्र उक्त नियम का अनुसरण करना चाहिए. वार्त्तिककार के इस प्रस्ताव की आलोचना करते हुए भाष्यकार कहते हैं कि ऐसा नियम बनाने की आवश्यकता नहीं है ... भाष्यकार के इस कथन से स्पष्ट है कि कहीं-कहीं समास से भी अविकल रूप में अर्थप्रतीति होने के कारण, वे असमर्थ समास को भी स्वीकार करते है। जहाँ गमकत्व नहीं है, वहाँ असमर्थ समास गलत है ...।



And finally to cite S D Joshi again - The Aṣṭādhyāyī. Vol. 5. (2.1.1 - 2.1.72). S D Joshi. Sahitya Akademi, 1996. p. 3: the principle sāpekṣam asamarthaṃ bhavati ... This principle is subsequently rejected, because Patañjali thinks that we can more easily manage by the principle of agamakatva ...



Thanks again for yourresponses - this has been a nice discussion with many points coming out.
