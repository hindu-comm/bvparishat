And here is S D Joshi on page 3 of *The Aṣṭādhyāyī. Vol. 5. (2.1.1 - 2.1.72)*. 1996: Sahitya Akademi, ISBN 9788126001453 –

8. Kātyāyana has composed 33 *Vārttikas* on the present rule. They are introduced after a long discussion by Patañjali. Questions discussed here deal with the character of the rule, whether *paribhāṣā* or *adhikāra* (SA, Bh. Nos. 3-13), and with the purpose of the word *samartha* taken in the sense of 'semantically connected' (SA, Bh. Nos. 14-40). If the purpose of the word *samartha* is to lay down semantic connection as the prerequisite of cp.-formation, then this meets with difficulties in the case of three word compounding. The stock example is furnished by the phrase *mahat kaṣṭaṃ śritaḥ* 'who has landed in great misfortune' (SA, Bh. No. 16). Here the question of internal construction is introduced. See SA, n. 33, and Notes (20) and (22). Also, to prevent undesired cp.-formation, the principle *sāpekṣam asamarthaṃ bhavati* 'that which requires (a word outside the cp. for semantic completion) is (regarded as) semantically unconnected' (SA, Bh. No. 26c). This principle is subsequently rejected, because Patañjali thinks that we can more easily manage by the principle of *agamakatva* 'the assumption that (in a given case the cp. and the corresponding wordgroup) do not convey the same meaning' (SA, Bh. No. 37c). For *(a)gamakatva* compare BDA, Introduction, under 2.9.
