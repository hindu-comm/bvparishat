नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

My curiosity arose from this:नागेशstarts this comment withभाष्यकारो न्यायं दर्शयति – “अगमकत्वादित्यादिना”…. विद्वान् मिश्रः  

  

----

  

The problem is this --

  

Panini said 'समर्थः’ , which is pregnant with meaning --

  

if there is no एकार्थीभावसामर्थ्यम् then do not go ahead with making a समास -

कष्टं श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः

  

now in the sense of महत् कष्टं श्रितः there cannot be a समास -because (as explained in मञ्जूषा I quoted) - कष्टश्रितः offers a complete meaning - but if another word like महत् is there , which has got आकाङ्क्षा with a word, that is already involved in वृत्ति, such as कष्ट, then , since कष्टश्रित cannot have the एकार्थीभावसामर्थ्यम्( the capacity to express a single unitary meaning - implied is ' without expectancy') it becomes असमर्थ ।

  

The above procedure is acceptable to all - मुनित्रयम् et al.

  

Having ruled thus Panini employed one or two असमर्थसमासs -(सुड्) अनपुंसकस्य etc. thereby suggesting that - if there is no any hitch to the understanding then there can be an 'असमर्थसमास’।

  

In usages also we have देवदत्तस्य गुरुकुलम् etc ( this aspect is explained in वाक्यपदीयम्(पद-वृत्ति) by two verses quoted by Kaiyata earlier).

  

So in order to see that - what is meant by Panini by ruling ’समर्थः, and using अनपुंसकस्य , ie there cannot be an असमर्थसमास, but with some
exceptions , Patanjali suggested अगमकत्वम् - if there is गमकत्वम् (बोधकत्वम्) then there can be a समास , but not everywhere .

  

Now the वार्तिकम् 1 , 2 & 3 -- सविशेषणानां वृत्तिर्न , वृत्तस्य वा विशेशणयोगो न , अगुरुपुत्रादीनाम् - these explain what was meant by Panini by the term 'समर्थः and the usage’ ।

  

In case 'वृत्तस्य वा विशेशणयोगो न ’ is accepted in toto there cannot be an असमर्थसमास , so Patanjali , while accepting ( यश्चेहार्थो वाक्येन गम्यते ... नासौ जातुचित् समासेन गम्यते....) the वार्तिकम् , and the next ,officially certifies some exceptions.

  

Nagesa says - भाष्यकारो न्यायं दर्शयति - अगमकत्वादित्यादिना।(आदिना is significant)\| दर्शयति = explains

  

Therefore the वार्तिकम् and the न्याय , viz. पदार्थः पदार्थेन ., are there to stay.

That'swhy they are not stamped as प्रत्याख्यात by either Kaiyata or Nagesa .

This is a very important न्याय to check all असमर्थसमासs and as such quoted across many Systems , including तन्त्रम्।

  

It is recommended that any issue should be discussed taking all major works into consideration.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
