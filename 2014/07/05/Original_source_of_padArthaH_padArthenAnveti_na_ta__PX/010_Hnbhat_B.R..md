According to Apte's Dictionary:

  

अक्कः akkaḥ अक्कः A corner of a house;**अक्के**चेन्मधु विन्देत किमर्थं पर्वतं व्रजेत् ।  

  

it is masculine gender and he cites the same verse as example. This was discussed in our group long ago:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/hjwT_Dd6kds/Isxbwkju5d8J>  

  

The variant forms in the same quotation are available, atka, arka, etc. "arka" is a correct word in Sanskrit, the other forms need some more effort to justify the meaning. Apte has given as found in Shankarabhashya, as in the quotation given in the topic V Subrahmanyam has raised the qustion. But no grammatical derivation is given. May be considered as पृषोदरादि from अत्क। \> अन्तिक = nearby. by वर्णविपर्यय। = HANDY.
