I can't understand why Apte's meaning suggested could not be given? Only that it could not be given any satisfactory grammatical derivation, but fits the context well of the purpose of the proverbial statement. Apte could not give any Sanskrit derivation and that need not suggest any word borrowed from any regional language without any clue. There is no problem for Panini, in accepting अव्युत्पन्नप्रातिपदिक, but only for the Nairukta's and his followers among the grammarians like शाकटायन who need a stem to get a work.
