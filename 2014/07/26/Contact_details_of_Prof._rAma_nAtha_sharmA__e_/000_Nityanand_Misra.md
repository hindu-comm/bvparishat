Namaste  
  

I wish to contact Prof. Rāma Nātha Śarmā. It appears he is no longer with the University of Hawaii's Department of Indo-Pacific Languages and Literatures. I could not find his contact listed on the the department's academic staff page on the UoH website -  
  
<http://ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu/about-ipll/academic-staff/>  
  
Can somebody please respond to me **off the list** with his email and/or phone contact? Off the list, as he may not want his personal contact details to appear on a public mailing list.  
  
I believe he was at the University of Hyderabad not too long ago.  
  
Thanks, Nityānanda
