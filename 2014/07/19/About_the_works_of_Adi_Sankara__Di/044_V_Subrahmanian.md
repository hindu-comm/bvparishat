Dear Sri Ganesan,  
  
In your reply to Sri Vidyasankar you say:  
  
//Be aware of the fact that these Sankaravijayam-s were not composed several centuries ago, but were composed only after the 16th century.//  
  
And in the above reply to Sri Sastry you say that the sumadhvavijaya is inspired by the Sankaravijayam!! Evidently, you are unaware of the fact that according to the Madhvas, the sumadhvavijaya was composed by a contemporary of Madhva, Sri Narayana Pandita. And Madhva's period is generally agreed to be 1238 - 1317/8 AD.

Also, it is believed that the mādhavīya shankaravijaya is only an abridged version of a pre-existing, now not extant, elaborate work.
Each chapter of the existing work says that it is a chapter in the 'सङ्क्षेपजये’...
