My guess turned out to be correct - it was Pathak who concluded the date was 788 to 820 CE based on a manuscript he found in 1882. Here is the attached paper. The citation is  
  
K. B. Pathak (1882). *The Date of Śaṁkarācārya*. Indian Antiquary, Volume 11, 1882, pp 174-175.  
  
Dasgupta's first volume came out in 1922, and it is likely the date given by Pathak'a manuscript was agreed upon by historian then.  
  
Nakamura wrote more than half a century after Dasgupta. He begins his 40-page treatment of the date in Part Two (The dates of Śaṅkara and contemporary Philosphers) of Chapter Two (The Chronological Divisions of Early Vedānta Philosphy) with Pathak's article. Nakamura writes that as the birth year tallied with that given in the works *Āryavidyāsudhākara* and *Śaṁkaramandārasaurabha*, and hence was probably accepted as standard. Nakamura's conclusion is eight century and a much longer life span than the 32 year span available in traditional accounts. For more details one may refer pages 48 to 90 of A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy (MLBD, 1990 edition, ISBN 9788120806511).
