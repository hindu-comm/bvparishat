Ajit ji!

Thanks for your concern by giving a word to mail me the bibliography the research works available on Sri Adi Sankara.

I also thank you for your detailed mail drafted by you with lot of patience in response to my previous questions.

At the same time I have again a few questions over your latest mail.

1. What you said about the SAMATA BOOKS is agreeable.

I agree that you might have seen even The works of Sankara published in the year 1937 by Oriental Book Agency, Pune.

But have you seen the complete works of Adi Sankara published by Sadhana Grantha Mandali of Tenali in the name Sankara Grantha Ratnavali? In how many volumes have they published Sankara's works? I am curiously asking you because I am still in the process of collecting them all. Those series of books were first published by them in the early fifties and sixties as far as I observed.

I believe that you must have seen them all as you have made a statement
"The other publications which you mention are a compilation of works ascribed to be written by Shankaracharya and not written by by him."

Otherwise could it be possible to state so firmly. So I request you to
give the source where all those books of Sadhana Grantha Mandali are available. They are not available as a complete set even in Sadhana Grantha Mandali of Tenali at present. Hence I ask you.  

2. In your previous mail there is a statement about the ability of Adi Sankara to write that number of Works depending on his short span of life.

"It would have been impossible for a person who had a 32 year life span ( If one were to believe in the hagiographical works ) to have written so much even if he were to write day in and day out."  

Could the age of a person be mark of once efficiency of producing volumes of writings? In our contemporary times we have living examples with us who wrote several hundreds books even at their young age.  

I state here a few examples from just our previous generations:

1.Krishna Murthy Sastry of Sripada family, lived between 1866 – 1960, was a native of[Devarapalli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devarapalle,_West_Godavari_district "Devarapalle, West Godavari district")of[West Godavari district](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Godavari_district "West Godavari district"). He was the first[poet laureate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet_laureate "Poet laureate")of[Andhra Pradesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh "Andhra Pradesh").

Maha Mahopadyaya, Kala Prapurna, Kavi Raju, Kavi Sarvabhouma, Kavi Brahma, Andhra Vyasa, Abhinava Srinatha, Veda Vidya Visarada, Prasanna Valmiki and Viswa Kavi were his Titles.

He is a famous poet in Andhra Pradesh, and is the first*Asthana Kavi*of Andhra. He is the first person who translated all the three main scriptures Ramayana, Mahabharat, and Bhagavatham into telugu (He made verse to verse translation of these three noble works from Sanskrit to Telugu), and he wrote more than 100 books in both Telugu and Sanskrit.  

  

2.**Bellamkonda Ramaraya kavi**(1875-1914 AD)  

     Sri Rama Raya Kavi,   to VishishTaadvaita sampradaya was a HayagrIva Upaasaka.  It seems when he was about 16 years Lord Hayagriva first appeared in a dream and asked him to take a mantra and yantra from a
     particular person/place.  Following this,
    Rama Raya Kavi did the japa/upasana for some years and again, this time, got a pratyaksha sAkShAtkAra of Lord Hayagriva.  In one of his works he writes that the Lord Hayagriva is seated beside him and he is only writing what the Lord is saying to him.

    The Kavi wrote about 148 illustrious works in his very short life  and the family is bringing out in a phased manner the available works.  They are also on the move to collect the works which they suspect are available with many sources.

    3. KAVI SAMRAT ViswanadhaSatyanarayana

    (10 September 1895 – 18 October 1976)

    Viswanatha's literary works includes 30 poems, 20 plays, 60 novels, 10 critical estimates, 200 Khand kavyas, 35 short stories, three playlets, 70 essays, 50 radio plays, 10 essays in English, 10 works is Sanskrit, three translations, 100 introductions and forewords as well as radio talks. Some of his poems and novels have been translated intoEnglish,Hindi,Tamil,Malayalam,UrduandSanskrit.

    There are hundreds of poets and scholars of this kind through out India.

    HERE MY QUESTION IS: Should the "Span of Life" be a criterion to decide the FACULTY OF IMAGINATION (PRATIBHA) OF a poet?

    When all the above poets are able to produce
     hundreds of literary writings in their single life time could it be difficult to Adi Sankara to write that number of works?

    I am much and much tired having seen such Sankara's Life Span based assumptions of modern scholars in doubting his ability of writing such a large number of writings.

    I SINCERELY APPRECIATE AND THANK YOU FOR ONE OF YOUR STATEMENTS :

    "It is unlikely he would have written many of the prakarna granthas for the philosophical points dealt in many of them is in variance with Brahma Sutra Bhashya."

    It is really a worthy observation with good research value. If any text maintains variance from the other popular writings of an author it can be concluded that it would not have been written by that author. I agree with you. Such observations will surely help in research pursuits.

    With warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
