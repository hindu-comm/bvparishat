Thanks, Nityanandaji! Please give me time as I am heavily engaged for a few days. Vetter is on shelf as I left that study long ago. But I shall come back. It may take some time to scan the monographs  
Unfortunately it is impossible for me to renew the study as Sunilji requests.I welcome new research but personally for me it is a closed chapter.
