Ah, those who would like to date Sankara to the 5th century BCE would also like to date gautama the buddha to the 17th or 18th century BCE, withnAgArjuna placed at some other time in between. I don't agree with any of these proposed dates,because I think this leads to many more huge problems for dates in Indian history. However I have to grant that, under this scenario, thelimited problemof dating Sankara before nAgArjuna does not arise!



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
