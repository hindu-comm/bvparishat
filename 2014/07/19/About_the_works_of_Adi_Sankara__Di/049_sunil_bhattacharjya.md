Dear Ganeshanji,

I am questioning the very same attitude of the SankarAdvaita followers which at one breath adores the uncompromising logic and rationality of Sankara and in the next breath, tolerates the spinning around of incongruous stories in the form of Sankaravijayam-s abounding in myth-mongering !

If you are referring to the story of the "parakayapravesha", it has to be interpreted in the proper perspective. Leaving ones own body and travelling with the astral body is possible for the Yogis and such stories are there in the Mahabharata, when Lord Krishna took Arjuna to Lord Shiva and also when Jayadratha received boons from Lord Shiva in his dreams. Adi Shankara went into samadhi and his body was left behind and protected by his disciples. He revived the dead king by his yogic powers and later on when his disciples, in a yogic way contacted him, he returned to his body in time. If you do not believe in the yogic state and its possibilities you have to state it directly without casting any aspersion on the Advaitins in general.  
  

As regards the prejudice you are attributing to the Advitins, it is not there. For the advaitins there is no difference between Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva at all in the advaitic sense, even though they may not shout that from the roof-top, whereas that is not so in case of the non-advaitic vedantins.  
  

Regards,
