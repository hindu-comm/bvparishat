Dear Sirs,  
  

Regarding the differences between Buddhism and Shankara-vEdaanta, the great Saint Sri SacchidaanandEndra-sarasvati has written a wonderful book in Sanskrit by name "Saankara-prakriyaabhaaskaraH" and recently its Kannada translation is done by Sri AdvayaanandEndra-sarasvasti.  
  

To establish the Vedic roots of Buddhism, one can refer to the books of Ananda K.Koomaraswamy (Hinduism and Buddhism, The gospel of Buddha), BladEva upaadhyaaya (Bauddha-darshan),G. C.Pande ( Bauddhadharma ka itihaas) etc.,  
  

regards  
  
ganesh
