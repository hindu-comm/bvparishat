There are innumerable advaita-friendly nāma-s in the Sri Lalitāsahasranama: mithyājagadadhiṣṭhānā, nirdvaitā dvaitavarjitā, nirbhedā bhedanāśinī and so on.

It would be interesting to note the usage of Sureshwaracharya in the Naiṣkarmyasiddhi:  
  
तथा भगवत्पादीयमुदाहरणम् .  
"सुषुप्ताख्यं तमोऽज्ञानं बीजं स्वप्नप्रबोधयोः .  
आत्मबोधप्रदग्धं स्याद्बीजं दग्धं यथाभवम् "..  
४३..  
एवं गौडैर्द्राविडैर्नः पूज्यैरयमर्थः प्रभाषितः .  
अज्ञानमात्रोपाधिस्सन्नहमादिदृगीश्वरः .. ४४..  
  
  

He refers to Shankara as 'Bhagavatpāda' and also as 'drāviḍa'. It is significant that he implies two 'deśa-s', countries, gauḍa (for gauḍapāda) and drāviḍa (for shankara), in the respectful plural and also as pūjya to him.
