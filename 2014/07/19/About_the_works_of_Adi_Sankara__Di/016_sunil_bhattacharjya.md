One Mr. Pathak found some manuscript in the 19th century, which mentioned about one Nava-Shankara, who took birth in 788 CE and Pathak published a paper on that. That was approved by Prof. Max Muller, who identified Nava-Shankara with Adi Shankara. Kanchi Kamakoti Pitha probably calls this Nava-Shankara as Abhinava-Shankara and thinks that he was a great scholar, born much later than Adi Shankara. If we accept this view it is quite possible that this Nava-Shankara could have written quite a number of works, which are now being attributed to Adi Shankara.
