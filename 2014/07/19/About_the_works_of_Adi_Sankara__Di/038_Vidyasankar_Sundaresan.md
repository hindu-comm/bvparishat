Please read the paper. I have not omitted any of the major Sankaravijaya texts from analysis. Also, please note, the said text does not refer to Abhinavagupta of the Kashmir Saiva tradition. It talks of one navagupta whom it places in Kamarupa, i.e. Assam.Needless to say, no historical value for the purposes of chronology can be attached to such descriptions, no matter what text they occur in.

Dr. Ganesan, this really takes the cake. Please point to one "rational" text among the loads of hagiographies the world over. Have you considered that there is always a lot of fantastic and non-historical details in traditional accounts of the lives of\*all\* religious figures, no matter what religion they represent?For example, would you like to ask the same question about rationality and fairy tales with respect to Tamil texts like Sekkizhar's Periyapuranam or Paranjyotiyar's Tiruvilaiyadal Puranam? Unlike you, however, I will not ask Tamil Saiva siddhAntin-s to throw these books overboard!



For that matter, step outside the hagiographical genre and look at various origin stories across the world. Would you like to talk about the irrationality that is embedded in accounts of the parting of the Red Sea, or the birth ofa son of godfrom avirgin,or the origins of Tibetan royalty from a one-footed creature with webbed feet and a long tongue, or the Japanese royalty from the sun goddess, or our own Indian royal dynasties from the sun and the moon? What purpose have such fairy tales served? I have one answer - they have anchored entire civilizations, ordered vast collections of human beings across great distances, given birth to wonderful art, the list goes on.

Since when did this discussion about the works attributed to Sankara's authorshiptransform itself into polemic against texts that seek to glorify Sankara, according to the conventions of their times?Do save a thought for the fact that your suggestion reveals nothing more than your own prejudice against the Sankaran tradition as alsothe conventions of the times you live in.You expect texts written in India, several centuries ago, to be biographies and histories as understood in the 20th and 21st century.



If you want to start throwing texts overboard, please start with cleaning out your own backyard.Again, sorry to be so blunt, but you leave me no choice. My apologies to others who are reading this thread.

Just one question. So what?



Story spinning andmyth makingis an ongoing process. It happens every second of every day. If you would like to criticize specific people for this, that is a different story. Do not project a false picture of the entire spectrum of admirers of Sankara and followers of advaita vedAnta.
