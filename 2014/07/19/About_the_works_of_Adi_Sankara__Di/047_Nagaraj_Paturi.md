1. Should all the inscriptions in which miracles are described be thrown overboard, with their translation, research etc., beingstopped? Should
records of British Gazetteers , for example, the one in which Sir Thomas Munroe describes miracles 'seen' by him be thrown overboard

2. Throughout, the pro-śankara contributors have been callingśankaravijayams as hagiographic texts only. By using that word, they were already conveying that their view of śankaravijayams was that those are compilations of legendsonly andneed not necessarily be true accounts of the past. Then who is being counteredthrough the argument that śankaravijayams have 'fairy tales'?



3. ‘Fairy tale’ is not the right word in this context. ‘Legend’ is the right word. A ‘legend’ is by definition a narrative which has apparently unbelievable content and content in it that may not stand a historical scrutiny. It would be historical ignorance to construe legends as history. At the same time it would be cultural anthropological ignorance to dismiss legends as not worthy of study at all.
