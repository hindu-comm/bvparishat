Dear Prof. Rani,



At the outset, let me state a broad principle (my personal opinion) that a traditional approach to this question cannot and should not rule out the possibility that all that is attributed to "Sankaracharya" is not due to "Adi Sankaracharya." The very reason he is "Adi" is that there have been other Sankaracharya-s later, and it stands to reason that many of them also composed bhAshya-s, vivaraNa-s, prakaraNa grantha-sand stotra-s. The article by Paul Hacker, whichSri Nityanand Misra referenced, explicitly draws attention to the fact that later titular Sankaracharya-s could have been the authors of many of these texts. Hacker also postulates that it was vidyAraNya who created the institution of titular Sankaracharyas, but more on that at the end of this post.



In the following,I apologize for citing two of my own papers below, but it is in the interest of aiding a discussion.It is not my intention to toot my own horn here.



1\. A good comprehensive review of the authorship issue may be found in Sengaku Mayeda's introduction to his translation of the upadeSasAhasri. Indeed, in my estimation,Prof. Mayeda is the only scholar in the world who has consistently applied the criteria proposed by Hacker to judge the attribution of various texts to Adi Sankara. For example, he has examined the pada and vAkya bhAshyas on kenopanishat and found both to be authentic.



2\. The Vani Vilas series, and therefore the derivative Samata edition, do not include the SvetASvatara bhAshya. There is a tradition about SankarAnanda, counted among one of the gurus of vidyAraNya, that he chose to comment upon key upanishat texts for which Adi Sankara had not written bhAshya-s, starting with kaushItakI and SvetASvatara. Therefore, theSvetASvatara bhAshya that is currently available can be seen as having an internaltraditional argument against its attribution to Adi Sankara. Similarly, the yogasUtra bhAshya vivaraNa seems quite unknown to the tradition that has transmitted the various advaita worksof Adi Sankara, although Paul Hacker accepts it as probably authentic. It has been argued that this text could actually have been written by someone from the noteworthy Nambudiri family of Payyur Mana in northern Kerala. Please see notes in thetranslation of this textby Dr T S Rukmani (Munshiram Manoharlal, 2001) and the PhD dissertation of Kengo Harimoto (U Penn, 1999)that has a critical edition of the commentary on the first pada of the yogasUtra. Kengo Harimoto is working on publishing this and his continuing work on this text asa book.



3\. Also, from within the advaita vedAnta tradition, Sri SaccidAnandendra sarasvatI of Holenarsipur (Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya) has argued that only the bhAshya-s on the prasthAna traya and upadeSasAhasrI were written by Adi Sankara. Please note thatmany of the traditional paNDita-s from Mattur consider themselves disciples of this Swami and his subsequent lineage. Please also note that his stance is not derivative of recent Western scholarship. It could rather be the other way round, as Hacker's paperspecifically quotes his pUrvASrama name and work, under a section titled Pandita-sammati.



4\. Please also see my paper in the journal Philosophy East and West, titled**What Determines Sankara's Authorship? The Case of the Pancikarana**, 2002, 52(1), 1-35. If you do not have library access to this journal and would like a copyof this article, please let me know.In brief, I haveargued that Hacker's criteria for determining authorship need to be revisited and updated in a more nuanced manner, because (a) they have been selectively applied so far, against all texts outside the ones listed in the above point, and (b)they do not lead to unambiguous conclusions. When you consider various discussions from scholars like Tilmann Vetter, Madelaine Biardeau, Daniel Ingalls, Kunjunni Raja and G C Pande, it becomes obvious that better ways are needed to address this problem. And I have outlined one possible alternative method, by considering the arguments for and against attributing the prakaraNa grantha called pancIkaraNa to Adi Sankara.



5\. Regarding the title shaNmata sthApanAcArya, please note that this title is not even present in any of the traditional birudAvalI-s of the SankarAcArya pITha-s. There is a "shaD-darSana-sthApanAcarya" title given to vidyAraNya, and by extension, to his lineage successors in various institutions in the southern part of India, but this refers to the standard list of six darSana-s and has nothing to do with the shaN-mata of Saiva, vaishNava etc.



6\. Regarding the 1969 conference proceedings that Sri Ajit Gargeshwari cited: My personal opinion, for whatever it is worth, is that beyond a feel-good factor for some groups, this publication will not add scholarly value to any discussion. There are numerousSankaravijaya texts available and people often say thatdescriptions of shaNmata sthApana come from these texts. However, this is not true, becausethe reality is that almost all these texts say nothing about shaNmata.The only one that could be seen as coming close is the Sankaravijaya of anantAnandagiri, which happens to bethe most contentious such text within the tradition. First printed from Calcutta in the 1870s, it has always been rejected by Sringeri authorities, for numerous reasons.The chapters where it describesshaNmata sthApana are full of fanciful and ahistoricalaccounts and have been accused, by various scholars,of having been heavily tampered with. Surprisingly,this textincludes not the kaumAra, but the kApAlika mata, as the sixth tradition that was accepted by Adi Sankara. Interestingly enough, while Saiva, SAkta, gANapatya, saura and kApAlika mata-s get one leader each, all of them supposedly direct disciples of Adi Sankara, the vaishNava mata alone gets two such leaders, but with a narrowly south Indian focus. anantAnandagiri says that Sankara sent out one disciple named lakshmaNa, an amSAvatAra of AdiSesha, to Kanchipuram in the east,and another called hastAmalaka, an amSa of vAyu, to rajatapITha, i.e. Udupi,in the west, in order to teach vaishNava modes of worship, including UrdhvapuNDra/gopIcandana dhAraNa, SaraNAgati and tapta-mudrA dhAraNa. It should be obvious to even a casual reader that this "lakshmaNa" is really rAmAnujAcArya and this "hastAmalaka" is really madhvAcArya.



Dr. Veezhinathan, editor of the 1970 edition from U Madras, has a footnote which theorizes that perhaps some "tAntrika vaishNava-s" have interpolated these descriptions into these chapters, but I, for one, fail to see why any vaishNava would have wanted to subordinate rAmAnuja and madhva to Sankara in this manner. It seems far more likely to me that any possible text-tampering had to have been done not by a vaishNava but by some self-described andshort-sighted follower of Sankara.The entire description in this text really comes across as clumsy polemics from one group of south Indian smArta-s against SrIvaishNava-s and mAdhva-s, through an anachronisticstory of how Adi Sankara was directly the guru of the leaders of both these vaishNava traditions. In either case, it follows that a shAnmata sthApana description is most probably alien to the original version of this Sankaravijaya textas well. If that is the case, then we have to conclude that there is not even one Sankaravijaya that can provide solidtextual support for connecting Adi Sankara with shaNmata sthApana. It is just something that has got established in the popular imagination through repetition by kathAkAra-s, with no basis even in the hagiographic texts. This is akin tohow in the Garhwal region they say that Adi Sankara fought against Buddhists usingboth Sastra andSAstra. It makesfor nice alliteration and we all know that Sankara definitely used SAstra, but it is anybody's guess what Sastra he may have used. For a more detailed discussion, please see my paper in the International Journal of Hindu Studies, **Conflicting hagiographies and history: the place of Śaṅkaravijaya texts in Advaita tradition**, 2000, 4(2), 109-184.



7\. With respect to the stotra-s attributed to Adi Sankara, there has been at least one genuineacademic attempt to analyze their authorship. A 1976 paper by Robert Gussner in the Journal of the American Oriental Society concludes, if I remember right, that the dakshiNAmUrti stotra (viSvaM darpaNadRSyamAna nagarItulyaM ...) is the only one that could be authentic, based on stylistic comparison with the verse chapters of upadeSasAhasrI. To me, this is an interesting conclusion because there is no SArdUlavikrIDita usage in all of upadeSasAhasrI, so although Gussner's paper has the word stylometric in its title, it is not quite about the poetic meter. However, for a critique of Gussner's methodology, results and rejection of some other important stotra-s, please see G C Pande's book, **Life and Thought of Śaṅkarācārya**, (Motilal Banarsidass, 1998, latest reprint 2011).



8\. Finally, please note that kalpataru, amalAnanda's commentary on vAcaspati miSra's bhAmatI, cites at least two verses that are found only in prapancasAra, attributing them to the "AcArya." amalAnanda had to have lived in the 13th century, as he mentions Krishna (Kannara) and Mahadeva, the Yadava kings of Devagiri (later Daulatabad), as his patrons.I only offer these details here because scholars who research tAntrika texts and traditions, like Andre Padoux, Alexis Sanderson and Paul Mueller-Ortega, as also many from India who often cite these Western scholars, seem to be totally unaware of this reference.I can dig up the exact details if necessary, butthat will take some time. WhenI last made a note of it, itwas more than a decade ago. What I would like to emphasize here is that a "tAntrika" text attributed to Adi Sankara has been citedin an earlysub-commentary on the brahmasUtra bhAshya, and that such internal textual references have not been adequately accounted for in the academic debate so far. For example, if one were to argue that amalAnanda's citation proves only that prapancasAra was known in the 13th century as a composition of"Sankaracharya," one would haveto accept that there were titular "Sankaracharya-s" in India before the 13th century, certainly much before vidyAraNya supposedly created such a tradition (a la Hacker's thesis). And iftitular Sankaracharya-s existed before the 13th century, then one would also have to presume the existence of institutionsspecializing in the study and teaching of advaita vedAnta, i.e. something akin to what we know today as pITha-s/maTha-s, again a century before the earliest tangible material evidence emerges for any maTha-s in the advaita vedAnta sampradAya.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
