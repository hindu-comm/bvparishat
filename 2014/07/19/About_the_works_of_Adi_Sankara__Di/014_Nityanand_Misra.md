for some perspectives on this.



There is nothing new or unusual in postulating that many works composed in the name of Śaṅkarācārya are of later authors and not Śaṅkarā, especially when hundreds of such works are available and many historical persons have used the title Śaṅkarācārya. The last aspect is also seen in compositions of Sikh Gurus almost all of whom have composed the name Nānaka (name of the first Guru) in the Guru Grantha Sahib. Many works are available in the name of Kālidāsa (e.g. the "full" Kumārasambhava with seventeen cantos, Śrutabodha, etc), Tulasīdāsa (e.g. Hanumān Aṣṭaka) and other authors whose authorship has been put into question.
