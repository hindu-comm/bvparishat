Thank you Ajit ji and Sunil Ji for the valuable information you extended.

What about the popular stotras like Bhaja govindam, Sivanadna Lahari and Kanaka Dhara stava ?

What is the historic value of calling him Shanmata Sthapakacharya?

Should we conclude that he hasn't praised the Gods like Ganesha, Siva, Vishnu and others?
