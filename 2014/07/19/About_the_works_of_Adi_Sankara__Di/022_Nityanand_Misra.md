Firstly, for Sunil Ji,it would not be a good idea to mix traditional beliefs and modern historical studies. If somebody as per traditional beliefs places Śaṅkara in 5^(th) century BCE and discount modern history, that is completely fine. However, as per the history \[agreed upon today\], Śaṅkara certainly came after Nāgārjuna (second and third century CE), Vasubandhu (fouth century CE) and Dignāga (fifth and sixth century CE).

Secdondly, for Vidyasankar Ji, more than the internal evidence, there is ample external evidence which contradicts claims placing Śaṅkara before Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu. That external evidence is the widely held position by historical scholars from most traditional Indian philosphical schools (not including Advaita for obvious reasons)– and a positionwhich John Grimes calls "undeniable"– that the works of Gauḍapāda and Śaṅkara have elements “borrowed from” those of Nāgārjuna, Vasubandhu and Dignāga.

Disclaimer: This is nothing new or controversial, and my Advaitin friends are requested to not burn me at the stake for stating what has been published many times over.

Whether one agrees with this position or not is a completely different thing, but one cannot deny the fact that right from Bhāskara to Yāmuna to Vallabha to Vijñānabhikṣu down to modern writers like Surendranath Dasgupta, Richard King, Hajime Nakamura, Eliot Deutsch, TMP Mahadvan, John Grimes etc have held that Gauḍapāda and Śaṅkara lived after Nāgārjuna, Vasubandhu and Dignāga. Nakamura even cites the use of the phrase *Mahāyānikapakṣa* (p. 121 of A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy, 1990, ISBN 9788120806511) by Padmapāda, a direct disciple of Śaṅkara, essentially proving that the Mahāyāna system was an established principle at the time of Śaṅkara.

Numerous references can be cited on this, I will limit myself to one –

Here is Surendranath Dasgupta on page 418 of A History of Indian Philosophy (Volume 1) –

“About the period 780 A.D. Gauḍapāda revived the monistic teaching of the Upaniṣads by his commentary on the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad in verse called *Māndūkyakārikā.* His disciple Govinda was the teacher of Śaṅkara (788 — 820 A.D.).”

And here is Dasgupta again on pages 493-494:

“Śaṅkara and his followers borrowed much of their dialectic form of criticism from the Buddhists. His Brahman was very much like the śūnya of Nāgārjuna … The debts of Śaṅkara to the self-luminosity of the Vijñānavāda Buddhism can hardly be overestimated … I am led to think that Śaṅkara’s philosophy is largely a compound of Vijñānavāda and Śūnyavāda Buddhism with the Upaniṣad notion of the permanence of self superadded.”

I do not know of any modern historian or author who places Śaṅkara before Nāgārjuna, Vasubandhu, or Dignāga.
