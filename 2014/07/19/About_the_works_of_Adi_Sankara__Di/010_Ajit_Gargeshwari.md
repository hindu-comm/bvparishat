Except the Digvijayas composed in the 16 century and the traditions based on beleif there is other history or historical records to call Shankra a Shanmata sthapakcharya.  
  
PS: This is my personal view I am expressing it with the hope it will not create any further controversy. This statement of mine is also not free from controversy either.
