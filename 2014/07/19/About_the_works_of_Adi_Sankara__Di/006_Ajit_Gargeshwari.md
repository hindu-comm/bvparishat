I have read you mail completely. One quick remark poetry is different from serious philosophical writing. Why will the same author change his view, style of writing, language and tenor in different works if it is written by the same author?  
  
**Bellamkonda Ramaraya kavi** and Kavi samrat have not gives different shades of their own views in their different works. They write in a style by which one can know all the works are from the same pen.  
  

I have already said in my earlier mail all these issues have been discussed thread bear in various Indological journals and books published over the past hundred years you may please consult them and I have already given you references from where any can possibly start the search  
  

PS



Sadhana Grantha Mandali books are available as parts in different libraries i have not seen the complete set I agree. Others I have them and have compared their contents.  

  
Best,
