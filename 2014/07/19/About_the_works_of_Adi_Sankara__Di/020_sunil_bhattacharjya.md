Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

As desiref by you I am attaching the paper of Mr. Pathak regarding the Nava avatara of Shankara.  
  
However I would like to clarify that my intention is not to attempt to prove you wrong. As Pathak says he was aware of the 8th century date of Shankara from the works of Weber and that could also mean that in Pathak's time the Shringeri Math did not take the stand of the 8th century date of Shankara.  
  

Further in the Shankara-vijaya, Shri Vidyaranayai included the name of Sudhnava as a king, contemporary to Shankara and it will be nice if scholars try to fins out if there was a king called Sudhanva in the 8th century CE. It will also be nice if the time of the king Amaruka can also be found.
