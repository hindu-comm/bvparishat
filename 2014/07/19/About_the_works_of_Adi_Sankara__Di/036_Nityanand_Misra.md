While the exact historical date of Śaṅkara may not depend onthe debate on whether (and to what extent) Buddhist works impacted Advaita works, there is a relation between the two. To the best of my information, both sides of the debate take it for granted that Gauḍapāda and Śaṅkara were later in time compared to the Buddhist writers (Nāgarjuna, Vasubandhu, Dignāga, etc).



Hence what we have is a 1200-year old assumption (since the time of Bhāskara) of the *terminus post quem* for Gauḍapāda and Śaṅkara.



For if Śaṅkara (and by implication Gauḍapāda) preceded Nāgarjuna and others, the debate does not arise at all.



Hence, a proposed date for Śaṅkara before Nāgarjuna goes against a 1200 year old belief. Therefore, the date has to be not only be backed by indisputable evidence, but also has to explain why for more than 1200 years most people assumed/thought otherwise.
