Dear Dr. Ajit Ji



Actually Dasgupta does mention why he chose the date, but five pages after the first mention of his preferred date. He also gives a reference.



See page 423

“There is some dispute about the date of Śaṅkara, but accepting the date proposed by Bhaṇḍarkar, Pathak and Deussen, we may consider it to be 788 A.D.,¹³ and suppose that in order to be able to teach Śaṅkara, Gauḍapāda must have been living till at least 800 A.D.”



The citation in the endnote is Ānandāśrama edition of Śaṅkara’s bhāsya on Gauḍapāda’s kārikā, p. 21.



The above extract suggests that Dasgupta went through the sources claiming different dates for Śaṅkara, acknowledged the dispute and agreed with one of the sources which I find is enough treatment given the aim of compiling his magnum opus was to cover all aspects of Indian philosophical history: the controversy regarding date of Śaṅkara is but a little drop in this ocean.



Also note the dates he gives for the Buddhist philosophers in Chapter V –



page 119

“Vasubandhu (420 A.D.— 500 A.D.) wrote a work on the Vaibhāṣika …”



page 128

“The most powerful exponent of this doctrine was Nāgārjuna (100 A.D.), a brief account of whose system will be given in its proper place. Nāgārjuna’s kārikās (verses) were commented upon by Aryyadeva, a disciple of his, Kumārajlva (383 A.D.), Buddhapālita and Candrakīrtti (550 A.D.).”
