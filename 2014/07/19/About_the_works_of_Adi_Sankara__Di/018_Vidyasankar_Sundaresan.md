Dear Sunilji,



I was wondering when Mr. abhinava Sankara would raise his head and sure enough, here he is!



Firstly, the paper by Pathak in Indian Antiquary gives details of a manuscript found in southern Maharashtra, which talks only about \*Adi\* Sankara. There is nothing in it to indicate that it is about some "nava" Sankara.Just as I've asked Dr. Ganesan to share details of inscriptionsabout kAlAmukha-s from the vidyASankara temple, I will now ask you to provide details about "nava" Sankara, this manuscriptand Pathak's paper, in order to substantiate your point and prove me wrong. When it comes to Sankara's date and the history of the maTha-s, the amount of disinformation that floats around is extremelyvexing. Some of this is deliberate; some of it is like Chinese whispers. It can get very confusing for those who are not careful to go back to original sources. Please do not repeat second-hand and third-hand.



Secondly, if one were to take this argument about nava/abhinava Sankara to its logical conclusion, then the author of bhAshya-s, starting with the brahmasUtra bhAshya, is not Adi Sankara, but this so-called "nava" Sankara.This argument has indeed been made by some who have found it impossible to contradict the internal evidence that allows us to roughly datethese texts but would still like to maintain that the date of Adi Sankara and the date of origin of their favorite institutions should be in the 5th century BCE. I would like you to impartially judge the merits of such conclusions. To me, this sounds like wanting to have the cake and eat it too.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
