This is not connected to the date of Adi-S'ankarAchArya.



This is with regard to Advaita Vedanta vis-à-vis Buddhism which occurred in course of the date discussion.



Pūjya Nityananda Misraji brought Dasgupta into discussion:



>

> “About the period 780 A.D. Gauḍapāda revived the monistic teaching of > the Upaniṣads by his commentary on the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad in verse > called *Māndūkyakārikā.* His disciple Govinda was the teacher of > Śaṅkara (788 — 820 A.D.).” >
> And here is Dasgupta again on pages 493-494: >
> “Śaṅkara and his followers borrowed much of their dialectic form of > criticism from the Buddhists. His Brahman was very much like the śūnya > of Nāgārjuna … The debts of Śaṅkara to the self-luminosity of the > Vijñānavāda Buddhism can hardly be overestimated … I am led to think > that Śaṅkara’s philosophy is largely a compound of Vijñānavāda and > Śūnyavāda Buddhism with the Upaniṣad notion of the permanence of self > superadded.” >

I know that the context isonly the date of Adi-S'ankaraand not the Dasgupta's opinion on the S'ankara's learning from the Buddhists expressed in the expressions of his times such as

> 
> > "The debts of Śaṅkara to the self-luminosity of the Vijñānavāda > Buddhism can hardly be overestimated" >
> 

Though not quoted here, Dasgupta's opinion is that even Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism. (pp 423-424 of the same book.)

He goes to the extent of saying that

>

> 

This opinion of Dasgupta and a similar one by Vidhus'ekhara Bhattacharya were thoroughly countered by Raghunatha Damodara Karmarkar in his Introduction to the BORI publication of gauḍapāda kārikā (1953).

Apart from that, let me share the following information. The inscriptions of śātavāhana times and the archeological information from Vijayapuri now relocated to be saved from the Nagarjuna Sagar water shows a very close co-existence of Vedic and Buddhist traditions. The śātavāhana kings are described as the performers of 100 Vājapēya Yāgas and women members of their family are described as the followers of Buddhabhagavān in the same inscription. Astructure identified by archeologistsas a Vedic temple and another as a Buddhistvidyālaya are found side by side in the same complex.nāgārjuna was a product of this milieu. gauḍapāda can also beimagined to be part of such milieu only.So is it not a good idea to look at thecontinuities and discontinuities between the Buddhist and Vedic traditions from this perspective?

Regards,

Nagaraj
