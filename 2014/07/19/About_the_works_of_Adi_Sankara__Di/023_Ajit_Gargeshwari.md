With due respect to Prof Dasgupta, in his History of Indian Philosophy Volume1, There is no discussion on the date of Shankar at all. He places Shankara between 7888-820 for the reasons he knows the best. He doesn't even mention that a relative chronology is the best guide and his date is not fixed or beyond controversy. The same is repeated by Prof S. Radhakrishnan in his book.  
  

Many other authors who blindly take quotations from the above books without reading the originals repeat what these authors have said.



 Even their treatment of Advaita is it Adavaita as from Brahma Sutra Bhashya they write or is it their version of Advaita? Prof Radhakrishna uses high sounding words which the original texts when read don't have any of those words. I am sure at least on Sankhya Prof Dasgupta gives his theory of Sankhya. A more balanced text book would be Chandradhar Sharma's book for advaita and Prof. Nakumara dates and Paul hacker and Mayeda for criteria to determine works of Shankara.  
  

The usual disclaimer these are my personal views and one may not agree with at all  
  
Please note at least Nityananda ji and Vidyashnakara ji have at least given reasons as to why they assign a date. Thats my quick point take away from this thread Thanks
