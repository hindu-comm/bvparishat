Well the works of Shankara are not beyond dispute. Please see several publications to fix the works of done over the past 100 years on it JSTOR will give you several articles and there are many books written on it. I can give a detailed Bibliography if needed. I don't think any one scholar can accept all the works are written by Shankarcharya if by Shankaracharya you mean the one who has written the bhashya on Brahma Sutras.
