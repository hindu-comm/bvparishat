Thank you Ajit Ji.

I have the works of Sankara published by SAMATA Publications, Orient Book Agency of Pune and of Sadhana Grantha Mandali of Tenali. All these publications accept the authorship of Sankaracharya.

Yes. I shall be thankful if you can give me the detailed Bibliography of his work.

I request you further to help me in understanding the following statements of your mail.

"Well the works of Shankara are not beyond dispute. ............... I don't think any one scholar can accept all the works are written by Shankarcharya if by Shankaracharya you mean the one who has written the bhashya on Brahma Sutras."

With warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
