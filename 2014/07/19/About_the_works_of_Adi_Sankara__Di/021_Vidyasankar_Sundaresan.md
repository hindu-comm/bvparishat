Dear Sunilji,

The term navAvatAra does not have to be taken as indicating a person called nava/abhinava Sankara, who was born later than Adi Sankara. Please note, the same verse also describes him as the bhAshyakAra on the SArIraka, i.e. author of the brahmasUtra bhAshya, who is the only Sankara one needs to worry about in these discussions.

Also, please note, within living memory, followers of the famous karapAtrI swAmI of Kashi used to call him abhinava Sankara. And there was a 15th-16th century author of a commentary on the rudrAdhyAya, who was also called abhinava Sankara. Thus, there have been many abhinava Sankaras in history, but only one Adi Sankara who wrote a brahmasUtra bhAshya.

As far as discussing authorship is concerned, there is no need to complicate the picture by talking of one or the other abhinava Sankara and bringing the question of dates.

Thanks,  
Vidyasankar
