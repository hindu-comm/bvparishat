Dear Dr. Ganesan,



I got the expected reaction from you. You see, for every group of adherents, accounts of miracles,the supernatural, the fantastic and the anachronistic, are "authentic"in their own favorite texts, but "irrational" in other's texts. That was the point I wished to make by talking of the two Tamil texts and your response proves my stance admirably well. So, thank you!



Please don't worry, I have indeed read sufficiently detailedaccounts from these textsabout the lives of the Saiva nAyanmAr-s and about Siva's lIlA-s involving a number of human beings in the city of Madurai. And I have read them in the Tamil language too, not in English translation. I could easily point to a lot in these legends (or fairy tales, to borrow your colourful expression), whichwould appear "irrational" to non-Saiva eyesand which would easily defy any attempt at reading history and chronology into them.



I could enumerate many specifics, if at all I had any wish to embark upon an anti-Saiva rant, which I don't, so I won't. As I said earlier, I will not ask you or other Tamil Saiva siddhAntin adherents to throw these textsoverboard, unlike your "considered" reaction to the Sankaravijaya texts. I have a good amount of respect for both sets of texts, in themselves, and both sets of traditions that they describe and represent, again quite unlike your attitude towards adherents of SAnkara vedAnta.



Obviously,it is not worththe time and effort to continue these lines of discussion with you. This is perhaps a belated realization onmy part, seeing as how others who attempted to contribute reasonably to a genuine discussion in the past two weeks have since decided to keep silent. I will join their ranks.



Goodbye,

Vidyasankar
