Dear Colleagues,  

I do not know if the following information will be appreciated or not. Late Tillman Vetter (c.1928-2010), an unassuming admirer of Indian philosophy argued anew on the date of the philosopher. Himself uncompromisingly idealist, Vetter shunned Dasgupta in favour of Radhakrishnan. I can give bibliographical details later.  
Another point is being stated with humility. In 1978 I tried to show the influence of the Vasubandhu-Maitryeyanatha Yogaacaara thought on the Maanduukya-Upanishad and kaarikaas, on Gaudapaada and the structure of post-Maanduujkya Vedaanta. This partly agreed with Dasgupota's views. But I found Dasgupta too mechanical as he depended more on terminology than on ontology.  

Both B.K.Matilal and Vetter accepted my point of view. I shall be glad if this information helped on the tricky issue.   
  

Best
