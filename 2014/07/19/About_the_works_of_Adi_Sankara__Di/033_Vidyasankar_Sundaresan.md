Just to clarify, in case it is not obvious, I have absolutely no disagreement with placing the date of Sankara post-Nagarjuna. Actually, it should also be post-Dharmakirti and post-Kumarila Bhatta. Such a conclusion does not have depend upon what one makes of the interaction between madhyamaka or vijnAnavAda bauddha-s and vedAntins in the times of gauDapAda and Sankara.



The date 788CE comes, as was noted inlater posts, fromone native tradition recounted in a text called AryavidyAsudhAkara(I forget the name of the author at the moment) and in the Sankara-mandAra-saurabha and SankarAbhyudaya, which were hagiographic texts written by one Kerala author called Nilakantha. G C Pande reports a similar reference in a Hindi text called darSana-prakASa, written by niScaladAsa of the udAsIna sampradAya, who lived in the north. The mss reported by Pathak in the Indian Antiquaryis quite in consonance with these. Obviously, these diverse authors were reporting whatever tradition they had received about the matter. They can be held to be completely innocent of such complications as political equations between various SAnkara maTha-s, or a desire to date key historical people before Christ, or even any particular interest in history and chronology in the European sense, which we Indians have inherited today.



As such, it is not only misleading, but completely wrong,to project it as if 5th century BCE is the \*only\* "traditional" date for Sankara. Rather, it is the other way round. Those like Kota Venkatachalam and T S Narayana Sastri, who proposed a 5th cent BCE date for Sankara, did so in the 19th century, as a reaction to what they saw as a British colonialattempt to downgrade ancient Indian traditions to more recent origins. In my opinion, this is an over-reaction, as the date of Sankara has absolutely nothing to do with debates about Indo-Aryan origins."Belief" in any date, especially in a5th century BC date, is actually a quite newly minted tradition.



Please note that I distinguish between concrete dates as recounted today and the traditionally presented paramparA lists of the various maTha-s as presented a couple of centuries ago. The lattermost often only give names for earlier AcArya-s. The dates have been retrofitted to the names, within the last 100-150 years. They are not etched in stone.



Best regards,
