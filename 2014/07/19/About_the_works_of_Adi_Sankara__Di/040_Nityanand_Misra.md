Let us not forget we need to accomodate Pāṇini also before Śaṅkara. While there are places in his works where Śaṅkarācārya chooses a non-Pāṇinian interpretationover a Pāṇinian interpretation – for example on BS 2.3.19 jño'ta eva he ignores PS 3.1.135 igupadhājñāprīkiraḥ kaḥ which ordains kaḥ in the sense of agent and not in the sense of verbal action (Natalia Isayeva discusses this example in Shankara and Indian Philosophy, SUNY Press, ISBN 9780791412817 on page 225, along with the interpretation of Rāmānuja and Nimbārka of the same aphorism), Śaṅkara does show that he knows of Pāṇini's work – for example he cites PS 5.4.21 tatprakṛtavacane mayaṭ verbatim in his commentary on BS 1.1.13 vikāraśabdānneti cenna prācuryāt. Pāṇini's time is currently believed to be 4th century BC. If we push back Śaṅkara to 5th century BCE we have to accomodate Pāṇini many years before him also: in short we are looking at new chronologies for many pre-Śaṅkara authors.
