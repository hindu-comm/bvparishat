Samata Publication which is reprint of the original 20 volumes Sri Vanai Vilas press edition.. The other publications which you mention
are a compilation of works ascribed to be written by Shankaracharya and not written by by him. It would have been impossible for a person who had a 32 year life span ( If one were to believe in the hagiographical works ) to have written so much even if he were to write day in and day out. The printed edition of Shankaras complete works ascribed to be wriiten by runs to over thousands of pages.  
  

All successors of Shankara matas call themselves as Shankaracharya so many works may not be the work work Adi Shankara the commentator on Brahma Sutra Bhasya, Gita Bhashya, 10 principal Upanishads. though other upanishad commentaries and Gita commentary .  
  
It is unlikely he would have written many of the prakarna granthas for the philosophical points dealt in many of them is in variance with Brahma Sutra Bhashya. It is very unlikely he wrote a commentaries on predominantly Tantrik works such as Prapancha Sara, Saudrya Lahari, Lalita Trisati Bhashya etc. Very often a Bhashya Sanatsujatiya is ascribed to him.  
  

See also the controversy on Yoga Sutra Bhashya Vivivarna leggets edition and translation and the Madras edition  

  

Among the Prakarnas Viveka chudamani is generally accepted to be written by Shankarcharya and some scholars would want include Upadesa sahasri.  
  

Paul Hacker has done a lot of interesting studies to determine which of his works are genuine.  

  

For Bibliography please refer to Paul Hacker , Hajime Nakumara, Encyclopedia of India Philosophy Bibliography edited Kar Potter Volum1 and Volume 2. and the several many books and articles written on this subject  
  

Please Note: I am not saying any thing new all this has been discussed thread bare with no decisive verdict for more than a hundred years in all major Indological journals and also in may specialized books.  
  

I will try to send a detailed Bibliography by a mail off the list as time permits
