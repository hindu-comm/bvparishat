Esteem Scholars,

  

I am struggling to understand the names of R.sis and their origin of lineage or teacher-disciple relationships those are referred in the first chapter of the Va.m"sa Braahma.na. My problem is: we find always two names of R.sis as descendants and two others are as origin in each line. But sometimes two names are treated as one by some scholars. Which is the right interpretation of these passages grammatically.

  

I am copying few passages of the text bellow for your kind enlightenment in this regard.

Sentence: 12*bʰavatrātaḥ** śāyastʰiḥ kustukāccʰārkarākṣyāt // \\\\*

Sentence: 13*kustukaḥ** śārkarāskṣyaḥ śravaṇadattāt kauhalāt // \\\\*

Sentence: 14*śravaṇadattaḥ** kauhalaḥ suśāradāccʰālaṅkāyanāt // \\\\*

Sentence: 15*suśāradaḥ** śālaṅkāyana ūrjayata aupamanyavāt // \\\\*

Sentence: 16*ūrjayannaupamanyavo** bʰānumata aupamanyavāt // \\\\*

Sentence: 17*bʰānumānaupamanyava** ānandajāccāndʰanāyanāt // \\\\*

Sentence: 18*ānandajaścāndʰanāyanaḥ** śāmbāccʰārkarākṣyāt kāmbojāccopamanyavāt // \\\\*

Sentence: 19*śāmbaḥ** śārkarākṣyaḥ kāmbojaścaupamanyavo madrakārāccʰauṅgāyaneḥ // \\\\*

Sentence: 20*madrakāraḥ** śauṅgāyaniḥ svāterauṣṭrākṣeḥ // \\\\*
