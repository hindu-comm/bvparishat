**Subject:** Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Regarding few passages of Va.m"sa Braahma.na  

  

Thank you for correcting. I still have questions:

  

Why it is gaargyasaarvadatta not "saarvadattagaargya?

is there any significance in sequence?

  

Some scholars like McDonnell (Vedic Concordance: for example: aanandaja.h chaandhanaayana.h as aanandajachaandhanaayana ) &

  

"sankarabhaa.sya of Chaandogyopanisad (5.11.1)Prof. Dr. G.N. Jha treats the name together as it is (as he translates "sankarabhaa.sya too), for example: Satyayaj\~na.h Paulusir as Satyayaj\~napaulusi etc. By this it is clear that Satyayaj\~na is a name and Paulusi is his family name that he belongs. But in the case of the Va.m"sa [braahma.na](http://braahma.na), it is unclear!

  

Sorry for my ignorance!

Regards,
