Thank you for showing the way to understand the passages but still I find difficulty. So let me apply your method here, please correct it if I am ignorant:

So let me start from the first line:

Sentence: 2upajāyataśarvadattādgārgyātśārvadattogārgyaḥ// \\\\  

From Sarvadatta-Gaargya Sarvadattagaargya born\|\| 2\|\|  

                  or

From Sarvadatta, Gaargya born, from Gaargya Sarvadattagaargya born\|\| 2\|\|

Sentence: 3śarvadattogārgyorudrabʰūterdrāhyāyaṇāt// \\\\

Sarvadattagaargya. From Rudrabhuuti, Draahyaaya.na (born)\|\| 3\|\|  

  

Here the first line is correct or the second line?

And also is Sarvadattagaargya of first line different from Sarvadattagaargya of line no.3? or it is just a repetition?  

  

Thank you for your kind patience.

Regards
