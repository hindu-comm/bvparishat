Respected members of bvp  
 I am searching for the book Vedanta Sangraha of Bellamkonda Ramaraya. In google search it shows that it has published in 1998 by Ramanama Kshetram (A.P.) with english translation and notes.  
 If it is available in any forn (print or digital) members are requested to provide me the book or any link, address etc.  
 With regards
