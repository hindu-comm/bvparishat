Pala, Adhaka, Drona, Kharivaha, Nikunchaka, Kudava and Prastha were some liquid measuring units of ancient times. These were popularly used in astronomical and astrological texts even to forecast the rain.

हस्तविशालं कुण्डकमधिकृत्याम्बुप्रमाणनिर्देश:।

पञ्चाशपलमाढकमनेन मिनुयाज्जलं पतितम्॥

                   बृहत्संहितायाम् प्रवर्षणाध्याये (२३ अध्याये २ श्लोक:)

  

According to another calculation -

1 palam - A small contianer that can accommodate 1 fistful grain or 1 Prakuncaka

4 Palams - 1 Kudava

4 Kudavas - 1 Prastha

4 Prasthas - 1.Adhakam

8 Adhakas - 1 Drona

2 Dronas = 1 Surpa

One and Half Surpas = 1 Khari

2 Surpas = 1 Goni or Bharam

4 Bharams = Vaha (Quantity which can be transported by a full load Bullock Cart)

In certain regions - 4 Adhakas - 1 Droni

16 Dronis = 1Kharivaha

20 Dronas - 1 Kumbha

10 Kumbhas = 1 Vaha

शुष्कमेये त्विदं मानं द्विगुणं तद् द्रवेषु तु।

This measuring system is taken from my old notes collected from some ancient Rasa Tantra Texts.

While measuring the rainfall the conversion of some of these units into modern volumetric mensuration is in the following manner :

1 Kuncham = 1 Adhakam = 1.6 cm or 16 mm (This is the volume of rainwater collected in a modern rain guage of area of 200 cm in modern meteorological system). In weight it is equal to - 7 lbs or 11 OZ (Avoir dupois).

4 Adhakams = 1 Drona = 1.6x4 = 6.4 cm.

Modern meteorologists like Tripathi and Balkundi propose this measurement in their scientific pursuits.

According to Sage Parasara an Adhakam is the capacity of a circular vessel whose dfiameter is 20 Angulams and depth is 8 Angulams. (here 1 Angualam is nearly equal to 1 inch or some times 3/4 inch or 3/8inch too).

  

I hope this information may be of some importance in the present pursuit of this thread.

Warm Regards,
