Respected Prof. D. Bhattacharya,

Namaste!

Thank you very much for your explanation. Actually I am stuck in the line nos.18 &19 of the Va.m"sa Braahama.na (VB), it is a tricky one! though many scholars have explained it.

  

My difficulty lies in:

As the 2nd line of VB says 'upajaayata' (were born), so it is meant for each line specially when the text describes family not the teacher-student (as the title of the text itself clearly declares it is a family record). On that basis, I assume when it says "sarvadattat Gaargyaat, it probably means from Gaargya (probably it is talking about family of R.si Kaa"syapa originated from Brahmaa-svaayambhuva through whom Saama Veda handed down to "sarvadatta gaargya? I am just curious to know)

  

But when we come down to line nos. 18 & 19: it says:

Sentence: 18ānandajaścāndʰanāyanaḥśāmbāccʰārkarākṣyātkāmbojāccopamanyavāt// \\\\  

Sentence: 19śāmbaḥśārkarākṣyaḥkāmbojaścaupamanyavomadrakārāccʰauṅgāyaneḥ// \\\\  

How you would interpret these two lines. I am aware of many have explained it following way: aanandajachaandhanayana from "saamba-"saarkaraaksa and "samba-"[saarkaraak.sa](http://saarkaraak.sa) from Kaamboja-aupamanyava and kaamboja-aupamanyava from madrakaara-"sau.ngaayana. How it is so if I apply your way of interpretation?

  

Further every one has treated Kamboja and Madrakaara as two regions from which the said R.sis belong to. But madrakaara could be meant a person's name which means: the person, who causes happiness, and the same way kaamboja could be a person's name: the person, who enjoys the beauty: kamaniiyabhojaa. Since none other R.si carries any region names, these words could be simply only the names of the R.sis.

  

As far my knowledge goes the Vedic seer-composers were revealers of truth and each of their words carry a depth of meaning. So I would like to know what exactly the seer trying to say in those particular lines.

  

I am extremely sorry for taking of your valuable time putting my queries out of my ignorance to you since none of experts of the Vedas except you
in the forum dealt it. I am sorry also if my query is unclear!

  

Thanking you in advance for your valuable explanation!

  

With sincere regards,

nibedita
