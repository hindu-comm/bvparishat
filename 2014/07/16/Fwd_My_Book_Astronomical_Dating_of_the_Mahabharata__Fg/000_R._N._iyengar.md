Subject: My Book "Astronomical Dating of the Mahabharata War"  
  

Dear Friends,

  

I just finished my book "Astronomical Dating of the Mahabharata War" and put it online. It can be downloaded from this link, I hope:

<http://www.gilgamesh.ch/KochMahabharata6x9_V1.00.pdf>

The size is about 5 MB, so download could take some time.  

  

The translation into English was made by myself. I am afraid it is not perfect, but it was not possible to find somebody who translates German into English and also understands the matter. The formatting of the German version will take me some more time.  

  

Criticism is very welcome. Besides, you are allowed to forward this mail to any person or forum that might be interested in the topic.  

  

Best regards

  

Dieter Koch
