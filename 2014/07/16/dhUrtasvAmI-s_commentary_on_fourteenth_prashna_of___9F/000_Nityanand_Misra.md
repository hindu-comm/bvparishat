Namaste



Does anybody know of an online source where all volumes of Dhūrtasvāmī's commentary on the Āpastamba Śrautasūtra are available?



I searched on DLI which has many publications of the originals plus several publications of the commentary. Two volumes each of the commentary from two publications are available - one from Oriental Institute Baroda and one from Mysore University - but these two are incomplete anddo not cover the commentary on the fourteenth Praśna which is what I am looking for.

I would be thankful for any pointers or help.
