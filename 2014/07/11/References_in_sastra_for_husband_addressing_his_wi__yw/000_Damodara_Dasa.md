Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected sirs/madams,  
I am damodara das from ISKCON Salem. I need some references from  
sastras regarding the modes of addressing for a husband to wife and  
vice-versa -- for all varnas. For instance Lord Siva calls paravati as  
"devi" -- ...tasmAt parataram devI, tadIyAnAm samarcanam...  
There must be rules for these mentioned in dharma sastras as well as  
puranas. I am looking for that.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
