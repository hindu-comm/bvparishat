Namaste,

  

There are interesting conversations between rAmachandra and sIta mAta in srImad rAmAyaNa. rAma often addresses His consort as dEvi, priyE, sakhI while sIta addresses Her husband as AryE, nAtha etc. Quite often it also depends on the love, affection and intimacy between the relationship which is depicted in our ancient kAvyAs like nala-damayanti, shakuntala-dushyanta etc.

  

However, IMHO, whenever any doubt about human relationships arise, there is no other way than to take refuge in our glorious epic rAmAyaNa only as bhagavAn rAmachandra is our Adarsha-purusha and maryAda-purusha who is dharma personified (rAmO vigrahavAn dharmaH). 

  

Interestingly, in recent times, shri kAvyakaNTa gaNapati muni used to address his wife vishAlAkshi as "tapas sakhE !". Shri gaNapati muni used to consider and view his wife as his companion for tapasya and both used to perform severe penance. The wife of gaNapati muni is the "Adi-guru" in our southern region to propagate one of the 10 cosmic sciences of shakta vidya ie., tArA mantra vidya. 

  

regs,

sriram
