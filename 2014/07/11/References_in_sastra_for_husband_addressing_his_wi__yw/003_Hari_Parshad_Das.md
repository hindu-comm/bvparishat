\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~

  

The rule in the dharma-śāstras is to not utter the name of the wife:

  

***ātma-nāma guror nāma***

***nāmātikṛpaṇasya ca***

***śreyas kāmo na gṛhṇīyāj-***

***jyeṣṭhāpatya-kalatrayoḥ***

  

"A person who desires his real benefit should not speak out his own name, his guru's name, the name of a miser, the name of the elder son or the name of the wife."

  

This is found in thekeśava-vaijayantī commentary of Nanda-paṇḍita on Chapter 28, Quote 24 of the Viṣṇu-smṛti. Please see attached image.

  

A similar quote is found in Sri Jayatirtha's Tattva-prakāśikā sub-commentary and Sri Jagannatha Tirtha's Dipika sub-commentary on Sri Madhvacharya's Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya's introductory verse:

  

'gurornāma na gṛhṇīyācchiṣyo bhāryā paterapi’ iti vacanād gurornāma nāgrahīdācāryaḥ  

  

ys,

  

hari parshad das.
