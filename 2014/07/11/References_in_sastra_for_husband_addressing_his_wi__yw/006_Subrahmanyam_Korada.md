नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

The purport of Parasurama is to be taken - do not say I shall follow some sage and go against dharmasastram - न गृह्णीयात् ज्येष्ठापत्यकलत्रयोः ।

  

Yajnavalkya , Srirama and many others called their wives by name - may be in that Yuga it was allowed - not now.

Sometimes even if it is not धर्मव्यतिक्रम one should not emulate great people if it is restricted by Dharmasastram.

So the तात्पर्यम् and not वाच्यार्थ is to be taken.

धन्यो’स्मि
