Dear Scholar,  

It depends on the University whether you are entitled to study MA in Sanskrit. Unfortunately they change rules time to time. One thing can be suggested. You may acquire the Madhyamaa or Tiirtha degree. Since the UGC recognizes these as equivalent to BA/MA that should legally entitle you to study MA. Of course, here too the decision of the Board of Studies of the Department will decide.  

Best
