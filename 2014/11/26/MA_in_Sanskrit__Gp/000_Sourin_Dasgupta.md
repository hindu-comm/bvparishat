Dear Members,

  

I did my graduation with an honours in History, along with Political Science and Education as elective subjects (C.U.), followed by an MA in History (N.S.O.U.). I studied Sanskrit personally with some traditional Sanskrit scholars of Varanasi, and have the ability to read, writer and speak the language (although I never studied it formally). 

  

My question is Am I eligible for doing a second MA in Sanskrit on a regular basis or under the distance mode of education of any university?


  

I will be immensely indebted to members of this group helping me find an answer to my question.

  

Sincere regards,

Sourin Dasgupta,
