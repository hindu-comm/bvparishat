Dear Members,

  

Thanks for your quick responses. 

  

I did not study Sanskrit *officially* at any level. So I am in search of any such MA in Sanskrit programme of a recognised university as does not include a study of Sanskrit at school or BA level as eligibility criteria.

  

Regards,

Sourin Dasgupta
