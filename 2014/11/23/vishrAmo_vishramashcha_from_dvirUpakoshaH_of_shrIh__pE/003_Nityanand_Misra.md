Thanks Shankara Ji. I have downloaded the Abhidhanasangraha from DLI.  
  
There appear to be two works by the name Dvirūpakośaḥ, one by Puruṣottamadeva and a larger one by Śrīharṣa.  
  
One of our list members, Sh. Narasimhacharya, posted a Unicode version of the Dvirūpakośaḥ by Śrīharṣa on another group, and I am attaching the same for those interested.  
  
Caveat lector: The text has some typos and needs to be proofread.
