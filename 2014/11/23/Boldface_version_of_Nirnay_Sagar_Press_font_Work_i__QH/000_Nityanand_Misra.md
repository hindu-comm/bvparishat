Namaste  
  
I have started an effort (the Herculean effort, rather) to create the boldface version of Nirnay Sagar Press’s classic Devanagari font which was used in most of their Sanskrit groups. The normal version of the font is already available as Sanskrit 2003.  
  
The lack of a boldface version is the only roadblock (a frustrating one at that) in recreating the magical Nirnay Sagar Press reading experience. The bold option in Word (or Autofakebolding in LaTeX) works, but is not the same thing as having a boldface – a boldface version of a font has different, though similar, glyphs.  
  
Given the number of conjuncts (several hundreds), I do not know how many months (or years) it will take to complete. For that matter, I don't even know if this would be ever complete. I have so far created around 40 glyphs. I am attaching an image juxtaposing the typeset boldface glyphs with those of Sanskrit 2003 font.  
  
Please provide your inputs on improving the visual appearance and quality of the glyphs:  

1.  How the boldface glyphs look 2.  How the contrast with normal weight looks 3.  Changes to shapes (for both boldface and normal weight) that will
    make the glyphs look better 4.  Would ध and भ look better with the circle (as in modern fonts) or
    without it

Tools used (all open/free software, tutorial will come after font completion)  

-   The GIMP: Image processing (lines, ellipses, the wonderful Bézier
    curves, derivative matching, and a lot more - there is more math to
    graphic designing than I thought)  
-   Inkscape: Glyph creation -   Cygwin: Automation (using shell scripts) -   Python: Font creation (using FontForge library) -   XeLaTeX: Typesetting

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
