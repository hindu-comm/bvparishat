Agree, the price is high. But then again, typography is a business where there is big money.  
  
I know of two free Unicode Devanagari fonts developed by CDAC which have boldface versions - CDAC GIST Surekh and CDAC GIST Yogesh.

Quite a few conjuncts too. Please see attached sample typesets.  
  
I still prefer APS DV Stardust, which has fewer conjuncts but has both and italic and boldface version, and is quite artistic.
