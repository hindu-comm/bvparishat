When I shared the previous post of AadaraNIya Nityanandji on this topicwith my friend Prof. Vinod Vidwans, who is a typography expert , he replied as follows:



Imyself developed a Sharada multilingual word processor in 1998-99 that works on Windows XP but now it is not suitable for later versions. I also developed a Devanagari font for the word processor. So it is interesting to see people are working in these \`not so commercially attractive fields".
