Namaste,Nityānanda

  

 Brave you are. It took Mihas three years to make Siddhanta. So in your case it should not be a one month effort as well. There is no bigger devanagari font for Sanskrit than Siddhanta and it was all drawn with<http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx> and I do have a backup of the source files with the hinting. It's not only about the glyphs. You'll master them till 2020, that's for sure. It's about the hynting magic and there is only one person alive, who has done it before. And the Devanagari masters say only VOLT can handle it.

 I asked if Mihas would make a bold version of Siddhanata last autumn in Moscow. He said not, because it's years and years to develop one. So yes, it's a huge task and I must say I bow to your efforts. It's good that you do not know too much of the prehistory of modern devanagari fonts and you have enough courage to start this long journey.

 As an author of two devanagari replicas myself, I salute you.
