I have seen toe rings worn even by burqa clad women (those whose family / surroundings are perhaps not yet wahabbized).  
  

If one were to make vedic ritual = one which has a veda mantra to back it up, then even ma\~NgalasUtra will become avaidika. There isn't a veda mantra to back it. Hence, the toe ring is as much vaidika or avaidika as the ma\~NgalasUtra. My AchArya says that there is a reference in gR^ihyasUtra that the girl being married should be given gold and slowly this became transformed into a ma\~NgalasUtra.  
  

It will be interesting to hear from scholars if there is any textual evidence either for toe ring or ma\~NgalasUtra. pANigrahaNa has vaidika backing and also has textual backing.  
  

There is also the chance that these (toe ring and ma\~NgalasUtra) are included because of tantra. It will also be interesting to see when the current kalpa of a marriage got standardized in various gR^ihya sUtras (thus revealing to us the reason for the presence / absence of textual evidence to back up toe rings, ma\~NgalasUtras etc.).
