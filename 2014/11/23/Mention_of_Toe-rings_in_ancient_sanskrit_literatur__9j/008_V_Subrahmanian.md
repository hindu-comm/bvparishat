In the श्रीललितासहस्नाम we have this name of the Divine Mother:  
  
कामेशबद्धमाङ्गल्यसूत्रशोभितकन्धरा ॥१२॥  
  

There is another name in the devi aṣṭottaraśata :  
  
गिरीशबद्धमाङ्गल्यमङ्गलायै...  
  

Regarding the tow-ring, one may consult the appropriate chapter/verse of the Kambarāmāyaṇam where Lakshmana identifies the leg-related ornaments of Sitā since, as I have heard, he would prostrate before her everyday and has had the opportunity to observe those ornaments only and no other. The incident also speaks of his devotion to the Mother Sitā and chaste behaviour with respect to other women. I am not very sure if the report is based on the Kambaramayanam or a folklore legend.
