Hare Krishna.  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
Thankyou for replies.  
  
I will read PK Gode's work, thankyou for directing to that. I also  
read the book "Bharatiya Vesabhusa..." on DLI, thankyou for that,  
helped to some extant.  
I have one more request:  
If anyone knows someone (like PK Gode) who is currently researching on  
these topics (like those of PK Gode) and whom I can meet and discuss,  
it will be very helpful to me. I have many such questions about small  
points in Indian culture and I may not put them here but discuss them  
with some people who are into its research.  
I am free to travel to any place in India so you can suggest without  
consideration of place.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
