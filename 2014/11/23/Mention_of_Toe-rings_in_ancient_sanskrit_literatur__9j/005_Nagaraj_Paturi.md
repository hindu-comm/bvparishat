My AchArya says that there is a reference in gR^ihyasUtra that the girl being married should be given gold and slowly this became transformed into a ma\~NgalasUtra



"that there is a reference in gR^ihyasUtra that the girl being married should be given gold" could be true.



"slowly this became transformed into a ma\~NgalasUtra" is not true.



In ma\~NgalasUtra, sUtra is more important than the gold. Women wear ma\~NgalasUtra in several different ways in which gold is an essential component. In the south, a small piece of turmeric is also tied to the ma\~NgalasUtra.



The verse that is recited during mAngalyadhAraNa describes the purpose of ma\~NgalasUtra as the long life of the bride groom. There is a theory that it originated from the older practice of a tying a talisman meant for the protection of the bridegroom in the neck of the bride so that she secures its safety.



as'mArOhaNa is a toe-related ritual. Toe-rings being part of that makes sense. But experts may enlighten more on the meaning of the ritual or textual referencesto it.
