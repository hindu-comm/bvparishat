Hare Krishna.

Pl.refer to the papers written by Shri P.K.Gode,who used to research on the less-known things in Indian culture,like the origin of Dhosa(idli dosa of the South),the Nose-ornament,esp.worn in Maharashtra downwards by married women.etc.

A felicitation Vol.in his honour gives all the info.about his papers.

Moreover,his three books on Indian Cultural Studies-published from Vishveshvarananda Institute,Hoshiarpur,Panjab,may give some details.

  

Best luck.

  

Prof Siddharth Wakankar
