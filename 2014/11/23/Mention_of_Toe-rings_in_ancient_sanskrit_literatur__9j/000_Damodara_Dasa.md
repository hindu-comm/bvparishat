Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
I am looking for some references especially in veda, puranas,  
mahabharata, or ramayana about toe-rings. Toe-rings are well known in  
Indian Tradition as an ornament of married woman and also a sign of  
woman's being already married. But apart from spoken tradition, I want  
some references from above literatures. If anyone has some idea about  
it, I would request you to share it.  
  
\[Note: I searched about the incident of mata sita's throwing toe-ring  
(as is generally heard) while being kidnapped by ravana. But in  
Valmiki Ramayana, only abharana is mentioned and later in  
Kishkindhakanda when sugriva brought the found ornaments, we see that  
nUpura was there but no mention of toe-ring is there.\]  
  
Thankyou,  
damodara das
