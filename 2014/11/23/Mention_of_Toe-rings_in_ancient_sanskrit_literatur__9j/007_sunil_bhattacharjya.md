Namaste,  
  

Yes, it is a custom in Maharashtra to wear toe-ring and my wife being from a Saraswat family in Mumbai, did wear it in the beginning, but later on she asked me whether she should continue wearing it, as my people in the North-East do not wear it.. I told her that it is alright either way. Later on she gave it up. Much later I read that there is health reason for wearing it. It gives protection to the uterus.  
  

Unfortunately I do not remember the details of the source. May be an Ayurveda-scholar will be able to tell us.  
  

Regards,
