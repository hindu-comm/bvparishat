1\. The ritual of slipping of the toe-rings to the second toe of the bride, by the bride-groom is being included as part of two different rituals : sthAlIpAkam and as'mArOhaNam. Some communities are including it as part of the first some as part of the second.



2\. In as'mArOhaNam , there is a context of toes. Thus communities including it as part of as'mArOhaNam ,find that to be logical component of that ritual.



3\. Though there is a mantra for as'mArOhaNa, there appears to be no mantra for the slipping of the toe-ring.



4\. Based on absence of mantra, some inferred that this is not a Vedic traditional ritual, but is a dEs'AchAra. If absence of Sanskrit literary referencesis true, thatalso explained on that basis only. But if it is a des'AchAra , it can not have such a wide spread throughout the Indic subcontinent.
