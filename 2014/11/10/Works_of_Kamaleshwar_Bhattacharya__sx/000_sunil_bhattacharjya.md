Namaste,  
  

The renown scholar Kamaleshwara Bhattacharya had written a paper entitled ""L'[Ātman](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman "Ātman")-[Brahman](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman "Brahman") dans le bouddhisme ancien" (1973) in French, and he had himself prepared an English translation of that paper, for the consumption of the English reading public.. He seems to have given a copy of that translation to one scholar, quite some years ago, obviously hoping that the translated paper will be available to the public, but unfortunately that did not happen. and nobody has ever heard of the fate of that translation anymore. Does any friend here know about the addresses / whereabouts of the children of Late Kamaleshwar Bhattacharya, so that they can be contacted to find out if they have any copy or the English version of that paper left with them ?
