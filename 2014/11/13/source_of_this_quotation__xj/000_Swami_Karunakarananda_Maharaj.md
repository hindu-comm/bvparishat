Respected Scholars,  
  

Hari Om. I would like to know the source of following verse quoted by Bhattoji Dikshit in his Proudhamanorama. He says it is told by Hari (probably Bartrhari?)  
  
उपायाः शिक्षमाणानां बालानामुपलालनाः ।  
असत्ये वर्त्मनि स्थित्वा ततः सत्यं समीहते ॥  
  
  

  

नारायणस्मृतिः  
  
स्वामी करुणाकरानन्दपुरी
