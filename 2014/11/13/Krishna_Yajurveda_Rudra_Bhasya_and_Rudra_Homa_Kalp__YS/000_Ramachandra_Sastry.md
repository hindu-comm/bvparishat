Namaste,

  

Can any one please help, if there are any Krishna Yajuveda Rudra Bhasyas available apart from Sayana, Bhattabhaskara and Abhinava Shankara.

  

Also, I am in search of Rudra homa kalpa in devanagari.

  

Google search did not fetch me much results, hence the request.

  

  

Regards

Ramachandra
