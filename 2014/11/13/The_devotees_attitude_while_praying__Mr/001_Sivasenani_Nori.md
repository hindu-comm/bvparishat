Sir

  

Namaste.

  

I appreciate that in stotras a poet might compare himself with the perfection in each field that Bhagavaan has and declare that whatever be the poet's proficiency in that field, it is so little that it might as well be considered that the poet is not proficient. Or another way of looking is that if one lakh of purascharana of a particular mantra is supposed to give a phala of say 1 unit, but if God gives a result which is disproportionate, say a 1,000 units, due to his apaara karunaa, then it might as well be said that one does not know mantra and that all the result that one obtained was due to the mercy of God.

  

That is why I mentioned the two other reasons.

N. Siva Senani
