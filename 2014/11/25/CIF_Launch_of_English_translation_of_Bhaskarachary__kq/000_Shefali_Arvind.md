Hari Om Blessed Self!

  

Greetings from Chinmaya International Foundation!

  

We are pleased to announce the launch of A. B. Padbamabha Rao's translation of Bhaskaracharya's Lilavati to English. A novel approach is adopted to translate Sanskrit verses into English syntax, which makes sense in English translation. This translation will be useful to a large segment of readers whose knowledge of Sanskrit language is limited, and also to the small segment of Sanskrit scholars whose exposure to modern mathematics is limited.

  

This book creates a window into the field of Ancient Indian Mathematics for the present generation of students and teachers, along with an awareness of the great contributions by India in the world of Mathematics. Drawing from the Buddhivilāsinī commentary, the verses are explained in detail with fully worked out examples and additional remarks. Numerous diagrams make it easier for the reader to understand the context.
