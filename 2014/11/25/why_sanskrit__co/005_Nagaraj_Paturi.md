Dear list members,



MoU to teach German in KVs was in violation of the three language formula. It is in violation of the Indian Constitution. German is not listed in Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. Sanskrit is listed there.



Why is the fact that the present decision to replace German by Sanskrit is only a return to the earlier situation being hidden from discussion?
