Last week a press reporter working for Telegraph asked me "Why Sanskrit should be compulsory?"

I immediately asked her "tell me why Mathematics is compulsory subject?", she replied "it is language of science, without which you can not understand science". I replied "yes, Sanskrit is language of languages, without which you can not understand any language".

  

If you consider science is very important to live, then, u must consider communication is more so. Sanskrit is base for all perfect communications. She was quite happy.

  

We welcome the step taken by the union Govt by giving the status of Sanskrit back. We don't hate any language; We love them ; we respect them but not at the cost of our own pride.

  

with best regards,

shrivarakhedi
