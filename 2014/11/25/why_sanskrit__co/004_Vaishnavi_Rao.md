Thanks to Mc Caulay who inintiated the legacy... Indians are continuing to reject and rebel their value systems and deliberately disconnecting themselves from their roots!! At least Germans value Sanskrit, unconditionally and the British are making it compulsory in their school curriculum. Indians will take it up without any resistance when the foreigners would start making money out of selling us our own raw materials. Sanskrit is in safe hands. It will come back to us... Indians will value it when they will pay for it.... not when it is actually their own heritage and free... हा हन्त, हा धिक्....
