Namaste

The question should not have been "Why Samskrt?"

Question should rather have been "Why German?" And "Why not Samskrt?"

What is the use of German (or for that matter any other foreign language) for Indian school children?

Why should we always defend for Samskrt? Why do we not attack the questioners in their own line?

Let us say- "Samskrt is not that irrelevant as German. German is not Indian language. And we do not need it right from schooling time. To the people who forgot their roots, and are detached from love and concern for their own heritage, it is very difficult to make understand the real situation.

Thankyou.
