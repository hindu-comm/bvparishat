## Translation

The Lord continued: One who does not consider Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva or the living entities in general to be separate from the Supreme, and who knows Brahman, actually realizes peace; others do not.

This shows that the differences across the deities Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva, are only apparent and not absolute.  

\(50\) Lord Vishnu said: ‘I, Brahmâ and Lord S’iva as well, do not differ in being the supreme cause and Supersoul, the witness and the self-sufficient one of the material manifestation.) Him the Supreme Brahmân that is without a second, is as one Supersoul with both Brahmâ and S’iva, but the living ones who are not conversant with this, think of them as being separate. (53) The way a person sometimes does not make a difference between the head, hands and other parts of his own body, so does My devotee thus make no difference between living beings. (54) He who having the one nature of the three, verily does, of the Supersoul in all beings, not see the separateness, o brahmin, realizes the peace.’

So, the Lord Himself, as Para Brahman, says that the trimurtis: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are non-different from each other.  

The Brahma sutra 'जन्माद्यस्य तः’ १.१.१.२ which has the Taittiriya vākya 'यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते । येन जातानि जीवन्ति । यत् प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति । तद्विजिज्ञासस्व । तद् ब्रह्मेति ॥ - तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् ३-१-३ does not make any difference between the Trimurtis.  

Here is a short essay based on the Prashnopanishat and its bhāṣya of Sri Shankaracharya. The bhashya is not presented to suggest any advaitic perception of the Prashnopanishat but only to clarify certain terms the mantra uses therein to show that Prajapati, Rudra and Vishnu are all manifestations of One Para Brahman through the medium of 'Prāṇa':

At the beginning of the bhashyam for the Prashnopanishat 2nd chapter, Shankara says;  
  
प्राणोऽत्ता प्रजापतिरित्युक्तम् । तस्य प्रजापतित्वमत्तृत्वं चास्मिञ्शरीरेऽवधारयितव्यमित्ययं प्रश्न आरभ्यते ।  
  

Prāṇa the consumer is stated to be the Prajāpati. This, its being the prajāpati and the consumer, is being demonstrated in this body.  
  

In the 9th mantra of this Chapter we have:    

  
इन्द्रस्त्वं प्राण तेजसा रुद्रोऽसि परिरक्षिता ।  
त्वमन्तरिक्षे चरसि सूर्यस्त्वं ज्योतिषां पतिः ॥ ९ ॥  
  
9 Indra thou art, O Prana, and Rudra, too, in prowess. Thou art the Protector. Thou movest in the sky; thou art the sun, the lord of lights.  
  
The bhāṣya says:  
  
किंच, इन्द्रः परमेश्वरः त्वं हे प्राण, तेजसा वीर्येण रुद्रोऽसि संहरन् जगत् । स्थितौ च परि समन्तात् रक्षिता पालयिता ; *परिरक्षिता त्वमेव जगतः सौम्येन रूपेण* । त्वम् अन्तरिक्षे अजस्रं चरसि उदयास्तमयाभ्यां सूर्यः त्वमेव च सर्वेषां ज्योतिषां पतिः ॥  
  

Further, O Prana, you are Indra, the Supreme Lord. By valour you are Rudra, engaged in destroying the world. Again, during the time of the existence of the universe, you, in your benign aspect, are the preserver (of the universe) on every side. You move for ever in the sky by rising and setting. You are the sun, the lord of all the luminaries.  
  

For the above highlighted portion, Anandagiri, the authoritative sub-commentator, says: विष्ण्वादिरूपेण इत्यरथः । ( You, through the form of Vishnu, etc.)  
  

Now, this upanishad itself stated that Prana is Prajapati., the Creator. And in this mantra we have Rdura, another form of prāṇa, being stated as the world-destroyer. And Vishnu (the benign form, as opposed to the valorous form of Rudra) is the Protector of the world. Since the Creator, Protector and Destroyer are all said to be the forms of Prana we see that Rudra, named in the mantra itself, Vishnu not named in the mantra as well as the bhashya but named by Anandagiri, on the implication of the word 'soumyena..pasrirakṣitā' are all 'created' ones, to perform certain roles in the cosmic administration. It is well known that the three murtis perform the functions of creation, sustenance (rakshanam) and dissolution.  
  

The sequence is thus: The Puruṣa, Supreme Brahman, creates prāṇa, called Hiraṇyagarbha. From this Hirānyagarbha, the creator of all the objects, names / forms, both sentient and insentient, the deva-s too are created. The mantra that we saw above lists these. Indra, etc. including Rudra, for destruction function and Vishnu for protection function, are all manifestations of this Prana (Hiranyagarbha). While up to this it is all within the realm of creation, the ONLY entity that transcends creation is the Puruṣa who is the subject matter of the Sixth Praṣna, the final chapter of this upaniṣad.  
  

The point to be noted is: This upaniṣad provides a very interesting instance of Rudra and Vishnu as particular functionaries, with allotted portfolios, along with Indra, Sūrya, etc.  

In the Puruṣa suktam we have: पुरुष एव इदं सर्वम् \[All this is verily the Supreme\]

In the Narayana suktam we have: विश्वमेेवेदं पुरषः \[This creation is verily the Supreme\]

In the महानारायणोपनिषत् there is a mantra invoking Goddess Gayatri which says विश्वमसि \[You are everything\] :  

    चतुस्त्रिंशोऽनुवाकः .
    आयातु वरदा देवी अक्षरं ब्रह्म संमितम् .
    गायत्री छन्दसां मातेदं ब्रह्म जुषस्व नः .. १..
    यदह्नात्कुरुते पापं तदह्नात्प्रतिमुच्यते .
    यद्रात्रियात्कुरुते पापं तद्रात्रियात्प्रतिमुच्यते .
    सर्ववर्णे महादेवि सन्ध्याविद्ये सरस्वति .. २..

    पञ्चत्रिंशोऽनुवाकः .
    ओजोऽसि सहोऽसि बलमसि भ्राजोऽसि देवानां धामनामासि
    विश्वमसि विश्वायुः सर्वमसि सर्वायुरभिभूरों गायत्रीमावाहयामि
    सावित्रीमावाहयामि सरस्वतीमावाहयामि

The 'Sri Rudram' of the Krishna Yajurveda is a depiction of the entire creation as verily Lord Shiva.

So, we have the Veda itself saying in so many places that all that is is verily Vishnu, Shiva and Devi.
