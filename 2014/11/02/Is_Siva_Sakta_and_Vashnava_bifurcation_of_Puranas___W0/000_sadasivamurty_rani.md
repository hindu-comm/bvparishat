Dear Sri Nityananda Ji!

Before I start answering I request you once again to read my penultimate mail of the Chakrabandha thread in verbatim.

Now I proceed further to present my views in this context.

Whether we are Saivas or Sakteyas or Vaishnavas or Smartas (who believe in the worship of all these three deities) as we have faith in all these deities we have not any controversyin accepting the existence of Veda Vyasa also. As the followers of Indian theistic tradition we don't disagree in accepting Vyasa's authorship of 18 puranas.

In such case my question is: Did Veda Vyasa intend the bifurcation of 18 Puranas into Sakta, Saiva and Vaishna groups?

Even in such case Kurma purana comes under which group where from we had some quotes in one of my previous mails?

What is the value of the expression of Sri Krishna in the "Rudraanaam Sankarascaasmi" in the Bhagavadgita (BG Xchapter 23 sl)?

What is the worth of Vyasa's Pauranic Statement - "Siva eva harissakshhat Harireva Sivassvayam" and Sivasya hrdayam Vishnuh Vishnoscha Hrdayam Sivah".?

For the time being these are a few questions from me. I shall continue on receiving further response in this regard.
