Yes, as is said in the Puranas themselves अष्टादशपुराणानां वक्ता सत्यवतीसुतः (शिवपुराण रेवाखण्ड). Reference: पौराणिक कोश of Rana Prasada Sharma, 1986, p. 313.

Here again, one may refer the Puranic verses themselves. The classification of Puranas into Sattvika, Rajasa, Tamasa occurs in Padma, Matsya, Skanda, Linga and Devi Bhagavatam - this has been discussed on bvparishat in two threads earlier.  
  
The classification of Puranas into Vaisnava, Saiva, Sakta, Brahma, Agneya, etc also occurs in the Skanda Purana. Refer the attached snapshot of Hazari Prasad Dwivedi Granthavali, Volume 5 (ISBN 9788126713639), p. 223. [books.google.co.in/books?id=oWEcVJJ5398C&pg=PA223](http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oWEcVJJ5398C&pg=PA223)

As per the Skanda Purana classification cited above, Kurma Purana is a Saiva Purana.

Maybe enforcing the faith of followers of the Harihara form? The context needs to be seen. Srimadbhagavta 12.13.16 says वैष्णवानां यथा शम्भुः पुराणानामिदं तथा and states Siva as a Vaisnava (a follower of Visnu). Some extracts in Purana show Visnu as Supreme, some show Siva, and some show both (as above).
