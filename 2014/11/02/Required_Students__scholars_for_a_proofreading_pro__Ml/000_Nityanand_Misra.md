Namaste  
  

I have a proofreading project for which I am looking for students or scholars of Sanskrit grammar. There are two versions of a book on Sanskrit grammar (the book is entirely in Sanskrit) with 230 and 400 pages respectively. The difference is that the second version has many more citations and footnotes.  
  

Those interested may please get in touch with me at off the list. For those reading this post on the Google Groups page, my email address is in the attached image.  

  

Remuneration in line with the market rate for proofreading of Sanskrit works will be provided to student(s)/scholar(s) working on the project.  

  

Thanks, Nityanand
