To do justice to the work, the translator needs to have a good knowledge of both Saṁskṛta and Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism. The best place to find such people is obviously Vṛndāvana, where rare texts like Harināmāmṛtavyākaraṇamare traditionallytaught even today. You may also contact various branches ofGauḍīyaMaṭha. One name that comes to mind is of Bābājī Satyanārāyaṇa Dāsa, of the Jiva Institute of Vaishnava Studies, who I believe hastranslated works of Jīva Gosvamī into English. His website is <http://www.jiva.org/>. He is a member of this list as well.

  

I hope you get a good translator who at least knows the correct Vigraha of the word दिग्दर्शिनी. दिशं दर्शयितुं शीलमस्या इति दिग्दर्शिनी. सुप्यजातौ णिनिस्ताच्छील्ये (पा.सू. ३.२.७८) इति णिनिः. णेरनिटि (पा.सू. ६.४.५१) इति णिलोपः.
