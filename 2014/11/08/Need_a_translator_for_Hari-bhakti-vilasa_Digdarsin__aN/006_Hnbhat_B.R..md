The other way alternatively is to learn the language and syntax of a commentaryenough to understand the diction of the commentary oneself, after trying thestyle of the commentaries on simple works. And translation in English is not a good means to understand either the Text or the commentary.

  

Hope you can get some one who is well-versed in Vaishnava-Gaudiya philosophy and also in reading thecommentaries on philosophical works in general, to reflect the idea of the commentator in English. The first problem of translation of a commentary in general, is the retaken words and their explanations, with synonyms or a different diction explanatory, is thetranslation of the retaken textual word and its synonym or the explanation, grammatical or philosophical, is the possibility of repetition of the text and the explanation, translated into English.

  

Just like Nityananda, explained, दिग्दर्शिनी -the guidelines is literary translation. Literal translation will be shower of the direction (female gender) as the adjective of the word टीका,व्याख्या.
usually commentaries use the expressions like इति दिक् after thefull explanation isoffered which shows it is a brief explanation andone should look for other sources for a detailed knowledge of the concept of the word used in the text. There are similar problems, one could make them in the translation simplified, but with limited efficiency, like the grammatical explanations found in the commentary, as the one given by Mr.Nityananda Mishra, the efficiency of English translation to convey the grammatical derivation with the translation of the Sutra and its application is only limited and may lead confusion, if the reader himself is not well-versed in grammar and know the original Sutra and its meaning in full.
