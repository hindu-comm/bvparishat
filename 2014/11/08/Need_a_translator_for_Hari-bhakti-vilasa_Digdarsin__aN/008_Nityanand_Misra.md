Please see attached cover page, publisher details and a sample page of a Hindi commentary that I refer on the Ujjvalanīlamaṇiḥ. The translator, Bhaktivedānta Nārayaṇa Gosvāmī Mahārāja, is no more, but you may contact his successors or the Gaudiya Matha.  
  
Take a look at how natural, accurate, and faithful the translation of the first verse is, and also brings out the Śleṣa in the verse. This is the standard I would expect in the translation of the Digdarśinī.  
  
नामाकृष्टरसज्ञः शीलेनोद्दीपयन् सदानन्दम्।  
निजरूपोत्सवदायी सनातनात्मा प्रभुर्जयति॥ १ ॥  
  
तात्पर्यानुवाद – जिनके नाममात्रसे भक्तिरसिकजन आकृष्ट होते हैं, जो अपने सुन्दर स्वभावके द्वारा सदा ही अपने पिता श्रीनन्दबाबाके वात्सल्य भावको उद्दीप्त करते रहते हैं, जिनका स्वरूप सभीको उत्सव प्रदानकारी है तथा जिनका श्रीविग्रह नित्य है, उन प्रभु श्रीकृष्णकी जय होवे।  
पक्षान्तरमें – जिनकी जिह्वा श्रीकृष्णादि नामोंके द्वारा वशीभूत है, जो अपने सुन्दर स्वभावसे सत्पुरुषोंके आनन्दको उद्दीपित करते हैं, जो रूपनामक मुझ अनुगत जनके लिए उत्सव प्रदान करनेवाले हैं, जिनका नाम श्रीसनातन गोस्वामी है, उन मेरे प्रभुकी जय होवे।  
  
Now compare this with the English translation on the website of Bhaktivedanta Memorial Library. I don't want to start enlisting the flaws (there are quite a few of them), suffice to say that the below deviates a lot from rules of grammar (especially Samaasa), and is nowhere close to the Hindi translation above.

All glories to the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead. His holy name attracts those expert at relishing transcendental mellows. His transcendental qualities eternally increase the bliss of His devotees. His transcendental form brings a great festival of happiness to His devotees.  
  
This is only to highlight the difference between a translation done by an expert in Samskrita and a novice.
