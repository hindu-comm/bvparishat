I think the idea of a translation of a Sanskrit commentary itself is an absurd. It amounts to translation of a first hand translation in the language of the text, i.e. Sanskrit interpretation of the text in Sanskrit text, which is meant itself to understand the text. For example, Mitakshara commentary itself is an authority apart in Hindu law, than its original, Yajnavalkyasmriti, unlike the commentaries on Kumarasambhava, Raghuvamsha etc. by Mallinatha, and others. Instead the translation into another language of the text with notes containing the additional information from the commentary would be helpful.

I do not know the nature of the commentary Digdarshini, whether it is in Sanskrit or any other language.
