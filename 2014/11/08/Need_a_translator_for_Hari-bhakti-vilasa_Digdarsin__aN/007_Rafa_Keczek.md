You might try to contact Andrzej Babkiewicz of the Chair of South Asian Studies, University of Warsaw. He has studied Sanskrit in a traditional way in India. His PhD project is concerned, as far as I remember, with Vaiṣṇava Sanskrit compositions. He might be interested in your project.  
  
His e-mail address I have in my mailbox is: \<[andrzejb...@wp.pl]()\>.  
  
With best regards,  
Rafal Kleczek
