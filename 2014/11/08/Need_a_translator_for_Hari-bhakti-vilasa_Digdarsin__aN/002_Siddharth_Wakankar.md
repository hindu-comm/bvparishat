Hare Krishna.

Mahodaya,

          Generally, a Sanskrit Commentary is not taken up for translation,because,it itself is a guide to understand the original Text.Moreover,almost all the commentaries are quite long/extensive and it is very exhausting/time-consuming process to translate the commentaries into any other language.The only way out to understand the nuances in the Text and the Commentary is: to sit with a Guru and comprehend the same.

I hope,you get my point.
