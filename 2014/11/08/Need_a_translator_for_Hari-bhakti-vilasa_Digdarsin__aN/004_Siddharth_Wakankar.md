Hare Krishna.

  

I do know that some commentaries did get translated,but,it was not a general trend.  
I accept your view that commentaries do enable us to know the nuances and allow us to have a peep into our Cultural Heritage and hence,their translations in any other language/s are a must.It,however,is almost a Herculean task for the general scholars. Consequently, hardly anybody dares to try his/her hand at it.

We send our best wishes to your good self and your Team for undertaking this Ambitious Project.

  

Thanks and regards,

  

Prof.Wakankar
