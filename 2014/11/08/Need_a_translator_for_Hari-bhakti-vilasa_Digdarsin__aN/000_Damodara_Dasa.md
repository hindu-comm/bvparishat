Hare Krishna.  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
pranams.  
  
After searching for some time a translation of the digdarsini  
commentary of Sanatana Gosvami on Hari-bhakti-vilasa, I've got to know  
that there is no translation available. This commentary is very much  
valuable for some of our projects (especially for gaudiya vaisnavas)  
and thus I need to get it translated.  
  
I am in a search of someone who can do it. If someone is free in your  
knowledge please contact me personally and terms can be discussed.  
  
\[Note: Many translations of mula Hari-bhakti-vilasa are already available.\]  
  
Thankyou,  
Yours in Krishna's service,  
damodara das
