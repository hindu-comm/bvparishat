Namaste.  
  
Producers of the first Sanskrit animation movie, Punyakoti, deserve appreciation for venturing into such production in this commercial age. Details are published in today's Hindu news paper - <http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/first-sanskrit-animation-movie-to-crowdsource-content/article6608836.ece.Famous> music director Ilayaraja is rendering background score as the report says.

Prasad
