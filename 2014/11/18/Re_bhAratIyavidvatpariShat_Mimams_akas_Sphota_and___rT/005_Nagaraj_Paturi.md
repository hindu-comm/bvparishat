I was thinking about Paraa Vaak.



----- Sir, even parA vAk is not any 'flying in the sky'/ hanging in the sky/ something heavenly idea.



वैखर्या मध्यमायाश् च पश्यन्त्याश्चैतदद्भुतम् /

अनॆकतीर्थभॆदायास्त्रय्या वाचः परं पदम् // वाक्य्\_१।१५९ //

is a verse discussing stages( तीर्थभेदाः)of musculo-neurological process of articulation or speech sound production. The three stages mentioned here are observable/ analysable stages. परा is also a stage of speech sound production only. But since it is in the form of mental impulse or brain impulse, it is called परा. परा means beyond. Here, itmeans 'beyond the observable/ analysable stages'.





Because Sanskrit is famous for polysemy, the word shabda may have many meanings which include its use in also Shabdabrahma





-------- Dr. Joshi, If a word means something in daily use and something else in s'Astra , then it is not called polysemy. Are the general meaning of 'speed' and the Physics meaning of the word speeddifferent or the same? If they are different, is it polysemy? It is not called polysemy.



which include its use in also Shabdabrahma



----- I did not say/ mean S'abda means S'abdabrahman. The word S'abda is used in different technical senses in vAkyapadIyam. One of the most frequent and important of them is 'speech'/ 'language'.



Anyway, thanks for your openness to learn/know. Once again best wishes for your novel research.
