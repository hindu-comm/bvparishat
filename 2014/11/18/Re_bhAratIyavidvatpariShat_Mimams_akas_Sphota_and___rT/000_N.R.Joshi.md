Dear Dr. N. Paturi, Thanks for explanation on VarNa and VarNasphota.



A single Sanskrit word "Narayan" can be pronounced slight differently by a man, by a woman and by a child because frequency difference in their voices. But a listener understands it is the same word "Narayan"The common denominator (Prakriti)understood by the listener is sphota and three pronunciations are dhvanis (Vikritis).



In the same way the single letter sound pronounced by three different people may be slightly different. This is I called VarNadhvani. The common denominator is called VarNasphota.



In my new VarNavada meaning is attached to VarNasphota and not to VarNadhvani. I called it phonemic symbolism and not phonetic symbolism. It is not sound symbolism but it is VarNa symbolism. For that I took help of VarNamaalaa periodic table.



In the ancient India, Shankara, Shabara, Kumaril all discussed VarNavada but to the best of my knowledge they did not give meanings of VarNas. I call this old VarNavada. Mine is new VarNavada



I am giving the earthly character to sphota. Others may think sphota has heavenly, para , somewhere in the Shabdabrahma.



For me the Sanskrit word Shabda is sound pulse. It rises, persists, and diminishes. Theduration of this pulse depends on length of Shabda.



In the book Encyclopedia of Philosophies (Coward and Kunjjuni Raja), there is one paper that describes efforts made in the past to give earthly character to sphota instead keeping it hanging in the sky.



I recently read an article by Tandra Patnaik. She was describing some kind of grounding is needed to sphotavada. I do not have that book in front of me. My paper on Current VarNavada and New VarNavada was accepted for publication. My new VarNavada shows internal beauty of Sanskrit words (no grammar) and doing that it explains greatness of culture of India.



Thanks. N.R.Joshi

1\. If varNa and varNasphoTa are one and the same , there would have been no need of a separate term varNasphoTa.



2\. According to vyAkaraNa dars'ana, sphoTaexists independent of vyAkaraNa grantha or vyAkaraNa prakriyaa (vivichya pradars'ana roopaa prakriyaa). Whereas identity /identification of varNa is a result of the vyAkaraNa prakriyaa.That portion/aspect of sphoTa which can be acconted for as related to a given varNa is the varNasphoTa related to that varNa.



3\. The word varNa is found in vAkyapadIyam. varNasphoTa is not found there.



4\. Koundabhatta while explaining varNasphoTa , agrees that just as identification ofvarNa is agrammatical necessity, identification of varNasphoTa is also a necessity arising out of that necessity and it as thejAtisphoTa alone that exists independent of grammar's process.



सत्यासत्यौ तु यौ भागौ प्रतिभावं व्यवस्थितौ

सत्यं यत्तत्र सा जाति रसत्या व्यक्तयो मताः -73



5\. Another important point is that the necessity ofrecognition of varNasphoTa is closely tied to the signification/ meaning communicating aspect of sphoTa. Prof. S D Joshiand others whoopine that themeaning communicating aspect of sphoTa was not originally in the Bhartrhari's usage of the word sphoTa can not even agree with the recognition of varNasphoTa for this reason only.



6\. VaiyAkaraNa philosophy does not accept that all the varNas of a pada are associated with meaning. Only those varNas (such as single varNa pratyayas)which are recognized by vyAkaraNaas associated with some grammatical function or meaning are considered to be associated , at least for grammatical purposes, with meaning. Kaundabhatta seems to feel the necessity of recognizing varNasphoTa to discuss sphoTa in relation tosuch varNas only.
