I shall limit this post only to your ideas such as 'para' (parA)'shabdabrahama' (s'abdabrahman) are some ideas 'hanging in sky' 'some heavenly' etc.



1\. When you study s'Astras such as vyAkaraNa dars'anayourprevious understandings about the words in the s'Astra that you might have heard through popular discourses /conversations etc. should be completely set aside and you must be prepared tounlearn those previous understandings of you about those words and their meanings.



2\. Particularly when you are studying a book such as vAkyapadIyam, you must realize that an author whocan go to the extent of sayingऋषीणामपि यज्ज्ञानं तदप्यागमपूर्वकम् 1-30,

ऋषीणां दर्शनं यच् च तत्त्वॆ किं चिद् अवस्थितम् /न तॆन व्यवहारॊ ऽस्ति न तच् छब्दनिबन्धनं 2-139

व्याघ्रादिव्यपदॆशॆन यथा बालॊ निवर्त्यतॆ /असत्यॊ ऽपि तथा कश् चित् प्रत्यवायॊ ऽभिधीयतॆ 2-321

संप्रत्ययार्थाद् बाह्यॊ ऽर्थः सन्न् ***असन् वा*** विभज्यतॆ ...............2-445 (emphasis mine)

should be extremely rational.

3\. Coming to the concepts such as s'abdabrahma, one needs to first understand the concept of brahman, and then needs to know that there are various views of brahman such as' brahman as nAda (music)-nAdabrahman' 'brahman as s'abda (speech/language)-s'abdabrahman' etc. Totake the help of modern understandings in comprehending these ideas one notion that comes to help is the notion of holism and holistic view of things. For example, if one views the whole universe as an ecosystem, it is the ecological holistic view of the universe. Similarly if one views the whole universe as a bio-chemical process , it is the biochemicalholistic perspective. There are many such holismsin existence in modern studies. Similarly, ifuniverse is taken as a kind of music, it is the musical holistic view of the universe; if the whole universe is taken as a kind of speech, it is the linguistic holistic view of the universe. nAdabrahman and s'abdabrahman are concepts close to these two concepts of musical holistic view of the universe and linguistic holistic view of the universe respectively. Why only 'close to' but not 'the same as' ? Because the concept of brahman is close to the concept of universe but not the same as the concept of universe.



4\. Let me rephrase the definition of the Brahman in an open ended way , but at the same time in a way aviruddha to the approach of theUpanishads, which is followed by vAkyapadIyam. If there is an absolutely and ultimately imperishable (akshara) unique (advitIyam)entity out of which everything around (sarvam khalu idam brahma), ismade/evolved/manifest , that entity is called the Brahman. If one agrees that such an entity exists, he is a BrahmavAdi. If one believes that there is no entity which is ultimately and absolutely imperishable, he is not a BrahmavAdi. If one believes that everything around is not made/evolved/manifest from the same entity he is not a BrahmavAdi. If a BrahmavAdi takes the linguistic view of the Brahman he is a s'abdabrahmavAdi.Where are these ideas hanging in sky or somewhere heavenly?
