Dear Scholars,  
  
The wonderment of search engines for Sanskrit texts can be experienced here in this link :  
  
<http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/sanskrit-scans/query.php>  
  
This search engine is creation of Dr. Oliver Hellwig. Excellent work he has done on his own alone. We must congratulate him for this contribution.  
  
He has announced this on Indology list recently. try.  
  
with regards,  
shrivarakhedi
