I have tried Dr. Hellwig's product for Sanskrit OCR and it is very good indeed.

  

I believe CDAC developed a Hindi OCR. I think this is the page -<http://ildc.in/htm/ocr_spell.htm> (an old version), and they have something here -<http://cdac.in/index.aspx?id=mc_ocr_ocr> which deals with multiple scripts. Maybe Dr. Ramanujan can comment the state of these projects.
