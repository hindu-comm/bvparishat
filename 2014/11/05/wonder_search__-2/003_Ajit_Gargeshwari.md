The images will be of low quality fort he software to do OCR. I don't think the software does a 100% OCR either. Its still under development and a lot of works needs to be done.  
Its a pity with so many software professionals in India no one is interested in pursuing a good OCR software for Indian languages particularly Sanskrit. This issue is partly technical more than technical it the willingness to develop one. I don't think funding should be an issue if the software can be improved.
