Dear Sir,  
  

Yes, it is *anavarthaka* as you said! So, Dr. Hellwig is using his improved OCR technology on the pdf/jpg formats, to retrieve the output. Hope, he'll enrich the database with more texts (as of now, he has considered ASS, KM and TSS in which typical glyphs are followed). Congrats and thanks to him.  
  

Regards,  
Prasad
