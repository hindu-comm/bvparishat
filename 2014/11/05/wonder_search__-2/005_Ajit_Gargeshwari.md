Whats the percentage the software recognizes anything less than 98 % is bad, ideal should be 100% which might not be possible



So if I have a small book say 30,000 words at 98% would be 1200 un recognized words. The accuracy needs to be higher especially in Sanskrit as tolerance for un recognized words will be less compared to say English  
  
How effective will it be unless it has a support from an established software like Abby fine reader. Asking these questions as a user not as an expert
