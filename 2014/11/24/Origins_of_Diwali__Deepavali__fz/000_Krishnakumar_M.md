Namaste,

  

Is there any information available on the origins of the Diwali festival? How old is this? Is there any actual reference to this festival (by name) in the scriptures - puranas, ithihasas, smrithis etc?
The popular stories of Rama returning to Ayodhya or Krishna killing Narakasura seem rather recent.

  

There is a difference between the celebration dates in South and North India. In south it is celebrated on the Naraka Chaturdashi day while in the north it is on Amavasi.

  

pranams,

  

Krishna Kumar
