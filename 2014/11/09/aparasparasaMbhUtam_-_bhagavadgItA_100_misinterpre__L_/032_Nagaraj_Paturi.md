1\. I was trying exactly to avoidस्वतर्कानुधावन onlyon my part in trying to catch up with the approach of Bhagavatpaada S'ankara.



2.As is well known, in commentarial sentence- building an explained /interpreting expression being followed by an explaining/ elaborating/ interpreting expression is a regular practice. Suchsecond expression is not considered to be punarukti.Such acommentarial expression style is quite often found in the verses of s'Astra-works too.I was saying that S'ankara' words किंच, अपरस्परसंभूतं कामप्रयुक्तयोः स्त्रीपुरुषयोः अन्योन्यसंयोगात् जगत् सर्वं संभूतम्indicate that S'ankara took the second half of the verse to be in such a commentarial structure.



3\. नञ followers are not linking अपरस्परसंभूतम् withकामहैतुकम् . They are linking परस्पर with धर्माधर्मसंबद्धकर्मजन्मसंबंध.



.4.Iam only trying to catch up with the reasoning followed by different approaches classifiedby Prof. Korada.
