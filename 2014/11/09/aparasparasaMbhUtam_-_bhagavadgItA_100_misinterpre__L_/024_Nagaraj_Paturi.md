The following classification by Prof. KoradaSubrahmanyam is very much useful in arriving at some clarity:



1. those commentators who did not attempt / interpret the term 'अपरस्पर’ at all  

2. those who took it as नञ्समास  

3. those who quoted Panini but did not take the original meaning



Does Prof.Korada differ with #1? No , I believe. I think his response to them is thatthey should not have ignored such an important word.

His dispute is with #2 and #3 only.



Where does Bbhagavatpada S'ankara stand in this classification? He falls under #1.



May I draw the attention of the list to the fact that the topic under discussion in 16-8 is आसुरी प्रवृत्तिः as per theGeetaa. It is Bhagavatpada S'ankara , who bringshome the abstract idea of आसुरी throough the example of lOkAyatas. It is he who adds thepoint " -इति लोकायतिकदृष्टिः इयम् ".

Does S'ankara mean Bhagavaan Krishna is telling Arjuna about lokAyatas in these s'lokas ? I don't think S'ankara means that. Does S'ankara mean that Bhagavan Krishna kept the example of lokAyatas in mind while talking about आसुरी प्रवृत्तिः in these s'lokas? I don't think S'ankara meant even that. Did S'ankara mean Vedavyasa/ author of these s'lokas in the gItA kept lokAyatas in mind while composing these s'lokas? May be yes, may be no. He is certainly trying to help us understand the concept of आसुरी प्रवृत्तिः by giving us an example from the contemporary/ historically real group of people holding the views described in the s'lokas.Does S'ankara mean that the entire description of आसुरी प्रवृत्तिः in the sixteenth chapter is done keeping only lokAyatas in mind? I don't think he means that. Nor is it possible that all the s'lokas on आसुरी प्रवृत्तिः in the sixteenth chapter are description of lokAyatas only. (Strangely one of the commentators brings Buddhism as anexample.). But as far as 16-8 is concerned, S'ankara was interpreting 'किमन्यत्कामहैतुकम् ' part of the s'loka by saying, 'किमन्यत् जगतः कारणम्? न किंचित् अदृष्टं धर्माधर्मादिकारणांतरं विद्यते जगतः 'काम एव प्राणिनां कारणम्' इति लोकायतिक दृष्टिः इयम् '. Most of the commentators are trying to fit अपरस्परसंभूतम् also into this argument.



It is not possible to mix approaches of #2 and क्रियासातत्य meaning.



#2 is based on the idea that परस्परसंभूतम् has to do with अदृष्टं धर्माधर्मादिकारणांतरं and अपरस्परसंभूतम् and नञ part in that means न किंचित् अदृष्टं धर्माधर्मादिकारणांतरं.



Prof. Korada, by repeatedly bringing chArvAkas into discussion is following S'ankara only. He wants to argue that क्रियासातत्य meaning is essential for seeing अपरस्परसंभूतम् as a chArvAka argument.



#1 of the above classification did not go wrong. They overlooked.



Prof. Korada is disputing #2 fully, #3 partially.
