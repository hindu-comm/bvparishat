Sir, as per your quotation from amarakosa sudha, it is more clear that when the agents of a kriyaa are many , then only the usage occurs. The meaning of the term aparaspara is one by one. You cannot use this word for a single agent. The boy is going one by one. Is it correct?. In our context, the agent jagath is singular.please note that both in panini and amarakosa the term is given in plural. And the exampls are also in plural. I dont think it as an unintentional.
