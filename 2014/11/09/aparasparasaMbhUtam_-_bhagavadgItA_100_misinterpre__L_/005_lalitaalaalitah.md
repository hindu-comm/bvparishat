I hope siva kumar is not trying to say that all studies which are based on questioning things and scholars who question, are wrong.  
I hope he is not trying to say that we should stop our intellectual pursuit.  
But, if he is trying to say the mentioned, it will be demoralizing for scholars/questioners.
