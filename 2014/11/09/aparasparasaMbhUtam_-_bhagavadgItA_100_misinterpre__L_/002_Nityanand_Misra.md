Before concluding that so many learned commentators were all affected bypramāda(the “impressive” list of the “accussed” includes the founder of almost every influential Sampradāya in India, in addition to modern writers and leaders of “societies”), I recommend we consider the possibility that the commentators have taken **suṭ** in **aparaspara** in BG 16.8 to be Ārṣa. This is likely since not only PS 6.1.144, but the Amarakoṣa also notes that –

कर्म क्रिया तत्सातत्ये गम्ये स्युरपरस्पराः (AK 3.2.231)

So if all these commentators, most of whom knew both Amarakoṣa and Aṣṭādhyāyī by heart and quoted from the texts liberally, offered an explanation which does not conform to the two texts, my view is that they have concluded **aparaspara** in BG 16.8 to be Ārṣa usage and accordingly held that PS 6.1.144 and AK 3.2.231 do not apply. They have not explicitly stated so, but that is my humble conclusion on reading that many amongst them offer a Vigraha like **aparaśca paraśca** (अपरश्च परश्च) and yet give the meaning of अन्योऽन्य and not सातत्य as perAmarakoṣa and Aṣṭādhyāyī.

प्रसङ्गेऽस्मिन् तेषां मते सुडार्ष इति बोध्यम्.

My Guru’s commentary offers a grammatical explanation of अपरस्पर in BG 16.8 by पृषोदरादि argument, which is different from the explanation by PS 6.1.144. The below extract can be used to explain or justify the view of all previous commentators who have not offered the सातत्य meaning –

श्रीराघवकृपाभाष्यम्  
संस्कृत - अपरस्मादितरपुरुषात्परस्मिन्नन्यकलत्रे सम्भूतं शास्त्रविहितगर्भाधानवर्जितम्  
हिन्दी - ‘अपरस्मात् परस्मिन् कलत्रे सम्भूतम्’ इस विग्रह में सुप्सुपा समास और पृषोदरादित्वात् ‘सुट्’ आगम हुआ।  
<http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/pdfs/JR1998GitabhasyamII.pdf>

In addition, several commentators and authors have noted the relevance of PS 6.1.144 in this context. Nīlakaṇṭha’s interpretation is as per PS 6.1.144 only (which Dr. Korada has pointed out, whether he agrees or not with Nīlakaṇṭha is a different matter). Another commentator, Dhanapati Sūri (in his Bhāṣyotkarṣadīpikā) has contradicted Nīlakaṇṭha’s explanation and has also quoted the extract with PS 6.1.144 from Nīlakaṇṭha (again one may agree or disagree with him, but he has considred the possibility of applyingPS 6.1.144)–

यत्तु “अपरस्पराः क्रियासातत्ये इति सुट् बीजाङ्कुरवत्परस्परकारणीभूतानां धर्माधर्मवासनानां यत्सातत्यं तस्मात्सम्भूतं किमन्यल्लोकेऽस्ति नि किंचिदपि धर्मापेक्षयोत्पद्यते किं तु सर्वं कामहेतुकं स्त्रीपुरुषयोर्मिथुनीभावः कामस्तदुत्थस्वभावादेव जन्तुर्जायते न त्वदृष्टादि इत्यन्ये”। तदुपेक्ष्यम्। अप्रतिष्ठमित्यनेन पौनरुक्त्यापादकस्य क्लिष्टकल्पनस्यान्याय्यत्वात्।

More than 60 years ago, Sahajānanda Sarasvatī wrote in the Gītāhṛdaya (first edition publised in late 1940s) –

बहुत लोगों ने इस आठवें श्लोक के अर्थ में अपने संस्कृत के व्याकरणज्ञान का अजीर्ण मिटाया है। उनने कहा है कि अपर तथा पर शब्दों का समास होने पर अपरपर होगा न कि अपरस्पर; हालाँकि ‘अपरस्परा: क्रियासातत्ये’ (पा. ६.१.१४४) के अनुसार ही अपरस्पर बनता है। यहाँ क्रियासातत्य या काम का जारी रहना तो हई। सारा संसार ही निरन्तर पदार्थों के सम्मिश्रण से ही बनता है। इसमें जरा भी विराम नहीं है।  
I do not have the full reference now, but the work can be read here –

Prof. Vineet Chaitanya has already pointed out Mahārājaśrī Akhaṇḍānanda Sarasvatī’s explanation.

One thing to note is that saints like of Sahajānanda Sarasvatī and Mahārājaśrī Akhaṇḍānanda Sarasvatī were among the greatest scholars of India in the 20^(th) century. Despite offering a different explanation by PS 6.1.144, they have not stated that all previous explanations were mistranslations or misinterpretations. In my opinion, the claim that a verse has been misunderstood by everybody for 1200 years by everybody is quite “revolutionary,” and many traditionalists may not accept it. I leave it to other scholars on the list to offer their views.

Lastly, thanks to Dr. Korada for initiating this interesting discussion. Hope the Korāḍīya commentary on Gītā brings out more such claims and we can have more such discussions on BVP.
