नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

I recommend we consider the possibility that the commentators have taken**suṭ**in**aparaspara**in BG 16.8 to be Ārṣa - -  

  

                                   
Vidvan Nityananda Misra

  

please make your opinion clear - whom do you support ? --

  

1. those commentators who did not attempt / interpret the term 'अपरस्पर’ at all

  

2. those who took it as नञ्समास

  

3. those who quoted Panini but did not take the original meaning

  

or still others who went awry .

  

In which commentary is it at least hinted that it is an आर्षप्रयोग ?

  

If you recommend , which commentary you have had in mind ? Just name one and proceed .

  

When the usage is there and the meaning is also clear and when any other type of commentary shall not be faithful to the concept and doctrine of Carvakas as shown -

  

why to go to आर्ष ?

  

If there is any difference in the form, and not meaning, of a Sabda then only, we call it आर्ष ।

Unless and until you quote a single or more commentaries and apply आर्ष , what is the purpose of such discussion ?

  

Are you not setting aside all others when you resort to one commentary to apply आर्ष ?

I did not show any disrespect to any commentator .

  

Please note -

  

Patanjali illustrated - अर्श आद्यच् - दुग्धा गावः , विभक्ता भ्रातरः

  

वनाय पीतप्रतिबद्धवत्साम् यशोधनो धेनुमृषेर्मुमोच (रघु)

  

- पीतम् अस्याः अस्तीति पीतम्

  

You may take बहुव्रीहि also - अपरस्परं संभूतं यस्य तत् अपरस्परसंभूतं जगत् ।

  

I have already said - there is सामानाधिकरण्यम् ।

  

आकृतिगण can never be considered on a par with आर्ष / पृषोदरादि ।

  

**The situation is that one cannot take any single commentary (or two) and claim it is correct .**

  

**By selecting one , please note, you are belittling others - same coin .**

  

That's why I said - 100 commentaries - I am not in limbo.

  

but even now if there is any commentary that conforms to Panini let us welcome it .

  

How can anyone neglect the rare term selected by Vedavyasa and interpret in a different way ?

  

Any deviation from the original meaning would certainly affect the doctrine of Carvakas - नास्ति प्रलयः ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
