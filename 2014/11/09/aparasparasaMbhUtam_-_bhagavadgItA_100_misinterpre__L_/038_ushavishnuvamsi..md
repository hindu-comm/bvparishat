Sir, having very well understood your vyaakhyaanam, i ask again the same question that-  
as per the vigraha apare cha pare cha , the agent of the action sambhavanam must be plural. Here it is singular -jagath. And if jagath is the agent it cannot be connected to a term which entered into a compound especially saamaanaadhikaranyena. My english is poor. I hope you may pick my argument.It is very well given in my sanskrit post. "Gamakatvaat "and devadattasya gurukula are different and not relevent here. My arguement is this- the term aparaspara cannot be connected in a grammatically right way unless it is a synonim of satata.but grammatically it is impossibe to be so.please consider the point's i made in my skt post one by one and let us proceed. With respects..vishnunambutiri.
