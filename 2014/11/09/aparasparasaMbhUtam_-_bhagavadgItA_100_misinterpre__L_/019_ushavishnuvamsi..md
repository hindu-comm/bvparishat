Yes. One can interpret differently.One can disagree with the existing
interpretations.But how can one announce that all those are simply mistakes?Each comentator has their point of views . Aparaspra canbe interpreted in many ways.The word kamahaitukam is wrong as per Panini. Sut in aparaspara also maybe apaniniya. The very intention of the verse is the same in all the comentatries including Koradeeyam as far as i understud.  
I requist you Please dont misinterpret my intention.

Ubrah
