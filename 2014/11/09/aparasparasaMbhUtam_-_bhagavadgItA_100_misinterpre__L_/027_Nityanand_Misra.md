Hopefully the below is clear

I cannot support or oppose if a term has not been commented upon.

अपरस्पर as a नञ्समास is perfectly Paninian. It is used as a नञ्समास in नाट्यशास्त्र verse 17-18. Please see attached. I do not see any problem with वनमालिमिश्र's interpretation of the अपरस्पर as a नञ्समास.

नीलकण्ठ, जीव गोस्वामी, सहजानन्द सरस्वती, अखण्डानन्द सरस्वती all quoted क्रियासातत्ये verse, and have interpreted accordingly, the first two as पञ्चमी तत्पुरुष (सातत्यात् संभूतम्/अनाद्यपरम्परासम्भूतम्). Whether they have the "original meaning" or not is subjective. In your opinion they do not, but that is not my opinion. My opinion is that they all have taken सातत्य of some क्रिया or another.

By (1), (2), (3) or "those who went awry", are we to conclude those who went "awry" is this category (4) then that you hinted in another thread?

That is my opinion, not hinted in any commentary. I am expressing a possibility. In many commentaries we find commentators say things like  
1) सपत्निवृद्धावित्यत्र ह्रस्व आर्षः (शिरोमणिटीका on रामायण २.८.२६), सपत्निवृद्धावित्यार्षो ह्रस्वः (तिलकटीका on रामायण २.८.२६)  
2) शेष्ये शयिष्ये। इडभाव आर्षः। (भूषणटीका on रामायण २.१०३.१४)  
3) अत्र नुमार्षः (अन्वितार्थप्रकाशिका on भागवत ३.२३.५४, ६.१४.४४, ९.३.७)  
In addition, we have a famous परिभाषा also - आगमशास्त्रमनित्यम्. My opinion is based on the above. If despite Amara and Panini certain commentators have not taken क्रियासातत्य meaning then it is likely they have assumed सुट् to be आर्ष that is it.

I am expressing my own views here. If original views are not found in commentaries, one can say ask is the purpose of the whole thread then?

How can justifying commentators A and B set aside/belittle commentators C and D? I have not said anything about others.

पृषोदरादि is an आकृतिगण.

I have not held a single commentary or two to be correct, nor have I belittled any Acharya. Supporting one commentary is not the same as belittling others.
