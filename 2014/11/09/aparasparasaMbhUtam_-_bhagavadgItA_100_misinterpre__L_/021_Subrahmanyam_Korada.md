नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Sorry for some missing words in my previous mail. The revised version is:  

  

                              - Vidvan
Vineet Chaitanya

  

  

1\. The first question is dealt with - the statement is correct .

  

  

2.Indeterminacy of"कार्य-कारण भाव" naturally comes in the picture because of "क्रिया-सातत्य".

  

I do not know what is meant by this -

  

अपरस्पराः सार्थाः गच्छन्ति / अपरस्पराणि वाहनानि गच्छन्ति --

  

where is कार्यकारणभाव ? मृत्तिका is कारणम् - घटः कार्यम् । ईश्वरः कारणम् - जगत् कार्यम् ।

  

much less ' indeterminacy ' - what is the context and intended meaning ?

  

       3. The main characteristic of materialists isthe conviction about the appearance of "चेतन" from "जड" as an epi-phenomena.  

  

Let me explain what Carvakas say about चैतन्यम् -

  

There are four elements - पृथिवी , अप् , तेजस् and वायु -

  

the देह is formed by the four elements - then

  

just like excitement is born from किण्व ( a kind of gum used in the preparation of wine - India) , चैतन्यम् is born out of the देह ।

  

Such a चैतन्यविशेष्टदेह only is called आत्मा ।

  

**बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत्** says चैतन्यम् will go away along with body at the time of death -

  

**विज्ञानघन एव एतेभ्यः समुत्थाय न हि प्रेत्य संज्ञास्ति** (they quote)

  

प्रेत्य = having died ; संज्ञा = चैतन्यम्

  

According to Veda it is - सर्वं चेतनावत् - so no problem with जड also .

  

But for Carvakas something is to be created for जड - that may be -

  

epi-phenomena .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
