नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Vidvan Vineet Chaitanya --

  

  

1. In the passage I quoted, it is explicitly mentioned:  
  
          " क्रिया-सातत्य अर्थमें अपरस्पर शब्दका प्रयोग होता है."  

  

This statement is okay .

  

2. "कार्य-कारण भाव" naturally comes in the picture because of "क्रिया-सातत्य".  

  

No , there is no any proof / प्रमाणम् to say so . The vehicles are going continuously , bu there is no any kind of संबन्ध between/among them.

  

3. The main characteristic of materialists is the appearance of "चेतन" from "जड" as an epi-phenomena.  

  

It can be - they are stamped as पशोरपि पशुः by Vacaspatimisra

  

                              ( भामती , ब्रह्मसूत्रशांकरभाष्यम् 3-3-54) ,

  

Also refer to 1-1-4 , न्यायवार्तिकतात्पर्यतीका of Vacaspatimisra.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
