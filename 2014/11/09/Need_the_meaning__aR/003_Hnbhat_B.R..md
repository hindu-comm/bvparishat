Please give the grammatical status of eachwords before you interpret. as far as I know

  

Please read the discussion in the link provided at least, than giving a random interpretation of your imagination.

  

Anyhow, आविस् is an is an अव्यय which is repeated. आविरावीः the lengthening of "I" in the second. The normal usage is आविर्भवति, आविरस्ति etc. meaning आविर्भवति - प्रकाश भवति, आविः प्राकाश्ये. and not as पुनः पुनः। Please provide the reference to the dictionary or commentary where you found such an interpretation.

  

एथि is the लोट् tense of the verb अस् = भुवि = to be, and does not mean "to provide".

  

Please read the discussion in the link for detailed interpretation given by the commentator.
