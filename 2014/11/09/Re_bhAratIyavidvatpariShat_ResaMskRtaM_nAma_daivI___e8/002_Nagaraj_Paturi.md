"Here is no question of origin of a language. And why should you confuse between two divergent views, presented independent of each other?"



------Dr. H N Bhat almost said it.



1.The theory of origin of Sanskrit from proto Indo-european is a historical/ diachronic theory. It is unnecessarily quite often pitched against the दैवीवाक् theory. दैवीवाक् is not a historical statement.



2\. Sphota theory again is not a historical / diachronic theory. It is not even a theory about Sanskrit alone. Though Vaakyapadeeyam deals with the ideas of Sanskrit as a शिष्टव्यवहारसिद्ध language and as such incorporating Dharma in it etc., most of its remaining its discussion is a universally applicable theory of speech/language in general. Even its discussion on Sanskrit is not historical.



3\. शब्दनित्यत्व andशब्दानित्यत्व theories too are not covering any historical/diachronic question. These theories are centred around the synchronic question of whether one needs a concept of a creator /controller for explaining aspects such as production, शब्दार्थसंबंध (signifier-signified relation) etc., of शब्द. नित्यत्व = there is no need of such a concept of a creator /controller for explaining aspects such as production, शब्दार्थसंबंध (signifier-signified relation) etc., of शब्द; अनित्यत्व = there is a need of such a concept of a creator /controller for explaining aspects such as production, शब्दार्थसंबंध (signifier-signified relation) etc., of शब्द. Naiyaayikasborrow the word ईश्वरः as the name of this concept and argue that such a concept is necessary for explaining aspects such as production, शब्दार्थसंबंध (signifier-signified relation) etc., of शब्द;Their position is calledशब्दानित्यत्व position. Mimamsakas and VaiyaakaraNas argue that such a concept is notnecessary. Their position is called शब्दनित्यत्वपक्ष . Both the positions are ahistorical/synchronic only.



4\. Within the historicaltheories, the theory of origin of Sanskrit from proto Indo-european is an evolutionary theory deduced from the taxonomical theory of Indo-european family of languages. Deducing evolution from taxonomyhad its prototype in biology. The validity of such a deduction of evolution from taxonomy and conjecturingorigin of all the classified entities from one single 'proto'entityitself is questionableand falsifiable.



5\. In any case, there is no need to mixmodern historical theories and the above mentioned ahistorical theories and get confused.
