Sir  
  
This statement is quite surprising given the vehement refutation of  
Sphotavaada by Kumarila in his Slokavartika. I would like to know if  
there is any Mimamsa text which speaks approvingly of Sphota or whose  
taatparya is in the acceptance of Sphota. If the conclusion is not  
based on a specific text, then if it is possible to show the reasons  
as to why such a position is tenable, I would be indebted to you.  
  
With best regards  
N. Siva Senani
