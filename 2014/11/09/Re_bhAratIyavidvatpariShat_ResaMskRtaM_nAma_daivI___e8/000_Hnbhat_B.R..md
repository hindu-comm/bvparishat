There is no confusion. Either you can follow the history of language or comparative Linguistics or historical linguistics to which the finding of sanskrit Language was a guidance to develop the comparative Philology. And the origin of Language is another topic in different languages and each Language has got its own theory according to the Literary sources, who created the language first. So Like Jewish sources, Indian sources also have their own theory, which ascribes divine origin. And also there is two other theories whether शब्द is नित्य and अनित्य which arises from वर्ण-s नित्य or अनित्य. According to the Ancient Literature of India-s, Veda-s it originated by itself and Nitya according to मीमांसक-s views and Naiyayika-s do not agree to it, So you are free to follow any one of the schools for Indian theory of origin of Languages. The vocal sounds are temporary nature as they speech sounds dissolve in the air and it may be possible to retrieve them scientifically, I am not sure. कदम्बमुकुलन्याय or वीचीतरङ्गन्याय.
According to Naiyayika-s it is created by God and not any human being based on Vedic citations. so it is created by either by the Creator God Brahma, as taught by Vishnu. It was देवभाषा and created by देव for the use of human beings to communicate with them. This is theory based on the belief of Indian Culture and people following it about the origin of the language. Hence it is called दैवी वाक्. It is वाल्मीकि who braught the दैवी वाक् to human world for the use by the human beings. T

स्फोटवाद or अखण्डशब्दब्रह्म is the invention of मीमांसक-s and later accepted by by वैयाकरण-s advocated by भर्तृहरि based on वर्णनित्यत्व. This does not require any historical linguistics or comparative philology, as it is related with the sounds and especially speech sounds which form the language. Here is no question of origin of a language.
And why should you confuse between two divergent views, presented independent of each other?

  

There have been so many discussion on PIT theory and AIT theory regarding the origin of Sanskrit language and read related literature AND the discussions. Both do not converge at any point.
