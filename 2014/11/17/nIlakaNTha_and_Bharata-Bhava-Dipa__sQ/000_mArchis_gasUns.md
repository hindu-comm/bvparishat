Namaste,

  

As per James L. Fitzgerald at <http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Sanskrit_in_Classics_at_Brown/Mahabharata/MBh2Biblio.html#Citrashala> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neelakantha_Chaturdhara> the best book (<http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball2185/> agrees) with nīlakaṇṭha is this:

  

The Northern Indian Popular Sanskrit Text with the Main Popular Commentary: SrimanMahābhāratam with the Bhāratabhāvadīpa of Nīlakaṇṭha, 8 vols. (including the Harivaṃśa), (Pune: Citrashala Press, 1929-1936). I found it at <http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/mahabharata-with-commentary-of-nilakantha-sanskrit-only-in-seven-volumes-IHL673/> and ready to order it, but wanted to check if there is such a .pdf as well, because <https://archive.org/details/mahabharata_nk> did not worked for me. Thanks in advance,

  

Greetings from Moscow,

Dr. M.G.
