Dear Prof.Kannan,

  

Thanks for this info.I will try to get it

I already have a book with Hindi translation by some Dr.Dvivedi from Kashi Vidyapeeth. We know each other.

What I specifically need is those books mentioned in my mail.Other material is with me.Many books in Marathi on the Ramaraksha-stotra are with me.

  

Warm regards,

  

Siddharth Wakankar
