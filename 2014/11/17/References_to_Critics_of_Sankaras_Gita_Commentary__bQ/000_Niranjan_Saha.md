Dear List,

For handy/ readymade reference, could any body help me find out places/verses where critics like Ramanuja, Madhva, Bhaskara (Anandavardhana, Ramakantha, Rajanaka, Abhinavagupta) have criticised Sankara in explicit/implicit terms in their respective Gita commentaries.  

  

I'll also appreciate to know if any other ancient commentators (barring the abovementioned commentators) of the Gita have criticised Samkara explicitly/implicitly in their respective commentaries on the Gita.

  

With best regards,

Niranjan Saha
