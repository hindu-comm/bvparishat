Easiest thing is to go through the commentaries. Here is a Supersite,  
where many of the commentaries are given, including traditional  
ones,Ramanuja, Madhva, Ramakantha, etc. find out the criticism on  
Shankara's commentary by personally mentioning or quoting his lines or  
his ideas.

Hope best of luck.
