That depends.  

We will have to see what was the prakaraNa when brahmA composed this stutiH.  

It is not necessary that he was talking of nirvisheSha-tattva, as we generally say elsewhere.  
  

Another thing, she may be targeted as svisheSha and nirvisheSha both in a single stutiH, so there is no hard and fast rule to declare anything without knowing context and stutiH both.

Not necessary.  

Even devatA-s need anugraha of another devatA-s to get and maintain qualities. That's why they are seen doing dhyAna, yaGYA, etc.

Searching purANa-s is best here.  

We need some specialist of purANa-s who could put verse after verse without influencing it's originality.
