Thank you Sir for the reply. I was a little curious about this particular expression in the shloka:

  
  
या ब्रह्माच्युतशंकरप्रभृतिभिर्देवैः सदा पूजिता  
  

In popular understanding Saraswati is Brahmā's consort. And if Brahmā is the composer of this verse, is it that he is 'devoted' to Saraswati as her devotee? Also, that She is 'always' worshiped by Achyuta and Shankara. In view of this, is it possible that She is a Shakti higher than all the trimurtis? Any comments, inputs from scriptural and other literary works are welcome.  
  
warm regards
