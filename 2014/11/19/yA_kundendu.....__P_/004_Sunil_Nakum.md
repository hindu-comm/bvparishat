Reviewing an old thread,

  

"कुन्देन्दुतुषारहारधवला" - What does it correctly translates to?

  

तुषार = Snow, हार = A Garland *of Pearls*, धवल = Dazzling White

  

I found sometimes it's translated to as "(Devi Saraswati) shines like Garland of Snow" and sometimes as "(she) shines like the Garland of Pearls".

  

Thanks,  

Sunil
