Revered Swamiji,  
  
Not sure if it helps but I saw this post by RKM Delhi on Facebook today.  
  
"The philosophy of Advaita Vedanta has been condensed in this sloka from the Baalabodhini, attributed to Sri Sankaracharya:  
  
slokärdhena pravakshyämi yad-uktam granthakotibhih \|  
brahma satyam jagan-mithyä jivo brahmaiva näparah \|\|  
  
‘With half a shloka I will declare what has been said in thousands of volumes: Brahman is real, the world is false, the soul is only Brahman, nothing else.’"  
  
Regards,  
  
Sandeep
