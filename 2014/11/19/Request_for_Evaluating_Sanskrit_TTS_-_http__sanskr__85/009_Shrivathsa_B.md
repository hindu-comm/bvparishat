It didn't play on firefox on my machine. The website showed that quicktime plugin was needed to play (an icon beside the address on the address bar). When i clicked on it, it showed me a plugin which failed to download. I don't know if I am the only one facing this problem. right clicking didn't show up anything to solve the problem.
