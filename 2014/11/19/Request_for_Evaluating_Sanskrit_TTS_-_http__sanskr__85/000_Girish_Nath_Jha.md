Dear scholars  
  
As a results of a Ph.D. work by Diwakar Mishra  
(<http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/rstudents/diwakarmishra.html>), we have been  
able to develop a Sanskrit TTS which is ready for launch. But before  
we do that we need to evaluate it and add some additional routines to  
improve voice and pronunciation quality. You are requested to give a  
few minutes of your valuable timer to help this project. Please go to  
<http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/ttstest/index.jsp> and listen to the TTS  
outputs and rank them. Your help will be appreciated and  
acknowledged.  
  
Thanks
