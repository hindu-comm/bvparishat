I tried the TTS evaluation tool on my Mozilla Firefox (Version 33.0), and it worked fine. I just need to give an initial permission for the Quicktime plugin to run, and then again permit the browser to run the outdated plugin.  
  
I participated in both sets of evolution (rating the audios, and then typing the heard words). It is a commendable effort. About 70% of the words are intellegible. Naturalness, though, needs to be improved. Some syllables, like ईकार sound unnaturally long, and some consonant sounds are lost/garbled in samyuktaksharas.. Ironing these out gradually, it can be a valuable tool.
