Dear Dr. Girish ji,  
  

I tried the evaluation 1, out of the two parameters you chose, around five files are up to the mark as I felt. When it goes to the next screen, while ranking, the audio file is not played automatically (you need to go back and save again). Due to this, it is not possible for me to go to evaluation 2. You may fix this in order to expedite the feedback. Scholars may add more to this.  
  

Regards,  
Prasad
