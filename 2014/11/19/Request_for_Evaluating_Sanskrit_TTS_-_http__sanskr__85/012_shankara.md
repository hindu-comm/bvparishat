Namaste,

  

All files play smoothly in my PC. I was able to complete the first phase of evaluation. I use Mozilla Firefox. VLC player is installed. One needs to give permission to VLC plug-in to play for the site.

  

There is speed variation in the words. Some words are too fast, while some others are in medium speed. This causes difficulty in understanding the sentences fully.  



regards  
shankara
