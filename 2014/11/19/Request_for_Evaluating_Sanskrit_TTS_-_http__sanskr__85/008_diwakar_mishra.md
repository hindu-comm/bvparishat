Dear Sanskrit scholars,

Namaskar.

  

The Sanskrit TTS (Samvacaka - Sanskrit Vacaka) evaluation online tool ([](http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/ttstest/index.jsp)



http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/ttstest/index.jsp) sent to you earlier has some problems with Chrome browser. If you face the problem with playing the sound files, then please use Internet Explorer or Mozilla browser. There you may be asked to enable plug-in to play the sound files.

  

Your evaluation input will help us finding the weaker points in Samvacaka and thus will help in improving the quality of synthesized voice.

  

Thank you,

  

sincerely,

Diwakar Mishra
