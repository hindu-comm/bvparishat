Some of his literary works of G.B.Palsule are Tuka Vakti, Yubhatah Samskrtam Prati, Agnija, Dhanyoham Dhanyoham, Bhasohasah. As Ushaji mentioned his commemoration volume is good source for more information and further leads  

  

With reference To Mr. Gasūns remark Dhatu Patha is not a literary work and you should know it better than me.
