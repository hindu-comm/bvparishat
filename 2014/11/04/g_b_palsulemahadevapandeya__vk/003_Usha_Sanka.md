Namaste

GB Palsule's felicitation volume "aMRta-maMdAkinI" (Ed. Prof. Saroja Bhate) has all his works listed in a detailed manner. If you could get hold of a copy, you can see them all at one place.

You can search in internet for book details, but book itself is not available for download anywhere. So library is only source.

Thankyou
