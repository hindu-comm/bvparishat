Just to clarify, Palsule's "Yubhātaḥ Saṃskṛtam Prati" is a not a literary work, but a book of historical linguistics, describing the development of Sanskrit from Indo-European (yu-bhā is a short form for yuro-bhāratīya = Indo-European). Among his other literary works are a Sanskrit drama "samānam astu vo manaḥ" and an epic poem "Vīravaināyakam" on the life of Savarkar.
