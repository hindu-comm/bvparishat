I agree with H N Bhat Ji.  
  

varNa/jAti division is of domain of shAstra-s which deal with karma-upAsanA. They are interpreted by mImAMsA. Obviously, the discussion is useful for those who have concluded that shAstra-s are pramANa or have faith in the same as being such.  

It is obvious that in different situations authors eulogise different things by using same/different words. This is destined to create confusion. We accept it. But, those who accept validity of such texts should consider whole prakaraNa, and even there we have pramANa-balAbala-vichAra.  

We should consider all these.  

I and all traditional, who have studied mImAMsA, etc., support that jAti of present birth is decided by same of parents and it depends on previous karma-s and guNa-s. This is accepted fact in tradition and is seen to be followed by masses since long.  

Now, there are others who, think that brAhmaNa etc. are just symbols of social status and traditionalist brAhmaNa-s have hacked it for their benefit and to torment others. Hence, they try to bring the same cap of jAti on their head to feel equal(!?) and hence प्रायेणैव हि मीमांसा लोके लोकायतीकृता - make dharmashAstra as low as itihAsa and stories or poems.  
  

So, the difference of both lies in accepting shAstra-s as pramANa and apramANa for dharma and brahma. I do not have any hope that any student of sAhitya, vyAkaraNa, etc. who has not studied mImAMsA, prAmANyavAda, etc. will ever be able to understand what I mean by previous sentence, i.e. to which extent the prAmANya/aprAmANya influence these talks.  
  

If someone, who claims that he has regard for shAstra-s, tries to point itihAsa, etc. in veda-s and is trying to establish that there is no jAti by birth, then he is just deluded by apparently contradicting words of shAstrakAra-s. He should strive hard to get samanvaya of all vAkya-s of shAstra-s. Otherwise, people are there to establish prAmANya of shAstra and then bring these to right conclusion slowly. This is what I stressed in my first post.
