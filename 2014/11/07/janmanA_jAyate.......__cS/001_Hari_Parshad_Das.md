\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  
my pranams. this is an interesting phrase and many people have opposing viewpoints regarding it.  
  
without taking sides, i would like to say that i found this phrase in an edition of the Skanda Purāṇa, Nāgara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 29, Verse 31. I have attached the screenshot of what i found to this reply.  
  
I would not like to discuss more about it because it is easy to get sucked into an argument and difficult to come out of it.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari pārṣada dāsa.
