नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Wherever it is stated that a Sudra becomes a Brahmana , it means Brahmanasama . The aspect of समत्वम् is discussed by Patanjali.

  

The Puranas and most of other books , that are considered as authentic
got polluted .

The commentators like Nagesa have said different things which are self contradictory .

Why so much of discussion - गर्भाष्टमेषु ब्राह्मणमुपनयीत - what does this आपस्तम्बगृह्यसूत्रम् ( all other Smrtis also)mean - a Sudra should be performed the उपनयनसम्स्कार?

  

This is what I meant by कर्मकाण्ड - this is just a sample - much more follows.

  

Today many things are happening - earlier also - दृष्टो धर्मव्यतिक्रमः ( गौतमस्मृतिः) - Parasurama killed mother .

  

Sriramanujacarya had started certain Sampradayas and today somebody may start something new , but it is not authentic .

  

Let us not take the discussion to such topics which cannot be defended in this society.

Let there be a Dharmasastra done by authentic and qualified people .

  

कलौ न क्षत्रियाः सन्ति ... only Brahmanas and Sudras in Kaliyuga.

  

जन्मना जायते शूद्रः -- then what ? One has to go ahead and decide as to what to do further - other Karmas.

  

One should study the major works with Commentaries and do समन्वय ।

  

Sudras are those who used to do पञ्चमहायज्ञाः and allowed in पङ्क्तिभोजन - शूद्राणाम् अनिरवसितानाम् (पाणिनिसू).

  

Everyone knows that in Kaliyuga morality and Dharma would slowly diminish.

People should try to emulate Rama etc and by writing such verses and fighting for superiority will not do.

In fact all people should follow the Dharmas said for Brahmanas - अहरहः सन्ध्यामुपासीत - everybody should perform this उपासना and get benefits.

  

Today we know how the people in the society run the show .

  

Let us call it day.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
