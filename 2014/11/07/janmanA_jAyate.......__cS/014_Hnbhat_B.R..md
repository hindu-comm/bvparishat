I had been observing this thread from the beginning. Though every statement in the texts or heard verses traditionally could be defended by itself, each has to be taken in the particular context and regarding the main object of the composition as a whole. They are not to be confused with other similar statements in different contexts and different domains.

  

And any hasty decision from the quotations out of the context and the domain/subject to which the text belongs, leads only to confusions, than increasing knowledge of any of the subjects and ends up in argumentative discussion only. this is my observation on seeing many such discussions in the bvp.
