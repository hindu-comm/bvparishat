Thank you very much for clarifying this point. I got the impression that you are saying that the statement by Sri Vyasa is īrṣyāsūyā-doṣa-dūṣitaḥ.

I can understand and even agree or try to sympathize with this position, but even if this argument is considered, still the fact remains that the previous major ācāryas of all sampradāyas have never spoken against the 'janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ' phrase or against its validity. In fact, Jñānendra Sarasvatī in his Tattvabodhinī commentary quotes this phrase and says that it is 'abhiyuktoktiḥ'.

There are also mentions of sarpa-brāhmaṇa in some literature as I have heard. However, i would not want to reject them as non-bonafide immediately. I would rather say that their validity/application is not known to me.

There are some examples in history which I quoted (e.g. Vālmīki etc.) where they became brāhmaṇas in that very life. There is a verse quoted in the Hari-bhakti-vilāsa in this regard,  
  

yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti  

kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ  
tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena  
dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām  
  

"Just as bell-metal transforms into gold by principles of rasa, similarly by appropriate dīkṣā brahminhood is produced in men."  
  

Now some will say that 'dvijatva' is not the same as "actually becoming a dvija" but I think such arguments are simply vāg-jāla and do not end up convincing anyone.

I had quoted a verse from the Viṣṇu-purāṇa which says that in Kali-yuga, almost everyone is born a śūdra. I find that verse very plausible. This is because there is a terrible mixture of castes and nobody maintains a genealogy which specifies that all their ancestors were pairs of brāhmaṇas. The only pramāṇa in accepting someone as brāhmaṇa by birth is their own testimony of their lineage, and that is very flimsy as a pramāṇa. I am quoting here a verse which was quoted by Sri Nageśa Bhaṭṭa in his vrātya-prāyaścitta-nirṇaya,  
  

dvāpare vyākulo dharmaḥ praṇaśyati kalau punaḥ  

varṇānāṁ dvāpare dhvaṁsaḥ saṅkīryante tathāśramāḥ  
  

He also quotes another verse,  
  

brāhmaṇāḥ kṣatriyāḥ vaiśyāḥ na śiṣyanti janādhipa  

eka-varṇas tadā loko bhaviṣyati yuga-kṣaye  
  

yuga-kṣaye here can mean "at the end of dvāpara" or "at the end of kali".  

  

The Hari-bhakti-vilāsa also says that,  
  
kṛte śruty-ukta-mārgaḥ syāt tretāyāṁ smṛti-bhāvitaḥ  
dvāpare tu purāṇoktaḥ kalāv āgama-sambhavaḥ  
aśuddhāḥ śūdrākalpā hi brāhmaṇāḥ kali-sambhavāḥ  
teṣām āgama-mārgeṇa śuddhir na śrauta-vartmanā  
  

Now I am only quoting what the smṛti-kāras of respective sampradāyas wrote in their books. I think this is not īrṣyā or asūyā but facing the inconvenient facts. Therefore, I am saying that "janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ" seems correct if seen in the context of kali-yuga and its current situation that we face now.

I do not think so. An elegant solution is possible by adopting lateral thought approaches.  
  
virodho vākyayor yatra nāprāmāṇyam tad iṣyate  
yathā 'viruddhatā ca syāt tad-arthaḥ kalpyate tayoḥ  
  
I believe that the person who started this thread (Sri Pavan Kumar) is a follower of Sri Vaishnavism. Please do not be surprised or offended when I say that even extremely conservative religious groups such as Sri Vaishnavas have now started giving upanayana to western born individuals and they are also willing to offer them courses in 'Ubhaya-vedānta'. Please see a photo attached of a person named 'Greg Jay' who is now a brahmin initiated in Sri Vaishnava tradition. His name now is Keshavacharya.  
  
Of course, to the traditionalists, it may appear a childish attempt, but who knows what plans destiny has for them. In the end, 'phalena paricīyate'.  
  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo' bhilāṣī,  
  
hari pārṣada dāsa.  
  

PS: Lalitālālitaḥ ji (I am not sure if this is your real name), i will reply separately asap to your email.
