Namaste  
  
One of our Āśrama's religious publications, originally in Hindi, has been translated into Marathi by a volunteer. The work has around 70 pages of A4 size with 20-25 lines per page. Both the original Hindi and the Marathi translation are highly Sanskritized, with many citations/portions in Sanskrit and Prakrit (Awadhi and Braja).  
  
We are looking for a proofreader with native/bilingual proficiency in Marathi and proofreading skills in Devanagari (for the Sanskrit and Prakrit portions). Command over Marathi grammar is required. Prior experience of translating/proofreading religious or literary books in Marathi would be an advantage. Basic knowledge of Sanskrit and Hindi will be helpful though not essential.  

  

Remuneration in line with market rates will be offered for the work.  
  

Those interested may please mail me off the mailing list. My email address is in the attached image.  

  

Thanks, Nityānanda Miśra  

For Śrī Tulasī Pīṭha Sevā Nyāsa, Citrakūṭa
