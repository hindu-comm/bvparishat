Dear Amba

Thanks very much for the mail. In fact I was expecting response from Chaitali, my old student whose name I saw on the mail. Any way I am happy I got a response from another old friend.

I do agree with you on all the points in your mail. I am sure if we start training both ways we will have a team of good youngscholars who can undertake the ambitious task of translating the ancient wisdomenshrined in the texts. In the meanwhile it is urgent that scientists in various disciplines and sanskritists work in collaboration on small projects.

Best wishes

Saroja
