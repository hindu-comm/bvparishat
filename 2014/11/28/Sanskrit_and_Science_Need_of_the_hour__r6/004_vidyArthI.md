Just to add onto this. This is the problem my Father/ GrandPa were facing in their lives. My Grand'Pa was not formally educated and was a Purohit/ Ganit Jyotishi but did many jobs related to Astronomy/ Jyotish. My father was a lecturer in Hindi Linguistics but had great insight in Ganitiya Jyotish/ Khagol. Whenever he tried to do something formally in Khagol/ Ganit he faced hurdles as he was not a degree holder in Sankrit or Scince/ Maths. Even then he did a research job on these subjects independently.  
  
That is why, being a technology person, I did BSc (Maths) and MSc (Comp. Sc.) and now pursuing MA (Falit Jyotish) after 1 Year Bridge course from Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan. I am planning to go into Research making use of both as a degree holder.  
  
My point is not to give my family history but to raise this concern that there should more and more non-conventional channels to produce research projects which uses our own Prachya knowledge authoritatively. I don't want to mention Science and our own knowledge in two different words, because I think Science is not something opposite to Vedic/ Eastern knowledge we have.
