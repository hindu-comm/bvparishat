Dear Madam,  

  
Yes, it is difficult to find a scholar trained in both Sanskrit and Science.  

And it is the need of the hour that science and technology students should join hands with the Sanskrit scholars. It is with this aim that in the last decade Sanskrit departments/cells at IITs and Central Universities were opened with a aim to study the 'scientific texts' in Sanskrit and show their relevance in the today's context.  
  

While it is ideal to have science students and scholars join such departments and cells, it is unfortunate that the University system is not flexible enough to even admit a non Sanskrit scholar (by that I mean a person not having a 'degree' in Sanskrit) willing to work on Scientific Sanskrit texts in such departments, unless the scholar holds a 'degree' in Sanskrit! There is a need to accommodate such scholars who are found very rarely.  
  

At the same time it is necessary to introduce the study of scientific texts in Sanskrit Institutions, and at the same time make aware the science students of the scientific knowledge in Ancient Sanskrit texts. How many students know the Kautilya's Arthashaastra, or the Combinatorics in Chandasshaastra, for example?  
  

I hope the second Sanskrit Commission takes notes of this. We need two action plans:  

a\) At school/college level students should be made aware of the Scientific achievements in the Ancient India  

b\) There should be research Institutes/Departments in the University who undertake the research showing the relevance of traditional knowledge in today's context.  

 Such departments further be given a flexibility, at least in the formative years to engage scholars from various disciplines.  
  

I remember, in the early 70s and 80s when computer science was introduced as a discipline, all the major universities and institutions admitted students from various disciplines such as Mathematics, Physics, Electronics, even though they did not have ANY background in computer science to apply for their PhD programs.  
  

I hope at least now the community wakes up and takes proper steps in this direction.  
  

With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
