Respected scholars,

I have been following your conversation for quite a time. What I feel is that this is a topic not many would love to explore so far it does not come in the fold of traditionally accepted interpretation .  
I agree fully with your comments. Scholars of science as well as Sanskrit background may work together to unearth the treasure of ancient wisdom. The problem is to convince the conservatists.  
Best regards,  
Soma Basu
