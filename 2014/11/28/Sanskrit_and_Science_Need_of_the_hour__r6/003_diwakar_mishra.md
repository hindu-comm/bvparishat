Dear Madam,

Namaste.

  

The system is so that it does not allow people to enter the field of research in Sanskrit if they do not have Sanskrit degree. But there is one opportunity for such people. JNU does not requires Sanskrit background for admission in MA. Yes, it is required there for the admission in MPhil and PhD. But the problem with admission in MA is that the people would have to qualify entrance test which requires much Sanskrit knowledge, which is a challenge for non-Sanskrit background students.

  

sincerely,

Diwakar Mishra
