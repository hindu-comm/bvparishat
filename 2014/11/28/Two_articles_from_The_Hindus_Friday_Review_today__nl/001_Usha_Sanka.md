Namaste

Good article.

It is "Paninian from Paris" who says this all. So it appears in newspapers.

Same things, when said by native scholars are not even heard. They will be heard when asked about.

*"So could we say Patanjali was an ancient Chomsky, I ask. “You could say that,” laughs Filliozat. “Patanjali was concerned with very broad linguistic issues.”*

Do not know whether to feel happy or sad at this. But good points about Samskrt and Samskrti from anyone anywhere is a welcome.

Thankyou sir, for sharing.
