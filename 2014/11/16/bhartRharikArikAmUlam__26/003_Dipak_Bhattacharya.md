Dear Colleagues,  
In VP 1.143 (Charudev Shastri 1934) *vaikharyā madhyamāyāś ca paśyantyāś caitad adbhutam/ anekatīrthabhedāyās trayyā vācaḥ paraṃ padam//*
Bhartṛhari admits a threefold division of Vāk. In the Āgamic philosophy Parā Vāk is placed above Paśyantī and is regarded as eternal speech. So also in some minor Upaniṣads. This fourfold division is a later development as evidenced by the fact that Kayyaṭa while commenting upon RV 1.164.45 does not speak of any reference to Parā while Nāgeśa does so.

The commentary ascribed to Harivṛṣabhadeva admits the turīya. K.A.S. Iyer and Charudev Shastri regard the commentator as identical with Bhartṛhari but Biardeau regards them as different. As Iyer indicates the controversy on identity is ancient. Charudev Shastri too does not see any reference to turīya in the cited verse. *Etad *according to him means 'this vyākaraṇam'. Naturally I follow Biardeau who is consistent.

Best
