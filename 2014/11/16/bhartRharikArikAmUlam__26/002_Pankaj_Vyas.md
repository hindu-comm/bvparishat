Sir  
I also think so but some people state it with hari-karikas like "tadaaha, harirapyaah" etc. But I couldn't find it in vakyapadiya. So pls help me to search its original source, from where it is taken.  
It may not be from vakyapadiya bcs Harih himself states three types of vaak in vakyakanda 144 karika  
वैखर्या मध्यमायाश्च पश्यन्त्याश्चैतदद्भुतम् ।.  
Then the famous citation abt four types of Vaak, is taken from?  
Thanks in advance
