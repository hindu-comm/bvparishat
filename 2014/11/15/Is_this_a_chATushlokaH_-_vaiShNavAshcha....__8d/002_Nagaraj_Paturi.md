This is not a सुभाषित.It is wrong on the part of the compiler of the anthology to have included there.



Quite often proverb-like folk-expressions are included in such collections.



Proverb-like folk expressions have reflections of cross-community rustic fun-makings. This one too has such अशिष्ट fun-making of a community included into a verse documenting the folk-medicinal memory.
