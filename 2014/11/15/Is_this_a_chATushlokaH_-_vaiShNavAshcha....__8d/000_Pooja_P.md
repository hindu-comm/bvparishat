Namaste,  
  
In a book of hundreds of subhāṣitam-s (subhāṣitaratnamālā);, here is a verse given under 'संकीर्णश्लोकाः’ -  
  

वैष्णवाश्चपिशाचाश्चमत्कुणाश्च पिपीलिकाः ।

भस्मदर्श्नमात्रेण पलायन्ते दिशो दश ॥

  

I would like to know if this verse is a part of any other text/work. I could not get any result for this verse on a google search.

  

Does the word 'vaiṣṇava' have any other meaning than the popular one?
Here are some other meanings, of which these three stand out as possible ones for the usage in the verse:

[TABLE]

  

The last two, given as neuter, may not fit the verse-word as they are in masculine plural.   

  

Also as per MW -

वैष्णव  
(H1B) वैष्णव\[p= 1027,3\]\[L=208015\]m. (श्री-) of a poet Cat.  
(H1B) वैष्णव\[p= 1027,3\]\[L=208017\]m. a kind of mineral L.

(H1B) वैष्णव\[p= 1027,3\]\[L=208029\]n. N. of the नक्षत्रश्रवण (presided over by विष्णु) VarBṛS.  

  

Scholars may kindly share their thoughts on this.  

  

Thanks,
