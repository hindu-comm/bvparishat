Dear scholars,

  

Can any one tell me what is the dhatu of Krishna sabda.

I found that the Vriksha Sabda originated from 'vriksha varane' and was converted to 'vrasha chedane'

  

How was that done, if it is that way.

  

Got it from Sabdakalpadruma. Also gone through Dhatupatha.

  

Pranams

Anand
