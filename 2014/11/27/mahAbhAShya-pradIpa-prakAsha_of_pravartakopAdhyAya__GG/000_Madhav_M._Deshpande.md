Dear BVP scholars,

  

  I have been reading theMahābhāṣya-Pradīpa-Prakāśa of Pravartakopādhyāya edited by M. S. Narasimhacharya and published from Pondichery in 1986. The edition explains the source manuscripts that were used for this edition, but contains no information about the author. I would appreciate if anyone knows anything about this author, his date, and if he composed any other works. Thanks.
