Dear Friend,

  

A look at the New Catalogus Catalogorum of the Madras University-under the entry of the author as well as the work-may furnish some info.

If the author is a Jain,then Jinaratnakosha of Prof.H.D.Velankar(BORI) may be helpful

The Prastavana Khanda of the Mahabhasya and Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar(GOS) by Prof.K.V.Abhyankar or any book on History of Sanskrit Grammar(which,I hope,you must have referred to) may supply some info.

  

Prof Siddharth Y.Wakankar
