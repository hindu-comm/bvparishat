I think it is time that the Government asked the German ambassador to pack his bags and leave.



Sure. Many more are there who must leave us immediately.



------ There is no need to be so aggressively emotional about this.



There are many good things about Germany's attitude towards and relations with India.



The present topic involves an institute called Goethe Institut Maxmuller Bhavan which is like many other such institutes established in India by different countries. Erstwhile Soviet Union and various market economy countries were in competition with each other in promoting their cultures in India (and other such countries). After the dismantling of the USSR , during the post cold war days, different non-USSR countries began to withdraw funds to such institutes of theirs in India (and other such countries). Maxmuller Bhavans too have been closed in some cities of India.



These institutes follow their own marketing strategies for implementing their programs for promoting their culture, language etc. Like any marketing expert they play on the target customers' attitude. British Council etc. are all getting involved in our school curriculum, performance appraisal of teachers etc.



Please have a look at this page of Goethe Institut Maxmuller Bhavan dealing with German in KVs.

Is not this 'benefitting from this opportunity, which once was just restricted to private schools' reflects the attitude of many Indian parents? To have captured this is the skill of the officers at the Goethe Institut Maxmuller Bhavan. There is nothing wrong in having and exercising that skill.

Please have a look at the following from the same page :

Are these highlightedaspects of the program attractive for the teachers and students or not?



There is nothing wrong on the part of theGoethe Institut Maxmuller Bhavan officials to have adopted such good marketing strategies. That is their job.



But what is wrong ison the part of the Government of India officials and that is in the form of messing up with the three language formula and Sanskrit teaching for this purpose. There were many other acceptable ways to provide this 'opportunity' to KV students.
