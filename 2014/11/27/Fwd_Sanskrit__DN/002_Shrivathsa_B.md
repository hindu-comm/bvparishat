hariH OM,  
  
 Very apt observations by Nagaraj Garu.  
  

 Moreover, the article also seeks to equivocate the arguments ones who were seeking justice against a move which was going against both the letter and spirit of the constitution on one hand and those who want the anti-constitutional move to stay on the other.  
  

 usage of words like "down the gullet" etc. also betrays a total lack of knowledge of the facts. Sanskrit isn't being forced down the gullets, it was German which was sought to be forced down the gullets. Not only on students, but also on the hapless Sanskrit teachers.  
  

 Also egregious is the involvement of the German ambassador in the issue. Will Germans tolerate any such nuisance in their land? I am sure they will not. I think it is time that the Government asked the German ambassador to pack his bags and leave. Please read a relevant article here:

 If employment was the criterion of selection of subjects, we should also stop teaching the students drawing, craft, moral science, regional languages, etc. An argument as simple as this seems to be too hard to grasp for the author of the telegraph article.  

  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
