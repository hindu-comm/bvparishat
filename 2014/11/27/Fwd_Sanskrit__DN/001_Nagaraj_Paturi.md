The decision to replace German with Sanskrit is not based on the argument of relative superiority of Sanskrit over German. It is based on some technical aspects of the correctness of teaching German in KVs under three language formula. So to digress the discussion into relative superiorities of the two languages in comparison to each otheris not proper.



The story cites proposals for amending Indian constitution to accommodate languages like German in the three language formula.



Such proposals betray ignorance of the history and spirit of the Section XVII of the Constitution of India, related discussions in the Constituent assembly, Articles 343, 344 etc. the discussions that lead to the formulation of those articles, Official Language Commission, various Official language Acts/ Amendments (1965, 68 etc.), the context for the formulation of Three Language Formula, the balance that was intended to be achieved through that for the purposes of national integration and all such relevant information required for understanding the present issue. It isimmature to think thatdemocracy is after all to do whatever one wants to do.Maturity helps one to realize that liberty of any individualin any groupis limited by the responsibilities arising out of the objective conditions of the group in which that individual is a member. The discussion of a three language formula running always around the three language slots two permanent ones for English and Hindi and one with a choice among only the members of the Eighth Schedule of the Indian constitution is based on such objective conditions of India's language situation and related political developments in post-independent India having implications for keeping the nation united.



There are mentions of job market etc. Let us remember that this is about school curriculum. Do the employers asking for the knowledge of a foreign language ask for the knowledge of that language at the time of employment or do they demand that the language should have been studied by the candidate right from the school level?
