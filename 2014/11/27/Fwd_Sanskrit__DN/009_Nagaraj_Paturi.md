Thanks for the link.



Apart from this, AyushmatI UshA raised a good question, why it was not

Vidwan Rajiv Srinivasan raised a similar question, why there was no hue and cry during the transition from Sanskrit to German?



All these 'burdens', 'transition time difficulties' are all made up to mislead the general public and courts.
