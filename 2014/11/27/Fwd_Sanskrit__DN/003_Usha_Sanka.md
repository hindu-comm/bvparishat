Namaste

Very rightly said, Shrivathsa and Nagaraj sir,

Will Germans tolerate any such nuisance in their land?  

No sane nation will.. except us.  

I wonder at times, who is ruling India and Indians' minds?

Do the employers asking for the knowledge of a foreign language ask for the knowledge of that language at the time of employment or do they demand that the language should have been studied by the candidate right from the school level  

Exactly. And whenever there is a mention of teaching/learning Samskrt, they start to realize suddenly the burden on school kids' curriculum.. as if nowhere else there is burden, except in Samskrt.  

I think it is time that the Government asked the German ambassador to pack his bags and leave.  

Sure. Many more are there who must leave us immediately.  

Hope Indians realized their self-pride in Samskrt and Samskrti soon.
