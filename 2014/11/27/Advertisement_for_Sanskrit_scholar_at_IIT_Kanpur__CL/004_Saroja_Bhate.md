Dear Chaitali

Nice to read ur mail. If u can give more details of the project it may be possible to find out some one.

Malhar was asking a few days back about manuscripts on science and said u are working on the project related to it. I told him that I have prepared a cat. cat of mss on science collected from about 80 printed descriptive catalogues, It is not published because we could not get funding. If u are interested u can pay a visit to pune,I can show u the work.

best wishes
