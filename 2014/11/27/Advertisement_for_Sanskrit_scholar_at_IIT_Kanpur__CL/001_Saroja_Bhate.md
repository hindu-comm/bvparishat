hi Caitali

Nice to meet you on bvp. How can u find a scholar trained in both, Sanskrit and science? It is the need of the time that science students should join hands with Sanskrit students and jointly work on projects like translation. I am working on the text of hastyayurveda with an aayurveda expert.
