Hari Om Blessed Self,

  

Advaita Vedanta, as enshrined in Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads, has been propagated through the ages and has been making an indelible mark in the world. Advaita Vedanta is now being recognized for its immense potential to influence humanity and sustainable unity in diversity/ sustainable oneness at these times.  
  
The purpose of this conference is to review the core elements of Advaita Vedanta philosophy, identify its influence on humanity, recognize various discourses in the modern context, and bridge our understanding on its implications for comprehensive sustainable unity.  
  
The leads on the various facets of Advaita Vedanta and its implications for humanity and mankind at large are available from the life-long work of Pujya Swami Chinmayanandaji, Founder of the Chinmaya Mission.  
  
Chinmaya Mission itself, as a globally respected international movement, has been studying and propagating Advaita Vedanta for over six decades.  
  
This event is being hosted by Chinmaya International Foundation (CIF) and its CIF Shodha Sansthan, Ernakulam, Kerala as a part of the centenary celebrations of Pujya Swami Chinmayanandaji to pay tribute to his influential work and draw lessons for the future.  
  
The conference will have the benefit of participation from distinguished academicians, researchers, writers, social scientists, philosophers, public policy specialists, representatives of Corporate and Civil Society Organizations and Spiritual leaders.
