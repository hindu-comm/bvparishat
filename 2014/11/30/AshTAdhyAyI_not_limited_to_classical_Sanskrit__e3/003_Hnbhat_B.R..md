In fact, if one reads carefully, the statement of Mahabhashya, it does  
not give any place for discussion. He clearly states,  
  
अथ शब्दानुशासनम्। केषां शब्दानाम्? लौकिकानां वैदिकानां च। and not  
वैदिकानां लौकिकानां च।  
  
Does this mean any thing by the change of order? Just a hunch.  
  
He did not primarily intend वैदिकानां शब्दानाम्, but लौकिकानाम्, by  
taking first the लौकिक-words, which had already other अनुशासन by other  
grammarians, and hence this monumental work points out the difference  
from लौकिक- words. And also there are प्रातिशाख्य and शिक्षा-s to  
which are dedicated to each शाखा-s. So it clears that वैदिक- words are  
also included, so as to distinguish from their counter parts in  
लौकिक-s and special forms in वैदिक are explained with specific rules.  
In other words, it includes both वैदिक-words also which are not in use  
in Classical Sanskrit, besides लौकिक-words. and not dedicated to  
वैदिक-words only.  
  
So there need not be any discussion afresh whether it is meant for  
वैदिक-words primarily or Classical Sanskrit primarily, as it simply  
covers both. But most of the cases of Vedic usages are covered by an  
extension of the rules applicable to Classical Words, with his remark  
छन्दसि बहुलम्, छन्दस्युभयथा, and certain suffixes used in primarily in  
छन्दस्, and extended to "भाषायां सदवसश्रुवः" and लिटः कानच्, क्वसुश्च,  
primarily meant for Vedic words. Such are comparatively few, but most  
cases are general.extension or relaxation or restriction of the rules  
applicable for Classical Sanskrit usages.  
  
This is my hunch, but not an verified statement or thesis.
