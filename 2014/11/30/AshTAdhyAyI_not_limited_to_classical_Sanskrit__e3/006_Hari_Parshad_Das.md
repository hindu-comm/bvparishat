\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  
my praṇāmas to all the vidvaj-janas.  
  
My two cents: Although it is true that Mahābhāṣya says — keṣāṁ śabdānāṁ? laukikānāṁ vaidikānāṁ ca.  
  
So, can all vaidika terms be explained? I doubt. We do realize that, "vyatyayo bahulam (PS 3.1.85)" is also a fact.  
  
Maybe some interpret 'vyatyayo bahulam' as Pāṇini's way of saying that "I cannot explain all formations in the Vedas".  
  
So it may be for this reason that some scholars opine that Pāṇini-vyākaraṇa is somewhat of a departure from previous styles of grammar which may have had more rules for explaining the formation of special Vedic terms.
