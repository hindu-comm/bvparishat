NamaskaarDipakji. In fact my view does not deviate much from yours apart from the emphasis I laid on the basic character of the A., that of a secular work rather than a vedaanga. which is so obvious. Any way that does not in any way underrate the importance of A. as a very important aid in understanding Vedas. By 'Bhasha" I understand the language spoken during P's time.

I am curious about your publication. Will you please send me the details?

Thanks again for your enlightenment
