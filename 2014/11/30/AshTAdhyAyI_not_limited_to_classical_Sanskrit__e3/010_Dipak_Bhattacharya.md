Dear Dr. Bhat, you have not put any silly question. Things had changed by the time of Pata;njali. The inscriptions of Asoka stand witness to that; also the apa;sabdas mentioned by Pata;njali. It was a fast time. The matter was treated by Wackernagel in AiG I Einleitung. Wrongly and Renou somewhat disagreed with him; rightly according to me. I disagree with Renou too. It is the effort to find out a standard literary dialect to be taught orally and quickly that, according to me, explains the genesis of Paa.nini's great work. The matter is too vast. If you like I might send a recent publication on Paa.nini's environment etc. But I am NOT advertising for myself.  

Best wishes with full encouragement to the grand discussion
