Why Do you put it on सिद्धान्तकौमुदी?  
  
Just consider why Mahabhashya had said लौकिकानां, वैदिकानां च? and not  
the reverse वैदिकानां लौकिकानां च, as पाणिनीयव्याकरण is considered as  
वेदाङ्ग, he could have given the answer the otherwise.?  

  
Now we can rectify that by studying all Vedic rules in

Do you mean both Vedic words could be used in the main stream of  
spoken language? लौकिक words? सिद्धान्तकौमुदी only intended that those  
who want to use Classical Sanskrit Literature, need not learn Vedic  
words and it is comparatively larger. And the need of the society,  
though Sanskrit was learnt as language by all, Vedic Text was not  
learnt by the main stream of the speakers. So for the convenience was  
provided by him, for those who want to learn लौकिक-words, which are  
the majority of the words, and neded for those who want it for  
learning Classical Literature, which was already indicated by the  
order of the answer. लौकिकानां शब्दानाम्। and for those who want to  
learn वैदिक usages also, those differentiating forms are indicated  
specifically at places, but mostly as the relaxation or retriction or  
extensions of the rules for the main stream. as बहुलं छन्दसि,  
छन्दस्युभयथा,. That was need of the day of भट्टोजि दीक्षित.  
  
Consider why he Patanjali has given reason for learning व्याकरण, among  
others, ब्राह्मणेन निष्कारणो धर्मः षडङ्गो वेदोऽध्येयो ज्ञेयः चेति  
(भा.प.)" but not for all it is necessary. and for whom the necessity  
of uses of learning Grammar in general, and Vedic words, he has given  
an example>  
  
वेदान्नो वैदिकाः, लोकाच्च लौकिकाः, किमर्थमध्येयं व्याकरणम्?  
  
Those who need to know Vedic usages, only need to learn it separately.  
and not all those who want to learn Sanskrit to read Classical  
Sanskrit. This was the convenience provided by Bhattoji.  
  
In the present day, one can learn both in the अष्टाध्यायी itself, as  
learning Veda, is not restricted to ब्राह्मण and anybody can read it  
online or offline with or without commentary. And need to learn both  
from Ashtadhyayi itsel, which is also available online, with or  
without commentary.  
  
I think this is the need for changing the order, लौकिक-s first and  
वैदिक as the second option.  
and Bhattoji picked up the hint and provided for both, in the  
प्रक्रिया method. The earlier रूपावतार, प्रक्रियाकौमुदी etc. took up  
the first set and arranged the rules accordingly which comprised only  
rules governing लौकिक-words only. Siddhantakaumudi also followed the  
same path, and extended it to वैदिक usages in the same way, divided  
into प्रकरण-s needed for Vedic usages.  
  
काशिका, न्यास, पदमञ्जरी followed the अष्टाध्यायी, which is also  
available online or offline, for those who need to learn both.  
  
So there is nothing wrong in both methods. But what matters is one  
should follow a method consistently and learn deeply. In nothern  
Gurukula-s, अष्टाध्यायी is followed while in Southern Institutions,  
सिद्धान्तकौमुदी, शब्दरत्न, शब्देन्दुशेखर are included in the  
traditional learning Grammar. Even महाभाष्य is partly included in the  
syllabus, but शेखरान्तं व्याकरणम् is the popularly known maxim I have  
heard from my teacher. The grasping of the content of अष्टाध्यायी and  
masterning is the object of learning व्याकरण either following  
अष्टाध्यायी or सिद्धान्तकौमुदी or प्रक्रियासर्वस्व.
