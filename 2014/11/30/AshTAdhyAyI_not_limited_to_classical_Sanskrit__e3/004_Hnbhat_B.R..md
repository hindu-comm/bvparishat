A further note. I too like Nagaraj, did not find any relevance of the  
discussion in the earlier thread of Sanskrit German relation. Sanskrit  
German relationship was discussed by Indo European Linguists, and lead  
to the Aryan Theory of Invasion Theory which has now outdated and new  
trend of Aryan Origin Theory replacing it gradually in its place.  
  
A comparison is that German in Germany needs not any compulsory  
inclusion of German in the syllabus meant for that country, while  
Sanskrit has to be enforced into syllabus in the educational syllubus,  
by compulsory Order of the State. That is the only difference, as each  
language has its own heritage and culture, and the people using both.  
I have no opinion of the Ordinance of the Government to make Sanskrit  
compulsory in schools, or its policy which is left to the policy  
makers.
