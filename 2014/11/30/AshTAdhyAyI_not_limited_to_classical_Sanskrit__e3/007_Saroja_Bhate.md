Ashtaadyaayee is primarily a grammar of laukika Sanskrit and it deals with Vedic Sanskrit only whenPanini comes across notable deviations from Laukika. However, since both, laukika and vaidika are "Sanskrit" Panini's rules also hold good for vaidika, except in the places where he records deviations. It must be however admitted that Ashtaadhyaayee does not explain ALL derivational features ofVadika, though traditionally it is regarded as a vedaanga

This is my observation
