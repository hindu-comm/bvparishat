So by the same token, it is not to be learnt by other people than  
ब्राह्मण



A विधि for ब्राह्मण does not mean निषेध for others.



There is a religious use of A. does not mean there is no secular use of it.



A. is a religious wok alone is as extreme a view as the view that it is a secular work alone.



लौकिकानां वैदिकानां च clearly indicates the dual use.



There is a good amount of research, including the one by Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya on who was speaking the laukika. From the evidences ofvarieties of speech used for different characters in plays and other such resources , it can safely be concluded that the use of laukika was not limited tobrAmhaNas.



लौकिक was the language of शिष्टandशिष्ट is not limited to ब्राह्मण.



Sanskrit writers who used laukika were not limited to brAmhaNas.



If A. is agreed to be वेदाङ्ग, its function is limited to be वेदाङ्ग alone.
