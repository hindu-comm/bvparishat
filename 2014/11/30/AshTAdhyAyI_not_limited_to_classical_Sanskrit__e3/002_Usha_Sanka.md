Namaste

In Mahabhashyam, when the question is put- केषां शब्दानां - The answer comes- लौकिकानां, वैदिकानां च..

So it is doubt-free that अष्टाध्यायी is for both.  

Due to Kaumudi, putting all Vedic rules as one chapter, may be both rules got separated. Now we can rectify that by studying all Vedic rules in main-stream.

Thankyou
