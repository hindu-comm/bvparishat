Again, so the purpose of enumerating the uses of learning, was aimed at ब्राह्मण-s, who became विप्रतिपन्न-s, though it is their Dharma.

  

वेदान्न्नो वैदिकाः, लोकाच्च लौकिकाः।

  

and not लौकिक-शब्द-s are learnt. which changes the earlier word order, if any thing meant, by the order लौकिकानां वैदिकानां च instead of लौकिकानां वैदिकानां च।

  

For those who want to learn the शब्द-s, it is by the लघुनोपायेन शब्दाः शक्या ज्ञातुम्।

and not as it is the धर्म for Brahmins who are reluctant to learn व्याकरण, and विप्रतिपन्नाः-s towards learning. So discussion was pointed towards the प्रयोजन-s and not whether it is religious or secular.

  

Either extreme ends would be fatal error.
