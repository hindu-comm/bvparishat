Dear Colleagues,

Judging by its own nature and use, the Aṣṭādhyāyī has utility for learning both Classical and Vedic. For Buddhists like Jayāditya or Jinendrabuddhi learning the Aṣṭādhyāyī was indeed also for knowing the language of the Vedas but not for knowing Vedic ritual application. The secular use of Pāṇini's work, thus, has been demonstrated as a historical reality.

One may state that the Niruktaśāstra, which only tried to fit the mantras to prayers applicable in rituals through *nirukti* in disregard of grammar, was not secular. Unlike Yāska Pāṇini himself has not stated such a purpose. Rather he stands in opposition to the type of *nirukti* proposed by Yāska.

So I do not find anything to disagree with Professor Bhate on the secular character of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. As far as I understand Pāṇini did secularize the contemporary Śabdaśāstra.

Best

DB
