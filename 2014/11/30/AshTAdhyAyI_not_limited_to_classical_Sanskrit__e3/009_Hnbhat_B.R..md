Thank you Prof. Dipak, for your observation which is rational view.  
  
Just a small question, why the distinction was made by the time of Patanjali?  
  
लौकिकानां वैदिकानां च? and what does the statement suggest in the  
portion beginning with अद्यत्वे त्वरिता वक्तारो भवन्ति,  
  
वेदान्नो वैदिकाः, लोकाच्च लौकिकाः?  
  
who did not find the need to learn व्याकरण separately and for those he  
is enumerating the प्रयोजन of learning Vyakarana? (Not particularly of  
Panini?). Did शाकटायन, स्फोटायन, the earlier grammarians deal with  
Vedic grammar or exclusively for वैदिक-शब्द-s? May not be the  
deviation not considerable at their times.  
  
These are silly questions, I am sure.  
  
Thanking you once again,
