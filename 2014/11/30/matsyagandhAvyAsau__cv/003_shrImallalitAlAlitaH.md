Thanks to nityAnanda and shankrara, both.  

I'll check the pointed parvan in mahAbhAratam.  

Thanks.  
  

BTW, does any body have idea whether vyAsa is manuShya or not, considering that his mother is an apsaras who was in fish form. So, we have a problem here.  

Her mother was apsaras, but was in fish form and she got seed from human.  

Any idea from scriptural point of view.  
  

This is the problem which I hope may be dealt with in dharmAkUtam.  

I request knower of dharmAkUtam to point the discussion.
