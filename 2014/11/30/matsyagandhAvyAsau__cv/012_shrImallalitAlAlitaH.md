I'm sorry for not thanking shrI rAkesha dAsa jI in time. I was travelling.  
I thank him for providing extracts with mark-ups.  
  

Prominence of seed and and words of purANa-s, etc. establish manuShyatva and dvijatva of vyAsa, etc.  

In cases tapaH of vishvAmitra etc. also creates exception. shAstra is pramANa here too.  

In cases satyavAk of tapasvI makes another person brAhmaNa, is also heard. shAstra is proof here too.  
These are accepted as exceptions, because if theses were not that there would be no need of tapaH, satyavAk, etc. - is what traditional hold.  

utsarga is that which was said in manu-smR^iti : jAtyA sa eva hi - jAti is decided by birth.  

This is what I was trying to understand.  
  

We may continue to oppose this with proof and support with the same in the thread 'जन्मना जायते शूद्रः ...'
