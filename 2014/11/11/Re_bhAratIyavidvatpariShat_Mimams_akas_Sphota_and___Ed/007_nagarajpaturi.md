1\. If varNa and varNasphoTa are one and the same , there would have been no need of a separate term varNasphoTa.



2\. According to vyAkaraNa dars'ana, sphoTaexists independent of vyAkaraNa grantha or vyAkaraNa prakriyaa (vivichya pradars'ana roopaa prakriyaa). Whereas identity /identification of varNa is a result of the vyAkaraNa prakriyaa.That portion/aspect of sphoTa which can be acconted for as related to a given varNa is the varNasphoTa related to that varNa.



3\. The word varNa is found in vAkyapadIyam. varNasphoTa is not found there.



4\. Koundabhatta while explaining varNasphoTa , agrees that just as identification ofvarNa is agrammatical necessity, identification of varNasphoTa is also a necessity arising out of that necessity and it as thejAtisphoTa alone that exists independent of grammar's process.



सत्यासत्यौ तु यौ भागौ प्रतिभावं व्यवस्थितौ

सत्यं यत्तत्र सा जाति रसत्या व्यक्तयो मताः -73



5\. Another important point is that the necessity ofrecognition of varNasphoTa is closely tied to the signification/ meaning communicating aspect of sphoTa. Prof. S D Joshiand others whoopine that themeaning communicating aspect of sphoTa was not originally in the Bhartrhari's usage of the word sphoTa can not even agree with the recognition of varNasphoTa for this reason only.



6\. VaiyAkaraNa philosophy does not accept that all the varNas of a pada are associated with meaning. Only those varNas (such as single varNa pratyayas)which are recognized by vyAkaraNaas associated with some grammatical function or meaning are considered to be associated , at least for grammatical purposes, with meaning. Kaundabhatta seems to feel the necessity of recognizing varNasphoTa to discuss sphoTa in relation tosuch varNas only.
