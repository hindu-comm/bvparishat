To being the discussion which got side-tracked to some 'VarNavaada', back to track, let me say that Dr. HN Bhat who was exemplarily open minded and accepted Sri Sivasenaniji's position that mimamsakas can not be considered to be the beginners of sphota , went a step further and tried to show that sphOTa is older than even Bhartrhari in the VaiyaakaraNa tradition and quoted Mahabhashya to show that it was already there with Patanjali itself.



Bhartrhari himself takes this position and says that he was only trying to preserve the understanding provided by Patanjali.



Patanjali's understanding need not necessarily be limited to the concept of sphOTa. It nevertheless includes sphOTa. Even vAkyapadIyam 's preservation need not be limited to the concept of sphOTa. It nevertheless includes the preservation of the ideas of sphOTa. Somehow it has become popular to call the entire philosophy of vAkyapadIyam
'sphOTa philosophy'.Researchers argue that theauthors of aarthika works of pANinIya tradition expanded the notion of sphOTa in such a way that it covers the whole philosophy of vAkyapadIyam and try to delineate the semanticcontours of theusage ofthe word sphota by Patanjali and Bhartrhari.



It may be worth debating whether it is justified to call the entire philosophy of vAkyapadIyam 'sphOTa philosophy'



Chronology of the concept of sphOTa is the focus of the present thread.
