According to my understanding there is difference between Dhvani and Sphota. Meaning of a given Sanskritshabda does not arise due to sphota but it is due to meanings of VarNas in the shabda.



Now I make a difference. Letter sound (including allophones) is VarNadhavani while a phoneme is VarNasphota.



If a shabda is pronounced in a ten different ways, it does not have ten different meanings. It has one meaning attached to its sphota. This is for only AbhidhA shakti of shabda and not forLakshaNA and VyanjanA shaktis.



Upavarsharya is the main proponents of VarNavad according to my understanding.



Thanks.N.R.Joshi

Ok. Agreed. I withdraw my statement, Sphotavada was invented by Mimamsaka's.



I have not in mind the chronology of MandanaMishra and Bhartrihari. THANK you for clarification. Both have common topics and on Sphota, and the chronological priority of both is well established, the first one could be said the inventor. Mahabhashya has the elements of स्फोट
