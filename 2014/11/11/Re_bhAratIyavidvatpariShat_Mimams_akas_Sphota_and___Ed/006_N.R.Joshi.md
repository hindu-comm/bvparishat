Respected Scholars Namaskar!



First I would like to thank Dr.N. Paturi and Dr.HNBhat for clarifying many points on shotavada and varNavada



My question to Dr.Paturi, You wrote



"phoneme is VarNasphota is not tenable. phoneme is close to varNa. VarNa and varNasphOTa are not one and the same. "



Could you explain to me please difference between VarNa and VarNashota? Thanks N.R.Joshi

Meaning of a given Sanskritshabda does not arise due to sphota but it is due to meanings of VarNas in the shabda.



------1. It would be better to qualify the statement with 'according to .........', and say, according to ....... meaning of a given Sanskritshabda does not arise due to sphota but it is due to meanings of VarNas in the shabda.



"meanings of VarNas in the shabda" is not according to vaiyaakaraNa theory or sphota dars'ana.



According to VaiyaakaraNa theory, VarNas do not have an independent meaning of themselves.It is the sequence of varNas that strikes the ear and the vaakyaarthameaning results in the hearer's buddhi immediately after the striking of the vaakyasamaapaka varNa.

वाक्यात् पदानाम् अत्यन्तं प्रविभागॊ न कश् चन // BVअक्य्\_१।७४ //



Even for vyAkaraNa purpose, where pada is recognized for vyavahAra-purpose, (since व्यवहारःपदाश्रितः), varNa is not recognized as a meaningful unit, exceptin the case of varNas which are or form part of grammatically useful divisions of a pada such as upasarga, pratyaya etc.



phone is a better term than letter sound.



phoneme is VarNasphota is not tenable. phoneme is close to varNa. VarNa and varNasphOTa are not one and the same.

sphOTa is abhinnakaala. dhvanikaala varNakaala etc. are all perceived and are attributed to parts of it due to upAdhibhEda
