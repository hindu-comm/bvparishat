Namaste,

  

 Similar to <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/shailaja/bvparishat/mxoo8-L5BTU/UABVmh_JAmMJ> I'm here to announce that after ten years of research my PhD (entitled "The Structure and System of Sanskrit Roots: History of Study") has reached it's final destination at The Institute of Linguistics, Russian Academy of Sciences (<http://iling-ran.ru/main/about_en>). The public speech and defense in Moscow will be at 13/10/14 at 14.00 Moscow time at <http://iling-ran.ru/main/news/140912_dissovet> with all the living Russian Sanskrit scholars (except St. Petersburg).

 PhD theses (in Russian): <http://iling-ran.ru/avtoreferats/gasuns.pdf>

 PhD full text (with supplements) <http://iling-ran.ru/theses/gasuns.pdf> (page 226 and after are supplements where no knowledge of Russian language is required, the main supplement being the Concordance, based on Palsule at page 240).

  

Let the force be with you,

Marcis from Moscow
