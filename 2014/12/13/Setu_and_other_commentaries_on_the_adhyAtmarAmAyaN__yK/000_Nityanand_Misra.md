Namaste  
  
I am looking for a digital or print copy of the commentary Setu on the Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam by King Rāmavarmā of Śṛṅgaverapura (Believed to be actually authored by Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa).  
  
A publication from Calcutta by Harimohan Mukhopadhyaya of the commentary is available on DLI (barcode number 99999990293353) but the scan quality is bad and the text is illegible.  
  

The Hindi book Bhrāntigiribhaṅga by Acārya Siyārāmadāsa Naiyāyika refers an edition of the Setu by Shri Venkateshwar Press published in VS 1961 (1904 or 1905 CE). Seems it is out of print as website of the publisher (<http://www.khe-shri.com>) does not list this work.  
  

I would be grateful if a member of the list can point me to a god quality digital copy of the work.  

  
Information on digital copies of other Sanskrit commentaries is also welcome. So far I could only find the Vyaṅgyaprakāśikā of His Highness Mahārāja Viśvanātha Siṁha Deva of Rewa (DLI barcode 5990010098197). Three Hindi commentaries (by Munilal, Pandita Umadatta Tripathi, and Pandita Vaijanatha) are also available on DLI.  
  
Page 18 of the Vyaṅgyaprakāśikā edition (cited above) lists seven more Sanskrit commentators on the Adhyātmarāmāyaṇam:  
  
Āyojibhaṭṭa  
Kṛṣṇanātha  
Balabhadra  
Mahīdhara  
Yatīśa  
Narottama  
Gopālacakravartī  
  

Any information on the above would be helpful.
