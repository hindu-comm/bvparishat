I found a book with three commentaries by Narottama, Gopālacakravartī, and Rāmavarmā. It is a 1935 edition published by Metropolitan Printing and Publishing House Ltd, Calcutta and critically edited by Nagendranatha Siddhantaratna (DLI barcode 5990010098043).  
  
Unfortunately the book is incomplete and the pages are present only till Kiṣkindhākāṇḍam.  
  
If somebody comes across the complete version of the book (or its second volume) on DLI or archive, please let me know.  
  
Thanks, Nityānanda
