In the book Apastamba :Dharma and Grihya Sutras Translated by various scholars Edited by Rama Ramanuja Achari Srimatham.com, under the title



Who was Apastamba ?



it is said :



Who this author really was, is a problem which cannot be solved for the present, and which probably will always remain unsolved, because we know his family name only. For the the name Āpastamba, just like those of most founders of Vedic schools, e.g. Bhāradvāja, Āsvalāyana, Gautama, is a patronymic name.



Kane assigns Apastamba's Dharmasūtra an approximate date between 450-350 BC
