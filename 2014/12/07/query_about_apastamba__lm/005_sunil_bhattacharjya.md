Namste,  
  
Apastambha was one of the four founders of the four major sects of Shaivism and he is considered to be the first guru of the the Kapalika sect meant for the shudras or according to some he is the first guru of the another sect meant for the vaishyas. He should be contemporary of Bharadvaja, who was the first guru of one of the four sects of Shaivism. He should be of the time of the Mahabharata as we know that Lord Krishna was initiated into the Pasupata stream by his guru Sandipani. There is another sub-sect fo pasupata, called Mahapasupata, which considers Shiva and Vishnu are same or equal and the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita also considers the same equality for both. All these go to show that Apastambha should have been living not later than 5,000 years ago.
