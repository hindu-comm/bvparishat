Dear Sirs,

  

Sage Apastamba is so called because he stopped (root *stabh*) the waters (*ApaH*) midway. 

He was cursed by a brahmin in the course of a *s'rAddha.* That was because he sought more and more food even after everything had been served him. The pronouncement of the curse was accompanied by the sprinkling of the water, which was what was stopped by him.

  

The story occurs in *Brahma Purana*.

Am not able to access the source right now, hence cannot supply the exact reference.
