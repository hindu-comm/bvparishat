Dear list members,  
  
Sharing a high resolution photograph, taken just after noon (so that the the shade of the rod does not fall on the inscription), of the Sanskrit inscription on the Nāḍīvalayayantra at Jantar Mantar, Jaipur. This was taken on December 11 2014 by me.  
  

Verses 1, 7: Śārdūlavikrīḍita  
Verses 2, 5: Indravajrā  
Verses: 3, 4, 6: Upajāti  
  

The photo may be freely reused without any permission by anybody.  

  
Thanks, Nityānanda
