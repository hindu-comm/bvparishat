The possibility that svargam is a neuter nominative has been suggested by several people. On another list, Professor Cardona suggested that prāpyate in ācārāt prāpyate svargam could be read as a passive for the causative prāpayati. That would then account for the accusative form svargam. What we need is a critical edition of the Dakṣasmṛti that will provide alternative readings from the manuscripts. In any case, thanks to all those who have proposed solutions and provided suggestions.
