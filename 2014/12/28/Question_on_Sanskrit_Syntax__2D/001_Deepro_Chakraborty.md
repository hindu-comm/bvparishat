Monier-Milliams suggests that the word 'svarga' can also be usued as an adjective. So, it may have forms in all the three genders. We see adjectives are used as a noun, but in that case it is used in neuter gender. For example, the word 'Subha' is an adjective. But we also find 'subha' as noun in neuter gender.  
This is just a prediction. There can be other suggestions.
