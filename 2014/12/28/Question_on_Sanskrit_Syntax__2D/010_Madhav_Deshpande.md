Thank you Professor Korada. This is the same explanation that was proposed by Professor Cardona. Dr. H. N. Bhat's observation that the line "आचारात् प्राप्यते स्वर्ग:" is found in the Nāradasmṛti indicates that in the floating verses of the Dharma literature, आचारात् प्राप्यते स्वर्ग:/स्वर्गम् is a matter of variation. I doubt that it is an intentional variation. It is most likely due to oral/scribal variation. However, given the reading svargam, the interpretation of prāpyate as antarbhāvitaṇyartha is probably the best explanation.
Thanks once again.
