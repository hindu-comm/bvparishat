One wild guess:



In Telugu, the Sanskrit word svargah turns into its Teluguised tatsama formsvargam(u) in its prathamaa form itself.



The verse, from wherever it could be, could have been composed by a Telugu speaker and this could be a'mistake' occuringdue to mother tongue interference.



Prof. Deshpande, did you check in the Daksha Smriti text for this verse?
