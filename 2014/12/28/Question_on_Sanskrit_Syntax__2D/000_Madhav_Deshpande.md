In a Sanskrit work titled Nityācāradarpaṇa by Brahmānanda, on p. 2, I see a quotation from Dakṣasmṛti:  
  
आचाराल्लभते पूजामाचाराल्लभते प्रजा: ।  
आचारात्प्राप्यते स्वर्गमाचारात्प्राप्यते सुखम् ।।  
  
Here, ācārāt prāpyate svargam is an irregular usage, unless one assumes that the word svarga is somehow used in neuter gender. With the normal masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb. In Marathi, such passive constructions are possible: रामाने (instrumental) रावणाला (accusative) मारिले (passive verb). This usage alternates with a more Sanskrit like passive: रामाने रावण (nom) मारिला/मारला (nom). I am wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bhāve) constructions where the object shows up in the accusative case. Any information or suggestions are appreciated.
