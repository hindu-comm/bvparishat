उत्थित आकांक्षा sometimes also termed as नियताकाङ्क्षा and उत्थाप्य आकांक्षा is termed as अनियताकाङ्क्षा.  
They are defined as follows (न्यायकोश):  
  
नियताकाङ्क्षा यथा क्रियाकारकपदानां परस्पराकाङ्क्षा। यथा वा पुत्रादिपदानां पित्रादिरूपप्रतियोगिवाचकपदाकाङ्क्षा नियता (रामरुद्री १ पृ० २)। नियतत्वं च अत्र अवश्यंभावित्वम्। अत्र च पुत्र इत्युक्ते कस्य इत्याकाङ्क्षोदयात् देवदत्तस्य इत्याद्यपेक्षत इति देवदत्तस्येति षष्ठ्यन्तपदपुत्रपदयोर्नियताकाङ्क्षेति ज्ञेयम्।  
अनियताकाङ्क्षा (रामरुद्री पृ० २)। यथा उदयति चन्द्रः कुमुदबान्धव इत्यादौ चन्द्रपदकुमुदबान्धवपदयोरनियताकाङ्क्षा।  
Literally आकांक्षा is the desire on the part of a listener to know other words in a sentence for complete understanding.  
Now if आकांक्षा is the curiosity on the part of a listener then  
after listening to a verbal form such as आनयति ‘brings’, a listener  
will have a curiosity to know who brings, what s/he brings, how  
s/he brings, and so on. Further if the object of bring is, say, a cow.  
the listener may have further curiosities to know what the color of  
the cow is, what the purpose of bringing her is, and so on. There  
is no end to such curiosities. These curiosities are more of a psychological nature than a syntactic one.  
  
The Naiyayikas made a clear distinction between psychological  
and syntactic expectancy. For them, आकांक्षा  
is the syntactic expectancy a word has in order to correlate with  
another. For example, in a word dvaaram ‘to the door’, the stem  
dvaara ‘door’ denotes an object in the real world, and the am suffix  
(an accusative marker) marks an expectancy of a verb whose karman (object)  
can be dvaara ‘door’. This expectancy which arises  
from the knowledge of suffix is a syntactic one, and it allows one  
to connect the word dvaaram with pidhehi ‘close’. This expectancy  
is not one way, but mutual. It is also not psychological. It is based  
on the usages of the verbs in a sentence and is thus syntactic in  
nature. As an another illustration, consider two verbs gaml and  
vaa . The verb gaml is used in the sense of motion (gaml gatau)  
The verb vaa is used in two meanings, viz., gati ‘motion’  
and gandhana ‘pointing out’ (SK. 1050). Though both gaml and vaa are  
used in the sense of motion, gaml is sakarmaka (transitive) while  
vaa is akarmaka (intransitive). This requirement of a karman for gaml is  
not psychological but is based on the usage of the verb.  
  
The expectancies which are mutual, direct and natural are termed niyata or utthita आकांक्षा (restricted or risen expectancy)  
(Kunjunni Raja 1963). The expectancy between a verb and the words denoting  
kaarakas or between relational words falls under this category.  
In contrast to mutual expectancy, the expectancy that is unilateral is called aniyata or utthaapya आकांक्षा (unrestricted or to be  
raised). This is aroused only if necessary. So it is potential. For  
example, in a phrase such as white cow, the आकांक्षा of white for  
a substantive is natural, but the आकांक्षा of cow to have an adjective is potential.  
It gets aroused in the presence of an adjective such as white. Even a noun in apposition may arouse an  
expectancy. The example discussed in the Raamarudrii commentary  
on the Dinakarii commentary on the Nyaayasiddhaantamuktaavaliı is  
udayati candrah. kumudabaandhavah. ‘Rises the moon,  
the friend of a lotus (that opens its petals during night and closes  
them in the morning)’. After hearing udayati candrah. ‘the moon  
rises’ all the expectancies are fulfilled. And thus understanding is  
complete. Now when one hears kumudabaandhavah. ‘friend of a lo-  
tus’ then this word needs to be related to one of the words uttered  
earlier because there can not be freely hanging words in a meaningful sentence.  
This word has an expectancy of a substantive, and  
thus it gets related to candrah. . Both these cases are examples of  
unilateral expectancy.

The word dislocation is a technical term, used in the constituency grammar. If a child of a node in the parse tree moves from its normal position to some other it is said to be dislocated. Prof. Brendon Gillon in his paper on Word Order in Sanskrit has given several examples of dislocation in Sanskrit (in the framework on constituency grammar). For further details on dislocation, you may refer to his paper.
