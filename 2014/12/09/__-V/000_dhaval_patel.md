Respected list members,  

While trying to create a machine replication of verb derivation process I stumbled upon the following issue. (<https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/issues/74>)  

If any of you can clarify, it will be quite useful to me.  
  

For the sake of clarity, let me note down the issue.  
  

When deriving ध॑नँ॑ - धान्ये, जुहोत्यादि 03.0024  

धनँ + तस्‌ the machine gives,

1 - दधन्+तस्  
अनुनासिकस्य क्विझलोः क्ङिति (६.४.१५) :  
1 - दधान्+तस्

**Question -  
** **What prevents application of anunAsikasya kvijhaloH kGiti ?**

This presumes that the expected form is दधन्तः (and दधान्तः is incorrect)
