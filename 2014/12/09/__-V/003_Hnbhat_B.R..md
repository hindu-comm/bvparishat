As have already explained, तस् is तिङ्प्रत्यय, and hence it is excluded. Only झलादि suffixes other than तिङ् suffixes are covered by this rule, as the first is a कृत् suffix, this also applies to कृत् suffixes which are झलादि and कित्.

  

This was the explanation given under चक्षंसे to get the form in the commentary Balamanorama and in notes. Now this तस् though ङित्, and झलादि, the rule does not apply. It applies to कृत् suffixes only.
