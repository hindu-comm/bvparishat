Dear Prof Amba Kulkarni,



Thank you very much. You have taken a lot of trouble for me . I really enjoyed examples you have given..I knew Aakaanks'aa but did not know their different varieties.



In your earlier email there was a word "gandhana-pointing out". I did not understand it. Please pardon me if I were wrong in raising this question to you.



You are leading researcher in Computational Sanskrit.We will appreciate if you keep informed us from time to time (whenever you get time) about how are the variousfeatures of Sanskrit are being used in promoting research in Computational Sanskrit. Thanks. again, yours sincerely N.R.Joshi
