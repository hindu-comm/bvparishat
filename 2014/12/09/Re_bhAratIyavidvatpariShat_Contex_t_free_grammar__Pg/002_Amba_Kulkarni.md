Thank you Prof. Bhat for the explanation.  
  

It was not at all an interference, but a friendly helping hand.  

  
Sri Joshi ji,  

  
I hope the point is clear now.  

Regarding the developments in Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, we normally publish our conference proceedings during the conferences. In 2013 we had a seminar at Paris, and its proceedings will be published soon. The passage I sent you on aakkankshaa is from my article on the 'free word order' from this volume.  
  

We are all also actively participating in the forthcoming WSC at Thailand in the section 'Sanskrit and the IT World'.  

Looking forward to see you in Bangkok.  

  

With regards,  
Amba
