Why don't you accept polysemy in words? If you accept, you should not have such a doubt.

  

गन्धो गन्धक आमोदे लेशे संबन्धगर्वयोः। इति विश्वप्रकाशः(धद्विक .8a-b).  

"गन्धः प्रतिवेश्यामोदसंबन्धगन्धके। इति मेदिनी(धान्त द्विक, ५ P.79.।  

  

Here among the above, आमोद means fragrance. The meaning depends on the context. Please give the context of the last one: शब्दगन्ध- and not alone. Any of the above meanings or the those dictionaries give, will suit the context, if you give the context.

  

The root is simple1685 गन्ध अर्दने।

  

गन्ध¦ अर्द्दने (हिंसायाम्) गत्यां भूषणे च चुरा० आ० सक० सेट् ।  

  

The above are the additional meanings.

  

पु० गन्ध--पचाद्यच् । व्राणेन्द्रियग्राह्ये पृथिवीवृत्तौ

विशेषगुणभेदे अमरः ।
