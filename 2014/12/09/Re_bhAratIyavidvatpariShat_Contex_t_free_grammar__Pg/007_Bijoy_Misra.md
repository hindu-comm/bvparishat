From my readings of the cosmological literature like साङ्ख्य, I have observed that गन्ध as  

olfactory sensing carries the signature of the object in material form.
Unlike other sensing  

like शब्द, रूप, रस, and स्पर्श, गन्ध is deterministic in objects. This sense of determinism does  

carry into the word formation and use in literature as I see.  

As Dr Bhat observed a word in literature needs interpretation in context.  

I would request the scholars to interpret the word गन्धिनी in human context.  

(Valmiki uses, but I can't give an immediate reference.)
