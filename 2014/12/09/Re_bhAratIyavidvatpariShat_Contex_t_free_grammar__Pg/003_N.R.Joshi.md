Many thanks to both scholars- Dr. Amba Kulkarni and Dr. H.N. Bhat.



It was in my mind from a long time to ask question on Gandhanaand was waiting for opportunity. I got it now and understood its meaning due to kindness of Dr. Bhat.



But then what about meaning of Gandha as in Sugandha-- fragrance. Is any connection between the two--- Sugandha and Shabdagandha? N.R.Joshi.
