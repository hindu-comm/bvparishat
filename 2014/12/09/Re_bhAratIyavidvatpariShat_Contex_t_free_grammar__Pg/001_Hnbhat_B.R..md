The verb vaa is used in two meanings, viz., gati ‘motion’

and gandhana ‘pointing out’ (SK. 1050).

  

गतिगन्धनयोः. Attributes of the Item. dhAtu \[ धातु \] · adAdi \[ अदादि\] (२. ४५)

  

It simply means, the वा is used in two meanings, i.e. गति = motion, and गन्धन = pointing out.

  

. -3 Informing against, betraying, ..  

  

Not only simply pointing out. But it has got some other shades also.

  

गन्धनम् = अपकारप्रयुक्तं हिंसात्मकं सूचनम्।  

  

Both सूचन and गन्धन have specific usages.

  

"कर्णेजपः = सूचकः"

"कर्णेजपः सूचकः स्यादनौचित्यप्रबोधके।"

  

This is the meaning of गन्धन, as सूचन.

  

गन्धयति =

सूचयतीति। परदोषमाविषकरोतीत्यर्थः।  

  

Find fault with is the correct meaning of both.
