 सुरभिगन्धिन्

  

(H3) सु-रभि--गन्° धिन् \[p= 1235,2\] \[L=249638\] mfn. sweet-smelling, fragrant MBh. Kāv. &c

(H3) सु-रभि--गन्धिन् \[p= 1235,2\] \[L=249640\] » °धि.

  

Exactly. The word is adjective for बिन्दवः, and so it is in plural. It is a compound word, but irregular in form in terms of Panini's grammar. The tears having seet-smelling. would be the literal meaning and no other concept.

  

2।068।017 अधस्ताद् व्रजतस् तस्याः सुरराज्ञो महात्मनः

2।068।017 बिन्दवः पतिता गात्रे सूक्ष्माः सुरभिगन्धिनः॥

  

  

  

No need to check any more. It simply means having smell.

  

सुरभिगन्धिन: = शोभनगन्धविशिष्टा: सूक्ष्मा: बिन्दवः = अश्रुबिन्दुकणिका: पतिtताः।  

  

The tear drops having sweet smell, (sweet smelling),

  

Normally it should have been a बहुव्रीहि compound, with सुरभि- which should be declined as

  

सुरभिगन्धिः - सुरभिगन्धी - सुरभिगन्धयः।

  

Here as an exceptional case, it declined as सुरभिगन्धिन् - in plural सुरभिगन्धिनः as adjective of बिन्दवः। The basis for this, tears having fragrance, is that because of गोरोचना a fragrant substance in high class cows, makes their breath fragrant and so there is no wonder कामधेनु has the fragrance all over her body and not only in the breath, even the tear shed was frant.

  

The episode of shedding tears by Kamadhenu, is beautifully embeded in a verse by Bhoja used to compare the sorrow of Kausalya, with that of Kamadhenu:

unbearable for her.

  

The parallel sentence in Valmikiramayana is

2।068।024 किं पुनर्या विना रामं कौसल्या वर्तयिष्यति\|
