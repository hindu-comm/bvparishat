As you have already said, it is not possible to explain it out of context. Please give the exact reference in Valmiki Ramayana or at least the Kanda.

  

I searched 1-7 kanda-s in the of Valmiki Ramayana: for the sord*gandhiniī* **but could not find any instance. in the etext in gretil sanskrit.**



Please mention the Edition, page, Kanda, Adhyaya, Verse etc.
