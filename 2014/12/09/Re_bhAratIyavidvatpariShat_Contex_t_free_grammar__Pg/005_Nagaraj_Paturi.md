But then what about meaning of Gandha as in Sugandha-- fragrance. Is any connection between the two--- Sugandha and Shabdagandha?



----Gandhana comes from a verb root gandh.



Gandha is a noun. S'abdgandha is a poetic/figurative usage used in an aesthetic sense. If you found any usage of S'abdagandha in a non-aesthetic context, that would be an interesting information.



Sugandha, durgandha are good and bad smells in generalwhereas s'abdagandha is an aesthetic feel of a word described with the analogy of different flavours of fragrances.
