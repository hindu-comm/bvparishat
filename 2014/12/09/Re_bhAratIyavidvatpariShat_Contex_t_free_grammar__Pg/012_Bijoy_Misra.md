I found one occurrence where the "signature" concept would be used.
It's not exactly गन्धिनी, but similar.  
  

Valmiki Kanda II, Ch LXXIV stanza 17  
अधस्तात् व्रजतस्तस्याः सुरराज्ञो महात्मनः।  
बिन्दवः पतिता गात्रे सूक्ष्मा सुरभिगन्धिनः।  
  
सुरभि the celestial cow. She is crying for her sons on the earth. The stanza refers to her tears.  
You can check there for further context.  
  
सुरभिगन्धिनः is one word.  
  

I will look others in similar style.
