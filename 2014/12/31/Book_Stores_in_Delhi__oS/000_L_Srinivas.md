Dear Friends,

  

Can someone tell me of a couple book stores in south Delhi area where one can get kavya, vyakarana books? I have a contact in Kalkaji who can unfortunately not go to Shakti Nagar or Nai Sarak. I need names of Sanskrit book stores in Kalkaji, Lajpat Nagar, Munirka, Sarojini Nagar, Lodhi Road etc. Karol Bagh is also fine as my contact goes there to work.

  

I also need NCERT schoolbooks on Sanskrit (from Grade VI to Grade XII). Where can one get these?

  

Thanks in advance for your valuable advice,

  

Srinivas
