Dear friends,  
  

I have seen the Gita Jayanti being celebrated on the Mokshada Ekadashi day since the late first half of the last century. Is there any reference to show that Dhritarastra asked Sanjaya on this Ekadashi day to tell him about what all happened in the war till that day? Or is there any reference from the past to show this day being celebrated in the Ekadashi day ?  
  

Regards,
