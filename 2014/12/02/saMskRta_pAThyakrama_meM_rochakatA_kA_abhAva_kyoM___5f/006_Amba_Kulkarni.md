I think there are two important steps necessary.  
  

a\) To make the students aware of the established and accepted
Scientific contribution of Ancient India. Here we should refer to the scientific texts such as those of आर्यभट्ट, भास्कराचार्य, चरक, सुश्रुत, पाणिनी, पतञ्जलि, भर्तृहरि, to name a few. Already a lot of research has gone into these branches, and a lot of material which can be explained and digested by the young students is available. What is necessary is to make it easily accessible to the students, for example, through their regular textbooks.  
  

b\) The other step is to show the relevance of these शास्त्रs in the current context, may be leading to the job opportunities. This will then boost their studies. This is not an easy task. In the current context, given that a lot of research has gone into the three disciplines viz. Vyaakara.na, Ayurveda and Mathematics, it is comparatively easier to bridge the gap.  
  

The other things such as the scientific descriptions in the Mahabharata or Ramayana, or the references to Vimaana Shaastra are a bit speculative. And one needs to take up proper studies, carry out lab experiments to establish the facts and so on.  
  

So we should separate out the speculative things from the well established and accepted facts.  
  

The second Sanskrit Commission may take some appropriate steps.
