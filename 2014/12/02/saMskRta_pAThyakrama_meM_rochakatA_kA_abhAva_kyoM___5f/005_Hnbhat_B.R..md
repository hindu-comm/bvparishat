Again, like the discussion on another thread, the whole of Laukika and Vaidika, could not be explained in terms of Science or could be claimed as represntatives of Indian Heritage of Science. As I have seen from several discussions, in this group, many try to make several words look like Scientific description, in Mahabharata, or Ramayana. But their nature and legacy as इतिहास and काव्य is wellknown and as well as our classical and Vedic literature as the representatives of cultural heritage. Casual references like उपराग, etc. are taken up for the context and not as the introduction of elipses. They could be called Indian Contribution to Science or precisely Astronomy.

  

They are really science works like सूर्यसिद्धान्त, बृहत्संहिता which have their own realm of Astronomy and Astrology as a bye product or independently as लीलावती deals with mathematics, which is well known. Research can be concentrated on revealing the contributions of these to the present day Science will be relevant, for which both who have learnt deeply these works and deep knowledge of present day Astronomy as a science should be co-operated each others. It may be find such perfection in both Sanskrit and Astronomy or any other branch of Science, to verify them in the Lab as part of the project, may be rare combination, without which such a project may end up like the earlier attempts.

  

I think some Pandit in Maharashtra or so, I do not remember, flew an aircraft on the basis of विमानशास्त्र, in some web page, but could not become popular. In spite of such literature on Science Literature, none other than had the practical use in every day life, like the Astronomy used in Astrology, the need of the day and sill continues to be so. I am not assessing modern astrologers. Many articles and compilations on Scientific Literature, compiled the titles in Astronomy and Mathematics. Any other works on Physics and Chemistry, are to be explored and subjected to study in Labs and their contribution to present day Society should be made clear, before venturing of such an project, beyond simply ascertain they are real Science Works produced in India. Ayrveda, is popular Indian Medical Science, which combines several methods. But not many Ayurvedic physicians are not experts in taking the advantages to the public, but content with stethoschope and with their knowledge. Such I don't think, the fate of the Project. Results of the Project should reach the public, and which has to be kept in mind while planning the Project.

  

This is my view, as I am not a Scientist, but a citizen of India without knowledge of Sanskrit or Science.
