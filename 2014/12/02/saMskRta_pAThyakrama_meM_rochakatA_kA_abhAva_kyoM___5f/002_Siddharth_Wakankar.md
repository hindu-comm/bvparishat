Shri Diwakarji has rightly pointed out that either many syllabus-makers do not know these scientific facts or they do not wish to share that knowledge.

I feel they do not want to get away from the standard format,because,that requires additional reading.

The same thing has happened to the Manuscript-studies.When we can prescribe the printed texts for years together by effecting minor changes,why should we bother about the study of unpublished manuscripts-which requires perseverance and utmost care. It is said-of course,with an under current of concern and complaint- by knowledgeable scholars that most of the Teachers working in the Sanskrit Depts-barring some worthy exceptions-hardly bother to try their hands at manuscripts,which are a little bit difficult to decipher,needing special efforts.

Unless and until Sanskrit scholars change their mind-set,there is no bright future for Sanskrit,because,its utility is challenged in the modern age.Unless we are able to vouch for its relevance,it will be very difficult to resurrect it.

Best luck.
