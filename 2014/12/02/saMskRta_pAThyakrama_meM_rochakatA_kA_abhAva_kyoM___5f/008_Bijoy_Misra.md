Dear friends,  

A couple of months ago I had initiated a discussion on undergraduate teaching of Sanskrit abroad.  

But it has implications of curriculum reforms in India as expressed in this discussion. Besides making  

the curriculum content-rich it should be also analysis-oriented to capture the attention of young minds.  

Documenting what's known is one area, extending into the fields of science and technology is another  
area. Fields of phonetics, philology, grammar, prosody and literature need scientific studies. Documents  
analyzing the results may still exist in old literature and they have to be discovered. Hope many  

scholars would join and express their views.  

Best regards,
