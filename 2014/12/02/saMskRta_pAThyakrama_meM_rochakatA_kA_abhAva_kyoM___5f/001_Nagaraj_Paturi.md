What a touching way of expressing the agony of a person who underwent our present Sanskrit curriculum!



It was simply poetry all through, including the refrain "यह मुझे किसी कक्षा के संस्कृत के पाठ्यक्रम में पढ़ने को क्यों नहीं मिला " and its rhythmic patterning into the poetic prose.



But it should also be remembered that our present Sanskrit curriculum is a continuation of the early modern /pre-independent/ British time curriculum when Sanskrit courses were looked at as language and literature courses such as that of English. Does any English language and literature course have as part of its curriculum science books written in English?



But that is past. We could have redesigned our Sanskrit curricula in such a way that it is nottreated just as a language and literature course but as a course on all the ideas and thinking methodologies available through the medium of that language.



Amazing pieces of information as cited by Vidwan Diwakarji should not only be limited to the Sanskrit courses but should also have been incorporated into the respective courses of modern subjects right from the school stage.
