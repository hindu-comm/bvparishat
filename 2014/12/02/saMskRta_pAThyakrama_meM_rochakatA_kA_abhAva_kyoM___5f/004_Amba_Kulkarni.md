Our text books (in Maharashtra, in early 70s) used to have small writeup at the end of each chapter of mathematics(and science as well, though I am not pretty sure) books where the relevant work in Indian mathematics/ Science would be presented in a nutshell. This is how we were introduced to the Rich Scientific Heritage of India. These were just 'samskaara-maatra'. But this definitely made us proud.  
  

Of course, since these were only as appendices, teachers never bothered to 'teach' us that part, nor was it meant for examination. So many students did not even bother to read them.  
  
Nevertheless it was a good effort.  

  

I remember we were introduced to Aryabhatta and Bhaskaracharya in our school days through these appendices. But no Panini, nor Ayurveda.  

  

Samskrit Bharati has come up with a good book 'Heritage of India' I think. It is a good book with all authentic references for a serious scholar.
