1\. When 'sciences' in Mahabharata and other such AitihAsic and purANic literature is discussed, usually what comes to mind is the tendency of claims by people about the technology of s'astras, astras, vimAnAs etc. and that is the reason why people make suggestions of caution and recommend laboratory experiments for verification.



2.There area fewcautions required during such discussion:



 1.We have to remind ourselves the difference between science and technology. Descriptions ofa certain technology need not

 construed as 'science' and claims of 'science' need not be made on the basis of such technology-descriptions. Such

 descriptions could be poeticimaginations, futuristic imaginations or might reflect some lost technologies. But nevertheless,

 none of that is'science' by itself.



 2. But when it is said that s'Astra material is contained in books such as Mahabharata or different purANas and purANic

 it need not necessarily be physics , chemistries, botanies, zoologies etc. all the time. It could be content that could deserve to

 get classified under different social sciences such as political science, public administration, strategic studies, diplomatic

 studies, sociology, anthropology etc. Some of these are dealt directly rAjadharmOpadEs'as etc. some are exemplified

 through narrative form.



  3. Some purANas like agnipurANa directly contain sections on art,sculpture, music, dance, architecture etc.



 4. At some other places , philosophical essence of theories of physics etc. can be seen. For example,



 नासतो विद्यते भावः नाभावो विद्यते सतः



 is the essence of all conservation theories. But is found in the gItA which is part of Mahabharata.



3\. So in stead of brushingaside all the claims of scientific understanding inbooks such as Mahabharata as speculative, it is better to make a proper classification of such claims and give each its due place.
