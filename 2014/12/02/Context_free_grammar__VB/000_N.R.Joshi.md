\>\>\>Paninian or Classical Sanskrit (as contrasted with Vedic Sanskrit)



In the above article of Rajeeva Shrinivasan, it is said that the machine computer does not have context. It needs context free grammar. Grammar of Panini is such a grammar. Could you please explain this by giving Sanskrit sentences according to Panini grammar and English sentences and show to us difference.It is said that Sanskrit is free of word order (contrasting to English). Forgetting English for a minute, is Sanskrit free of word order in all situations or there are some exceptional cases where word order is even in Sanskrit is important. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
