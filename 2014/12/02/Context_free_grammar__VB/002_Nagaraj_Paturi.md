The word context-free grammar has nothing to do with word order issue.



Context-free grammar is a kind of formal grammar. The word context-free grammar refers to the methodology of the grammar, the procedure of its operation on the language it deals with, the mathematical nature of its operation .



Please look at the siddhi of any word in ashTAdhyAyI and compare it with the derivation trees in Chomsky. Grammars which can work that way are called context-free grammars.



Word order in Sanskrit has been one of thewell discussed topics during modern discussions on Sanskrit Syntax.



Please read for example,
