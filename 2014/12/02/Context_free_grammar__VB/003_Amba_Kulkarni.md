Dear Sri Joshi,  
  

You have mentioned two terms: a) Context Free Grammar and b) Free Word Order.  
  

Let me explain each of these. First the Context Free Grammar.  

The term Context Free Grammar is used in the Formal Language Theory which studies the syntactic regularities of a grammar.  

Noam Chomsky has described the containment hierarchy of these formal grammars. His hierarchy contains 4 levels.  

a\) Type 0 or unrestricted grammars  

b\) Type 1 or Context Sensitive grammars  

c\) Type 2 or Context Free grammars  

d\) Type 3 or Regular grammars  
  

From computational complexity point of view, Type 3 is the simplest grammar, and the complexity increases as we go upwards.  

These formal grammars are written as rewrite rules.  
  

It had been pointed out by Ingermann that Panini's suutras are similar to the Backus Naur Form used to describe these rewrite rules, and hence he also suggested that the Backus Naur Form may be called as Panini Backus Form.  
  

In the article  
Bhate, S. and Kak, S.: Panini's grammar and Computer Science. Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute vol. 72, 1993,  
79--94.

  

it has been illustrated with an example of a sutra 'ikoyaNaci' how this comes very close to the syntax of context sensitive rules.  
  

  

Coming to the Free Word Order:  
  

Sanskrit is often quoted to be a Free Word Order Language. However, it has been pointed out that in some cases the word order does matter, else the meaning changes. Fritz Staal suggested a 'Calder mobile' model to describe the 'free word order'-ness.  
  

Brendan Gillon carried out some empirical study with a small corpus of
around1000 sentences to substantiate the claim of Fritz Staal.  

He worked in the Constituency Grammar framework, and studied the problems of dislocations.  
  

Later on we looked at the dislocation problem not only in the prose but also in the verses from Geeta, and studied the 'free word order' ness from dependency point of view. Our observations are, the words when are bound with the उत्थित आकांक्षा do not cross their boundaries, but the words connected due to उत्थाप्य आकांक्षा are found to cross the boundaries.
