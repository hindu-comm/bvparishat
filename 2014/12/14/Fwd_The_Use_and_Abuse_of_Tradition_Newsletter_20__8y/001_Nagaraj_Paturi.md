To the modernizer, Sanskrit is an elite language, forbidden to most inhabitants of the subcontinent by virtue of caste and gender. It is the language of a deeply unequal system.To the extent it has interesting ideas, the ideas are so far removed from modern concerns that there isn't much in the way of practical wisdom to be gained from studying these texts. *I agree with this view as well*.



1\. What is an elite language? Does it mean language once spoken by the elite ? What is meant by forbidden? 



Since the context has come, let me say this about language situation in ancient India when Sanskrit was spoken : Samskrita and Praakrita were not different languages. They were all different dialects of the same language. The dialect that was spoken by the s'iShTa persons was given the name samskrita and the dialects of that same language spoken by the prAkrita persons were called prAkritas. In any language with dialects, and a standard form , is the standard variety 'prohibited' from being spoken by the people who speak the non-standard dialects? or is it that standard form is called so because it is spoken in a standard (uniform and stable) form across the regions where the different dialects of that language are spoken? Anyone who has an elementary understanding of linguistics knows that the standard form of a languageis called so because it is spoken in a standard (uniform and stable) form across the regions where the different dialects of that language are spoken. Sanskrit was the standard form and the prAkritas were the dialects of the same language. Just as in any language, here too this kind of a language situation does not come into existence through prohibitions or permissions ; universally it happens naturally byitself. In the parts of the subcontinent where neither Samskrita nor the prAkritas were spoken, those languages were spoken not because Samskrita was prohibited from being spoken by them but because Samskrita was not their language.



2\. Given this universalfactof languages, how can it be called " the language of a deeply unequal system" ? Europe had its own highly unequal estate system that evolved into a still unequal class system later. Can the languages of those European societies be called languages of unequal systems? 



3\. The author says he agrees with the followingview of the 'modernizers' :"To the extent it has interesting ideas, the ideas are so far removed from modern concerns that there isn't much in the way of practical wisdom to be gained from studying these texts"



What are the modern concerns ?



Is health not a modern concern? Aren't Ayurveda and Yoga contained in Sanskrit sources being used by the present day societies all over the world? Is that not practical wisdom?



Are not areas such as NLP and machine translation concerns of modern man ? Aren't Paninian and related ideas being used in these areas? Isn't that practical wisdom?



If there is no practical wisdom contained in Sanskrit, why are there patent fights for some of the ideas contained in Sanskrit sources ?
