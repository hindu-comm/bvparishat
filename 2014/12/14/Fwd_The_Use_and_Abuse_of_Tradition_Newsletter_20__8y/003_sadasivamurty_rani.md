Pranams to all the learned members!

At the outset I thank Professor Srinivas Varakhedi Ji for enabling me to avail an opportunity to post this mail in this context. Here are a few observations of mine for the concern of all.

1. It seems right from the title here is something to be be paid our care n concern.

Does this title USE AND ABUSE OF TRADITION maintain any propriety of context? is the first question.

TRADITION is any long standing practice or custom. In case of our Indian tradition particularly in the field of KNOWLEDGE DISCIPLINES it is a grand collection of VALID PRACTICES through several generations of millennia's legacy.

Mere expertise in any single field does not make any one entitled to simply pass slackened comments as his mind does wish. One needs a constant and devoted study of many long years to understand, appreciate and analyse the content of our predecessors' contribution.

So in the TITLE of the article in the context just for rhyming the word ABUSE is MISUSED pairing with USE. To abuse our tradition we know how much potential one needs... mere vocabulary is sheer insufficient to do so.

  

2. Next in the order the words TRADITIONALISTS and MODERNISTS need to be paid attention.

In any other land it may be true to distinguish between the Traditionalists and Modernists. Both the groups may firmly and stubbornly confront and contradict each other. But in case of our country both TRADITION and MODERNITY go hand in hand. Here in our country TRADITIONALISTS are not conservative as often they are misunderstood. They always invite MODERNITY preserving the existing treasures of knowledge. Hence INDIAN KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS right from the Vedas do never confine to having Monumental Value. Always their Utilitarian Value is much honored through out the progressive history of our country.

HENCE we have the APPROPRIATE NAME for our TRADITION i.e. SANATANA which means MODERN FOREVER. Ours is not PURATANA TRADITION but it is SANATANA TRADITION (An appropriate word in English for is to be searched for this) . In our tradition confusion grows only when proper attention is not paid to the concept. If required attention is paid it adds to our confidence. 

3. The next attempt in this reply is to shed light on - the statement - "All modern scientific knowledge is contained int the Vedas.. So what?"
Yes. It is a over ambitious and over enthusiastic statement if any body says so. 

But it is not in appropriate to say that THERE IS SOME SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CONTENT OF HIGH VALUE in our VEDIC and ALLIED branches of literature. We have several evidences to prove it. Ancient Indian Temple Architecture, Ancient Indian Metallurgy, Long living Tradition of Ayurvedic Medicine and The principles of Meteorology available in Astronomical Texts are a few things to quote from the lot many subjects those were dealt with as a part of our ancient Indian Wisdom.

Here the available content can be categorized into the following heads:

i. CONCEPTS THOSE ARE EQUAL TO MODERN SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS MATCHING AT EVERY STEP

ii. CONCEPTS WHICH ARE MUCH MORE ADVANCED THAN THE MODERN ONES

iii. CONCEPTS WHICH ARE AS PRIMARY AS THE PRIMARY CONCEPTS OF THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC SECTIONS.

iv. CONCEPTS OF HIGH PRACTICAL VALUE TO TAKE UP MANY PROJECTS AND PURSUITS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MODERN SOCIETY

  

5. An OBSERVATION for the consideration of all about THE ROLE BEING PLAYED AND TO BE PLAYED BY THE MODERN SANSKRITISTS.

It was in the yester years Most of the Sanskritists confined to their traditional course of learning. There was much need felt to take the support of the statements of high reputed professionals from non-sanskrit groups like those of Scientists, Engineers, Lawyers and other such professions - for proving the CONTEMPORARINESS OF SANSKRIT IN THE MODERN AGE. 

But now during these few latest decades of transition Sanskritists of present generation are much much advanced to meet with the contemporary challenges and to compete with the modern expectations. In every field of modern knowledge pursuits there is either direct or indirect participation of Sanskritists also.

There is no dearth of resource persons from Sanskrit Community to help the modern science.

Further there is necessity of developing Academic programmes at : **Undergraduate and Post Graduate Levels to enable the future Sanskrit Graduates to serve any social field of service instead of confining to MERE TEACHING PROFESSION. **

Of course this is not to contextualize but to support the present thought flow it is being stated here that Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati and Sri Venkateswara Vedic University, Tirupati have their successful attempts in this direction to place on records.

  

SO before I envelop my reply I would like to say that - The Article USE AND ABUSE OF TRADITION could have been fit in the frame of the then scenario were it written or posted three decades ago and not now. At present its value can be cofined to its verbal richness.

Warm Regards to all

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
