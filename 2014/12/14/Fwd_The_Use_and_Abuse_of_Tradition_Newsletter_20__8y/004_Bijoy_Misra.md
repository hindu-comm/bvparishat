This is an admirable observation.  

Rajesh is a young scientist whom I knew when he was a student in MIT.  

The bridge betweenthe traditionalists' view and the application view has to be built.  

We have to look for the foundations of the language and then see the beauty of  
its application in everyday affair. A book by Dr Tandra Patnaik "Shabda", first  

published in 1994 is an effort in this direction in analyzing Bhartrhari. Learned  
scholars must get to the essence of knowledge than get stuck in the details.  
The path to Mechanics with everyday examples than using the Principia  

is the challenge the scholars face. We must find a way to talk to the average  

undergraduate why Sanskrit would be interesting for his life and living.
