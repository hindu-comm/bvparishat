For the sake of argument, let’s assume all modern scientific knowledge is contained in the Vedas. So what? How does that help us do science better? In fact, consider that Newton’s Principia contains a very large portion of modern scientific knowledge; yet no one is asking all school children to read the Principia. Instead, we teach them classical mechanics and the calculus.



Let us set aside the exaggerated, sometimes innocently and ignorantly chauvinistic claims such as " all modern scientific knowledge is contained in the Vedas".



Buthow is this analogy of principia suited here? The Vedas and ancient Sanskrit sources belong to a different knowledge tradition than the modern sciences; whereas principia belongs to the knowledge tradition of modern sciences only. Relation between school text books and principia is that of a simplified instructionalversion to its original deeply technical idea-proposing version of the same knowledge tradition. Relation between the Vedas (and ancient Sanskrit sources) and the modern ideas is not the same or similar.
