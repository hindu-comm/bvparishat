Dear list members

I am looking for the source of this verse, believed to be from a conversation between Prahlāda and Hiraṇyakaśipu.  

रामनाम जपतां कुतो भयं सर्वतापशमनैकभेषजम्।

पश्य तात मम गात्रसन्निधौ पावकोऽपि सलिलायतेऽधुना॥

Karapātra Svāmī Jī cites this verse in his work Rāmāyaṇa-mīmāṃsā but the citation simply reads नृ.पु. (for Nṛsiṃha Purāṇa?), without any chapter or verse number.  

I tried to search for the verse in the edition of Nṛsiṃha Purāṇa on the website of Maharishi University of Management, but could not find it.  

<http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/upapurana/narasimha_purana.pdf>

Any pointers are welcome.  

Nityānanda
