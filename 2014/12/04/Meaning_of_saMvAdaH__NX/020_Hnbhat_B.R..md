Yes. Guru-shiShya-saMvAda is within the intitiated topic, as Bhagavadgita, is well known as guru-shishya-saMvada.

  

पृच्छामि त्वां धर्मसम्मूढचेताः ।

यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्चितं ब्रूहि *तन्मे शिष्यस्तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम्।*

  

which lgave rise to the doubt, whether any conversion could be called as संवाद. and in continuation, it gave rise in turn, whether it could be used in the meaning of agreement, of opinion, मतसंवाद. whcih is not available in the context of Bhagavadgita, according to him. One can prove it is also there, as the whole is Bhagavadgita, is the agreement of opinion between श्रीकृष्णार्जुन-संवाद, as each chapter ends with the colophon. Or any meaning the word संवाद can give. but not विसंवाद. but it can have have वाद also:

  

अशोच्यानन्वशोचस्त्वं *प्रज्ञावादांश्च भाषसे ।*

गतासूनगतासूंश्च नानु शोचन्ति पंडिता: !  

  

So it is a kind of वाद, प्रज्ञा-वाद. not already covered so far. It can continue alright for a new संवाद.

  

Thank you pointing out to the focus of the thread.
