So Sriman Madhvācārya does not distinguish vāda from saṁvāda. In his view, all genuine receptive discussions between a well-wishing guru and humble disciple can also be called 'vāda'.



 -Vidwan Hari Parshad Dasji



Thus vAda is a kind of samvAda



 -Nagaraj



So there is no visamvAda between the two ideas.



Parama Poojya Ananda TIrthachArya (MadhvAchArya)'s words are not specifically from a 'Dvaita perspective'.



Nor are the words quoted by V. Subrahmanianji specifically Advaitic.



The issue of interpreting general words such as vAda and samvAda itself is such that it can not have different interpretations in different Vedantic traditions.



Let me share something different about samvAda now:



samvAda in the BhagavadgItA is a style/method of composing educating books. This is found in more ancient works such as Upanishads too. Narrative works such as Mahabharata, Mahabhagavata and different mahApurANas are also composed in a samvAda framework only building it as a samvAda between s'aunakAdi munis and the paurANika (ugras'ravasa in mahAbhArata) who in turn narrates it for example as a samvAda between Vais'ampAyana and JanamEjaya (in Mahabharata). There is a huge range of books covering various different fields composed as samvAda between S'iva and pArvati.



In books such as the gItA , the samvAda between Guru and S'ishyaworks as an excellentmethod of presenting the ideas because the S'ishya works as the representative of the adhikArI (target audience) of the book. Making the conversation to be between a Guru and a S'ishya suits the instructional nature of the book. Arjuna is made to raise the questions that the author expects to be cropping in the mind of the audience.
