argueing/ argumentation/disputing is a kind of conversation . vAda and samvAda are the Sanskrit words for argueing/ argumentation/disputing and conversation respectively. Thus vAda is a kind of samvAda.



vAda has mood and disposition elements that go against certain spiritual practices such as Bhakti. A non-vAda kind of samvAda is recommended for such practices. Bhakti-practitioners are advised againstvAda kind of samvAda.
