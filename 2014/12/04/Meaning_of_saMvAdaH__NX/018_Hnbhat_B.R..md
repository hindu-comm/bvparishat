This thread is on the meaning of संवाद, whether it has the meaning "agreement" or more than "conversation. And hence there is no need of वाद in this thrad which was included for the purpose of वाद only. If antything more than संवाद is needed, as V Surbrahmanyam suggested, to make clear the meaning of agreement, it is विसंवादः or disagreemtnt. Hence in this matter, there not any वाद. as the meaning required for achieved the purpouse as Ajith has pointed out.
