Respected scholars,

  

Pranams,  

  

The word संवादः is used in the Gita for describing the dialogue between Srikrishna & Arjina. Can any dialogue be called संवादः? Or does it denote only a dialogue between guru and sishya?  

  

Nowadays, we find this word is extensively used in religious dialogues (Matasamvada) which is not a Guru Sishya Samvada. Is it right to use संवादः in this context?  



regards  
shankara
