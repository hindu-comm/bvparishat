Bhat Mahodaya & Hegade Mahodaya,

  

Thank you both very much for explaining the meaning of संवादः in different contexts. The examples provided by you were helpful to me. I had assumed that Sanskrit commentaries would have given some special meaning to संवादः. Now, it seems that it is not so.

  

After receiving your mails, I found that Sabda Kalpadruma mentions that संवादः is used by Srikrishna in Bhagavad Gita 18-70. अध्येष्यते च य इमं धर्म्यं संवादम् आवयोः। ज्ञान‍यज्ञेन तेनाहम् इष्टः स्याम् इति मे मतिः॥ I checked various commentaries on the Gita. None of the commentators attribute any special meaning to संवादः.



regards  
shankara
