\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  

from a Dvaita perspective, Sriman Madhvācārya has written the following beautiful words in his composition named "Kathā-lakṣaṇam":  
  
vādo jalpo vitaṇḍeti  
trividhā viduṣām kathā  
  
"Amongst learned philosophers, discussions can be classified into three types — vāda, jalpa and vitaṇḍa."  
  
tattva-nirṇayam-uddiśya  
kevalaṁ guru-śiśyayoḥ  
kathā ‘nyeṣām api satām  
vādo vā samiteḥ śubhā  
  
"Discussions primarily between the spiritual master and disciple that are auspiciously aimed only at establishing the truth are described by the learned as vāda."  
  
khyātyādyarthaṁ spardhayā vā  
satāṁ jalpa itīryate  
  
"Discussions driven by the desire to earn prestige or the desire to win a debate are classified by the wise as jalpa."  
  
vitaṇḍā tu satām-anyais  
tattvameṣu nigūhitaṁ  
  
"A discussion that takes place between an honest person and a wicked wrangler intent only on destroying the genuine arguments of his honest opponent, without paying any heed to the establishment of truth, is called vitaṇḍā."  
  

So Sriman Madhvācārya does not distinguish vāda from saṁvāda. In his view, all genuine receptive discussions between a well-wishing guru and humble disciple can also be called 'vāda'.
