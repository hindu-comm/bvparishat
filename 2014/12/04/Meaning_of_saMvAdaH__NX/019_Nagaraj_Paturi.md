This thread is on the meaning of संवाद, whether it has the meaning "agreement" or more than "conversation



The thread began with the following:



The word संवादः is used in the Gita for describing the dialogue between Srikrishna & Arjina. Can any dialogue be called संवादः? Or does it denote only a dialogue between guru and sishya?

Nowadays, we find this word is extensively used in religious dialogues (Matasamvada) which is not a Guru Sishya Samvada. Is it right to use संवादः in this context?



Discussion on samvAda nature of BhagavadgItA and why Guru-S'ishya there is well within the initiated topic.
