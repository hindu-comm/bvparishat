\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~  
  
Praṇāmas to all vidvaj-janas. Thank you shankara ji for bringing up this topic. I would like to speak some of my thoughts on the topic of ***vāda*** vs. ***saṁvāda***.  
  

There are many restrictions for those who practice yoga. One essential restriction for those who practice bhakti-yoga is found in the Nārada-bhakti-sūtra (74) as follows,

***vādo nāvalambyaḥ* (NBS 74)**

**“Do not take shelter of vāda (argument).”**

The term vāda in many places is used to denote ordinary day to day conversations. However, that is not being prevented in this sūtra. This is because, if ordinary conversations are restricted, all bhakti-yogīs will have to enter into a state of permanent silence.

Instead, the wrangling spirit of debate has been prohibited in this sūtra. The term vāda should be understood in its proper context. Vāda here means argumentative debate. The nārada-bhakti-sūtra prohibits argumentative debate, even if it is to apparently establish what one considers as truth. Indeed, even if you firmly believe that your spiritual path is the best, do not prove this point to others while bruising their ego.

The term ***vāda*** is indeed properly defined by Gautama in his Nyāya-sūtras (aphorisms of logic) as follows,

***pramāṇa-tarka-sādhanopālambha-siddhāntāviruddhaḥ pañcāvayavopapannaḥ pakṣa-pratipakṣa-parigraho vādaḥ* (Nyāya sūtras 1.2.1)**

**“Vāda means the proposition of a concept (pakṣa) and counter concept (pratipakṣa) which is supported and confuted by means of proofs and reasonings.”**

It is this concept of a wrangling spirit of vāda that is being spoken of in the Nārada-bhakti-sūtras.

Someone may ask, “What about the submissive vāda between a guru and a receptive disciple which establishes truths about jñāna, bhakti and love of God? Should that be avoided too?”

There are many discussions regarding such truths throughout the various texts. The conversation between Krishna and Arjuna; the conversation between Śukadeva Gosvāmī and Parīkṣita; the conversation between Vidura and Maitreya; Are all these also argumentative vāda?

Certainly not! And neither should such discussions be avoided by those who traverse on the path of spirituality. The Nārada-bhakti-sūtras do not imply that discussions which strengthen one’s bhakti should be avoided. All the above mentioned discussions are indeed, not classified as ***vāda***, but rather they are classified as ***saṁvāda***. Discussions between a receptive listener and a well-wishing preceptor are not usually classified as ***vāda***. They are termed as ***saṁvāda***.

Indeed, the conversation between Śukadeva Gosvāmī and Parīkṣita is termed by all the speakers of the bhāgavata as *śuka-parīkṣita-saṁvāda*. Even the conversation between Arjuna and Krishna is termed by Sañjaya as follows,

***ity ahaṁ vāsudevasya pārthasya ca mahātmanaḥ  
**"saṁvādam"** imam aśrauṣam adbhutaṁ roma-harṣaṇam***

**“Thus have I heard the saṁvāda (conversation) of two great souls, Krishna and Arjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.” (Gīta 18.74)**

It is also true at the same time that sometimes the technique of vāda leads one to know certain truths. A famous poem titled Śuka-raṁbhā-***saṁvāda*** glorifies the merit of vāda done by learned souls as follows,

***tīrthe tīrthe nirmalaṁ sādhu-vṛndaṁ  
vṛnde vṛnde tattva-cintānuvādaḥ  
vāde vāde jāyate tattva-bodhaḥ  
bodhe bodhe sac-cid-ānanda-rūpam***

**“In every holy place, one meets saintly souls. And from each saintly soul, one hears vāda about various truths. And with each new vāda one’s knowledge of the essential truths of life increases, and with such increase in knowledge, one stabilizes the transcendental form of the Lord within one’s heart.” (Verse 3)**

Vāda is also an opulence of Krishna:

***vādaḥ pravadatām aham* (Gītā 10.32) — “Amongst arguers, I am the argument (vāda).”**

How can Nārada-bhakti-sūtras speak against an opulence of the Lord? Since ***vāda*** is an opulence of the Lord, it must be respected and accepted by all bhakti-yogīs . But then again, ***vāda*** is not the only opulence of Lord Krishna that *yogīs* stay away from. There are other opulences too, which *yogīs* should avoid at all costs, for example,  

***dyūtaṁ chalayatām asmi* (Gītā 10.36) — “I am gambling amongst all means of cheating.”**

So it doesn’t come as a surprise if Nārada-bhakti-sūtras asks us to avoid these opulences of the Lord, especially ***vāda***.

The Śrīmad-bhāgavatam (11.18.30) clearly distinguishes an argumentative ***vāda*** from a submissive respectful reception. Śrīmad-bhāgavatam calls it ***śuṣka-vāda***:

***śuṣka-vāda-vivāde na kañcit pakṣaṁ samāśrayet* (SB 11.18.30)**

**“A devotee should never speak like a mere logician or skeptic or take any side whatsoever in useless arguments.”**

This is because argumentative vāda is unending and never reaches a proper conclusion. The Śrīmad-bhāgavatam (6.4.31) specifies this as follows:

***yac-chaktayo vadatāṁ vādināṁ vai  
vivāda-saṁvāda-bhuvo bhavanti  
kurvanti caiṣāṁ muhur ātma-mohaṁ  
tasmai namo 'nanta-guṇāya bhūmne***

**“Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead, who possesses unlimited transcendental qualities. Acting from within the cores of the hearts of all philosophers (vādīs), who propagate various views (vādas), he causes them to forget their own souls while sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing among themselves. Thus he creates within this material world a situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion. I offer my obeisances unto him.” (SB 6.4.31)**

Ideal discussions (*saṁvādas*) take place between ***sa-hṛdayas*** (like-minded personalities). Such discussions are beautifully described in the Bhagavad-gītā (10.9):

***mac-cittā mad-gata-prāṇā  
bodhayantaḥ parasparam  
kathayantaś ca māṁ nityaṁ  
tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca***

***"*The thoughts of those surrendered devotees always think about me, for their very lives are surrendered unto me. They derive great satisfaction and bliss from enlightening one another and conversing about me.*"***

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,

hari pārṣada dāsa.
