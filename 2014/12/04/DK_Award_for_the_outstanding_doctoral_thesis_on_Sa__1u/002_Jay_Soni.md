Dear DrGasūns,

Thank you for your interest in the DK Award. There is nor prescribed language for a dissertation submitted in the field of

Sanskrit, so you are indeed entitled to submit your application for the award. Please follow the instructions mentioned

in the link already given. The IASS Board will then take the necessary steps.

  

With best wishes,

J. Soni

Secretary General of the IASS
