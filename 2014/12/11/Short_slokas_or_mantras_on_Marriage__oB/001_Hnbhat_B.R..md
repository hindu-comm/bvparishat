The best blessing (I am not sure whether it fits for this modern age or not when such a scene is rare in our present society).

  

  

The Ideal Married Life

इहैव स्तं मा वियौष्टं विश्वमायुर्व्यश्नुतम् ।

क्रीळन्तौ पुत्रैर्नप्तृभिर्मोदमानौ स्वे गृहे ॥ ऋग्वेद मं०१० । सू०८५ । मन्त्र ४२ ॥



*Meaning* - This mantra talks about an ideal married life, or grhastha-ashrama. It says - O Husband and Wife! Remain here only - do not separate. Attain your full ages. While playing with your children and grandchildren, be happy in your own home.

  

  

Thus, the mantra pictures an ideal married life as follows -

1\. The marriage should be between a husband and a wife. The mantra uses Dual Number signifying this. Thus, the Vedas do not propound many husbands or many wives.

2\. The husband and wife should live together. Divorce is not a happy situation, nor is living separately.

3\. The parents should spend time with their children, not leave them to Ayyas. They should even spend time with their grandchildren. Recent Western studies have shown that the grandparents instil values in their grandchildren, and make them happy.

4\. A joint family where all stay together is advised.
