Thanks Prof. R N Iyengar.



This is not an obscure book.



There are many aspects of significance of this book :



1\. This is a 19th century book. One more book to prove that Sanskrit literature continued to be vibrant , responded to modernity and expressed modern ideas so early in time. There were several threads on the 1800-1950 Sanskrit literaturein BVP.



2\. It documents several facts like Sanskrit associations of the time.



3\. It documents the fact that Sanskrit book writing acquired modern features such as making historical arguments,proposingacknowledgements etc.
