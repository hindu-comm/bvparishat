The Title page and contents pages are available. It seems to tbe a historical account of Sri Shankaracharya,

The above is the contents page. It is not a Stotra, but a simple historical account in verses. Like other Shankara Digvijaya-s by different authors. But this is a recent one, composed on historical account from the history of literature quoting the historians of History of Literature in the Introduction in prose. The rest is in Anushtup Verses.

  

You could have understood, if you had tried to read the first few pages or downloading the pages.

  

As Nagaraj has remarked, the word चूर्णिका is simply mean a couple of verses or lose verses called मुक्तक-s. And the word is used as the name of some commentaries also, चूर्णिका, चूर्णिः, अवचूर्णिः, etc.

  

This contains both verses and proses, written in modern style, printed in paragraphs, and quotations from Madhava, and other earlier digvijaya writers.
