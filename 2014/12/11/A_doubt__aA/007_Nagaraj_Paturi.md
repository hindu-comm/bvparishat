With regard to the word chUrNikA used in the title of the book:



1\. The author doesn't say anything about this word inside the book.



2.Dr. H N Bhat quoted words close to chUrNikA but not chUrNikA itself. But his citations indicate that these are prose forms



3\. I found a commentary on SrimadbhAgavatam with name chUrNikA.



4\. Thus prose works with the name chUrNikA are possible.



5\. The present work under discussion is also a prose work.



6\. When I said, "chUrNikA is a genre of stotra lyrics used in classical dance. Classical dance item in which chUrNikA is performed is also called chUrNikA",



I said it with a direct knowledge as a teacher and researcher of chUrNikAs.



7\. Just for the purpose of substantiation from other sources, to establishhow widely such an understanding of thewell established technical termis prevalent,let me cite from different pages Igot for a random searchfor the word churnika



Her repertoire touched all aspects of this art form, beginning with Churnika, an ancient invocation followed by Pallavi (Kacheyri Aata) embracing Swara Shabda Sahitya (nritta and nritya).

First up was a veritable tongue twister of alliterative prose (*Jayatu jayatu*), which Sumitra sang with consummate ease. In this *churnika,* Tyagarajasvami, with almost breathless awe, describes Narada’s vision of Vaikuntha with all its opulence. The beautiful *sahitya* caressed by the lilting notes of Arabhi, Mohanam and Varali made for a piquant opener

8\. But it is true that none of these is relevant in the context of the present work.



9\. Since the author doesn't say anything in this regard, justification for his use of the term remains intriguing.
