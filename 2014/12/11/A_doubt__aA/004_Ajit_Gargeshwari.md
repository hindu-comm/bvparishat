The book has discussion on the date of Adi Shankaracharya is useful for students of Indian History nothing special. If some one has the missing pages please share them so that the book will be complete  
  

A brief synopsys of the book is given  
  
This book in excellent readable Sanskrit was published in 1898. It is authored by Sri Gurunatha,a scholar steeped in tradition but who had a BA degree also. An example of Sanskrit scholarship combined with western type education. Those who like to read Sanskrit texts in original would find the work interesting.
