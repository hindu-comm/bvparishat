There is no possible other intriguing them



Though I fail to understand this sentence, I guess that it means there is no need for intrigue here , the work is called a chUrNikA because it is a prose work and a commentary. Such a meaning for the word chUrNikA is possible. Accepted sir.



I was justifying my words in my first response at a stage when the 'doubt' was brushed aside andthe thread initiator did not share the link to the work under discussion.



Once again, let me say, sir, you are right.



I am happynot to have allowed the thread to have been nipped in the bud.
