Though the author doesn't day any explanation for naming as चूर्णिका, obviously it is prose as you go through the pages and verses are quoted from different works. There is no possible other intriguing them. Monier Williams gives the meaning for word चूर्णिका, possibly derived from चूर्ण, a variety of गद्य, as defined by Vamana.

  

All the meaning could be related, if one wants to do so. चूर्णिका, चूर्णिः, अवचूर्णिः, are the names of commentaries, though MW has seen only in Jain commentaries.
