Good effort, well-designed.

  

Proofreading was expected to be better, given this is coming from Samskrita Bharati.

  

Both in Sanskrit -  

"प्राप्तवरान्" (प्राप्य वरान्)  

"जाग्रत" is missing from the quote (The Upanisad Vakya is उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान् निबोधत)

"भगवद् गीता" (भगवद्गीता is a compound word)

and in English -  

"Hoower" (Hoover)

"Plerre" (Pierre)  

"Jejus" (Seriously? That too twice?)  

"Charactar"
