Dr Bhat,  
Amazing...  

I have interest in the application of vowels to indicate time in old Prakrit.  

(This is from phonetic and cognitive point of view of natural communication)  

I would be looking for further analytic studies on verb endings in old oral Prakrit.  

A good Jaina reference on grammar of old Prakrit or Magadhi would be immensely helpful.  

Similarly any studies on verb endings in Sanskrit and local languages would also be useful  

(I have not gone there yet!)  

Let me express my admiration to the resource base in this group.  

Happy New Year
