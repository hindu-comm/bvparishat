See this link for a discussion related to Sanskrit and Praktit:

According to PaniniyaSiksha, both are said to be containing 63 or 64 वर्ण-s.

  

त्रिषष्टिश्चतुःषटिर्वा वर्णा शम्भुमतेमताः ।

प्राकृते संस्कृते चापि स्वयं प्रोक्ताः स्वयम्भुवा ॥ ३ ॥

  

This also discusses the origin of Sanskrit :

The division as भाषा, विभाषा, उपभाषा is the distinction of dramatic languages used in नाट्यशास्त्र, but gives a common features of all the dialects. I do not check in the 17th Chapter, where these descriptions are given as भाषा, विभाषा etc.

  

षड्भाषाचन्द्रिका as the name suggests.the six varieties equally called as भाषा and अपभ्रंश is a different language, dealt with in प्राकृताध्याय of हेमचन्द्रव्याकरण, and there is no question of विभाषा.

  

प्राकृतप्रकाश of वररुचि or चण्ड-s प्राकृतशब्दानुशासन do not speak of the other dialects at all.

  

This much information I can give offhand without referring to any specific text and there may be modern books on the History of Prakrit as a language and literature. There is a detailed account in the introduction to पाइअसद्दण्णवो published by Motilal Banarsidas, of which e-copy is available in DLI. I can extract the relevant portion of the Introduction from the book with me if you want.

  

  

  

कच्चाअण's व्याकरण deals only with पाली.
