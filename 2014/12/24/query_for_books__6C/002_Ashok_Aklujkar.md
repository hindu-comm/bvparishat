Joshi, Shivram Dattatray. 1975. Ed. tr. Pata\~jali’sn Vyåkara.a-Mahåbhå.ya, Kårakåhnika … Other author: Roodbergen, J. A. F. Poona: University of Poona. Publications of the Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, class C, no. 10. This includes Kaiya.ta’s Pradiipa and Naage;sa’s/Naagoji-bha.t.ta’ Uddyota.

Bhaava-;suddhi is the name of a commentary, not of the author. The author is Aananda-puur.na-muni. The work was edited, along with Cit-sukha’s / Cit-sukha-muni’ps commentary, by N.S. Anantakrishna Sastri. It wass published in 1963 in Madras Government Oriental Series as no. CLXI.

  

As far as my experience goes, it is not widely known in India that Vaacaspati-mi;sra’s commentary (of the Pa;njikaa variety, titled Tattva-samiik.saa) on the Brahma-siddhi has also been published: editor: Diwakar Acharya. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag. 2006.
