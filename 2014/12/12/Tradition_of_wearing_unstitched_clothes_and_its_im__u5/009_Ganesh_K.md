Namonamah,

  

The question and the pursuant discussion is demanding scholarly resources to be listed for seemingly simple and commonly practiced dharma. Vedhokhilo dharmamoolam and we have lot of shruti pramana for this injunction followed literally (same word reused indeed) by the kalpasutakaras for the brahmana injunction on the mandatory right for yajamana which refers the dress to be akin to skin and its relation with cowhide and later explanations for daily used after bath wear as well to qualify for the rules. Also studious one can easily stumble upon the kashyapokti in shadkarmachandrika that specifies"Asuuchividdham" (असूचिविद्धम्) and Bhrgu quoted as "nagnascha syuutavastrah syaad".

  

  

regards,

Ganesh K.
