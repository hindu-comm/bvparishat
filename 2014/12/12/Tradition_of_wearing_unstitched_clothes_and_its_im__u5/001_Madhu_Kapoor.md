I have a very good explanation for wearing unstiched clothes that is symbolically it represents that you are open on all sides and not limited by the stiches and cuts. It shows the openness and boundary-lessness in the tradition. It has a spiritual intonation paving the way for infinity. This explanation is endorsed by my teacher too.
