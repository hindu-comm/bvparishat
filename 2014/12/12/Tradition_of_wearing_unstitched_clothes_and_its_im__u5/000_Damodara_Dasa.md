Hare Krishna.  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I have heard that strength and potency on all levels - physical,  
mental, intellectual, psychic, and spiritual - are preserved by  
wearing unstitched cloth.  
  
I would like to know if anyone has some information about the sources  
(mainly purANas, veda, etc.; and any research based on these sources)  
describing importance of wearing unstitched clothes (which is well  
known in Indian tradition both sankarites and vaisnavas).  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
