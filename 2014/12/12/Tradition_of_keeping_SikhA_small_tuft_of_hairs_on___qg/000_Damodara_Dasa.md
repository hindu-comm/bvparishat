Hare Krishna.  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I have heard --  
"The sikha on the top of the head is to protect the brahma-randhra.  
Retaining a sikha also helps prevent loss of prana through the  
brahma-randhra." But i do not know its source and authenticity.  
I would like to know if anyone has already got some information of or  
resource to mAhAtmya of keeping zikhA in literatures like purANas etc.  
and also to description of its benefits.  
  
\[zikhA means "a tuft or lock of hair on the crown of the head"\]  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
