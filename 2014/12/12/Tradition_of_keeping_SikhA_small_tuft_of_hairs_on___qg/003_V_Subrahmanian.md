While Sri SMK has provided some inputs, one can also consider these:  
  

1. In anga-kara nyāsa during pūjā, there is a 'shikhāyai vaṣaṭ' when he will have to touch the shikhā  
  

2\. During sannyāsa, one has to give up shikhā and yajnopavīta  
  

3\. In purāṇa one comes across a very demeaning punishment where the shikhā of the wrongdoer (especially if he is a brāhmaṇa) is removed and his is let go.   
  

In the mahābhārata there is a person known as panchashikha. I do not know what it means.  
  

In this search result there are several references, one even from purva mimamsa:
