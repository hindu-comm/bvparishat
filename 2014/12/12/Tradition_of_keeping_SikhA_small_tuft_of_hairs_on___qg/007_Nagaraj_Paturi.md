chUDAkaraNa and munDana are inseparable parts of the same ritual. munDana related mantras speak of removal of sins through removal of hair. Hair is probably considered symbolic of sins.



So chUDA/ s'ikhA can be seen as the portion of hair left without being removed.



The sus'rutasamhita quote mentioned in my previous post may provide some clue for the leaving of that portion.
