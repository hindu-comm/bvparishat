Hare Krishna.  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
  
It is a tradition for married women to wear bindis on forehead almost  
all over India.  
Is there any mention in purANas, or smRtis, etc about this, anyone is aware of?  
  
\[Although this is a very small point but I just asked it if someone  
already has information about it.\]  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das.
