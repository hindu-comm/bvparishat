I thinkit is my responsibilitysaythe following words about Dr. K. Aravinda Rao's relation with Sanskrit, in the context of thecontents of the article.



He is fluently conversant in Sanskrit and prefers to write /speak in Sanskrit only wherever he finds appropriate audience.



He did his PhD in Sanskrit on the Upanishads.
