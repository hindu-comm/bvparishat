Dear scholar friends,  
  
I am glad to read Dr Rao's observation as translated by Prof Putari.  
My own conversion to Sanskrit happened observing the Harvard commencement exercises.  

Sanskrit was taught but not for oratory and recitation. Beautiful Greek oratory passages  

were recited as invocation. I started the Sanskrit conversation table in the Sanskrit Department  
at Harvard in 1992. Members in the Faculty did join in. Students had only lukewarm support.  

Sri Krishna Shastri showed up in one of our meetings in 1994 and spoke about his vision of  

Sanskrita Bharati. I organized people in the community who had interest in Sanskrit and we  

started teaching in order to promote and popularize. Ashok Aklujkar and Arvind Sharma  
helped our efforts when they were at Harvard. Other centers developed around the US  
and our students helped in encouraging new entries. Encouraging undergraduates to take  

Sanskrit as a discipline has not succeeded. I believe that the contribution of the language  

to the knowledge discovery should be the next step. "Sanskrit for Sanskrit sake" is a  

view that has been nurtured for the last hundred years. We have to convert that to  

"Sanskrit for knowledge sake" and create many inter-disciplinary education centers to  

study phonetics, speech, music, grammar and literature. The students must feel that  

Sanskrit contains fundamental research in cognition, neuroscience, communication  
and expression. Some of these areas need much more analysis in a mode of discovery.  
  

The conversation table at Harvard continues on Tuesday evenings at the Humanities Center  
and is hosted by Mr Thomas Burke, the veteran linguist, who taught at Benares Sanskrit College  
in the '60s. Proficient in Latin, Greek, German, Pali and Sanskrit, Mr Burke attracts scholars  

from different groups to take interest in Sanskrit.  

  

I wish you all Happy Holidays and a Happy New year.
