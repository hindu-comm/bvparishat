Hari Om Blessed Self!

  

Greetings from CIF!!

  

The Vedic Mathematics Course was launched on Dec 21, 2012, the birthday of Srinivasa Ramanujan. This year, as we celebrate 2 years, we share the joy of having reached far-and-wide in our endeavour to spread the knowledge of ancient Indian Mathematics.

  

The Vedic Mathematics online course and the Vedic Mathematics DVD are available at a special price until December 31, 2014.

  

Please visit<http://vedicmaths.chinfo.org> to register for the course. Visit the CIF Chinmaya Vani Online Store on [www.chinfo.org/cifchinmayavani](http://www.chinfo.org/cifchinmayavani) to buy the DVD.
