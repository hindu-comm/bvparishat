We have to know from Vidwan Parameshwarji whether he was looking for a book called Panchakosha vivaranam or an explanation of the concept of Panchakosha.



His wording is 'send me'. That is used for a book.



But if he did not mean a book, any explanation/commentary oftaittireeyopanishad should be useful.



Or, if he has specific questions, he may state them clearly.
