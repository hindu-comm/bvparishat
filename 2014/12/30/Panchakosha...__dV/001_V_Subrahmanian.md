In the Panchadashi of Swami Vidyaranya the third chapter is called 'panchakoshaviveka prakaranam'. You can read that with the commentary of Sri Ramakrishna in Sanskrit. The moola is available for reading here:  
  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/panchadashi.pdf>  
  

The English translation can be read here:  
  
<http://www.shankaracharya.org/panchadasi_trans_3.php#1>  
  

In case you want to read the Shaankara bhashya for the Taittiriyopanishad where the five koshas are taught you may do so by accessing the 'advaita shaaradaa' facility at sringeri website.
