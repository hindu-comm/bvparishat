On making a search on the internet with the word पञ्चकोशविवरणम् this is the only result that leads one to the Panchadashi of Swami Vidyaranya:  
  
  
<http://www.vedantavichara.com/tattvaviveka.html>  
  
  

This happens to be the first chapter of that work. However, the topic पञ्चकोशविवरणम् is not that of the Panchadashi; it is that of the editor of that page. The details of the pancha koshas are available in the 3rd chapter of the work as I had pointed out earlier.
