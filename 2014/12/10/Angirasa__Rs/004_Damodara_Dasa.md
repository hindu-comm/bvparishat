Some information about Angirasa in nutshell:  
--------------------------------------------------------------------  
Angirasa: He is the son of Maharsi angirä and is known as bRhaspati,  
the priest of the demigods. It is said that DroNAcArya was  
his partial  
incarnation. SukrAcArya was the spiritual master of the demons, and  
BRhaspati challenged him. His son is Kaca, and he delivered the fire weapon  
first to BharadvAja Muni. He begot six sons (like the fire-god) by his wife  
CandramAsI, one of the reputed stars. He could travel in space, and  
therefore he could present himself even in the planets of Brahmaloka and  
Indraloka. He advised the King of heaven, Indra, about conquering the  
demons. Once he cursed Indra, who thus had to become a hog on the earth  
and was unwilling to return to heaven. Such is the power of the attraction  
of the illusory energy. Even a hog does not wish to part  
with its earthly  
possessions in exchange for a heavenly kingdom. He was the religious  
preceptor of the natives of different planets.
