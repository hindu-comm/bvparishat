All the words with dEva are not relevant in this context.



The compounds with dEva as the first word are only relevant.



Even among them where the contextual meaning of dEva is obvious are not to be compared to the compound dEvanAgarI.



In compounds such as dEvanadI, dEvagAndhArI , just as in dEvanAgarI, the meaning of dEva is tricky, intriguing.



Only such compounds are useful for a comparative study and a possible consequent benefit in understanding the word dEva in thecompound dEvanAgarI.
