Namaste  
  

The word 'Devanāgarī' is not listed in the Amarakosha and perhaps not in the nighanṭu / nirukta. May I request the scholars here to help understanding the derivation of the word and the meaning. It is generally understood to be the name of the script currently used to write Sanskrit/Hindi. We also understand from searches on the internet that this script evolved much later, preceded by nāgara/nāgarī. What does the component 'deva' serve in this word? Has anyone identified the oldest preserved devanagari manuscript/document? Are there manuscripts of the Mahabharata in nagara , that is preceding the devanagari?
