Dear Sri Nagaraj Paturi ji,  
  

Thanks for the various inputs you have provided on the topic(s) from an apparently rare article. As it is with the case of most of our past things/concepts/persons/authorship/works etc, one will have to resort to hypothesis rather than say with certainty as 'idam ittham.'.  
  

It is interesting to note that the author of the article has taken a lot of interest in the topic.  
  

warm regards
