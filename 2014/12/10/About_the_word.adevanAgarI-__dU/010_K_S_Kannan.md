Dear All,

  

The various contributors here have shed light on different aspects, especially historical, of the problem, but little light has been shed on the component *deva* in the compound *devanagari*. I would like to add a point from a different approach (which may also be considered very ancient) and somewhat belatedly though.

  

There is a Vedic saying (sorry, I could not trace the reference immediately) that says that men model their modes (or are themselves modelled) after the mode of the divinities :

*daivIm vidhAm anu manus"yAH.*

*  
*

The sacrifice that humans perform, and in the final analysis, every proper action, ought to be a mimesis of the archetype, an emulation of what was acted out by the divinities in the beginning.

*  
*

(For a parallel, later, idea, see Genesis 1 : 26-27 that man was created after the image of the God - *imago dei*).

  

Says Ananda Coomaraswamy in his article entitled

"What Has India Contributed to Human Welfare?" :  

  

"The Bramanical idea is an Indian "City of the gods" - as *devanagari*, the name of the Sanskrit script, suggests. The building of that city anew is the constant talk of civilisation; and though the details of our plans may change,and the contours of our building, we may learn from India to build on the foundations of the religion of Eternity."

  

He again says in yet another writing, entitled

"The Nature of "Folklore" and "Popular Art" :

  

"The doctrine that human works of art (*s'ilpAni*) are imitations of heavenly forms, and that by means of their rhythm there can be effected a metrical reconstitution (*samskaraNa*) of the limited human personality, dates at least from the Brahmana period, and is implied in the Rgveda. "Sanskrit" itself is constructed (*samskRtam*) in just this sense; it is something more than merely "human" speech, and when the corresponding script is called *devanAgarI*, this undoubtedly implies that the human script is an imitation of means of communication in the "city of the gods"".

  

Much can, and perhaps should, be said to elucidate and elaborate the ideas adumbrated here, but that will take us too afar.

  

I hope I have "introduced" a different route/dimension towards a (re)solution of the problem.

  

Regards

Kannan
