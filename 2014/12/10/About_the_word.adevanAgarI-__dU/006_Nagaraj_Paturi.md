1\. The component देवin the word देवनागरी is accepted by scholars to be of recent origin.



2\. The component नंदिin the word नंदिनागरीis accepted to be older.



3.Probably that is why it has beenproposed that the component देवin the word देवनागरी is added in imitation of or to indicate distinction from the word नंदिनागरी.



4\. The component देवis found in some other words like देवनदी ,देवगांधारी etc. Study of these words may provide some clue.



5\. सिद्धम्is the older descendent of ब्राह्मी than नागरी. So it may be hypothesized that the word नागरी was coined to indicate the distinction of the new script from the older सिद्धम्. As part of such a hypothesis , it can be said that the word नागरी was intended to indicate 'more sophisticated (than siddham)' , since 'urban' is considered to be 'more sophisticated'.
