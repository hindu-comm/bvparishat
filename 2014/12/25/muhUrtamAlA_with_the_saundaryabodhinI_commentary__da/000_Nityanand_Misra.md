Namaste

  

I am looking for Raghunātha Daivajña's Muhūrtamālā with the Saundaryabodhinī commentary by Mahesvara Ramachnadra Sukhthankar. As per A Supplementary Catalogue of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit Books in the Library of the British Museum (Acquired during the years 1892 to 1906),Muhūrtamālāis "a metrical work, in nine chapters, on astrologically auspicious moments" an edition was published in 1892 at Mumbai. No further details are given in the Catalogue.
