Well done Uttaraji. Your wide analysis of science and technology in sanskrit literature deserves all appreciations. Congratulations. An interational conference of lady sanskrit scholars is being held by delhi sanskrit academy in near future. I hope to see you there. Meanwhile heartiest greetings for the New Year to you and your family. Rajkumari Trikha
