Dear Rajkumariji,

  

Thank you very much for your appreciation. I value it highly.

  

I am not aware of this conference for women Sanskrit scholars. Will try finding out details. If you are aware of a website link, please forward to me. However, I may be too late already!

  

Heartiest wishes to you and your family for a wonderful New Year, too! As to all the Vidwat Parishat Parivar!

  

Warm Regards,

  

Uttara.
