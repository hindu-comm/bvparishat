Dear Scholars,

  

What are you plans for the year end holidays? For those rational minds who enjoy polemics, Atmashrama is conducting a workshop on Sri Vyasatirtha's Bhedojjivana, a classic work written to establish the validity of the Five-Fold Differences (Pancha Bhedas) . Block your time this Saturday, 27th December, 2014 to participate in this workshop where experts in the domain would take us through a journey into the profound thoughts of Sri Vyasatirtharu. All Vidwans, Vidyarthis and all Jignasus are hereby invited to attend. Come attend this event in large numbers and make it a grand success. For more information about participation you can call [7259670376](tel:(725)%20967-0376).
