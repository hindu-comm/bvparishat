I don't think any ancient texts knew Infinity as a modern mathematical concept we understand today.  
  
In mathematics, infinity is the conceptual expression of such a "numberless" number. It is often symbolized by the lemniscate (also known as the *lemniscate of Bernoulli* ), which looks something like the numeral 8 written sideways ( ![](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/FSWFoCm8Y5cTuHIYgILmht36KJXhZdqgbcNp_26l2ZwmS8TvAmhFz9F4CxrLbi5JBvl4zOnWOl2SUkcb-tjdbMrSC-j3isIBKVE=s0-d-e1-ft#http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs/images/infinity.jpg)).  
  
In a metaphysical discussion of God or the Absolute, there are questions of whether an ultimate entity must be infinite and whether lesser things could be infinite as well
