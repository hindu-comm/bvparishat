\<It is not any word that denotes infinity, that Ashrish has asked, but about the mathematical symbol for infinity in our ancient scriptures.>  

That it is not mathematical was stated in my mail. But since mahattara and a.nutara are non-entities they come mean biggest that is infinite and smallest that is infinitesimal without mathematical connotation
