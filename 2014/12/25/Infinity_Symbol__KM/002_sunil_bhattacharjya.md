There is one symbol, which is expressed as Shunya, and it is more likely to be misunderstood than otherwise. Shunya represents infinity or the infinitely expanded state. Anything expanded to **infinity** cannot be observed though it does not become non-existent. That is also the reason the infinite (sarva-vyaapak) Lord Vishnu is also called Shunya. Lord Buddha gave one example to make people understand what Shunya is. Take a glass of water and let it evaporate. The water disappperas but it does not become non-existenct.  
  
Hope this helps.
