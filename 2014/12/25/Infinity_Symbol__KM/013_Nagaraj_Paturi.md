All these documents are centred around the mathematical concept of infinity only and the discussion in all the documents is in comparison to the modern mathematical concept of infinity only.



There is a deeper discussion on notions such as innumerability , enumerable, multiple dimensions of infinity etc.



Prof. Avinash Sathaye's pdf link discusses non-Jain sources while the remaining are about Jain sources.



The fresh one from Vidwan MD Srinivas also confirmsthe point.
