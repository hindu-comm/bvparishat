Namaste

  

Does anybody know of a place in India where I can borrow/buy hard copy books published by Nirnay Sagar Press? Any antique book shop or second-hand book store? Or any libraries whose membership is open to independent researchers? Or even individuals who are willing to lend/interested in selling NSP books in their private collection?

  

There are few people selling old Sanskrit books on eBay India, OLX and Quickr but the choice is very limited.

  

Please feel free to write to me off the list if needed.

  

Thanks, NityƒÅnanda
