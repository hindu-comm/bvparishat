Namaste,

  

 I'm not sure if there are exactly408398 words in Sanskrit, the number might be408 397. A new estimate will be available after year 3640 when the Poona dictionary will be finished. It's bigger than the base for my Reverse dictionary which is only about 280 000 words. Is the list of any use? Or would you want to see it devanagari? Would it be welcomed in India as a printed book? The Reverse dictionary will be printed in Moscow in a year from now and it's a deal. But this 400k word varnamala-wise ordered list will remain unpublished, I propose. At least until3640. It's 2014 now.

  

M.G.
