Namaste,

  

I am looking for "manyu sUkta vyAkhya" which was authored by parama pUjya dhIrEndra tIrtha swamiji. His Holiness, a great madhwa scholar, was the muttadhipati of shri rAghavEdra mutt and wrote commentary on "manyu sUkta" from dvaita siddhAnta perspective and identifies the manyu to be narasimha swarupa.

  

I think Dr.VR Panchamukhi published this work but am unable to trace it.

  

Any pointers would be highly appreciated.

  

regs,

sriram
