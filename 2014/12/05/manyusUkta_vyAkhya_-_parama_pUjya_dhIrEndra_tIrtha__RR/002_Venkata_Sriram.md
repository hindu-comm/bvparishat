Namaste,

  

I found the mUla pATa of manyu sUkta vyAkhya by shrI dhIrEndra tIrtha swamiji. There is an e-book called "madhva mantra ratnAkara". I am pasting the link below:

I was taught the sAyaNa bhASya. Generally, "manyu" is the krOdhAbhimAni dEvata but shrI dhIrEndra swamiji explains this word very beautifully as "jnAna rUpatvAt manyu nAmaka nrisimha / manu avabOdhana iti dhAtOH....."

  

The explanation is just wonderful.

  

regs,

sriram
