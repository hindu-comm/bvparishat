Is the press really “closing down” (in the sense of ceasing operations)? Does any news source say so?

From what I know, it is an "indefinite lockout" (*talabandi*) due to a dispute between workers and management over wages. This is different from closing down or ceasing operations. There are reports indicating the lockout may not continue for long.

“अधिकारियों ने कर्मचारियों को समझाने की कोशिश की और प्रबंधन से तालाबंदी खुलवाने का आश्वासन दिया तब जाकर कर्मचारी शांत हुए।”

I hope this will be resolved in some time and the press will resume operations (unless this turns out to be like the Great Bombay Textile Strike of 1980s which completely shut the mills in Mumbai).
