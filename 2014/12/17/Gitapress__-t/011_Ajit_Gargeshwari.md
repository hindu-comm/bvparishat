ASS is still selling and publishing their book as far as NSP is concerned they are closed. NSP books were some of the best books published a full generation of scholars were benefited by the publisher. I hope its a temporary problem with Gita press and they will be back quickly  

I agree with Prof. Bhattacharya Gita Press did a good job to get scriptures to one and all .  
  

Are books published by Bangabasi Press, Calcutta available at archives or DLI Doesone has the list of books they published any information would be useful Thanks
