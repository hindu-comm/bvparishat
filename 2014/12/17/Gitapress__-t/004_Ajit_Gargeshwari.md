What Prof Paturi has suggested is the best way to go about government cannot and may not support religious charitable organization I don't think funding Gita press should be an issue for a charitable trust the question is do they want charity? Its best if members who are more knowledgeable about Gita press writes if they have asked for funding and the reason they are closing their publication division Their website is working and I could not get any information from their website about they are closing down their publication division
