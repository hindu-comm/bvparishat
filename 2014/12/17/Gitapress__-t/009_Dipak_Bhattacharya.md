A problem no doubt. Ours is a poor country. Many poor people, even employees belonging to the class three staff, just literate village women, street vendors, grocers and cobblers benefited from the Gita Press. It is true that the Press did not publish research work, but scholars require the Mahabhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa for reference. The Press served them too. Also one of the best diary books will no more be in the market. The Bangabasi Press, Calcutta that did similar work also ceased to exist long ago. Are the AŚS and N.S.Press still functioning?

They did not depend on the Government, as far as I know. Did the GP depend on the Government? In any case at least I shall miss it.
