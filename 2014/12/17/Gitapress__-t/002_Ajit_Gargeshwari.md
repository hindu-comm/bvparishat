Market dynamics at work.They used to offer their books at low cost or at subsidized price How long can subsidies work? As Government wants to reduce subsidies printers and publishers have to make themselves profitable.  
My personal view. Why should Government dole out private publishers?
Why should tax payers money be given to publishers? I can understand if books which have substantial original research is supported by universities not every religious publication? Please note I have nothing against Gita Press their cause was and is noble indeed!
