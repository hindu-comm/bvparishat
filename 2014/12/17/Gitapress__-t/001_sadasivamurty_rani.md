Really it is shocking news. The service that has been rendered by Gita Press to the Sanskrit world is matchless. What so ever may be the reason for its closing down if Government do something to extend any kind of support to them it may really be good for Sanskrit world too.

The report that the Gita Press is closing down is worrying for readers of religious books.
