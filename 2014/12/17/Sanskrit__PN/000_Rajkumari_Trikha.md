These valuable comments, suggestions and informations, should be forwarded to second Sanskrit commission. I have also tried to find scientific references in the Mbh, and given their parallels in modern sciences, in my book , Mahabharat mein vijnan, darshan aur samaj. I have devoted nearly 160 pages and dealt with pure and applied sciences in this book. I have strong opinion about our scientific heritage. There are a number of books, published by ICPR, on sciences in various books of Sanskrit literature. The skt scholars know our scientific heritage but the problem is that these are never publically propagated. Text books at school level should contain such material. This is important for our Rashtra Samman and character building.
