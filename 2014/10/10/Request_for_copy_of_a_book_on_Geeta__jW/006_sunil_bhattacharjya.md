Khair doubted that there were possibly three authors of the Bhagavad gita. According to him the first six chapters were written by one author and the chapters 7 t0 12 were by the second author and the third author wrote the last six chapters. Has any sanskrit scholar ever found any Style and linguistic differences within the Bhagavad Gita, to arrive at such conclusions or that is only a colonial hiccup?
