The present no. 18 of the chapters is in matching with the other 18s of works considered to be of Vyasa.



Dr. Khair's no.6 , the number of chapters in the original Gita and the number of chapters added by each of the interpolators is in want of an explanation. When the first interpolator added 6 chapters and the second interpolation was not yet done, the number of chapters stood at 12. Is there a significance for this total number of 12 or added number 6 or there was no significance for these numbers, it just so happened that the number of interpolated chapters turned out to be 6? If this number were to be believed to bearbitrary, then why was the number of chapters added by the second interpolator was again 6? Was it just a coincidence that the original number of chapters was 6 and every interpolation adds only exactly 6 chapters, nothing more nothing less ?
