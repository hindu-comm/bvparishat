Namaste  
  

I think 'much need not be done about nothing' in the matter of 'one or many authors' of the Bhagavadgītā. The method of the Vedānta, of which the Gītā is a part, is one of arriving at the 'ekavākyatā. Even though the Upaniṣads are several, their methods are varied and the Rṣis who are associated with them as draṣṭāraḥ are different, yet the Commentators of these have arrived at, realized, a common thread of message running through the entire upaniṣadic literature. The variety in the Rṣis, the method, etc. does not deter one from seeing this common message of their being mokṣaśāstra.  
  

Just as it is so in the upaniṣads, so too, across the prasthānatraya comprising the brahmasūtra-s, the Bhagavadgītā and the Upaniṣads, the Commentators see a common theme of their being a mokṣaśāstra.  
  

For that matter there is difference of opinion about whether it was one Vyāsa or many who authored all the admitted purāṇas and upa-purāṇas.
Even if it were a fact that there are many authors for the puraṇas and the Bhagavadgita, the fact of their being mokṣaśāstra does not get altered. In other words, there is nothing in the extant Gitā that is un-vedāntic or that which does not qualify to be an element of mokṣaśāstra.
