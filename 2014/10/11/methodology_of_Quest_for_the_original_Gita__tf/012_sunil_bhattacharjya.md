Madhusudama saraswati seems to have pointed out that the first six chapters is on "Tvam" or you, the Second six chapters are on "Tat"or that, the ultimate truth, the Brahman (Apara to the dvaitins, Para and Apara to the Vishiashtadvaitin and Para to the Advaitin) and the third set of six chapters are exposition on "Tattvamasi" or you are that.
