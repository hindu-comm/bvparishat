Namaste,  
  

It is not usually realised by people that at the time of the discourse of the Bhagavada Gita Arjuna was 89 years old and that Arjuna has learned all the Veda and Vedanta early in his life. The Pandavas tried their best to avoid the war and even Lord Krishna went as an emissary of the Pandavas to the court of the Kauravas to plead for an amicable understanding and the Pandavas gave up their demand for the Kingdom and settled for demand for only five villages. But all those efforts were in vain and the war became inevitable. At that stage it was Arjuna's duty to stick to the war like a true Kashatriya, but Arjuna faltered after seeing his relatives and that was very much against the Kshatriya dharma. Lord Krishna was trying to remind Arjuna of that. With the circumstances making Lord of the world available to him as the teacher, Arjuna started asking the Lord the varous doubts he had and one thing led to another and that is how the essence of all the Veda and Vedanta were imparted to him by the Lord. Not only Arjuna was benefitted by that, even all of us became the beneficiaries as Vedavyasa versified the conversation between the Lord and Arjuna. The Lord used all the terms needed to be used, including the synonymous ones (so that Arjuna would not be confused), used in the Vedic texts, but unfortunately many of the modern scholars are getting confused by that.  
  

One who has not looked at the aspects outlined above, may feel that the scope of the Bhagavad Gita far exceeded than what was needed to prsuade Arjuna to give up the idea of withdrawing from the war. On top of it many of the modern day scholars have not understood the unifying total message of the Gita. The different Acharya's also looked at the Bhagavad Gita at different levels and that is how they interpreted it differently. Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansha, the great unifier, used to say that the Advaita, the Vishishtadvaita and the Dvaita are all correct and the so-called difference between them is due to the difference of their levels of understanding. Not only the Bhagavad Gita is not a simple text, even the Mahabharata as a whole is not easily understandable and Vedavyasa realized that and became sad for that. At that stage Narada advised Vedavyasa to compose the Bhagavatam so that it would be understandable to all.  
  

If I may add, though Vedavyasa wrote the Mahabharata (including the Khila portion called the Harivamsha) running into 100,000 verses, he did so in three stages, the first one was the Jaya samhita, which he expanded to the Bharata samhita and the Bharata samhita was narrated by Vaishampayana to Janmejaya, in the presence of Vedavyasa, Sauti and others.. The Bharata samhita had the Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses,as told by Vaishampayana in the Gitaman verse (attached). Vedavyasa thereafter expanded the Bharata samhita further and added the Harivamsha and we have the Mahabharata. This Mahabharata was later narrated by Sauti to the sages in the Naimisharanya and we find that the Bhagavad Gita in it has 700 verses. I shall not go into these details here, as that can be treated in a different thread, if the members so wish and the moderatorji permits.
