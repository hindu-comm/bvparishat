Most of the 21 'problems' listed in the beginning of the work do not seem to be problems at all. They are usual features of any book.



1. Changes in terminology

2. Alternative terminology



Is not the use of synonyms quite common?

3. Meaning of the same term differs



Is this too not common in books?



9. Ideal persons described identically for different words for different paths of spiritual practice



This is what the Gita is known for . It treats the different paths different OS's creating the same effect ultimately.



17. Variety of terminology for moksha



Is this also not common in Upanishads and other such sources too.

19. Was the original dialogue in prose or in verse?

How is it possible to be in prose? Verse was the trend of those times.
