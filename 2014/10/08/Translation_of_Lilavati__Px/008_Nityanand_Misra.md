Congratulations to your father and all others involved in the publication. His literary pursuit at the advanced age is inspiring.

  

Is it possible to share the following:



1\) Details like paperback or hardbound (appears to be hardbound as it has a dust jacket), ISBN (if present), number of pages, price (these are must have for any announcement on publication of a book)  

2\) Table of Contents (The subtitle is helpful, but table of contents with page numbers would be even better as one knows which topics are covered at length)

3\) List of appendices (The review says there are many of them)

4\) A sample chapter or some sample pages (Very helpful for prospective buyers, and the publishers usually oblige the authors with sample pages)

  
The cover is well designed. Unfortunately the text on the front and back flaps of the dust jacket has many mistakes (probably due to lack of any proofreading) which I hope will be corrected in future editions.
