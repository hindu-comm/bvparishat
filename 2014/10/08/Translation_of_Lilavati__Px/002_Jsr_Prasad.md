Respected All,  
  

Namaste.  
I do not know, whether any scholar has responded to this post, off-list. Though, I am not aware of any modern maths, being a Sanskrit student, I can understand the significance of this translation. Translating Indian mathematical texts requires great authority. It is evident from the scholarly review by Res. Prof. V. Kannan of University of Hyderabad, who is one of the best mathematicians in India. And the translator, Prof. Padmanabha Rao garu, whom I personally know, is 80+ young and deeply immersed in maths, Sanskrit and astrological studies. I think, the current book published by CIF, should be reviewed in elite journals and institutions should plan to indent copies for library purposes. When Govt. of India, is seriously thinking about including texts of Indian sciences in the educational curriculum, texts like LIlAvatI, gaNitayuktibhAsa etc., should also be considered. Because, this is our own 'indigenous' knowledge. This is my humble opinion.  
  

Regards,  
Prasad
