The review is published in the book itself. I just copied it for the benefit of the scholars.  
  
And yes, I used this forum for informing the scholars about the availability of the book, one may call this an 'advertisement'.  
  

I agree that publishers do take care of the advertisement 'as per their marketing requirements'. But the the author also individually would like to inform the scholars about the availability of the book.  
  

regards,
