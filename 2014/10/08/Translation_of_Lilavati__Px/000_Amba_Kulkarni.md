Dear members,  
  
I am pleased to announce the publication of my father's book on लीलावती (Vol II).  

(Vol I is in press.)  
  

Here is a review by Emirates Professor of Mathematics, Prof. V Kannan of University of Hyderabad:  
  

The present translation of Lilavati( Vol II) by Prof. A B Padmanabha Rao has several merits, when compared with the already available translations. More than just being truthful to the original work, the translation has an in-built component of convincing the reader that there are no deviations. While ample illustrations based on a reliable commentary are provided, heavy intrusion of modern methods in ancient work has been deliberately avoided. This translation will be useful to the large segment of readers whose knowledge of Sanskrit language is limited, and also to the small segment of Sanskrit scholars whose exposure to modern mathematics is limited. The readability of this book ha been enhanced by its clarity, simplicity of style and by numerous appendices.  
  

The book is published by (and can be ordered from)  

  
Chinmaya International Foundation Shodha Sansthan  

Ernakulam, Kerala, India
