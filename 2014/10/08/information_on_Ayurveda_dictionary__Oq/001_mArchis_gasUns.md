Dear Saroja,

  

 I'm no Sanskrit researcher. I'm no Ayurveda researcher as well. But I've got and have worked on gazillion kinds of files / works related to both topics. I wanted to make a word by word translation of the samhitas, to make the technological part easy enough, but I'm stuck as there is no ayurveda doctor by my side to help me on a regular basis.The biggest authority up to date is Josi:

For quick reference first of all I would recommend my edition of<http://ayurvedika.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=397> - the file is attached.

My own compilations of no practical value, but just as a proof of concept:

Ashtanga Hridaya Samhita - PDF File<https://www.dropbox.com/s/dfc2pskbmz48gto/AHS.pdf?dl=0>

Caraka Samhita - PDF File<https://www.dropbox.com/s/jiw1r3imyvznxpz/Carakasamhita.pdf?dl=0>  

Susruta Samhita - PDF File<https://www.dropbox.com/s/0n70ttb7xgo0b85/Susrutasamhita.pdf?dl=0>
