Namaste,

  

 My .xls file attached is extracted from<http://niimh.ap.nic.in/ebooks/e-Nighantu/?mod=read>, as stated in the file. Several mistakes fixed. As they do not reply, I could not fix them on the website as well. Joshi's dictionary link can be obtained on personally contacting me, because of the many downloads the link has expired.

  

M.
