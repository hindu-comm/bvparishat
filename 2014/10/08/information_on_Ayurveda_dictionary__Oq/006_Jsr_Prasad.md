Good job! What is the source of your English translation of the entries? It is helpful too. What criteria is assigned while extracting the entries from the dictionaries? Because, I could see infinitive like 'आदाय' etc., which can be discarded in line with 'आगन्तुकी' and so on. Further, its translation can be 'having taken/obtained' instead of
'collection of drugs'. Nonetheless, it is a useful data that needs a thorough revision by Ayurveda/Sanskrit scholars. If you can still share Joshi's dictionary, please send the link/file to \<[jsrap...@gmail.com]()\>.  
  

Regards,
