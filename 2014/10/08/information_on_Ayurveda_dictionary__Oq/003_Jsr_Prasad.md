Dear Madam,  
  

Supplementary to the information provided by Prof. Aklujkar and Mr. Mārcis, I just want to add the following link -  
<http://niimh.ap.nic.in/ebooks/e-Nighantu/?mod=read> The site developed by NIIMH, Hyderabad has some 4-5 major Ayurveda dictionaries like, *Dhanvantari Kosha, Bhavaprakasha, Raja Nighantu, Kaiyadeva Nighantu* etc., with a search facility. You can also search in Caraka/Sushruta Samhitas over there.  
  
I think, you may encounter some polysemous words in the referred text, which is natural to any Ayurveda related text. I feel, to fulfill this requirement, none of the Ayurvedic dictionaries are considered comprehensive. However, I am yet to see the book of Dr. Joshi (broken link), that has been suggested by Mr. Mārcis.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
