There are no Ayurveda scholars, who are versed in Sanskrit, who are interested in line by line translations of the canonical medical texts. None that I'm aware of.  
  

Yes, it is the pathetic situation that prevails around. Fortunately, here in Andhrapradesh, we know 2-3 scholars who are well versed in both subjects. Recently, we've recorded (audio) the lectures of Prof. Manikya Sharma in Caraka Samhita. They need badly need an editing. I don't know whether someone is really interested in these lectures.
