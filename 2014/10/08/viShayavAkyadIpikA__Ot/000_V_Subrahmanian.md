Namaste  
  

Having informed about an old publication by Chowkhamba by the above name which is a list of the विषयवाक्यानि of the adhikaraṇas of the Brahmasutra bhāṣya of Shankaracharya (authored/compiled by a yati), I tried a search and only got a result that is not related to my search:  
  

### [p.281-2. A Supplementary Catalogue of Sanskrit, Pali and **...**](http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Catalogue_of_Sanskrit_and_Pali_Books_in_the_British_Museum_1000046582/281)

[www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Catalogue_of.../281](http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Catalogue_of.../281)

\[*Vishaya*- *vakyadipika*. A treatise upon the scriptural passages quoted in the Sribhashya.\] \[1899.\]   
  

I request any member who knows about the publication to share the details of availability.  
  

If any other work which lists the viṣaya vākya-s of the various adhikaraṇas (as per the Advaita tradition), that information also is welcome. No doubt the 'वैयासिकन्यायमालाविस्तरः’ by Swami Vidyaranya deals with this topic but what I am looking for is a readily available list of those vākyas.  
  

The structure of each adhikaraṇa is that an upaniṣadic sentence is taken up for consideration and the samśaya stated followed by the pūrvapakṣa with reason and the siddhānta is finally stated with reason.   

  

Thanks and warn regards
