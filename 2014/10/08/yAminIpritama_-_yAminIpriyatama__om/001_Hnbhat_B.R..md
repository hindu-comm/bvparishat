We can understand yAminIpriyatama could mean the moon, unless the word demands otherwise in the context as an epithet of moon.

  

yAminIpritama by itself doesn't mean anything, but adding the missing letter, \[ya\] would mean the same.  

  

The second I could not make any sense.

The context decides the meaning unless the soruce given in the dictionary.

The same as above. slp1 makes the reading difficult. If it could be put in HK or devanatari or IAST it would be easier.
