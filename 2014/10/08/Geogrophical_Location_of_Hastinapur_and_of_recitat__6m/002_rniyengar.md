Hastinapura is one of the famous MBh sites. B.B Lal ex-DG of ASI conducted excavations at some of the MBh sites. His original report is:

  

B.B.Lal, Excavation at Hastināpura and other Explorations in the Upper Gangā and Sutlej Basins. 1950-52. Ancient India, Bull. Arch. Survey of Ind. No.10 &11, pp5-151.

This Hastinapura (archaeological site) is on the banks of Ganga. About 50 KM north along Ganga is a place called Shukrataal. Most probably this was originally known as "S'ukataal". Both sites can be seen on Google map.

Thanks
