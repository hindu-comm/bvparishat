Dāmodara Dāsa Ji

  

Before we look at the commentary of Jīva Gosvāmī, it may be noted that the explanation of the complex compound **lasacchrītulasīvimiśrakṛṣṇāṅ‌ghrireṇvabhyadhikāmbunetrī** in the Kramasandarbhaḥ of Jīva Gosvāmī is very similar to that in the Bhāvārthadīpikāprakāśaḥ of Vaṁśīdhara.

  

You may compare the two commentaries here

Now coming to Bhāgavatam 1.19.6. To me, it does not appear that the Kramasandarbhaḥ says, as you claim, that Parīkṣita sat on the banks of Yamunā.

  

The Kramasandarbhaḥ clearly says that it was the river Gaṅgā -

  

**jalapravāharūpā gaṅgā hyatra voḍhrī**

*Verily, here the Gaṅgā in the form of flowing water is the carrier.*

  

What Kramasandarbhaḥ does say, is that **lasacchrītulasīvimiśrakṛṣṇāṅ‌ghrireṇvabhyadhikāmbu** refers to the waters of Yamunā, and the **netrī** (carrier) of the waters of Yamunā is Gaṅgā. But how can Gaṅgā carries the waters of Yamunā - are they not different? As an explanation, the Kramasandarbhaḥ gives the citation from Ādivārāhapurāṇa (which says Gaṅgā herself, 100 times purified, is Yamunā), and adds the following at the end:

**abhede hi tādṛgamburūpe ityevāvakṣyat iti**

*The forms of such waters (of Yamunā and Gaṅgā) are identical.*

  

If one reads the explanation of **lasacchrītulasīvimiśrakṛṣṇāṅ‌ghrireṇvabhyadhikāmbunetrī** by Vaṁśīdhara, it is almost identical, except thatVaṁśīdharaexplicitly states that theriver is Gaṅgā (śrīgaṇgāyām) and the pilgrimage is on the banks of the Gaṅgā (tīrthastu gaṅgāyāmeva).  

  

If a Sanskrit commentary on or a word-by-word translation of Bhāvārthadīpikāprakāśaḥ/Kramasandarbhaḥ on 1.19.6 is available, it might help us undertstand Vaṁśīdhara/Jīva Gosvāmī better.

  

PS: Prabhupāda himself mentions both Gaṅgā and Yamunā in the translations and purports of 1.19.5 to 1.19.7.
