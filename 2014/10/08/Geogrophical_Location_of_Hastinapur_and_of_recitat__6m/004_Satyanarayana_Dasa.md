If you read Mahabharata it is clear that Hastinapura is not on the bank of Yamuna. King Santanu met Ganga Devi on the bank of river.Ganga. Hastinapur is supposed to be near Meerut between Delhi and Haridwar. There is a village called Daurali, between Meerut and Haridvara, and Hastinapur remnants are very close to it. Sukatal is not far from there, near Mujjafarnagar.

It was Indraprastha that was on the bank of Yamuna. The present site of Delhi is supposed to be Indraprastha. There is old fort in Delhi that people believe to be the remnants of Pandava's fort and that area is called Indraprastha.
