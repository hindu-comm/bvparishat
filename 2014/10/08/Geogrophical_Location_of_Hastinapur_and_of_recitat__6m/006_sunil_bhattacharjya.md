Namaste,  
  

As regards the river Ganga being a carrier, it probably implies that the river Yamuna is the tributary of Ganga and that is why after the Sangam at Prayag the river Yamuna loses its identity and the river thereafter is known as Ganga. In the same way a stream of the river Saraswati meets its carrier Yamuna near Paonta sahib and thereafter the river continues to flow as Yamuna till it falls in Ganga at Prayag.  
  

As regards the shifting of the capital from Hastinapur to Kaushmbi (as Hastinapur became uninhabitable due to flooding Ganga), it was at the time of the 7t descendentd of Arjna. Megasthenes mentions that the ancient practice in India had been to make wooden palaces near the riverside and the brick ones were made only in places far removed from the riverside. That is why one does not get any remnants of the palaces of the Kuru-Pandavas on the banks of Ganga but the remnants of the palaces made by Parikshit and his descendents are reported to be there in Pandav Lar'rey in Kashmir. There is mention in the Rajatarangini that Kuru-Pandavas ruled Kashmir for many centuries.
