Namaste  
  

After sending the following request, as a later thought, I remembered some usages as follows:  
  

वैष्णवी माया, वैष्णवं वचनम्, वैष्णवः सम्प्रदायः, etc.  
  

शैवी चिन्ता, शैवं मतम्, etc.  
  

कैशवी वाक् (केशवेनोक्ता वाक्) (Is this usage correct?)  

  

ब्राह्मी सृष्टिः, ब्राह्मं कल्पम् (द्वितीया),, ब्राह्मं पुरम्, etc.  
  

I think such adjectival forms can be arrived at only by taking the taddhita forms of those words.  
  

Scholars may pl. give their opinions on these and my original question contained in the first post.  
  

warm regards
