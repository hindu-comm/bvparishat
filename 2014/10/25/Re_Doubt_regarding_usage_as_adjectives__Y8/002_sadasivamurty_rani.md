Inter-convertibility of different parts of speech seems possible in all civilized languages. In this process :

A verb can be derived from a Noun/Adjective/Conjunction or so.

For instance if English is taken:

Father (Noun) . He fathered two children. (Here fathered is a derivative verb). City (Noun) . It citied six lakh population. (Here citied is a derivative verb)

If (Conditional Conjunction) - His arrival is iffy. (here iffy is an adjective derived from iffy)

A noun can be derived from a Noun/Verb/Adjective and so on.

An Adjective can be derived from a Noun/Verb/Another Adjective/Pronoun etc.,

This type of inter-convertibility of parts of speech is possible in Sanskrit also.

In this process one needs to coin Pratipadakam

(In case of deriving a Subanta for obtaining a Noun or Adjective)

and a Dhatu is to be derived to get a Verb form (which is normally called NAMADHATU). कृष्ण्याते इति कृष्ण इति विशेषणप्रातिपदिकात्

For the purpose of deriving the Pratipadikam from verbal roots Krt Pratyas are used.

For the purpose of deriving the Pratipadikam from other pratipadikams Taddhita Pratyayas are used.(अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्यय: प्रातिपदिकम्। कृत्तद्धितसमासाश्च) इति प्रातिपदिकत्वसम्पादन/निष्पादनार्थम् सूत्रद्वयं स्मरणीयम्)

Hence we get

भावत्कम् इत् "भवत्"इति प्रातिपदिकात्।

राघव इति "रघु" इति प्रातिपदिकात्

कृत:, दृष्ट:,लालित: इत्यादि कृदन्तरूपाणि च अत्रोदाह्रियन्ते।

In this manner Nouns/Adjectives can be derived from any other nouns or adjectives as demanded in the context of the present context. But the OPTION OF THE USER GOVERNS ALL SUCH COININGS.
