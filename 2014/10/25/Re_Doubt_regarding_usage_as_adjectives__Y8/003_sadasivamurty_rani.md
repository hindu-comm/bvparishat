In previous mail Please allow the following corrections:

1.here iffy is an adjective derived from iffy in place of this please read: "Here iffy is an adjective derived from IF."

1\. Please readकृष्णायते in place ofकृष्ण्याते

There is a problem with my PC. While I type one thing it is allowing something else to be seen on the screen. The problem is with my Keyboard and also some software problem too.

Warm Regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
