You can find many adjective usages, and each need not be analyzed at length. I think you have not read the earlier postings.

  

Any adjective can be used if context requires it as the subject of the verb, depending on the usage. All the words denoting गुण-s could be used as the demand requires:

  

शुक्लः पटः, शुक्लः वर्णः - रुपभेदः the same used as adjective and noun denoting the colour whiteness. The same with other words denoting colour: रूपं सप्तविधं शुक्लनीलपीतरक्तहरितकपिशचित्रभेदात्।।

  

"गुणाः शुक्लादयः पुंसि गुणिलिङ्गास्तु तद्वति।" इति इत्यमरः।

  

All the others कृत्, तद्धित, समास words are used as adjectives if the demands in the context, except तत्पुरुष and nouns also if the context demands. All the words you quoted could be easily identified as the adjectives and none as noun in the context.

  

Generally the gender of the adjectives is dependent on the noun it qualifies. This is a too general to need any analysiz of the words grammatically and could be easily identified from the context, even if the noun is far removed from the adjectives, in verses."यल्लिङ्गं यद्वचनम् या च विभक्तिर्विशेषस्य । तल्लिङ्गं तद्वचनं सा च विभक्तिर्विशेषणस्यापि ।" is the general rule to identify the विशेषण-s for a noun in a verse or in prose, whether they be तद्धित, कृदन्त or समास. ""अभिधानलक्षणा हि कृत्तद्धितसमासाः" इति लक्ष्यानुसारेण लक्षणानि नेयानि।

  

Identifying the कर्तृ, कर्म, क्रियापद is the basic exercise of learning Sanskrit by the above two principes and the adjectives of both कर्तृ and कर्म, by their विभक्ति in any sentence.
