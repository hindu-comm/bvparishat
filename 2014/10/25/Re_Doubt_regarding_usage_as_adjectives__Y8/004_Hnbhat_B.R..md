As already explained by Sri Sadashiva Murthy, it depends on the usage. Though generally all the nouns could be derived from any verb, and all the nouns could be called as participles, and as such adjectives, the usage decides, which could be used as nouns and which are used as adjectives, and which could be use as both. Yoga, Yaugika, Yogarudha, Yaugikarudha is the classification by following maxim "योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी" in general usage of the words. The diffeerence between the participles used as nouns, and some as adjectives only in the general usage (I say general usage) is just following the maxim.

  

For example the word पितृ derived from पा रक्षणे, पातीति पिता is generally used in the sense of father, the one who has fathered the child. जनयितृ. 

  

प्रजानां विनयाधानाद्रक्षणाभ्दरणादपि ।

स पिता पितरस्तासां केवलं जन्महेतवः ॥  

  

The above verse it is used to denote पिता, - पालकः, in the poetic usage because of the context. Otherwise, it is not used in the sense of a पालक or an adjective, रक्षकः.

  

The word जनकः is synonym of पिता is used participle as in जन्य-जनक-भावः, and as noun as the synonym of father denoting पिता who has produced and also as a name:

  

राजा प्रजापतिसमो जनकः पिता ते

  

in the general sense father, but without producing Sita and devoid of the derivative sense and Janaka used as noun only in the above verse.

  

So context demands the interpretation, following the general maxim योगाद् रूढिर्बलीयसी.

  

Just like पङ्कज which is used as synonym for lotus, and not for lily which is also born in water nor any other thing born thing in water, as adjective. Yet the meaning is intended born in mud.

  

In other cases, कुशल etc. though derivation could be given as कुशान् लातीति, one who bring कुश grass, but it is used in the above sense, in usage and simply used to mean exellent, expert etc. as adjective only. If context demands, it can be used as a noun.

  

Theree are many other usages like this. Hope in the recent message, Dr.Murthy has brought in more examples. the general guiding princile is to widen your reading experience and recognize such words.
