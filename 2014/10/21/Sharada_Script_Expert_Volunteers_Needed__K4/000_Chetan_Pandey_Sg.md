Dear All:

  

On behalf of the eGangotri Project, I would like to invite Sharada Experts who would like to take part in my Sharada Manuscript Digitization Efforts.

  

We have been very kindly granted access to Three Libraries ( +1 , a second Library of the Same Institution ) to digitize there Sharada Collection. One of the Library has around 5000 Manuscripts.

  

All Work is done at No Cost to the Donor Organization and no Funding is Recieved to execute this Project.

  

Hence we are crowd-sourcing the Quality Assurance Part of the Project and No Monetary Remuneration will be possible.

  

All Digitized Manuscripts will be made available immediately on the Net - with No Conditions whatsoever.

  

The Few Manuscripts we have digitized since Last Week are avaialble for viewing in there Crude, unedited Form.

Due to Deepawali, Digitization has been halted and will resume after Monday.

  

We would expect Volunteers to identify Missing Pages and Cut Pages only and Identify the Title and Author of the Text. All volunteering can be done with access to a laptop and a decent internet Connection. Does not require tavel of any Kind.

  

Sharada Experts based in Chandigarh can get access to a Dedicated Computer and Internet inside the Premises of an Organization volunteering there Resources for this purpose - including a possbile salaried job ( but dont expect anything much ).
