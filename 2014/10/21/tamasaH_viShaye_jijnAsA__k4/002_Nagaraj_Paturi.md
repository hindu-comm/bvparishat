Dear Sri Vishvanath,



It is good that you picked up a good question.



तमस् is one of the greatest philosophical issues, issues of scientific enquiry both in the modern international scene and ancient Indian scene.



तमस् as darkness is the original concept. तमस् as one of the guNas etc. are its लाक्षणिक (metaphorical )extensions.



Before you delve into the ideas of तमस् in the Veda mantras, Upanishads etc. , it may be helpful to study modern theories of light, color, blackbody etc.



In mantras like



वेदाहमेतं पुरुषं महान्तं आदित्यवर्णं तमसः परस्तात् . तमेवं विद्वानभृत इह भवति नान्यःपन्थाविद्यतेऽयनाय



वेदाहमेतं पुरुषं महानतम् **आदित्यवर्णं तमसः परस्तात्** । तमेव विदित्वा अति मृत्युमेति नान्यः पन्था विद्यते अयनाय



or



in Slokas like



कवि पुराणमनुशासिता रमणोरणीयांसमनुस्मरेद्यः। सर्वस्य धातारमचिन्त्यरुपम् **आदित्यवर्णं तमसः परस्तात्**।



तमस् has to be understood at several levels.



The idea of छाया, and its relation to तमस् , छाया being a wife of the Sun , Saturn being the son of the Sun and छाया are all to be studied.



इंद्रवृत्रासुरकथा can also be interpreted in terms of light, darkness, diseasesborn of darkness etc.



I heard from Chivukula Sri Rama Prabhu retired Director General of NIC that they created an alloy with the help of a descriptionin Bharadvaja Vimana Shastra. It was called तमोयंत्रः. I found this on <http://www.human-resonance.org/vimana.html>



Dr. C.S.R. Prabhu has documented several of these rediscovered alloys in his paper 'Ancient Indian Metallurgy':

            
     Tamogarbha Loha: Already produced in the laboratory, light in weight, black in color,
    found to be resistant to acids. Displayed high level of absorption for laser
    light... This alloy was used in 'Tamo Yantra' in the Vimana Shastra for the purposes
    of absorption of light escaping from a photochemical reaction... thereby
    generating darkness.

    This indicates ideas of creating darkness artificially too.
