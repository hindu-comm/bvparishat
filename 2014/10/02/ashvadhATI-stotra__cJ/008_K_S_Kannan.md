I could not figure out whether a well edited version of the text in Devanagari of the stuti was located or not.

  

I can suggest one :  

Ref. pp.390-391, entitled ambAs"Takam  

(exactly eight verses) in the book :  

Minor Works of Sri Sankaracarya,  

edited by Bhagavat HR,  

pub:1952 (2nd edition), Oriental Book Agency, Poona (Total pages 584 + 8).
