Dear Meera H.R.  
  

I don't think any one is taking away any credit from any of the posters to a mail. As mails get clubbed in a thread all posts posted on a given subject line is known to all. A particular post may be of greater interest than another post on the same thread to a particular poster. This doesn't mean previous posters posts were not acknowledged All posts by scholars and members are acknowledged.. Please note some receive mails as a digest format and some receive all mails and some prefer to view mails on line so it may not be possible to top posts with acknowledgement without careful addition to the relevant posts.
