Mishra Sir, Namaste  

I am doing that job. A little time needed.  
And that site has much material done by volunteers.  
Owner is not responsible for that.  
I understand your pain. Even I share it at same level.  
But we all do understand limitations of regional languages. (where even standard dictionaries are not saved!!)  
Desiraju Hanumantha Rao was a Telugu person. He did work that you see on [valmikiramayan.net](http://valmikiramayan.net).. and also worked on gIta govindam. Only one of its kind..! Good, in fact great attempt. But all words broken non-Samskrt wise..!! He concentrates more on meaning for lay persons. I am working on that as well.  

I think, they did what they could. Let us volunteer to make things better. I am sparing some of my time in that. :)  

Please see my 3 requests - that include help for standard Samskrt word-breaking as well.  

Now that I got some translation help, let me attempt at it.  

Thankyou for the links- let me see them and come back.  

-vinItA  

Usha.
