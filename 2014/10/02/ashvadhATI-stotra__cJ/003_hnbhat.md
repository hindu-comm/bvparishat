Here is another rendering of the same by Nitya Santoshini, a popular singer in an album of Stotra-s on Devi:

I had shared long ago it in another V-Bulletin forum. For another Stotra in the same metre, you can check this V-Bulletin becoming a member of the forum:

or this thread:

or you can download directly, if you don't want to become a member in that gruoup:

It is a forum I had been a member since a long time, sharing music and sanskrit devotionals. The Stora in this link is by Vidyabhushana, a swamiji with a enchanting melogious voice:

  

04 DashavatharaSthuti - Sri Vidyabhushana. Llyrics composed by Vadiraha swamy of Madhva muth.  

  

  

With regards and Best wishes for Navarathri,
