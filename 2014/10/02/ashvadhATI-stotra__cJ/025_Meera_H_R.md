Respected Prof. Sadashivamurthy Rani-ji,

  

I apologise if my comment sounded harsh. It was not intended to give anyone even the slightest offence.

  

I went purely on the basis of the chronology of the mail-chain : none of the over half-a-dozen prior postings betrayed any clear knowledge of the exact title/author/authentic publisher.

  

You needn't have given such a detailed explanation, Sir - I am deeply embarrassed that my comments occasioned such a response from a scholar like you. I personally have a very high regard for your scholarship as well as your integrity.

  

I was concerned only about the possibility of a trend that may arise of not giving due credits, even if unintentionally. While most of the scholars are generally careful in their acknowledgements, a few may take advantage of an unwitting/inadvertent bad precedent.

  

I hope nobody mistakes my well-intentioned comment. It was not against anyone in particular, least of all, your good self, Sir. I hope you accept my apologies.  

  

Namamsi.

Meera

  

P.S: Dear Sri.Ajit, your explanation was very fair. Thank you.
