My interest arose in the book to see if it has a better edited version of the Stotra.  
  
<https://archive.org/stream/014703mbp#page/n8/mode/1up>  
  
The book attributes the Stotra to Kalidasa?? Is it so? Are there any reliable sources which say this Stotra is a work of Kalidasa? If not, then it is most likely written by somebody else much later and then claimed as written by Kalidasa.

The original text in the book is better than the version on Sanskrit documents, but the editing here is also far from professional. No respect for compounds in Sanskrit is disappointing for any reader. My knowledge of Telugu script is rusty, but I did not proceed beyond the first line of the original text when I got to this -  
  
చేటీ భవ న్నినిఖిల ఖేటీ కదంబ వన??  
चेटी भव न्निखिल खेटी कदम्ब वन??  
  
Would be great if somebody can point to a version which is properly edited and without mistakes.  
  
  
  
Kalidasa (if he indeed is the composer of the Stotra)
