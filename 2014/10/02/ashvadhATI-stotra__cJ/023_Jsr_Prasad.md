Dear Ms. Usha,  
  

Rights of some of their old books have been sold out to a Rajahmandry publisher, as I heard. But not sure. Apart from this, Vavilla Press has started to publish a few books with ISBN, with revived printing techniques. For example, Jus. Alladi Kuppuswami's 'Mahabharata' in 2010. I think, Prof. Murthy garu has already provided you with required details on stotra books.  
  

Even, [www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org) has uploaded only a few books (5-6) of Vavilla Press.  
  

Thanks,  

Prasad
