Vidwan Nityanand ji,  
  

Namaste.

I really appreciate your interest in seeing strict grammatical behavior of Sanskrit, in all concerned things. Vavilla Press, Chennai has rendered yeomen service to Telugu community by publishing numerous Sanskrit books in Telugu script. I wonder, you may not believe that, even, some of their editions of transliterated Sanskrit books do not show any respect for 'compounds'. For instance, in one of their texts published in 1933, '...दुःख मनुभवतांपञ्चमहाभूत,' 'गृहान्तरेच' etc., are examples of bad euphonic combination/disjunction of (compound) words. I assume that a Telugu speaker unaware of Devanagari script prefers to read a transliterated Sanskrit text, that is printed in typical Telugu conventional style. Person who knows Devanagari, prefers to read a Sanskrit text in that very script itself, than going for a transliterated version. However, we need an accurate version, at least in Sanskrit.

I think, the above *chandas* has a particular rhythm as it can be musically tuned. It is observed that Carnatic classical singers take liberty in making bad euphonic/compound disjunctions to render a lyric to fit in to certain *raaga.* I could only wish that the print media (especially daily Telugu news papers) would not improvise further to disjunct *vibhakti-pratyayas* of PoS :)
