No offence to the encoder/proofreader, but the version above is a *marvel of editorial ineptitude.* It is full of mistakes and excruciating to read (to say the least) - use of ळ instead of ल throughout, no respect for compounds, etc - it uses शैला अधिराज तनया?? instead of शैलाधिराजतनया (Kalidasa has used the word शैलाधिराजतनया: शैलाधिराजतनया न ययौ न तस्थौ, कुमारे ५-८५). The impression one would get from this page is that it is a Prakrit Stotra and not a Sanskrit Stotra. Somebody please request the website owners to have it edited which is badly needed.
