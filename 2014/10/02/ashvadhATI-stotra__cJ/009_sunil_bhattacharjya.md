Nityanandaji,  
  

There is another Dashasloki called "Shayamala dandakam" by Kalidasa. Could it be that the"Shyamala Dandakam" was by Kalidasa-II, the writer of three kavyas of the 1st century BCE and the "Aswaghati" was either by Kalidasa-I, the writer of the Abhijnana Shakuntalam or by Kalidasa-III, the writer of the Ritusamhara.
