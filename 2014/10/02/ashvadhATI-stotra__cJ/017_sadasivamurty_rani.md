Chy. Usha,

I am happy that the texts mailed by me could be of some use in your pursuit. 

As found in all the available sources it is popularly known as AMBAASHTAKAM only. Since it is composed in Ashvadhati Vrtta ASHVADHAATI STUTI also can be considered as in case of Siva Bhujangaprayata Stotra, Ganesha Bhujangaprayata Stotra and so on.

  

Regarding the stotras in Telugu script You can rely up on two sources:

1\. Bala Sarsvathi Book Depot, Karnool. They are popular publishers for all kinds of Stotra, Kalpa and Purana Texts. They got rights from Vavilla Press to reprint and publish all stotra sahityam in the name of Bala sarasvathi Book Depot.

Particular they published **;Brhat Stotra Ratnakaram** in Three Volumes : Part I Devi Stotrams Part 2 Vishnu Stotrams Part3 Siva Stotrams. Each of these three volumes is of more than 600 pages giving all kinds of Stotras pertaining to these three Deities. This is really a treasure house of stotrams.

Blessings and Best wishes,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
