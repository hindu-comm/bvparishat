Namaste

Murty sir, THANKYOU so much for your help.. otherwise stotra would have waited longer time.. I had to look hard into that Telugu book.. for meaning and other issue-resolving. You made my job easier sir. Please accept my hearty praNAms for that.

  

This is the stotra (Docx. file attached)- proof read twice.

Please excuse me if anything remains in spite of that.

Ambashtakam from Sankara Bhakti stotrani -- has been taken as source.

I thought one is enough. If others are also needed to be looked into and compared, please let me know.

The anusvaras are left as they are in the source text because, it is easy to read, and we have seen lately that it is not that non-Samskrtam as I thought it was..! And this makes stotra easy to be read.

Please tell me what the stotra should be named - अम्बाष्टकम्, अश्वधाटीस्तुतिः? or anything else?

  

I agree with Sivasenani sir in his points. Thanks to all elders for guidance on this on and off post.

  

I will also send a copy to the site people, once it is approved here. Please let me know if any issues are there.

I pray to that karuNAmayI devI bless us all. Now we can sing in her praise in good standard Samskrtam without grammatical mistakes. :)
