Namaste

With due respect and thanks to all members who participated in this discussion,

HN Bhat sir, Mishra sir, Murty sir, Prasad sir, Kannan sir, Sunil sir, Sivasenani sir, Ajit sir, and Meera (sorry for the missed acknowledgement which was really due my side)-

I would like to ask if the stotra which is attached needs any corrections at all or can it be sent to the site?

For convenience of reference, same file is attached again.

Thankyou
