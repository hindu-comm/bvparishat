Sir, Do not know how to Thank you. I can only mention it.

The work is very beautiful with Word to Word Meaning as well. A very detailed commentary indeed. Now I can also find solution to the second issue- Samskrt grammatical wording. Thanks to Shri Mohan Rao sir.

My grand mother's voice often lingered in my ears, but never knew lyrics of that stotra. Did not even know if it was a stotra or some song. So could not ask anyone by just telling them tune. Because of its popularity among Telugu people, a scholar happened to mention and explain it on a TV show- with objective (keeping in view non-Samskrt audience) that- "People often think only English songs and poetry has rhythm. But see this work.. such a beautiful rhythm!"

And then on searching, I got this.

Now I am blessed to have this commentary in my own mother tongue.

Thanks again.
