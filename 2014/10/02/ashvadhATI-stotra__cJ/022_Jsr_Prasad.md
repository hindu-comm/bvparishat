Namaste Senani garu,  
  

I said it briefly about the Telugu convention of writing Sanskrit words. You have, further, wonderfully exposed the intricacies involved in such a behavior. It is rational too. You tried to give examples ranging from scribal errors in palm leaf manuscripts to written convention of upadhmAnIya and jihvAmUlya to Vaidika svaras with a correlation to QWERTY layout in type writers. You'd also rightly said that \<"The question of asadhutva does not arise because rules (of Siksha and Vyakaranam) are for the spoken language".>. In such a situation, one cannot adjudge whether an vernacular edition is professional or far from professional.  
  

Regards,  
Prasad
