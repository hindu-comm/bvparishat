Respected Scholars,

  

I have been following the mail chain about this stotra. I have a humble suggestion.

  

I think it would be a healthy practice to give credits where due. Till Prof. K S Kannan pointed out the **correct title** (as Ambashtakam) and the **author** as Shankaracharya (and an **authentic edition** as from Oriental Book Agency, Poona), none in the chain spoke of these details. The gratitude expressed only go out to the other, later, contributors to the mail chain (who provided additional details *based on* this info first provided).

  

As many budding scholars subscribe to this list, it would set a healthy precedent and a good practice to acknowledge the first information providers, as well as those who add further details. This will inculcate an intellectual honesty and a sense of propriety in the young scholars.

  

I felt like drawing your attention to this, since I have noticed similar lapse once or twice earlier as well.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

  

Namamsi.

Meera
