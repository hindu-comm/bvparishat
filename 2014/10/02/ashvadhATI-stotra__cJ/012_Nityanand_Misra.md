Thanks Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murthy Ji.  
  
After going through your sources, this \[so-called\] Daśaślokī Stuti attributed to Kālidāsa by Sh. Donepudi Venkayya has eight verses which are exactly the same as the eight verses of the Ambāṣṭakam attributed to Śrī Śankarācārya in publications like Bṛhatstotraratnākaraḥ. If majority of the sources do attribute this to Ādya Śankarācārya, it might be worthwhile to check with Sh. Donepudi Venkayya what internal or external evidence led him to attribute this to Kālidāsa. It might be the case that it was authored by neither Kālidāsa nor Ādya Śankarācārya.  
  
Whoever the author is, the two publications from Varanasi and Poona are very well edited and do not have the numerous mistakes of spelling and compounds that the Sanskrit Document versions has. The only "mistakes" I can think of are the uses of Anusvāra in place of the Pañcamavarṇa conjuncts at places like गंध, कदंब etc.  
  
At least Ms. Usha Sanka's job is now much easier (for eight verses that is), she needs to just look at the version in the Varanasi/Poona publication and make the changes.
