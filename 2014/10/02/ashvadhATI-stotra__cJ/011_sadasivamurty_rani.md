Ashvadhati Stotra - Some observations

This stotra on Devi Jagadamba composed in Ashvadhaati metre is popularly known as AMBAASHTAKAM.

In all the available sources this mentioned as a stotra written by Sri Shankaracharaya only. May it be by the Adi Shankara or some other Sankaracharya. But this is a popular stotram in Sankara tradition.

Please find the following three attachments in which the extracts of AMBAASHTAKAM from different sources are attached.

1\. In Telugu script taken from the Brhat Stotra Ratnakara Part I (Devi Stotrani) published by Balasaraswati Book Dipot Karnool who are popular publishers of hundreds of volumes of Stotra Literature and Vrata kalpams in Telugu Script.

2\. In Devanagari Script from the Brhat Stotra Ratnakara Part II published by Chokhamba Vidya Bhavan, Varanasi

3\. Bhakti Stotras part of Sri Sankara's Minor works published by Oriental Book Agency, Poona in the year1938.

4\. An Audio version of this also is attached here for the appreciation of the scholars. This audio version was produced under my supervision in the year 2002 in an album named "Devi Dasavatara Stotra Tarangini".

I hope this attached material may be useful in the present context.

With Warm Regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
