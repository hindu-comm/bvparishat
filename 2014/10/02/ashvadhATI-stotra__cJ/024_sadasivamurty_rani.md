Respected Meera Ji!

Namaste!

At the outset I should express my sincere thanks to Sri Ajit ji for extending an excellent support to the members participated in the discussion on this Aswadhati Stuti.

In fact after the statements from Sri Ajit ji there is no need of adding any further words by a member like me. But Meera Ji's comments are causing such a humiliation in me to respond in this situation. I request Meera Ji to pay attention to the following words of mine.

1\. I personally have high regard for Prof. KS Kannan ji and Kannan Ji also knows well who Rani Sadasiva Murty is.

2\. The posting of Prof. KS Kannan ji hasn't under any circumstances inspired Rani Sadasiva Murty to steal the due credits to that professor or to post Sadasiva Murty's thoughts on Ambashtakam. The precedence of Prof. Kannan Ji's posting and the successive status of my postings is just an accidental coincidence.

3\. Moreover While Kannan ji mentioned only Oriental Book Agency I gave reference to two other sources more in my mail.

4\. One proof which I present here may help you Meeraji to be convinced in this context. **Along with the text files I uploaded I have uploaded an audio file also in my morning posting. That audio file of Ambashtakam was recorded in the year 2002. I was the MUSIC COMPOSER of that album on DEVI LALITAMBIKA.**

**By the time I composed music to AMBASHTAKAM in 2002 I was not known to Prof. Kannan Ji and I too didn't know him.**

**So I humbly request MEERA Ji to think of to what extent Sadasiva Murty deserves to be the object of such vehement comments.**

**With Warm Regards,**

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
