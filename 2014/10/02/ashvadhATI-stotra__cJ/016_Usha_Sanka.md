Prasad sir, Namaste

Rightly pointed out.

Yes, indeed, Vavilla Press books are really great. Are they publishing now? I do not exactly remember seeing any new books of theirs.

Could you please let me know if any stotra book is there under their publications? I tried for scanned books on stotras in DLI.. could not find any thing relevant. And if possible, please let me know if any stotra books of standard publications are there *along with meanings?*

I am interested for Telugu script, because it will be useful for non-Devanagari-knowers in my in-circles.

Thankyou in advance
