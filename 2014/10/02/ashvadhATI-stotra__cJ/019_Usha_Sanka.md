Oh, Thankyou sir for the info. on books.

I can get them now.

*"rights from Vavilla Press to reprint and publish"  
*

Does that mean Vavilla are no more publishing books (on stotras or otherwise subjects)?  

*"I am happy that the texts mailed by me could be of some use in your pursuit."  
*

You sent so many sources, for the same stotra, that someone could actually write a research paper on the stotra. :)
