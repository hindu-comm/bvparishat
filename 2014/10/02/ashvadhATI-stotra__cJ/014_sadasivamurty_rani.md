Thank you NItyanand Ji...for your lightening speed of observation and response. Yes...As as you observed the use of Anusvara instead of Varga Panchamakshara is a frequently occurred mistake.

Here also I would like add some of my observations for the occurrence of mistakes of this kind.

1. In most of the manuscripts of a century and half span back it can be observed that the scribes very often usued Anusvara instead of Varga Panchamakshara. I have some Sanskrit Manuscripts on Music, Dance and Mantra Sastra in my personal collection. There I have scene this type of occurrence very often.

2. In most of the manuscripts I have scene the split of compounds in the middle also is often seen.

The main reason for this may be the knowledge limits of the scribes of those times just as that of the DTP operators of present day and letter composers in old printing presses.

Regards,
