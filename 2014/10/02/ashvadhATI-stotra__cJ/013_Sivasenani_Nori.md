Sir

  

Namaste.

  

If I be allowed to speculate, the reason for what appears today as "arbitrary" space in the middle of compound words in Telugu print (this feature is common for words in both Sanskrit and Telugu) might be the difficulty of printing Telugu ligatures, especially the samyuktaaksharas, in the early days of printing technology where each page was composed by putting together each letter by hand.Ideally each letter must occupy a fixed width, but this is always not possible, so there might be the need to use two "standard-widths" to represent one akshara. It is difficult to control seemingly empty spaces in this kind of situation eventually leading to a situation where space is inserted as per convenience. Even in Roman, we see the difference in space occupied by "i" and "m" if we allot fixed width for each character. There are certain fonts like Courier New where this is possible. When we use such fonts, the text looks like it were typed on a typewriter, like the first sentence in this paragraph (if the email is seen with text formatting and not as plain text). Therein, the space around "i" in the word "arbitrary" above is so much more than the one between "m" and "m" in "common". If we had a letter like "rtsny" in English, obviously the space meant for one letter would not be sufficient and it would have to spill over.

  

There are other features which support this line of reasoning. Some Telugu presses, when they printed Sanskrit texts, consistently used the maatras of short "e" and short "o" in place of the correct longer "e" and "o". I remember one discussion I had with SalakshaNa- GhanapaaThee Srimaan Pandurangacharyulu garu about one edition of Krishnayajurveda printed by GomaTham, Mysore (which is sought after because it has very few printing mistakes). This edition uses the shorter "e" and "o". When I asked the GhanapaaThee garu about this, his answer was that since short "e" and "o" do not occur in Sanskrit, there is no harm in using them and it makes the svara marking easier to read. The reader was expected to read every short "e" or "o" properly as the long "e" or "o". "Space" was never a punctuation mark in the Indian tradition. For instance many Devanagari manuscripts start with "श्रीगणेशायनमः॥" without a space separating the two words therein. So, traditionally word boundary was not meant to be indicated by space, but was to be known by the users themselves. This expectation from the user might be the reason for space in the middle of a word.

  

Finally in Madras (where Telugu printing was largely concentrated), in the early days of printing Telugu text, English was a major influence. In writing English, a space is inserted in the middle of a compound word. For instance "Prime Minister". We still write our names in that way, like in Vira Venkata Satyanarayana, Srinivasa Sarma and so on. So, space in the middle of a printed word might not have been considered as incorrect in representing a spoken word.

  

The question of asadhutva does not arise because rules (of Siksha and Vyakaranam) are for the spoken language. A given symbol may stand for more than one pronunciation. For instance many modern editions use the same sign as visarga for the upadhmaaneeya and jihvaamUleeya (others use semi-circles arranged like in an hourglass; some traditionalists use semi-circles which are like the Roman "c" and the inverse of it, arranged one below another). Taittireeyas pronounce the anudaatta at the end of three or more anudaattas slightly differently (with more emphasis) than the other anudaattas - for instance in साशनान**श**ने अभि (3.12.2, TaittireeyaaraNyakam) in Purushasukta, but the sign for these two does not differ. Other similar instances in other versions of Vedas may also be found.

  

(Further in Vedic texts printed in Telugu characters - the prolonged anusvaara such as in पुरुषएवेद**** सर्वम् (in Purushasukta) is printed as an anusvaara with the consonant "g" preceding it. This may be taken simply as a convention of printing, rather than a "mistake".)

  

Given the huge influence of the early texts, it is not a surprise that their usage persists even though modern technology has overcome the initial constraints. We find such inertia everywhere. For instance the QWERTY layout of the keyboard was originally necessitated to slow down the typing speed (that is why the most common vowel "e" is at a most inconvenient position, as are other vowels and common consonants like "s") to minimize the jamming of those early typewriters. Today the electronic keyboards are faster, they do not jam, but we still use the inconvenient QWERTY. Similarly early cars used all four limbs, partly because the means of transport they replaced, the horse, was controlled using the legs (to prod the horse to go faster) as well as hands (steering and braking). A train engine, much more powerful than a car, has but one lever with many forward and reverse positions (for different speeds). We have the technology to make car driving simpler, but because of "network effects" we cannot change that. If today HP makes laptops with keys in keyboards arranged in a logical manner, people would have to train themselves afresh, so they would not buy it. Since people might not buy it, HP does not make it. This is one version of the "network effect". So we are all stuck with much older technological constraints.

  

This is not to suggest that we should not change over. The more closely print represents pronunciation, the better it is. However changing old practices may not be always as simple as it seems.
