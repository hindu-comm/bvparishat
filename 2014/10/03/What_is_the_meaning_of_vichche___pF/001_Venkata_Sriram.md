Namaste,

  

This is the famous "chaNDi navAkSari" mahAmantra which the mantra contemplated while doing dEvi-saptasathi pArAyaNa. There are many rahasyArthAs that should be learnt from a diksha guru. The dAmara-tantra and shri bhAskararAya makhin have given good explanations for this. dAmara tantra splits this as "vit-cha-e". This is the sambOdhanAtmaka pada for the word "vicchA" which implies "hE chitsadAnanda rUpiNi". The samanvaya of these 3 padAs viz., "vit", "cha", "e" should be made with the first 3 bijAksharAs of the mUla mantra viz., aim, hreem, kleem which should be learnt from a sampradAya guru only. The pada "chAmuNDAyai" is the chaturthi vibhakti of "chAmuNDA".

  

Also, tantra shAstra explains the word "vicchA" as "vit chinOti" ie., that which bestows jnAna. 

  

Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati of kAsi explains this from a different perspective. 

  

regs,

sriram
