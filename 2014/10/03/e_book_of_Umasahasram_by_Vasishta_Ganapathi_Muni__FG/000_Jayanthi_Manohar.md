Umasahasram by Vasishta Ganapathi Muni.

"May Uma, Mother of the entire world, bless us who are afflicted with darkness (ignorance) and suffering, with the moon light of her smile, moist with the nectar of compassion.  
  
Ignorance caused by avidya, lack of knowledge and sufferings viz., adhibhoutika, adhidaivika and adhyatmika, can be removed only by the grace of the Divine Mother. And this grace is invoked in the form of her smile which is delightful like moonlight, dripping with nectarous compassion. The light, knowledge bestowed upon by Devi’s grace removes the ignorance and her compassion soothes and washes away all suffering."  
  
Umasahasram by Vasishta Ganapathi Muni is a living synthesis of the Veda, the Upanishads and the Tantra, built out of his lifelong realization in Yoga. Each verse opens the door to spiritual experience.

----------------------------  
I was drawn to the deep thoughts of yogic experience of the poet in \`Umasahasram', through the commentary, \`Prabha' written by Kapali Shastri. Even though I had read and reread the works of Vasishtha Ganapati Muni and Kapali Shastri, I realized during my translation how difficult it is to express esoteric poetry in an alien language. I could not reproduce the poetic beauty of Umasahasram but I will be happy if my efforts facilitate the discerning readers in understanding the insights of Vedic, Tantric, and Yogic experiences of the poet which help us feel the bigger plan of the supreme power play of Devi Uma in the universe as well as in our lives.
