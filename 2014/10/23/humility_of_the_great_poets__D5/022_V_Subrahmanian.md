Here is the last, profusely thanksgiving, verse from the vairāgyaśatakam of Bhartṛhari:  
  

**मातर्मेदिनि तात मारुत सखे तेजः सुबन्धो जल**  
**भ्रातर्व्योम निबद्ध एव भवतामेष प्रणामाञ्जलिः ।**

**युष्मत्संगवशोपजातसुकृतोद्रेकस्फुरन्निर्मल- ज्ञानापास्तसमस्तमोहमहिमा लीये परे ब्रह्मणि॥**

  

  

O mother Earth! father Air! friend Fire! relative Water! brother Space! I offer Salutations to you all by joining the palms of my hands. With your help I have done meritorious deeds and thus purified I have attained to true knowledge which has dispelled my delusions and now I merge my self in the Brahman.  
  
  

Surely, acknowledging the help received from the whole of nature is a profound expression of humility.
