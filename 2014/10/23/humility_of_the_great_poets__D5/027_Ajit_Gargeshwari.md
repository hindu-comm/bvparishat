There are several Stotras ascribed to Shanakracharya this is one among them. Why did Shankara write Prapancha Sara Sangraha or why did he write many prakaranas. Many prakaranas are ascribed to him which differs from his view presented in Brahma Sutra Bhashya. Its has been discussed in several papers and books for the past 100 years or more. There may never be a unanimus opinion on this at all  

The Vani Vilas edition of Shankaras complete works is not a criticaledition and offers the readers as to what criteria was used in saying these works printed are from the pen of Adi Shankaracharya  
  

This can be further discussed on a separate thread and not on this thraed
