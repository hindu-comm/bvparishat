The topic is very interesting...

Yes...There are several poets whose humility is as grand and noble as their poetic excellence too.

Even the Aalankarikas like Bhamaha emphasized on the necessity of humility for all. In the beginning of his Kavyalankara he says:

विनयेन विना का श्री: का निशा शशिना विना।

रहिता सत्कवित्वेन कीदृशी वाग्विदग्धता॥

In the Hitopadesha of Narayana pandita there is a sloka emphasizing the support of Humility for learned persons. There it was said:

विद्या ददाति विनयं विनयाद्याति पात्रताम्।

पात्रत्वाद्धनमाप्नॊति धनाद्धर्मं ततस्सुखम्॥

  

But there are certain poets who do not maintain humility but just analyse the world into different categories and say nobody is interested to appreciate their poetic virtues. The first one to be mentioned in this list is Bhartrhari. In the beginning of his Subhashita Trisati he says:

बोद्धारो मत्सरग्रस्ता: प्रभव: स्मयदूषिता:।

अबोधोपहताश्चान्ये जीर्णमङ्गे सुभाषितम्॥

Interestingly the same thought was repeated by Panditaraja Jagannatha in a different metre and in different words in the beginning of his Pranabharana Kavyam.

विद्वांसो वसुधातले परवच:श्लाघसु वाचंयमा

भूपाला: कमलाविलासमदिरॊन्मीलन्मदाघूर्णिता:।

आस्ये धास्यति कस्य लास्यमधुना धन्यस्य कामालस-

स्वर्वामाधरमाधुरीमधरयऩ् वाचां विलासो मम ॥

There are some other poets and critics who establish themselves through refuting others glory. One such author is Dhananjaya. In his Dasarupaka he says:

आनन्दनिष्यन्दिषु रूपकेषु व्युत्पत्तिमात्रं फलमल्पबुद्धि:।

योऽपीतिहासादिवदाह साधुस्तस्मै नम: स्वादुपराङ्मुखाय॥

Even Panditaraja Jagannatha in some of his critical writings refuted the theories of many people.

However the poets who showed their humility are much more honored by others than those who expressed their self pride.
