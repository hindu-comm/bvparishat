Namaste,  
  

Thanks for reminding us the humility of Srimadyamunacharya, Sri Vishnuchittacharya and Sri Vedanta Desikar. Humility is the essence of traditional scholarship. But it should not be mistaken for a weakness or ignorance of things. भवन्ति नम्रास्तरवः फलोद्गमैः । King Kulasekhara was one of the twelve Alwars in Vaishnavaite tradition. He was a scholarly king who has authored Mukundamala. What was the compulsion of this valiant scholar, to say -  
  

मज्जन्मनः फलमिदं मधुकैटभारेः  

मत्प्रार्थनीय मदनुग्रह एष एव ।  

त्वद्भृत्यभृत्यपरिचारकभृत्यभृत्य  

भृत्यस्य भृत्य इति मां स्मर लोकऩाथ ।। २७ ।।  
  

is nothing but and act of humility out of devotion to Sri Ranganatha. What has compelled Sri Sankarabhagavatpada to say  

  
दद्याद्दयानुपवनो द्रविणाम्बुधाराम्  

अस्मिन्नकिञ्चनविहङ्गशिशौ विषण्णे ।  

दुष्कर्मघर्ममपनीय चिराय दूरं  

नारायणप्रणयिनी नयनाम्बुवाहः ।। (८) and  
  

कमले कमलाक्षवल्लभे त्वं करूणापूरतरङ्गितैरपाङ्गैः ।  

अवलोकय मामकिञ्चनानां प्रथमं पात्रमकृत्रिमं दयायाः ।। २०।।  
  

in his Kanakadhara Stotra? He was rather a *sarvajna* than portraying himself for an *akincana*. Chakrapani Datta, the celebrated commentator on Caraka Samhita, surrenders before scholars in the following manner -  
  

सभ्याः सद्गुरुवाक्सुधास्रुतिपरिस्फीतश्रुतीनस्मि वो  

नालं तोषयितुं पयोदपयसा नाम्भोनिधिस्तृप्यति ।  

व्याख्याभासरसप्रकाशनमिदं त्वस्मिन् यदि प्राप्यते  

क्वापि क्वापि कणो गुणस्य तदसौ कर्णे क्षणं धीयताम् ।।  
  

Chakrapani was well versed in Nyaya, Vyakarana, Vedanta etc., whose scholarship can be felt while reading through his commentary. These Acharyas are the torch bearers of the cherished Indian values and culture. Similarly, if I am allowed to take a slight diversion from Shaastra to classical music, one can see plenty of such instances with regard to creations of *vaaggeyakaara*s. They do *AtmanindA* for the welfare of *loka.* In one of the *pancaratna krtis*, Sri Tyagaraja sings - 'దుడుకు గల నన్నే దొరకొడుకు బ్రోచురా...'and so on. Assuming all evil in the world on his head, strictly not confining to any ***para dUshaNA**,* Sri Tyagaraja portrays himself as the most bad person, sings in praise of the *bhagavAn* to detach him (all people!) from the clutches of the karma. Either literature or culture, it is replete with many such examples.
