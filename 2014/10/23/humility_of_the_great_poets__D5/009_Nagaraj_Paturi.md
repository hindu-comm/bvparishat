My pitr paadaah Sri Paturi Sitaramanjaneyulu wrote a book inTelugu providing proofs for his thesis that the author of S'ivamahimnah stavah who is known as Pushpadanta the Gandharva is none other than the vaiyaakaraNaKaatyaayana Vararuchi one of the Munitraya.



I shall soon come out with an English summary of the book.
