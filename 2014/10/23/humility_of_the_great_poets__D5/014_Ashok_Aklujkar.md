One of the most distinctive and pithy expressions of humility appears in the Preface to the first edition of V. Raghavan's Ph.D. dissertation on Bhoja's ;S.r:ngaara-prakaa;sa (the third and last edition of this dissertation appeared in 1978; the first in 1939; the third reproduces the Preface of the first):

  

स्व-बुद्धि-मृत्तिकाश्वेन समतारि नदी कथम् ।

ननु पोतायितं प्रेम्णा गुरु-पादाम्बु-जन्मनाम् ।।
