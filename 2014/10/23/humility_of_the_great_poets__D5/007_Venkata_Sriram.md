Namaste,

  

When great yogis, jnanis and mahApurushAs compose poetry filled with bhakti, the humility becomes an ornament in their poetry.

  

In saundaryalahari, achArya sankara vide sloka no. 57 (drushA drAghIyasyA......), Acharya uses the pada "davIyAmsaM dInaM snapaya krupayA mAm api shivE !". He confesses himself to be a "mandAdhikAri" in bhakti by adding the pada "davIyAmsaM" & "dInaM" and prays Mother for seeking Her grace and uses the pada "mAm api shivE" ie., shower your grace on me too ! (ie., pls don't ignore me as i am a mandAdhikAri am unworthy of receiving your grace).

  

In hayagrIva stotra, shri vEdAnta desikan, too, uses such pada-prayOga vide sloka no. 30 as:

  

nAnAvidhAnAmagatiH kalAnAM

na chApi tIrthESu krutAvatAraH

dhruvaM tavAnAthaparigrahAyAH

navaM navaM pAtramahaM dayAyAH ....30

  

Shri Vedanta Desikan says that he had neither studied any sastrAs nor performed any pilgrimage; neither he has performed any kainkaryam nor seva to any of his pUrvAchAryAs. Since, he has got all these deficiencies, he is the right candidate to seek the refuge of Lord Hayagriva.

  

There are many many such great noble souls in our acharya parampara.

  

vandE guru paramparAM...

  

regs,

sriram
