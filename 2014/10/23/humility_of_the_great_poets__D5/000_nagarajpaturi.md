Just for a change, I wanted to start collecting the expressions of humility of great personalities in general and great Indian /Sanskrit poets in particular.



Let me start with the most well known one by Mahaakavi Kaalidaasa:



"मन्दः कवियशःप्रार्थी,गमिष्याम्यपहास्यताम्। प्रांशुलभ्ये फले लोभात् उद्बाहुरिव वामनः।"


रघु 1-3

Other members of the list may add from their memory/repertoire/collection
