Namaste  
  

While I agree with the reasoning on the '85 years of age', there are several verses admitted to be of Shankaracharya, for example:  

  
<http://www.sringeri.net/2009/11/20/stotra/subrahmanya/sri-subrahmanya-bhujangam.htm>  

न जानामि शब्दं न जानामि चार्थं  
न जानामि पद्यं न जानामि गद्यम् ।  
चिदेका षडास्या हृदि द्योतते मे  
मुखान्निःसरन्ते गिरश्चापि चित्रम् ॥२॥

I neither know the sound nor sense. Neither prose nor poetry. Yet when the One Intelligence glows in my heart, with his six shining faces, words cascade from my mouth so effortlessly.  

The Shivāparādha kṣamāpaṇa stotram too has several verses which talk of something not done or many faults done.

The Viṣṇuṣaṭpadī stotram (admitted to be Shankara's) begins with 'अविनयमपनय विष्णो दमय मनः शमय विषयमृगतृष्णाम् । भूतदयां विस्तारय *तारय संसारसागरतः* । While he prays thus here, in the Brahmasutra bhashya 4.1.15 he has clearly indicated his self-realized state:

बाधितमपि तु मिथ्याज्ञानं द्विचन्द्रज्ञानवत्संस्कारवशात्कंचित्कालमनुवर्तत एव । अपि च नैवात्र विवदितव्यम् — ब्रह्मविदा कञ्चित्कालं शरीरं ध्रियते न वा ध्रियत इति । कथं हि एकस्य स्वहृदयप्रत्ययं ब्रह्मवेदनं देहधारणं च अपरेण प्रतिक्षेप्तुं शक्येत ?

In the Shivanandalahari, which is also admitted to be Shankara's work we have, for example:

स्मृतौ शास्त्रे वैद्ये शकुनकवितागानफणितौ पुराणे मंत्रे वा स्तुतिनटनहास्येष्वचतुरः ।  
कथं राज्ञां प्रीतिर्भवति मयि कोऽहं पशुपते पशुं मां सर्वज्ञ! प्रथितकृपया पालय विभो॥५॥   
I do not have proficiency in the smṛtis (codes of conduct like Manu Smṛti), Sastras (like tarka sastra, science of logic), the health sciences, the science of omens, poesy, music, Puranas, mantras, eulogy, dance, drama or humour and comedy. Such being the case, how can I be in the good books of Kings? O Īśvara of all beings ! Who am I ? I am a mere animal. You are Allknowing. Protect me with your generous compassion ( by passing on some of that knowledge to me, since you are allknowing)  

While we do not know about his knowledge of music, dance, etc. certainly the bhashyas give us proof of his proficiency in smṛti, purāṇa, tarka, vyākaraṇa, etc.  

I think in stotras one prays just as an ideal, humble one would. One really not accomplished will find the stotras apt for oneself.
