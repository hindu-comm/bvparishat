Dear Scholars,  
Namaste.  
  
There is a song which starts अजं निर्विकल्पं निराकारमेकं... in praise  
of Lord Ganesha. I would like to know who is the author of this song.  
While I searched in the net, it shows it is by AdiShankara. But, in  
Shankara's hymns book, it is not available.  
  
Also, there are many versions of the song.  
  
\~With Regards,
