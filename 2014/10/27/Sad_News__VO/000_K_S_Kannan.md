I regret to inform the members of the Parishad about the demise of Mahamahopadhyaya NSVenkatanathacharya. He was 94.

  

While he worked in the Oriental Research Institute, Mysore, hecriticallyreedited the Artha-shastra of Kautalya, with very many elucidatory footnotes in Sanskrit. He also edited Kavya-prakasha with two commentaries. He edited/translated many more works.
