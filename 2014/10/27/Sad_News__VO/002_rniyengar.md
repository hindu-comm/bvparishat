Mahamahopadhyaya NSVenkatanathacharya was one among the stalwarts of our times.I knew him personally since my younger days. He used to visit our home in Mysore to discuss with my (late) father. Always dressed in spotless white, he was an inspiration for many of us in Mysore. A few years back, in Bangalore, he attended my talk on Eclipses in the Vedas. He encouraged me to continue my work studying ancient literature from new perspectives. His passing away is a very sad news.
