Respected Shakar jI mahodaya!

Pranams.

"YES" is the reply for your question. It was me a direct example for your question. In 1988 when NET examination was for the first time conducted 

THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON QUALIFIED IN THAT NET EXAMINATION FROM ANDHRA PRADESH. THAT PERSON WAS NONE ELSE THAN Dr. RANI SADASIVA MURTY With no successors for 5 further years to get qualified in NET in the entire Andhra Pradesh.

Then my option in NET examination was No.25 Sanskrit only. By virtue of my getting qualified in NET examination I got appointment in Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati as a Lecturer in Sahitya in the year 2000.

Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
