Respected scholars,  
  
As I am new to UGC NET exam, I went through their websites and got lot of information. I still have few questions. I request a kind reply to everyone.  
1) What is the difference between CBSE NET and UGC NET exams?  
2) Can a person having Acharya degree appear for any one of Sanskrit 25 or 73 papers? I heard from a friend that one can appear only for 73 and not 25.  
3) What would be a criterion to choose any one of these papers i.e. who should choose which paper?  
4) What is the benefit for choosing 25 over 73 and vice versa? And which is better paper to go for in terms of passing exam?  
  
Also please share any guidelines to study to pass this exam and good books available in market to study, and any other important information related to it.  
  
I don't know if such discussions are encouraged in this forum. If not, then please kindly reply offline. Thank you very much.  
  
Sincerely,  
Prasad J.
