Dear Prasad,

  

1) What is the difference between CBSE NET and UGC NET exams?  

There is no difference between this two. In fact they are same. CBSE is just conducting the exam partly alongwith UGC.

2) Can a person having Acharya degree appear for any one of Sanskrit 25 or 73 papers? I heard from a friend that one can appear only for 73 and not 25.  

A person having Acharya can also appear for 25 similarly a person not having any traditional degree is also eligible for 73.

3) What would be a criterion to choose any one of these papers i.e. who should choose which paper?  

The criterion is your preparation for the subject. If you think you have deep traditional insight in any one subject like Vyakarana or Sahitya or whatsoever you can go for 73. On the other hand if you have a bit modern approach over all the fields you should go for 25.

4) What is the benefit for choosing 25 over 73 and vice versa? And which is better paper to go for in terms of passing exam?  

Practically it does not make any difference. You should prepare for any one syllabus thoroughly.

  

Generally we suggest the students to make a focus on any of the two codes and prepare for that through the entire two years of MA. Now you should go through the syllabus of the two and should calculate how much you have prepared and how much is left for preparation. According to that you should choose the code.
