Respected Scholars,

  

I have 2 queries.

  

1\. I searched for the source of the below mentioned shloka but couldn't locate it. Kindly let me know of its source.

  

2\. It is quite evident from the shloka that RAma is being addressed to by different names but I didn't understand the exact meaning and context of the word रणखण्डित. Kindly help me in this regard.

  

हे राम जानकीनाथ ताटकासुरमर्दन ।

इक्ष्वाकुकुलसम्भूत रणखण्डित राघव ।।  

  

Thanks in anticipation,
