Dear scholars,  
  

In case any of you have tried translations in order to reach out to the High School  
and College students, you may write to me offline. Unfortunately English has  

dominated the world in terms of communication and medium of education.
The  
new effort must use the original texts. The intermediary work done through  
convenience has little value. It is unfortunate that they are copied and cited.  

The new youth discards it.  
  

You may also write if you have tried to introduce any text at undergraduate level  

with the aim of teaching creative writing, composition or poetry.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
