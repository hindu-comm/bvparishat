Dear friends,  
  

Good morning.  

My initial concern for the children born abroad has been the unavailability of  

culture and philosophy books on India written with children in mind. I did not  
notice the casual translations when I was studying in India, but I do feel  
that most of the material would need new edits. It is possible that early  
translations were done quickly by the missionary associates and the core  
language has not changed. History of translations could be a separate topic.  
  
Some new people are trying to write about rituals and are stuck in terminology  
that have no relationship to the kids. Sanskrit literature is rich for children.  

I have come to feel that most literature was developed for public education  

in teaching values. I would urge you all to create a core group who would be  

strongly bilingual and help edit material for the young adults. I believe it  

might have its own need and application in the India homeland. I would definitely  

think that the publishing houses would welcome such material for public  

education.  
  

We will wrap the "undergraduate teaching" thread at the end of the month.  

I will contact each of the proposers and develop a course of study.  
  

Best regards,
