(Continued from my previous post)



3\. The authorship of Chanakya sutras and the whether the authors of the three books Arthashastra, Chanakyaniti and Chanakya sutras are the same or different is a controversial topic. Who this Chanakya is who makes the quoted statements in the so called 'Chanakyasutras' needs t be ascertained.





Coming to the issue ofcontemporary society and the anti-girl-child attitudes, itsuffices to say that there have alreadybeen widediscussions on how stereotyping Indians as anti-girl-child is just afalse-propaganda , there have also been wide discussions on Vedaadhikaara, vidhavaa avivaaha, satee, dowry etc.and I do not want to tread that beaten track again.



II. Apart from the above specifics,I would like to make some general observations regarding misunderstanding of some traditional statements as anti-women:



1.Words from Sanskrit and other Indian languages meaning 'woman/women' are used as a metaphorical expression referring to sexual attractioninworks belonging to fields (such as Vairaagya saadhana, certain strands of yoga saadhana etc.)wherecontrol on sexual desire isan essentialfeature required by theparticipant. Thus, in such works, 'Be careful withwomen' means 'be careful with your weakness for sexual attraction' 'woman is dangerous' means ' your own lack o control on sexual desire is dangerous to you since it comes in your way of success in your saadhana'.



2\. Books dealing withadministrative, political, diplomatic, intelligence and war strategies instruct people to be careful with the opposite partyusing woman as a sexualtrapto achieve theirobjectives. Even such instructions are sometimes misunderstood as anti-women. 



There are many other such contexts where apparently anti-women statements are not in fact what they appear to be.
