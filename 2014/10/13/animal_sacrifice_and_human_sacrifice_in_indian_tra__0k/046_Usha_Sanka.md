On thinking over the whole discussion, I found some points I learnt useful. So sharing.

We are not poor people and are rich in tradition till date.

When in doubt about some statement, esp. regarding dharma-neeti issues, before we discard it straight away, another alternative is to approach-

1\. Living traditions - gurus, or experts on the subjects.

2\. Commentaries

3\. Thorough context Analysis.

Living traditions are first place because they will have thought over, and contemplated on the major issues already and will have capability to answer according to our understanding level when asked one to one.

Commentaries are secondary -only when living person is unknown or not reachable. But one should have own developed vision and some background on how commentaries.

Last one is like mentioned in shloka- पादं काल क्रमेण च.. after gaining some more insight and background knowledge we can re-visit the same text and try to see what the poet has to say..

But all this is possible only when we are open and are not prejudiced or preconditioned.

  

Quoting too many times from blogs and non academic videos tend to have the opposite effect  

I agree with this point sir. But lack of time to approach libraries and books made me do that. I am aware of limitations of blogs and videos. But I chose to quote from only those places where I found it done more scholarly, systematic, point by point way.. (and I carefully gave up many others where only blabbering is done.)

  

not more than 2 -3 posts for each thread.  

Sure sir. Will follow it.  

Thankyou anyway.   

With greetings to all for शुभदीपावली I close it my side.
