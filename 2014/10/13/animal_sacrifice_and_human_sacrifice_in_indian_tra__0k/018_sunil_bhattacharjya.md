Someone has given another interpretation to these lines of Tulsidasji.These lines actually mean a bumpkin, who beats his own drum (i.e., beats his own trumpet) should be disciplined. Similarly also, a woman, who is nasty or indecent, i.e., acts like one having Pasu-vritti or like an illiterate, should be disciplined (even though woman deserve more respect than man, for example, Manu says that the mother deserves more respect than the father )
