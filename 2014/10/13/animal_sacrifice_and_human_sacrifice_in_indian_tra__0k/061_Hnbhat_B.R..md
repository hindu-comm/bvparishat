Yes. The initial question was dubious in itself.

  

I have got two questions.  
1.In performing animal or human sacrifice in Indian tradition why we choose only male not female.

  

1\. The above question takes it granted that animal and human sacrifice was there in our tradition,

which was not acceptable to all the members, firstly that wehad such a tradition.

  

Hence all the responses werecenteredin disproving the concept ofanimal sacrifice and human sacrificeleaving aside the second part of the question.

  

Then someone emphasized on the second part of the question, why we chose only male and not female, and focused the question taking the question on gender discrimination (even in killing, only males were preferred to female animals) and started quoting for the gender discrimination and male domination, leaving apart the first part.

  

Then as a counter movement, the members started to show from the quotations, that there was no gender discrimination and nomale domination. which turned out to be the status of women in general in literature. Postings to and from lead the rest of the thread.

  

The pity is that no body realized that the condition was common in an age which we could find any justification today within our knowledge and society. The social conditions differ from ages to ages. Literature has a wide domain than our society, and the context in the text decides the purpose of the quotations than a generalized statement to support our proposal.

  

I don't know whether the original question "why male species of animals were sacrificed and not female. The possible answers we can summarize from the postings, "there was no animal and human sacrifice" and hence the question does not arise. The other answer floated was "it was due to gender discrimination and male domination" without realizing the folly of gender discrimination and male domination in the question of animal sacrifice.

  

So the thread became cumbersome on the whole. Better we can consider the thread closed as no more points would find a solution for the original question, than making the thread worse.

  

With regards
