Namaste,  
  
One of the exponents of "rAmacharitamAanas" who studied under paramapujya karapAtri swamiji of kAsi  
once explained this vAkya of tulasidas which was quite often misquoted & misinterpreted. Here is his  
explanation who mailed me.  
  
///////////  
  

“Dhol gavaar sudra pasu naari, sakal taadna ke adhikaari,” which actually means, a drum, a rustic, a  
Shudra (one of base intellect), a beast and a woman- all these deserve instruction. A drum must be tuned, a shudra  
and rustic must be given guidance, an animal must be trained and a woman becomes adept and well-mannered through proper instruction.  
  
These are the utterances of Sindhu Deva (Lord of the Sea) and not Shri Rama. It is most unfortunate that some have  
interpolated the word 'taadna' to mean 'beating'. Kindly refer to Gorakhpur edition of rAmacaritamAnasa for the proper bhAvartha.

Now regarding the strI-ninda in our literature, which is also misquoted quite often. It is to be noted that sanAtana dharma glorified & regarded "strI" as form of dEvi. The 5th sloka from 11th chapter of "durgA-sapthasathi" says:

vidyAH samastAH tava dEvi ! bhEdAH / striyaH samastAH sakalA jagatsu /  

tvayaikayA pUrita mamba yaitat / kA tE stutiH stavyaparApraOktiH //  

O Mother ! Thou art the forms of all the sciences; thou art the form of all the women; thou art  

the form of 64 arts;  

So, it is not proper to understand that our shAstras didn't show proper respect to women. The restrictions  

imposed on them is a "precautionary measure" only which is for their well-being owing to their rajaswala niyamAs.  

Ironically, it is now in 21st century, even after advancement of science, technology, education, the

the women crimes, suppression, dowry etc have increased.

reg,

sriram
