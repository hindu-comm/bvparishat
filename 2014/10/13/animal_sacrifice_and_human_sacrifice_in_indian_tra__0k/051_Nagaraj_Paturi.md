There was a typo in the previous post. Let me retype



I can only wish that when it is reported to the people who matter to us are to the people to whom we matter that we made a certain statement offending to those people (report-receiver) , they either rule out the possibility of we making such a statement on the basis of their assessment of usbased on our past behaviour or try to understand the reportedstatement in a way that is not offensive to them again on the basis oftheir assessment of usbased on our past behaviour in stead of calling all our past behaviour as fake, based on the reported statement!!
