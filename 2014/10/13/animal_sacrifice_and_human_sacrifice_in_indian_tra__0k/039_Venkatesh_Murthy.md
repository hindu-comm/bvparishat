Namaste

  

We can say human author can make mistakes but Sruti is Apaurusheya. It has no author.It cannot have defects like authors. When we accept this we have to interpret Sruti Vakyas like the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad Vakya 6-4-7 sayingसा चेदस्मै न दद्यात् काममेनामवक्रीणीयात्, सा चेदस्मै नैव दद्यात् काममेनां यष्ट्या वा पाणिना वोपहत्यातिक्रामेत् correctly. A husband has to deal with wife if she has bad behaviour. The Sruti has also said in another placeमातृदेवो भव. How to interpret both these contradicting statements?

  

Answer is all women cannot be treated same like we cannot treat all men the same. A man with vices cannot deserve respect. But man with virtues deserves respect. Same logic. A woman in mother's position will always be beneficial to her children. She sacrifices for children. She deserves to be respected like God. She is more respected than even father. But a woman not a mother and if she has bad qualities cannot deserve respect.
