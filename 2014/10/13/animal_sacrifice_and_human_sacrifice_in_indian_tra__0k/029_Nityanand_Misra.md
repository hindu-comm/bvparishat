When a great poet/scholar/Bhakta says something like (s)he being but a child or having a feeble intellect, it is a metaphorical expression of humility (Dainya). Kālidāsa says that - *kva sūryaprabhavo vaṁśaḥ kva cālpaviṣayā matiḥ* (RV 1.2). Kaiyaṭa says that - *bhāṣyābdhiḥ kvātigambhīraḥ kvāhaṁ mandamatistataḥ* (MBP 6). And Tulasīdāsa says that (your citation below). Such verses are not to be taken in the literal sense. A conclusion of fallibility of a saint like Tulasīdāsa based on his verses expressing Dainya is extrapolation at best.  
  
As for Mānasa being a Śāstra or otherwise, and the verse in question being right or wrong, it is the opinion of Dharmācāryas who know both Śāstra and Dharma that is authoritative and not that of ordinary people like us who use our finite minds. Infallible or otherwise, at least we all agree that Tulasīdāsa, who studied for 15 long years under Guru Śeṣa Sanātana of Vārāṇasī, had an understanding of Śāstra and Dharma far greater than mortals like us.  
  
As a last reference on this topic, I would like you to read what Dharmasamrāṭ Karapātra Svāmī, one of the foremost leaders of Sanātana Dharma in the 20th century and a commentator on Śukla Yajurveda's Vājasaneyi Mādhyandina Saṁhitā, wrote in his phenomenal work **Rāmayaṇa Mimāṁsā** about both points - Mānasa being a Śāstra and the verse in question. People like Karapātra Svāmī and commentators can show us the way, it is upto us whether we trust them or not.  
  
This is my last post of this thread and I have no other points to make.
