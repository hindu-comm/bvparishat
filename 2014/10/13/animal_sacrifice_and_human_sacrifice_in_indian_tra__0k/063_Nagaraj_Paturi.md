I agree that the thread has reached a stage deserving closure.



But a few corrections before we call it a day for the thread:



1\. 'dubious' is too strong a word for the context.



2\. That there was and is animal sacrifice in Vedic, folk and Tantric rituals was not denied by the contributors to the thread. But whether the animal sacrifice in Vedic rituals was accepted as based on the right understanding of the Vedic texts or not was, as always debated in this thread too. That many Aacharyas of the Vedic tradition considered the practice to be based on a wrong understanding was brought into the discussion.



3\. Whether there really existed human sacrifice or not has been under debate. Many expressed an opinion that it did not exist.



4\. AadaraNIya Korada Subrahmanyamji and others clarified that male female distinction in Vedic context of animal sacrifice is a non-issue.



5\. Though it was a deviation, not completely unconnected though, there was a good discussion on the status of woman in Indian tradition.



But in any case the thread seems to have no reason to continue.



Thanks and regards,



Nagaraj
