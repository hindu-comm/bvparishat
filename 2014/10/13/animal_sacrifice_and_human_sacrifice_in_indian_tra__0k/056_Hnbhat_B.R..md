I think all quotations representing male domination over female species have been supplied and discussed round about.

  

Finally I would provide a verse which evidently describes the gender descrimination, in our present day which is a fashion in many families, where both or female partners take the responsibility of the family.

  

The common derivation of भार्या and भृत्य are derived from the same root - "- "डु भृञ् धारणपोषणयोः \| अनुदात उभयतोभाषः \|\| ३. १९" which gives the meaning of भार्या abd भृत्य similarly, to be fed or who is dependent on husbant/master and could not be a भर्ता who carries the responsiblity of the family. Though married life, is not yet vanished, in our Indian Society, but the responsibility is shifted or shared between the two. This was not expected in the mediavel age as we already know and the point of gender descrimination for this thread, prolonged to woment liberation front which is the idea of our present age. There is no one to blame if we could not find what we expect today in ancient literature. This is my reflection on the discussions. This was seen before hand in Mahabharata

  

य एव धर्मः सोऽधर्मोऽदेशेऽकाले प्रतिष्ठितः \|

आदानमनृतं हिंसा धर्मो व्यावस्थिकः स्मृतः१२ महाभारते शान्तिपर्वणि

३७\|\|८\|\|

  

Everything has to be justified within the limits of time and space. In other times, it may not mean the same as dharma.

  

  

The idea of women acting as भर्ता than भार्या in a family is viewed thus:

  

  

एको गोत्रे प्रभवति पुमान् यः कुटुंबं बिभर्ति\|

स्त्री पुंवच्च प्रभवति यदा तद्धि गेहं विनष्टम् ॥

  

Evidently the gender descrimination of the mediavel society is represented. Hope this is appreciated as truely representing the gender descrimination of our mediaval description and no other quotation is needed to establish male domination and gender description in our society of mediaval age and which is continued still, though rarely, though living together has become an optional condition, for the family of the present day.
