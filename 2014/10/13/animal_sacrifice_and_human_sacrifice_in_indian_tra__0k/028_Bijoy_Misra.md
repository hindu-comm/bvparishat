In a separate thread, I wrote about my experiment with Valmiki. My observation is  

that a poet does not impose an opinion but is a witness/commentator of the events.  

He may create events to comment on. A poet is primarily an educator.  

The poetry of the epics is certainly different than political poetry or social poetry.  

Valmiki does seem to have subtle observations on the society and he comments  
on them when he gets a chance. From such point of view a poet is a recorder and  

and an independent observer. The poet is a scholar.  

  

In my thinking to take Valmiki or Tulasi piece-meal here and there is an error in  
review. It's popular among western scholars who try to create knowledge from a  

sentence. A poet is known by his work. I am requesting to give me hints of  

such critical work if they exist.  
  

Tulsi Das 's work should be considered a poetic text like Valmiki's is.  

We have to come out of the Bible mode of infallibility. A written word is  

very local. The poet succeeds if a line provokes us to analyze and contemplate.  

The true success if the poet is to attract us to read more. We salute the poet  

for this skill and not for an observation he makes in passing, which could  
be contextual in the setting. To me, the message is in the distillation, not in a  
convenient snapshot.  
  

There have been some writings in the literature how Sita has suffered, how women  

are uncared for and why Valmiki must be responsible. I was asked to give a lecture  
on "Women in Indian Scriptures" some twenty years ago in a large church. I chose  
Sita to talk about and reviewed Valmiki to create material. More I read I discovered  
that Ramayana is more about Sita than about Rama. Sita glows as a human being,  
as a woman, as a wife, as a person. It is she who triumphs. For the first time  
I realized how poor has been our education! I called my mother!
