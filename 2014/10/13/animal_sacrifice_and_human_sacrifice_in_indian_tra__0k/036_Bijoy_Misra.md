Dear Dr Ghatge,  

I don't know your background, but a poet is not to be analyzed by a literal dissection.  

While it is not useful to help you change your opinion, I would only request you that  

you analyze the word अधिकारी and you may get your answer.  
  

The meaning is not that "go and beat a woman as you find one", but  

the following objects (....) share the pain/grief in the world. How and why is not stated.  

In my observation that's true. Mothers feed the family and eat the last. It is not by  

culture, but by nature. It's a larger philosophical question. Why certain objects tolerate  

more pain is unknown to me. It is cosmological.  

  

Not that a poet cannot be political, but good poets are not. We don't calibrate them  

from some cultural framework but from an empirical framework. I assume you are not  

doing a critical review. You must discard any raw material that gets published as  

interpretation. They are all political. Please do take a poet as a friend and interpret  

in context. Throw away political poetry.  

  

Best regards,  

Happy Diwali.  

Bijoy Misra
