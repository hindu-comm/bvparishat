In performing animal or human sacrifice in Indian tradition why we choose only male not female



--Poojya Swamiji's question particularly the 'we' there sounds as though human sacrifice is being performed by 'us'. This could be a mistake of
expression. Probably Poojya Swamiji meant that in the ancient texts mentioning human sacrifice, only sacrifice of malehumans is mentioned.



Animal sacrifice in folk, Taantric and Vedic rituals is well known.



On the Vedic side, validity of animal sacrifice is disputed from the Upanishads itself. BrihadaaraNyaka Upanishad itselfsays thatthe As'va of As'vamEdha is the Sun and not a real horse.



The wordpuruṣamēdha refers to the sacrifice of virāṭpuruṣa described in puruṣasūkta not the sacrifice of an actual human being.The word puruśadoes not always mean a male human. Most of the times it means a person, an organic whole etc. puruśasūkta describes the process of creation and not a human-performed sacrificial ritual.



Following the guidance of theupaniṣads, all theāchāryas of the vēdānta tradition, right fromādiśankarāchārya intensely participated in the vegetarianization of the yajñas. During modern times, similar work was done by Swami Dayananda Sarasvati and his Arya Samaj .



The symbolism of Sugarcane has got to do with the concept of kāmawhichever it is interpreted (as 'desire', 'eros' etc. ). The symbolism of kūṣmānḍa (pumpkin) varies in folk, tantric and vēdic rituals. Quite often , it is seen as a vegetarian substitute of certain animal sacrifices. Most often, pumpkin is a fertility/life symbol.



Since rituals such as Durgā Pūjā have contributions of from folk, tāntric and vēdic strands of Indian culture, ideas from all of the three strands should be taken into account. These ideas are 'giving back', 'sharing', 'pacification of anger/heat' etc.
