*“Let me not think on't - Frailty, thy name is woman!”*

  

– Soliloquy by Hamlet, in Shakespeare's Hamlet (Act I, Scene II, Line 146)

  

Is it wise to take just this one line out of context and conclude that Shakespeare (and everybody in England under the reign of *Queen* Elizabeth I) was a misogynist? The context: Hamlet's mother (Gertrude) has just married her husband's murderer (Claudius) and Hamlet resents her. If Shakespeare presents the words of a character, does a line from that speech that become a universal principle Shakespeare strongly believes in? Certainly not!

  

If this is the condition of poetic works like Hamlet, what to speak of a Śāstra like Rāmacaritamānasa? All I can say is rather than using our own mind and jump to conclusions, we are better off relying on knowledgable commentators who have studied Rāmacaritamānasa from a Guru.

  

Please see attached:

1) Siddhāntatilaka commentary on RCM 5.59.6

2) Vijayā commentary on RCM 5.59.6

3) Mānasapīyuṣa on RCM 5.59.6

4) Bhāvārthabodhinī on RCM 5.59.6

  

Although all the above are famous works, if anybody needs full citations and information about the books, they are requested to email me off the list.  

  

PS: A request to members - please attribute the views and interpretations you are presenting to the proper sources (book, orator, etc). Statements like

"One of the exponents explained thus ..." (Who? When? Where?)

"Someone has given another interpretation to these ..." (Who? When? Where?)

without any information about the source do not carry much weight.
