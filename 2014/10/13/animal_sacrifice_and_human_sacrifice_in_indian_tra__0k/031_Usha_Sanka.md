Namaste

The question was raised initially about something else- and unnecessarily the topic took diversion.

Mishra sir, thanks for correcting my Samskrtam mistakes. Always welcome. What is life and studies for- if not to correct our mistakes and learn right things?

*-----------------------------*

Dear Deepta madam,

I would like to say something at this point on the following statements-

*  
*

*I told that the commentaries are justifying the unjustifiable.*  

व्याख्यानतो विशेषप्रतिपत्तिः न हि सन्देहादलक्षणम् - has been the spirit of bhAratIya traditionalists. We always try to "understand the text from what *author* *wants* to say" rather than trying to "interpret with our own brains" - So the "heart of author" was prime-most.. not what *we*try to get out from it. Every commentator tried for same purpose in bhAratIya tradition. They also suggested their self-views freely upon author-expressed idea. So they will never ever "justify the unjustifiable"

In contrast,trying to make meaning from on-looker's point of view isnon-Indian. My English literature teachers encouraged me to find out "what any English poet or poem means to *me*" - and they told me it was how literature needs to be studied. But Samskrtam literature and shAstras are entirely different.

I found bhArtIya tradition (I avoid usingIndianfor obvious reasons) entirely opposite from English literature view..

So first of all one needs to *unwear previousspectacles* to study bhAratIya literature.

(We all are aware of disasters in our education system.. and how our point of view changed to entirely Western outlook. I would say no more on that.)

  

  

*you people will justify it just because you think tulsi das ji is infallible.  
*

Excuse me. Who are *you people*? Then question arises- "are there any *I people*?" :)

Tulsidas is a not just a celebrated poet- but his Manas is next tovAlmIkirAmAyaNa in many parts of North India. If vAlmIki is a RShi, so isTulsidas- and everyone who understood bhAratIyatA in totality*can* *only be* a RShi.

Tulsi's vision, his insight and his deep penetration into the characters of rAmAyaNa make him, no less than a RShi. Every Manas reader knows it by heart's experience.

One statement good, others bad- will not make Manas a shAstra.

If mahAbhArata can be paMchama veda, so can be Manas.

  

And in bhAratIya tradition, **it is ALWAYS by knowing the heart of a RShi that we understand his works and words and NOT by his words and works that we try to know his heart!!** Please pay attention to this statement. After I heard this statement from the mouth of a great scholar (whom I would bow for this single statement all my life) that I myself changed my entire vision. I started having benefit of getting the things in bhAratIya tradition in their true spirit. Otherwise I would have been saying same blah blah blah about women-shUdra --issues- that modern faulty education and modern social structure has taught me!! rather "injected" into me carefully in a *planned and systematic - in fact very systematic* manner.

  

*जौ बालक कह तोतरि बाता। सुनहिं मुदित मन पितु अरु माता।।*

This is common nature of all bhAratIya writers. It shows their humbleness. This does *not* mean - "what all I am going to say in this treatise is a babbling". It only means- the poet is humble before God. We all studied Kalidasa and repeatedly declared him the greatest of poets in Samskrtam. He also says- "तितीर्षुः दुस्तरं मोहादुडुपेनास्मि सागरम्" But we see how brilliant he has been. It is only out of humbleness and submission sense that every Astika poet says. Need not drag that "bAla" emotion here into "nArI issue". Tulsidas in not insane.. to say something entirely "emittable" statements.

  

*On males and brahimins requiring tadan  
*

It is said in hundreds of places in dharma shastras and smRtis about males in general and brAhmanas in particular - regarding their chores, their duties, responsibilities, their attitude towards women in all the latter's roles, course of life and many many things they need to take care (which are carefully avoided by the so-called "bhAratIya hating- critics") So Tulsidas avoided them for sake of repetition.

  

*this particular verse is not acceptable by any civilized standards  
*

It is the nature of picking things out of context that make issues out of nothing. We need not give up and set aside anything and can take all things from a celebrated work or shAstra - by just having a developed vision of life, world, and bhAratIyatA in particular. There is nothing uncivilized when we have to accept certain things.

  

"यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यन्ते रमन्ते तत्र देवताः" has always been followed in our nation and I enjoyed every moment of my life at home, in society- without even realizing my privilege. When compared to other non-Indian nations, Indian women are in much higher and better position.

\[If more doubts about such "nArI-shUdra-issues" prevail, please listen to Rajiv Deekshit's speeches on European vs. Indian topics. (Just visit youtube and search with his name- or can go to [rajivdixitmp3.com](http://rajivdixitmp3.com)
