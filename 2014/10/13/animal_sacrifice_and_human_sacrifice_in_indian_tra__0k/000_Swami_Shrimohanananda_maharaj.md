Respected scholars,  
namaskar,  
I have got two questions.  
1.In performing animal or human sacrifice in Indian tradition why we choose only male not female.  
2.And is there any significance of offering sugarcane and pumpkin in the sacrifice during DURGA PUJA  
sacrifice to the divine mother. Why these vegetable only are chosen.  
please reply.  
  
with regards,  
swami shrimohanananda
