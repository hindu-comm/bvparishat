In the Indian literary tradition, the goal of a commentary is not simply translating or explaining the original text. A commentary often justifies or corroborates the text by offering Vedic/Puranic/other citations, compares the text with similar verses/maxims by the same or a diferent author, offers deeper insights, and defends the author against criticism or attacks wherever necessary. The tradition of textual criticism and counter-criticism in India is not new, and the RCM commentaries are only following tradition in offering justifications and counter-criticisms (not just for this verse, but others too).

Firstly, the proposed reading would violate the peotic metre, so Tulasīdāsa would have never used it. Secondly, texts are explained on "what has been said" and not "what is not said". Cāṇakya already said तस्मात्पुत्रं च शिष्यं च ताडयेन्न तु लालयेत्. Cāṇakya clearly talks about a son (who is a male) and a disciple (Brahmin or non-Brahmin, but more likely a Brahmin in Cāṇakya's time). Shall we now say that as Cāṇakya did not sayतस्मात्पुत्रीं च भृत्यं च and only said तस्मात्पुत्रं च शिष्यं च, one should be not discipline one's daughter but only discipline one's son?

You may call it साम्प्रदायिक शास्त्र / औदीच्य शास्त्र / प्राकृत शास्त्र if you will, but it is not for no reason that it has been called Bible of North India - for the vast masses of Northern India from commoners to Vedic scholars to Ramanandis to saints, it is indeed a शास्त्र.

  

Though this is a tangential point, please note (not to convince you, but only to share some information you may be unaware of)

1\) The work has been translated by numerous authors and poets into Bengali, Marathi, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, etc (references to each can be given).

2\) One of the most respected translations and expositions of the RCM - प्रज्ञानन्द सरस्वती's poetic rendering in Marathi along with his brilliant Marathi commentary (मानसगूढार्थचन्द्रिका, which has been translated in Hindi also) came from south of Vindhyas.

3\) Lastly, here is Amaresh Datta on page 1674 of the The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti). Sahitya Akademi, ISBN 9788126011940:

*Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, apart from serving as a model to one or two Bengali poets of the middle period in the writing of verse-biography of Ramachandra, is adored greatly in translation and even in the original in the Bengali homes because of the highly meaningful utterances pithily and simply couched in his many couplets and quadruplets. Among the translations, the one published by Basumati Sahitya Mandir and a small volume by Ramprasad Sen (not to be confused with the famoits Bengali poet of the same name) deserve particular mention.*

Tulasīdāsa has indeed talked about this, but not here. Everything cannot be said at one place.

I think here Prof. Paturi's second point is spot on. "One of the basic principles of interpretation of a respected work is to assume unity of ideas or absence of inconsistency in the book."
