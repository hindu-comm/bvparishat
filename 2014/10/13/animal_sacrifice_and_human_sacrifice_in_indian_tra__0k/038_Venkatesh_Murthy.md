Namaste

  

I agree with Bijoyji 100%. If you read Ramayana more and more you will realize the epic is glorifying Sita more than Rama. She is the main character. Like in Vrindavana and Mathura all the people have realized Radha is more important than Krishna. Radha Bhakti has overtaken Krishna Bhakti in these sacred places.
