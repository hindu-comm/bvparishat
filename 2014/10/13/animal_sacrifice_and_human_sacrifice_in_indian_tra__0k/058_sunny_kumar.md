Well the question was different and all this discussion held on a completely different topic. All the comments of scholar related with gendering justice while the question was about "Animal sacrifice in Indian Text" exist or not? Wright or wrong?  
Etc..........

Well! I request scholars to give there precious views on it. Not only on the same male and female..... Man and woman etc.
