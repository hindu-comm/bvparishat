Let me discuss these and other quotes (some misquotes)from Indian literature and their misunderstanding as anti-womenthat havebeen there from a long time, in two parts:



I. the ones quoted here:



1\. अथ चाद्वैतस्य महान्तमाचार्यं शंकरमपि शृण्वन्तु - "द्वारं किमेकं नरकस्य नारी " ।



There is an old BVP thread on this quote and its attribution to Sankaracharya.



<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/uxIiLkSwlog>



In this thread and elsewhere the validity of attribution of this quote to Sankarachaya has been suspected and questioned.



2\.

श्रूयतां तुलसीदासः - "ढोल गंवार शूद्र पशु नारी, ये सब ताडन के अधिकारी" ।



This is being shown as part of the words of the god of the oceans to Lord Sri Rama in Sundarakand.The words of a character in a narrative poem are not taken as words of the poet. 



Moreover, there is a possibility that these words are an interpolation because the god of oceans is neither a गंवार nor aशूद्र . Obviously he is none of the other entities. Thus the line does not match the context. S could be an interpolation. Even if it is not an interpolation, these words are of a character, not those of the poet.
