Namaste

Here is a response from a scholar on the topic of Manas where Tulsi says- शूद्र गवार ढोल पशु नारी, सकल ताडना के अधिकारी.

-उषा  

--------------------

In this connection, there are two things that need to be kept in mind.  
1) Understanding the sastra.(i.e. शास्त्रार्थ-निश्चय:)  
2) It' practice. (i.e. निश्चितस्य इतिकर्तव्यता-ज्ञानम् )  
Th traditional scholars try to understand any sastra or Rshi in the  
light of all other sastras and rshis. Traditional understanding is  
collective summary of all the sastras. That is why, श्रुति:, स्मृति:,  
पुरणम्, आगम: and their commentaries -- all these are consulted in  
determining the meaning of a given text. Our gurus have said --  
  
इतिहास-पुरणाभ्यां वेदार्थमुपबृंहयॆत् । बिभॆत्यल्पश्रुताद् वेदः मामयं  
प्रहरिष्यति ॥  
  
" The meaning of the Veda should be explained (or understood) with thehelp of Ithasa (like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) and thePuranas. The Veda is apprehensive of the person who lacks theknowledge of other related sastras because such a person would injureit (i.e. the Veda) (by his misunderstanding)."  
  
This can be extended to all other sastras too. Even Tulasi das himself said--  
नानापुराण-निगमागम-सम्मतं यत्  
   रामायणॆ निगदितं क्वचिदन्यतोपि ॥  
" I compose this Vernacular story of Rama in accordance with the  
various Puranas, the Vedas and the Agamas and also gathering from theRamayana (of Valmiki) as well as some other sources."  
  
Hence, the current sentence of Tulasi Das, which is under discussion,should be understood in the light of other sastras. Here is a Shlokafrom some नीति-शास्त्रं or probably from the चाणक्य-नीति-दर्पण:,  
           दुर्जनं, काञ्चनं, भॆरीं, दुष्ट-स्त्रीं, दुष्ट-वाहनम् ।  
           इक्षु-खण्डान्, तिलान् ....मर्दयॆद् गुण्-वृद्धयॆ ॥  
( I am not able to recall the missing word in it. somebody might helpme here.) The meaning of the shloka is ... " One should rub or scrubagainst a wicked man, gold, drum, a wicked woman, a bad (riding)animal (like horse or bull etc.), sugar-cane, sesame seeds ...... forimproving their quality."  
  
Here we should note, man is also included in the beatable things, alsonote the adjective 'wicked' to the word woman, and note the purpose ofbeating clearly stated, 'for improving their quality'.  
  
I wish to repeat here that Indians do not see each sastra and each  
Rshi as unique and an isolated island. Calling somebody's unique  
contribution or unique teaching is alien to Indian tradition.  
  
 Next is it's practice. Three things need to be considered for an  
action. 1) Doer (कर्ता) 2) कर्म, the object of act. 3) The motive or  
purpose of the doer.  
  
1) The Doer:- Tulasi Das does not imply that any man should beat anywoman for any reason or for no reason. If somebody commits a mistake,only those who are in place of a mentor or a well-wisher like parents,teachers,king etc., are supposed to punish him or her and not anybody.  
  
2) The punishment is given only if a woman or a man commits such amistake which deserves punishment. One smrti says 'a person should notquarrel or pick up an argument with servants, children and his wife'.  
This is probably because we come to know others' weaknesses and  
mistakes only when we start living close to them. And naturally all ofus have some or other weakness or mistake in us. Secondly, we have tolive with them everyday and therefore cannot afford to antagonisethem. Hence, a house-holder is advised to ignore or endure them oreven adjust to them. Thirdly, if the woman is stubborn and arrogantand commits a punishable mistake, then he should try the methods ofpersuading, bribing, threatening and as a last thing, resort to thebeating. (This last one is stated in Bruhadarnyaka Upanishad, sixthchapter).  
  
3) The third point is the motive of the doer. Anger hatred, ego etc.,  
are not good qualities, hence no sastra-author including Tulasi das  
can recommend or approve them. Therefore, it is only as a punishmentdone in the interest of the person to be punished after exhausting allother options.  
  
We should also note that स्त्री-हत्या and बाल-हत्या is prohibited by  
the sastras. Beating women and children is considered unmanly even thesociety.
