The purushamedha, and ashvamedha, the animal sacrifice, was discussed in this thread in our group:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/BI_NHDz4B8c/ExTZrMjLg2oJ>  

  

  

Accepting it as a real fact as per the ShrautasUtra-s, the question raised was why only male species are prescrificed as पशु-s in THE SACRIFICES, and not स्रीमेधः, or female अज, or hose was not sacrificed.

  

इन्द्रा ग्निभ्यां छागस्यहविषःप्रेष्येति संप्रेष्यति ११ घृतं घृतपावान इत्यर्धर्चे याज्याया वसाहोमं जुहोति १२ .... १६ सहामिक्षावपामभिघारयति १७ आज्यभागाभ्यां प्रचर्य हविर्भिः प्रचरति १८ सहामिक्षावपेन प्रचरति १९वपायाःसंप्रैषाः २०

  

etc. गृह्यसूत्र-s (The above is from वाराह्श्रौतसूत्र So also many other श्रौतसूत्र-s describe the methods listed. Were they wrong in getting the meaning of the ब्राह्मणविधिवाक्य-s.

  

स्थूलपृषतीम् आग्निवारुणीम् अनड्वाहीम् आलभेत इति This line quoted from महाभाष्य makes no distinct gender descrimination. It is here female species, cow is described and not male as alleged by the questioner. So the question itself is अनुत्थनहतः प्रश्नः। The gender of the पशु is decided by the requirement of the particular याग and it is not due to gender descrimination.  

  

The subsequent questions raised whether animal sacrifice was in practice or not. as has been discussed in the earlier thread in the link and in some other threads in our group. The sentences could be easily interpreted as allegorical and even the sentences आलभेत, the आलम्भन is interpreted as स्पर्शन only and not killing, to avoid animal sacrifice.

  

प्रेष्यब्रुवोर्हविषो देवतासंप्रदाने  2-3-61 ।  

अग्नये छागस्य हविषो वपाया मेदसः प्रेष्य अनुब्रूहि वा।।

  

The above example also has something to do with animal sacrifice according to the procedure of याग.

  

The question was asked taking as real fact, the animal and not the question whether the animal sacrifice was practiced or allegorical.
