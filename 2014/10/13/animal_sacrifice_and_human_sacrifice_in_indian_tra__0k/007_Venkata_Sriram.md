Namaste,



In durgA sapthasathi vide vaikrutikam rahasyam, the 28th sloka says:



rudhirAktEna balinA mAmsEna surayA nrupa

praNAmAchamanIyEna chandanEna sugandhinA



The above clearly states the balidAna vidhi & surA nivEdana. However, a word of caution for brahmins here:



balimAmsAdi pUjEyaM vipravarjyA mayEritA

tESAM kila surA mAmsairnOktA pUjA nrupa kvachit



I was adviced in the similar way too during my chaNDi pUja. However, it is always adviceable to offer pAyasAnnaM which is sAtvika.



regs,

sriram
