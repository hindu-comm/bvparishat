One need not ignore the fact that sometimes some writers may want to remain incognito and one should not take umbrage at such anonymous views. Vyakti puja is not our aim, though we should appreciate good views. What matters is whether there is any merit in what is being said
and it may not be proper to reject anonymous views straightway.  
  

Secondly, when it comes to women's education, it is generally the menfolk, who gets blamed. The women are to be taught by women only and such was the system in the olden days. There is a verse saying that man should have man guru and women should have woman guru, though I do not recollect the details of the verse now and many of the scholars here may remember that. verse. Even in the household work the women most usually get their training from mother or motherly women. Even in the oppression of the daughter-in-laws, it is mostly the mother-in-laws, who are to be blamed.
