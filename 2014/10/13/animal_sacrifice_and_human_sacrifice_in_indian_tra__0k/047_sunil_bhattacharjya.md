Namaste,  
  

We have also to consider that Tulsidas was no ordinary man. In his Hanuman Chalishi he has given the distance of the Sun from the Earth so accurately that it matches with the value, the modern science has found. The devouts consider him as the avatara of Hanuman, who in turn is considered as an avatara of the 11th Rudra. It is believed that Hanuman threw away his version of the Ramayana, as Valmiki thought that nobody would read his (Valmiki's) Ramayana any more. Tulsidas felt that there was need for him to write the Ramayana for the consumption of the common people and hence the Manas came from him. It is not known to many that Hanuman has also praised woman. From his Ramayana we know that Mandodari was not only very beautiful, she was very accomplised too. Mandodari volunteered to fight Lord Ram, saying that she was a Kshatriya woman and she can fight Ram but unfortunately for her Ravana did not allow her to fight. Had Ravana allowed this mahasati to fight the war might have ended differently.  
  

Regards,
