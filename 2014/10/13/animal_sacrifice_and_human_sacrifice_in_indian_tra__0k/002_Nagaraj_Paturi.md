फिर भी भारत में चल रही है, तो उसके पीछे यह तर्क हो सकता है कि भारत पुरुष प्रधान है और भारतीय संस्कृति में पुरुष को स्त्री की अपेक्षा श्रेष्ठ माना जाता है । और क्योंकि बलि में श्रेष्ठ पदार्थ ही दिया जाता है, अतः पुरुष की बलि हि दी जानी चाहिये ।



-"भारत पुरुष प्रधान है और भारतीय संस्कृति में पुरुष को स्त्री की अपेक्षा श्रेष्ठ माना जाता है" is a perception not a fact.



Attitudes of superiority of male have been prevalent in majority of the world societies at the ground level. Such attitudes getting reflected in the actual behaviour of people could have been there in India too as elsewhere. But भारत पुरुष प्रधान है isolates India from the rest of the world and sounds as though that is the special feature of Indian society.



The statement भारतीय संस्कृति में पुरुष को स्त्री की अपेक्षा श्रेष्ठ माना जाता है is even more problematic. Which evidences in 'Indian culture' indicate that the culture treats men superior to women?



On the contrary, textual and cultural practice evidences from both Vedic and non-Vedic sources clearly indicate that women were/are given a higher respect than menin Indian culture.



From the Vedic side, the superiority of women is based on women having(प्र)सवितृशक्तिfertility power . यजमान receives this power from his धर्मपत्नीduring यजनकार्य. Without such a transfer of सवितृशक्ति from his wife, the offerings of the यजमान become ineligible for reception by agni or the respective devatas through him.



Popular narrations of the Savitri story give an impression as though Savitri tricks Yama into giving her boons. The actual Puranic texts of the storyshow Saavitri defeating/ convincing Yama in a vaada about Dharma in which Saavitri proves through her arguments that sateedharma is more fundamental than Yama Dharmato the sustenance of various lokas.



There are many other doctrinal, narrative, ritual evidences to prove superior position given to women than men in the Vedic culture. Similar situation can be shown from the non-Vedic side of the Indian culture too. 



I shall deal with the sugar cane and pumpkin during Durgapuja in a separate post.
