Namaste Deeptaji,  
  

Since you mentioned about one who is caught up in medieval mindset of wife beating, may I remind you that the Parashara smriti (the smriti, appropriate for the medeval period) has given the way to redress that situation. The women don't have to be so submissive in such cases. If the women do not use the liberty provided for in the Smriti. why blame men ?  
  

Regards,
