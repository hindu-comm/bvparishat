Nityanand Ji,  
  

I never told anything about the commentary tradition. I told that the commentaries are justifying the unjustifiable. That is all. This is because, as Nagaraj Paturi Ji told: they try to justify each and every line because of their respect for the author. This need not be done. If i really respect somebody, I should also know that he was a human and he may have written wrong things. Or are you suggesting that Tulsi das ji was some avatara and he cannot go wrong? He himself says in the balakanda in the manas that his words are like the mumblings of a child. he also says that his intelligence is low. (jo balak kaha totari bata sunahi mudita man pitu aru mata. nija budhi bal bharos mohi nahi, mati ati nich. now don't send 4 commentaries telling me that what i understand from these verse is different from what is obvious).  
निज बुधि बल भरोस मोहि नाहीं। तातें बिनय करउँ सब पाही।।  
करन चहउँ रघुपति गुन गाहा। लघु मति मोरि चरित अवगाहा।।  
सूझ न एकउ अंग उपाऊ। मन मति रंक मनोरथ राऊ।।  
मति अति नीच ऊँचि रुचि आछी। चहिअ अमिअ जग जुरइ न छाछी।।  
छमिहहिं सज्जन मोरि ढिठाई। सुनिहहिं बालबचन मन लाई।।  
जौ बालक कह तोतरि बाता। सुनहिं मुदित मन पितु अरु माता।।  
  
  
So, the commentators want to deny what the author himself says in the beginning, that his words may be fallible, he is a human being, his intellect is weak etc. his stotra to shiva (namamishamishana) which is beautiful has many shotrcomings when analyzed. I am saying that it is beautiful inspite of shortcomings, but you people will justify it just because you think tulsi das ji is infallible.  
  

Purush violating meter thing: you are clutching at straws. So, tulsi das ji who wrote thousands of verses cannot accomodate a word "purush" somehow? I am not a kavayitri else i could have written a verse.  

  

on the chanakya thing (by mentioning putra, chanakya means putri also): So, are you ready to accept that by the verse "dhol gawar shudra pasu..." the kavi wants even men to be disciplined (by giving the example of nari)? (something which is vehemently denied by the commentators)? Are we going in circles?  
  

If we are to accept that works to be accepted as shastra because they have been praised by many people and translated in to number languages, then we have to accept bible and kuran as the greatest shastras because they have been translated to number of languages. hence, don't propose this.  
  

On males and brahimins requiring tadan and tulsi das ji not having told this in that verse, you say that everything cannot be said in one place. this is evasive.  
  

I wish to conclude by saying that this particular verse is not acceptable by any civilized standards and we can ignore it and enjoy the rest of the Manas. When Tulsi Das ji himself says that his words are fallible, we shouldn't be trying to justify each word of his.  

  

With regards,  
Deepta.
