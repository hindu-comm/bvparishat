1\. There is nothing specifically Bharatiya about words of obedience, often called 'disclaimers' in certain fields of study, being used in the beginning parts of literary works, performance events of performing arts etc. as a performance convention. Not taking such 'formalities'/conventional routines literally has been part of interpretive common sense in all interpretive traditions literary or cultural.



2\. There is nothing specifically Bharatiya about a certain genre of literary criticism being interpretive certain others being adjudicating or evaluative.Expecting one genre tocarry out the function of the other or to find fault with one genre of literary criticism for being what it is, is not what is justified. Commentary is an interpretive genre of literary criticism andas such tries to bring out the 'intention' of theauthor. Both kinds of literary criticism exist in India and the west. There are aalankaarikas who found fault with established Sanskrita Kavis. That was evaluative criticism.



3.' Justification' and trying to findresolve the apparent inconsistency in a work are two different things. It does not mean claiming infallibility too. 'Respected' in my post never meant anything religious such as avataara. Shakespeare is a respected author. 'Respect' here is an attitude that the person isorganized enough in his expression not toresort to self-contradictions.
