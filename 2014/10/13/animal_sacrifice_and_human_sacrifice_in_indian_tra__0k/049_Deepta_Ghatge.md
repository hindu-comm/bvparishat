this can be resolved easily Nagraj ji:  

In the hanuman case, hanuman says that he has shortcomings. the evaluator tulsidas says that inspite of his words, he is a vidyavan. Although hanuman says those shortcomings about himself, he hasn't shown himself weak in any situation (as in the next case).  

In the tulsi case, he says that he has shrotcomings. the evaluators of his work (us, me, you, nitya ji, usha ji) etc. can see that a certain shloka doesn't fit into the larger context of his work (i am ready to accept this claim of usha ji that the rcm stands for "yatra naryas tu pujante"). Hence this is a shortcoming.  

Hence, the bhakta argument, that he is a bhakta that is why he is being humble etc. doesn't stand, else there will be no difference between real humility and fake humility.
