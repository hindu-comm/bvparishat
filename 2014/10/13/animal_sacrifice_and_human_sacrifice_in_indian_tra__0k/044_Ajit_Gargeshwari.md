======note  

This is my opinion as I have indicated in one my earlier mails. Please don't quote from blogs and enclose videos from blogs. Many of the blogs are not confirmed research. we should stick to books, journals and scholarly articles for all our discussions on this list. The primary purpose of this list is to act as platform for Indian sanskrit and Indological researchers to exchange ideas. Quoting too many times from blogs and non academic videos tend to have the opposite effect
