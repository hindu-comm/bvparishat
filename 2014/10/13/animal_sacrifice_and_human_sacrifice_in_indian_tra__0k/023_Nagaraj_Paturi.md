1\. Please note that Nityanandji's citing four commentaries was not for the justification of the line but for setting the record straight in response to statements like "it is also interpreted as " without quoting the actual words of interpretation or without giving references.



2\. One of the basic principles of interpretation of a respected work is to assume unity of ideas or absence of inconsistency in the book. For example, if there is a respect for women expressed in a book in many other parts and there is a portion which is in contradiction with that spirit then the interpreter tries to resolve this problem of self-contradiction in the book by interpreting the part according to the spirit of the whole. Ramcharitmanas is a book which does not in its whole, have the spirit apparent in the line under discussion.Hence attempts to resolve the inconsistency between the part and the whole.



3\. Defence of Shakespeare against attacks from hiscritiques/adversaries is not uncommon.Literary criticswho like Shakespeare did not and do noteasily move on. A significant portion of literary criticism in western countries too like in anypart of the world is devoted to such debates on the right and wrong interpretations of books. The intensity of the debates is proportional to the respect for the author of the work under discussion.
