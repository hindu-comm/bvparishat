Anyhow there is a statement:

  

  

अमन्त्रमक्षरं नास्ति, नास्ति मूलमनौषधम् ।

अयोग्यः पुरुषो नास्ति योजकस्तत्र दुर्लभ :।।

  

According to the spirit of the defenders of women's right in Sanskrit literature, in this discussion, this verse should have been composed by a male writer and he defends that any man is not completely useless or unfit for anything, but only one has to recognize the merits in him (and not the women, as she has been excluded from the statement specifically) and shows his partiality towards women as useless at all.

  

If one takes in general, पुरुष any person, it may be men or women, great or mean, only one has to look for the merits in them. But this is lost from all the quotations cited here.

  

I remember another quote from another male writer :

  

"कुपुत्रो जायेत क्वचिदपि कुमाता न भवति ॥३॥"

  

from देव्यपराधक्षमापणस्तोत्र ascribed to Sri Shankaracharya. This can viewed as the statement of a male ascetic. I quoted this for discussion in the spirit of the discussion in this topic without any comment of my own, than that it is a statement of a poet.
