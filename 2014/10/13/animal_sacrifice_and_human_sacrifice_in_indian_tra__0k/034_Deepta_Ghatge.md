So, a bakt like Tulsi Das ji says my intellect is weak, we have to ignore it. If we have to ignore it, why was it included in the text at all? Do you do such cherry picking in other shastras as well? (something like, I will accept the vivah prakaran but ignore the nishid vivah prakaran?)  
  

i will read your pdf and get back regarding the points raised there.  
  

thanks for the interaction.
