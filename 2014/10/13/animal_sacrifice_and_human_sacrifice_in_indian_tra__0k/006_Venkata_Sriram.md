Namaste,



1\) both male & female are used. Both kAmAkhyA tantra, shAktAnanda tarangini, kAli vilAsa tantra, navarAtra pradIpaH have mentioned these.



2\) kUshmANDa bali is the pratyAmnAya for chAga bali.



Extremely busy with official work. When time permits would give the references from tantra.
