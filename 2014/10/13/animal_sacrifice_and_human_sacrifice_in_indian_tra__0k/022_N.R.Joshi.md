Respected Scholars, Namaskar



Subject Dhaatu Labh , Lambha and Aa+Labha



I checked in the dict of V.S. Apte



Labh = to gain

Aa+Labh under Labh = to seize, to kill

Lambh = to kill



This variations occur (in my opinion-I may be wrong) because of meanings of the phonemes /L/ and /bh/. On has to go through the sequence of
Yabh, Rabh, Vabh, Labh and Shabh to reach the correct meaning. This is according to VarNavaada, my research subject.



Meaning of /L/ = to stay within amplitude. Please check the words for this meaning--Lajja, Laya, Lakshya, Likh and many more (I do not have my book with me to offer long list).



See the word LakshmaNa res'aa for Seetaa-stay within that line-amplitude.



Now meaning of /bh/ - to fill in. Together they off the meaning of gain to Labh



.In the Lambh there is extra phoneme. That changes the meaning.



If you do not want VarNavaada, then just say that Sanskrit Dhaatus have many meaning. polysemy or something like that.



VarNavaada based on physical properties of articulated sounds shows us that Sanskrit has internal beauty existing naturally.



Or accept Sanskrit is like any other language-conventional. You decide. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
