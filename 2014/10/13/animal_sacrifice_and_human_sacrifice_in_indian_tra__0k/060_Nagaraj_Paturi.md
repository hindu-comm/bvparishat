Sri Sunny Kumar probably has a point. The thread initiator's titling of the thread gives the impression expressed by Sri Sunnyji.



But unfortunately the questions in the initiating post were different from the title.the firstof them was on why male not female that lead to all the long discussion on the status of women, a line in Ramcharitmanas related to that etc.



The second question on Sugar cane and Pumpkin is already answered in the first few threads of the post itself.
