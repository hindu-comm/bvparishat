And also by spectral analysis of the poetry and through VarNavada, neither the poetry or a Shastra for that could not be interpreted and to claim it and it will be interpreted scientifically by scientific scaning of the tex. Mr. N.R.Joshi is ready with his Spectrum analyzer and varNavada, to analyze any word and for that the group of words, what we call poetry, but nothing more than that would be able to analyze poetry.

  

For analyzing a poetry, critics and poets have invented and have offered many tools, to analyze and have instructed how to use them carefully as far as I know. And if you are not satisfied, you can find more Instruments in the light of more Scientific Age and thought.
