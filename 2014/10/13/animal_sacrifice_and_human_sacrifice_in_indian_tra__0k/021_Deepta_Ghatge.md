On the shakespear quote.  
  
If the author was against the statement he wouldn't have included it at all. Or included it as coming from the villain of the story. Or not generalized it (as Hamlet has done).  
  
Moreover, no follower of Shakespear today will give you 4 commentaries of Hamlet justifying this statement of Hamlet!!!! They will say, this statement is a sweeping generalization and move on with life. But this is not what the followers of Tulsi Das do. First Nityanand ji is saying that the statement has been quoted out of context (by quoting shakespear), next he gives explanations from four different commentators justifying the statement in the context to which the person raising the objection objected to. Isn't this pulling on opposite ends? If something is out of context, why justify it?  
  
The concern expressed can be more clearly stated as this:  
Why say dhol gawar shudar pasu nari, why not say dhol gawar brahman pasu purush? After all, the effort required for a brahman to master the shastras is more than the effort required for a shudra to do his seva (if one goes by the actual varna ashrama system).  
  
I am not a womens lib person, I am not a shudra lib person. But I just want to look at this statement dispassionately.  
  
Second, he claims that Ramcharit Manas is a shastra. I don't think many people south of the Vindhyas, or east of bihar have read it, leave alone treat it as a shastra.  
  
Third, the statement also seems out of place in the current day and age. While I see many of my male friends drink and smoke, not many females do so. Many "brahmin" friends smoke and drink, eat meat, indulge in many evil works etc. I am sure that this is the experience of many people. So, who is in need of Tadan? The poor woman who takes almost full responsibility of the home or the man who goes out and has a good time?  
  
The best we can do is to say that Tulsi Das ji was writing according to his times and this particular statement can be ignored in view of the beauty of the Ramcharit Manas. Is this not the system followed by our tradition (accepting milk out of the water mixed with milk), instead of justifying with intellectual gymnastics something which is against our tradition (of giving great respect to women).
