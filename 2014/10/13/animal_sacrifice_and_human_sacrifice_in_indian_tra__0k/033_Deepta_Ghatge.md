usha ji,  
  
suppose you do all the analysis of all the commentaries and come to a conclusion that yatr naryastu pujyante is the spirit of the manas (or heart of rushi as you say), what is the need to take the dho l gawar verse and try to fit it into the heart of the poet? this is what i am asking you.  

there may be instances where a certain verse needs to be ignored because of changed circumstances. do we keep holding on to them and do intellectual gymastics bordering on the amusing or set them aside and enjoy the rest of the work? I favour the last strategy.  
  

If there were no words, there wouldn't have been an analysis of the heart of the rishi. hence there being something called a heart other than the words of a rishi is funny. Make the most charitable analysis of the rishi's heart. but don't try to justify jarring verses in the name of bringing about coherence. sometimes it borders on the untruth. all the interpreters of the dhol gawar verse have left out the tadan of purush. they claim that the nari is to be done tadan. tehy claim that end result is beautiful. but what if someone doesn't want this or someone wants purush to be more beautiful? this makes us a laughing stock of other people. A person who uses a mobile phone, a tablet, the most advanced car, etc. but one who is caught up in medieval mindset of wife beating. If we are to justify every word of manas, how are we differnet from other people who justify every word of bible and still firmly believe that the earth is flat and are against abortions even when there is a threat to the mother life?
