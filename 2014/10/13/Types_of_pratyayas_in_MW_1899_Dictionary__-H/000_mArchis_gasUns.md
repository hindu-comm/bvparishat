Namaste,

  

There are 249 types of pratyayas used in MW as per our <https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSorting/> calculations.

-ta 12489

-ya 12218

-ka 12215

-na 9685

-ra 7419

-va 6053

 To see the full list, download the attachment. One day we might have a list of the pratyayas with anubandhas from Harkare's book, but as for now it is just the morphological word endings. Would you add anything? Sorted by frequency.

  

M.
