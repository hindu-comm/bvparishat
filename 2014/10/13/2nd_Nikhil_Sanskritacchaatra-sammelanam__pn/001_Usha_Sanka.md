Namaste,

First of all please accept my best wishes for the event.

Then, one request-

Whenever a post is sent to a group, (something similar as this one) please make sure you give minimum details of what the link is about. Just sending a link and saying- "follow it/visit" does not make any sense.

You do not post something until you have visited that link yourself. So please copy paste some information from that link.. regarding what exactly it is about. Then only those who are interested or benefited by that link matter will proceed.

\[Only sharing my view of making things better for others.. Excuse me and point me out if I am wrong.\]

  

May this event be a successful one.

All the best.
