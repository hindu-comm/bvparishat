Namaste,

  

 There is a great manual that I've reviewed few years ago <http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/retsenziya-na-knigu-r-s-bucknell-sanskrit-manual> when I still hoped that there will follow a new edition, but the author declined the idea. Bucknell R. S. (1994) Sanskrit Manual. A Quick-Reference Guide to the Phonology and Grammar of Classic Sanskrit. – Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1994. has several indexes of great interest, see sample bellow:

-अन्ते

-अम्

-अवम्

-अवल्

-अवानि

Rest in attachments. Is there something of that kind ever done in any vyakarana book on Sanskrit NLP project,

  

M.
