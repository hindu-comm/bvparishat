\~ śrī-śrī rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~  

  
actually Dr. Aklujkar is correct in pointing out that it should be tarur iva. However, in all the readings that I have seen, it is taror api sahuṣṇunā (where taroḥ indicates ablative declension).  
  

I am not sure where Damodar Das ji got the other reading from. I just did a rough translation. I have seen the taror api sahiṣṇunā reading only. Maybe it might be the mistake of a latter scribe in copying down the Chaitanya Charitamrita but in the edition given by ISKCON, it is "taror api" and not "taror iva".  
  

From what I know, the verse was originally composed in Sanskrit with "taror api" as its reading, and Sri Chaitanya was a pāṇinian himself but later discontinued teaching grammar and nyāya in his school because he was attracted to bhakti.
