dear vidvaj-janas,  
  

When I saw the thread initially, I too was thinking on the same lines as Dr. Aklujkar. However, as Nityananda ji has pointed out, 'vāyor iva' is also a valid example in the Bhagavad-gītā. I think formations like these are possible because of the following rule (which allows genitive as an option to instrumental):  
  

tulyārthair atulopamābhyāṁ tṛtīyānyatarasyām \| Pāṇini 2.3.72 \|  
  

or it may be another rule which I found out in another book (Please see attachment) which allows genitive as an option to locative. I am unable to locate the exact vārtika for this as I am a little busy. If anyone can help in finding it, then it would be great.  
  

Again i may be incorrect so vidvaj-janas kindly purify any faults in my understanding.  

  

regards,  
  
hari parshad das.
