Just for clarification:  
taro.h (the word taken by itself) is grammatical (that is, derivable by the relevant rules in respectable grammars), but taro.h/taror iva in the given context is ungrammatical. The phrase could be grammatical only if one takes the position that the grammaticality of a word has nothing to do with the meaning of a sentence or the position that in the verse concerned sahib.s.nunaa, an adjective, really stands for sahib.s.nutaa, an abstract noun or that iva has the same meaning as api.  
  
The first position would imply that consideration of syntax has nothing to do with semantics (a fallacy that was not recognized in early Chomsky's separation of syntactic level and semantic level or deep structure, if I remember correctly, and a stance that even the advocates of [kha.n.da-pak.sa](http://kha.n.da-pak.sa) avoid taking in the Indian discussions of vaakya and vaakyaartha).  
  
The second would be arbitrary. If it is allowed to stand, there would be no restriction on what meaning we derive from which sentence.  
  
(Both positions will end up in robbing the verse of its poetic quality.)  
  
a.a.
