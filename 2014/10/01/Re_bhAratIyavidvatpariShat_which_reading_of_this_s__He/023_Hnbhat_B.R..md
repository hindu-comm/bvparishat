Good God. Damodar Das has appeared again with his sources and HareKrishna Das had given the correct reading from Caitanyamruta from the ISKON Edition and says तरोरपि is the original reading.

  

चैतन्यामृत was originally composed in Sanskrit according to HareKrishna Dasa and now our Damodaradasa, says

the मूल is Bengali version, as I had already indicated. It is possible that it could have been translated into Sanskrit, independently by two persons in two different ways. One grammatically problametic, but keeping closer to the original Bengali version and the other grammatically correctly feasible to the Sanskrit syntax. This is just a possibility, if the original composition was in Bengali. The first influenced by the Bengali structure for the idea and the second Sanskritized version correctly, may not be a literal translation from Bengali expression. This is just an indication and not any suggestion. Only the other way, to tread इव = अपि, meaning the same comparison, अव्ययानामनेकार्थत्वात्।

  

Now leave it to both to prove one of the readings to be authentic and we are the audience without making it more complicate.
