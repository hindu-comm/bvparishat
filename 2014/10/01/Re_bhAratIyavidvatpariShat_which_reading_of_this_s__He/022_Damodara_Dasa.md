Hare Krishna.  
Respected vidvadjanas,  
  
Regarding sources of different readings I referred:  
  
This reading "taroriva sahisNunA" I got from caitanya caritAmrta,  
English version printed by BBT, although it is there in Vedabase. This  
verse appears many times in Caitanya Caritamrta Antya 6.239, Adi  
17.31, etc. In the printed edition of Caitanya Caritamrta by BBT (2009  
print) it is rendered "taroriva". In the 1975-printed edition of BBT  
also it is rendered "taroriva".  
  
\[See link below - there is no change in the "trnad api sunicena" verse  
from old Caitanya Caritamrta edition till now - it is "taroriva"  
mentioned there.  
<http://bookchanges.com/cc/CC_ADI_017.htm>\]  
  
As Nityanand Misra pointed out here is another reading:  
Hazari Prasad Dwivedi quotes the reading with तरोरपि  
<http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=L0JwHyafQ-IC&pg=PA232>  
  
Also in the same BBT's Caitanya Caritamrta, "tarorapi" version is  
found but not in mula verse but purport in early 1975 edition, but  
they are edited to "taroriva" in recent editions.  
  
I will try to see readings from versions of Caitanya Caritamrta other  
than those of BBT to get some more neutral opinion. If anybody has  
link to early editions of mula bengali versions of Caitanya Caritamrta  
it will be helpful. You can look at verses Antya 6.239 and Adi 17.31.  
Currently I don't have them.  
  
Thankyou,  
damodara das
