Thanks for the link.  
  
On page 232, it is almost certainly a mistake, सप्तमी के अतिरिक्त should read तृतीया के अतिरिक्त. The reason is that the book says सप्तमी and षष्ठी are used with the word सदृश.  
<https://archive.org/stream/SanskritVyakaranPraveshika/sanskrit_vyakaran_praveshika#page/n228/mode/1up>  
  
But the same book on page 198 gives examples of तृतीया and षष्ठी with सदृश (which contradicts the above)  
<https://archive.org/stream/SanskritVyakaranPraveshika/sanskrit_vyakaran_praveshika#page/n195/mode/1up>  
  
So I believe the text on page 232 should read तृतीया के अतिरिक्त. Mistakes can remain in a book even after 12 editions. I have not come across any examples of सदृश with सप्तमी.  
  
Sutra should be PS 2.3.72.

Apologies. I thought "parshad" was Tadbhava or "prasāda" with the स being replaced by श. I stand corrected now.  
  
Though Monier Williams gives "associate" as the first meaning, a better translation is "attendant" \[in a council\] or "councillor", since as per शब्दकल्पद्रुम and वाचस्पत्य, the word is derived from परिषद् (council) by counting it in पृशोदरादि.  
  
Also, हरिपार्षद refers to the 16 पार्षदs of नारायण who are (१) विष्वक्सेन (२) जय (३) विजय (४) प्रबल (५) बल (६) नन्द (७) सुनन्द (८) सुभद्र (९) भद्र (१०) चण्ड (११) प्रचण्ड (१२) कुमुद (१३) कुमुदाक्ष (१४) शील (१५) सुशील and (१६) सुषेण.
