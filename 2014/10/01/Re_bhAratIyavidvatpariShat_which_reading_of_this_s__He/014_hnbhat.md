I think it is not this Hari Prasad Das, but another Damodar Das, who had raised the question:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/fEg4j6YXLLg/29HAevEQjZoJ>

  

The question was plainly on the grammatical correctness of the two readings:

१.  
तृणादपि सुनीचेन तरोरिव सहिष्णुना ।  
अमानिना मानदेन कीर्तनीय सदा हरि: ॥  
२.  
तृणादपि सुनीचेन तरोरपि सहिष्णुना ।  

> अमानिना मानदेन कीर्तनीय सदा हरि: ॥

  



And the discussion of the question was taken up in a new thread by Mr.Jha. with slight change. The question of meaning was not raised, but only the grammatical accuracy of the two readings. But yet the problem raised was not solved satisfactorily how the reading derived the meaning:

  

*[taroḥ](http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=taroh)*— than a tree;*[iva](http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=iva)*— like;*[sahiṣṇunā](http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=sahisnuna)*— with tolerance;  

  

though each word seems to be grammatically correct. This was inspected by Prof.Aklujakar also. May be the influence of construction in Bengali language?.

  

My question was this Shikshashtaka originally composed in Bengali and then then translated to Sanskrit by some of his disciples? This rises because of the two readings available as raised in the first post in the other thread.

  

So far the discussion continued, the reading तरोरिव सहिष्णुना is not justified by any participants, than going around तरोः as genetive and ablative. As ablative, the "iva" stands alone without any link to the तरोः. it means without "iva" itself, who is tolerant(सहिष्णु) than the tree. That is why the question raised and not about the comprehensive concept of Bhakti Vedanta behind the verse.

  

Hence now my request to Mr.Hari Prasad ji, to explain the usage as he is familiar with it and how to solve the problem pointed by the members in this reading, to get the meaning in the site.

  

Thanks in advance
