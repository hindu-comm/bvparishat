As I showed in my first post on the issue, there is really no problem with the reading tarot api sahi.s.nunaa. Taking taro.h as an ablative is grammatical. There is precedent for taking ordinary/basic degree adjectives as adjectives in the comparative degree (sahi.s.nunaa as [sahi.s.nutare.na](http://sahi.s.nutare.na), suniicena as [suniicatare.na](http://suniicatare.na)).  
  
Best wishes.
