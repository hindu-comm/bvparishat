Exactly. The other reading तरोरिव does not suit in the context with सहिष्णुना to give a satisfactory meaning, though तरोरिव and तरोरपि are grammatically correct by themself. But तरोरिव would require one more change सहिष्णुता. (the interchange of त \> ना). I recognized this difficulty in the beginning itself and just remarked that both are grammatically correct, if they make a satisfactory meaning.
