dear Nityananda ji,  
  

thanks for clarifying that the traditional commentators are not in favor of using 'iva' in 2.3.72  
  

the second quote was from the following book : <https://archive.org/details/SanskritVyakaranPraveshika>  
  

page number 230 of the PDF.  
  

PS: Also, please note that my name is : hari pārṣada (not prasāda although hari prasAda is also a nice name) Pārṣada means associate.  
  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari pārṣada dāsa.
