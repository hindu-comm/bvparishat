sahiShNutaa of taru and sahiShNutaa required by a devotee are well known.



e.g.,



तुलसी संत सुअंब तरु, फूल फलहिं परहेत।  
इतते ये पाहन हनत, उतते वे फल देत।।



is a popular message by sant tulasidasji.." इतते ये पाहन हनत, उतते वे फल देत" has not only sahishNutaa but also help in return to harm. This has been there throughout devotional literature.



I don't think any of the discussants had any doubt about the auchitya of the simile. tarOrapi and tarOriva lead to two different alankaaras.



But the discussion was centred around grammar.



My surprise was why AadaraNIya Hari Prasad Dasji allowed aprolonged discussion if he knew the authentic reading with a traditionally accepted meaning.
