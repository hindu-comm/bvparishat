This is the translation you have given from the link Vedabase:

  

> taror iva sahiṣṇunā — by \[a person\] as tolerant as a tree.

  

and the translation in the Vedabase with the same reading:

  

> *[taroḥ](http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=taroh)*— > than a > tree;*[iva](http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=iva)*— > like;*[sahiṣṇunā](http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=sahisnuna)*— > with tolerance;

  

as I had already given and Mr.Damodara das got the reading: taror iva from the Vedabase from Shikashtashtaka in the link you had given, as you had already mentioned, directly and the other reading from the Edition of ChaitanyamRta, it is as you had pointed out,

  

Now you are asking from where Damodara Das got his reading?

  

If the Caitanyamrita is the original source, where Shikshashtaka is included, in the Edition OF ISKAN, then it is the authentic reading. and the link gives wrong reading and incompatible translation in the Vedabase presentation.

  

Conclusively, it can be confirmed तरोरपि is the original reading, both चैतयचरितामृत, and in the शिक्षाष्टक, but wrongly presented in Vedabase as तरोरिव which gave rise to the discussion so far, in two threads.

  

Thanks for your information.
