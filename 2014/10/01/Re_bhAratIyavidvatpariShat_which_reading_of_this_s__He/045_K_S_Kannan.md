The discussions are getting unwarrantedly prolix, I suppose.  

I think that neither  

taror iva sahis"n"unA

nor

tarur iva sahis"n"unA

can be valid constructions in the given verse. For, the rule generally adhered to is that concord  

(sAmAnAdhikaraNya) is followed even between upamAna and upameya (as between the adjective and the substantive).

In which case, we would have had  

taruNeva sahis"n"unA  

(derived from .

tarur iva sahis"n"uH).  

The last word, the similial upameya, settles the g-c-n (gender, case, and number); not the g-c-n of taru.

  

The direct and simple solution is provided by the intuitive criteria of symmetry:

(a) tRNAt is in the Ablative. Hence take taroH also as the Ablative (not the Genitive, that is, though it has the same form there).

(b) api, coupled with the Ablative in the first phrase, has a comparative force and an intensifying role (hence the sense of "even more than"); and so the same is valid in the second phrase (iva would rather break the pattern; there has been no doubt regarding the reading of the first quarter of the verse).  

Hence the most probable/seemly reading is:  

taror iva sahis"n"unA.
