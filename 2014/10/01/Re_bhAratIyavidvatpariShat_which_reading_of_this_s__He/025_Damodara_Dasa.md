\>\> Now leave it to both to prove one of the readings to be authentic and we are the audience without making it more complicate.  
  

Yes, sirs. I do accept that both versions exists and thus my main  
question was not which version is more authentic (as this may remain  
inconclusive even after discussion) but to see it from another -  
practical - perspective, if one of them is technically incorrect and  
thus get idea if one of the readings get a precedence over the other.  
Here it has already been accepted, almost by all, that "tarorapi" is  
more straightforward and thus I accepted that precedence is to be  
given to it although "taroriva" is not gramatically wrong and in some  
rare cases can be used to convey a similar meaning.
