I cited the **vāyoriva** example in a specific context (**sāmānādhikaraṇya** of **upamāna** and **upameya** when **iva** is used). Here we **vāyoḥ** along with **tasya**, and both have the genitive case. The sense is *ahaṁ tasya (manasaḥ) nigrahaṁ vāyoḥ \[nigrahaṁ\] iva duṣkaraṁ manye*. One cannot ignore this specific context and make a conclusion that a usage like **vāyoriva** is valid in all cases of the **upameya**. Here is another example of iva with genitive by Vālmīki - **rāmarāvaṇayoryuddhaṁ rāmarāvaṇayoriva**. However, here again there is genitive in the **upamāna** (the second **rāmarāvaṇayoḥ**) since there is genitive in the **upameya** also (the first **rāmarāvaṇayoḥ**).

This understanding is incorrect as per traditional commentaries. The word iva is explicitly excluded by most traditional commentators on 2.3.72. Therefore one has the famous usage **gauriva gavayaḥ** and not (goriva gavayaḥ or gavaiva gavayaḥ which are both incorrect). You may want to refer to commentaries like **Nyāsa** and **Bālamanoramā** or the English commentary by **Rāmanātha Śarmā** which explain why the usage of **iva** is not governed by PS 2.3.72. If it was, then the numerous similes by Kālidāsa, who is the authority on the use of similes (**upamā kālidāsasya**) would all be non-Paninian. I have already given an example from **Raghuvaṁśa**, many more can be easily found in his works.

Which book is this from? If you give the complete citation (book, edition and page number), the original rule could probably be traced. Could there be a error, since sadṛśa is usually used with instrumental and genitive (and not genitive and locative)? This still does not say anything about iva, where the paraphrase is usually **yathā X tathā Y**.
