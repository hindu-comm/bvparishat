Dr. Aklujkar,  
  
I think you mean instrumental and not nominative. For with the use of इव, both the उपमान and उपमेय have the same case usually. For example in Raghu 1.50 one has  
  
आकीर्णमृषिपत्नीनामुटजद्वाररोधिभिः।  
अपत्यैरिव नीवारभागधेयोचितैर्मृगैः॥ १.५० ॥  
  
उटजद्वाररोधिभिः ऋषिपत्नीनाम् अपत्यैः इव नीवारभागधेयोचितैः मृगैः आकीर्णम् \[आश्रमम् प्रापत्\]  
  
Here both the उपमान (उटजद्वाररोधिभिः अपत्यैः) and उपमेय (नीवारभागधेयोचितैः मृगैः) have the instrumental case.  
  
The exact translation of तरुः इव सहिष्णुना would be "like a tree with a tolerant \[being\]". Whether that makes complete sense or not is a different question.  
The correct way of saying ""by \[a person\] as tolerant as a tree" would be तरुणा इव सहिष्णुना, as in Raghu 1.50.  
  
There are many examples of same case-ending of उपमान and उपमेय when इव is used, here is one from Gita 6.34  
  
तस्याहं निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम्  
  
Here both the उपमान (वायोः) and उपमेय (तस्य) have the genitive case.
