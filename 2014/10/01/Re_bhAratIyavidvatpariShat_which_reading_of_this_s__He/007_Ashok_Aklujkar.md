If taror iva sahiṣṇunā is translated as "by \[a person\] as tolerant as a tree," then taro.h must be replaced by taru.h/tarur (nominative singular), if the phrase is not to be ungrammatical (notice that in your translation of the second quarter there is no reflection of taro.h either as an ablative or as a genitive).  
  
Metrically, too, taru.h/tarur does not sound right (at least to my ear), although occasionally such constructions with five laghu/light syllables without a break at the beginning of a ;sloka/anu.s.tubh quarter may be found.  
  
I am a little surprised by the length of the discussion the verse has caused. If it has to have undiminished poeticity, the reading should obviously be taror api. Then only the first two quarters will balance each other and the poet's statement will have some punch.  
  
Simple adjectives functioning like a comparative adjective (that is, functioning like their form in the comparative degree) are occasionally found (not only in Skt but also in other languages); e.g., in तृणादपि लघुस्तूलस्तूलादपि च याचक: । 'वायुना किं न नीतोऽसौ?' 'मामयं प्रार्थयेद्' इति ।।, laghu means laghutara. In your translation of the first quarter you, too, translate suniica as 'humbler'.  
  
Perhaps some discussants could not figure out why a tree has been thought of as [sahi.s.nu](http://sahi.s.nu) 'tolerant'. Well, people climb upon trees, hang heavy things on it, cut its branches, but it still grows and gives shade, fruit etc.  
  
Perhaps the difficulty was in understanding why Hari require a devotee to be tolerant. Well, there have been many saint (सन्त) poets, who have complained that the Lord was taking too long a time in presenting Himself before them, that they were suffering pangs of separation from Him, that He was putting them to harder and harder tests, etc.  
  
So, I take the verse as saying: 'If one wishes to be a devotee of Hari, one must think of oneself as less significant than a blade of grass and one must be ready to put up with more pain than a tree. One must have no maana, but one must give maana (one must not think of oneself as somebody, but one must make everyone else feel as if they were somebody).'
