Yes.



councillor or a member of a council



पार्षद् \< पारिषद्



पारिषद् \< परिषद्



परिषद = सभा; Hence पार्षद् \< पारिषद् = सभासद्



In the lines of विष्णुपारिषद्, we have the usage of the wordशिवपारिषद् also.



What the 'membership' means depends on the school of thought that views it. सालोक्य, सारूप्य, कैंकर्य etc. are some of those.
