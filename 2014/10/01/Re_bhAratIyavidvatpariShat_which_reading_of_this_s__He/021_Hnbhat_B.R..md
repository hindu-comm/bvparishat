Anyhow, the question raised about grammatical correctness, is solved satisfactorily.

  

And better this thread could be merged with the first thread, so that one looking for issue need not go backwards to the original question and its solution. The other reading doesn't exist at all, in spite of all efforts on justifying the reading.

  

Simply Hari himself takes these to adjectives, in the second set:

  

अमानी मानदो मान्यो लोकस्वामी त्रिलोकधृक ।  

  

सहिष्णु also found:

  

भ्राजिष्णुर्भोजनं भोक्तासहिष्णुर्जगदादिजः।

अनघो विजयो जेता विश्वयोनिः पुनर्वसुः॥१६॥  

  

among the thousand names, in विष्णुसहस्रनाम. Thus many parallell verses could be quoted if one wants to continue this thread further. Already Prof.Aklujkar had quoted one or two.

  

भवन्ति नम्रास्तरवः फलोद्गमैः , नवाम्बुभिर्भूरिविलम्बिनो घनाः ।

अनुद्धताः सत्पुरुषाः समृद्धिभिः , स्वभाव एवैषः परोपकारिणाम्॥

  

and so on. 

  

Better since the original question is solved, it is desirable that this thread could be treated as closed.
