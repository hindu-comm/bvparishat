I think the only case where where locative, ablative and Genitive are  
taken up idiomatically,  
  
सप्तम्यधिकरणे च॥ २।३।३६॥  
  
अनभिहिते अधिकरणे सप्तमी विभक्तिः भवति, चकारात् दूरान्तिकार्थेभ्यः च।  
  
दूरान्तिकार्थेभ्यः खल्वपि दूरे ग्रामस्य। अन्तिके ग्रामस्य। अभ्याशे  
ग्रामस्य। दूरन्ति कार्थेभ्यश्चतस्रो विभक्तयो भवन्ति,  
द्वितीयातृतीयापञ्चमीसप्तम्यः।।  
  
He may be refering to this rule. Here षष्ठी and पञ्चमी also appear following:  
  
दूरान्तिकार्थेभ्यो द्वितीया च २।३।३५\|  
  
दूरं ग्रामस्य, दूराद् ग्रामस्य, दूरेण् ग्रामस्य।  
  
with these, षष्ठी is variable with पञ्चमी the collocated word.  
  
दूरान्तिकार्थैः षष्ठ्यन्यतरस्याम्॥ २।३।३४  
  
दूरं ग्रामस्य, दूरं ग्रामात्।  
  
So totally षष्ठी, पञ्चमी, सप्तमी variable with द्वितीया, and पञ्चमी।  
  
But all this related in collocation of दूरान्तिकर्थ and the relative word.
