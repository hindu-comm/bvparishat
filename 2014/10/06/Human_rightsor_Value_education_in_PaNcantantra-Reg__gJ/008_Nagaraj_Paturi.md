AadaraNIya Abhyankarji,



1\. न्यायin न्यायदर्शनः is not justice of English.



 What I said is :



 The historians of the concept of human rights opine that in theancient Greek thought, it existed in the form of justice later as natural justice and even

 later as natural right.





2\. But you are right . One of the things Panchatantra has is interpersonal relations. There are already studies on



-   leadership skills -   interpersonal skills -   war strategies -   management strategies -   administrative strategies -   political strategies etc.

in Panchatantra. I can share the bibliography if necessary.



3\. Manusmriti and Arthashastra belong to two different categories of books. Their contents too are different. Whereas the contents of Arthashastra and Panchatantra have common areas in management/administrative strategies.
