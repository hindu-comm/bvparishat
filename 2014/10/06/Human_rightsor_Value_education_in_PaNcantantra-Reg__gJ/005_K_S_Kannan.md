Ludwik Sternbach's writing entitled "the Panchatantra and the Smrtis" appeared in the 1946 issues of the journal Bharatiya Vidya. This may have some material useful for you as it deals with the legal issues therein.

Walter Ruben has also written about Panchatantra, but from the communist point of view.
