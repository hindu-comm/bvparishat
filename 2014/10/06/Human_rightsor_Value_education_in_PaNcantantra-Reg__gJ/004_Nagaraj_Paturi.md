1\. The historians of the concept of human rights opine that in theancient Greek thought, it existed in the form of justice later as natural justice and even later as natural right. Something similar can be said about the idea of human rights in ancient India too. Ancient Indian ideas of justice as part of the ideas of Dharma are precursors of the contemporary idea of human rights in ancient India. So, if you find any studies on Dharma in Panchatantra, those may have justice aspects i.e. human rights aspects.



2\. Panchatantra though is more a book of administrative strategies, it has been called a book of morals and also a book of ethics throughout.Though there is a delicate difference between morals and ethics, these two words have been used interchangeably. 



3\. Of late, there are many studies on Panchatantra from a management strategy or public administration strategy point of view.



4\. Panchatantra is a book meant for education only. An unparalleled pedagogy of teaching administrative strategiesthrough animal tales. But is it value-education? Both Arthashastra and Panchatantra do not neglect values while instructing strategies.

But whether the placegiven for values in these books of strategic instruction has been studied or not needs to bestudied.
