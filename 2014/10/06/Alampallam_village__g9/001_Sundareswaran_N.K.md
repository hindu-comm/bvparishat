Dear Sir,

Yes, I hail from Nochur (an agrahaaram), a village, some 10 kilometers from Alampallam. आलम्पळ्ळ्म्is one of the many agrahaaram-s of Palghat. Agrahaarams are settlements of Tamil Brahmins in Kerala. Locally these are called ग्रामम् s. There were many learned scholars well versed in different Shaastra-s and other vedic lore, once.

I am proud to state that I belong to such a family of Vedaadhyain-s and Yaajnika-s. My forefathers (up to my प्रपितामह ) were Somayaajins. My father is a शूराध्यायी of the Taittiriya Shakha. He is now 94 years old. And still reciting ब्रह्मयज्ञ प्रश्न daily.

I had my schooling and graduation at Nochur. And now am staying in Calicut town.

I will be very happy to share whatever I know about आलम्पळ्ळ्म् with you sir.

nks
