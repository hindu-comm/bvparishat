«Pāṇini et les Pāṇinéens des XVIe - XVIIe siècles»

«Pāṇini and the Pāṇinians of the 16th-17th centuries»



Organizers F. Grimal, J.E.M. Houben, S.Lakshminarasimham



This third international seminar of the ANR project on Pāṇini and the Pāṇinians of the 16th-17th centuries brings together collaborators in the project and invited speakers from India and abroad to contribute to the broad theme of the project, after the seminars in two preceding years which dealt with more specific problematics

\[15-20 October 2012: Pre-Prakriyā-grantha Prakriyā: the system of word derivation before the Prakriyā-grantha works; 21-25 October 2013: The Grammatical Example (udāharaṇa) between grammar (vyākaraṇa), lexicon (śabda-kośa) and verbal usage (laukika-prayoga)\].

Accordingly, the theme of the seminar is Pāṇinian Sanskrit grammar and especially its history in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the approximately 4.000 aphorisms of the Aṣṭādhyāyī (all eight chapters), which make up the work of Pāṇini (ca. 4th century before our era) were presented by several of the exegetes of this grammar in a new arrangement which emphasized the notion of derivation (prakriyā). This grammar, indeed, explains the formation of words, step by step, through their constitutive elements identified beforehand. The notion of derivation eminently characterises the complex system which this grammar represents. Two major works of this period which receive special attention are: the Prakriyā-sarvasva (The encyclopaedia of derivation) of Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa and the Siddhānta-kaumudī (The elucidation of doctrine) of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita. Within the project, these two works have been the object of two original tasks: to undertake the analysis and study of the Prakriyā-sarvasva, and to make explicit in the most comprehensive and detailed way — in the form of a dictionary of examples — the functioning of the Pāṇinian system and its field of application such as they have been presented in the Siddhāntakaumudī.
