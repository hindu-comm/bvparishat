Śabdakalpadrumaḥ also says both forms are correct.

Under और्द्ध्वदेहिक,

और्द्ध्वदैहिकम् इत्यपि स्यात्

Another thing to note is that the sources show ठञ् in और्द्ध्वदेहिक and ठक् in और्द्ध्वदैहिक.

So if we conclude that Mallinātha is wrong, then so are all of Govindarāja, Maheśvaratīrtha, Śivasahāya, and the authors of Śabdakalpadrumaḥ and Vācaspatyam, in their explanations of the forms as used by Vālmīki or Kālidāsa. All of them being wrong at this place is a bit difficult to accept. It may help to check what Nīlakaṇṭha has said (if anything) on the usages in Bhārata.  

Patañjali has stated the form और्द्ध्वदेहिक, but has not explicitly ruled out the dual-vṛddhi form और्द्ध्वदैहिक.
