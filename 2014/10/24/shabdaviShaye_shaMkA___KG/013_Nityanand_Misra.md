Another reference on this - please see attached snapshot of the commentary रघुवंशदर्पणः by हेमाद्रि on the verse in रघुवंशः  
  
All the ten learned commentators on रामायण (three), रघुवंश (two) and अमरकोष (five) who I have cited on this thread use अनुशतिकादि to explain the form as Paninian and nobody uses पृषोदरादि to explain the word. If we disagree, then either all ten of them are wrong, or our understanding is wrong. One way to reconcile the commentators's view with Prof. Korada's view is to assume of two different words (not two optional forms of same word). One word does not have उभयपदवृद्धि, and that is the one used by पतञ्जलि in महाभाष्य. The other word has उभयपदवृद्धि, and that is the one used by वाल्मीकि, अमरकोष and कालिदास. Something line हिनस्तीति सिंहः (by पृषोदरादि) and हिनस्तीति हिंसः are two different words, not optional forms of same word.  
  
Another way could be to use different suffixes for the two forms - ठक् and ठञ्.  
  
Still another way could be to say that outside the sense of that ordained by the वार्त्तिक, उभयपदवृद्धि is possible. Then one can say ऊर्ध्वदेहे भवम् और्ध्वदेहिकम्, ऊर्ध्वदेहाय साधु और्ध्वदैहिकम्.  
  
The objections raised by Prof. Korada for अनुशतिकादि argument also apply to पृषोदरादि argument, since both are आकृतिगणs. Maybe that is why none of the learned commentators went for पृषोदरादि route (none of them said the form is आर्ष or non-Paninian too).
