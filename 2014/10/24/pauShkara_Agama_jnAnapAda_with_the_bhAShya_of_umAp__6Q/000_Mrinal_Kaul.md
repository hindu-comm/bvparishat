I have been looking for a digital copy of the following title, but failed to find it on any online source.  
  
\<Pauṣkara Āgama (Jñānapāda) with the Bhāṣya of Umāpati Śivācārya (in Grantha script), Gr. ed. with Tamil introduction by Ambalavana Naval, 8 paṭalas 972 ślokas, 1925. Chidambaram>  
  
Would someone be kind enough to bring my attention to some source I am missing or is this title not digitalized at all.  
  
Thanks very much for the help in advance.
