Dear scholar friends,  
  

Hope all had good Diwali. Though the Indian community has moved a long way in my  

forty years abroad, we still do not have a public celebration of Diwali. George Bush  

made a political gesture to host in White House. Obama is more sincere, but quite  

a distance to go.  
  

I begin a new thread to focus on the research topics. I am grateful to all the previous  
mails including the admonitions. I realize how small I am to think of these kinds  
of projects. To me it is an effort as a parent and as an observer living abroad.  
  

Topics that have surfaced are:  

1. Exploration on Indian musicology to learn the evolution of the note-based voice rendering.  

 (Dr. R.N. Iyengar)  

2. Research on the phonology of the syllables (Dr. N. R. Joshi)  

3. Concept of zero in Indian literature (Dr. R. N. Iyengar)  
  

For a number of reasons, I want to stay focused on Sanskrit and the languages.  

The principal reason in my mind is that would be easier to deal by the students.  
We have to explore fundamental topics that would challenge the student with the  
available curriculum in the High School. Hopefully we would aim to attract one  
percent of the new graduates to think on these topics of sound, voice, communication,  

music and literature.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
