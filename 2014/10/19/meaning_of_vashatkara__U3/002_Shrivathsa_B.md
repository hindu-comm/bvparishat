hariH OM,  
  
In a yaj\~na, the following happens (my humble prostrations to my R^igveda AchArya, shrii kR^iShNabhaTTa ghanapAThI who gave me, a worthless person, an opportunity to be an Agniidhra in a yaj\~na and be able to mumble the following):  

1\. The adhvaryu (expert in yajurveda) asks the Agniidhra (a person who is given the responsibility of driving away duShTa shaktis.) to look around (and ensure that there are no rAkShasas to disturb the yaj\~na). For this, he utters the word: AshrAvaya or O shrAvaya (make us listen).  

2\. The Agniidhra gives his consent by saying astu = may it be, shrauShaT = the word which removes duShTa shaktis. He has a wooden sword with him which he brings down ceremonially while pronouncing so.  
3. After listening to shrauShaT, the adhvaryu tells the hotaa (expert in R^igveda) to recite the shastra (shastra not shaastra. shastra is the recitation of R^igvedic mantras in a monotone ending with OM). the order given by the adhvaryu is "yaja" = may you call the devas.

4\. the hotaa accedes to the order and says, "ye yajAmahe" = here we invite.

5\. after the shastra is pronounced, he finishes it by saying OM and vauShaT. concurrent to hearing of vauShaT, the adhvaryu gives Ahuti to agni.

  

vauShaT and vaShaT are the same.  
  

**Why should viShNu be called vaShaTkAra?**  

चतुर्भिश्च चतुर्भिश्च द्वाभ्यां पञ्चभिरेव च।  
हूयते च पुनर्द्वाभ्यां स मे विष्णुः प्रसीदतु॥  
  

The one who is called by four syllables (A shrAvaya), four syllables (astu shrauShaT), two syllables (yaja), 5 syllables (ye yajAmahe), and again by two syllables (vauShaT), such a viShNu be happy with me.  

So, no matter which of these words you use, you are calling viShNu only. yaj\~no vai viShNuH (taittiriya sam. 1.7.4) i.e. verily, viShNu is yaj\~na and verily yaj\~na is viShNu.  

  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
