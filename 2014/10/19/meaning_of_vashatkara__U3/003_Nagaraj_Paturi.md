What a wealth of information! I can not tell you how indebted I am for this ethnography based on participant observation!



After recollecting and rereading the theoretical material on the word vashatkara, believe me I was praying, 'how I wish some S'routi gave an authentic account of this great Vedic expression'. When I read your post, I felt my prayers were granted.



The theoretical stuff is:



1\. (The S'ankarabhashya page supplied by aadaraNIya Nityanandji already covered the following): vaṣaṭkāra = vau+ṣaṭ + kāra.



2\. vaṣaṭkāra is considered to be one of the 33 devatas ( The Soma-drinking gods are : eight Vasus, eleven Budras, twelve Adityas, Prajapati, and Vashat-kara. )



3\. I was contemplating on the beauty ofidea of a Vedic recitation being taken as a divinity and ultimately being equated with the ultimate concept of Viṣṇu.



Thanks again. Thanks a lot.
