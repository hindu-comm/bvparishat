Respected Shri Chetan Pandey Sir,

  

I really thank you from the bottom of my heart for presenting me and all of other readers with a perfectly readable copy of Shri Param Shambhu Mahimna Stotra in the PDF form. You have made it quite easy and accessible for me (or any one else) to have a fine copy of the stotra in Devanagari script which was perhaps impossible to possess. The readers who are interested will always acknowledge your relentless efforts to bring it to notice.

  

I was unaware of the fact that you are connected to the scribd uploader - indologicalbooks. Now that I am able to know this, I again thank you heartily for providing me as well as others with rare and priceless uploaded books relating to Tantra, Religion, Culture, History, etc. You have really made a utmost precious and elaborate contribution to the readers. It is because of benevolent and readerfriendly uploaders like you, Ajit Gargeshwari ji , Arun Upadhyaya ji , etc. that we are gifted with most useful e-books which otherwise I don't think we could have got any closer to.

  

It is the persons like you that I and other likeminded people will always continue to gain inspiration and motivation from to carry out the work on similar lines and to provide the society with the essential service of GYANDAANA.

  

  

Thanking You,

  

Yours Faithfully,

  

Tarang Deshpande.
