Respected Members,

  

There is a stotra of 140+ verses composed by Shri Sage Durvasa known asParashambhu Mahimna Sthuti. Is there any way of getting this stotra in devanagari script either by soft copy or hard copy? Can anyone please help me out?

  

  

  

Yours,

  

Faithfully,

  

Tarang Deshpande.
