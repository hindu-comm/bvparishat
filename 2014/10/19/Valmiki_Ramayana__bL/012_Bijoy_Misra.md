Dear Dr Vasukeya,  

Actually I have not translated the first few chapters.  

Translation was not in my plans. When I found  

arbitrariness I started somewhere at Chapter X or so.  
  

Let us examine the above.

  
को न्वस्मिन्साम्प्रतं लोके गुणवान्कश्च वीर्यवान् \|  
धर्मज्ञश्च कृतज्ञश्च सत्यवाक्यो दृढव्रतः \|\| २\|\|  
  

“In all this world, I pray thee, who

Is virtuous, heroic, true?

Firm in his vows, of grateful mind,

To every creature good and kind?  
  

You can see how weak the translation is.  

The (first cut) prose translation could be:  

Do you know of anyone at the present time in our universe who is  

virtuous as well as valorous, who is at the same time principled, grateful, truthful in words and steadfast in his vows?  
  

Once you get the first cut, you can refine further. You can add rhyme.  
  
You can check the difference the two sentences.  

A poet has a thought, the words carry the thought. We have to extract the thought.  
  

"Who is heroic?" is different than "Is there anyone there whom we can call heroic?"  

The second sentences defines what "heroic" qualifier is in the poet's eye. The first is nominal. (every day a dozen "heroes" come in TV)  

  

Sanskrit is compact. A few words can say a lot. A stanza in Sanksrit can expand to several sentences in English.  

My point is that a translator must be loyal to the poet to protect the thought.  
  

I experiment this with a India Poets' Group I started at Harvard twenty years ago.  

My father was a poet, I have hard time translating him. Rabindranath did his own.  

  

As I said I have not studied Keith's work. The above is my general observations on Sanskrit to English translations.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
