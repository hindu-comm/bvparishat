Dear friend scholars,  

Happy Diwali.  

While I continue to prod you on my previous request on the  

pointers in research for the undergraduate students, I wish  
to add another request. It is on Valmiki.  

Valmiki Ramayana has fascinated me. Please write to me  
here or offline If any of you have done studies on the literature  
and poetics of Valmiki's creation. You may also give any link  

of any critical studies in India that you may be aware of. Let  
me also confess that I am thoroughly disappointed with some  
of the writings on the topic I have seen here in the west. They  
appear dull and superficial.  

Thank you for your help.
