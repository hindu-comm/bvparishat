Dear Vijayji,  
  

You have made a passing observation as follows::

I have not examined the history of language conversions,

To my mind, the language conversion is the most important aspect one has to keep in mind. The meaning and usage of the words / terms do change with time. For example the word "varsha" in Ramayana times was used to mean "day" and not year Just to give and example one finds translations of ancient texts where some rishis were said to be doing tapasya for several thousand years, which is humanly impossible. Not only that, the misinterpretation of the word "varsha" led to misinterprettion of the Yuga scale in the Siddhanta texts and that in turn made people believe that Chaturyuga is 4,320,000 years long and that also makes Lord Ram a mythical person, born some million years ago.  
  

I shall not go into the details of these, as my point here is to draw the attention of the scholars that the interpretation of the old texts have to done carefully and not just see whether it meets the Paninian rules.  
  

Regards,
