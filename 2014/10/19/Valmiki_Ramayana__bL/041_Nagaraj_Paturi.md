Prof. Bijoy Misraji made an interesting proposal during the course of this thread:



"In order to translate a poem, we have to feel that joy. This joy is not "feeling good"  

or "understand," but an alignment with the poet. I call this "rasa" and do

  
neurological research on the advent of "rasa" in humans."



"I call this "rasa""leads toproblems because 'Rasa' is a well established technical term. So we can not use it in a different sense than what it connotes technically in the s'aastra where it belongs. If it is being used in the same established sense as established in the s'aastra, then the proposal that the translator gets into and needs to get into the 'Rasa' intended by the author of the translated work is anyway given.



The biggest difficulty in the poetic translations from Sanskrit to English in the s'raavyataa aspect only. Another problem is translating from an oral tradition to a literate tradition. Post-printing technology literate literary creations anticipate /orient themselves to silent reading, मौनपठनम्. Poetic works of oral societies/traditions/times are predominantly recitation-oriented and recitation-dependent.
