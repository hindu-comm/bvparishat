A Sahruydaya can get Tatparya or better understanding of a kavya or a nataka with the aid of alamkara shastra and vyakarna which eventually leads to rasa anubhava. Rasa anubhava can even be spontaneous on seeing a play or hearing a good verse. How Rasa anubhava happens or is experienced is discussed by many alankara Shastra writers. Music and singing of verses has got to do more with devotion and is content independent. Bhakti Bhava may also lead to bliss. Even if I don't understand Latin language I still can go to bliss if I hear nice Latin verses sung by a good singer. That does not mean a singer or a person listening to music is a real sahrudaya who has understood the poet or what the poet intended to covey. Whether Bhakti is a rasa ashta and nava rasa theories are disputed concepts in alamkara Shastra
