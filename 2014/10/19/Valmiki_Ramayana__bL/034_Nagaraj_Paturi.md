1.BhaavOchita verse-singing does not need any trainingin s'aastreeya sangeeta though knowing s'aastreeya sangeeta maygive an advantage in this regard.



2\. But its aid as a शक्तिग्रह is only disputed

------Singing as the non-verbal component of s'ravyakaavya performance does not have a role in the arthagrahaNa of the paaTha of the text. Svara does have arole in arthagrahaNa. Intonation does have a role in arthagrahaNa. bhaavOchita verse-singing takes care of such artha-communicating non-verbal aspects of uttering.Rasaanubhava is not limited to arthagrahaNa. That is why I said, "Singing out the s'ravyakaavya textis a non-verbal component of the s'ravyakaavya performance. This plays as important a role as abhinaya in the drs'yakaavya performance."



3\. OK.Dr. HN Bhat himself said earlier in this thread itself, "Valmiki is the first poet and the first singers of his poetry were Lava and Kusha, who spread it by singing it all around and reached Ayodhya." Does the singing of Lava and Kus'a have significance or not ? or Was that not required? Is it not appropriate to imagine that the singing of Lava and Kus'a was not limited to metre-based singing aloud but was also a bhaavOchita singing to create the emotional effect and ecstasy intended by vaalmeeki among the audience?



4.In a classical music concert, dhaatu and maatu play their own roles. The meaningful text part of the maatu does play an important role and that controls even the composition of the dhaatu. But that is a different issue. That is totally a different issue than the singing of a s'ravyakaavya.
