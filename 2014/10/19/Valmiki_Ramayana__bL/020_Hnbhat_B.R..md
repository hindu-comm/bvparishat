Of course, I am not a poet nor a singer. Ramayana is a poetry and I have learnt how to understand and enjoy a poetry as taught by Anandavardhanacarya, the कविसहृदयचक्रवर्ती. Valmiki is the first poet and the first singers of his poetry were Lava and Kusha, who spread it by singing it all around and reached Ayodhya.  

  

Music is singing the poetry, which is composed in any language. And enjoyment of Singing Music piece, need not have any knowledge of grammar or language, but the experience of Enjoy the musical composition.

  

It has been said:

  

शिशुर्वेत्ति पशुर्वेत्ति वेत्ति गानरसं फणी।

साहित्यरसमाधुर्यं शङ्करो वेत्ति वा न वा।।  

  

You can stick to your opinion that both are same. I have my view confirmed from literary sources I have read.

  

  

काव्यस्यात्मा स एवार्थस्तथा चादिकवेः पुरा .

क्रौञ्चद्वन्द्ववियोगोत्थः शोकः श्लोकत्वमागतः .. ५..

  

This is the opinion of Anandavardhanacharya, about the feeling of the poet becoming a poetry on the example of the same Valmiki and the very same Ramayana. You may your own opinion.

  

Both are compared and contrasted in a single verse:

  

संगीतमथ साहित्यं सरस्वत्या स्तनद्वयम्।

एकमापातमधुरमन्यदालोचनामृतम्।"
