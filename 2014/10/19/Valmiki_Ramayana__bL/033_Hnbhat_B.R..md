I myself have read almost all the texts I had to learn aloud, and I myself can enjoy the भाव or रस through the verbal representation of the words, but I do not know the a,b,c,d of music or संगीतशास्त्र. But it could be read according to the metrical arrangement and if the verses and enjoyed and sung independently. But its aid as a शक्तिग्रह is only disputed. Beyond verbal expression, every thing is नादब्रह्म and enjoyed like the bliss. शक्तिग्रह belongs to the अपोद्धर of अखण्डस्फोट and ध्वन्याचार्य knows it also, as Abhinavaguptacharya, confirms who is also a philosopher like आनन्दवर्धन and commented on the रससूत्र and consolidated views on रसास्वाद up to his time. "अभिधा भावना चैव तद्भोगीकृतिरेव च" which calls for भावना to appreciate the रस in a poetry. "शब्दार्थौ सत्कविरिव द्वयं विद्वानपेक्षते।" is the position of माघ. "रमणीयार्थप्रतिपादकः शब्दः" which is a refined definition of a poetry by Dandin, "शरीरं तावदिष्टार्था पदावली" which was prior to the recognition of ध्वनि as "काव्यस्यात्मा स एवार्थः" which is different from the शरीर of काव्य.

  

If it singing only could be the source of भाव, without शक्तिग्रह in a poetry or an independent means of शक्तिग्रह in a poetry, what is it that is enjoyed by the listeners enjoying of Carnatic Music composed in different languages other than Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil, Karnataka? Of course one receives the भाव or some रस, by listening to the शात्रीयसंगीत, composed in different languages, than the audience knows and has शक्तिग्रह from the Verbal composition? Certainly it could not be the रस, or भाव-s presented by the verbal expression as a language as the audience could not be expected to know all the languages in which कृति-s as the musical compositions are generally called and not as a काव्य. This much was meant. And तात्पर्य or defined the "; "वक्तुरिच्छा तु तात्पर्यं परिकीर्तितम् Bhāṣā P.84" should be grasped through अभिधा, and भावना, excepting लक्षणा, तात्पर्य (which is a शब्दवृत्ति) or व्यञ्जना.

प्रतीयमानं पुनरन्यदेव वस्त्वस्ति वाणीषु महाकवीनाम् ।

यत्तत्प्रसिद्धावयवातिरिक्तं विभाति लावण्यमिवाङ्गनासु ॥ कारिका१.४ ॥

  

The dispute between अभिधा and व्यञ्जना has been solved by भोज as follows:

  

  

तात्पर्यमेव वचसि ध्वनिरेव काव्ये सौभाग्यमेव गुणसंपदि वल्लभस्य।

सावण्यमेव वपुषि स्वदतेऽङ्गनायाः श्रृङ्गार एव हृदि मानवतो जनस्य।। 5 ।। in his शृङ्गारप्रकाश.

  

retaking the same comparison of आनन्दवर्धन. व्यञ्जना is established as शब्दवृत्ति, extending the scope of verbal expression. And रस is expressed through व्यञ्जनावृत्ति itself, in so far as it is within the scope of शब्दवृत्ति by Anandavardhana.
