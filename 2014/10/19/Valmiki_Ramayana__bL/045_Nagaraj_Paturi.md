The literature suggests that "rasa" is an effect,  

but I find the use of the concept is cosmological.



Where did you find the cosmological use of the concept of Rasa? Are you talking of रसो वै सः of Taittireeyopanishad by any chance? Dr. Bijoyji , please remember that aalankaarikas resisted the use of the word rasa in a spiritual sense. For them it is purely art-related, aesthetic and non-religious, non-spiritual.Those who reject Rasa status to S'aanta Rasa or Bhakti Rasa do it on this basis only.Those who accept Rasa status to S'aanta or Bhakti use the word Rasa in a different sense than those who reject Rasa status to those two. You might want to go through the debates on these issues thoroughly before delving into any cosmological concept of Rasa. If your use of the word cosmological is in a different sense than I understood, you might want to articulate it in a way understandable to readers like me.



The statement "I think that "rasa" is built in any composition  

that helps streamline thoughts for communication."



is too loose to be reflecting rigorous understanding of theaalankaarika the idea of Rasa.



Moreover, Rasa is considered to be in Anukarta or Anukaarya or Saamaajika all human individuals but in the composition. (Of course neurology of human individuals only can be studied but not of the composition. May be you mean the ability to generate Rasa is built in composition.



"The ideas incorporate  

Sankhya into the modern research in neurology. I title in Rasa-sankhya."



Youprobably mean Saankhya. Your title probably is Rasa-saankhya. This care is required because there is a huge debate already on Rasa-sankhyaa.



Neurology of emotions, neurology of emotional experiences of audiences of literature and literary performing arts is imaginable.



Bringing Saankhya into that discussion is challenging. I don't think you are unaware of the rigorous homework in various fields involvedit demands.
