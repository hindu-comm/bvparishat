It is true that "Rasa anubhava can even be spontaneous on seeing a play or hearing a good verse"



"How Rasa anubhava happens or is experienced is discussed by many alankara Shastra writers."



But none of them indicate that



"A Sahruydaya can get Tatparya or better understanding of a kavya or a nataka with the aid of alamkara shastra and vyakarna which eventually leads to rasa anubhava"



"Music and singing of verses has got to do more with devotion and is content independent. Bhakti Bhava may also lead to bliss."



----Then in that case, what is



पाद बद्धः अक्षर समः तन्त्री लय समन्वितः \|  
शोकार्तस्य प्रवृत्तो मे श्लोको भवतु न अन्यथा \|\| १-२-१८ ?



Was that not s'oka ? Was that bhakti?



and was the singing of RaamaayaNa byLava and Kus'a devotional?
