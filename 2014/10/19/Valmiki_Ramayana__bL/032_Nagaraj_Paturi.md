but repetition increases the melody and get the verses by heart by reading aloud



Role of versification as an aid for memorization is not disputed. In the case of non-poetic verse works, role of metre could be said to be limited only as a memorization-aid. But in the case of poetic works it is not limited to memorization aspect. Singing is in addition to the inherent musicality secured by the metre. BhaavOchita singing of verses of poetic works is a well established tradition in India (probably in other countries too) and can not be said to be without purpose.



Repeated singing for memorization is different from bhaavOchita singing out performance of a poetic verse-text for an audience or for one's own enjoyment.



Independence of efficacy of music from textual aidis also not disputed.



Application of S'aktigraha to rasanishpatti of s'ravyakaavya comes under the application of schools such as anumitivaada of rasanishpatti to s'ravyakaavya. Even that does not come in the way of role of singing out of the text in rasanishpatti because these schools recognize the role of abhinaya of anukarta in the rasanishpattiby arguing that processes such as anumaanagenerate the rasa and anumaana is done from the units of both verbal and non-verbal communication. Singing out the s'ravyakaavya textis a non-verbal component of the s'ravyakaavya performance. This plays as important a role as abhinaya in the drs'yakaavya performance. Just as a drs'yakaavya text composing poet composes the text depending on the abhinaya of the text, s'ravyakaavya text-composing poet too composes the text depending on/ expecting/ anticipatingthe singing out of his text and s'raavyataa resulting from it.
