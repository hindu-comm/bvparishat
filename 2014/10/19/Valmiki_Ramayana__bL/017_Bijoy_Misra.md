Dear Prof Korada,  

I love the post. What I request all translators is not to rush.  

We have to appreciate the compositional process first. We have to observe  

how words evolve in us through intense absorption and insight.
Composition  

words "appear" to us, the process continues to remain undefined. There is a  
melody. Melody contains stress and intonation. Sound is an expression.  
We observe part of it when a poet recites his own poem. There is a joy of expression  

which mirrors the original joy of composition.  

In order to translate a poem, we have to feel that joy. This joy is not "feeling good"  

or "understand," but an alignment with the poet. I call this "rasa" and do  

neurological research on the advent of "rasa" in humans. I will present part of  
this work in World Sanskrit Conference at Bangkok next year.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
