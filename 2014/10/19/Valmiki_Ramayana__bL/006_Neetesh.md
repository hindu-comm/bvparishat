Misra ji,

  

Namaste,

  

Glad to see your selfless effort, i cannot contribute anything as of now however i found the follwoing blog which i feel provides authentic info on events in Ramayan, as i feel the Tulsi Ramayan with agni pariksha and Luv Kush details were injected by Britishers to malign our scriptures.

  

Hope this helps.

i am convinced with the arguments in the blog however not averse to new thoughts. i find the author of the blog (Ajit Vadakayil) very informative and authentic (i found it when i read his other articles on his blog) so thought of sharing this info with you in your noble cause.

  

Pranam

Neetesh
