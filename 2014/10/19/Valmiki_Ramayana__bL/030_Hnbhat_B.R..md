The question whether the question whether the poet composed the lyric orally first and then some of his students put down the poetry in writing is a different thing. We have to assume either the art of writing is a later invention according to the history of writing or as the script named Brahmi Lipi, is invented by Brahma himself, which could be available to our sages. In both cases, the words have written form after the invention of writing, and according to the history of civilization, the development of script took a long time of duration. Whether spoken language or written language, the process of conveying of meaning is the same. No singing is needed for understand the contents, from the written content and vice versa. Only the prior condition is that one has get the शक्तिग्रह from the written or spoken words. Singing of a poetry is its spoken form and the written form of the language as I had explained and व्यवहार is the शक्तिग्राहकशिरोमणि, according to मीमांसक-s and नैयायिक-s. The means of the शक्तिग्रह is described in भाषापरिच्छेद as follows:

  

शक्तिग्रहं व्याकरणोपमानकोशाप्तवाक्याद् व्यवहारतश्च।

वाक्यस्य शेषाद् विवृतेर्वदन्ति सान्निध्यतः सिद्धपदस्य वृद्धाः।।  

  

व्यवहार is the spoken form of the language in daily usage. This may be the metrical form or prose form, the metrical form used for daily speech is less likely. And singing of the poetry is not anyof the means of शक्तिग्रह, but repetition increases the melody and get the verses by heart by reading aloud. But it is different from the means of शक्तिग्रह called व्यवहार. Now it is the invention of Bijoy Mishra that repetition of the poetry adds to the meaning to be understand the poet's intention. Good Invention. But that doesn't decrease the importance of the other means of शक्तिग्रह.

  

I have heard of many claimes of the medical effects of singing and some experiments on the growth of plants with and without music, and the difference in growth rate was higher. The plants do not know the words or their meanings or Rasa-s derived from the शब्द, अर्थ,and both and purely by the context, गतोऽस्तमर्को भातीन्दुर्यान्ति वासाय पक्षिणः। which simply conveys different meaning by hearing to it. Dandin and Bhamaha differ themselves whether this piece is a poetry or not.

There are many such claims on different pages on the web.

  

वक्तृबोद्धव्यकाकूनां वाक्यवाच्यान्यसन्निधेः ॥ काप्र-२१ ॥

प्रस्तावदेशकालादेर्वैशिष्ट्यात् प्रतिभाजुषाम् ।

यो ऽर्थस्यान्यार्थधीहेतुर्व्यापारो व्यक्तिरेव सा ॥ काप्र-२२ ॥  

  

The simultaneous sphontaneous conveying the meaning of any sentence metrical or non-metrical sentence, is described in the following verse quoted in भाषापरिच्छेद-

  

वृद्धा युवानः शिशवः कपोताः खले यथाऽमी युगपत् पतन्ति ।

तथैव सर्वे युगपत्पदार्थाः परस्परेणान्वयिनो भवन्ति ॥
