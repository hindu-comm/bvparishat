दण्डक is not prose anyhow. It is verse itself, without पादनियम, that is all, but each पाद is composed with गण-s like any पाद verse. In चम्पूः, also there are proses and and verses also. Even without reading aloud, one can understand enjoy the रस, भाव, व्यभिचारिभाव and रसध्वनि also. If both are sang melodiously, the melody itself could be enjoyed appealing to the ears. This is the intention of the quotation:

  

शिशुर्वेत्ति पशुर्वेत्ति वेत्ति गानरसं फणी।

  

for which we have examples from daily life also. Listening to the lulubies, children are sleeping enjoying the melody, and for पशु, the lute of श्रीकृष्ण is examples, which attracted the cows when he sang his lute. The last could not be attested, which could be a myth in general. But the playing the flute, makes the serpent to move its hood to and frow. This may be a false belief as the serpents do not have hearing organs, but receives only the vibrations, through its skin as I am told. But Indian belief is that the serpent is using its eyes as the hearing organ as the name चक्षुःश्रवाः। That does not mean they do not have any lyrics. The emphasis is on enjoying the melody and the music.

  

The same was said by the other example:\\

  

संगीतमथ साहित्यं सरस्वत्याः स्तनद्वयम्।

एकमातमधुरमन्यदालोचनामृतम्।

  

which shows the diffence in the enjoyment of music. The emphasis is on the musical comosition, than the composition of the lyrics and that does not mean there should be any lyrics without words.

  

This is traditional view. The musical rendition would be better appreciated, if emphasis is given to the lyrics and by those who know the language of the lyrics. This is a fact. Many do not give emphasis to the composition of the lyrics, as they themselves do not know Sanskrit language and many a times wrongly spelt. But they have audience equally enjoying the melody and the composition of music. Only earlier generation singers, have some knowledge of Sanskrit, but not enough to reflect them in their singing before an audience who do not at all any knowledge of Sanskrit, or the language of the lyrics. Many great singers play with the सप्तस्वर-s only withut any meaningful words in themselves, which represent the the names of the स्वर-s and people with music compositions enjoy them.

  

The short and long of the quotations quoted by me is this, The गानरस and साहित्यरस are different and enjoyed differently. And not that there could be रस, भाव-s, स्थायिभाव only in the verbal composition and not in musical composition excepting the composition lyrics.

  

Scholars and Musicians members could offer their different opinion like Channulal Mishra and Nityananda Mishra.

  

उच्चरितः शब्दः प्रत्यायको भवति नानुच्चरितः इति महाभाष्यकारवचनम्। which emphasis on the pronounciation of the words to give meaning which can be taken in support of the lyrics in a musical composition.

  

And "बौद्धः शब्दः बौद्धश्चार्थः"

  

is another view. When we read from the graphical presentation of the वर्ण-s, the meaning is understood without reciting aloud. For argument, there too one can understand as one reads himself in audible representations of the वर्ण-s in his mind, without pronouncing them
physically. That is how the silent reading of a book, gives the meaning for the words in the book without reading aloud.
