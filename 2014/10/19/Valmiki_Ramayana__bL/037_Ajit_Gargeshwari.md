I have already given my views. If one still insists that instead of reading using the aids understanding canons of Alankara Shastra and Vyakarna and other shastric aids are not good enough aids to understand kavyas but one needs to keep singing them I have nothing to add. That will be music and not kavya appreciation Singing of Ramayana of Ramayana by Lava and Kusha was an act of devotion
