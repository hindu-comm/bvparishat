I totally agree with Prof Korada and love his insight. While all the requisite tools  
might not get ready, what I request all translators is not to rush.  

We have to appreciate the compositional process first. We have to observe  

how words evolve in us through intense absorption and insight.
Composition  

words "appear" to us, the process continues to remain undefined. The word is  
the culmination of the internal tools that Prof Korada so beautifully explained.  
The word has an inner connectivity. There is a melody. Melody contains stress  
and intonation. Sound becomes an expression. I have read various texts on the subject,  
but these statements are from my own experimentation during the last thirty years.  
  
We observe part of this meditative energy when a poet recites his own poem.  

There is a joy of expression which mirrors the original joy of composition.  

In order to translate a poem, we have to feel that joy. This joy is not "feeling good"  

or "understand," but an alignment with the poet. I call this "rasa" and lately do  

neurological research on the advent of "rasa" in humans. I will present part of  
this work in World Sanskrit Conference at Bangkok next year.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
