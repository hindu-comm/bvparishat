I am grateful to Prof Paturi to have noticed the point that in my mind.
While I am aware  

through my readings of literature on the technical use of "rasa" it is the advent of "rasa" that  

has interested me variously for a few years. The literature suggests that "rasa" is an effect,  

but I find the use of the concept is cosmological. I think that "rasa" is built in any composition  

that helps streamline thoughts for communication. I will be writing the paper later this month  
and I can send advance copies to scholars if you write me off list. The ideas incorporate  

Sankhya into the modern research in neurology. I title in Rasa-sankhya.  

Best regards,  

BM
