This your imaginatio of what the poet in his mind. To compare with the original word Sanskrit and your translation, the difference is great.

  

Whom we call heroic, is different cannotation. It would convey that who is called heroic, but not a real hero. The word "hero" you have confused with the hero-s you can see in the TV-s, whereas the original word वीर्यवान् means who is valorous, or powerful. which is never conveyed by your far fetched English translation. The same with other adjectives which could be used both as adjectives and nouns. Both languages have limitations of their own in the usage of adjectives and nouns.

  

One should have first hand experience with both the language and not any random experience in one or both languages enough find errors.
