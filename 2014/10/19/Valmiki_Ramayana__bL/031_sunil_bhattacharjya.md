Namaste,  
  

You have made a passing mention about the beginning of writing, I have a query. If this query needs a separate tread, kindly advise. The query is that, to my knowledge, the Aitareya aranyaka (if I am not mistaken) makes a reference to writing. Does it not show that Vedic rishis knew how to write ?  
  

Regards,
