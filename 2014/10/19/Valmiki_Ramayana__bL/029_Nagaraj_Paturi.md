1\. Dr. Prasad probably remembered a genre of stotra literature in Telugu called 'gadya' (e.g. 'aksharaankagadya' by paalkuriki somanaathuDu) or 'vachanamulu' (e.g. simhagirinaraharivachanamulu by KrishNamaachaaryulu) which appears to be prose from the name of the genre andits style of writing but is in fact read out in a kind of a singing style and mentioned it by mistake 'dandakamu'.Dr. H N Bhat is right in saying that dandaka is in fact a metre. (It runs in continuous flow of either all ta gaNas or all ra gaNas or ra gaNas with additional conditions on beginnings and endings.)



2\. The word s'ravya kaavya itself indicates that such kaavya is meant for reading out and to be heard from the read out version. That the author of a s'ravya kaavya composes his work expecting a certain rendition in the form of reading out (singing out for a verse book) goes without saying. That the generation of intended rasa in the sahrdyya-audience of a sravya kaavya comes can besuccessful only through the reading (singing ) out rendition of it in the style expected by the author is alsoimplied in this obvious nature of a s'ravya kaavya.



3\. That Aanandavardhanaachaarya's attemptand following him, Abhinavaguptapaada's attempt wastocreate a rasanishpatti analysis suited for the s'ravyakaavya as opposed to the drs'yakaavya-oriented analyses of the previous analysts has also been well recognized. Aanandavardhanaachaarya openly acknowledges his indebtedness to Bhartrhari and the sphOTa in his creation of the theory of dhvani.



4.It is true that gaana rasa can be different from saahitya rasa/ kaavya rasa. But that saahitya rasa /kaavya rasa from a s'ravya kaavya in the form of verse is generated in the sahrdaya-audience through the singing out of the verse is also true. gaana rasa comes from a music performance which may take the help of a text. Here role oftext is secondary. Role of singing is primary.In a singing out performance of a s'ravyakaavya, role of the text is primary. The role of singing may be secondary. Butcan not be ruled out nor is insignificant.
