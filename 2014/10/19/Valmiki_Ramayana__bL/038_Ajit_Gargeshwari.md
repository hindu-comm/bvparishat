I forgot to add this a singer, a reciter can be a sahrudaya but all sahrudayas need not resort to singing an just because I don't read verses aloud and sing the verses that does not mean I have not understood Ramayana and the intent of the verse. A person equipped with training in alankara, vyakarna and other shastras is better equipped to appreciate criticize and enjoy great compositions such as Ramayana than by singers who want keep singing them Bhakti has a place a very high place but is not the only means or an end by itself to appreciate kavyas. I know there may not be any unanimity. I read Ramayana with great devotion and used to even now read verses aloud many a times but that's different.  
  

Fresh translations of all classics may be needed to help those who don't know Sanskrit or cannot completly read and understand in Sanskrit that is a good idea and has to be done. I am in agreement.  
  

We now have a now abrand of scientists who have left their labs, their equations and have started to read sanskrit that is very good and deserves appreciation from all. But they too often bring in unfounded science into literature and Vedas which serve no purpose. For them Sayana or Bhartha or Abhinava Gupta knew nothing and think they are better equipped to teach Kavyas and vedas than a trained scholar who works in the domain of Sanskrit. A professor in Physics is not going to read relativity theory from popular books and says this how science is or should be. Same to sahitya it needs specialists who are equipped shsatric knowledge about alankara Vyakarana and related ideas to give views which will depth and the needed breath in academic forums and also outside academic forums.
