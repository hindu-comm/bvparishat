Dear friends,  
  

Good morning. I have not received any response yet. Let me tell you my interest.  

I thought of Ramayana more from a storytelling point of view when my granddaughters  
learned to read. Many of you could possibly be grandfathers, it's a privilege to be one.  

Unlike our responsibility to our children, we are not directly responsible for the daily  

development of the grandchildren, but they can bring enormous joy and happiness to  

our lives.  
  

Unlike back in India, the stories that the children read here are not thematic. They are  
created more to teach language than help reflect values. Living as a debate of values has  
not been popular in the western literature. While some of the philosophical literature  

can be analytic, living as a wholesome entity is still to be explored.
India possibly might  

have gone through such a stage to arrive at a theory of containment, a possibility of  

an event rather than a planned determination of an event.  
  

Having admired Valmiki as an integrator of theories of life, I thought I would offer books  

on Ramayana for my grandchildren to read. A monk and MIT and a yogi from Andhra  

Pradesh had helped me to read Valmiki with them and I had loved his description.  

However I was utterly disappointed when I looked at the available English translations.  

The narrative style, the poetry, the diction are completely lost in the translations I found.  

I checked Gita Press and they seemed to have copied some of this stuff with some  
anonymity. I have not examined the history of language conversions, but the greatness  
of Indian storytelling has been covered up with words that are plucked from a dictionary  

than used in the poetic context.  
  

Children grow up fast and I am losing time. Little more than a year ago, I undertook the  
task of creating a new storytelling translation of Valmiki that may be read by young people  

as a story from world literature. Twice a month I gather with a group of readers and I try  

to assess Valmiki's approach through analysis and articulation. I create the translation  

when a block of time shows up. There is a lag. There is a lot of balancing to do.  
  

While it is enjoyable, one immediately realizes our smallness compared to the nature  
of the task. I cannot say that I am a writer, mine is only an effort.
The material would  
need editing by competent bilingual scholars. If any of you has read so far about my  
personal expedition, you may browse my translation. They are posted as a blog at  

<http://misrabijoy.wordpress.com>  
Please feel free to write to me any comments. I am aware of my limitations but would  

try to improve. I have four more years to complete the work!  

  

Valmiki is a genius of the first order. As a poet, he is an observer and is sympathetic  

to all characters he creates. His creativity and style amazes me. What we are given  

in popular literature or thrown in through the TV serials are a distortion of this great  

creative work. Hopefully new plays, ballets, ballads and essays would be created  

by taking the pieces of fabric that he has created. It is the detailed analysis that  
makes it so readable. I don't know when the gross simplification started. So was my  
question to check any critical work in India on the material. I would love to know.  

  

Happy Diwali.
