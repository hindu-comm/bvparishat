Are we now taking about some singing group here? We have singers all over India who sing Ramayana especially sundara kanda. Many who donot know a word of Sanskrit do enjoy music with utmost devotion .I shall eagerly wait for what you call this "rasa" and lately do neurological research on the advent of "rasa" in humans.
