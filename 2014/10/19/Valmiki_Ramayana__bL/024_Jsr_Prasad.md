Thanks for the link on Brhaddesi and the quotation. It is heartening to know the views of Pandit Channulal Mishra on the *bhāvasahitarāga* and *ālāpa*. I think, his views must be considered extraordinary amongst the musicians.  
  

Next, on the comment \<तथा गद्यकाव्यं न गानमपेक्षते आस्वादार्थम्।>, there is an example. In Telugu *stotra* literature, a kind of prose called '*daṇḍakam*' is 'sang' in praise of deities, for instance *hanumaddaṇḍakam* etc.
