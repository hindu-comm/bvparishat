Having experimented through writings and observing people's recitations, I have made a conviction that the words are  
already formed to the internal melody the poet creates. Hence I observe that a word is a component in a larger construct  

of a phrase or sometimes a full stanza. My experience in reading literature has been that the meaning of the stanza  

reveals itself by loud reading of the stanza with the prescribed prosodic variation. There is a joy in approximation  

when one gets closer to the possible rhyme in the poet's mind. I love this discussion particularly the latest link  

to Brhaddesi by our esteemed scholar Sri Nityananda Misra. The recitation by his guru Pandit Ramabhadracharya  

has a lot to do with my thinking.
