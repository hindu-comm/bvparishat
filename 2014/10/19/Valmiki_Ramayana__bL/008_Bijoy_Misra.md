Dear Dr Vasukeya,  
  

Please do excuse me for writing in English. Unlike many of you I am not equipped to write freely in Sanskrit in the web.  

I was doing such with Sanskrit documents twenty years ago, but have not kept up. Hope to catch up soon!  
  

For your question Rajagopalachari assumes a different problem. For whatever reason he calls Ramayana mythology  
and not poetry. Valmiki is a poet and not a myth maker. We have to celebrate him for his creativity, narration, musicality  
and melodic diction. This is what I want to draw young people to. A poet imagines, does not count in units, he/she  
can see "rain" anywhere his/her mind sees. The "rain" can be of flowers, of weapons, of grief or of joy. It is not a  
literal word. This is where I think the early interpreters have thrown Valmiki as a myth maker than a splendid  

wordsmith he is. To me he is the greatest poet who ever lived, his characterization of each of the personalities is  

meticulous, analytic, studious and natural. His narration of nature has an unique poetic charm. Given that he creates  

the story and develops the scene, makes me admire his creativity with awe and joy.  

  

Rajagopalachari wants to present the story as myth not as a piece of literature. I probably read it as a kid, but when  

I read Valmiki now, each episode looks new and different to me.
Valmiki's genius has to be extracted and presented  

to our young people as a signature of human literary creativity. Though I try, my stock is limited. It is not easy to transfer  
the poetic material from one language to the other. Valmiki's metaphors are local and are connected to the local culture.  

To bring it out to an English speaking public is not straight-forward.
I find many translators making strange constructs  

which possibly are forced by word by word translations imposed by the early missionary workers. Valmiki's words change  
meanings in context and he maintains his high poetic skills through these transpositions. His "rain" takes different  
meaning depending on its use in a phrase or a sentence. I love it!
