Looks like what they are coming up with is a combination of Sabdakalpadruma/Vacaspatyam and Digital Corpus of Sanskrit.

"The Deccan College Post Graduate and Research Institute has completed digitisation of over a crore hand-written Sanskrit slips derived from the 'Ramayana', Mahabharata', Vedas and 62 other disciplines of knowledge written. The college will soon launch a portal containing the words, their meanings, references and usages."

  

"The Deccan College has finished digitisation of 30 volumes of the dictionary which will be put online for researchers and students in a month's time, said Shinde."  

  

Does anybody have more details of the project? Are there any list members who are associated with Deccan College and/or this project?
