Wrong. Don't put your invented ideas here.



------ I would not have been so rude in this context.



"*vAgdaNDa, kAyadaNDa* and *manodaNDa* etc***seem to be*** part of explanatory concepts introduced later to the actual tradition of tridanḍa" ( emphasis added.)



is an open-ended presentation of ahypothesis proposal in the process of explaining the connection betweentwo pieces of information, the object called tridanda, the ritual practice of holding it and thetexts giving meaning to the object and the ritual. To be able to prove that the object and the ritual and the meaning in the texts were born together and the object and the ritual were created with the meaning,supporting evidences can be provided.If I get hold of suchevidences, Ishall conclude that the hypothesis has been proved wrong.That is the due academic process.



Thanks.



Humbly,



Nagaraj
