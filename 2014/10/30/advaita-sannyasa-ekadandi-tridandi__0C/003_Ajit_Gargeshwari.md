I want to clearly understand Ekadanda Tridanda and Dvidanda (if they exisist) sanayass paddhatis as order of monks its significance and evolution any pointers to books or articles would be highly appreciated. I was particularly interested ancient traditions (sampradays followed) used by the monks who carry with them the dandas. As of now I am not looking at monks of Chinmayanada or Ramkrishna Mutts or similar sanyasis as they carry no dandas and follow a follow a different tradition Thanks.
