I have not read this information in any published works of Ramakrishna Mutt or Mission. I have read that the president of Ramakrishna order of Monks are normally those who take their initiation in The Holy mother or wife of Ramakrishna Paramahasa lineage. Its is not mentioned in any of their published works that Sri Ramkrishna Parma hamsa took Sanyasa or had any interactions with Kailash ashram. Vivekananda at least has not said he got copies of any Sansyasa Ppaddatis and he is following any one paddati. He never even says it Vaidika Paddati. That is why I said their order of monks follow a different



 Sampradaya. I am not making judgements. The validity or invalidity of a Sanyasi was never mentioned by me Thanks
