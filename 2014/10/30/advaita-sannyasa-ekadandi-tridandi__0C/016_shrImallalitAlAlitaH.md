Asking any monk of RK Mission, who has a little knowledge of shAstra-s, etc., will make this clear. I've first hand experience of this relation.  
vivekAnanda was for a few days in kailAsa Ashrama. abhedAnanda stayed a bit long there and he gained more knowledge of shAstra-s there.  
  

The inititation you talked, is just mantra-dIxA and not sannyAsa-dIxA. And no there is no rule that person of sAradA-lineage becomes president. svAmI AtmasthAnanda, is president and is shiShya of svAmI viGYAnAnanda.  
  

Actually, vivekAnanda and all just got gairika-vastra from rAmakR^iShNa first, without any shAstrIya-vidhi. He then got sannyAsa-vidhi from outside and then arranged homa, etc. for all according to that.  

To get these details contact some old monk of order or one who has interest in shAstra-s and history, both.
