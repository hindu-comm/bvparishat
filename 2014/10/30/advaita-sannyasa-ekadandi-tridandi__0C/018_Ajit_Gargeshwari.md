Swami Vivekanada, Swami Kalyananda and Swami Nishayananda established a Sevashram in Kankhaland. Swami Vivekanda stayed in Kailasa Asram as a resident student for three years He never says or is there any documentation to say he got his Sanyasa Diksha at KailAsa Ashrama. Nor is it true the current monks go to Kailsa Asram to receive any initiation. Staying in place for studies doesn't mean receiving monastic initiation. I wanted calrify what I had said earlier.  
  

I clearly know the difference between mantra Diksha and Sansyasa diksha  

  

Sorry to have quoted wiki but this is documented by accurate references

This is from their Official website
