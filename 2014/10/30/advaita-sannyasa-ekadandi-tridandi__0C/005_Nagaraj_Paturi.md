1\. Best way is to start with the idea of danḍa as a dīkṣāchinha for dvijas . danḍadhāraṇa for brahmacharya is well known. danḍadhāraṇa for sannyāsa is similar. So is part of the dvija culture. Absence of danḍa in non-dvija Vedic ascetic traditions also can be understood on this basis.



2\. References in some books indicate that both the wordsēkadanḍa and tridanḍa seem to have occurrences indocuments older than the advaita andviśiṣṭādvaita traditions.



3\. *vAgdaNDa, kAyadaNDa* and *manodaNDa* etcseem to be part of explanatory concepts introduced later to the actual tradition of tridanḍa. 



4\. There are works such as Olivelle's "Renouncer and Renunciation in the *Dharmaśāstras.*"
