I just got this :  
"  

*Tridandam vainavam soumyam satvacham samaparvakam \|  
Veshtitham krishnagovaaLarajjvaa tu chaturanguhm \|\|*

‘An ascetic should take three staves of bamboo and tie them together with a rope made of the hair of the cow’s tail, four *angulas* in length.’

‘A *tridandi* according to Manu is one who has restraint over his speech, mind and body and does not imply mere physical appearance of carrying a *tridanda*. ’

*Vaag dando atha manodandah kaayadandas tathaiva cha \|  
Yasyaithe nihitaa buddhau tridanditi cha uchyate \|\|*

  
"  
  

This was found on : <http://anudinam.org/2011/11/22/tridandi-sannyasi-none-other-than-lord-narayana/>  
  

More could be found in yatili\~Ngasamarthanam of vatsya varadAchArya. I request shrI-vaiShNava scholars to present the details of tridaNDa from shruti-s, smR^iti-s or any nibandha of AchArya-s.
