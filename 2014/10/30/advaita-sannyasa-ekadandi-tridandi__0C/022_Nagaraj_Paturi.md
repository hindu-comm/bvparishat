1\. The irony in the story of my participation in this thread is that I created this separate thread out of my respect for श्रीमल्ललितालालितः , honouring his suggestion in a different thread not to extend the danDa discussion in the thread dedicated for a mahaniya's Brahmlina.

I ended up facing rant from the same person.



2. Another irony is that I entered into the discussion just to point out that Advaiti Swamijis who are not Brahmins in their Poorva Aashrama do belong to S'ankara sampradaya only. While making this point, I made it very clear that that was not a participation in Ekadanda and Tridanda issue. In spite of that I later entered the Danda topic only after Dr. Ajitji said that his jijnaasa was about Ekadanda and Tridanda issue only thinking that in the process, I might also learn a few things. Now I begin to realize that that reluctant decision to enter into this danDa-discussion was a wrong one.



3. All the posts I made were related to modern chronology of references. None of the statements in reaction against them are on those lines. Thus the discussion appears to be going in two different tracks.



This is my last post on this thread.



Thanks.
