From a secondary source,

Came to know that Bhattotpala in his commentary of Varahamihira’s
Brihajjataka mentions a fifth century Jain scholar kālakāchārya who connects budha with ekadandins.

Also came to know that the Buddhist text Lalitavistara (early centuries of Christian Era ) mentions Tridanda holding persons.

Yet to locate exact lines from both the sources.
