There is no relation of daNDa-s of traivarNika-brahmachArI-s and that of sannyAsI-s of three types.  

kuTIchaka, bahUdaka - these two types of sannyAsI-s hold tridaNDa.  

haMsa holds ekadaNDa.  

paramahaMsa-s are of two types : jiGYAsu and GYAnavAn.  

jiGYAsu or vividiShu paramahaMsa-s are two types : those who embrace sannyAsa-Ashram and those who don't but shun all kAmya-niShidda-karma. The first one holds ekadaNDa.  

vidvAn or GYAnavAn paramahaMsa-s don't hold any signs.  

It could be found in jIvanmuktivivekaH of shrI-vidyAraNya.  
  

There is no need to attach these sannyAsI-s to any philosophy, advaita or dvaita. The thing which they should follow is upaniShad-s, no matter which explanation they hold.  
  

Lack of daNDa doesn't prove that the sannyAsI is ashAstrIya/avaidika.  
  

avaidika has no sannyAsa. So, saying that avaidika is sannyAsI and doesn't have daNDa - is contradictory.  
  
  

Here is paramahaMsopaniShad:  

अथ योगिनां परमहंसानां कोऽयं मार्ग्गस्तेषां का स्थितिरिति ..... asks nArada to bhagavAn  

Answers bhagavAn : स्वपुत्रमित्रकलत्रबन्ध्वादीञ्छिखां यज्ञोपवीतं यागं सत्रं स्वाध्यायञ्च सर्व्वकर्म्माणि सन्न्यस्यायं ब्रह्माण्डञ्च हित्वा कौपीनं दण्डमाच्छादनञ्च स्वशरीरोपभोगार्थाय लोकस्यैवोपकारार्थाय च परिग्रहेत्  

....this is vividiShA-paramahaMsa-sannyA.  

He continues: तच्च न मुख्योऽस्ति । कोऽयं मुख्य इति च । यदयं मुख्यो न दण्डं न कमण्डलुं न शिखां न यज्ञोपवीतं न चाच्छादनं चरति परमहंसः........ this is vidvat-paramahaMsa-sannyAsa.  
  

Same upaniShad:  
ज्ञानदण्डो धृतो येन एकदण्डी स उच्यते ।  

काष्ठदण्डो धृतो येन सर्व्वाशी ज्ञानवर्ज्जितः ॥  

तितिक्षाज्ञानवैराग्यशमादिगुणवर्ज्जितः ।  

भिक्षामात्रेण यो जीवेत् स पापी यतिवृत्तिहा ॥  

This means that ekadaNDa is representative of GYAna.  

  
  

nAradaparivrAjakopaniShad:  

कुटीचकः शिखायज्ञोपवीती दण्डकमण्डलुधरः कौपीनकन्थाधरः पितृमातृगुर्व्वाराधनपरः पिठरखनित्रशिक्यादिमन्त्रसाधनपर एकत्रान्नादनपरः श्वेतोर्द्ध्वपुण्ड्रधारी त्रिदण्डः ।

हंसो जटाधारी त्रिपुण्ड्रोर्द्ध्वपुण्ड्रधार्यसंकॢप्तमाधूकरान्नाशी कौपीनखण्डतुण्डधारी ।  
  

परमहंसः शिखायज्ञोपवीतरहितः पञ्चगृहेष्वेकरात्रान्नादनपरः करपात्र्येककौपीनधारी शाटीमेकामेकं वैणवं दण्डमेकशाटीधरो वा भस्मोद्धूलनपरः सर्व्वत्यागी ।  
  
.................  

परमहंसादित्रयाणां न कटिसूत्रं न कौपीनं न वस्त्रं न कमण्डलुर्न दण्डः सर्व्ववर्ण्णभैक्षाटनपरत्वं जातरूपधरत्वं विधिः ।  

सन्न्यासकालेऽप्यलंबुद्धिपर्य्यन्तमधीत्य तदनन्तरं कटिसूत्रं कौपीनं दण्डं वस्त्रं कमण्डलुं सर्व्वमप्सु विसृज्याथ जातरूपधरः .....  

  

This is quoted to show that their are vaidika-sannyAsa where there is no daNDa, etc.

upniShad-s have differentiated these sannyAsa and smR^iti-s have made the division clear.

Wrong. Don't put your invented ideas here.  

The three types of daNDa could be found as representing vAgdaNDa, etc. in shruti, smR^iti itself.

For knowledge of people here, chinmaya and RK Mission follow paramahaMsa-sannyAsa system which they have inherited from kailAsa-Ashrama-pramaMparA.  

vivekAnanda and abhedAnanda have got copies of sannyAsa-paddati-s from there and they followed that. Even now people who leave RK Mission or could not take sannyAsa there, go to kailAsa Ashrama for sannyAsa. And I could ensure you that these paddhati-s are vaidilka, although the Mission now doesn't follow varNa-vyavasthA. Even then, those traivarNika-s who took sannyAsa from their institution are valid sannyAsI.  

  
chinmayAnada was similarly initiated by shivAnanda sarasvatI. shivAnanda was initiated by svAmI viShNudevAnanda giri jI of kailAsa Ashrama.  
  

The tradition which doesn't carry daNDa but follows veda-s for sannyAsa, is in no way ashAstrIya. Instead, the lack of daNDa,etc. is enough to put them in paramahaMsa category.  
  

These all things should be considered putting aside men who follow these sannyAsa. Because, as soon as you bring people, you will easily catch their fault and then it is always easy to say that they don't fall in such and such category of sannyAsa because they don't have viveka or vairAgya or GYAna, etc. Keep these talks strictly stuck to vidhi-s which they follow and signs of sannyAsa which they posses, because if we bring gR^ihastha-s to compare with shAstrIya one, one could easily say that their is no gR^ihastha at all.  
  

To add to all these, the paramahaMsa-s of dashanAma-vaidika-saMpradAya do get ekadaNDa during sannyAsa ceremony, but they shun it after getting according to prescriptions. This is again to support their vaidikatva/shAstrIyatva.
