I said this : He then got sannyAsa-vidhi from outside and then arranged homa, etc. for all according to that.  
  

I have not said that he got sannyAsa at kailAsa Ashrama. I said that he got vidhi(paddhati) there.  

There is big difference.  

  

Moreover, when I said that people take sannyAsa, this is actual sentence :

  
Even now people who leave RK Mission or could not take sannyAsa there, go to kailAsa Ashrama for sannyAsa.

  
  

You could see that I have said that people who **leave RK Mission or Could Not Take SannyAsa there go to kailAsa Ashrama**, not that everyone goes there.  

There is a big difference.
