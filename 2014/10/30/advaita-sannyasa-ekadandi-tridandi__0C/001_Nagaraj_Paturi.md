The discussion was triggered by the statement by श्रीमल्ललितालालितः the initiator of the thread on Swami Kashikananda Giri Ji is brahmalIna !

"I had a few talks with him regarding specific type of daNDa which are seen nowadays in sannyAsa sampradAya"



and Dr. JSR Prasad's response to that:



"With regard to *tridanda,* they are said to be *vAgdaNDa, kAyadaNDa* and *manodaNDa* etc*.* Are there any such *ekadaNDa/dvidaNDa* kind of concepts in *yati sampradAya*? "



Dr. Ajit Gargeswari's response to that:



"This is Known *ekadaNDa* is advaita order among Sanyasis and
*tridanda is more prominent among the vaishnavas  
  
*According to the Vedic injunctions, only a brāhmaṇa may be offered sannyāsa. The Śaṅkara-sampradāya (ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa-sampradāya) awards the sannyāsa order only to brāhmaṇas, or born brāhmaṇas, but in the Vaiṣṇava system even one not born in a brāhmaṇa family may be made a brāhmaṇa according to the direction of the Hari-bhakti-vilāsa (tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām).  
  
*daNDa* denaotes renunciation hence * vAgdaNDa, kAyadaNDa and manodaNDa etc.* can be explained  
  

I have not heard about dvidaNDa

"



Response of श्रीमल्ललितालालितः to Dr. JSR Prasad :



"Yes, ekadaNDa represent GYAnam as tridaNDa represents vAk-kAya-manaH-saMyama."



Nagaraj Paturi's response to Dr. Ajit Gargeswari:



"The Śaṅkara-sampradāya (ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa-sampradāya) awards the sannyāsa order only to brāhmaṇas, or born brāhmaṇas



------There are many advaita sannyāsis who werenon-Brahmins in their pūrva āśrama.



nāga sadhus/sannyāsis of advaita affiliationdo not all come from
brāhmaṇas.



This is not about ēkadanḍa or tridanḍa issue. This is only about whether there were /are non-brāhmaṇa advaita sannyāsis or not."



Dr. Ajit Gargeswari's response to this:



"Ekadanda Sanyasis in Shankara lineages are Brahmanas in purvashrama.
Naga Sadhus don't carry any danda. So Ekadandins normally support advaita. I don't know of any Advaita Dvaita or Visitat advaita Sansyasis as an order of Sanyasa probably Prof Paturi can shed light on this and clearly explain if possible whats ekadanda, Tridanda and if there exists dvidanda order among sansyasis Thanks"  


The discussion continues.
