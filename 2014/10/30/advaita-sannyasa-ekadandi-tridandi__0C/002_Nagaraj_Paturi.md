Ekadanda Sanyasis in Shankara lineages are Brahmanas in purvashrama.



-True



Naga Sadhus don't carry any danda



-True



So Ekadandins normally support advaita.



\- How is 'so' suited here. ' Ekadandins normally support advaita' - true. But this statement has no 'so' connection with the previous two statements. 



I don't know of any Advaita Dvaita or Visitat advaita Sansyasis as an order of Sanyasa.



------ I failed to understand this statement. This is probably a comment on my statement "This is only about whether there were /are non-brāhmaṇa advaita sannyāsis or not.", particularly my use of the phrase 'non-brāhmaṇa advaita sannyāsis ' and 'advaita sannyāsis' part of it. If that is it, let me say, my word advaita sannyāsi does not refer to any 'order' of sannyasa. It was in a general sense of a sannyasi who is an advaiti. Similarly one could use words like dvaita sannyasi and vis'ishtaadvaita sannyasi also in a general sense not in the sense of an order of sannyasa.



clearly explain if possible whats ekadanda, Tridanda and if there exists dvidanda order among sansyasis



---- I already said in my post "This is not about ēkadanḍa or tridanḍa issue".



My intention was only to draw attention to the fact that persons like Swami Chinmayananda (saraswati), Vidyaprakashanandagiri Swami, etc. were Advaitis by Vedantic conviction. If they can be called sannyasis, they are examples for a non-brahmana sannyasiwith Advaitic conviction. If Naaga Saadhus of Advaita affiliation can be called sannyasis,non-Brahmins among themare also examples of a non-brahmana sannyasiwith Advaitic conviction. If the point being made is that the word 'sannyaasa' is reserved for the persons who are Brahmins by birth, that is why only ekadanda sannyasi is a valid word in connections with advaita, that iis a different point. Myintention is to draw attention to the cases that I mentioned.
