Namaste,  
  

The first query was answered by another member, already. I now understand that you were referring to the Viaja Homa. It will be kind of you, if you have anything to add to that.  
  

Thank you for answering the second query.  
  

As regards the third query, I have seen some sanyashis with the three dandas, one of which is about one-inch thick, the second one is thinner (about half-inch thick) and the third one is still thinner (about quarter-inch thick). The lengths of all the three dandas are roughly the same. It will be kind of you to enlighten us if there are any specifications for the individual dandas.  
  

Regards.
