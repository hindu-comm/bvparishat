If academic process is of concern, then let me put it against you.  

You just made a statement without providing any proof of that. So, it is just speculation seen from others' point of view. If you had provided any such evidence, we may not have blamed in such a way.  

The same thing done by you makes your sentence eligible for our consideration. But, if I blame it in the same way, why should not you consider it in the same way.  
  

Just because you see somewhere that customs came first and explanations later, doesn't make this a universal rule. Isnt' it?  
  

BTW, I clearly mentioned that shruti-s and smR^iti-s have said that daNDa-s should be kept by sannyAsI and it represents such and such things. So, in this way my statement was not just a work of imagination, but one based on shAstra.  
  

Another thing to mention, there is a basic difference between sAMpradAyika-vidvAn and those who are not - regarding validity, origin, etc. of veda-s. Those are also playing role to shape our statements. Considering that this difference can't be eradicated, let us put our views mentioning this difference. Once you mention this, I'll never bother to even reply.  
  

BTW,  

Here is manu:  

वाग्दण्डोऽथ मनोदण्डः कर्म्मदण्डस्तथैव च ।  

यस्यैते नियता बुद्धौ स त्रिदण्डीति चोच्यते ॥

  

त्रिदण्डमेतत्तु निक्षिप्य सर्व्चभूतेषु मानवः ।  

कामक्रोधौ तु संयम्य ततः सिद्धिं निगच्छति ॥  
  

More from daxa:  

वाग्दण्डे मौनमातिष्ठेत्कर्म्मदण्डे त्वनीहताम् ।(कर्म्मदण्डोऽल्पभोजनम् is other reading.)  

मानसस्य तु दण्डस्य प्राणायामो विधीयते ॥  
  

Such tridaNDa is essential for even paramahaMsa, who bear external ekadaNDa, is said by prajApati:  

यतिः परमहंसस्तु तुर्य्याख्यश्श्रुतिचोदितः ।  

यमैश्च नियमैर्य्युक्तो विष्णुरूपी त्रिदण्डभृत् ॥  
  

shrI-vidyAraNya says that these are called daNDa because they are damana-hetuH.  
  

Now, he explains that : these internal daNDa-s are real daNDa-s and should be hold by all yati-s. The external one is their representative.  
So, it comes that internal ones are original daNDa-s, while your imagination represented as if external is original and to find some explanation some people devised these explanation. That's the difference.  
  

Again, ज्ञात्वैवं मनोदण्डं धृत्वा is found in nAradaparivrAjakopaniShad.  

The same upaniShad says that :  

वागदण्डः कर्म्मदण्डश्च मनोदण्डश्च ते त्रयः ।  

यस्यैते नियता दण्डाः स त्रिदण्डी महायतिः ॥  
  

This all should be enough to dispel your imagination.  
  

The person who is presenting some imagination and expects it to become valid, must have studied and researched enough to provide at least a few vAkya-s from shAstra. If he doesn't, then there is nothing wrong in refuting it.  
  
  

I must clear that I'm not a paNDita of English language. So, I translate following sanskrit terms, i.e.  

imagination = कल्पना = अर्थापत्तिः - as we study in shAstra-s. The shrutArthApatti is valid only if you could show vAkya which is valid and can't be explained otherwise. Without presenting it, and claiming that 'it is hypothesis' will essentially cause the question 'based on what' in others' mind. This is not correct according to common sense, and I hope this sense is what is called 'academic process' when brought to respected field.
