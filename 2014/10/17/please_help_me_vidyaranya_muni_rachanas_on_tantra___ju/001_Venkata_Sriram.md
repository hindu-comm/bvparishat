Namaste,  
  
There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding "vidyAraNya swami" whether he is the same who ascended the sringeri peetha or not.
However, one tantra work ascribed to him is "srividyArNava tantra". He is said to have compiled "vanadurgA kalpaM".  
  
Shri Vidyaranya is also said to have drafted a code of conduct for srividyA upAsakAs called "sadAchAra dIpika" which i have which is basically on kaulA & vAma nirAsana.  
  
Probably, there were other yatis in dasanami sampradAya who bore this name called vidyAraNya. Similarly, there is also a confusion on the name "gauDapAda" to whom "subhagOdaya stuthi" is ascribed.
