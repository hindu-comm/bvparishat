Namaste

  

1. The link provides only 41 slokas out of 100(shatakaM) of the text. I am not clear whether the prescription was for study of part of the text.

  

2. One of the cardinal principlesin prescribing the study texts ( especially for Sanskrit) is to provide the student with
anopportunity to learn the elegance and beauty of the text, values of the tradition and language.

  

 Learning national History in Sanskrit languagewas considered
the least priority of the themes. And introducing ' disruptive, demeaning non-secular thoughts in education through the parts of syllabus texts' is totally not acceptable.

  

3. Without getting in to the literary merit of the text or questioning the wisdom of prescribing this model of literature as a text, I would like to draw the attention of the learned readers to the followingverses, whichdoes not seem to bein good taste for a Sanskrit class! 

  

Verse 26 on page 49 ; Verse 27 on page 50; Verse 28 on page 51; Verse 36 on page 59 ; Verse 39 on page 64

  

4. If Sanskrit education needs to reflect the ' mass and class struggle, why pick socially sensitive personalities ? There are many works in Sanskrit composed by women writers like Smt. Kshama rao in more elegant poetry andfactual. The workViswagunadarsha Champu of illustrious Acharya is no less critical of Hindu Society. In fact, there are ' later period Upanishads on Jesus and Allah' , which can be brought under the syllabus for philosophy and Vedic studies ! Or the classical translation of Holy bible and Koran in Sanskrit , which can be brought under ' Sarva -mata - Samgraha' studies.

  

5. More than that, would this be the ' Trojan horse hole' - an opening to introduce the work Riddles in Hinduism' -Dr. Ambedkar ( <http://satnami.com/Riddles.pdf> ? ) by Sanskrit students ? The reason being that this isstudied and discussed world wide ? yet to be translated in to Sanskrit ?

  

I am not against the study and debate on social relevance of scriptures in a classical language. Orany intention to intervene in to the prerogatives of introducing any topic in the syllabus of a university.
I have voiced my concern for the selection of a text portion for syllabus in India which needs certain considerations and concerns that need to be addressed,at least in India. If this part of the text were introduced in any other university outside ofIndia, I would not have raised a little finger or voice about this. The environments are different in India and Beyond India; Within India, Sanskrit Universities and Other universities.
