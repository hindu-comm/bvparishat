Namaste,

  

Dr. Bhimrao Ambekar was a great Indian and like many of us, if not like most of us, he was an ardent admirer of Lord Buddha and his teachings, while stiil remaining a Hindu. Only at his deathbed, less than two months before his demise, he got formally converted to Buddhism. In fact Lord Buddha himself was a Hindu and he died a Hindu and he never said that he was propagating a new dharma. That is why Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan said that Lord Buddha was a great reformer of Hinduism.

  

Regards,
