Namaste Sunil ji

  

1\. The \<Identity> is not a one sided recognition!

  

2\. Yes, many of us are ardent admirers of Buddha; and teachings of Buddha, the work of Dr.Ambedkar in integrating the community. 'Buddha as an avatar' has the full approval of tradition.  Buddha is recognized as ' one of the avatar's of Vishnu' ( albeit the explanation of 'durjana mohaka' provided in Vaishnava tradition / Shoonya vadi in general Vedanta tradition continues). But 'Sangha' is not enforcing the full and true teaching of Buddha . Dharma has to play a second fiddle to 'Sangha'; and Buddha is good as long as He serves to be the icon for Sangha goals ! It is a human social phenomenon.

  

3. With all that, the 'Sangha' and the ' Society' which iconizes Dr.Bhimrao Ambedkar' does not see this issue in the same perspective
for social wellness and welfare, accommodating the ' other identified and targeted section' of the society.

  

 The signature mark of Amebdakarite political team in community is seenas ' Persona level Brahmin hatred -Rejection of Vedas and every tradition associated with it - Projection of Buddhism asanti -revolting to Vedic tradition'. In this sensethe \<identities> of Hindu and Buddhist have been literally disrupted and distorted, especially post colonial rule. This divisiveness of identity has resulted in many misgivings in executive actions and social injustices in the name of ' restoring the social justice'. The meritocracy has yielded to mediocracy under democracy, hard pushed as social justice in all fields, even in areas where they are dangerous ! In this sense, the essential vision and guidance of Dr.Bhimrao Ambedkar has gone slightly off the track !As long as one gets a clear picture on this, there will certainly be a healthy dialogue and handshake. Making ' education-syllabus' as the battlefield of ideology is what hurts in these cases.
