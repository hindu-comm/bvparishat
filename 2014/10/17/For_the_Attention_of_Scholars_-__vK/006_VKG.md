Pranaama  
I wanted to draw the attention of the scholars to the trends of Universities to include works of recent poets (modern poetry);in the place of older classic poetry such ae Pancha Maha Kavyas and Naatakas.  
As I observe, KSU set the trend of including the works of Athe then VC of RSKS. Students of such courses, whom I met, were wondering whether studying such texts in place of classical texts is adding value to their literary erudition. Some of the dropped out of the courses due to compulsion of such studies.  
Now this is the text prescribed for BA Sanskrit.  
Having studied the great works such as Naishadham, Maagha Kavyam, Kumaara Sambhavam this new trend makes me think about the direction of the new trends.
