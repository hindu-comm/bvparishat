hariH OM,  

  
That Mr. Ambedkar was a willful instrument in the hands of the British comes out clearly in the well researched and documented book "Worshipping False Gods". Moreover, if it weren't for the misplaced magnanimity of the Congress members, Mr. Ambedkar wouldn't have ever entered into the constitution drafting committee. But these are tangential to the present discussion.  
  

Anyone with a poetic mind can write a shataka / dashaka / aShTaka / stuti of anyone. But whether such hagiographic works such as these should become part of syllabus of the Sanskrit university should be a matter of discussion and concern. Seems like the syllabus setters were scraping the bottom of the barrel for the "Ambedkar" chapters. I still remember that when I was in highschool, we had an ambedkar chapter in each of our language books in all the three years.  
  
Unless accompanied by a proper preface explaining each shloka and the reason it finds place in the shatakam would be egregious as it is tantamount to ideology peddling (through the backdoor, something that the communists have been doing all along).  
  

Take for instance the shloka 7:  
This is after two shlokas (5 and 6) which say that  
1. Bhimrao was born in the Mahar community.  
2. Moreover, the particular family which Bhimrao was born in was the follower of Kabir.  
3. And because the followers of Kabir do not worship "stones" (a leap of imagination),  
4. he insinuates that the Mahar community doesn't worship "stones" follows in shloka 7

कुर्युस्ते तु न पाषाणपूजा निर्गुणरागिणः।  
पाषाणेषु वरा तेषां गृहेषु ननु चक्रिका॥  

with shloka translation (sic.): Those having faith in formless God do not worship statues of Stone. The grinding stone in their houses is better than the stone (since the grinding stone becomes instrumental in feeding people).  
----------------------------  

Some observations:  

1\. It is well known that choka meLa, a vArkhari saint who has written several abhangs about viTThala (a "pAShANa", according to the kavi), and was a great bhakta of the pAShANa (viTThala) and thus gives the lie to the leap of imagination of the kavi.  

2\. If any poet were to claim that Kabir wasn't a worshipper of "stones", he may at least listen to these shabads:  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNZ2MuGBakw> (saawal sundar raamaiyya: dusky and beautiful rAma... words of kabir.)  

3\. Why is it that the followers of Ambedkar want his bust / statue photo to be put up everywhere if he himself was against "pAShANa" ArAdhana? At a personal level, isn't it appropriate for the writer of the "shataka" to protest the "pAShANakaraNa" of ambedkar?  

4\. Moreover, the attempt at attacking idol-worship has its roots in the grand alliance which operates against Hindus, this grand alliance is obviously a marriage of convenience between the christian church, islam and the "dalit" groups. Each group having its own sets of grouses against Hinduism, and also with its victim narratives.  

  

If observations such as these aren't given in the preface to the book (or included as footnotes from the "other" point of view), the inclusion of the work in the syllabus will be tantamount to peddling ideological hagiographies. One thought that the arts were the ones which promote critical thinking.  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,
