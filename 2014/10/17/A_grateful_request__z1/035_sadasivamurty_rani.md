Dear Shri Bijoy!

Here I have uploaded a few stotras recorded under my personal supervision and care.**I AM THE COMPOSER OF MUSIC FOR ALL THESE STOTRAS.**

i\. Three of them were from the Siva Stotras album (with more than 60 rare stotras of Siva spread to a length of 6 hours) which was produced by us in 2002. The Singer was Mr. R. Srinivasa Sarma who at that time was just 16 years young. 

ii\. The forth stotra -**Sri Jagannatha Prapatti written and tuned by me**- was sung by Mrs. M.Sri Devi It is from an album produced by Sri Jagannatha Suprabhata Stotra lahari (a collection of ancient and modern Suprabhata Stotras on Sri Jagannatha Swami of Puri presented in an album spread to a time span of 6 hours).

In all these and similar exercises we took care of protecting the pronunciation aspect to a maximum extent.

**NOTE: As the Google Groups is not allowing to mail more than 8 MBytes in a mail the content of this mail is divided into four mails (Four songs in four mails).**

This is for the appreciation of all being uploaded here.



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
