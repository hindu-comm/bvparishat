Namaste Dr. Paturi

  

You have a good suggestion to deliberate.

  

Poornam also has the same fuzziness as shoonyam, in meaning. So are the words like anantam, akhandam, anekam, advayam

  

Vedic maths sutras use a technical word for avoiding this difficulty. Pl. Look for it in bharateekrishnas sutras.

  

Zero is a concept; which is difficult to capture unless there is a qualifying coordinate (- visheshanas) like samkhya- numeric measure, distance (doora antika), measure(- parimaana), transformation (-- parinaama) , process (- prakriya yoga) are associated.

  

In short, zero is an integral part of the duality (- dwandva- nirdwandva) paired concept.

In adwaita vedanta terms, zero or infinity would mark the limit of change in one or other direction, where Samkhya (- numeric value, finiteness of measure) becomes so small and beyond the resolution of measurement). Does it mean the end result in any measurement would be zero or infinity; or the end is dwaita permanent at any extreme, qualified identity of partial nature due to inability to sense, or illusion or unreal or Only That is real-  These would be matters for personal exploration.

  

The Srividya- Tantra schools present this limiting approach Saadhanaa as ' bindu' dhyana; yogopanishads talk of this as naada- bindu- upanishat= secret of limits of a line becoming a point and beyond, explored in the matter of Sound, (- shabda) as the prime quality of Aakaasha tattva(- the space which supports, sustains and illuminates ) . Vyakarana uses the technicality of the root- acton (- kriyaa) Bhoo- explained as ' sat' and ' Sattaa' . The two other related roots are Kru and 'as'.

  

When Gita uses the word Saamkhya yoga, look at it beyond the vedanta darshana connotation. It is an exploration of two key concepts;

Samkhyaa= samyak aakhyaanam - precise measurability and finiteness(- meyataa- aavarana- koshataa- dehataa- ahamtaa).

Yoga- limits of joining (- parah sannikarshah sandhih)- till there is oneness as ekaadesha -

Deergha lopa prakrutibhaava aagama model changes indicate the deliberation in higher plane of aakaasha tattva= sound- language. Similar analysis in material frame is Tantra, science in yoga sutras third chapter.

  

In this context, kevalam can be a recommended word for Zero, the final reminder, taking clue from yoga concept of kaivalya. This would resonate with the term bindu of tantra; avoiding the overtones towards infinity in other direction. ( somilarly A- prameya= what can not be a topic of postulated finite measure and comprehension- can be considered, if one is tolerant of theological schools.).
