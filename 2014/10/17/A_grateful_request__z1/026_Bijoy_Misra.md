Dear Dr Murty,  

Very interesting. Do you have recordings that you can post?  

For many years I have wondered how the Gita or the Ramayana might have been sung.  

The vocal renderings that circulate do fall into the problem that you mention.  

Taking a few music teachers and their students and coaching them for two years or so,  
we came up with a production that we presented two years ago. I am giving the link.  

It is the first half of an eleven stanza SriKrishna Geetam that I developed  
with the monk Swami Sarvagatananda at Ramakrishna Mission in Boston.  

The monk passed away in 2009 at the age of 97 and did not see through this production.  

We did some vedic stanzas earlier, which do not have a good recording.  

Here is the music link of the Gita stanzas.

Happy Diwali.
