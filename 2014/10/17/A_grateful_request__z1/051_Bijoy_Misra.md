Dear Dr Prasad,  

This is a good point. But we need not go outside Sanskrit. Bhratrhari does talk about *apekshAbuddhi.  
*

Please do think more and write to me how we can set up a research area on the topic.*  
*

Please check what work has been done.** You can post here on write to me privately.*  
*

Like all research, we have to articulate the problem well.*  
*

Best regards,  

BM*
