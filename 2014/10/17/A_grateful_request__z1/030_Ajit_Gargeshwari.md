Dr. Bijoy Misra,  

I think you missed the intended sense what I wanted to covey. I would prefer to read the originals, mulas and let the texts speak for themselves. Methodology of research and its tools are well established this list is well aware of such methods. The best way to get youngsters into Sanskrit is to study Sanskrit as language and read the mulas. Sayana or ancient commentators were better equipped to deal with the texts and they have given a view. The trend of many is to read secondary sources and jump to conclusion or try to put in 21 century science in to vedas which in my opinion is simply meaning less.
