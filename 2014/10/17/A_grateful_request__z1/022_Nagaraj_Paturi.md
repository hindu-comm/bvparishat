There is a friend and erstwhile colleague of mine, Prof. Vinod Vidwans whose email id In response to offline correspondence, who is working onhis computational music project as part of which he has already created modules that make a computerproduce Hindustani classical music creatively on its own. He has quantitative information/mathematical data required for such production.



He says one of his aims is to prove that the ancient Indian musicological descriptions/analyses are adequate to impart musical creativity to a machine.



(Something similar to the already proved claim of Paniniyan description being adequate to impart linguistic creativity to a machine)
