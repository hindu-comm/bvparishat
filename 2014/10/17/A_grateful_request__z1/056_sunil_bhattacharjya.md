Namaste Prof. Paturi and Prof. Prasad,  
  

It may not be correct to see fuzziness in the Sanskrit word "Shunya". In Vishnu-sahasranama Lord Vishnu is called Shunya and it does not mean non-existence. It only means the state beyond attributes. To my knowledge etymologically it means "to expand' and it means that same as the words "Brahman" or "Vishnu", which are derived from "Brih". So also the Sanskrit word "Shunya' in the Mahayana Buddhism means the state beyond the five skandhas or the five koshas and thus "Shunya / Shunyata" means the same thing as the state of "Videhamukta" in Advaita Vedanta. That is why Nagarjuna has emphasized that Shunya is not non-existence. Please correct me if you think otherwise.  
  

It is another matter that in the Hinayana the Pali word "Shunya" is used in the sense of "nothingness" and that is the reason many scholars think of Buddhism as promoting Nihilism.  
  

Regards,
