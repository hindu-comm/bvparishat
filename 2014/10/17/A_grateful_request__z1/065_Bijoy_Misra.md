Dear Dr Prasad and friends,  
  

Yes, it's a wishful and long journey. The only view is that I see a population of independent students  
that did not exist before. By their location and life's challenges they have to operate under extremely  

competitive environments. My modest goal is to bring in research in Sanskrit into their framework.  

If we can make it challenging, some of them might undertake it as a life time pursuit.  
  

It's a pure function of doability. I do not know what is tried in India. My thinking is that research by  

young researchers of Indian origin could bring a point of view that has not been explored. We must  
not proceed from an earlier hypothesis but explore a topic fresh. In the same manner we should  

not force a solution, but allow the exploration to move forward. After we identify topics, I have to  

create a required study guide on each topic and check if one can compete with the young person's  
interest. I am looking for younger minds because job prospects with graduate work are still poor.  

Hopefully the new younger generation would help create it more challenging to help create better  

funding. So we have to address more fundamental signatures of life, like speech, music, cognition,  

and mental processes. It could also involve a better exposition of the Indian scholarly ideas to  

be studied by the younger minds.  
  

As Dr Gargeshwari suggested we can close this thread and add topics to the other thread I  

created. It is currently a simple compilation. After compiling I will reach out to different scholars  

to create the study guide. Then we have to assess at what level the topic might to be introduced.  

We can use the forum of the forthcoming World Sanskrit Conference or another Conference  
of similar type to fine-tune the teaching and research model.  
  

I offer my gratitude and thankfulness to all who kindly participated in the discussion.  

  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
