I can see the topic "Re: A grateful request" divided into two or three threads, but without proper subject title indicating the contents of the topic which would be a proper way of presenting one's ideas correctly so as the topic would attract the reader immediately to the content of the topic. In this case it is missing.

  

Anyhow I have no comments to add. But the inter-disciplinary research, like the ones discussed in this common thread, needs expertise in both fields modern Science related and also deep knowledge in the Sanskrit Literature, if one wants to present any result properly accepted to both fields, Science and Literature and Language and Linguistics, to be precise, Social Sciences covering the other field. Sanskrit Language is too wide and comprizing many texts dealing diverse topics and one should dvelve into the field before taking up a related research and survey the field what is done and what is not done about the topic for research which is a general principle for research. The same applies inter-disciplinary research as discussed in these threads.

  

This is just my view on reading the messages and not any criticism of the purpose.
