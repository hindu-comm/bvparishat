Dear Dr Joshi,



I know that as an expert in the field and as a researcher passionately devoted to the issue, you must be aware of more minute nuances of the issue.



My point was that the discussions on the list gave an impression , may be unwittingly, that 'scientific' research on Sanskrit related matters was to be started afresh. You did a right thing by sharing that you were already there doing such a thing. I wanted to add to that and show that such a research was already there in a big way..



For example, IIT-H and the organizations networked with them are doing exemplary work in Sanskrit based and Sanskrit oriented computational linguistics.



Clinical research on contemporary lines is being carried out in a big way by



S-VYASA, Bangalore (<http://svyasa.edu.in/> ),



Himalaya ( <http://www.himalayawellness.com/research/index.htm> )and other big Ayurvedic drug companies and others.



We can 1. inform the younger generation about this huge existing activity, 2. enthuse them towards joining the work to take it forward or to add new areas to it and3. equip them to be able to participate. There is no need of reinventing the wheel
