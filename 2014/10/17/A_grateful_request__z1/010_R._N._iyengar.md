Dear Dr.Shastry,

  

Namaskaara! I share your desire for seeing new things happen in the field of Indic culture in general and Sanskritic tradition in particular. You mention Pre-paninian Lipi-shaastra. I could not understand this clearly. If you meant Karoshthi etc going back to the Indus scripted seals, claimed to be nearer to Tamil linguistically (but as script, I am not aware); yes this is a huge mystery likely to remain so, for a long long time. But at a personal level I am fairly well convinced investigation only into "Sanskrit as a Language" is unlikely to unlock all doors.

There is one mystery, linguistic or otherwise, that is "ZERO". Since you are a traditionally trained scholar in addition to being a modern analyst, I like to ask you the following. Is there any serious discussion in shastraic Sanskrit texts about the origin and/or conceptual development of this ' padaartha, or guNa, or sankhyaa' or whatever one may call it! I am sure Annambhatta knew 'zero' (also fractions) but he touched upon only 'Integers" in his work. (I like to be corrected if my impression is wrong). There are arguments that link zero to Buddhist 'Shuunya'. But I always felt 'zero' as a concept is nearer to the 'Abhaava' of Taarkikas as an 'Absence'. I would appreciate if you and/or other scholars enlighten me in understanding "zero' from the point of view of Shaastra tradition.

best regards

  

RN Iyengar
