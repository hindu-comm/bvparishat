Dear Dr Iyengar,  

Both are good ideas. The first one is better handled by the senior scholars.  

The second one is certainly worth exploring. I will record.  

  
Currently most of our ignorance is termed as mystery. This had led people  
to make opportunistic interpretation. We have to accept ignorance when  
we do not have a direct perception.  Then we try to know. So the list that  

I am seeking would be a list of assumptions we carry in creating our  

knowledge base. The young minds reject the assumptions and the new  

people create arbitrary connections to rationalize. The latter unfortunately  

makes its way into the knowledge base through uncritical publications.  
Let us delineate a few points of ignorance (wish to know) in our own area  
of interest and then check how we may approach them.  
  

Take Bhratrhari's example. We have to create similar problem statements  

and find solutions.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
