Dear Dr Murty,  
  

I have prepared a sketch of material that might be included. It will certainly expand.  

What I am looking for are educators who have tried to expose the knowledge value  
to the High School students through texts and graphics. It would be necessary to  
look into a more discreet level of extraction such that the information competes with  
the other information systems available to the student. You can think of a one line  
summary in each of the twelve levels that you have listed that you think would make  
it interesting for the student to learn more and do research. As I indicated you can  
think of a problem statement than a knowledge statement. A problem statement  
possibly can be done with the student's vocabulary with the limited use of new  
technical words.  
  

Earth is a sphere with two poles is a knowledge statement. Why is Earth round  

is a problem statement. So is the idea.   
  

Best regards,  

BIjoy Misra
