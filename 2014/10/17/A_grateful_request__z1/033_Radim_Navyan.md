Such trends are more harmful, than just meaningless.  
  
Modern science is a mere second-hand belief, in which followers name themselves 'scientists'. The inner part of such beliefs was clearly shown by Paul Feyerabend. Though the limits of science are self-evidential in every aspect of our every-day life.  
What really do modern scientists is destroy the remainders of divinity. The true knowledge, vidya, is like sourdough fermentation. You can
become wise only from wise one. But when thousands of "researchers" flood Internet by their "discoveries" ("english scientists say, that..." - is already a mem), the only result of this would be disrespect to true spiritial masters. And that is the shortest way to hell for the humanity. Even 'systems theory' says about that.  
  
Mere availability of sacred texts to anyone, that we see nowadays, produces illusion kinda "Oh, I can read it myself. I can understand it myself" etc. And "what for do I need a Master? I'am the Master. I've already read the text. And even more, I've made a spectral analysis to that". Its such a pity thing. The gotra of blinds, that follows another blinds to abyss.  
Advice for any scientist. Try to live in total exile for at least three months. No TV, no phones, no social contacts... If you do that, you'll never return to your 'scientific' methods of 'research'. If you can't do such a simple thing, than you are bound by mundane life. And bound one have no moral right to 'research' sacred things. It is strictly prohibited by dharma-shastras.  
Want to study sanskrit? Find a traditional sanskrit teacher. Want to study poetry? Find a traditional sanskrit kavi. Want to study dharma? Find acarya. 'Researches' without guru are worth the same as licking own beltch.  
  
Let's see.  
Ok, you have done "Corpus of sanskrit texts". Now anyone can search any word in any form. So what? It’s worthless. Word is just black pixels on your monitor. Can you enter the narrow gates, that are opened by such words? Defenetly not. You’ll continue ‘research’ the text from outside. But to know the inner part of a house, you need to step inside. How could you do that, if you don’t see the gates? No way. Newer. Only the householder can do help you. Try to feel it.  
  
That’s why all that ‘researces’ are mere the form of time-killing. You’d better go fishing, or mounting, or gardening. Or try to research your inner soul. Without spectometers, just you and your soul, one by one. That’s it. And later come back to sanskrit, to music, to poetry or whatever you like.  
This is the true scientific method. The only one. You discover the everlasting Truth, the ever-fresh knowledge of something, that stays unattainable by any outer 'scientific' instruments. And if you succeed, you'll see, how childish you were trying to measure grains of sand. The only answer for your "Why?'s" would be "Because". With no extention to it.
