Namaste

I fully support and appreciate the important and valuable suggestion made by Prof. RNI , reading: \< prepare a list of the "mysteries of Indian Culture" from different perspectives \> and follow it up with valuable research which will be with \< "....a fresh open-minded analytic look ,… which are now shrouded in words or interpreted arbitrarily..." \> .



The first step, the humble yet critical one in this direction is to get back to the core of ‘ Indian Linguistics’ and ‘ Indian model of Scripting the languages (technically called lipi-shaastra of pre-Paninian period )’ ; and build a firm bridge which connects the ‘ Indian languages’ rather than divide them by using the
‘Aryan-Dravidian :: Sanskrit –Tamil “ paradigms.



The ‘ Font deliberations’ in the artificiality of ‘Typographies and Type-setting foundry model orthography’ will be of limited value in this exploration.



Can we list of people willing to put their energies in this area ? – Of course please write off the line, to keep the clutter less. 



Regards

BVK Sastry
