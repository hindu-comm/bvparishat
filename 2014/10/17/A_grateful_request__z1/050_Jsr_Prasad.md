There was this '*yogi pratyaksha*', transcending beyond sensual knowledge by yogic power. A true yogi said to be adept in knowing even the chirping of the birds (*sarva bhUta rta jnAnam ...*). Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam garu referred to this concept, a couple of times in BVP.

Let me try to project something relevant from Nyaya. When two objects are in front of us, until unless there is this enumerative cognition called '*apekshAbuddhi'*, we cannot cognize the number 'two.' Naiyayikas brought forth a relation called '*paryApti*' to which connects both objects and gives rise to the 'two-ness (*dvittva*).' So, the number two (*dvi*) resides by this relation in both the *loci.* The cognition of the *dvittva* is destroyed when the *apekshAbuddhi* is also destroyed. Indeed, this is the contribution of Vaiseshikas to Indian philosophy. I am told by a colleague that western philosophers like Plato, deny the existential experience of objects in the cognitive process. We know that 2+2 is 4. But Plato argues that this does not require any experience as sum of the problem is purely mental. The concept of *dvittva* in Nyaya-Vaiseshika is something contrary to this and offers more scope for deliberation being a realistic system.
