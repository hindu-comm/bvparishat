Dear Prof. Bijoy Misra ji,  
  

Thanks for adding few more points to your agenda, which has a purposeful and genuine motive behind it. But in achieving so, articulating the *modus operandi* (like scientific analysis) to evaluate śāstric concepts in terms of discovery, which leads to verification, etc., may not carry a propriety. I feel so because, these terms are either borrowed from western science or western philosophy. The basis of this statement is the arguments of philosophers like Sir Karl Popper (1902-1994) who has advocated a strong theory called 'Conjectures and Refutations'. According to him, a hypothesis must be falsifiable, but cannot be 'verifiable.' He leaves no room to exempt even the Newtonian laws. He has even improved the David Hume's 'problem of tomorrow.' But, when we look at Gautama for any pointers to resolve this, he had established that 'any doctrine should fit into one of the four siddhāntas', hence no falsifiability or verifiability At this juncture, you also said it rightly \< *In the study of the evolution of the Sanskrit language our ignorance is so high that we have little to "verify.*">.  
  

With regard to 'discovery': The discovery of electricity, discovery/invention of a new drug etc., is different than discovering problems in śāstra. Because we use to work with oil lamps until the electricity is 'discovered.' In systems of Indian philosophy, we have clear counter arguments and respective essential tenets, nothing else like discovering problems etc. In fact the real problem lies with the pūrvapakṣin but not with the siddhāntī. Seemingly, when certain doctrines discussed across schools, then one can see such 'problems' over there. So, I am afraid, these modern terms may not exactly convey the real intention.  
  

Furthermore, Cambridge dictionary defines discovery as "**the process of discovery requires at least the awareness that an existing concept or method can be modified or transformed**." In context of śāstra, how far this term is applicable, this can be elaborated by scholars here.  

  

With regard to apekṣābuddhi: I went beyond some 100 odd verses as per the location suggested by you in Vakyapadiyam, but in vain. But I am convinced that the concept apekṣābuddhi advocated by Naiyayikas is altogether different than the apekṣā described by great Bhartrhari. You may please look into the respective definitions of the terms concerned.  
  

With regard to anticipation: You may by interested to see the discussion on 'ākāṅkṣā' under the in-vocative verses of kārikāvalī. Two types of ākāṅkṣā, namely 1. utthitākāṅkṣā and 2. utthāpyākāṅkṣā were discussed there. This must be helpful for any further thought, I believe. I'd be happy if you take this in a positive way and sorry, if I sound harsh somewhere.  
  

Respected moderators: Apologies, I could not but have to continue comment in the same thread.  
  

With regards,  
Prasad
