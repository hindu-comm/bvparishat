Dear Prof. Sivakumar,  
Possibly a good idea. Please elaborate more. Write private if you like.  
Imagine undergraduate research topics that could be inter-disciplinary  
in nature. It might involve analysis, laboratory work, neurology, linguistics,  
acoustic science, musicology, mathematics, anthropology among others.  
I am looking for "why" questions, analytic that would need inter-disciplinary  
work and would be challenging. We might also think of building computational  
models to simulate. Please think a bit and let me know.  

Thank you.  

BM
