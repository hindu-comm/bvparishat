Dr Bhat,  

It is a good observation. I have created the new thread "Research topics in Sanskrit for the undergraduate studies" where discussion  

can be done on the current efforts in integrating Sanskrit research to the college curriculum and problem statements can be made  
that can be proportioned to create studies. "History on analysis of concepts in Sanskrit language" can be another track. A topic that  
interests me is the "origin of Sanskrit phonemes."  Here we look into the older languages, speech patterns and quantization.  

Possibly such tracks can be created.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
