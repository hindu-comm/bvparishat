Dear Prof. Bijoy Misra ji,  
  

Thanks. That was an instant response on your reply to Dr. BVK Sastry. If you feel that this should be developed as a research topic, I am yet to consider it in that direction. Meanwhile, if I understood you correctly \<*But we need not go outside Sanskrit.*\>, you do not want to correlate/compare some of the *shaastric* concepts beyond the realm of
Indian philosophy. So, the approach appears to be endogenous than exogenous. I'd like to state that the rigorous *poorvapaksha* concept is central to any *shaastric* theory, without which it is merely discarded as insignificant. However, its good to know that Bhartrhari spoke on *apekshAbuddhi*. Can you please drop a line on what he says?  
  

Next, in one of your replies to Sri Ajit Gargeswari in the same thread, you said that we need to 'discover' beyond 'verification.' I seek your help in understanding what is meant by 'discovery.' Also, I look forward to know the distinction between these terms. We try to use scientific methods/equipment just to understand what is there in the vast knowledge base, to further our knowledge to realize 'whether it is half empty or half full.' And recently, our prime minister Modi ji has added to this saying - 'it is half filled with air.'  

  

With regards,  
Prasad
