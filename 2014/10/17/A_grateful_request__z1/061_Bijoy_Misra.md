Dear Dr Prasad,  

  
"verification" and "discovery" are two independent concepts. You can think that "discovery" is the prior step to  

"verification." My thinking is to identify a set of problems that can be tackled as challenge problems using  

the modern analytic experiments. One such problem could be the completeness of Sanskrit alphabet (phonemes)  

and rationalization of their independence in production. Another could be the categorization of human emotions  
and search for any clue to their effect on the production of speech. I will take some of my thinking to the  

World Sanskrit Conference to Bangkok next year. My goal in BVP is to compile the problems that the scholars  

would have observed.  

  

Bhratrhari gets into *apekshAbuddhi*.in the second book of his vākyapadiyā. It is past the 200 stanzas. I don't have  
the book with me now (library).  It is in the area where he talks about the anticipation through hearing. Anticipation  

is a concept which needs examination. I will record it as the fourth problem in my listing. I have interest in it.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
