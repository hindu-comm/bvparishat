So you raised the question only because he told you and without checking the group.

  

Here is the link it was posted in the group before you complain.

So if your act is not unfair, how can the moderator could act more fairly?

  

This is the post I saw yesterday itself and your request for eqnuiry after 23 hours the post was posted.

  

Of course, one has to be patient till the postings are accepted by the moderator and posted to the group. It may take time and may not appear immediately. This applies to your post also. I take it granted you might have posted to the group yesterday itself and it was posted to the list today now only. It is also possible for the gap of 23 hours. But he should have read it yesterday ITSELF, if he complained today to you. No other posts by Nadim was received or rejected after the post in the link.

  

Hope this clarifies the matter.
