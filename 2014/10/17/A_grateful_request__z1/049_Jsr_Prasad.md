I believe, your reply is based on my comment, but not Prof. Paturi's :)

Poornam is in consonance with other terms like anantam etc. If the shoonyam that you say is advocated by Buddha, then it may be convincing, as his followers have took it otherwise. Paramacharya of Kanchi has interpreted the Shantimantra of Isopanishad the following way - 'whether poornam is multiplied/divided/subtracted with poornam, what remains is poornam only.' And I should stop here saying anything on this knowing my limitation.

I could not find any typical term amongst the 16 sutras (again, shoonya is used in 6&7th sutras, source: wiki).

I think, you are speaking mathematically.

Does not it vary from *shaastra to shaastra*? Needs more elaboration please. My feeling is, technical terms used in *shaastra* are domain specific. Is not a herculean task to condense the essence different terms in to one word and apply to certain concepts like zero? You are well aware that in Vedanta the term '*uparati*' means withdrawing senses from objects, but in *loka*, it is quite opposite to this. Similarly, *vyabhicAra* in Nyaya means deviation of the probans from probundum*,* but in *loka* (especially in Telugu usage), it is the corrupt use of one's talents for personal gain. Just I am thinking aloud.
