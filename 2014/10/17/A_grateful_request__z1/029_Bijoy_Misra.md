Dear Dr Gargeshwari,  
Excellent point.  

Any new approach must not be a "verification" but a "discovery".  

For a few years I have thought of designing language experiments on Bhratrhari.  

What he says is all true and can be experienced. But there is a "why" factor.  

The same thing is true with many aspects of grammar, recitation and music.  

My experience on these topics is raw. So I submitted for guidance from the  

group where the scholars have been active longer.   

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
