Dear Dr Sastry,  
  

As I wrote in my mail, I would like all to be more proactive than find what is wrong etc.  

Think more fundamentally like "what" and "how".  

Most of the "connect the dots" are wrong and must be discarded.  

I observe some "connect the dots" still going on in other garbs.  

They are not interesting. We need to come up with sharp problems  

that can be probed with science tools and multidisciplinary analysis.  
  

I have two so far from this list:  

1. Spectral analysis of sāmagāna to find musical notes  

2. Importance of syllables in semantic information (given to me as varṇavāda)  
  

Let us try to make it twelve. Pre-Paninian linguistics is important.  

Please create a (or many) problem definition(s) as you see it.  

  

I had seen a posting on the titles of PhD thesis. I can check that list if someone  

has access to it.  
  

Thank you.  

Bijoy Misra
