I found the following on the website
<http://www.sanskritacademy.org/achievements1.htm>



8) Ekadanta Vidya (Sanskrit Speech Synthesis)

-   Exclusive program for Sanskrit speech synthesis: The Academy has
    undertaken speech synthesis and speech recgnition in Sanskrit for
    the last two years. The wealth of information with regard to
    phoneties available in sastras is made use of to analyze speech
    sounds. -   The technology developed using this information would be most useful
    for the development of technology in other Indian languages for
    speech synthesis, speech recognition etc. -   A sample module has been developed for 'Text to Speech' under this
    project -   A module like 'Pratyahara' i.e., encoding system used byPanini can
    be easily understood by this -   Chart is provided for retrieving the sound, sthana and prayatna -   Waves of the picture can be seen and can be compared with the waves
    of two letters at a time.

There are many other such research centres where similar is being carried out.
