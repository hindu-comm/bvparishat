Dear Dr Prasad,  

  
"verification" and "discovery" are two independent concepts. You can think that "discovery" is the prior step to  

"verification." In the study of the evolution of the Sanskrit language our ignorance is so high that we have little  

to "verify." There are some correlation theories, which have questionable validity. They better be left alone.  

You can ask where is the ignorance. I am not going to debate it. I am only to discover myself here what  
people think the topics of research might be. Once I find some people who want to probe further we will make  
a team, find funding and do some activity as I have in mind. I think the problems could be in the hundreds,  

I want to contain in twelve at this time such that we can tackle. This is only an effort on behalf of the new youth  

and undergraduate teaching.  

  

Bhratrhari gets into *apekshAbuddhi*.in the second book. Go past 200 stanzas. It is in the area where he  

talks about the anticipation through hearing. It is probably peculiar to Sanskrit. We have to think of an  

experiment to assess anticipation. Is it purely by hearing or through synthesis as the new research would  

indicate. We can discuss further in smaller groups. You can write to me privately if you are conversant  
with the literature.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
