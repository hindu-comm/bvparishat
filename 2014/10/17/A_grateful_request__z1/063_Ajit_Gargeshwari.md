You are absolutely right As you, Dr, Bhat, Dr. Prasad have already indicated.One cannot change the whole learning teaching and research methodologies that Indian Institutions have or are following there is no need for that. Many groups groups at various centers of learning are involved in such researches and teaching. Expertise skill set and focus is there. Unless the initiator of the thread has a focus or clarity on what he needs or looking at precisely there is no point in discussion Every scholar and list member will have a idea or thought to share. Without institution funding, scholars who are already identified and are willing to come up with an actionable proposals which we in our profession always do such discussion will be without focus. This list can act as platform for idea or subject matter discussion provided one is clear as to what one can expect and one needs. It is now up to members to decide if they want to post on this open ended non conclusive thread or close this threads with correspondences off the list till a firm idea or proposal has come up Then further discussion can be pursued. Ideally this should be theme for a conference....
