Just as the other members already suggested, the effort should have specific goal, and not just an unclear idea.

  

The general conditions laid by our Naiyayika-s for any action to be realized is precisely described in a verse:

  

चिकीर्षा कृतिसाध्येष्टसाधनत्वमतिस्तथा}

उपादानस्य चाध्यक्षं प्रवृत्तौ जनकं भवेत्।

  

Fist, willingness to do a thing, and the capability ofdoing,the certainty of being it is harmless and desirable to the doer, and the material (platform) to act upon. If all of these conditions are fulfilled, the effort would produce the action.

  

  

I am not elaborating the above conditions, but all the above conditions are obligatory for any successful action. The above possibilities are already pointed out by earlier members.
