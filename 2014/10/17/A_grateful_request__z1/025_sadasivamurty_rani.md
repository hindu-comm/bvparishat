On this occasion I would like to share some of my experiences in the Sanskrit Audio album productions.

As an honorary associate of some private Music Recording Companies of AP I had to spend several hundreds of manual hours in recording studios in the process of recording and editing many Sanskrit Devotional Stotra albums on Vishnu, Siva, Ganesha, Parashakti and so on.

As their associate I was requested to take care of the accuracy of the singers' pronunciation and correctness of the text being recited as per their source material.

Here I would like to place on record some of my experiences.

1. Mostly I used to sit with them while the recording was in progress and help them in pronouncing correctly. So while recording itself some of the contents were mostly corrected.

2. Sometimes some contents were recorded in my absence. There were found several instances of mispronunciations and misplacements of syllable too. After the recording was over the singers wouldn't be available. In their absence I had to edit the texts rectifying their mistakes.

The mispronunciation instances were usually of the following nature:

1. Uttering an alpaprana in place of mahaprana.

2. Uttering a mahaprana in place of alpaprana

3. Uttering a long syllable in place of a short syllable

4. Uttering a short syllable in place of a long syllable.

(The last two for the sake of Tala system or Rhythm adjustment).

It was my duty to rectify all such mistakes with the help of the recording technician without disturbing svarasthanas, without effecting RAGA system, or scale and maintain the appropriate length of Rhythm too..

In this process Myself and my friend Dandapani, an experienced recording engineer, spent some hundreds of manual hours to develop certain methods to edit the audio contents to agree with the source texts. We could be successful in doing so and now we have our own ease in doing such corrections.

This experience made my efforts easier in our University while producing many audio-visual albums as I am the Director of the Audio-Visual Projects of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati.

I extended this information to you all to say that it is possible even in the absence of the main singers to edit the audio content to agree with the source text as far as the shortage of syllabic instants and homogenous syllabic misplacement is concerned. If some words or phrases are missing we have to invite the singers and request them to sing again.

With Warm Regards and Deepavali Best Wishes to all,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
