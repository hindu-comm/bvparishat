Dear Sri Bijoy Ji,

As I have been observing from the first mail you have posted in this thread where the churning process was begun to find out all possible ways to explore into new age research in Sanskrit it seems the cream of the efforts is slowly getting solidified as reflected in your latest mail in response to the mail of Sri HN Bhat ji.

At this juncture I would like to share more of my thoughts and at the same time I intend to supplement to the thoughts of Sri HN Bhat Ji.

As stated by Sri HN Bhat Ji to carry out interdisciplinary research one needs a thorough knowledge of both modern sciences and Sanskrit with equal command. Otherwise in the pursuits of that person dependency on others and other sources shall be more.

As my observations of the ongoing posts of this thread help me to understand your heart your intention inclines more towards objective study with more practical and analytical outlook than the subjective study of descriptive nature on the problems those can be traced out from various fields of Sanskrit. Your intention seems to me more towards micro-level study of problems than a mere macro-level study.

It is definitely a noble idea to carry out research of this kind.

But how many researchers from the younger generations are capable of carrying out this kind of research without proper guidance of any senior researchers of this field?

My another question is - Is it not essential to have the first hand subjective understanding and a keen macro level comprehension of more than one field of the Sanskrit disciplines as the inevitable prerequisites to start any kind of objective level of study or micro-level study?

These aspects may be given some due importance while chalking out a programme for carrying out new pursuits in the field of Sanskrit.

Now I focus up on your phrase : "Research topics in Sanskrit for the undergraduate studies"

As specified by you the entire concentration shall be to integrate Sanskrit research to the college curriculum and tracks of problem statements towards that end are to be created.  

Here I feel some analysis assessment of present day Sanskrit studies in India and abroad may be necessary at UNDER GRADUATE LEVEL.

If it is the case in India in the present situation an Under Graduate student of Sanskrit is commonly in a position to start his fresh journey to peep into various fields of Sanskrit.. He is still a person being made and not a ready man to plunge into the field of research. His knowledge levels may not be adequate to take up any such challenging pursuits. Such pursuits may leave him to remain a half baked person by the time he receives his degree.

  

I don't know how is the situation and level of Sanskrit undergraduate students abroad.

**Hence A Suggestion**:

If it is at Post Graduate level it can be experimented in institutions where Sanskrit education is offered through exclusive Sanskrit medium of instruction providing sufficient knowledge of modern languages like English.

This is not the end of my sharing. But I pause here awaiting reflections from the other learned members on my observations. 

With Warm Regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
