Thanks Dr Iyengar.  

I will take this as a third problem, possibly articulated as  

(iii)Search for the concept of "zero" in Indian literature.  
  

I am an oDiA (Oriya) speaking person. Searching in some old literature I find the  

use of अ to negate a noun. While this persists in Oriya the negation concept  
is diluted in Sanskrit. The constructs that we see are like सत् असत्,
गुण अगुण  

in literature. But oDiA use can be arbitrary, like पाणि अपाणि, कर्म अकर्म and more.  

While अ words become qualitative later, in oDiA they stay as pure negation.  

I don't know the origin of this concept. But it has lately intrigued me.  

It appears as though the comprehension of an object could be binary.  

Either it exists or it does not exist. Negation of पाणि is अपाणि etc.  

After it becomes qualitative, it becomes an adjective like "un" in English.  

But oriya usage would let me negate any noun with an अ.  

I have not investigated how many examples exist in literature,  
but appears pretty general.
