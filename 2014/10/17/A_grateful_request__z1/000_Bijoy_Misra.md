Dear friend scholars,  
  

I am admirer of this group. I have been a silent reader for about two years now and have learned through your erudition and scholarship.  

I am no Sanskritist, make a living as a planetary and optical physicist.  

I came from a Sanskritist family and have been putting some efforts  

in understanding and appreciating the literature for the past twenty  
years. Harvard University and MIT have been my support base.  
  

I am writing this mail with a request. Having been abroad for forty  

years now, I have been concerned about the children's education  
and the general research on India. Through a collaboration with  
my students and colleagues I have thought of launching a public  

education project for Sanskrit with the aim of documenting all  
available information and research. The goal here is to present  

the information to the students in advanced High School and  

undergraduate level to help them appreciate why research in  

Sanskrit would be as challenging as biology, physics or engineering.  

I am particularly interested in thousands of young people of Indian  

parents who are joining the colleges every year. I have personally  

felt that a fresh open-minded analytic look would help unravel  

mysteries in the Indian culture, which are now shrouded in words  

or interpreted arbitrarily to create publications. I am thinking of  

both books and video for the presentation. They could also  

be used in India and in other countries.  

  

While I am finishing up this project proposal I thought to ask the  

group to help me tabulate twelve research topics that you think would  

be challenging questions to young minds. I have divided the project into six segments: (i) Phoneme, (ii) Word, (iii) Prosody, (iv) Grammar,  

\(v\) Literature, and (vi) Sanskrit and the World. Please feel free to  

post your idea and I will try to collate all by the end of the month.  

Make it a one sentence statement if you can and be as direct and  
clear as possible. There are young scholars here who might pursue  
the topics for their research. Of course any of you who have expertise and experience in creating material for younger audience may collaborate with me in the project.  

  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
