1\) How far the Kartikeya (born to Krittikas with brother Vis'Akha) legend falling (Skanda) from the sky on the Sixth Day after a New Moon (MahAbhArata) is correlated with the modern knowledge of the Taus hasrid group of asteroids and meteoritic showers appearing once in six months? In which parts of India the Skanda festival is observed twice in a year? l Is this KArtikeya (KumAra) same as Sanat-kumAra?



------ I have a book called "Essays on Indo-Aryan Mythology" by Narayan Aiyangar, published by Addison and Co, Madras; 1901 . In its part II, There is an essay called 'Kumara' pp27-80. This book in almost all essays has astronomical explanations for Vedic and Puranic myths. For the Kumara mythology too there is an astronomical explanation here. Thought should be useful.
