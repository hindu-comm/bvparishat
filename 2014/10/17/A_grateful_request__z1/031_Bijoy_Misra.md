Dear Dr Shastry,  

The conceptual understanding of zero could possibly predate its philosophical or academic application.  

The realization that our sensory perception is limited and there is a world of information that is unknown  

to us might be the early perceptual concept. My thinking is that it is a natural binary separation of  

identity and non-identity in the brain. How it symbolizes into a sound or mark would be an interesting  

part of the research. I am recording.  
I am away the next couple of days. Shall rejoin Friday.  

Happy Diwali.  

Bijoy Misra
