Two articles immediately occur to my mind regarding zero. Will send the exact references a little later :

(1) Kha and other words denoting zero

authored by Ananda K Coomaraswamy.

(The article is philosophical in nature)

(2) Zero in Panini

authored by MDPandit of Poona

(Prof Pandit has a highly mathematical approach, and is accompished in statistics).
