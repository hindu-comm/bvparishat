Dear Friends,

  

Happy Deepavali.

  

  

The Govt. of India has constituted 2nd Sanskrit Commission to devise its Sanskrit policy. The Commission is in need of information with regard to Sanskrit; the number of institutions providing traditional Sanskrit education, the number of Colleges and Universities providing Sanskrit education along modern lines, the research institutes prosecuting research on Sanskrit subjects, the position of Sanskrit in Schools, the stage up to which it is taught, whether it is compulsory/elective/ optional subject, the NGOs working in the field of Sanskritâ€“as a matter of fact, any information relevant to Sanskrit.

  

  

Now,

I am sending Sanskrit Questionnaire in 4 pages in pdf. along with
text file in Unicode font.

  

Regards,

S. Mukherjee

Consultant, Sanskrit Commission, New Delhi.
