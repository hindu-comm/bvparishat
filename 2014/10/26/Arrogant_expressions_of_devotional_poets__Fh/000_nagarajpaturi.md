I found the topic 'arrogant expressions of devotional poets'by moderator Ajitji in a related thread interesting and I hope it might interest other members of the list too.



To the extent that I remember, I would classify these expressions into the following varieties:



1\. Expressions that no one can do anything to me as I am protected by my Bhagavan/ Bhagavatee, sometimes in the form rebellious tones against rulers and their rule:

e.g.

जाको राखे साइयाँ, मारि न सक्कै कोय ।  
बाल न बाँका करि सकै, जो जग बैरी होय ॥  

తక్కువేమి మనకూ రాముండొక్కడుండు వరకూ

(What deficiency do we have as long as Rama (who aloneis enough) is there with us.)





2\. Affectionate pampered expressions of demanding one's own Bhagawan/Bhagavatee for worldly or spiritual favours



3\. 'My Bhagavan/Bhagavatee is mine alone' kind of expressions of affectionate / loveful possessiveness.



4\. Vyaajastuti expressions/ Apparently arrogant and indirectly humble expressions



Members may join with the examples they remember.



Members may add other varieties of arrogant expressions of devotional poets too.
