'Arrogant' expressions of women devotional poets such as Akkamahadevi and Meera Bai is another interesting sub-category within the present category under discussion.



There are husband-defiant , marriage-defiant, family-defiant expressions in this poetry. Challenges to claims of masculinity by males are provided here based on a 'super-gender' spiritual reality of both male and female humans.



Meera defies Rana and challenges him to kill her if he could with the confidence of a protection from her Lord.



Akkamahadevi says (<http://www.virashaiva.com/akka-mahadevis-vachanas/>):



"I am no helpless woman  
I utter no futile threats  
I am nothing daunted  
I shall dare hunger and pain  
I shall steal out of withered leaves  
A wholesome meal  
And on pointed sword  
Shall make my bed.  
I am ready for your sake  
To dare the worst  
To die this instant  
The readiness is all  
Oh! my Channamallikarjuna". 1
