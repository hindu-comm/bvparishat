A note on the translation:

  

It seems he referred to his past experience that the G0d had to be obliged. When the Bauddha's attacked his existence, Udayanacarya prove the existence of ईश्वर. In my opinion, he saying now you have forgot the service done my service, in the past as you earned money and ignore me.
