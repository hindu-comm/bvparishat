Jagannatha Pandit also expresses some such feelings in the Gangaalaharee,beseeching Her to bless him and prove the worth of Her epithets,otherwise,She stands to lose Her position as a Mokshadaatri.

I faintly remember that in RV.7.86 or 88,Vasistha also has some quarrel with Varuna,expressive of his bold approach. These are some of the traits of an ardent devotee.

In Marathi literature,Sant Tukaram was also this kind of a fighting/quarrelling,but,devout devotee of Vitthala.
