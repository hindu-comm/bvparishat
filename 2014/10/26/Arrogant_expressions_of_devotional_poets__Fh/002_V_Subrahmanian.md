Here is a verse popularly believed to be of Udayana, in this genre:  
  
ऐश्वर्यमदमत्तोऽसि मामवज्ञाय वर्तसे।  
उपस्थितेषु बौद्धषु मधीना तव स्थिति:।।  
  

The above verse has some slight variants too. The meaning is: Udayana, disappointed in not getting Puri Jagannatha's darshan, addressed the above words to the Lord: O Lord, You stand arrogant with Your Lordship and are ignoring me. Let the Bauddhas come (with their arguments to deny Ishwara), and You will find Yourself in my mercy (for I will have to advance counter arguments to 'prove' Your existence.\]  
  

The above verse was discussed in this forum in the past.
