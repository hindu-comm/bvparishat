Respected Members of BV Parishat!

Pranams to all. One of my friends Dr. Ch.Durgaprasada Rao from Agra mailed me this information and link. As the mail shows it was received by him from some other source in which there was a grand list of recipients of this mail.

When I clicked on this interestingly two Americans are reciting Some Mantras of Rudram very sonorously. But the video seems shot from a distance. So I have my own doubts about the genuineness of the news. Still to confirm with any other known persons of this news I posted this here.

Perfect Rudram Chantingin the White House by American duo(Jeffrey Erhard and Robbie Erhard)!
