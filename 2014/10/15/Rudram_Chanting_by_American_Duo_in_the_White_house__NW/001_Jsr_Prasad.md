Namaste.  
  

The duo perfected the intonation which is really a great feat! As the up loader of this video, Mr. [Sai Santosh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChuFIqOhAbKWgCvzjeWYdhQ), stated, it is not an endorsed meeting in white house, but the annual meeting of Hindu-Americans. Interestingly, both of the American brothers studied at Sri Satya Sai High School, Puttaparthi, Andhrapradesh since class I. Their father played 'Vaishnava Janato' etc. before this rendition, it seems. This may bring some clarity. Can we consider this gesture as an appreciation of Indian culture.  
  

Regards,  
Prasad
