Dear Scholars,

  

I am in search of a recent book/s-either in Sanskrit,Hindi,Marathi,Gujarati or English- on the Beejaaksharas in the Deveemaahaatmya or Durgaasaptashatee and their explanation.

  

I request all the scholars to kindly help me locate some books on this topic and oblige.

  

Greetings for the Diwali and the New Year.

  

Thanks and regards,

  

Siddharth Y Wakankar
