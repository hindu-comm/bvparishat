Namaste,  
  
There is a book called "beeja-mantrAtmaka-sapthasathi" which i have seen. It should be either with Motilal Banarasidas or with Chaukhamba.
For every sloka, there is a beeja which ends up with 700 beeja mantras for 700 slokas. It thought of purchasing that, my acharya who taught me the chaNDi pATa advised me not to purchase as chaNDi sapthasathi itself is a mAla-mantra and stuffing the brain too much beeja mantras would lead to "chitta-vibhrama".
