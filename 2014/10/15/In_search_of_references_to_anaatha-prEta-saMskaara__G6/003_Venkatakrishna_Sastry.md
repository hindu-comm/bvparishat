Namaste Ra.Ga. ji

  

1. The issue of ' Anatha-Preta-Samskara' - has several layers of understanding and action. Thisis analyzed in detail in Dharma Shastra. The current update ( at least hundred years old !) is Dharma Sidnhu. ( <https://play.google.com/books/reader2?id=vOxDAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en_GB&pg=GBS.PT723>
) .Relevant section starts at book-page 680 onwards.

The word 'anatha shava' is mentioned on page 684 of the reference text.

  

On page 692, the disposal of such bodies in specific context is indicated ( Throw in to water /Throw down the mountain).

  

Cremation without Vedic rites is another option on page 693.

  

On page 698, if the death of' anatha' is known to bein specific modes, then specific ways of disposal are indicated.

  

On page 699, the contemporary practice of the author is indicated. The stories we hear about the old man going on pilgrimage to jump and end life in the holy river Ganga ! Today we may call this as suicide or murder .

  

  

The technicality locked in Sanskrit language needs a careful analysis. Especially when the current society is not in the same frame as (1-a) ' Vaidika Varna-Ashrama compliant community' and

(1-b\_ State is NOT under the binding rule of ' King observing Dharma (Raaja -Dahrma) and

(1-c) Religion (opinions-Faith) has overtaken the Dharma -System and

(1-d) Rules of State /Nation in the Constitution and Acts scripted in English do not go by the model of Dharma-Shaastra in Sanskrit.

  

This is one of the reasons why the discipline of ' Religion specific Chaplaincy' has become a globalprofession under the umbrella of Medicine Care at Hospitals and part of Military establishments.

  

In lighter vein, If Vaidya-Raja as ' Yamaraja Sahodara' is bound to push the patient to sure end, then ' Chaplain' as ' Purohita-Sahodara'
needs to function as the opium -pain killer to make the journey less painful /rather accept the end willingly ! After all the 'Soul' needs to be released from the lock of 'Body' ( which is medical challenge) and the released soul needs to be Saved for God's grace ( Chaplain's Religion Problem).

  

2. The topic is also covered in Artha Shastra - About the responsibility of state for the disposal of ' Body without life', which can become a health hazard ( Social perspective) or State and military issue of sensitivity and significance ( for those who lay their life in war for State / and no relative can be traced for the final rite). This is about the responsible relation of State /King to the employee and citizen of the state. Mahabharata Shanti PArva has some suggestions on this model.

  

3\. Summary position, as I understand:

  

3a) First priority is for safe and healthy mode of body matter disposal. - Address the health hazard and local Peace. In order of priority, Family members, The community, the State holds responsibility for timely and sanitary disposal of body. ( The State Health department has rule based provisions for this. The state as to bear this expenses.
There are communities in India, which wont allow the disposal of body till the financials are settled.The modern practice in Hospitals is not to release the ' body of the diseased' for at least 24 hours after death, to ensure that the person is really dead; and not going to be resurrected again ! The official reasons for this practice are the ' medical provisions' to prevent ' spread of any untoward disease which might have infected the diseased ? ! ).

  

3b) Second is Anthyeshti Kriyaa: If details known about the antecedents of the person, provide a appropriate ' Vaidika Vidhi'. If NOT KNOWN, the State provides the generic Vedic Disposal model of rites. (The Indian government has provided the Vedic rites of Cremation to all the Prime ministers whether they deserved it or not !)

  

3) Third about ' aashaucha' and ' Karma-Vimokais for relatives as their duty and relations befit.The perceived relations and the Dharma shastra guidance operates. (This is purely a matter of Dharma -Social Obligation and Inheritance claim issues. The rules under each category are contextual and case specific Many litigations on property inheritance and succession rites are due to unresolved issues on these matters. The legacy goes back to the roots of Mahabharata war. Apart from Dharma issues, the key problem was the issue of succession rites, which remained unresolved ! If one carefully looks at the conditions which Dasharaja (Father of Satyavati) put for Shantanu for the marriage and the Bhishma-Pratjna issue, the magnitude and complexity of this issue becomes clear.

  

4. Concluding,

This topic of 'Prayana Kaala preparation' (Gita Chapter 8 -Sloka 9 to 13)- deliberated more than five millennium earlier by great minds of India - reading \<***Om ity ekaksaram brahma vyaharan mam anusmaran**Yah prayati tyajan deham*** \> seem to have slipped out of Indian community at large; and now the focus of ' transit of the departed through the Goloka / Vaitarni' has ended up as ' belief' and ' blind faith for strict compliance'.

  

What is the remedial action if any needed ?

  

I look for suggestions.
