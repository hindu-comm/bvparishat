In the Srimadbhāgavatam here is a verse:  
  

देवमीडस्य शूरस्य मारिषा नाम पत्न्यभूत् ।  

तस्यां संजनयामास दश पुत्रानकल्मशान् ॥ 9.23.27  
  

वसुदेवं देवभागं देवश्रवसमानकम् ।  

सृंजयं श्यामकं कंकमनीकं वत्सकं वृकम् ॥ 9.23.28  
  

In the book titled 'Bhāgavata sāram' Part 1, edited by 'Anna' of the Sri Ramakrishna Māṭha, Chennai, on page 510 the above verses appear with the reference numbers given therein. The next page in this book has a chart where Rohiṇī and Devakī are shown as wives of Vasudeva and Balarāma (Rohini's son) and Kṛṣṇa and Subhadrā are shown as children of Devaki.  
  

From the verse it appears the name of Vasudeva's mother, that is Shūra's wife, is 'marīṣā'.
