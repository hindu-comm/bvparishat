Dear Sriram,

  

I am writing this for the benefit of the list members who might have downloaded the book from the link given by you and were not able to comprehend it on account of that being in Telugu.

  

In a certain portion of the book, the author argues on the same/similar lines as in the book Ganesh-Vidya the scribd link for which was given by me in one of my previous posts in this thread that different script symbols of the Devanagari script evolved from portions of the symbol**ॐ.**
