Namaste,  
  
One of the vedic scholars of andhra desa by name brahmasri chirrAvuri sivaramakrishna wrote a book called  
"sruti sourabhaM". This can be downloaded from the link below. Kindly refer to the page no. 35 of this book. He did extensive research on the "bhArateeya lipi" and "brAhmi lipi".  
  
Exclusively, a chapter has been dedicated to the bhAratIya lipi which says all the praNava is the source and all other  
lipis have been derived from praNava lipi only. The praNava has been first recorded in "brAhmi lipi" and later on "dEvanAgari lipi" was derived from brAhmi. So, among the two forms of praNava which the vidyArthi showed, the former one is the symbolic diagram which was first recorded in brAhmi. The metamorphosis can be viewed diagrammatically in this book. Later, when dEvanAgari derived, people started using the latter version of praNava.  
  
The metamorphosis of dEvanAgari from brAhmi, the transformations are given in this book. A good book to read which is really a food for thought.
