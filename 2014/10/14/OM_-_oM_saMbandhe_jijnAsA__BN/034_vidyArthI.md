Respected Sir,

  

I am unable to download Ganesh Vidya, if you could forward it as an attachment would be great. May be after getting this read, I could be able to link the dots.  
  
Again to be clear and to-the-point, I am not asking anything about the religious value of ॐ, its greatness, its usage in Tantra or else. I have just a confusion which is still a confusion to me, there are many replies with varied responses.

  

Should I think that ॐ is just a symbol ? Shouldn't it be linked with Devnagri vowel 'ऊ' ? If that is the case then how the symbol got into existence because the sound we heard for ॐ would match only if we write it as 'ओं' \| Is there any reference of book where I could find that 'ॐ' the symbol is the Pranavaakshar ?

  

It is told that ॐ the first of beejmantras ? If so then it should also be pronounced like other beejmantras like 'ह्रीं', 'ऐं' 'क्लीं' etc. which are pronounced as are these are written, not like 'ॐ'  
  
I would like to collect some references if possible. I am sure you'll help me out overcoming my confusion.  
  
Thanks,

Vidyarthi
