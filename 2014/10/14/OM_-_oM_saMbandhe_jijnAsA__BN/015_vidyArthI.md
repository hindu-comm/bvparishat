Thank you very much Dr.Subrahmanyam !  
  
What I understood ओम्is made ofअवdhatu which is used for 'To protect' andमन्प्रत्ययः \|अकारस्य वकारस्य च ऊठ् will makeअव toओ \|  
  
Isओम् representing ॐ, while writing it in devnaagri/ Sanskrit ? I am confused with the sound Om, symbol ॐ, and its written representation ओं, ओम् \|  
  
Are there any references available where all of these are proved/ written one and the same?

  

Thanks,

Vidyarthi
