Thanks Dr. Bhat ! I am obliged you replied.  
  
Thanks for looking at my question although my Sanskrit is not that good. I'll make good use of the information you provided for the words I used. Thanks for that.  
  
Should I think that ॐ is just a symbol ? Shouldn't it be linked with Devnagri vowel 'ऊ' ? If that is the case then how the symbol got into existence because the sound we heard for ॐ would match only if we write it as 'ओं' \| Is there any reference of book where I could find that 'ॐ' the symbol is the Pranavaakshar ?

  

It is told that ॐ the first of beejmantras ? If so then it should also be pronounced like other beejmantras like 'ह्रीं', 'ऐं' 'क्लीं' etc. which are pronounced as are these are written, not like 'ॐ'  
  
I would like to collect some references if possible. I am sure you'll help me out overcoming my confusion.  
  
Thanks,

Vidyarthi
