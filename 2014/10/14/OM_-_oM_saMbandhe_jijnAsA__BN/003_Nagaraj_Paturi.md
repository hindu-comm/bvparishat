1\. **ॐ** is a symbol comparable to swastika symbol. It has got not only an articulatory/ sound significance as a script representing ahuman-pronounced sound or a sound that exists independent of human pronunciation, but also has a visual significance, a shape believed to give a certain magical effect through sight/vision.



2.ओं,ओम् etc. are not such esoteric /magical symbols . They are just devanaagari script symbols for a certain human-pronunciation. It is the same as ஓம், ఓమ్, ఓం,etc. of any other Indian script or for that matter, same asōm of the phonetic roman script.



3. Pronunciation of **ॐ**is not the same as the pronunciation of ओं,ओम्.



4.**ॐ** is believed to be a sound that exists independent of human pronunciation. (Even that sound is believed to be the sound-form manifestation of a certain vibration/pulse which is Brahman (the ultimate imperishable out of which everything is made).



5. 'Pronuncing' **ॐ**is considered to be an attempt to bring that sound that exists independent of human pronunciation into the form of human sound. That process of production of **ॐ**sound is a process that requirestraining from a Guru who is trainedcorrectly in that process.



6. For the purpose of closest description, that can be described as closest to silence and that sounds something like theśruti sound of tānpūra.
