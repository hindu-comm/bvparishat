Dear Dr Gargeswari,  
I wish I had new material.  

As a fellow researcher, I wanted to suggest that we should restrain  

from imaginary statements. Like any good research, it would help  

to divide what we know and where we accept by assumption.  

We can also state our empirical experiences. I have difficulty  

in labeling them as facts. The students have a right to ignore.  

Some cosmological speculations could be done, but it needs work.  

It is just a suggestion looking from a distant land.  

Best regards,  

BM
