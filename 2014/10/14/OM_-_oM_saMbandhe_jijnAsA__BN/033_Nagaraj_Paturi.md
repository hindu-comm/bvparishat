Dear Dr. Bijoy Misra,



That is exactly what I was saying. All my statements in this thread have been open-ended with phrases such as 'it is believed to be' and so on.



Woodroffe quote has a declarative statementthat can be counted as a claim that he knows. But my purpose of quoting that was to prove that there really is a ***belief*** such as the one expressed in the quote, since I made a statement earlier that such beliefs exist.
