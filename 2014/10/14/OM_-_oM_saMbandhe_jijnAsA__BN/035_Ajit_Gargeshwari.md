Dear Vidyarthi,  

=========note============

  
As I have indicated earlier on this thread we need to close this

t

hread

. 

The questions you have asked has been answered.

 ॐ as used in Tantra as in upanishads grammatical derivations and pronunciation. If you are asking about Beeja Mantras its in the domain of religion so your statement " I am not asking anything about the religious value of



ॐ, its greatness, its usage in Tantra or else" is contradicting  
  

What references are you trying to collect many references has already been given by Prof. Paturi
