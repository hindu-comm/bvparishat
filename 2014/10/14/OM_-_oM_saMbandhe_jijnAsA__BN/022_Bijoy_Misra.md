This is a kind of quote that goes in literature. It is a off-the-cuff statement made by someone  

who had little knowledge what it is all about.  
  

At the same time a research on OM is necessary. It would be very helpful if someone can  

create a problem statement that can be researched and analyzed. The Om discussion was  

useful, we have to distill to find why.
