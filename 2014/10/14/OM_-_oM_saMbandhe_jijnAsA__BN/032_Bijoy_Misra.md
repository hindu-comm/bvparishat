Dear Dr Paturi,  

I did comment on the Woodroffe quote. The declarative sentences are made by some to claim  

that they know. Our scholarly writing has been more qualified. "we think so", "it has been suggested"  

or mostly "scriptures tell us". There is a difference as there is difference between "God is seen"  
and "God is realized". The latter is a private experience, the earlier is a scientific statement when  

God is an object. As we enter this new millennium I would urge that we get back to the analytic  

writing that our earlier scholars produced. Analytic writing is open-ended, it solves some problems  
and opens new ones. India could create the vast literature through this open-ended analysis.  

So the statement, as we approach truth, truth recedes further away!  
  

I will try to say more about syntax next week. Syntax interests me.
Regarding **ॐ**we could  

say it's a symbol representing the primordial origin of the universe.
We cannot say how the origin  

happened. Then the question is how to pronounce ओम्,, which has its own subjectivity.  

Various texts written by some religious scholars both east and west are pure hyperbole,  

though I do not know why they were commissioned. They are not scholarly. Some seem to continue  

to map conceptual thoughts to physical processes or objects. The processes are much more  

analytic.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
