ॐ as per the Upanishads and many commentators on the upanishads,  donot accept  ओम् " is a Sabda or a single word - if followed by a हल् it will get अनुस्वार and becomes ओं (मो’नुस्वारः - पा सू)।." ॐ is ia symbol which stands for three letters अ उ म . The symbol ॐ stands for प्रणवः different from ओम् though ॐ is prounced as ओम्  
  
प्रणवो धनु:शरोह्यात्मा ब्रह्मतल्लक्ष्यमुच्यते।  
  
अप्रमत्तेन वेद्धव्यं शरवत्तन्मयो भवेत्।।  
  
In the Puranas the syllable Om became associated in various ways with the sects. Saivites mark the lingam with the symbol for Om, while Vaishnavites identify the three sounds as referring to the trinity of Vishnu, his wife Sri, and the worshiper. The symbol is used in the practice of Yoga and is related to techniques of auditory meditation.  
  

In Jainism ओम एकाक्षर पञ्चपरमेष्ठिनामादिपम् तत्कथमिति चेत "अरिहंता असरीरा आयरिया तह उवज्झाया मुणियां" and Buddhism ॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ also
om is used
