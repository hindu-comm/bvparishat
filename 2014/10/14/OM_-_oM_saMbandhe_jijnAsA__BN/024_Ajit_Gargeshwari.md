Dear Bijoy Misra

  
At the same time a research on OM is necessary. It would be very helpful if someone can  
create a problem statement that can be researched and analyzed. The Om discussion was  
useful, we have to distill to find why.

  

Instead of making remarks why don't you point out to literature on OM relevant to the discussion on the thread. Please create a problem statement and your views I think almost all aspects on OM whatever was needed has already been discused I am open to further posts if we have any new material. Thanks
