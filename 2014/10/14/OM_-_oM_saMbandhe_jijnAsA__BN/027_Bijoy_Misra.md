Dear scholar friends,  
  

Let me expand a little what I have said in various mails during the last couple of days.  

Through the last fifty years we have developed a substantial population of people  
of Indian descent abroad and currently there is a sizable population of new generation  

of boys and girls in all major universities. it is increasing every day. These children  
are not encumbered by the stress of survival as was the major concern when we were  
growing up in the '50s and '60s in India. India's economic condition is changing but  
the old education system and the text books are still used. The youth do drop these  
when they come out of the parental control. In India they get into software to work for  
some strange outsourcing companies. Some are also leased to work abroad. In the  
US the children are taught to be independent through the schooling and to do adventure  
in life. Some parents push their children to find traditional security in family business or  
service work, but quite a few get into creative pursuits and research and do very well.  
Like people of all lands, all think of their ancestry and feel pride in it.  

  

The goal of the project I am creating is to tap this new generation and orient them to  

research in Sanskrit. Sanskrit is India's contribution to the world and it has major  

impact towards learning, literature and composition. We have to help recreate some  
of the scientific methods that might have been used to formulate the language.  

We have to think the world as the audience. We have to come out of the traditional  

descriptive mode of who did what. We must get into how and why.  

To create a coded literary language from an oral speech language is a significant  
analytical triumph. There have been many triumphs on the way to help create  

the prolific literature. My request to each of you is to look into your line of work and  

discover where you think analytical approach must have been applied. We do not have  
records does not mean that analysis was not done. While it is unfortunate that we have  
not been able to find the sketches, but it is equally wrong to say that people just wrote  
down from nowhere. We have to come out of myths and hear-says. There is no  
comparison to Sanskrit in the world. We have to be the rightful inheritors of this treasure.  
It is difficult to fit into the big shoes but we must also acknowledge that they were human  
shoes. People like Panini and Bharata might occupy the researchers for several  
generations.  
  

I am grateful to the moderators and all scholars here who are doing huge amount of  

work for the cause of promotion of Sanskrit. As a parent and teacher abroad my  

orientation is towards the new breed of youth. I believe we can create powerful  

visuals and text materials to demonstrate the enormity of the research in Sanskrit  

that must have been undertaken and recreate them from the point of view of cognition,  

speech, understanding, memory, composition, organization and knowledge creation.  

  

Let me request each of you to share your thought and expertise to help create a new  
set of language scholars worldwide.  
  

Thank you.       

Happy Diwali.
