Dear Vidyarthiji,



Let me put it like this.



There are two human-produced sounds that are being discussed here: 1. The one for which a special training is believed to be required, special trainings being given. The same is believed to be existing independent of its production by humans as 'inner song' of human beings or the all-pervading vibration/sound/silencewhich is a form in which the Brahman(the ultimate imperishable entity of which everything is made) is manifest.



 2. The one forwhich no special training is believed to be required and iscasually pronounced as any other sound. This sound is not believed to be existing independent of its human pronunciation either as an 'inner song' or a manifestation of Brahman.



 These two need two different script/graphemic representations. Whichscript symbol represents which sound is a conventionfollowed by people. **ॐ**is being taken as representing #1 above. Whether ओम्, ओं are being taken as representing #1 above or #2 above depends on the context or the intention of the writer of the script. To consider that **ॐ** is the same as ओम्, ओंin the sense of #2 above is wrong. To consider that
**ॐ** is the same as ओम्, ओंin the sense of1 above is right.********
