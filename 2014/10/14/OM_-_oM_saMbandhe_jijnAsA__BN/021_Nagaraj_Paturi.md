"Creation commences by an initial movement or vibration (*spandana*) in the Cosmic Stuff, as some Western writers call it, and which in Indian parlance is *Saspanda Prakriti-Sakti*. Just as the nature of *Cit* or the *Siva* aspect of *Brahman* \[Supreme Consciousness\] is rest, quiescence, so that of *Prakrti* \[matter\] is movement. Prior however to manifestation, that is during dissolution (Pralaya) of the Universe Prakrti exists in a state of equilibrated energy.... It then moves... \[t\]his is the first cosmic vibration (*Spandana*) in which the equilibrated energy is released. The approximate sound of this movement is the *mantra* Om."
