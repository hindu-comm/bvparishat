This is a kind of quote that goes in literature. It is a off-the-cuff statement made by someone  

who had little knowledge what it is all about.  



 - Which quote Bijoyji ?



If it is about Sir John Woodroffe's statement from Garland of Letters, let me clarify the following:



In my previous postsin this thread, I repeatedly used the phrases such as'it is believed to be', 'it is considered to be'. To substantiate that it is really *believed* so or considered as such, it suffices to quote the words of those who believed so or considered as such.



Even the videos were substantiations of the fact that such a belief / such a consideration / such a notion exists. It doesn't in any way amount to be a claim of validity of the belief.



All substantiating references cited in all academic works do exist in some sources. If not search engines,library consultation or some other activity can take people to those sources and the references in those sources. But writers of academic worksdo cite them to substantiate their statements.



Nowhere in the thread did I make any claim of validity of any belief mentioned by me. 



Yes, research is required to verify the validity of the beliefs.
