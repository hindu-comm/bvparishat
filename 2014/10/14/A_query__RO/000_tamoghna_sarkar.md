Dear Scholars,

Kindly opine about the key difference between Buddhist conception of *svasamvedana* and Madhva's conception of *svavedyata.* They both contend thatthere is only one act of cognition,in which it illuminates

an object, but in so doing it invariably illuminates itself. Is it Madhva's conception of *saksi* as pure consciousness that is key to his theory of the ascertainment of cognition? Please comment.
