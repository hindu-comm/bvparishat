Namaste

Thanks sir, for all points made here.

First of all, question was not about just kAvya but Manas. Manas is not just kAvya because it has rAmAyaNa as content (vAlmIki rAmAyaNa is almost veda.. वेदवेद्ये पुरे पुंसि etc.).

And although I can agree that kAvyas do not *necessarily need* commentaries for discovering "poetic" ideas, we might need help of a commentary when some issue related to धर्मार्थकाममोक्षs comes up. As the reader might be distanced from the poet (better the *writer*), the contemporary commentator will try to convey the idea intended at a particular place according to his own shastra knowledge, which the reader might lack. The reader cannot always be expected to have the *vaicakShaNyaM* as you can yourself see, it is only *after**reading* the kAvya that he is going to obtain it as a fruit..! That is phala of good poetry.. cannot be had in the beginning itself.

But coming to present issue in case- with Manas, it is more "neeti/dharma content" based interpretation than poetic issue.

Whenever I wanted to read any mahAkAvya, I was advised by my teachers to go with Mallinatha for discovering inner heart of the poet. May be without him we might ourselves do it better- but not without previous "sahRdaya" experience. Mallinatha commentary is not bare poetic-idea explanations, but he picks up many shastra issues and answers and explains them for the knowledge of the reader. That is what I meant when I said- "vyAkhyAnato.." etc. I know it is vyAkaraNa shastra pertaining statement but according to my experience, the commentaries for other works can be taken in same lines.

Here the member who raised issue was saying that we have to *discard* some sentence *altogether* as it is *uncivilized*" according to *her* explanation!! This is "alakShaNam" - (as we have already seen, Manas is not just a kAvya) Altogether wanting to remove a sentence makes no sense, and hence going for a commentary will be a better idea, in my view. Here understanding the standing of writer on certain issue is primemost.

In fact, reading different commentaries on kAvyas as well, sometimes, gives deeper and multi-faceted insight into what poet has wanted to say. Sometimes the commentator excels in the idea explaining, which poet might look feeble at..! I have come up myself across such commentaries. (Eg. tApI Dharma Rao's "vijaya-vilAsam" commentary in Telugu) That's a different concept- what a good commentary is and which not.

But our respected member was altogether denying the commentaries saying- they are all trying to "justify the unjustifiable." "*you people* will say so and so.." etc. That's sheer prejudice and branding. Why will someone want to do it? There are instances where commentator will say- "this is wrong or unfair" openly (as in case of *vArtikas* in shastras)*if (and only if)* the poet happens to be really messing up any well-established shastric issue. And that too never without apt and optimum proof.

One more thing- Life is for learning. Learning involves learning what is right and unlearning what is wrong. And when others help me correct in the latter, it is welcome act. So here life style is learning and not ‘depending on others for my corrections’. It is obvious that we make mistakes when we are unaware of them. Someone making us aware should not be objectionable.

Hope I am clear now.
