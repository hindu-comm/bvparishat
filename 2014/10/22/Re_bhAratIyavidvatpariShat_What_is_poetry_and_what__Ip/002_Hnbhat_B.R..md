I have not said about any particular poem. The remaining goes with belief. The statement of Bhamaha is also in general and covers all types Bhakti Kavya also. It depends on one's outlook.

  

And the question takes in Bhakti Kavya, also all the Stotra-s in its realm as having Bhakti and even Vatsalya, in its Rasa concept of poetry. The question of Ramacarita Manas was a different one as the validy of his statements quoted here, which is out of the scope of Kavya properly said. The thread in which Ramacarita manas was quoted, took a dwindling path, from the original question, started with curiosity, "why male animals were sacrificed in Yaga-s" which itslef is encompasing many questions and was taken up as the question implied "there was animals sacrificed in the scriptures, which was not acceptable for all in our forum, and took as the question of animal sacrifice in Indian tradition, (which includes Tantric and Vedic, for both sides could be defended and argued against). And encompased, in the same question, male animals were preferred to female animals, was taken up separately as the question of male domination in the tradition in general and took up far away, as applied to the treatment of the women in general in the men made scriptures quoting from all available sources which drew in the quotations from Ramacharita Manas. Then it took up the way to the validity of such statements, metaphorical as real life statements togather, and lost its way from the original question and the original question was lost sight in the thread. And took up the form of the way poems are composed, with Ramayana, as the poem and took the question further away and the statements of Commentators as invalid and misleading, which you are dealing with the same thread So there is no point in mixing up everything in a thread.

What Bhamaha said, I think you have misunderstood. Bhamaha has no objection to learning a poetry with the help of a commentary, but if the poetry is to be understood only with the help of a commentary only, what is the diffeerence between the Shastra and Kavya? Kavya is meant for enjoying reading and not for learning DharmaShasrra, VyakaraNa, without much effort. For that one has to learn the respective Shastr-s themselves. But one can have a general idea of these, by reading the poems. This is what meant by Bhamaha.

This is wrong interpretation of the maxim. alakshana means doubts do make a lakshana, an alakshana. (meaningless). Nobody denies the part played by the commentaries in learning the poem. Especially, Mallinatha, explicitly declares his purpose:

  

इहान्वयमुखेनैव सर्वं व्याख्यास्यते मया।

  

and I have explained and extended its application in this thread to any general writing:

  

especially the second part:

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/cwPcJGMnNWo/4oMi5jmN1gQJ>  

  



But Mallinatha has not written commentary on any drama and one will have tre.o learn the different types of drama-s also to enjoy the variety of expressions of classical literatu

That is her/his view and manner of looking as unfit anything other than her own writing and a sweeping statement in support of her argument. Finding fault with any other's writing as the present day spirit, like the one who wanted to review Valmiki Ramayana afresh. I don't say analyzing both merits and demerits of a thing, is not good criticism. But the earliest remark in this respect is by Bhratrihari, "परगुणपरमाणून् पर्वतीकृत्य नित्यं निजहृदि विकसन्तः सन्ति सन्तः कियन्तः".परगुणपरमाणून् पर्वतीकृत्य नित्यं निजहृदि विकसन्तः सन्ति सन्तः कियन्तः. How many are the great saints who delight everyday in considering even a single good quality (be it as insignificant as an atom) found in another person as a great noble characteristic of mountainous proportions!

  

So it is natural today, to shine oneself by finding faults in others, the normal trend. The others are very rare and still rare who recognize both merits and demerits, are still rare.

  

गुणदोषौ बुधो गृह्णन् इन्दुक्ष्वेडाविवेश्वर:।

शिरसा श्लाघते पूर्वं परं कण्ठे नियच्छति॥  

  

Even one does find any demerit, the above is another quote. Such scholars are very rare.

"Unjustifiable" was mean that he/she could not justify according to his/her knowledge and took it as unjustifiable generally, which implies she/he knows everything and others do not know what she know. Such statements themselves need to be ignored as unworthy and haught statements.

Just one more thing. Life and learning. The whole life time is not enough for learning everything about a single subject. There is an instance of some Rishi who spent his whole life and when a god appeared before him and asked if I give you an extension of life for one life time, what would you do? He replied I would learn more. She showed a great mountain and said to him, what you have learnt for your whole time, is a lump of mud, as compared to the ocean of knowledge. So even if you take so many rebirths, you may not be competely exhaust the mountain of knowledge. I do not remember the original source of this story.......

I have not written this to continue the arguement in the other thread or argue with you further, but make clear the quotes in my message and do not want to continue unnecessarily the discussion you have started.
