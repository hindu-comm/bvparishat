Hence I started this new topic in a new thread.

It is better to correct ourselves from our mistakes and not to take care not to repeat the same mistake a second time, than making it a life style.

The above maximव्याख्यानतो विशेषप्रतिपत्तिः न हि सन्देहादलक्षणम् is not the general spirit of Bharatiya traditionalists. But it is the spirit of a Shastra especially used in व्याकरण. and not the general rule for poetry.

Better to say they tried to show what they understood according to their learniing and make others appreciate the way they comment or criticize what they wrote. They never tried to defend undefendable for your learning and understanding in the present day.

Please see what our earlier critics opine before making your comments about Shastra and Kavya. The poets composed poetry for their pleasure and please the readers of their time. Even if the contemporary reader would not appreaciate their literary piece, he composed in the hope of finding some reader who would be able to think in the way he thought while composing the poetry in the wide world and large duration of time to come.

  

"उत्पत्स्यते ममही कोऽपि समान धर्मा कालो हृययं निरवधिर्विपुला च पृथ्वी”  

  

So what is needed to appreciate the poetry is to think what the poet felt and hence the reader is said to be सहृदय and not merely the grammar and syntax.

This has been explained having the view of the poet. This has been already said by the कविसहृदयचक्रवर्तिन् आनन्दवर्धन,

  

शब्दार्थशासनज्ञानमात्रेणैव न वेद्यते ।

वेद्यते स तु काव्यार्थतत्त्वज्ञैरेव केवलम् ॥ १.७  

सोऽर्थस्तद्व्यक्तिसामर्थ्ययोगी शब्दश्च कश्चन .

यत्नतः प्रत्यभिज्ञेयौ तौ शब्दार्थौ महाकवेः .. ८..

  

I do not want extend the topic unnecessarily. Just would like to quote the the scholar poet Bhatti's statement who wrote his poetry to make his readers equally scholars like him so that there is not left any unscholar reader.

  

*व्याख्यागम्यमिदं काव्यमुत्सवः* सुधियामलम्‌।

हता दुर्मेधसश्चास्मिन्‌विद्वत्प्रियतया मया ।।  

  

He wrote his शास्त्रकाव्य to teach शास्त्र through his काव्य as his motive itself in composing it. Of course it is also काव्य, but requires his readers to be scholars in शास्त्र to appreciate his poetry.

  

In reply, Bhamaha, who declared the purpose of poetry is mainly the enjoyment of reading the poetry and not teaching anything beyond it is minor objectives.

  

"धर्मार्थकाममोक्षेषु वैचक्षण्यं कलासु च ।

करोति कीर्तिं प्रीतिं च साधुकाव्यनिषेवणम्" ।। इति

  

as the general objective of reading poetry. This was the way the poetry was looked and composed by poets of his time. Even then, depending on the commentaries to understand the poetry is not recommended:

  

  

काव्यान्यपि यदीमानि व्याख्यागम्यानि शास्त्रवत्‌ ।

उत्सवः सुधियामेव हन्त दुर्मेधसो हताः \|\|  

  

This is what the earlier critics had remarked about the poetry and its purpose. This was criticized by later critics and साहित्यदर्पण maintains it is रस that makes the sentence of the composition a काव्य and which could not be understood by commentaries, but only enjoyed and felt by a सहृदय.

  

Still there were many शास्त्रकाव्य-s and their readers as well as काव्यशास्त्र which has grown as an independent शास्त्र- itself and their readers, like the readers of महाकवि-s कालिदास, वाल्मीकि etc, though today we interpret ourselves with our present day knowledge of our society and complain the commentators distorted the poetry by their commentaries, without making any effort to understand the poet and the readers of his time for whom the poetry was written. This implies that we only know what the poet meant in his poetry and all other commentators only helped to distort the things the poet wanted to convey. But the commentators never said they only know what the poet intended, but only to make the readers know how they understood the poetry.

  

IN Shastra-s one cannot understand *properly* without depending on the commentaries. It is great if a beginner of Sanskrit language, knows the शास्त्र with his knowledge of Sanskrit language and blames the commentaries as distorters of the original idea of the शास्त्र handed down traditionally.
