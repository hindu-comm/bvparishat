Sir,

Your making my comment on Manas topic- as base for making clear 'what is poetry'- had made it appear to me as if my point was not taken in place.. because all I was trying to say on Poetry was in connection with Manas as kAvya in particular. Hence I thought an explanation was due my side.

My intention is only to explain, definitely never to argue.

If both are different topics, everything is in place. I realize what is poetry in general. Your explanation made it more clear to me once I take away Manas from the scene.

Thankyou for the ideas.

Let me keep learning however much in whatever way I am given chance and am permitted by Sri Life Mahodaya.
