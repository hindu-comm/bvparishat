Meaning will change if you drop the Visarga. Since MW lists the lemmas or uninflected forms (like Vacaspatyam, but unlike Sabdakalpadrumah), the Visarga should not be used. But dropping the visarga will be incorrect. In most cases, replacement by स् should suffice (वचस्, तेजस्), but at some places replacement by र् is needed (पुनर्).
