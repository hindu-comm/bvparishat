People who publish Sanskrit books (or for that matter, any book) will find the sUktisudhA book invaluable. The way in which the book is typeset and embellished with beautiful illustrations make the book an enjoyable read for children. The paper also is of a higher quality than seen in run of the mill books. For its quality, the book is reasonably priced (i had bought it at a discount, but i think the book costs about Rs. 800).
