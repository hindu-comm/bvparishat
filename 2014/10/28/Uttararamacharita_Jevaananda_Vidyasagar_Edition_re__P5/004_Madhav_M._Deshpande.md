As you can see from the attached page from the Catalogue of the Library of the India Office, the editions of the Uttararamacarita with coms by Ishvarachandra Vidyasagar and Jibananda Vidyasagar are two different editions, published in different years. So it seems that the copy that my University Library has (one by Ishvarachandra Vidyasagar) is not what Professor K T Pandurangi is looking for.
