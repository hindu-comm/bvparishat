dear scholars

happy deepavali for all.

Prof. K T Pandurangi has asked me to search for the scanned/pdf version of

Uttararamacharita of Bhavabhuti with Jevaananda Vidyasagar' commentary and published by the leaned commentator.

unfortunately he has lost his book and this is not available in DLI also.

I hope learned members will be able to trace a scanned copy.

thanking you in advacnce
