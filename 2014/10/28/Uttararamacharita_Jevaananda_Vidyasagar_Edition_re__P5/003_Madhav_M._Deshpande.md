The library of the University of Michigan does have a copy of the Uttararāmacarita with a commentary, not by Jibananda Vidyasagar, but by Īśvaracandra Vidyasagar, edited by Kumudranjan Ray, a 1966 reprint edition from Calcutta. Tomorrow I will get it from the library and see what condition the book is in. I am not sure this is what Professor Pandurangi is looking for, but will find more about this book tomorrow when I get hold of the book. Best,
