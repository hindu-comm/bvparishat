I may add here that **Aupacchandasika** is a family of metres, of which **Puṣpitāgrā** is a special case (or subtype).The definition of Aupacchandasika family of metres is

Odd feet: \<6 instants> + ra ya

Even feet: \<8 instants> + ra ya



Two subtypes, whose odd feet fit the patterns (1) and (3) in the question are



**1) Puṣpitāgrā**

Odd feet:

na na ra ya = (1 1 1) (1 1 1) (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = (1 1 1 1 1 1) (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = \<6 instants> + ra ya

Even feet:

na ja la ra ya = (1 1 1) (1 2 1) 1 (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = (1 1 1 1 2 1 1) (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = \<8 instants> + ra ya

Alternately expressed as

na ja ja ra ga = (1 1 1) (1 2 1) (1 2 1) (2 1 2) 2 = (1 1 1 1 2 1 1) (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = \<8 instants> + ra ya



**2) Mālabhāriṇī** (also called **Upodgatā** and **Vasantamālikā**)  

Odd feet:

sa la la ra ya = (1 1 2) 1 1 (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = (1 1 2 1 1) (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = \<6 instants> + ra ya

Alternately expressed as

sa sa ja ga ga = (1 1 2) (1 1 2) (1 2 1) 2 2 = (1 1 2 1 1) (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = \<6 instants> + ra ya

Even feet:

sa bha ra ya = (1 1 2) (2 1 1) (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = (1 1 2 2 1 1) (2 1 2) (1 2 2) = \<8 instants> + ra ya



References for name Puṣpitāgrā for the first subtype are abundant, but not for second one. Here are the references I had used for the names Mālabhāriṇī/Upodgatā/Vasantamālikā when I compiled the two prosody appendices of the Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam. The appendices are in the pages 175 to 179 (PDF pages 183 to 187) and can be seen here

1) Page 192 of The Abhijñānaśākuntalam of Kālidāsa: With the Commentary of Rāghavabhaṭṭa, Various Readings, Introd., Literal Translation, Exhaustive Notes, and Appendices (ed. Moreshvar Ramchandra Kāle, MLBD, ISBN 9788120802834), the editor gives the name Mālabhāriṇī and states it is a special type of Aupacchandasika. <http://books.google.com/books?id=mE_Zvd6zWFwC&pg=RA1-PA192>

2) A footnote by editor Dharanand Shastri on page 169 of Vrttaratnakara (MLBD, ISBN 9788120826786) gives the name Vasantamālikā for the same metre. The editor expresses surprise that the metre is honoured by great poets but does not find mention in the standard prosody works nor major commentaries.<http://books.google.com/books?id=8Sg4N4ho6bMC&pg=PT196>

3)On page 179 of the MLBD edition of the Prakrit epic Kamsavaho (ISBN 9788120824003), the editor A.N.Upadhye gives both names for the metre - Vasantamālikā and Mālabhāriṇī. <http://books.google.com/books?id=SjSHaMKFtMYC&pg=PA179>

4)The website of Universität Heidelberg cites the name Upodgatā for this metre.<http://sanskrit.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/Chanda/HTML/v_upodgatA_0.html>
