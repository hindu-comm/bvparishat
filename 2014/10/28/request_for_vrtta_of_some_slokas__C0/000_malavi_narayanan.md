Namaskaaraah

I am looking for the names of the vrttas having the following ganas-

1. न-न-र-य (दशरथतनयो विदेहकन्यां)

2. स-न-ज-न-भ-स (रघुनायकसहजस्त्वथ मुनिमण्डलवशगो) – Is it करिणी?

3. स-स-ज-गौ (मुनिरप्यथ जातकर्म कृत्वा)

I would be grateful to have the definitions as well as the text from which they were taken.

Regards,

Malavi
