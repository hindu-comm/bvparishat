As prof. Kannan has said the first one is the structure of the odd lines in the metre puShpitaagra, while the third one is that of the odd lines in the metre aupacchandasikaa. The second one is of course, metre kasriNee as guessed by Smt Malavi. Any way, we do have some rare samavRtta-s that match with the given patterns. But they are are not freely used by the master poets. KariNee is a straight layaanvita metre and has an intrinsic rhythm that follows the rUpaka taala (karNatic Music) or the Ek taal (Hindusthani) faithfully.
