hariH OM,  
  

 The words below are with no offence to you. It is my appeal to you to take it in the right spirit.  
  

 Sir, this is not an arbitrary forum to discuss anything that you wish. This forum is for discussion on samskR^itam, shAstra, veda, etc. Not to help you out on matters where you will get enough help online. There are thousands of places online where you can learn / discuss these things. Don't bother vidvaans of the group with nitty gritty issues which are very personal to you.  
  

 Please think before you fire off your mails, and please use the help of <http://www.google.com>  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
