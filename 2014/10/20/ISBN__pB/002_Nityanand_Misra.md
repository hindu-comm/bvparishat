Namaste  
  
In 2012, I had the first-hand experience of getting ISBN numbers for three publishers - a university and two trusts which I volunteer for. We received the numbers in around five weeks time. One of our volunteers used to work very close to the ISBN office in Delhi, so he personally submitted the forms and followed up just once (personal visit again) after four weeks. There are no costs involved (except of mailing the forms). The staff at the Raja Rammohun Roy Agency was very helpful.  
  
Here is the form hosted on the MHRD website  
<http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/upload_document/isbnproforma-revised.pdf>  
  
I have the copies of the filled forms for our trusts from 2012, if you are interested please mail me on my personal id.
