Prof. Paturi Ji

You may have missed the fact that the last syllable of a foot can be taken as Guru for the prosodical consideration. It is common to consider a Laghu as Guru when it comes as the last syllable of the foot.

For example the famous verse in Kumarasambhavam by Kalidasa

क्रोधं प्रभो संहर संहरेति यावद्‌गिरः खे मरुतां चरन्ति

तावत्स वह्निर्भवनेत्रजन्मा भस्मावशेषं मदनं चकार

is an इन्द्रवज्रा (स्यादिन्द्रवज्रा यदि तौ जगौ गः) even though three out of four quarter-end syllables are laghu (and not Guru as per definition तौ जगौ गः).

So if you take षु as Guru inसरसनृपसभामहोत्सवेषु, it perfectly fits the pattern न न रय.

Once again, request the last syllables of third and fourth feet to be taken as Guru, which would then fit the patternस स ज ग ग.
