I think that we had some discussion clearing that:  

there is nothing called advaita-sannyAsa, (a search of advaita sannyasi or sannyAsa will be enough)  

there is adhikAra of traivarNika according to shurti, smR^iti, etc., supported by sureshvarAchArya, etc.  

So, please don't drag this thread to any such discussion.  

Please, start some other thread to discuss these things separately.
