Namaste,  
  

Naga sanyashis do not carry any danda as from Akbar's time they have to carry the weapon "Trishula", supposedly to save the Hindu pilgrims during the Kumbha-mela, from being slaughtered by the anti-Hindu forces and that too was started probably at the suggestion of the emperor himself. Kindky correct me if I am wrong.  
  

I feel that the Danda of a Brahmaleen can be called Brahmadanda and the sage Vashishtha carried his Brahmdanda with him and he has supposedly told about the might of the Brahmadanda.  
  

Regards,
