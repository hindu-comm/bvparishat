The Śaṅkara-sampradāya (ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa-sampradāya) awards the sannyāsa order only to brāhmaṇas, or born brāhmaṇas



------There are many advaita sannyāsis who werenon-Brahmins in their pūrva āśrama.



nāga sadhus/sannyāsis of advaita affiliationdo not all come from
brāhmaṇas.



This is not about ēkadanḍa or tridanḍa issue. This is only about whether there were /are non-brāhmaṇa advaita sannyāsis or not.
