His work, in metric form on twelve darshanas titled द्वादशदर्शनसङ्ग्रहः gives a good idea of each of the darshanas. He has rendered each darshana in verses in Sanskrit and given Hindi meanings too. The book, published in 1988 and available in Anandavan Ashram, Swami Vivekanand Road, Kandivali (pashchim) Mumbai 400067 and Sri Dakshinamurti Maṭha, Mishrapokhra, Varanasi 221010, priced Rs.80 (paperback) and Rs.98 (hard bound) then, also contains a long introduction in Hindi in the form of essays on each darshana dealt with in the book. Quite a useful book.
