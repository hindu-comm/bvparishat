The Lalitopākhyāna is essentially a Śākta Upākhyāna, hence it is natural for Śakti or Lalitā to be shown as source of or power behind all Avatāras. Verses from other Purāṇas show Śiva or Viṣṇu as the source of or power behind all Avatāras, as well as the source of or power behind Śakti. If these independent verses in different contexts are quoted without keeping these differences in mind, we are missing the complete picture. The seemingly contradictory verses can be resolved with the Kalpabheda argument (their resolution is a completely different topic in itself). Gāṇapatya, Saura, Śākta, Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava are all authentic Sampradāyas based on Smṛtis and Purāṇas, and depending on one's Iṣṭa, one is free to choose one of these many paths laid down by Smṛtis and Purāṇas. An an unconditional and unqualified statement that Lalitā is the source of Vaiṣṇava Avatāras like Rāma and Kṛṣna is like saying that only those portions of Purāṇas with Śākta emphasis are authentic ones, and portions with Śaiva or Vaiṣṇava emphasis are not.  
  
Moreover, I disagree that these verses prove identity of deities. If they did prove the identity of Śiva, Viṣṇu and Śakti as claimed, then the five Sampradāyas would have all merged millenia ago. Rather, the verses reinforce the faith of the follower in his or her own Iṣṭa, who is to be taken as the Supreme deity.  
  
For Vaiṣṇavas like Haripārṣadadāsa Ji or me, the Bhāgavatam is the most authoritative Purāṇa (for other people of the list, it may not be the case). Here is Padmapurāṇa, Uttarakhaṇda, Bhāgavatamāhātmyam, Chapter 6, Verse 82  
  
śrīmadbhāgavatam purāṇatilakaṁ yadvaiṣṇavānāṁ dhanaṁ  
  
And hence Vaiṣṇavas are not likely to take the verses from Śaiva or Śākta Purāṇas or from Lalitopākhyāna with the same authority as those of Bhāgavatam.
