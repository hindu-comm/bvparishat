Thank you Nityānanda ji. I was under the impression that this list is flexible.  
  
So jayinī would fit better. How about jayikā?  
  

While composing the verse, I saw jayitā as an alternative reading in one of the brāhmaṇa-granthas (may be it was Jaiminīya-brāhmaṇa) but sadly I am not able to trace it back now. Then there are also examples of preritā and vijitā used but I think that either these are not proper grammatical formations or they are not formed out of ṛ-kārānta terms.
