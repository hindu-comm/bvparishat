I am not saying that. पाणिनि is saying that.

Such a feminine प्रातिपदिक does not exist. ऋन्नेभ्यो ङीप्‌ (पा॰सू॰ ४.१.५) is a mandatory Sutra, not an optional one, and has to be applied to all प्रातिपदिकs ending in ऋ. The only exceptions are covered in the स्वस्रादिगण. The relevant Sutra is न षट्स्वस्रादिभ्यः (पा॰सू॰\~४.१.१०).

काशिका lists the स्वस्रादिगण as a seven-member group - स्वस्रादिभ्यः। स्वसा। दुहिता। ननान्दा। याता। माता। तिस्रः। चतस्रः।

सिद्धान्तकौमुदी further confirms this - स्वसा तिस्रश्चतस्रश्च ननान्दा दुहिता तथा। याता मातेति सप्तैते स्वस्रादय उदाहृताः॥

कैयट says that out of the seven, तिसृ and चतसृ are not required to be enlisted since the non-ordainment of ङीप् for these two can be concluded by the ज्ञापक in न तिसृचतसृ (पा॰सू॰ ६.४.४) - ज्ञापकादेव च सिद्धत्वात्स्वस्रादिष्वनयोः पाठो न कर्त्तव्यो भवति. So as per कैयट, स्वस्रादिगण is a five-member group only.

**No source says that स्वस्रादिगण is an आकृतिगण. **

So whether you agree with कैयट or काशिका/कौमुदी, you have **only seven feminine** **प्रातिपदिकs ending in ****ऋ** -

स्वसृ। दुहितृ। ननान्दृ। यातृ। मातृ। तिसृ। चतसृ।

This is because in case of दुहितृ, न षट्स्वस्रादिभ्यः (पा॰सू॰ ४.१.१०) blocks ऋन्नेभ्यो ङीप्‌ (पा॰सू॰ ४.१.५). But not for जयितृ.

We need to see an authoritative grammar work, an entry in a traditional lexicon, or authentic usage before we can consider an extension of स्वस्रादिगण to include जयितृ.

From what I know, the derivation does not hold good since it starts with a non-existent feminine ऋकारान्त प्रातिपदिक. I will be happy to be proved wrong.

I also have doubts on the usage of जयितृ itself. The word is not listed in any traditional Indian dictionary or in वाचस्पत्य/शब्दकल्पद्रुम/आप्टे. M-W lists it, but M-W also lists other non-existent words like गवी. Digital Corpus of Sanskrit cites one usage of जयितृ, but the tagging by DCS is wrong as the verse has सभाजयितृ which comes from the root सभाज् = सभाजयति इति सभाजयिता. DCS taggers mistakenly split सभाजयिता as सभा + जयिता. As per Panini, सभां जयति इति सभाजेता न तु सभाजयिता.

You say the प्रातिपदिक is archaic, so I believe you have seen its use. Can you cite any examples?
