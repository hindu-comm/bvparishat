That is not possible.**kta** is a **kṛt** affix. **kṛt** affixes are to be placed after **dhātu-**s only.**jayin**(= jaya + ini by PS 5.2.115 **ata iniṭhanau**) is a taddhitānta prātipadika, not a dhātu. Even by taking **kvip**(**sarvaprātipadikebhyaḥ ācāre kvibvā vaktavyaḥ**) and forming a **nāmadhatu**, there would be a problem since the lopa of na you are referring to is by PS 8.2.7 **nalopaḥ prātipadikāntasya**.8.2.27 has **padasya**carried over. So you need padatva for the **nāmadhatu**,which does not exist for the elision of n.

If you want you can try this. **jayaḥ sañjātaḥ asyāḥ iti jayitā**. Use the taddhita **itac** suffix from the word **jaya**by PS 5.2.36 **tadasya sañjātaṁ tārakādibhya itac**. tarakādigaṇa is an ākṛtigaṇa. Due to PS 1.4.18 **yacibham** you get a bha nomenclature of the prakṛti. Then by PS 6.4.148 **yasyeti ca**there is elision of a to give jayita. Then by PS 4.1.4**ajādyataṣṭāp**, you take the feminine affix**ṭāp**to get the base form **jayitā**. However, the sense is again different. With the**itac**suffix,**jayitā**means "she who has turned victorious" (i.e. who is not victorious always, but has turned victorious now). Like **tārakitaṁ nabhaḥ** (the starred sky - the sky does not have stars always, but has stars now) or **puṣpitaḥ vṛkṣaḥ** (the blooming tree - does not have flowers always, but has flowers now). I doubt ifRādhārānī would like it. :)

  

Rather than trying to derive by any means, I would look for usage. If the usage is not found or untraceable, then it is a**navīna prayoga** (new usage), and anavīna prayoga has to be according to the rules of grammar. Else we are writing Prakrit not Sanskrit.
