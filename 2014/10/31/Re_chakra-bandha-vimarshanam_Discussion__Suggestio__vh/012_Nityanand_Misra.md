How do you form this word jayikā?

If you are taking the vun affix from PS 3.1.50 āśiṣi ca, i.e. jayatāt iti jayakaḥ then the feminine would be **jayakā** as the vārttika āśiṣi vunaśca na blocks the ikāra substitution.

If you are forming the word using the ṇvul affix from PS 3.1.133 ṇvultṛcau, i.e. jayati iti jayakaḥ, then the feminine form would be **jayikā**.

  

It depends on your intended sense. **jayinī/ jayikā/jayakā** – all have different senses of meaning, they are not perfect synonymns. Best to understand the connotations of the suffix and then choose a form. You may refer the**Kṛdantarūpamālā** or another work on kṛt affixes.

These, when used in feminine, are perfectly grammatical formations. The words are not ṛkārānta but ākārānta.

preritā = pra + īr + kta + ṭāp + su (nominative singular)

vijitā = vi + ji + kta + ṭāp+ su (nominative singular)
