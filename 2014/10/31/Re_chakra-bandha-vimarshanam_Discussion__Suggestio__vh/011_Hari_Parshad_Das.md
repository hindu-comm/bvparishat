or how about forming the hrasva-a-kārānta term 'jayita' by taking 'jayin' as the prātipadika, removing the 'n' at the end, adding 'kta' to give jayita and then adding 'ṭāp' to give jayitā?  
  

i am saying this because jayitā is also a common name for girls, so i think there must be some derivation possible.
