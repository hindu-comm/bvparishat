Namaste,  
  

My query is not directly related to the thread, yet may have a bearing on it. Has Radharani always been treated as a female? Was not she also addressed by Lord Krishna as Gopeshwar (yes, Gopeshwar) among the Gopis, during the Rasha-lila. If so that could be in keeping with the belief that Radharani was the avatara of Lord Shiva.  
  

Regards,
