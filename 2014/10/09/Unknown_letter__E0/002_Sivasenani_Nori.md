Please see the attached articles on the subject.

  

Late Professor M. Gopal Reddy was the Head, Dept. of Sanskrit, Osmania University and a great Vedic scholar. This article was published in the O. U. Sanskrit Journal. Unfortunately, I am unable to recollect immediately the year in which it was published.

  

The other paper has the source printed in the footnote, as of the date accessed.
