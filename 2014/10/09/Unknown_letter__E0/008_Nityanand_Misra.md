And it is a shame that this great an article by this great a scholar was neither proofread nor edited properly - lack of professionalism on part of the Journal reviewers and/or editors? Typos, mistakes, inconsistent punctuation - the table below is a list of what all is inconsistent/wrong on page 1 - all detected in less than one minute of reading. Such mistakes are unacceptable in works on grammar and phonetics which are fields of science.  
  
If these are the standards of Sanskrit publications from our Universities, why should we blame smaller Sanskrit publishers for not being professional in their proofreading and editing? I agree not everybody can match the editorial quality of Nirnay Sagar Press, MLBD, Gita Press or Chaukhambha but don't we deserve much better publications in our own language from our universities?

I can go on for pages 2 and 3, but is there a use?
