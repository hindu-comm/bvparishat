The symbol (Bahirgomukha) is the Vedic Anusvāra, which is pronounced as "gum" in some traditions. 

  

Long back I heard from a Pandit in Gujarat that it was (and is) believed that the "gum" sound for Anusvāra in Śukla Yajurveda Vājasaneyi Mādhyandina traditions comes from sound of the hoofs of the horse form ofSūrya who revealed the Śukla Yajurveda toYājñavalkya.
