Here's one more article. Unfortunately this article, the way I saved it, does not have any citation information. I wish I preserved the citation material as well, but here it is (I am confident that I was pointed to this paper on the internet when I downloaded that - so copyright should not be an issue).

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
