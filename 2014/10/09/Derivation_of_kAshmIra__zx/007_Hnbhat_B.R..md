Thank you for the information. I also saw the derivation. Now I found  
it in Monier Williams also:and he in turn refers to a Sanskrit French  
Dictionary:  
  
kaśmīra, as, m. (said to be fr. rt.  
kaś), N. of a country; according to Burnouf a  
contraction of Kaśyapamīra; \[cf. kāśmīra.\] — Kaś-  
mīra-janman, ā or a, m. n. saffron.  
  
कश्यपस्य मीरः would result in कश्यप-मीरः \|  
  
The contraction could be justified, with "पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम्  
P.VI.3.19." कश्+यप\]मीरः \> कश्मीरः।  
  
Thanks once again.
