There is no such word in Panini's Ashtadhyayi, as Kashmir, but the word कश्मीर is used as the name of a people and their land, several times in महाभाष्य. But it does not give any derivation. I could not find any such derivation in both. This is what I can find. The site does not give either the reference to the सूत्र in अष्टाध्यायी, or महाभाष्य where the derivation is given.

  

अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत् कश्मीरेषु वत्स्यामः , यत् कश्मीरेषु अवसाम , यत् तत्र ओदनान् भोक्ष्यामहे , यत् तत्र ओदनान् अभुञ्ज्महि । अप्राप्ते : अभिजानासि देवदत्त कश्मीरान् गमिष्यामः , कश्मीरान् अगच्छाम , तत्र ओदनाम् भोक्ष्यामहे , तत्र ओदनान् अभुञ्ज्महि । (पा-३,२.११४)  

  

This is one of the contexts in Mahabhashya. But this and others do not give any derivation for the word. The word is used as the जनपद, and Kings of Kashmira country. But the word is not given in Ashtadhyayi.

  

The derivation in the above two meaning is:

  

जनपदे लुप् ४।२।८१. देशे तन्नाम्नि यश्चातुरर्थिकः प्रत्ययः भवति, तस्य देशविशेषे अनपदे ऽभिधेये लुब् भवति। ग्रामसमुदायो जनपदः। पञ्चालानां निवासो जनपदः पञ्चालाः।  

  

So it can be derived in both the senses. by the above rule. That is all. I don't know how such a remark is given.
