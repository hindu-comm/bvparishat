I am asking a specific question. Isकाश्मीर found in Panini's Ashtadhyayi.

  

One web site is saying yes Panini Grammar has reference to काश्मीर.

<http://koausa.org/language/BNKalla.html>

  

"Among the grammarians, the earliest referenee to Kashmir is found in Panini's (500 B.C.) "Ashtadhayi" and in Patanjali's great commentary on it. There the term "Kashmir" and its derivation "Kashmira" are stated as the name of the country and its inhabitants, respectively."
