Dr. Korada, I was talking about the word पार्षद. You probably mistook the word in question to be पारिषद.

  

I think it was clear from the context (the name of Sh. Hari Pārṣada Dāsa which I mistook as Sh. Hari Prasāda Dāsa) and my next sentence (“Also, हरिपार्षद refers to the 16 पार्षदs of नारायण ...”) in my email, but maybe you missed them.

  

So please allow me to reiterate both positions so that it is clear to the list (And yes, I stick to both guns J)

  

***पार्षद***

The word पार्षद is shown as पृषोदरादि in शब्दकल्पद्रुमः which gives two derivations as follows:

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/SKDScan/2013/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=3-130>


पार्षदः, त्रि, (पारिषद + पृषोदरादित्वात् साधुः . यद्वा, पर्षदि साधुः पर्षदो ण्यः इत्यत्र योगविभागात् ण इति कश्चित्) पारिषदः। इतिशब्दरत्नावली॥ यथा, भागवते ३.१६.२। “एतौ द्वौ पार्षदौ मह्यं जयो विजयो एव च॥”

वाचस्पत्यम् shows पार्षद as coming from the word पार्षद्, which itself is shown as पृषोदरादि from परिषद्. So indirectly, पृषोदरादि is invoved in the derivation.

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/VCPScan/2013/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=4320>

पार्षद्, स्त्री, परि सद् + पृषो०। सभायां त्रिका०।

पार्षद, त्रि०, पार्षदमर्हति अण्। पारिषदे शब्दच०। ष्यञ्। पार्षद्योऽप्यत्रार्थे भरतः।

  

***पारिषद***

The word पारिषद is not shown as पृषोदरादि by either शब्दकल्पद्रुमः or वाचस्पत्यम्. Links and entries have been shared earlier.
