Dear friends,  
  

There is a translation of the Kena Upanishad Bhashya in Marathi (Translation by Vishnu Vaman Bapat Shastri). I shall be thankful if any kind member can let me know how to get a copy of the same. I understand that this is a very unique translation. The book should probably be out of the copyright restrictions by now and sharing of that should be possible.  
  

Regards
