Dear Scholars,  
Pranam! There are many upasana padhhati in our country. As I am studying some, I came across Yantra vidnyan. It is said that the Devata of a particular yantra is seated on yantra. The yantra is said to be a Aasan.

I would like to know more about this vidnyan. Is it mentioned in any Veda or other vedic scriptures? Any book for reference or any scripture?

Please help me in this regard.

Thanks,  
Nishikant Pathak
