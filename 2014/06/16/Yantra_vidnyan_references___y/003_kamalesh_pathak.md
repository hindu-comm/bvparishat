sri nishikant ji, regards, i am traditional pandit doing all type of pojans so i am too eager to know about yantras, shardas tilah is good one - luckily i have a soft copy published by motilal banarasida- author is arthor avlon.

when we chant mantras during any devata sthaapan there is peeth devata
and yantra devata and to next them the pradhan devata is invited through mantra. so not only yantra but peeth is also some unknown part or secrets of karmakanda.

i will be happy if more details in this regards provided by learned members from this group.

regards,

kamalesh pathak
