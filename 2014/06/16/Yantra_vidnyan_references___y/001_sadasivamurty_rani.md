Dear Nishikant ji,

Yantras are not the seats of the Gods or Goddesses. They are the symbolic forms of those Gods and Goddesses representing the entire universe as the form that particular God or Goddess.

These Yantras are mostly not Vedic. A detailed information of various Yantras is available in various Tantra Granthas like Prapancha Sara Tantra, Sarada Tilaka and even in the Vashnava and Shaiva Agama Texts.

regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
