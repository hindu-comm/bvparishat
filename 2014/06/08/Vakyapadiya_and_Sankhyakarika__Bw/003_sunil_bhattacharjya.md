Dear Prof. Subrahamanyam,  
  

Thank you for your kind reply. Is it possible that Bhartrihari thought of writing the Vakyapadiya only after he finished his work on the Yuktidipika, the Vartika to explain the Sankhyakarika, by looking at the deep inner meanings of the Karikas? Bhartrihari was a monist whereas the popular impression has almost always been that Sankhya is dualistic, though together with Yuga they recognze the Superior (and unifying ?) Ishvara.  
  

Regards,
