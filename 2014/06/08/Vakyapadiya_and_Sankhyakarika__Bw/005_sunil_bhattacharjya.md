amaste,  

  
1)  

I used Monism, as many others do, only to indicate the Ekatva or Advaita.  

  
2)  

There could be two or more Bhartriharis. Manu gives permission to name the descendents after the ancestors. That does not really discount the possibility of there being one Bhartrihari who was the stalwart in the grammar of philosophy and that he could have a role of the interpretation of "Shabda" in Yuktidioika.  
3)  

I agree the experts like Prof. Ashok Aklujkar and others may be of immense help to clarify the issues.  

4)  

In Yoga the Ishvara is one who is beyond the hold of the Prakrti and the souls escaping (by way of Ishvara-pranidhaana) the hold of Prakrti cannot become anything different from the Ishvara, though that has not been elaborated. Otherwise there will be many Ishvaras, which is not acceptable. That elaboration that Ishvara is one, obviously has been left for the higher levels of Vedanta.
