1\. 'Monism' is a coinedEnglish word that may not very well suit the discussions onVaiyaakaraNa stand on Brahman and its relation with the Saadhaka.



2\. Whether Bhartrihari and Raja Bhartrihari are one and the same or not a dispute not yet resolved.



3\. Bhartrihari believed in knowledge in multiple Shastras since he says,



" प्रज्ञा विवेकं लभतेभिन्नैरागमदर्शनैः " . But hearsay about his authorship of several different books such as Yuktidipika or Saankhyakaarika needs thorough scrutiny.



Experts in textual criticism like Prof. Ashok Ajlukar only can help in the resolution of such disputes.



4\. Recognition of Ees'vara is part of Dvaita also. That is not an index of 'non-dualism' .
