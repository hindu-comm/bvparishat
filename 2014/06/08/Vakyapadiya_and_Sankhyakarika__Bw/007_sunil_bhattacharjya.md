You are referring to the three verses - प्रधानास्तित्वम् ....सह सिद्धिभिः - quoted by Vacaspati at the end of साङ्ख्यतत्त्वकौमुदी , in the context of षष्टिपदार्थी - राजवार्तिकम् । But this is निरीश्वरसाङ्ख्यम् - even there is the controversy about -पुरुषः(आत्मा) एकः or अनेकः (verse 18) between Kapila and Isvarakrsna.

Ishvarakrishna's treatment seems to be based on "the Sankhya dictum : Ishvara is Asiddha" and the role of Prakrti alone seems to be emphasized. particularly so in the few Karikas before and after the Karika 61. In this context it is also interesting to note that these few Karikas before and after the Karika 61are missing (or not attnded to) in the Yuktidipika.
