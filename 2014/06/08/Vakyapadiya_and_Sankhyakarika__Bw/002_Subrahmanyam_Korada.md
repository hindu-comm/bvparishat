Dear Dr Bhattacharya

  

There is no any reference to Yuktidipika/Rajavartika in Vakyapadiyam or its commentgaries.

  

I have not come across any direct or indirect reference by Madhava /Bhattoji/Nagesa etc. anywhere in their works.

  

I shalll keep in mind the point raised by you and in future , if I come across any piece of info , let you know.

  

Samkhyadarsanam is taken by Patanjali and Hari mainly in two instances - to decide Lingam and Anupalabdhi(atisaukhmyat...).

  

dhanyo'smi
