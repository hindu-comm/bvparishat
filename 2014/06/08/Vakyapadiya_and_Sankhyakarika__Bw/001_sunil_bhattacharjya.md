Dear friends,  
  

Please permit me to elaborate my mail as follows :  

It is the belief of some (including me as well) that Raja Bhartrihari, who wrote the Vakyapadiya, the treatise on the Sphotavada, is also the writer of the Yuktidipika, which also indicates that its author is a raja (king). It is known that Raja Bhartrihari gave up the throne in his prime of his youth to became an ascetic and his brother Vikramaditya succeeded him. Vacaspati Mishra includes two verses from the text of the Yuktidipika in his Tattvakaumudi, the commentary on the Sankhyakarika, and he calls that text as the Raja-Vartika. Thus, in short, the Vakyapadiya and the Yuktidipika could have been written by the same person, Bhartrihari.  

In this august forum there are eminent scholars like Prof. Ashok Aklujkar, Prof. Madhav Deshpande, Prof Korada Subrahmanian and several others, who are the present day authorities on Vakyapadiya and I hope they will like to throw some light on my query.

Regards,

Sunil KB
