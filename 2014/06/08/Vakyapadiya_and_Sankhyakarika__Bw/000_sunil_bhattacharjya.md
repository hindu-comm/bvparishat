Dear friends,  
  

Raja Bhartrhari is known to be the great scholar who wrote the Vakyapadiya as a treatise on the Sphotavada and he is the acknowledged authority on the grammar of philosophy and he is also believed by many to be the author of a Vartika on the Sankhyakarika, the authoritative text on the Sankhya philosophy. Such being the possibility, has any scholar come to know of any studies carried out so far, which throw light on the great Monist Raja Bhartrhari's appying the principles of Sphotavada in his Vartika of the Sankhyakarika ?  
  

Regards,
