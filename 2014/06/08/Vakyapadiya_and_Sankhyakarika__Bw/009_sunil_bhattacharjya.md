Namaste Prof. Aklujkarji,  
  

Thank you for your reply. I am sorry if ihad encroached upon your valuable time and you had to miss other deadlines because of that.  
  
I had the impression that a discussion on this topic will be incomplete unless and until you say something on it, and particularly so because you are an esteemed member of this forum. I have learnt that the author of the Yuktidipika might be having a similar view to Bhartrhari of the process of revelation of the Veda (or Samkhya knowledge), and both the Yuktidipika and Vakyapadiyavrtti quote the same description of the process of Veda revelation and transmission from Nirukta 1.20. I also learned that you also discussed this in your article "Veda Revelation according to Bhartrhari" in the book *Bhartrhari: Language, Thought and Reality*.  
  

You seem to confirm that YD was written later than VP (quoting Pandeya's dition) and that is possible even if both are written by the same author. You also said that Dig-naaga utilized Bhart.r-hari's work and it will be kind of you if you give the reference, of course, if you have the time.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
