नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Is it possible that Bhartrihari thought of writing the Vakyapadiya only after he finished his work on the Yuktidipika, the Vartika to explain the Sankhyakarika, by looking at the deep inner meanings of the Karikas? Bhartrihari was a monist whereas the popular impression has almost always been that Sankhya is dualistic, though together with Yuga they recognze the Superior (and unifying ?) Ishvara

Dear Dr Bhattacarya

  

Bhartrhari borrowed 'अनादिनिधनं ब्रह्म’ from शान्तिपर्व of Mahabhaaratam whrein सेश्वरसांख्यम् is also analysed ( Yoga also has got the name सेश्वरसांख्यम्).

  

You are referring to the three verses - प्रधानास्तित्वम् ....सह सिद्धिभिः - quoted by Vacaspati at the end of साङ्ख्यतत्त्वकौमुदी , in the context of षष्टिपदार्थी - राजवार्तिकम् । But this is निरीश्वरसाङ्ख्यम् - even there is the controversy about -पुरुषः(आत्मा) एकः or अनेकः (verse 18) between Kapila and Isvarakrsna.

  

It is difficult to decide as to whether Hari penned Vakyapadiyam or Rajavartikam first , assuming he authored both.

  

Just like Vacaspati he might have done one after the other or like Nagesa he was doing both simultaneously .

  

Finally it is अद्वैतम् - ie the अखण्डवाक्यार्थ established in Vakyapadiyam is akin to तत्त्वमसि of अद्वैतिनः।

  

We cannot go by stories/hearsay.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
