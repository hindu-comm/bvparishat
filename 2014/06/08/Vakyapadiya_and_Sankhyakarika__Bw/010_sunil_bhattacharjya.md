Namaste Prof. Ashok Aklujkarji,  
  

Thank you for your reply. I am sorry if I had encroached upon your valuable time and forced you to reply and you had to miss other deadlines because of that. I had the impression that a discussion on this topic would not be complete unless and until we hear something from you on it, and particularly so because you are a highly esteemed member of this forum.  
  
There seems to be a general opinion that the author of the Yuktidipika was a sort of grammarian, who was familiar with the vyakarana tradition from Panin to Patanjali and he treated the Sankhyakarika as Sutra and composed the Yuktidipika i two layers - Vartika and Bhashya. In this respect also Bhartrhari did seem to fit in well as the author  
  
I also understand that the author of the Yuktidipika might be having a similar view to Bhartrhari of the process of revelation of the Veda (or Samkhya knowledge), and both the Yuktidipika and Vakyapadiyavrtti quote the same description of the process of Veda revelation and transmission from Nirukta 1.20. I also learned that you also discussed this in your article "Veda Revelation according to Bhartrhari" in the book *Bhartrhari: Language, Thought and Reality*.  
  

You also seem to say that YD was written later than VP (quoting Pandeya's edition) and that is possible even if both are written by the same author.  
  
Now kindly permit me to refer to your following statement :  
Quote

  
The YD quotes Dig-naaga/Di:n-naaga. Dig-naaga utilizes Bhart.r-hari's work, but Bhart.r-hari does not show awareness of Dig-naaga's work. Therefore, it is not possible to place Bhart.r-hari and the YD author in the same segment of time. (See the introduction of the best edition of the YD published so far, namely the one by Professors Albrecht Wezler and Shujun Motegi.)  

Unquote  
  

However when I asked Shujun Motegi if in their Introduction to the book on Yuktidipika there is any statement that Dignaaga utilized Bhartrhari's work, but Bhartrhari does not show awareness of Dignaaga's work, Shujun Motegi clearly said that so far they have not discussed the relation between Dignaaga and Bhartrihari.  
  
Such being the counter-views I hope you would like to clear the situation from your side and all of us in the forum will be benefitted.  

  

Best regards,
