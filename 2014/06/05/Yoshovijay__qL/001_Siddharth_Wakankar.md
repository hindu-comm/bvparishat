Please refer to the excellent Reference Book,viz. Jinaratnakosha,edited by Prof.H.D.Velankar of Bombay.

Alternately,you may refer the the Volumes of the New Catalogus Catalogorum,University of Madras-under the entries of Nyayakhandanakhadya or Yashovijay.

Optionally, pl.refer to the Hindi Volumes(5 or 6) of Prakrit Sahityaka Itihas,wherein all details will be found.

Best luck.

  

Prof Siddharth Wakankar.
