Indeed it is a great time that shows respect to our culture. But concrete steps are required to bring Sanskrit learning at the centre of the main stream of general education of the country purely based on logic and not on emotion. It will bring about a sea change in the cultural life of this country. We need to interact with these MPs to give them exposure to our intellectual, philosophical, religious, spiritual, aesthetic and secular culture.
