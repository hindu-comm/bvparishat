Apart from gestures I hope the new government has and will implement a good Sanskrit policy which will fund various research projects and towards preservation of Sanskrit manuscripts and books spread across this country. They need to evolve policy that will attract bright talent towards Sanskrit research who can do good research and also have the ability to communicate it to others
