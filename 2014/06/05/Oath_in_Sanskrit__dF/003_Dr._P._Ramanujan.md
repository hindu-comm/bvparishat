Dear Ajit!



My suggestion is: to prepare some sort of clear and focussed project ideas, if possible, by individuals/teams/institutions in this regard.

There is a national mission on education thru ICT, a national curriculum framework and e-content creation on general, useful topics to

be telecast thru Direct To Home channels, having allocation for Sanskrit, besides and like other disciplines.



I find Sanskritists to be wanting in efforts to secure such funding, as it involves a lot of running around. But commitment and passion

could change situations.Being pro-active from this community can determine directions even for the new government.



Hope for the best.



Ramanujan
