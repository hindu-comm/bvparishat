Respected Scholars,  
  

In compound words like पिनाकधृक् etc what is the derivation of the word धृक्? There is another derivation for this same word in compound सर्वधृक् wherein this धृक् is derived from the root ‘ञिधृषा’. In the पिनाकधृक् what will be the root and what are the steps involved in the derivation, please clarify.
