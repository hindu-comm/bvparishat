Dear Sir,

  

Here is my attempt at translation of the verses into English. The construction of the first verse seems to be somewhat clumsy/convoluted.

  

S'loka - 1:

As did he teach Arjuna, the essence of thegItAof the Self, so has he, stripping me of my state of being useless (or purposeless) (apArtha-bhAva = apa-artha-bhAva) (punningly : my being a non-pArtha =a-pArtha-bhAva), \[which is in the form of\] the condition of feeling rich with the mere ego (=being full of ego), happily given me the message : put your effort forth (=compose this work/book); and \[as a consequence,\] you will attain your cherished desire here - may He, that Lord Krishna, the splendorous (s'rImAn)lad of S'rI Yas'odA, \[and\] my Supreme Preceptor, \[and\] the very plenitude of advaita, appear in front of me.

  

(Notes: ahamA dhanI = ahandhanI; tasya bhAvaH = ahandhanitvam; tat \[karma\])

  

Gist: The naive are full of ego. Ego is their wealth. Having ego as the wealth is a state (bhAva) which serves no purpose (apa-artha). Such a state is the anti-thesis of what Arjuna was

(a-pArtha).

  

He shed his ego when he said "I am ignorant. I am your disciple. I surrender. Instruct me."

  

I was myself thus in a state of ahandhanitva which is verily an apArtha-bhAva (sabhan'ga-s'les"a : apa-artha-bhAva and

a-pArtha-bhAva).

  

Krishna first divested me of that condition (mama taM bhAvaM pracyAvya), and then he gave me the message : Do \[your\] work here (Cf.: kuru karmaiva tasmAt tvam)= write this work (=a commentary on the gItA)

  

S'loka - 2

O Mother gItA! You have taken birth from the mouth of Kr's"Na (literally : the slayer of the demon Mura); \[whereas\] Gan'gA \[has taken birth\] from His feet. You (Note:emend bhavati to bhavatI; else the metre is violated, and grammar also) uplift all; \[whereas\] she drowns \[all\].

  

You rest only upon imparting (Note:prApya, ("on reaching") is a wrong construction used in lieu of prApayya) the treasure of the nectarean juice of the interior Brahman. Your power is no match \[whatever\] for this (=Gan'gA, the trivial), \[which is but\] a treasure of the dullards (punningly: a mass of waters - Da-la-yor abhedaH).

  

I hope this helps to some extent at least.

  

Regards

Kannan
