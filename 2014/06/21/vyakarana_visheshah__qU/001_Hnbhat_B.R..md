> 1\. अवतिष्ठते ,  

  

समवप्रविभ्यः स्थः  (1-3-22 ) इति स्थाधातोः आत्मनेपदम्।  

  

सम्, अव, प्र, वि इति उपसर्गेभ्यः स्थाधातोरात्मनेपदम्।

  

The above rule makes the verb with prefixes listed in the sUtra, आत्मनेपद, which is otherwise, without prefix, is परस्मैपद.

  

  

> 2\. माभैषीः,  

  

मा(ङ्) + अभैषीः - the rule

  

माङि लुङ्  3-3-175 makes the लुङ् लकार obligatory in association with the negative particle माङ्\| in the negative sense मा.



"न माङ्यागे  6-4-74" makes the अ in the लुङ् form disappear, in association with the negative particle माङ्।

  

  

This is the व्याकरणविशेष in the above usages, and it is not a complete derivational process of the forms.
