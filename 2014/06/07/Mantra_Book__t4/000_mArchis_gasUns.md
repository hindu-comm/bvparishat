Namaste,

  

 I'm not familiar with the topic of mantras. I need your guidance. I understand that it is not only linguistics. But as life flows I'm in need do dive deeper. I'm reading Gonda's book, Harper and Staal. But that's the story, not the mantras. Are there any authoritative collections of mantras? Good books on bija, nama and suktam mantras? What if I need to find several mantras topicwise:

\- kill illusions,

\- clean karma

\- increase counsiousness

\- decrease laziness

\- to work more

\- from psychich disorders

\- to have one main aim in life

 I know it might sound childish, but most books on mantra (non-academic) are written so badly, that they are useless at best. Academic are interesting to read, non-academic useless in practical application. Please advise. The topic is vague, but I surely would appreciate some help from friends in India.

  

I bow to your feet,

Marcis from Krasnodar
