Dear Marcis and and other respected scholars,

This topic on Mantra Book is taking good turns and lot of valuable information is being extended by all learned scholars. As a person in the Srividya Tradition I would like to add some more information in this direction.

Mantra Sastra

At the outset is stunning to see the statement that Mantra Sastra is non-academic. Then I am curious to know what is the definition of the word "Academic" and what is "Non-Academic?"

i. If a any stream or branch of knowledge is academic Mantra Sastra with its four padas \_ Charya, Kriya, Yoga and Jnana padas accepted by all scholars as a wonderful branch of knowledge. In Vaishnava tradition these texts are called Samhitas. In Saiva, Ganapatya and Saura traditions these texts are called Agamas. In Sakteya Tradition these are called TANTRAS. Besides these in Buddhism and Jainism also there are Tantras. Besides these there are texts like Yamalas, Damaras, Kalpas etc. in all these traditions to deal with different Purpose oriented Mantras.

ii. If it is the notion that only such streams of knowledge which are in university curriculum can be considered "ACADEMIC" in the Universities like Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati, SVVedic University, Tirupati and in several Vedapathasalas through out the country under the name of AGAMA DEPARTMENT this is in direct curriculum.

iii\. Moreover in the Sakteya Sampradaya this stream of knowledge is called SRIVIDYA. Here the word SRI in the texts like SARADA TILAKA TANTRA is given 54 + meanings and explained as the provider of all those kinds of prosperity to the Sadhaka. At the end the TANTRAS say that SRI means MOKSHA JNANA. As this knowledge helps the Sadhakas in attaining Moksha or salvation this Srividya is Brahma Vidya.

Hence the notion that this NON-ACADEMIC may be reviewed.

2. Types of MANTRAS

There are different categories of Mantras found in the texts on MANTRA SASTRA.

i. Vedic Mantras are known by the names like RKS (Mantras in Rgveda), SAMANS (Mantras in Samaveda), YAJUS (Mantras in Yajurveda) and so on.

ii. Bija Mantras: These mantras are mono-syllabic, di-syllabic, tetra syllabic, deca syllabic, hen-deca syllabic, dodeca-syllabic and so on. The syllables used in these mantras have their own meanings which on has to learn under some GURU. There are many Mantra sastra nighantus to help in this matter.

iii. Malamantras:

These are very lengthy. The number syllables in these Mantras are not important but the entire mantra is considered as a single whole. In these Mantras Some Bijas, the names of the deities, the purpose for which the deities are invoked through this mantra and one of the six Mantra pallavas (Namah, Svasti, Svaha, Svadha, Vashat and Vaushat) are used. According to the Pallava the result will be associated.

iv. Bija-Nama Phrasal Mantras

These are mantras with initial Bijas +names(in Dative/Accusate/Nominative cases with or without any of the above mentioned six Pallavas.

v. Stotra Mantras

These mantras are in the form of Stotras. These Mantras are also equally powerful. The power of the Mantras depend on the composers' power of sadhana.

  

As said by BVK Sastry Garu some of the mantras can newly be formed also. But not by every one. Only by such Sadhakas who have several decades of Sadhana and got perfection.

How these Mantras work?

These mantras should be received by Sadhakas through some Guru-sishya tradition. If merely seen and chosen from any printed texts and started to be recited or chanted those mantras are just equal to reading of any news paper.

The fulfillment of chanting the Mantgras depend on the way it is received from a proper Guru. While imparting the Mantras Gurus through the process called SHAKTIPATA transmits required spiritual strength into the body of the disciple to practice the Mantra in an appropriate manner. This Shakti Pata method itself is a big volume to be discussed.

  

Mantra Sastra is a complex of Yoga, Dhyana, Tapas and the Svara Sastra.

Through the chanting of the mantras which consists of various "BIJAs" (Syllables) the inherent Nadis will be activated supplying required energy to develop various faculties of intellectual abilities enabling the sadhaka to become good at various skills and talents.

Broadly there are two purposes for the Mahamantras:

1\. To attain any and every world object.(Bhoga) 2. To get Moksha(Salvation)

It depends on the option and practice of the Sadhaka to get the either.

There are lot many things to be discussed in this context. But I stop here for the time being.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

Namaste



My observations on : ( Surely new mantra / custom mantras can be formulated provided one knows the Mantra-Yoga method of studying –practicing Samskrutham. Unfortunately the Sanskrit crowd opinion is against this exploration! To expect a historic veda-mantra to give a current healing without ‘ breathing prana-life in to it’ is like expecting falling and touching at the feet of a dead body and expecting the life to be rejuvenated ! 



Coming to specifics in the posts:



On \< Beejaakshara formulations and other such mantra \> + \< Mantras not limited to Veda mantras (discussed by Pujya Aachaarya Korada).
\> + \< understanding the meaning rather than just mechanical recitations without understanding \>



1. \<Amantram aksharam naasti> - Every sound can be converted and used as a ‘ Mantra’ under specific context. What is the limitation ? \< Yojakah tatra durlabhah>. The Mantra debate will not work with the written books and scholarly discussions on whether panchadshi should be fifteen letters and how these fifteen should be counted ?What happens if the order is changed et al.



2. \< Mantra-brahmanayoh veda-naamdheyam> - The original reference and usage of the word ‘ mantra’ is in the context of Veda. Unless one understands and gets clear on mantra in Veda -format and Mantra in local language format, there may not be any possibility of progress here. The remembrance of famous stories of reversed pronunciation of \< Rama as Ma-ra by Valmiki \> and Kanakadasa story \< Kurubanige Kona mantra \>?! Is only to make a pointer on this issue.



3. Works on Tantra provide several mantra –formulations . How does one get on to test these ? Unless one has the basic clarity on sounds and healing energy ? Read the book – Yoga of Sound’ by Russil Paul <http://www.russillpaul.com/yogaofsound.html> .



New Mantras like ‘ Om namah Christaaya namah Shivaaya’ have been created and are floating around in circulation ! There are enough tantric gurus selling mantras on fancy terms and formulations.



4.So much to say on how the great language of ‘Samskrutham’ which cares about the ‘ specificity of one single accent change in Mantra-Chandas-Veda resulting in a disaster as in the story of Indra shatro vardhasva’ has lent itself to mutations and mutilated deliberations.



I wonder What ever happened to the caution provided by Patanjali on the section addressing : Duahstah Shabdah svarato varnato vaa, mithya prayukto na tamartham aaha, sa vaagvajro yajamaanam hinasti, yathendrashatruh, svaratoparaadhaat’ ??
