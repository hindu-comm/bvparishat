Mārcis Gasūns from Krasnodar seems to be focussing on Mantras not limited to Veda mantras (discussed by Pujya Aachaarya Korada).



He seems to be interested in Beejaakshara formulations and other such mantras also.



His words are:



"Good books on bija, nama and suktam mantras?"



He needs apurpose-wise classifed list ofmantras.



Such lists are provided in non-academic books. But he considers them 'useless'



Even among non-academic books there is no comprehensive classified list of all bija, nama and suktam mantras at one place.



'Academic' books explain the theory behind the mantra-concept. There are numerous such books on bija, nama and suktam mantras sometimes separately sometimes together. They usually do notmake purposewise classified lists.



Tantra, Yajna , Japa, PaaraayaNa etc. the practical side of mantra-sadhana are described in non-academic books, but mostly in the local languages of India. From an academic point of view, they are 'badly' written. But 'purpose-oriented', 'effect-oriented' practioners of mantra-sadhana still make use of these books.



Like 'nadi-pariksha' enquired by Mr. Mārcis Gasūns earlier, the practical side of the mantra system has a lot to do with undocumentable, subjective fact oriented practical learning from proper Gurus.



A few 'exotic'-centered traveller oriented English books too covered the 'Left' and the 'Right' side of mantra systems.



Vidvatparishads are helpful only with regard to academic aspects.

Nagaraj
