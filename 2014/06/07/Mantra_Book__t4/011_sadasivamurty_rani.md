Respected Joshi ji!

In the Mantra Sastra there are certain suffixes called Mantra Pallavas. These Mantra Pallavas add certain Saumya are Tikshna powers to the Mantras. They are : Namah, Svasti, Svaha, Svadha, Vashat, Vaushat and Phat.

Of these Pallavas: 'Namah' is Mangala Pallava. One who wants the welfare of the all the worlds through his Mantra adds this "Namah" Pallava at the end of the Mantra using the just presiding deity's name and its adjectives in Dative case.

Svasti is Santi Pallava.

Svaha, Vashat and Vaushat are the Pallavas meant for offering Havis to the Gods.

Svadha is usually employed in Sraddha karma while offering to Pitrdevatas.

Finally Phat is Maraka pratyaya.

When the Sadhaka has any intention to destroy his enemies can add 'Phat' at the end of the mantra in place of Namah and chants to an extent of prescribed number of times for its due results.
