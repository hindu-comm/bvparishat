Dear Scholars,

  

thanks for offering different explanations on the question "are there a list of purposewise/topic wise list of mantras

  

". Are there any authoritative collections of mantras? Good books on bija, nama and suktam mantras"

  

  

As already explained by different scholars like Pof,Korada, and Sadashivamurthy, the word "mantra" itself concluded different types of Mantra's. with different natures and purposes to be served. As the question is too wider in scope to be contained in a book, either in English or Sanskrit, he has collected his question in general as he has gathered from different books by different authors dwelling different aspects and itself shows that it is a difficult task to find all of the types listed and explained in one book.

  

For Bija mantra's goes to the Tantric concept which has got its own literature of Mantra's according to the purpose explained in different tasks. Vedic Mantra's are listed under Sukta and Adhyaya on one side, and Ashtaka and Varka, Mandala in another caterorised and which are used in different contexts, as explained in Rigvidhana of Shaunaka for Rigveda. There are Anukramani's also catagorywise listing. But this may not be available for all the Samhita's. But the commentators cited the Brahmana texts relevant to the Mantra's. explaining the purpose of the Mantra used.

  

Now coming Namamantra it is new. "Om namo narayanaya" is also a mantra, rama rama also could be also a mnatra. This category goes, I am not sure, what he meant by this category. Ashtakshara, pancakshara, dashakshara mantra-s. or any name used as mantra, in japa. Yoga has Tasya vacakah pranavah, tajjapastadarthabhavanam, referes to the mono syllaic oM called praNava, as denoting Isvara.

  

Sukta, has got a topic, common for all or a group of mantra's in sUkta with purposes or Viniyoga, in Vedic Texts. Pauranika sUkta's are different from Vedic Sukta's and have got a different field of literature.

  

So widely diverse question and it is difficult to give a simple answer to his question unless the question is analysed and unless there is already one book as he expects, like the question of Nadee Pareeksha.

  

This is my simple observation.
