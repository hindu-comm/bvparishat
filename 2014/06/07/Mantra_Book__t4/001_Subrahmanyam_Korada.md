नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Vidvan Marcis from Krasnodar --

  

Are there any authoritative collections of mantras? Good books on bija, nama and suktam mantras? What if I need to find several mantras topicwise:

\- kill illusions,

\- clean karma

\- increase counsiousness

\- decrease laziness

\- to work more

\- from psychich disorders

\- to have one main aim in life     ------

  

**ऋग्वेदः - यजुर्वेदः (कृष्ण/शुक्ल) - सामवेदः- अथर्ववेदः - वेदभाष्यभूमिकासंग्रहः(सायणाचार्यः)- पूर्वमीमांसासूत्रम् - तन्त्रवार्तिकम् - आर्षविज्ञानसर्वस्वम् (तेलुगु)- सस्वरवेदमन्त्रालु(तेलुगु) --**

  

The derivative meaning of the term Mantra is - the one which protects if recited with meditation (मननात् त्रायते इति मन्त्रः)।

  

After a lot of discussion both Kumarila and Sayana have decided that whichever is taught as Mantra by the Guru is Mantra (and the rest is Brahmanam).

  

The guideline is that only a Yajnopaviitii (having the sacred thread called upaviitam) is eligible to recite Veda (Mantras) -- यज्ञोपवीत्येवाधीयीत (तैत्तिरीयारण्यकम् -2). Others can have the result by recitation thru a good Vedic Scholar , ie one who is trained in Gurukula and knows the norms of recitation.

  

Books --

  

1.'Sasvaavedamantralu ' is a book in Telugu by Ramakrishnamatham,2002, wherein some useful Mantras, Santimantras , Suktas and Matrapushpam
from different Vedas are given with meaning and gist. I do not know whether such a book is available in other languages or not -

[publi...@rkmath.org]() ; [www.rkmath.org](http://www.rkmath.org)

  

2\. 'Aarshavijnaanasarvasvam' was published in Telugu by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams , Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh(Second Edition 2003) and it gives a panorama of diffeerent Manras and Suktas from all Vedas . I do not know whether an English version is brought out or not .

  

Here are some references from Vedas --

  

Rgveda --

  

1.Jivatma - Paramatma (द्वा सुपर्णा) - Rgveda- 1-164-20

  

2.Atmatattvam - ,, 1-164-39

  

3.Work -duty -wealth-health-good spech -- ,, 2-12-6

  

4\. Brhaspati for good behavior -jnanam etc -- ,, 2-23 -4,5,6,7

  

5.Unity in thought /mind/ friendship etc. -- ,, 10-191-4 (last Rk)

  

Suklayajurveda --

  

1\. Suklayajussamhita - Chapter 18 Mantrakandikas 27 - one can expect from a Yajna --

  

chance to serve food to others , dexterity in using
Jnana-karmendriyasfor a good cause, capacity to raise children , hygene , dhynam, good mind, ojas(cause of strength ) , health, longevity etc.

  

2.A single goal - to know Paramatma - Isavasyopanisat - Chapter 40

  

Samaveda --

  

1.Somarasa provides strength and happiness -- Puurvaarci 5-1-1 to 3.6.8

  

2.Ushodevy to give all kinds of wealth -- Uttaraarci 19-1-3

  

Atharvaveda --

  

1.To prevail in a Sabhaa - 'vidma te sakhe naama ' - 7-12-2

  

2.To confuse enemy - agnirnah satruun - 3-1

  

3.To get s goof wife - aagaccchata aagatasya naama - 6-82

  

4.To get good husband - dhaataa daadhaara prthiviim -- 6-60

  

5.To get rid of heart problems- anusuuryamudayataam - 1-5-22

  

  

Medhasuuktam -- Taittiriiyaaranyakam - 4-10-41 to 44

  

Naasadiiyasuuktam Rgveda 10-8-120

  

Purusasuuktam - Rgveda 10-8-90 (in all Vedas it is there)

  

Bhuumisuuktam - Atharvaveda - 12-1

  

There are many Mantras and Suuktas that are difficult to list .

  

It is better to sit down with a traditional scholar who is well versed
in Veda , Vedangas and bothe Miimaamsas to have the meaning of Mantras.
