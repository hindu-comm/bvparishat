Respected scholars,

This is in continuation to my previous posting. Here I intend to present a list of some important works that consists of mantras for different purposes.

Vedic Hymns and results:

Even in the Vedic hymns certain hymns have certain ends to be attained with:

1. Saammanaysa Sukta if recited with devotion for forty days to an extent of prescribed number of times as per the procedure recommended in the Kalpa Texts the separated wife and husband will unite together and great love will develop between them.

2. Aruna Paatha recitation will help in curing Vitiligo if recited for a prescribed number of times during prescribed number of times.

3. Similarly there are many Vedic mantras associated with proved ends.

Whether they belong to Vaishnava cult or Shaiva Cult or Shakta cult or to other cults such as Gaanaapatya or Kaumaara or Saura - All the higher texts of these six schools recommend the salvation as the highest target of SADHAKAS.

Prapancha Sara Tantra, Srividya Ratnakara, Sarada Tilaka Tantra, Tantraloka of Abhinva Gupta, Yogini Tantra, Yogini Hrdaya, Kamakala Vilasa, Mahamantrarnava, Vijnana Bhairava, Uddisha Tantra, Kamakhya Tantra, Bhutadamara Tantra, Rudra Yamala and Ravana Tantra are some of the popular higher class texts which promote salvation as the highest target of the sadhakas. These texts at the same time give many mantras for attaining the lower or worldly ends too.

Still there are certain lower texts in all these schools to fulfill the worldly needs of the devotees of lower stature.

Siddha Nagarjuna Mahatantra, ratyanigra Tantra, Dekalottaragama, Phetkarini Tantra, Vandhya Tantra, Vina Shikha Tantra, Jnana Sankalini Tantra, Damara Tantra,Amnaya Mandara etc., are some of the texts of this kind.

As far as the stotra mantras are related: Sri Lalita Sahasra Nama Stotra, Durga Sapta Sati and Saundarya lahari, Brhat Stotra Ratankara in three parts consisting of Vishnu Stotras, Siva Stotras and Shakti Stotras are the most important ones where there are thousands of stotras yielding all kinds of fruits.

Interestingly in the South Indian Panchangams of Andhra Pradesh Gupta Panchanga is popularly known for hundreds of Mantras that help in attaining different kinds of ends through reciting them.

But one thing is sure. Any mantra can be chanted having been properly instructed by some Guru (Preceptor). If any having just seen in some printed book and start chanting it it won't give any fruit.

With warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
