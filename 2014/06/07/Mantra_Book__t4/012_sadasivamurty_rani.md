Respected Joshi ji!

Sorry...while I was still adding some information accidentally my mail has been posted due to touching an undue key in my key board.

  

In the Mantra Sastra there are certain suffixes called Mantra Pallavas. These Mantra Pallavas add certain Saumya are Tikshna powers to the Mantras. They are : Namah, Svasti, Svaha, Svadha, Vashat, Vaushat and Phat.

Of these Pallavas: 'Namah' is Mangala Pallava. One who wants the welfare of the all the worlds through his Mantra adds this "Namah" Pallava at the end of the Mantra using the just presiding deity's name and its adjectives in Dative case.

Svastiis Santi Pallava.

Svaha, Vashat and Vaushatare the Pallavas meant for offering Havis to the Gods.

Svadha is usually employed in Sraddha karma while offering to Pitrdevatas.

FinallyPhatis Maraka pratyaya.

When the Sadhaka has any intention to destroy his enemies can add 'Phat' at the end of the mantra in place of Namah and chants to an extent of prescribed number of times for its due results.

In the context of Satyanarayana Vrata the Vashat prayoga is done as a part of Anganyasa and Karanyasa process. PHAT is used for DIGBANDHA to prevent the unwanted intrusion of Evil forces (Bhutocchhatana). Sadhaka here uses Phat to drive away or destroy all the evil forces from the Vrata spot.

These prayogas are commonly used in all vratas and japa sadhanas having been associated with Anganyasa, Karanyasa and Digbandhana.

  

Now Regardingthe Phalashruti of Ganapati Atharva sheers’a, it is recited, “Sooryagrahe mahaanadyaam pratimaa sannidhau vaa japtvaa sidhamantro bhavati”.

Not only in case of Ganapati Atharva Sheers'a it is a common recommendation in case of all Mantras of Mantra Sastra to follow this procedure of chanting them on SOME special occasions :

1\. On the occasion of Surya Grahana (Solar Eclipse) and Candra Grahana (Lunar Eclipse) sitting on the banks of Great rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna etc., (While the Eclipse is in progress) or sitting in front of the Idol of the God or Goddess at home (at the time of Eclipse) one can chant the Mantra as many number of times as possible through out the Eclipse span.

2\. On the occasion of Mahapurascharana Vidhi also one can recite the Mantras to a prescribed number of times in a prescribed format.

Such japa fetches fulfillment to the Sadhaka when it is supplemented by Homa, Tarpana, Brahmana Bhoja etc. as prescribed in the Tantras.

Warm Regards,
