In the System of Ayurvedic medicine Anupana Dravyas (mediums) have different purposes on different occasions. They are not just for increasing palatability or for the removal of the after-taste. This statement is made not to deny other scholars views but to introduce certain interesting aspects of Ayurveda. I request the scholars not to misunderstand me.

  

Always the Anupana Dravyas (mediums) in Ayurveda play a very important role which is equal to that of the main medicines of any particular course of treatment.

Anupanas have many miraculous effects.

1. The same medicine if anupana is changed works in a different way.

2. Certain medicines in the absence of their prescribed Anupanams will not work at all.

For instance: a particular medicine if taken with hot water cures cough with phlegm. The same medicine if taken with milk cures dry cough. Here the hot water and milk are not just mediums added to increase palatability.

3. Certain anupanas make even severely poisonous medicines very much tamed and soft.

As a person hailed from a family known for its scholarship in Ayurveda through 12 generations I have witnessed thousands of instances where anupana plays an equal role with the main medicine.

  

About the Honey, Its types and curative powers:

Honey depending on its source of production, regions of its availability and the flowers from which it is collected has different natures, functions and effects.

a) According to the humors Honey is of three kinds: Honey with Pitta Humor, Honey with Sleshma Humor and Honey with Vata Humor too.

b) Depending on its regions of its availability also it has different natures:

 i) The honey that is available from Kashmir and Kanyakumari (in our experience) is sleshma pradhana. It is laghu by nature and helps in curing many paitya and vata dosha pradhana ailments.

ii) The honey from West Bengal is of mixed nature of Sleshma and Paitya. The nearer its source to Sea shore the higher will be the Paitya Pradhanya in it.

iii) The honey from Madhya Pradesh is curative of Vata dosha ailments.

iv) The honey from the river side flowery gardens is more virtuous that that from the forests. Similarly the honey from hill areas preferably near the hill-stream side grooves of trees is more qualitative than that from the forests.

  

v\) Similarly the Honey from the Lotus flowers is the best one of all honeys with high curative efficacy. It can cure even all kinds of Netra doshas.

  

Here is an account of different categories of Honey and their uses:

माक्षिकं पौत्तिकं क्षौद्रं भ्रामरं मधुविस्तरात्।

माक्षिकं तैलसकाशं पौत्तिकं घृतसन्निभम्॥

क्षौद्रं कपिलवर्णं स्यात् भ्रामरं स्फटिकोपम़म्॥

There are four types of Honey when broadly classified:

1\. Makshika 2. Pauttika 3. kshaudra and 4. Bhraamara

Of these four types : Makshika resembles oil in appearance.

Pauttika is like Ghee.

kshaudra is tawny in color.

Bhramara is as transparent and white as Crystal.

माक्षिकं मधुषु श्रेष्ठं नेत्रामयहरं लघु।

पौत्तिकं मधुरूक्षोष्णं पित्तदाहास्रवातकृत्॥

क्षौद्रं माक्षिकमप्येव विशेषान्मेहनाशनम्।

भ्रामरं रक्तपित्तघ्नं मूत्रजाड्यकरं गुरु॥

Of these four types of Honey Makshika is the best one. It is curative of some kinds of eye diseases (even at chronic stage). It is Laghu by nature.

Pauttika Honey is Ruksha, Ushna tattva pradhana and causes Overheat, Thirsty feeling, aggravates Vata Dosha ailments and so on.

Kshaudra Honey has many qualities of Makshika honey and it even helps in curing Madhu Meha (Diabetes).

Bhraamara Honey is curative of Raktapitta Dosha. But it prevents free flow of Urine. It is Guru by nature.

Unfortunately in the modern times we are not testing all these things while using Honey and just go for Branded honeys like: Dabur Honey or Lion Honey and so on. Instead we should try to get honey from Srikrishna Pharmacy, Amrtasar specifying which type of honey we need following the recommendation of Ayurvedic experts.

Can we use boiled or heated honey?

त्याज्यं मधु

विषादिदुष्टपुष्पेभ्य: सविषामाक्षिकादय:।

मधुचिन्वन्ति तस्मात्तत्स्वभावात्सविषं स्मृतम्॥

तस्मादग्न्यातपात्तप्तं तद्भुक्तं हन्ति मानवम्।

उष्णे काले च देशे च द्रव्यैरुष्णैश्च योजितम्।

निरूहे छर्दने तज्ज्ञैस्तदुक्तं न निवार्यते॥

If honey collected by the bees from the poisonous flowers such as Dhattura and others it should not be used. It is also poisonous and harmful to us.

Similarly the honey kept for a long time under the hot Sun or boiled honey or heated honey should not be used as such honey kills the persons.

Usually Honey should not be consumed during Grishma season and also in hot countries particularly with hot dravyas. But they are also recommended on certain occasions such as Chardana Kriya (Vomiting acitivity) and so on for wait loss and other purposes. But it should be done under the constant supervision of Doctors.

This is just a general introduction to the Nature, types and curative efficacies of Honey. To learn more about Honey and other Anupanas there are many other Best Ayurvedic Experts in our Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat and out side also.
