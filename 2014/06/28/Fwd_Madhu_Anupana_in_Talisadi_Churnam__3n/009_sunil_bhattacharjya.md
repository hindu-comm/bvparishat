Thank you Dr. Murtyji for the very good elaborations. As regards the honey, which cures diabetes, it is claimed that honey bees collected that from the jambhul trees, which probably grow in abundance there and it is also known that the jambhul fruit is good for the diabetics. You view aout the river Krishna is also correct as it is said to have originated from Mahabaleshwar.
