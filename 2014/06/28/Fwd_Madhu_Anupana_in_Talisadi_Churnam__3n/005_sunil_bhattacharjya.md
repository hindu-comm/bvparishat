Dear friends,  
  

In this particular case honey is used as "an Anupana' to the Churna probably for increasing its palatability and removal of the after-taste as well as for the convenience of administration, so that inconvenience of taking the drug in the powder form is taken care of. For that hardly a drop of honey may be required. I am not an Ayurvedic doctor but I remember that one Ayurvedic doctor was telling me that the quantity of honey used should be minimal (probably because it is also an usna item), Your feed-back will be appreciated.  
  

Thanks,  

Sunil KB
