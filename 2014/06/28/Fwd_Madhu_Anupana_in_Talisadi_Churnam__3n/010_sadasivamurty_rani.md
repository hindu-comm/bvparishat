Sunil Ji!

Namaste!

Thanks for the information about the Honey from the Mahabaleswar. Yes the reason stated by you is true. From the flowers of which ever tree the honey is collected it consists of the curative effects of that tree.

As the honey of this area is collected from jambu trees it obviously has such effects.

Some more facts about Honey I would like to add in this context:

1\. Even in case of severe burns if honey is applied it cures fast the burns without leaving even the mark of burns. First application of honey in place of burns should be done with 5 to 20 minutes of the occurrence of burning with out washing the burns with water. It not only helps in curing the burns it doesn't allow the formation of bubbles of the skin in the burnt area. It protects the melanin also.

2\. If the lotus honey is used thrice a day for forty days even after 40s (age) there won't be any need of power glasses. It assuredly gives us better vision.

3. Honey and Ghee

While mixing honey and ghee there is a particular order.

If honey is mixed in ghee (in equal quantities) it works like Amrta. If ghee is mixed in honey (in equal quantities) it becomes poisonous. (घृते मधूप्तं पीयूषं मधुनाज्यं विषं यथा॥ ब्रह्मसिद्धान्ते प्रथमाध्याये ९० शोल्.) So while preparing Panchamrtams it is recommended to mix honey in ghee and not vice versa.

4. The test for Honey

Even if honey is filtered through a cloth for hundred times and seen after a day every time there will be a formation of pollen layer on its surface. This is the only traditional test for honey.

5. Old Honey

Honey, sugar and Jaggery (Gudam) preserved for more than one year are considered old.

There are many more interesting facts about honey which can be known from Ayurvedic texts.

With warm regards,
