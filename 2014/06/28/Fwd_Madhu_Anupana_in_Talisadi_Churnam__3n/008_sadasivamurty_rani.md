Respected Sunil Ji!

Talisadi Curna is curative of different types of coughs, TB, Asthma, haemoptysis, epilepsy and such other diseases.

It is one of the set of medicines prescribed for curing such diseases.

Any powders used for curing cough are generally mixed with honey as honey also curative of coughs.

All Ushnatattva pradhana curnas are suggested for curing phlegm based cough. In such case Pautta Honey can be used as this also is Ushna tattva pradhana.

So in Talisadi Curna Pautta Honey can be used.

If the cough is dry cough without phlegm other kinds of honey also can be used.

I don't have the knowledge of the honey of the Mahabaleswar of Maharashtra. But I can guess that it must be a virtuous one as its from the source place of one of the great rivers of country - River Krishna. It must have been surrounded by Hill areas with sweet water streams. So the honey of that are also curative of many diseases and as it was stated in your posting it can be a curative of Diabetes.

Warm Regards,



**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
