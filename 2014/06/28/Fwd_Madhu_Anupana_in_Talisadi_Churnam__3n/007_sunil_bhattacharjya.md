Dear Dr, Raniji,  
  
Thank you for the detailed mail. The original question was why honey, despite being an ushna anupana, is being recommended for the ushna churna. As Pauttika Honey is Ruksha, Ushna tattva pradhana and causes Overheat, which honey, according to you will be suitable for the Talasadi churna.  
  

Secondly are you aware of the different types of honey available in Mahabaleashwar in Maharashtra and one of them reportedly cures Diabetes,  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
