Dear Members of the Sanskrit world,

  

It is with profound grief that I have to inform you all of the sudden demise of Dr.Kalpakam Sankaranarayan, Director of Buddhist Studies ,K.J.Somaiya Centre for Buddhist Studies, Mumbai. She was not well for some weeks and was shifted to Bangalore where her end came on Monday the 16th June 2014. Her contribution to Buddhist Studies is immense and she will be remembered for her tireless dedication to the development of the Centre and for the several Buddhist Conferences held.

  

She is survived by her daughter, son-in-law and grand daughter.
