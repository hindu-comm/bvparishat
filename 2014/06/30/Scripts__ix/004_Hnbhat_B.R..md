Here is the information.

  

Nepal Bhasa (नेपाल भाषा / Newah Bhaye / Newari), a member of the Tibeto-Burman group of Sino-Tibetan languages spoken in Nepal, India, especially in Sikkim and West Bengal, and Bhutan by about 800,000 people.

  

As well as the Ranjana script, Nepal Bhasa has been written with the Brahmi, Gupta, Prachalit, Bhujimol and Devanagari script.

  

  

The above scripts are used in addition to Ranjana. Please specify the script used for the Newari you are requesting. Ranjana and Bhujmoli are the two used for writing Sanskrit texts of Newari scripts. Please be specific on your demand than flatly requesting for Newari script.
