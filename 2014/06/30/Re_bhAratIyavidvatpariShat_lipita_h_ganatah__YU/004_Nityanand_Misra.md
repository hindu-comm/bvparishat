Prof. Deshpande Ji  
  
A downloadable edition is not available yet. The scan of the typed manuscript - replete with scribal and typing errors - is available. I would not recommend it to anybody as it is almost impossible to read.  
  
You may read the Unicode version of the first edition online under this link -  
  
<http://jagadgururambhadracharya.org/works/arapv/contents.php>  
  
However, this also has many editorial mistakes - due to lack of time, I could not do a perfect job. I am currently working on the second edition where I have corrected many of those mistakes and also given derivations  
  
I am attaching a draft of the second edition for your perusal, and recommend this for reading. If you come across any mistakes in the draft, please let me know and I will correct them.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
