Dravya Guna Sastra is a special branch of Ayurveda which very interestingly makes an analytical keen study of the properties of all the Dravyas. It is well known that the Ayurveda Nighantus make a classification of all the Dravyas into various groups such as : Haritakyadi Varga, Kapuradi Varga, Guducyadi Varga, Pushpa Varga, Phala Varga, Vatadi Varga, Dhatu Varga, Dhanya Varga, Shaka Varga, Vari Varga, Dughda Varga, Dadhi Varga, Takra Varga, Navanita Varga, Ghrta Varga, Mutra Varga, Taila Varga, Ikshu Varga and so on.

  

Drayas of any and every one of these classes have five types of peculiar ATTRIBUTES: RASA, GUNA, VIRYA, VIPAKA and PRABHAVA.

Before going into the details it is essential to know some fundamental principles:

1\. NO TWO DRAVYAS HAVE THE SAME ATTRIBUTES IN THE SAME PROPORTIONS.

  

2\. THE SAME DRAVYA AT DIFFERENT STAGES HAVE THE SAME ATTRIBUTES.

Now the details of the general categories of these FIVE ATTRIBUTESare given here.

1\. RASA (TASTES) (6) - Madhura, Amla, Lavana, Katu, Tikta and Kashaya

2\. GUNAS (LATENT VIRTUES) - (20) - Guru, Manda, Hima, Snigdha, Slakshna, Sandra, Mrdu, Sthira, Sukshma and Vishada are TEN in number and their opposite natures are again TEN. So the total number of GUNAS are TWENTY (20).

3\. VIRYA (MEDICINAL POTENCY) - (2) - Shita Virya and Ushna Virya

4\. VIPAKA (THE TASTE THAT ARISES AFTER THE DIGESTION AND METABOLISM OF A SUBSTANCE) - (3) - Madhura, Amla and Katu

5\. PRBHAVA (INHERENT AND UNSEEN CURATIVE POWER) - This manifold.

Now coming to the question in the context Sunthi and Ardraka are the two products of the same source. When it is dried it is called Sunthi and when it is freshly collected from the plant in a moist state it is called Ardraka. Because of the difference in their state there is difference in their attributes too.

For instance -

1\. The Attributes of a well ripen Mango or Kapittha fruit are different from those of unripe or still riping Mango or Kapittha. 

2\. The Attributes of New Tamarind are different from those of Long Stored Tamarind. New Tamarind because of its attribute-variation cause body pains and dysentery where as Long stored Tamarind helps in removing pains and curing dysentery.

3\. The Attributes of Curd at different stages vary from one another. The curd is categorized into FIVE TYPES depending on state of its formation. All these five types of Curd don't have the same Attributes.

4\. The Attributes of Milk which is the source of Curd are different from the Attributes of Curd.

These observations are applicable in case of the Differences in the Attributes of Sunthi and Ardraka also.

One more reason can be added here as found in the Ayurvedic Texts such as Ashtanga Hrdaya:

जाठरेणाग्निना योगाद्यदेति रसान्तरम्।

रसानां परिणामान्ते सविपाक इति स्मृत:॥

त्रिधा विपाको द्रव्यस्य स्वाद्वम्लकटुकात्मक:।

स्वादु: पटुश्च् मधुरमम्लोऽम्लं पच्यते रस:।

तिक्तोषणकषायाणां विपाक: प्रायश: कटु:.॥

The food of six different tastes that we eat turns into three tastes after the digestion and metabolism. This process is called VIPAKA.
Those three final VIPAKA tastes are: Sweet, Sour and Pungent.

The Vipaka of any Sweet substance usually remains Sweet only.

The Vipaka of Sour Substances also usually remains Sour only.

But the Vipaka of Pungent, Bitter and Astringent substance usually
turns into Pungent. This is the general principle.

The striking difference in the general state of Sunthi and Ardraka is well known to all of us. So the causes for the differences i their Guna, Vipaka and other Attributes too can be understood.

For more details the Ayurvedic Texts like Charaka, Sushruta, Vagbhata, Rajanighantu, Bhavaprakasa, Dhanvantari Nighantu etc., can be referred.
