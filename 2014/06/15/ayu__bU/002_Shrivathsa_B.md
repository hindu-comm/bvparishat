hariH OM,  
  

 many a time in Ayurveda (as in any science), it is easy to state the "what" than to explain "how". If the question "how" in your post means "how, inspite of being the same material, they behave differently?" then many such examples (as given by Dr. RSM) can be given (curd and buttermilk come first to mind).  
  

 if the question was "how" in the sense of biological / metabolic etc. mechanisms, many a time such studies are not available. Studying the mechanisms may shed more light on many areas of science.  
  

svasti,  

    JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

                           shrivathsa.
