Namaste,

  

 I was reading about bija mantras and found out<http://visiblemantra.blogspot.ru/2011/12/pronouncing-anusvara.html> - the discussion is not a new one, in the group as well, still of great interest for me. I'm not sure ifoscillograph has ever been used for Sanskrit or for recording different styles of mantra pronunciation,

  

Truly,

M.G.
