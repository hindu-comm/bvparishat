Dear Joshi,

  

If you believe in Jyotish, you can believe in the Dosha's pointed by the Astrologers and the method prescribed for removing the Dosha's mentioned by themselves or ritualists to remove them.

  

How know any example of Kumbha marriage removed the DOS'a from the life of a lady? All the removal and framing of dosha-s, are not visible for the believers and followers of the rites etc. and how can it be justified by pure logical reasoning also?

Yes. It is not easy forr you to tell that where as it is a fact she is married twice, without having its effect of marrying twice, logically, even if you believe it or not. The believers believe this as assumed by the astrolgers.
