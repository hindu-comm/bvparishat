सर्वेभ्यो नमः \|\|

Yes, I have saw this when i was in primary school level, but till date, I do not know how and why this **Ashwatthopanayana** Samskaara is.

I think (hope !), still in Karnataka, especially in North Kenara (UTTARA KANNADA) district, it is there..

I am really grateful all those learned scholars who interacted for this topic.
