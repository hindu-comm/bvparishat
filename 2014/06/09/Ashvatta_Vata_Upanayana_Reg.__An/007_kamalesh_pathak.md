dr. raghavendra ji , namaste,

i am from gujarat somanath a traditional pandit engaged with karma kanda.

i have seen three four ashvattha tree with JANOI (secred thread) and people offer water to their late ancestors through this tree agter shraadhdha,, reason is not known to me.

2nd thing i noticed. when there is some dosha in a female kundali some astrologers prefer Arka vivaah or others prefer Kumbha vivaah, both the vivaahas are performed with such ashvattha tree who is having secred thread.

it is believed that this tree is form of lord krishna - reference of gitaji vedanam samavedoham etc.

more details may hidden with puranas

more if i came to know will mail you,

regards,

kamalesh pathak
