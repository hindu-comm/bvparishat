You probably mean Peepal (Ficus Religiosa)



Thread is tied in circlesaround the trunk of As'vattha, Peepal (Ficus Religiosa)tree. This is usually part of 'marriage' of As'vattha, Peepal (Ficus Religiosa)tree with Neem (Azadirachta Indica) tree.



It is really interesting that there is an Upanayanam ofAs'vattha, Peepal (Ficus Religiosa)tree also. A more detailed ethnography of the practicewill certainly be interesting given the significance of As'vattha, Peepal (Ficus Religiosa)tree in the Vedic /Sanskritic tradition.



Other scholars may add info about the prevalence of the ritual in their locality.



Regards,



Nagaraj
