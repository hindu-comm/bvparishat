Namaste,

  

Scholars are requested to read Pippala instead of Vata..

(Namaste,

I saw some Ashvatta (Vata) Upanayana samskaaras in my native place(South India)(Do not know about other places in India)

I sincerely want know about this in detail and also want to know why specially this kind of Samskaaras for Vata Vrikshaas?  

I am herewith requesting scholars to enlighten me in this regard.)

  

Thank you
