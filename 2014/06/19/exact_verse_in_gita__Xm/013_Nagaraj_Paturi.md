Scholarsrealated toSanskrit and people from other streams, who have a habit of reading gItA, will certainlyhave their own favorite quotes from the divine book.  

  

Can others in the forumcome up with their lists too, so thatthe oft-repeated and inspiredquotes be picked, and prepared as a list of "true gItA sAra".  

  

There is another list of 54 verses prepared by one DR TS Ramakrishna by name Sankshipta Gita. Sharing it. The script for verses is in Telugu. But the numbers of verses in Roman can be used get to the verses.
