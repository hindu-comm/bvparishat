"All the phylosophical ideas could be traced in one or other way, to Gita, which is a practical guide to life and goal of life discussed.



But the sayings like the one quoted, need not be dugged up into Gita ror original lines or paraphrases as the questioner and the contributors to this thread expressively want to popularise the importance of Gita."



I. All the phylosophical ideas could be traced in one or other way, to Gita ????



Interesting.



II\. which is a practical guide to life and goal of life discussed ----- ???? (grammar?)



III\. Connecting the two clauses



But the sayings like the one quoted, need not be dugged up into Gita ror original lines or paraphrases



and



the questioner and the contributors to this thread expressively want to popularise the importance of Gita.



through 'as' is beyond my comprehension.





Does it mean " The questioner and the contributors to the thread want to popularize the (importance of?) Gita by tracing the quotes like the one brought to discussion by the thread initiator to the Gita. That is not correct. Such quotes need not be taken so seriously as to be traced to the Gita. TheGita does not need to be popularized through such 'not to be taken seriously' kind of quotes."?



1\. All the previous contributors to the thread did not agree with each other. So a common motivecan not be attributed to all of them.



2.Attributing motives to the questioner is not a healthy practice. If something is passing for the purport of the Gita ,it is reasonable to verify whether such a passing is valid/ tenable or not.



3\. Dr. HN Bhat quoted one contributor, that is me. So his response seems to be directed against my contribution.



4\. I did not want to popularize the Gita through the text of which the questioner's quote is apart. I was saying that the creator of the text might have wanted to spread what that person comprehended as the 'purport' of the Gita in a simple, popular style. The text does not claim to be a paraphrase of a few selected verses of the Gita. So there is no point in tracing the verse of which the quotes are paraphrases. Whether the 'purport'- maker is right in his comprehension and expression or not can be scrutinized by the scholars of the Gita. If scholars find that the textpassing for the purport of the Gita is not justified in passing that way they canput their foot down and stop the 'harm' being done to the Gita through such texts. This is what I wanted to communicate through my response.



5\. I do not know the creator of the text of the questioner's quote is a part nor am I a part of a campaign of popularizing the Gita through such texts.



6\. Shivosha Vyasanji came up with a constructive suggestion matching with the scholarly profile of this forum. V. Subrahmanianji agreed with him. Seconded him. I agree with both of them. I second the proposal of SHivosha Vyasanji.
