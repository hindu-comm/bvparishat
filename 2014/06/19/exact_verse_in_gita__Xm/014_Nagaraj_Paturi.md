( I heard about one prepared by Ramana Maharshi with 50 quotes, could not get it..)



I responded as:

  

I found one on the internet that mentions '42' as the selected number of verses by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. That is found on many sites. All the ones I saw have only the English translation.

  

I just now found a pdf which is called Bhagavad Gita Saram and is mentioned to be by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. But the text and the 42 quotes listed in it are in Tamil.

  

Sharing it.
