Shivosha Vyasanji said:



( I heard about one prepared by Ramana Maharshi with 50 quotes, could not get it..)



I found one on the internet that mentions '42' as the selected number of verses by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. That is found on many sites. All the ones I saw have only the English translation.



Enclosing the pdf of one of them.

  

  

There are other 'selected verses for summary' lists too.

  

I shall share them too.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
