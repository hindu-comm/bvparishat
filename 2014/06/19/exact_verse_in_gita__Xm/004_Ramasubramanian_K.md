In my understanding there are many such statements floating around for  
which we may not find exact equivalents in the Gita text. These statements  
are to be considered as paraphrased ones. These so called paraphrases can  
can at times be thoroughly misleading too, as Adi Shankara himself  
observes in his opening remarks:  
  
\`atyantaviruddhaarthatvena laukikairgrihayamaanamupalabhya aham vivekato  
arthanirdhaaranaartham samkshepato vivaranam karishyami'  
  
The saying that is quoted by you, though not misleading, could perhaps be  
considered as a corollary to the opening statement of Sri Krishna to  
Arjuna in the II Chapter  
  
\`ashocyaananvashocastvam' (you have been worrying about something that is  
not worth worrying).  
  
Hope this may be of some use to you.  
  
best regards,  
-ram.
