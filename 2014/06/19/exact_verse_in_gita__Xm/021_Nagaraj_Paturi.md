There is an extremely popular audio recording of Bhagavadgita musically rendered with s'loka and Telugu taatparya recitation by the legendary Sri Ghantasala.

  

This uses selected 100 verses from the Geetaa.

  

There are many websites dealing with this audio and its textual version.

  

I am sharing the s'loka part of the textual version picked up from one of the websites.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
