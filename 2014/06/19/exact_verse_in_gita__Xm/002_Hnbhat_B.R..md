I don't think it is from any gita verse.

  

I found the complete saying, I very often heard quoted by the Tamil Actor Rajnikanth frequently:

  

Ethu nadanthatho athu nanraga nadanthathu Ethu nadakiratho athu nanragave nadakirathu Ethu nadaka irukiratho athuvum Nandragave nadakkum  

  

  

  

What has happened, has happened for good. What is happening, (at present), that also for good. And what is going to happen, will be for good.

  
The above is the literal translation. I can't think any line of Gita, having the same or similar idea.
