Namaste!

  

There are Gita Saras in Agni Purana & Garuda Purana. Similar Gita Saras might be there in other Puranas too. Gita Sara from Agni Purana has 58 verses and the same from Garuda Purana has only 12 verses. Unicode texts of these 2 Gita Saras are attached to this mail.

  

While it is necessary to make a comparative study of all the existing Gita Saras which are mostly in Sanskrit verse, for preparing a new Gita Sara, it should also be in a language that is easily understood by common man.

shankara
