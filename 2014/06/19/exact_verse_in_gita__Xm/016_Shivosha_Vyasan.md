Thankyou Shri Paturi, for all the PDFs. I will go through them and prepare that list.

Iflearned scholars in the forumcame up with other such sources, or their own lists, I would like to compile the gIta sAra myself based on most quoted ones and give it here. We can decide the number of quotes. But publishing apamphlet or leafletis an issue. If Samskrita bharati or someone can take it up-the work will see light.

Members are requested to contribute atleast one or two or five or ten quotes which they like the most out of gItA.Please give Sloka number if whole verse cannot be typed.

Let us have a meaningful, REAL gItA sAra that would inspire very home, every work place, every temple.. where the non-authentic and"so-called gItAsAra" has been enjoying an undue position creating confusion. The mahat-gItAmRta-dugdhaM reach every heart and soul that cherishher in her true spirit.

-regards, Shivosha
