This 'Bhagavdgita's message in brief' text is found in its Hindi and Telugu forms in Hyderabad also.



There should be a text created in one of the Indian languages that is getting translated into various other Indian languages.



The intention of the creator of the original text might be good only. The original creator might have wanted to create a 'simplified' version of the profound work.



The scholars might want to see if the texthas any part that is in conflict/contradiction with the Gita's message.



As long as there is no contradiction that can be looked at as a harmless popularization through simplification.



Regards,



Nagaraj
