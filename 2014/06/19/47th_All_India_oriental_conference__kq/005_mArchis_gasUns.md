Thanks, sure I saw the PDFs but nothing understood. Last time I visited AIOC was in 2004 and everything was done on place.

Should I scan and send? Should I send just by snail mail? How do I pay from Russia? I can make a wire payment, I was planning

to attend this conference long time ago, but nothing is clear from these PDFs.
