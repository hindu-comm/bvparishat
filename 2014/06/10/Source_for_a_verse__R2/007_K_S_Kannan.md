Dear Sri Deshpande,

  

Yet another reference :

P.14 of the book

Panditaraja Jagannatha

(authored by P. Sri Ramachandrudu,

pub: New Delhi, Sahitya Akademi)

states that

the verse is quoted in the introduction to

Siddhanta-les'a-san'graha

published from Kumbhakonam.

  

You may pursue if interested.

  

Regards

Kannan
