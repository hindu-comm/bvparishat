Dear Dr. Kannan,

  

  Thanks for providing the scans of these two pages. It is now clear that the idea that this verse "dṛpyad-drāviḍa..." comes from Nāgeśabhaṭṭa's commentary on the Kāvyaprakāśa goes back to Gopalachariar's statement. Gopalachariar's reference is then secondarily cited by a few other sources. However, I went through every page of the Anandashrama edition of Kāvyaprakāśa with Nāgeśabhaṭṭa's commentary, but could not find this verse. The edition also has an index of verses cited in Govinda's Pradīpa and Nāgeśa's Uddyota, and this index does not list this verse. So, as far as we know, there is no confirmed source for this verse. Will keep on looking. Thanks for your assistance.
