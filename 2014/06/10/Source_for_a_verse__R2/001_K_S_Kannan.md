Dear Sir,

  

The reading I have come across is

dus"Ta-durgraha-vas'At

rather than your

durgraha-graha-vas'At.

  

This is cited in a footnote (in p. 22) in the book

Jagannatha Pandita

written by

Ramaswami Sastri V A

(Pub : 1942, Annamalainagar,

Annamalai University).

  

Further, it is indicated therein that this is quoted in

pp. 13 and 14, Vol. 2, in theIntroduction to

Yadavabhyudaya

by Gopalachari A V.

  

Hope this information is of some use to you.

  

Regards

Kannan
