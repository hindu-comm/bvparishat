Dear Shri Kannan,

  

  Thanks for these references. My library has neither of these publications. If, by chance, you have access to the second reference, namely the edition of Yādavābhyudaya by Gopalachari, please look it up and see if he gives a source for this verse. I think I know the verse containing the referece āryadruhām (āryadruhām ayam ahaṃ śamaye 'valepān), but not the gurudām. So it would be very useful if you can provide these two verses. Thanks once again.
