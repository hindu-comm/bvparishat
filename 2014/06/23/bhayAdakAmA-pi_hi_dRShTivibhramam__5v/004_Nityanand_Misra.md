Thanks Shankara Ji, Professor Rani Sadashiva Murty Ji and Swami Suprajnananda Ji for your responses.

Shankara Ji, I have downloaded the edition with the commentary of Jibananda Vidasagara. It is amazing how you keep track of so many books on Archive and DLI.

Prof. Murty Ji, the dual commentaries by Sudhakara Malaviya are very helpful. If it is not too much of a trouble for you, could you confirm if the continuation of the टिप्पणी on page 64 has an explanation for the use of ablative case (पञ्चमी) in भयात्? It seems both commentators have explained the ablative as per विभाषा गुणेऽस्त्रियाम्‌ (पा॰सू॰ २.३.२५), which allows for both ablative (पञ्चमी) and instrumental (तृतीया), since they have translated भयात् as भीत्या/भयेन. This contrasts with the use of शिक्षँ विद्योपादाने (धा॰पा॰ ६०५) by कालिदास in अशिक्षतास्रं पितुरेव मन्त्रवत् (र॰वं॰ ३.३१) where the पञ्चमी is from अपादाने पञ्चमी (पा॰सू॰ २.३.२८) and the अपादान संज्ञा is from from आख्यातोपयोगे (पा॰सू॰ १.४.२९).

Swami Suprajnananda Ji, Pranamami. Thanks for the additional verse from the Krishnadas Academy edition. Could you please confirm if it is the same book that Prof Murty referred to (with Hindi and Sanskrit commentaries by Dr. Sudhakar Malaviya?) I will try to get this book when I am in India.
