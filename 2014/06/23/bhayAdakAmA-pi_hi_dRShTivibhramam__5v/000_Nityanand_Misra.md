Namaste

  

The following verse is found in some (Maithila and Bengali recensions?) of अभिज्ञानशाकुन्तलम् –

  

यतो यतः षट्चरणोऽभिवर्तते ततस्ततः प्रेरितवामलोचना।

विवर्तितभ्रूरियमद्य शिक्षते भयादकामाऽपि हि दृष्टिविभ्रमम्॥ १.२४ ॥

  

I am looking for Sanskrit commentary/commentaries on this verse. The edition I have (MLBD, ISBN 81-208-2154-8, Subodhachandra Panta) does not have this verse.

  

Google Book search shows that the edition published by Raj Publishers (1962, edited by Vijaya Chandra Sharma) has a Sanskrit commentary on the verse. However, there is no preview and I can see only part of it. I could not locate this book on DLI or Archive.

  

I would be much obliged if any member could help with the text or scan of Sanskrit commentary on this verse.
