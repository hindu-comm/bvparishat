The Ministry of HRD also needs to reconsider if Arabic and Persian really deserve the “special treatment” as far as the Presidential Certificate of Honour is concerned.

<http://mhrd.gov.in/univ_pres_award_eng>

Presidential awards for Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit make sense – languages that are an integral part of Indian cultural and literary heritage and whose speakers are not limited to one specific religion.

But why Persian and Arabic? If these two, why not Hebrew, Aramaic, Punjabi, or English? Persian and Arabic are both foreign languages (unlike Urdu, which is Indian, and for which we already have Sahitya Akademi Award), speakers of which are exclusively people from one religion, and have hardly anything to do with cultural and literary legacy of India. Is this not taking the “topi-tilak” balancing act too far – “Sanskrit is communal, so let’s include Persian and Arabic also?”

I am not against Persian or Arabic (or Urdu) or their speakers. But grouping them with Sanskrit/Pali/Prakrit for the highest literary honour of the Republic of India? Anachronistic aberration or appeasement?
