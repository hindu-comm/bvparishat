I don't know about the other departments of BORI, but the librarian, Mr. Satish is a very helpful person. in 2008, I had given a few books to be photocopied, but couldn't pick them up before returning. For more than a year I couldn't get the books picked up from there. Mr. Satish used to remind me every now and then.
