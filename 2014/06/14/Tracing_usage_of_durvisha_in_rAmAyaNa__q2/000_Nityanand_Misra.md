Namaste

  

Here is what Monier Williams says on दुर्विश –

  

(H3) दुर्--विश \[p= 487,1\] \[L=94379\]  mfn. difficult to be entered **R. vi , ****19 , 16.**

  

He ascribes the usage to Rāmāyaṇa, but which verse is being referred to? I could not find the usage in the editions of the Vālmīkirāmāyaṇa I referred.
