Sanskrit is written in numerous regional scripts of India. Since independence Devanagari script has been adopted as official script for writing Sanskrit by Govt of India. Expect Tamil and Gurmukhi script Sanskrit is written in all modern scripts of India.

It is to be noted not all scripts which are used to write Sanskrit are used to write **Vedas**. In general the scripts are used for Buddhist religious texts such as Tibetan, Siddham and Thai etc. are not used to write Vedas.There is great variation in the marking of svaras .They differ from scripts, Vedas, Shakhas, regions, manuscript traditions, division/group of Vaidikas etc. It is also to be noted that the marking may differ from that used in manuscripts to the notation used in prints. E.g. a sign similar to vowel letter u is written above the letter to indicate udatta in early Grantha manuscripts while in modern prints it is unmarked.

In the following scripts ,Vedas have been written -Devanagari, Bengali/Assamese, Tirhuta (also known as Maithili),Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Grantha, Oriya, Sharada,Tigalari, Nandinagari and Newari. Tigalari and Nandinagari scripts are mainly used in Karnataka.****

*The notation used in Tigalari, Nandinagari, Tirhuta and Newari are quite unknown and different from other writing systems.*

Can any scholar give notation of marking svaras ,Vedic anusvara and Samavedic svaras with samples and attestation showing the usage of characters in both manuscripts and print in above scripts specially in above four scripts.

The notation in print in Modern Indian scripts are quite uniform and consistent. But, manuscripts show differences from print. Can any one give attestations in this regard.

Can I get printed samples of accented Samaveda along with rules in Kannada, Telugu, Bengali, Malayalam etc.Are Vedas written in Gujarati texts and manuscripts?

<http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n4389.pdf> Section 2.11 show threecharactersused in Nandinagari script.

Can manuscriptologists give samples of this usage in Nandinagari script and

marks for different Vedic anusvara used these lessor known Indian scripts.Are they same as Devanagari.
