I have not seen तिलकुसुम for its shape or colour. It may be by shape, like बिम्ब fruit compared to lips. The ripen bimba fruit will be coloured read, and the otherwise it would be green. So no one says it is ripen bimba fruit. Certain objects are compared with certain limbs traditionally. Certain works list the upamana-s to be compared with, but I don't remember the work.

In this case, it may be the shape, (I am not sure) as I have not seen the flower.
