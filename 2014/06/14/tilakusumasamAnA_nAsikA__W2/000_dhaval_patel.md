While working on a book on erotics, I came across this upamA.

I request the members to respond whether there exists such a upamA in kavi sampradAya or in any other literary work / shastra.  

References to other works would be welcome.

  

The verse has

तिलकुसुमसमानां बिभ्रती नासिकाञ्च

while depicting पद्मिनी
