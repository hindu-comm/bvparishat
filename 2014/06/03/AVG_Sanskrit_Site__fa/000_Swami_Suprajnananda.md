Dear Scholars,

Namaste. I am unable to open the website:[http://avg-sanskrit.org/](http://avg-sanskrit.org/)

When I open the site, it goes to

<http://sites.securepaynet.net/redirect_0.html>

  

  

Am I alone not getting this website or it happens to others too? It was a good site for me to search any sutra on the net.

  

  

\~With Regards,  
Swami Suprajnananda,
