Thanks for the detailes account of the system of 4 or 5 Mahavakya-s. Now the remaining question is very general, which texts are to be studied for understanding these Mahavakya-s.

There are vast literature around these, and please guide him as to learn any specific text to study these Mahavakya-s. And he has taken note of these, from Gopinath Kaviraja's list relating 4 to 4 muth-s which you have already refered to in your reply. Now the remaining question is that is there any single book for detailed study of these Mahavakya-s. Hope the bibliography may help him. For one thing, he may refer to the commentaries on the relevant Upanishad-s than any isolated study in independently. He wants deeper study.

  

Hope someone may help in suggesting such a book.
