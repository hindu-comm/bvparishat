Dear, I have a list of Shodasha (Sixteen) Mahavaakyas presented by a reputed scholar of Varanasi; four each from all the four Vedas, Ric, Yajus, Saman and Atharvan. I do not know on which basis they are so called,---it is presumed that they provide with great meaning, or require a great explanation. Regards,
