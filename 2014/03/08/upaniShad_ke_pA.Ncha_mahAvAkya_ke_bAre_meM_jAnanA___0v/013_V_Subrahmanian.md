One, among many sources, for studying the topic is: the fifth chapter of the PanchadashI of Swami Vidyaranya, titled 'mahAvAkya-viveka-prakaraNam'. The chapter has just eight verses, two each to explain each of the 'four' mahAvAkyas. The gloss of Sri Ramakrishna could be consulted for enhanced understanding. 

  

Also, in the vedAntaparibhAShA of Sri DharmarAja Adhvarin, the chapter titled 'lakShaNAvichAraH' (4th paricchedaH) and the 7th paricchedaH which deals with jagadutpattikramaH, pralayakramaH, jIveshvarasvarUpavichAraH, tvampadArthanirUpaNam, tat-tvam-padayoraikyanirUpaNam, etc. has considerable material on this topic.
