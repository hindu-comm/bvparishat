Rather than any one book, there is a vast amount of literature on it. Starting from Sankara bhagavatpAda's upaseSasAhasrI (3rd prose chapter and 18th verse chapter) to books being written today.



Re: the observation that tattvamasi but not other sentences are being interpreted as per *śāstra*, I'm not sure if this is a comment about the specific book described below or a generally about how the mahAvAkya-s are interpreted in advaita works.



If the latter, it is a combination of two things - the context in which the mahAvAkya appears in its source text and the interpretative approach necessitated thereby. For example, tattvamasi is interpreted and analyzed by anvaya-vyatireka reasoning, bhAga tyAga lakshaNa or jahad-ajahal-lakshaNa, where the guNa-s normally associated with tvam and the guNa-s normally associated with tat are both set aside in order to draw out the equation in the ground of both tvam and tat, which is nirguNa. This is because the sentence itself occurs as part of an instruction from uddAlaka to his son in the chAndogya. With ayamAtmA brahma, it is the jAgrat-svapna-sushupti-turIya context of the mANDUkya. Here, one arrives at the turIya after setting aside the three avasthA-s as not being ultimately real changes to the AtmA that seems to go through them on a daily basis, but always stands as the partless fourth (amAtraS caturthaH). This is adhyAropa of the avasthA-s on Atman, followed by the apavAda that reveals AtmA as brahma. Or elsewhere, in the Ananda-mImAMsA, it is again adhyAropa-apavAda, where every successive understanding of the Atman as annamaya, prANamaya etc. is transcended (upa-saM-kramaNa) to arrive at brahman = Atman = Ananda. Here, the approach is based on the fact that every sentient being knows itself, in some way or the other, i.e. mixed up with the not-self.The *śāstra* pointsto the final, correct means of knowing one's self (AtmA) as brahman.

Namaskaras,
