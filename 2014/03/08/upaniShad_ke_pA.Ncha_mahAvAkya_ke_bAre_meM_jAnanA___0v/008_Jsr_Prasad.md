Before a right book is referred to in this context, I'd like to bring to your kind notice the following: '*Mahāvākyavicāra*,' a tiny book (47 pages) based on the talks by Swami Dayananda Saraswati of Rishikesh. It is a general discussion on the nature of '*mahāvākya* using some anecdotes*.* I felt, '*Tat Tvam Asi'* is interpreted as per *śāstra* but not all remaining *mahāvākyas.* It can be either had from Rishikesh or from here -
