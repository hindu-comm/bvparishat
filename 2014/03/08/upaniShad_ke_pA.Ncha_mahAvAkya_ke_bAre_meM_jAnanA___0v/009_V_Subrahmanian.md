Here is the passage I referred to above:

  

स कदाचित्परमकारुणिकेनाचार्येणात्मज्ञानप्रबोधकृच्छब्दकार्यां वेदान्तमहावाक्यभेर्यां तत्कर्णमूले ताद्यमानायां......(Aitareya Up. bhAshya 1.3 14)

  

This reading of the highlighted word is found in some editions. In some editions the word is rendered as:वेदान्तमहाभेर्यां ...

  

\[When, however, on some rare occasion, the Master, in His infinite mercy, beats in the recesses of his ears, the drum that is the vedAntamahAvAkya which produces the sound that awakens him to the Knowledge of the Self....\]
