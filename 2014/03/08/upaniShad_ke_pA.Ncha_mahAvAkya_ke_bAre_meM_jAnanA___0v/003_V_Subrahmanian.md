Sir,

  

As per my knowledge the term 'mahAvAkya' is unique to Advaita Vedanta.
In this school it is held that 'that upanishadic sentence which teaches the identity of the jivAtman and the paramAtman is called a mahAvAkya'.
Even though one such from each of the four Veda-s is commonly identified, this school holds that there are countless mahAvAkya-s across the innumerable upaniShads. For example, the TaittiriyopaniShad sentence 'sa yashchAyam puruShe yashchAsAvAditye sa ekaH' is held to be of this category. 

  

In the sUtasamhitA - brahmagItA (of the skandapurANam) (5.82 - 84) we have this:

  

एक्त्वं यत्स्वतस्सिद्धं स हि वाक्यार्थ आस्तिकाः ।

  

....

  

अतो न प्रमितिं वाक्यं कुरुतेऽज्ञानबाधकम् ॥

  

\[Here it is said the 'vAkya' does not create the identity, for it is always there. What the vAkya accomplishes is, the removal of ignorance that covers that self-existing identity. \]

  

I have seen a shAnkarabhAShya passage for the Aitareya UpaniShad where the word 'mahAvAkya' is used, though I am not recalling the exact passage. 

Works like the 'sankShepashArIraka' and Madhusudana Saraswati's use this term.

  

There is a small book called 'mahAvAkyaratnAvaLiH' by s sannyasin Sri Ramachandra Yati, which has hundreds of such vAkya-s sourced from the 108 Upanishads. 

  

Works like the 'VivekachUDAmaNiH' give the general method of understanding the mahAvAkya-s.
