Pardon my response in English. I don't have a convenient keyboard mapping to Devanagari script allowed on my work computer, so typing in Hindi or saMskRta is a bit too time consuming for me.



Mahavakyas - four or five or more? The answer depends on the source that you consult. The answer from the vasttextual evidence is really that there are many Sruti sentences that can be described as mahavakyas.



However, the original question and the reference to an edition of the Sankara Bhashya connect theMahavakyas to the Mathas , i.e. the institutions of the Advaita Vedanta tradition. The answer to thislies not in multiple texts with different enumerations and differentlines of transmission, but in the pan-Indian traditions of the Dasanami Sannyasi Sampradaya. To get the correct picture of this, one has to take into account other sources of information as well, not just some of the well-known texts.



The crux of the enumeration of four Mahavakya lies in the rules governing formal entry into Sannyasa Ashrama within the Dasanami Sampradaya. Within this tradition, at the time of Upadesa by a Guru when a Sishya is initiated into Sannyasa, there is only one unequivocal answer. Namely, that there are four such sentences. See the manuals on Yatidharma in the Advaitatradition by Visvesvara Sarasvati (reputedly, aguru of the famous Madhusudana Sarasvati) and by Vasudevasrama. Agehananda Bharati's book, The Tantric Tradition, citessome text called mantramahodadhi (publication unknown, I'm citing from memory), which enumerates the same four sentences quoted by Gopinath Kaviraj and says, "iti paramahamsAnAM catvAri-maTha-dIkShA."



The authoritative source quoted for this rule in Dasanami tradition is the Sukarahasyopanishat, which says, "atha mahAvAkyAni catvAri, oM prajnAnaM brahma, oM ahaM brahmAsmi, oM tattvamasi, om ayamAtmA brahma, iti." These are counted as one each from each Veda,conveying the core aikya of brahman and AtmA(prajnAnaM brahma - aitareya - Rgveda, ahaM brahmAsmi - bRhadAraNyaka - yajurveda, tattvamasi - chAndogya - sAmaveda and ayamAtmA brahma - mANDUkya - atharvaveda). Within the Dasanami Sampradaya, there is also an old tradition of drawing a connectionforthese four sentences with the four Mathas at Sringeri, Dwaraka, Puri and Badrinath as the principal seats of this Sampradaya. The origins of this tradition are probably due to the fact that the numberfour occurs as a repeating theme in the history of the Advaita Vedanta tradition - four vedas, four adhyAyas with four pAdas each in the brahmasUtra text, four principal directions andfour key disciples of Sankaracarya.



That said, just as there are always candidates for the fifth veda status, there are various claims about a fifth mahAvAkya, especially intexts written/editedwithin the last couple of centuries. As far as the core traditions of the Dasanami Sampradaya are concerned, such variant claims about a fifth mahAvAkyaare merely digressions from a solid tradition that was no doubt consolidated many, many centuries ago. See various published studies of the tradition in the English language, by Jadunath Sarkar, G S Ghurye, Swami Sadananda Giri, Wade Dazey and Yoshitsugu Sawai. Publication details of these books may be found in the bibliography links available at <http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp>and in the references at the end of each page under the links on the history of the Advaita tradition.



Best regards,

ps. The SAnkara prakaraNa granthacalled pancIkaraNa, which is to be taught to the newly initiated Sannyasin (according toboth Visvesvara Sarasvati and Vasudevasrama), cites "prajnAnam AnandaM brahma" in all the editions that I have seen. This seems to be a combination of prajnAnaM brahma from aitareya and vijnAnam AnandaM brahma from the bRhadAraNyaka text.
