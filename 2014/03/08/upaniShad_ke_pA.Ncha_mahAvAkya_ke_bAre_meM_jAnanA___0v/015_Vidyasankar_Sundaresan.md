Traditionally, a commentary is called a vArttika, if itnot only interprets what is said in a text (uktaM), but crticially examines that which is not said well (dur-uktaM) and also fills in where the text is silent (an-uktaM).



A vArttika is therefore best understood as a critical commentary on a source text. Typically, commentaries tend to be in prose, while the source text is in either prose or verse. The two vArttikas by sureSvara on Sankara's taittirIya and bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya-s are unique in that they are in verse, where the source text is in prose.



Best regards,
