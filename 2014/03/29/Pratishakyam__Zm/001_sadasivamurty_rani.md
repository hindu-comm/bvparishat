Most of the Pratisakhyas are self explanatory. We can very easily understand them. Shukla Yajus Pratisakhya was published by Chokhamba Sanskrit Series Office, Varanasi 1 in 1967 with English translation of the text by Shrimati Indu Rastogi.

Rkpratisakhya also is available with Hindi Translation and Sanskrit Commentary. This was published by the Benares Hindu University Sanskrit Series in 1970. It was edited by Dr. Siddeshvar Bhattacharya. It is a very authentic one. The Hindi commentator of this text was Dr. Virendra Kumar Varma.
