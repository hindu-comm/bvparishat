Dear Friends  
  

I would like to know whether the there has been any discussion in this forum on वासना and संस्कारः. I tried to search but I did not get anything relevant. If there is any kindly provide the link.  

  
Else kindly consider this -  

I request you kindly shed light one on the following points from the point of view of the Yoga system of philosophy (not the vedantic view point)  
1.वासना and संस्कारः - .are these synonyms?  

2\. Is वासना a subset of संस्कारः or the vice versa or these two are two kinds of impressions created by one experience?  
3. which of the two is carried forward the next birth? - either of these or both ?  

4\. Is कर्माशय again another synonym for these two?  

  

thanks  
  
regards  

Dr.M.Jayaraman
