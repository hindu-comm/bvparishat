Dear scholars  
  
Namaste. This is a snapshot of Darpaṇa commentary on Raghuvaṁśa 2.24, edited by Paṇḍitaratna Revāprasāda Dvivedī (1973, published by BHU).  
  

Does anybody know which Koṣa is referred to as Viśva here? The verse has been completed by Revāprasāda Dvivedī Ji and the name of the Koṣa has also been added by him.  
  

I am looking for a full citation of the verse "baliścāmaradaṇḍe'pi ...".  
  

Thanks, Nityanand  

  

PS: With this reference and the usage as seen in Raghuvaṁśa 2.24 (offerings made for a cow), the word "paśubali" can take a completely new meaning.
