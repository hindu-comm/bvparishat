Sri Nityanand,  

  

î—“

I consulted stand alone e-versions of Caraka and Sushruta Samhitas with respective commentaries. I compiled the information from the referred sources on the herb. You may be interested to visit this link of National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage - <http://niimh.ap.nic.in/>  

It has wonderful online searchable e-texts in Ayurveda.  
  

Regards,  
Prasad
