Sir,

You may profitably refer to the excellent book,"Indian Materia Medica",by Dr.Nadkarni(either K.M.or M.K.Nadkarni) from Bombay-Mumbai (published some 100 years ago).It was possibly the first attempt in this direction in modern times.It could be available in old libraries of the Universities or Oriental Research Institutes.

It gives equivalents from almost all the Indian languages for the Sanskrit names,with their scientific(Latin/English) nomenclature.Very few scholars refer to this wonderful work which gives a fund of information.

Just verify whether its reprint is out or is available on internet.
