I don't know of the Scientfic name. There is one herbal name by वृश्चिक, as Medini also notes it.

  

वृश्चिकस्तुु द्रुणे राशौ शुककीटौषधी-भिदोः।"

  

Probably some comprehensive Ayurvedic dictionary may help. Anyhow we may look some member having experience with Ayurveda, who can help what herb is meant by वृश्चिक and is it the same what you call in Hindi बिछू बूटी which is probable.

  

There may or may not be synonyms. Only any Ayurvedakosha may help. Here is an information of compilation of such a Kosha:

  

regarding the Central University of Tibetan Studies (CUTS) Sarnath, Varanasi,

  

"During the year 2011-12, under the scheme of Compilation of Encyclopedic & Technical Dictionaries, the University compiled, Ayurveda-Kosha-5700 words entry,"  

  

which may be available if published.
