Namaste  
  
Members of the list familiar with Āyurveda may probably help with this. I am looking for the Sanskrit name for the Himalayan grass which is called बिच्छू बूटी (Bicchu Buti, or “scorpion herb”) or बीछी घास (Bichi Ghas, or “scorpion grass”) in Hindi. It is referred to in the Rāmacaritamānasa verse 2.46.6 also (छुअत चढ़ी जनु सब तन बीछी).



I think this page has the photograph for the grass (not sure as I have not seen it firsthand) –

From what I learned from different sources, the grass is called so in Hindi since the herb has hairs containing formic acid, and when one touches the plant, the hairs break and acid is injected into skin, causing rash and burning sensation in the whole body, similar to the sting of a scorpion.



I am not sure of the scientific name. As per [this link](http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/nimrethanda.pdf), the name of the herb in English is Indian stinging nettle, and the scientific name is *Urthica diaica L*. However, the Pandanus database of Indian plans gives the scientific name of the Indian stinging nettle as *Tragia involucrata L*, whose Sanskrit names are given as duḥsparśā and
durālabhā.

I also found another entry on the Pandanus database for *Heliotropium indicum L.* –

<http://iu.ff.cuni.cz/pandanus/database/details.php?id=3301>

which has an interesting Sanskrit name – vṛścikālī which sounds strikingly similar to the Hindi name. Interestingly, Monier Williams listed the meaning of vṛścikālī as *Tragia involucrata L,* which if true makes vṛścikālī the Indian stinging nettle. Either Monier Williams or Pandanus database has the incorrect scientific name.



Can anybody help with the correct Sanskrit name? Is it duḥsparśā, durālabhā or vṛścikālī (or something else)? Any references to the herb’s qualities in Āyurvedic works will also help.



Thanks, Nityanand
