On a brief survey, it is found that Caraka has very less number of  
references to दुरालभा but confirms this to be दुःस्पर्शा (च.सं.  
चि.स्था. 15). Sushruta agrees to this at चिकित्सास्थान, 11  
अध्यायः-प्रमेहचिकित्सितम् । Sushruta attributes this herb with several  
synonyms such as 'कर्कटका', 'अनन्ता', 'दीर्घमूला' , 'यावसः', 'यासः'  
and so on. It is also called 'कर्कटशृङ्गी' । Dalhana, commentator on  
Sushruta, describes this as कर्काटकाख्यः तृणजातिः... (Uttara tantra,  
Ch. 51). It seems to be a multipurpose herb used in 'कास, ज्वर,  
रक्तपित्त, कु्ष्ठ, राजयक्ष्मा, पाण्डु and ग्रहणी and many other  
disease conditions.  
  
वृश्चिकाली for दुरालभा ? Cakrapani on Caraka Samhita identifies  
वृश्चिकाली for वृश्चिकपत्री (वृश्चिकपत्री इति ख्याता; चिकित्सास्थान, 9  
अध्यायः). It acquires synonyms such as 'पलङ्कषा', 'पूतनापूर्वा,  
'गोलोमी' । Dalhana gives another synonym as 'वृश्चियाकः' (सू.स्था.  
अध्याय 39)। Based on a hint from him, not sure, whether it ca be  
presumed for दुरालभा as per the following: सविषसत्त्वचूर्णं  
वृश्चिकालीनामकं 'क्षुप'भेदं केचित् कथयन्ति (चि.स्था. 23 अध्यायः -  
शोफविचिकित्सितम्)।  
  
An Asava made of दुरालभा is referred to byCaraka.  
  
Scientific names are mostly controversial. However, Envis DB of FRLHT  
gives us some information on the above discussion. Envis identifies  
दुरालभा with 'Tragia  
involucrata L.' whereas Heliotropium indicum L. for वृश्चिकाली ।  
However, I've not seen Bhavaprakasa in this context. Related  
information is available with the attachment.
