Namaskarams!

  

Several chapter reviews of Doniger's book have been uploadedfollowing link. Uploading of chapter 6 (on Brahmanas) is in progress. Please circulate thislink as much as you can.

  

Please see the review of chapter 9 in particular (because that was intentionally done in a bit more detail) to see how she has twisted and distorted the Ramayana in her hatred for Rama and for Hindus.

I am working on other book reviews - Eg "On Hinduism" that Aleph did not reprint.

  

With regards,
