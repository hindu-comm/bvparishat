It would help if you let us know the language of the dissertation (English, Sanskrit or other) and the university where the thesis is to be submitted. If the university has not specified its own format, you may find the below useful if the thesis is in Sanskrit typed in the Devanagari script.

You may use the standard Unicode fonts like Sanskrit 2003, Siddhanta or Arial Unicode MS. A disadvantage with some of the Unicode fonts is that they do not have a boldface or italic version, so the word processor or typesetting software has to resort to what is called fake bolding or fake slanting which does not give a visually appealing look when printed on paper. The non-Unicode fonts like Chanakya or APS DV Stardust have bold and italics versions which appear good when printed. However, the number of ligatures available in the non-Unicode fonts are limited compared to Sanskrit 2003 and Siddhanta. For Vedic accents, Chanakya may not suffice and you may need to go for something like APS DV Vedic if you are using a non-Unicode font. Another issue with non-Unicode fonts is that typing will be harder - better to compose and edit the entire text in Unicode and then convert to a non-Unicode font at the end when typesetting. That is what we do for our Ashram's publications.  
  
Font size - depends on the font chosen. For example 12 size for APS-DV has almost the same height as 10 size for Sanskrit 2003. For Sanskrit 2003 and Arial Unicode MS, font size smaller than 10 is difficult to read when printed, and font size larger than 16 is too "loud", again not visually appealing. So a 12 pt or 14 pt size for these two fonts for the main text is ideal, and you can accordingly choose font sizes for headings, sub-headings, footnotes, etc. I personally prefer Chapter Name size \> Section name size \> Subsection name size = Main font size \> Footnote size, but if you do not have subsections and sections, you may choose something different. Make sure you experiment with some sizes and print a sample page or two to see which size works best.

This depends on the paper size and line spacing. As Sh. Sivasenani said, best to leave it to the Word processor or typesetting software.

One-and-a-half (1.5) or double line spacing looks good when printed. So if your font size is 12 pt, a spacing of 18 pt or 24 pt would be good. I personally prefer 1.5 spacing.

Again this depends on paper size. If being published as a book, it also depends on the number of pages and the binding to be used. Say if you use A4 size, a 2 cm or 1 inch margin should be enough.  
  

Thank You :-)
