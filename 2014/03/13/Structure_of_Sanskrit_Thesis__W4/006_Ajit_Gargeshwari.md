Dear Dr. Ganesh,  

I do not understand any thing by your strange remarks. So do not say I am unkind to students. Please do not make remarks without reading the students questions. If you know the scholar personally or you are sis Phd guide please give him the correct format for font, font size, line space etc. If a University has prescribed any format for Saanskrit thesis, the students guides will know and not others. How will BVP memebers know presribed thesis formats of a particular university.
