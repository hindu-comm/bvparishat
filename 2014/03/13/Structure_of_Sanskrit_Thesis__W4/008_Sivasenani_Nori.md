There are many conventions or styles. Different Universities, and often different Departments within Universities, follow different styles. MLA Handbook 7th Edition is very popular in Humanities departments. Any such style is much more than font, line spaces etc. The most important one tends to be the style of reference and citation. It is normal for Universities / Departments to specify more than a style sheet. Certain other features like Certificates, the contents of the Title Page are important. For instance, the guidelines of Harvard are given at:
<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/images/content/5/1/514508/PhDform_of_dissertation.pdf>. In India, students usually do not read through such manuals, but simply take a soft copy of the dissertations of seniors and re-use the format. One reason for this is that English remains difficult to read and understand for most students, but University-vyavahaara (mostly, but not everywhere - the Sanskrit Universities are a clear exception for instance) is based on the assumption that every student knows English very well.

  

If MLA 7 is acceptable in your University / Department, an ebook is available at<http://usc.ac.ir/IPPWebV1C035/TemplateFileFolder/11-20-2012/OriginalFolder/14920c09-d3d0-401e-a88f-3480925f9aa6_Handbook_for_Writers7th_Edition.pdf>. If you want to use this, you would be better off buying it, as you would use it many times and flipping a physical book is far easier than going through an ebook. You can buy it for Rs. 185 on Flipkart (<http://www.flipkart.com/mla-handbook-writers-research-papers-7th/p/itmdf8vyjun7u2yj>).

  

Now, within MLA 7, refer to Chapter 4, starting on Page 115 of the ebook, for the information you need. Summary is:

  

Font: Any easily readable typeface (eg. Times New Roman). Size: standard (eg. 12). Same font and size for Heading, sub-heading etc.

Number of lines per page: Leave it to the Word processor.  

Line space: Double  

Margins: 1 inch all round.  

  

I hope that this helps.
