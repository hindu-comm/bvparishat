Respected scholars,

I am looking for an article "Mandana, the Prime Minister of Malwa and his work", written by Mr. P.K. Gode and published in "Jaina Antiquary, Vol XI, no. 77, pp. 25-34".

I could not locate any trace of this volume of this old journal online.

If any scholar can provide this article / point to the right person to contact, I will be highly obliged.
