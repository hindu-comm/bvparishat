**Subject:** {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Commentary on dhArAkalpa (Ayurveda)  

  

Namaste,

  

Is there an ayurvedic text called dhArAkalpa written by Bhoja in print? Has it got any commentary? Is it available on internet? It is a short text on dhArA process. <https://archive.org/details/dharakalpa> here there is an e-text, but only with “mUlam”. Wanted to search DLI but its not working as usual for the last week from Russia. Found two references in Net- 1. Paavana J, Sankarnarayana Manoj. Keraliya Chikitsa Paddhati;Published by, Pad. Dr K Rajagopalan Ayurveda Granthamala Samithi,Thrissur; 2008; Dharakalpa: 29. p. 22 and 2.Vaidyamanorama — Vaidyamanorama and Dharakalpa, Hindi tika by Sukhadeva Vaidya, Gangavisnu Srikrsnadas, Laksmivenkatesvar Chapakhana - Do not know if they are same book I am searching for. Need information. Could someone help me, please? Need literature about Shirodhara, technical details not included in Caraka and Vagbhata.

  

M.G.
