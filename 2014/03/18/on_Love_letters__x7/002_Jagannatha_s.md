An additional information.

  

Madanalekha or Madana-shaasana-lekha is the word for love letter in Samskrta.

  

A Racchuka, scribe, claims that he deserves the title LekhakaShikhamani because he is demanded by young ladies for writing love letters !

  

  

(Quoted in K.K. Handique's *Yashastilaka and Indian Culture.* )
