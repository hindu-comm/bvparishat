What platform are you on (Linux/Windows/Mac etc)? How are you importing data? If you can attach a snapshot of the error and send a few sample lines from your source (both ITRANS and Unicode), it might help.  
  
For the Panchangam on our Ashram's website, we use MySQL on a Linux server. We use phpMyAdmin to import Devanagari Unicode data from CSVs into MySQL. It has always worked fine.
