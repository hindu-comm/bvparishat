Let us wait. Madhave Deshpande himself is a member in this forum and he will answer your question, I hope.

  

According to my limited knowledge, each क्रिया governs its कारक, and here the क्रिया governs the कारक, संप्रदान and पूर्वकालक्रिया can be one, or two or three or any क्रिया, but the condition for the use of ल्यप् is the same समानकर्तृकत्व for all the क्रिया-s and not समानकारकत्व. That much is certain according to the rule for क्त्वा and ल्यप्.

  

I could not follow the Karika and its translation without an example for the rule laid down in it. Hope Prof. Korada will clear the Karika with its applications and whether the example quoted by you is an exception or shortcoming to the rule.
