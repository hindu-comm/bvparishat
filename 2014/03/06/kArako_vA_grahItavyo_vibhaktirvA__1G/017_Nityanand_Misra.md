I think rather than saying no discussion is required, what is needed is a serious attempt to understand Prof. Gillon’s viewpoint in his paper, which is very well researched and well written. Prof. Gillon does not strongly claim that Bhartṛhari is wrong, rather he makes suggestions to extend the scope of the Kārikās *as translated or rephrased by Prof. Deshpande*. His terminology on page 102 of the festschrift – “… seen in this light, suggests … If this is so … perhaps as follows … ”, and also on page 105 – “it could turn out … Bhartṛhari’s rule is empirically adequate for … Saṁskṛta of Pāṇini’s time” indicates that he is making a proposal rather than a strong point.

Prof. Deshpande’s English translation and rephrasing may have been made in a specific context and “without much loss of generality,” for the purpose of easier explanation. It is like one comes across a simple explanation of an aphorism in Laghusiddhāntakaumudī, advanced explanation of the same aphorism in Siddhāntakaumudī and still more advanced treatment in Praudhamanoramā and Tattvabodhinī which also cover how apparent violations of the aphorism in epics can be explained. When he has time, Prof. Deshpande can best comment on whether his translation and rephrasing covers the entire universe covered by the original Kārikās, and if in light of Prof. Gillon’s paper, his rephrasing needs to be slightly reworded. Prof. Gillon may also be contacted directly to confirm if he considered other commentaries or interpretations of the Kārikās.

The crucial point here is Prof. Gillon starts with terminology in Prof. Deshpande’s rephrasing and not with the terminology in the original Kārikā. If he started with the original, the paper would be titled “Bhartṛhari’s rule for unexpressed Śakti” and not “Bhartṛhari’s rule for unexpressed Kāraka,” since Bhartṛhari talks about Śakti and not Kāraka in the two Kārikās.

This brings us back to the question in the thread. In this context, what is the best translation of शक्ति that Bhartṛhari speaks of in the two Kārikās, from the below?

(1) “Kāraka relation” or “shared/common Kāraka” or simply “Kāraka”

(2) “Shared/common Vibhakti”

(3) “Shared/common Kāraka and shared/common Vibhakti”.

To me, शक्ति is more than Kāraka. For example we take two sentences –

S1: गुरुर्माणवकं धर्मं ब्रूते

S2: गुरुर्माणवकाय धर्मं ब्रूते

In both sentences above, prima facie माणवक is the one of the two patients (Karma Kāraka) of the action, the other patient being धर्म. Is the शक्ति of the two forms माणवकम् and माणवकाय the same? I think the answer is no, because माणवकाय in the second statement has the शक्ति of communicating something more than माणवकम् the first, since one can get the following meanings from S2 which are not possible in S1 –

(1) One can apply क्रियार्थोपपदस्य च कर्मणि स्थानिनः (PS 2-3-14) to get the meaning गुरुर्माणवकं बोधयितुं धर्मं ब्रूते from the second sentence.

(2) With an Adhyāhara of हितम् or हिताय, one can apply हितयोगे च (V 2-3-13) to get the meaning गुरुर्माणवकाय हितं धर्मं ब्रूते/गुरुर्माणवकाय हिताय धर्मं ब्रूते.

(3) A third possibility is माणवक is not Karma Kāraka but the Sampradāna Kāraka after all, by the rule क्रियया यमभिप्रैति सोऽपि सम्प्रदानम् (V 1-4-32)

This example shows that even if we take माणवकाय in S2 as Karma Kāraka like माणवकम् in S1, S2 has a different शक्ति from S1 since S1 cannot express meanings (1) and (2) above while S2 can. This in my view demonstrates that शक्ति goes beyond Kāraka (and beyond Vibhakti too), and consequently Bhartṛhari’s Kārikās talk about common शक्ति, which in this context would mean both common Kāraka and common Vibhakti together.

With this argument one can explain that in the case of “तामहं दण्डवत्प्रणम्य तस्यै मदुदन्तमखिलमाख्याय”, since ताम् does not have the same Śakti as तस्यै even though they may be both indicate Karma Kāraka, the non-deletion of ताम् is also covered by the original Kārikā of Bhartṛhari’s (though not covered by the rephrasing by Prof. Deshpande).

Actually as Prof. Vishnu said, even without ताम्, “अहं दण्डवत्प्रणम्य तस्यै मदुदन्तमखिलमाख्याय” makes complete sense, though it may be said that the meaning is now slightly different. Two such examples are –

(1) पितापि गौतमस्तत्र तपसा ताववन्दित। आगत्य तस्मै गोत्रादि सर्वमाख्यातवांस्तदा।। (Mahābhārata Ādiparva 140-20). Here in the second have आगम् is सकर्मक but its patient (तं), expected in द्वितीया, has been omitted.

(2) निश्चित्यैवं ततो गत्वा रामाय प्राह लक्ष्मणः (Adhyātmarāmāyaṇa 7-8-46). Here again गम् is सकर्मक but its patient (राम), expected in द्वितीया, has been omitted.
