Since I am currently traveling, I am unable to participate in a discussion. However, I have sent a pdf of my book "Evolution of Syntactic Theory in Paninian Grammar" to Sukhada, and she can forward it to anyone who may be interested in it. The book was published in 1979 and is now out of print. With best wishes,
