नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

\> तदाकर्ण्य निजजननीं ज्ञात्वा तामहं दण्डवत्प्रणम्य तस्यै मदुदन्तमखिलमाख्याय  

\> धात्रीभाषणफुल्लवदनं  विस्मयविकसिताक्षं जनकमदर्शयम् । (दशकुमारचरितम्)  
\> here different क्त्वन्तs and ल्यबन्तs have got different/separate verbs .  

Sorry, I didn't understand the above sentence properly. Would you please explain it a little more. To me क्तवा and ल्यप् are  

  

-- I do not know where to start --

  

The verse quoted , प्रधानेतरयोः .. clearly states ' if there are two verbs' (not more than two) , main and subordinate , and if both of them have got a common Karakam - then how can you bring such a sentence where there are so many verbs , one main verb and many subordinate , and also without a common Karakam ?

The verse discusses an example such as - पक्त्वा ओदनः भुज्यते

ओदनं पक्त्वा ग्रामः गम्यते - is a counter example - how ? there are two different verbs for two different Karakas(always keep in mind Karaka is represented by a Vibhakti)

  

समानकतृकयोः पूर्वकाले क्त्वा - when there are two verbs(connected) the one that happens earlier takes ktvA - bhuktvA vrajati ( having had his meal he is going ).

समासे अनञ्पूर्वे क्त्वो ल्यप् - आकर्ण्य अदर्शयत् , प्रणम्य अदर्शयत्
etc. - so क्त्वा or ल्यप् - it makes no difference .

  

Whenever you take an example for क्त्वा / ल्यप् , there will be one प्रधनक्रिया and one अप्रधानक्रिया - व्रजति / गच्छति etc , the verb that is तिङन्त is always प्रधानक्रिया । The verb ending in क्त्वा / ल्यप् / तुमुन् etc. is अप्रधानक्रिया ।

  

In the above sentence - तत् is कर्मकारकम् and it is connected with an अप्रधानक्रिया - आकर्ण्य (ल्यबन्तम्) , निजजननीम् - कर्म , अप्रधानक्रिया - ज्ञात्वा ।

  

That means each and every अप्रधनक्रिया in the given sentence has got a separate कारकम् ।

  

Look at the प्रधानक्रिया - अदर्शयम् - has it got a single अप्रधानक्रिया as well as a common कारकम् ? Neither .

  

Therefore the sentence in question is not an example of the quoted verse .

  

I do not think any further discussion is required on this sentence .

  

Such examples ,when the Nyaya is very clear , generate confusion .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
