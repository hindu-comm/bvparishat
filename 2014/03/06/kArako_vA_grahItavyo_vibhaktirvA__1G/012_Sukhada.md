Prof. Madhav Deshpande replied to me in a personal mail saying that currently he is traveling and will not be able to deal with the discussions extensively. He has also sent a pdf copy of his book which Gillon has quoted in his paper and also told to share the ecopy of the same book to the interested members of BVP. (So, anybody interested in the book can drop me a mail.) Below I give a little context from his book where he clearly states that "the surface syntax (i.e. case endings) of the SHARED KARAKAS is determined by the principal action and not by the subordinate action"
