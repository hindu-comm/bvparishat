Please explain yourself the verses quoted and apply to the examples you have given.

  

I could not find any abnormality in the structure of the examples which makes anything in the Karika, applicable. First try to get the examples for the Karika, from the commentaries.

  

Sorry for jumping into the discussion.

  

The examples follow the rule

  

"समानकर्तृकयोः पूर्वकाले"

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/3.4.21.htm>  

  

It doesn't need समानकारकत्व, for the use of ल्यप्. Here काशिका says,

  

"शक्तिशक्तिमतोः भेदस्य अविवक्षितत्वात् समानकर्तृकता।"  

  

Please refer to any commentary first on the Karika's for its elucidation and example and how it is applicable in the cases you have referred.
