I was reading the paper  
"Bhartrhari's rule for unexpressed karakas  
The Problem of Control in Classical Sanskrit"  
by Brendan S. Gillon, appeared in "Indian Linguistic Studies:  
Festschrift in Honor of George Cardona". The paper can be found at the  
url: <http://tinyurl.com/pa35kbz>  
  
He quotes madhav Deshpande's translation for the कारिकाs mentioned in  
my previous mail (प्रधानेतरयोर्यत्र द्रव्यस्येत्यादि). The  
translation goes as follows:  
"When an entity (dravya) is separately related to main (pradhaana)  
and a subordinae (guNa) action, in such contexts the particular karaka  
relation based on the subordinate action abides by the karaka relation  
based on the main action. Where the particular karaka relation with  
respect to the main action is expressed by the main verbal inflection,  
the karaka relation based on the subordinate action, even though not  
denoted, becomes manifest."  
  
Gillon points out shortcoming in these कारिकाs and restates as:  
"Any pronoun in a clause of a sentence whose antecedent is a  
noun phrase in another clause, where one clause is subordinate to the  
other, must be omitted, should the pronoun and the antecedent noun  
phrase have the same case,"  
  
The reason for this modification for him is "ताम्" and "तस्यै" which  
have different cases for the same karaka in the sentence "तदाकर्ण्य  

निजजननीं ज्ञात्वा तामहं दण्डवत्प्रणम्य तस्यै मदुदन्तमखिलमाख्याय  

धात्रीभाषणफुल्लवदनं विस्मयविकसिताक्षं जनकमदर्शयम् । (दशकुमारचरितम्).  
  
Now my doubt is whether the कारिकाs talk only about the same kaarakas  
with same cases or only about same kaarakas.  
  
With deep regards,  
Sukhada  
  
PS: I'm afraid whether I've put the question correctly. Please bear with me.
