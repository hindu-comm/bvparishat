Thanks for the elucidation of the Karika's with examples from the forgoing lines of Vakyapadiya itself.

  

Now one more reqquest on my behalf. What is the matter about the translations of M Deshapande and the restatement of the rule byGillon *points out shortcoming in these कारिकाs* and restates as:

   "Any pronoun in a clause of a sentence whose antecedent is a  
noun phrase in another clause, where one clause is subordinate to the  

other, must be omitted, shou



d the pronoun and the antecedent noun

  
phrase have the same case,"

  

on the example of Dasakumaracarita. Was any one of them are wrong in interpreting the rule of Bhartrhari in aplying it to the example cited or Sukhada misunderstood their translation and the restatement or modification of the rule?

  

There is nothing incompatible to Paninian rule ktva suffixes as many as verbs could be subordinated to the main verb as I can see. Is the example quoted from Dasakumaracarita, incompatible with the rule explained by Bhartrhari in these lines as pointed out by Gilon?

  

Pardon me, I know you are busy with many studies.
