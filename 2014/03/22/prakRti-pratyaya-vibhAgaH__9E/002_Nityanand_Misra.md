Better to use "base" and "suffix" rather than "root" and "suffix". The reason is that "root" is usually used for धातु. प्रकृति could be a धातु, a कृदन्त प्रातिपदिक or even a प्रत्यय (see pages 241 and 242 of the first edition of A Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar by MM K V Abhyankar, 1961, Baroda, Oriental Institute - links below). If you use the word "root" for प्रकृति, readers may mistakenly think scope of प्रकृतिप्रत्ययविभाग is limited to suffixes ordained directly from roots only, which is not the case.
