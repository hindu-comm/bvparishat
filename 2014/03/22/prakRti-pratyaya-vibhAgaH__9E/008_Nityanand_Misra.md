So maybe a better translation would read  
  
“प्रकृति is a specific type (विशेष) of sound (शब्द), which is the cause (हेतु) of perception (अवबोध) of a meaning (अर्थ), and which is the starting point (अवधिभूत) for the ordainment (विधान) of suffixes (प्रत्यय).”  
  
which uses the "starting point" translation for अवधिभूत as S D Joshi and interprets विधान as भाववाचक (abstract concept, the act of ordaining a suffix) rather than the rule itself.
