Thanks, sure I use Abhyankar.

Allow me to continue, please. Can this statement पस्पशः शास्त्रारम्भसमर्थक उपोद्घातसन्दर्भग्रन्थः (मल्लिनाथः?) be translated as “paspaSa is \[like foreword\], preface \[which\] has capacity to (समर्थक?) start the discipline..” Please help to translate this compactly. And“प्रकृतिर्नाम अर्थावबोधहेतुः प्रत्यय-विधानावधिभूतः शब्दविशेषः -” Please help in translating this compactly into English. "prakRti is a meaningful word-element to which pratyaya is added" Is it right? How to express विधानावधिभूतः more specifically?" So not to make 3 new topics every day please allow to ask here as an exclusion to the rulescan this statement "अन्यपदार्थप्रधानो बहुव्रीहिः. be translated as “other-object-\[than-compound-member-word\]-prominent”? MW- "\[anya-padārtha-pradhāna\] m.f.n. having as chief sense that of another word (as a Bahu-vrīhi )". Thanks in advance.
