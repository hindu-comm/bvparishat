It depends on how one chooses to translate अवधिभूतः. The word can be decomposed as –

(1) अवधौ सीमायां भूतः स्थितः अवधिभूतः – situated at the end or boundary or limit (similar to अन्तर्भूतः = अन्तर्मध्ये भूतः स्थितः)

(2) अवधिः भूतः अवधिभूतः – has become the end or boundary or limit (similar to सूक्ष्मभूतम् = सूक्ष्मं भूतम्)

Whatever the विग्रह, prima facie अवधिभूत refers to the boundary or limit (अवधि) and not to something that is stationary, so explaining it as "stationary" or "unchanging" is something I am not convinced about. That अवधिभूत refers to the boundary or limit and not stationarity is confirmed by translations of the terms in some works.  



The Hindi commentary on SK's कारकप्रकरण by Shridharanand Ghildiyal, MLBD (1986), ISBN 9788120821484, page 116 translates अवधिभूतम् as अवधि-रूप सीमा … विश्लेष जहाँ से बताया जाए, ...

S D Joshi translates अवधिभूतम् used in KV on PS 1-4-24 as “starting point (of moving away)”. Refer The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini with Translation and Explanatory Notes: 1.4.1-1.4.110, Sahitya Akademi (1995), ISBN 9788172015107, page 90

I think the word अवधिभूत has been used to explain ध्रुवम् in KV and SK on PS 1-4-24 so that the explanation also covers cases where अपादान is used even when the limit of separation is not stationary, e.g. the famous example in MB अश्वात्त्रस्तात्पतितः = he has fallen from a trembling horse (S D Joshi translates as “shying horse”), where अश्व is not ध्रुव (stationary). MB addresses this by a वार्त्तिक (न वाऽध्रौव्यस्याविविक्षितत्वात्), while KV and SK explain ध्रुव to cover the limits of separation which may themselves be non-stationary.



अवधिभूत is also used in PM’s statement अवधिभूता या गौस्तन्निष्ठो यः पयःक्षरणानुकूलव्यापारः .....
