Namaste,

  

Please help. I need a source of the following verses- where they appeared for first time OR quoted by anyone in any other book - 1. "माला शिखा रेखा ध्वजो दण्डो रथो घनः। अष्टौ विकृतयः प्रोक्ताः क्रमपूर्वा महर्षिभिः।।" 2. संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः । नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते ॥

Once discussion was held on the latter verse in BVP - but I could not understand the conclusion.

  

M.G.
