नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

We may say -

  

the separation / analysis as root and suffix  or root - suffix - analysis(पकृतिप्रत्ययविभागः) ।

  

Please note in most o the cases it is better to adapt the term and offer some explanation in parenthesis / footnotes / endnotes .

  

Most of the translators of Vakyapadiyam (not me) have translated the term ’ शब्द ’ as 'Word' ('w' in capital).

Although we have usages like ' in other words ' , ' a few words ' , 'Foreword'  etc. it is desirable to adapt the term शब्द , just like योग , धर्म , पुण्य etc. .

  

These terms are culture-specific and pregnant with meaning.

  

The term शब्द is used to denote - वर्णः , प्रकृतिः , प्रत्ययः , पदम् , वाक्यम् , अवान्तरवाक्यम् , महावक्यम् ,परा , पश्यन्ती , मध्यमा (स्फोटः) , वैखरी , ध्वनिः , शब्दप्रमाणम् etc.(धातुर्वै शब्दः - महाभाष्यम्) ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
