Namaste

  

Almost all the Pancharatra text were published by pancharatra agama samiti prasuram Srirangam, Trichy. Almost 108 Pancharatra text they have published in grantha script.

But nearly two decades back this samithi became bankrupt and they were unable to re-publish the works. So you can try by enquiring some pandits in Srirangam temple who can very well guide you on this.

  

Thanks
