Dear Dr.Misra,

Some three years back,I examined a Thesis,entitled,"Sri Sudarsana-A Study" by (now) Dr.P.S.Raghuraman of Chennai. In it,he had given all the references to Sudarsana-chakra found in different Sanskrit Texts.I faintly remember that he had mentioned the Sudarshanasamhita in the Bibliography also(which must be published from the South). I do not have his contact details,but,I hereby furnish the email id of his Guide,Dr.Rajagopal Thiagarajan   [visva...@gmail.com]() .His cell no. is:09840316797. You may profitably contact him for further details.You may give my reference to Dr.Thiagarajan,if you so wish.

I must say that I sincerely appreciate your scholarly postings on BVP and feel proud that in the generation next to mine,there are some sound scholars of Sanskrit Grammar and allied subjects- who have a critical vision and clarity of thought/expression and do not blindly follow the tradition-in which they are well-trained(and well-trenched too,if I may say so).

Best luck in your intellectual pursuits.

  

Prof.Siddharth Wakankar, (91-9427339942).
