Dear Scholars,

     As we all know,धिक्normally follows accusative case. As an example to this rule, I happened to hear the last line of a verse.viz,

  

  

“धिक्तान्धिक्तान्धिगेतान् कथयति सततम् कीर्तनस्थो मृदङ्गः”



 I will be much obliged if anyone of you can help me in getting the full poem/the source of this poem.



Thanking you,
