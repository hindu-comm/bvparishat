Dear Scholars,

 As we all know, ixkœ zBd normally follows accusative case. As an example to this rule, I happened to hear the last line of a verse.viz,

“ ix´an! ix´an! ixgetan! kwyit sttm! kIÄRnSwae m&d¼> ”

 I will be much obliged if anyone of you can help me in getting the full poem/the source of this poem.

 Thanking you,
