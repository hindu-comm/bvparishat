I am curious to know about any publication on this theory. Pushkar is a
town situated 11 kilometers to the North-West of Ajmer.I have heard this legend, that sage Parasara is said to have been born here. His descendants, called Paraas'ara Brahmanas, are found in Pushkar and the surrounding area. The famous temple of Jeenmata has been cared for by Parasara Brahmans for the last 1,000 years. Has this legend anything got to do with Paraas'ara gr.hya suutra I don't know  
  

But Bashkal (Bashkula) branch is from the ancient land of Eastern Afghanistan is this related to Paraas'ara gr.hya suutra how Thanks
