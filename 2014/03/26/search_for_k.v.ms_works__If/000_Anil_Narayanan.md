Dear Scholars,

 I want to know the works of Kaippally Vasudevan Musat(K.V.M.). He was the student of Punnasseri Neelakantha Sarma. I came to know that K.V.M. has written a detailed commentary on Lalitasahasranaama and Vishnusahasranaama. Could anyone help me in tracing the other works of this Kerlite scholar.

 Thanking you,
