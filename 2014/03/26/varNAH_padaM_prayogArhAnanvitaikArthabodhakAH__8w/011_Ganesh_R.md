Dear Scholars,  
  

I really welcome the views of Prof Aklujkar and Sri Nityanada Mishra with regards to the use of thee word expression for shabda. Here it may not be out of place to remember Dr. K. Krishnamoorthy, one among the doyens of alaMkaarashaastra, who used to emphasize the need for the usage of the word 'expression' while understanding the phrases like शब्दार्थौ सहितौ काव्यम् , तददॊषौ शब्दार्थौ सगुणावनलंकृती पुनः क्वापि,
रमणीयार्थप्रतिपादकः शब्दः काव्यम् etc., as the word shabda is a holistic representation of the complete poem, the verbal expression of the poet. I personally prefer to suggest the word 'experience' for the word 'artha' as the great Prof. M. Hiriyanna too has hinted that rasa is the very art-experience (we can remember the famous dictum of Bharata here: न हि रसादृते कश्चिदर्थः प्रवर्तते). Even the astounding polymath and polyglot Dr. Ananda K. Koomaraswamy has coined many such holistic terms with reference to form and content in the field of art. Especially a phrase like structure and substance is note worthy. Since long me too have been coning and using using some phrases like rUpa and swarUpa, aakRti and aashaya to emphasize the holistic understanding of shabda and artha in the field of Indian aesthetics.
