Thanks Prof. Aklujkar Ji. After reading your post, I now think "expression" is the better word to use for शब्द if the context is linguistic or grammar.  
  
"Sound" may be used in the more generic context of Nyaya, as per which we have श्रोत्रग्राह्यो गुणः शब्दः। आकाशमात्रवृत्तिः। स द्विविधो ध्वन्यात्मको वर्णात्मकश्चेति। ध्वन्यात्मको भेर्यादौ। वर्णात्मकः संस्कृतभाषादिरूपः॥ (त.सं ३३) So here शब्द (=ध्वन्यात्मक + वर्णात्मक) may be called "sound", ध्वन्यात्मक शब्द as "inarticulate sound" and वर्णात्मक शब्द as "articuate speech" or maybe "expression" as you use.  
  
Panini also uses शब्द in the generic sense of Nyaya in the धातुपाठ. e.g. ध्वन शब्दे, and qualifies them with अव्यक्त at times e.g. गुजि अव्यक्ते शब्दे which would be probably the ध्वन्यात्मक शब्द in Nyaya. Panini uses व्यक्त वाक् for वर्णात्मक शब्द, e.g. गद व्यक्तायां वाचि or PS 1-3-48 व्यक्तवाचां समुच्चारणे. Patanjali's and Bhartrihari's use of the term शब्द may be different from Panini in some contexts.  
  
If the context is Mimamsa, where शब्द is eternal, a better translation is needed.  
  
Lastly I saw the use of the term "letter" for वर्ण in this post. In the given context, वर्ण may be better translated as syllable. Letters are units of writing or typography, letters form an alphabet or script. Syllables on the other hand are units of articulated speech, and together form lemmas, inflected forms, phrases, sentences et cetera.
