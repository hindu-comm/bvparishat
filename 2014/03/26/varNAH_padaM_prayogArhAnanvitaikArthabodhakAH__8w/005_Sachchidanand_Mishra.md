Dear Scholars,

It seems to me that the sentence should be translated as follows: The letters which are able to be used in a conversation (प्रयोगार्ह) and convey an unrelated meaning are a word.

Here it seems to me that we have to make a clear line between word and पद. In Sanskrit we have two words पद and शब्द. A proper synonym of शब्द is word, but what is a proper synonym of पद I am doubtful. Every पद is शब्द but every शब्द is not पद.

This is a very carefully crafted statement. If these criteria are fulfilled the letters would be considered a word. If the letters are not प्रयोगार्ह they are not a पद; for example a word devoid of विभक्ति is not प्रयोगार्ह, so is not a पद.  
However a sentence conveys a meaning as well as it is प्रयोगार्ह but it is not a पद for the simple reason that a sentence is not अनन्वितार्थबोधक rather it conveys a related meaning. A sentence is also not different from letters.

Namaste,

  

Please help to translate "वर्णाः पदं प्रयोगार्हानन्वितैकार्थबोधकाः।" "letters fit to be used \[in language\], joined together to give one meaning are \[form\] a word". Is it right?  

  

M.
