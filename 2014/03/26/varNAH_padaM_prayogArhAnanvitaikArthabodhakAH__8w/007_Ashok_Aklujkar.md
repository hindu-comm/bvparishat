A few additions to the very helpful post by Shri Nityanand Misra:  
  
I have used "expression" for ;"sabda" since 1965, when the context would not restrict it to 'phoneme', 'word'. 'inflected word', 'phrase', 'clause', 'sentence' or 'statement'. The generality of ";sabda" can thus be preserved. In most writings that Sanskritists, Indologists or philologists do, the context makes it clear that 'linguistic expression' or 'articulate expression' is meant. In the remaining contexts, "sound" or one of its synonyms or specific designations ("crowing", "thundering", etc.) may be preferred.  
  
When ;sabda as pada or 'inflected word/form' is meant, it should be understood that in some cases the inflection may be in the form of a zero morpheme, that is, not apparent. This is, in fact, what Paa.nini does. For example, techically suffixes are added to the nipaatas but are subsequently elided and remain only implicitly in the sentences of which they are a part.  
  
"Lemma" can be used for uninflected forms, but "lexeme", too, can be useful similarly.  
  
a.a.
