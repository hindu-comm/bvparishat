" ... single meaning (entity) which (meaning) can be used ..."

There is a mistake here. Meaning (अर्थ) is never used \[in speech\], rather words, sounds or letters are used. Meaning is the person or thing (dravya) or idea or concept that words or sounds used in speech represent. As Patañjali says in Mahābhāṣya

अथ गौरित्यत्र कः शब्दः। किं यत्तत्सास्नालाङ्गूलककुदखुरविषाण्यर्थरूपं सः शब्दः। नेत्याह। द्रव्यं नाम तत्।

Although meaning is inseparable from the speech (वागर्थाविव संपृक्तौ ...), it is not the same as speech. We never hear that Vālmīki, Vyāsa or Kālidāsa have used a specific meaning, but a particular word, sound or syllable.  

Therefore प्रयोगार्ह is to be taken as an adjective of वर्ण and not of एकार्थ. The Hindi commentary शशिकला by Satyavrat Singh (Chaukhambha, Varanasi, 1957, page 38) also takes प्रयोगार्ह as an adjective of वर्ण and not एकार्थ as you have taken above.
