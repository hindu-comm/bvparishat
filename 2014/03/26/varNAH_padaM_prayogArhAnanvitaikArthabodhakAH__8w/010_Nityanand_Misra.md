Hmm, maybe even वर्ण is used at two levels like शब्द? I mean to refer to both vowels and consonants at the broader level, and also for एकाच् (which is syllable in English)?  
  
I know of the appendix on Sanskrit prosody in the dictionary by V S Apte which uses वर्ण in the sense of a sound consisting of one vowel (syllable in English) - the entire section on वार्णिक वृत्तs organizes metres into headings like "चार वर्णों के चरण वाले वृत्त" (Metres with each foot consisting of four syllables), etc.  
  
Apte V.S. (2007), Sanskrit-Hindi Kosh Raj Sanskaran, ISBN
9788120820975, pp. 1186-1198.

Contrast this with how the term syllable is used in English prosody - octosyllable/octosyllabic verse, decasyllable/decasyllabic verse.
