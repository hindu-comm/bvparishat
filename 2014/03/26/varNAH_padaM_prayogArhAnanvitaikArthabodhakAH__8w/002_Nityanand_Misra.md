This defintion occurs in the second Pariccheda of Sāhityadarpaṇa.

My translation -

वर्णाः पदं प्रयोगार्हानन्वितैकार्थबोधकाः = Those syllables that are fit to be used \[in speech\], and which cause the perception of an unconnected specific meaning are \[called\] पद.



How I arrived at the translation follows below. The slightly involved compound प्रयोगार्हानन्वितैकार्थबोधकाः is to be first decomposed.

प्रयोगः = use/employment

प्रयोगम् अर्हन्ति = प्रयोगार्हाः = those that are fit to be used/capable of being used. The अच् suffix to the root अर्ह् with an accusative उपपद
comes from PS 3-2-12 अर्हः.

अन्वितः = joined or connected

न अन्वितः = अनन्वितः = not joined or connected

एकः = one/single/specific

अर्थः = meaning

अनन्वितश्चासौ एकश्चासौ अर्थश्च = अनन्वितैकार्थः = an unconnected specific meaning

बोधकाः = those which cause/result in/bring about perception

अनन्वितैकार्थस्य बोधकाः = अनन्वितैकार्थबोधकाः = those which cause the perception of an unconnected specific meaning

प्रयोगार्हाश्चामी अनन्वितैकार्थबोधकाः = प्रयोगार्हानन्वितैकार्थबोधकाः = those which are fit to be used and which cause the perception of an unconnected specific meaning

वर्णाः = syllables

प्रयोगार्हानन्वितैकार्थबोधकाः वर्णाः पदम् = Those syllables that are fit to be used \[in speech\], and which cause the perception of an unconnected specific meaning are \[called\] पद.

As per a Sanskrit commentary (see link below), the plurality is not intended in the definition. So even a single sylable which satisfies the above properties qualifies to be a पद. Examples would be indeclinables like उ, आ, etc and some others.
