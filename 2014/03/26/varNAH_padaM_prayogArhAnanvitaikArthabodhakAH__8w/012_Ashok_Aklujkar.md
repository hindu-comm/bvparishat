Only part II added to Appendix A by the editors of the revised and enlarged edition of Apte's \_The Practical ...\_, Dictionary\_ (has the word "var.nav.rtta" p 14 and p. 28 at the end of the third volume). This part is said to be a reproduction of Prof. H.D. Velankar's \_Jayadaaman\_, to which I have no access. In the earlier versions of Apte's dictionary part II is not found. Nor is "var.nav.rtta" found in what would now call part I. The common practice is to use "ak.sara-ga.na-v.rtta" for what the editors of the revised and enlarged edition give under "var.nav.rtta".
