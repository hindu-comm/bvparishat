Letters are units of writing or typography, letters form an alphabet or script.

I agree with the proposition that "letter" should not be used for [var.na](http://var.na) (although some scholars still follow the early Indologists in this misleading usage). But I do not agree with the suggestion that [var.na](http://var.na) should be translated as "syllable". Syllables, at least in the context of Skt, are almost entirely defined by vowels, but var.nas cover both vowels and consonants. "Phoneme" in the sense 'distinction-making sound' and as something different from "phone", which belongs to the phonetic level of language, is in my view the closest 'convenient' translation, unless one wishes to use phrases like "distinctive sound" every time "[var.na](http://var.na)" is used.  
  
True, in modern linguistics "phoneme" is used for all sounds within a word that are distinctive -- that make a difference to the outcome of communication, whereas in Paa.ninian grammar only generalized or abstracted forms of vowels are accepted as var.nas irrespective of their length, accent, etc. (thus, the //a// in the Pratyaahaara-suutras, although pronounced short (hrasva), stands for hrasva "a", diirgha "a" (i.e., "aa"), pluta "a3" etc.) and the length difference is viewed as something caused by praak.rta-dhvanis. It is better to use "phoneme" for [var.na](http://var.na) by keeping this difference in mind than to use "syllable", which has different primary associations in English and hence cannot reflect the essence of the [var.na](http://var.na) notion right away.  
  
(That there were some thinkers in the Indian tradition who thought like modern linguists and spoke of "aa" etc. as var.nas is known from a line in Kumaarila's ;Sloka-vaarttika: var.naantaratvam evaahu.h kecid [diirgha-plutaadi.su](http://diirgha-plutaadi.su).)  
  
Toward the end of the second åhnika of the Mahaabhaa.sya 'ak.sara-samaamnyaaya" is used in the sense of 'var.na-samaamnyaaya', Because we commonly translate ak.sara as 'syllable', it may be thought that [var.na](http://var.na) should be translated as 'syllable'. However, In the Mahaabhaa.sya passage concerned, ak.sara is used for something that endures -- is nitya, not for something that becomes a unit (within the sequence we called pada) because it has a vowel associated with it. In other words, like "[var.na](http://var.na)", "ak.sara" has more than one meaning associated with it.
