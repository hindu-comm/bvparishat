शब्द is better translated as sound. शब्द could be of an animal (खरशब्द, भेकशब्द) or bird (काकशब्द) or a cloud (घनशब्द), etc. "Word" is not used in English in these senses, but "sound" is.  
  
पद may be translated as "inflected form" (e.g. conjugated verb or inflected noun/pronoun, etc).  
  
"Lemma" is the term used for uninflected forms (which are listed in a dictionary).
