Another good name is साकेत.  
  
साकेतलोक is the name of the eternal लोक of श्रीराम. It was the name given by my paternal grandfather to the home he built in Lucknow. It is also the name of an epic poem by राष्ट्रकवि मैथिलीशरण गुप्त which opens with the famous lines -  
  
राम तुम्हारा चरित स्वयं ही काव्य है।  
कोई कवि बन जाए सहज संभाव्य है।
