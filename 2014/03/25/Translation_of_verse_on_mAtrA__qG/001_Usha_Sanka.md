Namaste,

Just trying to make the question clear-

  

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1o0ejKC_qk>  

Adding a video link- on this part of the question-

  

  

*Is it the same action that शुक्लयजुर्वेदीयवैदिकs do while indicating the svara of the sounds in the mantra they are chanting. They while reciting keep moving hands up, down, right, left, and close and open fingers indicating different sound occurences in the mantra. So is that falling of hand from shoulder to knee called as mAtrA-kAla as given in the definition?*

  

This is a shukla-yajur-veda-pATha video. (Can move to 1.45- for the indication of svara by hand)  

Please see the whole question below-

Thankyou
