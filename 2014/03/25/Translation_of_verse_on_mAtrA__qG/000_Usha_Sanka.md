Namaste

While attempting to define what is "mAtrA" found this verse in SKD and VCP-  

  

कालेन यावता पाणिः पर्य्येति जानुमण्डले ।  
सा मात्रा कविभिः प्रोक्ता ह्रस्वदीर्घप्लुते मता ॥  
इति प्राचीनाः ॥  

Please see the sentence translated into English. Is this right? (I know its not exact to the Samskrtam verse).

"The time taken (कालेन यावता) for the hand (पाणिः) to reach (पर्य्येति)the knee (जानुमण्डले) is defined as (प्रोक्ता) "mAtrA" by the learned (कविभिः). It is \[3 kinds-\] hrasva-dIrgha-pluta.(ह्रस्वदीर्घप्लुते) " (मता?)

Apte-

परी (परि-इ) 2 P. **1** To go round, circumambulate; (चरणन्यासं) भक्तिनम्रः परीयाः Me.57; Ms.2.48. **-2** To surround, encompass; हुतवहपरीतं गृहमिव Ś.5.1; विष- वल्लीभिः परीताभिर्महौषधिः R.12.61; so कोपपरीतमानसम् Ki. 2.25. **-3** To go to, think of (objects &c.). **-4** To be changed or transformed. **-5** To reach to. **-6** To run against.

  

Is it the same action that शुक्लयजुर्वेदीयवैदिकs do while indicating the svara of the sounds in the mantra they are chanting. They while reciting keep moving hands up, down, right, left, and close and open fingers indicating different sound occurences in the mantra. So is that falling of hand from shoulder to knee called as mAtrA-kAla as given in the definition?

Please help me understand this.

Thankyou
