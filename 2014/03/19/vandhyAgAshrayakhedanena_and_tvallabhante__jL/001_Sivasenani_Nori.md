A Kavi speaking for an Aalaamkaarika will have more than one level of meaning:

  

The ज्ञापक "नित्यानन्दकरम्" suggests that a comparison between the blessed and great (श्रील + उत्ताल) mango tree and Shri Nityanand Misra is intended. Now even the shade of this mango tree is a pleasure-giver (माधुर्यदा) what, then, is there to speak of the juice which is नित्यानन्दकरम् always causing happiness. O Mango tree, त्वदारधकाः those who resort to you are blessed (धन्याः). Now, there is no point in regretting (खेदन) of resorting to a barren tree, so enough of it. अर्थात् let's close it and move on.

  

Now, the last bit is an advice to Sri Mahesh Bhatt (note his original regret: खेदाय कल्पते) that there is no point in regretting that a question was posed but no answers were forthcoming as one has obtained the most detailed answer.

  

Shri Nityananda, no mean Kavi himself, has accepted the comparison with the blessed mango tree and has attributed the celebrated "rasa" to the cloud that Sri Sataavadhaani Ganesh is. This indebtedness has been physically reflected in that the return compliment closely follows the form of Sri Ganesh's original verse, including the embedding of the other's name.

  

At one more level, beyond the present verse, the "cloud" in the case of Shri Nityananda should be understood as his guru, as so many of his posts make clear as crystal.

  

Finally, it is surreal that these verses are to be treated as not connected to the original question; but that is a compliment in its own way, because disconnectedness at the level of vaacyaartha only increases the chamatkaarotkarsha of verses completely dependent on the original question!
