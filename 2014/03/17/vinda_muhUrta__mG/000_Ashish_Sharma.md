Dear Learned Scholars and Guruvars  
Pranaam  
Happy Holi to all of You.  
  
Can anyone tell me abount Vinda Muhurta(विन्द मुहूर्त)? It was used in Valmiki Ramayan by Jataayu:  

येन याति मुहूर्तेन सीतामादाय रावण:।  
विप्रणष्टं धनं क्षिप्रं तत्स्वामी प्रतिपद्यते।।  
विन्दो नाम मुहूर्तोSसौ न च काकुत्स्थ सोSबुधत्।

\- (वा. रा. ३/६८/१२-१३)

"In which spell of time Ravana has gone taking away Seetha, that spell is named as Vinda... if any riches are lost during that spell, the original possessor of those riches will repossess them very quickly... oh, Kakutstha, he that Ravana is unmindful of that fact and stole Seetha only to loose her..."

  

Somewhere it is mentioned that Vijay muhurta is being called as Vinda Muhurta and Vijay Muhurta is the 11th Muhurta ot of 15 Muhurtas therefore this Muhurta will came at late night(around 10:30pm). This will imply that Sitaharan happenned at night.  

I request others to show some light on this concept that whether its the 11th Muhurta or not and if its 11th Muhurta then Sitaharan happened at night?
