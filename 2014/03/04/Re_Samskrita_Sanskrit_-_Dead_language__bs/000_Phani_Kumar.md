Namaste.

  

1)As per Census of India (2001) over 14000 persons returned sanskrit as their mother tongue(Listed at no 17 after punjabi in the attached statement). I could not lay my hands on 2011 census figures. Predictably the number could not have become. Number of people who speak a language are always many more than those who have a language as their mother tongue.The number of people who speak sanskrit is increasing by the day thanks to the effort of organizations like Samskritbharati.

2)Sanskrit was one of the 14 languages included in the original eighth schedule to the constitution. the number has now risen to 22 after the inclusion of Sindhi,Konkani, Nepali,Meiteilon etc.

3)Sanskrit is one of the official languages of Uttarakhand.

4)The attached Wikipedia article lists 8 sanskrit speaking villages.

5)Apart from hundreds of exclusive sanskrit schools, there are any number of schools and colleges which have sanskrit departments.There are about 13 sanskrit universities.

6\) The number of institutions which teach Sanskrit abroad are also on the[rise.cf](http://rise.cf/); St.James Institutions of the UK, Australian National University etc(Please see the attached video). Presumably, they wouldnt be doing this if no benefit were to be had from learning sanskrit.

7)When you travel abroad, among the first things you notice is that English is not all that universal. In vast swathes of the planet, english is not even understood.In continental europe, latin America,China, knowledge of english is of a very limited help. So the point of sanskrit not being understood by many people etc doesn't wash.

8\) It is possible to argue that if one were to purge all indian languages of sanskrit words, it won't be posible to speak any language.

  

Is it, therefore, fair to say that the last native speaker of sanskrit has died and therefore it is time its obituary was drafted?
