Respected Scholars, Namakara!  
  
Topics are changed rather fast on BVP. We need time to understand and respond. Prof Korada gave us long list of verses from Vaakyapadiya. That is very nice of him.We get illuminated by wisdom of Prof Korada in his often referenced to Vaakyapadiya. I have a question for him and to other scholars. Why there is no discussion on Mahaabhaasya Pradeepa In this Hari gives his views on Phonetic and Phonemic basis of Sanskrit. Please explain. Thanks. N.R.Josjhi
