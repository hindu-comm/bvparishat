नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Prof Joshi

  

It is very difficult to discuss all works on a particular topic . So generally we quote the main source and members have to wade thru the commentaries .

  

You are right . If you take Mimamsa , they have a lot as they believe varna is important / real , there is no end.

  

I may be excused for not being able to satisfy .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
