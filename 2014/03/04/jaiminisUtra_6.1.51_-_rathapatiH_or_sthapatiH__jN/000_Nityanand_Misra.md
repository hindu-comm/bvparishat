Dear scholars  
  

What is the correct reading of Jaiminisūtra 6.1.51?  
  

As per the GRETIL e-text under [here](http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/mimamsa/jaimsutu.htm), the reading is  
  
rathapatirniṣādaḥ syācchabdasāmarthyāt  
  

As per the English translation of Śabarabhāṣya by MM Ganganath Jha (1934, Oriental Institute of Baroda, Vol II, page 1101), the reading of the Sūtra is  
  

The ‘Sthapati’ (Chief) should be taken to be a ‘Niṣāda’: becasue such is the sense of the word.  
  
If we go by Ganganath Jha's English rendition, the original reading should rather be -  
  

sthapatirniṣādaḥ syācchabdasāmarthyāt  
  

This is what I understood from a quick perusal of the Śabarabhāṣya also.  
  
Can somebody confirm if rathapatiḥ is a variant reading or (more likely) an error in the GRETIL e-text?  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
