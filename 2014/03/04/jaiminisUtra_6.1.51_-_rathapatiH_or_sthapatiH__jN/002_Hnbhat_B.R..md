I too agree with Sri Lalita. The gretil e-texts, have some typo errors, though many have proof-read texts, by other scholars other than who entered texts. It is not impossible that it is not such a typo error for स्थपति or wrongly read. The offten discussed compound in Nyaya texts,
"एतयैवावृता *निषादस्थपतिं* याजयेत्" is from the Shruti, which I could not locate other than in Apastamba Shrauta Sutra on the net.

  

It is also possible that it was wrongly read as रथपतिं typed wrongly by beginners.
