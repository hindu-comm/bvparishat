Namaste Korada Ji,



The chaturtha-yAma should be utilized for "brahmavidya-abhyAsa".



Shri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal of Sringeri while explaining the the chaturtha-yAma vishEsha quoted 1st sloka from 17th sarga of raghuvamsa as:



atithim nAma kAtutsthAtputram prApa kumudvatI

paschimAdyAmini yAmAtprasAdamiva chEtanA (17.1 of ra.vam.)



The mind of Kumudvati, after begettinga son called atithi,has been compared with the "buddhi-vikAsa / prakAsha" during the chaturtha-yAma.



regs,

sriram
