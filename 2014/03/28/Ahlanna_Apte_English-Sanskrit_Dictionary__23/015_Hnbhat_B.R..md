I could not understand you question.

  

Mr.Nityananda has given the derivation of the form from the root ह्लाद् as recorded in the Sanskrit English dictionary and also the translation for the English word as given in the English Sanskrit dictionary along with other synonyms for the English word happy.

  

Please read earlier posts for the derivation of the word आ+ह्लन्न. and if you want whether the word is used frequently in literature, one has to search.
