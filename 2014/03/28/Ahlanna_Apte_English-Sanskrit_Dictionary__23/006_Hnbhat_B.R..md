Thanks for correcting me.

  

It is incorrect form if derived as past particple from ह्लादी as इट् has been prohibited. It can be derived from causative form with णिच् or from the noun derived from the verb, with तदस्य संजातम्।



In the first, it will have causative effect, pleased or made happy, otherwise we take it as स्वार्थ णिच्। In the second, there is no difference meaning in general, that one who is having happiness.
