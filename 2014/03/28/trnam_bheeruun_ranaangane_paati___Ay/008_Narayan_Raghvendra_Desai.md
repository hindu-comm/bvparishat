Prof. B. B. Singh’s email:

  

  

I find that our Hindu Dharma is breaking into pieces. In particular, I am interested in our ancient scriptures describing Putra Dharma.  
  
Professionally, I have come across a situation where an ailing old lady is trying to throw out her only son from the house under the evil advice of her daughter who has a serious family dispute with her husband.  
  
The lady is sick and presently residing in her house with her spinster sister who is equally aged. The son who lives in the same flat is wanting to be with his mother to look after her. The flat belongs to her as a bequest from her husband. She has filed a Suit for eviction of the son from the flat. The advising daughter would not be able to look after the mother. Hence the son does not want to leave the mother alone in the flat. There is no financial difficulties with the family..  
  
It is my case that as the son, he has right to look after his mother when she is grown old, fragile and immobile. The law does not really favour the son since it is based on Western thinking and calls upon the son to maintain parents only financially.  
  
I feel that the pleading should be based on ethos and traditions of Hindu dharma. Hence I need to recite from the ancient texts delineating the duties of the son. Hopefully, the Judges would be convinced and will not order the eviction of the man from the house and let him stand by the side of his mother when she may need him.  
  
Please provide full references of texts in original Sanskrit.  
  
An early response would of great help to the son and mother.  
With regards
