hariH OM,  

jagannAthArya,  
  

 with prostrations at your feet, i submit the following:  
  

 whenever a fighter wishes to give up fight on the battlefield, he can take a tR^iNa in his mouth and announce his surrender to the attacker. something similar to showing white flag (i think this has some basis in the dharmashAstras. Have not checked).  
  

 The dashama grantha composed by viira guru gobinda singh (this man could compose poetic works in multiple languages inspite of a life spent on the battlefield for his life) has a reference to this. Pl see the link below (chaNDi di vaar, dasham granth, page 325)  
<http://www.sridasam.org/dasam?Action=Page&p=325&english=t&id=76390>  

the relevant excerpt is as below:  
ਸਸਤ੍ਰ ਪਜੂਤੇ ਦੁਰਗਸਾਹ ਗਹਿ ਸਭਨੀਂ ਬਾਹੀਂ ॥  
ससत्र पजूते दुरगसाह गहि सभनीं बाहीं ॥  
Durga held her weapons firmly in all her arms.  
  
ਸੁੰਭ ਨਿਸੁੰਭ ਸੰਘਾਰਿਆ ਵਥ ਜੇਹੇ ਸਾਹੀਂ ॥  
सु्मभ निसु्मभ संघारिआ वथ जेहे साहीं ॥  
She killed both Sumbh and Nisumbh, who were the masters of all the materials.  
  
ਫਉਜਾਂ ਰਾਕਸਿਆਰੀਆਂ ਦੇਖਿ ਰੋਵਨਿ ਧਾਹੀਂ ॥  
फउजां राकसिआरीआं देखि रोवनि धाहीं ॥  
Seeing this, the helpless forces of the demons, weep bitterly.  
  
ਮੁਹਿ ਕੜੂਚੇ ਘਾਹ ਦੇ ਛਡਿ ਘੋੜੇ ਰਾਹੀਂ ॥  
मुहि कड़ूचे घाह दे छडि घोड़े राहीं ॥  
Accepting their defeat (by putting the straws of grass in their mouth), and leaving their horses in the way;  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
