Thanks for the explanation, hitherto unknown to me. Now, any textual (preferably in Sanskrit) 'moola' or ground (basis) of such explanation be provided, as it was shown, only partially, in an earlier posting --Punjabi text---, where the way or manner of surrender is suggested so. Best regard,

\> Those who surrender (because they are cowards or because the had to decide to surrender) approached their opponents with a blade of grass (usually held between their teeth). The grass thus became a protector of their lives and a symbol of surrender and humiliation (suggestion: not man enough, similar to grass-eating animals).  
\>  
\> In [samit-paa.ni](http://samit-paa.ni), too, grass serves as a symbol of determination and/or surrender (to the guru/deity) but with a very different suggestion (sa.mkalpa, because of the difference of context).
