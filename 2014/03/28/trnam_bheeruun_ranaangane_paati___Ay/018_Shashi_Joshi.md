Does this have any connection to the recent farmer protest in Delhi where some were holding rats and snakes in their mouth?

  

Holdng grass makes you a herbivore, docile animal surrendering to master, holding a rat makes you like a dog, denigrating oneself further, in protest rather than surrender?
