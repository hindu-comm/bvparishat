Those who surrender (because they are cowards or because the had to decide to surrender) approached their opponents with a blade of grass (usually held between their teeth). The grass thus became a protector of their lives and a symbol of surrender and humiliation (suggestion: not man enough, similar to grass-eating animals).  
  
In [samit-paa.ni](http://samit-paa.ni), too, grass serves as a symbol of determination and/or surrender (to the guru/deity) but with a very different suggestion (sa.mkalpa, because of the difference of context).
