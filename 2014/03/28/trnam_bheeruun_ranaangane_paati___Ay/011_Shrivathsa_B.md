hariH OM,

  

 Thought of adding another reference.

  

 In Laṅkākāṇḍa of Rāmacaritamānasa we find -

दसन गहहु तृन कंठ कुठारी। परिजन सहित संग निज नारी॥ सादर जनकसुता करि आगें। एहि बिधि चलहु सकल भय त्यागें॥ (Rāmacaritamānasa chaupai 4 before doha 20).  

Aṅgada advises Rāvaṇa to go to Rāma with a grass / straw in his teeth as a sign of surrender.

  

Of interest is another instruction viz. carrying a axe by one's throat. May be this too was a sign of surrender.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
