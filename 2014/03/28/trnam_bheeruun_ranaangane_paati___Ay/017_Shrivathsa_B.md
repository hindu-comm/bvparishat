"would have made it clear if it is lying face down" इति चानुपपन्नम् - A poet is not writing a detailed "users manual". The greatest poets rely on the power of suggestion and vakrokti."

  

Utterly unnecessary sarcasm. I never claimed the need for poets to write user manuals. What i said was that they would have made clear about playing dead if that were the case. Playing dead and showing a blade of grass are so badly different that it may break the limits of the "vakrokti / suggestion" spring. Secondly you seem to want the kavis to cater to your kalpanā with their vakroktis whereas it appears not so when we read the original.

  

In any case, searching for a tṛṇa appears much easier compared to finding a location in the vicinity of the opponent with enough grass to cover one's face and have a little left over on the sides for the enemy to second guess that the chap has indeed surrendered! That sort of a user manual would be brilliant and user friendly indeed!
