How is this related to this thread?  
  
The respected lawyer could easily get this searching on Google. Or by referring works of P V Kane. Or by consulting a scholar in Mumbai.  
  
I wonder if this is the right forum to ask such questions. We had one yesterday asking about meaning of a singer's name. Today we are asked questions that will help a lawyer argue a case in court of law. This forum is for seekers of knowledge, not for seekers of information for personal use.
