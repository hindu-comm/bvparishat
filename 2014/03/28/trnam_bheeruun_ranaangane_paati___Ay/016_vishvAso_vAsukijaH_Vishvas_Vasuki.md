मित्रवर, "has to" इति नैव मयोक्तम्। "Eating grass as a way of surrender" इति प्रसिद्धिम् उपेक्ष्य "Falling face-down on grass as a way of pretending to be already dead" इत्यर्थं अविवक्षम्। "would have made it clear if it is lying face down" इति चानुपपन्नम् - A poet is not writing a detailed "users manual". The greatest poets rely on the power of suggestion and vakrokti.  
  
कविसमयविषये नरेशकीर्तिपत्रम् अलं‌ प्रमाणानि दर्शयति। बालकृष्णशास्त्रिणः कौ देशकालाव् इति तु जिज्ञासे।
