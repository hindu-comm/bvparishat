Attached is a document as received from shrii Jagannatha S. Sent here with his permission.

  

Interesting to note that another way of indicating surrender is to mount a valmiika.

  

vishvAsa, your contention that the yoddhA has to be face down doesn't seem right because one has to indicate surrender to someone. The person opposite to one has to see that you one has surrendered. In the examples given, viz. chaNDi di vaar and rAmacaritamAnasa, both of them were accomplished kavis and would have made it clear if it is lying face down on the ground. They clearly mention placing grass in one's mouth.
