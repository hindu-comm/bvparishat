Hello,  
  
My colleague Naresh Keerthi (Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth) has the following to add to this thread:  
  

DearRaghavan,

  

The idea of a tṛṇamukha being*avadhya*isfairly old and attestations can be traced to manysources. Putting a blade of grass or straw in one’s mouth was the equivalent of waving a white flag.This can be treated as a commonplace that entered literature as a*kaviprasiddhi*,but did not make it to the canonicallistof*kavisamaya*-s.

  

1. A rather absurd image from the Kavikarṇarasāyanam i.e. Colabhūpālīyam of Ṣaḍakṣaradeva \[17^(th)c. CE\] -  

  

मध्ये यातं शबरतनयौ पार्श्वयोः कृष्णसारं

प्रोन्मुक्तास्त्रौ युगपदचिरादूर्ध्वमुल्लङ्घ्य तावत्\|

धावत्यस्मिन् सपदि निवृतौ तूर्णमन्योन्यमुञ्चद्-

बाणाभ्यां तौ तृणमुखहतिः कस्य नाशं न धत्ते\|\|५.५४\|\|

  

2.Merutuṅga’sPrabandhacintāmaṇi\[14^(th)c. CE\]has this verseput in Dhanapāla’s mouthexhortingthe king towards non-violence -

  

वैरिणोऽपि हि मुच्यन्ते प्राणान्ते तृणभक्षणात्\|

तृणाहाराः सदैवेते हन्यन्ते पशवः कथम्\|\|

  

There is another verse in the Prabandhacintāmaṇi about howgrassis worshipped in the Parāmardi king’s realm ever since the king put it in his mouth and was granted his life by the Hero. I am unable to recall it.

  

3. In Bāṇabhaṭṭa’s Harṣacarita \[7^(th)c. CE\], in a passage describing the king Prabhākaravardhana, it says -  

  

यः परकीयेनापि कातरवल्लभेन रणमुखे तृणमुखेनेव धृतेनालज्जत जीवितेन/

  

4\. Verse from Śāntiparvan of Mahābhārata -

vṛddhaṃ balaṃ na hantavyaṃ naiva strī na ca vai dvijaḥ \|

tṛṇapūrṇamukhaścaiva tavāsmīti ca yo vadet \|\| (12.99.47.2)

  

There is some doubt about the interpretation of the first pāda, there is a variant reading vṛddham bālam, and also a variant hantavyaḥ. Those apart, only the third pāda is relevant here,and itsmeaning is unambiguous. This is possibly the oldest reference to the custom.  

  

5. Lastly, there is an episode cited by Rajmohan Gandhi in his book ‘Gandhi: the man, his people and the Empire’ wherein an individual approached Mahatma Gandhi, placed a blade of straw in his mouth and prostrated (as a symbol of abject surrender), much to Gandhiji’s horror. So the practice seems to have had some currency until the 20th century.
