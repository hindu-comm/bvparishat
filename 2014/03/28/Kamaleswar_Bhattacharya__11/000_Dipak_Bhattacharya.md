I inform the Parishad with grief that Professor Kamaleswar Bhattacharya passed away at the age of 85 on 16 March. He died at Dacca where he had come to visit his ancestral home.

Professor Bhattacharya translated the Siddhānatalakṣaṇa along with the Dīdhiti and the Ṭīkā into French. It was serially published in the *Journal Asiatique*. I received the fascicules till the nineties. But I do not know of its being published as a book. Bhattacharya also translated a part of the Śabdaśaktiprakāśikā into French. That too was published in the *Journal Asiatique* in 1979. Bhattacharya was an acclaimed international authority on Indo-Chinese epigraphy and Buddhist philosophy. His most well-known work is on the concept of Ātman in Buddhism. Professor Bhattacharya was Professor at Sorbonne from which post he retired in the nineties. He leaves behind his wife and son.

His funeral is being performed today in France.
