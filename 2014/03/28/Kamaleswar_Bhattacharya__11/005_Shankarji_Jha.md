Very Sad News and irrepairable loss for the entire sanskrit world of profound scholarship. The first time I met him in Bangkok and thence owr academic relaionship has been continued till recent times by way of
postal and e-mail media. May departed soul rest in eternal peace.

Sad news indeed. I met him in Moscow in 2003, interesting man he was, we exchanged emails afterwards. His luggage was really hard and it got worse when the wheels broke off, so yes I do remember him well. Blessed be his soul.
