I deeply mourn the death of Professor Kamaleshwar Bhattacharya. Actually I cannot digest it!I had just met him at Calicut for the International Vedic Conference this January .I promised to him that we shall meet in Paris, some day.This is not going to happen.....

I was greatly impressed by his erudition.

I send my condolences to his family and friends
