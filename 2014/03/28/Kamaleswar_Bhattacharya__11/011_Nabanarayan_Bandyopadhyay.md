I deeply mourn the sad demise of Prof. Kamaleswar Bhattacharya. Recently ( January 7-10, 2014) we met at International Vedic Workshop, Calicut, and talked on various subjects very cordially. It's an irreparable loss to the fraternity of Indological studies. He was kind enough to visit our School of Vedic Studies, Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, on several occasions and delivered lectures. I am attaching a photograph of him sitting among other learned participants in IVW-2014 and pray his soul rest in eternal peace.
