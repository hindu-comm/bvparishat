The sad demise of Professor Kamaleswar Bhattacharya is great loss to Indian Studies in general and Indian Philosophy in particular. Apart from Saivism, Nyaya and other schools of philosophy and his translation of texts in French the students of Buddhism know him for his English translation of Vigrahavyavartani with Sanskrit text in Roman Scripts.my heartfelt condolences to his family and admirers.Let his soul remain in peace.
