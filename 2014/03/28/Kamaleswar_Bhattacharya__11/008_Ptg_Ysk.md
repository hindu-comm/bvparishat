It is a shocking news that Prof. Kamaleswar Bhattacharya has passed away. I met him at EFEO Pondicherry in 1994. Since then I had an association with him. He too met me in Tirupati, (A.P.) when and all he come to Tirupati.  Last month He accepted my invitation to come to Rastriya Sanskrit Vidyappetha, Tirupati to deliver some lectures as a Visiting Professor, in the Dept. of Nyaya, and we are awaiting him. In the meanwhile this sad news made us very disappointed. I express my deep condolences to his family, on the sudden demise and I pray the God to give permanent peace to the departed soul ofProf. Kamaleswar Bhattacharya,

Sampathkumaracharya.
