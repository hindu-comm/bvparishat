Apart from these scholarly studies and translations, Mr. Bhattacharya was also a great scholar on Ancient Saivism such as the Pasupata system ; His book *La Religion du Pasupata dans l'ancien Cambodge* based on old Sanskrit inscriptions as well as many archeological remains found in Cambodia and Laos is also very great contribution to the study on the spread and prevalence of Pasupata Saivism in many parts of South-East Asia during the medieval period.  
  
When I met him in Paris in 2012 and mentioned about this book and a few of his articles on this subject published in Journal Asiatique, he just told "oh, that was the story running back to 50 years".
