Thanks Jagannatha Mahodaya for the Kāvyaprakāśa reference. After your post, I checked another edition of Kāvyaprakāśa - with the Uddyota Nāgojibhaṭṭa and Pradīpa by Govindaṭhakkara (same publisher, same editor, 1929, page 189). This edition gives the reading प्रापितः and also notes that one manuscript has the लम्भितः reading. In addition, one manuscript also had the कण्ठावली reading. I am going with the प्रापितः and कण्ठाटवी readings.
