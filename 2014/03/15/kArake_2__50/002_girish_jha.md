Dear colleagues,

"Kaarake"-it is an adhikaara rule.Acc. to Patanjali heresaptami ending has been used in

the sense of prathama.But actually as I understand Karaka means sambandha-vishesha(

(specific relation) and saptami has been used in a vishaya,hence it is a vaishayika saptamii."Karake" means "sambandhavisheshe vishaye".
