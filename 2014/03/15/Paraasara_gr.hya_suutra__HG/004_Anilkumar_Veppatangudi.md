Dear Shri Iyengar,

In the process of doing mu PhD on Vivaha Samskara, I spent considerable time trying to collect as many Grihya Sutra texts as possible. I was able to collect 18 of them. Though there are references to Parashara, Paingiya and Baijavapa Grihya Sutras in various texts and journals no one seems to have the original texts and they seem to be extinct. Of course, it would be wonderful if someone has the texts and they could be published.

Regards,

Anil Kumar
