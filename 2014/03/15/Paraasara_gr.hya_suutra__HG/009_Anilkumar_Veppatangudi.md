There is a Parashara Smriti as you probably know. Smriti texts are considered to be later than Grihya Sutra texts(600 to 300 BC) according to P.V.Kane(History of Dharma Shastra). There are also remarks in writings to say that there may have been more than one Rishi known as Parashara. Regarding reference to Parashara Grihya Sutra, I will have to search material with me to locate it and give the details which may take some time.
