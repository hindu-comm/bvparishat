This information aboutपराशरगृह्य andपारस्करगृह्यwhich I came across recently,may be of interest:

In the book "A Journey in Nepal and Northern India" by C.Bendall, (Cambridge Univ. Press 1886) the author lists all the Mss personally collected by him during his journey. These should be available in the Cambridge Univ. repository. Extracts are shown below:

The general confusion between the two Sutras is present in the above book also. In the contents under Sutra it is listed as Paaraskara....in plural. But in the notes on P 55, it is clearly Paraas'ara. In the Index also it is Paraas'ara only.  

The above Mss. of the Vedic text he purchased from Nepal should still be available in UK.
