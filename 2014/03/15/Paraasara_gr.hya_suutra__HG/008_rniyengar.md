My interest in knowing whether or not Paraas'ara GS exists stems from the recently reconstructed Paraas'aratantra (PT) text about which I have already made a few postings. I am collecting any and all textual information ascribed to Paraas'ara, to see whether any other ancient text correlates with PT. PT considering its dateable initial point goes to c 1400 BC is eminently qualified to be called Vedaangajyotis.a. It is older than Lagadha's-VJ, simply becuase computations come later than observations of the sky. My further curiosity is some of the GS texts specify keeping a place for Agastya in the south (saptarshis in the north) etc in the rituals. Upakarma is prescribed for the moth of Bhaadrapada in Hasta Nakshatra. There are alternates (S'raavana pournami) but Bhaadra-Hasta is interesting from astronomical perspective. Paraasharatantra specifies the first visibility of Agastya as coinciding with the rise of Hasta in the east (before sunsrise). It also says Agastya sets when Rohini sets in the west (following Sun). Based on this PT can be dated to c 1400 BC. Now if there were to be a Paraas'ara GS what would have been the prescription for Upaakarma? Is it possible somehow rise of Agastya (star Canopus) had a role in the early GS-rites? Here I like to make it clear the dates of GS texts fixed in oral/script form are later

than the existence of the rites themselves. My interest is in the rites per se and their probable initiation dates.

  

The information provided by Dr.Anil is interesting. I request him to give me the links to Paraas'ara in the texts he has surveyed.
