Dear scholars,

In continuation to our discussion on the existence or otherwise of(पराशरगृह्य) Paraas'ara gr.hyasuutra, by chance I came across the following information in the Mandya District Gazetteer (available on the web)

  

"Singararya (1680) was a brother of Thirumalarya; he was a recognizedscholar in the court of Chikkadevaraja. He is said to have authored two works,

namely, ‘Raghavabhyudaya’ and ‘Geetharnageswaram’; but these are notavailable now. Singararya has written commentaries on ‘Yadugiri

Narayanasthava’ and ‘Srishaila Dinacharya’, both being works by his brother.**Yoganandabhatta (1735-1810), father of scholar Alasingabhatta has written**

**‘Easwarasamhitha’, ‘Kathyayana Grihyasutraprayoga’ and a detailed commentaryentitled ‘Satwatamritham’ on Parashara Grihyasuthras"**

  

Being only 200 years old, (पराशरगृह्य) text may still be available in Mysore/Melkote or nearby. Any information on the commentary "Saatwataamr.tam ?"
