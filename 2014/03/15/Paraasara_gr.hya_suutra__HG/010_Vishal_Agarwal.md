Parashara is an Upashakha of the Bashkala Rigvedins. I have heard that a separate Parashara Grhyasutra manuscript (obtained from Pushkar) exists, but I have not been able to find any information on it. Note that the Calcutta RAS manuscript division does have anukramanis of Bashkala Shakha attributed to Parashara, per the Manuscript catalog ed by Harprasad Shastri, but they just lie in manuscripts (with a commentary on them by Jagannatha). During my two trips to Kolkata , I have unfortunately not had a chance to obtain access to them.
