There is an interesting book on this  
  
<http://www.amazon.com/The-Jaya-Samhita-i-Ur-Mahabharata/dp/B00949KXMI>  
  
Devdutt Pattanaik's *Jaya.* It is Illustrated to an extent, and accommodates several regional versions of stories and their themes.  
  

from this article <http://devdutt.com/articles/mahabharata/from-jaya-to-mahabharata.html>  

  
The original epic was called Jaya, then it was called Vijaya, then Bharata and finally Mahabharata. Jaya had about twenty five thousand verses while the final form had over one hundred thousand verses. Jaya was about spiritual victory, Vijaya was about material victory, Bharata was the story of a clan and Mahabharata included also the wisdom of the land called Bharat-varsha. What began as an auspicious idea, ended up becoming a massive documentation of realities that frightened the common man. Many modern scholars, writers and playwrights, exhausted and overwhelmed by the maze of stories of the final version of the epic, are convinced that the Mahabharata is only about the futility of war.
