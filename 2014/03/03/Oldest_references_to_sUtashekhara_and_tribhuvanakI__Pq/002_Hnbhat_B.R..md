Oh I am really sorry.

  

You didn't mention whether the two names are of persons or some medicine or anything else. I just thought they may be of a writer and his work.

  

The first seems to be a Ayurvedic Medicine

  

• शंख भस्म, *सूतशेखर रस*, कामदुधा रस, धात्री लौह, प्रवाल पिष्टी इत्यादि औषधियों को मिलाकर आपको भोजन के बाद पानी के साथ लेना चाहिए।  

  

पु. पित्तशामक एक औषधी मात्रा  

  

and the second seems to be the name of a person some Jain Bhattaraka, and also a name of a medicine:

  

Tribhuvan Keerti (त्रिभुवनकीर्ति ). 26 likes. Useful in all types of fever Has antipyretic and analgesic action. It is useful in Influenza, Bronchitis, Tonsillitis, Chicken pox & Measles Indications: Fever with chills, Tonsillitis, Common cold, Bronchitis, Chicken pox & Measles. Dose: 1 tab 3-4 times.  

  

You may have to refer to Ayurvedic Kosha's or Ayurvedic Yoga Grantha's like सहस्रयोग, for their descriptions as medicines and their composition of preparation.

  

त्रिभुवनकीर्ति

Name of an Acharya and a Bhattarak. नन्दिसंघ बलात्कारगण शुभचन्द्र आम्नाय (वि. 1499-1538) सूरत गद्दी के एक भट्टारक , काष्ठा संघ के एक आचार्य।

  

In case of this Acharya, you may look into the list of Jain Acharya's.

  

Hope your friend get some reply from the group, if he can specify his purpose and modify the question.
