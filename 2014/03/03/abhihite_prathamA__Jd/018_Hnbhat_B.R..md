It has been specifically mentioned in short in the Vritti in काशिका wih examples

: on "अनभिहिते"केन अनभिहिते?तिङ्कृत्तद्धितसमासैः परिसङ्ख्यानम्। वक्ष्यति, कर्मणि द्वितीया[२।३।२](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/sarvanisutrani/2.3.2.htm)कटं कर्तोति। ग्रामं गच्छति।अनभिहिते इति किम्?

  

For details of the examples, any commentary can be consulted. The same has been suggested in सिद्धान्तकौमुदी "अभिधानं च प्रायेण कृत्तद्धिमासैः"
and क्वचित् निपातेनाप्यभिधानम्; And the question of अभिधान and अनभिधान had been discussed in detail in our list in the thread provided in the link given in my first post and in the post of Prof. Korada also in this topic. Please see the earlier discussion which includes all the cases of अनभिधान and अभिधान, much more in detail and need not be repeated hee again.
