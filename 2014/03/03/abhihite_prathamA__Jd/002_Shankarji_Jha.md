Thanks, dear Bhatta Ji, for raising a common point of common interest. In my humble opinion, word 'Abhihite' means 'in case of the subject (Kartraa) under Kartri-vaachya (active voice), and the word 'Anabhihite' means ' the same in the case of Karma-vaachya--Passive voice. This is my humble submission about your substantive explanation. Regards,
