It may be even clearer to state that the [vaiyaakara.na](http://vaiyaakara.na) standpoint is kart.r, karman or bhaava whichever is meant by the lakaara etc is abhihita. abhihita means' meant' 'stated' . la.h [karma.ni](http://karma.ni) ca bhaave caakarmakebhya.h (3.4.69) means the lakaara might mean any of these three.
