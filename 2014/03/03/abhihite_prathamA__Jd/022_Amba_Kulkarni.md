We are aware of the problem.  
The anuv.rttis are generated automatically looking at the range. The cases of Maṇḍūkapluti need to be corrected manually, and as you have illustrated there are differences of opinion. So we need to annotate variations in interpretation, as you have shown in the table below. The book we followed to get the range is Ashtaadhyaayii by GopalDatta Pande from Chaukhamba Varanasi.  
  

With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni
