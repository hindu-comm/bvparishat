Dear Chakravaty, my reply has some other context. In case of
'Karma-vachya, a Karman is made subject ( say, by force) by applying 1st vibhakti there, and then it is called Abhihita or' Abhihita Karman' and then it is called 'Abhihite Kartari Karmani vaa Prathathamaa syaat. Anyway, I like and get happy by such discussions. REgards,
