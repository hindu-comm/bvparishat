Dear Bhat ji and Nityananda ji,

  

Thank you very much for your kind explanation of the topic. I really din't know the fact that the अनभिहित अधिकार is applicable exclusively in the case of the कारकविभक्तिs. I specially thank Nityananda Ji for providing the comprehensive table of the adhikaara of 'anabhihite'. It is very useful indeed.

  

But I still have some doubts.

You have said "I have shown there in the case of कर्तृकारक when it is अभिहित and fallsunder अनभिहित अधिकार." This line is not clear to me.

How does the sutra 'प्रातिपदिकार्थ...’ justify the प्रथमा in the अभिहित case?

Could you kindly explain these two things?

  

Regards,

Deepro.
