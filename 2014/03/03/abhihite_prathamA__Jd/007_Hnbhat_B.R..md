Already replied in short, अनभिहित

does not apply in the case of प्रातिपदिकार्थ-- etc. Sutra.

  

What would you expect, when case of अनभिहित कर्तृ has been included in the first case कारकविभक्ति, कर्तृकरणयोस्तृतीया by applying it to the प्रातिपदिपदिकार्थ - सूत्र? I asked the same question to you in may first question and the same had been explained by ब्रह्मदत्तजिज्ञासु in his प्रथमावृत्ति by limiting its use to कारकविभक्ति.

  

Now it is up to you, to think whether प्रातिपदिक-सूत्र prescribes प्रथमा, as करकविभक्ति, to be the target of अनभिहित अधिकार?

  

How Panini can prescribe both प्रथमा and तृतीया both to the case of अनभिहितकर्तृ? That is the reason ब्रह्मदत्तजिज्ञासु explained it is applicable especially to कारकविभक्ति and not in other cases of विभक्ति prescribing rules, though it is prolonged up to the end, as Nityananda has shown.
