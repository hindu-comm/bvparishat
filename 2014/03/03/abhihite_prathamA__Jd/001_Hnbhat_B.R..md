How did yourself decide it should fall under अनभिहिते for any purpose? 

  

According to the commentators, "अनभिहिते" applies in the case of कारकविभक्ति-s only, due to its application.

  

"अनभिहिते अनुक्ते, अनिर्दिष्टे कर्मादौ विभक्तिर् भवति। केन अनभिहिते? तिङ्कृत्तद्धितसमासैः परिसङ्ख्यानम्। वक्ष्यति, कर्मणि द्वितीया २।३।२ कटं करोति। ग्रामं गच्छति।"  

  

is the explanation for the सूत्र you referred to as authority. The counter examples make it clear:

  

अनभिहिते इति किम्?तिङ् क्रियते कटः।  

  

in which case, the कर्ता is not अभिहित, by the तिङ्, but only the कर्म. So, in स कटं करोति, the तिङ् mentions the कर्ता, and not कर्म. Hence कर्म takes by the rule, कर्मणि द्वितीया। And in the case of the second sentence, the कर्म is अभिहित by the तिङ्, अभिहिते प्रथमा only. अनभिहिते कर्तरि, तृतीया, तेन कटः क्रियते। That is the purpose of अधिकार of अनभिहिते।

  

And it applies in the case of कारकविभक्ति only. and not in any other cases. I have shown there in the case of कर्तृकारक when it is अभिहित and falls under अनभिहित अधिकार. Under कारकविभक्ति, which कारक-s अभिहित and अनभिहित is the only the criteria for the कारकविभक्ति-s.

  

सामान्येन आपादपरिसमाप्तेः, अधिकारः अयं वेदितव्यः, विशेषस्तु कारकविभक्तिषु एव प्रवर्तते न तु उपपदविभक्तिषु, तत्र अनावश्यकत्वात्॥  

  

In this case specifically it prescribes the case for अभिहित, as in the case of अनभिहितः कर्ता, it takes only तृतीया and here there is no other purpose of अनभिहित अधिकार, which is not prescribed as कर्मणि द्वितीया, कर्तृकरणयोस्तृतीया, etc. What made you think this falls under अनभिहिते अधिकारः as अनभिहितकर्तृ?
