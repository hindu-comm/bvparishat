It is not only applicable in the case of कर्म, but all the कारकविभक्ति-s as per the explanation of Brahmabandhu Jijnasu.

  

So प्रथमा is not a कारकविभक्ति, as it is not prescribed like कर्मणि द्वितीया, कर्तृकरणयोस्तृतीया, etc. based on कारक-s. There is no point in applying अनभिहिते adhikara, though its jurisdiction is up to चतुर्थी चाशिष्यन्यतरस्याम्, when विभक्ति topic is wound up.
