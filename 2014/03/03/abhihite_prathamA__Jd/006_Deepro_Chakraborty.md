Dear Sankar ji,

As far my understanding goes the term 'abhihita' means not only the kartR (agent) of kartRvaacya but also the karman (object) of karmavaacya. In other words, anything which is a subject of a sentence (which the verb follows) can be called 'abhihita'. So,

  

kumbhakAraH (agent and subject) ghaTaM (object) karoti \[Potter makes pot\]

kumbhakAreNa (agent) ghaTaH (object and subject) kriyate \[pot is made by potter\]

  

In the first example 'kumbhakAraH', the agent (kartR) is the subject (abhihita)

and in the second example 'ghaTaH', the object (karman) is the subject (abhihita).

Please correct me if I am wrong.

Regards,

Deepro.
