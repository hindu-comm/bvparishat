Dear All,

A very elementary question is long since hovering over my mind-- by which Paninian rule does the subject of a sentence attain the first case ending?

I asked some of my friends who studied grammar in traditional schools. According to them it is the very rule 'प्रातिपदिकार्थलिङ्गपरिमाणवचनमात्रे प्रथमा’ which mandates the first case ending in the subject. But their explanation was not satisfactory to me or I did not understand their interpretation properly that how can a सूत्र which falls under the अधिकार of अनभिहित can mandate प्रथमा in the अभिहित?

It might seem a naive question, but I am really eager to know a proper explanation.

I would be very grateful to you if any of you kindly answer my question or refer to a post where this issue is discussed.

Sincerely

Deepro.
