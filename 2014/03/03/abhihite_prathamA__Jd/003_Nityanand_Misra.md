The answer is simple – that there is not Anuvṛtti of “2-3-1 anabhihite” in 2-3-46 at all.

Although unlike Dr. Bhat, I am not surprised at the question. It is a common misconception that Anuvṛtti of “2-3-1 anabhihite” runs throughout the third Pāda of second Adhyāya. Even on the University of Hyderabad website, all the Sūtras of the third Pāda of second Adhyāya show the Anuvṛtti of “2-3-1 anabhihite” which is not correct –

<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/scl/ashtadhyayi_simulator/aRt.html>

The page says “Anuvrutti mark up done by: Dr. V. Sheeba with the help of RSVP Shabdabodha students (2006-08)”. I hope Dr. V. Sheeba and Dr. Amba Kulkarni (both BVP members) note this and get it corrected.

The fact is there is Anuvṛtti of 2-3-1 is by what is known as Maṇḍūkapluti Nyāya – it occurs in some Sūtras, then does not occur in some, then again occurs in some, and so on. To see which Sūtras have the Anuvṛtti and which do not, you may refer the standard commentaries. Although the commentaries may differ in some Sūtras, I do not recall any commentary showing the Anuvṛtti of “2-3-1 anabhihite” in 2-3-46 (if it did, none of the Kartari Prayogas would be accomplished by Paninian system). 

As an example, see the table below which I had compiled some time back. It shows the list of Sūtras where the Anuvṛtti of 2-3-1 is shown as explained by BJ = Brahmadatta Jijñāsu (Prathamā Vṛtti, Volume I, Radha Press: New Delhi, 2003) and RNS = Rāma Nātha Śarmā (The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Paṇini, Volume III, Munshiram Manoharlal: New Dehi, 2002).
