This is what shrI H N Bhat already posted:  
अनभिहिते अनुक्ते, अनिर्दिष्टे कर्मादौ विभक्तिर् भवति। केन अनभिहिते? तिङ्कृत्तद्धितसमासैः परिसङ्ख्यानम्। वक्ष्यति, कर्मणि द्वितीया २।३।२ कटं करोति। ग्रामं गच्छति।  
  
Now,  
तत्र येनानभिहिते इत्युक्तं तेनैव अभिहिते इति ज्ञातव्यम् । तथा च तिङ्कृत्तद्धितसमासैरनभिहिते इति निर्णये कः क्लेशः ।

  
  

Again, the same post of shrI dIpaka bhaTTAchArya which you quoted says:  
abhihita. abhihita means' meant' 'stated' . la.h [karma.ni](http://karma.ni) ca bhaave caakarmakebhya.h (3.4.69) means the lakaara might mean any of these three.  
  

So, it is clear that bhaTTAchArya is saying that pANini-sUtram says that 'lakAra is used to state three meanings'. So, you can easily get that 'abhihite' means 'stated by lakAra' - according to him.  
  

This is also in confirmation with quote of shrI H N Bhat as lakAra was counted by him as ti\~N.
