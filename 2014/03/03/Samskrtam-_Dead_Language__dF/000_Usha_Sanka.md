Namaste

*For Sanskrit is taught as a ‘Dead language’ which is defined as a ‘ language no longer spoken by living people and in circulation in society’ (!) . *  

  

Apart from discussions, opinions, points made individually in different contexts,***is there a full-fledged paper/article/book/seminar***where this issue has been***academically dealt***by any Samskrtam scholars? (Searched BVP and samskrita groups for the points-)  

Was looking for something where the issue is***systematically, academically and point-wise way analysed***in these lines-

1\. What is a dead language? What is a language first? What aspects does it have? (just speaking and writing?)

2\. What are the basic criteria for a dead language? Are they applicable to Samskrtam fully?

3\. Samskrtam vis a vis other dead languages of the world

4\. Samskrtam status, standards and role as a language in modern world context..

5\. Indian traditional approach on this issue vs non-Indian standing.

6\. Who, why and when for the first time - had called Samskrtam dead? Are they Indian or Non-Indian?

Keeping in view, Special condition of Samskrtam, can we conclude her alive, even if not "spoken" in general terms?

  

Or if no paper yet, if anyone wanted to write one, what lines should one think and approach on this issue? Is it always to be divided between indifferent non-samskrtam and emotional samskrtam standards..?
