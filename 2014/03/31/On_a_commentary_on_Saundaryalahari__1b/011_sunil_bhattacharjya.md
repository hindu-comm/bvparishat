Dear Prof. Shivakumarji,  
  

The Subhagodaya Stuti was actually composed by Gaudapadacharya, the Paramguru (that is, guru's guru) of Adi Shankaracharya.. What you need, seems to be, a book like the Subhagodaya stuti and its commentary. Quite a number of years ago I was contacting an ashrama in Rishikesh on this subject. The Guru there shifted to Jabbalpur and his grandson (from his Purvashrama) was very kind to send me a very old copy of his commentary on the Subhagodaya. Because of shifting places the book is misplaced and I hope to search for it in near future. May be, if you ask somebody having access to ashramas im Rishikesh, will be able to help you find another copy of that commentary.. Of course, the scholars in this great forum, may know of other such explanatory books from other sources.  
  

Regards,
