SAdara praNAm,  
  

Srividya though generally refers to Srichakra pooja externally,  

for solving problems in life, the same is *done internally for  
*

*attaining the supreme.* This, to my knowledge is Samayachara.  

Subhagodaya Stuti is by none other than the great master of the  

greatest Adwaitin,Sri Sankara.But Masters of Samayachara seems  

to lesser when compared to that in external worship.It is in this I am  

specially interested. Most of the literature available seems to be  

either related to external worship or merely academic in nature  

which of no use for a serious sadhaka.  

Many a thanks to each revered scholar for a post in detail.
