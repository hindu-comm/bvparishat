b) IF the query here is to seek a publication which one desires to use for ‘ Self learning by interpreting the text in their choice way’, it could be dangerous ; surely considered an out of tradition mode. I am aware of Sri Bhaskararaya Makhins statement that any one who learns from his writings can call him as their Guru. But then one need to be sure that the practitioner understands the text in a unified way and practices diligently.

By saying this you pointed out a profound truth, which is ignored many a times by the readers of the different versions of the ancient texts as well as their commentaries. One has to be careful in assessing the different statements and interpretations before accepting these. No two persons would describe the same thing in exactly the same way, that is, in exactly the same language and style. Many a times two different persons would be saying the same thing in their texts but it may appear to different readers that these texts are trying to say different things and because of this there ensues a big dispute needlessly.
