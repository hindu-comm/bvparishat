Dear Scholars,

Namaste.

Was searching for a book called “ स्तुतिकुसुमाञ्जलिः” By Jagaddhara Bhat – hard copy / soft copy. It is supposed to be a classic text in Sanskrit containing stotras praising Lord Shiva.

Looking for the मूलं atleast, of course if vyakhya in Sanskrit or Hindi or English is available nothing like it.



If somebody is aware as to where this book would be available please help.



Regards
