Thanks to all who responded on and off the list. I bought Puṣpā Dīkṣita's book from India website of Samskrita Bharati at around one fourth the price on the US bookstore. In fact I bought all of Mātājī's books that were in stock (12 books for around INR 1200 + shipping). The list is below for the benefit of users.  
  
I will check and confirm what she lists as the यङ्लुगन्त form in वृ (वरणे) + यङ्लुक् + लङ् + म.पु. ए.व. - अवरीवरीः/अवरिवरीः or अवरीवारीः/अवरिवारीः. Muni Lavanya Suri lists the latter, but as one member mentioned offline, the former seems to be correct.
