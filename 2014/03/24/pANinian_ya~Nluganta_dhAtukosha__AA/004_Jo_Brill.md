Namo namaḥ  
  
As noted, the Dhāturūpakośa actually went into a sixth edition, completed in 1914, and reprinted in 1990 and 2005, ISBN 81-7030-202-1. If one wishes to have a physical book, it can readily be purchased on [abebooks.com](http://abebooks.com) .  
  
Also mentioned -- Dr. Dixit's book, ISBN 978 9381160459, which shows all verbal bases formed by and gives complete paradigms for laṭ, loṭ, laṅ, and vidhiliṅ. It can be found here:

Both are wonderful resources.  
  
Best wishes to all,  
Jo Brill
