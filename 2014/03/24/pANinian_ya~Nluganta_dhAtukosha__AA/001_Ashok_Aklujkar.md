Gandhi, Dharmaraja Narayen. Dhaatu-ruupa-ko;sa. Fifth rev. edn. by Chintamani Atmaram Shastri Kelkar and R. J. Kanade. Ratnagiri: Hari Dharmaraja Gandhi. 1908. A very useful register of verbal derivatives and the Paa.ninian rules which sanction them. Not easily available.Probably a 1990's reprint exists.
