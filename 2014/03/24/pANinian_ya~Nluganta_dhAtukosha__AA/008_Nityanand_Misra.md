Thanks, I have this book. Very good reference for शुद्ध धातु forms indeed, but Yaṅluganta forms are not listed (not even in लट् प्रपु एव) in this work.  
  
The best references for णिजन्त, सन्नन्त, यङन्त and यङलुगन्त would be separate books individually devoted to णिच्, सन्, यङ् and यङ्लुक् forms. This is what makes the Muni Lavanya Vijaya Suri's seven-volume धातुरत्नाकर the ideal reference - but for Hemachandra's system. I am yet to receive the six books in this area by Mataji Pushpa Dikshit (four-volume लकारसरणिः, णिजन्तकोषः, यङ्लुन्तकोषः, यङन्तकोषः नामधातुकोषश्च, सन्नन्तकोषः) but I am quite hopeful that these will be to the Paninian system what धातुरत्नाकर is to Hemachandra's system.
