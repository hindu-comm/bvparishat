Namaste

Is there any Dhātukośa, digital or printed edition, listing various Yaṅluganta root forms as per Pāṇinian grammar? I know of the Dhāturatnākaraḥ of Muni Lāvaṇya Vijaya Sūri in seven parts, one of which is dedicated to Yaṅluganta forms. However, Dhāturatnākaraḥ follows the grammar of Hemacandra and not Pāṇini, where there are subtle differences in markers, set of roots and meanings, et cetera.

Yaṅluganta forms can get very complicated with as many as six forms for the same meaning like चर्कर्ति/चरिकर्ति/चरीकर्ति/चर्करीति/चरिकरीति/चरीकरीति (Even Brhaddhāturūpāvalī does not list all these six). As the derivation is quite involved and time consuming, I would rather have a reference than try to derive forms like अवर्वरीः / अवरीवारीः / अवरिवारीः to ascertain if they are correct.
