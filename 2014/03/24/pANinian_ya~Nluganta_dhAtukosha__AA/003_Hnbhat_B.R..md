I don't think there is any complete list. But बृहद्धातुरूपावली of T K Krishnamacharya gives initial forms of all the verbs listed, wherever both apply. i.e. only first person singular only and complete forms for the first instance only. I think you have noticed already this.

  

I saw some 
बृहद्धातुकुसुमाकरः(टिप्पण्यादिविभूषित-ण्यन्त-सन्नन्त-यङन्त-यङ्लुङ्न्त-भावकर्म-कृदन्तरूपसहितसार्थसकलधातुरूपाणां सङ्ग्रहः)

सङ्ग्रहकारः सम्पादकश्च हरेकान्त मिश्रः

（व्रजजीवन प्राच्यभारती ग्रन्थमाला, 74）

And one Yangluganta Kosha or/and Yanganta kosha by Pushpa Dikshit, while searching for some Yangluganganta issue or form. But now I could not get the link. The book was priced 10$ on the webpage. You may contact herself for getting the details of the book. 

  

I could not search and locate the book right now.
