Dear Dr. Ashwin Sawant  
  

Sure you may buy them. But please search and DLI and archives well. you will get many editions of the books you need. If you are looking for hard copies Nag Publishers have published all the major Puranas and Upa Puranas. You also want to look in to Chowkambha publishers. Motilal Banarsidass have published English translations of all major Puranas 'Ancient Inian Tradition and Mythological Series' a little more than 100 volumes.  
  

The question is too generic, if you ask a book seller near the place you live they will be able to guide you. I hope this helps Thanks  

  

Regards
