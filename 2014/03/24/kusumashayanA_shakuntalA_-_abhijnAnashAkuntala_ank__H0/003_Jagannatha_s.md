Really excellent.

  

Dr. Vasant kumar Bhatt has shown how the third act of Abhi.Sha is altered because of stage artists. Retaining the unnecessary readings of exemplarsin the codices are sometimes caused by carelessness. A commonobservation is, no director follows strictly the text of any drama. He has to make some alterations according to the limitations/ scopes of stage. Sometimes even he wants to show his talent ! Dramas ascribed to Bhasa are famous examples for this. We have to see the other possibilities for interpolations: Some interpolations may be the works of educated readers of loose mentality.( Svapna-vasavadatta version we are now seeing may be the work of stage artists but it does not show any indecency. )

  

The question of interpolations may be seen even from the point of the audience. In translations of dramas like Abhijnana-Shakuntala, music pieces were added to recreate the audience.(For example, when Karnataka-Abhijnaana Shakuntala by Basavappashaastri was staged, some songs were added ) Whether some repetitions shown by Dr. Vasantakumar Bhatt are created because of this purpose, one has to see.

  

If any incident is very much prolonged, the audience may be getting bored. Are the short versions of AS result of this ?  

  

After reading article of Dr. Vasant Kumar Bhatt it appears to me that no so called critical edition of Abhi.Sha. makes serious effort to reconstruct the nearest version of autograph copy of Kalidasa.

  

To achieve this, we have to

1\. collate all the representative mss. of AS of various scripts,

2\. compare the readings with other works of Kalidasa,

3\. scrutinize all the commentaries available,

4\. examine the possibilities of causes for variants- whether they are caused by stage artists/ directors, or educated readers of loose mentality,

5\. meticulously compare with the classical translations of AS done in Indian languages(sometimes they may have utilized best readings)

6\. see the possibility of influence of literature of classical Indian languages in interpolations, sentences, expressions etc..(Dr. Bhatt has already shown how the Shuraseni Praakrta in Sharada versions of AS gradually changed into Maharaashtrii Praakrta in Maithili versions of AS. There is every possibility that even some Samskrta expressions may be influenced by non-Samskrta languages )

  

First one is already done to a great extent by Dr. Bhatt. Now, for other points, there shall be a committee of Manuscriptologists (of course, headed by Dr. Bhatt).
