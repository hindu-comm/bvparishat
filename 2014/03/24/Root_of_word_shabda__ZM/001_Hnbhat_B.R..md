SKD simply says the word can be derived from both the roots, the frist as given by Vacaspatya and also it could be derived from shap also from the Unadi list as explained in Nyasa.

  

शब्दशब्दः "शाशपिभ्यां ददनौ" (द।उ६।४८) इति दन्प्रत्ययान्तत्वान्नित्स्वर एणाद्युदात्तः।  

which svara could not be achieved by deriving it घञ् suffix as per Paninian rules. The same rule appears in दशपाद्युणादि4-97 शाशपिभ्यां ददनौ ॥.

  

There is no contradiction. According to Maitreya's Dhatupatha, there is "शब्द शब्दक्रियायाम्" root in चुरादि।

  

१०. २३९ शब्द शब्दक्रियायाम् \| उपसर्गादाविष्कारे च \|  

  

So it can be derived from both. But for Vedic accent, it has to be derived from Unadi suffix दन् from१. ११५५ शप आक्रोशे \|
