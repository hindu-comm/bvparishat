I can think of Epistemology Logic And Grammar in Indian Philosophical Analysis, Word and The World India's Contribution to The Study of Language and similar tiles on Language in our Tradition. I don't think Prof. Matilal has written any book by the title catussutree vyaakyaana  

I see no reason for posting on Matilal's books on the thread release of dhvanyaaloka and locana translation in kannada
