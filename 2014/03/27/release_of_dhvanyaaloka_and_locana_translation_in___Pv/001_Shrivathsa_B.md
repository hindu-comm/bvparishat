hariH OM,  
  
 thanks for the information sir.  
  
 shrii hegde's kannaDa translations of siddhAntabindu and bhagavadbhaktirasAyanam have been published by udaya prakAshana, Rajajinagar Bangalore. The translations are very faithful to the original.  
  
 I had approached shrii MA Hegde on phone for a clarification and found him to be very affable and friendly. Extremely grateful to him to have condescended to help an utter-dullard in the true spirit of our tradition (an arUkSha / alUkSha).  
  
 It is very delightful to see that the Sanskrit University is taking steps in the right direction in publishing books. I congratulate the university on this.  
  

 It is also my fervent request to the university's padAdhikAris to bring pressure upon the government to finish the printing of the R^igveda bhAShya kannaDa translation of the Chamarajendra Granthamala series. Till last count, they had published 30 out of 36 (31-34 contain the aitareya brAhmaNa and nirukta parts). It may also be fitting if the university takes the rights of publication of / or independently prints these books.  

  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
