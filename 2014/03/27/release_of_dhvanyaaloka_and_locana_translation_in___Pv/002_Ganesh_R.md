Dear Srivatsa,  
  

You said it ! Prof. M A Hegade is a very fine scholar and a friendly person too. His translastion of Prof. Mati Lal's work and independent works like the alaMkaara-tattva and catussutree vyaakyaana are very commendable. Even his writing on the concepts of language in our tradition is very lucid and informative. His role in YakShagaana, the traditional theare of katakana both as a scholar and as a performer are commendable. I am happy to say that he is known to me as a good friend since two decades. It is so heartening to note that he is treading the great path of his illustrious mentor Dr. K Krishnamoorthy in the chosen field of mirroring the masterly Sanskrit Originals in to Kannada. I also commend the noble act of Karnataka Sanskrit University for such publications. It is better to recollect that last year the university had published the Kannada version of VyaktivivEka of mahima Bhatta done by Prof H V Nagaraja Rao another great scholar and a greater human being.
