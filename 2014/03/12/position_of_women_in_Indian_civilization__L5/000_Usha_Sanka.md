Namaste

Here is something which would help understand certain general issues that keep creating problems in the minds of people regarding women.

Good way of looking at same age old issues -under new light of understanding.

Though only some areas of whole issues are touched, that's enough for answering others in same lines.

More thinking in lines as this needed to address other Indian issues as well.

Thankyou

Regards-

"Madhu Kishwar talks about position of women in Indian civilization. She shares various examples of prominent Indian saints, queens and scholars. She tells about influence of these feminine role models on millions of Indian women. She also talks about goddess worship in India and its influence on raising position as well as respect of women in India. She claims that freedom & diversity in society stems from polytheism; worship of many gods and goddesses."
