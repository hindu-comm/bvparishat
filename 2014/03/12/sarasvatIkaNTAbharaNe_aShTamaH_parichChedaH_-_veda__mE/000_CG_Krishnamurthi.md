    EMENDATIONS ESSENTIAL TO THE VEDIC GRAMMAR OF BHOJADEVA 
    (Paper submitted to the A.I.O.C., 35th Session, Hardwar, 1990)

    N. M. Kansara

    The Vedic Grammar of Bhojadeva, the celebrated Bhoja the Great of Dhara 
    (9th century A.D.) comprises the Eighth Adhyaya of his 
    magnum opus known as the Sarasvati-kanthabharana (Vyakarana). 
    It  consists of about 822 aphorisms in Sanskrit, distributed into four Paadas, 
    each having 174, 155, 261 and 232 surras, respectively. It is perhaps the 
    oldest extant, and hence the first attempt at (presenting a wellknit 
    compact Vedic Grammar in Sanskrit by bringing the Paninian tradition 
    upto date. As is well known, the celebrated Panini interspersed his Vedic 
    siitras into the body of his Laukikasutras in his Astadhyayi, topicwise 
    locating them mostly at the end of the respective prakarana, irrespective 
    of its being discussed in different padas and different adhyayas. Bhojadeva 
    has tried his best to preserve as much of the original wording of the 
    Paninian Sutras as possible. But when the situation demanded, he has 
    not hesitated to bring the topic upto date by altering the wording, by 
    adding to the original, by splitting into two or more, of the Paninian 
    sutras, in a bid to incorporate the Varttikas of Katyayana, discussion in 
    the Mahabhasya of Pataftjali, as also comments in the Kaiika of Vamana- 
    Jayaditya, over and above the Ghanapatha and the Phit-Sutras of Santanava. 
    The process of modifications in the Paninian sutras pertaining to the 
    Vedic Grammar can thus be fruitfully traced to all these wellknown 
    sources of Bhojadeva's Vedic Grammar. This exercise, at first attempted 
    by Dr. Chintamani, in tracing the sources of Bhojadeva's Vedic Sutras 
    to their originals in the Paninian tradition, further helps us to get over 
    the limitations of the manuscriptal evidence in arriving at the correct text 
    of Bhojadeva's Vedic Grammar. 

    The Critical Text of the Sarasvati-kanthabharana-vyakarana of Bhoja- 
    deva was published by the University of Madras in 1937. And the text 
    along with the Hrdaya-harini Vyakhya has been published from time to 
    time, in parts, upto the end of the Sixth Adhyaya only. The Mss. for 
    the portion pertaining to the Seventh Adhyaya is preserved in the Adyar 
    Sanskrit Manuscripts Library, the Director of which institution informed 
    me that they do not have the Ms. pertaining to the Eighth Adhyaya 
    with the commentary. Perhaps the commentator has left the work 
    incomplete. The comparision of the so far published work with commentary 
    and that in the Critical Edition of Dr. T. R. Chintamani, referred, to above, 
    shows considerable variance in readings of the sutras of the text of the 
    work of Bhojadeva. This holds good for the Eighth Adhyaya, too. On. the 
    basis of my comparative study of the work, I have come across occasions 
    on which the scribes of the respective Mss., utilised by Dr. Chintamani for 
    the Critical Text, seem to have committed obvious mistakes in misreading 
    their Adarsas. And further, certain failings seem to belong to the author 
    of the work, rather than to the scribes of the Mss. concerned. In order 
    to restore the text to its purity and authenticity, I have ventured to suggest 
    here some of the major emendations that are highly essential, leaving the 
    task of revising the whole of the text of the Eighth Adhyaya for future, 
    in the interest of preparing the Gujarati Edition of the work.
