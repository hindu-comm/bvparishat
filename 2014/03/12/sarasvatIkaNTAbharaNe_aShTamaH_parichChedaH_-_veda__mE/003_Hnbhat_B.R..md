Dear Vedia,

  

Do you mean the scholar worked on the Eighth Chapter of Sarasvati Kanthabharana, for his Ph.D? If so, the title/topic of the Thesis and if published, the details of publications also may be informed. As per the article appended in the first message itself, the Commentary of Dandanatha, is not available for the portion of Eighth Chapter and seems to be incomplete according to the Director of Adyar Library.

Has the scholar obtained the commentary for the Eighth Chapter which was not available for publication when the researcher mentioned in the first post studied it for presenting the paper in 1990?
