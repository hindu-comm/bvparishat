I believe the प्रकृतिप्रत्ययविभाग shown in वाचस्पत्यम् is correct. In fact, the same derivation (सर्वधातु + ठक्) is shown by V S Apte in the संस्कृत-हिन्दी-कोश (MLBD 2007, ISBN 9788120820975, page 1101).

[http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bsSZ27z5fSYC&pg=PA1115&dq=सार्वधातुक](http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bsSZ27z5fSYC&pg=PA1115&dq=सार्वधातुक)


The chance of a प्रमाद by both the author of वाचस्पत्य (Taranatha Tarkavachaspati) and Apte on the same word is very small. Furthermore, even if it may not be entirely clear which सूत्र or वार्तिक Taranatha Tarkavachaspati had in mind, the stalwart at least deserves a benefit of doubt.

The suffix ठक् from सर्वधातु is very much Paninian.

(1) It could come from 5-1-19 आर्हादगोपुच्छसंख्यापरिमाणाट्ठक् in any of the meanings specified between 5-1-20 असमासे निष्कादिभ्यः and 5-1-71 यज्ञर्त्विग्भ्यां घखञौ (आर्हीय प्रकरण). There are hints in commentaries that सर्वधातु + ठक् is possible in the आर्हीय प्रकरण. Refer काशिका on 5-1-41 सर्वभूमिपृथिवीभ्यामणञौ, which says अण् and अञ् are ठकोऽपवादौ. Now if सर्वभूमि is mentioned only once in अष्टाध्यायी, from where comes the possibility of सर्वभूमि + ठक् or पृथिवी + ठक् so that 5-1-41 specifies अपवाद for both. The answer lies in 5-1-19. 5-1-19 specifies ठक् from nominal stems in the meanings mentioned between 5-1-19 and 5-1-71. 5-1-41 specifies अण् and अञ् from सर्वभूमि and पृथिवी. By 1-4-2 विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यम्, 5-1-41 overrules 5-1-19 and hence अण् and अञ् are ठकोऽपवादौ. Even बालमनोरमा on 5-1-41 says ठञोऽपवादऽण् (this is also correct since अण् by 5-1-41 is an अपवाद of ठक् by 5-1-19, which is itself an अपवाद of ठञ् by 5-1-18, so 5-1-41 is also an अपवाद of 5-1-18. A subset of a subset is also a subset.).

(2) Another possibility is that सर्वधातु + ठक् comes in any of the senses in the scope of 4-4-1 प्राग्वहतेष्ठक् (the entire fourth पाद of fourth chapter)

(3) A third possibility is it could come from 4-3-43 तत्र भवः, with the वैषयिक सप्तमी.

There may be other possibilities too.

Now which of these senses and possibility the great Taranatha Tarkavachaspati meant by व्याप्नोति is unclear, as he has not cited any Sutra. But to me an unclear or incomplete explanation is not the reason to conclude it is incorrect. We may need to look at other words like सार्वभौतिक which he has explained in a similar manner.

Lastly, सर्वधातु and अर्धधातु have been explained as “full verbal base” (भव-) and “partial verbal base” (भू-) by several authors, including the late S D Joshi.
