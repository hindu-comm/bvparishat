Namaste.

The Sanskrit word given in Student's Sanskrit English Dictionary by V.S.Apte,p.364,MLBD,1988 is Praphulta(v.l.for Praphulla) and Praphulti.

So,the spelling Praphulu is definitely a misprint-of course,by oversight.Some times,such mistakes/misprints do occur.So,the word Praphulu does not seem to exist.
