Dear Sir,

  

Hearty congratulations on this endeavor! Hope, under your scholarly guidance, the demand for the number of seats may grow. Four years back, we did a minor project supported by the UPE, UoH. Have any companies showed interest in the course and prospective pass-outs? All the best for the students.

  

With regards,

Dr. Prasad
