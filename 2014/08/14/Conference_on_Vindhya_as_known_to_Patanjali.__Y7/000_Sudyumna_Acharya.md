  We are glad to inform all well-wishers of Indology that a conference is scheduled to be held on 26-27th August 2014 at Veda Vani Vitan, Oriental Research Institute, Satna (M.P.). The conference aims to discuss the topic 'The Development of Vindhya as reflected in the works of Patanjali'. Broadly speaking, the topic includes all information relating to Vindhya, Malwa and Vidarbha supplied explicitly or implicitly by the works of Patanjali. All such information is comparable to contemporary poetic works.

  This prestigious conference will cater to the pre-requisite of the U.G.C.for Ph.D. degree and Career Advance Scheme. So the candidates should take interest in active participation. A certificate to this effect will be given away to the participants. An amount of Rs. 500/= only will be paid by them as registration fee. For detailed information, please go through our [website--vedavanivitan.com](http://website--vedavanivitan.com) and bharhutartgallery.com--Sudyumna Acharya -Director.
