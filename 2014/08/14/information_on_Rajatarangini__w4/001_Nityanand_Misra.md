Have you referred any editions of Rajatarangini? There are a few available online including one with an English Translation by Ranjit Sitaram Pandit (1935 Indian Press Limited, Allahabad, DLI code 99999990074697) and one with a Hindi translation by Pandeya Ramtej Shastri (1960: Pandit Pustakalaya, Kashi, DLI code 99999990244930). Check if any of them (or other verions on DLI) has an index at the end or a genealogical chart.
