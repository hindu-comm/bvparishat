Even though many members have given their suggestions almost all the online and offline dictionaries they know, our honorable member is silent on what he really wants?

Just wanted to have a evaluation of his intention, seeing his silence on his question so far.

  

1\. A Dicrtionary like Monier Williams or Apte's one gives meaning in Sanskrit - English Dictionary, in English. And also give basic
derivation for those who know the derivational process they have applied in their Dictionary. It is not clear that whether he wants the meanings also in English in a dictionary he is looking for and information of comparative philology in English in it.

  

2\. Opinion on "Vyutpatti" is generally divided among the grammarians and Nirukta School. Paninian grammarians consider for the purpose of etymological operations, the substantive words by Unadi-sUtra-s as अव्युत्पन्न- प्रातिपदिक-s and only the कृदन्त suffixes prescribed by Panini in his अष्टाध्यायी as व्युत्पन्न-s. "१,१२ः     तत्र नामान्याख्यातजानि इति शाकटायनो नैरुक्तसमयश्च।  
१,१२ः     न सर्वाणि इति गार्ग्यो वैयाकरणानां चैके।"

  

So all the words in Sanskrit may not be given व्युत्पत्ति in a dictionary. I have noted many words are missing in the online dictionaries often, either by typo error or otherwise. Mostly technical words could be missing and loan words in Astronomy and Astrology could not be given though they could be given as the meaning a technical term in Astronomy or Astrology. The same with Tantric and technical literature, which is so vast. For example, a question was raised what is meaning of चोरकूप and the commentators differ to which part it refers (it is a part of the body to be touched in Anganyasa). This compound word could not be found in the listed dictionaries I use which are listed here. We know the meaning of चोर and कूप and what is wanted is the relation between the two words and what the word denotes and how it denotes a part of the body. This is the case of many compounds found in literature. Even Monier William gives remark for many entries of "doubtful origin" since he could not agree with the available etymology. So "Vyutpatti" for all the words is a wide requirement, on the assumption that all the words are Vyutpanna's whereas it is not so accepted by all scholars.

  

Vigrahavakya is for compound words and generally for कृत् suffixes and some times उणादि suffixes, which is explained as भावे घञ्, or so and need not cover the whole range of compound words in the voluminous voumes of Sanskrit Literature (Both General and Technical). This is the same position of all the dictionary compilers. They add entries to the class of literature to which they have easy access and do not cover many other class of literature, looking for new words and technical words. This is true of all the dictionaries listed here. So vigrahavakya for all the कृद्वृत्तिः, एकशेषः, सनाद्यन्तवृत्तिः, समासवृत्तिः, तद्धितवृत्तिः available in the Sanskrit Literature is a great expectation to be covered in a single dictionary. The below is the entry in शब्दकल्पद्रुमः ---

  

  

घोटः

  

\[L=11881\] \[p= 2-397\] घोटः, पुं, स्त्री, (घोटते परिवर्त्तते इति । घुट परि-

वर्त्तने + पचाद्यच् ।) घोटकः । इति राज-

निर्घण्टः ॥

  

which gives the व्युत्पत्तिः, and कृद्वृत्तिः, (note it is not called विग्रहवाक्य) and does not give the meaning of the word either in Sanskrit or English (which could not be given in a Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary) like Sanskrit-English Dictionary gives as bilingual dictionary meanings and derivations in English. The same with many entries. For some they give synonyms like Sanskrit Kosha-s. But again the same problem with the meaning even if given in Sanskrit. One should be able to understand the meaning from the given words.

  

This is my view on the requirements he suggested in his post and etc. also. He has to specify what he expects more than available in the dictionaries listed in this thread. And many other unlisted Kosha-s Vijayanti, Vishvakosha, Halayudha, Trikandashesha etc. are just list the words in some order and relation. These do not give any information than synonyms and their multiple meanings used in different genders. These are specialized. Of these, Trikandashesha and Halayudha have got some sort of commentary. like Amarashesha. Halayudha has got an Indexed list of words like a dictionary, which gives some sort of information on the derivation and meaning in short in Sanskrit. This is the first entry:

  

  

![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/9cce545d6be8e583/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

  

This is in Sanskrit in Alphabetical order of the Halayudha Kosha, referring to the text of Halayudha Kosha and supplementing with additional meanings and derivations in Sanskrit only. But this is limited to the words listed in Halayudha Kosha only. The meanings are extended and collected from differeet sources.
