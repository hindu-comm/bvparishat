If the moderators opine that it was questioned by Sri Ramachander, only to get a negative conclusion that there is no such a single dictionary, I agree with Ajit ji.

  

If it was questioned by him to get such help from more than one source my earlier mail has some considerable validity. VS Apte's Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Vacaspatyam, Halayudha kosha and Amarakosa with Kshirasvamin's Commentary are surely helpful. Once the meanings of words are known with the help of such dictionaries knowing the vigraha of the words with the basic knowledge of Samskrita Vyakarana is not a difficult task.

For the last Three and half decades I have been using these dictionaries for enriching my knowledge. I found them all very much useful for all practical purposes.

Besides these I often take the help of other dictionaries like Nanaratharnava Sankshepa, Medinikosa, Vaijayanti kosa, Sarva Sabda Sambodhini etc.,

Svasti,
