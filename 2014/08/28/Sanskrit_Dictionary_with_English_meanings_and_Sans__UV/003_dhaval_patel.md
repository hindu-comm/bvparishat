Best idea to suit your need would be - download the stardict files from <http://www.aupasana.com/stardict>.  

Use Monier Williams / Apte for Sanskrit - English purpose and Sabdakalpadruma / vAcaspatyam for sanskrit.  

I use it that ways. It gives data from all the dictionaries for the selected work.
