"I am on look out for a Dictionary like Monier Williams' or Apte's  
which also gives definitions in sanskrit (vyutpatti,vigraha vakya  
etc.) Please let me know if there is any work of this kind available  
in the market."  
  

He wants such a dictionary Giving English meaning, Vyutpatti,  
vigrahavakya, etc. I don't know whether he wants meaning in English,  
or not. If not, there are Vacaspatya, and Kalpadruma dictionaries,  
which give vyutpatti, in Sanskrit. Your Vigraha Kosha gives only  
Vigrahavakya and may not the Vyutpatti he wants. So all in one in a  
Dictionary one has to compile. Others softwares Stardic, Colordic,  
etc. are available, but may not always give Vigrahavakya for all the  
compound words in Sanskrit literature. But only few selected ones as  
collected in Vigrahakosha, which gives meaning in Marathi. Others  
Sanskrit - English dictionaries also give meaning in English and  
etymology as they use to do. But only one has to learn to understand  
the explanations. They do not give Vigrahavakya or Vyutpatti in  
Sanskrit.  
  
Hope good luck, such a dictionary will soon be compiled.
