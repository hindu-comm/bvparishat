Generally the commentaries are not translated into English, unless they are of important Technical Literature. Even in the field of Grammar, only the text of Mahabhashya is translated and not the commentaries.

  

I had added, if they had published with the translation (of the commentary in Sanskrit, the original being in Bengali). In general literature in Sanskrit, only Texts are translated and not the commentaries are translated in general. In Dharmashastra, we have seen some commentaries, which themselves are authorities, for the purpose of decision, like Mitakshara commentary on Yajnavalkya, Kullukabhatta on Manusmriti, are translated or at least followed in the translation.

  

Hope the commentary on Haribhaktivilasa was translated with the translation of the Sanskrit commentary in English. If they were published, they should have been made available in their website or with some sellers, or available on Google Search.
