I agree with Ajitji that Sabdabodhamimamsa was written by Mm. N. S. Ramanuja Tatacarya. Taranatha Tarkavacaspati (1812-1885) was a great Bengali scholar of Sanskrit, and the father of Panditakulapati Jivananda Vidyasagara. Taranatha's principal works are Sabdartharatnam (on the philosophy of Sanskrit gramamar), a Sarala tika on the Siddhantakaumudi, a tika on the Sankhyatattvakaumudi, etc. But Taranatha never wrote any work called Sabdabodhamimamsa, nor did he author any commentary on the Vyutpattivada.
