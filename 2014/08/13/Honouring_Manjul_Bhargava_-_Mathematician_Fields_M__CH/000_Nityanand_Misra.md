Dear list members  
  
It is great to know that the polymath Manjul Bhargava, just been awarded the Fields Medal for 2014, is a lover of Sanskrit, and learned Sanskrit from his grandfather, the late Purushottamlal Bhargava of Rajasthan.  
  
While many recent article on the net speak about his study of Sanskrit texts, a good one is here - <http://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20140812-the-musical-magical-number-theorist/>  
  
A biography of his grandfather is here - <http://plbhargava-conference.org/bio.htm>. P L Bhargava is also mentioned in the Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars.  
  
An article by Manjul Bhargava on his grandfather's contribution to Indology and Sanskrit is here - <http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol36/vol36-art02_Manjul-Bhargava.pdf>  
  
I request professors, vice-chancellors, members of Sanskrit Commission and other influential members of the list to make efforts for Sanskrit Universities to honour and invite him and confer honorary doctorates in Sanskrit on him. Hopefully he will inspire many young students towards interdisciplinary studies involving Sanskrit and Mathematics.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
