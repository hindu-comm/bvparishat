This was a news item from 1997, when Manjul Bhargava graduated from Harvard. He said then, "I would really like to open some sort of chain of national math and science *gurukulas* (schools) in India. There is so much mathematical and science talent in India, but unfortunately, such talent is not fostered and attended to as it is in the United States."



Yes, Indian universities could honor the scholar with honorary doctorates, but wouldn't it be more meaningful to work with the Fields Medal winnerandcreate such gurukulas and find ways to include Sanskrit learning as part of their curriculum too? The Indian education system could do with a lot more of "catching them young," so to speak. Education in the modern disciplines of math or science and an education in traditional Indic areas of learning are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they could finely complement each other.



Thereis another award called the Nevanlinna Prize, givenfor mathematics that specifically impacts information technology.The 2014 recipient isSubhash Khot, an IIT Mumbai and Priincetonalum, originally from Ichalkaranji, who also studied Sanskrit as a student. And intrue bhAratIyatradition, he handsomely acknowledges his guru, a high school teacher, one Sri Vaman Gogate. <http://theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v009a028/about.html>. I just thought I'd share this piece of information as well here, because it doesn't get the same amout of press as the Fields Medal and its winners.



Best regards,
