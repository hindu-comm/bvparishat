\> India as known to PaaNini" is an English book published by Lucknow University in 1953. The book is based on a series of lectures delivered by VS Agarval under the Radha Kumuda Mukherji endowment lectures. ... Some old libraries may be holding copies of the book.  
  
In the context of this helpful note, searchers for the specified book should bear in mind that the author's last name may also appear as Agrawala ("VS" stands for "Vaasudeva ;Sara.na") and the scholar in whose memory the lecture series was established may also be specified with "Radha Kumud Mookerji.  
  
Agrawala/Agravaala/Agraval/Agarval was working on the theme roughly from 1945. Some parts of the book were earlier published as articles. The particulars are given on pp. 16-17 of Cardona, George. 1976. Panini: a Survey of Research. The Hague-Paris: Mouton. A photographic reprint edition of this was published in 1997 by Motilal Banarsidass. A supplement covering the research from 1976 to 1999 appeared from Motilal Banarsidass under the title \_Recent Research in Paninian Studies\_ in 1999.  
  
Agrawala's 1953 book should not be used without its well-informed and extensive review written by Prof. T. Venkatacharya published in the Journal of the University of Gauhati in 1959, vol. 10, pp. 85-112. Agrawala accepted many of Venkatacharya's corrections in the second, revised and enlarged edition of \_India as Known to Panini\_ (Varanasi: Prithvi Prakashan, 1963)but the latter scholar's work still retains its value.  
  
I have a photocopy of Venkatacharya's review but that is not ideal for scanning (and will take much time to locate in the present transitional stage of my personal library). If any member of this list has access to the specified JUG pages and he/she posts a scan, it will indeed be a significant service rendered to scholarly community.  
  
Members of this list should generally avoid using Hindi translations of Western language works for their research if they have a reading knowledge of the original language of publication.
