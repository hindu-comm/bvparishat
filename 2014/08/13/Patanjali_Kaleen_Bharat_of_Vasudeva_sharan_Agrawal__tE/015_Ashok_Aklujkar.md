I have seen the following two books on the theme of this thread (I hope the intended words will be known in some of the entries below despite
the distorted diacritics):

Agnihotr^, Prabhu-dayåla. 1963. Pata\~jali-kål^na bhårata. Pa†anå \[= Patna\]: Bihåra-RåΩ†rabhåΩå-pariΩad.

Puri, Baij Nath. 1957. India in the Time of Pata\~jali. Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. Second edn from the same publisher: 1968.

(A third edn of the latter is said to have been published, but I have not been able to access it. If it is like the second edn, then I do not regret the lack of access. Even in India's crop of historians who write about ancient India without being able to consult their sources in the original languages, Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, etc., Puri cuts a relatively sorry figure.)

A third book on the same theme was mentioned as follows:

महर्षि पतंजलि और तत्कालीन भारत - चंद्रमणि विद्यालंकार (१९१४,प्रथम आवृत्ति).

I have been unable to locate this publication. If the year of its publication has been specified correctly, it is unlikely to be an item that is still under copyright. Can anyone procure a scan of it for me? Or the name of the city in which it was published and the name of the publisher?

  

It may perhaps be helpful to the person who started the 'Patanjali Kaleen Bharat' thread to know that I have written three articles of historical nature on Pata;njali (as distinct from my articles on the Mahaabhaa.sya text). They can be found in the2008 book: Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir. Co-edited with Mr. Mrinal Kaul. New Delhi: D.K. Printworld. The titles my articles are: (a)"Pata\~jali's MahåbhåΩya as a key to happy Kashmir." (b) Gonard^ya, Go∫ikå-putra, Pata\~jali and Gonand^ya."(c)"Pata\~jali: a Kashmirian."
