Ïndia as known to PaaNini" is an English book published by Lucknow University in 1953. The book is based on a series of lectures delivered by VS Agarval under the Radha Kumuda Mukherji endowment lectures.

The book is very informative, particularly about the status of women-teachers. Some old libraries may be holding copies of the book.
