hariH OM,  
  

 Vasudev sharan agarwal? i saw a book called pANini kAliina bhaaratavarSha under the following barcode:  
99999990277060  

 when i search for agarwal and patanjali kalin bharat, i don't get any relevant results (with some of them pointing to the book by prabhudayal). Hence, please confirm which book you are searching for.  

  

 For the earlier book (prabhudayal agnihotri, patanjali kaliina bhaarat), there seem to be two other copies available on dli:  
99999990235821  
99999990066364  
  

svasti,  

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  

 shrivathsa.
