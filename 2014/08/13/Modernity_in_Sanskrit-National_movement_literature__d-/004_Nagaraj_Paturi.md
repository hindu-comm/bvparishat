"The Jaya Jaya Jaya song's author had a convenience grammar-wise. Apart from the Jayas the remaining words are all samāsas. So he could commit errors only in the vocative endings. He did. The wrong shortenings in the strīlingaśabdas probablyweregiven justification through api maaṣam maśam kuryāt argument".



-No. I was wrong. The guess I made about how he could have defended was wrong. I think as Dr. Nityanand Mishraji pointed out, there is no defence to his expressions unless it is looked at as Sanskritized Telugu expression. I do not know if the poet called it Sanskrit or only the people assumed it to be Sanskrit. I might have been carried away by the popular impression.



But the point remains that the attempts to respond through Sanskrit, if there are any, can be considered as one of many ways in which the Sanskrit literary tradition responded to the modern times.



I am waiting for examples from other languageareas which I guess should be there.
