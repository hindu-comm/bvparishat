Respected scholars,



One of the bases scholars like prof. Sheldon Pollock show for their thesis of "Death of Sanskrit" is the lack of response in Sanskrit literature to modernity.



Somehow, responses like the one by Swami Dayananda Saraswathi , the founder of Arya Samaj and a very big number of his followers, through Sanskrit, missed the attention of such scholars.



Another very important aspect that did not receive his attention is the significantly big amount of literature that sprung up in the medium of Sanskrit, as part of the Indian independence movement. The lyric Vande Mataram by Sri Bamkim Chandra Chatopadhyaya is the most shining example. There could be many such songs, or other literary works in your own language expressed in Sanskrit.



I am sharing a highly popular song that reverberated and has been reverberating during and after the independence movement in the Telugu - speaking areas. It was composed one of the finest romanic poets of the Telugu language Sri Devulapalli Krishna Shastri , in Sanskrit.



The lyric is ;



जय जय जय प्रियभारत जनयित्री दिव्य धात्रि

जय जय शत सहस्र नरनारी हृदय नेत्रि

1.जयजय सश्यामल सुश्यामचलच्चेलांचल

जय वसंत कुसुमलता चलित ललित चूर्णकुंतल \|\| जय जय जय \|\|

2. जय मदीय हृदयाशय लाक्षारुण पदयुगला

जय दिशांत गतशकुंत दिव्यगान परितोषण \|\| जय जय जय \|\|

3. जयगायक वैतालिक गळ विशाल पथ विहरण

जय मदीय मधुर गेय चुंबित सुंदर चरणा \|\| जय जय जय \|\|

There are many audio renderings available online for this. I am sharing one of those ;

I request you all pour in info on this aspect of response to modernity in Sanskrit literature on this auspicious occasion of our Independence Day.

धन्योस्मि

नागराजः
