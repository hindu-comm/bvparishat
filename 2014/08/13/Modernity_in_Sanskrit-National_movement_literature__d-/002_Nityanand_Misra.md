Vande Mataram by Bankim Chandra is in highly Sanskritized Bengali rather than Sanskrit. Same for the two songs you have here - they appear to be highly Sanskritized Prakrit rather than pure Sanskrit - for example nominative singular and vocative singular usages are mixed, genders are mixed, cases of adjective and noun do not match, etc - there would be quite a few grammatical errors if we assume they are in Sanskrit. This is not to take anything from the greatness of Vande Mataram or the two songs.  
  
There is a lot of nationalist literature in Sanskrit. One of my Guru's work from his Pūrvāśrama days is Ājādacandraśekharacaritam. This was composed in 1974 by Gurudeva on the request of one of my Paramagurus Paṇḍita Dvijendranātha Miśra Nirguṇa, who was the then head of department of Sāhitya (Literature) at the Sampurnanada Sanskrit University. A copy of the work is available from here (*caveat lector*: the publication is unedited and has several scribal/typographic errors).

Some verses from the work -  
  
\[When Azad as a 14-year old is flogged 15 times in a jail for participating in the Non-cooperation movement\]  
यदा यदा वेत्रलताप्रहारं तस्मिन् सकोपोऽनुचरश्चकार ।  
तदा तदा सिंहरवेण वीरो जगर्ज बालो जय भारतेति ॥ १-१३१ ॥  
As and when the enraged orderly \[of the prison\] flogged him (Azad) with the whip \[fifteen times\], the brave boy roared aloud in the voice like that of a lion - *O* **Bhārata, victory to you**!  
  
  
\[When Azad met other revolutionaries\]  
स राजगुर्वादिनिजानुगामिनः सभक्तसिंहान् बटुकेश्वरादिकान् ।  
उपेत्य तान् रामदशास्यसंयुगे प्रवीरकर्मान् हनुमानिवाऽबभौ ॥ २-५ ॥  
On approaching his followers led by Shivram Rajguru, with the likes of Batukeshwar Dutt and accompanied by Bhagat Singh, he (Azad) shone forth as Hanumān did on approaching the brave Vānaras in the battle of Rāma and Rāvaṇa.  
  
  
\[When Azad killed himself fighting the colonial soldiers at Azad Park (Alfred Park), Allahabad\]  
एवं विधाय कदनं कलुषात्मकानां निर्मथ्य गौरजलधिं सुभटः प्रदोषे ।  
लीलां समाप्य सगुणां निजरौद्रभावं त्यक्त्वा शशाम शिववत्प्रलयावसाने ॥ २-१५० ॥  
Thus, after performing the destruction of those with a sinful character, after churning the ocean of the colonial rulers, after concluding his play with qualities, after discarding his fiery disposition, the brave warrior became peaceful in \[that\] evening like Śiva at the end of the dissolution of the universe.
