Continuing with Sri Bhakti Vinoda Thakur,



'the transregional spread of the Sankrit works', which, Prof. Pollockthinks discontinuedlater to 1800 went to the degree of transnational with him.



From the book of Shukavak N Dasa, we learn that



Unabated by the criticism, Bhaktivinoda saw *Krishna-samhita* as an adequate presentation of the Gaudiya Vaisnava thought even to a Western mind, and in 1880 sent copies of the book to leading intellectuals of Europe and America. Soon Bhaktivinoda received a favorable response from an eminent Sanskrit scholar in London Reinhold Rost, and a courteous acknowledgement of the gift from Ralph Waldo Emerson. This became the very first foray of Caitanya's theology into the Western world.



In fact, even Arya Samaj too went transnational and its Sanskrit works spread transnationally as result.



Through the transnational interest in Sri Ramana Maharshi's thought, even the works ofSri Kavyakantha Vasishtha Ganapatimuni received transnational attention.



A similar interest in Sri Aurobindo introduced Sri Kapali Shastri to the readers across the nations.



The pre-modern trans-regional spreadgrowing intoa transnational spread is a natural and expectedconsequence of modern social history. But the point is that such modern developments with regard to Sanskrit literature got overlooked during the theorization of "Death of Sanskrit"
