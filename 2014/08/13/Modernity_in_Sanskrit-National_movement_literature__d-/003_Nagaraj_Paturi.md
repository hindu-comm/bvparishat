Thanks for sharing PūyaJagadguru Acharyaji's book. One of my teachers categorized svātantrya vīra rasa under the broad category of viira rasa. āchāryaji's book is a rasavatkāvya with such a new rasa as angi rasa. Is that not a proof of a new imagination and creativity in modern Sanskrit literature?



You may be right about grammatical errors.



But the issue is 'response to modernity'. Both the songs were composedright in the midst of the heat of the freedom movement.



The Jaya Jaya Jaya song's author had a convenience grammar-wise. Apart from the Jayas the remaining words are all samāsas. So he could commit errors only in the vocative endings. He did. The wrong shortenings in the strīlingaśabdas probablyweregiven justification through api maaṣam maśam kuryāt argument.



After the Independence Day, I shall initiate info collection for the remaining responses of modernity, for which I already have a list.



Thanks again,



Regards,



Nagaraj
