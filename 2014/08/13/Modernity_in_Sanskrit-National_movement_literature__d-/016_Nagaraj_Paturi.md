Another epoch-making personality through whom The capacity of Sanskrit thought to make history' expressed itself was the Gaudiya Vaishnava Guru Sri Bhakti Vinoda Thakur . His



Sri Krishna Samhita (1878) written originally in Sanskrit created history during the late 19th Century.



I found the title of the book written on him by Shukavak N Dasa , in fact, interesting from the point of view of our present discussion.



The book is called



 "Hindu Encounter with Modernity: Kedarnatha Datta Bhakti Vinoda, Vaishnava Theologian" ( Los Angeles, CA: Sanskrit Religions Institute, ISBN1-889756-30-X,)



He says in this book that



In defense of the tenets of Vaisnavism, Bhaktivinoda's *Krishna-samhita* employed the same rational tools of its opponents, complete with contemporary archeological and historical data and theological thought, to establish Krishna's pastimes as transcendent (*aprakrita*) manifestations of morality.





Ravi M Gupta says,



In particular, he applied what he termed *adhunika-vada* ("contemporary thinking") – his methodology of correlating the phenomenal discourse of the scripture with the observable reality.



I request members of the list to add more information that establishes that by 1800, the capacity of Sanskrit thought to make history had notvanished.



Please add books that were original Sanskrit works written between 1800- 1947 .
