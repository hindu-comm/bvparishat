Where in Mumbai jurisdiction? Came to India?



My impression of your scholarship is thatit is more than aPhD. I wanted to express myveneration for you in some form. I can not be as 'professional' as to call you just by your first name.



AadaraNeeya seems to be better, AadaraNeeya Nityanandji.



Please allow me.



Anyway, please add some more national movement Sanskrit literature if you know any.



I will contact you offline to know more about you so I do not get corrected anymore in addressing you.



regards,



Nagaraj
