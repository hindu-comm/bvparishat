Rewa Prasad Dwivedi



His major works are the two Sanskrit epic poems Sitacaritam and Svatantryasambhavam. The first maha kavya (epic poem), Uttara Sita-charitam, composed from 1956 to 1968, is based on theRamayana and deals with the later life of Sita, but is recast to contemporary times and deals with Indian polity and patriotism. His second epic, Svatantrya-sambhavam, which won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1991, portrays the Indian national freedom movement, from the time of Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi to events of post-Independence India. His other Sanskrit works includePramatah (1988, a collection of poems on the atomic age), Sri Rewa Bhadrapitham (1988, verses in praise of the river Rewa, Narmada), Shatapatram (1987, poems about poetry), and Yuthika (a four-act play)
