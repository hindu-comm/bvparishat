True, the rhytm of the song is 12 + 12 instants in each line so one cannot change the endings of the lines to another gender or case without violating metre. The poem mixes masculine vocative, feminine nominative and feminine vocative forms. While one can still defend the mixed use of feminine nominative and feminine vocative, there is no way to justify the use of masculine vocative, unless one assumes that the deity Bharata Mata is both masculine and feminine at the same time a la Ardhanarisvara form.

  

In addition

  

जय जय शत सहस्र नरनारी हृदय नेत्रि

  

seems to have something (another जय perhaps?) missing as it is two Matras too short.

  

Plus as it is typed, the Samasas are all written separately.

  

PS: I have neither a PhD or an MBBS degree, so please dont call me a doctor. No legal disclaimer today as now in jurisdiction of Mumbai and it will take me time to study the laws.
