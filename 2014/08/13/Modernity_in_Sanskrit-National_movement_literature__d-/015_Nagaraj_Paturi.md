Let me continue my discussion on response to modernity in Sanskrit.



Such a fine and meticulous analyst that Prof. Sheldon Pollock is, he does not miss to note that

> The world of Sanskrit is broad and deep, and it would be unsurprising > to find different domains following different historical rhythms and > requiring different measures of vitality.

I shall proceed to deal with different domains to show how data of certain domains of Sanskrit literaturebelonging to the 19th Centurymissed to get the attention of Prof. Pollock,during the writing of this essay.



He does observe that





If better theories or histories or metaphors are unavailable for grasping the broad Wirkungsgeschichte of a cultural form like Sanskrit,

this is all the more the case in trying to distinguish among its constituent parts, and their effects and histories. Consider the history of

the Sanskrit knowledge-systems. The two centuries before European colonialism decisively established itself in the subcontinent

around 1750 constitute one of the most innovative epochs of Sanskrit systematic thought (in language analysis, logic, hermeneutics,

moral-legal philosophy, and the rest). Thinkers produced new formulations of old problems, in entirely new discursive idioms, in what

were often new scholarly genres employing often a new historicist framework; some even called themselves (or, more often, their enemies) “the new” scholars (*navya*).

But at the same time, he proceeds toopine that



Concurrently with the spread of European power, however, this dynamism diminished so much that by 1800, the capacity of Sanskrit thought to make history had vanished. The production of moral-legal texts, for example, which was so extensive throughout the seventeenth century, ceased entirely, and in core disciplines like hermeneutics or literary theory no significant scholarship—that is, significant in the eyes of the tradition itself—was again to be written. How to account for this momentous rupture is a complex question, and one of great importance for history— the history of science, colonialism, modernity—and for social theory.



That there was a 19th Century movement of Arya Samaj founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati which right from the books such as Rigvedadi Bhashya Bhumika (1878), participated in this very process of making history through the medium of Sanskrit is not getting reflected in this observation. 'The capacity of Sanskrit thought to make history' expressed itself through Swami Dayananda Saraswati, his own Sanskrit works like Rigvedadi Bhashya Bhumika . His leadership created a huge continuance of Sanskrit learning, speaking and writing among social sections from which it did not happen in the earlier Indianhistory. This phenomenon of Arya Samaj, indeed is one of great importance for history andis a moment that needs to be accounted for in terms of the same aspects mentioned by Prof. Pollock, i.e. the history of science, colonialism, modernity—and social theory.



One of the most remarkable achievements ofArya Samaj is 'the transregional spread of the Sankrit works', which, Prof. Pollockthinks discontinuedlater to 1800. As a consequence of Arya Samaj being a transregional movement involving concerted efforts on the part of its participants to spread its ideas across the regions, this achievement was possible.



Otherimportant contributions that continued such a novel approachduring the early twentieth century arefrom scholars such as Kavyakantha Vashishtha Ganapatimuni.

has books such as Visvamimamsa, Dharmanushasanam, Devatamimamsa etc.all of which reflect a novel approach to the topics.(Muni composed a Sanskrit novel called Purnaa too. This is incomplete.)



A contemporary of Kavyakantha Vashishtha Ganapatimuni is Sri Kapali Shastri. His Rig Veda Bhashya Siddhanjana is another Sanskrit work in continuation of the Veda Bhashya traditionin the style of his times.



Before I leave it to the other members on the list, let me cite the greatest example of the continuation of theSanskrit works of the Prasthana traya Bhashya kind by none other than Jagadguru Ramabhadracharya and many other Sanskrit works of him to which I was introduced recently through the posts of aadaraNiya Nityanandaji.



I request members of the list to add more information that establishes that by 1800, the capacity of Sanskrit thought to make history had notvanished.
