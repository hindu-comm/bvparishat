I was surprised when I saw the eleventh entry in this year's list  
  
<http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=108794>  
  
For I had known for the last five years that the award was already conferred on Gurudeva in 2003 by the then President of India A P J Abdul Kalam. Refer the seventh entry in the 2003 list -  
<http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/awardees2003.pdf>  
  
Even Wikimedia shows it  
<http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JagadguruRamabhadracharya004.jpg>  
  
And Wikipedia knows it  
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_honors_received_by_Rambhadracharya#Awards>  
  
But Government of India's Ministry of HRD does not know!  
  
I called up Gurudeva's Āśrama in Chitrakoot just now and Ācarya Candra Dutta Suvedī confirmed that it is an error on part of the Government of India to announce the same award a second time. I am hearing unconfirmed accounts that the Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthana in New Delhi proposed Gurudeva's name - obviously without checking list of past awardees, and Lo and Behold the MHRD awarded without checking its own records!!  
  
Ācarya Suvedī also said that the Rashtrapati Bhavana has been informed by the Āśrama of this error and the award will not be given again to Gurudeva this year. A new corrected list may be out soon.  
  
I hope no other names are repeated else we would have A Comedy of Errors. (Or is it a tragedy?)
