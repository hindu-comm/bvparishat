The word "communal" can be an adjective form of either commune - (means) a group of people living together and sharing possessions and responsibilities or community - (means) a group of people with shared origins and interests. This is according to Collins Dictionary. In both the instances these words refer to social groups or communities.

Hence sAmAjika Varga pramathanam or sAmAjika Varga himsa may be more appropriate than sAmpradayika himasa.
