I just learned, through news coverage of a recent Indian parliamentary debate, that the routinely used Hindi term for "communal violence" is "sAmpradAyik hiMsA".  
  
I, for one, think the term is utterly inappropriate as a translation for communal violence. It seems to do a lot of hiMsA to the word sampradAya. It makes it look as if riotous violence is sanctioned by one or more sampradAya-s, instead of describing it as a negative outcome of the social interaction between exclusive groups/communities. I would like to elicit other opinions on this forum.  
  
Left unquestioned, I feel that the term sAmpradAyik hiMsA, used with such a connotation, will do long term damage to the very idea of sampradAya in Indian culture.  
  
Best regards,
