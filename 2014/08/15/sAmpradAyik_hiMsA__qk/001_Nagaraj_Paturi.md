sAmpradAyik is a Hinditerm coined during modern period as a translation for the English term 'communal'.



Interestingly the word 'communal' is originally and internationally connected to the word 'community'. A dictionary definition for this as follows:



communal



1.  

    

    

    **1**.

    

    

    

    

    shared by all members of a community; for common use.

    

    

    "a communal bathroom and kitchen"

    

    

    [TABLE]

    

    

    [TABLE]

    

    

    

    -   

        

        

        involving the sharing of work and property.

        

        

        "communal living"

        

        

        

    -   

        

        

        relating to or done by a community.

        

        

        "communal pride in impressive local buildings"

        

        

        

    

    

    

    

2.  

    

    

    **2**.

    

    

    

    

    (of conflict) between different communities, especially those having
    different religions or ethnic origins.

    

    

    "violent communal riots"

    

    

    

    

    

Origin



early 19th century (in the sense ‘relating to a commune, especially the Paris Commune’): from French, from late Latin *communalis*, from *communis* (see common).



Even in India, during British rule, the word was part of the word 'communal constituencies' where it was related to community only .



Somehow, during post-independence India, the word is being used exclusively in the sense of

(of conflict) between different communities having different religions only.



The Hindi coinage seems to be based on this new usage limiting the word to religion related context. The word samprdAy is being used in Hindi as one of the words for English 'religion'



For Hindi speakers, the word sampradAy does not denote tradition as it does, say, in Telugu. There is another word paramparA for tradition in contemporary Hindi.



'traditional' is pAramparik in contemporary Hindi.



Experts in the history of contemporary Hindi coinages may be able to throw more light.
