In course of the Swami Pranavananda Memorial Lecture at the Vidyasagar Hall of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta on 12^(th) September, 2012, Mahāmahopādhyāya Vaiyākaraņakeśarī Pt. Manudeva Bhattacharya of Varanasi made the following observations on the terms, sampradāya and sāmpradāyika:

Dāya, as mentioned in the classical Sanskrit law-texts, means such paternal property as reduces on division and sharing. In contradistinction to this, stands sampradāya. In Sanskrit, upasargas play a very role in the determination of the meaning of a word. They often alter the meaning of the original word. For example, the word ‘gacchati’ means ‘he goes’, but when this same word ‘gacchati’ follows the prefix ‘ā’ and becomes ‘āgacchati’, it conveys a diametrically opposite meaning in the form of ‘He comes’. So sampradāya, according to the learned doctor’s derivation, is “samyak prakarşaśca yo dāyaḥ sa sampradāyaḥ”, i.e. highest wealth of knowledge, which waxes day by day, but never wanes. In this respect, Pt. Bhattacharya also quoted the following Sanskrit adage: "apūrvah ko’pi kośo’yam vidyate tava bhārati /vyāyato vŗddhimāyāti kşayamāyāti sañcayāt//" (Tr. Incredible is your wealth, O Goddess of learning, which increases on getting spent and decreases on being reserved). He added: “vyāye kŗte vardhata eva nityam vidyādhanam sarvadhanapradhānam” (Tr. If the wealth of knowledge, the best among treasures, is spent \[i.e., distributed and shared\] it certainly increases all the time. And one who is in possession of such a wealth of knowledge is verily a sāmpradāyika.
