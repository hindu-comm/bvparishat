Dear list members

  

Does anybody have contact details ofĀcārya Rāmayatna Śukla (b. 1932), a disciple ofAbhinavapāṇini Ācārya Rāmaprasāda Tripāṭḥī and the former HOD of Vyākaraṇa at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University (in the late 1990s)? The Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars (2012) does not have his contact details. He seems to have been active in conferences till 2008, but Google search does not show much recent activity - he would be 82 years now.  

  

I request members having his contact to please share it with me by off this list by writing to me personally.
