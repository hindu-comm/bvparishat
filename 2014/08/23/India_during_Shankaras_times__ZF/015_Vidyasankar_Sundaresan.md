Afew clarifications:



1\. Sri Kota Venkatachalam did indeed talk about the date of Shankara, as part of his writings on the history of Kashmir. A simple Google search shows a lot of material online from which one can research further.



2\. Sri Kota Venkatachalamlived till1959. In 1957, he became a saMnyAsin and the head ofthe "abhinava virUpAksha maTha," which is not the maTha located in Hampi, Karnataka. I have not been able to find his new name after he became a maThAdhipati. His research on historical issues was conducted long before this event, and he filled the role only for the last two years of his life. So, there is no reason to think that he was privy to any more inside information than any other well informedpundit of his times.



3\. The abhinava virUpAksha maTha was established during the 1760s, somewhere in AndhradeSa,as a branch of the Hampi virUpAksha maTha. Perhapsother vidvAns on this forum fromAndhraknow more details about it.As such, the abhinava virUpAksha maTha is more than a century younger in its origin than the pushpagiri maTha that we discussed on this forum a few weeks ago. The reported lineage of the main virUpAksha pITha at Hampi says thatits Acharya from 1924 to 1976 was named Sri Saccidananda Abhinava Sankara Bharati.Please see [*http://hampividyaranyamath.org/index.php/jagadgurus*](http://hampividyaranyamath.org/index.php/jagadgurus).



4\. I don't see why one should doubt the origin of the virUpAksha maTha in Hampi during the times ofSrI vidyAraNya in the 14th century. Of course, anyone could doubt anything, without doing the necessary research,but that does not lead to sound scholarship.
