Dear scholars,

I would like to supplement what Dr.Nagaraj has written.  

I have an additional take on this. It is the Sanskrit departments who have to take primary interest in the history of the "Text+ author+ society+ culture+ country" that they study. While there are significant exceptions, I find generally Sanskrit scholars and students are indifferent to historical criticism, connections, concepts, information, and evolution of Sanskritic intellectual tradition over centuries. They usually limit themselves to the text, commentaries, and grammar. at best they read a book on "History of sanskrit literature". I am not criticizing but appeal to BVP scholars to encourage historical approach including study of inscriptions and not leave such intellectual effort to foreign universities.

  

regards

  

RN Iyengar
