1\. One way of handling this topic is to fixacertain period of Indian history as the time of ādi śankarāchārya and look forhow India was philosophically and otherwise during those times.



2\. Presently, the most agreed time period as the time ofādiśankarāchārya is 8th Century. Thus books and other material on this period of Indian history should be useful.



3\. One interesting aspect of the Indian history during this period is that many mutually independent diverse developments in the areas related to religion took place at this juncture. For example, historians place the arrival of Parsis (zorashtrians) in India at this time only. Historians place the some of the most epoch-making āl̥vārs and nāyanārs and their contribution to the development of Bhakti traditions also at this time only. These dates arefixed on the basis of material other than those belonging to thereligious traditions considered to have existed parallel to them. In fact, religious traditions considered to have existed parallel to each other during this time,do not point to each other in their material such as songs, books etc.



4\. If ādi śankara's date is accepted as this period only, references in his books to the other religious and philosophical traditions can be taken as pointers to the other traditions of the time. Interestingly, the traditions mentioned above are not referred to byśankara nor dothe material of the other traditions mentioned above refer tośankara.This can not rule out their mutually parallel existence. Everydocument of a given period of history can not be expected to refer to every other aspect of history of the periodunderstood by us through other sources.



Numerous namaskaras.
