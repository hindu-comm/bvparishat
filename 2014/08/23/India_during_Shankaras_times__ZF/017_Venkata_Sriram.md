Namaste,

  

The abhinava virupaksha peeta existed in Guntur which was a upa-peeta to Hampi Virupaksha Peeta. The then peethadhipati of abhinava virupaksha peeta Shri.Chidananda Nrisimha Bharati Mahaswamigal initiated Sri.Kota Venkatachalam Garu into turiya ashrama and gave the yogapatta Shri.Advayananda Sankara Bharati in 1957. Thus, Shri.Advayananda Sankara Bharati (Shri.K.V Garu in purva ashrama) continued as peetadhipati for this for 2 years and then merges the peetha with parent peetha of Hampi.
 After handing over the peetha and it's responsibilities, becomes an avadhuta and spends his rest of his life in tapasya and brahma chintana.

  

regs,

sriram
