1\. Well said by aadaraNIya Ajitji. History of Religions and History of Philosophical Thought require multidisciplinary approach.



2\. Not only that. These are the study areas where the sources are not limited to Sanskrit sources. Sources in all the regional languages intheir ancient, medieval and modern versions, inPrakrits , in Persian, in Dekkhani, and inUrdu need to be studied. So Sanskrit departments alone can not be made responsible for the research in the areas.



3\. But it is true that Sanskrit departments can find a very good source of excitement in these two study areas. But that excitement can get multiplied with the openness to the study of other language sources and approaches of various contemporary disciplines.



4\. Controversies need not deter researchers from study. Controversies are to be taken as given in any study particularly in Social Sciences and Humanities. But aadaraNIya Ajitji has a point here. Sometimes these controversies are not taken easily in their academic sportive spirit. They are taken toan unhealthy social clash level. Particularly History of Religions is an area which has potential for such consequences. But let us remember that no society in the world is free from such consequences. It is a tight rope walk for academicians in any country.



5. It is also true that some of the 'modern'academicians are indulging machoistically in anunwarrantedsentiment-hurting, out of their tendency to show off their superiorityof 'modern' 'scientific'/'rationalist' 'jnānōdaya' over all the remaining people (who in their perspective, are pitiably)'not blessedwith' such a 'jnānōdaya'. Such academicians should pick up a leaf or two from the books of the majority of cultural anthropologists who always try to see their role only as that ofan interpreter of the tradition-bearer's point of view and measure their success always in terms of the approval from the insiders of the culture of their study.



6. Scholars with such a healthy respect for the insider's perspective, with a multidisciplinary and multi-linguistic approachcan do a healthy and fruitful History of Religions and History of Philosophical Thought of India. More Indians getting involved in this work is the need of the hour.
