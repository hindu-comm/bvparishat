Here comes the singular importance of a detailed Research on the  
"Religious and Philosophical History of India" at different periods.  
Though there are a few good studies on the Nyaya system and the  
Navya-Nyaya philosophies, as far as I know, there is no such detailed  
study on various other schools of Philosophy and religious traditions  
from the earliest period upto the modern age.  
Such a study, taking into account both the textual as well as the  
epigraphical records, will go a long way in bringing out clearly the  
development and contributions of various schools of philosophy and the  
religious traditions at a particular epoch.
