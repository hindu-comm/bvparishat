I agree historical approach including study of inscriptions is necessary but in the context of Shankaras date can scholars ever agree upon it will remain controversial for ever as it is mixed with religious sentiments. Same will be the case with many Indian dates, if the religious elements beliefs and mythical elements are removed probably a date can be arrived at. Astronomical evidences which many scholars propose also have the same draw back it more subjective than objective. So epigraphy and inscriptions are the best way out where available as a conclusive proofs provided one accurately interprets them and there is no ambiguity. Hence a mixture of all the possible methods could be a way out including relative chronology. In short dates in Indian history require Multi disciplinary efforts by a board scholars who are open and objective.
