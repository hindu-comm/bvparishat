Dear Nagaraj Garu,



In this regard, we need to bring the research publications of Prof.Kota Venkatachalam Garu, the great historian and indologist of Andhra Pradesh, into limelight. Prof.KV is not only a great historian but a great upAsaka who later ascended as Sankaracharya of Hampi Virupaksha Peeta in Hampi.



In the similar lines, Prof.S.K.Ramachandra Rao's contribution to Indian History should be remembered by the scholars.



The problem is that anything from an indian is ignored but the same findings if brought forth by a foreigner, is being applauded.



regs,

sriram
