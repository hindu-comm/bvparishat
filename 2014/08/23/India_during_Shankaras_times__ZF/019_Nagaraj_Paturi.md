Sri Kota Venkatachalam did indeed talk about the date of Shankara, as part of his writings on the history of Kashmir. A simple Google search shows a lot of material online from which one can research further.



His research on historical issues was conducted long before this event (of 1957)



So, there is no reason to think that he was privy to any more inside information than any other well informedpundit of his times.



--------That is exactly what I wanted to say.
