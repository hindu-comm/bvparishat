I completely agree with Dr. Ganesan.



UGC and private Universities/Institutes focussing on Social Sciences and Humanities should take this up seriously. Neither history departments nor philosophy departments are giving importance to this. Unfortunately Religious Studies /History of Religions departments are yet to make a beginning in this country. As a result even the history of religions of India is left in the hands of the departments of History of Religions outside India.



Socio-economic histories, histories of art and architecture, histories of literature etc.have all been taken up. ButReligious and Philosophical History of India has taken the back seat.



This appears to be the time when something can be made in this regard.
