Sorry Dr. Ganesan.



I did not notice that that message of aadaraNIya Suniljiwas posted as part of this thread.



It looks that his message was focussed on SriKota Venkatachalamji brought into discussion by Sri Venkat Sri Ram.



aadaraNIya Sunilji,if you are interested in Sri Kota venkatachalamji's study on Date of S'ankara, I can tell you about that in a separate thread.



Regards,,



Nagaraj
