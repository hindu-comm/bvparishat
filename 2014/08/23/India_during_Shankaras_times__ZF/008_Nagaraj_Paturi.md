Dear Sriram,



Sri Kota Venkatachalam garu is a tall figure of nationalist historiography which stood against colonialist historiography during colonial and early post-colonial times.



But the issue is notgeneral history. History of Religions and History of Philosophical Thought need more meticulous history of ideas from inside the sources.



This needsa contemporary approach different from the approach of those times.



Thanks for reminding the great scholars of those times.



Regards,



Nagaraj
