This is interesting in view of the fact that the Virupaksha math was originally established by Swami Vidyaranya, who later on became the Mathadhipati of the Shringeri math. He could have had more inside information than most of the other historians about the date of Shankara, yet probably due to religious / sentimental reasons Kota Venkatachelam did not take up the date of shankara.
