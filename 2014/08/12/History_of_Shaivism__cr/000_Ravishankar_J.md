Dear Sri Prof. Ganesanji and other Respected Scholars.  
I have a query on the thread about Shaivite inscriptions, sculptures etc. which you have been quoting in a thread on Pushpagiri Matha.  
One scholar Sri. R Krishnan is working on a book on Subrahmanya aka Murugan worship told me about an inscription belonging to 1st AD  
about a Subrahmanya temple near Abbotabad, Pakistan. It says the the name of the place as Kumara Sthan surprisingly.  
There is also a Somaskanda Vigraha which i saw in Gwalior museum around the same date.  
I find there is a correlation.  
It seems to be a misconception that Agama practices are Dravidian and originated from south.  
However the truth seems to be otherwise.  
Please throw some light on the worship of Shiva from Afghan-Assam & Kashmir to Kanyakumari with references.  
Pranams & Thank You
