Thank You Sunilji and Ganesanji.  

I am not sure if Shashti is known to Kalidasa.II?!  

Even ancient Tamil literature extant now is silent on that.  

How Raghuvamsa is known by Raghu while he is not the founder or progenitor?  

Please give the information about inscriptions or literary sources to prove the antiquity or Shaivism and its institutions.  

In your earlier thread you were claiming that Sankarite institutions were established on the model of Shaivite Mutts.  

Please show evidences.  
  
  

  

Regards  
Ravishankar
