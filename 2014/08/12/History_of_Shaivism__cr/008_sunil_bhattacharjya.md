Shiva worship has been there from the very ancient times, going upto about 9,000 BP (before present). Even in the Ramayana Lord Ram tells Bharata to worship Lord Shiva daily. In the Mahabharata times, about 5,000 years ago, Lord Krishna was initiated to the Pasupata system by his guru and the Bhagavad Gita has a number of verses common with the Pasupata Agama. In the original Bhagavad Gita there is a verse, where Sanjaya says that the Bhagavad Gita is the essence of both the Agama and Nigama.  
  
The Shankara mathas need not be identified with only the worship of Lord Shiva. The Dwarka Math does give importance to worship of Lord Vishnu and so also does the Govardhana math. Shankara established the Panchayatana worship, where Lord Vishnu is also one of the prime deities. In Mohamudgaram Shri Shankara talks only of Lord Vishnu and not of Lord Shaiva. Thus the Shankara mathas are balanced and they accept that all the deities are one and the same. "shivasya hrdayam vishnu, visnoccha hrdayam shiva", so says the Vedanta.
