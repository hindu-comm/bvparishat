Dear friends,  
  
In this context of Kumara -worship we can also look at the relevance of Kalidasa-II's Kumarasambhavam'. Firstly Kalidasa-II gives his own time as the 1st century BCE in his Jyotirvidabharanam, where he also mentions his three kavyas, which includes the Kumarasambhavam and Raghuvamsham. The Nepali scholars claim the Kalidasa -II to be from Nepal, as Kalidasa-II wrote the Kumarasambhavam and the name "Kumara" is the name most commonly used for Kartikeya, the son of Pasupatinath, in Nepal alone and nowhere else. Further the Kumara's birthday "Shithi" is observed with great pomp in Nepal, from the ancient times and Kalidasa should have been familiar with that. This festival is called "Shithinakha". From this it appears that Kumara-woship was there in Nepal even before the 1st century BCE.
