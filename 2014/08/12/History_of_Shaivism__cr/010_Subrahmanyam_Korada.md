नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

The History of Saivism can be traced to **कृष्णयजुर्वेद and शुक्लयजुर्वेद -**-

  

**कृष्णयजुर्वेद --**

  

**    Rudrapraśasti / Rudram**  

  This is the fifth Prapāṭhaka of fourth Kāṇḍa. Sicne the word "namaḥ" is repeatedly heard it is also called *Namakam* or *Śrīrudranamakam*. Another portion, i.e. seventh Prapāṭhaka wherein the words "ca me" repeat is called "Camakam". Both these are very popular and outside a Yāga, is used to perform "Rudrābhiṣekam" (bathing Śiva) and is considered a device to thwart the ill-effects of Śani (planet Saturn) detected from the horoscope.

  

**शुक्लयजुर्वेद --**

In sixteenth Adhyaya there are Mantras called 'शतरुद्रियम् ’ शतरुद्रीयम्’ (’शतरुद्राद्घ च’ - वार्तिकम्-चातुरर्थिकाः - ’शतं रुद्राः देवता अस्य मन्त्रस्य शतरुद्रियम् ; चाच्छः - शतरुद्रीयम्) , in which we find hundred names of रुद्र , ie शिव.

Two important names , ie ईशान and महादेव , are not there in
शतरुद्रियम्।

This is being considered as an उपनिषत् and origin of शैवमतम्।

The first six Mantras of thirty fourth Adhyaya are called शिवसंकल्पोपनिषत् ।

Each one of them ends up with the मकुटम्(crown) - तन्मे मनःशिवसंकल्पमस्तु The शतकवाङ्मयम् in Telugu, with the same मकुटम् thruout , might have originated from here.
