There is this early reference from KAlidAsa where in RaghuvaMsha, 5: 36 he compares the newly born prince Aja to KumAra:  
  
She gave birth to the young child who was comparable to KumAra, the God (kumArakalpa).  
From this it seems that it was very common in the early periods to compare new born child to KumAra, symbolising beauty and valour in youth.  
   

   brāhme muhūrte kila tasya devī *kumārakalpaṃ* suṣuve kumāram /  
   ataḥ pitā brahmaṇa eva nāmnā tam ātmajanmānam ajaṃ cakāra //



   ब्राह्मे मुहूर्ते किल तस्य देवी *कुमारकल्पं* सुषुवे कुमारम् ।

   अतः पिता ब्रह्मण एव नाम्ना तम् आत्मजन्मानम् अजं चकार ॥

  
  
And we have the much well known expression, jagataH pitarau , जगतः पितरौ from KAlidAsa, which confirms that from very early periods Siva and PArvatI are considered as the Universal Parents of all beings.  
The Somaskanda image of the 1st century CE of the Gwalior Museum which you mention is the visual representation of this trio: The Universal Father, Universal Mother and the Beautiful Ideal Child which is something unique to this trio only.
