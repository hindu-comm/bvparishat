Namo namah.

While Prof Korada has explained the point very much in detail, I would also like to point out that I found the following three books useful to understand subtle aspects of Paspashahnika and VyakaranaMahabhasya.

1. श्रीमन्महर्षिपतञ्जलिविनिर्मितं पाणिनीयव्याकरण महाभाष्यम्‌ (with the commentary MahabhasyaPradeepa of Kaiyata Upadhyaya and the super commentary BhasyaPradeepodyota of Nagesa Bhatta (Edited by BhargavaShastri Bhikaji Joshi) (Republished by Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratishthan. Original Publishers – Nirnayasagara Press, Mumbai, Sake 1872)

2. Patanjali's Vyakarana-Mahabhasya - Paspasahnika by S D Joshi & J A F Rooderbergen (Published by the University of Pune, 1986)

3. श्रीमद्भगवत्पतञ्जलिविरचित व्याकरणमहाभाष्य - मूळ आणि मराठी भाषांतर (महामहोपाध्याय वासुदेवशास्त्री अभ्यंकर) (संस्कृत विद्या परिसंस्था, पुणे, Sake 1860)

The first one is in Sanskrit, the second in English and the third is in Marathi.

The first one is available on the net and volumes 2-6 of the third one are available on the net.

M.M. VasudevaShastri Abhyankar (father of Prof. K. V. Abhyankar) has written an elaborate translation (with explanation) in the third book. Those who can understand Marathi, may have a look at that book. I found it easier to understand as a beginner. Translating Sanskrit into any Indian language is much easier and smoother than translating into English.

In the process of interpretation of the varttika “सिद्धे शब्दार्थसम्बन्धे”, Patanjali Muni is exploring different meanings of the words akrti and dravya and with reference to each set of meanings of those two words, he tries to interpret the varttika. 

After having presented interpretations of the Varttika from different points of view, finally of course he says, “Forget all that!! यन्नित्यं तं पदार्थं मत्वैष विग्रहः क्रियते सिद्धे शब्देऽर्थे सम्बन्धे चेति॥” Whether Akrti is nitya or dravya is nitya, let us take whatever is nitya to be the meaning of a pada (padArtha) and go ahead with the analysis/separation/splitting of the compound to mean “when sabda, artha & sambandha are siddha i.e. nitya”. 

This has been discussed quite well in AbhyankarShastri’s translation.

The last time I checked, all except the first volume (out of the total seven) were available on the internet.

The first volume contains the Paspashahnika. However they have also separately published only a booklet on the Paspashahnika for the benefit of the students of Sanskrit who have to study Paspashahnika in the college.

But if you are a serious student of Paniniya Vyakarana and can understand Marathi well, then having all the seven volumes will prove to be a great asset. The seventh volume has been written independently by Prof Kashinath Abhyankar (the son) and is an excellent Grantha related to Mahabhashya in particular and Paniniya Vyakarana in general. It’s very informative. It is similar to Paspashahnika (विहंगावलोकन) but covers wider aspects of Paniniya Vyakarana from modern (today’s) point of view. It gives introduction/preface, short history of the Paniniya Vyakarana and discusses many basic but subtle aspects of Paniniya Vyakarana.
