Dear Siddhartha Krishnaji,



1\. Your thread initiating message has आश्रमेषु राजगृहेषु धनिकगृहेषु वा in it. You mentioned साम्प्रतम् also. Which साम्प्रतम्rājagr̥has are you talking about? Of khatriyas or of brāhmanas? How many brāhmaṇa rājagr̥hasare remaining today?There are rājagr̥hasof non-brāhmana non-kśatriya communities also. There are both vegetarian and non-vegetarian rājagr̥has. Did you see aBrahmin cook employed in a non-vegetarian rājagr̥ha ?Same questions apply to dhanikagr̥has also.

Then comes the question of आश्रमेषु.Most of theāśramas are vegetarian.



2\. Even within the vegetarian rājagr̥has and dhanikagr̥has ,पाचकेन ब्राह्मणेनैव is asweeping generalization. There are numerous vegetarianrājagr̥has and dhanikagr̥haswhere we do not find Brahmin cooks.



There are many vegetarianāśramas too where a non-Brahmin cook is employed.



3\. Brahmin cooks do work in certaināśramas, rājagr̥has and dhanikagr̥has. Cooking has not been listed in the paricharyā activities ofśūdras in any smrti.



4\. Brahmins todaydo engage themselves in many activities that are listed among paricharyā activitieslisted insmr̥tis forśūdras. People speaking from the point of view that Brahmins have beenplaced at the top of thesocial hierarchy discuss this phenomenon under downward vertical social mobility born out of povertyand other social and economic conditions.



5\. If the statistics of all the cook positions in India and Indian origin households abroadare taken, the percentage of Brahmin cookscan be seen to be very small.



If you are talking of sāmpratam lōka , smr̥tis are of little help.



Regards,



Nagaraj
