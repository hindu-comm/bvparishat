Hare Krishna.  
Dear Sirs,  
  
To clear the confusion seeing very varied and conflicting  
insrtructions of sastras and practices in different traditions one  
must know the basic principle behind all these rituals mentioned in  
different smritis; the principle behind brahminism and brahmanas, the  
reason behind calling someone so. To throw some light on this, I would  
request you all to read the book under the following link:  
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzsxG6GI7ySkcnpBZS0wbkg0amc/edit?usp=sharing>  
This book/essay is written by His Divine Grace bhaktisiddhAnta  
sarasvatI ThAkura.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das

\> Vīraśaivism and is not to be construed to be a documentation of any real
