"many other Bhakti traditions" here refers only to those Bhakti traditions which have thefeature described here in them.



For example, Dattaavadhūta bhakti traditionstoo have this feature. 



I know many Vaishnava traditions which have this feature. Bhakta Ramadasa's tradition (A Dāsa tradition )in South India is an example.



Even SriVaishnava tradition, at least theoretically this feature exists. Annamāchārya openly proclaims this in many of his lyrics. "Being a Haribhakta is enough to be able to overcome dōṣas if any."There are many other such textual/narrative references of SriVaishnava tradition,which prove that this feature of Vishnu bhakti believed to be nullifying all dōṣasis part of SriVaishnava tradition too.Hence any Sri Vaishnavamaintaining ritual distance from another Sri Vaishnava is obviously violatingsuch articulations of their tradition.



A vaishnava's relation with a non-vaishnava is adifferentissue. In fact even this changed in course of history.

1.  do not allow a non-VaishNava brahmin, say, a smArta brahmin inside
    his kitchen; 2.  do not take food from non-VaishNava brahmin; 3.  do not interdine with non-VaishNava brahmin.

hardly continues today.



My father , a smarta Brahmin studied with a Sri Vaishnava guru Sriman Samudrala Lakshmanacharyualavaru , went into his kitchen, interdined with him, and gave food to him which he accepted. I interdined with Sri Vaishnava Brahmins on many occasions ofDhanurmasa rituals and so on inside temples.



I keep telling people that statements such as " Don't accept food from a Bhavi "etc. found in some Vīraśaiva books is just an expression of the intense acrimonious attitude that prevailed during the early days of Vīraśaivism and is not to be construed to be a documentation of any real practice.



The Sri Vaishnavas described by you, are examples of those who in many religious traditions implement portions of their old bookswhich are such expressions of the heat ofearly history of their traditioneven today.



Anyway, let me repeat



"many other Bhakti traditions" here refers only to those Bhakti traditions which have thefeature described here in them.

Nagaraj
