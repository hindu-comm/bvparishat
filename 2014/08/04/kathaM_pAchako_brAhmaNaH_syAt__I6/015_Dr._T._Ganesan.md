Leaving aside the topic of scriptural sanction of allowing or disallowing a SUdra inside a brahmins kitchen, I would like to state that even among Brahmins in the south Indian context, many of the orthodox SriivaiShNava brahmins  

1.  do not allow a non-VaishNava brahmin, say, a smArta brahmin inside
    his kitchen; 2.  do not take food from non-VaishNava brahmin; 3.  do not interdine with non-VaishNava brahmin.

And, what is more, even among themselves, these SriivaiShNava brahmins maintain the practice of "toTTu cAppiTum URavu" (in Tamil)--which means, even among their relatives, they maintain only certain of them from whom they can take cooked food and not from others.  
Then, I was told by my friend that among the Tenkalai AcArya-s even now, when they meet together for some occasion such as a household function or marriage, each AcArya takes food inside an improvised enclosure with curtains around so that he is not seen by the other AcArya.  

How come so much restrictions even among Brahmins ?  
Now, can one find any scriptural/smRti sanction for these practices
!!!! ?????  

The observation *. . . many other Bhakti traditions do not recognize these dōṣas affecting coked objects and many other such dōṣasbased on the dictum prevalent in those traditions that Bhakti of their respectivetraditions has the power to nullify the the dōṣas if any arising from whatever sources in which such beliefsvest the dōṣa and as such even dvijas of these traditions do not have recognize these dōṣas affecting coked objects and many other such dōṣas* as found below does not at all hold good here, even though, the VaishNava tradition and SrIvaiShnava one in particular, is known to accord the highest position to Bhakti .
