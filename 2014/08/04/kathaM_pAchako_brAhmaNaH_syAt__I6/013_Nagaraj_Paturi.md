"Then from where came into existence this practice of not allowing them today into the kitchen?

Therefore, I’m interested in any clear scriptural statement which may either clearly state that cooking is the job of a Shudra or, otherwise, that Shudras are not allowed into the kitchen. This is the reason I started this thread."



------------Since this is the central focus /objective of the thread initiator, let me limit myself to this issue here.



1. If the persons not allowing theśūdras into their kitchens areciting scriptures as the basis of their action, then it would be a valid research topic to seewhich scriptures, in which words of them have reached these prohibitingpersons and are making them not to allow śūdras into the kitchen.



2. It has to be studied if the kitchens whereśūdras are not allowedare pure cooking places or include a pujā-place, pūjā-room or any other such unit which has objects of yantra(s), sālagrāma(s) or other similar objects around which beliefs ofdōṣas of sparśa, dr̥ṣṭi etc. are held by people.



3. For instance,general observation is thatśūdras are *not disallowed* into the kitchen ofan unoccupied house. Evenwhen the house is occupied permissions into the kitchen vary depending on whether the kitchen includes a pujā-place, pūjā-room or any other such unit which has objects of yantra(s), sālagrāma(s) or other similar objects around which beliefs ofdōṣas of sparśa, dr̥ṣṭi etc. are held by people.



4. If the issue is not entry into the kitchen, but allowing śūdra to cook in one'sown kitchen or any other part of the houseor accepting the food cooked by a śūdra irrespective of where it is cooked, then it has to be discussed on the basis of beliefsof the dōṣas of sparśa, dr̥ṣṭietc.around cooked objects.





5.Vīraśaiva and many other Bhakti traditions do not recognize these dōṣas affecting coked objects and many other such dōṣasbased on the dictum prevalent in those traditions that Bhakti of their respectivetraditions has the power to nullify the the dōṣas if any arising from whatever sources in which such beliefsvest the dōṣa and as such even dvijas of these traditions do not have recognize these dōṣas affecting coked objects and many other such dōṣas.



6.ārya samāj and many such reformist movements alsowhile believing in books such asManusmr̥ti do not have the culture of disallowing people into the kitchen or not acceptingfood based on who cookedit.



7.The issue then seems tobelong to the 'sanātanis' and their beliefs ofdōṣas of sparśa, dr̥ṣṭi etcaround yantra(s), sālagrāma(s) or other similar objectsand around cooked objects. The texts articulating/ documenting/ reflecting/ discussing such beliefs will be the best placesto look for in this regard.
