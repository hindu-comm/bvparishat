You should not give an ear to what people, who -  
lack study of shAstra-s in traditional way (especially of mImAMsA),  
who don't accept same as pramANa for dharma-brahma,  
and have no place for unbroken paramparA while considering technical terms,  
who don't accept that any two shAstra-s are connected and are flawless,  
and most importantly rely on a single shloka from other shAstra to decide everything said in every other shAstra,  
- say.  
  
I'm saying this because I know that you are not asking questions related to new view just present here.  
  
You should search for this in essays on brAhmaNa-s as brAhmaNotpattimAttaNDa, etc.
