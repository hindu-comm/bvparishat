Hare Krishna.  
Dear Siddhartha Krishnaji,  
  
I am working in the same lines of practically establishing varna based  
on guNa-karma concept of Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-bhagavatam and  
Mahabharata in our small community. So far what I have read from  
Dharma-sastras (also SB, Bg, MBH) through commentaries of acharyas:  
In Yajnavalkya Smrti (See Yajnavalkya smriti: Medhatithi & Balambhatta Gloss) -  
Commentator Balambhatta describes that there are two things "jati" and  
"varna". The description described in majority of dharma sastras to  
decide caste is description of "jati". "Varna" is actually based on  
guNa-karMa. Thus there are more than 250 jatis while only 4-varNas. So  
a person born in a brahmin family can be of different varNas.  
Suddha Brahmana jati is from Brahmana father and Brahmana mother  
(following all samskaras for generations). So varna will also be  
brahmana. From a Brahmana father and Sudra mother (as brahmanas were  
allowed to keep wives of all classes) Nisada or parasava jati is born.  
He is considered amongst sudras, eg. Vidura. Thus there are different  
types of sudras also. Sat-sudras are the sudras - born of sudra father  
and sudra mother, fallendown brahmana father and mother, brahmana  
father and sudra mother. These sudras were allowed to cook for  
ceremonies in dvija, houses of kings, brahmanas. Of course brahmanas  
who want to follow strictly may not opt for it although allowed in  
dharma-sastras (allowance is made for accomodating varieties).  
But the whole point here was if the samskaras are followed properly  
then one could decide work based on heredity. when they are not then  
the progenies become in the category of sat sudras first and then just  
sudras in the subsequent generations. Consequently the law described  
by nArada-muni in Srimad Bhagavatam applies:  
yasya-yat lakShaNam proktah, puruSham varNAbhivyanJakam. yadyanyatrApi  
dRUSyeta, tattenaiva vinirdiSet. (SB 7.11.35)  
Thus seeing this I think it doesn't contradict that Bhimasena was  
allowed as a cook as paricarya is not a prohibited occupation of a  
sat-sudra. Sat-sudras born from brahmana father does not give up  
asAdhAraNa dharmas like gayatrI etc. (See commentaries on SB 7.11.35  
of AcAryas in a book by bhAgavata vidyApiTha, sola)  
  
Also I would like to meet you (Siddhartha Krishnaji) as you are  
working in the same lines as me. If possible please send me your  
contact no.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
