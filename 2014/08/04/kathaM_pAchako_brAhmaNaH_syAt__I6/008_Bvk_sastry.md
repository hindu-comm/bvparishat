Namaste Siddhartha Krishna

  

Your post and follow up response is a ticklish and sensitive issue (- which can touch the raw nerves of many ' brahmana - hindu - caste - readers).

The long note is compelling to clarify and address the complex, inaccurate , mischievous and involved issues which are integral part of post. This hurts the profession and pride of a ' veda practicing community'.

  

A \< brahmana- cook> does not become a shudra as you point in the post ! A brahmana- cook must have a professional vedic and ayur- vedic training.

A brahmana- cook training is a part of four Upa- Veda professionals training logistics. It is an education system of professional nature; destroyed by modern educationists; the destruction of an employable traditional education system for creating socially relevant professions on par with a professional Vaidya/ doctor. The modern analogy for this is in the new series of professions who supplement a : Doctor' s professional medication as a nutrition consultant- a chef- a menu maker. This traditional training has carefully addressed the challenges posed by the fashionalblity - banes springing out of fast foods / mass foods/ stored foods consumptions and eating outside at inappropriate times where no one can vouch for the ' sacredness of food served' in a modern society. Even The so called 'cafe' at a hindu mandir does not serve' prasad'! It is a ' anna- vikraya- sthana' = a sale point of eatables in the temple precincts, abusing the samskrutham technical term ' Pradada'!

An outcome and fall out of many mandirs which in their core are ' deva- darshana/seva- vikraya- sthana'(= malls where religious services
and seeing - God/s form are commodified by gradation for a convenience of charge amount / a price privilege of money by bidding ). The concept of ' need appropriateness' as wisdom guidance in the classical texts for devalaya operation has yielded place for ' Greed accommodative exploitation model' by running a ' deva-aalaya' as ' religion product- service corporate business with a brand name to guard'.

  

If the current society (- brahmin/ vaidika communities) really want to go beyond chitchat on forum to get vedic benefits and want a compliance with the lines of rulebooks debated, then one need to see how professions (vaidika vritti) beyond (- paurohitya/ panditaayi) are to be brought in to main stream / gurukul education and society benefits.

  

Here are some points to contemplate:

  

1\) In a society of ancient / mediavel Varna-Ashrama model, based on upanishad and Ayurveda guidance, the food has to be appropriate for body-mind type by Gunas and Karmas.

This knowledge was a part of Ayurveda- practicing Brahmanas and Yajnika brahmanas. The food was \< Prasada / eating is Yajna karma>.

In this context the concept and profession of \< brahmana- paachaka> is not alien or anti- traditional profession.

  

The \< shoodra- anna bhojana> restriction has a totally different background. The overruling guidance in all cases is \< annam brahma- annam na- nindyaat- annam bahu kurveeta>. Please Keep the spiritual vedantic interpretations of these veda- vakyas to a different context where the equation is ' Annam= Brahma' is a result of tapas, and please read the text in a social context and frame of dharma shaastra guidance.

  

This ' bhojana as yajna- karma' is a part of understanding seen in bhojan mantra from maharastra which treats eating as \< udara- bharana..
  jaanire yajna karma> Derived from Gita statement related to vaishvaanara- agni- hotra.

  

The chaaturvidhya of \< anna \> seems to cover all types of foods: vegetarian and non vegetarian;- any food that can go as a yajna offering.

  

The \< food= aahaara for the body- mind nurturing> - preparation of food - impact of food preparer (pAchaka) and process of preparing food (- pAka prakriyaa) are well recognized in smriti's. To understand the importance given for \< brahmana aachaara- braahmana model of preparing eating food>, the food standards called Kosher used by Jewish teams would help. So also the conceptual framework called ' Halaal' branding in Islamic traditions.

The food standards comparisons can provide a helpful perspective about why and goals of \< brahmana aachara and brahmana- pachaka profession>.

  

Coming to Artha shaastra, some where the mention is made about the brahmana- cooks/ supervisors/ food servers for King. The colonial and post- independence demand of

Many \< brahmana - government top- brass officials> to have only \< brahmana cooks and orderly's \> as a \< state provided perks of service> is a living tradition in India. It is also a reflection on where\< ayurveda- practicing - brahmanas and Temple- archakas> ended up under the wealthy bosses claimkng to be of Kshatriya - Vaishya-Shudra varnas !

Again this is a live problem. This is described by the \< history writers with a colored lens over their eyes> as social justice achieved by making a brahmana do the menial jobs like a shudra (- misunderstood!).

There is a down pulling approach and a demonic satisfaction; it is nothing to do with upliftment and elevation of

shudra to any higher level!

  

In yoga posture terms, doing head-stand ( sheershaasana) is certainly an achievement! But it does not help the doer any good to \< walk on head with feet floating in air>! Instead the head (- and brain injury could be the consequence!).

  

And about the process of brahminical food- preparation model:- the brahminical model of food preparation needs veda chanting while preparing the food . The cook needs to know veda and practice veda to transform ' anna' to be ' deva yogya and yajna- bhojya'.

The technicalities of food preparation for yajnas needing ' Swaahaa' and ' Swadhaa' technicalities are different.

These are possible only if there is a technical professional \< Ayurveda - veda knowing Brahmana cook>. This is far more than a \< religion cook \> categorization !

  

Can you please enlighten me about any institution any where which is addressing this issue beyond deliberation on \< training a brahmana to be fit only for a temple- priest job \>? Has any brahmana community raised a little finger and voice on this socially relevant and globally critical issue ; food for health of body and spirit ?

  

Contra, jewish traditions have professional education system and employment regulations for Kosher food preparation , inspection and certification.

This writer has developed some provision for such \< education programs to train brahmana standards for alternate professions> which address \< brahmana standards/ vedic standards/ ayurveda standards> of food preparation and services. Contact me off line for details .

  

There is a lot more to be done and supported in this area beyond raising \< ticklish issues> in a \< stripped and isolated model> for a forum debate- post. Commodification of tradition does not make the enterprise any more spiritual ir punya- earning to please a god or guru!

  

The complexities of food - brand economies are a global corporate challenge beyond \< what might have happened

In the royal kitchen of virata> or what \< buddha was served as the last meal>. The emergence of vaihnava food standards, udupi
brahmin-food brand chains from Karnataka are some thing to explore carefully.
