Vindhya region from 15th century has been marked as a prominent seat of Sanskrit learning. Here arose many kings of Baghel Dynasty having profound knowledge of Sanskrit. They not only composed many Sanskrit prose and poetic works but also gave patronage to the Sanskrit scholars to do so.  
We are delighted to announce that presently available all such Sanskrit works have been edited, explained by us and published by our institute--Veda Vani Vitan. We have thus made a valuable service for Sanskrit world.  
'Jagadish-shatakam', among so many edited books, is displayed here. Scholars are requested to take interest to this valuable mission and disseminate it widely--Dr. Sudyumna Acharya.
