Thirty Minor Upanishads by Narayanswami Aiyer K. published Adyar has no svara or accentuation marks. What you showed was some picture.  
I agree with points 2 and 3ofyour previous mail.  

  

This edition with Accent markings for Taittiriya upanishad  
  
<http://tinyurl.com/k54rlk9>  
  
This is for the entire yajur veda and the Upanishads can be extracted with accentual markings  
<http://www.sanskritweb.net/yajurveda/>**  
  
**Similarly one can extract from the printed editions of the vedas printed with Accentual markings relevant Upanishad section**s**
