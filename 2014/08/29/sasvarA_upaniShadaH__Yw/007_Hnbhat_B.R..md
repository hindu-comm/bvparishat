ASS No.106 दशोपनिषदः has got only तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् सस्वर  
ASS No.12 तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् is also सस्वर.  
  
The other Upanishad-s are not accented. ईशावास्योपनिषत् has been  
edited with सस्वर I remember. with padapatha.  
  
ईशावास्योपनिषत् is last अध्याय of शुक्लयजुर्वेदसंहिता and is edited with svara.  
  
Others also need be checked with the related आरण्यक portions if edited  
with svara. The Edition with Brahamanandayogin's commentary does not  
have any accent marks.  
The Editions of Upanishad-s with Shankarabhashya, Taittiriya only is marked.  
The others have to be checked.
