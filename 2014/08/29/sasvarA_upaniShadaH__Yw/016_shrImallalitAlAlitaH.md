I'm sorry for not replying on time.  
  

So, we have Isha, taittirIya, mahAnArAyaNa, and mAdhyandinashAkhIya-bR^ihadAraNyakopaniShad; mainly because their pATha-paramparA is still there.  
  

Other upaniShad-s are without svara, because we have lost pATha-paramparA(shAkhA) or don't have manuscripts with svara-mark.  
  

If students/scholars find any other upaniShad anywhere, please post to this thread in future. I'll try to find in manuscripts with the help of veda-paNDita-s.
