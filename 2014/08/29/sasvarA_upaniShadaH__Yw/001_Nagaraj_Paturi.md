1\. I found snapshots of pages with the 19th century devanagari font with svara of some Upanishads posted on certain websites. sample attached here.

  

2\. Similar older prints in Telugu script were done by Vavilla Ramasvami Shastrulu, Madras and other such publishers.

  

3\. Oral version is preserved in all the vēda pāṭhaśālas. So it is very much possible to document it again. But other members should be able to confirm that my memory of having seen the printed versions is not wrong. So we may not be in need of reinventing the wheel for most of the main upanishads.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
