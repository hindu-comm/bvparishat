Thanks, Mamata Mishra, for sharing this detail.  
  

Please, note that this is a thread related to upaniShad-s with svara marks. If you post any other details here which are not related to this subject, it's just will distract people and may derail thread from the subject if people mindlessly



start to reply to/ thank to your post.  
So, for every poster, I request to see where he is posting.  

Please, start a new thread for 'Catalogus Catalogorum' and post all updates at one place. That will help people to find related things at a place and save other threads from being hijacked.  
  

BTW, if anyone doesn't know how to start a new thread:  

1\. Don't reply to any BVP post with undesired subject.  

2\. Write a new message with desired subject. This will create new thread for you.
