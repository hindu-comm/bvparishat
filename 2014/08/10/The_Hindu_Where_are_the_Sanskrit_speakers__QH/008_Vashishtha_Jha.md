Whose mother tongue is English in India ? Then why is it taught ? Therefore, mother tongue based argument is fallacious. Over and above communicating internationally through English, it may be the source of knowledge in many fields, there is no doubt. But Sanskrit too, even when it is not the medium of communication at home, is the source of knowledge embracing every aspect of life and culture and hence it must be promoted at all cost. It has been nourishing and enriching Indian mind, heart, soul, life , language and culture for ages and will continue to do so for all time to come. For this reason Sanskrit should be made available to one and all of this country and one and all should be taught how to live a civilized life by deriving insights from Sanskrit. This is the responsibility of all governments. Politicians call themselves public servants. This will be their greatest service if they take Sanskrit to every home of this country by bringing Sanskrit to the main stream of Education. So let us not waste our time pm census based arguments. Sanskrit is language of knowledge.
