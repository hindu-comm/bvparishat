Inaugurating the 15 the World Sanskrit Conference at New Delhi in Jan 2012, Dr.Manmohan Singh, the then Prime Minister of India said " Sanskrit is the Soul of India" . This cryptic statement puts in nutshell the very nature of Sanskrit. Souls are not subjected to census, whereas the bodies or persons that embody the soul are and can be numbered. The languages that have been influenced by Sanskrit can be numbered andare many. Starting with the very name of our land BHARAT, named after the son of King Dushyanta and Sakuntala, the motto in our national emblem "SATYAMEVA JAYATE" (Mundakopanishad), " Annam Bahu kurvita" of Food Corporation of India, "yogakshemam vahamyaham" LIC, This great Classical Language has permeated every walk of our life, national ethos, culture and what not. The names of many Indians, including many politicians , have Sanskrit word or influence.

A mere statistical account does not deprive the language of its richness and antiquity. Each language is great and is meant for people to convey and enjoy its literature. It will be wise not politicise or give twist and turns by the media. The great patriot poet of India, Mahakavi Subramanian Bharatiar said " India has 30 crore faces, but the life (Soul) is ONE, she speaks 18 languages but her thought is ONE.

  

Let us imbibe the best from every language instead of mixing up issues for trivial gains.
