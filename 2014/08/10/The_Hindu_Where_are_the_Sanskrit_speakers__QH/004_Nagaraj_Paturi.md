1\. Is the Sanskrit week a celebration of Sanskrit as amother tongue? Is it a celebration of a great number of its speakers? Is the significance of Sanskrit based on the number of people having it as mother tongue or the number of its speakers?



2\. Can the Union Government of this country celebrate a week at an all India level, for any oneof the languages of India like Kannada, Marathi, Kashmiri or Assamesewhich has a great number of mother tongue speakers ?



3.Which other language of India than Sanskritcan be claimed to have ahistorical role in the evolution of almost all the Indian languages right from the ancient period?



4\. The Hindu's sentence is:



"There are almost no Sanskrit speakers in the country’s north-east, the eastern States beyond Madhya Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat, according to the Census 2001."



Is the connection of languages in the country’s north-east, the eastern States beyond Madhya Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat with Sanskrit any different from the connection of theremaining languages with Sanskrit?



5\. The words of Prof. Ganesh Devy to the extent as quoted in thisstory of The Hindu show his poor understanding of linguistics as he sees the connection of Sanskrit with Indian languages rooted in the myths and rituals. His quote:



"Ultimately, Sanskrit may be nowhere and everywhere, say Devy. “It has been with us as an idea. There is an emotional link with the language. Another language can replace it only if our myths and rituals move out of Sanskrit.”"



Speakers of English and other European languages have long ago, at least by their religious affiliation,moved away from the myths and rituals of the Greek and the Latin speakers. Did the emotional link of the Europeans with those two languages get reduced after those people moved away from the 'pagan' myths and rituals? Did not the Europeans continue to view their classicalorigins inGreek and Latin for centuries after they 'moved out of' the 'pagan' myths and rituals?



6\. The pathetically poor knowledge of the writer of this story in The Hindu (or Prof. Devy is not clear)is glaringly visible from his understanding that the language of the Bangladeshi immigrants is Urdu. "Bangladesh is considered to be a monolingual country in which more than 98% of the population is speakers of Bangla language" (from ' Condition of English in Bangladesh: Second Language or Foreign Language By:S M Mehdi Hasan' <http://www.eslteachersboard.com/cgi-bin/asia/index.pl?noframes;read=158> )



7. The Hindu's anti-Hindu approach seems to be rooted in a wrong market calculation that the readers of the English news papers are largely in the obsolete anti-religious 'liberal politics' mode of thinking only or in theidea of English media'sresponsibility to shoulder the white-man's burden.



Ultimately Satyameva Jayate.



Let us celebrate Sanskrit week with greater Shraddhaa.
