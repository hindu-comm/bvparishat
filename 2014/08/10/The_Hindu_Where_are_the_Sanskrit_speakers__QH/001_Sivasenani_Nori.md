The Hindu is quite a respected newspaper and often reliable; however, in matters Hindu, it is not so. Notwithstanding its name, The Hindu is consistently against anything it perceives as "Hindu". The present article is a case in point.

  

Census 2001 has data on language reported as a "mother tongue". As many of us can aver, "mother tongue" is different from the languages a person knows. My mother tongue is Telugu, but I also know English, Sanskrit and Hindi.

  

One can check the census definition (<http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.aspx>) to know what is reported. Even the graphic of The Hindu says "Those who claimed Sanskrit as mother tongue" (in the bottom). Here is another proof: the number listed against English is 2,26,449 (2.26 lakh). According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation (<http://www.auditbureau.org/>), quite a dependable source in mattes such as these, the audited circulation of English newspapers in the country during July-December 2013 is 1,22,01,775 (i.e. 122 lakh), about 50 times the number who have English as mother tongue.

  

Finally there are most likely more Sanskrit teachers in Government Schools, and more students in M.A. Sanskrit programs than 14,000. Are we saying that this country admits those who do not know Sanskrit into MA, Sanskrit and appoints those who do not know Sanskrit as Sanskrit teachers?

  

So statements like the following in the report are simply false:

  

"There are almost no Sanskrit speakers in the country’s north-east, the eastern States beyond Madhya Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat, according to the Census 2001. (What is correct is that "there is almost nobody who declared Sanskrit as mother tongue in ...)"  

  

"Because some people “fictitiously” indicate Sanskrit as their mother tongue owing to its high prestige and Constitutional mandate, the Census captures the persisting memory of an ancient language that is no longer anyone’s real mother tongue, says B. Mallikarjun of the Center for Classical Language." (Prof. B. Mallikarjun is the director of Center for Classical Language *- Kannada* (emphasis supplied) in Central University of Karnataka, but his association with Kannada was missing in the report. If The Hindu took so much pain to speak to so many non-Sanskritists, why could they not talk to Sanskrit speakers for the story?)  

  

People on this forum know about vyangya-artha and Dhvani. The dhvani in the sentence "In a country of over a billion people, there are about 14,000 people who claim Sanskrit is their mother tongue, an analysis of Census numbers reveals." is that people say Sanskrit is important, but just look at the numbers and see how insignificant it is.

  

Let us understand the agenda of such reports and condemn them.
