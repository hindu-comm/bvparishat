Namaste

  

The report of The Hindu is intentionally made

Mischievous to create ripples and language based

disruptions in India that was BHARATH before

independence.

No slight made in the statement:

mera Bharat mahAn!

  

Coming to the statistics of spoken language

as ' mother tongue',  
Le us look at some probing questions:

  

\- how many mothers in villages of India

are ' english educated' ? To give a proper response

to the census- questions?

\- how many schools have government

Supported to make Sanskrit to be a part

Of ' mother tongue' education?

'Mother tongue' language is NOT the

Same as ' school Teaching Medium tongue'

Controlled by private interests and government

Interests!

  

\- Sanskrit is a ' language of Religion-

Caste- class'- according to the Secular/

Sicular government attitude. Only lip-sympathy

Is made to Sanskrit, as it can not be

Deleted from its already present language status

In the indian constitution!

However,What is possible is to make enough damage

And put Sanskrit in To a Coma state using

power of governance And maintain public apathy

for revival of Sanskrit!

  

What is the remedial measure?

Prove relevanceOf Sanskrit to ALL

as a language of Science , Technology,

Health And Cultural heritage Pride.

This calls for proactive investment

Which should not be siphoned out by political hawks!

  

It is not enough to quote an emulate the

revival modelOf Hebrew as a classical language

to

Become a vibrant national language;

the backing Of community and government

in making this happen Needs to have its

parallel in India.

  

This will be opposed tooth and nail by the

Current academia, media and government

With all their might.

The weapon of Aryan- Dravidian/

Dalit Caste politics / social oppression theme

Built in bad- history given by colonial writers/

Equally bad are the superlative claims of some traditional

Teams that india had everything

including atomic weapons in the past times

Of mahabharath as astras - et al.

  

In other words, to revive the language that

Connects us to Gods

( Deva- Bhashaa / Devataa Bhashaa)

We need to work. Gods are not going

To do the social janitor / safai- karmachari work

by Accepting pooja- paath as compensation

at temples.

  

In short, there is a three hundred years

Dirty stables to be cleaned for Sanskrit, in order to

To get back to the Veda- Bhashaa

From the Historical indo- Aryan

imported language to India

Through the intervention of X-ian missionaries

(- for details on thisPlease read Rajiv Malhotra and

take a look atThe theories on sanskrit language

history taught at many seminary schools).

  

Bharthee can only come back to India

if

India becomes Bhaarath

and

we the people Of India become Bharateeyas.
