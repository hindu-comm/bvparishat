Please read ten times the response of a true Indian to The Hindu heading on Sanskrit and ask your friends to read it. This gentleman has established a new **Centre of Excellence for the Study of Indian Philosophical Systems near Tiruvenveli in Tamilnadu. This learning centre is going to be operative from coming October.**

**

**I fully agree with his assessment that those who are opposing Sanskrit is simply taking forward the unfinished agenda of LordMacaulay.**

**  
**

**So let us concentrate on learning and taking Sanskrit to every home of our country.**

**May God give us that strength !**

Sanskrit is part of our heritage whether we speak it or not. We need to inquire into why we do not speak in Sanskrit and address the causes to get the desired effect which is that more persons must comprehend, be able to converse and communicate and in time regain what we have owing to a whole lot of unfortunate reasons allowed to happen.

These same persons who make such suggestions would not even part with their inheritances and so any call they make to abandon our heritage is foolish and most certainly the handiwork of modern Macaulays.

Suggesting that we can ignore the study of Sanskrit is equal to suggesting that we must forget who we are.

Sir, the 5 level programme on The Structure of Sanskrit Language will not only revive Sanskrit but it will definitely change the scenario substantially. We need to ignore all these insinuations and barbs and keep at it incessantly. If each year a 100 persons are added who continually add 100 more it will not take us even a decade to demolish any such ridiculous suggestion.

But if we do not do anything at all , then we will have no one but ourselves to blame.

It must not , it will not and cannot be allowed to happen.

With respect and regards  
Mani A Pulimood  

The so-called intellectuals in the media is pointing out to the number of Sanskrit speakers in India and suggesting thereby that there is no need of Sanskrit education in India.

  

Do you agree ? Discuss.

  

I am forwarding herewith my response.
