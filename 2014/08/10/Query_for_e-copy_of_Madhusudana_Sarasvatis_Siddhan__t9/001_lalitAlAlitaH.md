Here is it :  
  
5010010086997 - siddhaantabindu, hariharashaashtrinaa, 221p,  
  
Use DLI downloader of Munish Chandel to download it.  
  
BTW, I was working on it, and it contains many errors. To get corrections, compare it with Chowkhaba Edition and if possible shrI daxiNAmUrti maTha edition.  
The chowkhamba edition is on DLI :  
  
99999990077582 - The Siddhantabindu (Vedanta Section No.-8), Sarasvati, Madhusudana, 489p,  
  
daxiNAmurti edition is not online. They are in process to put it on their website :  
<http://shankaramatha.org>  
  
P.S: Remember to remove useless parts in mail. That increases load on inbox of individuals and BVP.
