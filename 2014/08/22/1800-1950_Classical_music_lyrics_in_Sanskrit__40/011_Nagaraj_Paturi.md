AadarraNIya Subrahmanianji,



Thanks for adding the two stalwarts. Though they do not fall under the 1800-1950 time period , those are evidences of how Sanskrit was a part of the day to day culture and as part of which tradition the 1800-1950 composers were composing.



Ūthukkāḍu Venkatasubbaiyer is popular as Ootukkadu Venkatakavi and with this name, there are many web links available.



For example, <http://www.venkatakavi.org/ovk/> is dedicated to his works.



Particularly Sadashiva Brahmendra Swami's compositions made Sanskrit the language of the street-singing lyrics of wanderingBairagis. Though the highly scholarly classical renditions in the stage-concerts do not bring out this feel of the lyrics, an unprejudiced look at the textseasily helps one catch the original wandering avadhoota style tunes meant for the lyrics.



Thanks again for bringing such examples of persons such as Sadashiva Brahmendra Swamiwho evenwhen theylost themselvesandsang their inner worlds out in a trans, expressed themselves only through Sanskrit.



Coming back to 1800-1950 , the other two members of the trinity of Karnataka Sangita Shyama Shastri (1762-1827)and Tyagaraja(4 May 1767 – 6 January 1847)also have a significant number of Sanskrit compositions.
