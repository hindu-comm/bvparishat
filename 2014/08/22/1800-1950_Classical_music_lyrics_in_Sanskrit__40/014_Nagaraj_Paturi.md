AadaraNIya Dhavalji,



The theme of the thread is, as you would have seen, classical music. The actual musical performance of songs. The names figuring here are those of poet-singers, vaaggeyakaras, those who sang the songs 'written' by them. Those whose songs became part of the classical music singing tradition.



Thanks for all the 19th century Sanskrit literature information. All this will be highly helpful in the broader argument counter to the theory of 'Death of Sanskrit'. I am in fact surprised to see that the students of MA (Sanskrit) are given so much information about the 19th century Sanskrit literature and still the theory of stopping of Sanskrit literary creativity by 1800 went unquestioned by Indianscholars. (Those whocontested the theory were western scholars only.)



Thanks again for the info. But let us discuss this outside this particular thread.
