You are blessed! You are really blessed!!



We are all able to see why such an Avatara Purusha would have picked you out for such a blessing.



These works such as that of Parama Pujya Jagadguru Ramabhadracharyaji are nevertheless counter -examples for the theory of 'death of Sanskrit' by which was meant the stopping of a natural, creative production of Sanskrit literature.



Since the author mentioned 1800 as the time when this stopping happened, 1800-1950 is brought for the sake of argument.



1950 because all the post-1950 works could be dubbed as post-independent artificial efforts of revival.
