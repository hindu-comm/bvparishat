Dear Sir,  
  

This is a very good approach. many vaaggEyakaara-s like mahaavaidyanaatha iyer, pattnam subrahmanya iyer, muttaiah bhaagavatar, vaasudEvaachaarya, GNB, paapanaashaM shivan, M.balamuralikriishna etc., have enriched with thousands of compositions in Sanskrit. This is even to day in progress.  
  

Here I would like to say that apart from the new compositions, the old were/are also freely employed on stage both in case of music and dance and this would certainly imply that the living tradition of Sanskrit is perpetuated intact and it is the hall mark of any living language.  
  

regards  
  
ganesh
