From this web page:



According to T. Lakshmanan Pillai, irayimman tampi has to his credit more that 500 compositions. But, only few of those compositions have survived, which include 39 kIrttanams, 5 varNams, 23 padams and a few ATTAkkatha songs. Of the 39 kIrttanams, 29 are in sanskrit, and the remaining in malayALam. In the work, “*kEraLa sa”ngItam*”, the author V. Madhavan Nair has listed 60 compositions attributed to tampi (which include 33 k.rtis among which 28 are in sanskrit).
