1\. The discussion was started in the thread



<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/modernity/bvparishat/d-wPUry6MQU/x1aw8HZv6cYJ>



two new threads were opened for the subtopics within the same broad area



Apart from the present thread,



<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/1800-1950%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/JNms5XwtEOQ/70K-BUIK7TMJ>



was also started as the new threads for the subtopics only.



2\. The theory is being discussed here out of a great respect for the theorizer's scholarship. Sometimes such great scholars make such theories only to provoke thought among their academic fraternity. This one was definitely thought-provoking. Created a very good context for taking a relook at several interesting aspects of the history of Sanskrit literature. Without such a pūrvapakśa, study of history of śanskrit literature can end up being just a listing of books,without any interesting problematizing of the same. The theory successfully problematized the issue of the impact of colonial rule on the continuity of creativity in Sanskrit literature and issues such as transregional spread of Sanskrit literature during modern times.



3\. If some interesting aspects of Sanskrit literature are coming out through these threads, the whole credit goes to the theorizer of the pūrvapakśa and his ability to identify such a valid and worthyissue for debate.



4\. Particularly in the present thread, I am happy to seescholars such asśatāvadhāniR Ganeshji enjoying the discussion. Again the credit goes to the original problematizer only.
