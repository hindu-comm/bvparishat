Namaste  
  

One could add to the list those of Ūthukkāḍu Venkatasubbaiyer's Sanskrit compositions. He has composed enchanting songs both in Sanskrit and Tamil which are popular in the south:

So too the songs of Sri Sadashiva Brahmendra of Nerur some of which are: mānasa sanchara re, brūhi mukundeti rasane, sarvam brahmamayam, piba re rāmarasam rasane...These songs are a great hit during concerts.
The Swami was a Vedantin and Yogin and several miracles/legends are famous in the Tamil state. He has authored several works like 'Brahmasūtravṛtti', 'Yogasutravṛtti' apart from many minor works, all poetical. 'Atmavidyāvilāsa' is one such.
