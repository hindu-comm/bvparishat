While not in the period 1800 to 1950, scholars may be interested in the very recent publication Gītarāmāyaṇam (2011), one of the many magna opera of my Gurudeva, Abhinavajayadeva Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya. This work is an example of the living tradition of Jayadeva.

  

Gītarāmāyaṇam (The Rāmāyaṇa in songs), is a an epic (Mahākāvya) of the Gītakāvya (lyrical poetry) genre. While most songs in the epic were composed by Gurudeva in the years 2009 and 2010, some songs were composed as early as 1970s during his Pūrvāśrama days and sung in the morning Sevā of the Śrīvigraha of Bālarāghava that came into His hand while bathing in the Mandākinī during a six-month Payovarata in early 1980s (which is worshipped by Him till date). The single-act play Śrīrāghavābhyudayam of the 1980s has two songs which are in the Bālakāṇdam of the Gītarāmāyaṇam. The Gītarāmāyaṇam consists of 1,008 songs in Sanskrit which are divided into seven Kāṇḍas (books), every Kāṇḍa being sub-divided into one or more Sargas (cantos). Including the verses in between the songs, the work consists of more than 5,000 verses in all and runs into 850 pages with a Hindi translation of each verse and song by the composer Himself. There are 28 cantos in all, and each canto consists of exactly 36 songs. Some songs of the epic are based on Rāgas in the Hindustani classical music, most are based music of various regions of India from Avadha, Mithila, Rajasthan, Braja, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Bundelkhand and many other regions. In the epic, each song in sung by one or more characters of the Rāmāyaṇa or by the poet. The songs progressively narrate the Rāmāyaṇa via monologues, dialogues and multilogues. Verses between the songs, which take the narrative forward. A unique work which blends Śāstra and Loka, as well as the traditions of Vālmīki and Jayadeva. In the foreword, Gurudeva says

  

jayadevasamārambhāṁ tulasīsūramadhyamām

asmadācāryaparyantāṁ vande gītaparamparām

  

Gītarāmāyaṇa was released to public on January 14 2011 by none other than Triveṇīkavi Abhirāja Rājendra Miśra. A Praśasti of the work called Gītarāmāyaṇapraśastiḥ was composed byRājendra Miśra spontaneously and recited at the function.Gītarāmāyaṇapraśastiḥ was published in the February 2011 edition ofŚrītulasīpīṭha Saurabha, the monthly journal of our Āśrama. I will share Gītarāmāyaṇapraśastiḥ when my shipment of books from Hong Kong is delivered.

  

Gītarāmāyaṇam is very close to my heart in a special way, since Gurudeva blessed me, not worthy of such a blessing, in the Foreword -

  

vidheyavaryo mama miśranityānando dvijo nandatu satkuṭumbī

śrīgītarāmāyaṇamāpadasya pūtairdhanairgranthavariṣṭhavarṣma

  

The entire work (without the foreword) is available for free reading under -
