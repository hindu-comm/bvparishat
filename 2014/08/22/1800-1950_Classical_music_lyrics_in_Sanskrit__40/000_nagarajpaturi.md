Sanskrit lyrics being part of Classical music and Classical dance is old as the employment of Jayadeva's Ashtapadis for the purpose.



But here, I would like to bring the 1800-1950 contributions to this area into discussions as part of the attempts to show that a huge amount of Sanskrit literary creativity was not taken into account while theorizing "death of Sanskrit"



Let us begin with Sri Muttusvami Dikshitar (March 24, 1775 â€“ October 21, 1835) . He is one of the musical trinity of Karnataka Sangiita.
(caranatic music)



There is a website providing Statistical analysis of his compositions:



<http://carnatica.net/special/dik-stats-ppn.htm>



According to this, 99.16% of his compositions are in Sanskrit.



He travelled in North India and in Varanasi during his teenage itself.



40 of his compositionsare known to have been composed with the influence ofwestern music that he heard from the bands at the Fort St. George. They are called noTTusvara sAhitya the word noTTu being derived from the English word 'note'



He definitely created history through his Sanskrit writings and through him, Sanskrit became part of household culture of Karnataka Sangita world and this added a significant flavour to the cultural spectrum of Indian culture to that extent.
