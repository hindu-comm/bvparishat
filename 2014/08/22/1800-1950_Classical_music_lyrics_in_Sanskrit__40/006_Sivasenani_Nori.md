Talking of Rama Varma (Svati Tirunal), he has a unique contribution in Sanskrit poetics - he introduced the concept of Muhanaa praasa (मुहनाप्रासः) which is at the junction of chandassastra and gaandharvaSaastra. He also wrote a Sanskrit treatise on the same subject. This was printed by in Madras around 1940. Will send details later. This particular praasa, by the way, is to be found in the works of other Vaaggeyakaaras of the period as well.
