The proposer 'Death of Sanskrit' may not be a member of BVP. So mentioning that theory on every other thread may not be a good idea. This is my personal opinion. If Death of Sanskrit or such theories need to be discussed a separate thread may be made.  
  

Bibliographies of on Modern Sanskrit writings are available several works related to modern sanskrit writing has been mentioned. If we keep listing there can be no end. Every scholar will be able to list dozens of of work. Thanks for so many post and making me aware about the existence of such vast and beweldering variety of Sanskrit production from 1850's onwards
