A quick comment on symbol:

Though, it is good to see retaining Swastika variations in your typeset, this is not the usual shape that is used here. Perhaps, this shape '卐' is more popular than this '卍' one. The latter is mostly seen in non-Indian customs. More info is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika).
