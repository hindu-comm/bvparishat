Namaste,

  

 I know I'm on non-topic as usual. I'm cleaning a .doc file of a book for reprint for a close friend of mine and would like to give it an Indian look. The 1st edition of the book used pseudo-vintage ornaments at end of sections (see bellow). I wanted to propose to use something more Indian, like svastika variations (see above). Buddhist wheels might be a worse idea, still maybe there is even a font with Indian books elements or some gallery or good book to look at for inspiration.

 English translations of Sanskrit texts should use best fonts - for Latin part Oxford standards, for Devanagari - Bombay standards. And for book elements - Indian or, if none are known, not classical, non-Windows 95 windings elements, but original, authenic elements from real books printed in previous century. Agree?

  

M.
