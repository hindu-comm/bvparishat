Namaste Parameshwar

  

Kannada Version of Shiva Rahasya is available in DLI site. You can download it if you know kannada.

  

In Tanjore saraswathi Mahal Library has published 12 Amsas, but since fund's are not allocated to mahal to print the old works only few amsas are available currently from publications division of library.

  

Thanks
