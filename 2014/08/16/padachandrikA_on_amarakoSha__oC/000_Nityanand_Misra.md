Namaste  
  
I am looking for an online edition (or a print edition, in case online edition is unavailable) of Rāya Mukuṭa's commentary titled Padacandrikā on the Amarakoṣa. The work of Rāya Mukuṭa is referred to by the commentary Vyākhyāsudhā.  
  
Any pointers would be helpful. My search on Archive, DLI and scribd has had no result so far.
