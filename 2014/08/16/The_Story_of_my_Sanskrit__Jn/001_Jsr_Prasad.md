Namaste.  
  

1\. In the name of 'The Story of My Sanskrit', it seemed that the author, Ms. Ananya Vajpeyi of this article tried to attack Mr. Dina Nath Batra, the coordinator of NGEC and eminent Sanskrit scholar and her Guru, Prof. Kapil Kapoor. There is no need to tell that the author is an '**admirer**' of 'celebrated indologist' Prof. Wendy Doniger. After reading this, anybody can construe the real intention of the author of this article.  
  
2. She has clearly stated the ideological difference with her Guru, by stating that "*He* (Prof. Kapoor) *and I lost touch, partly because I went away overseas and partly because our political disagreements that were becoming increasingly apparent.*" When she (author) is able to appreciate Prof. Kapoor's passion towards Sanskrit that made him a 'memorable teacher', I really wonder why it felt difficulty to formulate, express and analyse concepts in Sanskrit of such a caliber trained under his tutelage. She did not mention what sort of Sanskrit commentaries she went through while working for her doctoral thesis.  
  

3\. I do not understand whether she met '*pandita maanyas'* at the places she mentioned during her exploration on interpreting caste system. My heart goes out to her, on her apparent experience of hardships while achieving her mission. The comment of a *panditammanya* - '... *only perverted women became scholars*', does not mean entire pantheon of scholars think in similar lines in India. Perversion is a disturbed state of the psyche. A person cannot be a 'perverted' and at the same time a 'scholar'; otherwise, which is known as 'split personality.' In fact, women are revered a lot in our great land as one can recall the words of sage Manu - यत्रैतास्तु न पूज्यन्ते सर्वास्तत्रा'फलाः क्रियाः ।  
  

4\. Prof. Kapoor's endorsement of Hindutva spokesperson's statement on airplanes, cars, stem cell research in ancient India, has nothing to do with any 'caste system' that she was trying to understand. Though, I am not sure of airplanes and cars, but I am sure, somebody would soon decode something on stem cell research from Ayurvedic samhitas.  
  

5\. The author referred to her PhD guide, Prof. Pollock ( a Govt. of India - President Awardee) and his scholarship. No doubt, his dedication and contributions to Sanskrit are commendable, but his much debated article 'The Death of Sanskrit' (2001) is still raging controversy. I firmly believe, equal caliber of scholarship still exists in India. Only that, one should identify and approach right kind of scholars.  
  

Finally, the last paragraph in the article brings in a lot of ambiguity. She basically missed the *anubandha catushtaya* of her narration.  
  

With regards,  

Dr. Prasad
