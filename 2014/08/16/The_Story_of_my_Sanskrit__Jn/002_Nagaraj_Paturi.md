One of the online responses to 'The story of my Sanskrit':



"I am Indian. I am in Europe for the last 10 years. It's interesting that children in Europe can learn Latin and Greek freely in schools, refer to the Greek/Roman heritage – accepted as the civilizational ethos of Europe - freely in humanities & social sciences, without it being debated by "secular-humanists". Is it our fault that India's antiquity/civilizational ethos is "Hindu/Vedic?" Or is there a better term? So-called "secular-humanist" parties oppose the teaching of Sanskrit in schools because of an imagined "religious" connection. Surely, “secular-humanists” ought to know that “Hindu” philosophy includes different schools of thought and knowledge traditions and that Sanskrit has the largest known atheistic literature corpus. And why force this Western construct of "secular-humanism" on us when there are equivalents in Indian knowledge traditions too? How "secular-humanist" is it to deny epistemological freedom to certain societies and guarantee the same to others?"
