What is the context of your study ?



1\. Madhvacharya and Ramanujacharya did not dispute every single expression from S'ankaracharya.If you study the Bhashyas of Madhvacharya and Ramanujacharya, you may see that they did not comment on certain portions of Prasthanatraya, probably indicating that they did not differ with S'ankara on that count. I think the etymology of the word Upanishad was one such instance where there was no scope for sectarian interpretation and the need for Madhvacharya and Ramanujacharyato differ with S'ankara .



2\. If at all there was a difference of opinion , it was with regard to the relative significance of Vishnupaaramyapratipaadaka Puranas vis-à-vis Upanishads as PramaaNa. Madhvacharya gave great significance to Vishnupaaramyapratipaadaka Puranas as PramaaNa.



3\. Thus the etymology of the word Upanishad is not the right place to look for the differences of Opinion among the Jagadguru Acharyas of Trimatas.
