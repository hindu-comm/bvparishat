Sir,

It is definitely not for difference of opinions or something of that sort I am looking for upaniShad. I will never be having any interest in that regard and direction.

It is related to meaning and definition of word "upaniShad" - exclusively- and not to different matas at all.

While defining that word, I wanted to see the explanation of all matas. Thats all.

Some beginner books would have helped.. as I totally am unaware of any.

Anyway- thankyou.
