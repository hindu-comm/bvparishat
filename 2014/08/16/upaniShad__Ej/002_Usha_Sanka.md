Thankyou sir.

This way I understand. But it is not about kvip.

Then, let me put my question in different words-

How is the word उपनिषद् exactly introduced and explained in माध्व and विशिष्टाद्वैतमतs?

How do they define it? Or what do they say about it before diving deeper into the inner text contents?
