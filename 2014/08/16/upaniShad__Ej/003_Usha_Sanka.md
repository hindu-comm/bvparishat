Could I know if any introductory books about these philosophies.. where we can find an explanation to उपनिषद्?

Because वेदान्तो नाम उपनिषत् प्रमाणम् and ultimately everyone has to write commentary on प्रस्थानत्रयं for establishing their मत. They must have explained it somewhere in the beginner books before introducing their मत.

Hope I make myself clear now.
