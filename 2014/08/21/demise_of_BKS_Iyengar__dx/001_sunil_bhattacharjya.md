Yes, it is a great loss. For some years I and my wife attended his yoga classes in Pune, conducted by a senior student of his and we were greatly benefitted. He simplified the Yogasanas in an innovative way. For example, we used bolsters and steel chairs for the Sarvanga-asana. He will be remembered by his students for ever.
