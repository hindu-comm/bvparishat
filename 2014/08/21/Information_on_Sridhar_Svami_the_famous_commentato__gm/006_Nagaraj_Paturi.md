Prof. Narasimhacharya, the editor of the TTD Edition ofSrimadbhagavatapurana with different commentaries, writes in his Editorial,



It is learnt that Sridharaswami was the Mahant of the Sankarite monastery, Govardhan in about 1400 A.D. He says that he wrote his commentary, Bhavarthadlpika by name in strict adherence to the old tradition and followed the foot steps of Citsukhacarya. His commentary is lucid though brief, authoritative though reticent and direct to the point, and that is why most of the commentators have made use of this enlightening exegesis. Nabhadasji (Ref. Bhaktamala - Chappaya 440) recorded a legend wherein it was stated that Lord Bindumadhava of Varanasi has recognised Sridhara' s commentary as the authoritative interpretation of Sri Bhagavata.



Legends locate his place of birth/childhood at so many different places.
