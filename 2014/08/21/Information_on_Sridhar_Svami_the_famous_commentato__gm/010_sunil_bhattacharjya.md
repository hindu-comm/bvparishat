Dear friends,  
  

There was a slip, for which I apologize. Kindly look at the the following correction:  
**  
**

**Wrong sentence :** Such being the case the Mahabharata text should have been easily understood by each and everybody.  
  

**Correct sentence** : Such being the case the Bhagavata purana text should have been easily understood by each and everybody.  
  

Regards,
