All the sources give his date as 15th Century. They differ with regard to place.



Some mention Orissa /Odisha and some others indicate Gujarat.



I read this probably a legend (shared by one Sri V. Narayanan )prevalent in some sections:

  
Sridhara Swami was born at Balodi Village at Gujarat some 600 years ago.  
He was a disciple of Paramanda Puri and his beloved deity was Narasimha.  
  
He attempted to bring synthesis between Shankara Samradhaya & Madhava Samradhaya.  
Hence his commentaries are called Subodhini (Gita), Bhavarthadipka (Bhagavata) and Atmaprakasa (Vishnu Sahasra Nama)  
  
"All are nothing other than God but just a part of Him" was his conclusion.  
This is the concept of Vaishnavas. Hence despite an advaitin he is a devotee and vaishanava in inherent nature.  
  
Therefore Advaitins did not agreed to the synthesis.  
They created hell a lot of problems for the Swamiji.  
Hence, Lord Shiva appeared before them and roared:  
  
"I have learned the true teachings of the Scriptures due to chanting of Rama Nama.  
So does Suka. Vyasa may or may not know as he is busy in compiling them than mediating on the meaning.  
But Sridhara knows everything due to the grace of Lord Nrisimha.  
Hence if one does any harm to him would reside only in hell..."  
  
Aham vedhi Suko Vyaso Vedhi n vedri va  
Sridharah sakalam Vedri SriNrishma Prasadah  
  
Hope this clarifies Sridhara Swami's life and teaching.  
  
Your Servant  
V. Narayanan



The s'loka quoted has many errors. But seems to be part of the way the legend is narrated.
