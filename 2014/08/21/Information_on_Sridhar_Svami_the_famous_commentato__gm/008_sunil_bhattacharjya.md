It is believed that Vedavyasa wrote the Mahabharata so that the lay-persons should be able to get the Vedic knowledge, but after composing the Mahabharata, which contains everything worth knowing, Vedavyasa was a sad man as the text became not that simple for each and everybody to understand. At that time Narada advised him to compose the Bhagavata Purana to make the things simple for the layman. Such being the case the Mahabharata text should have been easily understood by each and everybody. But around the late 13th century The great scholar found several meanings for the Bhagavata verses and the Bhagavata came to be considered a difficult text to understand. It was probably because of this Sridharacahrya was asked by his guru to compose a commentary on the Bhagavata purana so that Vedavyasa's aim was fulfilled and everybody has access to the text.  
  

As regards the Bindumadhava story, I read that Shridharacharya's
Subodhini-fika on the Bhagavad Gita was not accepted by the scholars in Kashi and they wanted a decision from Lord Bindumadhava. Flatteringly, the Lord said that Sridharacharya's understanding cannot be doubted even if Vedavyasa's understanding can be questioned.
