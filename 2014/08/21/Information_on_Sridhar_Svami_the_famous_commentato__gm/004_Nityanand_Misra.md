Please refer the attached. Pada number 45 of the Bhaktamāla by Nābhādāsa on Śrī Śrīdharācārya and the Mulārthabodhinī commentary in Hindi by my Gurudeva. Nābhādāsa is usually terse about factual details (Tathyas) and eloquent about virtues (Guṇas). Gurudeva gives an Ākhyā and some more details about Śrīdharācārya based on Antaḥsākṣyas.
