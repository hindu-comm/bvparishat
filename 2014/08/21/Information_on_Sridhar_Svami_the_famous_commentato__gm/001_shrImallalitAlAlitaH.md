I don't know about other details of shrI shrIdhara svAmI. But, from locals in kAshI I heard that his samAdhI is on maNikarNikA-ghATa on kAshI, in nR^isiMha maTha. The maTha was handed by the mahanta of that maTha to vishva-hindu-pariShad. They are running a pAThashAlA there.  

I don't hope that they are concerned about the samAdhI of this mahAtmA.
