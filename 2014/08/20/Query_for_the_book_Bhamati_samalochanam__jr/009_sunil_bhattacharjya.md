It is believed that Vacaspati Mishra hailed from a place in Mithila, which was the place of Mandana Mishra too and to this day people in that area think that Mandana Mishra was not defeated in the debate with Shankara. It could be that Vacaspati valued the views of Mandana Mishra as much as those of Shankara.
