Yes, there has been vehement protest from many of the Advaitins, who have accepted Vacaspati Mishra's alternative views (though somewhat different from that of Padmapada, but actually Shankara's own in the sense that Shankara personally approved what Padmapada wrote). In fact it is believed that the work of Padmapada was lost and it was Shankara, who recalled from his memory what Padmapada wrote and thus saved the work of Padmapada.  
  

I have just received the book. It may be worthwhile for the scholars to read the entire book.
