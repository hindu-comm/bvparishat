Also, it is a bit misleading to say that many Advaitins have accepted Vacaspati Misra's views, without qualifying the nature of the acceptance in some manner.In fact, if you look at the history of post-Sankaran advaita vedAnta literature, there are many many more authors in the vivaraNa sub-school than in the bhAmatI sub-school. And after the time of Appayya Dikshita, the tendency has largely been either to minimize differences between these sub-schools in the interest of a larger samanvaya or to explain the differences as arising only due to prakriyA bheda and not of substantive importance.



Best regards,
