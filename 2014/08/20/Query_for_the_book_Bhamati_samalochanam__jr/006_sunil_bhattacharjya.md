Dear Shri Subrahmanianji,  
  

Thank you for the clarification. Interestingly and also in a somewhat puzzling way, Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati says in his book "The Method of the Vedants : A Critical Account of the Advaita Tradition, p.548" , as follows :  
  

At many places in the Bhamati, on the pretext of giving a gloss on Shankara's commentary, the author actually introduces the ideas of Mandana as though they were those of the revered commentator.   
  

Would you like to say something on this.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil
