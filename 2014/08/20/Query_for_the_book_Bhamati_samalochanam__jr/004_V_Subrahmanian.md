Dear Sri Sunil ji,  
  

Actually the author of the book belongs to a school that holds the view that both Padmapada and Vachaspati mishra distorted Shankara's Advaita.
They do not agree with the above view of yours that Shankara approved what Padmapada had written. In short, they do not believe in the hagiographical work on Shankara.
