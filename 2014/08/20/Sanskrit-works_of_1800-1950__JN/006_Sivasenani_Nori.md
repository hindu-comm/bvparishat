It is amiss of me not to have mentioned Ambakartree of Pandit Raghunatha Sharma - the first complete commentary (in Sanskrit) on the three kaaNDas of Vaakyapadeeya written in the latter half of the twentieth century.

  

Vaakyapadeeya is a difficult text, which has established Vyakarana as a darsana alongside Sankhya, Yoga, etc. Panditji has shown in his commentary the advaitavaada of Bhartrihari. Helaraja, the commentator of the third kaaNDA has taken a similar stance, but Ambakartree is the first work in which this samanvaya is extended to the BrahmakaaNDa and VaakyakaaNDa thoroughly. Also, unlike some of the works that I mentioned in my earlier post, this is not an obscure work. The son of Pandit Raghunatha Sharma, Prof. Ramanatha Sharma is a well known professor of Sanskrit in the western world - famous esp. for his monumental English translation of the Ashtadhyayi (the translation of KaaSikaa, presently in print, would be the magnum opus I guess). Then scholars like Prof. George Cardona actually studied at the feet of Pandit Raghunatha Sharma. Yet, पश्यन्नपि न पश्यति।

  

To understand the philosophical importance of the samanvaya of Advaita and Sphotavaada, one needs to recollect that Sankara has refuted Sphotavaada in the Devataadhikaranam of Brahmasutrabhashya - both Bhamati and Vivarana schools take the same stance. Notwithstanding this refutation, Panditji has shown the samanvaya.
