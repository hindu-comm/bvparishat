Sir

  

I am attaching of extracts of సంస్కృతసాహిత్యచరిత్ర (Samskritasaahityacaritra) of Prof. A. Ramulu, Head, Dept. of Sanskrit, Osmania University, Hyderabad written in Telugu. I have attached only the relevant portions of khandakaavyas and naatakas - details for other genres may be obtained from the book.

  

The Mahavir Open University course material might be difficult to get, but you do get a good selection of "History of Sanskrit Literature"s in Sanskrit, English, Telugu and Hindi at Gopal Book Depot (04024658101), Badi Chowdi, Koti, Hyderabad or Samskrita Bhasha Prachara Samiti (04024615481), Station Road, Abids, Hyderabad. Prof. Ramulu's book should also be available there.

  

Apart from these the Holenarsipur Swamiji, Sri Sachidanendra Saraswati has written boldly - his main contention is that Sankara's followers - of both Vivarana and Bhamati schools do not understand Sankara; that it is an andhaparamparaa. The volume of his output is also huge, all of which would pass the strictest test of scholarship - i.e. something original, profound, argued reasonably and presented well. That many, including yours truly, do not agree with the content does not take away from the scholarship.

  

Another hugely productive and original writer is Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi of Narsapur, Guntur District, AP. He lived a short life spanning the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but wrote a huge number of works across different genres - all in Sanskrit only.

  

Sri Kalyanananda Bharati, peethadhipati of the Sri Sringeri Sri Virupaksha Sri peetham of Guntur wrote two original works. One is Srikala, a commentary on the Lalita Sahasranama condemning the commentary of Bhaskara; the other one is an altogether new genre: the book is called Purnamimamsa which teaches Brahman through mathematics, geometry specifically. वृत्तमीश्वरः is one sutra that I remember. It is written in the sutra-vritti style.

  

One note, if I may. We can wake up those who are really sleeping; if, like my kids sometimes, one does not want to get up, what is the use of prompting and trying to wake up such a person? People like Prof. Pollock - there are worse, actually - make a living out of Sanskrit, and do so while heaping abuses on the language, the culture represented in the language, those who speak it, and those who revere it. As his student Dr. Ananya Vajpeyi stated in *The Hindu* recently, their agenda is take Sanskrit away from those who actually have it.

  

Yours truly

N. Siva Senani
