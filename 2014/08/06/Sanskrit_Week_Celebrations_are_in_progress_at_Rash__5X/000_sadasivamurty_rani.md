Respected Scholars,

Sanskrit Week Celebrations 2014 are in progress in Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati. The invitation of the celebrations is in the attachment of this mail.

There is a slight change in the last day's schedule. In fact the last day of the Celebrations falls on 12th of August. But it is wrongly printed as 11th. On the 11th day we have Bhakti Sandhya with popular Sanskrit Bhajans.

The Celebrations were grandly inaugurated yesterday and in the Yesterday A Mega Classical Dance Ballet VISHVAYANAM of Three hours length in Sanskrit was enacted by the Vidyapeetha Students.

All are cordially invited to participate in the events like Kavitajyotsna and Sangosthi.

With warm regards,

**Dr. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
