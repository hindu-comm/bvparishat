The following is from an essay "Contribution of Maharashtra in the field of Sanskrit in the 19th Century." by Shripad Bhat included in the book
19th Century Maharashtra: a reassessment.



As far as the grammar is concerned, there were many works to be mentioned,



Nilkantha Shastri Thatte (1750-1834) was acclaimed as one of the greatest grammarians in

the Deccan. He trained a long line of worthy pupils, who on their part, made significant contributions to the study of grammar either through teaching and or by means of their writings,



*Sadashivabhatta Ghule,*



wrote **a Vivruti on shabdendushekhara** and another **Bhatti on the**

**Paribhashendushekhara.**



A mention may be made here of *Bhaushastri Ghule (1828-1925)* of Nagpur who was the author of



**shekharavivrutisangraha (a commentary on the shabdendushekhara)** and



**the Gajasutravritti (a commentary on the Panini Sutra 1.3.67).**



One *Venkatamadhava*, who had migrated to Madras and was serving there as lecturer in Marathi in Fort St. George College about 1827 wrote a small work called **Maharashtra prayoga chandrika.** This is a grammar of Marathi in *227 Sanskrit sutras of Paninian type* and is accompanied by *a short Sanskrit vritti*, a Marathi vritti and illustrations.



*Raghavendracharya Gajendragadkar (1792- 1852)* of Satara one of the pupils of Nilakantha

Shastri Thatte, who wrote



**Tripathaga on the Paribhashendushekhara**,



**the Vishami on the Shabdendushekhara**, and



**the Prabha on the Vaiyakarana bhushanasara**.



About the middle of the 19th century, *Vishnu Shastri Bhat* of Poona,



wrote the **Chitchandrika on the Paribhashendushekhara**.
