My father's (Sri Paturi Sitaramanjaneyulu garu's) paramaguru is parama poojya Dandibhatla Viswanatha Shastrigaru. Hisbook (a commentary)Chandrika was written in the early 20th Century.



I found the following in the Publications.pdf of Rashtriya Samskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati :



61. **Paribhashendushekhara** (With the commentaries Chandrika and Balabodhini

Prof.Sripada Satyanarayana Murthy (Ed and comm.);

2004; Size: Royal Octavo; pp. xxvi + 494; Rs.452/- **RSV Series No. : 100**

This famous work of Nagesha consisting of 133 Paribhashas is published along with the commentary Chandrika written by ***Dandibhatla Viswanatha Sastri***. This commentary, wherein Nyaya mode of argumentation is adopted, has been edited and is being presented to the scholarly world for the first time. The commentary Balabodhini written by Prof. S. S. Murthy, mainly keeping in view the requirements of students is also

included. The elaborate introduction in the beginning provides valuable information about the commentaries, and other related details.
