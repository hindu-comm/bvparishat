dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams!  
  
I am fully in agreement with all those members who say that Hinduism is a very liberal, tolerant and moderate religion and nobody should dictate others as to what they should be doing or whom should they be worshipping.  
  
Yet, our true test of liberalism lies in how we learn to draw a line between liberalism and dilution of our tradition. It is extremely easy to become liberal and gain wide acceptance, but that is not necessarily the function of the sādhu.  
  
For example, if Hinduism is so tolerant, can we accept Islam as another offshoot and start composing Sanskrit works in praise of their prophets/god etc.? Did the renowned pandits of the bygone ages do something like that? Can i be a muslim or a christian and say that I too am a follower of Sanatana Dharma?  
  
Taking a traditional/conservative position is always the duty of the dharma-parishads, and whether we want to accept it or not in our personal lives is our personal choice.  
  
I feel a bit disheartened to see that many sannyāsīs, gurus and vidvat-sabhās try their best to present the orthodox siddhānta to us whereas the common norm in Hinduism now seems to be to challenge anything and everything orthodox. If we keep diluting our traditions by saying that "let everyone get away with anything" then we keep adding water to milk and one day, only water will be left.  
  
I can appreciate very much the position taken by the parishad. They did not issue a fatwa. They have given their conclusions. If someone comes to them for guidance, it is their duty to guide. This is how Hinduism was for ages. And we ordinary followers of Hinduism cannot keep acting like victims all the time. Even if we do not like their decision, it cannot easily change our personal faith, nor does it give us the right to lash out at them.  
  
The words of the sādhus should be respected, and I personally feel that every saffron bearing person (whether they are able to follow their vows properly or not) deserve to get my respect. They have sacrificed much more for the sake of dharma than a petty person like me, who is always eager to throw pebbles at them.  
  
The kashi vidvat-parishad has given a conservative and orthodox resolution and our true test of liberalism lies in how liberally we accept the orthodox positions and learn to live with them. Ultimately in Hinduism, nobody is coming with a sword in hand and forcing us to convert to their belief systems.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari pārṣāda dāsa.
