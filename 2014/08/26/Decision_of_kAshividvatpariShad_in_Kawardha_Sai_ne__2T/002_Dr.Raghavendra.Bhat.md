Respected Nityananda Mishra ji,

I am not understanding how Dharmasamsad etc s are rules every individuals shraddhaa/sadbhaavanaas?believing Saints and Saadhuus are depends on every individual.

and I am not understanding that why you are posting this in Vidvatparishat?

If you you are not agreeing Sai as a deity or saint, let it.why you hurting others?

I personally respects you and also believes Saint like Shirdi Sai..

So i am personally requesting you that pl. don't hurt any one like this.

(also thanks toAjit Gargeshwari)

  

Dhanyavaadah.
