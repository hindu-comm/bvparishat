Why should you advise scholars what to compose and what not to compose. Let peopled ecide what they want to chant or what they want to believe as long as they are within the frame work of law. That's my opinion if one wants to take it one can else one can leave it. Lets not post any thing on this list that will hurt the sentiments of others. Thanks
