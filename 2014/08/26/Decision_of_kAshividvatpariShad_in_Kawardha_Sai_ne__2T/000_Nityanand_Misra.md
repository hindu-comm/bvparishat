In the Dharmasaṃsad with representatives of 13 Akhāḍās yesterday at Kawardha, the Kāśīvidvatpariṣad gave the above decision on Sai Baba which was ratified by Śrī Svāmī Svarupānanda Sarasvatī.

I request influential scholars of Dharma on this forum to support and spread awareness about the decision of the Dharmasaṃsad and Kāśīvidvatpariṣad in their sermons and writings. Hopefully this will discourage Sanskrit scholars from composing Śāstraviruddha works like Shirdi Sai Suprabhatam/Sathya Sai Suprabhatam, and followers of Sanātana Dharma from visiting tombs/graves – a practice which saints like Tulasīdāsa disapproved of long ago –  

लही आँखि कब आँधरे बाँझ पूत कब ल्याइ। कब कोढ़ी काया लही जग बहराइच जाइ॥  

The world goes to Bahraich \[at the tomb of Salar Masud, hoping for miracles\], but did any blind person get eyes, did any childless woman get a son, did any leper get cured \[on going there\]?(Dohāvalī 496).

Scholars on this forum have also expressed their disapproval of chanting of Mantras like “Om Sai” or “Sai Ram”/”Sai Krishna” which is in vogue these days.  

Nityānanda
