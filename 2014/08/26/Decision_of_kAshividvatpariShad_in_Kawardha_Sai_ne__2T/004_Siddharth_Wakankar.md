Dear Mishraji,

  

You intend to discourage the Sanskrit scholars from composing Shaastraviruddha-works,but,we conveniently forget the fact that many Great Sanskrit Scholars compose poems on the Reigning Political Figures and manage to get Awards.Is it Shaastrasammata OR in consonance with our Glorious Tradition of Nisspruhatva-which was supposed to be the hall-mark of a SANSKRIT PANDIT? PHYSICALLY,WE BECAME INDEPENDENT,BUT,STILL,MENTALLY,WE ARE SLAVES.

MOREOVER,there were postings on the BVP in the recent past,objecting to some of the scholars getting Awards from the Govt.of India.Is it Shaastrasammata?

By the way,we cannot force or advise anybody to subscribe to our view only.It is his/her right and prerogative and it is better if others do not interfere with it.

I may be excused for pointing to some of the disturbing fallacies/facts about the Sanskrit Fraternity.

  

Dr Siddharth Wakankar
