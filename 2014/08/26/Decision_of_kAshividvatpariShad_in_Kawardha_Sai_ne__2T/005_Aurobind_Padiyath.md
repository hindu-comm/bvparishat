Dear Misraji,

I am really concerned about two things from your msg.

1\. The request from you to an act up on an improper thinking by the so called harbingers of Vedic wisdom. I thought the four Mattas were supposed to uphold the values of Adi Shanakara's Philosophy of Advaita. All the members are well educated to know what that means.

2\. Probably such an act once up on a time in history might have been the reason for offshoots of various cults or sects branching out of the main stream Hindu/Vedic tradition. If these are not understood properly soon we can see a Sai sect propping up with all its supporters.

to conclude I quote from Sri Bhagawd Gita:*Yo yo yāṁ yāṁ tanuṁ bhaktaḥ śraddhayārcitum, icchati tasya tasyācalāṁ śraddhāṁ tām eva vidadhāmy aham*(7.21)

and As Ajit mentioned leave it to the individual to choose his/her path.

Hari Om
