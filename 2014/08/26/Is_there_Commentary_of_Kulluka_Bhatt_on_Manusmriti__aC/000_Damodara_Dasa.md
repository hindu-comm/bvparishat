Hare Krishna,  
Dear Sirs,  
I am looking for english or hindi translation of Kulluka Bhatta's  
commentary on Manu Smriti. I do not know if this is done by someone or  
not. Please guide.  
I already have english translation of Medhatithi's commentary on  
Manusmriti done by Ganganath Jha.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
