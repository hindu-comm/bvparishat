I just reproduced the sutras from S'ikShaa and the English part was my English translation to a Hindi commentary. I did that to see your response and know your focus. Now that I know the focus of your question, let me tell you this:



ईषत्स्पृष्टाः is in contrast to स्पृष्टाः. The 25 consonants of the 5 groups : कवर्ग चवर्ग टवर्ग तवर्ग and पवर्ग are स्पृष्टाः . Among them , if you see, consonants of kavarga are कंठ्याः.Here स्पर्श is between the parts of the throat only. Similarly for ओष्ठ्याः also the touch is between lips only. So, in stead of taking karaṇa as tongue alone, it is better to take the oral muscle that moves touch the other muscle as karaṇa. The touched muscle , more precisely, the touched point of the muscle is sthāna. This helps to understand how य र ल व are ईषत्स्पृष्टकरणाः.



The meaning of 'semi-vowels' is not there either in the word अंतस्थाः or in the sutra ईषत्स्पृष्टाः.



र, ल can not be semi-vowels. य,व can be discussed as having features of vowels. य is related to the तालव्य vowels इ,ई,ए andवis related to ओष्ठ्यvowels उ,ऊ.



'Heat' isfound inthe etymological meaning given to the word 'ऊष्माणः'.ईषद्विवृतकरणाः is not the etymological meaning. It is the description of pronunciation of श, ष, स, ह .
