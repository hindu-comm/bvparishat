Dear Prof. Paturi,  
  
It will be a while before I can occupy myself carefully enough with the question you have asked. I have too many unfinished writing projects before me, although I will continue to contribute to BVP and other forums whenever I get a few minutes from other commitments and responsibilities. From the information KCC has gathered, it would seem that anta.hsthaa became a grammatical technical term between the time of the ;Satapatha-braahma.na and the early Praati;saakhyas, that its understanding as 'one which stands between' is older and that the reference through 'between' (anta.h/antar) is NOT to any items in the Pratyaahaara/Maahe;svara suutras occurring at the beginning of Paa.nini's A.s.taadhyaayii.  
  
a.a.
