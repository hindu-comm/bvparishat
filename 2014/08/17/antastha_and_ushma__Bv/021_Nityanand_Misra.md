Prof. Aklujkar and Prof. Paturi,

  

Both of you used or mentioned the termअन्तस्थ (different from अन्तःस्थ). Which grammar work uses the term अन्तस्थ (situated at the end)? Does any Pratishakhya use this term? As far as I remember the SK and LSK use अन्तःस्थ (situated in the middle) and not अन्तस्थ. अन्तस्थ would be a misnomer in the Paninian tradition as the letters are not at the end of the Siva Sutras.
