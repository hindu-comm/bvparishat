From the information KCC has gathered, it would seem that anta.hsthaa became a grammatical technical term between the time of the ;Satapatha-braahma.na and the early Praati;saakhyas, that its understanding as 'one which stands between' is older and that the reference through 'between' (anta.h/antar) is NOT to any items in the Pratyaahaara/Maahe;svara suutras occurring at the beginning of Paa.nini's A.s.taadhyaayii.  

That was my hunch. That is why I sought help with regard to chronology.



Thanks. Please take your time.
