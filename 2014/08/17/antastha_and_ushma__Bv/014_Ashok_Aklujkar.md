The terms have been discussed extensively in:  
Chatterji, Kshitish Chandra. 1964 (second edn) Technical Terms and Technique of Sanskrit Grammar, Part 1. Calcutta-19: Sibendranath Kanjilal,Sperintendent, Calcutta University Press, pp.245-249 and pp.270-274.  
  
What is to be particularly noted is that anta.hsthaa \[with visarga in the middle\] was the older form of antasthaa and that anta.hsthaa was a feminine noun.  
  
A relatively less misleading corruption occurred in the case of uu.sman. In the later period, it was mistaken to be u.sman by some authors.  
  
I do not know if any subsequent part of KCC's valuable work was published or if any manuscript or press copy of it exists. Some Kolkata-dwelling scholar should undertake an exploration and at least try to preserve the unpublished work of KCC.  
  
Many of the terms he discusses in the TTTSG were also discussed in elegant Sanskrit essays in the periodical Ma;njuu.saa or Sa.msk.rta-ma'njuu.saa that he used to edit. Compete sets of this periodical should be preserved at least in 2-3 places in India. Alphabetical indices (including the texts and authors to which KCC refers) of what is found in the Ma;njuu.saa and what is found in the TTTSG will also be useful.  
  
K.V. Abhyankar's \_A Dictionary of Sanskrt Grammar\_ (second edn 1977) gives brief accounts of anta.hsthaa and uu.sman on p. 28 and p. 94.
