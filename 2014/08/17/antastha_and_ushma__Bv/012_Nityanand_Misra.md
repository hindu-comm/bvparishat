Maheshwara/Panini had the foresight that Ashtadhyayi would be using Pratyaharas which would require placement of ha at two places. Refer the attachment which explains Laukika and Alaukika Prayojanas of using ha twice in the Siva Sutras.  
  
Wiebke Pieterson's PhD thesis anlaysis Siva Sutras from a mathematical perspective. One of her insights was assuming Panini would need to use the Pratyahaaras he has used, the repetition of ha is mathematically required for the optimal construction of Siva Sutras.
