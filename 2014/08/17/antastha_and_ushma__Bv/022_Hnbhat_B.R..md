I think both the forms अन्तःस्थ and अन्तस्थ could be the variant forms for the same word, in Sandhi, option for विसर्ग, due to the operation of the वार्तिक, "खर्परे शरि वा लोपो वक्तव्यः।" ( ८।३।३६) between अन्तः+स्थ.

  

अन्तः मध्ये तिष्ठतीति - both forms could be obtained, depending on the context of the use of अन्तस्थ. Just a note on the use without the विसर्ग also, if context requires.
