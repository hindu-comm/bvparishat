Sir,

  

I happened to read that antasthah are semi vowels which are in between vowels and consonants. Ushmas are those consonants which produce heat or kind of steam when pronounced.

When we speak about 'eeshatsprishta', while pronouncing the antastha 'va' there is no touch of tongue any where in the mouth.
