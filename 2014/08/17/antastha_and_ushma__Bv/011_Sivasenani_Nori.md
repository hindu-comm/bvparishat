Many scholars looked at this question. Mahabhashya and its subcommentaries have shown the usage of eight pratyaharas as the reason for repetition of "ha". Usage of four pratyāhāras aṬ, haŚ, aŚ and iṆ is the justification for the earlier "ha". Similarly, four more pratyāhāras viz. vaL, raL, jhaL and śaL are cited as justification for the latter "ha". Now, if in the interest of brevity, one of the "ha"s is dropped in the varṇasamāmnaya, then we would have to specify "ha" additionally in at least four sūtras \[1\]. Fritz Staal \[2\] after a long analysis essentially gives the same reason as Patanjali for the repetition of "ha". Cardona \[3\] and Kiparsky \[4\] have also analyzed the Sivasutras, but the repetition of "ha" is not the main focus of their effort. Wiebke Petersen \[5\] mathematically "proves" that repetition of at least one letter is inevitable and that repetition of "ha" is the most efficient.

  

Western linguists, say W. S. Allen (*Phonetics in Ancient India,* London, 1953, p20) classify "ha" as a glottal, whereas *ka-varga,* i.e. k, kh, g, gh and ṅ, is considered velar. On the other hand, Sanskrit grammarians describe "ha" as a *kaṇṭhya* along with *ka-varga.* This might boil down to whether the glottis and velum (places of pronunciation) are both part of what is called *kaṇṭha* in Sanskrit. This is not the only difference, though. Under certain circumstances, "ha" is held to be pronounced in the chest:

hakāraṃ pañcamairyuktam antasthābhiśca saṃyutam

aurasyaṃ taṃ vijānīyāt kaṇṭhyamāhurasaṃyutam (Pāṇinīyaśikṣā, 16)

(When "ha" is conjoined with the fifth letters, i.e. ṅa, ña, ṇa, na and ma, and with *antasthas,* i.e. ya, ra, la and va, it is pronounced in the chest\[6\](*aurasya*); when it is not conjoint with other letters, then it is said to be pronounced in the throat (*kaṇṭhya*)).

\[1\]In fact, it is more than four sūtras. As remarked by in his Chāyā: (idaṃ dikpradarśanam, madhuliṃhītyādau numsiddhaye 'napuṃsakasya' ityatrāpi tadgrahaṇam bodhyam.) This is only a pointer \[of how an additional "ha" would have to be supplied in many sūtras, and it is not an exhaustive list; for instance\] in "madhuliṃhi" for the sake of introducing the augment nUM, in the sūtra 7.1.72 napuṃsakasya jhalacaḥ also, "ha" would have to be included. \[Here jhaL is the pratyāhāra that is used\]. Each pratyāhāra is usually used in more than one sūtra (usually rules are productive, i.e. an abbreviation is made only if it is used in more than one sūtra – otherwise there is little point in introducing an additional intermediate term). Another example is seen in the derivation of "mahǡ hi saḥ" wherein the pratyāhāra aṬ is used in two sūtra, 8.3.9 (Step (1)) and 8.3.3 (Step (4)).
