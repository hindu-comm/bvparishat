Namaste Phani Ji,



Some of the great scholars have got personal weaknesses. One of the wonderful harikatha which became the hallmark in the history of harikatha literature is "girijA kalyanam" which was composed by Shri.Narayana Dasu Garu. The background for coming up of this masterpiece is very strange. Narayana Dasu Garu has the habit of taking intoxicant (surA). One day, Vizianagaram Maharaja summoned Sri.Dasu Garu and asked him to to compose a "hari katha". Sri.Dasu Garu, under the influence of surA-pAna, sarcastically remarked in telugu as "Emi katha cheppali - hari katha na giri katha na...?" (what should i tell whether "hari katha" or "giri katha"?) (this is a sarcastic pun intended which has two rythemic telugu words "hari" & "giri").



The Vizianagaram Maharaja, sensing the sarcastic joke from Narayana Dasu Garu didn't mind as he knew that Dasu Garu was under the influence of alcohol. So, the maharaja, too, sarcastically replied that "sarE lE ....giri kathE cheppa voyi.." (So be it ! Then compose "giri katha").
So, the sarcastic remark "giri-katha" took the form "girija-katha" ie., parvati parinayam.



The moment this was uttered, Sri.Narayana Dasu Garu, became alert and prostrated before the Maharaja. This typical incident became the nAndi for "girija-kalyanam".
