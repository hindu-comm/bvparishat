The word Harikatha has now become popular through Gaudiya Vaishnava platforms globally.



But the topic on hand is different from this. It is a performing art not limited to the narration of Vishnu stories.



Believed to haveevolved in Maharashtra during the time of Tukaram and Namdev, it was brought to Tamil Nadu by the Maratha rulers of Tanjore, toKerala by Swathi Thirunal who wrote a few scripts for Harikathas himself. Independent to this development, it is believed to have reached different other parts of South India, leading to various regional language versions of the same. Today it is one of the most vibrant performing arts of South India performed even abroad for the Indian diaspora. It employs Karnataka Sangita (classical Carnatic music).



What is interesting from the point of view of 1800-1950 Sanskrit literary creativity is that the colossal musician polyglot scholar Ajjada Adibhatla Narayana Dasu (1864-1945)who iscalled Harikathapitamaha for Telugu, composedand performed Harikathas in Sanskrit too. His three Harikatha Sanskrit texts are made into a book called Harikathamritam.



(His other Sanskrit works include Sanskrit translation of Omar Khayyam's Rubayiyat and Taarakam an original allegorical poem. His Rubayiyat translation published along with the English one by Edward Fitzgerald(1934)received wide acclaim.)
