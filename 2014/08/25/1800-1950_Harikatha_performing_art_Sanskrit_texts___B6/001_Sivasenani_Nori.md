Another work of Adibhatta Narayana Dasu (అజ్జాడ ఆదభట్ట నారాయణ దాసు) deserves mention: Navarasatarangini (నవరసతరంగిణి) or "The Beauties of Shakespeare and Kalidasa". In this he compares kaavyas (stretches of text, to put it in English) from Shakespeare and Kalidasa covering the nine rasas. Ostensibly this was meant for the Telugu-speaking public to appreciate both these poets, and compare them if they wish to do so. So he translates these kaavyas into Telugu, mostly verse confirming to the rules of prosody. A further notable aspect is that he uses graamya-telugu or jaanu-tenugu rather than using tatsama-words (resorting to them only when absolutely necessary) and then since these pure Telugu words are not well understood by most Telugu speakers, he included a glossary of these difficult jaanu Telugu words explained in the spoken Telugu (full of tatsama words).

  

Unlike modern comparative studies which are long on analysis and short on examples, this book has hardly 75 pages of analysis (in some 600 pages or so, not counting short summaries of Shakespeare's works in Telugu and Telugu-Telugu glossary) and a huge number of examples, in the region of about 100 kaavyas for each rasa (594 examples in English, 231 in Sanskrit - per the preface). The English text is in Roman script, and the Sanskrit text is in Telugu script.

  

The politics behind the book is equally interesting. Three colleges in Vijayanagaram (Vizianagaram) were famous in early twentieth century - English, Sanskrit and Music colleges. Our author was the Principal of the last mentioned, and was piqued that he did not get the same respect as that of the Principals of the other two colleges, who were assumed to be more learned. This work, then, was a tour-de-force by the author to showcase his knowledge of Sanskrit, English and accha-telugu. The book was first published in 1922 and then re-issued in 1979 by Smt. Karra Syamala Devi, Guntur. (Please write to me off-line if you want a digital copy).

  

The interest on this list would be the existence of the comprehensive (covering all the works of the two poets) comparative study of Shakespeare and Kalidasa. This (comprehensive study of two masters, selection of texts, translation, glossary, proof-reading and publishing) was done in about 3 years, and without disrespect to the great man, sometime this shows. For instance, the advice of Polonius to his son set to go to France (the one with the famous line "neither a lender nor a borrower be") is cited under Karuna-rasa.

  

Readers can themselves see the quality of his poetry. Here is a sample translation from English to Sanskrit (he gave a few examples of these as well)  
  

Original (*King John,* Act 4, Scene 2, speech of Salisbury)

  

To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,  
To throw a perfume on the violet,  
To smooth the ice, or add another hue  
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light  
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,  
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.

  

Adibhatta Narayana Dasu's translation:

  

शा. स्वर्णे हेमविलेपनं समधिके रक्तोत्पले रञ्जनं

चाम्पेयप्रसवे सुगन्धलेपनं हैमोपले लेपनम्।

देवेन्द्रस्य शरासने समुदिते वर्णान्तरप्रापणं

दीपेनार्करुचिप्रदीपनमतिव्यर्थम्प्रहास्पदम् ॥

  

ద్వి. బంగరుపూఁత మే-ల్బంగారమునకుఁ,

జెంగలువకు రంగు-సేఁత నెత్తావి

సురపున్న కెరవుు తె-చ్చుట, మంచుగడ్డ

మఱి నున్పు సేయుట,- మరియెక రంగు

నగవైరి వింట నొ-నర్చుట, పట్ట

పగలు వెలింగెడు-భానుని కాంతి

హెచ్చింపఁ జేవత్తి-నెత్తిపట్టటయు

నచ్చవు నగుఁబాటు-నధికము వృథయు.  

  

It is good that we are celebrating the Indian genius a week or so after the Sanskrtotsavasaptaaha.
