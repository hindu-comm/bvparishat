Another Harikatha performer who continued the tradition of writing Harikatha texts in Sanskrit was Paturi Madhusudana Shastry. He wrote and performedParvati Kalyanam in Sanskrit.



These are the words about him in a book "History and Culture of Andhras" by M N Sarma and M V Shastry:



In the late 40fs came a new generation of hariddsas, who rendered the musical narration  
adhering to the general format of the art. Among them two Bhagavatars stand out. The first  
one was Paturi Madhusudana Sastry, a scholar in Sanskrit and Telugu and also in Puranas  
and Upanlshads\* Known as 'Panditha Haridasa Hamsa', his hari-katha rendering was a literary  
debate, with dramatization as its major innovation. His "Parvathi Parinayam", written by himself  
both in Sanskrit and Telugu was justly famous.
