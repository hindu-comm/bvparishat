We discussed Sri Kapali Shastri and his novel approach to Vedas in thread



<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/modernity/bvparishat/d-wPUry6MQU/x1aw8HZv6cYJ>



There I said in one of the posts of the thread:



A contemporary of Kavyakantha Vashishtha Ganapatimuni is Sri Kapali Shastri. His Rig Veda Bhashya Siddhanjana is another Sanskrit work in continuation of the Veda Bhashya traditionin the style of his times.



In a later post of the same thread I added:



Through the transnational interest in Sri Ramana Maharshi's thought, even the works ofSri Kavyakantha Vasishtha Ganapatimuni received transnational attention.



A similar interest in Sri Aurobindo introduced Sri Kapali Shastri to the readers across the nations.



I am happy to see that there is now such a trend setting work by Dr Kashyap inspired by Sri Aurobindo-Kapali Shastri approach.



Thanks to The Hindu for covering this.



Thanks to aadaraNIya RN Iyengar for bringing this to the notice of the BVP forum.
