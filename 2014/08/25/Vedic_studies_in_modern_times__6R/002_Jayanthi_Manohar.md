Namaskarams to Dr.Nagaraj Paturi and Scholars of B.V.Parishat,  
  
I am happy to learn that Kapali Shastri and his novel approach to Veda was discussed in this forum. I am awarded PhD for my thesis on 'Symbolism of Rigveda with special reference to Siddhanjana of Kapali Shastri' under the guidance of Prof.R.L.Kashyap.  
  
Please see my articles on 'Sri Aurobindo's vision of Vedic Gods' both in English and Kannada. I have also attached a file on Salient features of my book, "Symbolism of Rigveda - Social, Ethical and Spiritual import of Veda" that was published last year.  
  
with Regards,  
  
Jayanthi Manohar
