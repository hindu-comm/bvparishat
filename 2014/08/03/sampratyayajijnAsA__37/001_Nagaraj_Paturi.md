Dear Sir,



Do you have more information on the details of reference?



If it is प्राप्तः in mādhava nidāna samhitā , you must be knowing in the nidāna of which rōga , this is found.



Most of the sampratyaya is known through this information itself.



If some other sourceinformed you that it is from mādhava nidāna samhitā , please provide the details provided by the source and context in the source.



More details of reference will be helpful in helping you with the sampratyaya.





Regards,



Nagaraj
