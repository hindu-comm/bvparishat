This is in the 39th chapter of chikitsāsthāna of suśrutasamhitā.



Though the subject matter of the 39th chapter is called āturōpadravachikitsitam , the discussion is centred around agnimāndya.



The chapter where the verse occurs in mādhavanidānasamhitā also is centred around agnimāndya.only.



The versediscussing one of the important causesof agnimāndya , interestingly is discussed in the treatment section of suśrutasamhitā and the book on diagnosis. Probably because cause is important in both aspects of medicine.



In fact, suśruta in the very next verse highlights the identification of cause by saying,



SS4.39.38/ vyaapadaaM kaaraNaM viikSya vyaapatsvetaasu buddhimaan/  
prayatetaaturaarogye pratyaniikena hetunaa//



Numerous praṇāmas and many thanks to Swamiji for the suśrutasamhitā reference.
