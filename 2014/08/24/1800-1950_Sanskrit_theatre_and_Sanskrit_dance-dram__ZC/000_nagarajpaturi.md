It is well known that Koodiyaattam of keralahas beena Sanskrit dance-drama form. Many Sankrit literary texts were brought into performance through this form.



Kathakali too employs many Sanskrit texts.



Maharaja Swathi Thirunal who encouraged the evolution of Mohini Attam contributed to the employment of Sanskrit texts in the dance-form.



The decline of these art forms during post-Swathi period was soon countered by the great efforts of Valatthol Narayana Menon. In 1927, that *Vallathol Narayana Menon* and Mukunda Raja came forward and formed a society called Kerala Kalamandalam. They solicited donations from the public and conducted a lottery in order to raise funds for this society. Kerala Kalamandalam was inaugurated in November 1930 at [*Kunnamkulam*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunnamkulam "Kunnamkulam"), and was later shifted to the village of [*Cheruthuruthy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheruthuruthy "Cheruthuruthy"), just south of [*Shoranur*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoranur "Shoranur") in 1933



Sanskrit literary tradition being brought into performing art form got revived through such efforts.



Even modern Kerala theatre continues to be performing Sankrit plays unlike in theotherlanguage areasof the country such as the Bengali andTelugu areas, whereperformance of Sankrit plays which was vibrant during the late 19th century gradually gave way to regional language plays.



This whole environment lead to the emergence of new Sanskrit literary texts specially created for the purpose of performance in Kerala.
