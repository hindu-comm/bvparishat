Dear Friends,

  

I am searching for the Issues for the years 1920-1930 A.D. of the Journal "Vedic Magazine-Gurukula Samachar",which used to be published from Lahore.It was run by the Arya Samaj scholars.

  

Any information about its availability in any Library/Organisation in India will be welcome.

  

I request scholars to favour me with this piece of information and oblige.

  

Thanks and regards,

  

Prof Siddharth Wakankar(91-9427339942)
