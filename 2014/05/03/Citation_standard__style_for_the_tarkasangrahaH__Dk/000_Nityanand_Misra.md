Dear scholars,  
  

Is there a standard or a recommended style for citing the Tarkasaṅgrahaḥ? I saw different numbering and divisions of the texts on different sources. What is the most common style of citing from this work?  
  

\(1\) The publication with the Nyāyabodhinī and Padakṛtya commentaries (1919: Nirnay Sagar Press) does not have any numbering of stanzas or divisions of the text, though it has an index with topics.  

  

\(2\) The copy on Sanskrit Wikisource (link below) divides the text into four Prakaraṇas and some sub-Prakaraṇas.  
[http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/तर्कसङ्ग्रहः](http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/तर्कसङ्ग्रहः)  

The source publication is not given, but by looking at the names of the divisions, I can guess they must be from some published source.  
  

\(3\) Another digital copy of the work (link below) numbers all paragraphs sequentially (1 to 81). Again the source publication is not given. I have used this numbering in the past (but not sure if that is any good).

Thanks
