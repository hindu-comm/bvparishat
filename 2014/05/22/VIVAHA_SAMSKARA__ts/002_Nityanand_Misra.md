Congrats for the publication.  
  
Is it possible to share some sample pages?  
  
Is a Kindle/Ebook edition planned?  
  
Also, does the book cover the position of the Grḥya Sūtras with respect to Sapiṇḍa Vivāhas? I believe different sources define Sapiṇḍa differently. The Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 has this definition -  
  
(f) (i) “ sapinda relationship” with reference to any person extends as far as the third generation (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the mother, and the fifth (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the father, the line being traced upwards in each case from the person concerned, who is to be counted as the first generation;  
(ii) two persons are said to be “sapindas” of each other if one is a lineal ascendant of the other within the limits of sapinda relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them;
