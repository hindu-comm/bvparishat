Dear Dr Anil Kumar,

Hearty congratulations to you and M/S D.K. Print World for publishing the valuable book entitled Vivaha Samskara. You specially know how interested was I for its publication since your earning Ph.D on this topic and I expressed my earnest desire for bringing out of this volume at the earliest in the National Seminar on the Indian Marriage system. Now I am very happy that the book is out for the scholars interested in the subject. Looking forward to releasing more publications and congratulating you once again,  

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
