Ācārya



Could it be a commentary or subcommentary on the Nyāyalīlāvatī (NL) of Mahāprabhu Vallabhācārya? The introduction to the 1934 edition of the NL (published by Chowkhambha Sanskrit Series, Varanasi) lists seven commentaries on NL (Viveka, Rahasya, Vibhūti, two different commentaries named Prakāśa, Vardhamānendu, and Kaṇṭhābharaṇa), as well as subcommentaris Rahasya, Vivṛti and Dīdhiti on the Prakāśa. No work by the name Upāya in this list.



Or could it be a reference to Upāya(s) as treated or discussed in the NL?



If you can help with the precise quotation where the work is referred to, it might be easier to trace with the context. I do not know of a digitally searchable edition of the Bhūṣaṇasāraḥ (there must be one for this classic).
