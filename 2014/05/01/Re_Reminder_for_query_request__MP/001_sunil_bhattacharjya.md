Dear friends,

  

The Krittikadi system was based on a total of 28 nakshatras in the Zodiac. . The Mahabaharata tells us about the time when Indra tells Krittika's son that the star Abhijit had fallen, that is, the total number of star in Zodiac got reduced to 27 nkshatras.

  

Regatds,

Sunil KB
