Dear Dr. Mishra,

  

You have raised an important point that needs wider discussion. Indeed the Jyotisha of the Vedic texts is Nakshatra based, which were visible entities in the sky. How this slowly became Rashi based, with little connection with stars, is an intersting point for research. Here again there are two aspects: First is the astronomical-jyotisha the second: "Phalita". My investigation is on the first part and hence I am not able to enlarge on the Phalita issues. As you have rightly pointed out, the Dashas start with Sun in Krttika (इनशशि कुज राहु .....कृत्तिकादि क्रमेण ). The understanding here about nakshatra is the birth star with which Moon is associated, clearly a Vedic concept. Perhaps this corresponds to an ancient Phalita-jyotisha system when the equinoctial point was near Krttika. Or the inventor of the Dasha system, intelligently equated Krttika and Sun

  

About the type of Jyotisha studied in the Universities, I wish they seriously study Vedaanga-Jyotisha of Lagadha, Parashara & Vrddha-Garga (quoted by Bhattotpala) as well as Suuryaprajn\~apti. This will enable them to see the difference that exists between present day Indian astrology and the ancient Vedic period concepts. Fortunately several traditional scholars know this. Currently I am reading the वेदाङ्गज्योतिष with the commentary of Somaakara edited by Pandit Acharya Kaundinyayana of Nepal with his Sanskrit and Hindi commenatry. The issues raised by the learned Acharya are very revealing. He has rightly pointed out how the Vedic new year which was linked with the Udagayana-day got shifted to a Chaitradi system by Siddhanta-jyotisha followers. He also demonstartes how Lagadha's scheme can be used for generating a Vedic calendar in tune with Vedic texts even now.

  

Apart from the Nakshatras which you have mentioned we have to know how 'tithi' was determined in the Vedic period. The definition of 12 degree separation is a late concept. Pt.Kaundinyayana argues Brahmagupta was not correct in criticizing Lagadha when he wrote (ब्र . सि . 11.2)

युगमाहुः पञ्चाब्दं रविशशिनोः संहिताङ्गकारा यत् \| अधिमासा-अवमरात्रस्फुटतिथ्यज्ञानतः तदसत् \|\|

  

Some of the Siddhanta ideas are more scientific, and accurate mathematicallyby definition.But from a doctrinaire point of view they are**Avaidika**. This has over centuries led to our Panchangas printing in black and white wrong information and get away with it!

  

Thanks for the searching questions which are too important for our cultural ethos. I have only offered some discussion with my admittedly limited knowledge of Jyotisha. It is for the specialist scholars to carry this further.

  

best regards

  

Narayana Iyengar
