Dear Sri Padiyath,



You make valid points, but let me hasten to add that the purpose of this archive is not to encourage people to disregard adhikAra bheda, nor to disregard the need for a traditional guru. It is not as if anyone can simply read the prasthAna traya source texts and/or their Sankaran commentaries at random and hope to understand everything that is contained in them.



The Sringeri Matha always emphasizes a very rigorous plan of traditional study, but was one of the earliest publishers of a comprehensive set of Sankaracharya's works among the traditional institutions. Advaita Sharada, the new searchable and internally hyperlinked text archive, is not geared towards the dilletante reader. It is only meant to be a resource for the serious scholar, whethertraditional or modern, such as the members of this and similar fora. In the 20th century, such a personwould have gone toa libraryor to the nearest Ramakrishna Math bookstore,gotall the bhAshyas and their translations in print and kept them all ready on the desk, to open as and when needed.In the 21st century, the printed book is increasingly yielding way tothe electronic text and this archive aims to be a comprehensive resource in this format, that is all.Atraditional guru could use it as a teaching aid and the serious scholar can use it as a reference resource. If they do, that would be the best realization of its goal.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
