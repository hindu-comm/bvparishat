I just realized that I had made an error in an announcement to BVP about the first release of the Advaita Sharada archive, back in 2014.

  

The work of editing and annotating vaktavyakASikA was done by Dr. M. L. Narasimha Murthy, a vedAnta vidvAn. I had typed in a wrong name and didn't notice it till now. This text is included in the updates that were released last week.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
