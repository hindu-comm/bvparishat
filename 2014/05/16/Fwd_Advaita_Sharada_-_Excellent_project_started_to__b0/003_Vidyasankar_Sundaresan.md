namo vidvadbhyaH,



Over the last two decades, Sri Shankara Advaita Research Center at Sringeri (<http://www.sringeri.net>) has been making steady progress in digitizing the record archives of the Sringeri Sarada Peetham and getting out rare Advaita texts in print. One example is the first printing ofvaktavyakASikA, a pre-vivaraNa commentary by uttamajna yati on the pancapAdikA, padmapAda's partial commentary on Sankara's brahmasUtra bhAshya, edited with critical comments andfootnotes by the fine young vidvAn, Sri Naveen Holla.



Meanwhile, Sriranga Digital Software Technologies, based out of Mysore/Srirangapatna, has been involved in many projects that would be of general interest to members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat. For example, they have made available, inelectronic format, a number of publications brought out by various important Indian institutions, including the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and Sri Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Prof. Yogananda Sastry, the founder of Sriranga Digital, has put together a dedicated team with capabilities of a high order in optical character recognition, text editing and Unicode encoding. If you can read Kannada script, you can get an idea of some oftheir work at <http://www.sirinudi.org/index.php>.



Both institutions had separately started working on creating digital versions ofSankara's prasthAna traya bhAshyas a few years ago. Independently,I had proposed that to truly understand Sankara, scholars should step away from viewing his commentaries as if they were individual books and should instead read them in an interconnected fashion, much like how one would follow through hyperlinked material on a web portal. This idea is described in some detail in my article (SAnkara granthAH katham otAH protAS ca?), which appeared in a felicitation volume in honor of Prof. Rukmani, announced here a year ago.

In Dec 2012, during the time that the Sringeri Jagadguru, Swami Bharati Tirtha, was staying in Hyderabad,I had passed along this hyperlinking idea toboth Sri Anandfrom the Sringeri Research Centerand Prof. Yogananda of Sriranga Digital, with the suggestion that an electronic archive of these seminal texts would have much added value if this hyperlinking were incorporated in a consistent manner as well. Interestingly enough, these conversations happened on a day when I met one of the leading lights of BVP, Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam, in person, thanks to the good offices of Sri Siva Senani Nori, another member of BVP.



Things have progressed very well over the last year and a half. The Sringeri Peetham and Sriranga Digisoft have pooled their resources and their work together, resulting in a high quality electronic archive of the prasthAna traya bhAshyas. Not onlythe hyperlinking concept, but alsovarious other features, such as incorporation of audio files and search functionalities,have been implemented beautifully. Using the electronic archive now available at <http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net>, it is possible for a scholar to navigate seamlessly from one bhAshya to another and back, through the hyperlinked vishaya-vAkya-s and other source text citations. Some upanishat texts like kaushItakI and SvetASvatara, which Sankaraoften cites but has not commented upon, have been made available as basic source texts, without any commentary.This archive is the first comprehensive online resource that collects all thecentral Sankaran commentaries in one place, in one self-consistent format that is easy to read, rendered in contemporary Devanagari script.It was released online by the Sringeri Acharya just a couple of weeks ago, on the occassion of this year's Sankara Jayanti.



A very useful search function has alsobeen included in this release. For example, one could search for the term "Anandamaya" in one or more bhAshyas and correlate what they say, from taittirIya and mANDUkya upanishad bhAshyas to the AnandamayAdhikaraNa and AnandAdyadhikaraNa in the sUtra bhAshya. Or, one could search for "citta vRtti nirodha" or "samAdhi" and find out what is said about yoga in these various texts. Thus,whether through use of the hyperlinks encoded into the archive or just by using the search functionor perhaps usingboth features, one can gain a more comprehensive view of what Sankara says about a particular topic than the usual methods adopted hitherto with printed publications. The online archive is geared to help both a paNDita/mumukshu in a traditional instructional context and the academic critical scholar in a modern university context.Needless to say, such an approach could be applied across the board to other fields as well, whichwould greatly aid the study of vast amounts of Indian knowledge material. Personally, I am immensely pleased that the Sringeri Sarada Peetham, in keeping with its central historical legacy in the Sankaran tradition,is the first official provider of this online content in the service of the advaita vedAnta darSana.

  
In order to regulate user traffic and authenticate access, a user registration is required. I request BVP members to make use of the archive and pass along your valuable criticalfeedback. Itwill be very highly appreciated and used to improve the archive content and its usability. The material already available is certainly a vital starting point at this junctureand plans are already on to add to it and improve itover the near future.

  
With best regards,

Vidyasankar
