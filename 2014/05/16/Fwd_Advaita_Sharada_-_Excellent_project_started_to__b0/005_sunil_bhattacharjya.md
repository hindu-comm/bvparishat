It is no denying that one should read the prasthana-trayas. However don't you think that the Bhagavad Gita has its own highest status and can be regarded as a stand-alone text, if we are to accept the following statement in the Gita-Mahatmya from the Varaha Purana and that Shankara-bhshya on the Bhagavad Gita too must not have undermined that status of the Bhagavad Gita ?

  

"Geetaa sugeetaa kartavyaa kimanyaih sashtra vistaraih yaa svayam Padmanaabhasya mukhapadmaad vinishritaa."

  

  

Regards,

Sunil KB
