Where is the stand-alone nature of Bhagavadgita contradicted in the quotedwords of Sri Vidyashankarji? Where was there anyक्षति to the greatness of Bhagavadgita in these words ?:



"I had proposed that to truly understand Sankara, scholars should step away from viewing his commentaries as if they were individual books and should instead read them in an interconnected fashion, much like how one would follow through hyperlinked material in a web portal."



His words are very clearly about Shankara's commentaries but not the original texts. Inter-textuality of a commentator's various commentariesgoes without saying. That there is a need to understand an author through a holistic, comprehensive and integratedunderstanding of his different worksdeserves no denial.



That said, एकवाक्यता among various original Vedic texts themselvesin general and the three members of Prasthaanatraya in particular is to be comprehended and recognized without any विरोध to the greatnessof each of those texts.



Bhagavtpada Shankaracan certainly help us comprehend thisएकवाक्यता among the original Vedic texts.



Sri Vidyashankarji is alerting us to pay attention to the एकवाक्यता among various commentaries of Shankara.



Regards,



Nagaraj
