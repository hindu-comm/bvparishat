Dear Vidyasankarji,

  

Thank you for your reply.

  

As regards the Jnana and Karma, there is this simplified statement that
even the gods are jealous of the human birth. It is the human birth alone that not only gives us the scope to acquire / attain Jnana, but also to practise living as a Jnani, that is, to perform Karma as appropriate to the Jnana (of the Jnani), in this Karma-bhoomi. Just acquiring Jnana without practising to live a life appropriate to that Jnana, makes the Jnana practically useless. The Jnani cares for others as much as for himself and his action reflects that and that is also the acid test for the Jnana.

  

Regards

Sunil KB
