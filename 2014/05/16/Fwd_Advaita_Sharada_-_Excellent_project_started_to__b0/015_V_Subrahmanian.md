This resource can be used beneficially by non-advaitin scholars/sadhakas too. Whenever they wish to know what the ShAnkaran/Advaitic interpretation of a particular upanishadic mantra/brahmasutra/bhagavadgita verse, they can easily obtain it in this facility. They can search for advaitic interpretations/explanations of concepts like avidyA, bhrama, aikya, etc. through the search/find facility and use the parts of the bhashya in their essays, notes, articles, books, talks, discussion posts, etc. Since the copy facility is available the use of the resource is immense.
