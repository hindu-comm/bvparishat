Dear Vidyashankarji,

  

I appreciate your views and also would like to add that many of the objections raised in the Bhashyas were to systems prevalent then and was to make those who blindly was thinking that thier's are the only true path to Moksha.  
I do not think Sankara himself has objected to those practices, but guided them saying it is due to Adhikari bheda. While acknowledging the existences of those various teachings and practices, Sankara had also guided them to move forward by showing the fallacies of those teachings and practices as not the culminating one in Moksha. Saying Karma is in the realm of Ajnana or Avidya which in turn gives rise to Kama that which prompts to further Karma and becomes a vicious cycle. And since the products of Kama and Karma lead you away from the Truth only uprooting of Avidya will end the cycle. So all are justified until that happens.

A doctor conducting surgery on a flying elephant is fully justified in dream but will hold no waters in waking and the same surgery on a organ in waking has no existence or any pain in deep sleep. All three states are in Avidya and only Jnana of the Paramarthata will expose the fact of those three states.

So learning the Prasthanathraya also has to be done in proper stages and system so that the Sadhaka is taken from Kindergarten to Masters. Reading those or studying them at random will only give rise to confusion.

Hari Om!!

  

Aurobind
