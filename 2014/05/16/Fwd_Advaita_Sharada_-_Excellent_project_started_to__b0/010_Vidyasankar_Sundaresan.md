Dear Sunilji,



Please note, I'm not saying that reading the Sankara bhAshyas in a hyperlinked manner is theonly way to read the Sankara bhashyas. I'm saying that while people are used to viewing them onlyas standalone texts, a more comprehensive understanding of Sankara can be developed if one reads the various commentaries in an interconnected manner.



For example, those who think advaita vedAnta just completely rejects yoga start (and often end)with the bhAshya on the sUtra that says etena yogaH pratyuktaH. Their horizons would be widened if they appreciated the fact that a number of other sources within the main prasthAna traya bhAshya corpus say a number of different things about yoga, in appropriate contexts.



Another example: those who point to the extreme contrast between karmA and jnAna in the Sankaran system may find a few surprises if they search the bhAshyas for what Sankara says about niyama vidhi as opposed to apUrva vidhi in the context of jnAna.



I hope the nuance in the approach for study purposes is clear. All this has nothing to do with the status of the Gita as the permier Smriti prasthAna within vedAnta itself.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
