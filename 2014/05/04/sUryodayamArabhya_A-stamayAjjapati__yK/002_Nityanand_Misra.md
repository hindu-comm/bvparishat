Thanks for confirming the Bālamanoramā reading. I am still doubtful about the Saṁhitā (or its lack) in original reading - I am not sure of the Saṁhitā has been split in the Bālamanoramā for elucidation or if the Saṁhitā is absent in the original source for prosodic reasons or Avivakṣā.

Yes, but is not Avīcī a hell as per the Buddhist texts? Or is it a hell as per Vedic texts also? I doubt if many Buddhist works were composed before Patañjali, so the quotation may not be in the MBh after all.
