"It**will be nice if any scholar of this august forum *can elaborate on this*

  

***or*** give the necessary references for one to look up".

  

I found an elaborate explanation by one Gulab Kothari on a certain website.<http://www.gulabkothari.com/?p=1486>

  

Attached here is the pdf of the same. There are no references given here.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
