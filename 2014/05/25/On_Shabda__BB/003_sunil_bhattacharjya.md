Thank you Nagarajji for the reply. I feel that it would have been good if Dr. Kothari would have cared to give references to ancient literature, to back up what he wrote.  
  
Another view is that the eight pranas could be very aptly linked to the eight prakritis also and that can also explain the link of the eight pranas to the rebirths etc. Some think that the eight grahas are the eight pranas, considering the Rahu and Ketu of Astrology (Swarbhanu of the ancient texts) are considered together as one graha while the Ketu of the Navagrahastotra is really Dhumketu.
