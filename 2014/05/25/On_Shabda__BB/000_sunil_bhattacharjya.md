Dear friends,  
  

My apologies for the wrong spelling of the subject itself, in the previous mail on this topic..  

  

I have seen some question on language such as the question of speech (vak) being raised in the notion of "that composed of eight kinds of praana" as the agent for transmigration. The birth of descendents has also reportedly been influenced by speech". It will be nice if any scholar of this august forum can elaborate on this or give the necessary references for one to look up.  
  

Regards,  
Sunil KB.
