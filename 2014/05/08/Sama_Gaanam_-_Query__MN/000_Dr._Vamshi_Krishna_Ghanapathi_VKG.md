Dear Sri Subrahmanyam garu

  

Can you shed some light on the position of Meemaamsa Shastra and Vyakarana on the topic of Saama Gaanam - Pourusheya/ Apourusheyataa.

  

Some people opine that Prakruti Gaana (Graame Geya Ganam and Aaranye Geya Gaanam) are Apourusheya; but Ooha Gaanam and Oohya are Pourusheya as they follow the patterns of Prakruti. Being Vikruti is Pourusheya is the stated position in other Vedas, as Vikruti means change.

  

This is the basis for this opinion. Does Maha Bhaashya and Bhaatta Deepika/ Shaabara Bhaashya contain any references on this topic??

  
With Warm Regards  
Dr.Vamshi K Ghanapaathi
