I hope Prof. Shankarji Jha raised the query in the context of Perceptual cognition. So let us not go away from the context. In that context the term sannikarsha is 'type' and samyoga is 'token'. The term sannikarsha stands for six types of laukika and three types of alaukika sambandha between indriya and artha. samyoga 'contact' is one of the six laukika sambandhas. In Nyayashastra like in any other shastra, terms are used in a defined sense and one has to understand in terms of that definition. The term sannikarsha is defined as pratyaksha-janaka-sambandha 'a relation that generates perceptual cognition' . The term for pratyaksha-janaka-sambandha-samanya is sannikarsha and pratyaksha-janaka-sambandha-vishesha is samyoga ' contact' . Hope, Prof. Shankarji Jha wanted to know this. Isn't it ?
