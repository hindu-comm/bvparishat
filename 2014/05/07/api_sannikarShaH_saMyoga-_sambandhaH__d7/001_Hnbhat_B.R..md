सन्निकर्षः is a technical term, and it has been divided into six types:

  

भारद्वाजोद्योतकरेण न्यायवार्तिके स्पष्ट्यकारि \| यथा - “संनिकर्षः पुनः षोढा भिद्यते, संयोगः, संयुक्तसमवायः, संयुक्तसमवेतसमवायः, समवायः, समवेतसमवायः, विशेषणविशेष्यभावश्चेति" (न्या.वा.१९९) इति

  

according to the relation between the related things. and संयोग is one of the relations with which the the contact between the इन्द्रिय and अर्थ-s are related according to Nyayashastra. And there are two opinions about the contract of इन्द्रिय-s, with their अर्थ-s, प्राप्यकारित्व and अप्राप्यकारित्व. संयोग is a common term and generally be used, but I am not sure it can be used in the above इन्द्रियार्थसंनिकर्ष alternatively.The six types of संनिकर्ष is considered as लौकिकसंनिकर्ष and the अलौकिकसंनिकर्ष of Yogin's is different and do not need physical contact and could not be divided into six. This is the position of न्यायशास्त्र basically.

  

Others may through light in this matter. Here are different opinions on संनिकर्ष ---
