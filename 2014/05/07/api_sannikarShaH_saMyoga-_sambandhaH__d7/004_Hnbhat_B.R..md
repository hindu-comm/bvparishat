संनिकर्षः 1 Drawing near, bringing near. -2 Vici- nity, proximity; presence; उत्कण्ठते च युष्मत्संनिकर्षस्य U.6; Ku.3.74; R.7.8;6.2. -3 Connection, relation. *-4 (In Nyāya phil.)* Connection of an organ of sense (इन्द्रिय) with its object (विषय); this is of six kinds; स भूतसूक्ष्मेन्द्रियसंनिकर्षम् Bhāg.2.2.3. -5 A modern object or idea; वेदांश्चैके संनिकर्षं पुरुषाख्या MS.1.1.27 (Śabara explains संनिकर्षम् as संनिकृष्टकालाः कृतका वेदा इदानींतनाः).  

  

Literal translation without context, would mostly mislead the meaning out of context in the case of technical terms.
