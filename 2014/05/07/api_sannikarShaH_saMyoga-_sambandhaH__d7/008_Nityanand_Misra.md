Sannikarṣa has in the past been translated into English as Proximity or Intercourse (the latter term is used by Jībānanda Vidyāsagara). The term Intercourse, which originally comes from Latin inter-currere ("to run between"), may be avoided as these days it is mostly used in the sense of coitus.

I am not sure if the use of the term Sannikarṣa in Nyāya works is limited to the context of Indriya and Artha. If it is exclusive to this context, then one may say Sannikarṣa is the proximity of the Indriya and Artha which gives rise to Pratyakṣa Jñāna (direct perception). If the term Sannikarṣa is used in other contexts to, then this definition has Avyāptidoṣa. As Saṃyoga is only one of the six types of Sannikarṣa, the term “contact” (used for Saṃyoga) may be avoided in the defintion of
Sannikarṣa unless accompanied by other five types of Sannikarṣa.

Finally Saṃyoga may be better translated as Conjunction, a term that has been employed in the past. I find it apter than Contact, for the reason stated below as a dialogue.

Me: From the Tarkasaṅgraha – संयुक्तव्यवहारहेतुः संयोगः। संयोगो द्विविधः कर्मजः संयोगजश्चेति। आद्यो हस्तक्रियया हस्तपुस्तकसंयोगः। द्वितीयो हस्तपुस्तकसंयोगात्कायपुस्तकसंयोगः। And also, चक्षुषा घटप्रत्यक्षजनने संयोगः सन्निकर्षः। With these two, what type of Saṃyoga exists between the Indriya eye and the Artha pitcher? Surely this is not physical contact - there is no contact in the sense of kaṭe āste (sits on a mat). Then why do we use contact for Saṃyoga?

Respondent: As per modern science it is the light (visible spectrum) emitted from a light source which is reflected from the pitcher and then comes in contact with the cornea. So one may say there is contact between pitcher and light, and then contact between light and cornea, contact between cornea and anterior chamber, anterior chamber and eye lens, and so on till the retina. So there is indirect contact between pitcher and eye which is the second type of Saṃyoga (संयोगो द्विविधः कर्मजः संयोगजश्चेति).

Me: You spoke well, but no point mixing modern science with Nyāya, they contradict each other at many places. Let us stick with Nyāya for the moment.

Respondent: We shall then say there is contact between the Artha pitcher and Tejas (as Rūpa is Pākaja in Pṛthvī or earth element - रूपादिचतुष्टयं पृथिव्यां पाकजमनित्यं च), and then contact between Tejas and eye, which is a Saṃyogaja Saṃyoga.

Me: Good argument. But what about visual perception of flowing water then as there Rūpa is not Pākaja (अन्यत्रापाकजम्)?

Respondent: Okay, maybe there is no physical contact. But even then we may use the term Contact. We all use the term “eye contact” without meaning physical contact. You also notice it when you interview people.

Me: “Eye contact” is a special term in English which refers to the action where two individuals look at each other directly in the eye. Apart from this special term, contact means physical touch. For example a contact lens is a lens which is in physical contact with the eye, as opposed to the term lens which is used for a monocle also.

Respondent: How about "maintaining contact" with your classmates. Don't you do that with colleagues from your Alma Mater? Is there physical touch?

Me: Here contact means communication. Surely there is no communication between the Indriya eye and the Artha pitcher – communication happens between two conscious beings. With the eye and pitcher, there is only perception. Essentially there are problems in translating Saṃyoga as contact. Therefore, I prefer Conjunction, as the Vyavahāra of the Indriya eye and the Artha pitcher is conjoined (संयुक्तव्यवहारहेतुः संयोगः). And the pitcher being direct object of the eye, the Saṃyoga in चक्षुषा घटप्रत्यक्षजनने संयोगः सन्निकर्षः can be simply explained as Karmaja Saṃyoga.
