I read somewhere (do not recall where) that Bahvṛcapariśiṣṭa is different from the Śaṅkhāyanapariśiṣṭa and Āśvalāyanagṛhyapariśiṣṭa. A work by the name of Bahvṛcagṛhyapariśiṣṭa is listed by the IITS - Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon. The name suggests it is more likely the Pariśiṣṭa of the Bahvṛca Saṁhitā, which was the first Saṁhitā of the Ṛgveda taught by Vyāsa to Paila as attested to by the Bhāgavatam –

तत्रर्ग्वेदधरः पैलः सामगो जैमिनिः कविः (SB 1.4.21)

पैलाय संहितामाद्यां बह्वृचाख्यां उवाच ह (SB 12.6.52)

You may want to check with with Prof. Brij Bihari Chaubey Ji (sometimes credited as Vrajabihārī Caube) who till some time back was with the Vishveshvaranand Vishwabandhu Sanskrit & Indological Research Institute (Hoshiarpur). I do not know if he is still there, but we have members from the institute on this list who may confirm. Chaubey Ji had recently come out with a critical edition of the Āśvalāyanasaṃhitā of the Ṛgveda (Āśvalāyanaśākhīyā R̥gvedasaṃhitā Padapāṭhaviśadabhūmikānukramaṇīdvayasaṃvalitā, ISBN 9788185503172, published by Indirā Gandhī Rāṣṭrīya Kalā Kendra in 2009), and is an authority on various Ṛgvedic Śākhās and their texts.
