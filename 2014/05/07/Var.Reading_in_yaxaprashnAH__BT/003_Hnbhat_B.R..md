Here is the comment on the first line in Nilakantha Dikshita's reading, by Carudevashastri:

quoting the same line for आ+वप् = हविःप्रक्षेप, as explained by Nilakantha.

  

आवापो हविःप्रक्षेपः। "पितृदानं निवापः स्यात् " इत्यमरः। totally it is part of देवपित्रतितर्पण according to the traditional commentator. and the next question makes it clear in the context.
