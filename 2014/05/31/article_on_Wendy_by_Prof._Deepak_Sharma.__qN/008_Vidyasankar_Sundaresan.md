Dear Sunilji,

  
I don't think you appreciate the immense value of the diversity of views among credentialed academic scholars of Indian origin. I don't think the Indian media, whether in India or abroad, does either. And that's the whole pity. There is no rule that all Desi scholars should think the same way. In fact, if there is one given, it is that Desi scholars will always have a multiplicity of opinions about such issues. That freedom of thinking is something that needs to be cherished and encouraged.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
