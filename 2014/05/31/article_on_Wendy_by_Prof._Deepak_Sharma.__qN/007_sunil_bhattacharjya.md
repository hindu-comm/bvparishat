Dear Ajitji,  
  

Thank you for your note. If you find any of my mail offensive you may either stop that from appearing and if you think that the message of my mail is welcome but the language needs change you can modify the language to suit the norms. As you did not object to Deepakji's mention of names and also Vidyasankajir's mention of names I thought I should let me members know the other side of it, that is, how Michel Witzel used those names in favour of his views. I had not shown any rancor against the persons, whose names I mentioned in my mail.  
  

With thanks and regards,  

Sunil KB
