Namaste,  
  

Prof. Deepak Sharma seems, to me, to be trying to soften the dissent against Prof. Wendy Doniger's depiction of Hinduism and he is doing that quite obliquely by asking the desi Hindus to look at their own failings in not encouraging their children to go for religious studies in USA.
He seems to be totally unaware of the general lack of knowledge of the history of Hinduism among the non-Hindu western scholars, barring only
a few. Most of the western scholars still believe in the Aryan Invasion Theory, according to which the Aryans came to India in the 15th century BCE. During the Californian History book controversy there was not a single non-Hindu western professor to support the Hindu efforts for rectification of the wrong depiction of ancient Indian History.
