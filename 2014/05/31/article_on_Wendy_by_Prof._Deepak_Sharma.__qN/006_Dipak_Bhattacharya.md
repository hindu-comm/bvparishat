I am stating the following as my general opinion without any reference to any person.  
Personal attack is undesirable, but discussion on personal views expressed in a book should not be objected to. Views mostly come as personal ones before being recognized as belonging to a category. What is most objectionable, I think, is the use of bad language when criticizing a view. That renders even criticisms into attacks.
