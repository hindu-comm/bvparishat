No Sunilji, Deepak Sarma is making extremely pertinent points here. There is a huge cultural problem involved with us Indians in these matters. For my part, during the height of the debate about Penguin India and Mr. Dinanath Batra with respect to Wendy Doniger's book, I had suggested to some journalists from India whom I know personally, that they should talk to Profs. Vasudha Narayanan, Leela Prasad, Madhav Deshpande and Ashok Aklujkar. I am pleasantly surprised that the first two are explicitly named in his article. The latter two are Sanskrit scholars who could have also offered nuanced perspectives on these things. I had even mentioned that they should talk to Michael Witzel to find out what he \*really\* thinks of the book, and pointed to his critical postings on the indology list from two decades ago on her translations of the Rgveda and the manumsmrti. I offered to make mutual introductions, to facilitate a conversation that could have widened the horizons of the public discourse that was taking place in India at the time. There were no takers, which to me, was symptomatic of the exact problem that Deepak Sarma points out here. We are all busy doing other things, rather than taking concrete personal steps that would make a real difference in the long run.
