There were suggestions similar to the one by Deepak, in



<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anantanand-rambachan/hindu-theology-the-doniger-controversy_b_4931302.html>





and





<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-goldberg/take-my-book-please-furth_b_4987910.html>



also.



The second among the above, Philip Goldberg, who thinks that Wendy's approach to Hinduism is just part of her approach to any religion, (He says, "based on my experience with many of her peers I suspect she no more disrespects Hinduism than any other religion, and possibly less") , does not miss to mention that



"Indian scholars resist critiquing powerful colleagues like Doniger for fear of being labeled a Hindu fundamentalist, and American scholars who also studied with gurus or practice yogic disciplines have their objectivity called into question. In either case, I'm told, criticism is a risky career move."



If this is true, how does more Desi scholars of Hinduism help?



In her response to the first of the above, Chitra asks,



"Just imagine for a moment that one is not studying Hinduism, but German. Imagine that I, as a native English speaker, refuse to learn German grammar and the nuances of its idiom, and then blame the flaws in my understanding on the deviousness of native German speakers trying to cover up the real meaning of the text. Would it make sense for me to stand stubbornly by my interpretation saying “tough luck Germans, you may not like my translation but I didn’t make it up -- that’s exactly what your text says.” Can you imagine my having such an attitude and trying to pass myself off as a “scholar” of German? Yet, when the subject of scholarship is Hinduism, it is considered perfectly reasonable, even admirable to view Hindu Gods through the lens of an Austrian who came by his insights by “analyzing” the neuroses of middle aged European women! Should it require a Hindu theologian to explain why this is stupid? "





I agree that ( in the language of the movie Lagaan) that we need to learn Cricket to defeat them in their own game and not stick to Gilli- Danda alone, how about the risk that Philip is pointing out and how about Chitra's question?



Regards,



Nagaraj
