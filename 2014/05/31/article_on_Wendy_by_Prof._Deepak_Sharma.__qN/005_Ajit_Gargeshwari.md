==Mod Note========  

Dear Sunil Bhattacharya,  
  

I am writing this note after receiving feed back on your recent post from respected and reputed scholars off the list. Personal attacks on any scholar is not allowed on BVP. The focus of this list is to discuss all aspects of Indian culture with a special emphasis on Sanskrit through primary sources. Lets keep this list objective always in mind. Please see BVP home page for rules on postings. Thanks  

  

Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari

अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
