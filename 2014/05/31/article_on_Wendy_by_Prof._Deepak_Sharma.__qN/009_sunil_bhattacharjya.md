Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  
Yes. There is immense value in diversity of opinion and I never denounced that. What I did was to bring to the notice of the readers that divesrity of opinion exis tamong the Desi credentialed scholars and all are not necessarily of the same opinion. That is also the basis of the Su-tarka, where the differing opinions are sorted out amicably with people freely letting out their views. The language naurally has to vary from person to person and people have to pay attention to the messages only, unless of course the any of the participants becomes belligerant and uses abusive and unparliamentary language. These days the Sutarka has generally become rare and one is unable to accept any criticism gracefully. This reminds me of the Sutarka that Adi Sankaracharya had with Mandana Mishra for a number of days and there was use of sarcasm also but never of any abusive words.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
