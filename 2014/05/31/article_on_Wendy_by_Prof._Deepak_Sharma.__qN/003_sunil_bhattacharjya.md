Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

Yes, Michael Witzel did criticize Wendy Doniger's attainment in Sanskrit, particularly with regard to her translations and we all appreciate that. I do agree that Madhav Deshpande and Ashok Aklujkar are great Sanskrit scholars. However most of us also have seen Michael Witzel's stand during the California School History text book controversy, where, if my memory serves me right, he also named Vasudha Narayanan and Madhav Deshpande in his list of people who opposed the view of the Indian group led by Prof Bajpai. That is why we cannot afford to ignore the fact that there is divergence of views among the credentiated desi scholars, the fact which Deepak Sarma appears not to have noticed.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
