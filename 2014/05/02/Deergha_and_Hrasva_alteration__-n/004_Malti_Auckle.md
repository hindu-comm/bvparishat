Sir/Madam/scholars  
This is really a big problem specially with us who are far from the main land and are not exposed to the pronunciation tradition. A request - there must be a common window / sole / unique authority from where this issue is taken up and communicated to all Sanskrit learners and teachers.  
I also feel that there should a common मञ्च to redress such problems.  
I know scholars that may request me to go to the Pronunciation sutras, yet an audio guide will be for the benefit of all.  
I also would take this opportunity to voice out that all institutions involved in learning and teaching Sanskrit should be affiliated to that authoritative body which will be responsible to empower the teachers for the preservation of Sanskrit worldwide, in its original form.  
Humbly submitted for advice, and guidance.  
Malti
