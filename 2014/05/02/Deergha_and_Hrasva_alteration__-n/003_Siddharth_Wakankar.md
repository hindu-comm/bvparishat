Sir/Madam,

  

Now-a-days,the rules for correct pronunciation are hardly followed(or understood),because,the general speakers-unaware of(or not bothering about) the grammatical importance of short and long vowels-utter the words as they like or understand them to be correct-as per their(wrong) conviction.

Many educated persons(including some Sanskrit scholars/teachers/professors also) do not bother to understand the difference between Girisha and Gireesha or Salila and Saleela and this continues almost in all the Indian languages,including Marathi,Gujarati etc.

This is not a place to comment on the typical or peculiar ways of pronouncing that are found all over India,in almost all the languages.Such usages get currency,because hardly anybody-or I should say,very few only- bothers about the correct pronunciation or correct spellings of the words in their languages.A glaring example is: sometimes you see many words spelt wrongly even on the TV screens and some Sanskrit shlokas ([esp.in](http://esp.in) marriage ceremonies performed in the serials on the TV)are also uttered wrongly.Which Director or Producer has time,interest or inclination to verify correct pronunciation? Who can control this tendency?

  

Thanks and regards,
