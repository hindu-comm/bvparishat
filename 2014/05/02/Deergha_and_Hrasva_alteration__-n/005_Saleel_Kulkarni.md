I entirely agree with the explanations presented by both Shri. Nityanand Mishraji and Shri Nagraj Paturiji.



A) Reg. Shri Mishraji’s explanation.



The meanings given by him are exact and perfect. In fact before the naming ceremony, my auntie (father’s sister, who is supposed to decide the name) and my father flipped through Apte’s dictionary to finalise on this name.



Although then the name सलिल was known, the name सलील was not heard of at least in Maharashtra. But later it spread quite widely.



B) Reg. Shri Paturiji’s explanation.



Like the English words are pronounced and in many cases even interpreted differently in the provinces/states of UK, USA, Australia etc., there is no surprise that Sanskrit words, which have existed simultaneously in so many regional tongues for hundreds or thousands of years, have seen changes in pronunciation and even in interpretation from place to place.



In Marathi, the tatsama words are to be pronounced as in Sanskrit; while the tadbhava words are to be pronounced like other Marathi words drawn from Farsi etc. However, of late with Sanskrit losing its importance in schools and elsewhere in the society, and more and more children getting educated in English medium schools rather than the medium of an Indian language, more and more Sanskrit words are being pronounced like the farsi/English words, where the pronunciation of अ is short. 



Many of my South Indian friends pronounce my name as Saleela Kulakarnee, which should be more appropriate from the point of view of Sanskrit (Sanskrita?) pronunciation.
