Respected Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi (VKG) ji,



Does not Sri Mishraji's response show that the word सलील्was wrongly thought to be wrongसलिल् ?



Apart from this, may I request you to pay attention to the fact that all Indian languages, while borrowing Sanskrit words into themselves as either Tatsamas or Tadbhavas, do resort to phonological changes. For example, दीर्घस्वरांत words change into their ह्रस्वस्वरांत forms in Telugu and Kannada Tatsama words. Tadbhava words have greater degree of phonological changes inside their root/stem part too. This is a common phenomenon in all the Indian languages. Sanskrit words may not be used in their Sanskrit meanings invarious Indian languages which borrow these words.(Semantic change)



There is a possibility thatone might notice such changes and perceive them as distortions/alterations.



In the present case, it is not even such a phonological change.



Thanks for your understanding.



Nagaraj
