There is no question of the hrasva changing into deergha or vice versa, but,nobody bothers to know whether the vowel is short and long and what is the difference in the meaning of the word if the vowel is short or long.Sheer ignorance and carelessness OR should we say, vaktruvivakshaa.When they make no difference in pronouncing,why should they bother about its writing or spelling too-where rules are hardly followed now-a-days?
