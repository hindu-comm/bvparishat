I am sure that this forum does not like "apaSabdamrigaaH"; and, one is aware of the vaartika - SaastreNa dharmaniyamaH \[kriyate\]. Even so, one would venture to put forward a different way of looking at the issue.

  

ApaSabdas in signboards etc., are due to the ignorance of those who commission such boards and those who paint them. Even if the painters do not know languages properly, one would expect the business-owners to know better. That they do not, is not just because those who are supposed to be well-educated are ignorant, but also because many not-so-well-educated are opening businesses and are otherwise engaged in activities (politics etc.) that require them to use writing to express their views or activities. For long, such people had been excluded from power and wealth. It is good that in Swatantra Bharat, they are becoming more and more mainstream.

  

One would still hope that after they get wealth and power, they would also try to get some puNya by using saadhuSabdas.
