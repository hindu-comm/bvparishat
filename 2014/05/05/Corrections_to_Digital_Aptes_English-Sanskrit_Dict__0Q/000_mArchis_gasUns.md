Namaste

  

Here is an attempt to clean the Apte-English-Sanskrit Dictionary on Cologne page-

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/aequery/index.html>

The corrections can be done on Wiki pages- here-

<https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Apte_English-Sanskrit_Dictionary_Test.pdf/1>

<https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Apte_English-Sanskrit_Dictionary_Test.pdf/2>

The corrections for page 1 and 2 are given as a test-trial for now. Here are some particulars:

1\. The markup is (a.) minimal and (b.) programmatically equivalent to ae.txt.

2a. All the text is in one column, rather than the two columns of scan.

2b. Sanskrit is kept as {#X#}, where X is in Kyoto-Harvard transliteration.

2\. Feel Free to click the "edit" button. One useful feature is the 'Zoom In' Button under 'Proofread tools - this increases the size of the pdf. You can move around the pdf image independently of the scrolling text. You don't require a login to make changes.

3\. To get back the editing page after saving, you click Edit again. That's all. Before saving, you can also click Preview, if you want; that will leave you still in Edit mode.

4\. By clicking 'view history', one is able to see the correction made. This history is a very nice feature of wikis.

When the the page is edited, then, the corrections can be added to Cologne Sanskrit-lexicon.

  

M.
