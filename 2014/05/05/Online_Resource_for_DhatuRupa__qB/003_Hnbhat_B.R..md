You can use this Morph-Gegenerator online for getting most commonly used verb form generation and analysis of verb or noun forms:

  

<http://tdil-dc.in/san/skt_gen/generators.html#>  

  

But this does not list all the verbs nearly 3000 as per a short survey, in the Dhatupatha. Brihad Dhaturupavali is available for download in pdf form and not as online searchable source. Here is the other online reference source, by Dhatu-s, for the common forms of any Dhatu and particular special forms, which you can browse through Index.

  

  

<http://sanskrit1.ccv.brown.edu/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvindx/disp/mdhv_index.html>  

  

Hope you can use the above to get the sample forms and guess the others.
