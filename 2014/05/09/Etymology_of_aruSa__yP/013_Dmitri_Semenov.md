I understand from the discussion so far that tradition accepts occurences of two different words with the same surface form aruSa in RV:  
one derived from dhAtu ruc with the meaning "shining, reddish" and the other one derived from dhAtu ruS with the meaning "absence of anger".  
  
The post of Dr.Korada Subrahmanyam on asura suggests that derivation of aruSa shall be analogous to that of asura, correct?
