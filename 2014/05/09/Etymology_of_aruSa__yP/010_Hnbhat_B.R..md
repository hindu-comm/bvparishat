It is a better way to refer to the traditional commentators than  
offering the etymologies of their own unless the derivation is given  
in Nirukta. २,३ न एक पदानि निर्ब्रूयात् न अवैयाकरणाय न  
अनुपसन्नाय अनिदंविदे वा। is the policy of Nirukta in defining the  
etymology and explanation of the words. I take as cautioning against  
offereing etymological explanations out of their context. For most of  
the vocabularies he himself offered the etymological explanations with  
their context in the Vedfic mantra-s and in the absence of his etymogy  
offered, one can better to refer to the commentaries by Bhattabhaskara  
and Sayana, whom I believe better acquainted with the tradition.
