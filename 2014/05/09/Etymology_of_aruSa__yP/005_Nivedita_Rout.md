As the best guide to the words of the Vedas is Nirukta, I found the following explanation in it regarding the root used in the word aruSa.

  

ru”saditi var.naanaam\| rocaterjvalatikarma.na.h\|

The word ru”sat is a synonym of colour; it is derived from the root ruc, meaning shine.



Samiddhasya ru”sadder”si paaja.h\| ityapi nigamo bhavati (Nirukta, 6. 13)

The brilliant strength of the kindled one has been seen. This too is a Vedic quotation.
