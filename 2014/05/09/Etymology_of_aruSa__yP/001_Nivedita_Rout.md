I understand the word aruSa is derived from the root "ruc/ru" which means shining/splendid/bright/glowing. We find all most all the usage of the word aruSa is used in the sense of shining or glowing so I assume it coherently derives from the the root "ruc/ru" (as in the case of Sun(aru) glows).

  

I may be wrong in my understanding of the derivation of the word aruSa.

  

Regards,
