I understand from the discussion so far that traditional commentaries accept occurrence of two different words with the same surface form aruSa in RV:  
one derived from dhAtu ruc with meaning "shining, reddish like kindled fire" and another one derived from dhAtu ruS with meaning "absence of anger".  
Dr.Korada Subrahmanyam's post on asura means that derivation of aruSa shall be analogous to that of asura, correct?  
  
Thanks to all who responded on and off the list.  
Dmitri.
