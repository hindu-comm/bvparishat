"What etymologies of aruSa as used in RigVeda were proposed?  
Is is possible that it is derived from dhAtu ruS ?"



There aretwo different words with the same formaruSa:



1\. a + ruS + a = opposite of anger related ruS = to get angry



2\. aruSa = red related , Sun related, day related, Usha (dawn) related



Rigvedic is mostly the second of the above. This second doesn't seem to have an 'a + ....' structure in it.



Some root connected to redness, hot light or similar seems to be in the second. Not 'ruS'.





Nivedita Routji has similar view:



"I understand the word aruSa is derived from the root "ruc/ru" which means shining/splendid/bright/glowing".



A more detailed etymology would be more useful and convincing.

Nagaraj
