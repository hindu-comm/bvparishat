Namaste,



In telugu we have a small booklet called "bAla-rAmAyaNam" published by "vaavilla rama shastrulu & sons". This book in telugu script consists of invocatory verses to saraswati, ganapati and a few slokas selected from bAla-kANDa to uttara-kANDa of vAlmiki-rAmAyaNa.



This bAla-rAmAyaNam is taught generally among traditional telugu families for sanskrit learners immediately after completion of shabda-manjari and dhAtu-manjari.



I am looking for such concise work in dEvanAgari.



Thanking you in advance.



regs,

sriram
