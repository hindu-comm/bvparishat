Dear Sri Ram,



The Bala Ramayanam of Telugu families is nothing but the first part of the Balakanda of VaalmIkiraamaayaNam alternatively called moolaraamaayaNam and sanksheparaamaayaNam.



So pdf of the Devanagari is abundantly available.



You might want to purchase the Gita press Devanagari print also.



Regards,



Nagaraj
