Hope, following information may be useful.  
  
Colonel Prakasha Rao of Hyderabad has researched on 'warfare' for his M.Phil. and Phd degrees. I recall that his M.Phil. dissertation 'Warfare in Mahabharata' has been published, sometime back. For more details, you may like to contact Prof. P. Sasirekha at \<[ps_r...@yahoo.com]()\>.  
  

Regards
