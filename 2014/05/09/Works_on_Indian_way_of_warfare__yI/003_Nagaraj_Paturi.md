1\. Kautilya's Arthashasra has Book 9 to Book 15 on wars and strategies only.



2\. Panchatantra is in fact a book of five (war related)strategies taught through folk tales particularly animal tales to princes.



3\. Mahabharatha has detailed sections dealing with ethical and strategic reasons for pre-war negotiations and the method of diplomacy (particularly pre-war diplomacy) in Udyogaparva.



4\. There are books on Archery(धनुर्विद्या), Sword-quality(खड्गलक्षण), Horse-quality(अश्वलक्षण) etc.



5\. Atharva Veda has sections on weapons and enemy-handling etc.



Many many more like that.
