Dear Scholars,

  

I would like to know any intensive works in Sanskrit literature on warfare and foreign policy for a study on Indian strategic culture.

  

It would be grateful if you could provide any traditional texts with references to the above subject.

  

Thanks and regards,

Srinivasan Acharya, Manipal
