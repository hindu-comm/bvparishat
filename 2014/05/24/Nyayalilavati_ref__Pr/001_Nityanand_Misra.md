Ācārya Ji,  
  
Thanks for the quotations from the Dhātvarthanirṇayaḥ. If you could also confirm the Kārikā number (ranging from 1 to 21 in the Dhātvarthanirṇayaḥ, 1 to 74 in the whole work) for the quotations, it would be helpful to trace them in the work and commentaries.  
  
I do not have a commentary on the Bṛhadvaiyākaraṇabhuṣaṇa - I only have a digital copy of the work edited by Paṇḍita Rāmakṛṣṇa Śāstrī (Tātya Śāstrī Paṭavardhana), published by Braj B Das and company in 1900. My hope is that the Vaiyākaraṇabhuṣaṇasāra may have similar statements and/or citations as it is mostly an abridgement of the Bṛhadvaiyākaraṇabhuṣaṇa, and if they are, it is likely some commentary may have hints to the original sources. Even if the citations are not in the Vaiyākaraṇabhuṣaṇasāra, commentaries like Darpaṇa or Subodhinī may have them or have pointers to the sources.  
  
I am afraid there are no answers for now, but we can try to trace them.  
  
This search below shows that another work, Tarkakutūhalam, cites the work लीलावत्युपाय

Thanks, Nityānanda
