Namaste  
Paishachi is a script used to write Sanskrit in coastal Karnataka and other parts of south India.As the name suggests it was used for tantra ,black magic etc and also known as a secret script .It is similar to tigalari .Very few persons knowing the script are surviving today.Do anybody know further information on this topic and can forward the basic chart of varnamalaof the script ( Not to be confused with paishachi dialect of Prakrit).
