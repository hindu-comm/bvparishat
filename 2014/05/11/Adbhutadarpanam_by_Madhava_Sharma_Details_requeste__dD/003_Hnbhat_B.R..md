The date of Ballalasena and Madhava, one can do research on the manuscripts and arrive at a different date reading and comparing both the texts. I just gave the information available. Pingree also gave information he got from the same sources he referred and he need not have gone to read the manuscripts if not published already. To this Madhava's credit, there are some more jyotisha works. One can compare all his works and Ballasena's works and arrive at a fresh date and come up with a different opinion, than depending on the dates only on the dates noted in the manuscripts (which are uncertain) most probably the date of copying the manuscripts, unless specifically mentioned by the author that he composed it on such and such date. As per your cololophone, this Madhava, is the son of Matinatha, and the one referred to by Aufret is the son of Raghunatha, unless he has mistaken Raghunatha for Matinatha. And the Madhava s/o Matinatha, may be a different person, who is son of Madhava, the author of the work Adbhutadarpana. Anyhow, this is an abridged version of Adbhutadarpana, as per the statement of the author himself:

  

kriyate mādhavenāsau saṃkṣiptādbhutadarpaṇaḥ  

  

There should be some full version as basic text for this Adbhutadarpana abrdiged prior to his composition. That much you can be certain. And for the identification, one has to go through the text materials by this Madhava and the other Adhutasagara and arrive at a conclusion about their relationship in chronology.
