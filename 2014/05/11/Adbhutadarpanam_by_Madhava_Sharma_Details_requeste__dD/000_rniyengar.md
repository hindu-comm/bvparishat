Dear Scholars,

  

Recently while searching the 6000 and odd manuscripts on Jyotisha in the online list of NGMCP (Nepal-German project) I came across several copies of Adbhutadarpanam. This is different from the text of the same title in some of the Indian catalogues which is a "Drama"(?)

  

I am curious to know about the Nepal archive material excerpts of which as available online follows.

  

## Colophon:

oṃ namaḥ śrīgaṇeśāya \|\| oṃ namaḥ savitre \|\|

saṃvyāne hariṇā kṛte kutukinā nīvīṃ kareṇa śrathāṃ

dhṛtvā bhgnitavāsavākulatayā covekṣya vakṣasthalīṃ \|\|

kiṃcitkubjitamadhyamaṃjulataraṃ paścād vrajantyāḥ śanair

dordolāyitacakṣuṣo ‘vibhuvaḥ kākuktayaḥ pāntu naḥ

… śrīkṛṣṇārādhavyagramatināthānujanmanā\|

mahāmahopadādyasya govindasyāgrajanmanā\|

kriyate mādhavenāsau saṃkṣiptādbhutadarpaṇaṃḥ\|

aprāmāṇyasya śaṃkāpi neha kāryā sudhījanaiḥ\| (fol. 1v)

### Sub-colophon

athādbhutanirūpaṇam \|\| (fol. 2r)

End:  

iti śrīmādhavaviracitādbhutadarpaṇaḥ saṃpūrṇaḥ \|\| śubhaṃ bhūyāt \|\| 7 \|\| 4 \|\|

vīrarāmena kaṣṭena likhitaṃ śubha-icchayā\|

yadi śuddham aśuddhaṃ vā śodhanīyaṃ budho janaiḥ \|\| 7 \|\| 1 \|\| 3 \|\|

śarābdhivivare varṣe māse site bhādrake\|

adbhuddarpaṇakaṃ śāstraṃ dattaṃ (fol. some letters inked over) \|\| 6 \|\| (fol. 159r7–9)

My question; Who was this Maadhava? When and where was he living? Is any information available about his works in Indian records? His brother was a Mahaamahopaadhyaaya. Was this title prevalent even before 10th Century AD?

Regards

RNI
