Thanks for the confirmation about the drama of the same name.

I have seen Gonda's multipart work, Indeed it is voluminous. Part vi happens to be by Pingree on Jyotihsástra. It is informative though not reliable being too much opinionated in many places. It appaears he has written some parts of his History without reading the original texts critically. Anyway this is what we read about Maadhava.

This is very similar to what Oppert had to say! Is it not possible Ballala depended on Madhava? Or has any one read the text of Madhava to conclude that he has borrowed from Ballalasena? This is the reason I liked to know the date of Madhava. In the online text posted by me we read in the last line:śarābdhivivare varṣe māse site bhādrake\| 

Without comparing several Mss we can not be sure of the year mentioned above, but it appears to be 945 VS, or is it 549? Pl correct me if I am wrong.

  

There is another entry of a copy in Newari script indicating a date :

  

A 999/2

Title Adbhutadarpaṇa

Dimensions 42 x 7.3 cm x 178 folios

Material paper?

Script(s) Newari

Languages Sanskrit

Subject(s) Jyotiṣa

Date NS 833

Acc. No. NAK 6/818

  

Is this the Nepali Samvat 833? If so what is the equivalent VS? This may be the date of the scribe and not of the author. I rememeber to have read that Nepal follows the VS, but also has a NS starting in 879/80 AD.
Not being a trained manuscriptologist I am wondering about the date of Madhava. Can it be (c 1375) as it appears in the book by Pingree.?
