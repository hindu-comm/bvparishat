Here is one Adbhudadarpana by a Madhava s/o Raghunatha as per NCC:

which may or may not be a drama. But it is called अद्भुतसंग्रह also. These are the details of other similar titles as per Aufrecht Catalogue:

  

अद्भुतदर्पण

  

\[L=303\] अद्भुतदर्पण¦ nāṭaka by Mahādeva. Burnell 167^a. Oppert

3941\. II, 7470.

\[L=304\] अद्भुतदर्पण¦ dh. by Mādhavācārya. Kaṭm. 3. 11. NW. 78.

\[L=31377\] \[p= 2-002,1\] अद्भुतदर्पण¦ nāṭaka, by Mahādeva. Printed in Kāvyamālā

1895\.

*\[L=31378\] अद्भुतदर्पण¦ or अद्भुतसंग्रह jy., based on Ballālasena's*

*Adbhutasāgara, by Mādhava, son of Raghunātha.*

*IO. 717. Kaṭm. 3. 11. NW. 78.*

*\[L=41766\] \[p= 3-002,2\] अद्भुतदर्पण¦ jy. by Mādhava, son of Raghunātha. AS p. 7.*

*Hpr. 1, 3.*

  

Hope you may find somewhere the details of the author Madhava. He seems to be different from the a author of Adbhutadarpana, who is Mahadeva, s/o Krishnasuri. As per Aufret, it seems to be Jyotisha for the subject of the work. You may have to refer to any History of Astrology available, for the details of the author and could not be found in any History of Sanskrit Classical Literature. May be there a separate part on Technical Literature in the voluminous History of Literature by Gonda etc.
