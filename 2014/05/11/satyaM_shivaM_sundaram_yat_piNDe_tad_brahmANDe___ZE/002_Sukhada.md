Respected sir, thank you very much for your kind reply.  
I too had looked at this blog page but I feel that the blogger might have borrowed it from somewhere, hence, it need not be the original source of the quote.  
  
For instance, if I search for "विद्या गुरूणां गुरुः", I find it quoted at various places but not all of them give its source. Based on the ones which quote it with its source I could find it in Bhartrihari's Nitishatakam. But the same was not possible for "सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम्" and "यत् पिण्डे तद् ब्रह्माण्डे".  
  

With regards,  

Sukhada
