Dear all,  
Namaste,  
I have been searching for the references of the two famous quotes "सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम्" and "यत् पिण्डे तद् ब्रह्माण्डे". The second adage is also seen quoted as "यद् ब्रह्माण्डे तत् पिण्डे" , "यथा पिण्डे तथा ब्रह्माण्डे" but I could not find the source of any of these adages. I'll be highly obliged if someone can give me their references.  
  

With deep regards,
