The concept of 'that which is in the brahmnANDa, macrocosm, is in the pinDAnDa, microcosm,' is well known through all the upanishads, especially in the mANDUkya. The pancha bhutas that constitute the macrocosm is found in the jiva's body/mind complex too. The pralaya, etc, that happen in the macrocosm happens in the jivasharira too in the form of waking, sleep, etc. For the microcosmic, vyaShTi, jiva triad, vishwa, taijasa and prAjna, we have the corresponding macrocosmic, samaShTi, virAT, Hiranyagarbha and Ishwara.



Well said.



There are other ways of doing this too:



1\. The cosmic process is described as Yajna in Purusha Sookta. The human bodily process is also described as Yajna in Geeta.



"अधियज्ञोहमेवात्र देहे देहभृतां वर"



शंकरभाष्य for this :



अहमेव,अत्र अस्मिन् देहे यो यज्ञः तस्य अहम् अधियज्ञः,यज्ञो हि
देहनिर्वर्त्यर्त्वेन देहसमवायी इति देहाधिकरणो भवति , देहभृतां वर।



2\. विराट पुरुष concept itself isviewing the cosmos in the model of human body. Purusha Sookta provides an example for how that can be done.
