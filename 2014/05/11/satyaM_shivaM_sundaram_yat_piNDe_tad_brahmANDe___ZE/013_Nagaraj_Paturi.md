My previous response was to Sri Aurobind Padiyath. Not to Dr. HN Bhat.



This thread really deserved a moderation by Dr. Bhat.



Dr. Bhat is absolutely right:



The question was the source of the quotations

> "यत् पिण्डे तद् ब्रह्माण्डे". The second adage is also seen quoted > as "यद् ब्रह्माण्डे तत् पिण्डे"  

  

and not the explanation of it.



Sorry to have been carried away by the deviations. Though that was a good discussion, deviation nevertheless.



Regretfully,



Nagaraj
