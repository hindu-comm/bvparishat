Most of the references are to Ayurveda, but no one who ever has referred to has not mentioned their source except that:

Ayurveda says"As is the atom, so is the universe

As is the human body, so is the cosmic body

As is the human mind, so is the cosmic mind

As is the microcosm, so is the macrocosm
