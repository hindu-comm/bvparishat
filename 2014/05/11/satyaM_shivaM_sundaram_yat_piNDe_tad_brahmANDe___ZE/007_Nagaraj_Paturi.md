Attached is an excerpt from the book "The History of Medieval Vaishnavism in Orissa" by Prabhat Mukherjee:

  

This document says that Pinda-Brahmanda theory is in virATa gIta. I could not locate virATa gIta.

  

மையல் உலகம்maiyal ulakam = universe in the body is a Tamil siddha tradition theory also.

  

It is not clear whether this travelled from the Tamil Siddha to Sanskrit sources or vice-versa.
