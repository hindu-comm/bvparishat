Dear friends,

  

The question was the source of the quotations

  

> "यत् पिण्डे तद् ब्रह्माण्डे". The second adage is also seen quoted > as "यद् ब्रह्माण्डे तत् पिण्डे"  

  

and not the explanation of it. If the original source could be traced, that would be fine than the discussion about परमार्थ and व्यावहारिक or the nature of these conceptsn in different terms which vary from one school to another and according the expounders of the tenets.

  

The original source for the quotation is most welcome.
