Namaste,

  

I have two books. One is shAktAnanda-tarangiNi which is a shAkta tantra work and another is garuDa-purANa. 

  

In shAktAnanda-tarangiNi vide sharIra-kOsha-varNana, it is mentioned as:

  

brahmANDE yE guNAH santi tE tiSTanti kalEbarE

pAtAlaM bhUdharA lOkA AdtiyAdi navagrahAH

piNDamadhyE sthitAH sarvEsthAnaM tESAM vadAmi tE

  

The above sloka says that whatever attributes and worlds are present in brahmANDa,

is present in piNDANDa. 

  

In sukruti-jana-janmAcharaNa chapter of garuDa-purANa, it is said:

  

bhuvanAni cha sarvANi parvatadvIpasAgarAH

AdtiyAdigrahAssanti sharIrE pAramArthikE

pAramArthika dEhE hi SatchakrANi bhavanti cha

brahmANDE yE guNAH prOktA tE(a)pyasminnEva saMsthitAH

  

The above sloka says that there is a sukshma shareera in everybody which is called "pAramArthika-dEha".

It is this pAramArthika-dEha which consists of subtle yogic centers called "chakrAs" from mUlAdhAra to

sahasrAra.

  

Whatever lOkAs (worlds) are seen in brahmANDa (externally), can also be seen internally in this pAramArthika-dEha.

  

Hope this helps.

  

regs,

sriram
