Let us divide the contents of the thread into three categories:



1\. References to the exact phrases : Only Sri Nityanada Mishraji brought a mentionof the phrase "सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम्"in a 1630 AD legendary biography.



Reference to the exact 'addages' "यत् पिण्डे तद् ब्रह्माण्डे". "यद् ब्रह्माण्डे तत् पिण्डे" "यथा पिण्डे तथा ब्रह्माण्डे" are not yet given by any one in the thread.



2\. Indirect references to thewords of the pinda - brahmaanda addages has been given by Sri Aurobindo Padiyath (from Ayurvedic), Sri Venkata Sri Ram ( Shakta Tarangini, ), Nagaraj Paturi (Virat Gita ) Sri V. Subrahmanian ( Yoga Kundalinyupanishad ) .



3\. The idea contained in the addages was shown to be discussed in Garuda Purana ( Venkata Sri Ram ) , Mandukya Upanishad and other Upanishads (V Subrahmanian) Purusha Sukta andBhagavadgita taken together ( Nagaraj Paturi) .



It is during the # 3 that the deviation started occurring.



Problem of locating the references to the exact addages verbatim still remains unresolved.



#3 can be taken up as a separate thread.



Regards,



Nagaraj
