Dear Sir,

The original manuscript of the Shanmukhakalpa is(or was?) in the Asiatic Society,Kolkata.On the basis of that ,the German scholar edited it in German,with the Sanskrit Text given in Roman script.

Just try your luck at the Asiatic Society,the only place,where the original Ms.was/is reported to exist.

  

Best luck in your hectic efforts.

  

Prof Siddharth Wakankar
