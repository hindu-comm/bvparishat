Of course. But it does not seem to be इन्नन्त, as it is seen used as in Bhushanasara, it cannot take the form प्रतिवन्द्या if it is प्रतिबन्दिन् or प्रतिवन्दिन्, both possible due to व-ब. But the form is possible only from प्रतिबन्दी as feminine. as is seen in both usages given by Sri Vishnu and I think that was the reason for the question of derivation. Even if प्रतिबन्दिन् is derived, the feminine would be प्रतिबन्दिनी and प्रतिबन्दी, which could be derived from प्रतिबन्दः - प्रतिबन्धः - घञ् or घ would be used in masculine generally and not in feminine gender. Only the possible solution would be जातिलक्षणङीष् from प्रतिबन्द somehow taken granted as a technical term.
