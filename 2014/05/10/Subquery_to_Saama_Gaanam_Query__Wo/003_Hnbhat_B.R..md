Please be precise with your question with quotation to support your claim. Otherwise it will be dwindling here and there and distracted by the scholars without understanding the purport of your question.

  

  

1\. ऊह as quoted in Patanjali, is popularly known. It is the substitution or extension of the same "mantra" to other instances used in respect of other deities, changing the names in the same pattern.

  

2\. And is your ऊहगान or ऊह्यगान is the same as the one quoted in Mahabhashya, as ऊहः plainly, in respect of मन्त्र-s in general or not.

  

3\. ऊहमन्त्र is विकृति of the original मन्त्र as you have noticed. The general policy is to accept प्रकृतिवद् विकृतिः or प्रकृतिवदनुकरणम् even if it is विकृति. Is ऊहगान or विकृतिगान or ऊह्यगान is considered as different from the प्रकृति considered as पौरुषेय or अपौरुषेय. This seems to be your precise question, if I have not misunderstood in respect of सामवेद particularly.

  

4\. You refer to निदानसूत्र, याज्ञिक्युपनिषत् and जैमिनिसूत्र. Please quote the original sources like Prof.Korada has done for your assertion or hypothesis so that others also examine the source and give their opinions.

  

As far as I know, from the विकृतिमन्त्र-s, the episode of इन्द्रशत्रुर्वर्धस्व, it resulted in the इन्द्रः शातयिता यस्य even though it is विकृति, like the अपौरुषेयमन्त्र the प्रकृति for it. whether it is पौरुषेय or अपौरुषेय it resulted in the slaying of वृत्र a demon, by इन्द्र as if it were अपौरुषेय. This is general opinion and not any expert opinion as you would expect from the scholars. The source is the verse quoted in महाभाष्य itself :

  

दुष्टः शब्दः स्वरतो वर्णतो वा. मिथ्याप्रयुक्तो न तमर्थमाह।

स वाग्वज्रो यजमानं हिनस्ति, यथेन्द्रशत्रुः स्वरतोऽपराधात्।\|
