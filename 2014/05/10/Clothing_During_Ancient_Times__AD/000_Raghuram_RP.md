Abhivadayee All,

  

We are teaching our kids regarding clothing. So I wanted to know about how our ancestors used cloth. There is some mention in Ramayana regarding usage of jute cloth. I request scholars to throw light on this and let me know if we have references to clothes in other puranas or epics.
