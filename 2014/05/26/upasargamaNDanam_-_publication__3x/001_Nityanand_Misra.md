Congratulations Dr. Patel, I browsed through the free chapter sample on Kindle and will buy it shortly.  
  
Can you please share the details of the fonts used for the Latin and Nagari scripts in the book? The last I checked the Kindle file format did not support Unicode Devanagari? Do they support it now?
