Going through text of Mādhavīyā Dhātuvṛttiḥ, I saw that the work discusses the usage “प्रार्थयन्ति शयनोत्थितं प्रियाः” at two places.



Once under चक्षिङ् व्यक्तायां वाचि (अदादिगणे ९). Here two explanations are offered for प्रार्थयन्ति – one from प्रार्थ+णिच्, other from अनुदात्तेत्त्वप्रयुक्तमात्मनेपदमनित्यम्. The work says that while the former derivation also results in this form, the meaning may not be \[easily\] comprehended by the learned (शब्दास्तु सिद्ध्यन्ति अर्थास्तु सहृदयहृदयङ्गमा न भवन्ति), and prefers the latterexplanation based on अनुदात्तेत्त्वप्रयुक्तमात्मनेपदमनित्यम्.

The second time it is brought up under अर्थ उपयाच्ञायाम् (चुरादिगणे २८७) which Dr. Korada pointed out earlier.

The 1964 publication by Prācya Bhāratī Prakāśana (Vārāṇasī), edited by Svāmī Dvārikādāsa Śāstrī does not cite the usage “प्रार्थयन्ति शयनोत्थितं प्रियाः” in any footnote.



The 2002 publication by Ramlal Kapoor Trust (Sonipat), edited by Ācārya Vijayapāla Vidyāvāridhi, has the brief footnote “मूलं मृग्यम्” at both places where “प्रार्थयन्ति शयनोत्थितं प्रियाः” is quoted.
