We are shocked to know that Prof. B. B. Chaubey is no more. He was an authority on Vedic literature. His editions of Vedic texts has thrown light on various aspects of Critical editions. As a scholar, he was very simple and humble in explaining the Vedic lines. His interest in the subject has made him very popular. He was a good friend of us who used to encourage to do more works for Sanskrit. He delivered lectures in our Manuscriptology work-shop and also seminars on Manuscriptology. His lectures are still fresh in our mind.

 His sad demise is an irreparable loss to the field of Sanskrit. We pray to the almighty to keep the departed soul in peace and give enough strength to his family to bear this great loss.
