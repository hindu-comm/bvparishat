Namaste  
  

A few months ago there was a discussion on the theme 'देहबुद्ध्या....' a verse supposed to be about Hanuman's expression. The source of the verse was not identified, though the verse itself is popular. Here is a verse of the same theme, available in the 'mādhavīya śaṅkara vijaya' admitted to be authored by Swāmi Vidyāraṇya (14 CE):  
  

Sarga 6, Verse 41:  
  

The verse occurs in the context of the caṇḍāla episode.  

  

दासस्तेऽहं देहदृष्ट्यास्मि शम्भो

 जातस्तेऽम्शो जीवदृष्ट्या त्रिदृष्टे

सर्वस्यात्मन्नात्मदृष्ट्या त्वमेवे-

 त्येवं मे धीर्निश्चिता सर्वशास्त्रैः ।

The Ācārya said to the Lord: “Oh Śambho Mahādeva! Salutations to you. When I consider myself to be this body (deha drishti), I am your servant (dāsaḥ). When I consider myself to be the limited/personal soul (jīva dṛṣṭi), I am a part of you (amśaḥ), O Three-eyed One!. When I consider myself to be the unlimited/boundless soul (ātma dṛṣṭi), then I am verily you (tvam). This is the essence of all the scriptures (sarva-śāstraiḥ) I have learned and ascertained by serving my guru and listening to his words.”

It appears that the idea contained in the verse is as old as 14CE. If we are able to trace any other source for the idea predating this, then we could say that the above work has adapted the already available idea.
