Dear Sri Subrahmanian,

The concept of identity (or similarity or congruence?) of the micro- and macrocosm appears widely in the literature on mysticism. Lakshmidhara's (14th Cent.) commentary on the immaculately beautiful poem Saundaryalahari is an example. I am attaching three pages of the commentary for your attention where the words पिण्डाण्ड ब्रह्माण्ड are used and also explained. In one place it is said

In the second place it is forcefully said that the two are ONE

But again later he seems to mean that there are infinite number of पिण्डाण्ड  & ब्रह्माण्ड

My question: In the Advaita-vedaanta tradition, is it accepted that there are many पिण्डाण्ड  & ब्रह्माण्ड ? I am aware that the definitions of technical words can be different in different s'aastras. But since the Saundaryalahari is attributed to Sri S'ankaraachaarya, I am raising this doubt with considerable hesitation. Since this group has many stalwart Vedantins, my query may sound trivial. Nevertheless I would appreciate a clarification.

  

Regards
