Dr HN Bhat was cautioning against taking a general discussion into sectarian interpretations such as that of Advaita when he said,



"If the original source could be traced, that would be fine than the discussion about परमार्थ and व्यावहारिक or the nature of these conceptsn in different terms which vary from one school to another and according the expounders of the tenets".



I think that is fair enough.



The case of the thread on अद्वैतमते इन्द्रियाणि is different. Its theme itself is "अद्वैतमते".



There is a scope to discuss पिंड-ब्रह्मांड theory without going into a specific वादभेद like Advaita also.



If there is a wider consensus in favour of continuing with Advaitic discussion or bringing in the other vadas too into the discussion, that may be fine.

Nagaraj
