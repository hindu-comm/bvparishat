Went through a few Marathi sources .Found that "पिंडी तेब्रह्मांडी"
"जे पिंडी ते ब्रह्मांडी " is a highly oft quoted adage ( न्याय according to some of the sources) in that language. It has been included in several older texts such as हरिपाठ(e.g. अभंग 22)also.



Is 'यत् पिंडे तत् ब्रह्मांडे' a Sanskritization of thisMarathi expression? or Is it that all the Indian languages with tatsama wordshave similar expressions with the words पिंड and ब्रह्मांडas a result of translation of the Sanskrit expression 'यत् पिंडे तत् ब्रह्मांडे'?



The Marathi sources also give a great significance to 'जे पिंडी ते ब्रह्मांडी' as an Ayurvedic principle. One of these sources even talks of जठराग्निasसूर्यinside human body.Some of these sources even indicate that Ayurveda is the origin of this principle.
