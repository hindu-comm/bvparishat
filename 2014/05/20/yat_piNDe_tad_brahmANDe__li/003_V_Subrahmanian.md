Namaste  
  

Thanks for the documents. Without going to much thinking/searching, what occurs to me off-hand is the Lalistasahasranama name: उन्मेषनिमिषोत्पन्नविपन्नभुवनावली -  
281 Unmeṣa nimiṣotpanna vipanna bhuvanavālī –by the time span of opening and closing of whose eye lids , various universe are created and distroyed.   
  

This concept is found expressed in the 'क्षणे क्षणे सृ्ष्टि/लयः / दष्टिसमसमया सष्टिः which are all the different names of दृष्टिसृष्टिवाद of advaita.  
  

In this prakriyA, each cognition is a universe by itself, thus accommodating innumerable 'universes/brahmANDa-s' with their own microcosms also. The aikyam between the two - macro and micro cosms - is struck by the underlying One Pure Consciousness, the adhiShThAnam, called 'Turiya' / chaturtham, in the māṇḍūkyopnaiṣat. In other words, according to advaita, both the micro and the macrocosms have this Pure Consciousness as their substratum as the common factor. That way they are non-different. That is, both the 'cosms' are superimpositions in that One Turiya.
