Do you mean to say,



"Can anybody describe devaparadhas for me!

I heard that there are 32 Devaradhas. Their list begins something like.......



शक्तौ सत्यपि गौणोपचार समर्पण , एकहस्त नमस्कार करण , ,,,,,,,,,  



Please describe for me." ??



I am sorry if you mean to say what you wrote.



Regards,



Nagaraj
