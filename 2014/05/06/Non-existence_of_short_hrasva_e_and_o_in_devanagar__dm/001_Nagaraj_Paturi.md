1\. Each script system has the symbols suited to the languages for which the system is used.



2\. 'Deficiency' comes into question only when one script system is used for the transliteration of the language for which it is not devised.



3\. No script system is free from such issues.



4\. CIIL and other such organizations where the transliteration of south Indian languages into Devanagari becomes necessary have already devised modifications for ह्रस्ववक्र .( ह्रस्ववक्र, दीर्घवक्र, वक्रतम are the words used by certain grammars for e, o, ē, ō, ai, au.



5. Pronunciation of ह्रस्ववक्र by the speakers of north Indian languages needs a special phonetic alertness/training. But a general speaker may not try for such an accuracy just as a a general south Indian speaker of north Indian languages does with halanth syllable pronunciation etc.



6. Forums of this kind are the places where a broader scientific linguisticunderstanding ofissues can shine.

Nagaraj
