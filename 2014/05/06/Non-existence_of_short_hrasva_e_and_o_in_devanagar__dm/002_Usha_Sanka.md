*"I think specialists who are interested in right pronunciation may please devise some mark to denote short vowels indevanagari."  
*

Even in Devanagari there are mAtrAs for this- Please consider- for

दीर्घ एकार -े

ह्रस्व ऎकार -ॆ

दीर्घ ओकार -ो

ह्रस्व ऒकार -ॊ

I read that Avadhi and Braj do have hrasva "e" and "o" and for representing those in Devanagri script, they use these mAtrAs.

  

But unfortunately though we can devise mAtrAs, we cannot get those differences in pronunciation easily because of limited training. We are limited by sounds in our own mother tongue.Regarding consonants there are far more things.

Eg. Japanese have no "l" ; they pronounce all places where "l" occurs as "r". Same happens with many other sounds like ळ, ऑ ड़फ़क़ ख़ ग़ ... and many many more. But vowel sounds are most primary.. is what I think.

Special attention is needed in this regard.. is undebatable.
