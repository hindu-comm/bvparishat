While on the subject of *hrasva* and *deergha* I would like to discuss this:

  

Every language has its own peculiarities. Sanskrit is no exception. In all *dravidian* language and also in English we have shorts for 'e' and 'o'. Since *devanagari* does not have this form of vowel, a great number of *devanagari-*users cannot distinguish between "test" and "taste" between "west' and "waste". and similarly "original" and "oriental".'Reddy' is pronounced as 'Raiddy' and 'red' is 'raid'

  

Because of this deficiency in the *nagari* alphabet, pronunciation of such words leads to amusing situations. Once, I heard a gentleman asking a Diagnostic Lab receptionist to get his blood "tasted" instead of "tested". In Hyderabad, we have a locality called West Maredpally, it is invariably pronounced as Waste Maredpally by *nagari* influenced people. I think specialists who are interested in right pronunciation may please devise some mark to denote short vowels in *devanagari*.
