Not connected to the central focus of the thread. Just for the sake of record :



<http://www.ciil.org/GIACIILAboutourselves.aspx> has the words: "The Central Institute of Indian Languages was established as a sub-ordinate office of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of Higher Education, Government of India and started functioning w.e.f. 17th July 1969."



"the sorry state of affairs in government institutions which was also the point of discussion in another thread recently" is, among other things connected to 1.the legacy of a prosocialist mixed economy (witha pampered public sector)which is now being replaced by a promarket mixed economy (with a pressurisedpublic sector lamenting missing the good old days)2. the bottom rank of humanities among the fields of learning even within the private funding networks. 3. a general persistence of the developing country conditions of relegating 'non-productive' areas of study to back seat and the resultant dejection of people working in those areas etc.



But all this is a different trajectory of discussion.



I for one, find platforms such as BVP successfully contributing to rejuvenating and inspiring even the most dejected lot.



Let us be optimistic about the future.



Regards,



Nagaraj
