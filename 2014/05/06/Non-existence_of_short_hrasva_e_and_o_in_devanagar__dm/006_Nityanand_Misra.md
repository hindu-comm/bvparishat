Dear Prof. Paturi  
  
I only meant to provide some more information on the use of the Ekamatrika glyphs, and was not contradicting in any way your general observations. I agree with most of what you said.  
  
Thanks also for correcting me that CIIL was formed in 1969.  
  
My source was this page -  
<http://www.ciil.org/aboutlegend.aspx>  
"All through the last 32 years in existence, ..."  
  
Which means their history on their official website is outdated by thirteen years! That is certainly legendary I must say.  
  
What is also interesting is that as per Archive.org, though the CIIL site has been around since March 1 2000, the page "CIIL: A Legend" was first put up in October 2011 (when the content was already stale by ten years) - reflects the sorry state of affairs in government institutions which was also the point of discussion in another thread recently.
