Not only the sounds are present in both Avadhī and Braja languages (as another member pointed out), glyphs for these sounds in Devanāgarī were introduced much before the CIL came into existence (early 1980s). The Kāśirāja edition of the Rāmacaritamānasa (ed. Viśvanātha Prasāda Miśra) was first published in 1962 and used different glyphs for both the Mātrās and independent vowels for short (Ekamātrika) e and o to distinguish them from the Dvimātrika e and o in Devanāgarī. The glyphs are not very different from those used by CIL, CDAC or the Unicode standard. I am not sure if the publishers of the Kāśirāja edition devised these symbols or somebody else did before them. But it happened much before efforts by CIL. In fact it is not known to many people from southern India that the Ekamātrika e and o vowels exist in northern languages and play an important role in the vast poetic literature of Avadhī and Braja.  
  
Regarding 'west/waste', 'test/taste', anybody with sufficient exposure to spoken English can pick up correct English pronunciation. A script need not be changed for the same. Accents and mispronunciations exist world over.
