Thanks for the information on the Kasiraja Edition of Ramacharithamanasa and the creation of glyphs for 'Ekamaatrika' e and o, way back in 1962.



CIIL came into existence in 1969 seven years later to this. The use of glyphs for 'Ekamaatrika' e and o by CIIL must be even later. Probably CIIL picked up a leaf or two from the book ofprevious publications too. I made no claim of they being the first users /creators of such glyphs. I only said that they were in need of using such glyphs while transliterating the south Indian words in Devanagari. The point was not whether the CIIL was a pioneer in this regard.



I was only urging the initiator of the thread not to assume that pronunciation by the speaker of a language is based on the script system of that language and I was trying to bring home the (scientific) understanding which is exactly the other way round. My two points :



"1. Each script system has the symbols suited to the languages for which the system is used.



2\. 'Deficiency' comes into question only when one script system is used for the transliteration of the language for which it is not devised."



do not contradict the Avadhi, Braj situation.



I was only contradicting the assumption of a 'deficiency' in the general Devanagari system and the assumption of the perceived pronunciation problems to be results of such a 'deficiency'.



I was only urging for a "a broader scientific linguisticunderstanding"



I was not disputing any of your points and I do not think your informationcontradicts any of my points.



Glyphs for Ekamaatrik e and o are not required either for Sanskrit or
for north Indian languages, speakers of which are not taught these glyphs.



ForwritingAvadhi, Braj or for the transliteration of words from languages where the sounds of Ekamaatrik e and o are found, the glyphs created for these soundsare very much useful. Thanks to their first creators.
