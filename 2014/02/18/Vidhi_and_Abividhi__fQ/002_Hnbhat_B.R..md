And, the technical term for विधि can be looked in मीमांसाकोश and न्यायकोश separately, with its all possible consequences in different texts. See मीमांसाकोश pp.3540 - 2565; Vol.6, Ed.Kevalanandasarasvati.

  

and न्यायकोश pp.690-696 gives the definitions for विधि in different शास्त्र-s.

  

So you can compare and decide yourself whether अभिविधि and विधि are related or not.

  

All technical terms in शास्त्र are limited to their definitions in relevant शास्त्र-s and some may be inter-related depending on the contexts and not always they convey the same concept though there may beparallelism and may not be identical.
