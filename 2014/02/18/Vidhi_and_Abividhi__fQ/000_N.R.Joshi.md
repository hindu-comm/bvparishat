Respect3d Scholars, Namaskar!  
  
Our Russian scholar MG has difficulties about certain technical Sanskrit words and their exact English translation. Many of us face the same difficulties.  
  
Here is my question to scholars of BVP. Here are two groups of words.  
(1) Vidhi, Niyama and Parisankhyaa on one hand and (2) Maryaadaa and Abhividhi on the other hand.  
Question: Is Vidhi and Abhividhi semantically connected. If yes, how?  
Thanks. N.R.Joshi
