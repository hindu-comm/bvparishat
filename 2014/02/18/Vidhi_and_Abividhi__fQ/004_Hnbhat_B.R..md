The Nyayakosha, Compiled by Bhimacharya Jhalkikar, Bombay, Sanskrit Series, XLIX. 1893, available in DLI,

search with "Nyayakosa" you will get many in barcodes. A newer version 4th Edition was available online, link was provided in our group, but now not available.

  

  

The second compiled by Kevalanandasarasvati, under Prajnapathasala granthamala, published in 1952, Wai, Satara Dist. in VI volumes. I am not sure of its availaibility online. Hope it is available for purchase.

  

I got it from some friend, the collection of 7 volumes.
