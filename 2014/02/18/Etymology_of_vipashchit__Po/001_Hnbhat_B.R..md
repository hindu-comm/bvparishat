Have you referred to any commentary or Nirukta for the context where the Rigvedic usages occur?

  

The etymology of Vedic words should not be derived out ouf their contexts and like any other words out of their context, they would not give the same meaning.

  

Here is the general derivation of the very common word विपश्चित् used in any context in classical

  

\[L=32891\] \[p= 4-406\] विपश्चित्, त्रि, (विशेषं पश्यति विप्रकृष्टं चेतति,चिनोति. चिन्तयति वा । पृषोदरादित्वात्साधुः ।) पण्डितः । इत्यमरः ॥ (यथा, मनौ ।७ । ५८ ।

“सर्व्वेषान्तु विशिष्टेन ब्राह्मणेन विपश्चिता ॥”)

  

You may refer to the commentaries for their Vedic usage and meaning. The above is used in the sense the wise, learned etc. All the above derivations are possible with the relevant roots as explained above in the general sense.
