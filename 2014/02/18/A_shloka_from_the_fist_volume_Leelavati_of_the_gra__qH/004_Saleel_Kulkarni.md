नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।



I am still not entirely clear about the last sentence namely, सद्‌ब्रह्मैकमगाधबोधमहिमा सोऽस्याः कविर्भास्करः ॥



Here do we relate the verb बुबुधे to सद्‌ब्रह्मैक्यम्‌?



To whom does अगाधबोधमहिमा pertain?



सः अस्याः कविः भास्करः = he is the कविः (रचयिता?) of this (लीलावती) volume?



Which word suggests the meaning 'popular'?



Kindly guide.

Thanks a lot to Dr. Bhat and Ms. Rupali.



After going through the translation given by Dr. Bhat, the meaning has become quite clear to me. 



{{It is not at all a problem if you know Sanskrit language.}}



I have no hesitation in admitting that as far as the knowledge of Sanskrit is concerned, I am not an expert. I am studying Sanskrit now at not a very young age, just out of love for the language as well as for our cultural heritage.



I wondered why the word अस्याः had been used. It helps me when such simple translations are given for the sake of बालानां सुखबोधाय.



I wonder why the four granthas of Ratnashastra are linked to Bharatamuni’s natyashastra in the Marathi translation.



Thank you again.



In the meantime let us await Ms. Rupali’s email.
