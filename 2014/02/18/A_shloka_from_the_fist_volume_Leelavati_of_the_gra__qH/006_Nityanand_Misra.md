Kulkarni Ji  

  

I suggest we first confirming the reading and variations in reading (if any) of the verse before attempting a word-by-word translation. For example you first sayसद्‌ब्रह्मैकम्‌ and then say सद्‌ब्रह्मैक्यम्‌ - what is the actual reading? Regardingषट् च versus सप्त reading, one again needs to find the exact reading and variations.

  

Can you please start with a full citation (verse number, page number, edition)? If we can trace it to a published source, we have a start. This would also give us the context which would help. I tried searching with some words but could not locate this verse in the digital version of the work here[http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/लीलावती](http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/लीलावती)

  

Are you sure it is a part of the original work or is it a part of a commentary on the work?  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
