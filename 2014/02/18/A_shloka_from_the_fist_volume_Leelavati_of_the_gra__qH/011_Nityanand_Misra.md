Ah, yes! A lapse in concentration, and I read अन्तरम् as अनन्तरम् while translating. Thanks for the correction, here is how it should read –

He who explained/commented on (व्याचष्ट) the eight व्याकरणs and those six संहिताs of physicians (भिषज्s); he who read/studied (अधीते स्म) the six तर्कs, the five गणितs and the four वेदs; he who understood (बुबुधे) the triad of रत्नs, the couple of मीमांसाs and the internal essence of मीमांसाs – the one and true ब्रह्म; that Bhāskara, whose knowledge and glory are unfathomable (अगाधबोधमहिमा) or whose glory comes from his unfathomable knowledge (अगाधबोधमहिमा), is the poet of this \[Līlāvatī\].

By देहलीदीपकन्याय, I have taken मीमांसयोः with both द्वयम् and अन्तरम् – other interpretations are also possible.
