Thanks for the research through the web and the enumeration of the works given in number.

  

In the enumeration, रत्नानां त्रितयं is referred to प्रस्थानत्रय. Popularly, रत्नत्रय is common in Jaina Darshana. Ratnashastra trio is also a possible explanation. And six tarka-s include the two of Mimamsa pairs. Or the two referred may be two schools of of मीमांसा दर्शन, भाट्ट and प्राभाकर. The relationship of त्रितयं द्वयं 32 with नाट्यशास्त्र makes both रत्नानां and मीमांसयोः detached from both numbers, and makes a far fetched relation and leaving the other two without any syntactic relation.

  

A note on your translation:

  

There is मीमांसयोरन्तरम् in the verse, and not as you have translated, अनन्तरम्। A little more modification would make मीमांसयोर्द्वयम्, आन्तरं ब्रह्मैकं बुबुधे would be sequence correct, making the meaning fairly clear without changing the metre मीमांसयोरान्तरं or मीमांसयोरन्तरम्। but it may not mean अनन्तरम् as I can read it making it redundant by one varna.

  

Anyhow, it is not in the original work, probably added by a student or any scribe copying the work..
