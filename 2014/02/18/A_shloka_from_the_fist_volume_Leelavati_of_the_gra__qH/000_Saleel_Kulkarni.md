नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।



I have come across the following shloka from the fist volume (Leelavati) of the grantha SiddhantaShiromani by the Indian mathematician Bhaskaracharya.



अष्टौ व्याकरणानि षट् च (सप्त?) भिषजां व्याचष्ट ताः संहिताः ।

षट् तर्कान्‌ गणितानि पंच चतुरो वेदानधीते स्म यः ॥

रत्नानां त्रितयं द्वयं च बुबुधे मीमांसयोरन्तरे ।

सद्‌ब्रह्मैकमगाधबोधमहिमा सोऽस्याः कविर्भास्करः ॥२६१॥



Are there any mistakes in the text?



In the first line, should it be ‘shat bhishajAm’ or ‘sapta bhishajAm’? (The numbers seem to be serially declining from 8 to 1.)



The Marathi translation I have gives the third line as "three and two (totally five) granthas on Bharatamuni's Natyashastra and both the meemansas were studied by him." Or should it be “four ratnas (whatever that means) and the core of both the memansa-darshanas were studied by him”?



The fourth line is difficult to translate. Is सोऽस्याःcorrect?



What would be the best (closest) translation of the shloka?



Thanks.
