I Googled some more, and have found the verse. It is printed on page 120 of the original text given with Colebrooke’s translation of Līlāvatī with notes by Haran Chandra Banerji, published by Thacker, Spink and Co (Calcutta, 1893). The verse is marked as an interpolation (printed in square brackets) and is printed after verse number 277 (the last verse of Līlāvatī in that edition). It can be seen under this link –

As Dr. Bhat mentioned, the verse is not found in the publication of Līlāvatī along with two Sanskrit commentaries by Anandashram (Pune, 1937), which is available here

Colebrooke has not translated the verse, the 1893 Calcutta edition says it was probably added by a pupil of Bhāskara and provides an English translation (not accurate word-for-word, but good enough) which can be seen here –

The reading as per the 1893 Calcutta edition is –

अष्टौ व्याकरणानि षट् च भिषजां व्याचष्ट ताः संहिताः

षट् तर्कान् गणितानि पञ्च चतुरो वेदानधीते स्म यः।

रत्नानां त्रितयं द्वयं च बुबुधे मीमांसयोरन्तरं

सद्ब्रह्मैकमगाधबोधमहिमा सोऽस्याः कविर्भास्करः॥



As I understand, the Anvaya with desired Adhyāhāra would be as follows –

\[यः\] अष्टौ व्याकरणानि भिषजाम् ताः षट् संहिताः च व्याचष्ट, यः षट् तर्कान् पञ्च गणितानि चतुरः वेदान् \[च\] अधीते स्म, \[यः\] रत्नानाम् त्रितयम् मीमांसयोः द्वयम् अनन्तरम् एकम् सत् ब्रह्म च बुबुधे, सः अगाधबोधमहिमा भास्करः अस्याः \[लीलावत्याः\] कविः \[अस्ति\]



Here is my translation –

He who explained/commented on (व्याचष्ट) the eight व्याकरणs and those six संहिताs of physicians (भिषज्s); he who read/studied (अधीते स्म) the the six तर्कs, the five गणितs and the four वेदs; he who understood (बुबुधे) the triad of रत्नs, the couple of मीमांसाs and after all this the one and ब्रह्म; that Bhāskara, whose knowledge and glory are unfathomable (अगाधबोधमहिमा) or whose glory comes from his unfathomable knowledge (अगाधबोधमहिमा), is the poet of this \[Līlāvatī\].



The names of the eight व्याकरणs, the six संहिताs of भिषज्s, the six तर्कs, the five गणितs, four वेदs, three रत्नs and two मीमांसाs are given by the 1893 Calcutta edition. I am not very convinced that the six तर्कs refer to the six philosophical schools as the two मीमांसाs are already mentioned in the third quarter of the verse.



I guess the translation “popular” given by Bhat Ji is for the word अगाधबोधमहिमा. The 1893 Calcutta edition translates it as “illustrious”.
