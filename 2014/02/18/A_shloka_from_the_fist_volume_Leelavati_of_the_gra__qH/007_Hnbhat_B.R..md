I think it is not part of the text, as the ASS.107 Part 1 starts with the first verse प्रीतिं etc. as given in the above Vikipedia online version and I could not locate in another edition with Telugu commentary, but only the verse is quoted in the introduction by the Editor in Telugu which I could not understand completely the source of the verse, it refers to some introduction of an edition of Lilavati, where it is quoted reads exactly as quoted here by Saleel kulkarni, but for the reading मीमांसयोरन्तरं for मीमांसयोरन्तरे quoted here.

  

With this reading, it means अन्तरे सद्ब्रह्मैकं बुबुधे।

seems to be feasible in structure. The reamaining the same. मीमांसयोर्द्वयं बुबुधे, अन्तरे सद्ब्रह्मैकं बुबुधे।

than the other reading.

  

And not as Kulkarniji, has mentioned,

  

> I wonder why >

as त्रितयं द्वयं would not make 4 grantha-s of Ratnashastra, but only 3 Ratnashastra grantha-s, may रत्नशास्त्र-s by different sages, अगस्त्य, and others two.

and it is popular, मीमांसयोद्वयं is popular for पूर्व and उत्तर twins of मीमांसा. Detaching द्वयं from मीमांसा and त्रितयं from रत्नानां would make an independent number 32, as coceived by the Marathi translation and make it to refer to Bharata-s Natyashastra which contains ३२ chapters as divided by Abhinavagupta to fit to Shaiva siddhanta 32 tattva-s according to the researchers. But for any other explanation, we need to be able wha these numbers refer to. Only explicitly Eight schools of Grammar is popularly known and 4 Veda-s, and Six Darshana-s. as explained by the Telugu commentator. The remaining have to be fixed and there is no commentary is available for the verse as it is not available in the text I have seen with commentaries Anandashrama Series 107 in two parts and the Telugu Edition with Vasanabhashya,
