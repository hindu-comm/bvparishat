I think there is no mistake.

It is casual, unless you have any specific reason to be serial numbers in the verse to make any specific purpose in Ganita. I do not know. But the verse is exactly as you have quoted in another edition also in the same order.

It is not at all a problem if you know Sanskrit language.

The translation/explanation given by a Telugu commentator is this:

  

The poopular Bhaskara,

who had learnt or commented, Eight Vyakarana-s, six Medical texts, and had learned Six Tarka-s (darshana)-s), 4 Veda-s, and known three Ratnashastra, understood the difference between the two् मीमांसा (पूर्व and उत्तर) having realized the unique सद्ब्रह्म, impenetrable profundity, is the author of this (work),

  

Hope this is clear and there is no need for any correction and the above is without any correction to the text.

  

If our member, कवीश्वर रूपालि suggests any translation with correcting the reading above, that would be welcome. But without correction the above is the closest translation in English as informed by the Telugu commentator who himself has commented the गणिताध्याय of लीलावती in Telugu.
