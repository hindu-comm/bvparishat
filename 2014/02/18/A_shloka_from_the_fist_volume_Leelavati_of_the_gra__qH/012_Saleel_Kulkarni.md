My sincere thanks to both, Dr. Bhat and Mishraji.



The meaning of the shloka (together with the variations in the interpretation) is quite clear now.



I did make some typographical errors, for which I owe an explanation.



Regarding षट् च versus सप्त it was just a guess on my part it was like trying to find a missing number in a series, which may not be relevant here.



{{ as त्रितयं द्वयं would not make 4 grantha-s of Ratnashastra }}



That was a stupid typographical error on my part. I meant just three Ratnashastra grantha-s here.



{{ For example you first sayसद्‌ब्रह्मैकम्‌ and then say सद्‌ब्रह्मैक्यम्‌ - what is the actual reading? Regardingषट् च versus सप्त reading, one again needs to find the exact reading and variations.}}



It is सद्‌ब्रह्मैकम्‌ only. If I have written otherwise at any place, it’s my mistake.



Thanks again.
