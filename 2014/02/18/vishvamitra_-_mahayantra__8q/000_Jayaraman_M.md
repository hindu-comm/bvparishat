Dear friends  
  

I am searching for a statement attributed to Sage Vishvamitra  

which says *one should avoid creating great machines in Kaliuga*.  
  

It may sound something like this - "...mahayantrani varjayet"  

I vaguely remember the quote, having heard it from a learned scholar.  
  

  

I solicit help in this regard.  
  
regards  

Dr.M.Jayaraman
