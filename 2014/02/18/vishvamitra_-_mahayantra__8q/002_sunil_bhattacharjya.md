Namaste,  
  
The straight meaning of MS 11.63 can be as follows :  
  
"Taking possession of all mines (source of wealth), inventing big machines, destroying medicinal plants, living on wife's earnings as well as on magic and sorcery.  
  

However the Manu Smriti was specifically meant for the Satya yuga, so says Vedavyas and he requested his father to write one Smriti for the Kali yuga. Thus Manu's injunctions are not strictly meant for this yuga. One should only value the spirit in these injunctions. Manu appears to impose a religious ban only on the cornering of all sources of wealth, inventing big machines for destruction or for doing away completely with human labour, wiping out medicinal plants, not earning livelihood and solely depending on wife's earning and taking recourse to the dark practices.
