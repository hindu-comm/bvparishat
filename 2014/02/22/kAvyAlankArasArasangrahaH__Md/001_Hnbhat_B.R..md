I don't think it is from काव्यालङ्कारसारसङ्ग्रहः and if he had traced it he could have given the refence as the book had been printed long ago. If no, it has to be looked for in the vast Sanskrit Literature and as it is it is a popularly quoted verse without any source. The compilers of
सुभाषितरत्नभण्डागारसंग्रह (p.189, verse 51) quoting this verse, have not given any source either original work or any of the several anthologies who might have quoted them by the name of Udbhata.

  

It may be possible that he might have taken it from any ot the anthologies, quoting the verse attibuting it to Udbhata, without giving the source, which is likely to be the case. The same is quoted with little change

  

"द्विगुरपि सद्वन्द्वोऽहं गृहे च मे नित्यमव्ययीभावः ।

तत्पुरुष कर्मधारय येनाहं स्यां बहुव्रीहिः ॥

  

in सुभाषितावली by श्रीवल्लभदेव Ed. Peterson,

The above is the notes by Editor, which locates it to Kavikanthabharana attributed to Bhatta Muktikalasha.

  

Some other work might have attributed to Udbhata, if Apte attributes it to Udbhata.
