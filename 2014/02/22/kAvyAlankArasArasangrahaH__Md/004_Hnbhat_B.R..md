Thanks Shankar for tracing Kavikanthabharan.  

  

The precise reference to verse quoted is

  

Sandhi 5.35 p.102

  

where he introduces the verse for knowledge of Vyakarana, quoting the verse:

  

व्याकरणपरिचयो यथा भट्टमुक्तिकलशस्य ---

  

with variants as given in the Notes by Dr.Peterson.

  

And the work of Muktikalasha is not known, apart from the quotation than his name. He is said to be the great grand father of Bilhana, the author of Vikramankadevacarita and Caurapancashika,, by the editors in the appendix. No name of his work is given.
