Excellent post Prof. R N Iyengar.

  

I joined this group only today and barely making myself familiar with the group or the topics discussed.

  

Read both the articles posted by you (PDF) (first one only to the extent I could understand.. i.e. in Sanskrit). I found them both educational and informative.

  

I knew about Bapudeva Shastri but was not aware of the background described in one of your PDFs.

  

Thank you

  

Regards,
