Dear Sir,  
At the international conference on Mahabharata hosted by the Department of Sanskrit, Pondicherry, I was privileged to watch and listen to a formidable couple Dr. and Mrs. DK Hari who presented on ppt "historical Krishna". They said this book is online and they also informed that Historical Rama is also on line for reading.They further said that their research is scientifically carried out and is correct from various angles.
