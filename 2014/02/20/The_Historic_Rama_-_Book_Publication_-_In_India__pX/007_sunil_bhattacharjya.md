There are several serious objections to the dating of Lord Rama by the Hari couple. I will just quoteone example for the sake of brevity. They claimed that Ram was to be coronated by Dasaratha at the age of 25 years and that the star positions confirm their date, whereas according to the Valmiki Ramayana Kaushalya was lamenting at the time of Rama's departure to forest that she was looking forward to Rama's attaining the age of 17 when all her worries would be over.
