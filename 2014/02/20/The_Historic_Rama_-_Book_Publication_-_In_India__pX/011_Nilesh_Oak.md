Shri S Jamadagni ji,

  

I have indeed analyzed/critiqued and compared finding of Late Shri Pushkar Bhatnagar with my own proposal.

  

I have also done the same for 3 other (I am aware of total of 5 different proposals including mine) proposals of Ramayana, in my book.

  

I have also discussed aspects of it on my blog.

  

I have let D K Hari and also Saroj Bala made aware of my work on Ramayana (The Historic Rama) and have requested them to provide criticism of it.

  

Regards,

  

Nilesh Oak
