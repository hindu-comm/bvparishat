Namaskaara ..



I have found deep insights and logical elucidations in the research
work of Dr.Hari and Hema Hari. I have also translated their
'Historical Rama' (book and DVD) into Kannada.



D.K.Hari and Hema Hari from Bharath Gyan are engaged in extensive study and research on the treasures of knowledge found in Indian
scriptures. They have published a number of books and DVDs. They also give audio/visual presentations.

Their website gives a detailed notes on their work. [www.bharathgyan.com](http://www.rediffmail.com/cgi-bin/red.cgi?red=http://www.bharathgyan.com&isImage=0&BlockImage=0&rediffng=0&rogue=88cfe1edb8a6ad72741ec8ac2c9e1f06f5e4977e)

Here is a brief note of their book. DVD is also available.

**Historical Rama by **D.K.Hari and Hema Hari , Bharath Gyan

Rama is a Historical king of this land.  
While Divinity is a matter of faith, historicity is a matter of existence.  
Here, the dates of the various key events in Ramayana, including the birth of Rama are historically placed on the timeline using a scientific approach.  
Discover the historicity of the legendary hero Rama and the events of Ramayana, along with one of the oldest surviving man-made structure of this world – The Nala Sethu. The continuous references to this bridge, through the ages, are delineated one after the other.  
This book offers an inter-disciplinary, researched perspective to the historicity of Rama and other key events in the lifetime of Rama.

Books published by Sri Sri Publications Trust & Bharath Gyan are available in Sri Sri book shops.

Namaste  
  
As many of you know there is a researcher-couple (D K Hari & D K Hema Hari) who had earlier come out with a book 'Historical Rama' and recently also a book on 'Historical Krishna'. Their web-site is [www.bharathgyan.com](http://www.bharathgyan.com). It would be interesting to compare findings of Mr.Oak and Mr & Mrs. Hari.  

  
thanks
