Dear Galaji,

  

Sorry for not being able to respond immediately. There was some problem in my computer.

  

There is no denying that Sita lived in Ayodhya for a year before leaving for the forest but that does not mean that Rama was 16 years old just before Rama-Sita wedding nor Kaushalya said that Rama was 17 years old when he was to be coronated and when he left for forest. According to the Valmiki Ramayana Rama a few years younger than 16 years before Rama-Sita wedding and also was also a few years younger than 17 / 18 years at the time of vanvas. 

  

Regards,
