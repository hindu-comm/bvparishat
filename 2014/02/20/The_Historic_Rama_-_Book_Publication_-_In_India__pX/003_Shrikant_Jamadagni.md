Namaste  
  
As many of you know there is a researcher-couple (D K Hari & D K Hema Hari) who had earlier come out with a book 'Historical Rama' and recently also a book on 'Historical Krishna'. Their web-site is [www.bharathgyan.com](http://www.bharathgyan.com). It would be interesting to compare findings of Mr.Oak and Mr & Mrs. Hari.
