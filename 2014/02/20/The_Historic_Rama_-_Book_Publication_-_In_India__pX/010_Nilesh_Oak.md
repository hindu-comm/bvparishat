Jayanthi Manohar ji,

  

I have copy of the book by Late Shri Pushkar Bhatnagar, in which he proposed 5114 BCE as the year of Rama-Janma and then other instance of Ramayana until return of Rama to Ayodhya (5076 BCE).

  

I do not have 'Historical Rama' of D K Hari.

  

(I have written 'The Historic Rama' recently.. not to be confused with 'Historical Rama' of D K Hari).

  

Have authors (D K Hari & Hema Hari) validated timeline of Pushkar Bhatnagar, or simply borrowed timeline of Pushkar Bhatnagar without validation?

  

I have provided analysis and criticism of research of Shri Pushkar Bhatnagar in my book. I was not aware of book by D K Hari, until after I published mine.

  

I know that Ms. Saroj Bala (along with Kulbhushan Mishra) has published a book (2012) in which she has essentially borrowed Ramayana date of Pushkar Bhatnagar.

  

Appreciate your help,

  

Regards,

  

Nilesh Oak
