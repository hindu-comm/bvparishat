I agree with the objection, however I don't think the assertion is originally made by Hari couple.

  

It is my understanding that Hari couple is simply borrowing

proposal of late Shri Pushkar Bhatnagar. Hari have added expanded genealogies of Ikshvaku dynasty.. it seems even more than what is already available in Ramayana/Mahabharata/Harivamsha/Bhagvat Purana.

  

The other conflicting observations (of Valmiki Ramayana ..internal to Valmiki Ramayana) include

  

\(1\) Rama age at the time of his wedding - 13 or 16?

\(2\) Sita's age at the time of her wedding - 6 or \~16?

\(3\) Sita staying in Ayodhya -after her wedding for 1 year or 12 years?

  

References claiming both assertions exists in Valmiki Ramayana and it is a job of any researcher to select between these alternatives and explain the rationale for their selection.

  

I have indeed done that.
