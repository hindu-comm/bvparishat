It is very unlikely that such a recording ever happened, extremly unlikely that Edison was involved, and absolutely untrue that the first recording on a gramophone/phonograph was this. Perhaps you have been taken in by a hoax that seems to be floating around on the internet making such wild claims; please check your sources.
