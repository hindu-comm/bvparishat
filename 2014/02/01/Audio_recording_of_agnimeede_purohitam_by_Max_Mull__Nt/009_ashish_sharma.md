Dear All Learned Scholars and Guruvars  

Pranaam  

First of all thanks to Sh. H.N Bhat Ji who had given a valid proof that Agnimeede was not the 1st gramophone recording and hence following link is most useful ie reference to the book by Georgina Adelaide, the wife of Max Muller:  
<http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-w5d5qucbaQC&lpg=PP1&ots=mpQZBYxEAq&dq=Life%20and%20Letters%20of%20Fred%20Max%20Muller-2%20Vols.%20By%20Max%20Muller%2C%20Friedrich&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false>  
  

This link and other details given by Scholars conclude following points:  

1\. Edison 1st recording was his own voice and that is a nursery rhyme "marry had a little lamb".  

2.Max Mullar did spoke Agnimeede in London but it may be 1st demo in London or some other time demo, which is not clear. But this is true that he used gramophone and recite Agnimeede but as its not 1st recording therefore got no special meaning.  

3\. There is no role of HMV as HMV had recorded voice of one human and that voice was used to be heard by his dog( when that man ie master died) and hence company name called as "His Master Voice" -HMV.  
  

So, in short, this story of Agnimeede is 1st gramophone recording is just a hoax.  

Thanks to all and special thanks to our Guruji Sh. H.N Bhat Ji.  
  

I think we can end up this discussion.
