Namaste. Absolutely. Edison's first recording was the nursery rhyme "mary had a little lamb". Edison struggled to record human voice and play it back.When he succeeded, he said whatever he could remember.His purpose, as a scientist, was the reproduction of human voice, or whatever sound through a mechanical device and not what was so reproduced. That Max Mueller, a German, was in the US keeping him company so as to record Agni meede... beats reason apart from being historically incorrect.
