Dear Shri Misra ji,  
  

I have come across terms like:  
  

1.yougikArthaH (derivative/derived meaning) (yogArthaH?)  
  

2\. mukhyArthaH (primary meaning)  
  

3\. gauNArthaH (secondary meaning)  
  

4\. lakShyArtha (indicated meaning)  
  

5\. rUDhyartha (popular meaning)  
  

I wish to know whether the translations I have given are correct and which of these attain preference/priority while determining the meaning of a given word in a given situation.  
  
Also, is there an overlap of any terms stated above? For example are 3 and 4 the same? And, are 1 and 2 the same? Are there any other terms that could be included in the above list?  
  
I am asking this not with particular reference to the word 'savitR' being discussed here.  
  

regards  
subrahmanian.v
