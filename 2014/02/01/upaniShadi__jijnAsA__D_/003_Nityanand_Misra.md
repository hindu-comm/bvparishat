In this context, there is a brilliant article in English by Pandit Usharbudh Arya (now known as Swami Veda Bharati) on the Gāyatrī Mantra, which gives several meanings of the word Savitṛ as used in the Gāyatrī Mantra. My grandfather gave it to me for reading around seventeen years ago. I no longer have the article with me, but if you could trace it, it would be helpful.
