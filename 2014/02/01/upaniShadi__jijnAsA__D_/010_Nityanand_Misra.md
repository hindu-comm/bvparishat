Subramanian Ji  
  
Dr. Bhat has already answered most of your questions. I can only add that your translations are broadly accurate, and even though generally speaking the principles of योगाद्रूढिर्बलीयसी and गौणमुख्ययोर्मुख्यकार्ये सम्प्रत्ययः are followed, which of the possible meanings takes precedence depends to a great extent on the context. For example, राम in the मङ्गलाचरण of नागेश's works refers to the king रामसिंह of शृङ्गवेरपुर rather than to the यौगिक/रूढि/मुख्य meaning.  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
