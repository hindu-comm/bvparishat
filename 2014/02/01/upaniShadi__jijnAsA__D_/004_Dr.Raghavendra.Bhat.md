Namaste,

Respected Prof H.N.Bhat Ji and Shri Nityananda Mishra Ji I am very grateful to you for your kind guidance.

According to Shankara Bhashya , as I understood, this**सविता इत्यस्य सवितृ**इत्येवार्थः \|\|

  

Shri Mishraji, I will try to get this particular article for more knowledge on "Savitṛ" .

Thank you very much..
