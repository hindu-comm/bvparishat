Namaste!

  

As we all know the word "bhadra" is used several times in the Vedas even in post Vedic literature in sense of blessed, auspicious, fortunate, prosperous etc., I found difficulty to get the exact reference of its derivation. Could anyone please enlighten me about it!

  

Thanking you!
