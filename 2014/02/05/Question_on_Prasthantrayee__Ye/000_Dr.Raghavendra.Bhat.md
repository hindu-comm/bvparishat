Namaste to all,  

I want know whether **Upanishad** is Prasthanatrayee representing Shruti, similarly whether **Bhagavdgeeta** is Prasthanatrayee representing Smriti and whether **Brahmasuutra** is Prasthanatrayee representing Agama????  

I am herewith requesting scholars to enlighten me on this point.  

Dhanyosmi..
