Yes. I only want to add that the Smritis are based on Shruti and if one finds any Smriti not agreeing with Shruti, then one has to refer to Shruti only. However the Bhagavad Gita is such a text, which was told by Lord Krishna in the Yogayukta state (i.e. by the Paripurna Brahman) and what Bhagavad Gita says is indisputable, inspite of the statement that it is called Smritiprasthana.. Adi Shankara rightly calls the Bhagavad Gita as Upanishad
