Namaste  
  

Is there any published edition of the Viṣṇubhakticandrodayaḥ by Nṛsiṁhāraṇya Svāmī? There are manuscripts in several libraries as I found here  
  
<https://archive.org/stream/noticesofsanskri08mitr#page/279/mode/1up> (Entry 2838)  
  
<https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofsansk04wind#page/815/mode/1up> (Entry 2506)  
  

Any pointers would be helpful.  
  

Thanks, Nityanand
