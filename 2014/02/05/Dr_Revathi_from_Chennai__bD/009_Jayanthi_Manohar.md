It is a very sad news. I had shared dais with Dr.Ravathi in several Seminars in Bengaluru organized by our Prof.K.T.Pandurangi and in World Sanskrit conference held in Japan. I remember her dearly as a good meaning person and her good scholarship on Vedanta. May her soul rest in peace.

I am absolutely devastated by this news. She was my guide for my PhD and had become a friend too. May God grant her family fortitude to bear the loss and May her soul rest in peace.
