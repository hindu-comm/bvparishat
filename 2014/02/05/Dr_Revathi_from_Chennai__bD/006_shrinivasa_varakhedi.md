On behalf of BVP I pay deeply felt homage for the departed soul of Dr. Revathy Sukumar. She was not only a very good scholar but also a very nice human being.

  

I personally did not keep much in touch with her often. However, we both used to feel so connected when we used to meet. That was the nature of hers. I think many people have the similar experience. Sanskrit community lost a good scholarly friend.

  

May god give strength to the family members to bear the huge loss caused.

  

Shrivara
