Dear all,

I heard that young scholar in Nyaya and Advaita - Dr Revathi from Chennai has passed away today. This sudden shock disturbs deeply.

I am conveying my condolences to her friends and family. It is a loss to our Sanskrit community.

Praying almighty for her meritorious afterlife,

Srinivasan Acharya, Manipal
