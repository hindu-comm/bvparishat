Sanskrit field has lost a great scholar, student friendly teacher, a good researcher and my dear friend

Sukumar, her husband and her sons are unconsollable.

May God give them the courage to bear this sorrow.

A true Vedanti, Revati, sure, will get sadgati

Shocking news that she passed away in sleep.

She moved as a family friend with student community.

Pray to God to grant her soul rest in peace

And to give courage and strength to husband,

Two sons,father and other family members

To bear this shock.
