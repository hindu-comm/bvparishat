Dear members,  
  

I am forwarding a message from the organisers of World Sanskrit Conference.  
  

I also remind you all to submit your contributions for the section 'Sanskrit and the IT World'.  
  

With regards,  
Amba Kulkarni  
  

co-convener  
'Sanskrit and the IT world'

Greetings from Bangkok, Thailand. This is to inform you that the University Website hosting the Sanskrit Studies Centre ([*www.ssc.su.ac.th*](http://www.ssc.su.ac.th/)) is currently down and often becomes non-functional due to the upgradation work going on at the University. Therefore, we have created alternate website so that the 16th WSC work does not get affected. The following two would work now onwards:*[WWW.SANSKRIT-SILPAKORN.ORG](http://www.sanskrit-silpakorn.org/)*and[*WWW.SANSKRIT-THAILAND.COM*](http://www.sanskrit-thailand.com/). Both First Announcement and Online Registration Form would be accessible from these two new web addresses onwards. When, the Silkpakorn University website will be restored, that will work as the third website. However, we would recommend you to use the new alternate websites as given above.

  
Please inform the concerned scholars. We are sorry for inconvenience.  
  

Regards,

  
  
**Secretariat,  
16th World Sanskrit Conference, 2015  
Sanskrit Studies Centre,  
Silpakorn University, Bangkok, Thailand**
