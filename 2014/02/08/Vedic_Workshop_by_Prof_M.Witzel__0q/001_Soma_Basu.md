Respected Prof. Joshi,  
Yes, so many papers/presentations were of great importance there. In that sense the Kerala workshop might be considered as one of the most interesting and fruitful Vedic workshops happened so far. In fact a few of the presentations were excellent...and you know it is quite impossible to give any sort of impression in a few lines, since papers focussed on so many precise topics as well as broad ones by so many illustrious scholars coming from all over the globe.  
Do not worry, sir, the organizers are going to publish the proceedings within a year or so as they announced about it on the last day. Accordingly they have already invited revised papers from the participants.  
If you like I can post titles of a few papers that I guess would suffice.  
Best,
