Actually,the Vedic conference was a forum for discussion for many important ritualistic/sociocultural/mythological,intercultural/linguistic aspects of the Vedic heritage and it was not very much concerned with the Aryan Invasion theory.Some of the reconstructions of lost traditions were very much impressive.
