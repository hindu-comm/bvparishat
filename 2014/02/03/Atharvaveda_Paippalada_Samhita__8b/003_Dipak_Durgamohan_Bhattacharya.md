I add Arlo Griffiths Kaa.n.das 6-7 Groningen 2009  

Upadhyaya's work is valuable. It could be even more helpful with a critical apparatus ie the manuscript readings. As it stands one does not know what is his correction and what actually occurs in the mnanuscripts. Up to kaa.n.da 15 his corrections are based on Dipak Bhattacharya's edition. After that he adopts Barret's corrections.
