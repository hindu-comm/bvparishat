Respected Scholars,  

I need references of HalAyudha (a. of C. SanjivanI on ChandasUtra). Kindly provide me some references about his identity and state of belonging. If any studies related to HalAyudha is available, kindly provide that reference also.  

I have a query on this also 'Is he same with the famous Dharma writer HalAyudha?'  

With Regards  

Kumuda
