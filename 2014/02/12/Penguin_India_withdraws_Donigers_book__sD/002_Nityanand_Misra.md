Thanks Ajit Ji, I will go through the discussion on those lists to see if any rebuttals are written or planned.

  

Regarding banning works, I agree with you that a ban has no effect in the digital age. However, this case is a bit different, as the book has not been banned by a state/central government. Instead, the publisher has reached an out-of-court settlement and taken back the book. The publisher could have very well fought the case in court (and likely won) with them having much deeper pockets than the people suing them. I think they just wanted to stay away from any bad press (like most businesses), hence their decision to withdraw the book is more driven by "good business sense" than anything else.

  

I would like to add that although various state governments and the Government of India have arbitrarily banned some books in the past, there are quite a few cases where Indian courts have dismissed pleas to ban or seize a book which the petitioners claimed hurt sentiments. Three examples that come to my mind are

  

Chandmal Chopra vs State of West Bengal and others, 1988 Crl. L.J. 739, Calcutta High Court

<http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1594975/>

In this case Chandamal Chopra petitioned the Calcutta High Court to get the Quran banned and stated that the book promoted disharmony and violated Indian law. The petition was dismissed.

  

Sarvadeshik Press an others vs Usman Ghani and others, 2008, CM(M) No.588/2008, Delhi High Court

<http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/801625/>  

In this case Usman Ghani and others petitioned the Delhi High Court to ban the Satyartha Prakash by Dayananda Saraswati 135 years after its first publication, claiming it hurt the sentiments of Muslims. The petition was dismissed.

  

Shiv Asrey Asthana and others vs Union of India and others. Writ Petition No. 8023 (MB) of 2008.

<http://elegalix.allahabadhighcourt.in/elegalix/WebShowJudgment.do?judgmentID=1423192>

This case involved a publication by our Ashram - the critical edition of Ramcharitmanas. The petitioner wanted the book banned and stated that it hurt sentiments of Hindus by tampering with a religious scripture. The Allahabad High Court dismissed the petition.
