Namaste  

  

For those who are interested - Doniger's book *The Hindus: An Alternate History* has been withdrawn from all dealers, and all unsold copies with the publisher (Penguin India) are to be "pulped".

Without getting into the debates and opinions in media, op-eds and in political circles on the action by Penguin India, I want to know if any of our traditional scholars in India have thought of writing a "rebuttal book" in response to this work. It could be a collaborative effort, but something like Karpatra Swami's brilliant critical writings of some western works and philosophies (e.g. chapters in Vedartha Parijata II and Marxvada Aur Ramarajya) is something which I desire to see.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
