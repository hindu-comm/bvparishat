Misraji

Pranaam. I have not come across any such rebuttal from a traditional scholar. The only long rebuttal, which has been written by a practicinb with a good knowledge of Hindu texts and traditions is found here: <http://vishalagarwal.voiceofdharma.com/articles/thaah/>

Vishal began a chapter wise criticism. Though it is not complete, it is cetainly a good work.

Ravilochanan
