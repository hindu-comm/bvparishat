Thanks for the link. I went through some of the chapter-wise rebuttals by Vishal Agrawal. Good work by Vishal as you say, and it would be great if he or somebody else could build on it, complete it, and publish it. I think this is the type of response that is required.

  

One of the best rebuttals of western interpretations by a traditional scholar is by Svāmī Hariharānanda Sarasvatī (Dharmasamrāṭ Karapātra Svāmī) in the extensive Hindi work Rāmāyaṇa Mīmāṁsā (which runs into more than 1000 pages), where Karapātra Svāmī has refuted the many opinions and interpretations of Camille Bulcke and many other western or west-influenced writers. The book can be seen here and is probably the gold standard in critical analysis -
