Respected Scholars,  

I need the information regarding mention of writing materials (viz. bhurja patra, Padma patra etc.) in KAlidAsa's works. In AbhijNAnashAkuntalam and VikramorvashIyam he mentions about padma patra and Bhurja patra. If there are some more information available kindly let me know.  

With Regards  

Kumuda
