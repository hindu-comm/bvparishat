Namaste Dr. Joshi,  
  

Some exaggeration is bound to be there in Mahakavyas and they are to be understood as Alankar but that does not mean that one can dismiss the historicity of the the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, just due to these exaggerations. The geart Archimenian empire in Persia was hardly 25 - 26 centuries old, whereas the Mahabharata era was more than 50 centuries old and the Ramayana era was still older. In that context if one compares the times of the Archimenian empire with the times of the Ramayana nd Mahabharata one is bound to get unfavourable reaction. If you are sanguine that the Mahabharata war took place at the time of the Archimenian times or if you think the story of the Mahabharata does not have a grain of truth you will have to let the people know about your findings in a dispassionate way. One cannot just wish away the Mahabharata and Ramayana times as being mere fictitious.  

  

Thanks,  

Sunil KB
