Dear Dr. Iyengar

  

This happens all the time!! The culprit is this edit made a few days back

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parashara&diff=594792552&oldid=592182805>

  

The claim was added by a user whose account name is "Vhsatheeshkumar".

You may want to leave a message on the talk page of the user or the aticle and request editors to change. Or you may edit the article yourself to set things right. As far as I know, it is acceptable to cite your own books or works on Wikipedia as long as they do not violate other policies.

  

If I were you, I would not bother too much. Articles keep changing every day on Wikipedia and the more active user who can argue at length citing Wikipedia policies usually wins. Even some Administrators on Wikipedia are biased and ganging up is common. The fact that there is no "editorial board" to take responsibility for the published content, and that most top administrators and active editors are people who do not share their personal details makes Wikipedia editors more of anonymous hackers than editor scholars. One does not trust masked people and anonymous/pseudonymous authors. Take a look at the below link

Thanks, Nityanand
