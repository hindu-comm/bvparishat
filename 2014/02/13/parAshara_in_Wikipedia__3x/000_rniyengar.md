Dear Scholars,

Recently an article has appeared on ‘Parāśara’ in Wikipedia

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parashara> up dated on 12th February 2014. The article says:

“In his book Parasharatantra,^([\[6\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parashara#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parashara#cite_note-7))[R. N. Iyengar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._N._Iyengar "R. N. Iyengar")has reconstructed the book Parashara Smṛtiattributed to Rigvedic Maharishi Parashara.”

The author of the Wiki article has not read my book! His sources above are not primary references. One more example of Wiki being unreliable and less than scholarly about Indic subjects, on either side of the E-W divide. I like to inform the discerning readers that

i\) I have not claimed Parāśaratantra to be a reconstruction of the Parāśara-Smrti.

ii\) I have nowhere said that the author of the Tantra was the Rgvedic Rsi Parāśara.

It is found that the Indian History working group and the Hindu Mythology Wikiproject are supporting the article. While it is nice to learn about the projects I request the managers of the above groups to be factual when referring to others work. I find that there is a tendency among a group of culture/history activists to collapse all similar or same sounding Rsi names into one progenitor name.

About Parāśara the originator of the Tantra after a long discussion on works ascribed to Parāśara (Horāśāstra, siddhānta, Purāna, Upa-purāna, RV 1.65-1.73; RV 7.124.21, RV 9.99.31-44) and references, Nirukta (6.30), Āśvalāyana śrauta sūtra (12.15), Teachers list in the Kauthuma branch of Sāmaveda, I have written:

"**Identity of Parāśara**……… ……… ………. As is typical of ancient Indian authors, the identity of Parāśara who composed or stated the *tantra* standing in his name is not known. It is likely there were several persons belonging to different generations identified by the same family name…… …. ….In fact Parāśara is a family (*gotra*) name prevalent to this day in many parts of India. Hence it is reasonable to surmise that the primary author of Parāśaratantra should have been adescendantin the line of the Rgvedic Parāśara."

I hope the Wiki author will read this post and edit his article.

Regards

RN Iyengar
