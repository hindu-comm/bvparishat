Sir Iyengar,

  

You can join Wiki yourself, and edit topics. That is one of the basic tenants of Wiki, that people contribute and clarify topics as to factual correctness. They rely on persons, such as yourself, to correct. And since you are the author of the (mis)quoted information, you have much power in the editing, I will assume.  
  
Regards,
