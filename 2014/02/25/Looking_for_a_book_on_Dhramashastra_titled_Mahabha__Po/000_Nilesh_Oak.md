Namaskar to all,

  

This is a request for help.

  

If anyone has it (or know of a specific source/location) where they know this document exists, please let me know.

  

(Please do not suggest generic locations - a specific library or BORI library or a specific publisher.. unless you have first hand knowledge that the above document exists at that source)

---

S B Dikshit refers to this document in his book (written some 100 years ago and a classic) 'Indian History of Astronomy'(originally written in Marathi, but translated in English and published by Indian National Science Academy in 1969.)

  

This book is not to be confused with 'Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya'.

  

Appreciate your help,

  

Regards,

  

Nilesh Oak
