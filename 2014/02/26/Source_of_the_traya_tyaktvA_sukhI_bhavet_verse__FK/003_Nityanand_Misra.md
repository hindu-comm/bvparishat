Ha ha. No, शूकरीविष्ठा प्रतिष्ठा is not a term or a specific type of प्रतिष्ठा to be defined, but a metaphor. It literally means प्रतिष्ठा (reputation/eminence/fame) is nothing but porcine feces – the excrement (विष्ठा) of a sow (शूकरी). शूकर्या विष्ठा शूकरीविष्ठा (षष्ठीतत्पुरुष).  

A question could arise why the poet used शूकरीविष्ठा and not शूकरविष्ठा. I do not know if there is something special about शूकरीविष्ठा which sets it apart from शूकरविष्ठा. Probably the choice of शूकरी over शूकर was made for metrical/euphonic reasons - to make the sixth syllable heavy (गुरु).
