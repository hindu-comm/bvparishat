Anyhow the metaphor is the same as the earlier two also, in common, to  
be despised, whether it is विष्ठा or शूकर or शूकरी, which needs not be  
discussed.  
  
"श्लोके षष्ठं गुरु ‘ज्ञेयं" is popular one of the requirements of  
Anushthup, which exactly fits in री as suggested. But doesn't make  
any more to add to the exrcetion, which is to be despised. One may ask  
some veternary doctor, if they make any difference. But the syllable र  
in शूकर will certainly make the metre deficient.  
  
And this doesn't make any difference to the idea conveyed by the  
metaphors alike, that are to be abandoned alike, being despised, to be  
happy.
