Namaste  
  
I would like to cite the following verse in a work I am editing currently. Any pointers on the original source and variations (if any) would be much appreciated. Google search did not help me.  
  

अभिमानं सुरापानं गौरवं घोररौरवम्।

प्रतिष्ठा शूकरीविष्ठा त्रयं त्यक्त्वा सुखी भवेत्॥

abhimānaṁ surāpānaṁ gauravaṁ ghorarauravam

pratiṣṭhā śūkarīviṣṭhā trayaṁ tyaktvā sukhī bhavet

Thanks, Nityanand
