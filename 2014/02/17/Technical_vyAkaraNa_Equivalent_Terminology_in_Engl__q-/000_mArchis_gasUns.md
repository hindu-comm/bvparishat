Namaste,

  

Is there any work done by pāṇini scholars so far on coining Sanskrit Grammar equivalent terms in English? Eg. it-varṇa (इत्)= indicator letter/marker; In Abhyankar we do find English explanations, but for most technical terms, there are not any exact coined words or literal translations that could express the idea. For Eg. what are the terms for pratyAhAra, ayogavāha etc.? (With due consideration of inability of a language expressing an idea from other language precisely) can we call pratyAhAra as “abbreviated letter series” and ayogavāha as “non-enunciated letters” {ayogavAha- yoga=uapdesha=instruction; original enunciation; first or original precepts or teaching" So the idea is= they came without being enunciated. "un-enunciated" or "non-enunciated letters} Any help in this line? Anywhere seriously dealt? Renou is great, but has no etymologies. Bothlingk has not even that. Kartre's index to Panini has no real translations.
