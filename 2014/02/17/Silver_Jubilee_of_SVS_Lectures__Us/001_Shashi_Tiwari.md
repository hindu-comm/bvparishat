Dear Dr N bandyopadhyay

Namaste

  

Thanks for informing about program at our institute.

After returning from USA I have to go to Lucknow twice as my mother expired.

I could not get time to improve my paper for your journal. Is that vol
complete ?

Now I can send within a week if you permit.

Regards

Shashi
