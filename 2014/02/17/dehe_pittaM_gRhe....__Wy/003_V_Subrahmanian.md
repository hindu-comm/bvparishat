Namaste

  

Thanks Shri Bhat ji, for the wonderful rectification of the verse. This verse is one of the several under the theme 'lakShmIH' (wealth). So, if anyone can give the meaning so as to make some good sense it would be fine. As a sample, here is another verse in that group, just to give an indication of the 'tenor' of the verses chosen by the compiler:

  

पूज्यते यदपूज्योऽपि यदगम्योऽपि गम्यते ।

  

वन्द्यते यद्वन्द्योऽपि स प्रभावो धनस्य च ॥
