Thanks Shankarji for the suggestion. The least modification would set right will be reading the verse to mean the same as

  

देहे पित्तं गृहे वित्तमेकचित्तं कुटुम्बिनाम् ।

ज्येष्ठापत्यमतिश्रेष्ठं न भवन्ति गृहे गृहे ॥

  

  

Interpretation may depend on the intended sense is literal or if there is any काकु thereby in the context.
