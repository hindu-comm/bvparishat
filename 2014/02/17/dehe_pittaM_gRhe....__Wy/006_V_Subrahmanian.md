Thanks Sri Ashok ji for the nice explanation. 

  

In the case of bile, one could perhaps take it in the positive sense since the status of bile in Ayurveda is understood to be something very high. So, the adequate level of bile in a body is quite beneficial and that way, it is rare. Though kapha and vAyu too play important roles, it could be said that only pittam is mentioned in the verse, by way of upalakShaNa, and to rhyme with the author's other chosen words: vittam, chittam, etc.

As you opine even I feel the gRhe in the first occurrence is a little odd.
