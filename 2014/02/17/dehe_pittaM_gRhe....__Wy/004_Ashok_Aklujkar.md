Any emendation proposed should be transcriptionally probable as far as possible; that is, the original or older reading proposed should be such as can probably lead to the (corrupt or inferior) reading found in the manuscript(s). With this consideration (and the syntax and the most likely authorial intention) in mind, I suggest that ;sre.s.tham be changed to ;srai.s.thyam; that is, the corruption witnessed at present should be thought of as having the following direction: श्रैष्ठ्यं --> श्रेष्ठं.  
  
The author's intention is clearly to list things that, \*according to his/her observation,\* are not found in all households -- are relatively rare (note na bhavanti g.rhe g.rhe). The syntax of the words that precede this predication must then consist primarily of words in the nominative case that can serve as the grammatical subjects of the verb bhavanti. Taking jye.s.tha-putra-mati-;sre.s.tham as an accusative or as an adjective will not do.  
  
If the observations stringed in the verse should be profound, but it is not absolutely necessary that they be so. The charm of such verses remains (even if it does not lead to great poetry) as long as there is a thread or string on which the listed items can hang.  
  
Some relatively superficial or surface-level feature like shared gender (in this case neuter) or grammatical number (in this case singular) can lead to symmetry and reinforce the feature of stringing or increase the charm of the verse but it does not really lead to great poetry.  
  
Meaning: "(The state of) bile in body is not found in every house (= it is not the case that someone suffers from bile in every house). (The state of) money in the house is not found n every house (= it is not the case that every house has money at hand / readily available ). (The state of) one mind of family members s not found in every house (= it is not the case that unanimity of family members exists in each house) . (The state of) supremacy of the intelligence of the eldest son is s not found in every house (= it is not the case that the eldest son is the brightest person in each house OR it is not the case that the view/thought of the eldest son is accorded the highest respect in each house)."  
  
g.rhe in the first paada is odd. Could it originally have been mahe 'in celebration, for festivities'?
