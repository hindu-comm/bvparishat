Namaste  
  

Here is a verse from a book on 'subhAShitam-s':  
  

देहे पित्तं गृहे वित्तमेकचित्तं कुटुम्बिनाम् ।  

*ज्येष्ठपुत्रमतिश्रेष्ठं* न भवन्ति गृहे गृहे ॥  
  

I would like the meaning of the verse to be explained. I also have a problem with the highlighted portion above, which is in the dviteeyA.  
  

regards  
subrahmanian.v
