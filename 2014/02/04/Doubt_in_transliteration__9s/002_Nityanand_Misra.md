To the best of my information, even though IAST has been the de facto standard academic transliteration scheme for a long time (“standard” as in the adjective, see [here](http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/standard_2)), there is no written “specification” of IAST. Therefore, IAST is more of a “convention” rather than a “standard” (“standard” as in the noun, see [here](http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/standard_1)).

The IAST developed from the *Rapport de la Commission de Transcription* which was the outcome of the Tenth International Congress of Orientalists in 1894. The report in French and its translation are attached. This report suggested using ṁ for the Anusvāra (lowercase m with dot above, which in Unicode is U+1E41) and m̐ for the Anunāsika (lowercase m with combining Candrabindu mark, may not render perfectly on your screen, which in Unicode is two characters – U+006D followed by U+0310). As per this scheme one would write –

होतारं रत्नधातमम् as hotāraṁ ratnadhātamam

स देवाँ एह वक्षति as sa devām̐ eha vakṣati

Some IAST practitioners made some minor changes to the Congress’ report, and started using ṃ for Anusvāra and ṁ for Anunāsika (which was suggested for Anusvāra in the *Rapport*). This is the scheme used by Prof. Gérard Huet of INRIA on the Sanskrit Heritage Site. As per this convention, one would write –

होतारं रत्नधातमम् as hotāraṃ ratnadhātamam

स देवाँ एह वक्षति as sa devāṁ eha vakṣati

In contrast, some other practitioners retained the same convention as the *Rapport* suggested for the Anusvāra, but started using the combining Candrabindu mark with the previous vowel for Anunāsika. This is the scheme followed by Gita Press. As per this convention, one would write –

होतारं रत्नधातमम् as hotāraṁ ratnadhātamam

स देवाँ एह वक्षति as sa devā̐ eha vakṣati

See the transliteration of जहाँ and कहाँ on page 16 of Hanuman Chalisa by Gita Press which is attached and is also available [here](http://www.gitapress.org/BOOKS/1528/1528%20Hanuman%20chalisa.pdf).


As there is no “IAST standard” (to my information), any of the above should be fine. Please use one, and clarify in some Appendix or at the beginning of your document which one you are using.

As an aside, maybe the Second Sanskrit Commission can suggest combining the variant conventions into a single “IAST standard” and recommend the use of the same.
