This could be because in the International Phonetic Alphabet, nasalization of vowel is indicated by the combining tilde diacritic mark.  
  
In general the combining diacritic (tilde or candrabindu) may create problems when used with long vowels and with ल् (अनुनासिकाननुनासिकभेदेन यवला द्विधा as the LSK says), where the diacritic mark may be too close or overlap with the vowel or consonant.  
  
Actually even with Devanagari, there is an issue with writing अनुनासिक य व and ल. When one uses य्ँ व्ँ ल्ँ, it is clear but there is no way to differentiate between य्ँ + अ and य् + अँ and य्ँ + अँ in almost all modern digital Devanagari fonts.
