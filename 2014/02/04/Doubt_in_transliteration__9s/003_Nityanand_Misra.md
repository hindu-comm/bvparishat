It is not recommended to use U+0981 in IAST. The reason is that 0980 to 09FF are a part of the Unicode character set for Bengali. See here <http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0980.pdf> . As it is a part of Bengali character set, all Roman/Latin fonts may not support it.  
  

For the same reason, it is not recommended to use U+0901 in IAST, since it is a part of the Unicode character set for Devanagari. See here <http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0900.pdf>  
  

Whereas U+0310 is a part of the Combining Diacritical Marks block of the Unicode standard. See <http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf> Any font that supports this block will support U+0310. Roman/Latin fonts are more likely to support these than Bengali/Devanagari characters.
