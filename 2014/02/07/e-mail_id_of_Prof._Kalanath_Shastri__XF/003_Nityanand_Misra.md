Kalānātha Ji's son, Dhīrendra Devarṣi Ji (who is a lecturer in Zoology), uses email. Twice I have requestedKalānāthaJi for copies of his articles in the Bhāratīmagazine (of which Kalanath Ji is the editor) and his son has emailed me scans of the articles both the times. Those interested in contact details of Dhīrendra Devarṣi Ji may contact me off this mailing list.

  

Full contact details of many scholars, including the address and phone number of KalānāthaJi which Pandurangi Ji provided below, are available in the Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars (ISBN 978-93-86111-85-2) which is available for download here -

One may want to search in this book before asking questions on the list.

  

Sharing of personal email address or other contact details are best done off the list (since BVP is a public group) as Ajit Ji has already mentioned.
