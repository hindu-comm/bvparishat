I was shocked to hear the untimely demise of Professor Revati, who had carved out a niche for herself with her all -round scholarship and the spirit of dedication she always showed for the cause of Sanskrit.She was so thorough in Vedanta and Nyaya and it was always a great delight to hear her talk on tricky problems of Indian philosophy.Her enthusiasm was contageous. She was a dedicated teacher and very proficient in music also.What a pity fate has snatched her away when the world of Sanskrit scholars was expecting from her many many more contributions!May her soul rest in peace!
