For those people who would like a translation of the sanskrit quote I inserted in my email:

  

here is the translation

"

It seems like for this very same purpose, a great expert in different schools of philosophical thought (darsanas) and a great thinker, Srimad Abhinava Ranganatha Parakala Swamy was born on this earth. He never valued unnecessary protocols and supported only the truth rather than the personalities or the tradition (sampradaya) they belonged to. He used to often say openly in front of several people: “I will not agree if someone says Bhagavad rAmAnuja is the only avatAra purusa (divine saint who has descended here to preach the ultimate truth)!”. He strongly believed that even though various later writers explained different philosophical works in different ways, the original pioneers in different systems of philosophy are all great saints. Depending on the level of maturity of the aspirants around them, and based on the
times and places they belonged to, these saints had to use different words and strategies to teach people. However, many later writers who explained the works of these pioneering founder AchAryas, probably could not extricate themselves from their own preconceived opinions and turned these philosophies upside down by focusing too much on the words.



In essence, the work started by Sri SankarAchArya was completed by Bhagavad rAmAnuja.



When I was trying very hard to digest the meanings of the teachings without paying attention to symbolisms, by contemplating on these for a long time, I had the grace of the all knowing bhagavan Sri Ranga Maha Guru (Sri Ranga-vishnu), of Hedathale, due to whose causeless mercy, all the doubts within me melted away just like how fog disappears in the sunlight. Several times, Bhagawan Sri Rangaguru clearly told that “If Sri Ramanujacharya was born at the time of Sri SankarAchArya, he would also have followed the methodology of Sri SankarAchArya. Similarly, if Sri SankarAchArya had taken birth at the time of Sri Ramanujacharya, he would have followed the path of Srimad Ramanujacharya. There is no doubt that their hearts are one and the same. The difference in the usage of words and style of language are consistent with their times and is unavoidable”.
