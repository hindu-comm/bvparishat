Namaste

  

I read through a few of the ten-page paper and observed the following:

  

1.  The Acharya (KSV) says on page 5 that Shankara has not cited even a
    single shruti passage in the 'adhyAsa bhAShyam' \[preamble to
    Shankara's Brahmasutrabhashya\]. Actually there is one passage
    'brAhmaNo yajeta' in that document which appears to be a shruti
    passage: Sanskrit commentary to Bh.gitA 2.22 by Sri Neelkantha  
    ननु 'ब्राह्मणो यजेत','जातपुत्रः कृष्णकेशोऽग्नीनादधीत' इति आत्मानं
    वयोवर्णादिविशेषणवन्तमेवाधिकृत्य कर्मविधयः प्रवर्तन्ते तेन
    नीलादुत्पलमिव देहादन्य आत्मावधारयितुं न शक्यत इत्याशङ्क्याह --
    वासांसीति।Also in the
    [bhATTadIpikAhttp://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SabdaSaarasvataSarvasvam/index.php/Mimamsa:Bhattadipika-4](http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SabdaSaarasvataSarvasvam/index.php/Mimamsa:Bhattadipika-4)

    "यदि 'ब्राह्मणो यजेते" त्यादिश्रुतैर्वाक्यैः ब्राह्मणकर्तृत्वस्य
    विधानात्कर्तुश्च From this document in the URL we understand that
    this vAkyam is taken as the 'viShayavAkyam' in the original mImAmsA
    work/s. Shankara has cited this vAkyam in the adhyAsa bhAShyam.

2.  The Acharya says that 'pariNAmavAda is the one admissible by
    'knowers' (jnAni-ns) and 'vivartavAda' is advocated by ajnAni-s'.
    Such a view is certainly not a correct representation of Advaita
    doctrine, even if the Acharya wants to end up arriving at a
    samanvaya of the three schools. For, in the famous Advaitic work

      
    विवर्तवादस्यपूर्वभूमिः वेदान्तवादे परिणामवादः ।  
    व्यवस्थितेऽस्मिन् परिणामवादे स्वयं समायाति विवर्तवादः ॥  
    SankshepashAreeraka.2.61  
      
    \[The doctrine of transformation (sAnkhya) is the one that just
    precedes the doctrine of transfiguration (vivarta) of the Vedanta.
    Once the former is well grasped, the latter falls in place by
    itself.\]  
      
    ****The Ratnaprabha for BSB of Shankara (2.1.14) at the end quotes a
    verse in this connection:कृपणधीःपरिणाममुदीक्षते क्षयितकल्मषधीस्तु
    विवर्तताम्(source not provided). \[‘The unprepared aspirant
    understands only the ‘creation, transformation’ scheme whereas the
    one who has purified his mind of all dross is able to appreciate the
    ‘transfiguration’ vivarta of Atman/Brahman as appearing as the world
    and jIva-s.’\]

3.  In shankara's prasthAnatraya bhAShya-s themselves one can see a lot
    of explicit evidence for his adhering to the vivartavAda. For
    example:1. त्वमपि तत्त्वदर्शिनां दृष्टिमाश्रित्य शोकं मोहं च हित्वा
    शीतोष्णादीनि नियतानियतरूपाणि
    द्वन्द्वानि*'विकारोऽयमसन्नेव**मरीचिजलवन्मिथ्यावभासते'*इतिमनसिनिश्चित्यतितिक्षस्व
    इत्यभिप्रायः।। in Bh. Gitaa BhAShyam 2.16 or when He concludes. In
    the famous tadaikShata' of the chandogya regarding Brahman's
    sankalpa to create the universe, shankara says:6.2.3:तत्सत् ऐक्षत
    ईक्षां दर्शनं कृतवत् । ....इदं तु चेतनं ईक्षितृत्वात् । तत्कथमैक्षत
    इत्याह - बहु प्रभूतं स्यां भवेयं प्रजायेय प्रकर्षेणोत्पद्येय । यथा
    मृद्घटाद्याकारेण यथा वा रज्ज्वादिसर्पाद्याकारेणबुद्धिपरिकल्पितेन ।
    ....एवम्*ईक्षित्वा*तत्तेजोऽसृजत तेजः सृष्टवत् ।

4.  In the document the Acharya says: 'How many advaitins are aware that
    Shankara never said that the jagat is mithyA? ' One can easily see
    that such is not the view of both the lay and the laity with regard
    to Advaita and Shankara's works/views.

5.  Then there is the other charge that 'Shankara's followers did not
    understand Shankara' See p.5.

6.  This paragraph on p.5 appears contradictory to the avowed
    'samanvaya' of the three matha-s: ![Inline image
    1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/d7046c2df3d3664b/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)
    The Acharya says in some places that he has substantiated in the
    main book what he says in the document. In any case what one opines
    after reading the above document is what I have stated above.
