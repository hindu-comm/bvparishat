Are we judging an essay by its title (something like judging a book by its cover)? Ṣaḍdarśanasamanvaya by Omānanda Tīrtha is a view like any other view. One may agree or disagree with him, just like one may agree or disagree with any Vedānta school. A strong believer in any of the Vedānta schools would disagree with him because his position contradicts that of all schools, but that does not make his work any less worthy than their views.  
  
Even though I personally do not agree with some of the author's conclusions, but I still say it is a very good work, replete with citations from Vedas and Darśana works. I would recommend one reads it rather than dismiss it altogether. He talks about different Vedānta schools from the perspectives of Heya, Heyahetu, Hāna and Hānopāya (as defined in the Sāṁkhya-Yoga tradition), and arrives at some insights and conclusions. He does not claim all Vedānta schools as Tuccha or Aprāmāṇika as Cidghanānada Purī suggests. Ṣaḍdarśanasamanvaya is critical and appreciative of aspects in all Vedānta schools, and his view may indeed have takers outside the Vedānta schools, especially in the Sāṁkhya-Yoga tradition.

It is very much possible, by not taking the two systems completely at face value. Let's say aspects of theory A and theory B are contradictory. Somebody proposes a new theory C, which dismisses some aspects of A and some aspects of B, and adds new some aspects and says "Theory C establishes a middle ground between A and B." Adherents of theory A and B do not agree with C since it contradicts aspects of both A and B, but just that does not make theory C less authoritative than theory A or theory B, nor do the contradictions between theories A and B mean nobody can propose a new theory seeking middle ground.

As with any tradition in India, there are schools and sub-schools and sub-sub-schools which contradict each other at places. This is not limited to Vaiṣṇavas only. But there does exists a Catuḥsampradāya tradition which accommodates the various Vaiṣṇava schools together, treating all of them as authentic. For more, one may refer the history and tradition of the Galta Gaddi and the coming together of four Vaiṣṇava schools in 1713 CE at Galta near Jaipur.
