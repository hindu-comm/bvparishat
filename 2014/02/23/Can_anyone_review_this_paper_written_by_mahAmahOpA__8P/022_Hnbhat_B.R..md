This is the often quoted verse of Vakyapadiya:

  

yatnenānumito 'py arthaḥ kuśalair anumātṛbhiḥ /  
abhiyuktatarair anyair anyathaivopapādyate // BVaky_1.34 /  

  

यत्नेनानुमितो ऽप्यर्थः कुशलैरनुमातृभिः /

अभियुक्ततरैरन्यैरन्यथैवोपपाद्यते\|\|

  

This is what has been happening throught the history of Indian Philosophy till date. Why should we dispute if the followers of the group uphold their ones above others? As learners, we only have to follow and understand what they say really without any pre-occupation. In the case of modern critics or writers, we are free to pass our criticism or comments, but with logical content which may not be limited to the message box in a mailing list to quote all the texts required to support our contention and may have to write another book than simply dragging the discussion.

  

This is my sincere opinion and not any criticism against the scholars who contribute to this thread.
