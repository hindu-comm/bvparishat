This is also the case with the 3 volume book "The Brahmasutra-s and their principal commentaries" by BNK Sharma (Published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai between 1971-78) which purports to undertake **a critical study of the three commentaries of--Sankara, Ramanuja and Madhva,** but which ends up with the usual proclaiming that Madhva's interpretation alone is the logical and correct one in all the adhikaraNa-s.  
  
That apart, is such a "unity" logically possible ? !!!  
For, Sankara stands apart among all these commentators as the champion of "निर्विशेषब्रह्म" as the supreme reality whereas all others do not hold such a view at all.
