Only satyAnveShaNa was presented to us for review. And, hence we read only that and presented views on the same.  
  

BTW, if satyAnveShaNa is not complete in itself why should author tag it a 'grantha-ku\~njikA' ?  

So, clearly the author thinks that the gist of the whole book is in his introduction and reviewing it means testing his whole view.

I don't think that he is repecting other AchArya-s. If he states that madhvAchArya and bhagavatpAda sha\~Nkara has not understood truth and/or not propounded the same, how is he respecting them.  

He is just taking granted that rAmAnujAchArya-s bhAShyam is correct. This shows his bias.

I've no problem whatever he does regarding sAdhanA. His personality has nothing to do with his writing. If he could write impartially, anyone will respect him.  

We could not find that and hence we are showing what impression we get on reading.
