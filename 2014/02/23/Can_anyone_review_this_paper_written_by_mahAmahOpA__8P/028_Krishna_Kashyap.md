Thanks, Sri Vishvas Ji.

  

In the earlier thread, there was no serious review of this book,

since only the intro to the book was sent out earlier.

  

However, the whole book is available on the archive now.

  

<https://archive.org/details/tattvamuktaakalaapa-sarvankasha-sri-ksv>  

  

If anyone wants to go through the details in this book, they will get a better view of what the author wanted to state.

This is an 895-page book. I personally think it is very deep work. I am sure that even if many respected scholars may not agree with Sri KSV; however, I am sure that reading his work shows the sophistication of the author's presentation, definitely will challenge strongly held views and will influence their thought-process.

  

I am sure that a serious reader will gain a lot of knowledge from this book.

Great scholars have stated that this book of Tattva Mukta Kalapa is where Sri Vedanta Desika establishes his mastery over Darshana shastras. Sri KSV's commentary definitely adds value to this original work of Sri Vedanta Desika.

I have spent several years (off and on) reading and thinking about the content of this book and have immensely benefittedfrom this work.
