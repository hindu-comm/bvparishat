*Several times, Bhagawan Sri Rangaguru clearly told that “If Sri Ramanujacharya was born at the time of Sri SankarAchArya, he would also have followed the methodology of Sri SankarAchArya. Similarly, if Sri SankarAchArya had taken birth at the time of Sri Ramanujacharya, he would have followed the path of Srimad Ramanujacharya. There is no doubt that their hearts are one and the same. The difference in the usage of words and style of language are consistent with their times and is unavoidable”.  
  
*

The above statement is nothing but placating both which actually does not carry any meaning or conviction nor does it achieve any purpose.  
  
If for argument's sake *there is no doubt that their hearts are one and the same*, then why a long criticism of Advaita in the form of LaghupuurvapakSha and still longer Saptavidha anupapatti in the Sribhaashya ???  
  
As I had said earlier, the basic concept of निर्विशेषब्रह्म and जगन्मिथ्यात्व of Advaita can never be accepted by any other Vedanta teacher, and when these fundamental concepts held by Advaita Vedanta are so much disputed by all others, how can there be a 'matasamanvaya' among these systems.  
It is only an exercise in futility.
