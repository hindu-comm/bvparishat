Let me clarify my first post.

  

1\) **Acharya KSV did not try to attempt unification of 3 systems.** If he attempted unification of three systems, he probably would have named the paper as " Tri-matha samanvaya". I wrote in my first email as "he sort of unifies these three systems" in a haste. That was my mistake. I thought that if one reads the paper with a calm unbiased mind they would figure the intent of the author clearly. Acharya's intent was only to do "sathyAnvEshana" or enquiry into the truth behind these three systems of thought. For clarification i have inserted author's own views on this aspect.

I would advise the readers to carefully read the original paper without reading in between lines from this inserted quotation. Acharya KSV has spent 70+ years to come to the conclusions and people who know him well know that he has attempted a very sincere unbiased study. One should read his "SarvankaSA commentary" which is about 800 pages in sanskrit which deals with almost any philosophical view of India. It is a classic book on darsana. If you are interested, please write to me and I will send information regarding how you can obtain that book, which is about.

  

2\) I will check with my advisors regarding the other "criticisms of this paper" and figure out the details and write about what I find. I dont find too much time for this due to my workload. Hence it may take a while.
