More "criticisms", "diasgreements" or "dismissals" than "reviews" here. :) I have not read the work (in fact none of Acharya's works except the Amrtakataka commentary on VR edited by him), but does the respected Acharya himself state that his work attempts to unify three systems, or is it the interpretation of Sh. Krishna Kashyap ("*I feel* that he has introduced very innovative ideas which *sort of* unify ..")?  
  
I know of one work which is an atttempt at showing Samanvaya of not only the three schools mentioned below (Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita) but also other Vedānta schools (Bhāskara's Bhedābheda, Nimbārka's Dvaitādvaita, Vallabha's Śuddhadvaita (Puṣṭimārga), and Acintyabhedābheda (of six Gosvāmins of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava school), and the five other schools of Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika and Mīmāṁsā. The essay is titled Ṣaḍdarśanasamanvaya, is in Hindi and runs into a good 50-60 pages. It is the introduction to the book पातञ्जलयोगप्रदीप (Gita Press 2007, ISBN [8129300117](tel:(812)%20930-0117)).
