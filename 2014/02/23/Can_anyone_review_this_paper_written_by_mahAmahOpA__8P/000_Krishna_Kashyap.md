This is my first post on this group.

I have worked with MahAmahOpAdhyAya KS Varadachar - Kothimangalam Varadacharya (or K.S Varadachar (KSV)) for the last 4-5 years. To my knowledge, after 75+ years of research on Vedanta and Darshanas, KSV has come up with some great insights. He is about 92 years old now.

However, I feel that his views are not understood or appreciated in the scholar community. I feel that he has introduced very innovative ideas which sort of unify the apparently divergent views of Tri-mathas of - Sri Shankaracharya, Sri Ramanujacharya and Sri Madhvacharya, which are probably fundamental views on vedanta. Other systems of Vedanta are sort of derivative from these basic ideas, since one is Bheda (Difference), other is Abheda- (Non-Difference), and the view of Sri Ramanujacharya is VisitAdvaita-Qualified Monism (which needs a lot of explanation, since it is not easily understood).

A group of people helped me in this translation of "SatyAnvEshana" paper written in Sanskrit to English. I have attached the english version. I can send the sanskrit original to anyone who wants it. I request people to read this paper and kindly write a review of it. It took us a couple of years to write this translation, since we wanted to write it only after properly understanding the different views and debating them to the extent of our knowledgewith its author KS Varadachar. K.S Varadachar lives in Mysore, Karnataka.

Thanks.

Krishna Kashyap
