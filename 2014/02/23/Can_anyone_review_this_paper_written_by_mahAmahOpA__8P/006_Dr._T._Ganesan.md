May be. But, it is not obligatory or logical to hold that a sadhaka has to pass through all these 3 or more states.  
Further, what is the highest realisation that one reaches after passing through these states ? For Sri Ramakrishna it is Maa Kaali and none else.  
As Sri Ramakrishna himself and many others including Svami Vivekananda hold, the non-duality (Advaita of the type propagated by Samkara ) is considered to be the highest one whereas the other views are the lower ones, like steps--सोपानक्रम , revealing a sort of condescending attitude to 'accommodate' the other views.  
But definitely the individual acharya-s (Ramanuja and Madhva) of the other systems do not hold such a view. According to each one of them the system propagated by him leads to the highest realisation.
