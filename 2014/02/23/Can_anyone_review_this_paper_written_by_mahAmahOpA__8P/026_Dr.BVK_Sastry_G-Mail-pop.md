1. On \< अन्यथैवोपपाद्यते -….. -**शुष्कतर्क **and the danger to **व्याकरणम्,** supremacy of आगम in terms of धर्माधर्मव्यवस्था…. \>
: 

Thank you for the very clear elaboration of what is meant by ‘Vedartha –Vyakhyana/ Vedanga Vyakarana’ to traditionalists.

You have brought out the no-compromise stand of tradition from Mahabhashya onwards \< आर्षे ग्रन्थे = महाभाष्ये \> as a continuing tradition under ‘Darshana Shastra –Dharma Shaastra’. 

To the list of \<Shuka Taarkikas> many orientalist’s and post 17^(th) century writers also can be added, who are called today’s leading ‘ interpreters and Global Researchers of Historic -Vedas’ !



2. On \< लोके** लोकायतीकृता** \> : 



Surely \< **बुध (without** **गुरुद्ष्टि) in** **मेषराशि causes** **नास्तिकत्वम्** \> can also be interpreted as \< A commercial Trader – Publishing scholar (Budha) , freed from the regulatory control of the Masters of Traditional disciplines (Guru) , will end up in ‘ Agnostic, nihilistic, destructive, historic interpretation of Vedas’ (**नास्तिकत्वम्** ), under the overall environment regulated by the \< Government : Sun as Uccha – in Mesha, exercising Power (Kuja) -
A total indication of Anti-Traditional values Governance> ! The so called ‘research writing can not be better expressed than Acharya Shankaras words \< निरागमाः पुरुषोत्प्रेक्षामात्रनिबन्धनाः तर्काः अप्रतिष्ठिता भवन्ति । उत्प्रेक्षायाः निरङ्कुशत्वात् । \> Surely there is no control on Utprekshaa= ‘ Madness of imagined interpretative constructions and possibilities with language grammar and text twisting in the name of ‘indology- linguistics’.
