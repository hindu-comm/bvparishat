Respected Scholars:

It may also help to read the article in kannada 'vivarta mattu pariNaamada tattva' by Acharya KSV in 'tattvadeepa:' - volume - XIII Jan-Dec 2007 issue. It is the journal of Academy of Sanskrit Research, Melkote publication.



In that article, Acharya has explained various usages of the term 'vivarta' and 'parinaama' - in Vaakyapadeeya, uttararaamacharitam, nyaayakaNika, sarvajnakavi etc.. and encourages scholars to think on the lines of the quotes, 'samasattaaka: anyathaabhaava: pariNaama:, viShamasattaaka: anyathaabhaava: vivarta:' etc.

Kindly note that I am just giving this info for people so that it may help andnot starting another argument. One could get some idea about Acharya's views from this articlealso.
