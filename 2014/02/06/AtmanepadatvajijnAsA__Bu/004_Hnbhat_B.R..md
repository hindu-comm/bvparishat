Rightly said. 

  

But the explanation शप उपालम्भने was waned there अकर्तृगेऽपि क्रियाफले was needed in that case, as the आत्मनेपद was already otherwise prescribed, when it is कर्तृगामिनि क्रियाफले. So this explanation was needed, even if it is कर्तृगामि or अकर्तृगामि क्रियाफलम्, आत्मनेफल is prescribed in the वार्तिक. And in this case, there is no other possibility, as it is open for शेषत् कर्तरि परस्मैपद, which doesn't need such an application applied here. In the other case, it is restricted by the meaning in any case. The restriction of meaning also need not be applied. Only whether it is कर्तृगामिनि क्रियाफले is the condidition for आत्मनेपद in the case of स्वरितेत् धातु-s. Hence I didn't see any need to apply all the conditions in this case, but only the condition should be either it should be अकर्मक, or if it is सकर्मक as in this case, it should be स्वाङ्गकर्मक. आ+हन् is सकर्मक, and only the condition to be met it should be स्वाङ्गकर्मक and obviously withot the explanations alredy offered, the rule cannot be applied. It is solved differently, with different अध्याहार-s.
