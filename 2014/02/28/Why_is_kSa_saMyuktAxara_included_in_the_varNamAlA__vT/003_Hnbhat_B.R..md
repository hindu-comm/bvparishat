Thanks Prof, Aklujkar for your observations.

  

  

**समाम्नायः समाम्नातः। स व्याख्यातव्यः। **

**तमिमं समाम्नायं ‘निघण्टव’ इत्याचक्षते। निघण्टवः कस्मात्।**

**निगमा इमे भवन्ति। छन्दोभ्यः समाहृत्य समाहृत्य**

**समाम्नाताः। ते निगन्तव एव सन्तो निगमनान्निघण्टव उच्यन्त**

**इत्यौपमन्यवः। अपि वा हननादेव स्युः। समाहता भवन्ति। यद्वा**

**समाहृता भवन्ति।**

**  
**

**As per the above explanation, समाम्नाय seems to be a collection of anything.**

**अक्षरसमाम्नायः, वर्णसमाम्नायः, निघण्टु a collection of words used in समाम्नाय = वेद-s, which are again, collections of Rig, Yajus, Sama, Atharva, also called संहिता-s.**

**  
**

**Honorarily, पाणिनीयव्याकरण is called वेदाङ्ग, and hence the collection of the अक्षर is also named as such or the reverse may be the case.**

**The above कोश listing मातृका-वर्ण-s and their meaning, includes in the list the अं and अः**

**as we do in the written catalogue of alphabets for Indian languages, following that of Sanskrit sounds.**

and gives assigns them meanings as shown above.

  

And at the end, also it includes क्ष with meanings assigned to it also after ह,

It includes one more in between ह, and क्ष, i.e. लुँ or one more in addition to ल in its order.

  

It seems it refers to बीजाक्षर-s used in Tantric tradition and the date is not certain, may be later than Panini or earlier than Panini. No date of compilation/copying or name of author is mentioned in the text. And it is compiled as a कोश, of मातृकावर्ण for the beginners बाल-s (of Tantric tradition or Sanskrit language in general?).

  

It includes the popular प्रणव, represented by ऊँ in the beginning also, which never finds place in वर्णसमाम्नाय of Panini, but may be some मातृकावर्ण list of some Tantric Tradition.

  

But other lexicon Medini include this as a word with the same meanings नानार्थ-s,

The above is fromA comprehensive grammar of the Sanskrit language; analytical, historical and lexicographical. By Anundoram Borooah, VOL.III Lexicographical collection

from different citations Lexicons in alphabetical order in Part I:

Calcutta, 1884

  

which includes मातृकावर्णकोश, and the which specifically says क्ष is अन्तिमाक्षरः. The line in the above snapshot also has to be read as अन्तिमाक्षरः as in the first snapshot of मातृकाकोश Printed and published in Sam.1929 in Kashi.

  

एकाक्षर-कोश of Purushottamadeva, includes "क्ष" as the final एकाक्षर after ह.

  

क्षः क्षेत्रे वक्षसि प्रोक्तो बुधैःक्षः शब्दशासने ।

क्षिः क्षेत्रे क्षत्ररक्षे च नृसिंहे च प्रकीर्तितः ॥३७

  

So it was included by Purushottamadeva's time itself among the अक्षर-s. and also the अनुस्वार and विसर्ग too like the मातृकावर्णकोश, as अं and अः.

  

अं स्याच्च परं ब्रह्म अः स्याच्चैव महेश्वरः ।

  

ओङ्कारोऽनन्त उच्यते ॥५॥ which probably ऊँ referred to in मातृकावर्ण.

  

Hope this helps to understand the position of later lexicographers for the inclusion of क्ष.
