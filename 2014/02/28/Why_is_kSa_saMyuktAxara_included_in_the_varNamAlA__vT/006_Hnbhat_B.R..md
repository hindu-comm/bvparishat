I am not familiar whether Aksharamala or Varnamala was existent at the time or prior to or poeterior to Panini and the century it came into existence historically. But I remember that apart from अक्षरमाला popular in text books in my childhood learning, it contained क्ष त्र ज्ञ.

  

But this stotra clearly mentions the form of Aksharamurti, of Gauri, includes आदि (अ-आदिः) and क्षान्त (अः आदिः, क्षः अन्तो यस्या सा सा, ताम्) अक्षरमूर्त्या विलसन्तीम्,

  

I take it the अक्षरमूर्ति including अ-क्ष, अक्षर-s, of the अक्षरमूर्ति, गौरी assumes and this excludes the two other letters, त्र and ज्ञ where the ज्ञ would be the last one and if क्ष is excluded, it would be हान्ताम्, (note in Panini's अक्षरसमाम्नाय, ह appears twice, हयवरट्, and in हल् ) while only ह is taken as part of alphabet in this scheme of अक्षरमाला, and it ends with क्ष as the last letter, as specified in मातृकावर्णकोश, अन्तिमाक्षरः.

  

This is a different scheme than that of Panini and one will have to look into Tantric system for the origin, than guessing about its origin either to scripting or devanagari writing.
