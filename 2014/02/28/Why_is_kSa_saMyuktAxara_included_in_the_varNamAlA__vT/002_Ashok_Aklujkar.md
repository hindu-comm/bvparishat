The inclusion of [k.sa](http://k.sa), tra,and j;na at the end of the [var.na](http://var.na) list or vya;njana list is inconsistent if a var.na-maalaa is meant to give only the distinctive sounds of Sanskrit. (The Indian tradition rightly maintained that the oral form of a language is its primary or real form; the written form is derivative and secondary, not always a true representation of what the language concerned actually is. ).  
  
Grammars like Paa.nini's which presuppose a Skt-knowing user and are not composed to be a textbook for teaching Skt would not (and do not) put these sounds in their sound catalogues. The point of view behind their sound catalogues is consistently that of phonology (adjusted to some extent to making the composition of rules efficient), but if the purpose of a grammar is pedagogical -- if the grammar is in fact a textbook concerned also with the writing side of what it describes -- then it may compromise theoretical consistency and, as matter of pedagogical expediency, include certain ligatures in its sound catalogue. Note that [k.sa](http://k.sa), tra,and j;na are not ligatures that could be intuitively broken into their constituents by beginning students -- need to be taught specifically -- and all of them are taught at the end of the sound catalogue received from theoretically consistent language accounts.  
  
When the introductions to Skt turned to inclusion, other systems of thought such as the Tantra, were affected. They could not have avoided the influence of what was taught in schools.  
  
The word var.na-maalaa, originally or primarily seems to have been used for the sound catalogue in writing. The name for the sound catalogue in sophisticated grammars such as Paa,nini's seems to have been ak.sara-samaamnaaya (although I have not had time to check if grammars such as Candra's use this name).
