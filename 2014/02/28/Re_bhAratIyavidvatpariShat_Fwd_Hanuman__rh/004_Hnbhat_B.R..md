Dear Subrahmanyan,

  

The purpose of quoting the above is not to either establish whether Hanuman is the incarnation of Vayu or Rudra, or both according to some Purana-s, but is cited to show that it was not Saturday as mentioned by another member in his post that Saturday is the birthday, but Tuesday according to this Agastyasamhita. The other member had not quoted any reference in support of his statement because Sindhura is annointed on Hanuman's body on Saturdya, his birthday.

  

If you have any other explanation for the the annointment of Sindhura on Saturday or any other reference to prove that Saturday is the birthday of Hanuman or any other day, it is welcome.

  

Why to start afresh whether Agastyasamhita is authoritative than Shankarabhashya or any other Vaishnava Pancaratra samhita-s? You can raise this question in another thread afresh so that it can be discussed independently. Or whether it is acceptable to Vaishnava-s or not is a different question and it doesn't contribute in any other way than that Hanuman's incarnation of Rudra is not acceptable to Vaishnava-s which can be a topic itself for another thread, if you can start it quoting from Ramayana, in support of your contention.

  

Sorry for interfering in the topic. It is just a remark to keep the thread compact and without deviation, to keep the decorum of the topic.
