Namaste.  

I do not know any reference in Ramayana but I read a story in Tattvaloka something reconstructed like this: Once Hanuman Ji asked Sita Maa of her regular habit of wearing Sindur on '*se*e*manta*'. On listening that SriRam Ji likes it very much for wearing Sindur, he felt very happy. Next day, Sita Maa saw Hanuman Ji full of Sindur smeared all over his body. When asked, he said, this body is meant for the service of Rama; If I can be a cause of happiness in any aspect to my master, I feel, I am equally elated. Hence, I smeared Sindur on my body. So, smearing Sindur is not to please Hanuman Ji, but his master.  
  

Why only on Saturday? That is because, He born on Saturday-the *dashamI* of *Vaisakha* month. Scholars are *pramanam* for any clarifications.
