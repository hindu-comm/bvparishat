//He was born on the full moon day (Purnima) of the month Chaitra on Tuesday. That is why, every year when Chaitra monthâ€™s full moon day arrives, his birth-day is ceremonised, which is called shri Hanuman Jayanti and Tuesday is considered very auspicious day to worship Hanumanji.//

  

Here, a number of days (tithi-s) are pointed out as Hanuman's jayanthi as observed in various parts/traditions of India, although they do not provide textual references for the same. In Bangalore itself
Hanumajjayanti is observed on different days by different temples, institutions, etc:
