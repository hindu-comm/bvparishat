The narrative of mother Sita presenting a garland to Hanuman is present in वाल्मीकिरामायण.  
  
The narrative of Hanuman tearing the garland and his heart to show the name of Rama comes from the Bengali कृत्तिवासरामायण.  

  

For details, please refer page 635 of Ramayana Mimamsa by Karapatra Swami (attached).
