Sri Nityanand,  
  

Thanks for letting us know more about Agastya Samhita. I read the article by Rev. Swamiji. The verses in NArada PurANa are really useful and informative besides establishing the importance of *purANas*. I noted the verse on *kalpabheda* too. The verse in UttarakaaNda can give clue at least on the *janma tithi* of Sri HanumAn Ji.  
  

Here we follow (probably entire South India) ParAshara SamhitA with regard to Hanuman Ji's worship etc. I could see a parallel to this. Amongst the commentaries on *dIdhiti*, a commentary on Gangesa's TattvachintAmaNi, scholars here follow GadAdhara. On the other hand, JagadIsha is followed in other parts of the country. Incidentally, both stalwarts hailed from Bengal*.*  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
