Prof. Prasad  
  
Thanks for the different sources and dates. No doubt different Purāṇas and Saṁhitās give different dates, and one way to see it is the Kalpabheda statement Ānandarāmāyaṇam verse 1.13.163 cited in the article I posted earlier.  
  
It may also be noted that Agastyasaṁhitā, which unequivocally states the Parabrahmatva of Śrīrāma and the Vedatva of Rāmāyaṇa, is one of the most revered texts in the Rāmānanda Sampradāya which worships Hanumān as part of the Śrīrāmapañcāyatana. The Rāmānanda Sampradāya is the largest Vaiṣṇava denomination in India and the world, and the Vaiṣṇavamatābjabhāskara by the founder of the Sampradāya, Śrīrāmānanda, gives the same date as Agastyasaṁhitā (Kārttika Kṛṣṇa Caturdaśī).  
  
Thanks, Nityanand
