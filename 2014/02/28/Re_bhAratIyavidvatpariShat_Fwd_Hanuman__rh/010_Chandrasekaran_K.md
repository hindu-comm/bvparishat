Respected Shri H N Bhat,

  

It is true, vadai malai is offered to Anjaneya in south. It is a popular form of worship.

  

Vada in Vadapalani refers to North and not to the vadai. Vadapalani in Chennai means north Palani in Tamil.

  

In Palani near Madurai (southern part of Tamilnadu) there is a famous and ancient temple for Lord Subramanya.

When a temple for Lord Subramanya was constructed in Madras (as Chennai was known in those days), the area around the temple became popular as North Palani or in other words Vada Palani, vada (வட) stands for north in Tamil.

  

Best Regards

  

Chandrasekaran
