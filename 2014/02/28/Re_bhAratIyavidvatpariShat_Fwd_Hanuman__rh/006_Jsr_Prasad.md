Namaamsi.  
  
1. Traditionally and conventionally, devotees of Hanuman revere a text called 'Parashara Samhita' than Agastya Samhita (perhaps, most of us must be aware of it). It is a dialog between sage Parashara and Maitreya. With regard to Hanuman Ji's birth, 36th verse of 6th Patala reads thus -  
  
*वैशाखे* मासि कृष्णायां दशमी *मंद*संयुता ।  
पूर्वप्रोष्ठवदायुक्ता कथा वैधृतिसंयुता ।।  
तस्यां मध्याह्नवेलायां जनयामास वै सुतम् । (more from the attached image)  
  
The [book](https://archive.org/details/SriParasaraSamhitaHanumaCharitramVol1) that contains above reference, has forwards from M.M. Maddulapalli Manikya Shastry, M.M. Pullela Sriramachandrudu and other erudite scholars. Hence, considering them to be आप्तs, personally I go with what I posted earlier.  
  
2.There are many versions of DoBs as per the following post:  

*Puranas differ on arriving at the birthday of Sri Hanuman. They mention CHAITRA BAHULA CHATURDASI, CHAITRA SUDDHA EKADASI, VAISKHA BAHULA DASAMI or MARGASIRA BAHULA DASAMI as per different Puranas. While some say it is a Saturday, others feel that the day was either a Tuesday or a Wednesday. VAISAKHA BAHULA DASAMI is recognized as the birthday of Sri Hanuman. VAISAKHA BAHULA DASAMI occurs in May. MARGASIRA SUDDHA TRAYODASI is observed as HANUMADVRATAM. It occurs in December. Some people observe the day as the birthday of Sri Hanuman.*

*A hymn in RIGVEDA proclaims: ----------. It indicates that the day on which the birth of the star of a god occurs has to be reckoned as the birthday of the god. Sri Hanuman’s birth star is PURVABHADRA. But his “Adhisthana” star is Swathi. The birth of the star of Sri Hanuman occurs on VAISHAKHA BAHULA DASAMI and the day has to be observed as his birthday* (source: <http://jayahanuman.org/jayahanuman/history.htm>).  
  

Skanda Purana has a different version it seems. Nonetheless, views at point number 2 are not mine.  

  

3\. About anointing Sindhura (apologies, I misspelt it in previous reply) on Saturday, I must have written it in haste. It is not only on Saturday, but on all days, his *moorti* is anointed with Sindhura, in some temples of Hyderabad. I remind, I just have quoted a story from a popular magazine.
