And stories make popular such traditions with relation to some Purana-s as Jsr Prasad has cited in his latest message. Skandha Purana is the common source for Such SthalapuraNa-s, which may not be found in all the versions.

  

In Tamilnadu, Vadai is offered as garland. SOME may come up with a story that Vada was offered as garland for him by his master, or Sita devi, which pleased him too much. There is such a story Sita Ma offered him a necklace and he tore out and opened his heart that both SITA and Rama were always present in his heart and he is not in need of a pearl bead necklace to memorize them.

  

So Vati - Vadai (a fried food) is popularly offered, by which the place is known popular as vadapalani.

  

Such may be the story published in the magazine.
