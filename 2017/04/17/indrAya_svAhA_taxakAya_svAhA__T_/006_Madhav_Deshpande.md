Thoughइन्द्राय स्वाहा तक्षकाय स्वाहा is a popularly known expression connected with the Janamejaya's Sarpayajña, and it was popularly used in Marathi writings by Lokmanya Tilak and Savarkar to advocate a fight against both the British rulers and their Indian supporters, this is not a grammatically accurate expression. "इन्द्राय स्वाहा" in grammatical Sanskrit would mean "Here is an offering to Indra", and similarly "तक्षकाय स्वाहा" would mean "Here is an offering to Takṣaka". These expressions cannot grammatically mean that Indra and Takṣaka are the substances of Āhutis that are falling into the sacrificial fire. That is what the story requires, and so, it is no wonder that the Bhāgavata Śloka saysतक्षकाशु पतस्वेह सहेन्द्रेण..., and notइन्द्राय स्वाहा तक्षकाय स्वाहा. Popularly known and used Sanskrit quotes are not always grammatically appropriate and are often based on misunderstood Sanskrit syntax.
