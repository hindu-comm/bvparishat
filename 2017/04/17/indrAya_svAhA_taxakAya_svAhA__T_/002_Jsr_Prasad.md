Thanks to Prof. Sundareswaran ji for this quick reference! Sri Akshy Naik's first question is answered here. With regard to his second question, indeed, it is not a mantra but rather a sloka as seen in 'तक्षकाशु पतस्वेह सहेन्द्रेण...' etc. One may not know what exactly the expression/mantra used by the Hotaa, as the same has been embedded in a chandas here by Vyasa bhagavan.  
  

Furthermore, Hotaa belongs to Rgveda. Was it Hotaa that uttered these words?  

Thanks for raising this question.  
  

Regards
