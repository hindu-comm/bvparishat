I had heard of  

***sendrāya takṣakāya svāhā***  

which too is grammatically vitiated.  
  

Other examples of wrongly constructed but popular epigrams are:  

1\. ***nārado kalahapriyaḥ*** (sandhi violated)  

2\. ***udyogam puruṣa-lakṣaṇam*** (gender violated)  

3\. ***vivāho vidya-nāśāya*** (compound ill-formed).  
  

There must be many more!
