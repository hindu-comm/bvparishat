Dear scholars,

  

I have heard and have seen it mentioned on various web pages that during sarpa satra of Janamejaya, when Takshak took refuge with Indra, the Hotri uttered इन्द्राय स्वाहा तक्षकाय स्वाहा.

  

However, I did not find such a reference in the Mahabharata. Adi Parva 56.11-13 says only that when Janamejaya commanded that Takshak be cast into the fire with Indra himself, the Hotri poured libations naming Takshak staying with Indra and then both of them appeared in the sky. No mantra is actually given.

  

So could someone please help me in answering the following queries:

  

\(1\) Is there are any reference elsewhere in the itihasa-puranas to the mantra इन्द्राय स्वाहा तक्षकाय स्वाहा?

\(2\) Even if there isn't, is such a mantra technically correct i.e. would a Hotri say this if he wanted to give the ahuti of Indra and Takshak?

  

Thanks in advance.
