In the same story of Uttanka, in the portion preceding the sarpayaaga part, while narrating the Takshaka's stealing of kunDala's and Uttanka's response, Veda Vyasa says,

  

'astuvadebhih s'lokaih' is to be noted.

  

At the end of the stotras, Vyasa says,

  

एवं स्तुवन्नपि नागान्यदा ते कुण्डले नालभदथापश्यत्स्त्रियौ तन्त्रे अधिरोप्य पटं वयन्त्यौ \| १४७ \|

  

stuvannapi .... naalabhat is one thing. But why did he See the weaving women etc. What did he do to be able to vision such a symbolic visual? (Symbolism is explained by his upaadhyaaya later)

  

The only convincing explanation seems to be that that was the supernatural consequence of his 'stutayah'.

  

So what was outwardly a stuti to the naagas was in fact an invocation to the powers that could control the naagas.

  

The purusha in the visual , Parjanya makes Uttanka employ the horse, Agni to control the naagas.

  

Stutis bind, control.

  

The secret behind this mechanism not known even to Uttanka, at the time of prayoga. His upaadhyaaya reveals that secret to him later. Then says, this is the last lesson of your course, you may now leave the school.

  

Can this be applied to svaahaa being used for binding /controling, if this line has some authentic source?
