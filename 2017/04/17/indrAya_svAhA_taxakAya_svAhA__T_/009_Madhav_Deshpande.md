One of the funny Sanskrit usages in a verse popular among the Maṅgalāṣṭakas describing the Aṣṭa-vināyakas in Maharashtra says: ग्रामे रांजणसंस्थितो गणपति: कुर्यात् सदा मङ्गलम्". This is supposed to refer to the Gaṇapati temple in Ranjangaon. But the line as stated says: Gaṇapati, in the village, situated in Rāñjaṇa (in Marathi this refers to a big clay jar).
