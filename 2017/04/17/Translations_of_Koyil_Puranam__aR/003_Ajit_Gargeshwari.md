Requesting you to please share your experience. To collect these Manuscripts one consults NCC. Then the next step would be to approach the respective depositories.The depositories will give photocopies of the manuscripts and then one edits and prints is this the correct process. Does this sound rather too easy. How approachable are the depositories that hold these manuscripts?
