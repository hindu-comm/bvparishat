You are very correct Sir,  

But how long we will be waiting for this? why there can not be an approach from the learned group to get the manuscripts. How long the authorities of the respective libraries would be thinking that the mss., of their personal property? Sir, just do some thing through the NMM. The repositories are for the scholars.  

For your information I am to say there are many sthala puranas found in single copy. I will prepare a list and post in the group.  

with regards  

Mamata
