Dear Nityanand-ji

  

Isn't Koil Purana a version of Chidambaram Mahatmayam? There is a book from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and of course several translations in [archive.org](http://archive.org) - I only found one book in Hindi called 'Chidambara' by Sumitra Nandan Pant. Hope that helps.

  

Best

  

Dev
