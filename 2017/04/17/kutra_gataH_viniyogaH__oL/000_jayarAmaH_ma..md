Namaste  

  

The following is a snapshot from Sayanbhashya of Rgveda Nasadiya sukta (10.129) -

The last sentence says गतो विनियोगः।  
My question - कुत्र गतः विनियोगः?.  
  
I understand the intention of the commentator that the Viniyoga of this sukta has already been stated. But where to find the Viniyoga of this sukta? It should be somewhere in the previous portion.This is the 11th anuvaka of the 10th Mandala. I searched the previous portion and I could not locate. I should have missed it. Help in this regard is solicited.  
  

  

regards  

Jayaraman
