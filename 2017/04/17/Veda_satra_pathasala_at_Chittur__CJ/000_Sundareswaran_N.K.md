Dear friends,

I have written a note on Chittur Vedapatha sala. It contains an elegy (short one) in Sanskrit written (by Ammangudi Paramesvara sastrigal) in the year 1926. The subject of the elegy is Sri Krishna Iyer, the founder manager of the वेदपाठशाला at Chittur, Palakkad, Kerala. This reputed institution (last decades of 19th century and early decades of 20th century) produced many Vedic and Satric scholars like महामहोपाध्याय अनन्तकृष्णशास्त्री.
