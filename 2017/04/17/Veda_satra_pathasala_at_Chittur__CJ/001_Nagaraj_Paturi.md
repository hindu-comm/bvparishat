What a great piece of fact of modern history of Sanskrit or history of modernity of Sanskrit !

  

Elegy is currently called smriti kavita in Telugu.

  

I have been proposing the name santaapa kavita, keeping in mind that condolence meetings are called santaapa sabha in Telugu.

  

But the word anutaapa is even more appropriate. Elegy can be called anutaapa kavitaa.
