Dear Sir

  

From the perspective of modern linguistics, I think that syllable may be translated asशब्दोच्चारणखण्ड . अक्षर was appropriate earlier, but it has acquired the connotation of orthographic-syllable now.

  

One can artificially construct a non-sense or meaningless word (अर्थशून्य-शब्द) which follows the phonological rules of the language.
Such a word too has to have at least one उच्चारणखण्ड . I have also been thinking about an appropriate translation for syllable in Hindi for some time. Is there any Indian language in whichवर्णमाला is called अक्षरमाला ? That may give some clue.

  

Thanks and regards

Dhirendra Kumar
