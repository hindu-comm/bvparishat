The Varnavada of Mimamsa (Purva and Uttara) says that the Nityasabda is Varna (varnajaati) not that Varnas are meaningful units. They take pratyayas and shatus as meaningful units. Sri Joshi's theory is that each Varna is meaningful.

  

To add to the confusion, for Bhartriahri Varna means pratyaya, at least on one occasion.
