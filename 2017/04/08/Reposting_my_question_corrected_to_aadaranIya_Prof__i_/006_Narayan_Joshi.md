AadaranIya Prof Korada, Saadar PraNAma

Many thanks for explanation on VarNa and Aks'ra.

Here is the answer to your question--Source of VarNavada.

What is the source of the word “Varņavāda”

1.  Book: “The Linguistic speculations of The Hindus” by
    PrabhatchandraChakravarti, University of Calcutta 1933. On page
    35,

Sankara finds, however, the varņavāda, as expounded by Upavarsa more reasonable than the sphotavāda-----

1.  Book: Contribution of Vācaspati Mishra to Indian Philosophy” by S.
    Ranganatha, Pratibha Prakashan, Delhi 1999.

 In this book from pages 88 to 95 there is discussion on varņavāda. The word varņavāda is used several times.

1.  Book: Trends of Linguistic Analysis in Indian Philosophy, by Hari
    Mohan Jha, Chaukhamba Orientalia, Delhi, 1981, p.23 On this page
    there is reference to varņavādins.

I can find more references from my home library.

Varņavāda is not my invention. The new varņavāda is my invention where elemental meanings are connectedto the 36 consonants and 15-16 vowels based on their positions in the varņamālā table (periodic table of varņas). Thanks again. NRJOSHI
