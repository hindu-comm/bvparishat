AadaraNIya Prof Korada, SAdar PraNAm !

Please ignore my previous posting. I am sorry for typographic errors in it.

I am sending this posting with typographic errors corrected.

Prof S Korada is Kalpavriksha. I ask one question, he offers me wealth of information enriched many times.

I have no problem with the word GuNa having different meanings in different contexts referring to many example cited by you in your posting.

Please pardon me for asking the following questions.

Now my questions. The word VarNa is used by different scholars with different meanings such as Letter sound, phoneme or Syllable. In one of your posting you mentioned it is Aks’ara. In my postings I took VarNa as a phoneme (for convenience of writing in English).

By the VarNa I mean /k/ and not “ka” .

In your book mentioned many Aachaaryas support VarNavAda.

Question-What exactly these Aachaaryas had in their mind when they used the term “VarNavAda” Were they referring to Aksharas or to Svaras or to Vyanjanas?

Question: what is the Sanskrit term for a syllable? Is it VarNa or Aks'ara or something else?

Question- One cannot have meanings to the VarNas because it then gets PrAtipadikatvam with grammatical attachment of Sup and Tin.

I read that “ka” is Devataa. “ka” is prajApati. ‘Ka” is Vaayudevataa. (References not handy, pardon me) Many ancient Etymologists (Shaakataayana, Yaaska) attached meanings to syllables or to a single letter. They might have used them as Upaaya (as you used meanings for Gu and Ru”). Many such examples are available from the ancient BrahmaNa granthas. I think there is no Praatipadikatvam to these syllables used as Upaaya. I may be corrected.

Waiting to receive wealth of knowledge from you so that I remove my misunderstandings and grow in knowledge with you. Thanks. NRJOSHI
