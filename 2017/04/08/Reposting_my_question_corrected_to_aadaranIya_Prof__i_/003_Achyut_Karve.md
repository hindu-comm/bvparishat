Sanskrit is not a language of words but of padas (पद). Meaning one idea is spoken in continuum without word breaks. पर: संनिकर्ष: संहिता. It being spoken today as an assemblage of discrete words is on account of a change in its phonetic structure which was the reason why Panini saw reason to systematically codify it. Panini was also criticised in his days and many disagreed with him. In order to ward off criticism against Panini Katyayana and thereafter Patanjali wrote treatises in the form of varytiks and Mahabhashya. The Maaheshwar Sutras which are themselves called by many names is the list of Aksharas not syllables.
Varana is a class. The Aksharas in usage undergo change. The word Varna subsumes all those changes of the Akshara.
