\>The question I have is the categorization of possible body movementsin order to map the internal moods in body poses.

  

  

----- This is one of the main focuses of Natya Shaastra and the post-Natya Shaastra books such as Nrittaratnavali, Vasantaraajeeyam, Abhinayadarpanam etc.

  

\>Lately there isresearch on face recognition to check emotion (crime, terrorism).

  

----- But one of the key notions of the entire S'aastra of Naatya is the distinction between Loka Dharmi and Naatya Dharmi. The day to day, real life expressions and their form is called Loka Dharmi and the form in which the same content /emotions are communicated in Naatya is called Naatya Dharmi.

  

Naatya Dharmi has 'idealized' , 'purified', (stylized) expressions unlike Lokadharmi in which expressions are real in contrast to ideal for the reason of they being more complex mixtures as a result of real life complex constraints. You might want to remember how an Indian classical dancer enacts putting bindi on her forehead (Natya Dharmi) and how an Indian woman in her real life puts her bindi.

  

\>There could be semantic analysis.

  

The analysis of meaning communication through means including but not limited to linguistic ones, such as colors, gestures, positions, postures, configurations, pictures, designs , sounds, music instrumental, vocal etc. is called semiotics not semantics.
