Dear friends,  

Happy Sankranti.  

I am reading Bharata's Nāṭyaśāstra for preparing a lecture.  

I had heard about the karaṇa and aṅgahāra in the dance poses.  

But the elaborate description puzzles me. It gives an impression that  

dance as a social custom was a part of the social fabric already.  

like Panini's bhāṣā. Would any one give me some reference how  

to trace the origin of the karaṇa and aṅgahāra. I think the book  

will use more technical terms as I go forward.  

Thank you for your help.
