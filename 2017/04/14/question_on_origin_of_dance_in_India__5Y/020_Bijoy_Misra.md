My view has been that it is the nataydharma is not some theoretical work  
but is derived from the popular culture. We do that all the time in the sciences.  

The nature has its play, we create parameters to understand it.  

My question is what led to a parametric analysis of dance.. Various descriptive  
material could only be extensions, but not science. Bu then then whether the  
set of karaNas is a complete set or not can be mathematically analyzed.  

There must a context somewhere. New experiments can be done.  

The terminology and the process of presentation is another thread.
