Would you think that these could be in a pure stage production  

and written down later? We have heard of oral literature.  
Could the retention of oral literature be through the dramatic production?  
In such case Bharata's science in connecting moods to body postures  
might have been a platform to experiment. Possibly a code book could have  

developed much before Bharata compiled the NS.  

The NS talks about the समुद्रमन्थन as the theme of production and goes  
into शिव and ताण्डव.
