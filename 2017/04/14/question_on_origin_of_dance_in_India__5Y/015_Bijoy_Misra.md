Dear Prof Korada,  

First, our humble respects for your immense repository of knowledge  

and the generous distribution of it. You are indeed an exemplar.  

The question I have is the categorization of possible body movements  

in order to map the internal moods in body poses. Lately there is  

research on face recognition to check emotion (crime, terrorism).  

What Bharata is suggesting is a parametric analysis of the possible  

body positions and their association with the emotion. What I believe,  

it must be descriptive rather than prescriptive (hence I mentioned Panini).  

The early use of the word करण could give a clue. I know it is used in early  
Astronomy and time measurement. Could it then mean sky configuration?  

I have not studied.  

रेचक is interesting, just four. It is dynamic motion of the body part:  

neck. hands, waist and legs. Some anatomical knowledge is in use.  

We need when it came in use. There could be semantic analysis.  

Best regards,  

BM
