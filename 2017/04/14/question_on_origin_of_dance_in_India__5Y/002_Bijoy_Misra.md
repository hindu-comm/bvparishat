Thank you, I will. I also would need any textual reference on dance from the later  

vedic texts or the Mahabharata. From the book (नाट्यशास्त्र) I infer that by the time  

of compilation, the dance/drama production had an elaborate pageantry with huge  

opulence in display in construction, costumes and professional labor.
It goes to  

a point where the writer (Bharata) declares that "undesirable"
पाषण्ड्याः like  
श्रमिणः or कषायवसनाः sent away (by the organizer) प्रणुदितैः (NS II.37.38)  
  

I would think a social event had transformed to be a lavish consumption of wine  

and food to the point when the "undesirables" would object. The numbers gods  

(as a convenience) allowed for the breadth of food, style and splendor.  
  

But then the next chapter goes into the science of the body and mind.
It  

is brilliant, empirical and detailed. I would like to know if anyone has examined  
the completeness: meaning if the fortynine भाव make a complete set expressible  
with the one hundred and eight करण and four रेचक  

  

Any thoughts? Clues?
