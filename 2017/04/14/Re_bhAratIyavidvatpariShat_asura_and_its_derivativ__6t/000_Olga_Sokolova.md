Hello dear Mr. Subrahmanian.v ,

Can you please elaborate about Brahmarishi Mayan? I asked about him but nobody replied. Why is it said he was asura in Surya Siddhanta? It bothers me because I practice Vaastu Shastra (my Guru was late Padma Bhushan V. Ganapati Sthapati from Chennai). He taughtme that Mayan was incredible genius, builder and Divine being. Word "Asura" confuses me as I understand it has a negative meaning. I am not a linguist. I am simply a civil engineer.

I would really appreciate your answer.

  

Best wishes!

Olga Mandodari (my Guru gave me this name)
