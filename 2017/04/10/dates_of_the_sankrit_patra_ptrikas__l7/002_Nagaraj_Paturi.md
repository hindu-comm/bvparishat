There was a thread here:

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskrita/piDstZ_CJHo>  

  

From all such sources, online links and addresses of all these periodicals can be collected.

  

Contacting them through such contact info is the only way to gather.

  

There doesn't seem to be any one place /source which gathered all the dates of first issues of Sanskrit periodicals.
