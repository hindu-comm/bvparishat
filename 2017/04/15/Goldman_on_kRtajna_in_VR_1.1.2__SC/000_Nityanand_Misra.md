Dear list

  

[Robert Goldman](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=kD84WlAtggkC&pg=PA121) translates*dharmajñaśca kṛtajñaśca* in VR 1.1.2 as  

  

“knows both what is right and how to act upon it”  

  

I am at a loss as how can*kṛtajña*translate as “one who knows how to act upon it (what is right)”.

  

Both Ralph Griffith and Hari Prasad Shastri use the word grateful, which conveys the sense in which*kṛtajña*is primarily used in Sanskrit (and Hindi too): कृतं कृतोपकारं जानाति. As per the Vachaspatyam, कृतज्ञ is used in the senses कृतोपकारज्ञातरि, तत्प्रत्युपकारके, कुक्कुरे, and परमेश्वरे. The three famous commentaries Bhushana, Tilaka, and Shiromani all take the first sense (कृतोपकारज्ञातरि). So what could be the basis of Goldman's translation?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
