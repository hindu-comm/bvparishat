Here is the Pali passage with the akataññū person being an Uttamapurisa/Uttamaporisa:

  

*assaddho akataññū ca sandhicchedo ca yo naro /  
Hatāvakāso vantāso sa ve uttamaporiso //*  

  
*assaddho akataññū ca*, Who is without blind faith, but knows the uncreated (nibbāna),  
*sandhicchedo ca yo naro*, Who has cut out the bonds,   
*hatāvakāso vantāso*, Who destroyed all causes (for karma) and removed all desires,  
*sa ve uttamaporiso*,One truly is the most greatest of men.
