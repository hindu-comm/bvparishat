Yes, your suspicion might be true in that case. Madhava Yogis interprets - 'श्रौतस्मार्तसकलधर्मरहस्यज्ञश्च' for धर्मज्ञ । Govindaraja clarifies the significance of 'च'kaara in the expression धर्मज्ञश्च - *'चकारोऽनुक्तसमुच्चयार्थः । परिहार्याधर्मज्ञश्चेत्यर्थः' ।* May I humbly remind the MBh verse with regard to this - धर्मे च अर्थे च कामे च मोक्षे च... (धर्मे-अधर्मे च, अर्थे-अनर्थे च, कामे-अकामे च, मोक्षे-अमोक्षे च etc.). Even then, Goldman's translation is hard to connect anywhere approximate to the word. If you relax the condition of word analysis by giving a loose end to it, then Goldman's "knows both what is right and how to act upon it" may be applicable to the Govindaraja's interpretation. But still, what happens to the next adjectival word - कृतज्ञ ? I am subject to correction here.  
  
Alf Hiltebeitel seems to be a sensible author. I already had a hunch on its implications, as he rightly said over there.
