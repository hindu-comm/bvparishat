It's great experience shared, Prof. Bijoy ji. Possibly, the word 'पुङ्गव' has been translated so, through out the English text. The kind of philology that they do is to enrich the so called PIE theory that would strengthen another fabricated theory - AIT. When they denounce poetic metaphors, what would be the plight of ध्वनि, श्लेष, काकु kind of aesthetic concepts in 'translation'? When Valmiki states - विमदानुत्थितान् सर्वान् मेहमानान् मधूदकम् ।। (5.64.4) should it read as '(in madhuvana) all the monkey warriors are inflicted with Diabetes Mellitus as evident from the passage of urine?'
