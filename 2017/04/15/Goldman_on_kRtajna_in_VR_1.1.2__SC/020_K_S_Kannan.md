*Jñāna* and *kriyā* supplement and complement each other.

Well has it been said:

  

***hataṁ jñānaṁ kriyā-hīnaṁ,***

***   hatā cājñāninaḥ kriyā /***

***apaśyann andhako naṣṭaḥ,***

***   paśyann api ca paṅgukaḥ ! //***

  

Further*, jānāti* (of a positive nature) is normally followed by *icchati (yatate),* and *karoti*.

  

These should elucidate the nature of a ***dharma-jña**.*
