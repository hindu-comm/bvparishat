Dear Nityanandji,  
  

I had some discussion with the some of the members of the team when I first happened to read it.  

I was turned off at the first line "Narada, bull among sages". When i pointed out the absurdity of  

such expression, i was told that it is done for "philology". Then I learned that the philology that  

they develop has little to do with etymology or the word origin. The basis of tackling poetic metaphors  

with phonetic dissection takes the translation away from the poet.  
  

The trouble is that the Indian language style is strongly metaphorical, much of which are through local  

legends or through long period of transformation of words. This would not be appreciated by some one  

unless the person is a language speaker or has deep appreciation of poetry and the metaphors. I do not  

know the intent and the labor that might have gone to create the old dictionaries. The translator,  

ignorant of the use of a word, depends on the dictionary and picks up a phrase that he or she thinks  

could be appropriate. A unit of poetry is a stanza or a sentence. They assume that the stanza is  

a convenience, than a creative construction. The translation gets stranger as the Valmiki sentences  

would compound in creating stronger imagery. There it would appear as pure destruction in conversion.  
  

I can say pages, but I stop here. To me, such work though possibly well-intended, have to be rejected  

by language speakers. Possibly they had a different audience in mind.
Such cultural and language  

misrepresentation also continues in other works that our children read.
It is a massive problem of  

imposition. India has to discover herself and find a way forward in many ways.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
