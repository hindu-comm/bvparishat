I do not know what the thought was. I wrote what I was given to understand  
by somebody who participated in the project. He said that a "group" of  
Assistants determined the translation and some such strange things. I must  

say many western scholars reject the translation also.  

I wanted to buy the book to give as a gift to my granddaughter. Then I confronted  
the phrase "bull among the sages". A person who would not know, can easily  
think of "snake among the sages", "insect among the sages," or any word  
replacing "bull". For a young kid, the education would be that in old India,  
humans were compared to animals or some object. The youth in India  
unfamiliar with Sanskrit or local language, might be reading these nonsense.  
That मुनिपुङ्गव is a word suggesting a मुनि, as capable as a पुङ्गव  

(this also reads crude), or more conceptually unitary nature, singular among  
the flock etc is the intent. Apparently philology demands a "literary" translation,  

The phrase "literary" is defined by "scholars" who may not live the language  

or have any respect to the poetry or the culture.  

I thought his "bull" was a caricature of Valmiki. My father, who was a poet,  

had hinted such use to me in the '50s. But I encountered it only because  

of a personal need. The "bull" is persistent in the book. There are plenty  
other "bull"-like features in every page. I left after three pages.
