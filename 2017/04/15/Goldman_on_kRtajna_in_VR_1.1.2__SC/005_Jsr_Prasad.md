I really appreciate your further investigation on the MBh reference given by M-W from Böhtlingk, as both are proved to be erroneous. I've enclosed the popular Sanskrit translations on धर्मज्ञ and कृतज्ञ । In Srimad Bhagavatam, कृतज्ञ word appears twice – at 10.48.26 & 11.29.38, purely in the sense of 'grateful.' Translating in Goldman's lines, the सुकृत and दुष्कृत words would end up in a greater laughter. I fully agree and other scholars might have a lot to say about your last comment.
