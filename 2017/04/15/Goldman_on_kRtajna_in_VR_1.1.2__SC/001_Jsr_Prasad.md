Dear Nityananda ji,  
  

He has put in considerable efforts in understanding and translating the epic.  
But, there could be two reasons for that sort of translation:  
  

1\. incomprehensibility of Sanskrit word meanings and  

2\. deliberate misrepresentation  
  

Monier Williams translates the word as follows:  
  
- कृतज्ञ mf (आ)n. knowing what is right, correct in conduct MBh. xii, 104, 6  
  
- कृतज्ञ/ कृत--ज्ञ mf (आ)n.acknowledging past services or benefits, mindful of former aid or favors, grateful Mn. Ya1jn5. etc.  
  

Presumably, Robert Goldman has considered the former meaning only.  

  
I just glanced the translation and wonder, how he could have translated the word 'Hanuman.' In the link that you forwarded, many translations need our attention, for instance, 'yojana' = league etc.  

  
There is a good amount of material available for debate. A mere glance of the translation reveals so much so that Goldman fairly confuses the reader a lot, while heavily referring to Ramopakhyana, Pali Jatakakatha, Jacobi, Van Buitenen, and others with regard to Ramayana's antiquity, furthermore comparing Valmiki with Homer.  
  

The translator seemingly endorses that Hanuman is a fictitious character? Throughout his translation, the very word has been translated as 'monkey.' Is this a Darwinian influence, using the western lens?  
  

Goldman's clearly sets his difference of opinion, on occasions like that of 'ऋक्षवानरगोपुच्छैः..,' (apes, monkeys and langurs) in Kishkindha kanda, with all Sanskrit commentators.  
  

I think, you opened up a Pandora's box, kindly offered to us by Goldmans, with your nice observations for the attention of scholars.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
