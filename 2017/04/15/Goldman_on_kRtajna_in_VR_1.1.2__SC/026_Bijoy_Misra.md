I would say *kataññū* in th*is context *could mean *"one *who knows the path (to the ultimate)"  

"path" can mean that "one who has done the necessary austerities to know (the ultimate)"  

There is a key difference. I think the essence is in "knowing through doing". In the  

religious world, there is one thing to know (i would leave it as "ultimate")  

What is the reference to the Pali text?
