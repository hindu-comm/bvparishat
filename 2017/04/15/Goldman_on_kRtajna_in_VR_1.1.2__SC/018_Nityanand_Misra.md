Completely agree with Prof. Paturi Ji.*dharmajña* is one who not only knows what is right, but also how to act on it.

  

सत्यं ब्रूयात्प्रियं ब्रूयान्न ब्रूयात्सत्यमप्रियम्। प्रियं च नानृतं ब्रूयादेष धर्मः सनातनः॥ मनुस्मृतौ ४.१३८ ॥

  

So dharma includes action (in this case speaking the truth, speaking what is pleasant, not speaking an unpleasant truth, and not speaking a pleasant lie).
