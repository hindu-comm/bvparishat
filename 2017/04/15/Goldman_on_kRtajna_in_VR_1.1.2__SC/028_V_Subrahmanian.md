The above resembles the BG 15th chapter verse:

  

यस्मात्क्षरमतीतोऽहमक्षरादपिचोत्तमः।  

अतोऽस्मिलोकेवेदेचप्रथितःपुरुषोत्तमः॥ १८ ॥

  

  

There kshara and akshara mean 'manifest world' and 'unmanifest, māyā'. The Supreme Brahman is beyond both.

  

The subsequent verses state the phala of the above knowledge:

  

योमामेवमसंमूढोजानातिपुरुषोत्तमम्।  

ससर्वविद्भजतिमांसर्वभावेनभारत॥ १९ ॥
