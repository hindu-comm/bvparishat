To add to the discussion of kṛtajña and akṛtajña, these terms have been used in the Pali Buddhist literature in meanings not familiar in the Sanskrit literature. The Pali words kataññu (Skt. kṛtajña) and akataññu (Skt. akṛtajña) are sometimes used in the sense of "grateful" and "ungrateful". But occasionally they are also used in the sense of "one who knows the created" and "one who knows the uncreated", the "uncreated" referring to Nirvāṇa. See the attached passage from the Dhammapada.

I am not suggesting that kṛtajña in the Ramayana passage has this meaning, but just that sometimes words can have contextually very different unfamiliar meanings. With this distinctly different meaning of akataññū "knower of the uncreated (nirvāṇa)", there is a Pali passage which says that the akataññū is the Uttamapurisa (Skt. Uttamapuruṣa).
