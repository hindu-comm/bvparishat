Not just insensitive, it shows Goldman did not pay heed to the fact that अमरकोष clearly says that पुंगव in उत्तरपद means श्रेष्ठ.

  

स्युरुत्तरपदे व्याघ्रपुंगवर्षभकुञ्जराः।

सिंहशार्दूलनागाद्याः पुंसि श्रेष्ठार्थगोचराः॥ ३.१.४९ ॥



So मुनिपुंगव = मुनिव्याघ्र = मुनिसिंह = मुनिकुञ्जर = मुनिनाग and all of them simply mean मुनिश्रेष्ठ (best among sages).
