I'd like to bring your attention to the following passage from Goldman's introduction:  
  

//Synonimity is not, however, the only problem to confront the translator. Just as many different words may have the same meaning in Sanskrit, so, may a single word have a bewildering variety of meanings. Some of traditional India's most highly charged terms, words such as dharma, karma, tapas, and so on, have wide ranges of meaning, and it is, as the pandits say, possible to determine the terms do not exhibit this polysemic character, a one-to-one translation is both possible and desirable. Thus, we have rendered every occurrence of the term '*ṛṣi*' with the English word "seer" and each appearance of the partially overlapping term '*muni*' as "sage," in order to reflect the distribution of these two common terms. The important term 'dharma,' however, has a number of related but quite different meanings. When it is used generally, as in compounds and derivatives like '*dharmajña*' and '*dhārmika*,' "knowing dharma" and "*dharmic*," we have translated it, depending on the English context, as "righteousness," "what is right," and so on.   
  

One of our fundamental decisions concerning this translation of the rāmāyaṇa was that it should contain a minimum of untranslated words. To avoid providing an appropriate English equivalent for terms such as dharma is to abdicate the translator's responsibility.*//
