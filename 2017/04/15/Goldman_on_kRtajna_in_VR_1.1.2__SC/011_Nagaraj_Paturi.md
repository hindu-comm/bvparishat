In the case of*kṛtajña* and all such cases where he takes a different meaning than the one taken by the traditional commentators, doesn't he have the responsibility to explain /justify that decision to take a different meaning, at least in a footnote or something like that?

  

One such reason /justification, for example, should be that the meaning taken by traditional commentators or translators earlier to him does not suit the context, i.e., Rama is not the one who isकृतं कृतोपकारं जानाति. But is this reason valid, if given ? Does not Rama show gratefulness?

  

One may, then argue that he could have shown gratefulness, but that is not such a central feature of his personality as to be enlisted in the very beginning of the book. But even this is not correct. He 'brothers' many 'others' out of gratefulness to them only. (brother -other here, is sābhiprāya and anyāpadēśa, hope at least some understand)

  

Another reason that could have justified the meaning 'one who knows how to act upon it (what is right)' is that the word*dharmajña* can not communicate this meaning. But the word*dharmajña* does not just mean 'the one whoknows what is right' it also means 'the one who knows how to act upon it'. There is no need to use an additional word to communicate that meaning.
