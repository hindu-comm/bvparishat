Thank you Prof. Prasad. It is possible Goldman relied on Monier-Williams, but still, M-W says "knowing what is right" and not "knowing how to act on what is right".

  

It is natural to assume that in Goldman's "knows both what is right and how to act upon it", the former ("knows what is right") is the translation of धर्मज्ञ/*dharmajña*and the latter ("knows how to act upon it") is the translation of कृतज्ञ/*kṛtajña*. If this is the case, then M-W entry of "knowing what is right" does not appear to be the reason for Goldman's strange (or shall I say problematic) translation of कृतज्ञ/*kṛtajña*. Or, Goldman reversed the order and translated कृतज्ञ/*kṛtajña* as"knows what is right" following M-W and translated धर्मज्ञ/*dharmajña*as "knows how to act upon it". Still odd. Alf Hiltebeitel quotes Goldman [here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=U4NF8pYxdvIC&pg=PA415)(note 10)and gives his own translation as "one who knows dharma and who is grateful". Hiltebeitelclearly does not agree with Goldman's translation as seen by his phrase "rather than" before he quotes Goldman's translation "and how to act upon it".

  

Coming back to M-W, the meaning of "knowing what is right" and citation from Mahabharata is shamelesslycopied/plagiarized from[Böhtlingk Sanskrit-Wörterbuch in kürzerer Fassung](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWScan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php)(1879), which gives a meaning of कृतज्ञ/*kṛtajña*word as*das Rechte kennend
Mbh.12,104,6*. Another example of why I no longer trust M-W (I used to take it for granted some years back). The [online version of 1872](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MW72Scan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php)edition of M-W does not listकृतज्ञ, but the [1899 edition](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc2/index.php) has it. In between the two came Sanskrit-Wörterbuch in kürzerer Fassung in 1879. As usual M-W (or whoever worked on the second edition) did not even bother to cross-check. NowBöhtlingk's 1879 entry (*das Rechte kennend Mbh.12,104,6*) is also a strange case. The original 1855 edition of [Böhtlingk and Roth Grosses Petersburger Wörterbuch](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWGScan/2013/web/webtc2/index.php)does not have this entry under the word. The citation is difficult to trace, there are several occurrences of the word कृतज्ञ in Shanti Parva as can be seen in the [Digital Corpus of Sanskrit](http://kjc-sv013.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=fundstellen&IDWord=3489&IDText=154)and the searched in the [Unicode text](http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/unic/mbh12_sa.html). None of them in any chapter close to 104. We do not know which verse Böhtlingk’s second edition had in mind. It seems to me Böhtlingk’s second editionhad a careless error which was copied by Monier-Williams. I have never seen the word कृतज्ञ being used as or explained as "knowing what is right" or "knowing how to act on what is right". If कृत means what is right, how do we explain the popular words सुकृत and दुष्कृत?

  

Whatever be the reasons for Böhtlingk, M-W, or Goldman to explain the word in a certain way, this all shows that we cannot take their dictionary entries/translations for granted.
