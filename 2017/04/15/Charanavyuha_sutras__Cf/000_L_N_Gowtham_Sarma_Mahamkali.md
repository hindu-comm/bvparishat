Namaskaram  
I have Charanavyuha sutras of rigveda (by shaunaka), shukla yajurveda(by kaatyayana) and atharvaveda (probably by kautsa). I couldn't find and not aware of any Charanavyuha sutras for samaveda and krishnayajurveda. I request to please let me know here if any of these exist.  
Thank you
