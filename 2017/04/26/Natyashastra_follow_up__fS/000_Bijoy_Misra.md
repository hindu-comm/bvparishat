Dear scholar friends,  

  
Thank you all for letting me share my private grief in this forum.  

The rituals were completed yesterday. Being abroad, we don't  

get an opportunity to be together with family always. But then  
as I observe there is tremendous work to be done on behalf of  

India to help educate the youth and the world. I am grateful  

to you all for your help and support.  
  

I resumed my reading of नाट्यशास्त्र yesterday. Before we engage  

ourselves in discussion, I want to create a bibliography of any  

analytic studies on the subject. This should contain topics  

like (i) origin and practice of drama and dance (ii) literature  

evidence through the Vedas and the Old Prakrit (ii) origin of  

the technical terms in anatomy and postures (iv) literature  

preceding Bharata on the compilation.  You can post here or  

write to me privately. I will report my findings in a month.  
  

On another topic, I have agreed for a Town Hall public lecture  

and I have chosen to speak on Mantra to engage a conversation.  

I plan to go into breathing, pronunciation and cosmology.  

I have a question regarding the ancestry of the word मन्त्र.  

I seek help with a reference or with your opinion.    
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra  
  

PS. I saw the note of Prof Madhav Deshpande's retirement.  

His tutorial book was the key in my work in promoting the language  

locally. Most of the young Sanskrit teachers were trained through the book.  
I express gratitude. Let me wish him many more years of productive work!
