Coupled with a morph-engine and sandhi-engine, this could be useful in building a spell-checker, auto-correct etc. (Compounds will still present a difficulty but then good work is happening in resolving compounds, verifying validity of forms etc.). If future Sanskrit publications have fewer mistakes, it would be a great service because it is becoming more and more difficult to get good proof-readers.
