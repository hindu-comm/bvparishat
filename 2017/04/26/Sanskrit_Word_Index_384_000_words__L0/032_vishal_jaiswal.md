Well said, the grammar-centric approach is not very effective.  

Except Sanskrit still does not have enough of an environment yet in which one could choose to be immersed in. The same applies to reading that one could possibly use -- I dont refer to esoteric philosophy & other areas. SB literature is a tiny start.
