I broadly agree with with Dr. Sastrisays but this sentence is hard for me to understand. For sutras are we talking about mechanical word meaning which any dictionary can provide or do different philosophical tradition try get support for their doctrines an theories in sutras . When the later is true a dictionary is not of much help The sutras remain an enigma if one tries to get meaning outside the oral and written traditions The enigma will become clear if one is a part of the oral and written tradition irrespective of what school of thought one has inclination to.
