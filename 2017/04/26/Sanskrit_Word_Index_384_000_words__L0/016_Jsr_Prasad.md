Dear Prof. Gourisankar Ji,  
  

Namaste. Dr. Mārcis Gasūns is involved in a different kind of work.  
  

Sringeri Sankara matha has already started a project in this direction, a couple of years back. Dr. Vidyasankar Sundaresan Ji has announced this in the list some time back. You may like to visit the home page at - <http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/>  
  

Also, our list member Sri Shankara Ji has done a wonderful job at this designated site, on Complete Works of Sankaracharya (pdf) - <http://hinduebooks.blogspot.in/2010/08/works-of-sri-sankaracharya-sanskrit-20.html>  

  

Regards
