Dear BVK Shastry,

  

The problems which students face are manifold. I think I should narate my experience. 

As a student of Standard V my father appointed a Sanskrit teacher. That exercise was an utter failure. In VIII standard I had taken up Sanskrit as a third language and the sole teacher of Sanskrit in an English Medium Convent School had no intention of teaching Sanskrit. Finally for my Eleven Class Board Exam I chose Hindi. 

  

I will narate to you why children fail to pick up Sanskrit in School inspite of the fact that lakhs and lakhs of students appear for Board Exams with Sanskrit as an optional language. 

  

The first thing is that vernacular grammar is not taught which was the case 100 years ago. 

Secondly the study of the English Language distorts the phonetic structure so much that the students can barely memorize the Noun and verb forms.

Thirdly english medium students are never taught cases and moods which the english language barely has. 

I doubt whether even 0.01 percent of the children are capable of solving Wren and Martin Grammar Book. I myself never went beyond the first chapter Subject and Predicate in my school days.

Added to this the new way of teaching English Grammar restricts the student from interpreting the vernacular grammar.

The various phonetic deformities that each Indian Vernacular Language faces inhibit children from fluently reading, writing, speaking and understanding Sanskrit. These shortcomings have not been evaluated and addressed.

  

It is only when the student is conversant with all the aspects of Grammar of the medium of Instruction will he be in a position to appreciate and pick up Sanskrit. This aspect has been totally overlooked.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
