No word order yet, just a crude list.

That I do not insist on. They come from Sanskrit dictionaries.

Sanskrit dictionaries contain Prakrit words. But if you exclude one

word, you need to excludemanymany more. And why would you?

In that case, it's not the whole book, but a part. And as there are only

a few hundred such words, so be it - that's what I thought.

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de>, or 33 dictionaries

But it is Unicode.

  

As per "help one verify if a particular word" - that's not useless. I myself use it every day to verify validwords.

  

As per "spell-checker, auto-correct" - I've built one for MS Word, the only thing missing is suffixes and morphology.



As per "co-ordinates of the work where a word occurs" - I can add in which dictionaries it occurs. As per texts, we

can trust only<http://kjc-sv013.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/>, but it contains 1/100 of the literature wanted. Or we can wait

another 1800 years to see the final letters of the Poona dictionary. So I guess we'll have to wait for this feature.
