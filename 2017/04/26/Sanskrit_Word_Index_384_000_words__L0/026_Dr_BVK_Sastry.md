Namaste



I agree with Marcis on the observations below. I am thinking to reason out :Why Sanskrit studies got in to this phase ?



a) \< Most beginner don't know the root form of all the word. They quickly want to know the meaning of the word they are reading. For that usage this work will be of not much help.> **Because** the current pedagogy of Sanskrit Education does not teach the Human Process of ‘ Root Extraction ’ , as a ‘ Bhashaa Samskara Paddhati’ and directs reliance on ‘ Machine resources’. 



b) \< Not even close. Grammar is grammar, a dictionary is a dictionary. What you are asking about is done in Bucknell, let others correct me if there are more sources. I agree that it would be good to add some forms (like pronouns) in dictionaries as well, but I'm not aware what's the vyakarana standpoint on this issue. > **Because** the current pedagogy of Sanskrit Education separated the ‘ **Vyakarana** ( Sutra method for word generation) – **Kosha – Nirukti / Nirukta** ( using Kaaraka- Anvaya method )’ Combination approach :: Word Generation for expression of an intention (= Pada vyutpatti) – Proper Articulation for facilitation of comprehension – Right Process of Decoding the given word to unwrap the speakers intention ( = Vivakshitaartha vacahakah Shabdah)’.





There is no easy push button in Samskruth Resources’ for solving the user expectation : ‘ tvaritaa vaktaarah’ – ‘ Fast instantaneous Comprehension and Immediate Response’.

If this tradition had been so, the three word sentence ‘ Athato – Brahma – Jijnyaasaa’ would not have been discussed for five thousand years plus by brilliant minds of Bharath; and still remain an enigma.
