Regarding the great Poona Sanskrit dictionary, Gudrun Buhnemann mentioned to me in 1995 that a person could look up words in the unpublished portions by way of a card file in Poona. She had done this a number of times while staying in Poona. In other words, the gathering of the terms for this dictionary had long since been completed, and they had been filed on cards and arranged alphabetically. So it seems that the work of compiling this dictionary is finished, and only the printing remains.  
  
Of course, printing books this large and complex is no small matter. Judging from the last volume to be printed, I must assume that financial problems are the cause of the slowdown or halt in publishing. The last volume was bound in plain blue cloth with no title stamped on it, rather than bound in black Rexine with title stamped in gold lettering, like the previous eight volumes. The size of the volumes has also been steadily decreasing. The first two volumes can rightly be described as magnificent productions.  
  

If financial difficulties are in fact the reason for the slowdown or halt in publishing, I would think that the worldwide scholarly community could come together and do something about this. How many of us would be happy to contribute to seeing this priceless resource come to completion, to say nothing of foundations or institutions that could provide grants. Perhaps someone in Poona can provide current information about the situation with the publishing of this dictionary.
