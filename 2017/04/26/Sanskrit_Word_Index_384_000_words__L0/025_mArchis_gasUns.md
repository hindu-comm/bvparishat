In this case you need Bukcnell'sManual. It's the only books that containswhat you are are looking for in an easy to grasp visual form. See:

Not even close. Grammar is grammar, a dictionary is a dictionary. What you are asking about is done in Bucknell, let others correct me if there are more sources.

I agree that it would be good to add some forms (like pronouns) in dictionaries as well, but I'm not aware what's the vyakarana standpoint on this issue.
