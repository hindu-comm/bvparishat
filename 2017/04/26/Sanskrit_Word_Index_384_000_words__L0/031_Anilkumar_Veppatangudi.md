One does not need to learn grammar if one wants to 'pick up' a language. A child learns a language just by being around in an atmosphere where the language is spoken. When one goes to an area where the language is different from one's own, the new language is picked up just by being there and absorbing the spoken language. No language can be taught except academically by someone with knowledge of all the rules of grammar. A classic case is the failure of the attempt to introduce Esperanto. A grammarian only records the generalities and exceptions of a language as it is spoken and does not impose any rules. Also, language changes probably every 200 kms and therefore there is no way one can introduce a perfect language. All languages evolve and are not manufactured..
