Dictionaries do not contain verb forms. The list is already 2000 pages big. Some verbs have, let's say 270 forms, multiplied by 2200 dhatus, by 19-21upasarga(with combinations) - such a list can exist only on PC. There is one on Huet's website.

Even<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/KRMScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php> has not all of them.

It's an illusion. Why do you want to find a word with word endings in a dictionary? Look for "s" or "r" instead.
