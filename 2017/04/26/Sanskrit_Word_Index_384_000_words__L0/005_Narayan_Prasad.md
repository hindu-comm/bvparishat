Namaste !

  

A great painstaking work !

  

I had a cursory look in the initial part and found the first few words as:

अ

ऐचदेव

ऐचुला

ऐबुक

ऐवुलि

अऋण

  

Why such word-order ? Are ऐचदेव, ऐचुला, ऐबुक, ऐवुलि Sanskrit words ? What are the sources ?

The devanagari version does not appear to be in unicode.

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
