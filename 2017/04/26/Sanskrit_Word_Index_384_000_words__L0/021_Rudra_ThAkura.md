   Does it mean sanskrit dictionaries do not have verb form? or does it mean dictionaries in general do not have verb form.

  

In english dictionary , I see all forms of word "Go" like gone. going , goner etc..

Most beginner don't know the root form of all the word. They quickly want to know the meaning of the word they are reading. For that usage this work will be of not much help.



It is good starting work, but to me it looks far from complete.



Thanks,
