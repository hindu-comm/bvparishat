Sir, IIT Kanpur has done excellent work on Gita, Upanishads and Brahmasutra. It would be a grave mistake if I don't mention respective website - <https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/>  
  

The interface allows you to access the Bhashya, English/Hindi commentaries. The project has been the brain child of Respected Prof. Vineet Chaitanya Ji, in collaboration with other IIT Professors.
