Dear David and Nancy,

  

  From what I understand about the Deccan College dictionary, it is not correct to say "So it seems that the work of compiling this dictionary is finished, and only the printing remains.". What is finished long time ago is collection of the data and alphabetization of the cards on which the data was collected for over 30 plus years. The editing process involves taking the data for a given word, and then interpreting it across historical and disciplinary variations and developments. Only after doing this, an entry for a given word is finalized and goes into final editing and printing. This is what is consuming most of the time. This is the general account I have heard in Pune.
