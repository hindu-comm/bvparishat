Dear Marcis,

  

  Shocking to hear: "Or we can waitanother 1800 years to see the final letters of the Poona dictionary." Someone had mentioned the number 800 years to me. I hope there are more expeditious ways to complete this great work, though not in my life-time. कालो ह्ययं निरवधिर्विपुला च पृथ्वी.
