Given that Kumarila Bhatta uses the word दाक्षिणात्य in the third person (स्वमातुलसुतां प्राप्य दाक्षिणात्यस्तु तुष्यति in the Tantravarttika), it is unlikely he was from Andhra/south himself.

  

As a similar example, the comment प्रियतद्धिता हि दाक्षिणात्याः in the Mahabhashya is cited by some authors to conclude that कात्यायान was from the south and Patanjali was not.
