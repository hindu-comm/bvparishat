Is there a book on Sri Kumarila Bhatta Paada's works, studying the cultural, geographical and other aspects as reflected in the book, something on the lines of books on the culture reflected in Mahabhashya?

  

That may help further scrutinize the apparently plausible theory of Aandhratva of Sri Kumarila Bhatta.
