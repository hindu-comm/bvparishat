The following passage from the Tantravarttika should settle whether Kumarila was from the south at all.

  

  

``` "As for example, in the Dravida language, though all words are used as ending in the consonant, yet the Aryas are found to assume in them the affixes, &c., that can be appended only to words ending in vowels, and thence make the words give a sense, in accordance with their own (samskrta),  language. For instance, when the Dravidas call 'rice', "'cor,'the Arya reads in it his own word 'cora' (thief), and comprehends the meaning accordingly. And when the Dravidas call the road 'atar', he reads it as 'atarah', and declares that as the road is difficult to cross, it is really 'atara' (uncrossable). Similaly they call the snake 'pAp,' and he takes it as 'pApa' (evil), and argues that the snake is really an evil animal. So, too, in the case of the word 'mAl' which they use in the sense of the  woman, the word is taken as 'mAlA'. The word 'vair', used by them in the sense of the stomach, is taken as 'vaira' (enemy); and the use is justified on the ground of the hungry man being capable of doing many sinful deeds, which proves that the stomach is an enemy of the man."

From KumArila bhaTTa's TantravArttika (Vol. I, p 219), transl by Mm Ganganatha Jha, Sri Satguru Publications, Delhi, 1983. ] ```

``` The deletion of terminal vowels from the cited Dravida words tells its own story.

``` Hope this helps, ```
