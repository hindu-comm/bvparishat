That is really interesting and very much plausible.

  

I am pleasantly surprised at the Telugu language knowledge of vidwan Sri Ushavishnuvamsi mahodaya.

  

(The 'Prathamaa vibhakti' suffixes are ordered as"डु मु वु लु" though. The reason isडु मु वु are of singular number andलु is of plural. )

  

Vidwan Sri Ushavishnuvamsi mahodaya is right in his observation that the plural suffixलुis used for honorific singular too.

  

Moreover, to useलुas the male name ending even in a non-honorific general sense also. (The origin of such a naming convention might or might not be from the honorific forms)

  

Kumarulu as a personal name even without an honorific suffix is fully as per the naming conventions of Telugu people, particularly of the coastal Andhra region.

  

Avadhaanlu etc. are quite common names among the s'rotriya families of that region.

  

Bhattu as the second word in the names of s'rotriya males is also quite prevalent in that region.

  

There was a vibrant Meemaamsaa adhyana adhyaapana tradition in that region in that region.

  

So the point made by vidwan Sri Ushavishnuvamsi mahodaya is highly acceptable.
