Dear Sirs

I have some questions on shaastra provisions  

1.How to define nitya agnihotram ?

what is the eligibility criteria to be nitya agnihotraH

What is the procedure for nitya agnihotram, timing , articles required
etc

Pl give me shashtra provisions with reference shlokas.

2\. What is the meaning of "ashTaa varShaat bhavEt kanya'?and what is the importance of this rule?Is " sharada chattam" imposed under british rule ,not contraryto the rules of this "ashTaa varShaat bhavEt kanya'?

Is this opposed by the then brahmin community or by any dharmika peetham?

Kindly place your ideas on this vidvat forrum.

With best Regards

A.H.Prabhakara Rao
