Dear list

  

I am looking for a digital copy of Rupamandana, whose fourth chapter describes the ekamukha, trimukha, and chaturmukha linga-s.

  

An edition with Hindi translation has been published by MLBD, but I am sure there will be a older out-of-copyright publication:

<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=yQrPTN0By1cC>  

  

DLI has a book called Jaina Rupamandanda, which I am not sure is the same work as the work I am looking for.

  

Any pointers would be helpful.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
