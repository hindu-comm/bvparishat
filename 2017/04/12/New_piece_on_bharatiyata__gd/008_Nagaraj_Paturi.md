\>What it needs to add to itself is modern science and technology which will add another dimension to its development.

  

Yes sir, that is what we have been doing. Going on adding science and technology. We now have a huge number of engineers, doctors etc. Our progress in these areas is now being globally recognized.

  

But apart from that, the world is also now recognizing ancient Indian contribution in the areas of medicine ( huge global success of the businesses of Ayurvedic medicines etc. prove this. Spread of Yoga all over the world, as a physical and mental health tool is another proof. ), in the area of linguistics ( incorporation of ancient Indian ideas into modern linguistics proves this.)

  

After environmentalist review of the present science and technology, it is now being recognized that the direction S & T takes (took till now) is a consequence of the culture and worldview from which it comes.

  

The world is waiting for a contribution from eco-friendly cultures like that of India to give a new nature-saving , earth-saving direction to S & T. 

  

There are many such ways in which India, in stead of being a good learner and practitioner of the existing S & T ( which it has proved well), can contribute in that area based on its indigenous knowledge systems.

  

Workshop that is being discussed in the news article and many such activities in India today are focusing on such aspects as far as S & T is concerned, though they are focusing much beyond S & T, on Social Sciences, Humanities and other academic areas on similar lines and are calling all such contribution from India as Indianization of Education.

  

The point is that the news article reflects a complete lack of awareness of such understandings that are there in the movements for Indianization of education.
