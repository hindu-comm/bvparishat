The biggest threat to our culture comes from within. The first was to disband Sanskrit as a medium to knowledge in favour of Prakrit. Then came the era of formal Indian languages, followed by islamization of these languages and finally now their Anglicisation through English.
With the very little Sanskrit that I know I sincerely feel that there is a growing precipice between words, their meaning and their प्रत्यय
experience. Patanjali has brought out this aspect very clearly in the first anhik of his Mahabhashya. If things have to be set right it is necessary that the unassailed position of Sanskrit as a medium of learning be re-established over all other aspects. Language is much more than a mere means of communication. It shapes not only the culture of a people but also its personality.
