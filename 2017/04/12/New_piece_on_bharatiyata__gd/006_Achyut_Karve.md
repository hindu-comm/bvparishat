The core of education lies in fostering the innate abilities of a child so that when he comes of age he will not only be responsible to himself but to society at large. (Family, community, .... Nation) and not just to a particular set of beliefs or ideologies. One need not call oneself Indian. India had, has and will continue to have it's own unique approach because of its history and geography. What it needs to add to itself is modern science and technology which will add another dimension to its development.
