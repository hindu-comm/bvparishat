Dear Sri Sreekar ,

  

You may be right in guessing the intention of the writer.

  

My observation is that the westernized Indians like their model westerns consider Aghoris, Taantriks etc. as those elements of Indian culture that can embarrass those Indians who are proud of their culture. That is the reason why they, in their descriptions of India through their media, repeatedly highlight visuals of these along with their own misrepresenting words such as cannibalism etc. in the voice-over.

  

You seem to be aware of the Abhinavagupta list and there, you might have observed a discussion on a protest launched by Indian origin and India-friendly American professors against such a piece on CNN channel , the link to the article communicating the protest being [here](https://medium.com/@longjd/religion-scholars-object-to-inaccuracies-exoticism-in-first-episode-of-reza-aslans-believer-7e69643326ac).

  

These westernized Indians and their western inspirers wrongly imagine that their poor understanding about these traditions that makes them look at them as awkward is the understanding of the Indian tradition insider too about them and imagine that Indian tradition insider gets embarrassed about these traditions being part of their culture. With this imagination that their imagined understanding is the understanding of the tradition insider , they repeatedly invoke such points with the intention of embarrassing the tradition insider.
