Dear Prof. Korada. Thank you for that very illuminating grammatical angle on a difficult reading in a difficult text and commentary. I would just like to make one additional point, taking into account some of the comments in the 2012 discussion that Sri Subrahmanian referred to earlier in this thread.

  

As this upanishat is actually part of the S'uklayajus samhitA, there is a tradition of pada-krama and vikRti pAThas for it. As per these pAThas, it is saMbhUtim, because we have the recitation as saMbhUtim iti saM - bhUtim in the first quarter and saMbhUtyA (sambhUtyeti sam - bhUtya) in the last quarter of this verse.

  

In contrast, the pATha for the 12th verse (where asaMbhUti and sambhUti are first introduced) has the split specifically as asaMbhUtim ityasaM - bhUtim.

  

SankarAcArya's bhAshya on the 14th verse takes the word as asaMbhUtyA in the last pada, assuming that there is a savarNa sandhi with the preceding word, tIrtvA, followed by (a)saMbhUtyA. The bhAshya is consistent when we read it all together, from verse 12 onward.

  

In the very first verse of this upanishat, SankarAcArya takes Is'A + vAsya as separate words, unlike other commentators who explain it as a samAsa, Is'a-AvAsya. In this instance, the padapATha says that there are two padas, Is'A + vAsya, and not one samasta pada, Is'AvAsya. So here the SAnkara bhAshya reading is consonant with the padapATha, unlike in verse 14. The consonance with padapATha is reversed for these two verses when we examine other commentators! 

  

It seems to me that it is not a good idea to either support/criticize or even try to correlate a bhAshyakAra's reading of a verse with the padapATha rendition of the words in that verse. Of course, this is a curious situation only for this text, as the other major upanishat texts are from the brAhmaNa and AraNyaka sections, so that we do not have pada-kramAdi pAThas for external reference.

  

Namaskaras,

Vidyasankar
