Please refer A Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar. The term *bha*is assigned by Panini for special operations, including those operations where*pada-karya* (*jaśtva*, *utva*, *anusvāra*, etc)is not desired. *Pada* and *bha* are mutually exclusive except in rare cases like the Vedic usage*ṛkvatā* (RV 4.50.5, explained under A 1.4.20*ayasmayādīnicchandasi*) where both*pada-karya*and*bha-karya*are seen.
