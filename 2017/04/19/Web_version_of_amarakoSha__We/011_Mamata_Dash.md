Please Sir,

There are some lexicons mentioned by Medinikara are not available, but there are some lexicons composed during 17th 18th century. the numbers are in hundred. We are exactly working on a compendium of lexicons.

Please provide a list of the lexicons available in net. The number you mention as 34 is very interesting.

Thanks to the volunteers who have worked for the benefit of the scholars.

with regards
