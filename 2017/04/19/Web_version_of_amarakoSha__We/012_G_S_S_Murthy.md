I want a simple facility where you input a Sanskrit noun and you will get all the synonyms with their genders. I do not know whether there is one which covers just Amarakosha, let alone others. I am aware of Stardict linking but somehow it seems to spew too much. Simply typing all synonyms together with a suitable gender coding (m,f,n,mn,fn,fm,fnm etc) on a Word File will meet the requirement.It would be a small (Amarakosha only) but I believe a very useful project. As Ambaji has pointed out the Great Work done by her group has a different primary aim.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
