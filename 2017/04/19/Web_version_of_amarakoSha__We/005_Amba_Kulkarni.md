Namaste.  
  

If I understand correctly, Murthy garu wants a searchable text of all Koshas, and not the interface that we built.  

Our interface, though provides the relevant shlokas as well, it provided much more information such as the classification of the pada into one of the classes of Nyaaya-Vaisheshika, and various relations a word can have with the other words in the that varga.  

  

Regarding including data from other koshas into this system,  

a\) This can be given as a small project to the MPhil / MA students who are interested in such work, or  

b\) volunteers may come forward.  
  

I, along with my student Dr Shivaja, am ready to provide the necessary guidance, if needed.  
  

The expertise needed is: some knowledge of vyaakarana (to identify the praatipadika and linga of the words, and split the shloka into padas after dissolving the sandhi) and knowledge of Nyaaya Vaisheshika classification of padaarthas, in order to classify each pada into one of these classes.  
  

Best regards,
