The present web version of Amarakosha does provide this information.  

For example, for 'तृष्णा' , when the relation is selected as पर्यायवाची, we get the following display.  
on.

  
पर्यायवाची(Synset)  

  

अर्थः :: स्पृहा \| वर्गः :: नाट्यवर्गः \| , दोहद, इच्छा, काङ्क्षा, स्पृहा, ईहा, तृष्, वाञ्छा, लिप्सा, मनोरथ, काम, अभिलाष, तर्ष, भग, रुचि, तृष्णा, श्रद्धा, प्रतियत्न, छन्दस्

  

अर्थः :: पिपासा \| वर्गः :: वैश्यवर्गः \| , उदन्या, पिपासा, तृष्, तर्ष, तृष्णा  
  

  

  

Further, if we place a cursor over any of these words, we get the काण्ड, वर्ग, श्लोक, पाद and लिङ्ग information for each word.  
  

And finally, the whole shloka is available, if we place the cursor on the head words अर्थः :: स्पृहा / अर्थः :: पिपासा  
  

I hope this serves your purpose.  
  

With kind regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
