Is this something what you are asking for? amarakoSa, Shabdakalpadruma etc are loaded when I searched divaukas. There are at least 34 such dictionaries from Cologne servers available. Better part is it can be used offline. If it sounds interesting to anyone, I can send a detailed announcement on list separately.
