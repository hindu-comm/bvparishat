Thanks, Sh. Kn Ramesh Ji. My paragraph was badly structured. What I meant to say was that out of four hands, the identification of two hands (abhaya mudra and fire hand) is clear from the translation of 2797, that leaves two hands (gajahasta mudra and drum hand) to be identified with Si and Va. And I guessed their respective identification from the translation of 2798.

  

As forNa being represented by mazhu (axe) as you mention, that is a bit confusing as there is no axe in the Nataraja iconography.
