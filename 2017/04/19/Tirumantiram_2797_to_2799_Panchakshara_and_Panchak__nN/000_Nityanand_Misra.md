Dear list

  

Tirumantiram verses 2797 to 2799 symbolically identify the five syllables of the *panchakshara mantra* and the five activities constituting the*panchakritya* (common to Shaiva Siddhanta and Pratyabhijna) with parts of the Nataraja dance form. I am referring the translation byDr. B. Natarajan under [here](http://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/tirumantiram/Tirumantiram.pdf) (page 670).

  

Some questions I have are

1\) Is Tirumantiramthe first text to make this five-fold identification of Nataraja iconography with the panchakshara mantra and the panchakritya?

2\) Is the translation by Natarajan reliable? I ask this because I have zero knowledge of Tamil.

3\) Am I right in assuming that in verse 2797, the hand that says "Leave this, be reformed" is the hand that holds the drum, and the hand that says "Come unto me, Be united in me" is the hand in the gajahasta mudra? The translation of 2797 makes it clear that hand holding the fire represents the syllable Na, and from“fear not” I can guess that the hand in the abhaya mudra represents the syllable Ya. That leaves the hand holding the damaru and the hand in the gajahasta mudra. My assumption is following the translation of the verse 2798 which kind of makes it obvious, but I would like to confirm just in case.

  

  

2797: Signification of Five-Lettered Mantra in Siva Dance

"Leave this, be reformed,"

-Thus to Jivas, gestures one hand in letter "Si;"

"Come unto me, Be united in me"

-Thus to Tapasvins gestures another flower-like hand in letter "Va;"

"Be in, Deva, fear not."

Thus to Celestials gestures, the golden hand in letter "Ya."

The hand that holds fire

Gestures the letter "Na;"

The foot on earth planted in dance

Gestures the letter "Ma;"

(Thus is the entire Five-Letter Mantra

"Si Va Ya Na Ma"

In Divine Dance denoted.)

  

2798: Further Signification of Dance-Form in Relation to Five Letter Mantra

The hand that holds the drum, (Si)

The hand that sways, (Va)

The hand that offers Refuge, (Ya)

The hand that holds the blazing Fire, (Na)

The lotus-foot, firm, on Anava Mala planted, (Ma)

-Thus of the Divine Dance Form

Si Va Ya Na Ma denotes.

  

2799: Symbolism of Siva Dance

Hara's drum is creation;

Hara's hand gesturing protection is preservation;

Hara's fire is dissolution;

Hara's foot planted down is Obfuscation (Tirodayi)

Hara's foot, raised in dance, is Grace (Redemption) abiding.
