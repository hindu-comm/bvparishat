Thanks Sreekanth ji...

Normally the four hands of Nataraja are :

Upper right hand - drum /damaru

Upper left hand - Agni

Lower right hand- Cobra in fist showing abhaya mudra

Lower left hand - Gajahasta mudra showing foot.

  

Where does the deer part come here?

  

Where does the mazhu or axe appear...?

  

can I conclude that these are the substitutes of agni ....??
