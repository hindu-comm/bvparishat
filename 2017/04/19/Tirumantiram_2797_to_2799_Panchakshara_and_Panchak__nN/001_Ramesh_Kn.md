[TABLE]

  
Above are the 3 verses you are referring to.

They are here:<http://www.tamilvu.org/library/l4100/html/l41A0ind.htm>

  

\>\>1) Is Tirumantiramthe first text to make this five-fold identification of Nataraja iconography with the panchakshara mantra and the panchakritya?

  

I have no idea on this.

  

\>\>2) Is the translation by Natarajan reliable? I ask this because I have zero knowledge of Tamil.

It seems to be OK... But I dont know which bhashyam he followed while translating.

  

  

3\) Am I right in assuming that in verse 2797, the hand that says

\>\> "Leave this, be reformed" is the hand that holds the drum,

Yes you are right...

  

\>\> and the hand that says "Come unto me, Be united in me" is the hand in the gajahasta mudra?

Yes you are right...

  

\>\>The translation of 2797 makes it clear that hand holding the fire represents the syllable Na,

Probably .... but the explanation given in tamil, says Na is represented by mazhu ... that is axe...

  

\>\>and from“fear not” I can guess that the hand in the abhaya mudra represents the syllable Ya.

Yes you are right...  

  

As per the explanation given at<http://www.tamilvu.org/slet/l41A0/l4170uri.jsp?song_no=2752&book_id=118&head_id=67&sub_id=2564>.  

  

\>\>That leaves the hand holding the damaru and the hand in the gajahasta mudra.

This I am not able to understand. already both hands have been explained.

  

\>\>My assumption is following the translation of the verse 2798 which kind of makes it obvious, but I would like to confirm just in case.

The translation give is :

\>\>2798: Further Signification of Dance-Form in Relation to Five Letter Mantra  

The hand that holds the drum, (Si) - Right

The hand that sways, (Va)- Right

The hand that offers Refuge, (Ya)- Right

The hand that holds the blazing Fire, (Na) - It is stated as the hand having axe & not fire

The lotus-foot, firm, on Anava Mala planted, (Ma) - Right

-Thus of the Divine Dance Form

Si Va Ya Na Ma denotes.

As per the explanation given here :<http://www.tamilvu.org/slet/l41A0/l4170uri.jsp?song_no=2753&book_id=118&head_id=67&sub_id=2564>

  

Verse number shown here is 2752. But I confirm this is the verse you were looking for.

  

\>\>2799: Symbolism of Siva Dance

Hara's drum is creation;

Hara's hand gesturing protection is preservation;

Hara's fire is dissolution;

Hara's foot planted down is Obfuscation (Tirodayi)

Hara's foot, raised in dance, is Grace (Redemption) abiding.

  

all are right.
