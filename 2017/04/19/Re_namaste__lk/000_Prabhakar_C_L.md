Happy you attended,

Let us also plan a seminar of your like with topics assigned to the speakers before hand

happy that this Veda came into limelight again due to this effort. Yajnavalya and suryaBhagavan should he pleased and encourage us for furtherance on the Veda.

This time we invite Dr Ganesh k who responded to your mail too.

when i look at the digest of topics and discussion in BVP circle only two updates are mentioned as response to

your propositions.

By the time we organise the seminar. you too would have more questions on the Veda.

Of all the Samhitas of Veda SYV is later and so more contemporary life could be seen in the kandikas.

We should congratulate Dr V Pandurangi and his team for organising a seminar like that .

we wish all prosperity and more to him owing to the grace of Vedapurusha.

Vedo rakshati rakshitah.

regards,

prabhakar

I attended the seminar. It was interesting . I met Dr BVK Sastry had lunch together. Mr Ganesh was there I could not contact him.

  

There was no time for presenting a paper, so gave a copy to Dr. Pandurangi and requested him to mail his comments.

  

The level was more popular than research oriented. I suppose that was the object.

  

A well prepared research seminar is still due.

  

With regards and thanks for all the help. Regards,Nath
