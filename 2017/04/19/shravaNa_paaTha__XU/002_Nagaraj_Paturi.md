Its about a seemingly technical term 's'ravaNa paaTha' mentioned to Sri Krishna K.

  

where one ritvik recites and nine more give ahutis. The count of ahutis is taken as 10  

  

This kind of counting listeners as reciters was mentioned to him as श्रवण पाठ in some

  

atirudra yaaga, done on the completion of 5 or 6 centuries of original pratishtha at a local devasthana.  

  

He is asking scholars to help him know the authenticity of this.
