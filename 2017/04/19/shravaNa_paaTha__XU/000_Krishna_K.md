Namaste,

  

A friend had the following query -

--

If anyone knows what is श्रवण पाठ please give pramanas and explanation. If one person recites and four persons listen, I heard that it will be total 5 recitals. But I could not find any source for this.  

For some more background, it is atirudra yaaga, done on the completion of 5 or 6 centuries of original pratishtha at a local devasthana. While there is consensus on the number of aahutis to be given, there is disagreement on how the ahutis are given. This श्रवण पाठ is the scheme, where one ritvik recites and nine more give ahutis. The count of ahutis is taken as 10. According to me, it is somebody's brain child. Such a practice means one samantraka and 9 amantraka ahutis. So the count is just one.

Is there any such thing called shravana paaTha? If yes, please provide the source. He'd be delighted.

  

Thanks,

Krishna
