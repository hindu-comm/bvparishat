Dear Prof. Nagararaj Paturi

  

Thank you for the links, really appreciate it. That refreshed my memory on the discussions then. Let me pursue this question in regards to Kanyakubj. Kanyakubj had 16 Gotras, not eight and was in the Panchal region. Was this a different set of Gotras? Like Valmiki, Sandilya etc. The Kanyakubj Vamsavali follows a different pattern. Like the Baudhanya SS has strict rules on marriage, but Kanyakubj allows intra-clan marriages within the 'Khatkul'. Any thoughts? I am really interested to know.

  

Best
