Dear Members

  

Namaste

  

I was reading in one of the discussions about the origin of Kashmir and it was interesting, a far cry from the 'Kashyap Mihira' explanation that we have known. I have a question on Gotras? What doesगोत्र truly mean? From the root word 'Go', it could imply the rays of the sun, or terrestrially to the cow. Is that true? How are Gotras a lineage or a clan? Really appreciate if someone can throw some light on Gotras. It must have started before Kanyakubj - is there anything that tells you about the origin?
