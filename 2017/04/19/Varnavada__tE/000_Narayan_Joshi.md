Namaskara

Thanks for your interest in my postings on Varnavāda

Here are answers to your questions

(1) The Varnamālā I used has 36 consonants and 15/16 vowels.

The first five rows (25 consonants) are the same as described by Katyayana in Vājasaniya pratishākya.

In the sixth row rearranged letters are /y/, /r/,/v/,/l/ and /ś/.

In the seventh row rearranged letters are /s/, /ş/, /h/ / ḻ /, /kş/.

In the eighth row has only one letter /jñ/ under /h/ of the seventh row.

Different grammarians have different views regarding extra sounds.

Some of you may have objections to letter arrangement in the last three rows. But it works for my semantic net bound from left to right and bottom to top.

The reference to Sphoţa appears in the Māhābhaşya. ( I may be corrected here). But discussions on varnas were there at least from Upavarşa.

What is the source of the word “Varņavāda”

1.  Book: “The Linguistic speculations of The Hindus” by Prabhatchandra
    Chakravarti, University of Calcutta 1933. On page 35,

Sankara finds, however, the varņavāda, as expounded by Upavarsa more reasonable than the sphotavāda-----

1.  Book: Contribution of Vācaspati Mishra to Indian Philosophy” by S.
    Ranganatha, Pratibha Prakashan, Delhi 1999.

 In this book from pages 88 to 95 there is discussion on varņavā da. The word varņavāda is used several times.

Varņavāda is not my invention. The new varņavāda is my invention where meanings are attached to the 36 consonants and 16/15 vowels based on their positions in the varņamālā table (periodic table of varņas).

1.  Book: Trends of Linguistic Analysis in Indian Philosophy,by Hari
    Mohan Jha, Chaukhamba Orientalia, Delhi, 1981, p.23

    On this page there is reference to varņavādins.

2.  Book:: A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy by Hajime Nakamura,
    Motilal Banarasidass, New Delhi, 1983, p.596.

    

    I can find more references from my home library.

    Thanks N.R.Joshi.
