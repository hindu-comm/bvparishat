Sri A.H. Prabhakara Rao garu is a septuagenarian scholar, having dedicated his post retirement life for Sanskrit propagation. Composing/checking mails he does on his own, no help is around. He is one of the very few inspiring persons at that age, in Hyderabad. Interested scholars may contact him directly to register/encourage/help him and the team, in his honest efforts.
