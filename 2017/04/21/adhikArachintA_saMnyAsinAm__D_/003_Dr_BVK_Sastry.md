Namaste



**Clarification request** on \< इदं संन्यासशास्त्रविरुद्धं न वा । \>
and \< तेन च ग्रन्थपाठान्नेदं **मुख्यान्त्येष्टि**रित्यवगम्यते \>



**Reason**: To go beyond a ‘ faith acceptance statement that it is a ‘ Mahaa –purusha Charita’ falling beyond human societal frame of analysis, with a conclusion \< **तेनेदमवसीयते** यत् श्रीशंकराचार्या एतस्या **जिज्ञासाया** **अविषयभूता** **इति** । \>. Acharya Shankaras greatness stands totally independent and in a tall order beyond this \< Karma –Kanda Social debate issue>.



(a) Tradition prescribes several layered practices and vows associated with ‘Sannyasa –Grahana- Aacaharna vidhi’. It does not fit in to the ‘ashrama progression presented as ‘ Gruhastha –to- vanaprashta- to - Sannyasa’ ! So which text is being used for rising the question ?



 The ‘sannyasa’ grahana of Shankara does not seem to fit in to the classical frame given in the Sannyasa upanishat
<http://merki.lv/vedas/Upanishadas/Sannyasa%20Upanishad%20_eng_.pdf>



 Nor does it seem to fit to the post Shankara/ modern practices of current period as ‘ order of initiation and saffron clothe’ in several institutions, the modern versions of which stand as ‘social pygmies performing a ‘ dress rehearsal’ ( ‘Nata’ - vat ) using the tall name from source works’. : See below:



<http://www.nayaswami.org/book/12-stages-to-sannyas.asp>

<http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2011/invdc11/intro.shtml>

<http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&section_id=674>

<http://multiplex.isdna.org/sannyasa.htm> 



(b) Do we have a specific reference beyond Shankara vijaya, on ‘ the nature, vows and order of Sannyasa’ taken by Acharya ? 

 Surely he was not a ‘ mathdhipati blessed Shishya’ when he took to Sannyasa. Nor did he have a institutional asset management and ‘ devotee –pleasing directive’ and compulsion to manage a legacy ‘ religion format of worship ( = Sangha model which was popular with the Buddhists ) .





C) On \< तेन च ग्रन्थपाठान्नेदं **मुख्यान्त्येष्टि**रित्यवगम्यते \> All ishtis are done by ‘ yajamana’. So ‘Anthya – ishti’ is the LAST, FINAL ishti performed by the LIVE YAJAMANA. This is a YOGA-KARMA linked to ‘ PRAYANA KAALA’ (See Gita: ).



After Death the individual is NOT having the status of ‘ YAJAMANA’.
The individual is in the state of ‘ PRETA before becoming a PITRU’.



The usage of the technical Samskruth word ‘ANTHYESHTI’ for the ADJUSTMENT and REALIGNMENT OF CHANGED CONDITIONS IN FAMILY, SOCIETY ( VYAVAHARA ) dual functionality of (i) Ritualistic disposal of the ‘ mortal body’ ( = martya paanchabhuatika shareera – samskaara ) and ( ii) ‘ Shubha- Oordhva Daihika Kriyaa for Sadgati of JEEVA’ is NOT done by the ‘ YAJAMANA’; but the successors of the ‘YAJAMANA’ for their own PITRU- RINA MUKTI.



This is how the Shaastra words in Samskrutham, loosing the ‘ Mukhya’- ‘Yoga-Artha’ ( Meaning and Purpose associated with Yoga) end up as
mummified relics of tradition. 



Your clarification on these points would help greatly.
