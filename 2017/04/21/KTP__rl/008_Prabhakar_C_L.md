We lost a diligent worker ,a committed scholar and promoter of interests of students and the research studies.

I had the opportunity to be his colleague in Central college, Bangalore university in the department of sanskrit along with another colleague , a benignant teacher and scholar Late Sri M. Krishnaswamy who was cause
to get Sanskrit Department in the Bangalore University in 1960s

His work , memories and kindliness etc., remains green in the annals of Sanskrit Scholarship and in the close circles..

May his soul rest in peace.

my homage to him.
