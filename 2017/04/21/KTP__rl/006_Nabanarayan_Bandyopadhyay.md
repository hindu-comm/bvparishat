Dear all,

We are very much shocked to learn that the great scholar Professor K. T. Pandurangi passed away recently. It is a huge loss to the academic fraternity of the Sanskrit and Indological studies. All those who fortunately came to his contact will never forget his profound scholarship and amiable loving nature. I also feel proud that he had loved me so affectionately and I was able to interact with him on many occasions. We are much indebted to him since he had donated to our School of Vedic Studies many manuscripts and books on Veda, Mimamsa, Vedanta, etc. It's a matter of pride that The Asiatic Society of Kolkata awarded him prestigious honour in recognition of his outstanding scholarship. I earnestly pray that his immortal soul rest in heavenly peace. I express my heartfelt condolences the bereaved members of his family.
