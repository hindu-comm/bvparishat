I had a few occasions to interact with Prof. K.T.Pandurangi a few decades ago. He was a colleague of my Acharya in Central College, Bengaluru. The last that I saw him was just a fortnight ago at the Uttaradi Maṭha, Bengaluru, where he had come (on wheel chair) to witness an event which featured a young scholar's examination by a few senior veteran scholars. The Prof. stayed for a while and was escorted back home by Sri S.R.Pandurangi, one of his relatives.
