Shri Nityanand Misra asked: \>How would there be a vṛddhi of ‘i’ in root ‘śiṣ’ if it is followed by a suffix with the anubandha ṇ?\<  
  
The question is justified. At the relevant point in my earlier email statement, I was making a guess about why the editor of Vṛṣabha (the late Prof. K.A. Subramania Iyer) rejected the reading karmaṇy aṇ in favor of karmaṇy ap and why scholars such as Shri Viṣṇu Nampūtiri and Prof. S. Korada considered the reading karmaṇy aṇ found in Malli-nātha’s Kumāra-sambhava commentary problematic. I was not stating any view of mine. I simply consulted the functions associated with the anubandha ṇ in G.V. Devasthali’s book \_Anubandha’s of Pāṇini\_ (pp. 124-128) and took what seemed to be a general function associated with ṇ to furnish the intended reason of the rejectors of the reading karmaṇy aṇ. The same reason also agrees with the fact that preference for ap, as against aṇ, was shown because the form to be explained/justified in Vṛṣabha’s commentandum (the Vākyapadīya Brahma-kāṇḍa-vṛtti) is graha (in avagraha), not grāha (which has the vṛddhi sound ā)  
  
I can now request Shri Viṣṇu Nampūtiri and Prof. S. Korada to state why they consider karmaṇy aṇ problematic when the derivate to be accounted for is (ava)śeṣa.  
  
Thanks for clarifying in the later part of your email how śeṣa can be derived under Pāṇini 3.3.19 and 3.3.57. I had the same number written in my copy of Vṛṣabha’s commentary.  
  
a.a.
