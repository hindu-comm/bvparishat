\>घञन्त एवायमित्यत्र नास्ति शङ्कालेश: । पन्नगगवीगुम्फेषु योजागरीत्तस्य मल्लिनाथस्य तथा प्रमादो मा भूत् । तस्माल्लेखकप्रमाद एवायं स्यात् । … विष्णुनम्पूतिरि: । \<

  

There are three difficulties with the proposed solution:

\(a\) Commentators who preceded Malli-nātha and were known tohim (e.g., Vallabha-deva, Aruṇa-giri-nātha) have given the ‘ghañ-anta’ explanation. If Malli-nātha agreed with them, he would have repeated (in one form or another) their explanation, or he would have skipped over the word entirely as not needing any explanation — as something already clarified, or he would have only given the word’s meaning without getting into the grammar of its derivation. Obviously, he either ignored, without intending to do so, how his predecessors had explained avaśeṣa or he felt a need to convey that he did not agree with the explanation his predecessors had given.

  

\(b\) ghañ is unlikely to corrupt intoaṇ. As far as possible, an emendation should be transcriptionally probable; a copyist should be likely to misread ghañ as aṇ; there should be sufficient writing similarity between the available (apa)pāṭha and the emendation or sādhu pāṭha) proposed. Otherwise, we could change any text the way we like and make it mean what \*we\* think it should contextually mean.

  

\(c\) As Prof. Korada has pointed out, ’to err is human’. That Malli-nātha was very learned in some field does not mean that he would never make a mistake in writing in that field; his competence makes it only less likely. So, पन्नगगवीगुम्फेषु योजागरीत्तस्य does not provide a precisely fitting argument.

  

In the mss of Vṛṣabha-deva’s commentary on Vākyapadīya/Trikāṇḍī 1.2 (p. 17 line 15 of K.A. Subramania Iyer’s edition), we see a corruption of karmaṇy ap to karmaṇy aṇ). Imagining that the same corruption has occurred inMalli-nātha’s Kumāra-saṁbhava commentary, we could emend कर्मण्यण् to कर्मण्यप्. This will be less drastic and transcriptionally more probable, given the similarity in the writing of ṇ and p that we see in many Indian scripts. The vṛddhi to which the ‘i” in root śiṣ would have been subjected with the anubandha ṇ will now be avoided and we would get a kṛdanta noun śeṣa that is actually attested. 

  

But can we find a prescription of ap in the karmaṇi sense in Pāṇini? Although an explicit rule allowing this is not found in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, at least some Pāṇinīyas seem to have imagined it to have existed in that text. In other words, a school of interpreting Pāṇini seems to have existed according to which Pāṇini did not wish to cover all the kṛdanta derivations in his work. His Aṣṭādhyāyī 3.3.12-87 was more like a supplementation or representative sample, not an exhaustive account (this is perhaps indicated by the wording of the sūtras 3.3.12-14: aṇ karmaṇi ca, ḷṭ śeṣe ca, and lḷṭaḥ sad vā)

  

I would be happy to get a better account than the one in the preceding paragraph from the prakriyāexperts like Shri Vishnu Namputiri and Prof. S. Korada who are fortunately active members of this forum. .
