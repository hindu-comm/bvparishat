Dear Prof. Aklujkar

  

How would there be a vṛddhi of ‘i’in root ‘śiṣ’ if it is followed by a suffix with the anubandha ṇ? The root is not ajanta, so ‘aco ñṇiti’ (7.2.115) will not apply. The upadhā does not have ‘a’, so ‘ata upadhāyāḥ’ (7.2.116) will also not apply. The suffix is not a ‘taddhita’ suffix, so ‘taddhiteṣvacāmādeḥ’ (7.2.117) will also not apply. If one sees examples like ‘māṃsaśīlā’ and ‘sukhapratīkṣā’, the suffix from the ‘halanta’ roots is ‘ṇit’ but but there is no vṛddhi. ‘śiṣ’ is similarly a ‘halanta’ root and I do not see how vṛddhi can take place in its case with a kṛt suffix that is ṇit.

Given that ‘ap’ is prescribed from‘ṛdorap’ (3.3.57) to ‘nigho nimitam’ (3.3.87) and that all these rules have the ‘adhikāra’ of ‘akartari ca kārake sañjñāyām’ (3.3.19) which extends right up to ‘ākrośe nañyaniḥ’ (3.3.112), ‘ap’ is very much possible in ‘karma’ which is a ‘kartṛbhinna kāraka’. Is that not the case?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
