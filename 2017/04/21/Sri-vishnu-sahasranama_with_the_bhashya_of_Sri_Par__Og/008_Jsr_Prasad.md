Dear Nityanananda ji,  
  
A version of Sri Parasara Bhattar's bhashyam with English translation by Pandita K.E. Partha Sarathy swami was authored in 1966, published by Ganesh&Co., Madras. Advantage of this edition is that the translator has taken up Sankara Bhashya also and comments on both, side by side.  

  

I just stumbled upon this file while searching in an old disk.  
You may download the file from this link - [https://we.tl/7aObpJjows](https://we.tl/7aObpJjows)  
Hope, this helps.
