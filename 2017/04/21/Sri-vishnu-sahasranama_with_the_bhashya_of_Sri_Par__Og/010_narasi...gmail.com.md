Namo vidvadbhya:

Thanks very much for the info on the book and the link, Prof Prasad Ji. Only thing is the book does not have the source text. The Delhi publication has the source text as well.



But studying both Shankaracharya’s commentary and Bhattar’s commentary is very useful.

Thanks for this publication, Prof. Prasad.



As per this, Poojya Bhattar seems to have commented at least briefly the Phalas'ruti too.



But there is no Bhattar commentary mentioned for the verse mentioned by Sri Sriram-ji.
