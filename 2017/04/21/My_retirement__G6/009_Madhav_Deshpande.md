Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  Thank you so much for this wonderful gift to me. Since my own books are now largely boxed up, I am delighted to have these digital versions to read. My own poems were in part inspired by this older Samvāda-Jharī. My retirement has begun, and our Ann Arbor home is now waiting for some buyer to buy it, and then we can migrate to our new home in California. Composing a Mahākāvya is a tall order, but I do want to continue writing Sanskrit (and Marathi) poetry. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
