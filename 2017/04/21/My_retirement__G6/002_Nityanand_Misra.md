Dear Prof. Deshpande

  

Two score and five years! It is the end of one illustrious journey, and beginning of another one. Wish you all the best for your migration and post-retirement life. I am sure the climate of California will be a welcome change from the snow of Michigan. Hope you keep actively participating in the discussions here.

  

Kind regards, Nityananda
