Respected Sir,

  

Retirement from a 'restricted domain' called University.

  

However, it teaches us a lot in personal and professional life to grow.  
  
An illustrious career of 45 years! I saw a few of our revered Gurus like you, who joined in service even at the age of 16.

  

I join Prof Paturi ji and Nityananda ji to echo the same views. I believe you will be more active in guiding the younger generation and continue to write Sanskrit poetry.

  

We wish you a happy and healthy post retirement life.

  

Best regards,

Prasad
