Thanks to everyone for your encouraging words regarding my retirement.
I hope to continue my contributions to the field of Sanskrit studies during my retirement, with fewer administrative and teaching commitments, and at the same time enjoy the company of our grand-children in California. I am looking forward to this transition, though leaving Ann Arbor, our home for the past 45 years, is not easy.
We have built long-term friendships within and outside the university, and will have to stay in touch with these friends from California. With best wishes,

  

Madhav
