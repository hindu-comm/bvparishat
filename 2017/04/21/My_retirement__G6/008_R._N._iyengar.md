Dear Prof.Deshpande,

I have benefited from your scholarly posts, discussions, comments and shared documents on various internet groups including BVP. This was by its very nature a one way traffic as there was nothing I could give you in return. However recently when I came across (in my father’s collection) a book not too well known outside Mysore-Bangalore region, it rang a bell; of your beautiful poem on the same subject posted at BVP! The book is titled: “Sītā-Rāvaṇa-Samvāda-jhari” (Uttara-bhāga) by Pt.Sātārāma Ṥāstri, with auto commentary published in 1919. The Pūrva-bhāga composed by his teacher (1899) is better known and is available at

It is quite possible you know the two books well. I am sharing a pdf scan of the Uttara-bhāga on your gmail, hoping you would enjoy the book including the English foreword by a Retd.Chief Engineer (the then Chairman of the BoS for Sanskrit, Mysore Univ., ) narrating the story behind the origin of the second part of the poem by the *śiṣya* of the author of the Pūrva-bhāga. I am attaching a few pages of the book here for information of BVP members.

  

Wish you compose a *Mahākāvya* after you move to California.

  

Best regards
