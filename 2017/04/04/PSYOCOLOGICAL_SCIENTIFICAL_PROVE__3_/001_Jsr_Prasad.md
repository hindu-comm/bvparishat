As per medical tradition, a disease can be both psycho-somatic and somato-psychic in nature. Mind has a greater role in causing/curing a disease. In Ayurveda, the treatment aspect said to be three fold -  
  
1. daiva vyapashraya (spiritual therapy) 2. yukti vyapashraya (rational therapy) and 3. sattvaavajaya (psycho-therapy).  
  
The episode that you mention falls under the first category. You can also refer to Mayura kavi who worshiped suurya, with regard to his kushtha roga. So the tradition says -  
  

पुराजन्मकृतं पापं व्याधिरूपेण बाधते ।  

तच्छान्तिरौषधैर्दानैः जपहोमसुरार्चनैः ।।  
  

The curative aspects could turn out to be psychological+spiritual or psychological+scientific or spiritual alone. Hope, this helps.
