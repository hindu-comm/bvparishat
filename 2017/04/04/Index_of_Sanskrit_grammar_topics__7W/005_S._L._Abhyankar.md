Dear Mr. Marcis,

  

Title of the this thread started by you seems to have different perspectives -

Index to Sanskrit Grammar TOPICS would actually be the CONTENTS-details of a book on Sanskrit grammar

There can be an Index of TERMS and their DEFINITIONS used in Sanskrit Grammar. This perspective is possibly served by the dictionary by Kashinatha-shastri Abhyankar

There can be an index of words used in Reference-texts of Sanskrit grammar such as अष्टाध्यायी. Searching on the internet I came across one such book here =><http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/word-index-of-panini-s-astadhyayi-with-hindi-commentary-and-astadhyayi-sutra-patha-at-end-NZA697/>

There can be indexes of particular class of words.

1.  धातुपाठ, especially the one arranged alphabetically [by Mr. Mihas
    Bayaryn](http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/dhatupatha_index_svara.html?lang=hi)
    is eminently an index for words of धातु-class. 2.  In गणपाठ the सर्वादि-गण is an index of all pronouns summarily
    mentioned in the सूत्रम् - सर्वादीनि सर्वनामानि (1-1-27)
