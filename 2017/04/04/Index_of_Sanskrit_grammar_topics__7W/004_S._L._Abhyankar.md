Don't we tend to think alike, Mr. Marcis ?

  

I have been also thinking that if अष्टाध्यायी has 3985 or so सूत्र-s for Sanskrit grammar, an index of all words in all the सूत्र-sshould become the INDEX of Sanskrit grammar. If Kashinatha-shastri Abhyankar's dictionary of Sanskrit grammar covers and contains all words inall the सूत्र-s, it would prove to be much more than the index.

  

Since गणपाठ, धातुपाठ, उणादिसूत्राणि are like appendices to अष्टाध्यायी, words in these appendices also merit to be considered as grammatical terms and should get compiled in a comprehensive index.

  

For the pattern to be followed for compiling a word-index, I am deeply impressed by the logic and pattern set by Raobahadur Prahlad Divanji in his [Critical Word Index to the Bhagavadgita](https://archive.org/details/CriticalWordIndexToBhagavadgita). wherein he has Primary word-index, secondary, tertiary and also quaternary word units.
