We have come across an ashtakabout Shri Gopal Bhatt Goswami, one of the founding fathers of the Gaudiya Vaishnav sampraday. The work is attributed to Kavi Karnapur.

  

The last verse of the ashtakam has us stumped. Shri Gopal Bhatt Goswami is a worshiper of Krishna who lived in Vrindavan. But the verse talks about Sarayug (Sarayu?)Tat... Raghuyuga could, I suppose,refer to ShriRam and Lakshman. But it seemsmore fitting if it referred to Raghunath Bhatt Goswami and Raghunath Das Goswami, two contemporaries of Shri Gopal Bhatt Goswami. Likewise sagraja shrila roopa would refer to Shri Roop Goswami and Sanatan Goswami. We suspect a double meaning of this versebut can't make it out.

  

If anyone has an idea, please respond. I would be most grateful for any help.

  

Here is the verse in question:

  

युगरघुवररूपः साग्रजश्रीलरूपो

यदुपरि समभावः स श्रीगोपालभट्टः ।

सरयुगतटप्रान्ते श्रीलराधैकबन्धोः

परमपतितम् ईशः पातु गोपालभट्टः ॥८॥

  

Ys,

  

V. dasi
