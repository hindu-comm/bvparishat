Dear Dmitri ji,

  

I think the 'ra' is meant to convey 'ramante' ('revel). I do not think it can be universally applied to all words having the 'ra'-ending. The vaktā assigns a meaning he desires to the word (vivakśā) to suit the context, etc. So, the meaning assigned depends on the author who might have several factors that demand such a meaning.

  

One example I readily remember is: śaṅkaraḥ'. Here, a popular etymology given is: śam (sukham) karoti (for 'kara') iti śaṅkaraḥ. So, here the 'raḥ' is not given the meaning of 'ramante', even though even in asuraḥ the component 'ra' is present.

Here, we might say asura is one who revels in indriya viśaya. asuratva will be asuśu (asuviṣayeṣu) ramaṇatvam.
