Namaste Dmitri Semenov



Thanks for the compliment and specific responses. The nuances you have touched, need a response note; for furthering the studies here with clarity.



This is where the yogaaartha approach to decode Samskruth term meanings (= yoga way of Samskruth studies, beyond the conversation mode, classical language construction and even the ‘ Ekaarthataa –Ekavakyataa’ constraints needs to be explored. This method of Samskruth studies, known as ‘Shadanga Veda Adhyayana / Vedanga Vyakarana / Samskrutham as Vak- yoga’ is as old as ‘Patanjali and goes back to Rig-Veda’. This is
used by All the Acharyas, of course with their own judgement.



A) On \< the paper of this topic concerns itself only with meanings that are present in Rigveda ; …. This is an academic exercise to see what meanings of "asura" and its derivatives can be elicited from the text of Rigveda only \> : You are making clear about the frame in which the ‘ term meaning : Asura’ is academically discussed within the ‘ predefined frame, as ‘Rigveda’. This establishes the reference point for the argument ‘ \< The Text Does Matter ’ \>. This is not the point of divergence in the understanding. It is about the Language tools used to validate the meaning and the very definition of the ‘Text’. Can a linguistically layered structure of ‘Vedic Text’ like Rigveda’ be constructed as ‘ Samhitaa – Brahmana – Aaranyaka – Upanishad’ ? And hypothesize that ‘ term-meanings change in these layers’ ? and beyond these layers ? Can a later text and construction from Gita be used to explain the meaning of a Vedic term ?



On such points, there seems to be an irreconcilable divide and ‘ Emotions-Ego Combined Wall of Separation’ between the traditional schools and post colonial modern researchers flares up in discussions. 



Instead of addressing the issues raised and pedagogy –academics , the
ego-emotions have flared on ‘ Who Speaks – Why- From where’ ! While majority of Indian traditional schools rely for the ‘Text –authenticity’ on the editions prepared by the Colonial Scholars ( with their scholarly edits; and this includes the Rigveda –Bhashya by Sayanacharya, edited by Max Muller), the next critical point on ‘ Language Tools –Pedagogy’ has not been clearly addressed. I am tempted to reproduce the bias of Max Muller in discretionary editing and printing of the Sayana Bhashya, which probably has been overlooked ( / pushed below the carpet-? ) by the ‘ traditional scholars’ for over two centuries! The net outcome being : The available ‘text’ and ‘ Meanings associated with the terms there in’ carry an indelible, inseparable color coating through the commentaries. See Max Mullers comments at <https://archieve.org/stream/rigvedasanhitasa06kenn#page/n37/mode/2up/search/Sayana>





This is where the ‘ Ekavakayataa – Ekarthataa ’ of commentators constructions play a significant authoritative role in facilitating the ‘Text Study’ ( if not for the judgement).



The colonial scholars usage of Samskrutha Language Tools to understand Vedas , in this sense, is totally different from the way the traditional schools and commentators work with. Coming to the specific, the current discussion, the word ‘asuryaa’ from the text ‘ Ishaavasya upanishad’ would have to be bounded by the meaning associated to ‘ Isha’. Do we see any uniformity and concurrence on this term-meaning? Either in tradition ( Isha = Parabrahma or Ishwara or Maheswara or Purusha or
MahaVishnu Narayana) , or Colonial writings ( Isha = God - ? Spirit – Divine – Consciousness – One Principle? ?). Taking each view, for independent exploration, the meaning of the word ‘asuryaa, loka, andham tamah, Reaching such spaces and existential dimensions by the living beings violating a norm of life set for this earth and locale’ -
changes. And lo! Here is the mother seed of the opinions coming out as ‘Vedic Philosophy’. On which Ego-Emotions flare’. 





B) On \< It is not possible by means of "jugglery" to interpret any word in any way if one follows a set of rules. > : The key is \< IF ONE FOLLOWS A SET OF RULES> . Who sets and concurs these rules ? and Compliance to it ?



C) On \< The said goal might be unattainable because any natural language has multiplicity of meanings, but it shall be helpful to make the effort to come as close to the goal as the text allows. > :
Traditional schools have followed the ‘Yoga-Bhashaa’ ( = Sacred Spiritual Linguistics) approach ; Post Colonial Scholars have used Social language and Classical language approach. ‘Yoga-Samskrutham’ pedagogy and approach comes independent of these two approaches. The reconciliation between the pedagogies of Classical, Social and Culture –colored Samskruth studies is a work that needs to be done. For this work, meeting of minds and scholars is an important pre-requisite ; needing resources beyond the ‘ small workshops’ . If ‘Vedic studies have an international relevance and criticality’, then the support schemes are also to be on the same scale. The benefit of right understanding of Vedas for Indians is getting a clarity on the history and mystery of their primary resources; and for all of the world, the yoga-wisdom of Samskruth language.
