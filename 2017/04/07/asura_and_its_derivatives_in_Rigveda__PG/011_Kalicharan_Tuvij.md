Dear Dmit,

सुर, असुर are not absolutes.

> why would Adityas protect, guard their asurya? (2.27.4c)

They protect their असुर्यs in order to protect their respective भक्तs (विश्वस्य भुवनस्य गोपाः), otherwise being (absolute) सुरs would mean forfeiting (rather than merely inter-communicating) their individualities. This contradistinction is brought out in 2.27.4c.

This corresponds well with Hale (italics mine):

> An असुर seems to have been a lord or leader *(**देवता**)* **chosen** > *(worshipped)* by **his people** *(**भक्त**s)* who maintained his > authority by their continuing to support and **follow** *(as in > sects)* him.

Yet, the mechanism through which a deity gets transformed into an असुर is- by the सुरगण **forfeiting** (for a span of time and space) their असुर्यs to the deity. This is what is being described in 6.20.2 when इन्द्र tramples वृत्र down.

राक्षसs are powers that **protect** the communication portals (through which deities communicate).
