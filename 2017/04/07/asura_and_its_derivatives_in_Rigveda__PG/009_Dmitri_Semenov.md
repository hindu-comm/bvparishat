Dear Olga,  
  
I would not venture to give any opinion on Brahmarishi Mayan, but would like to mention that there is apparent shift in meaning of the word "asura" from Rigveda to later texts.  
It would be very difficult to assign anything simple and negative to asura as "demon" in Rigveda --- Indra, Agni, Soma --- are all both asuras and devas.  
More on the changes in meaning of asura in derivatives can be found, for example, in Hale's book which is available online:
