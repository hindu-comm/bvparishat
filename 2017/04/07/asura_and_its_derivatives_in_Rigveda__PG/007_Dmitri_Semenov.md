Dear Girijesh,  
  
I translate asuraghna as "slaying asuras" --- in line with basic meaning of dhatu han.  
so 7.13.1ab will be rendered as:  
  
 To Agni, all-enlightening, giving dhii-s,  
 to slaying asuras, ye do bring forth an expression of thought, a vision.  
  
It is mentioned in the paragraph you quoted in attempt to elicit how asura Agni slays other asuras. Since asuraghna and asurahaa occur only three times without direct indication how asura (either Indra or Agni) slays other asuras, one might use co-occuring characterization as a reasonable guess. In 7.13.1ab it is dhiya.mdhaa, and jyotis in 10.170.2cd while in the third case 6.22.4cd there are questions only and not a statement. Thus the guess about asura-killing weapon being dhii and jyotis or something close to these two.  
  
Best,  
 Dmitri.
