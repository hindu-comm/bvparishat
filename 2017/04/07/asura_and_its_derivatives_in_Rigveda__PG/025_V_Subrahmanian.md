Namaste

  

I am not sure if these two terms have been already discussed in the context of analyzing the term 'asura':

  

mudrārākṣasa and paiśāca. The first term is only too popular to need a reference. The second term occurs in 'Hanumatkṛta-paiśāca-bhāṣyam', an extant commentary on the Bhagavadg'itā.

  

I think the term 'rākṣasa' was mentioned in this thread in the sense of 'rakṣā', protecting. The latter term 'paiśāca' may please delineated.

  

My thinking is that these two terms too, like 'asura', need not be restricted to only negative meanings.

  

Thanks and warm regards
