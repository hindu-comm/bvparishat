In the Īśāvāsya Upaniṣat occurs this mantra:

  

असुर्या नाम ते लोका अन्धेन तमसा वृताः।  
तांस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जनाः ॥ ३ ॥  

  

There the word 'asuryāḥ' is commented upon by Shankara thus:

  

  

असुर्याःपरमात्मभावमद्वयमपेक्ष्य देवादयोऽप्यसुराः। तेषां च स्वभूता लोकाअसुर्याःनाम।  

  

This appears to be in tune with the explanation: asuṣu ramante...those who revel in objects of the sense organs. Thereby, even the gods, etc. (who revel in sense objects in svarga) are also asu-rāḥ. The purport is: the Supreme Brahman which according to Shankara's advaita does not afford any sense of duality of enjoyer-enjoyed, alone is free of the nature of asu-ra - asuṣu ramaṇam. All other states are never free of experiencer-experienced and hence 'asu-ra' states only.

  

It is also to be noted that all 'asu-ra' is productive of sin. For example, the deva-s who have landed in svarga, have gone there only by action that is known as 'puṇya prada'. They have not committed sinful actions and landed in svarga. Hence their svarga bhoga is not a result of pāpa. Yet, since there is the involvement of experiencing sense objects through sense organs, the term 'asu-ra' applies to them as well. That is the purport.
