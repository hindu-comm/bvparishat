Namaste Dmitri



(Pardon me for a little extended response, (partly emotional outpour) which I believe is needed to clarify the issue raised by you.

 To call the Kings new clothes for what they are, one needs to provide a little plain talk). 



1. Thanks for acknowledging the current scenario and course correction needed on ‘ Understanding the Rule based frame work in interpreting terms in Veda: \< It would be good to have an accepted set of such rules, **but since none widely used exists, every researcher seems to abide by his/her own set, which is unfortunate**. > .



 The Shadanga Vedanga Paddahti was the widely used set of rules and standard, to study and practice Vedas; still a live tradition in some parts of India , albeit ‘ gasping for last breath’ due to the ‘ academic onslaught on native Vedic traditions and challenges of scholars livelihood’. Government exchequer has no priority to spend the ‘ public tax resources’ to save this ‘ last vestiges of a bygone era, if it does not usher in the power and meet the political agendas. 



**2A)** On \< "yogaaartha approach to decode Samskruth term meanings"
> I am finalizing my research writing to a publication and workshops. It is primarily a voyage of discovery on how ‘ Indian Traditions
studied – taught –understood - used and applied ‘Vedas’ in two / multiple streams, all coming under one main umbrella name as ‘Vyasa Tradition’ . 



 This system, known as ‘Shadanga Vedanga’ pedagogy ( unified Sacred Linguistic tradition to study and apply Vedas for Human welfare, the main utility function of Vedas ’) was the ‘ **immune system’** which guarded Vedas. The metaphor well known on this reads ‘ Chandah padau tu vedasya…’. 



**2B)** \< Yogaartha approach to decode Samskrutham \> is both a discovery and an effort for reconstruction of Vedic tradition, anchoring the details provided by Patanajli in Mahabhashya and Yaska in Nirukta; combining it with the Vedic textual clues on ‘Vak’ and its yoga. This is the foundation of ‘Shadanga Vedanga sampradaya’, which currently seems to suffer **multiple sclerosis** in India as well as ‘Academics of Orient, Far Eastern studies and Sanskrit’. In traditional terms, this means there is a ‘ vi-pra-yukta-taa ( as the opposite of Sam-prukta, the word from Kalidasa: Vagarthaviva Sampruktau) . The Yoga pedagogy needed to understand Samskrutham and ‘Vedic Terms’ is broken distorted, diluted, displaced, substituted and damaged.





**2C)** The colonial model of Vedic studies as ‘religion of a historic period, using the lens of Abrahamic Theology, Evangelical motivation, use of inappropriate language modeling and tools of Greco-Latin languages, the design and desire to beat down the ‘ Arya- Thought ( politically and strategically) – All this combined with the
might of empire, empowered the scholars of west to push their aggression on ‘ Vedic pundits’ to inflict the multiple sclerosis on Veda- Pedagogy and Practice. The echoing of west as ‘Oriental thought still has a greater momentum in Post Independence India Vedic and Samskruth studies. 



 The net result is **\< the ‘Vedic messages’ encoded in the Rigveda-Mantra –Sukta - Terms are not being properly transmitted
across generations \> . On the contrary, they are being ‘ post-mortem analyzed using incompatible language analytics and tools. This is the deep rooted hermeneutic error, which seems to have been pushed below the carpet in Vedic studies; and over coated with the statement that ‘Academics engages only with history and not the mystic dimension of language! ‘ For a list of diverse types of hermeneutic errors (given in the Biblical studies context; but extendable to Vedic studies with same tenor, please see:
<http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~tim/study/HermeneuticalErrors.pdf> )**

****

** It is an internal break down in post colonial period and aggravated by the social dynamics and new order of society, which can ‘read Vedas only through translation, as a religion document of a historic society, sacerdotal in belief and migrating to India’. **



**2D) How then to reconstruct the Shadanga Vedanga Paddahti ? **The **Vyasa Sampradaya** of Vedartha –Tatparya Nirnaya comes in multiple streams, and all these need to be unified (Yukta/ Yoga) to understand :
The traditional streams are : (a) Poorvameemaamsaa ( called the **Karma Kanda**, by Jaimini, the disciple of Vyasa ) (b) Uttarameemaamsaa (called the **Brahma Kanda**, by Vyasa, associated with Brahma Sutra / Vedanta Darshana / Shaareeraka meemaamsaa sampradaya) (c) Other Rishi Sampradayas which are associated with the Applications of Veda in four streams of Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharva veda and Vastu Veda , where each ‘ Applied Veda Tradition is a school of Rishi’s . For example- Ayurveda has multiple rishis and Devatas starting with Dhanvantari, Bharatas Natya shastra is a social model of Vedic Yajnas. The 64 vidyas and Kalas, the plurality of works on Tantra, Puranas, Aagama, Dharma Shaastras are documents which have deep intertwined structure and purpose. Same is the case with Ramayana and Mahabharata, which have a plurality of narrations by purpose and audience. They are not just stories told to different audience of different societies. 



**2E)** All these works have used totally , mainly or largely ‘ **Samskrutham**’ as the Language of the Text ( whether conforming to Panini – Or other wise; whether they use the ‘Vedas’ fully or in part.)
**to present different facets of Yoga as ‘Anu-shaasanam’** = custom prescription for specific needs and contexts. Example: The same word like Purusha –Prakruti, Deva –Asura give a plurality of meanings in different texts and contexts, because the ‘YOGA- APPLICATION and UTILITY ( = Prayoga –Vini-yoga) of Vak ( Articulated Text) is different.



 This intricacy and integrity of Text gets violated in the Translations and inappropriate’ Language pedagogic models used for Samskruth studies’.



 What does it matter if Samskruth has no historicity, but just written yesterday as a ‘Research work, Finding out the rule base of the language that runs across texts of several millennia? Does it impact the standard and quality of Language ? Absolutely Not ! The challenge here is understanding the Time-Transparency and Time-Transcendent nature of Samskrutham, bestowed through the Yoga –processes given in Vyakarana (as Vedanga); making the Langauge to become ‘ Mantra ( by efficacy and not limited to belief). On the same count, if Panini organized a language tradition of texts prior to him and later writers took pride in following it, what is wrong ? This ‘ Language Standard Continuity’ was ‘doubted - disbelieved’ and displaced by post colonial period scholars in Vedic studies. This forking point is the hard line of divide in formulating the study of Samskrutham, as it ought to be called ( See MW
dictionary Notes in Introduction) which has been made to take the new shape as ‘Sanskrit’, a classical / dead /dying language! 



 I have used the word ‘ Multiple sclerosis’, which is a medical term, and may need an explanation for general readers. I am concluding this response with the explanation of this term.



**What is Multiple Sclerosis?**
(<http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Definition-of-MS> ) Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves an immune-mediated process in which an abnormal response of the body’s immune system is directed against the central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The exact antigen — or target that the immune cells are sensitized to attack — remains unknown, which is why MS is considered by many experts to be "immune-mediated" rather than "autoimmune."

Within the CNS, the immune system attacks myelin — the fatty substance that surrounds and insulates the nerve fibers — as well as the nerve fibers themselves.

The damaged myelin forms scar tissue (sclerosis), which gives the disease its name.

When any part of the myelin sheath or nerve fiber is damaged or destroyed, nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain and spinal cord are distorted or interrupted, producing a wide variety of symptoms.

The disease is thought to be triggered in a genetically susceptible individual by a combination of one or more environmental factors.

People with MS typically experience one of four disease courses, which can be mild, moderate or severe.



**Effect of Multiple sclerosis?**
(<http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37556.php>) Also known as MS, is a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system, (brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves). In severe cases, the patient becomes paralyzed or blind while in milder cases, there may be numbness in the limbs. The cause of MS is unknown; however, with multiple sclerosis, the central nervous system (CNS) is attacked by the individual's own immune system. That is why MS is believed to be an autoimmune disease. Nerve fibers are surrounded by myelin, which protects them. Myelin also helps the nerves conduct electrical signals quickly and efficiently. The myelin of a patient with MS disappears in multiple areas. This leaves a scar (sclerosis). Multiple sclerosis means "scar tissue in multiple areas." The areas where there is either not enough or no myelin are called plaques or lesions. As the lesions get worse, the nerve fiber can break or become damaged. When a nerve fiber has less myelin, the electrical impulses received from the brain do not flow smoothly to the target nerve - when there is no myelin, the nerve fibers cannot conduct the electrical impulses at all. **Because of this, the messages from the brain to the muscles cannot be transmitted.**
