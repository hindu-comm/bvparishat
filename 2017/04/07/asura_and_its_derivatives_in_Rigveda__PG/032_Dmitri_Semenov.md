Dear V Subrahmanian,  
  
Thank you for the explanation.  
  
asura = one who revels in indriya viśaya.  
asuratva = asuśu (asuviṣayeṣu) ramaṇatvam.

  
  
I am puzzled: how Soma or Agni can revel in indriya viśaya?  

Is there in post-Rigveda texts/traditions an explanation or some hints how that could be?  
Or, for Soma and Agni asura has somewhat different meaning?  
  
Best,  
 Dmitri.
