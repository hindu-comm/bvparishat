Hi Dmitri

  

Excellent analysis. I wish there was a way to conclude it.

I like the way you describe Deva and Asura as 'one' in an inconceivable dimensional world.

Sarasvati's wrath is a clear metaphor.

While Asuras is one thing, the other is Rakshash.

  

'rAkshas' is a demon and 'rAksh' is protection. The root word is the same.

It is hard to comprehend a demonic idea with protection.

There will probably be a thousand explanations to it, but it is hard to convince.

  

Best

  
Dev
