Dear Dr. BVK Sastry,  
  
Are principles/explanations of "yogaaartha approach to decode Samskruth term meanings" written somewhere? I would like to know more about the approach.

  
  

\>\>B) On \< It is not possible by means of "jugglery" to interpret any word in any way if one follows a set of rules. > : The key is \< IF ONE FOLLOWS A SET OF RULES> . Who sets and concurs these rules ? and Compliance to it ?

  

Some rules are given already. For example, Yaska gave only three perspective from which Rigveda can be consistently interpreted. adhiyaj\~na, adhidaiva, adhyaatma. It means that interpreting from itihaasa perspective shall be allows for few .rk-s, thus making interpretations of asura as name of a tribe (as done, for example, by D. R. Bhandarkar in "Some Aspects of Ancient Indian Culture" (pp.32--35)) to be acceptable only if all other attempts fail.  
Some other rules can be derived from previous failed attempts, for example,  
the text of Rigveda shall not be changed in any way and shall be assumed to be correct in all ak.sara-s;  
etymology shall be used as a heuristic to arrive at a meaning, but cannot be used as a proof;  
one shall avoid assigning a meaning to a word that is used in one instance only;  
etc.  
  
It would be good to have an accepted set of such rules, but since none widely used exists, every researcher seems to abide by his/her own set, which is unfortunate.
