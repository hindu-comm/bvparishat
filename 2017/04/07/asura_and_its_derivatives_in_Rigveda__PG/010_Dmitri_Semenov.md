Dear Kalicharan,  
  
It is an interesting, though requiring new assumptions, take on the topic.  
It creates new puzzles. For example, if "asura" = an out-of-harmony frequency

And the same deity that is normally a सुर may opt to be an असुर at his/her own time and place of choosing,

why would Adityas protect, guard their asurya? (2.27.4c), why every asurya was granted by devas to Indra in order for him to kill V.rtra? (6.20.2)  

  
Best,  
 Dmit
