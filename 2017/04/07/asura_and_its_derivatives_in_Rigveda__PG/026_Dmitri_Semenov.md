Dear V Subrahmanian,  
  
What (derivational) meaning do you assign to -ra in this case? Is it particular to the case of asu-ra or can be applied to other words like adhvara, "subhra, samudra, citra, etc. ?  
  
Given Shankara's taake on asuryaa.h, what would be connected meaning for asura, asuratva?  
  
Best, Dmitri.
