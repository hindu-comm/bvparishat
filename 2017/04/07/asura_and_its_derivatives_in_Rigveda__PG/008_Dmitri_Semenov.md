Dear Dev,  
  
rak.sas is another subtle concept in Rigveda.  
First, there are ra'k.sas (for example, 9.53.1b, 9.97.10c, 7.104.13c, 9.110.12b) and  
[rak.sa](http://rak.sa)'s (for example 9.63.29a, 9.71.1b, 9.104.6b)
which seem to mean different though closely related things.  
If one considers psychological plane of interpretation (as was formulated by Shri Aurobindo) then it is possible to avoid  
apparent contradiction between the meaning "protect", "guard" of the dhatu rak.s and quite negative connotations of both ra'k.sas and [rak.sa](http://rak.sa)'s  
by giving core meaning different from "demon" but having "demon" sense as an external projection of the psychological meaning.  
  
But this topic is outside of the scope the asura paper.  
  
Best,  
 Dmitri.
