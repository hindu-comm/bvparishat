Dear Dr. BVK Sastry,  
  
Thank you for such long and erudite post.  
Many issues you brought up are expanding greatly the scope of the present topic, so I will not touch upon them for lack of knowledge on my part,  
but will follow the discussion with great interest.  
  
Several concrete points:

  
1. You wrote:  
  
B) On \< Dmitri Semenov : Sri Madhvacharya in his Bhashya gives two meanings to the word asurya loka as \> : What is wrong in Acharya giving two ‘Valid, grammatically justifiable, contextually interpreted
meanings’ to the term? Many Samskruth terms , as in all world languages, carry a plurality of meaning association, from which the contextual selection is made for interpretation ?  

------------------------------  
  
I didn't bring up "Sri Madhvacharya in his Bhashya gives two meanings to the word asurya loka as..." --- that was a point made by Subodh Bhat.  
As you pointed out "Many Samskruth terms , as in all world languages,
carry a plurality of meaning association." --- the paper of this topic concerns itself only with meanings that are present in Rigveda.  
  
2. When you say, "As an academic exercise,..", I totally agree.  
 This is an academic exercise to see what meanings of "asura" and its derivatives can be elicited from the text of Rigveda only.  
  
3. There is, however, one point on which I strongly disagree:

  
  
"This jugglery can be done to interpret any word in any way ( sarve shabdaah sarva-artha vaachakaah) using the ‘ varna-maalaa’ !"  
  

It is not possible by means of "jugglery" to interpret any word in any way if one follows a set of rules.  
The said jugglery might be possible if a word occurs very few times, or if one assumes a license to assign as many meanings to a word as desired.  
If there are 100+ occurrences in a variety of contexts in such corpus as Rigveda then the text itself imposes a lot of constraints on possible word meanings.  
**The text does matter.** If one comes up with a novel meaning of, say, "asura", it might be easy to pluck out of the corpus supporting statements and ignore contradicting statements.  
That's where the principle that you formulated (if I understood you correctly) as achieving 'the goal Eka Vakayataa – Ekaarthataa’ helps by raising  
the important question "How many of all occurrences does this meaning fits?".  
The said goal might be unattainable because any natural language has multiplicity of meanings, but it shall be helpful to make the effort to come as close to the goal as the text allows.  
If one attempts to get to \>90-95% of cases, the said "jugglery" becomes very difficult indeed.  
The presented paper is an exercise in finding out what constraints on "asura" and its derivatives are imposed by the text of Rigveda,  
and proposes a meaning that fits more than 90% of occurrences. Nothing more. Could there be other meanings that fit?  
Most probably, yes.  
  
Best,  
 Dmitri.
