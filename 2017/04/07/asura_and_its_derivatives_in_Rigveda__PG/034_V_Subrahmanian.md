They are deva-s and hence being in svarga entails reveling in sense objects, bhoga/bhogya vastus.

I would not say the Upanishads to be post-Rgveda for that is not the traditional view. In the Br.upanishad we have the episode of Brahmā giving the advice of 'Da' commonly to all his three offsprings: humans, deva-s and asura-s. The three take the advice respectively as applicable thus: 

  

Humans: because of their greed to earn and hoard money, the advice 'Da' is: datta: give away money in charity.

  

Deva-s: because they are given to excessive indulgence in sense objects, the advice 'Da' will be: dāmyata: exercise self-control.

  

asura-s: since they are by nature cruel to others, the advice 'Da' will mean for them: dayadhvam: be compassionate.

  

So, here we have the Upaishad admitting that the deva-s (like agni, soma) being indulgent.

  

There are many other statements to substantiate this.
