Dear Dmitri,  

Namaste  
  

A very good flow and simple detailed explanations are praiseworthy. I liked your approach very much. Only one point I wish to raise is regarding असुरघ्न asuraghna. -ghna is used for destroying, killing, have a look at हन्, हंति -hna, hanti etc. That meaning is not clear in this passage:  
  

*'an ́asura provides guidance not with clues, hints, obscurations or commands but through framing*

*perception, cognition and physiological processes with integral, vision-like suggestions (A4, A5, Y6,*

*Y9, 7.13.1ab where Agn ́ı characteristics dhiyam.dh ̄a and asuraghna are given next to each other) or*

*through changed state of mind/body (“the fence of Savit ́r.” in 4.53.1);'*  
Can you elaborate further. Since I have copied and pasted, the diacritical marks are misplaced. Please forgive for that.  
  

Best Regards,  

Girijesh
