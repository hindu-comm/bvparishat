नमस्ते,

  

This is in reply to multiple questions raised on the असुर = “An out-of-harmony frequency” etymology.

Yes I do believe this meaning is entirely consistent (across the breadth of श्रुति, शास्त्र and history); though the deeper point raised by आप्त Dr Sastry is regarding the consistency (एकवाक्यता) – or the prerequisite of it – of Veda itself.

My submission is: the Veda is not only consistent but also “vastly superior” in terms of information density.

The question is: how do Indian scholars from diverse backgrounds and sects go about fruitfully discussing शास्त्र matters with each other? “How do the असुरs teach themselves to communicate with each other like सुरs?”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  

  

Not long ago in BVP I had discussed the परिमाण rule:

**one** **शब्द** **of Veda = one** **वाक्य** **of Upanishat = one** **आख्यान** **of Itihas**

(No one raised an objection to this rule then and there; and this is not the thread for it – anyone is free to start a separate thread.)

  

In the present context:

A word, e.g., असुर cannot be weighed directly against the word असुर occurring in Upanishats or directly against the word असुर occurring in Puranas/ Itihas-s. Transformations have to be applied first.

  

This transformation is necessary not because of any historicity involved, but because the परिमाण is **on purpose** designed to be-

at word level in Veda, at sentence level in Upanishat, and at paragraph level in Itihas.

  

Understanding this simple fact, and we have -

Bali (in Ramayana) was an असुर (not असुर deity), Prahlada was a दस्यु, Ravana a राक्षस – if the words be taken at Vedic परिमाण.

  

And there are many पुरुष deities apart from Shri Vishnu. Shri Agni is one, for example, and a Vedic reference quoted earlier in this thread describes how he – being the composite that he is – is the source of असुर्यत्वs of many other non-पुरुष deities. Lord Prajapati is another पुरुष deity and another reference in this thread describes him possessing of असुरs as well as others.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  

  

The etymology:

The (उ, फ, व) – relationship is entirely based on the consistency of Sanskrit sounds – as discussed in my thread “The specifics of Sanskrit Varnamala” in BVP. Any questions should be directed to that particular thread (or a new thread).

Therein I broadly supported Dr Joshi’s Varnavaada approach, and tried to show how indeed Sanskrit words at शब्द level bear a strong relationship to its constituent अक्षरs. (but need further transformations at वाक्य and आख्यान levels)

  

This means असुर can be arrived at from सुर or असु or सु and so on.

e.g., असु = असुर minus र

Now, the deity behind र is Lord Indra (knowledge based on योग), and र most often at mundane level translates as: “personality”. That is, असु is “असुर minus personality”, i.e. a “discordant vibration without a personality”. So असु can mean प्राण without any reference to a person that inhabits it (or that the person is already deceased).

  

I stop here, but not without stating that a proper understanding of असुर can cast lights on very important epochs of Indian and the world history – and the ongoing deep influences thereof in the world of today.
