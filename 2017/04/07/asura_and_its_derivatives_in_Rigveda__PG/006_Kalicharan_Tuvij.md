नमस्ते,

  

सुर is the keyword here. If the close relationship between (उ, फ, and व) is acknowledged, we can compare the meanings of the following words:

स्वर = vowel, musical note, etc

स्फुर = vibration, etc

  

So, सुर then technically mean: “A harmonious (musical) frequency (vibration)”

A deity (“a frequency of the universe” of sorts) is, therefore, called a सुर if the deity is in harmony (or, in communication) with other deities. सुर word implies the pre-existence of सुरगण.

  

असुर, irrespective of whether it came before सुर or not, then means:

“An out-of-harmony frequency”

The असुर foreshadows everything else. The same deity that is normally a सुर may opt to be an असुर at his/her own time and place of choosing (mostly to the benefit of the भक्त).

  

Please note that सुर, असुर are not restricted to deities, and an असुर deity is still different from a पुरुष deity (that is technically a composite deity).
