Hello Dev and Dmitri!

I was always curios about Brahmarishi Mayan. It is mentioned in Surya Siddhanta that he was Asura. But I was told by several scholars that it is a mistake to conclude that Mayan was asura. So who was Mayan? Asura or divine builder or both? Is in this situation asura has a negative meaning (asura - demon) or not? I see that Dmitri was researching term "asura" and looks like it is not that simple "asura - demon" but term "asura" has a positive meaning.

  

I would appreciate the response and your opinion.

  

Very sincerely,
