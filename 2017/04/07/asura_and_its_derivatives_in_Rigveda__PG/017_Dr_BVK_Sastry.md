Namaste



Ishavasya Upanishad is an integral part of Shukla Yajur Veda - Vajasaneyi Madhyandina – Shakkhaa. Why expect, seek or force the Rig-Veda ‘ Samhitaa (Mantra) portion used term and meanings , context on the Shukla Yajur Veda - Vajasaneyi Madhyandina – Shakkhaa text and context ?



This is a self introspection question. This needs attention before sitting on purpose of talking judgmental, making comparison, evaluation and remarking judgment over the text- interpretations of different periods and the effort of ‘ long gone authors and commentators’, and the propriety of the same.



In this background,



A) On \< Dmitri Semenov: Meanings given by Sri Madhvacharya seem to be difficult to apply to Rigveda. \> : Respecting Academic freedom and Free thinking of Scholars, the remark is an expectation out of bound and ‘good pedagogy’. 



B) On \< Dmitri Semenov : Sri Madhvacharya in his Bhashya gives two meanings to the word asurya loka as \> : What is wrong in Acharya giving two ‘Valid, grammatically justifiable, contextually interpreted meanings’ to the term? Many Samskruth terms , as in all world languages, carry a plurality of meaning association, from which the contextual selection is made for interpretation ?



Which one of the ‘ Indian Native Traditional Teachers taught this kind of approach to engage ‘Vedartha – Upansiaht Bhashyaartha’ studies? To the serious and sincere scholars of west ? 



***My Notes Shared***: While other threads are hot on ‘ Discovering Bharateeyataaa’ and infusing it in to ‘ Indian Universities’, here is a classic example on what needs to be done as a ‘ prior home work’ to rectify the fragmented thinking on ‘Vedartha Chintana’ in relation to ‘ Bharateeya Tattva Shaastra Vichara Vimarsha’.



Here is the specific case on how one ‘ looks and overlooks’ the basic tenets of understanding and interpreting the (i) Language terms of the text (ii) Context (iii) linguistic processes and (iv) forces the text interpretation using language tools to suit the predefined stands of philosophy at a later period.



I do not say that is wrong ! As an academic exercise, it is good ( like Closed door Gymnastics before the Competition and show down).



This kind of discussion rests on use of texts –transaltion resources –teachings which come in (i) a historically framed, perspective and
presentation without recourse to the PRACTICE (ii) a contemporary re-narration of the ancient text ( believed to be Time-Transcendent) made by a historical persona of Great repute and Master of Tradition , whose purpose was to present and align the Universal thinking to the
needs of contemporary society and context. That is the greatness of Acharyas who picked the Veda Vyasa Chintana in writing the commentaries
in three different periods . This is totally different from the ‘class room centric cerebral churnings of Veda – Upanishad as Philosophies Views for personal likes and dislikes’.



**In this post** : According to traditional schools, Vedas are ‘ Darshana’ :: Time Transcendent; At least some five millennium separated from Acharyas time. Rushi’s of Vedas have no compulsion to make ‘ Philosophical alignment ( eka – Vaakayataa / Eka Sutrataa intra Vedas( as ‘ samhita –brahmana- aaranyaka- Upanishad), Across the Vedas ( as Trayee ) , Across different texts of Prasthana Traya ( Upanishads, Gita, Brahma Sutra) ; Even less compulsion on Veda re-narratives as
Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana, Bhagavata, ); This self- imposed conditionality for ‘Vedartha Chintana’ is from later commentators
and Acharyas. So they do resort to the Language Tools to achieve their goals. This presents a scenario of language tools application differently to achieve the desired goal of ‘Eka Vakayataa – Ekaarthataa’. Why is this such a criticality ? This is for ‘Sanatana Dharma Samagra chintana and Abhyasa’ :: Swa-Dharma –Swa Karma goals. 



- For Traditionalists : The Language of Vedas is ‘Darshana’ – Ateendriya – Alaukika – Apaurusheya’ :: In simple terms, not bound by history and society constraints. Then what one understands in such a ‘ document’ is ones ‘ Vision –interpretation’. Different Acharyas – Different Interpretation.

- For Indologists : The text is a multi-layered ‘out of India, Tribal literature’ from which Philosophy is forcibly drawn

- For Shaastra scholars, the Language Tool is ‘ Panini; the guideline is Vednata by their Acharya ; Even if this constraint means violation of the Shadnaga Veda chintana + Veda –Vishishta Pada- Prayoga chintana + Vioaltion of Nirukta guidelines !

- For Translators, the authority is colonial writers who use the ‘ Latin –Greek Classical language standards



Coming to ‘ Novel Interpretations presented as ‘ Alternative’ : This jugglery can be done to interpret any word in any way ( sarve shabdaah sarva-artha vaachakaah) using the ‘ varna-maalaa’ ! So, how would Vaishnavas explain ‘ Bali, Vibheeshana , Prahlada’ as ‘ Asura –Deities’ worshipping ‘ Parama- Purusha deity Narayana) and how would they differ from the Saivite (rudramasha ) deities like ‘ Baana, Ravana’ ? who were killed by ‘ Parama- Purusha deity Narayana in Avataras ? OR accommodating ‘ Buddhavataara Hari’ as ‘ Purusha Devataa :: Human Deity ? Therefore, one needs to present a consistent ‘Shaastra –Pramana’ before making such ‘ imagined Alternatives of Conveniences in explaining the Language Terms’. The criticality of ‘Yoga –Approach to understand Samskruth Terms’ may be explored here.
(The extract below is from Kalicharan Tuvvi: )

 सुर is the keyword here. If the close relationship between (उ, फ, and व) is acknowledged, we can compare the meanings of the following words:स्वर = vowel, musical note, etc

स्फुर = vibration, etc . So, सुर then technically mean: “A harmonious (musical) frequency (vibration)”. A deity (“a frequency of the universe” of sorts) is, therefore, called a सुर if the deity is in harmony (or, in communication) with other deities. सुर word implies the pre-existence of सुरगण. असुर, irrespective of whether it came before सुर or not, then means: “An out-of-harmony frequency” The असुर foreshadows everything else. The same deity that is normally a सुर may opt to be an असुर at his/her own time and place of choosing (mostly to the benefit of the भक्त). Please note that सुर, असुर are not restricted to deities, and an असुर deity is still different from a पुरुष deity (that is technically a composite deity).



Look forward for learned scholars to help in resolving these issues, discussed repeatedly in this and many other forums.
