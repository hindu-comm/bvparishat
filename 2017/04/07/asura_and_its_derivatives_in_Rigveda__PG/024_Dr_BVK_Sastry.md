Namaste



1. Too many issues with pretzel-noodle constructions in the response and pointers to multiple directions ! 



2. The net outcome from this series of posts is the need to revisit the basic issue, without Ego-Emotions flares, which may be stated as a
Summing up- Summary Thematic problem:

 As on date, Do we have a stock on Theories and Resources used /useful to understand the Meaning and Purpose of Vedic Terms, Texts and Constructions ?

 Stated in Samskrutham: Veda –Shabdaanaam Artha -
Tatpraya- **Viniyoga** Vishaye sama-kaaleena- sthiti-gati –Jijnyasa

 

**One thing I am clear is the following**: The Yoga approach to decode Samskrutha Shabdaartha ( Vak-Yoga-Samskrutha Paddhati) with its
continuity of roots in Patanajli, Yaska as Shadanga Vedanga Adhyayana paddahti, a pedagogy used by Sayana for explaining Karma Kanda Veda viniyoga for yaajnika professionals / a pedagogy used by Acharya Madhva for explaining the ‘ Mantra – Yoga –Vedanta for Bhagavad-Bhakti yoga corrections in society, went underground in India, at least a century before the colonial scholars started the Vedic texts translation and Sanskrit -Bible project in India. Without an understanding of these language resources, and other wise motivated colonial scholars used the Abrahamic Religion model, language tools of Classical Latin and Greek with constructs drawn from Western Theocracy- Philosophy
framework to construct ‘Hinduism out of Vedas ( Sanatana Dharma resources). This loss of Yoga-Samskrutham from Vedas and substitution of it by ‘Sanskrit –Classical language model’ is at the root of the current academic challenge in explaining Vedas and terms of Veda. 



My good friend Dr. Yadu has been right in focusing on the ‘Viniyoga’ – Application Benefit – Utility function issue, which in traditional parlance is called ‘ Prayoga- Prayojana’.

Dr. Joshi is consistently pushing the issue of Varna-Vada and history of Mahabharath beyond India, which has a bearing on the ‘asura –rule and rulers’. 



3 ***Reasoning for this*** : 

 Kalicharan Tuvi’s post refers to many issues:

**(A-1)** Any proposed etymology for a given word needs to find evidence for consistency ( if not continuity) across a plurality of disciplines. Am I to understand the proposed model of etymology has been tested across a wide range of texts \< श्रुति, शास्त्र and history \> for consistency and continuity ? OR is this one more ‘ Vaada / Mata’ on ‘ Shabda-Artha – Taatparya Nirnaya –paddhati’ ? 

**(A-2)** On \< “How do the असुरs teach themselves to communicate with each other like सुरs?” > Reframe the question and take it back to early resources : How did the Vedic Teacher (Prajapati) teach the same ‘Veda’ to Devas and Asuras ( Indra and Virochana) ? How did Hanuman see ‘ Veda chanting Asuras at Lanka ? And what was the common need for devas and asuras to learn the same discipline from the common tradition, to fight against each other ? What was the source method before the \< intra-group learning custom pedagogy? ? Did Asuras introduce the passages that denigrated their own tradition and defeat ? OR Deva’s played a trick here ? , Granted that some how it happened, what compelled Maharshi Vyasa to put all these as ‘ compiled document for future generations welfare ?? A biographical instinct OR
wisdom of Vedas for Welfare of World ? This is the challenge that
Historic approach to Veda has not answered so far ! 

**(A-3)** The same deliberation needs to be done on \< परिमाण rule:
**one** **शब्द of Veda = one वाक्य of Upanishat = one आख्यान of Itihas** \> . IF it is considered that this is a derivative of the Jaimini Sutra guidance on ‘ Sameness of meaning for Vedic words, as used in the world’, then there is some thing seriously wrong in understanding the ‘ Karma-Kanda Paddhati’ and further linking this to ‘ Uttara –meemaamsaa :: Vedanta traditions / which come with Acharya flavors. If one needs to go by your ‘ Parimana’ approach for word meanings, either Nirukta sampradaya is to be compromised ( which is violation of Shadanga approach, proposing a multiplanar meaning approach ; derivation from Trivrut karana guidance/ Kosha samkramana approach of Upanishads; and Acharya Madhva presents this multiplanar approach of ‘ parama mukhya vrutti ) ; OR ‘ meemaamsaa – Karma Kanda practicals are to be compromised ( which says use the mantra with the sound similarity ( like Sham-No) for yajna related to Shani Graha, even if the mantra meaning is totally different; the primacy being the sound-structure similarity of Vedic word needed for Prayoga; the key is Vedic word as Mantra for efficiency of materialization and results).

**(A-4)** On what is this special distinction between Vaishnava and Saiva Asuras \< Bali (in Ramayana) was an असुर (not असुर deity), Prahlada was a दस्यु, Ravana a राक्षस – if the words be taken at Vedic परिमाण \> ? Is this the deep rooted colonial error of understanding Vedas as ‘ Hinduism boxed in Saiva- Vaishnava –Shakata devotion Religion model ? 

**(A-4)** On \< The (उ, फ, व) – relationship is entirely based on the consistency of Sanskrit sounds – as discussed in my thread “The specifics of Sanskrit Varnamala” in BVP. …..Therein I broadly supported Dr Joshi’s Varnavaada approach….. Sanskrit words at शब्द level bear a strong relationship to its constituent अक्षरs. (**but need further transformations at **वाक्य **and **आख्यान **levels**) > Joshis Varna Vada, The specifics of Sanskrit Varna-maalaa’, I am aware of the key issues. This issue can be taken up separately ! It is too slippery a ground to address here !

**(A-5)** If you think that \< असुर can be arrived at from सुर or असु or सु **and so on**. > what is this \<so – on?? \> What prevents any one from splitting the word as \< as- ura> and take the meaning of ‘ura’- as chest and make their own theories ! The logic coming out as
‘ Heart is the place where meditation is conducted and prana is present…?? How does one decide what is the key word ? using what - Mayrhofer-KEWA1-(A-Th)-1956.pdf in German OR Nirukta Or your new theory ? … On the same breath how does one separate the ‘ Ghost Word / Ghost Varna- Akshara in texts like ‘ tesurAh,helayO helayo..’ \< So it's asu-ra, and not a-sura.So sura is not the keyword, it's a ghost-word, that's how I see it. \>



I look forward for scholars inputs on the above points. It is sure easy to ask a question OR even say ‘ Only this way’. That is not answering the ‘ Why so’ ? questions, or, Why this way and not the other way’ ? It takes time and studies to grasp the vastness of implications and passing of inheritance to next generation for ‘ Veda based Identity –practices’.

नमस्ते,

This is in reply to multiple questions raised on the असुर = “An out-of-harmony frequency” etymology.

Yes I do believe this meaning is entirely consistent (across the breadth of श्रुति, शास्त्र and history); though the deeper point raised by आप्त Dr Sastry is regarding the consistency (एकवाक्यता) – or the prerequisite of it – of Veda itself.

My submission is: the Veda is not only consistent but also “vastly superior” in terms of information density.

The question is: how do Indian scholars from diverse backgrounds and sects go about fruitfully discussing शास्त्र matters with each other? “How do the असुरs teach themselves to communicate with each other like सुरs?”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



Not long ago in BVP I had discussed the परिमाण rule:

**one शब्द of Veda = one वाक्य of Upanishat = one आख्यान of Itihas
**(No one raised an objection to this rule then and there; and this is not the thread for it – anyone is free to start a separate thread.)

In the present context:

A word, e.g., असुर cannot be weighed directly against the word असुर occurring in Upanishats or directly against the word असुर occurring in Puranas/ Itihas-s. Transformations have to be applied first.

This transformation is necessary not because of any historicity involved, but because the परिमाण is **on purpose** designed to be-

at word level in Veda, at sentence level in Upanishat, and at paragraph level in Itihas.



Understanding this simple fact, and we have -

Bali (in Ramayana) was an असुर (not असुर deity), Prahlada was a दस्यु, Ravana a राक्षस – if the words be taken at Vedic परिमाण.

And there are many पुरुष deities apart from Shri Vishnu. Shri Agni is one, for example, and a Vedic reference quoted earlier in this thread describes how he – being the composite that he is – is the source of असुर्यत्वs of many other non-पुरुष deities. Lord Prajapati is another पुरुष deity and another reference in this thread describes him possessing of असुरs as well as others.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The etymology:

The (उ, फ, व) – relationship is entirely based on the consistency of Sanskrit sounds – as discussed in my thread “The specifics of Sanskrit Varnamala” in BVP. Any questions should be directed to that particular thread (or a new thread).

Therein I broadly supported Dr Joshi’s Varnavaada approach, and tried to show how indeed Sanskrit words at शब्द level bear a strong relationship to its constituent अक्षरs. (but need further transformations at वाक्य and आख्यान levels). This means असुर can be arrived at from सुर or असु or सु and so on.

e.g., असु = असुर minus र

Now, the deity behind र is Lord Indra (knowledge based on योग), and र most often at mundane level translates as: “personality”. That is, असु is “असुर minus personality”, i.e. a “discordant vibration without a personality”. So असु can mean प्राण without any reference to a person that inhabits it (or that the person is already deceased).

I stop here, but not without stating that a proper understanding of असुर can cast lights on very important epochs of Indian and the world history – and the ongoing deep influences thereof in the world of today.
