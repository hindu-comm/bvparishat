Thank you Dr. Narayan Joshi. You will not miss me on the BVP. Freed from my administrative and regular teaching duties, I hope to devote more time and energy to completing several of my unfinished research projects. We are beginning just another journey in life. 50 years ago, I traveled from Cochin to New York on a cargo ship named Jaladuta. From snowy Michigan to sunny California will hopefully be a much easier journey, and our grand-children are waiting for us at the other end. I plan on remaining connected to Stanford and Berkeley, and also to Samskrita Bharati in San Jose, where my grandsons are enjoying their Sanskrit classes. With best wishes,
