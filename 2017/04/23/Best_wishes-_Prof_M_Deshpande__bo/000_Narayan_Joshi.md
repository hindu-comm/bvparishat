Prof M Deshpande,

  

We're really going to miss you! Hope you'll enjoy every minute of your retirement. Best wishes!

I would like to add that I enjoyed reading your research papers.

We hope that you will keep enlighten us from time to time on BVP whenever you can. Wishing you and your family the best, sincerely yours, N.R.Joshi
