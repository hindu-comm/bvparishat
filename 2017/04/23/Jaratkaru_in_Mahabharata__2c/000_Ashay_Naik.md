Respected Teachers,

  

Please guide me on an issue concerning the meaning of the name of the Yayavara sage Jaratkaru in the Mahabharata.

  

1.40 of Gita Press Edition says:

  

जरेति क्षयमाहुर्वै दारुणं दारुसंज्ञितम्। शरीरं कारु तस्यासीत्तत् स धीमाञ्छनैः छनैः॥३॥

क्षपयामास तीव्रेण तपसेत्यत उच्यते। जरत्कारुरिति ब्रह्मन् वासुकेर्भगिनी तथा॥४॥

  

Hindi translation:

  

जरा कहते है क्षयको और कारु शब्द दारुणका वाचक है। पहले उनका शरीर कारु अर्थात् खूब हट्टाकठ्ठा था। उसे परम बुद्धिमान् महर्षिने धीरे धीरे तीव्र तपस्याद्वारा क्षीण बना दिया। इसलिए उनका नाम जरत्कारु पडा। वासुकिकी बहिनके भी जरत्कारु नाम पडनेका यही कारण था।

  

English translation (Bibek Debroy):

  

“Jara means decay and karu means gigantic. The sage had a gigantic body, but he decayed it slowly through severe austerities. O Brahmana! It was because of this that he was known as Jaratkaru and Vasuki’s sister had the name for similar reasons.”  

  

It is still not clear to me from the above whether he was called Jaratkaru because he had a gigantic or हट्टाकठ्ठा body or because he decayed it through austerities. The translations suggest the former but I think it is the latter i.e. because he made it दारुण that he was called जगत्कारु.

  

This is borne out by the reference in the Puranic Encylopedia of Vettum Mani (p. 348)

  

"जरा is consumption, कारु is दारुण (awful). By and by his body became hard and awful and by penance he made his body to wear out, and so he got the name जरतकारु."

  

The meaning of कारु in the verse is not clear to me. I suppose it qualifies शरीरं but I don't understand what it means to say शरीरं is कारु.

  

The correct meaning of जरत्कारु interests me because much depends on this name. This sage wants to marry a woman with the same name and it turns out that Vasuki's sister has this name.

  

But how come Vasuki's sister happen to have the same name? It is because she was जरत्कारुas well - but in what sense: because she was gigantic or because she had, like the sage, emaciated herself through austerities.

  

And when जरत्कारु the sage says that he wants to marry a woman of the same name, I assume he means that he wants to marry a woman who *is*जरत्कारु. And again I wonder, does it mean that he wants to marry a woman who is gigantic or one who has emaciated herself through austerities?

  

Regards

Ashay
