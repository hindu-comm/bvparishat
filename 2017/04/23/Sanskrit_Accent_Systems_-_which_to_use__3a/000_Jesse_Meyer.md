Hello!  
  
I'm learning Sanskrit, both as a scholar of linguistics and due to my interest in Shaivism.  
  
And I would like to ask a question about the accent system.  
  
In my textbooks I found mainly two different accent systems:  
  
The Vedic system in which the accent needs to be learned for every word. The textbook which mentions this says that it's the only system actually in use.  
  
And the Classic system in which the last long syllable of a word is stressed (except for the final syllable), or the 4th-to-last if both of the two syllables after it are short.  
  
The dictionaries I have access to don't mark accent on words, except for the "Etymologisches WÃ¶rterbuch des Altindoarischen" ('Etymological Dictionary of Old Indo-Arian') by Mayrhofer.  
And even this one only marks which syllable is accentuated, but not which accent it has (high, low or circumflex).  
  
Therefore I wonder, which system is actually used in India, especially in religious contexts, e.g. for mantras?  
Which system would you recommend me to learn?  
  
And can you recommend me any online courses or textbooks which include audio, or which at least mark which syllables to accentuate?  
  
Thank you for your help!  
  
Greetings from Germany
