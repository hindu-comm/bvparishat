This is a topic of much interest to me as well.

I've never seen or encountered such a uniform rule at all. Since much of post-vedic classical sanskrit is in metrical verse form, we find that the pronunciation happens in a way consonant with the metre. ( eg<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnsA9XWBXPI&list=PLABJEFgj0PWVXr2ERGu2xtoSXrNdBs5xS> )

Usually, the udAtta is the most important accent in a word. Given that, the other accents are readily deducible.

In case of vedic mantra-s - different for each word, as you alluded earlier.



In case of post-vedic verses -<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnsA9XWBXPI&list=PLABJEFgj0PWVXr2ERGu2xtoSXrNdBs5xS> .

The vedic one, of course. There too, my personal preference is to go for the system described by pANini in aShTAdhyAyI (rather than in the shixA shAstra-s).

I once collected all svara-s for words found in Rgveda here -<https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/stardict-sanskrit/raw/master/sa-kAvya/tars/rv-padasvara-dev__2016-02-20_16-15-38.tar.gz> because I wanted to be able to easily look up the accent while improving my speech.
