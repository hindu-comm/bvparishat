I was referring to (what seems to be) a very general rule of the thumb "last long syllable of a word is stressed (except for the final syllable), or the 4th-to-last if both of the two syllables after it are short.". It must be some modern deduction. There is some degree of uniformity in svara-s, but it is far more complicated.  
  
But there are some "rules of the thumb" on which one can mostly rely:
For example, the last suffix in any word (excluding sup and other pit suffixes) gets the highest accent. The tiNanta (declined verb) gets no accent unless it appears in the beginning of a sentence or after the usage of "yat". And so on. These can be seen from the aShTAdhyAyI.

That's true for post-vedic verses. I did not mean to imply that metric pronunciation is related to accent - as you say, accent is completely ignored in favor of melody.

If it's already available online thanks to someone else, a link would be helpful (That wouldnt be illegal).

Oh - that's not really accent, as I clarified above. Fact is that in religious contexts (that likely apply to you), a lot of what you say are post-vedic verses. Which is why I linked the above.
