It depends on the device you're using. Copying over old notes regarding this:

  



Android:

Goldendict (paid):[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.goldendict.android).

Free alternatives:

[colordict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialnmobile.colordict).

-   Cannot handle [dict.dz](http://dict.dz) files without uncompressing.
    Slightly higher rate of error reports from this app.

Goldendict free

-   The number of active dictionaries is limited to 5. Buy the paid
    version for ad-free unlimited dictionaries experience.

DictAide ([play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arjerine.dictaide&rdid=com.arjerine.dictaide))

-   Ad supported. -   Poor unicode support, rather clunky as of 2017.  

Desktop computers:[Goldendict](http://goldendict.org/download.php).

In Linux, you can do:  

-   sudo apt-get install goldendict

In mac -

use[0.8 dmg](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/goldendict/goldendict-0.8.0-macosx.dmg).

-   Note from ajita: "The one problem I have with that version is that
    if I leave it running in the background, and allow the laptop to go
    to sleep, it crashes. So, I typically exit out of goldendict once
    I'm done with it."

Use the native dictionary app after some conversion (DictUnifier) \[[BVP13](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/Dictunifier%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/oAIJWNnosh8/Idx0N9rGQVgJ)\].

  
  
PS: Installing many dicts is easy with[Stardict Dictionary Installer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sanskritcode.sanskritdictionaryupdater)on android.
