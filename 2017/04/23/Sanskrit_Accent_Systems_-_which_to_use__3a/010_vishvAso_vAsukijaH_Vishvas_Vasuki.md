Poetry (kAvya) may or may not involve meter - but I presume that you only speak of the verse form. Almost always yes, though I've heard some post-vedic but ancient pAncarAtra samhita-s which are accent based (with an extra svara at that).

Almost always, yes. Except in the case of prose-poetry (gadya-kAvya-s) involving lengthy samAsa-s and alliteration where reading aloud becomes a less determinate art.
