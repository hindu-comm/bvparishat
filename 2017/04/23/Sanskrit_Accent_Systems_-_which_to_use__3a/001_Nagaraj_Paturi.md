\>Which system would you recommend me to learn?  

  

---- Why would you learn the 'accent' in religious context?

  

Therefore I wonder, which system is actually used in India, especially in religious contexts, e.g. for mantras?  

  

When one learns mantras, one learns them along with the svara ('accent').

  

If you are learning Sanskrit, you might want to

  

1\. learn to speak

  

2\. learn to comprehend, study, analyse ancient Sanskrit texts in their written form.

  

3\. learn to read out or recite ancient Sanskrit texts in their written form.

  

4\. learn to study , comprehend, analyse mantras by going through the accentuated written forms or by hearing the recitations.

  

For #1, you need not have to learn svara('accent' ) aspects.

  

For #2 again, svara ('accent') aspects almost do not matter.

  

For #3 too svara ('accent') learning is not required. But you might want to learn how to recite verses.

  

For #4, you have to learn the svara aspects a. through a good teacher with the help of direct listening or listening audio recordings b. study svara rules from books like aṣṭādhyāyī.

  

Learning to recite mantras may not be needed by you. For several reasons of high degree of learning difficulties, it is not recommended too.
