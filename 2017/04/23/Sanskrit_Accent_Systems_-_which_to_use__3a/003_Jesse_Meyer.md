Thank you two for the replies so far!

In religious contexts it seems rather more important to use the original accent that also the text's author used.  
In mundane contexts I would just use the accent that is used my modern speakers of Sanskrit. But, while I tend to be not very dogmatic about religion, the pronunciation of such things like mantras seems to me fundamental to their cause.

Why not? I mean, I'm sure that I can make myself understood even if I stress the wrong syllables, but for what would I need correct pronunciation more than for speech?  
  
Also, when learning vocabulary I tend to not only learn the spelling of words but automatically also learn the pronunciation - and it seems counterproductive to first learn a guessed pronunciation and only later learn how it should be stressed correctly.

That's strange, I found it in two of my textbooks; the Vedic is only mentioned in one, and the other textbooks in which I looked don't mention accent at all.

I had read that the metric is, like e.g. in Latin, based on syllable length instead of stress, therefore I assumed it to be unrelated to the accent.

Sorry, I don't like uploading things due to copyright but I can tell you that it can easily be found online as a pdf.

Thanks for the information - then it's probably that one which is marked in the dictionary. I'll have to search for an explanation on these rules then.

So, the accent used is actually is still dependent on when the text was composed? Good to know.

I'll then have to see whether I can find a good summary or translated version of that then - my Sanskrit is certainly not good enough yet for reading pANini.

Thank you! That might be quite handy. However, I've never before used a dict-file, which software would you recommend? I found one named DictManager but it crashes when I try to open the dict-file with it.
