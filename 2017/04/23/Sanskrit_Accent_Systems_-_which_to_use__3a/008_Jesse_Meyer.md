You are right. Also in my own pronunciation I certainly will have influences from my native language. And I'm not striving for a completely authentic pronunciation anyway; I merely try to not use a totally wrong one.

Thank you. I tried the free Windows version of Goldendict, and it works. At least on my desktop - on the tablet, the devanagari don't get shown.  
The ' shows the high accentuated syllable, and the \_ the low one? What's with the words that have no such marks?  
I compared a bunch of words with the accents in Mayrhofer and found no relation to them - actually, all words I looked up that have an accent on one syllable in Maryhofer have a ' or \_ on a different syllable in your dictionary, or no such mark at all.  
So I couldn't yet make much sense of either.

Yes, that's what I was referring to as well. The one textbook I have which recommends the Vedic accent system also mentions this rule, saying it's a mere modern invention (and that textbook's from 1868).

Then that's what I may want to use.

Thanks for clarifying, I had misunderstood you.

I hope the admins of this forum don't mind, though...

Meaning, in post-Vedic poetry only the meter needs to be taken into account, not the actual word accent?  
  
How about post-Vedic texts not in meter? Can I expect using the Vedic accent system is reasonable for those as well?  
  
  
Thanks again for your help!
