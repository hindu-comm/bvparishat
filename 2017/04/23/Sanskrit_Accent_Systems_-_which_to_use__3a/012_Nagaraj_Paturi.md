For example, names like Madhvaachaarya are pronounced with a stress on the syllable chaa, making the pronunciation of chaarya part as relatively more prominent than the initial madhvaa. That makes the aa part of madhvaa shorter than natural in the Indian pronunciation.
Please observe this in the video shared by me of a Kannada speech by Prof. Robert Zydenbos. In that speech, there are many such examples for stress issues.
