Raviji,

  

The size of Allopanishad is not the same in different editions. In the translation of Allopanishad by Anantakrishna Sastri, there are 15 mantras while the number of Mantras in Satyarthaprakash version is only 10. Allopanishad was also printed in 'Unpublished Upanishads' published by Adyar Library, in which it is included among Sakta Upanishads and contains only 3 suktas.

  

Attaching Adyar version of Allopanishad and also a note on Allopanishad extracted from New Catalogus Catalogorum, which contains some interesting information about Allopanishad.



regards  
shankara
