I wrote three articles on the Gita a few years ago.  
Here is a link to the first.  

<https://www.dwarkamai.com/vidyapeeth/articles/90-sri-krishna-svabhava-and-svadharma>  

There are other two "Sri Krishna- Theology of the Gita" and "Sri Krishna - The Doctrine" are in the same location.  
  

There is a book for young adolescents (MIT) called Sri Krishna Yoga I compiled for our MIT monk from  

the Ramakrishna Mission. Swami Sarvagatananda passed away in 2009 at 97. The book is a Advaita  

Press publication and is possibly in print.
