Dear Sri Venkata,

  

I read the Gita press edition. I had set up the exercise to create a new translation for children.

That process is slow, I have to edit many times and make it readable. I write the essays

to clear my mind. Valmiki is a poet. A poet imagines and creates a narrative. He would

not know if someone would admire him two thousand years later. My effort is to present

an interpretation as the poet might have imagined You may read the earlier segment on

panchavati. 

  

<https://www.dwarkamai.com/vidyapeeth/articles/132-reflections-on-valmiki-ramayana-xvii-pancavati>  

  

I am attaching the Hindi version also. My student Sanjeev Tripathi helps with the

translation when he can, sometimes I do myself. 

  

Best regards,

BM
