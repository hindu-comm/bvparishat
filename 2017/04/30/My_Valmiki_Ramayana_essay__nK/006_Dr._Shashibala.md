This seems to be because of misinterpretation of the word. It does not mean monkey but one who live vana, forest.

Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

Hanuman-ji baffles not only you but also to most of the scholars too !

  

He mastered 3 vedas and 9 grammars and must be a highly learned श्रोत्रिय and शिष्ट ब्राह्मणःin that era; but; how come He is projected as monkey ----is the question

  

One reason could be that all the deities descended on earth and assumed the disguised form of 'lesser mortal' to reinforce and project theनरत्व and नायक लक्षणं of viSNu who is a completely evolved human being. What exactly was theवाल्मीकि हृदयः, to fathom this ....one.needs भावना दार्ढ्यः and उपासना.

  

Last but not the least, I love the famous advice of Parama Pujya Ramabhadracharya Ji who says :

  

"वाल्मीकि रामायण समझने के लिए एक लाख राम नाम का प्रतिदिन जाप आवश्यक है"  

  

regs,

sriram
