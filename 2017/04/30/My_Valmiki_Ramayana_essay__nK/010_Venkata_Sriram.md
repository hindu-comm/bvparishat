One of the great scholars of Andhra who is calledरामायण शिरोमणि wasमहामहोपाध्याय श्रीभाष्यं अप्पलाचार्यः who was an authority in srivaishnava siddhAnta and rAmAyaNa. He wrote a short article in telugu.
Telugu knowing scholars can appreciate this which is given in 150 th page. The article is "Are vAnarAs really monkeys?". However, he too, was baffled and left the conclusion 'to the discretion of readers".

  

The link is below:

There is another book on Sundara Kanda by Mr.Mehta which is below. The page no. 361 vide Section-3 gives out the 'Race of Haris (हरिः) and Riksha (ऋक्षाः) and gives his opinion that this typical vAnara race could have their origins from Mongolia. The link:

So, whatever may be our thesis works presented in universities / colleges, they are are purely "our own personal opinions' only. To some extent, the critical edition of Ramayana by MS University, Baroda has come up with good edition, however, for me (as a devotee of rAmachandra), I take it with a pinch of salt !
