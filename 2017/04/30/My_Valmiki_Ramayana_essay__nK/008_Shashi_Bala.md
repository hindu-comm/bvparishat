Dear Bijoy Misra,

I was wondering about the meaning of RA in VANARA.

According to Monier Williams one of the meanings of R (long I) is going, motion. But is marked as L meaning = lexicographers (i.e. a word or menaing which although given in native lexicons , has not yet been met with in any published texts.

## Masks

In the Ramayana the various warlike races have been described by the Vanaras (monkeys), the Bhaloos (bears) and the Rakshasas (demons). These races used to don masks not only on their heads, but on their entire bodies to look more formidable to their enemies. Some of them were past masters in personification and disguise, and once they assumed the chosen form, they were beyond recognition. It is evident from reading the Ramayana that secret of such an art was known to Hanuman. However, some of the Rakshasas also were well versed in that art. For example, Maricha assumed the form of the golden deer to allure Janaki, the wife of Rama. Ravana too disguised himself as a mendicant, when he appeared in Panchvati and kidnapped Janaki.
