Dear Shri Karve,

  

  As you are probably aware, the Pāṇinīya Śikṣā describes the length differences using the analogy of bird calls:

  

चाषस्तु वदतेमात्रां द्विमात्रं त्वेव वायसः । शिखी रौति त्रिमात्रं तु नकुलस्त्वर्धमात्रकम् ।। ४९ ।।  

  

  This can only be approximations, rather than absolute values.
There is another dimension, namely Vṛtti or speed of utterance described by the terms Druta, Madhya and Vilambita, namely fast, medium and slow speed. In one text, there is some description of a sort of water-drop clock to measure these, and yet in practical terms, these are also relative differences of speed. In terms of modern linguistics, while the differences of short and long vowels in Sanskrit are both phonetic and phonemic, the differences of speed are only phonetic, and not phonemic, in the sense the change of speed does not change the meaning of words.
The actual phonetics of sounds slightly differs from a person to person, and yet the words can be perceived to be the same, as long as the phonetic differences are not large enough.
