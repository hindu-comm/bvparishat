Dear Deshpande,

Thank you very much for your reply. Taking cue from the damaru reference in the आख्यायिका of Panini I worked on it and found that the vowel lengths of दीर्घ and प्लृत are exactly twice and thrice as long as the short vowel. Here the damaru is used as a metronome. I hope you will appreciate my case.

Achyut Karve.
