Namaste



I post below the entire post from another group where in the scholar analyzes ‘Vidushaka’ concept origin. I thought it fit to bring this post to the attention of traditional scholars of Home team who can see whether:

- ‘Vidushaka is really a ‘Virile Monkey connected to Rigveda Sukta 10.86 and 

- Validity of statements reading ‘ Gaṇeśa and the Vidūṣaka are depicted dancing in gay abandon Ganesha’



The other statements in the post may also draw scholarly criticism beyond a plain dismissal !



These posts widely circulated are derived from the Translations of Veda ( in this case: <http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10086.htm>)
and word lexicon derivation from (<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MDScan/2014/web/webtc1/index.php> - MD Scan entry वृषाकपि - वृषाकपि \[L=16997\] \[p= 297-3\] वृषाकपि vṛṣā́-kapi, m. man-ape or great

ape (RV.); ep. of the sun (E.); ep. of fire (C.); hymn ascribed to Vṛṣākapi (RV. X, 86; Br., S.). ). It is also connected with the understanding of the Sanskrit , Saivite Agamas and Abhinavagupta. 

The errors in learning the basics of Samskrutham yield their poisonous fruits over years ! especially in Religion studies .

In the second courtyard of Vasantasenā’s palace, Maitreya spots a thievish monkey restrained by being bound to a post, which seems to allude to the burglary in the previous Act (III). **The Vidūṣaka’s stereotyped assimilation to a mischievous (*duṣṭa*) brown monkey has been derived from the tawny ‘Virile Monkey’ (Vṛṣākapi) to whom an entire obscure dialogue hymn (X.86) of the Rigveda is dedicated.** The obscenely funny altercation among the manly lord Indra, his voluptuous wife Indrāṇī, and the lascivious Vṛṣākapi prefigures, in its crude ritual way, the tangled interaction between hero (*nāyaka*, presided over by Indra), heroine (Sarasvatī) and Vidūṣaka, whose sexual innuendos are deflected towards her maids instead. Indrāṇī complains to her over-indulgent husband that his pet ape keeps molesting her. Their grossly anatomical competition of virility versus impotence is reflected far more subtly in the **great brahmin’s role as *kāma-tantra-saciva*: on the one hand, his words, actions and example inculcate abstinence but, on the other hand, he is not only obscene but brandishes his upright crooked (flaccid) staff in lewd aggressive gestures in (highly) suggestive contexts.**

The Vidūṣaka’s brawls with maids have been compared to the **obligatory episode in the Vedic Mahāvrata ritual, where a brahmin ‘student’ (*brahmacārin*) abuses a prostitute for indiscriminately fellating her clients, before copulating with her**. The closest scene in the repertoire of drama is in the *Viddhaśālabhañjikā* by Rājaśekhara (9^(th) C.), where the royal couple witnesses Cārāyaṇa, exultantly raising his phallic staff as maid ‘Girdle’ (Mekhalā) grovels between his knees (see note 12 below): “I have mounted the chariot of love bringing this pleasure woman of the harem under my feet,” exclaims our “expert in Gandharva Veda.” To the queen’s angry complaints of impropriety, he retorts that it is revenge for her inflicting a prank on the king’s companion, returning the favor to her own handmaid. When the clown showed him the picture of a monkey with large basket-like ears, the king had remarked that it was Cārāyaṇa’s own portrait: **Vṛṣākapi and Brahmacārin have become indistinguishable.**

The Vṛṣākapi hymn, which was apparently recited at the later Soma sacrifice, begins with the lament that Indra’s votaries have ceased pressing the Soma for him, and speaks of the **royal deity as discriminating between Ārya and Dāsa (non-Āryan) while drinking this elixir** (86.19). The Soma-seller, representing the Vedic Gandharva from whom the priests were to buy the hallucinogenic plant, was **impersonated by a Śūdra, who was abused, beaten and then robbed of his treasure**. That the latter could otherwise be drawn from the Kutsa *gotra*, a clan of despicable degraded brahmins, implies that Soma is acquired only through an ambivalent mediator having the same status as the *mahābrāhmaṇa*. Seated outside the sacrificial arena, **the Śūdra ‘reviler’ (*apagara*) of the Mahāvrata vociferously abused the whole *yajña* as a priestly undertaking**, while a brahmin (*abhigara*) seated within praised it instead. **The ‘great brahmin’ seems to have combined these diametrically opposed roles within his own person.**

There is no reason to trace the (historical) ‘origin’ of the Vidūṣaka to any one of these (mutually exclusive) Vedic prototypes,[^(\[1\])](#m_4218425907718918206__ftn1) especially when his assimilation to a brown monkey, not prescribed by NŚ, could, like the other candidates, have been introduced much later into the literary dramas, after the earlier overtly ritual genres had become obsolete. Moreover, the hidden interconnections (*bandhu*) between these Vedic models—all sharing an inherently comic aspect—would instead suggest that **what has been transposed and adapted onto our enigmatic Vidūṣaka is their underlying symbolic framework**, the coherence of which remains obscure. For the same semiotic system seems to have engendered symbolic cousins, who are contemporaneous or appear only after the advent of the theatrical clown.

**The Pāśupata ascetics were brahmins, who sought liberation through clownish behaviors.** Though chastely remaining at a distance from women, they had to perform lewdly amorous gestures (*śṛṅgāraṇa*), thereby soliciting public ridicule. They feigned snoring, limping, and epileptic fits as integral to their spiritual praxis. Not only did they have to court general censure and derisive laughter, they had to indulge in explosive laughter (*aṭṭahāsa*) in imitation of their deity Rudra. These Pāśupatas are featured and **taunted as ‘great brahmins’ in the farcical comedies (*prahasana*)**, along with their more extreme and hedonistic Kāpālika fellow travelers, who are in turn sometimes labeled Mahā-Pāśupatas. Bharata’s dictum that *hāsya* is generated by *śṛṅgāra* may have been prompted by more than just aesthetic considerations deriving from the light-hearted depiction of love in theater and poetry. **The Pāśupatas meditated primarily on the unstructured (*anirukta*) sound AUM (OMkāra), Vedic sacred syllable par excellence, that presides over both the Vidūṣaka and Gaṇeśa.**

**The sculptural representation of the elephant-headed pot-bellied Gaṇeśa, most popular deity of the Hindu pantheon, is a subsequent crystallization of the same symbolism dynamically enacted by the Vidūṣaka.** Both share a voracious appetite and craving for *modaka*s; the clown in the *Adbhutadarpaṇa* is named ‘Big Belly’ (Mahodara), an appellation of Gaṇeśa. The single tusk corresponds to the upraised crooked staff (*kuṭilaka*) that otherwise matches the curved trunk. The *kuṭilaka* is the present of priestly Brahmā (NŚ); Gaṇeśa is identified with the Vedic Bṛhaspati, chaplain (*purohita*) of the gods led by Indra. The elephant’s ears recall the basket-like ears attributed to the clown in some plays. As ‘lord of obstacles’ (*vighneśvara*), the deity is propitiated to remove instead of creating them. **The normative theater revolves around the *nāyaka* steadfastly pursuing an aim in the face of obstacles (*vighna*) that necessarily diversify and complicate the plot before his eventual fulfillment.** ‘Friendly’ Maitreya creates two dire obstacles by facilitating the theft of the jewels (Act III) left in Cārudatta’s safekeeping and later betraying them in court (IX) to inculpate his patron. Vighneśvara’s alternative name, (Vighna-) **Vināyaka seems derived from the Vidūṣaka’s role as the ‘counter-‘ (*vi*-) *nāyaka*, who keeps getting in the way of such fulfillment.** The presiding deity of *hāsya* in NŚ are the deformed ‘churn-spirits’ (*pramaṭha-daivatya*) who accompany Śiva; the Pāśupata’s aim was to become ‘leader of the hosts’ (*gaṇa-pati*). Like this Śaiva ascetic imitating his ‘Lord of Dance’ (Naṭa-Rāja), both Gaṇeśa and the Vidūṣaka are depicted dancing in gay abandon. **Gaṇeśa as ‘lord of the hosts’ (*gaṇa*) is not a direct linear derivation from the Vidūṣaka.**

God-fearing Hindus, who would never take Gaṇeśa for a clown and even take offense at such a suggestion, are nevertheless tickled to death by the way in which the same traits are exploited in theater. The *hāsya* that envelops and trails the Pāśupata is not intended to amuse his spectators but to serve a hidden ritual purpose that culminates in liberation. So too, the comic incongruities of the Vidūṣaka may just as well serve a serious purpose, and even the *hāsya* they generate may be sublated, rather than simply negated, into a ‘semblance’ of itself. The various Vedic models recommended themselves precisely because they appeared funny to the Indologists, who nevertheless fell into controversy over whether those obligatory rituals, in their larger solemn setting, could have been intentionally so. The *hāsya* versus its ‘semblance’ dilemma already haunts the Vidūṣaka’s would-be ancestors and persists in his more recent cousins. **But the stimulus of humor is not objective but perceived incongruity: there is no reason why the ritual clown could not be perceived as both funny and serious from two different perspectives that are prima facie opposed but are mutually reinforcing at a deeper level.**



4\. “Vidūṣaka thus deploys the ‘semblance of humor’ (*hāsyābhāsa*)” (2), for Abhinavagupta, Genius of Kashmir



Friends,



Here is the footnote to the above part 2 of this 4^(th) subsection of section 1 (each subsection is devoted Abhinava’s 4 successive pronouncements on humor):



1.  For similar reasons, the quest for the (historical) ‘origin’ of the
    Sanskrit theater through a linear evolution—for example, in dance as
    opposed to recitation—is ill-conceived. The NŚ emerged from the
    confluence of three streams—brahmanical (sacrifice), Śaiva (dance)
    and epic (narrative)—that Bharata, belonging to the epic current,
    synthesized from and within the Vedic perspective. Should we then
    look for three (or more) origins?

Please not the added paragraph below on the problematic sexuality of the ‘counselor in the secret science of erotic love’ (*kāma-tantra-saciva*).

**Subject:** 4. “Vidūṣaka thus deploys the ‘semblance of humor’ (hāsyābhāsa)” (1) - Abhinavagupta, Genius of Kashmir



Unlike the situational comedy occasioned by the other characters, **the stereotyped Vidūṣaka is by (NŚ) definition and de facto convention a bundle of contradictions that render him, on diverse levels and along multiple axes, the prime locus of comic incongruity that inevitably envelops everyone and everything within his purview.** Sociologically, this ‘great brahmin’ (*mahābrāhmaṇa*) commands both the highest respect, especially from his devoted companion the (royal) hero (*nāyaka*), and the most ignominious manhandling, even from the maids and base characters. ^([\[i\]](#m_4218425907718918206__edn1)) \[…\] When Maitreya discovers maid Radanikā being violated just outside their door (Act I), he angrily raises his crooked staff against the mistaken culprit, declaring: “Look here! Even a (timid) dog becomes ferocious defending his own kennel. What then of a brahmin like me?” \[…\]



\>



Dietetically, the **great brahmin never discriminates between permissible and forbidden food** (*bhakṣyābhakṣya-priyo nityam*, *Bhāvaprakāśana*), betraying a fondness for wine, meat, etc. Though especially **addicted to rounded sweetmeats (*modaka*)**, the incurable glutton perceives the whole world, even inanimate items, as (resembling) food, the choice object of reference for his imaginative similes. The Mṛcchakaṭikā begins with Maitreya’s entrance lamenting the loss of his modakas (due to his patron’s penury). The fifth quadrangle of Vasantasenā’s palace is a vast kitchen bustling with culinary activities, sights and odors that whet Maitreya’s appetite (Act V), most of all a butcher boy washing the raw entrails of a slaughtered beast (*paśu*) as if it were cloth rag. Finding himself in heaven amidst throngs of (lascivious) centaurs (*gandharva*) and (voluptuous) nymphs (*apsara*), he craves to be offered water to wash his feet along with **an invitation to partake of all these sensual delights to his heart’s content**.



**Sexually, the (royal) hero’s friendly ‘counselor in the secret science of erotic love’ (*kāma-tantra-saciva*) seems hopelessly underqualified: naïve, chaste, misogynist, aggressive, lewd, obsessed, all at the same time.** Though sometimes named (Vasantaka, Kaumudagandha) after the aphrodisiacal ‘spring’ (*vasanta*) season, the (celibate) brahmin often seems averse to women, which accounts for his free access to the harem. Without the least provocation, he abuses the maids as “daughter of a whore” (*dāsyāḥ putrī*), making us wonder how he really feels about the dignified heroine. When Vasantasenā, having received Maitreya warmly in her sanctum and, speaking with due respect only in Sanskrit, asks him to inform beloved Cārudatta of her imminent visit, the go-between outwardly agrees but inwardly vows to advise his master to shun the ‘mercenary’ courtesan at all costs. On his return, the great brahmin is still fuming about not having been offered refreshments by that rude “daughter of a whore.” By making a knowing sign to her maid, while partly covering her face with the end of her garment—suggestive gesture that an obliging gallant might readily interpret as a seductive invitation—the sniggering courtesan would have been simply mocking his own dignity. He begs his ward Cārudatta to renounce all contact, for a courtesan is “painfully difficult to evict like a pebble caught in one’s shoe.” When Vasantasenā’s page hits him with a pebble to announce her impassioned arrival, he defiantly attacks with upraised staff the pigeons mating on the ledge above, until his master holds him back by his sacred thread. After the lovers’ mutual pleasantries are over, the “simpleton” innocently asks her maid Madanikā if she intends to stay over for the night, eliciting the latter’s condescending laughter. Nevertheless, in the courtesan’s seventh quadrangle, **amidst all the cooing love-birds kissing each other, the “caged parrot reciting a Vedic hymn, as if it were a brahmin having feasted on curds and rice” is an obvious self-reference, for his sexual ‘obsession’ is typically translated into a preoccupation with food.**



\>



**Why then does Abhinava declare that “the Vidūṣaka deploys in this way the ‘semblance of humor’ (*hāsyābhāsa*)”?** Especially when the NŚ, the authority of which he is establishing through his commentary, is unequivocal that “**the disruptive interventions and artifices of the Vidūṣaka should always be greeted by the spectators with boisterous laughter (*ati-hāsa*)**.”[^(\[iii\])](#m_4218425907718918206__edn2) Could he mean that the puerile clown’s ‘jokes’ are in such bad taste that they fall short of ‘authentic’ humor? Modern Indian scholars and theater critics have long lamented the clown’s stereotyped character, especially when contrasted to Shakespeare’s wise Fool, and speculated on the causes for his ‘degradation’ without satisfactorily accounting for his sacred role, so obvious in the *pūrvaraṅga*, and the apparent incoherence of NŚ prescriptions that already circumscribed, so narrowly, the undeniable skills of the dramatists. Given that the Vidūṣaka’s raison d’être is comic relief, would it not be a sad commentary on their creative imagination, intelligence, and sense of humor to have blindly followed these inexplicable conventions to the extent of hoisting him on the king as unworthy counselor and (more than) equal. But Western Indologists have long recognized **his ritual notations as echoing various likewise problematic characters in Vedic religion**.

Friends,



Here are the footnotes to the above part 1 of this 4^(th) subsection of section 1 (each subsection is devoted Abhinava’s 4 successive pronouncements on humor):



\[1\] Indologists have claimed that the classical Vidūṣaka must be a (grudging) concession to folk theater, where the haughty brahmin would have been pilloried with ridicule. The stock character of the mock brahmin, often profaning his sacred thread, was indeed attested in popular festivals, such as Holi and Muharram. Though at the most obvious level the ‘great’ brahmin is indeed a caricatural (self-) chastisement of the sort of pretentions to which privileged members of his caste were susceptible, this would hardly account for his supreme valorization by his noble and respected patron, often the king or himself an exemplary brahmin (Cārudatta).



2 Śāradātanaya, however, does repeat the NŚ description in his Bhāvaprakāśana, but with the addition of tawny hair and beard, which contradicts the NŚ baldness. This would confirm that later dramatists enjoyed much latitude in choosing among existing traits and even inventing new ones for their specific purposes.

**The one *rasa* that is coextensive with the entire play—from start to finish, in every scene, relayed by practically every character (except the *nāyaka* Cārudatta)—is the comic sentiment (*hāsya*) that is not only ancillary to and generated by *śṛṅgāra* but also by the semblances of all other emotions.** \[…\] ***Hāsya* in Sanskrit theater is focused on and around the incongruous words, behavior and interventions of the Vidūṣaka, transforming the great brahmin into an irresponsible Fool, the only reason why the uninitiated tolerate his irrelevant nonsense and clumsy transgressions.** But for those of us who recognize the esoteric logic and sacrificial rationality behind his (and the playwright’s symbolic) calculations,[^(\[v\])](#m_4218425907718918206__edn3) the clown’s ‘jokes’ (*narma*) become the secret backdoor to understanding the hidden meaning of the drama-as-enigma (*bráhman*).
