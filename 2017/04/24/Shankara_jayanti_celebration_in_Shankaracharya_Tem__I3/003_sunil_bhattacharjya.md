It could be possible that this celebration in the mandir in the Shankaracharya Hill in Kashmir may be taking place every year since Adi Shankara visited that place, about two thousand and five hundred years ago..  
  
Another similar interesting fact is that Shankara Jayanti celebration in the Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu in Nepal. Please see the url:

Adi Shankara visited Nepal in the 5th century BCE during the reign of Lichchhavi king Brishadeva (Vrishadeva) and the king named his son as Shankaradeva, who succeeded him.
