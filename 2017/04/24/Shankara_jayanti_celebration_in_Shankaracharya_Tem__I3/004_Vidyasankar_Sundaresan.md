However, the practice of observing Sankara Jayanti in a significant way was itself started only towards the end of the 19th century. This was instituted around the same time that the village of Kaladi in Kerala was identified and new temples were built there. All institutions and temples in the north that mark this day, including Pasupatinath in Nepal, use paddhatis borrowed from the south, as instituted by the then Sankaracharya of Sringeri.

This is all well documented recent history, so there's no need to speculate about it.

Best regards,
