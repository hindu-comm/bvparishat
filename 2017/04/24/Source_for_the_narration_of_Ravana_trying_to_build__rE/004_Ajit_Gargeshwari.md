I did say say " there are so many variations in floklore" One can comment if the folk version is apart of the main version or not. I did not say what Hari Prasad ji mentioned is not interesting nor did is say the folk lore have 'weird-looking aspects". Probably you have identified which Folklore this incident occurs?
