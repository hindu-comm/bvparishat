But, puffed up by tiny success in material advancement, sometimes the godless materialists challenge the existence of God. Rāvaṇa was one of them, and he wanted to deport ordinary men to the planet of Indra (heaven) by material means without consideration of the necessary qualifications. He wanted a staircase to be built up directly reaching the heavenly planet so that people might not be required to undergo the routine of pious work necessary to enter that planet.

Ravan was a great king but his one evil deed resulted in his fall. It is said that Ravan performed many good deeds, offered many sacrifices to the Gods and the Gods were also very pleased with him. Ravan wanted to live in heaven and was building a staircase to heaven. His every good deed resulted in one additional stair in the staircase. But his one evil deed resulted in his fall and closed his entry into heaven. Even today the incomplete staircase to heaven can be seen in the island of Lanka which is known today as**Sri Lanka**.
