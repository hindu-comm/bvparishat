I too concur with with Shrivatsaji. Ravana was the cursed Dvarapalaka of Vishnu his liberation is guaranteed. He was a liberated soul even before he was born. To honor the Sapta rishis curse he was born on earth. Ravana needs no stairway to go to Vaikuntha. Ravana was killed by Rama himself and his place in vaikuntha is guaranteed by that. One can add any story as one please in mythology and hence there are so many variations in floklore
