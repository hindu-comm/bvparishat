Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams.  
  
I am looking for a reference in any of the Rāmāyaṇas for the narration of Rāvaṇa building a stairway to svarga.  
  
**What I have found till now**: I have found a proverb quoted in the book 'Bānglā Pravāda' ( <https://archive.org/details/banglapravada> ):

This proverb (**#7629**) says — **রাবনের স্বর্গের সিঁড়ি** and gives some additional information that after being killed by Rāma, Rāvaṇa tried to make a stairway to heaven but could not succeed. However, it does not mention any source. It points to another proverb (**#8521**) as follows:

However, this proverb too does not list any Rāmāyaṇas.  
  
I tried to look in 'Rāmāyaṇa-mīmāṁsā' in the sections where Rāvaṇa's death is described, but could not come across any pointers to a reference.  
  
Can anyone help me in locating a reference to this narration (if there is any)? Or is simply local folklore in Bengal?  
  
Thanks in advance.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,
