shrivathsa ji,  

  
my pranams.  
  

Often the narration of Shri Rāma, Shri Krishna etc. is depicted in the form of a nāṭaka.  
  

In relation to a nāṭaka, there is something known as an **itivṛtta**, which can be roughly translated as 'plot'. Itivṛtta is categorized into three types:  
  

1\) **prakhyāta** (taken purely from historical incidents). Example is to base the nāṭaka's plot purely on Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.  
  

2\) **kalpita** (taken purely from the author's imagination). Example of this is Mālatīmādhava of Bhavabhūti  
  

3\) **saṅkīrṇa** (a.k.a. miśra, this is a combination of 1 and 2). Examples are many Nāṭakas based on Rāmakathā with somethings added by the creator of the Nāṭaka.  
  

So in a saṅkīrṇa variety of nāṭaka, it is very much possible that such incidents can occur, even though they may be siddhāntically off the track as you pointed out.
