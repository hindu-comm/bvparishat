I am just back in front of the system and noticed this post from you.

  

Dr Gargeshwari,

  

Let us take the example of a folk tale being narrated in a web source. It is very much possible that the tale is not documented in any non-web, written or published source. We like to verify whether this tale is really a traditional folk tale that has been in the oral tradition of transmission from a considerable amount of time or the person who brought it into the web site concocted it and claimed it to be a folk tale. One way of verifying that is to see if the same is being mentioned by several mutually independent sources including web sources. If it is being mentioned by several mutually independent sources including web sources, it supports the claim that it has been there in the oral tradition across the places and across the social groups.

  

When people cite or discuss stories from the memory of their oral tradition, they do not always mention, 'I heard it from my granny when I was a child' or something like that. But when people know that it is oral lore, they take it for granted that it is some such source as a granny telling bed time tales only.

  

In the present case, the web sources I presented are all mutually independent and present perspectives differentfrom each other. This verifies that the narratives have been in the oral tradition across the places and across the social groups.
