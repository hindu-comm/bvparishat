Hari Om Blessed Self!  
  
Greetings from CIF!!  
  
We are glad to announce the release of a new DVD title - ***Manīṣā-pañcakam***

  

[![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/6cfd78235f6dd/Man%C4%AB%E1%B9%A3%C4%81-pa%C3%B1cakam%20Cover.jpg?part=0.1&view=1)](http://www.chinfo.org/index.php/shop-now/english/manisha-panchakam-detail)  
  

  

***Manīṣā-pañcakam or the Pentad on Conviction*** is a set of five verses composed by Ādi Śaṅkarācārya. This introductory treatise on Vedānta is categorised as a Prakaraṇa-grantha. In just five verses, Śrī Śaṅkara elucidates the four Mahāvākyas in most lucid manner, making this text invaluable for any student of Advaita-vedānta.  
  
This set of 9 DVDs contains 18 discourses on Manīṣā-pañcakam by Swami Advayananda, Ācārya CIF, recorded during the weekly webinar satsaṅgs held at CIF in 2015.  
  
Buy your copy of the Manīṣā-pañcakam on CIF's online store - [www.chinfo.org/publications](http://www.chinfo.org/publications) --> Digital Media --> Manisha Panchakam or simply click on the above image.
