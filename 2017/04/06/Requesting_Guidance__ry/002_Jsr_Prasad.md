There is an ambiguity in your question. You say, you are aware about various good institutes in India while asking scholars to offer information on good national and international Universities. Also, you mention three of your research interests. Each of them carry different weights depending on the institutes that offer.  
  

You are trying to compare A2 milk with A1 milk. Let's imagine a situation like, an institute in China and it's counterpart in India offer a course in 'Hathayoga,' I'd rather chose the Indian institute, India being the place of it's genesis and best continued scholarship.  
  

Best wishes
