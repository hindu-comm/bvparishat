Dear Swapnil,

  

If I understood you correctly, you seem to prefer pursuing your PhD from a University in US, UK or such countries.

  

If that is what you want to know, this forum is not the right place for such information. Please browse and you will get the info about universities offering PhD or a PhD included graduate program in Sanskrit related fields such as Indology, South Asian Studies, History of Religions etc. The respective university websites will guide you further.

  

Even if you want to look for Indian universities, browsing is what you need to do. But field names keywords should be different.

  

Did you consult your teachers and/or career guidance cell of your university?

  

Did you consult agencies providing consultancy for education abroad?

  

The way you are using broad general words like 'Sanskrit literature', 'Vedanta philosophy' or 'South East Asian Studies', you seem to be not yet ready for a PhD level course.

  

You better study more and acquire more foundation.

  

This forum is suitable for consulting for research topics or questions within them etc. Once you study more , you will be able to know what is meant by a research topic etc.

  

That is a prerequisite for studying /pursuing PhD in India or abroad.

  

Best wishes.
