Namaste



What makes you think that your identified \< interest> in \<
Sanskrit literature, Vedant Philosophy and in the study of the South East Asia. > will be better served by \< foreign universities which offer the same program \> ?



Is it a different way of assessing that ‘ Indian Institutional Scholarship and Doctoral studies guidance ’ is ‘ comparatively of an inferior quality on a global scale ?



OR



Is it way of comparing Oranges and Apples (= institutions in different nations) , seeking a ‘Fruit punch juice’ (= out of India settling) as outcome ? 



I would be curious to know what other scholars would come out with as ‘Self-Rating of Scholarship and Institutional Standing’ in this connection.
