Respected all,



I am a student of Sanskrit. I have completed my M.A. in Sanskrit from Mumbai University. Now I am thinking about pursuing PhD degree in Sanskrit. For the same I am asking your scholarly guidance.

  

My interest lies in Sanskrit literature, Vedant Philosophy and in the study of the South East Asia.

  

I know that there are various good institutes in India which offers PhD course in Sanskrit. But at the same time I am searching for foreign universities which offer the same program. Because this is my primary search of renowned institutes before deciding anything.

  

If scholars put their views as well as information about best national and international universities and suggest me some good topics then it would be easy for me and my parents to take a decision.

  

Warm Regards.
