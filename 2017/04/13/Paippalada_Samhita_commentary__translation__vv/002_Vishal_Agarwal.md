Another addition to the list of translations: Kandas 13-14 are translated by Carlos Lopez, in HOS Opera Minor series.

Maria Green was supposed to complete a few other kandas but she had a fight with her PhD supervisor Michael Witzel and moved to NY where, I believe, she pursued Law.

A few individual Suktas are found translated in some other publications, e.g. Paippalada Brahmasukta in the Dharmakosha (Upanishad volume) ed by Tarkateertha Lakshman Shastri Joshi.
