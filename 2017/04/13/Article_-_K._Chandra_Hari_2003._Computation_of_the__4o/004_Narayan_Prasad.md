\<\<The original home of Madhava of Sagamagrama is near by Trichur , Kerala. It is very much near by my Home.>\>

  

Sir,

  

 Shri K V Sarma in his book "Computation of True Moon by माधव of सङ्गमग्राम", p.12, says:

 "He hailed from the viIIage of Sangamagrama, the modern Irinjalakkuda, near Cochin, in Central Kerala, the name of his house being इरञ्ञि निन्न पळ्ळि to be identified with one of the two stiII existing houses in the viIIage, named इरिञ्ञनवळ्ळि and इरिञ्ञारप्पळ्ळि".

  

 His village location (along with latitude and longitude) may be better viewed on the google map relative to Trichur and Cochin.

  

 Thanks and regards

 Narayan Prasad
