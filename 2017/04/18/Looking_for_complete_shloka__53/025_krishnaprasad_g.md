I respect the justification made by Shri Aklujkar ji.

But I have been informed by father who has learnt Pramanyavada at the age of 19 under Sri HH Visvesa Thirtha swamiji who is now nearing 65 that, namo pramanya vadaaya and many of his navya nyaya friends too quote the same.

Recently a in 2016 December a commentary was published on Pramanyavada even the preface reads the same
