Namaste,

  

Let me provide a quote on a topic that is so well discussed by our revered Prof. Deshpande:

  

 That which is lost may be demonstrated by how Deshpande approaches the translation of the same words. For he translates the participle stem गत gata as “that which was gone”; similarly, he translates स्मृत smṛta as “that which was remembered” (Deshpande, p. 175).

  

His translations may be understood in the following way. One thing that he does differenty, compared to Coulson, is to supply the word “was”. This indicates that he translates this passive participle not in a present sense (i.e. not as “that which is gone” or “that which is remembered”), but as happened (more) in the past. This is relevant because past passive participles — despite their long and reasonably “determined” name — may very well also assume a present sense, not just a past sense.

  

Another thing that he does differently than Coulson is to add the notion of an object that is connected to the action of the underlying verb: “that which”. In other words, he introduces the idea that there is a nominal part of the participle that needs to be shown or highlighted for us to flesh out the full meaning of the participle.

  

In the two Deshpande translations provided above, that object is very abstract (“that which”). But this is simply because we are here dealing with a translation of a participle stem, as opposed to a declined participle. So in a Deshpande-style literal translation of a past passive participle with actual case terminations (i.e. not just a participle stem), it would be natural to find the object less abstract. Instead of “that which”, we would have, for a participle with a masculine singular case ending, “he who was gone”; alternatively, for a participle with feminine singular case terminations, “she who was remembered”.
