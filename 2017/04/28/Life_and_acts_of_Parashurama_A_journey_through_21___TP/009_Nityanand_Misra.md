Dear Sh. Praveen Bhat

  

The first verse is verse 118 from the Ananda Ramayana, Manohara Kanda, Canto 7. You can see it here

  

<https://archive.org/stream/HindiBookAnandRamayan/Hindi%20Book-Anand%20Ramayan#page/n667/mode/1up>

  

I do not know the source of the second verse. Hoping other list members can help.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
