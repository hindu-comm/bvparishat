You have consulted considerable number of purANas for each *nAma*, of 21 names of Parasurama, Nityananda Ji. Nice effort!  
  

Parasurama believed to have installed the main Sivalingam in the 700 years old Vadakkumnathan temple in Trichur, Kerala. The small temple-history book states two instances -  
  
1. Parasurama use to visit the temple to worship Siva until few centuries back. This was based on identifying his exclusive super-human characteristics and documented devotee experiences.  
  
2. The puraNic Vasuki use to encircle on the mammoth bell in temple premises. Later, He stopped to appear in the temple, as people were frightened by looking at its gigantic form. I could not notice the big bell, during my personal visit over there.  
  

Prof. Patur Ji's article on Renuka-Ellamma is a great information for me. As honestly, we are least bothered about the history of local goddesses/graama-devataas. Henceforth, this perception would surely change.  

  

Dr. Sampadananda Mishra has recently wrote a brief note about [Kavaya Kantha Ganapathi Muni's vision of Parasurama](http://www.indiadivine.org/ganapati-muni-vision-parashurama/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiadivine.org%2Fganapati-muni-vision-parashurama%2F&utm_content&utm_campaign=Ganapati+Muni+and+His+Vision+of+Parashurama) on Mahendragiri Hill, located in Srikakulam District, Andhra region.
