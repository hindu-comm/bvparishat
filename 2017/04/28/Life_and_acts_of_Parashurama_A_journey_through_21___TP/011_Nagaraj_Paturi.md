I am just back in front of the system.

  

Thanks Prof. Kannan, for your kind words.

  

But it has been my profession for the last three decades to be engaged in research-teaching at universities on these topics.

  

I am happy that venerable scholars like you appreciate this folk-Vedic integrated view of Indian culture that undoes the ill effects of one sided , biased Vedic-centric view or the obverse side of it and the artificial conflict between the two that are intentionally or unintentionally being created in the studies of Indian culture.
