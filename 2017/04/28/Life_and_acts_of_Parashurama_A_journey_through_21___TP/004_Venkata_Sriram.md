Nice article Misra-ji.   
  
The last nameचिरञ्जीवी implies as you have mentioned "immortal", reminded me of an incident which happened with one of the respected members of this august forum (Prof.Siddharth Wakankar ji). While Professor himself is a great scholar and chandi upAsaka, needless to mention about his father too ! 

  

His grandfather was a siddha purusha who was initiated into the secrets of srividya in himalayas by Bhagavan Parashurama. When Prof.Wakankar-ji was in Hyderabad, we had a long talk over phone and this was revealed. 

  

Apart from His avatarahood, He was also a propagator srividya tantra in general and kaula path in particular. There is a kalpa-sutra which details out the elaborate ritual of srichakra worship called "parashuraama kalpa sutra". 

  

Some 50 years ago, there lived a siddha purusha in Shivpuri near Akkalkot by name Sri.Gajanan Maharaj. He was initiated into theतान्त्रिक महापूर्णाभिषेक by Parashurama and later he composed Parashurama Ashtottara in extempore after initiation. A temple dedicated to Parashurama can be seen now where the initiation took place.

  

Shri.Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni, too had a vision of Parashurama while meditating on Renuka (Chinnamasta) who had codified the beating of chest 21 times by Renuka. In his meditation, he heard a typical Renuka mantra having 21 bija-s .

  

So, this is how the compassionate Bhargava guides the upAsakAs.

  

regs,
