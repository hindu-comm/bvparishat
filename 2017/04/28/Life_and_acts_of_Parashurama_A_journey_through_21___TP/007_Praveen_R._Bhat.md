Thanks for your article and the wishes. Akshaya Tritiya and Parashurama jayanti wishes to you too. Towards the end of the article you list seven Chiranjivis. I've heard Markandeya also to be counted among Chiranjivis added as the eighth as in the shloka below; would you or anyone else know the source for this?

अश्वत्थामा बलिर्व्यासो हनूमांश्च विभीषणः।

कृप: परशुरामश्च सप्तैते चिरजीविनः॥

सप्तैतान् संस्मरेन्नित्यं मार्कण्डेयमथाष्टमम्।

जीवेद्वर्षशतं सोपि सर्वव्याधिविवर्जितः॥  

  

Kind rgds,
