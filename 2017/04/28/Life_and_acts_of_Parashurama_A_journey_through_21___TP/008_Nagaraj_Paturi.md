The story of Parasurama, from the perspective that it is the story of the goddess Renuka-Ellamma, is widely prevalent as a folk epic in several different textual and performing art versions running into several nights of performance hours in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Marathi folk cultures. Renuka -Ellamma is the caste-deity of several castes including tanner-cobbler castes and the performing-artist-sub-castes patronized by them. She is the family deity of numerous families.

  

A fifteenth century Telugu poet who gives an extremely detailed description of the 14th century Warangal (an important city of Telangana, once capital of the Kakatiya empire), describes a Bavaneedu (Baindla, one of the the performing-artist-sub-castes patronized by the tanner-cobbler castes) performing through narrative singing the story of Parasurama in the street. This establishes that the presently still vibrant performing through narrative singing of the story of Parasurama in the streetsis at least seven centuries old.
