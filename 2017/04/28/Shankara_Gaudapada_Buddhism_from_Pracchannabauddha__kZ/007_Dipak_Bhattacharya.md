**I draw the attention of colleagues to a fundamental aspect of Gau·ap¡da’s doctrine as found in the Mu¸·akopaniÀad. The salient feature is the fourfold graded division of things. This first appeared in the Ch¡ndogya but then it became an obscure idea. The fourfold division is found later in the Maitr¢ and the M¡¸·£kya. There are reasons to believe that it was Maitreyan¡tha (Abhisamay¡laṅk¡rak¡rik¡) who revived the old doctrine in a Buddhist garb. The M¡¸·£kya which I believe to be a post-Vedic UpaniÀad of the fourth century took up the theory paving the way of its permeating the later Minor UpaniÀads.**

**I refer colleagues to the premier article in the Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 6, 1978 Dordrecht, Holland.**

**The idealism of Gau·ap¡da is UpaniÀadic but some aspects like the fourfold division indicate possible Mahayana Buddhist influence.**

**Sorry for the long lecture**

**Best**
