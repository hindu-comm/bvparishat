What I wrote is to add to the caution that Shri Veeranarayanaji is telling the readers to take. Adi Shankara is not against the Mahayana Buddhism as the Mahayana teachings are akin the upanishadic teachings and I tried to show that. In that way he can be called Pracchanna Buddha, provided one knows why. If you think that my mail is wrong in any way, the scholars, including you, may correct me.
