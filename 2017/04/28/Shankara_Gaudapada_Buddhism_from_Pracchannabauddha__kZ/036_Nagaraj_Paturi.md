But the fact remains that Buddhism, Jainism and Vedic tradition(under the title of 'Hinduism') are classified together into one single group called'Dharmic religions' by the scholars of Comparative Religion to distinguish them from say, Abrahamic or semitic religions. Dharmic religions have many other concepts apart from 'Dharma', such as jananamaraNachakra, kAlachakra etc. in common.  

  

Continuities between among 'Dharmic' traditions in certain specific aspects is natural, already recognized and studied. Discontinuities among them too are bound to be there. It is the discontinuities which give distinct identities to each of them within the group.Subscribers to both sides do purvapaksha of the other side pointing out the discontinuities between them.The two way process of flow of ideas from Vedic to Buddhist and Jain and from Buddhist and Jain to Vedic is natural and not a fault on the part of either of the sides.

  

To use the fault lines for breaking India is a strategy being tried out nowadays.
