The key word here isअद्वयवस्तुसामीप्यमुक्तम् by which Shankara admits that buddhism comes close to non-dualism. He does not say this for any other doctrines like samkhya, yoga or nyaya though he might have accepted some aspects of them.

  

To give an analogy, there are lot of similarities between human beings. Everyone has 2 hands, 2 legs etc. But there are lot more similarities between siblings or twins. Buddhism and advaita are siblings in this analogy.
