Can some learned vidwAn confirm if the following 2 statements are true -  
  
1. The charge of Shankara being prachchanna bauddha was first levelled by Bhaskara, the bhedAbheda vAdin.  
  
2. Sriharsha virtually acknowledges that advaita and mAdhyamika buddhism are the same, except that the former accepts an eternal Atman, while the latter does not.

Kalyan
