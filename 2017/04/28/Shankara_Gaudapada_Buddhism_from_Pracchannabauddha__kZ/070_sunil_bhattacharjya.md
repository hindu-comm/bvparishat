There are many scholars who may know a lot of Sanskrit, and that does not mean that they know everything in the world. I was referring to Sugata, which Lord Buddha himself mentioned in Dhammapada. So reading the Dhammapada should be the first thing before opening mouth. That is my stand. The jains call even Lord mahavira as Sugata. Jacobi has written how the word Sugata has been used.
