Prasadji,  
  

Before writing the email, which I was responding to, you yourself were apologetically mentioned that with your little of knowledge . . . . etc. and then you went on to write authoritatively on "sugata". Your reply was not the right one. so it appeared to me that you have not read the Dharmapada. Amarakosha written in the first century BCE wrote "सर्वज्ञः सुगतो बुद्धो धर्मराजस्ततथागतः (sarvajnaH, sugataH, buddhaH" dhamarajaH, tathAgataH), but I was referring to the Dhammapada of Tathgata Buddha
of the 19th century BCE. One cannot overule the meaning of Sugata definition given in the Buddhist canonial text of the 19th century BCE by quoting a later day text. Further, by the time of Amarakosha eveo Lord Mahavira was born and the word Sugata has been used by the Jains too.  
  
Shri Subrahmanianji sent an on Shri Satchidananda Saraswatiji (SSS) and that mentioned Sugata and responding to that I wrote that SSS might not have read the Dhammapada. Had you read that attachment ypu would have known what I was referring to.  
  

Don't try to be apologetic if you think that you are knowall, as you are now trying to say.
