Respected Bhattacharya sir,  
  

I got interested in your following pointer -  

**  
'The idealism of Gau·ap¡da is UpaniÀadic but some aspects like the fourfold division indicate possible Mahayana Buddhist influence.'**

  

If I've not mistaken, you refer to the concept that has already been revealed by Sushruta in Sushruta Samhita - तत्र चतुर्विधो भूतग्रामः संस्वेदजजरायुजाण्डजोद्भिज्जसञ्ज्ञः । (1.1.22).  
  

Let me quote the purport of Sushruta's statement, who are not acquainted with.  
  

Loka has a two fold division - 1. **स्थावर** and 2. **जङ्गम** ।  
  

स्थावर is again fourfold:  

1\. वनस्पतयः  

2\. वानस्पत्याः  

3\. वीरुद्ः  

4\. ओषधयः  

  
**जङ्गम** is again fourfold:  

1\. जरायुजाः  

2\. अण्डजाः  

3\. स्वेदजाः and  

4\. उद्भिज्जाः  

  
Indeed, Ayurveda is considered to be an *upaveda* of which we are well aware of. Hence, must this be the most ancient reference to the four fold division, explained ever?
