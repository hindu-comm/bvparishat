Why do you say so? Here, Brahman is not the base, this position is Brahman itself! This is brahma-vAda or ajAti-vAda of Advaita which is no different than ajAta-vAda of mAdhyamaka though they start from different positions. In fact for Advaita this is the ultimate truth as well as article of faith while mAdhyamaka reaches this truth from pratItyasamutpAda. 

  

(By the way, when the Bindu Upanishads as well as viveka-chUDAmaNi talks about this narrative they are not talking about brahman as a "base").

  

..and pray, why this position of ajAtivAda is not acceptable to mAdhyamaka? In fact its earliest articulation appears in mUlamAdhyamakakArikA of nAgarjuna in the first or second century AD resulting in the absolutist position of uttata-tantra (ratnagotravibhAga), lankAvatAra sUtra and bhAvaviveka probably before gauDpAda's time and and hence most probably before Shankara (8th century AD).

  

Incidentally, when you say, ajAti vAda is not acceptable to Buddhists, I hope you are making this statement after reading all these mahAyAna texts.
