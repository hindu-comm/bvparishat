That is the point.

  

If one want's to give significance to the fact that 'Buddhism is pUrvapaksha for the advaitin' it is not correct to call an Advaitin as a prachhannabauddha.

  

The problem that I am highlighting is that those who give significanceto the fact that 'Buddhism is pUrvapaksha for the advaitin' themselves are calling Advaitins as prachhannabauddhas. Those who agree with the observations by persons like Prof.Yamakami that Sankara did not understand Buddhism agree contradictingly with the observation that Sankara is a prachhannabauddha.

  

\>By the way, the tag of prachchanna bauddha is not liked by most modern day advaitins.

  

---- Was that tag liked by any pre-modern Advaitin?

  

When a person knows that a tag is being used in a pejorative sense in reference to the thought he subscribes to, it is natural not to like the tag.

  

There are expressions such as kuhanaagopa, leelaamaanushavigraha which are of the opposite type. They are used in praise.

  

When a person uses the tag prachhannabauddha in a pejorative sense, there are the following implications:

  

1\. The user of the tag does not like Buddhism. He likes the form in which the prachhannabaudha appears outwardly. His allegation is that the prachhannabauddha's outward form is not his true form.

  

2\. If a person who likes Buddhism uses the tag prachhannabauddha in reference to an Advaitin, use of that tag is like kuhanaagopa, leelaamaanushavigraha used in praise.

  

3\. A person who likes Buddhism, can not use the tag prachhannabauddha in a pejorative sense. If he does, it is either naivety or hypocrisy.
