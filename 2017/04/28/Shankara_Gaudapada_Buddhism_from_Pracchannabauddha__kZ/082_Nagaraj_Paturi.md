Enough of your fancy theories of 19th century BCE and so on which you have been repeating without providing evidences sought by the members.

  

I allowed this post just to show to the group your impolite expressions towards scholars such as :

  

"Don't try to be apologetic if you think that you are knowall, as you are now trying to say."

  

No further post from you shall be allowed in the list.
