//  
There were/are descriptions of Buddhism as 'protestant Hinduism' , as a 'subset of Hinduism' etc. by a certain strand of western scholarship too. Alexander Wynne's 'the origin of Buddhist meditation' and other such works do trace at least certain aspects of Buddhism to Vedic culture or texts .//  
  
Practices like yoga and meditation are most likely pre-vedic and can be seen in the Indus valley civilization. Further, the brAhmaNas and sramaNas had some common doctrines too.
