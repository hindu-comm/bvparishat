Namaste,  
  

The Vaishnavas like Shri Yaminacharya called both Shri Gaudapadacharya and Shri Adi Shankara as Pracchanna Buddha (conceale Buddha).. Gaudapadacharya appreciated the works of Nagarjuna and Nagarjuna never said that Buddism is nihilism. Lord Buddha had three promulgations, the first one given in Sarnath came to be known broadly as Hinayana (lesser vehicle), which directs the followers to practice virtuous conduct and dharma for their own good, while the next one given a few decades later at the Vulture peak came to be known as Mahayana (bigger vehicle) and this told the ways by which one can not only benefit oneself but can also carry others alongwith. The last one given later came to be known as Vajrayana, which was meant to help one to attain nirvana in this birth itself.  
  
Adi Shankara responded to the Sarvastivadins and others who deviated much from the Mahayana. That does not mean that Adi Shankara was against Mahayana. Both Gaudapdacharya and Adi Shankara understood the Mahayana teachings of Lord Buddha, and appear to have no real difference with Mahayana teachings. Inthe Prajñāpāramitā-*Hṛdaya Sūtra*, Lord Buddha says that Sariputra (a bodhisattva) saw the emptiness in the five skandhas (five koshas) and In Advaita one becomes Videhamukta, when one leaves the five koshas. These five-koshas are given in the Upanishad and when one realizes Brahman, one is no longer confined to the five koshas.  
  

As regards the birthplace of Kumarila Bhatta (Bhattacharya), he was from the Goalpara district of Assam. His sister Bharati was married to Mandana Mishra.
