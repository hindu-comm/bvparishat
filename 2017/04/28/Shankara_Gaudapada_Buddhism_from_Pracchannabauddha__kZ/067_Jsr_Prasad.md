Sunil Ji,  
  
I wonder, why you did not say anything on the ‘full knowledge’ of Swamiji. On one hand you say “*As regards Shri Satchidananda Saraswati (SSS) he was a very learned person and I have great regards for him*…” and on the other hand, you seriously doubt his learning on utopian grounds. What a paradox Ji! Should I repeat from my previous post - \<You did not show where Swamiji has faltered in interpreting Buddha for Sugata.>  
  
I did not have read the Dha(r)mmapada text, but revered Swamiji must have read it. Prof. Kannan Ji has expressed the same, initially. When you don’t use a common sense on commenting upon a holy and departed soul, what is the fun in considering your suggestion?  
  
Don’t give free advises on anyone's little knowledge, as I am still waiting to see your response on the quotations from Viveka Vilasa and Amarakosha?
