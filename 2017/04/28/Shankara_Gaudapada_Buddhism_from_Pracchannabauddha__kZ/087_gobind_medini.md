``` // स्वप्रकाशमानन्दघनं शून्यमभवत् इति श्रुतिः// ```

``` Which shruti is this? 
```

``` Svaprakashatvam is not an attribute of Brahman. It only suggests that Brahman imparts "existence and meaning" (prakAsh) to the world objects without undergoing any change in Itself or without any action on its part. It is a negation of darkness (jaDatva). Even "sat, chit, Ananda", the so called characteristics of the Brahman are essentially words which need to be dropped after they serve the purpose of negating non-existence, non-sentience etc.. Brahman is via negativa, neti neti and any positive attributes or words like nitya, shuddha, buddha,mukta ets which we may occasionally use to describe Brahman are nothing but negation of their opposites. We cannot differentiate Brahman from Shunya because both are via negativa.. totally attribute-less. the real description of Brahman is silence (bAdhva-bAShkali dialogue vide BS 3.2.17) of brahmasUtra) ```

``` This fact is prominently highlighted in Advaita's ajAti-vAda (akin to ajAta-vAda of mAdhyamaka): "There is no birth, no death, no bondage, no spiritual aspirant, no Seeker, and no one liberated. This is the ultimate Truth." (Cf. vivekachUDAmaNi, amRRitbindu upaniShad etc.). Thus, both mAdhyamaka and Advaita vedAnta converge on the similar end position. ```
