Firts of all this is seemingly a deliberate digression from the context. \<Will advaitins trust a dvaitin translating their works?> Yes, why not? When a Dvaita or Visishtaadvaita translates an Advaita work, I would trust the same if He were unbiased. In other words, if were considered to be an 'aapta.' You may look at the valuable comments of respected Prof. Prahaldachar Ji and Prof. Nagasampige Ji.  
  

Prof. Paturi Ji said - \<If one want's to give significance to the fact that 'Buddhism is pUrvapaksha for the advaitin' it is not correct to call an Advaitin as a prachhannabauddha.\> That means, a siddhanti can only establish his siddhaanta, only after having clearly and straightforwardly mentioned the puurva-paksha. So, puurva-paksha should be either be a gist of the puurva-pakshi or a direct extract from their texts.  
  

Vidwan Sri Subramanian Ji has offered ample inputs on '*pracchanna-vaidikataa*' of Bauddhas. You are not interested in following it up?  
  
I am adding the above to the arguments put forth by Prof Paturi.
