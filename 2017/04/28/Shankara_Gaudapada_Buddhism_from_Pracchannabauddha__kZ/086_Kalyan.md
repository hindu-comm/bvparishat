Firstly, I want to say that there is no point in quoting the sUtra bhAshya or gItA bhashya because it is Gaudapada that is under the scanner. So I am ignoring the quotations from these sources.

  

Secondly, the question is - are buddhism and advaita closely allied doctrines? To this, we dont need to work based on conjecture because Shankara himself has given the answer -

  

  

ज्ञानज्ञेयज्ञातृभेदरहितं परमार्थतत्त्वमद्वयमेतन्न बुद्धेन भाषितम्। यद्यपि बाह्यार्थनिराकरणं ज्ञानमात्रकल्पना च अद्वयवस्तुसामीप्यमुक्तम्।इदं तु परमार्थतत्त्वमद्वैतं वेदान्तेष्वेव विज्ञेयमित्यर्थः ॥

  

Translation by Swami Gambhirananda -

  

"That the nature of the supreme reality is free from differences of knowledge, known and knower and is without a second...this fact was not expressed by Buddha, though, a near approach to non-dualism was implied in his negation of outer objects and his imagination of everything as mere consciousness. But the non-duality, the essence of the ultimate reality, is to be known from the upanishads only. This is the purport."

  

Therefore we dont need to rely on conjecture when we have Shankara openly admitting that Buddhism is close to advaita.

  

In fact, I would say that if you add upanishadic Atman to mahayana buddhism, you get Gaudapada's advaita.
