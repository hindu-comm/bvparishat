Your comment is not in good taste. You did not show where Swamiji has faltered in interpreting Buddha for Sugata. When you allege on scholar of such a stature, you might have studied his Dhammapada Kannda translation, right? You are welcome to present your views to the scholars.  

  
With a little knowledge in the subject, I can't add more to the discussion; but would like to say the following:  

  
Is Tathaagata Buddha same as Sugata?  
  

Yes, Viveka Vilasa text says -  
  
**बौद्धानां सुगतो** देवो विश्वं च क्षणभङ्गुरम् ।  
आर्य्यसत्त्वाख्यया तत्त्वचतुष्टयमिदं क्रमात् ।।१।।  
  
*"There are four first principles recognized as articles of faith by the Buddhists, viz.:-. **Sugatadeva**, otherwise known as Buddha, is the Lord worthy of homage."  
  
*Further, the followers of बुद्ध, are called बौद्ध and the followers of सुगत are called सौगत, grammatically with a Taddhita affixation. If Buddha is not Sugata, then do you believe, there are two proponents of Buddhist philosophy? If so, I would appreciate if you can remove the confusion created by Buddhist scholar Amarasimha in his Amarakosha -  

सर्वज्ञ*स्सुगतो बुद्धो* धर्मराजस्तथागतः... etc.
