Of course, what Shankara does not realize is that it is not mahayana buddhism that has come close to advaita, but the other way round. Advaita has gone close to mahayana buddhism. Advaitins refute everything except Atman. Buddhists go one step further and refute the Atman also. In that sense, Buddhists are one step ahead of advaitins.
