Dear friends,  
  
Sweeping expression of bias against a well- recognized path may not be appropriate in an scholarly forum like BVP. Whether Dvaita, or Vishishtadvaita or Advaita, all are correct in their own perspective. When Lord Ram offered to give the highest Mukti (Sayujya Mukti) to Hanumaji, the latter rejected the offer, as he preferred to remain a Bhakta. Even Adi Shankara is also said to have expressed that the dvaitavada can be more appealing for the sake of Bhakti "Bhaktyartha". So why quarrel on who belongs to which path.  
  

As regards Shri Satchidananda Saraswati (SSS) he was a very learned person and I have great regards for him, not because he was an advaitin. Simlarly, I also have great regards for Dr. B.N.K.Sharma (BNKS) , another very learned person, who was a Dvaitin. It is not necessary that I should agree to everything SSS or BNKS said.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
