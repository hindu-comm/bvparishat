1\. Prof. Kannan said, "Swami Sachchidanandendra Sarasvati has translated*Dhammapada*into Kannada.  
*So he must have read the book*." (Highlighting mine). Did he ask anyone to trust the translation? His point was 'he must have read the book'.

  

2\. BTW, are all the translations of Dhammapada by Buddhists only?

  

3\. Are all the translations of Gitanjali by Brahmos? Would you trust the translations of Gitanjali by non-Brahmos?

  

4\. If one takes a stand that an Advaiti is a pracchannabouddha, one's not trusting the Advaiti's translation of a Buddhist work is a contradiction.
