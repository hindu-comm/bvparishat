Near approach to non-dualism doesn't not mean same as non-dualism. The last sentence of even the translation rejects it. "To be known from the Upanishads only" means that otherwise it cannot be known. This is confirmed by the Tikakara so: सकलभेदविकलं परिपूर्णमनादिनिधनं ज्ञप्तिमात्रमुपनिषदेकसमधिगम्यं तत्त्वमिह प्रतिपाद्यते। \*मतान्तरे तु नैवमिति\* कुतो मतसाङ्कर्याशङ्का \*अवकाशमसादयेदित्यर्थः\*।

First, by saying this you seem to have accepted that Upanishadic Atman is Advaita Atman. Then, to the specific kind of jump you make in equating, I too could jump and say that since "Upanishadic Atman" is Advaita Atman, you add it to anything and you will get Advaita. Its not really an argument, is it!
