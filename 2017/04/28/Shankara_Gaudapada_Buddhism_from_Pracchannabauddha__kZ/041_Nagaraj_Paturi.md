Congratulations for being able to decipher the Indus Valley material and see Yoga and Meditation in that material. But those who would stick to scientific research are frank enough to say that most of the 'Indus Valley' material (that is now excavated beyond 'Indus Valley' in a vast part of India) is not yet deciphered and hence unintelligible.
