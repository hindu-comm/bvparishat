//2. BTW, are all the translations of Dhammapada by Buddhists only?//  
  
May be not. There could be some translations by non-Buddhists. However, the advaitin is not merely a non-buddhist. Buddhism is pUrvapaksha for the advaitin. That would make a lot of difference.  
  
By the way, the tag of prachchanna bauddha is not liked by most modern day advaitins.
