//It would be good if Sriharsha's reference to such a siddhanta-aikya, is provided!//  
  
First of all, I dont know whether Sriharsha really said about siddhAnta aikya. Thats why i asked members here to confirm this.  
  
Having said that, Sri Harsha uses mAdhyamika logic to argue against nyAya in his khandanakhandakhAdya. If Sriharsha has really made such a comment, it would most likely be in this work.
