Firstly I want to say that there is no point in ignoring the BSB and the BGB because the method of Shankara's vedanta is: ekavākyatā. He takes the global view and not any localized view. That is why he has cited Gaudapada in the BSB. So, if you ignore the other passages of Shankara, you are clearly working on conjecture giving up pramana.

Traditional Advaitins rely on traditional commentaries and not on translations. If you find the latter reliable, you are so much less towards the truth.

Those who are not trained in the proper sampradaya end up with such cocktails. Shankara calls them 'mūrkhavadupekshaniyaḥ.
