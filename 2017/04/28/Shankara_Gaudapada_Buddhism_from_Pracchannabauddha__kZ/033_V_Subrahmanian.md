If presence of many similarities between schools is enough reason to say that school X is pracchanna-y school, then we may end up saying that the Gaudia school is only pracchanna Ramanuja or Madhva school for all of them accept Vishnu to be supreme, accept an eternal Vishnu loka and reaching there for salvation, world is real, real distinction across jiva-s, etc. Vidwan Polagam Rama Sastry in his book 'chaturmatasāmarasyam' (published along with Appayya Dikshita's 'Chaturmatasarasangraha') first lists 51 'general' similarities between the four schools: Advaita, Srikantha's Shiva vishsistadvaita, Ramanuja's and Madhva's schools. After that, between two schools, taken in a particular order, in this list also he goes on to list several similarities.
