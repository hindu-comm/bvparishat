As far as I know, Bhaskara uses the word *bauddha-matavalambin* (see the image below, and also [here](https://archive.org/stream/BrahmaSutraBhashyaOfBhaskarNos.70185209Year1915ChowkhambaSanskritSeries/Brahma%20Sutra%20Bhashya%20of%20Bhaskar%20Nos.%2070%20%2C%20185%2C%20209%20Year%201915%20-%20Chowkhamba%20Sanskrit%20Series#page/n139/mode/1up)) but not *pracchanna-bauddha*. I may be corrected.

The word *pracchanna-bauddha*, which in my humble opinion is quite apt, is used by Bhagavan Ramanujacharya in his commentary on BS II.2.27.

I do not know about this, other list members may throw some light.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
