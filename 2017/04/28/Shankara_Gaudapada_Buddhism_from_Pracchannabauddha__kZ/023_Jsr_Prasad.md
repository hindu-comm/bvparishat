Scholars may excuse my indulgence. In the pdf link provided by Vidvan Subramanian Ji, the following portion may attract the attention of scholars, with regard to his above comment (page 9) -  
  
*"Sri Gaudapada has divided the Mandukya texts into sections and has introduced his Karikas in between every two sections with a sentence "अत्रैते श्लोका भवन्ति," The following verses are in elucidation of this section. Seeing that traditional Advaitins have been studying the Karikas in the same order, the authors of Bhashyas pertaining to other schools, perhaps mistook the karikas too for portions of the Upanishad, and attempted to explain them also by dextrous display of interpretation so as to suit their own doctrine. And being unable to perhaps to twist the other chapters on unreality etc., studied indepently by the Advaitins and mroe expressly establishing Advaita unequivocally, or even to meet the arguments adduced by the Bhashya thereon, they may have begun to pacify their followers by dubbing the Advaitins as crypto-Buddhists. This is the only hypothesis that could explain the phenomenon."*

This observation is noteworthy and this custom can still be seen in Vaidika houses (irrespective of the trimata-sampradaaya) in Telangana and Andhra states.

It would be good if Sriharsha's reference to such a *siddhanta-aikya*, is provided!
