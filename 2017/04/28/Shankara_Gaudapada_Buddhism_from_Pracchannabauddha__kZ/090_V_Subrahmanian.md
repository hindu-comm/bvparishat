For Shankara, Buddhism, as purvapaksha, is received from tradition, starting from Veda Vyasa and Gaudapada, Kumarila bhatta, and the Acharyas whom he salutes in his bhashyas. So the right way to view any non-vedantic school is with Vedanta as the reference point. Shankara does not subscribe to your asampradayic views, which he has asked one to reject as something with no content worth consideration.

For Vedantins the illogicality and impossibility of rejecting the Atman is quite apparent. One need not go further to see who is ahead of whom.
