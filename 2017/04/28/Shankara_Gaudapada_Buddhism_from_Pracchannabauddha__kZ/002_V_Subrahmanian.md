Namaste

  

Here is a pdf on the above topic. Sri Satchidanandendra Sarswati Swaminah (5 January 1880 – 5 August 1975)(SSS)<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satchidanandendra_Saraswati> has studied the Mādhyamika Kārikā-s of Nagarjuna along with the commentary of Chandrakirti and also the Kārikā-s of Gaudapada and given an account of how Advaita and Buddhism differ.

I thank my friend Sri Pramod Bharadwaj for his effort in making this document in a convenient pdf format from a larger book of the author.

  

Says Dr.A.V.Nagasampige, noted scholar of Dvaita Vedanta and Director, pUrNaprajna samshodhana mandiram, Bangalore, in his very popular Kannada book 'mata traya sameekShA':  

  

``` On page 51 it carries a heading: Is AdvaitavAda Bauddhadarshana? On page 54 there is a heading : Bauddhas are pracchanna vaidikas.  It says:

The charge that Advaita has been influenced by Buddhist thinking has been stiffly refuted by Shankara, Vachaspatimishra, SarvajnAtmamuni, ShrIharsha, Anandabodha etc.  They have brought out the doctrinal differences between the two schools.  This section goes on to substantiate this statement by several quotes from these Advaita Acharyas' works.  It concludes: 
//Therefore since Buddhists accepted the Vedic formulation of NirviShesha Chaitanya they are 'pracchanna vaidika-s.'  //

// ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ವೇದದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ನಿರ್ವಿಶೇಷ ಚೈತನ್ಯದ ಪರಿಕಲ್ಪನೆಯನ್ನು ಒಪ್ಪಿದ ಬೌದ್ಧರು ’ಪ್ರಚ್ಛನ್ನವೈದಿಕರು.’//

Vidwan K.P. Babudas of Kalady, Kerala, while delivering his talk at the annual vdiwat sadas at Sringeri last year, 2011, said:

// यदुक्तं शून्यवादिनः सकाशात् मायावादिनः वैलक्षण्यं नास्तीति तत्रोच्यते । वस्तुतः एते बौद्धाः उपनिषदः अवलम्ब्यैव स्वसिद्धान्तं चक्रुः । किन्तु तेषां कापट्यात् औपनिषदोऽयं सिद्धान्त इति तैर्नोक्तम् । वयं तु श्रौतोऽयम् इत्युक्त्वैव  अस्मद्दर्शनं प्रदर्शयाम इति वैलक्षण्यं तेषां सकाशात् । उभयोः दर्शनयोः अधिष्ठानं उपनिषद एव इत्यतः क्वचित् क्वचित् साम्यमिव भवति । // 

The word 'shUnya' is listed as one of the names of Brahman by Sri Paramashivendra Saraswati (the preceptor of Sri Sadashivendra Saraswati of Nerur) in his work:

वेदान्तनामरत्नसहस्त्रम्’ [a book of a thousand names of Brahman culled out from the Vedanta']: शून्यम् - पारतत्त्र्यादिदोषरहितं निर्विशेषं वा ।  तदुक्तं वासिष्ठे -

शून्यं तत् प्रकृतिर्माया ब्रह्म विज्ञानमित्यपि । शिवः पुरुष ईशानो नित्यमात्मेति कथ्यते ॥ इति ।

स्वप्रकाशमानन्दघनं शून्यमभवत् इति श्रुतिः ।  उक्तं च पाद्मे पुराणे - 
यं दृष्ट्वा योगिनो नित्यं सन्तृप्ताः स्वात्मसंस्थितम् । अक्षरं सदसच्छून्यं परमात्मानमीश्वरम्॥ इति । 

There is also the verse from the मत्तविलासप्रहसनम् -

वेदान्तेभ्यो गृहीत्वार्थान् यो महाभारतादपि । विप्राणांमिषतामेवकृतवान् कोशसञ्चयम् ॥ 

Mahendravarman in his work 'mattavilAsaprahasanam' says this about the coming into being of the Buddhistic system: ```

//Taking material from the UpaniShads and also from the MahAbhArata (which includes the BhagavadgItA), Buddha, even as the brAhmaNa-s (vaidika-s) were wide awake, accomplished a great fortune - literally filled up his coffers - (of establishing a vibrant system).//  
  
Thus, in order to sustain a system, there has to be a kriyA/karma/anuShThAna aspect which too has been derived by the Buddhists from the sanAtana dharma that is the vedic religion.

  

Also, the charge that Shankara's knowledge of the Madhyamika doctrine was superficial extends to even Kumarila Bhatta and further to Veda Vyasa himself who aphorized on the Bauddha doctrine in the Brahmasutras and also in the alleged verses of the Padma purana. 

  

Here is an opinion:

  

<http://orkut.google.com/c43245114-t19700091f3d59685.html>  

  

//Kumarila argued that the Buddhist wasclaiming that the universe was non-existent. This, in a lot of ways wasconsistent with his literal Sanskrit understanding of the wordShunya(literally 'zero'), found in the PaliCanon and well commented by several later Buddhists. It is noteworthy here,that thePali canon says that'samsara' is characterized as 'anicca' (impermanent, not momentary). *Further,**the Mimamsic (andVedantic)*

*understanding of Shunya is inconsistent with the meaning as described in the  
Pali Canon.* (emphasis mine)

KumarilaBhatta's understanding of Buddhist school was far greater than that of any  
other non-Buddhist philosopher at the time. His junior contemporary Sankara  
(whom most modern Vedantists consider to be greater) also did not understand  
Buddhism so well.//
