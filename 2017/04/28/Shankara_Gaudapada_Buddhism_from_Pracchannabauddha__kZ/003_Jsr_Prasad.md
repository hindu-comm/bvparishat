Thanks to Vidvan Sri Subramanian ji for this excellent post with quite significant links and quotations from great scholars. I have been wondering, why it can't be the other way round, as many concepts are similar in both systems; say, for instance, मा हिंस्याः सर्वा भूतानि.. at vyaavahaarika level and nirvisesha-caitanya at paaramarthika level. Views of H.H. SSS, Prof. Nagasampige, Prof. Babudas, Swami Parameshwarananda Saraswati and views from Mattavilasa-prahasana thoroughly substantiate the realities of the '*pracchanna-vaidikataa'* of Buddhists.  

  
"...KumarilaBhatta's understanding of Buddhist school was far greater than that of any other non-Buddhist philosopher at the time. His junior contemporary Sankara (whom most modern Vedantists consider to be greater) also did not understand Buddhism so well."  
  

The above comment (though from a blog post) is subject to debate. Kumarila Bhatta himself went to study Buddhist study in disguise. Upon found guilty, he was asked by Buddhists to jump from the fort to see whether his belief in Vedas could protect him. He was a staunch believer though, committed a mistake by uttering - '*यदि* वेदाः प्रमाणम्...'  
  

Regards.
