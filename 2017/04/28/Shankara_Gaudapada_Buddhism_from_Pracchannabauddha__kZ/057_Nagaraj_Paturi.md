Being blinded by' is an idiom. It means'being too overwhelmed by a certain observation to be able to see/understand anything beyond that. It is not a personal quality of an individual. It is a comment on the observation made as part of an argument. Comment made on the reasoning, reasoning method, observation as part of a discussion well within the norms of a discussion.

  

Any reasoning by a participant in a discussion based on the personal attributes /features of the opponent or a negative comment on the personal attributes/features of the opponent is considered to be personal attack. I did not do anything that deserves to be called personal attack.

  

Hence your statement that I made3 a personal attack is a baseless allegation.
