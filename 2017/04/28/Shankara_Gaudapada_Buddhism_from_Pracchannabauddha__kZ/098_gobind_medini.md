This is the most problematic position which orthodox Advaitins take. Tradition is no guarantee for correctness. This fact has been accepted by muNDaka upaniShad (1.2.8), kaTha upaniShad (1.2.5) as well as in Canki Sutta of Madhyama Nikaya (MN 95). Interestingly all these use the analogy of "blind leading the blind". In fact muNDaka call such stanch ritualists-traditionalists as mahAmUDha. We can view upaniShad-s themselves in that sense a break from certain parts of Vedic traditions. So there is no need to deprecate Buddhism as abandoning the tradition. Buddhists do not accept Vedas as the authority because (a) the possibility of "blind leading the blind" greatly exists in any long, unbroken, unreformed tradition, (2) they do not accept apauruSheyatva of any texts, (3) they do not accept animal sacrifices. Even sAnkhya, the Astika (vaidika) tradition calls Vedas avishuddha (not very pure) for this reason though they consider Vedas as Apta. This is quite a rational position which is not acceptable to any of the AchAryas of vedAnta (whether advaita, v.advaita, bhedAbheda, or dvaita vedAnta. So be it, but most of contemporary Hindus are quite comfortable with the position of sAnkhya where vedas are Apta-vAkya but there authority is not unlimited.
