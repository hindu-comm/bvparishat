This is like calling vandhyAputra and an existent Devadatta as siblings or twins! Moreover, just because Advaita rejects everything other than Atman based on Shruti, and Buddhism rejects everything including Atman, based on nothing, it doesn't mean that Buddhism is "ahead" of Advaita Vedanta. This is like saying that since dvaitins assert everything as real, if someone goes on to say that vandhyAputra is also real, then that person would be ahead of dvaitins.

  

I couldn't find the exact mail in this thread since I read through them all only today, where someone said that Buddhism and Advaita have only one difference, the former rejects Atman while the latter accepts it. This is like saying that an equation that tends to zero is equal to an equation that tends to infinity!
