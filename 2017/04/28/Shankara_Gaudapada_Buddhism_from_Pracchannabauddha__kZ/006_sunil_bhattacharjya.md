Namaste.  
  

Further to my last mail, please permit me to add that I did not claim that Adi Shankara criticised the teachings of Buddha indiscriminately.. Where Gaudapada expressed similar sentiments to Mahayana. Adi Shankara kept mum and that is "maunam sanmati lakshanam". At the same time Adi Shankara did criticize Dignaga and Dharmakirti, the latter being Adi Shanka's senior contemporary. .
