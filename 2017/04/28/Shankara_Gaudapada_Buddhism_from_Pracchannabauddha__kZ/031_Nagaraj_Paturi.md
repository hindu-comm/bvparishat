\>all statements which treat Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu are post-Shankaran and even Ramanuja did not seem to be familiar with them.  

  

Ramanuja is post-Sankaran. He can not'seem to be familiar with them'.

  

tataḥ kalau sampravṛtte sammohāya sura-dviṣām।

buddho nāmnāñjana-sutaḥ kīkaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati॥

— srimad-bhagavatam, 1.3.24

  

Ramanuja was familiar with Bhagavata Purana.
