Sri Prasadji  
  
I have no personal interest in this debate on the meaning of the word sugata. But out of curiosity, I checked some Sanskrit diictionaries online. Apparently, the word sugata can mean a buddhist or a buddhist teacher or buddha himself. The Monier-Williams dictionary gives references for the former two meanings, which anyone is welcome to verify.
