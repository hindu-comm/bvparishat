Prof. Mahesh Chandra Nyayaratna in his very brief and excellent work, 'Brief Notes on the Modern Nyaya System of Philosophy and its Technical Terms,' gives a nice example on *paramparaa-sambandha* as follows -  
  

स्वसम्राडधिकृतराज्यत्वसम्बन्धेन भारतवर्षीयाः सर्व्वे एव आर्य्या अनार्य्याश्ट *इंलण्डे* सन्ति; इंलण्डीयाश्च तत्र स्थिता अपि स्वराज्येश्वरीसाम्राज्यसम्बन्धेन *भारतवर्षे* तिष्ठन्तीति ।  
  

Is this possible in reality? Possible, only in logic. Once, respected Prof. Vineet Chiatanya Ji told us an example about the impropriety of logic:  

  
All *animals* can fly  

*Elephant* is animal  

Therefore, *elephant can fly*!  

  
Such things that you argue belongs to logical fallacies.
