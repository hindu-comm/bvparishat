//  
If presence of many similarities between schools is enough reason to say that school X is pracchanna-y school,//  
  
Here, the question is whether the similarities are due to following a common set of scriptures or whether it is because of influence of one school over the other. For buddhism and advaita, the former is ruled out. Only the latter possibility remains.
