1\. Puranas which consider Buddha as one of the avatAra-s, consider him to be an avatAra of VishNu and of no other dEva. Buddha, as per this view, is, like any other avatAra of VishNu, is prachhannavishNu. This kind of expression is explicitly used in the case of gOpAla rUpa of VishNu, through expressions such as kuhanAgOpa etc. VaishNavas following the perspective of Buddha as an avataara of VishNu consider that such an avataara had a purpose. Since Bauddha (doctrine) had a 'strategic' purpose, as per this view, probably being Bauddha in hiding / Bauddha in disguise is also viewed as a strategic activity and probably, the word prachhannabauddha is not used in a pejorative sense, by the followers of the buddhaavataara view, because of this reason

  

2\. It seems that since Buddha is pracchannaVishNu and S'ankara is prachhannabuddha , S'ankara is prachhannavishNu.
