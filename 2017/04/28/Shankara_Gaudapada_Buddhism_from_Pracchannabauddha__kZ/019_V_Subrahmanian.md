The word*pracchanna-bauddha,* in my humble opinion, is not apt at all since it at once reveals that the both the systems bauddham and advaitam have not been understood correctly and distinctly. I have noticed that in the present day, in public platforms when non-advaitins speak, they carefully state the difference between the two systems lest they should be dubbed as misrepresenting Advaita or not knowing the clear difference between the two systems. I recall a very recent instance where a highly respected scholar of Dvaita Vedanta, Dr. D.Prahladachar, while addressing the gathering at the symposium on Nagarjuna's Mula Madhyamika Karikas, in the Institute of World Culture, Bangalore, said: While both Buddhism and Advaita hold the world to be mithya, the latter clearly states that the world is a superimposition on the substratum Brahman that is eternal.

  

Non-advaitins while expounding their classical texts to their followers might not give up the*pracchanna-bauddha* remarks found in their books and even while writing new commentaries/glosses would hold to it but when it comes to public discourse where a general audience is present, such a remark is carefully avoided.

In the present day discussions of the three schools of Vedanta, Advaitins are also invariably included. If only they are really seen as 'veda-vāda-cchadma...' and therefore to be kept away, the symposiums as we see commonly arranged today, should have taken a different form. I have seen that non-advaitins scholars are seated together with Advaitin scholars even while food is served. If they are seen as those only pretending to be vaidika-s but not really so, the practice of a non-advaitin orthodox scholar resorting to an orthodox advaitin scholar's house for a temporary stay (where it is not otherwise possible), and accept the hospitality for svayam pāka would be out of place. The practice is vice-versa too.

  

Thus, in my opinion, that remark is at best a thing of the past and only academic in nature and no more than that.

One has to be told as to in which work Sriharsha says this.
