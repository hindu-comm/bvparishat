- //Science does not know many things that can be 'known' from things other than scripture, simply becauseit is not within its domain to know them.//

  

Examples? If you are referring to economic theories, then their domain is naturalistic and you would still need to show their validity using scientific methods. Such theories are also falsifiable and can justifiably be scientific, though pure sciences do not deal with them.
