In which science is there a statement it does not accept ghosts? At the most, it can be said that all branches of science are silent about ghosts, Atman etc.

  

Being silent about a topic has two possible reasons:

  

1\. It does not belong there. It does not fall within the scope of the law, act, field , branch of science etc.

  

2\. It belongs there. But it did not take it up for study.

  

A statement that 'MV Act is silent about conditions for divorce' does not make sense. Equally 'since MV Act is silent about conditions for divorce, I conclude that law is silent about conditions for divorce' is also not correct.

  

Similarly 'Economics does not accept inertia of bodies', 'Phisics does not accept elasticity of demand' is also not correct.
