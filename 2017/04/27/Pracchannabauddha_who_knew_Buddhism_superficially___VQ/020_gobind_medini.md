Dear Shri Deshpande,  
  

To my knowledge, the similarities (verbatim or otherwise) of bhAviveka citations and G-kArikA verses have been noted and discussed earlier by likes of Lindtner and King (as you would of course know). Hyoung Ham's dissertation, however, must be giving some fresh insights and should make an interesting reading. (There are similarities between G-K and mUla-mAdhyamaka-kArikA (M-K) verses as well where the chronological sequence is more clear).  
  

There is no denying the fact that G-K (Vedanta) is rooted in aupaniShad Brahman while Mahayana (mAdhyamaka, yogAchAra,and their sub-schools) are based on pratItysamutpAda. To use the modern terminology, one is essentialist while the other is processual. The secondary Vedanta doctrine of adhiShThAna differentiates the two at the level of vyavahAra (in the world of transactions and motion).  
  

Vedanta could have used (and even today can use) "pratItyasamutpAda" and whole of M-K as one of its prakriyA-s like avasthAtraya, dehatraya, samanta-visheSha, anvaya-vyatireka etc to pedagogically teach the Atman=Brahman doctrine of non-dualism. Vedanta has already done this kind of adoptive assimilation in case of two Astika schools (sAnkhya and yoga). There is however, one difference. Vedanta has to accept that causality can happen in various ways in a "dependency framework". Thus, pratItyasamutpAda can co-exist with satkArya-vAda, AraMbha-vAda etc. It does not "cause" any violence to Atman=Brahman in the dependency framework.  
  
Mahayana can do the same to include Vedanta in its scheme of things because nirvisheSha Brahman will give existential support to whatever Mahayana does in a reasonable way. Brahman giving support to anything is truism but Brahman giving support to anything reasonable is a better truism :-)  
  
Whether Shankara was prachChanna bauddha or bhAviveka was prachChanna Vedantin becomes irrelevant then. Of course all this is my personal opinion.
