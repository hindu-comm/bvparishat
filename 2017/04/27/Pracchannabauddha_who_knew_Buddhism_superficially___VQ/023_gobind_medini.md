It is not a simple restatement. Just state pratItya-samutpAda from Sutta Nikaya (SN 12.15 or SN 12.61) and see it for yourself. The more natural connection of shUnya is with anatta or anAtmA (see [here](http://buddhism-guide.com/buddhism/sunyata.htm)). But principle of anatta is ok with Vedanta because the self of Vedanta is different than Self (Atman). The small "self" is just an AbhAsa. It is anAtmA only. Although Vedanta is termed as essentialist philosophy, the essence (substratum, meaning) of the thing is ultimately provided by Brahman as an appearance without itself undergoing any change.

See above. How do you differentiate between emptiness of attributes and emptiness of svabhAva? Atman (Brahman) is non-relational even in Vedanta. As I said earlier, even the triad of sat-chit-Ananda the so called character or svarUpa-laxaNa of Brahman also must drop out finally although it is the closest and convenient description of Atman=Brahman. Its main purpose is to negate non-existence, non-sentience, limitedness. Atman is beyond sat-asat. It is supra-conceptual (or rather anti-conceptual).

Why complicate the matter? I am only saying if mAdhyamaka is charged as nihilist then Vedanta too cannot escape from that charge. Vedanta in fact is better placed in this regard. MMK/Buddhism nominalizes even paramArtha and spirituality while Vedanta accepts both though from the point of view of vyavahAra. See the link provided. Also, see the wiki for nihilism.
