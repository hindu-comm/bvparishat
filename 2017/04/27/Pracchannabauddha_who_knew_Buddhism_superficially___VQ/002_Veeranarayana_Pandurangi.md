I am afraid of that western interpretation/criticism of Shankara's critique of Buddhism is somehow not upto the mark.

  

recently I had to "an evaluation of vedantic critique of buddhism" by Gregory Darling MLBD reprint 2007, where author has accused vedantins to be misrepresenting the madhyamikas as nihilists. But as we see Madhyamikakarika and many shlokas quoted by Madhvacarya and attributed to Madhyamikas, the fact is opposite to what is claimed by Darling.

Hence I request all of you to tread carefully while accepting the gospel truth of western researchers be it yamakami or karashima or somebody else.
