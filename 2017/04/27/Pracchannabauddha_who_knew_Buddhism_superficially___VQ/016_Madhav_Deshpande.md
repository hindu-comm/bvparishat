Dear Shri Gobind Medini,

  

  Thanks for pointing to the earlier Buddhist sources, and especially referring to Bhāvaviveka (also known as Bhāviveka). One of my students, Dr. Hyoung Ham, in his recently completed doctoral dissertation discusses Bhāvaviveka's comments about Vedānta. They are especially significant, since Bhāvaviveka predates Śaṅkara. Here is a passage from this dissertation:

  

"We also observe Bhāviveka’s inclusivistic attitude toward the Vedāntins in other chapters of MHK. As he confronts the Śrāvakas’ attempt to exclude Mahāyāna from the Buddha’s teaching (*buddhokti*) by likening it to the system of Vedānta (*vedāntadarśana*), Bhāviveka surprisingly acknowledges the similarity between (Mahāyāna) Buddhist and Vedāntic teachings, but only in an inclusivistic way: “Everything that is well spoken in the Vedānta is taught by the Buddha.”375 Criticizing previous interpretations of this half-verse of Bhāviveka, Qvarnström (1989, 103) states: “Gokhale, Nakamura and others take this to mean that Bhavya had a favorable attitude towards the Vedāndadarśana, but in the light of MHK/TJ 8.86 the intention is quite the reverse.” MHK/TJ 8.86 on the basis of which Qvarnström is critical of the other interpretation, however, merely draws out what is implied in MHK 4.56. While the latter only alludes to the Buddhist origin of “well spoken” (*sūkta*) Vedāntic teachings, the former explicitly states that the Vedāntins longed for the impeccable Buddhist teachings and made it their own.376 Both passages show that Bhāviveka acknowledged certain good points in the tenets of Vedānta and then asserted their Buddhist origin."

So the debate over who borrowed from whom is an old debate pre-dating Śaṅkara by a century or two, and then it continues after him. A long-term non-partisan review of these debates points both to similarities and differences, and how each tradition saw itself in relation to others.
