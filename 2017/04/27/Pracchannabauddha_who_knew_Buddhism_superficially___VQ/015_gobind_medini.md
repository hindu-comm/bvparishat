I have not gone into the details of Darling's evaluation of Vedanta critique but the summary dismissal of mAdhyamaka (even w/o mentioning its name or mentioning mUla-mAdhyamaka-kArikA) looks rather unfair. This is what Shankara says, vide BS II.2.32:  
  

// More ever, by the Buddha (the well-gone One, the Su-gata) teaching the mutually contradictory triad - the doctrine of the outer object-entity, the doctrine of consciousness, the doctrine of void - there is made evident the in connection with himself the existence of the unconnected talk, or hatred for all people (with the intent that) these people should be confused by the assertion of contradictory significances.//  
  

Those who have studied Buddhism with historical perspective may argue:  
  

1\. Early Buddhism before the advent of Mahayana schools was positivist without a trace of nihilism or malevolence (e.g. Majjhima Nikaya MN.II.63: "Advice to Malukhyanaputta" with the famous "arrow parable" where Buddha insists on alleviation of sufferings before analysis of Arrow; and MN.1.63&72 where he refuses to answer metaphysical questions which had no direct bearing on day-to-day life).  
  

2\. If Mahayana (2nd phase of Buddhism) was nihilist and/or confusing to ordinary people, Advaita Vedanta itself cannot escape the same charge. Both are mithyA at the saMvriti level (vyavahAra) and empty (of attributes and guNa) as Brahman or shUnya. Both accept ajAta/ajAti vAda with nihilist declarations. Yes, Brahman is the existential base of Jagat but then it violates the via-negativa of BU 3.8.8 and other neti neti Adesha mantra-s of BU. As such, adhiShThAna argument should be treated as conceptual (lower) truth converging on "sat" of the sachchidAnanda triad.  
  

3\. Shankara seems to be unaware of the third phase of Buddhism or 2nd phase of Mahayana development when Mahayana assumed absolutist purport and almost became identical to Advaita though with a different terminology. Three texts are noteworthy in this connection: (a) ratnagotravibhAga or uttaratantra, (b) shraddhotpAda shAstra, (c) bhAvaviveka.  
  
The last text (bhAvaviveka) is said to be 6th century text; so, absolutist Mahayana was probably developed before or contemporaneous to gauDapAda but most probably before Shankara.  
  

Considering the possible contemporaneity of the two, it is difficult to say who followed whom. Instead their followers should celebrate their similarity and mutual connection (including competition, sibling rivalry, or whatever).
