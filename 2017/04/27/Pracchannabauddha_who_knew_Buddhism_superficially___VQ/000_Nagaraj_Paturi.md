To avoid digression in the thread on Kumarila’s name I am posting this as a new thread.



Shankara-ji’s book by Sri Peri Sarveshwara Sharma certainly helps in Kumarila’s name issue. 



But I am not able to help sharing that I am appalled at the blatant self-contradiction in the following two immediately sequential sentences of the author Sri Peri Sarveshwara Sharma: 



The nickname *pracchannabauddha* which was applied to śaṅkara by vaiṣṇavas ( and by Vijnānabhikṣu ) and in certain Purāṇas was not unfounded. But it seems as Prof. Yamakami has brilliantly shown in his Systems of Buddhist Thought that śankara’s knowledge of Buddhist thought was naturally superficial, in as much as he has no access to the secrets of Buddhist teachings. 



These two sentences are similar to



The nickname *Marxist in disguise* given to X by non-Marxists and other such ideologues is not unfounded. But it seems as Prof. Y has brilliantly shown in his “……” that X’s knowledge of Marxist thought was naturally superficial, in as much as he had no access to the secrets of Marxist ideas.
