Agreed.

anAtman pertains only to living things. It may be easy for understanding purposes, but philosophically, it is incomplete. The mAdhyamika would deny an essence for anything - living or non-living.

I disgaree here. Being recorded in the earliest texts does not make something more basic. While I agree that PS is most basic, I would say PS is equally as basic as Nagarjuna's ShUnyatA.

The essence is not the small self but the Atman itself.

I am sorry. This sort of reasoning is not true IMO. I cannot deny myself, but that does mean that I cannot deny the Atman. If it were the case as you say, Science would have accepted Atman. Even advaita vedAnta says that the Atman can be known only through scriptures and not through perception or inference.
