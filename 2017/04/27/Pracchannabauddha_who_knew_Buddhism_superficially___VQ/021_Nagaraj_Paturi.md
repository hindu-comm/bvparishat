Following mail from Sri Kalyan K bounced:

  

//2. If Mahayana (2nd phase of Buddhism) was nihilist and/or confusing to ordinary people, Advaita Vedanta itself cannot escape the same charge. Both are mithyA at the saMvriti level (vyavahAra) and empty (of attributes and guNa) as Brahman or shUnya. Both accept ajAta/ajAti vAda with nihilist declarations//  

  

Dear Sri Gobind, ShunyA of Nagarjuna is just a restatement of pratItyasamutpAda of Buddha. It has no connection with nirvishesha Atman. Emptiness does not indicate emptiness of attributes, but is an emptiness of eternal svabhAva. Hence by definition, emptiness rules out the Atman, which is eternal. 

  

Regarding your statements about nihilism, there are many forms of nihilism - political, moral, metaphysical, epistemological and existential. Which form of nihilism do you think is the mAdhyamaka preaching?

  

Regards
