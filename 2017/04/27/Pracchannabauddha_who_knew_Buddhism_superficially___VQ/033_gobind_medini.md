anAtmA pertains only to living thing? I don't think so. Check it out.

What is there to disagree? Buddha-vachanas have higher priority (though not absolute one like Vedas). Nagarjuna himself accepts his vachanas as basic. Further, a particular type of shUnyata may be basic to mahAyAna but not to all bauddha schools. In fact in the dvAdasha-nidAna and pancha-siddhAnta which are acceptable to all bauddha schools (cf. text book of Indian philosophy by S. H. Dikshit and must be there in other philosophy books): there is no mention of shUnyatA but there is mention of anAtmA. You can derive shUnya from PS by a particular reasoning but not the other way round.  
  

This is what a Bodhisattva says "Whoever sees dependent co-arising see the dhamma; whoever sees dhamma sees dependent co-arising" (Majjima Nikaya 28; Nagao 1991). You need to study Buddhism carefully.

This Atman (Brahman) is not any particular essence but a substratum (adhiShThAna) of entire Universe. So, FAPP only small self is to be considered as essence of jIva. And remember, we have only this FAPP level available for all our transactions and conceptions.

Yes, at your (subjective) level you can deny Atman (Brahman) but you cannot deny "small self" because you cannot deny your own existence. So you have to first explain where from this self comes. You have to do this exercise before you reach the level of Atman. You can of course make use of science to first explain this self (FAPP, empirical consciousness, subjective integrity of experience and qualia).
