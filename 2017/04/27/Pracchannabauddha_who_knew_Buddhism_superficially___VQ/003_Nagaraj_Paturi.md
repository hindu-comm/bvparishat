Yes, it is that double negative which is the problem. Not unfounded means (well) founded. In essence, it means The nickname. pracchannabauddha .... is (well) founded.

  

Dictionary meaning:

  

**well founded**

*adjective*

1.  

    

    

    

    

    (especially of a suspicion or belief) based on good evidence or
    reasons.

    

    

    "their apprehensions were well founded"

    

    

    

    

    

  

As a result,

  

The nickname pracchannabauddha ........ is based on good evidence or reasons.

  

Then, if Prof. Yamakami says, S'ankara's knowledge of Buddhism is superficial, how can S'ankara be a Bauddha?

  

If he is not a Bauddha, how can he be a Pracchannabauddha?
