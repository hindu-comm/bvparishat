1\. Enlightenment will take time but simple information should suffice :-)  
  
Yes, anatta started from living beings by denying their self or soul. Even in Vedic traditions Atman started with living beings as jIvAtmA but eventually applied to non-living things as bhUtAtmA and for aggregated things in the names of various deities like virAja, hiraNyagarbha etc. Similarly in Buddhism anatta started with living beings but soon generalized for all beings (really becomings) forming the one of the principles of pancha-siddhAnta (sarvamanAtman). Others are sarvam xaNikam, sarvam dukkham, sarvam svalaxaNam, and nirvaNam shAntam.  
  

2\. I have already stated that shUnyata can be derived from PS but not the other way round. I have also given you references and they carry weights more than your or my opinion.  
  

3\. Vedanta says that small self (individual consciousness) and Self (undifferentiated acosmic Consciousness) are closely related. One is the close semblance of other. Science has already tried and still trying to explore it without any success and many of the scientists and philosophers are of the view that science will never be able to exclaim it. These include noble prize winner neurophysiologists cum philosopher like John Eccles and neuroscientist cum philosopher like Gerhard Roth. Madhyamaka faced this problem quite early at the philosophical level. In this respect Advaita Vedanta offers a better explanatory (epistemic) potential over the old Madhyamaka of Nagarjuna. Anti-conceptual Brahman can be hypothesized to fill the epistemic gaps. Yes, it the god-of-the-gap but it all depends on how we fill the gaps (hypothesize our postulates). Buddhism had their own platonic concepts like Pudgala and Vigyapti to fill the cognitive gaps, but then why not accept Atman and hypothesize it as jIva-sAxin or as the reducer of the Schroedinger wave function? Think about it.
