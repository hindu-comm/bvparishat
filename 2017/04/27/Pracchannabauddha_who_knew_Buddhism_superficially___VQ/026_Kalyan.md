How is shUnyatA same as pratItya samutpAda? To understand this, we must note that given any X, X cannot have an eternal svabhAva that is eternally dependent on something else. The svabhAva of X must be independent of anything else. Otherwise it would cease to be svabhAva and becomes parabhAva. But according to pratItya samutpAda, X originates dependantly. Hence X is devoid of svabhAva and is shUnya. Hence shUnyatA and pratItyasamutpAda are one and the same thing.
