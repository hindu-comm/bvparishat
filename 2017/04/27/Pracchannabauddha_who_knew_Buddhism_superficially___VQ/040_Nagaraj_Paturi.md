--Absolutey!

  

That is why I don't say Science does not acceptflying spagetti monster.

  

If I consider ghosts, Atman, flying spagetti monster or whatever are like vandhyaaputra, gaganakusuma, s'as'avishaaNa, I don't say, Science does not accept these that is why these don't exist. I say that these are misnomers. I don't need to bring Science to say that.
