AadaraNIya Sri Gobind Medini-ji,

  

Email lists like BVP , which are outside the institutional set up like the Sanskrit Universities, Sanskrit departments of other universities, Philosophy departments, newly emerging Indology, Indic studies departments in a few Indian universities are providing opportunity for the society to how big is the number of amazingly learned persons outside the institutional set up. For the scholars outside the system too, these forums provide opportunity to interact among themselves and with great stalwarts who are open to interact with scholars irrespective of whether they are affiliated with institutions are not.

  

Many younger members like you, Sri Kalyan K-ji are with technology background and technology career. It gives great pleasure to see how you are all putting so much of your efforts in these monetarily not so rewarding fields, taking time out of your career preoccupations and are excelling in them.

  

We already had/knew a huge number of younger BVP members whose colossal scholarship in Sanskrit and shastras like Vyakarana, Nyaya, Vedanta and Mimamsa gets reflected in their posts, most of them being from technology and management and such careers only.

  

What was refreshing in your posts was the addition of Buddhism - scholarship to that list of areas of expertise.

  

Particularly, you seem to be erudite in Vedanta, Waarikari and other such areas of Indian thought too.

  

All of you give a great hope for the future studies of Indian knowledge systems which are the focus of BVP.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
