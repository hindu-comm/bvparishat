It does not need to be there explicitly. It is implicit. Science is inherently naturalistic and does not accept anything supernatural because the supernatural has zero evidence so far, in its favor.

Elasticity of demand is not a supernatural theory for Science to reject. Science accepts it if it has evidence in favor of it. If Economics is not based on evidence, then it is useless.
