\>You are free to say that science does not accept flying spaghetti monster because...well..science really does not accept it. (This is not to say that science rejects it).

  

\>I am not saying whatever is not accepted by science does not exist.

  

There you go!

  

'This is not to say that science rejects it' applies to Atman too.

  

\> Just that if its existence can be "known" from anything other than scripture, then science would have known it and accepted it.  

  

-- Science does not know many things that can be 'known' from things other than scripture, simply becauseit is not within its domain to know them.
