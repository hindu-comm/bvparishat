Happy to see these two youngsters of our country being well read in Buddhism, one of the greatest achievements of ancient Indian knowledge systems. Professors such as Dipak Bhatacharya, Madhav Deshpande and others have a well established track record in this. Younger generation developing erudition in this area is heartening and promising.

  

Wish they continue their study to reach greater heights with jijñāsā rather than vijigīṣā.
