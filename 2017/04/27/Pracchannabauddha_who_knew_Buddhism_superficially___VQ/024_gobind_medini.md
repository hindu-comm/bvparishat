Shri Kalyan K,  
  

Just to clarify..  
  

I am not calling mAdhyamaka or yogAchAra as nihilist devoid of any moral content. All Buddhist schools accept Arya-satya, dvAdasha nidAna, and yoga values of maitri, karuNA, muditA, and upexA and in that sense they are highly moral.  
  

I am also not suggesting that they are vainAshika (destructionist) the way AchArya Shankara describes them in 2,2,32. Being essence-less does not mean being devoid of existence or vinAsha (destruction). In fact I am pointing out that Vedanta's position is not much different when it says that jagat is vivarta on Brahman like a imagined snake in a rope or silver in a shell. This is what I mean when I say though Vedanta is said to be an essentialist theosophy, its essence is dependent on non-relational Brahman. In that sense it will not be incorrect to say that world objects in themselves do not have essence or independent existence. Brahman is the provider of essence (meaning, existence) (praGYAne pratiShThitam, praGYA pratiShThA, praGYAnam brahma iti) (aitareya 3.3)
