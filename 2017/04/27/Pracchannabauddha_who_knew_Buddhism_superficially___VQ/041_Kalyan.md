You are free to say that science does not accept flying spaghetti monster because...well..science really does not accept it. (This is not to say that science rejects it).

  

I am not saying whatever is not accepted by science does not exist. Nor am I saying Atman is like vAndhyaputra. Just that if its existence can be "known" from anything other than scripture, then science would have known it and accepted it.
