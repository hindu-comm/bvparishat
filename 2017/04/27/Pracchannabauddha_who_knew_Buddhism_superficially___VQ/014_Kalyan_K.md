Dear Sri Pandurangi  
  
  
//I am afraid of that western interpretation/criticism of Shankara's critique of Buddhism is somehow not upto the mark. //  
  
//recently I had to "an evaluation of vedantic critique of buddhism" by Gregory Darling MLBD reprint 2007, where author has accused vedantins to be misrepresenting the madhyamikas as nihilists. But as we see Madhyamikakarika and many shlokas quoted by Madhvacarya and attributed to Madhyamikas, the fact is opposite to what is claimed by Darling.//  
  
  
Is it your contention that the vedAntins dont represent mAdhyamakas as nihilists? Or do you want to say that mAdhyamakas are really nihilists?  
  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
