Dear Sri Gobind

  

The ShUnyata that I aware of, is the one taught by Nagarjuna. This is simply a re-statement of Buddha's pratItyasamutpAda. See for instance, MMK 24.18, where Nagarjuna equates the two. Or you can refer to your own link under the section "ShUnyata in Nagarjuna", which essentially says the same thing. It is Nagarjuna's brilliance that he is able to re-formulate what Buddha says in the concept of Shunya.

  

anatta (anAtma) is not a fundamendal concept. It can be derived from shunyata or pratItyasamutpAda.

  

The small self or jIva in advaita vedAnta is nothing but the Atman endowed with the upAdhi of avidya. So advaita vedAnta is still essentialist.

  

Whether lack of attributes (as in nirvishesha Atman) implies lack of svabhAva, is a question for which I have no answer. Advaita thinks it does not imply. Others think it implies. In any case, I wont say shUnya of Nagarjuna has anything to do with nirvishesha Atman of advaita or the upanishads.

  

//Why complicate the matter? I am only saying if mAdhyamaka is charged as nihilist then Vedanta too cannot escape from that charge. //

  

I am not complicating things. I am just curious to know which brand of nihilism both would fall into, if they are indeed nihilist. I dont consider nihilism as necessarily a bad thing. Certain forms of it may be. But others are not so.

  

Regards

Kalyan
