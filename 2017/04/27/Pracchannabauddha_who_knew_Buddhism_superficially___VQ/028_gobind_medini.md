If you read my earlier posts carefully you will notice that I'm treating pratItyasamutpAda (PS) as the fundamental concept of all bauddha schools. In fact SN 12.15 which I quoted earlier is one of the earliest statement of PS as well as dvAdasha-nidAna which is a kind of mission statement for all Bauddha schools. However, PS = shUnya is not intuitive (similar to jIva = brahman of Advaita is not intuitive). In comparison both anAtmA and shUnya can be easily understood as lack of essence.

Please read my above comment. PS is more basic than shUnya because it is recorded in the earliest Buddha-vachana-s. Yes, shUnya is its restatement variously formulated (some of the formulations taking essentialist purport as in tathAgatagarbha, tathatA, ratnagotra etc).

That is fine but this essence (small self) is an appearance (AbhAsa in vArtika school, pratibiMba in vivaraNa school, and adhyAsa in bhAmati school) of . So, though you may call Advaita as essentialist this essence is provided by Brahman without any change in itself and without any intention (hetu) or meaning (artha).

As I said earlier, Atman (Self) is non-relational and anti-conceptual (Absolute). Since for all practical purpose (FAPP) , you cannot deny your existence (and hence small self in the form of integrity of experience) you cannot deny Atman (the big Self) whose appearance the small self is. So Advaita says, self, and Self has to be admitted FAPP whether Nagarjuna or anybody likes it or not.
