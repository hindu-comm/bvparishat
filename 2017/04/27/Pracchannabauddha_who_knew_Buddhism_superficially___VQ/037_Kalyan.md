Feel free to enlighten me.

Here the question is not whether somebody's words carry more weightage than others, but the question is whether the concepts are fundamental or derived.

That which is not PS, is not shUnya since it must have an eternal svabhAva, it being neither dependant on anything else nor originated from anything else. Therefore, that which is shUnya is PS. (statement and its contrapositive have same truth value) This shows the equivalence of PS and shunyata.

I agree. I am more familiar with Nagarjuna's brand of Buddhism.

The substratum and essence are the same because the upAdhis are mithya.

It comes from the brain. I believe that is where neuroscience is searching for the small self.
