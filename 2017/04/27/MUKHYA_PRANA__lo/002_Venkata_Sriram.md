Dear Madhav,

  

There is a beautiful uttaradi mutt in Hyderabad at Kachiguda which consists of "mukhya prANa devata". A very pleasant deity and a peaceful place to meditate. There is a vidya peetha also called "satyapramoda vidya peetha" which consists of veda pathashaala and go shaala.
Currently, Shri.Jayatirtha Acharya Ji is running the vedic school. Rg & yajur veda are being taught and senior students are taught the dvaita siddhanta followed by nyaya sudha and parimala. 

  

You can contact them and visit the mutt during weekends. Here is the link:

This is my favourite place in Hyderabad. Usually, while returning back home from office, I visit this place and the premises always reverberates with vedic chants and bhAgavata parayanam.

  

regs,

sriram
