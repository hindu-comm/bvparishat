Dhanyavada Raichur Achar mahaoday. Definitely i will take your help.

Thanks Shankara mahoday for your links.

  

Dhanyavada pradeepa Simha ji.

  

I have a doubt . Where are research papers and thesis available on Sanskrit and related research subjects. Is research in Any areas(like kavyas,vedas,darshanas and vedanta) is same as We do in Mathematics or physics where we quote references from phd thesis and research papers and take help of these topics.

  

Where can i find these.

  

Thanks and Regards.

Madhav
