Abhyankarji,I am not sure if this helps you: It is a participle of the perfect tense, liT. It is derived from the base of the perfect tense: tuShTaava->tuShTu->tuShTuvas. It is declined in masculine gender as follows: tuShTuvaan, tuShTuvaamsau, tuShTuvaamsah. Examples for the use of this participle in Valmiki: upeyivaan uttamaraajakanyayaa.

Kalidasa: niSheduShI raaghavadharmapatnI etc. Sorry, my devanagari scripting is not working on Gmail.

Regards,

Murthy
