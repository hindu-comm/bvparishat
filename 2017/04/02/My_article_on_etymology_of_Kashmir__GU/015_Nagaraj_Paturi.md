\>As I said, what etymology do we assign to the terms such as:hammīra (हम्मीर =of a king ofŚākam-bharī),samīra (समीर = of a people),timīra (तिमीर),kirmīra (किर्मीर =Rākshasa or goblin conqueredby Bhīma-sena),karmīra (कर्मीर) etc?  

  

----- If a phonemic sequence found to be common in a group of words has to be considered as a possible morphemic unit, the common semantics of that phonemic sequence in all the considered group of words should first be established.
