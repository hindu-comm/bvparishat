I'm puzzled as to why Sanskrit etymologies are required for toponyms or names of regions. Of the traditional 16 janapada's, how many really had tenable Sanskrit etymologies?

  

In the same spirit of argument, why must we require 'Kashmir' and 'Nepal' to have Sanskrit etymologies? For example, names like 'Anga', 'Vanga' and 'Kalinga' are used in Sanskrit but do they really have good Sanskrit etymologies?
