Dear Prof. Huet

  

The reading कशोर्मुट् च is most likely a misprint. I have consulted more than ten editions of Unadi Sutras and all of them have the reading कशेर्मुट् च and not कशोर्मुट् च. The root is कश् which is mentioned as कशि in sutra-s. This is similar to गम् being mentioned as गमि and काश् being mentioned as काशि in Ashtadhyayi.

  

In addition, कष्टे is not the locativesingular सुबन्त form of कष्ट. It is rather the तिङन्त singular first person लट् लकार form of कश्. This is attested in the Madhaviya Dhaturvritti as can be seen here <https://archive.org/stream/MadhaviyaDhatuVritti1964Sayanacarya/Madhaviya%20Dhatu%20Vritti%201964%20-%20Sayanacarya#page/n385/mode/1up>.

  

And so, कष्टे गच्छति does not translate to "experiences pain" as you interpret. Rather the verbal form कष्टे is explained as गच्छति. This makes sense because the root is कश् गतिशासनयोः. It is usual for commentaries to explain a verbal form with another one.

  

The same explanation is offered by Dayananda Sarasvati which I have covered in my article and called theoretically correct. However, when taken as the name of a place, the suffix in कर्तृ does not make sense and therefore the suffix is to be taken in अधिकरण.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
