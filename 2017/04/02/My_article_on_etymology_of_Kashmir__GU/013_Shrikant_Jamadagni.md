'm' can change to 'pa' or 'b' but not the other way around.  

Some western Indologists made similar remarks on the name Saraswati (Vedic river) by appealing to the name 'horaswati' in other non-sanskrit language. 's' can change to 'h' but not the other way - this has been already adequately explained by other Idologists. Kindly explain your position better.  

  

BTW: 'mira' also has the meaning of 'limit' or 'boundary'; could this help? as kashmira is northermost territory (habitable) of Bharata.
