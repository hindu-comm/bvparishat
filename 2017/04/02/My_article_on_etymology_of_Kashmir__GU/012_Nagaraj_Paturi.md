My point is why should the word 'pre-Sanskrit' be preferred to the word
'non-Sanskrit' ?

  

In traditional Sanskrit scholarship, a big chunk of vocabulary is left classified under 'avyutpanna' category and that can be a good corpus for those interested in deriving the words from non-Sanskrit sources.

  

Even among those Sanskrit words which are considered as 'vyutpanna' and which have vyutpatti provided by grammarians or other Sanskrit scholars, there could be some words that could have non-Sanskrit origin and the Sanskrit scholar could have forced a Sanskrit etymology into its derivation.

  

What you point out, might suggest to a Sanskrit etymologist that it is avyutpanna within the parameters of etymology of a Sanskrit word from Sanskrit rules.

  

Deriving it from non-Sanskrit sources is the next step to accepting as avyutpanna.

  

'pre-Sanskrit' is diachronic. non-Sanskrit is synchronic or ahistorical.

  

An English borrowing in Telugu can not make English 'pre-Telugu'.
