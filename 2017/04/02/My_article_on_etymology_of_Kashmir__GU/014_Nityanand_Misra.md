Thanks to Shrikant Jamadagni Ji, L Srinivas Ji, Hardik Joshi Ji, Shatavadhani Galu, Prof. Kannan, and Prof. Paturi for their kind comments.



Our friend Dmitri Semenov asked if a derivation with two suffixes “-mi” and “-ra” was ever proposed. I have not come across any such derivation. Other list members may enlighten if they have seen such a derivation.



To Suresh Kolichala Ji,



You asked “have you considered …”. Let me clarify that I am not the source of the etymology from the root “kash” that I mention in the article. The etymology is from the Unadi Sutra and Sanskrit grammar tradition. I do not know if they considered the other similar names or not.It is possible that the word is what is called *avyutpanna*, having no derivation. I have briefly touched this in the article where I wrote:

“It may be argued that since words formed from Unadi Sutra-s are considered to be ready-made by Panini,*kashmira* is really an underived proper noun for which the author of Unadi Sutras traced the most similar-sounding root.”

If this view is taken then any Sanskrit etymology is fanciful indeed and there is no point in even attempting. However, the name may also be a Sanskritized version of a previous name, in which case the way Sanskrit sources derive the name becomes critical for our consideration.  

  

However, the focus of the article is not on whether the name is derived or underived, but rather on how Kashmir is derived in the tradition of Sanskrit grammar, and it is clear that for more than 2,500 years, the word has been considered as derived in a specific way in Sanskrit. This is why I wrote (italics for emphasis):  



“what is certain is that *if an etymology of Kashmir from a Sanskrit word or root is to be considered at all*, it must be in accordance with Sanskrit etymological and grammatical sources.”



I have already mentioned my reasons to favour the Unadi Sutra etymology over the popular etymologies by Wilson, Vigne, etc. and the ‘folk etymology’ (Ka = water + shimir = dessicate).

  

Regarding non-Sanskrit languages, they may certainly be explored but are there sufficient textual sources that mention/derive the word Kashmira prior to Unadi Sutras (\~ 500 BCE)?
