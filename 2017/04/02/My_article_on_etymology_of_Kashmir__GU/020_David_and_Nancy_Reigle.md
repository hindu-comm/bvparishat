Dear Nityananda Ji,

  

Your article on “The Etymology of Kashmir” is, to my mind, an excellent example of exactly the kind of research that is needed. When old and authoritative sources exist, in this case the Uṇādi-sūtras, they must be preferred. Then there is no need for speculations or guesses based on later or less central sources.  

  

Speculative answers to problems related to Sanskrit words are common. A case similar to yours came to my attention some years ago, regarding the meaning of the word praśaṭhatā. The answer was there all the time in the Pāṇinīya Dhātu-pāṭha (<https://www.academia.edu/6423804/The_Virtually_Unknown_Benedictive_Middle_in_Classical_Sanskrit_Two_Occurrences_in_the_Buddhist_Abhisamayalankara>, p. 123).

  

Just wanted to add my voice to all the appreciations already expressed here. Whether or not one is interested in the etymology of kaśmīra, your article provides a good model for research. You clearly give the reasons why previous speculative etymologies are incorrect, and you demonstrate the value of consulting primary sources from the Sanskrit grammatical tradition in arriving at the correct etymology.

  

Thank you.

  

Best regards,
