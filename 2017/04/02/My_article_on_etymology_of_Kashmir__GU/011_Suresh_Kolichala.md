Dear Vidwan Nagaraj-ji,

  

As I said, it is difficult to trace the etymologies of some of these geographical terms, as they may belong to long lost aboriginal languages of India -- from the pre-IE, pre-Dravidian linguistic strata (what I call a Niṣādic substrate) about which we have almost no knowledge, other than some intractable toponyms, hydronyms and ethnonyms. As I said, what etymology do we assign to the terms such as:hammīra (हम्मीर =of a king ofŚākam-bharī),samīra (समीर = of a people),timīra (तिमीर),kirmīra (किर्मीर =Rākshasa or goblin conqueredby Bhīma-sena),karmīra (कर्मीर) etc?

  

Regards,

Suresh.
