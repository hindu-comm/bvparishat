DearNityanand Misraji,

  

Thanks for sharing an interesting essay on the intriguing etymology of the word *kāśmīra*. As a person who has been interested in the etymologies of toponyms, I have come to believe that the derivation of a satisfactory etymology for many of the ancient names of the Indian places, rivers and tribes is very complex, and perhaps unachievable with the current linguistic knowledge, as some of these names may be from the pre-Sanskrit languages.

  

When we consider toponyms, hydronyms and ethnonyms, we need to look at equally ancient toponyms and ethnonyms with similar prefixes and suffixes.Have you considered the possible ancient ethnonyms with -mīra suffixes,such as:hammīra (हम्मीर =of a king ofŚākam-bharī),samīra (समीर = of a people),timīra (तिमीर),kirmīra (किर्मीर =Rākshasa or goblin conqueredby Bhīma-sena),karmīra (कर्मीर) etc.?

  

I actually findGodfrey Vigne's etymology about the sound change of p/b \~ m very interesting. In fact, in the Khotanese Buddhist text of the Book of Zambasta uses the term *Kaspāra*, apparently when referring to the land of *Kāśmīra*. In fact, if we consider the languages of Northwestern India, it is evident that p/b \~ m is pretty common among IE and non-IE languages (including Brahui, which is a Dravidian language mēy 'to graze' \> Br. bei \[DEDR 4170\]. meṭṭ 'high land' \> Br. biṭ, Kannada beṭṭa).

  

We also have river name without a satisfactory etymology *narbada* \~ *narmadā* showing a similar variation in /b/ and /m/.  
  
In addition to Sanskrit literature -- where the name Kāśmīra is widely attested -- the linguistic evidence from the other languages must be considered in attempting to derive the etymology as well. We know that the term Kāśmīra appears as *kaspīra*in Pasai language, *kaśīr* in Dardic Ṣiṇa language, and as*kamhīra*, kambhāra, kasamīra in various Prakrits. Interestingly, the Tibetan has Kaspara as well. There is some evidence to show that Middle Chinese may have a spelling closer to *kaspir* for this area.

  

I believe any attempt to derive a fanciful etymology for toponyms purely based on Sanskrit, without using all the linguistic evidence (comparative and historical) from the ancient languages around this area, would exactly remain that: a fanciful etymology!

  

Regards,

Suresh.
