Your question is valid and deserves an answer. The difference between नमस्तेSस्तु and नमस्ते अस्तु is that the later is not in Samhita form and hence incorrect. The अ in अस्तु becomes savruta which is unacceptable to katyayana and patanjali refer to the vartik अकारस्यविवृतोपदेशेआकरस्यग्रहणार्थ: Many more reasons can be cited to buttress that the former is correct.
