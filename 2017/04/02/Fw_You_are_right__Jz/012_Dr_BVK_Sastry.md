Namaste,

A\) it is not my statement at all. Still waiting for the initiator of this topic Dr. Prabhakar to respond. He has been active in other posts but has not responded yet. We need to wait.

^^^^^^^^^

BVK Sastry ( on A): OK.

-----------------



B\) What is the correct patha according to CHandas rules that you are suggesting?

^^^^^^^^^

BVK Sastry ( on B): The ‘Correct Paatha’ is best ascertained by taking recourse to what is a living – practical tradition.



 Which in this case is aimed to worship ‘Rudra’. In articulation, the ‘ a-kaara’ is articulated to be heard as ‘ prashlishta- poorvaroopa’ ( with the right amount of time for audition and articulation to be clear). This is learnt from the teachers; and when chanting Vedas, done consciously with ‘bhaavanaa’ .

 These are essential basics of ‘ Bhashaa’ – the articulation of Samskrutham; which is an expectation of ‘ conscious infusion of precision and responsible pronunciation of mantra’.

 Popular ‘Sambhashanam’ and ‘ ‘Group Chnating’ may not be able to bring out this finer fundamental aspect of ‘Shikhaa Shaastra before Vyakarana’. 



 Shivo bhootvaa shivan yajet is the dictum. When it come to ‘Veda’, It is not a mechanical timer issue or a ‘ musically pleasant to hear and sing issue’. It is ‘Mediation and application of Veda’.

-----------------





C\) Saama is ganaatmaka. Could you please help out with paninian grammer how the gayatra saama can be ascertained.How about stobhas in it?

^^^^^^^^^

BVK Sastry ( on A): This is a different dimension to be responded to by the ‘ Saama Veda Scholars who know the nuances of Paninian Grammar ( Bhashaa and Chandas) and know how to compare it with the Saama specific Pratishaakhya and Viniyoga, coupled with the Shaakhaa bheda and current teaching practices. I have very limited understanding of this depth of the Vedic practice and Linguistics of Saama veda. Especially in this case, as print versions of ‘gaayatram saama’ do show some variations.


-----------------



D)Please refer vyakhya of nararatnapurushottamacharya. Essentially from the "dhaatarati.....rudraprathama....mahaprishtye" rule it is not correct vyaakhya at all as is stated earleir.

^^^^^^^^^

BVK Sastry ( on D): I believe the ‘ Moola’ and ‘Sustaining Practicals’ are good to understand the application- utility of Veda in this case. It may be worth while a separate thread to discuss why a specific commentator goes out of the main path in veda interpretation: and specific need of such exercise. Exceptions need special investigation.
