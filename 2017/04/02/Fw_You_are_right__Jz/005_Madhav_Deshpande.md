Dear Shri Karve,

  

  There is no indication in the Vārttikas of Kātyāyana and Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya that the short "a" according to them was a vivṛta "open" sound in the final derived forms of Sanskrit. Within the Pāṇinian system, a short vowel like "a" can stand for the whole class of "a" sounds differing in length, accent and nasality, as long as the members of this class share the same sthāna "point of articulation" and prayatna "oral effort". In the case of short "a" and "long "ā", there is a problem, because the short "a" in actual usage is a samvṛta "close" vowel, while "ā" is a vivṛta "open" vowel. If we take the normal values of oral effort for these sounds, they will not become savarṇa "homogeneous" with each other \[by the rule: tulyāsyaprayatnaṃ savarṇam\]. In order for the short "a" to stand for the entire class of "a" sounds differing in length, accent and nasality, Pāṇini assumes the short "a" to be a vivṛta "open" vowel during the entire derivational process, and only at the very end of the derivational process, the last rule of the Aṣṭādhyāyī \[a a\] restores the samvṛta "close" short "a" vowel in the place of the assumed vivṛta "open" short "a". Kātyāyana's Vārttika \[akārasya vivṛtopadeśaḥ ākāragrahaṇārthaḥ\] actually makes it clear: "The vivṛta "open" teaching of the short "a" is for the purpose of allowing it to represent long ā (as member of the a-varṇa-class)."
This teaching of open short is finally reversed by the very last rule of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, by restoring the samvṛta "close" short "a" in the final derived forms of Sanskrit. There is no disagreement between Pāṇini, Kātyāyana and Patañjali on this issue.
