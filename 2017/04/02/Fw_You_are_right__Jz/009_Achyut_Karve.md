In the discussion on the last sutra अअ of the Ashtadhyayi Patanjali does not agree that the विवृत अकार finally becomes संवृत. Instead he agrees that the said sutra is made to tell that theअकार in the Maaheshwar Sutras consumes all its variation being सवर्ण like उदात्त अनुदात्त etc. However the संवृत अकार will not be in a position to consumate the said variations. Therefore in usage too only the विवृत stands ground.
