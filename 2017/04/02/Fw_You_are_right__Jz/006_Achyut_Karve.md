I have not said that there is difference of opinion between Panini, katyayana and patanjali. Secondly it would have been better if you would have addressed the original query. Thirdly I feel it would be better if you go through my book which i have sent and render a critique of it. Fourthly I think that there is no place for there to be two a's in Sanskrit one for derivation and another for the final form.
In fact all defects of phonation are classed into one category, namely संवृत by patanjali at the end of anhik 1 of the Mahabhashya.

Achyut Karve.
