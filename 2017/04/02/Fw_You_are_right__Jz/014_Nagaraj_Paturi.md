Request to Moderators

  

Would be helpful if the Subject Line is ensured to be transparent

  

  

                      -- Prof. Kannan

  

Sorry for the delay in responding to this highly pertinent alert from Prof. Kannan.

  

The software of google groups , for justifiable reasons, does not allow the moderator's to make changes in the title or content of a thread or a post.  

  

That is the reason why moderators have always been asking members to take such cares.

  

For example, the title of the present thread "You are right"does not communicate anything about the content of the thread.

  

Please, please , please members, ensure that the title of the thread communicates the content of the thread.

  

--------

  

Apart from this, posting in 'reply' mode from a digest type post received by the member creates a huge problem regarding the title of the thread.

  

Yesterday we had to reject repeatedly a post from an organization for this reason with a suggestion to make a new post with a title.
