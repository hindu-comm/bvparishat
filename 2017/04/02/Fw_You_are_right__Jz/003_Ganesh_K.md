Achyut Sir,

  

For which shakha is paniniya a lakshana grantha? 

Regarding your novel idea of using phonation to ascertain veda manta ,let us take for eg: the 2nd line of Sri Rudra,Which paninian rule or phonation that you suggest to follow, is applied to ascertain that the samasta pada usage as "namaste∫stu" is not allowed and only it should be namaste astu as vyasta padas ? There is a similar formation in the SYK mantra fordarsapurnamasa paatra chaalana, could you kindly without any beating around the bush explain it with the phonation rules and decide on authenticity.

  

How about which paninian or phonation rule to follow to ascertain on Gramageya gaanas.?

  

regards,

Ganesh K.
