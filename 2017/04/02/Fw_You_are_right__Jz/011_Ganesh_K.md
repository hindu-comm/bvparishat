Namaste,

A\) it is not my statement at all. Still waiting for the initiator of this topic Dr. Prabhakar to respond. He has been active in other posts but has not responded yet. We need to wait.

B\) What is the correct patha according to CHandas rules that you are suggesting?

C\) Saama is ganaatmaka. Could you please help out with paninian grammer how the gayatra saama can be ascertained.How about stobhas in it?

D)Please refer vyakhya of nararatnapurushottamacharya. Essentially from the "dhaatarati.....rudraprathama....mahaprishtye" rule it is not correct vyaakhya at all as is stated earleir.

  

regards,

Ganesh K.
