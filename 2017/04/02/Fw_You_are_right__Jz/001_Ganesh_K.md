Namaste,



It is highly ambiguous without a detailed history/context of discussion to understand what the scholar working is looking for,especially eight point questions. As an external person i have assumed and wasable to classify as 5 ofthem and answering below:

1)“We do not have an inventory of our vedic texts. I wonder if any body has updated the bibliography done by Prof Dandekar” ?Is this only for SYK or it includes even SYM or is it for more than this?

2) “ M & K Chandas differ” Yes Obviously as the mantra vibhaga is different. In case of darsapurnamasa paatra chaalana it is yajuschanda as per anandabodha in SYK and a second one with gayatri . In SYM swahakara vidhi (sri hargovindsharma) it is bhurigatishakvari. Uvvata in SYM specifies the whole chapter to be of yajuschanda and then goes on specifiying that according to some it is mandatory to specify special chandas within as per pingala shastra .Anandabodha gives a good translation for the sarvanukramanika chandah prakarana and leaves it as optional to choose and decide and prefers as aniyataaksharatvaad yajushaam chando naasti. Saayana as well prefers this to be optional. Same is detailed even in svahakaravidhi.

3)”change in chandas must have an effect on recitation” .Yajus doesn’t
have to follow a clear defined akshara vidhi as explained by the bhashyakaras above and guruparampara followed till date.However if required it is possible to ascertain the chandas and has to be followed as it is in the parampara paada.

4)”svara notation does not differ that much” .The swara niyamas are
not related to chandas. In the example of paatrachalana mantra the swaras need to differ and is different in both SYM and SYK.

5)”find that as in most cases the anuvaka notation is co=terminous:”This is as well incorrect and the khandika and mantra division doesn’t co terminate in the samhita literature of both.





Please ensure to give more detailed context and examples without which it is very difficult to respond to.

Regards,

Ganesh K.
