Namaste



A) I agree on (a) We do not have an inventory of our vedic texts. But the question following is about the Oral –Practicing Tradition and ‘ Articulation of given Veda-Mantra’ and ‘Teaching in a
Vedic Patha Shaalaa’. The rest of the questions are more on ‘Text documentation, Swara Notation, Prayoga in specific veda user communities, and technicality of ‘ Utility of Chandas by the stated phala’. The position of tradition is clear on these issues. 



B) I am not sure on what is deliberated in the statement \< All the 4 questions posed have clear cut answers from vedanga and **it cannot be addressed** with paniniya vyakarana or phonetics as I have mentioned earlier. \> : In making the articulate mantra viniyoga \< नमस्तेSस्तु and नमस्ते अस्तु \> are you invoking Shikhsaa or Pratishaakhya sampradaya OR Paniniya Vyakarana ? When did ‘Bhashaa’ rules took over the authority of ‘Chandas’ rules in Panini ? (Did any of the traditional acharyas guide you Or the Colonial Grammarians and Linguists using Grimm’s law and the like endorsed such a split? How does Poorvaroopa technicality turn to ‘Vivrutha –Samvrutha’ related swara issue’ ?



C) Veda –Darshana is Veda Sukta; Darshana does not have to depend on Vedanga. On the other hand, the ‘Viniyoga’ like a ‘Geya Gaana’, which is a derivative application from the ‘ Mantra’ must be in the bounds of ‘ Shadanga -Vednaga’; and in this case ‘ Paniniya Vyakarana –Yaskas Nirukta ( along with Pratishakhyas )’ as tradition holds it.



D) With this, is any one sure : ‘ Namaste Astu’ - is this ‘Darshana Text’ OR the ‘ Yaajnika –Text’ ?



If Darshana, then split नमस्ते अरुद्र is incorrect and damaging.



If ‘ Yaajnika Text, then who is worshipped in the Opening – Middle and End (aadau –Madhye –ante) ? Is it ‘Rudra’ Or ‘ A-Rudra’ ?



Established Tradition favors ‘ Rudra’ paaraayana viniyogah.



Please Provide Proof if there be anything contrary to this.
