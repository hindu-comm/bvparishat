Sir,

  

There are 4 questions and you have tried to address only one. Kindly note that the below answer cannot be the proof and what the paada
नमस्ते अस्तु is for samhita pada and this cannot be derived by a paninian grammer perspective . The same vedanga rule that prevents the compound form is applicable in case of the first mantraनमस्ते रुद्र which is wrongly interpreted by one of the bhasyakara asनमस्ते अरुद्र which wont stand the vedanga rules ordained for vedas. Shruti is apaurusheya and no rule can be created to define it but only formulated to explain it. All the 4 questions still are pending for a clear answer from you and your proposed approach.

  

regards,

Ganesh K.
