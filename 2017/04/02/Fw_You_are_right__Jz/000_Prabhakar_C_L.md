We do not have an inventory of our vedic texts. I wonder if any body has updated the bibliography done by Prof Dandekar. I am sure we will collect a useful list if we approach the scholars and libraries round the world.

I will sen you the commentaries on Sharabha nama.In preparing a backgrounder for the comparative recitations for Darsapurnsmasa, I found that some SYM kandika-s has two or more chandas and that it is possible that M&K chndas for the same and similar text differs. Unfortunately the SY anukramanika citations are too brief and I could not put together a viable list. I wonder where I can get an authoritative list.. Kanva bhashyas mention them sometimes,

The change in chandas must have an effect on recitation.

The svara notation does not differ that much.

I find that as in most cases the anuvaka notation is co=terminous, that may be unit on comparison for recitations.

When I put together the backgrounder I will pass it on to you.

I hope you are now well rested. When I see you on skype I will try to call you.

With regards, Nath
