Namaste Achyut Sir,





You first response on 04^(th) April states ” Scholars seem to be beating round the bush”

. The next response on specific 4 questions still wait for clear and precise responses. If the article you mentioned has answers ,the response should be clear with references and how and which portion addresses each of the question. All the 4 questions posed have clear cut answers from vedanga and it cannot be addressed with paniniya vyakarana or phonetics as I have mentioned earlier. These specific question (and an additional example from a very common shruti passage ) can be easily answered from specific vedangas.



Namaste Dr. C. L. Prabhakar Sir,



There are responses pending from your scholar on the questions posed . Please share your response once you have gone through them.



Regards,

Ganesh K.
