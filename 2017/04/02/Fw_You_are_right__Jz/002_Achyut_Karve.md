Scholars seem to be beating round the bush. The easiest and sure way to decide whether the original texts were tampered with or not is to first define the nature of phonation that was in vogue before prakrit became a language of literary rendering. Post Panini the nature or way of phonation has undergone change. This needs to be solved first or else scholars will continue to challenge their authenticity from either points of view.
