I had downloaded these files sometime ago and had not checked them. I just checked them and I am afraid that the Bibliotheca Indica series files are not a complete set:

1\) Volume 4 and Volume 6 are the same files, both are commentaries on Kanda VI. Kanda IV commentary is not available.

2\) Volume 8 (Kanda VIII) is also missing.

3\) Volume 9 (Kanda IX) seems to have only the original text

4\) I do not know if remaining volumes (Kanda-s X to XIV) were published or not.

  

Sayana's commentary on Kanda-s III, IV, and V was published by Laxmi Venkateshwar Press with another commentary by Hari Svami. This is available here:

I do not know if other volumes of this series are available online.
