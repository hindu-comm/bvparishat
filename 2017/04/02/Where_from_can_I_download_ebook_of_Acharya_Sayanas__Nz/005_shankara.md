Misraji,

  

Thanks for pointing out the errors in Satapatha Brahamana volumes. I have made necessary changes in the folder at [archive.org](http://archive.org). As per Asiatic Library catalogue published in 1956, only 9 volumes of Satapatha Brahamana were published. Not sure whether remaining volumes of SB were published later.  

  

It seems, volumes 4 and 8 of SB are not available on the net.



regards  
shankara
