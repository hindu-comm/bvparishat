Sorry, something was amiss. ज्योतिस् can be both neuter and masculine. In the sense of Agni, ज्योतिस्is masculine. In the sense of light or a celestial object, ज्योतिस् is neuter.

In both cases, भिस् is not a सर्वनामस्थान.

In case of ज्योतिस् being masculine, it is not a सर्वनामस्थान as सुडनपुंसकस्य (१.१.४२) does not apply to भिस् suffix from non-neuter lemmas.

In case of ज्योतिस् being neuter, it is not a सर्वनामस्थान as शि सर्वनामस्थानम् (१.१.४१) does not apply to भिस् suffix from neuter lemmas. This is because only जस् and शस् after a neuter lemma are replaced by शि by the rule जश्शसोः शि (७।१।२०).
