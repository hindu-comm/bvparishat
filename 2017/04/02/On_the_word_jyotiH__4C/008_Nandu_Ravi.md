The intended meaning to convey is "procession of lights," or more exactly "forthcoming of the procession of lights," if that makes any sense! ज्योतिषाम् आयनम् as the विग्रहः।  
  
I presume there wouldn't be a रेफादेशः for the सकारः in the compound. Is ज्योतिषायनम् the proper word then?  
  
Although the बहुवचनम् of the Instrumental Case is ज्योतिर्भिः (acc. Sanskrit Heritage Site)। There seems to be a रेफादेशः there. Which सूत्रम् governs the same?
