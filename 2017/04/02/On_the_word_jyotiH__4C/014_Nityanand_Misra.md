Firstly why would you go for आयनम् for procession? It is an odd choice. आयनम् अयनसाध्ये अयनसम्बन्धिनि says the Vachaspatyam. आयन means something "coming from a specific movement" or "related to a specific movement". One can assume the prefix आ, but would be better to go with common words when coining neologisms.

  

In any case if you want to stick with your choice then there would certainly be a रेफादेश. Just like you have in ज्योतिरात्मन्, ज्योतिरादित्य, ज्योतिरिङ्ग etc. The reason is that in the vigraha ज्योतिषाम् आयनम्, ज्योतिषाम् is aसुप्तिङन्तं पदम् (१.४.१४). When the samasa happens, the आम् suffix gets deleted by सुपो धातुप्रातिपदिकयोः (२.४.७१). However, even after its deletion, ज्योतिस् retains its पदत्व due to प्रत्ययलोपे प्रत्ययलक्षणम् (१.१.६२).

  

As ज्योतिस् has पदत्व, the rule ससजुषो रुः (८.२.६६) which is applicable to स् at the end of the पद will apply, leading to रुत्व and giving you ज्योतिरायनम्. Just like in the famous examplesअग्निरत्र and वायुरत्र.

Here the prakriya is different. In the situation ज्योतिस् + भिस्, the base (अङ्ग) ज्योतिस् is not सुबन्त, and so सुप्तिङन्तं पदम् (१.४.१४) does not apply. However, the ruleस्वादिष्वसर्वनामस्थाने (१.४.१७) applies since the vibhakti भिस् is a स्वादि suffix and since it is not a सर्वनामस्थान.

Why is not a सर्वनामस्थान? Because the lemma ज्योतिस् is not neuter (it is masculine) and for non-neuter lemmas, by the rule सुडनपुंसकस्य (१.१.४२) only the first fiveसुप् suffixes (सु औ जस् अम् औट्) are called सर्वनामस्थान.

Having established that स्वादिष्वसर्वनामस्थाने (१.४.१७) applies, the same rule assigns the status of पद to the base ज्योतिस् in the situation ज्योतिस् + भिस्. Now the rule ससजुषो रुः (८.२.६६) which is applicable to स् at the end of the पद applies, leading to रुत्व and giving you ज्योतिर्भिः. And then ज्योतिर्भिः gets the status of पद due to सुप्तिङन्तं पदम् (१.४.१४) as usual.

  

Hope that clarifies.
