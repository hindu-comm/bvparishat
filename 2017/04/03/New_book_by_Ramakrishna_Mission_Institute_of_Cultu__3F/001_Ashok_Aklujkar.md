Similarly useful should be the following publication that is more than thirty years old but does not seem to have been commonly referred to by scholars, particularly by scholars in India:

  

Alston, A.J. 1980-. A Śaṃkara Source-book. \[six volumes published between 1980 and 1989, at least the first volume of which in photo-reprinted in 1981 and 1987\]. London: Shanti Sadan \[29 Chepstow Villas, U.K.\]

Volume I: Śaṃkara on the Absolute.

Volume II: Śaṃkara on the Creation.

Volume III: Śaṃkara on the Individual Soul.

Volume IV: Śaṃkara on Rival Views / Śaṃkara’s Refutation of Rival Views.

Volume V: Śaṃkara on Discipleship.

Volume VI: Śaṃkara on Enlightenment / Śaṃkara on the Path to Enlightenment.

  

  

The volumes contain only English translations and comments. Separate volumes giving the original Sanskrit texts (in their accurate and easily readable form) should be added.
