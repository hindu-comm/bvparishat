Hari Om,

  

This mail is about a new book. Swami Kritarthananda has painstakingly compiled most important and memorable statements of Shankara Bhagavatpada in the Prasthana-traya bhashya, for the benefit of Vedanta enthusiasts and researchers. The hardbound book runs into 916 pages and is published by the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata.

  

Swamiji wants the book to reach Advaita teachers across the country so that students and researchers of Vedanta can benefit from this. I received a mail in this regard from the publishers some days ago, with a request to help them spread the word about this book.
