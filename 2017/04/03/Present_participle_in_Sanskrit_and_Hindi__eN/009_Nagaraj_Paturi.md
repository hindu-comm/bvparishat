A linguistics perspective of the issue is[here](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjwvOHHu4vTAhWBt48KHQ8lB4sQFggnMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdigilib.phil.muni.cz%2Fbitstream%2Fhandle%2F11222.digilib%2F100966%2FA_Linguistica_55-2007-1_5.pdf%3Fsequence%3D1&usg=AFQjCNFm9u4UKvpdWEYrcoYoHhR3R-19rA&sig2=4myWZqDwoa3oj9epjMcX8g).

  

The writer says:

The tense structure in Hindi consists of both synthetic and analytic forms. The analytic tenses are formed with the combination of participles and the auxiliary honā ‛to be’.

1\. Firstly the nature of the participles, which make the nucleus of whole tense system in Hindi, will be explained here.

  

1.1. The Imperfective Participle i.e: likhtā (verb likhnā ‛write’) denotes a frequentative or iterative action, an action which takes place, whenever there is a chance to happen. Shapiro (1989: 54) categorizes it under the habitual aspect and Pořízka (1972: 109) also describes the action formed with the imperfective participles as habitual, but justifiably names the tenses as imperfective ones. The English language does not have any participle form which semantically coincides with Hindi imperfective participle, but in attributive function the imperfective participle can be translated into English as –ing participle. The tenses formed with imperfective participles in translation into English sometimes fall under the category of unmarked tenses in English, which are indefinite or simple tenses or sometimes exclusive phrases describe the nature of the action.  

  

................................................................................................................................................................................

  

2.1. The Imperfective Present tense is a marked member of the classification; it is marked with the habitual nature of the action. The primary function of the imperfective present tense is to express a habitual present action. The imperfective present tense is formed with the imperfective participle and the simple present tense (evidently the verb honā) in the function of auxiliary. The imperfective participle expresses the habitual action and the auxiliary puts the action in present. The imperfective present tense can also be called as all time present. hamāre śahar meg sardiyog meg barf pa0tò hai. In our town it snows in winters. sabke la0ke lau-lagan se mihanat-majadūrī karte haig. (Himānśu Jośī: 13) Everybody’s sons work hard with dedication. The action is not bound with any particular time; it is extended to all the times, present, past and future.  

  

What he describes by saying, "The analytic tenses are formed with the combination of participles and the auxiliary honā ‛to be.",

  

is called periphrastic construction.
