jaata/jaati usually indicate what is called habitual aspect. A basic, if not very academic, idea can be had from

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_grammar#Verbs>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_aspect>

  

aap mein se mandir kaun-kaun jaata hai

= Who among you goes to the temple \[regularly/as a habit\]?

  

main jaata hoon

= I go \[very often\]

  

main pehle har din jaati thi, ab naheen jaati

= I used to go everyday, now I do not

  

It does not indicate continuous aspect. So main jaata hoon does not mean I am going right now.

  

However, note that with aana/jaana/chalna, the constructs aata/jaata/chalta have another sense, that of indicating an action in the very near future.

  

abhi aata hoon = I will come \[now/very soon\].

ek ghante mein aata hoon = I will come in an hour

main jaati hoon = I am about to go \[There was a song jaati hoon main in the movie Karan Arjun\]

chalta hoon = I will leave now
