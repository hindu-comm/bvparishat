Dear Shankaraji and list members,  
  

Immediately on hearing that it is an ICPR publication, I wrote to ICPR for the book, but there is no reply. This could mean that the book is out of print and is not available for sale. If any scholar has the information as to which library has a copy of it, it may be possible to procure photocopy of selected papers (on payment). To my understanding any copying for non-commercial and personal use does not infringe copy-right laws.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
