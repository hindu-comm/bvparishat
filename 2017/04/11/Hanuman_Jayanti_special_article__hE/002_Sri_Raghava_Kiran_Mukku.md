नमो विद्वन् नित्यानन्द

  

This is an interesting article. I thought I would share a few of my thoughts on the same.

  

True there may be many more such traditional tunes with untraceable original score composer. Similar to a poem where a poet picks up words and weaves a hitherto unknown combination of words, a musician creates a score based on what we call as his / her*manodharma*. The richer the repertoire \[of traditional / earlier composed music\], the richer the *manodharma*. Music is set by either a *vaaggeyakaara* or a *sangeetakaara* to a given context, and in the case of devotional literature, the tunes are largely driven by local traditional music \[even now with rising popularity for fusion music\]. Of course, most*arthavit* musicians try composing in different *raaga*s without deviating from tradition (नवनवोन्मेषशालिनी...) !

  

I echo the words of Sri Venkata Sriram. Your enthusiasm and scholarship are indeed very inspiring.  

  

धन्योऽस्मि
