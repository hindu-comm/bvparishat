Dear Sri Sudipta Munsi,  
  

I visited the Samskrita Sahitya Parishad in the year 2008, from where I could procure a print copy of Bharata Mallika's Karakollasa (17th AD). I arranged to key in the data later and it has been lying in a hard disk since then. With regard to your recent request to the list, I could recall and locate the file in the HDD. I believe, its free from copyright law.  
  

This tiny and beautiful work on kArakas, is quite useful to the students to memorize the relations easily. There is an interesting narration about the honorific title 'Mallika' in the preface authored by Pt. Janakinath Shastry. Please find the attachment.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
