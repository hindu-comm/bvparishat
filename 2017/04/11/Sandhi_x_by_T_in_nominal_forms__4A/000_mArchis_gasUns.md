Namaste,

  

In SANSKRIT SANDHI AND EXERCISES By M. B. EMENEAU and B.A.VAN NOOTEN

  

We have: 21. In general, the following rules apply to kṣ: (W 229b-c):

\(a\) before zero or s it is replaced by k in verb forms,

\(b\) by ṭ in nominal forms.

\(c\) before t it is replaced by s.

\(d\) before other relevant consonants, it is replaced by ṭ.

  

but (W 229b-c) seems to be wrong in the printed book, because 229 has only "a" and nothing about "kṣ":

  

229\. The first consonant of a group—whether interior, or initial after a vowel of a preceding word—is by the grammarians either allowed or required to be doubled.

  

a\. This duplication is allowed by Pāṇini and required by the Prātiçākhyas—in both, with mention of authorities who deny it altogether. For certain exceptions, see the Prātiçākhyas; the meaning of the whole matter is too obscure to justify the giving of details here.

Does anyone know where to look for in Whitney? Where can I read about the sandhi preferences verb forms vs. nominal forms? Is it in Panini?
