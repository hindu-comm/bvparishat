Dear Dipak,

  

  The best accounts of the Sasvara recitation of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda are from S.P. Pandit's introduction to his edition of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda Saṃhitā. He was mostly working with an AV reciter from Sangli in Maharashtra. Satavlekar's edition of the Śaunakīya AV makes use of Ratate Shastri's recitation. The Ratates migrated to Banaras from Maharashtra many generations ago. By their famtily lineage, they are Ṛgvedins, but for professional reasons, they became Atharvavedins. I have visited the Ratate family once almost 30 years ago, but I don't know enough about their history, and especially who taught them the recitation of the Śaunakīya AV. There was another Gurajati reciter of the Śaunakīya AV, someone named Manoharlal Shukla, but I was not able to meet him. It would be very instructive to know more about these reciter families, including the Pancholis from Gujarat, and their history may reveal how the Śaunakīya AV tradition fared in these places. In Maharashtra, a few decades ago, there is evidence of a dispute among the Taittirīyas and Ṛgvedins over the Taittirīyas reciting Ṛgveda mantras during sacrificial performances. The Ṛgvedins, who were deprived of their livelihood by this practice, claimed that the Taittirīyas should not be allowed to recite the Ṛgveda, unless they undergo a separate Upanayana. There are several documents dealing with this Yājuṣa-Hautra dispute, and I have written an article discussing this dispute. I wonder if the Ratates, who are Ṛgvedins by their Chitpavan Brahmin lineage, were required to undergo a separate Upanayana to learn and practice the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda.
