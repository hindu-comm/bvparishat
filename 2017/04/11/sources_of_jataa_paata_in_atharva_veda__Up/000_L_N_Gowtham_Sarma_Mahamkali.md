namaskram,

atharva veda being an uttaraamnaya has a strongsignificance very long ago was began to week by leatest days because of Diligence on vikruthi paata like jata, ghana etc. now a days atharva veda is very week by regional differences among pandits and by lack of siksha & pratishakya knowledge. they were many patashalas in rajasthan, varanasi and gujarat which pulled this veda intoexistence upto samhita and gopatha bramhana but many other traditional patas of this veda are lost in time. at this time a pandit from tirupati Mr. Mantha Shiva Rama Sarma, employee of TTD collected a huge manuscripts form bandarkar library, baroda university, sampornanda university and many from traditional atharva vedis from rajasthan and maharashtra. he worked on pada pata of atharva veda basing on atharva pratishakya and chaturadhyayika and published it 2012 from Chaukhamba Orientalia, varanasi. Olden evidences state that there were examinations used to be conducted in jata and ghana paatas of atharva veda in "veda sashtrottejaka sabha, pune" and darbhanga vidyalaya of varanasi was a exclusive patasala for atharva veda which were not in existence present day.

I request this group for info torevive this tradition. please share your ideas for this.

  

Thank you.

regards
