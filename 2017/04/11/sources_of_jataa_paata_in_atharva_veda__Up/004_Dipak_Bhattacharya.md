Dear Madhav,

I do not dispute that there are reciters of the accented text of the AV

Vulgate. I just wonder when the svaadhyaaya began with the AV. Svaadhyaaya is independent of the ritual while the AV is meant mainly for ritual. In the ritual application, ie in offering no sasvarapaatha should take place. You are indeed aware of how they utter mantras while offering. It is upaamshu. I have not observed sasvarapaatha with offering of the oblation. Sasvarapaatha took place in our home. These were svaadhyaaya paathas, held for their own sake ie not for any ritual.

The question is how the AV, a text with mainly grhya (or ;srauta Vaitaana S.S ) employment, could develop sasvara paatha. As far as my knowledge goes, an accented pronunciation is not the rule in ritual employment.

I am sorry for thr long lecture.

Best

Dipak
