Pranams to all,

  

I would like to know whether the following compilation ended with 6th volume or was it ever completed?

  

Brahmasutra Sankarabhashya with 11 tikas edited by Yogesvaradattasarma. Catalogue sites show details of only 6 volumes spanning upto Chapter 2, pada 2. Were further volumes published later on?  

  

Brahmasūtraśāṅkarabhāṣyam : ekādaśaṭīkāsaṃyutam
