There has been concern expressed over acrimonious, harsh or *ad hominem* expressions during discussions. This is shared by the readers of the posts as well as the participants in the discussion. Avoiding debates /disputes itself may appear to be a solution. But a forum of scholars can not completely avoid such threads. In fact , there is no need to avoid them as long as they run in a healthy tone with participants communicating to each other with due mutual respect and polite expressions.

  

As an example for such a discourse, let me share an essay by Prof. Ashok Aklujkar that he shared in this forum a while ago, in which he expresses his difference of opinion with Prof. Deshpande on several occasions in the course of the discussion while expressing his gratitude to Prof. Deshpande for his help during the preparation of the essay , articulating their mutual affection effectively.

  

In the beginning of the essay itself he acknowledges the help by Prof. Deshpande saying,

  

>

> 
> > of the sporadic but many discussions we were able to hold over the > last several years, theinadequacies of the present endeavour would > have been much more numerous."

But he does not hesitate to say,

> 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > "' Deshpande (l979a:3-14) points out that Sanskrit has been losing > ground as a mother tongue, father tongue, or first spoken language for > a long time.

(Highlighting mine) >

He does not hesitate to acknowledge the greatness of Prof. Deshpande to the field saying,

> >

But that does not stop him from saying,

Going through the full article helps to know all these differences and all the polite which they have been expressed.
