Dear Nagaraj-ji,

  

  Thanks for pointing to Ashok Aklujkar's ways of expressing his differences of opinion with me. In my own writings, I have done the same. Ashok and I were friends since my highschool days, and we have remained friends ever since. No amount of academic differences have put a single dent in our mutual friendship and affection.
