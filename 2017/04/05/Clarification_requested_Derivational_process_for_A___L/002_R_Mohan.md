Dear Prof. Korada,

  

Thank you very much for your quick response! It helped me a great deal in filling major gaps in my understanding of the process. Surprisingly, previous discussions on this topic did not come up when I had initially searched but I was now able to go through some of them, in addition to yours and they all have been of great benefit.

  

A question I would beg to persist is - could any of the **स्वार्थिकप्रत्यय**s be used to derive the word अवश्यकम् (in the sense of आवश्यकम्), knowing that the word has been accepted into mainstream vernaculars and used without much reservation - at least in Kannada, in words like avaśyaka (necessary - as an adjective), avaśyakate (necessity - as a noun)?

I would like to, however, highlight that regardless of the position of the Sanskrit grammar, Kannada (& quite possibly Hindi & other languages) provides its (their) own **तद्धितभाववाचकप्रत्यय** 'ka' - which seems to be made available for use both on Kannada-/तद्भव-प्रकृतिs (through well known examples) and on Sanskrit words (in some fringe cases). So potentially, we can have a Sanskrit base अवश्य with the addition of this affix 'ka' to form a भावनाम avaśyaka, which gives the same meaning as आवश्यकम्. This might establish the word in the mainstream as received usage but it would be worthwhile to reexamine if there are नियमs or न्यायs that could be exploited within the gamut of Sanskrit grammar, Pāṇinīyan or otherwise, to legitimately derive the word in this sense. Needless to say, āvaśyaka continues to be a form used by purists in the vernaculars.

  

ps: Regarding impropriety of the usage of the word **आवश्यकता** as per the न्याय - उक्तार्थानाम् अप्रयोगः, I would like to bring to your kind attention that **हितोपदेशः** (संधि-कथा 8) has the word used, in the sense of obligation, so:

अथ भगवता क्रुद्धेन वरदानस्यावश्यकतया विचारमूढयोः पार्वती प्रदत्ता।

  

Thanking you once again!

  

Regards,

Mohan
