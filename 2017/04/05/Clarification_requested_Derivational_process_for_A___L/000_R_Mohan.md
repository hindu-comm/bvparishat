Namaste!

  

Wilson's Sanskrit-English dictionary (2nd edition) gives **अवश्यक** (adjective) and **अवश्यकता** / **अवश्यकत्वं** as valid entries. It seems to accept the addition of '**कन्**' **तद्धितप्रत्ययः** to **अवश्यं** (non-declinable), along with subsequent addition of **तल्** and **त्व** affixes to form the other two derivatives above. Even though **अवश्यक** and **अवश्यकता** are used in many modern Indian languages (in their **तद्भव** forms) across the country and are even accepted as lexical items by some renowned dictionaries like Dasa-Hindi, I am not entirely sure if these are admissible under **पाणिनीयव्याकरणम्**. Or I could be totally misguided!

In any case, I would request the complete derivational process (with the applicable **सूत्र**s, if possible) involved in the formation of**आवश्यक** and the justification for the admission (or the lack thereof) of **अवश्यक**. Is it plausible, at all, to derive**अवश्यक**under any other **व्याकरण** systems?

  

Thanks very much!
