hariH OM,

  

 I will be extremely grateful if you can guide me to material about:

1\. maheshvaratiirtha

2\. and his Tiikaa tattvadiipikaa on rAmAyaNam. (Salient points, how he differs from other commentators etc.)

  

The book containing four commentaries including tattvadiipikaa gives very little information about him in the preface. There isn't an exposition about the commentary either.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
