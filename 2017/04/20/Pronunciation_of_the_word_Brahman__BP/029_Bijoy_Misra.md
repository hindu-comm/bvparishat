Good. I will study. But most of these have been empirical, not scientific.  

A language can have an anthropology of its own by virtue of geography,  

economy, living style and productivity. Another group can learn and adopt  

if necessary. The research has to be on the time scale needed to create  

an object-based universe. It is also not clear how many objects need be  

identified for the sustenance of an independent economy. Only a sustained  

economy can sustain a language.  

  

I know some of these may sound like challenges, but I think there could  

lie the concept of the development of language.
