Upon rereading my message, I need to correct my following statement: "In bh, we do not have a sequence of b and h, but a co-articulation of a nasal consonant and aspiration." It should read: "In bh, we do not have a sequence of b and h, but a co-articulation of a voiced consonant (b) and aspiration."
