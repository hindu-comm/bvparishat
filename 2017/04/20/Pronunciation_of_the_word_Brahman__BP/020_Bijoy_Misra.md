Dear Abhyankarji,  

Why it can't be the other way, that is the word could exist in local  

language and then adopted to Sanskrit like many other संज्ञा words?  

I am told that the place and river names are connected with the  

popular use. We have rivers like ब्रह्मपुत्र and ब्राह्मणी. Also we  

have ब्राह्मी as a herb.  

Any consideration?
