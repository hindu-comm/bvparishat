The speaker says it is a sutra from Paniniya Siksha and gives the sutra as ऊष्मपरो द्वितीयम् । No such sutra is found in either the Vriddha paaTha or laghu paaTha of Paniniya Siksha. A similar sutra is found in the TaittirIyaprAtiSaakhya, but the sutra is different:

  

प्रथम ऊष्मपरो द्वितीयम्।१४.१२॥

  

Its meaning is very different. When the first consonant in the five vargas (ka, ca, Ta, ta, pa) is followed by an Ushma (श, ष, स), the first consonant is replaced by the second consonant. Example: तत् + सवितुः = तथ्सवितुः (it is not usually printed like this, but many Taittitiyas do pronounce it like this in the Gayatri mantra).

  

So, as far as my knowledge goes, the speaker is mistaken. प्रमादो धीमतामपि।

PS: The pronunciation of Sishtas is the guide and in the Telugu states, Vedic scholars pronounce Brahma with ma apparently being pronounced first.
