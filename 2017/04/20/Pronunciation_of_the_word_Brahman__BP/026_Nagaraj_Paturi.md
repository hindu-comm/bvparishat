Dear Prof. Misra,

  

"a dialect forming through migration and throughvariation of sound through diction and intonation " is only a very insignificant non-universal factor for the formation of dialects.

  

Though I myself can provide authentic theory based on my own research in this area, may I suggest that even going through a general text book like material like [this one](http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/dialectology.htm)can help one understand that the migration aspect is some times not even mentioned in such discussions, though I know that it IS a factor in some cases?
