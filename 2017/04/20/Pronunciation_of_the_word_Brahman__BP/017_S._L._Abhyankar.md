If it can be considered that ब्रह्मन् has in it बृहत् and मत् Then ह्preceding म् becomes just straightforward. Prakrit pronunciations do often depart from the etymological aspects of Sanskrit.

  

Even for a digression, but very much in the context of Sanskrit and Prakrit pronunciations, it came to mind that in some Prakrit dialects they pronounce दुइ which has such sweet correlation with द्वि in Sanskrit. Actually दुइ has द्, उ, इ वर्ण-s. By rules of संधि These veryवर्ण-s become द्वि in Sanskrit. This is in full accordance with संहितैकपदे नित्या. In fact द्, दु, द्वि all have duality inherent. Is not Sanskrit wonderful that every वर्ण has a significance of its own !! The Prakrit pronunciation is also sweet, that दुइ is a sweet simplification of द्वि, eliminating the conjoint consonant.

  

Also in Prakrit languages as Pali, Ardhamagadhi, the Sanskrit word धर्म becomes धम्म. So ब्रह्मन् being pronounced as ब्रम्हन् can be taken as natural simplification in Prakrit.
