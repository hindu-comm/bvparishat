Dear Prof Paturi,  
  

I have not studied the theory and definition of dialects. As I understand from  

the popular use and linguistics, a dialect forms through migration and through  

variation of sound through diction and intonation. In this understanding, a  

dialect is a child, hence the tree logic of the languages. This has built in  

assumptions of population migration and displacement.  
  

The neurological research on human speech would suggest that the language  

is a cognitive expression and than a leaned imitation. This has been also the  

theory of the early Indian linguists through the concept of वाक्. This would mean  

that the object cognition is a human attribute and its expression is an endowment.  

It is not clear if the grammar and syntax would also be part of this process.  

Experiments are not done yet, some hand-waving theories get copied.  
  

I learn that huge Buddhist literature exists on the subject. Hopefully many young  

scholars would jump in for critical thinking with support from the establishment.  

As I see from my point, I can only observe, but unable to solve. I must say that  

major discoveries are waiting.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
