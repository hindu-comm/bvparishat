Namaste



**Question**: On same lines, what would be the proper pronunciation of the Prakrut word \< \< अंहो - अम्हो \> used on Stage by Vidushaka and Female characters ? Any rule based analysis and guidelines please.



1. On **\< ****ब्रह्मन् articulation , where :: ह
preceding in combination by म \> **: The word **ब्रह्मन् as well as ब्रह्म (with and without the ending न्** ) has a Vedic format for \< True and Accented Articulation in Veda Parayana and Yajna = ucchaarana and prayoga-vidhi>. If this articulation –application –practice of ‘Veda’ is moved to the backdrop of ‘ Natya – Prakrut – Social Usage ‘
context, one also would need to explore the articulation of similar words in Stage craft usage and Prakruth where \< **ह combination with म \> are present. **



2. One such word to explore for proper pronunciation may be \< अंहो - अम्हो - इम्हो \> used in dramas, more so by Vidushaka as well as many female characters !



Lexicon would list the meaning of the word as ‘Sin’ ( amho –durita, dushkruta); an Sanskrit- Prakrut expression equivalent to ‘ Ouch..’ in cultured English and \< S\*\*\*\> word in colloquial expressions of current English ? . 



In Regional language ( Telugu / Kannada - social entertainment media usage, the cognate expression sounds **\< **अम्मो\>.****
