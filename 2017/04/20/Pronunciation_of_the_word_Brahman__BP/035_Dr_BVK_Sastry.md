Namaste Achyut Karve



I am responding off the line. Your observation is right. There is a critical urgency to restore the Voice mode teaching – Articulation of Samskruth texts .



Regarding the Articulation of ‘Samskrutha Varna-maalaa’, technically the Shikhsaa of uccharana paddhati :



The Anglicized method of ‘a for apple’ , and ‘a-A’ for ‘ अ आ' - in current education right from early stages has distorted the right ' recognition of Varna- Svara –Vyanjanan - akshara' in listening (shravana) , identifying the sounds properly, memory retention (Dharana –smriti) for accuracy of recognition (varna- svara- pratyabhijnana)
and accurate reproduction ( punah uccharana) .



This has happened in many Veda schools also.



The demand for ‘ Articulate reading of Samskrutha Text’ is considered a backward step in the institutions; memory recall systems are considered archaic compared to googling and conveniences of ‘search using spelling’ in documents. True the device based conveniences need not be given up; But the same amount of effort to ‘ train –culture’ the human user is to be made. After all machine will not go to moksha by holding all Vedas as magnetic memory in its hard disc. And Cloud is not going to be the ‘Akshara-Dhama:: Vaikuntahm’. 



This is an effort which is undertaken by me through my institution ‘Yoga-Samskrutham University’, where the Yoga benefits of Samskrutha Uccharana are being addressed as part of teaching.



Where are you located and a contact phone number please. So that I can talk to you.

I find it very amusing that no work has been done on articulation of Sanskrit letters. The words परा, पश्यन्ति, मध्यमा and वैखरी are current in Sanskrit grammar right from the beginning. However it appears that no one intends to go beyond the वैखरी. The मध्यमा is in fact the articulatory stage of phonation and this too is presented in a mystical way in grammar.

If any one knows on any work that has been done on articulation of Sanskrit letters I would surely be interested in pursuing it.

Achyut Karve.

I have attached a brilliant article by Seishi Karashima on folk etymologies of words like brāhmaṇa in Buddhist literature, and what they tell about the basis of such etymologies in the actual Prakrit pronunciation of such words. Here is what Karashima says on the etymology of the word brāhmaṇa as bāhita-pāpa-dhamma in Buddhist literature:

**Question**: On same lines, what would be the proper pronunciation of the Prakrut word \< \< अंहो - अम्हो > used on Stage by Vidushaka and Female characters ? Any rule based analysis and guidelines please.



1. On **\< ****ब्रह्मन् articulation , where :: ह
preceding in combination by म \> **: The word **ब्रह्मन् as well as ब्रह्म (with and without the ending न्** ) has a Vedic format for \< True and Accented Articulation in Veda Parayana and Yajna = ucchaarana and prayoga-vidhi>. If this articulation –application –practice of ‘Veda’ is moved to the backdrop of ‘ Natya – Prakrut – Social Usage ‘
context, one also would need to explore the articulation of similar words in Stage craft usage and Prakruth where \< **ह combination with म \> are present. **



2. One such word to explore for proper pronunciation may be \< अंहो - अम्हो - इम्हो \> used in dramas, more so by Vidushaka as well as many female characters !



Lexicon would list the meaning of the word as ‘Sin’ ( amho –durita, dushkruta); an Sanskrit- Prakrut expression equivalent to ‘ Ouch..’ in cultured English and \< S\*\*\*\> word in colloquial expressions of current English ? . 



In Regional language ( Telugu / Kannada - social entertainment media usage, the cognate expression sounds **\< **अम्मो\>.

If it can be considered that ब्रह्मन् has in it बृहत् and मत् Then ह्preceding म् becomes just straightforward. Prakrit pronunciations do often depart from the etymological aspects of Sanskrit.



Even for a digression, but very much in the context of Sanskrit and Prakrit pronunciations, it came to mind that in some Prakrit dialects they pronounce दुइ which has such sweet correlation with द्वि in Sanskrit. Actually दुइ has द्, उ, इ वर्ण-s. By rules of संधि These veryवर्ण-s become द्वि in Sanskrit. This is in full accordance with संहितैकपदे नित्या. In fact द्, दु, द्वि all have duality inherent. Is not Sanskrit wonderful that every वर्ण has a significance of its own !! The Prakrit pronunciation is also sweet, that दुइ is a sweet simplification of द्वि, eliminating the conjoint consonant.



Also in Prakrit languages as Pali, Ardhamagadhi, the Sanskrit word धर्म becomes धम्म. So ब्रह्मन् being pronounced as ब्रम्हन् can be taken as natural simplification in Prakrit.
