Dear Shri Karve,

  

  This is a great question, though the answer to this question lies in historical linguistics than in pure Pāṇinian explanations. The pronunciation of Sanskrit itself involves a process that can be described as articulatory simplification in Sandhis. For example, the assimilation seen in examples like grāmāt+bahiḥ changing to grāmād+bahiḥ produces a cluster "db" to replace "tb". In "db", both consonants are voiced, and involve easier articulatory transition, compared to "tb" where one would have to move from a voiceless to a voiced pronunciation. The process of simplification takes on a more intensive dimension going from Sanskrit to Prakrits. For example, Sanskrit pūrva becomes Pāli pubba. The difficult articulatory transitions involved in "rva" are resolved in "bb". In the metathesis of all Sanskrit h-initial consonant clusters in Prakrits has resulted due to articulatory simplification. What is the difference between "hm" and "mh"? In "hm", the initial "h" requires an "open" articulation, while "m" requires a "closure". One cannot pronounce "m" without closing the openness required for "h". This results into a sort of cutting short the pronunciation of "h" to begin the pronunciation of "m". On the other hand, consider the metathesized sequence "mh". Opening up after the closure required for "m" to pronounce an open "h" does not cut short either of the sounds. Additionally, as seen in languages like Marathi, there is a development of spirantized consonants like mh, nh, rh in words like तुम्ही, पन्ह, तऱ्हा, where the Devanagari writing shows a cluster, but the Laghu pronunciation of the preceding vowel indicates that this is not a cluster, but an aspirated m, n, or r, similar to bh being an aspirated version of b. In bh, we do not have a sequence of b and h, but a co-articulation of a nasal consonant and aspiration. So, in my view, going from Sanskrit to Prakrits, it is not merely a metathesis of h-initial clusters, but a complicated process of articulatory simplification. Sorry for a complicated answer, but the question of causation for metathesis is a complex question.
