Dear Mishraji,

  

  Thanks for your comments. Yes, the phonetic distinctions between two ha-kāras, in different contexts, is well known. You observe that Pali Brāhmaṇa, Brahmacariya etc. retain the Sanskrit consonant order of "hm". Considering the fact that everywhere else, Pāli shows metathesis (-nh-, -ñh-,-vh-, -yh-) or epenthesis (insertion of a vowel in forms like nahāpaka, for Skt. snāpaka, rahada for Skt. hrada), several scholars of Pali have wondered if the Pali spellings of Brāhmaṇa and Brahma are merely conventionally written forms, with a metathesized actual pronunciation. This is indeed the case in Marathi, where the words are written as ब्राह्मण, ब्रह्म, but almost always pronounced as ब्राम्हण, ब्रम्ह, even in Vedic recitation. K.R. Norman calls this occasional Sanskritization of Pali: "Following this period, the language underwent a small degree of Sanskritisation (i.e.,MIA bamhaṇa \> brāhmaṇa, tta \> tva in some cases)." In my view, if this is Sanskritization, it is mainly in writing (like Marathi), and most likely the pronunciation was always metathesized.
