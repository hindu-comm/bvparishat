I don't feel it out of place to keep repeating the Dialect- Standard form relation between Prakritas and Sanskrita at least during a few centuries of early history. The essence of this view is that those are not different languages. They are one and the same language in two different usage contexts. What is the name of that one and the same language? To avoid the mistake of privileging one form in preference to the other, we may give some name 'X' to it and say that Sanskrita and Prakrita are two versions: the standard = uniform across the regions -version and dialect = variegated across the regions - version of that single language 'X'. This view helps us in understanding the ancient views such as Prakrita as the apabhrams'a of Sanskrita and the close to etymology view that Sanskrita is the refined version of Prakrita. These two equally valid views exist about the standard-dialect versions of all the languages of the world which have those two forms (standard and dialect). One 'dialectal' form which This Sanskrit-Prakrit 'X' language has and other languages of the world may not have is the 'aarsha' form. That is the reason, western Indologists are not able to grasp the traditional Indian attitude towards the 'aarsha' form.
