नमस्ते श्रीमन् बिजोय्-मिश्र-महोदय !

I like your mention "coexist". It seems Sanskrit and Prakrit did coexist and Lord Hanuman was adept at both. So, before appearing in front of Sitamai in Ashokavana, he deliberated, whether he should speak Sanskrit or Prakrit. So, coexistence of Sanskrit and Prakrit seems to go back in time, as far back as Ramayana.

  

It also comes to mind that for some कृत to become संस्कृत, there needs to be some कृत, which became संस्कृत. Can we grant that, that कृत which became संस्कृत, be categorized as प्राकृत ?

  

But, if we grant that Vedas are the oldest known linguistic compositions, they are in Sanskrit, not in Prakrit. Since Vedas are considered अपौरुषेय and they being in Sanskrit, that makes Sanskrit as the language of the अपौरुषेयम् वाङ्मयम्. Taking clue from पुरुषः प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्क्ते प्रकृतिजान् गुणान् (गीता 13-21) all प्राकृताः भाषाः may be considered as the result of पुरुषः प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्क्ते प्रकृतिजान् गुणान् !! Can we then say that प्राकृत languages are those languages, which bore the influence of प्रकृतिज गुण-s ?

  

Influence of प्रकृतिज गुण-s would include influence of "प्रकृति"-s at different times and places f

-   Influence of time :- During times of British Raj all Indian
    languages became so much influenced by English, that it is often
    difficult now, to speak an Indian tongue, totally devoid of an
    English word.  
-   Influence of Place :- Hindi spoken in Mumbai has come to be known as
    बम्बैय्या हिन्दी.

I consider that such influence of प्रकृतिज गुण-s should not be allowed to have any influence on Sanskrit. People, enthusiastic to promote Sanskrit seem to be permissive of such influence of प्रकृतिज गुण-s. I personally and wantonly did a 10-day course of Spoken Sanskrit. The end-result was, by my assessment, 'sad' for most of the participants and more importantly, for Sanskrit. I certainly abhor that. I consider all such enthusiasm simply as over-enthusiasm. I am making this comment not as an outsider, not knowing how these courses go. I am making this comment after having done the course.
