Dear Satyan Sharma-ji,

  

  Thanks for pointing to the Nāṭyaśāstra passage. The transposition of 'h' in such clusters (Sanskrit: -hm-, -hn-, -hv-, -hy-, -hl-, -hr-) in Prakrits is universal, and is seen in all varieties of Prakrits.
Gradually, as the Prakrits emerge as the first languages of Sanskrit users, the pronunciation of Sanskrit was naturally affected by the phonetics of the mother-tongues of the Sanskrit users. The same process largely continues into modern times, producing regional variation in the pronunciation of Sanskrit. This is similar to the regional variation in the pronunciation of English in India, which is also naturally affected by the phonetics of the regional languages.
