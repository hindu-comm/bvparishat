Dear Sri Abhyankarji,  
  

I think we have to separate the evolution of language from the composition of melodic verses of metaphysics.  

The latter part is creativity and like any creative work, it is an inspiration. Such inspiration has always an  

external channel to it, which we can associate with deep thinking when we are led to look beyond our memory.  

I would think अपौरुषेय as a concept can be observed in all creative works where the artist/composer would  

operate through out-of-body channeling propulsion.  
  

When you invoked श्रीमन् and I followed with श्री we are following a different protocol than what the प्राकृत use  

would invoke. In a material world, the object has a tendency to be identified with a suffix. गणपतिबाप्पा vs  
श्रीगणपति could be examples. It has to do with extending the noun to create a different noun versus qualifying  

a noun with an attribute. When we have an object world, we distinguish the objects and respect their  

existence. In an improved form as we would call संस्कृत, we would create classes of objects in order to  

group them. Classification through prefix could be the origin of उपसर्ग as a concept.  
  

Some such wild ideas come to mind. The evolution of language and the development of Sanskrit should  

be a matter of serious interdisciplinary research. In the west, there is no exposure to the local use of the  

language through the प्राकृत constructs, so it is easy to suggest that प्राकृत is a distorted version of संस्कृत,  

whereas the case could be that संस्कृत is an organized version of
प्राकृत.  
  

As I am reading the नाट्यशास्त्र, the प्राकृत aspects of life comes vividly into play. We don't simply have eyes,  

we have दृष्टि, which can be in myriads and not a function of size and shape of the eye. Such analysis suggests  

that an entire object cosmology could be in practice before the simplification did occur. Taking the case of  

invocation of names, there could be a period of identification through parents and genetic lineage like वाल्मीकि  

gives, which gets reduced to a कुल and finally to श्री.  
  

Hope young researchers would dig further to check on the evolution of language and development of Sanskrit.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
