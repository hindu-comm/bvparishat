I find it very amusing that no work has been done on articulation of Sanskrit letters. The words परा, पश्यन्ति, मध्यमा and वैखरी are current in Sanskrit grammar right from the beginning. However it appears that no one intends to go beyond the वैखरी. The मध्यमा is in fact the articulatory stage of phonation and this too is presented in a mystical way in grammar.

If any one knows on any work that has been done on articulation of Sanskrit letters I would surely be interested in pursuing it.

Achyut Karve.
