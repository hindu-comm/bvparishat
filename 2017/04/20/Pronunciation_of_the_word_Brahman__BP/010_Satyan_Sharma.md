In the Natyashastra's 17th Chapter (somewhere 18th also), which deals with Prakrit, the following description appears:

विपरीतं हमयोगे ब्रह्मादौ… २३ (नाट्यशास्त्र, अध्याय १७)

There is transposition in the group *hma* occurring in words like *brahman*, etc.

According to this, the pronunciation '*bramha*' belongs to Prakrit, while the pronunciation '*brahma*' belongs to Sanskrit.
