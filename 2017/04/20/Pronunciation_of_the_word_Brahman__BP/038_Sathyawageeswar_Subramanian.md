namaste,  
  
I beg that all scholars please forgive my ignorance, but if ब्रह्मन् is derived from बृंह्, could it not be possible that 'bramha' is indeed the original pronunciation,  
with the anusvAra resulting in the 'mh' conjunct? (perhaps to be seen as a standalone case without reference to the मनिन्प्रत्यय)  
  
I am sure this probably goes against the grain of every other example, and probably also  
grammatical rules right from the pratishAkhyAs - particularly anunAsikalopa? I wanted to  
humbly raise the question, though naïve, for some clarity on the basics.  
  
Thank you,  
Sathya
