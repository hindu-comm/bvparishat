The discussion in the cited link appears to be non conclusive. In order to be capable of phonating the two ह's one needs to go to the Maaheshwar Sutras where both the ह's have been instructed. I.e हयवरट् and हल्.
The reason for including two ह's in the Maaheshwar sutra is not merely for making two pratayaharas. That he has phonatedह after instructing all the other letters means that the letter ह in हल् has some special reason and this ह is different from that in हयवरट्.
