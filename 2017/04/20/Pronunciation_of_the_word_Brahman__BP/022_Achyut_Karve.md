Dear Deshpande,

The concept of the process of simplification does not or is insufficient to explain the changes that it brings about in the internal and external effort as well in the dynamics of phonetics. In any case I believe that words as well sentences are inertial frames i.e., that they are not consciously framed.

In the said circumstances I feel that the change over from vedic Sanskrit to लौकिक involved a change in the internal effort. The shift can be described as one from expulsion of air for phonation from the नाभी to the lungs. In other words there was a shift from diaphragmatic air expulsion mechanism to pulmonic air eggressive mechanism resulting in new phonological structures coming into play.

Vedic Sanskrit from my point of view is an art form specially designed for transfer of knowledge through an oral tradition which is not the case with लौकिक sanskrit which was mainly a language of communication.
