Namaste All,  

  

Apologies for bringing this topic back again.

  

As I see from Sastry ji below, does this sutra from Paniniya Siksha related to the pronunciation of the word brahma? Can someone please explain the sutra, and what it translates to?

  

हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्स्थाभिश्च संयुतम् ।

औरस्यं तं विजानीयात्कठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम् ॥ १६॥

  

Thank you,

Ravi Kishore
