Shall we check the frequency of words with the mh cluster and that of the words with hm cluster in Sanskrit?

  

May I request the members add from their memory to the following table?

  

|          |         | |----------|---------| | **mh**   | **hm**  | | simha    | Brahma? | | samhaara |        | | samhati  |        | | brimhaNa |        | |         |        | |         |        | |         |        |
