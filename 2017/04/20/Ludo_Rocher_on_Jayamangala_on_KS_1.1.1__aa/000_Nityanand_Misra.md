This is what the late Ludo Rocher writes in “The Kāmasūtra: Vātsyāyana's Attitude toward Dharma and Dharmaśāstra”

  

Quote

Not only is *dharma*—and *artha*—referred to in the *Kāmasūtra*, Vātsyāyana also establishes a relative hierarchy among the three elements of the *trivarga*, Commenting on the initial *sūtra* mentioned earlier Yaśodhara points out that in the compound *dharmārthakāmebhyaḥ*, Vātsyāyana intentionally fails to comply with a rule of the Aṣṭādhyāyī (2.2.33: *ajādyantam* \[sic\]), according to which *artha* should have been mentioned first in the *dvandva* compound. 'Whether or not the author was conscious of violating a rule of Pāṇini’s grammar, the fact remains that the *Kāmasūtra*, i.e., a text on *kāma*, opens with the word *dharma*.

Not only does Rocher display ignorance of Sanskrit grammar, he completely misinterprets Yaśodhara. This is what Yaśodhara has to say on धर्मार्थकामेभ्यो नमः (१.१.१):

“अर्थशब्दस्याजाद्यदन्तत्वेऽपि न पूर्वनिपातः। धर्मस्याभ्यर्हितत्वात्।” ([Archive link](https://archive.org/stream/Kamasutra-Jayamangala-Commentary-1900/K%C4%81mas%C5%ABtra%20of%20V%C4%81tsy%C4%81yana%20with%20Yas%CC%81odhara%27s%20Jayaman%CC%87gala%CC%84%20commentary%20-1900#page/n10/mode/1up))  

It is obvious from “धर्मस्याभ्यर्हितत्वात्” that Yaśodhara has in mind the वार्त्तिक “अभ्यर्हितं च” on the rule अजाद्यदन्तम्. Theवार्त्तिकexplains cases where that which is moreअभ्यर्हित comes first in the compound. Yaśodhara has simply explained said that ‘artha’ is not first in the compound even though it isअजाद्यदन्त due toअभ्यर्हितत्व ofधर्म. He has not said anything to the effect of Vātsyāyana “intentionally failing to comply” with Aṣṭādhyāyī, rather given a valid reason in the grammatical framework. This is a complete misinterpretation by Rocher.

  

Moreover, it is ironical that Rocher who is himself not conscious of the ‘vārttika’ on Aṣṭādhyāyī talks about whether or not Vātsyāyana was conscious of violating a rule of Pāṇini’s grammar.

  

Am I missing something?
