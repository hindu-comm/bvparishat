=======Moderation Note======

  

Vidwan Sri Achyut Karve-ji,

  

This thread is about the data bases /"banks". Not about research books per se.

  

Please start a new thread on , say, response of university professors to books on research books communicated to them.

  

In that thread, members of the list referred to by you will be able to respond to you, in a generalized way about why such responses are given or not given by them to such books communicated to them.

  

Any specific discussion on the specific points in your book are to be made separate threads, one thread per point.
