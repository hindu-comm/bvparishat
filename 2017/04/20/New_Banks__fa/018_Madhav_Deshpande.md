Dear Shri Karve,

  

  By now I have gone through the pdf of the proofs of your book.
Some of my concerns about your approach, I have already expressed to you in private messages. Here are some of my concerns. Your book does not refer to any existing research on Panini or Sanskrit phonetic texts.
There is no bibliography, at least in the proof pdf that I have seen.
You are assuming that the versified Pāṇinīya Śikṣā represents Pāṇini's own views. However, if you consult the edition by Manomohan Ghosh, there are five extant versions of the versified Pāṇinīya Śikṣā, and besides that Yudhishthir Mimamsak published a prose version of the Pāṇinīya Śikṣā. Numerous scholars, both Western and Indian, have written considerable material on all these different versions, comparing many of them with Pāṇini's own rules, and pointing out differences in the various Śikṣā views and the phonetic categories assumed by Pāṇini's own rules. Your book takes no account of any of this extensive research. You can find extensive bibliographical references in Cardona's survey of Pāṇinian research. Further, your book makes no reference to any of the Prātiśākhyas, so many of them published with commentaries, translations and explanations. You make no reference to such basic works on this literature by scholars like Siddheshwar Varma, let alone to the indespensable "Phonetics in Ancient India" by W.S. Allen. The Prātiśākhyas provide a more accurate view of phonetics of the different Vedic Śākhās, something that no version of Pāṇinīya Śikṣā does. Additionally, many Prātiśākhyas provide access to phonetic understanding that most likely predates Pāṇini. So, again considering Pāṇini without any reference to this extensive phonetic literature does not make any scholarly sense to me. Your focus on Devanagari script is again completely unhistorical in relation to Pāṇini and his time. You should at least look at Brahmi and Kharoshthi scripts that are closer in time to Pāṇini.

  I appreciate your efforts to elucidate Sanskrit phonetics.
However, if you wish to be taken seriously by scholars, you need to write a book that takes into account all the available scholarly research. You are free to argue with it, and disagree with it, but ignoring it completely reduces the scholarly value of your publication.

  I have no intention to offend you or to discourage you from further studies. I have given a general outline of my thoughts about your book, and they are based solely on my perusal of the proof pdf. I hope, in the future, you will extend your research by taking into account the existing extensive research and the wider Prātiśākhya literature. With best wishes for your further work,
