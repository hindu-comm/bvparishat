I have a raw selection of such places in classical commentaries on AshtadhyayI sUtras where grammarians differ in their opinion. Comparative analysis of pros and cons of their stands can be a good research project for Grammar students.

P.S. - As they are based on pure text queries, there are cases of false positives. Html filenames are suggestive of the key word which helped identify potential clash of grammarians.

  

Hope this helps grammarians on list to identify questions for their research students or themselves.

  

Best regards,
