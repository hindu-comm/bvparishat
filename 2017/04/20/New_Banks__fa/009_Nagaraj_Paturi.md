Thanks for your kind words, Prof. Kannan.

  

I understand that UGC is mooting a planned topic monitoring of minor and major research projects through the linking of the new proposals to the old ones and circulating suggested topics for the guidance of applicants.

  

Though there is a criticism against professors allocating sub-topics of their big projects to their M Phil and PhD students, that, in my view is not wrong, as long as it is not imposed on an independently creatively thinking applicant, since all such MPhils and PhDs together can form into a successful research project.

  

Similarly all research-minded individuals, students, teachers and for that matter even individuals outside the teaching-learning institutional set up should be provided an online database system where they can keep storing every research idea they get.
