I had sent copies of a research book on Sanskrit Phonology to none other than Madhav Deshpande, Ajay Pendse, Saroja Bhate, Shri Lale of Sangali,
Malhar Kulkarni of IIT Mumbai, and Peena Madhusudan of Nagpur all guides to PhD. Students. Except for Shri Lale of Sangali none of the others found time to go through the book and comment on it. Then what use is any research if scholars do not have time to go through them?
