Dear Shri Karve,

  

  For your reading reference, I have sent a University of Michigan Ph.D. dissertation by my student James Bare completed in 1975 on "Phonetics and Phonology in Pāṇini - The System of Features Implicit in the Aṣṭādhyāyī", using WeTransfer. This dissertation compares phonetic assumptions in Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī with phonetic descriptions found in Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas. This may provide you some core bibliography on the subject of Sanskrit phonetics and phonology. There is good deal of further research work in this area that was published after 1975, but this dissertation may be a good beginning to read.

  If anyone else wishes to access this dissertation, here is the WeTransfer download link:

The link will remain valid for one week, according to the message from WeTransfer. With best wishes,
