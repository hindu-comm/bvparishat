Namaste

My responses indented below. And this is my personal view. There are seniors – Professor Deshpande, Ashok Aklujkar and many others who can respond to this thread much better.

Thank you Dr Sastry for your kind and quick response,

& thanks for sending a key official document.



Having been in/associated with Western universities for quite some time, how do you find the counterparts of these issues there?

^^^^^^^^^^

BVK Sastry : The answers for ‘Why the Scholar is undertaking ‘research’ / guided for research’ / driven- motivated for research varies vastly in different universities. If the clarity on this emerges, the rest of the line items get automatically resolved.

- If the scholar is seeking ‘Truth ultimate’ , then all the universities all over the world at all times have the same standard : TRUTH FINDING. The application does not matter. Such Saints and Sages of research are bygone species in the current society.

- If the scholar is looking for a Education award, the quality of thesis and theme is secondary; the research pursuit is to fulfill a requirement otherwise defined and out of the knowledge pursuit domain.

- If the scholar is undertaking research to fame and publication –survival in the academia reasons ( Publish and Peril is the ultimate name of the game), then the goal decides and guides the studies. This is common across the east and western universities.



The above set the frame work of how the chemistry between the Guide and the research scholar and Institution that makes the final education award works. It should be obvious enough that ‘ Veda –Research’ in any Indian University would not be the same as in western university, by standards, evaluation criterion and frame of references for research.




----------------------- 





Are there good and sound private endowment schemes in universities to ease the burden on the university or governmental bodies? Do these help in maintaining/raising good academic standards?

^^^^^^^^^^

BVK Sastry : Governmental bodies, Grant providing Private institutions and endowments look at the ‘Return on investment’ and ‘ promotion-market value’ using their frame work of grant award criterion. Just for imagination sake, imagine, if ( and big IF Sri Vyasa were to submit his Brahma Sutra today to a Indian or Western university, stating that the work makes a ‘ Harmonious construction ( samanvaya of Upanishads), would it pass through the Ph.D criterion ? It is doubtful ! Because a work like this which addresses ‘ Moksha’ is not what the ‘ Market –Academia ‘ would like to have as their publication, unless…… ( I leave it to your best imagination to fill the dots).



And why should one expect a funded research in Philosophy and literature, unless it is serving a ‘ National Priority’, a Community need, an advancement in the benefits a community is expecting ? So, a ‘Research on Brahma sutra : Comparative study of the multiple commentaries, how so ever brilliant and illuminating, ends up as a book on the shelf, without reaching the society.



Do we call this Kaliyuga ? OR lack of relevance of research focus Or dis-connect of purpose ? Contra, the research on Biblical texts and resources gets funded in several ways, as it connects to the community and society.

----------------------- 





How do professors there **pitch upon and define right topics** for research - some of which are very novel/innovative/searching and in any case quite demanding and challenging?

^^^^^^^^^^

BVK Sastry : The answer to this question is same as the answer to the Veda sukta ‘ kasmai Devaaya havishaa vidhema’ ? - Find the audience whom the research is going to benefit. This is the VINIYOGA :: UTILITY FUNCTION which in many earlier posts Dr. Yadu and some others have hammered. 



The scholar- research guide needs to be on the move to find out ‘ why and what- how the knowledge transmission takes place across generations, in a relevant way’ – ‘ tena tyaktena bhunjeethah’ - What was passed on to me ? Why should next generation need this, If I did not get benefit from this ? In this limited context, it would mean :What would the scholar want the next generation of scholars to possess as the inheritance ? Why? 



It is also a warning : Don’t pass on the Golden box with Trash inside; Don’t pack the diamonds in toilet paper and pass on.



There is no Sri Krishna to answer the ‘ simple single easy push the button’ - question : Tadekam vada nischitya – yena shreyohamaapnuyaam’ ? ( Gita 3-2 ) . There is a three hundred years bad stables that needs to be cleaned up for anything to even to begin as ‘Real Research in Shaastra and Vidyas of Bharateeya Origin’ which can catch up with the current global expectations and ‘ claims wildly made on what Vedas promise to deliver for the 21 st century society.



So the best bet is ‘ save the stock, knowing fully well the limitations and start the course correction action’. 



----------------------- 





And how are good schools of thought - in any field for that matter - established/nourished/criticised/replaced? Why are these not happening in India, or are they?



If anybody can throw some light on these issues, it will be very useful for our collective introspection.

^^^^^^^^^^

BVK Sastry : The answer is ‘Tapasa Brahma Vijijnaasasva’! And what is Tapas here ? Focus and Intense deliberation, dedication and indulgence with passion as if life depends upon it.



 It will be good to have a private closed door meeting with the ‘ Prospective Indian Researchers and Research Grants
providers’ with clean expectation list and action proposals and scale of funding. 

 It is not good to discuss these intricacies in public lime light. Can you please take pro-active initiative through your institution/ other friends on this ? What I am seeing in the last few years is ‘ wishful thinking and future plans without firm feet on the ground’. It is a ‘ Strategy and Vision issue for those who make a call for Battle: Sanskrit’ and ask for a CSR model support.

Namaste KSK and Team



1. Nice to see a ‘ Hunger expressed for ‘Project Topic Bank’ sans a ‘Bank to Proactively Invest in these ideas – and Society that Benefits from the research’. 



 This is where the shifted stress on ‘ Rakshaa’ –PRESERVATION of Tradition comes in as a Motivation Factor than ‘ Artha-Siddhi /Prasiddhi’ – Benefits of ‘Artha krute, vyavaharavide – Yashase’. ( From Mammata).



 The clarity on research topic and themes to be provided as priority at multiple education strata stems once these priorities and points are firmed up.



2. A thought placed for exploration in this regard : IF these proposed projects need to be funded by public tax payers money and be sustainable, it has to find a ‘ National Priority’ in the Vision of Nation. And this has to be a top document over other ‘ mission documents, reports and committee resolutions and down the line executive guidance’ rules used at the departments, which Treasury can use to disburse the amounts without any camouflage of words ’.



 The starting document could be the 39 page UNESCO - available at url: <http://www.ibe.unesco.org/Countries/WDE/2006/ASIA_and_the_PACIFIC/India/India.pdf> . This takes note of all the Governmental wisdom and directives of various departments and ministries in making some suggestions. This document which was produced in 2006 had a ten year planning vision. Attention is drawn to the sections explaining Higher Education (Page 23) and Education funding by UGC ( Page 38). The document refers to Indian Constitution : Article 29(1) - which ensures that any citizen having a distinct language , script or culture will have the right to conserve it.



May be this can be a starting point to delve further in vetting the list of topics under current research and upcoming studies? ( I am aware and appreciative of the MHRD document that was handled well by Professor Varkhedi).

This is apropos and in furtherance of the ideas of Subrahmanyam and Murthy reg amara-koṣa.

There is indeed a need for a new type of Banks.

(This has nothing to do with the merger of banks into SBI etc.).

We need these :  
A Topic Bank for Projects,  
A Topic Bank for Phd/MPhils,  
A Topic Bank for Seminars,  
A Topic Bank for Conferences,  
A Topic Bank for Workshops, etc.

Many scholars have felt unhappiness with the way our heritage is being handled by the **academia** in the West ( and their chelas here, or even independent thinkers).  
  
If scholars could indicate where and why they were not happy with some of those interpretations, other scholars could look into the merits of the issues, and there will surely be some who can provide wholesome material for study in answering those questions, or provide meta-analysis of the issues. Many times, deep questions raised by others can lead to paradigm shifts in our thinking.

I must cite 2 instances of this - one past, and one recent.

Dr Ramashankar Bhattacharya, a giant of a scholar from Varanasi, wrote a series of articles pointing out some of the errors in the Sanskrit scholarship of the West, and when I met him some time in 1989, he showed me over 60 articles of his as a series - in some Hindi periodical. Another "young giant" among us is Sri Nityananda Misra who has been tackling very academically some of the errors of modern scholarship.

Obviously, there is too much to handle by single individuals, and if a platform can be created where questions can be poured, surely some will pore over them, and provide better insights into issues.

BVP is already doing this in an informal manner, but a more concerted and organised effort should help
