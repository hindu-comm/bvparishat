Namaste KSK and Team



1. Nice to see a ‘ Hunger expressed for ‘Project Topic Bank’ sans a ‘Bank to Proactively Invest in these ideas – and Society that Benefits from the research’. 



 This is where the shifted stress on ‘ Rakshaa’ –PRESERVATION of Tradition comes in as a Motivation Factor than ‘ Artha-Siddhi /Prasiddhi’ – Benefits of ‘Artha krute, vyavaharavide – Yashase’. ( From Mammata).



 The clarity on research topic and themes to be provided as priority at multiple education strata stems once these priorities and points are firmed up.



2. A thought placed for exploration in this regard : IF these proposed projects need to be funded by public tax payers money and be sustainable, it has to find a ‘ National Priority’ in the Vision of Nation. And this has to be a top document over other ‘ mission documents, reports and committee resolutions and down the line executive guidance’ rules used at the departments, which Treasury can use to disburse the amounts without any camouflage of words ’.



 The starting document could be the 39 page UNESCO - available at url: <http://www.ibe.unesco.org/Countries/WDE/2006/ASIA_and_the_PACIFIC/India/India.pdf> . This takes note of all the Governmental wisdom and directives of various departments and ministries in making some suggestions. This document which was produced in 2006 had a ten year planning vision. Attention is drawn to the sections explaining Higher Education (Page 23) and Education funding by UGC ( Page 38). The document refers to Indian Constitution : Article 29(1) - which ensures that any citizen having a distinct language , script or culture will have the right to conserve it.



May be this can be a starting point to delve further in vetting the list of topics under current research and upcoming studies? ( I am aware and appreciative of the MHRD document that was handled well by Professor Varkhedi).
