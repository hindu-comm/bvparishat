Thank you Dr Sastry for your kind and quick response,

& thanks for sending a key official document.

  

Having been in/associated with Western universities for quite some time, how do you find the counterparts of these issues there?

  

Are there good and sound private endowment schemes in universities to ease the burden on the university or governmental bodies? Do these help in maintaining/raising good academic standards?

  

How do professors there **pitch upon and define right topics** for research - some of which are very novel/innovative/searching and in any case quite demanding and challenging?

  

And how are good schools of thought - in any field for that matter - established/nourished/criticised/replaced? Why are these not happening in India, or are they?

  

If anybody can throw some light on these issues, it will be very useful for our collective introspection.
