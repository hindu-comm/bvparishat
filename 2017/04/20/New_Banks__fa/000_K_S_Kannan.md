This is apropos and in furtherance of the ideas of Subrahmanyam and Murthy reg amara-koá¹£a.  
  

There is indeed a need for a new type of Banks.  

(This has nothing to do with the merger of banks into SBI etc.).  
  

We need these :  
A Topic Bank for Projects,  
A Topic Bank for Phd/MPhils,  
A Topic Bank for Seminars,  
A Topic Bank for Conferences,  
A Topic Bank for Workshops, etc.  
  

Many scholars have felt unhappiness with the way our heritage is being handled by the **academia** in the West ( and their chelas here, or even independent thinkers).  
  
If scholars could indicate where and why they were not happy with some of those interpretations, other scholars could look into the merits of the issues, and there will surely be some who can provide wholesome material for study in answering those questions, or provide meta-analysis of the issues. Many times, deep questions raised by others can lead to paradigm shifts in our thinking.  
  

I must cite 2 instances of this - one past, and one recent.  

Dr Ramashankar Bhattacharya, a giant of a scholar from Varanasi, wrote a series of articles pointing out some of the errors in the Sanskrit scholarship of the West, and when I met him some time in 1989, he showed me over 60 articles of his as a series - in some Hindi periodical. Another "young giant" among us is Sri Nityananda Misra who has been tackling very academically some of the errors of modern scholarship.  
  

Obviously, there is too much to handle by single individuals, and if a platform can be created where questions can be poured, surely some will pore over them, and provide better insights into issues.  
  

BVP is already doing this in an informal manner, but a more concerted and organised effort should help
