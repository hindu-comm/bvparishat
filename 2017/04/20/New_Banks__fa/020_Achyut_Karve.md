Dear Shri Deshpande,

Your response is well received and I fully agree with the lacunae that you have brought to light.

My 35 to 40 years of effort was directed at unravelling the nuances of the compositions of classical tabla for which I had no authentic documentation to fall back on. It was not until I could put my hands on the Maaheshwar Sutras that I was in a position to solve the phonetic paradigm. Being a student of the tabla I put the Maaheshwar sutras into the context of laya with the help of the damaru. The revelations that followed thereafter have been put forth in the book. Therefore the shortcomings cited by you are well placed and I hope in the remaining part of my life I would be in a position to address them.

I am not a research scholar and above all I am not Sanskrit literate.
Therefore to stand up to your expectations is a mammoth task.

Once again thank you very much for taking time out and lending your valuable comments.

Yours,  
Achyut Karve.
