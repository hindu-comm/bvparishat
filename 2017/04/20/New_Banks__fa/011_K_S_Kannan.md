Excellent pointers by Prof Paturi and Patel.  
  

Long ago, I had seen a book entitled  

"75 years of Indological Research",  
providing a valuable conspectus of academic happenings  
  

I think we must have one produced **every decade** .  
  

So too, the tradition started by Prof RNDandekar with his Vedic Bibliography  

with annotated notices of writings - books/articles, produced on a very regular basis.  

I guess some 6 volumes or so were produced, but it did not continue.  

  
Theoretically , none may be able to produce a totally unbiased bibliography,  

but having someone do it is much more desirable than none attempting it.  
  

Of course, these cannot be individual projects,  
but ones attempted by fairly big institutions.  

Many, no doubt, are being attempted on smaller/larger scales.  

We also need, then, bibliographies of bibliographies.  

  

Men of vision such as Katre, Dandekar, Ghatage, Raghavan, and Vidya Niwas Misra  
- to sample but a few - are all the more needed today.
