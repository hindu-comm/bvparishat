Excellent guide.  
  

There could be meta-level projects too:  

What have been the typical/majority of PhD topics/themes chosen in India in the past ten years?  

Ditto in Sanskrit/Indological/"SouthAsian"Studies dept.s in the West?  
  

Do all theses generally/invariably conclude with "Suggestions for further research"?  

Have such indicators been followed up?  

Has somebody researched on Emerging/Fading trends in Sanskrit research?  

Have there been projections for the next 10-20 years?  
  

(There was, for example, an era of fixing authorship and dates;  

another of "discovering"/at least mooting interpolations - starting from in the *Gītā* or in Pāṇini etc.)  
  

What topics are more timely/challenging in the near future for research?  

Again, what challenges have remained unanswered ? - etc. may be probed.  
  

These can be good guides for Guides of MPhil & PhD, & for Post-Doctoral work.  
  

\[*Caveat* : If somebody has already reflected on these ideas,  

(s)he might have "stolen" from me retrospectively.  

Cf. Emerson *uvāca*:  

"But the ancients have stolen my ideas."\]
