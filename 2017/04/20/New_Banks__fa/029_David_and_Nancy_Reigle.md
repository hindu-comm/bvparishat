Dr Ramashankar Bhattacharya also wrote a number of articles in English, often pointing out errors of various types. These articles usually pertained to his special areas of expertise, Sāṃkhya and Yoga, and included, for example, pointing out wrong readings in the printed Sanskrit texts of the Haṭha-yoga-pradīpikā. I have collected all of these that I could find, including 40 articles from *Journal of the Yoga Institute*, Santa Cruz, India, from 1971 to 1982. I would be happy to scan these and provide them for any proposed topic bank.
