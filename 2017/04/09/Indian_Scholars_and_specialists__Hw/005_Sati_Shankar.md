vidvatjana,

,

Thanks for referring to this compilation. It is my first attempt in this direction.However, a cursory check of the document tells that compilers were not very careful enough in gathering contacts, so important for the Scholar to ensure reachability. Anyway, we have started building our own list.

  

**It is obvious that not all may have been included in the published list, I have given email in my first post, where Scholars may kindly submit their updated information. While submitting his or her information, Scholars must mention which chapter in their field of study is closest to their hearts and they will be most productive. That will help a lot.**

  

Operational information will be made available on the gsfn website by May-June this year.  

  

Best wishes

Sati Shankar
