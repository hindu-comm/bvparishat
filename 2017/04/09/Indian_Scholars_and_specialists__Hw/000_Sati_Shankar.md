Dear Sir,

[Global Synergetic Foundation](http://www.gsfn.in) (est 1992), is looking for Indian Scholars and specialists in various subjects in Sanskrit, Vedic Studies, and Mathematics for its forthcoming studies and projects it will be sponsoring from this year in India. Is there a published database of Scholars with their specializations?

  

Interested Research oriented Scholars my submit their information with specialization and link to their home page etc. by email, to sch-db\[at\][gsfn.in](http://gsfn.in) .

  

Best wishes

Sati Shankar
