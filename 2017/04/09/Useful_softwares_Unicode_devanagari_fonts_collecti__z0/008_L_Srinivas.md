The link below is not accessible any more. Is there a new link for the Akshara keyboard?

  

Can BVP people point me to a Mac OS facility for entering the Vedic accents udatta, anudatta and svarita - my purpose is to write out the dhatupatha roots with appropriate accent marks for classroom purposes. I am currently using ABC Extended keyboard which serves me very well otherwise.

  

Thanks,

  

Srini
