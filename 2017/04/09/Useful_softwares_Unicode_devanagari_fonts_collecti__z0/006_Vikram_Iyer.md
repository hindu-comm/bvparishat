I have created a keyboard layout for Sanskrit consisting of Vedic swaras of Anudatta, Udatta and Swarita for Rig Veda and the Sama Veda Stobha characters in addition to the normal Devanagari layout. The keyboard layout is hosted on my website and is free to download,

However the keyboard layout is MacOSX only at this point in time. Installation is easy just double click on the .dmg and the keyboard layout will be installed. Post installation one can enable it from System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources -> Akshar
