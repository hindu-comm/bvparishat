Gobind ji,

The subject here has a definite scope: it tries to understand:

1) The linguistic world, or the world-view, contained in our texts (traditions).

2) Does this world-view connect well with hard data?

The answer to 2) is addressed in the maps overlaid by red and blue colors in figures-1 & (by extrapolation) in figure-2 in the paper. So the claim is explicit: regions (“red” and “blue”) are identified and the dominant “directional” behaviors of their residents predicted: if contradictory evidence is pointed out, the present hypothesis fails, simple as that.

Re 1), why should a linguistics based world-view be important?

It should be because it gives insights into Sanskrit, and lets us be nearer to gauging the consistency and depth of basis principles that are potentially very useful if well understood.

The reason perspectives from material Science are not employedd here:

1) Some findings uniquely place the regions south of India as a place of symmetry within the [gravitational](http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/large_1x_/public/import/2013/images/2010/06/goce.gif?itok=b1oMhz8E) as well as the [magnetic field](http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/images/Icolourful.jpg) surrounding the Earth. Yet the subject-matter discussed here in my view doesn't fall in the realm of material Science, at least not per the state of the art of it.

2) Big-bang theory, Darwins’s evolution, Continental shift theories, etc – are again not within the context of the subject matter (which talks about the **present** geography of the sociological, or **linguistic**, realities of the human world).

3) Any comparison with Science can only be done after, not before, understanding the basis ideas of your linguistic world (Shastra). This comparison again falls outside the scope of this thread.

  

Sriram ji,

The book mentioned has a lot of useful Pauranika references in one place, and relates to the subject at hand (even though as you can see the approach taken here is completely different).
