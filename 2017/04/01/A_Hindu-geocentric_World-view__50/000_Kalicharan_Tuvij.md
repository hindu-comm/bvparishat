नमस्ते,  
  

Kindly find attached a short draft pdf on "A Hindu-geocentric World-view"  
  

> Summary:  
> A framework for a Hindu-geocentric world-view, coming as implicit > within sanAtana traditions, is presented; this finds Indian > subcontinent as the geographical focal point of worldly affairs. > Reasonably widely known (as implied by the author) to the Astika > Wanderers since time immemorial, albeit here drawing upon available > empirical detail, this world-view envisions the entanglements of > devatA-s with the mundane realm.  

  

Looking forward to comments from the scholars community.
