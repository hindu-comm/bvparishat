Could not understand the connection of your model with sanAtana tradition and Hinduism.  
  
Present continental placement of earth is better explained by the "Continental Drift Theory" where "Gondwana" was one super-continent quite long back (100s million years ago) and Indian subcontinent was supposed to be part of it. Godwana split-re-split and the parts drifted away. This theory is said to have support of "biological evolution theory" in the case study of "marsupials" (Cf. "Volpe's Understanding of Evolution" -7th Edn). Further evidence for the movement of continents on tectonic plates is now extensive. Similar plant and animal fossils are found around the shores of different continents, suggesting that they were once joined. Gondwana name was given by Australian Scientist Eduard Suess. (By the way, continents are still drifting by tectonic movements).  
  

The history and present status of this "drift model" is described exhaustively by four volumes of "Continental Drift Controversy" (it is no more controversy though in science all theories are essentially provisional) published by Cambridge University Press (2012). One review of these four volumes is found [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EO180008/pdf).  
  

SanAtana traditions and Hindu dharma have as much right on science and objective truth as anybody else.
