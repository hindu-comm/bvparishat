There have been since a few queries (regarding the basis of the observation & the model), so I am listing out here the main pointers (hoping to elaborate later on when time allows):

  

1. Tantra on rivers (Saraswati, Ganga and Yamuna referred to as different nADI-s, not in a fixed order) – a diachronic study; Meru parvata as the MerudaNDa (spine) of bhAratI.  
2. Observations over some time span: of various Indian cultures.  
3. Origin Point (kumAra granthi): PalAnI and Krauncha narratives in PurANa-s.  
4. PalAnI KumAra temple coordinates: \[10.4°N, 77.5°E\]  
5. Indian Ocean - submerged land – KanyAkumArI - Samudra Manthana.  
6. KrishNa and RAma as archetypical Men of right and left orientations respectively. KrishNa ruled DwArakA (West), RAma AyodhyA (East).  
7. The unique feature (of ancient origin) of Idangai (“left handed”) and Valangai (“right handed”) tribes in Kerala and Tamilnadu.
