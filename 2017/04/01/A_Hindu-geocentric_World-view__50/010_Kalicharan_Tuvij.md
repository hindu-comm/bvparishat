Re: the त्रिकोणक representation

  

Recently I came to know about the (“off-the-radar”) tradition of Veda mUrti-s where each Veda itself is known as deity having a unique face:

  

Rg-veda: रासभाननः (Donkey face)

Sama-veda: हयाननः (Horse face)

Yajur-veda: अजाननः (Goat faced)

Atharva-veda: मर्कटाननः (Monkey face)

  

So, even as Ashvin koNa took lead in putting expression to the Veda, this tradition indicates (in the context of present discussion) that -

1) the Rk & the sAma come originally from the Ashvin-vertex (donkey and horse both belong to equus species).

2) Atharvan comes originally from the Hanumat-vertex.

3) Yajus comes originally from the KaumAra-vertex (अज understood as “prototypical”).

  

  

P.S.

a) question- is this tradition limited to Tamil Brahmins only?

b) regarding the nature of PurANa-s (this thread relies heavily on this pramANa): I think a better word to describe them in English could be - neither Reality nor Myth but – “Meta-reality”. Quote, wiki -

**Meta** meaning, a holistic view of **reality** as perceived by a metaconscious mind, who sees **reality** as a whole rather than from a subjective personalized intellectually fragmented point of view.
