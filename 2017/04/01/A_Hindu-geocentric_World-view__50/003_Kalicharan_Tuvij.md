Vidvajjana-s,

Thank you for comments

Indeed tons of evidence, and that’s why this thread.

But first let me say :

We are talking about – 1) Model, and 2) Facts

What we are not talking about here is – 3) Reality

  

Humans, howsoever great or talented, can only build Models on the top of Facts – this is the closest they will ever get to Reality. A better model explains a greater number of facts (which thus become evidence) than an inferior model. So – in the present context – when we talk about the Hindu-geocentric model, we must only confine ourselves to the number (“tons”) of facts it explains, and leave the Truth part to the more intuitive ones among us.

And the model discussed here is a “linguistic model” (though there is no restrictions as to why a linguistic model cant be a scientific one too – but we will not discuss this as well in the present thread).

Next I will be presenting the facts that were already on my mind at the time of writing (upon which scholars may add or subtract from their own knowledge). Meanwhile I am attaching here a slightly updated version of the same pdf.
