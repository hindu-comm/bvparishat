These are the three orthogonal centers of core-competencies which by mutual interactions among themselves create the whole Astika homeland. Linguistically these are the centers of Dravidian, Sanskrit, and Munda families respectively, all other regions in-between being “Krigian geostatistical” mix of the three.

So even as the KaumAra-vertex can be somewhat seen as the first among the equals, the mutual interactions among the three are more on the lines of contemporaneous. For example, the mandAra parvata “used” in Samudra Manthana (a Southern event) is located in the Bihar-Jharkhand (near Hanumat vertex).

Another way to understand this is by the analogy of antenna: the three vertices constitute an antenna array like system — creating a space inside (the triangular region) where they do internal communication (without interference), and a space outside where they transmit the signals.

The three vertices, however, are far from being alike to each other: as discussed earlier, the Southern vertex constitutes of both deva & devi kshetra-s within a rather condensed territory. The other two centres — Ashvina & Hanumat are attuned to deva and devi influences respectively and have a lot of freedom for space and movement.

Ashvina vertex — being deva oriented, outwards looking, and male dominant – was responsible for taking **the lead** in the codifying of Astika knowledge systems in the form of Veda. Both the Veda and the “universal” language it was expressed in were built bottom-up in an industrial-like fashion, even as these truly belonged to the revealed time immemorial inter-communication within the triangle of the insiders’ space.

The next question is: how is kumAra devata (ahvins and hanumAn also being kumAra-s) — of all the devata-s in the pantheon — related with core-competency?
