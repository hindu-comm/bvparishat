Thanks to the wealth of information provided by Respected Korada garu! The following information might be interesting to the discussion on 'sabda-nimittattva' and 'paryaayattva.'  
  

Sankara Bhagavatpaada in his Vishnu-sahasra-naama-bhaashya clarifies the justifiability of thousand names at the very first verse:  
  

"विष्ण्वादिशब्दानां पुनरुक्तानामपि वृत्तिभेदेन अर्थभेदान्न पौनरुक्त्यम् । श्रीपतिर्माधवः इत्यादीनां वृत्त्यैकत्त्वेपि शब्दभेदान्न पौनरुक्त्यम् । अर्थैकत्वेपि न पौनरुक्त्यं दोषाय, नाम्नां सहस्रस्य किमेकं दैवतमिति पृष्टेरेकदैवतविषयत्त्वात् ।"  
  

*Such words as Vishnu and the like, though (repeated in this hymn) are not tautologous. Since the meaning differs with the function. The words 'Sripati,' 'Madhava' etc., though one and the same in meaning, yet it is no defect, since the questioner wanted to know the one Deity whose names were a thousand and because these denote a Devata* - Tr. by R. Anantha Krishna Shastry, 1927.
