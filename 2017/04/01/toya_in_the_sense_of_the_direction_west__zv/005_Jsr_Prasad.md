Dictionary is one of the eight *sakti-graha-upayas*, but not the 'only' means to decode the word meanings. Context - *prakaraNam* matters a lot in interpreting the word meanings. You may recall the discussion on *Cikroda*, recently on the list. After all, dictionary is a manual compilation subject to many revisions. For instance, the popular lexicon Amarakosha lists about 14 polysemous senses of the word 'Hari.' Whereas Taranatha Tarkavacaspati offers 18 senses of Hari. Some times, new words are coined based on the various attributes of the same substance/entity. *Toya* in the sense of the western direction, is seemingly metaphorical. Most of the times, the conventional (रूढि) words dominate the etymological meanings - योगाद्रूढिर्बलीयसी ।
