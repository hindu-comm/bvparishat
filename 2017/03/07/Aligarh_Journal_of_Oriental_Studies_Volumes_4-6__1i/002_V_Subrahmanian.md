Sir,

  

If these volumes have material that would be of interest to the members in this forum, it would be a great help if the contents, i.e. titles, are shared here. A few months ago a member here shared the links to view/download several volumes from the 'Complete collection of back issues of Journal of Bombay Asiatic Society (Old and New Series)'. If the Aligharh Oriental series too has this URL based viewing/downloading facility the sharing of the same will be an excellent idea.

  

Thanks and regards
