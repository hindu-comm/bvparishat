Dear list,  

  

What is the usual practice of punctuation at end of sentences in modern Telugu and Kannada writing?

  

I see that both Telugu and Kannada Wikipedia use the period sign (.) at the end of sentences.

[https://te.wikipedia.org/wiki/తెలుగు](https://te.wikipedia.org/wiki/తెలుగు)

[https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಕನ್ನಡ](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಕನ್ನಡ)

  

Is this also followed in printed books these days? Or is this more an online phenomenon?

  

Contrast this with the practice on Hindi Wikipedia which uses the danda (U+0964) to end sentences.

U+0965

[https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/हिन्दी](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/हिन्दी)

  

The Unicode standard for Telugu (<http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0C00.pdf>) says:

For viram punctuation, use the generic Indic 0964 and 0965.

It has the two codes U+0C64 and U+0C65 reserved, which are supposed to map to U+0964 and U+0965 respectively. But fonts like Arial Unicode MS do not support them.

  

The Unicode standard for Kannada (<http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0C80.pdf>) similarly says:

For viram punctuation, use the generic Indic 0964 and 0965

The reserved codes are U+0CE4 and U+0CE5, and the situation is the same.

  

Is it unusual to mix the danda with Telugu/Kannada Unicode?

  

Thanks in advance, Nityananda
