Dear Vidvan Nityanand Mishra,

  

Period (.) is the default punctuation used for marking end of sentences in the contemporary print & written Telugu.

  

Period along with danda (। or ॥) was used in a mixed fashion in the print in the late 18th century. A sample is as given below from the Telugu Kāvya *Svārōcişa Manucaritramu*printed at Sarasvatī Vilāsa Mudrākşaraśāla in 1863.

Earlier palm leaf manuscripts however appear to have used danda for the same (photo courtesy: Brown University Library.)

We are aware of the tradition of writing Samskŗtam in local scripts like Telugu or Kannada. In such a scenario, danda is used even today in Telugu (and even Kannada to the best of my knowledge) for marking end of sentence.
