Since aadaraNIya Nityanandji's question is concerning contemporary use, let me add that the use of daNDa for Telugu verse in early print days exemplified by the page shared by Sri Raghavendra Kiranji changed and it is no longer used for Telugu verse. But continues to be used for Sanskrit verse quite frequently not necessarily as a rule.
