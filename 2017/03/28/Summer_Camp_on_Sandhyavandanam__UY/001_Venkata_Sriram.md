Namaste,

  

Further to the trailing mail, the brochure has been uploaded and the registration process has started.



The dates of camp is from 10th May 2017 to 21st May 2017. This is a residential camp which is free of cost. The vaTus need not pay anything and everything (morning milk, breakfast, lunch, dinner etc.) is borne by the trust and donors. On the last day, there is an interactive session with old students who learnt sandhyavandana who would be sharing their experiences after they started doing the sandhya. Even the parents are getting inspired when they are watching their children doing anuSTAna.

  

A few parents last year, after watching their kids doing sandhya, have started following the sadAchAra (left the consumption of onions and other tamasic stuff) and started doing sandhyavandanam.



On the last day, a small exam would also be conducted to the students and would be presented with mementos (jayapatraM).



with regards,

Sriram
