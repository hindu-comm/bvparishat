A small section forced a large section to follow discriminatory practices not found in Vedas Agamas or were not the intent of Dharma Sastras. Prevented the spread of education to all in the context of this thread, debarred women, disallowed them to utter Vedas, disallowed them to study Sanskrit, disallowed them to perform ritual meant for men and talked all the time about Dharma. When awareness was felt and freedom was given such minority who followed discriminatory practices are diminishing by the day. The real sistas and correct interpreters do survive is always a ray of hope and worth celebrating on this festive day.
