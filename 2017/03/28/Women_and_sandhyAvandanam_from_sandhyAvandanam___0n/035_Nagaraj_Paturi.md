You probably mean those small section of Indians who resorted to discriminatory practices violated the Indian worldview

  

""I love/like/respect you along with what you are, how you are and what you do as long as it is ethical"

  

and followed the worldview

  

"You do what I do. You be what I am and how I am. Only then are you lovable"

  

I agree.

  

They are worse.

  

Because , at least the converting religious traditions and modernity, convert in order to love.

  

But these hegemonic personality ridden traditionals who were aberrations, who violated the pluralist diversity oriented Indian worldview did not even allow conversion.
