How is this possible?

  

A Brahmavadini has Upanayana in 8th year of conception and finished student hood by age of puberty? Page 295 of Kane's book.

  

For studying one Veda it will take 12 years. If you add 12 +8 = 20. How can age of puberty become 20 years for woman? Not possible.

  

To make it possible we have to ASSUME life span of more than Kali Yuga. Like in Dwapara and Treta Yugas life span was thousands of years. In that SCENARIO age of puberty may be more than 60 years also. In that SCENARIO the Brahmavadini could study all Vedas and finish before puberty. She had enough time to study. In Kali Yuga age of puberty is hardly 10 to 14 years from birth for females. In 2 to max 6 years she cannot study much. She cannot definitely complete in 6 years. 

  

Therefore our Dharma Sastras are CORRECT. Upanayana for women and Vedic Study is possible in other Yugas only. Not Kali Yuga. In Kali Yuga it is PROHIBITED. Simple Arithmetic is enough to show this.
