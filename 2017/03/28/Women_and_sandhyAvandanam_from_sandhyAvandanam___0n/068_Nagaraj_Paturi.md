\>It is a pity that only men seem to be discussing Rights of women.

  

                                   
-Sri G S S Murthy-ji

  

It is the need of the hour to see whether the 'rights' perspective fits in this context or contexts similar to this where the perspective is repeatedly being brought in.

  

Rights issue is inherent in the right not to be harmed as part of dharma. Draupadi had a right not to be molested. DushTachatushTaya violated that right of a woman. That violation was replied through punishment.

  

In such a sense, 'rights' perspective is not alien to Dharma perspective.

  

But with regard to the rituals and details of actions involved, diverse roles of actions, diverse methods of achieving the same goal for different genders , occupation -holders etc., have always been considered as the diversity-centric understanding inherent in Indian culture.

  

Right to moksha, right to puNya were considered as more important than right to a certain path followed by a certain gender or social class for puNya or moksha.
