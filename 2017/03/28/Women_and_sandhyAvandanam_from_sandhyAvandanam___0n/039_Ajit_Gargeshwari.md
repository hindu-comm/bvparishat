Since we are talking of pre-modern period and women, unless we have documentation of women seeking those things which are described as 'denied' to them in that period, we can not justifiably use the word 'denied'.  
  

I cannot understand what do you consider as proof. There is

 

e

enough proof. I need not parade it here. From child marriage to, sati to widow burning denial of education property, rightful place in family and society all related to the mentality of discrimination and denial of education and suppression of freedom.  
  

You say one who raises voice and asks for reforms are making sweeping generalizations you may please have those views its perfect with me.

  
  
"Influence of modernity on us so much that in understanding words such as 'education' too we have a monolithic, uniformity-based view of education."  
  

Are you suggesting to that we should live like people as they lived in the middle ages or ancient past I cannot understand what is being suggested here.  
  

I am glad that a least you said these few sentences. I am in total agreement here.

  
  
"But , in any case, that there were persons who, due to their personality disorders, took the shelter of their own whimsical interpretations of S'aastras to justify their insane behaviors were responsible for the bad image about s'aastras is true.  
  

Equivalents of Vedic hymn recital such as folk song singing, equivalent of purely theoretical courses such as Nyaya, VyakaraNa such as Philosophy (including courses on modern logic), Modern linguistics are being offered in universities. Seats-applicants ratio for these courses is extremely compared to the same for high salary giving courses such as engineering and medicine and many seats in those courses are left unfilled. Still, that 'education' is described as being 'denied' in the ancient times. "  
  

Seats-applicants ratio for these courses is extremely *low* compared to the same for high salary giving courses such as engineering and medicine
