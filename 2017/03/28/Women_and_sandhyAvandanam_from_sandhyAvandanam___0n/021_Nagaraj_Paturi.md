--- Most of the moderns have been raising these questions time and again.

  

\>Is it applicable to both men and women or only to women as men do have an equal contribution towards continuation of ones generation.

  

--- What does 'it' refer to here ?

  

they undergo the monthly menstrual cycle and considered to be '*ashuci*' for 3-5 days ?
