My personal interest in this thread is of the genre-1 kind; albeit I would qualify "we" in "What should we be doing in this period, here, now ? " to be myself and immediate family. Mere shiShTAchAra (or what's left of it) is quite unsatisfactory without clear arguments from the shAstra-s with definite unwavering focus on its essence and intent. I fancy that since we cannot materialize a bRhaspati or brahmarShi, we should get by with the best we can manage via self-study and wide discussion.
