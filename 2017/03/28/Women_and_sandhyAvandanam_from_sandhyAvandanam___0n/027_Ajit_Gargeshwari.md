I heard a rationalist say justifying or trying to justify irrational and superstitious acts in the name of God and forcing it on one own family ,others and society at large is equally irrational and dangerous to the noble principles on which the rihis visualized vedas and Dharma Shastra authors have tried to interpret.  
  
A ritual is a ritual from the ritualistic perspective all rituals gives rise to phala some good some bad depending on the ritual. A ritual is performed independently and is not changed or modified to suit ones needs as the seers of the rituals knew what results a ritual can give and what result a modified ritual can give etc. Unfortunately many rituals are either blindly performed or performed with fear with little or no understanding about ritual itself.
