In Bana's Kadambari there is a reference. Mahashveta was not only wearing a sacred thread but also was performing the sandhya. There it is not stated that she was wearing it like a necklace. In the Shakta tradition women are entitled to the chanting of the Gayatri mantra, the offering of the arghya to the devatas and the upasakas, the aacamana and the like. During the Sarasvati puja, the goddess is offered the upavita with the mantra,  
  
शब्दब्रह्मात्मिके देवि शब्दशास्त्रकृतालये /  
ब्रह्मसूत्रं गृहाण त्वं ब्रह्मशक्रादिवन्दिते //  
Unless there was a tradition of women wearing the sacred thread, the offering of it to the Goddess in the puja would not have come into practice. Many privileges the women enjoyed were lost after the frequent foreign invasions from the 10th century.
