Agree - however, I don't see such argument being made in recent replies (haven't dug up old responses).

That does not contradict claims to upanayana etc.. Yet, if manu is your ultimate authority and not hArita - it may be that way. If you honor hArita and manu equally - there is a clear provision for some women to undergo upanayana, as cited earlier.

Good! Now the fact is that there ARE 2 women. shAstra must cater to such cases.  

  

The following citations may be of interest:  
  

1.  Hotii Vidyalankara : Born to 'kulin' brahmin family she was a widow
    from childhood . She became an authority on vyAkaraNa, poetry ,
    smRti , Navya-nyAya and established her own 'chatuspathi' ( centers
    of higher learning ) at Varanasi ! Panditas bestowed her with the
    title of Vidyalankara . She died at an advanced age in the year 1810
    . \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/I6MuDEx.jpg)\] 2.  Hotu Vidyalankar/ nee Rupamanjari: She was not a brahmin , but her
    father , Narayan Das noticed her exceptional intellgence and sent
    her at the 'chatushpaathi' of a brahmin pandit . There Rupamanjari
    mastered Ayurveda , vyAkaraNa and other branches of studies . Her
    fame spread far and wide and students used to come from far off
    places to learn or get opinions on Ayurveda , charaka-samhita
    andvyAkaraNa. Ayurvedic doctors of the age used to consult her on
    matters of medicine ! Rupamanjari never married andkept her head
    shaven with a 'shikha' ( Chuda / tuft of hair ) and dressed as a man
    . She died 100 years of age at 1875
    .\[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/I6MuDEx.jpg)\]
