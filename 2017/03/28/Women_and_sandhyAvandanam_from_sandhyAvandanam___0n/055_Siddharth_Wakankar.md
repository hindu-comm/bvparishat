Scholar Friends,

  

It may be noted that it was the Arya Samaj which tried its best to keep the Light of the Vedas and the Paninian System of Vyakarana (following the Ashtaadhyaayee and not the Kaumudi style) intact against odds.The followers of Kaumudi system may not accept Arya Samaj view-point,but you cannot summarily reject it,without giving valid reasons

.

I am not a follower of the Arya Samaj,but,you cannot deny a thing because it annoys you. You may disagree,that is all.

  

I think,this is the point of Dr.Ajitbhai.I thank him for his objective outlook.

  

S.Y.Wakankar.

  

Best Regards,
