I was talking about Sanskrit learning and education being denied to women. I am not engaging in any debate on modern education.  
  

Sati was and and taboos affecting widowhood was practices throughout India and even now to large extent. That needs another thread.  
  

I did not call agriculturist, a carpenter, a fisherman etc. as uneducated. They don't have the expertise to understated Dharma Shastra and veda as such knowledge is always denied to them. Sanskrit and Shastric denied by force and birth not by choice.  

  

Sanskrit and sastras were denied to women from middle ages till awareness grew and we have many good women Sanskrit Scholars
