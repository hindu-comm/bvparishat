Who is a 'dvija?' one who is twice born (द्विर्जायते इति द्विजः) is dvija. The intellectual, the warrior and the trading classes are called dvijas. Earlier, the verse 'पुराकल्पे तु नारीणां...' has been quoted by Prof. Korada ji and Sri Subramanian ji. In that sense, it may be most likely that women of ancient times, qualify for a 'dvija?' I believe, with regard to forbidding women from the nitya-karmas (one of the three types of karmas) was/is not based on 'social' gender.  
  
But, instead, it could be based on their 'biological' gender (so, gender has two senses, social&biological) they were/are avoided in Vaidika karmas; since they undergo the monthly menstrual cycle and considered to be '*ashuci*' for 3-5 days. Gynecological aspects such as pregnancy etc., add heavily to this too, as they consume little over nine months.  
  

Another example - when men do saashtaangam, it is performed as per injunctions of dharma-shastra. Where as women should not do the same way, why? Because their garbha/uterus should be protected by all means (furthermore, as per dharma-shastra, elders say that their वक्षस्स्थल should not touch the ground - भूमाता). I think, these kind of reasons may form a justification between the difference of ways of men and women performing nitya/naimittika/kaamya karmas.

  
  
If nitykarma implies bhakti then why the difference.  

  

As per the above justification there should not be any discrimination that can be symbolically seen from thee following giitokti-  

यत्साङ्ख्यैः प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते । (5.5)
