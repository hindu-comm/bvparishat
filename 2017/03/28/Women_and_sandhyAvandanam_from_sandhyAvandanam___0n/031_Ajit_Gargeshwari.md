Unfortunately the consequence "You must allow me to be what you are, how you are and allow me to do what you do since that is the way you love me or respect me." is never implemented across societies for many leaders will then find themselves dispensable. and where education penetration is low the matter complicates. Live and Let live is an ideal out look unfortunately ignored and it is always live for today at any cost
