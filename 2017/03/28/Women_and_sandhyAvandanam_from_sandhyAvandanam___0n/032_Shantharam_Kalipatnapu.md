Namaste to all,  
  
I would like to state some. In Devi Bhagavata Mahatmyam, it is said that  
  
विष्णोरंशो मुनिर्जात: सत्यवत्यां पराशरात् । विभज्य वेदांश्चतुर: शिष्यानध्यापयत्युरा ॥१४॥  
व्रात्यानां द्विजबन्धूनां वेदेष्वनधीकारिणाम् । स्त्रीणां दुर्मेधसा नॄणां धर्मज्ञानं कथं भवेत् ॥१५॥  
विचार्यैतत् तु मनसा भगवान् बादरायण: । पुराणसंहितां दध्यौ तेषां धर्मविधित्सया ॥१६॥  
  
The 25th slokam should imply that Women do not have right to Vedas and Nitya Karmas.  
  
Also HH Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati mahaswami has clearly stated that  
  
  

Men marry after their Upanayana and student-bachelorhood. Now for women marriage itself is Upanayana. Just as a boy dedicates himself to his guru, a girl must dedicate herself to her husband from her childhood until the start of their conjugal life and beyond. The Manusmriti says: "Strinam upanayanam-sthane vivaham Manurabravit" (Manu says that for women marriage is in place of upanayana). If you ask for an external sign of this like sacred thread worn by the men, we may at once point to the married woman's mangalasutra.

I said that "Upanayana" means "taking near", taking a boy near his guru for his brahmacaryasrama. A woman's guru is her husband. Being joined to him in wedlock is her upanayana."  

  

You may read more about it at <http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part18/chap2.htm>.  
  
ThankYou
