Thank you Prof. Korda for confirming Dharma Shastras have no sanction for women doing Sandhyavandana as a ritual men do it. The Ramayana verse doesn't imply what Murtyji is saying. The commentators has not explicitly implied the word in the given verse to mean Sandhya Vandanam as a ritual as Prof Prasad has mentioned.  
  
Arya Samaj are different group all together where they have their own interpretations.  
  
We live in a changed time where gender equality is major issue. Women may perform any ritual if they choose to. As women are going to court to enter temples they may also perform any rituals.  

Amantraka sandhyavandana or any ritual explains गायत्रीमन्त्र and द्विज
