Dear Shri Korada ji:

  

Thank you for your detailed clarifications.

  

I am not a Vidvan especially in front of people such as yourself. So kindly avoid referring to me as such.

  

I have a further doubt.

I have heard that a child (male/female) bears the karmas of the mother till 7/8 and the father till 14/16. (Unsure of the source for this)

Does this not also include the merit of any nityakarma / tapasya performed by parents?

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
