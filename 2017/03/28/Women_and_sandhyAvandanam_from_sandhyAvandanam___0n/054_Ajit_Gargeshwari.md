Can Chandrasekarji

answer why Arya Samaj is not as per shastra. Arya samaj have always argued their view is as per the Shastras. Shastras codify usage and practices of sistas of a given time. If sacred thread were worn by women and their use is now discontinued one has to trace when the scared thread were worn by women and when their usage discontinued. If shastras as interpreted by ancient an modern commentators do have specific comments on the usage of sacred thread by women those texts should be pointed out. Prof. Wakankar pointed out that Arya Samaja followers do have the practice of women wearing the sacred thread. Since Arya Samaj primary motto is 'Back to the Vedas' one has to pursue the matter further.
