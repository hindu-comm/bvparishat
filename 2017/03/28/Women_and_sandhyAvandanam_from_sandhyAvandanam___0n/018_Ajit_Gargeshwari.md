Thank you this answers my queries to large extent.  
  

"Why was this rule formed specifically for women " it could be based on their 'biological' gender (so, gender has two senses, social&biological) they were/are avoided in Vaidika karmas; since they undergo the monthly menstrual cycle and considered to be '*ashuci*' for 3-5 days."

  
Because their garbha/uterus should be protected by all means (furthermore, as per dharma-shastra, elders say that their वक्षस्स्थल should not touch the ground - भूमाता). "  

  
Is it applicable to both men and women or only to women as men do have an equal contribution towards continuation of ones generation.  
  

When there is death in family or when men have contagious infections can nitya Karma be performed. If answer is no them is there a bias towards a gender paying only lip sympathy towards equality men and women or was gender equality applicable only to rishis and Gods and not to men.  
  

Restricting my questions only towards nitya karmas as this thread can only discuss Nitya karma and Sandhyavandana is apart of Nitya karma.  
  

I am sorry does any body else get these question is it only me gets such questions?
