Mandana Misras wife was asked to be the judge in the great debate that took place between Sanakara and Mandana Misra as traditions have recorded. During Sankaracharyas time women were great scholars.  
  
Women were Vedic Rishis and Rishis have no gender or caste distinction. From high ideals to twisting shastras to suit ones needs  

Lighting a lamp or doing pujas without reciting vedic mantras as many women do were not probably implied by the sages for whom vedas got revealed or Gayatri mantras got revealed. Many dharma shastras quickly brush aside tough question by saying there not applicable in Kali age and quickly quote yuga dharma. If rituals and their traditions needs to continue it may not be a bad idea to involve women also in rituals which are exclusively reserved for men. For performing shraddha there are certain exceptional cases where women can perform. Ramayana verse doesn't say about Sita performing Sanadhya vandana ritual though Ramayana holds women in very high esteem.
