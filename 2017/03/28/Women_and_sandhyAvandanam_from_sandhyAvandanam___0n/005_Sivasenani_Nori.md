The way I heard it, Sandhyavandanam is a nityakarma. **Everybody** has to do it. Those who have Veda-adhikaara should do it with Vedic mantras; others should do it with Slokas or shouldat least recitethe twelve names of Aditya. Also, when Suryanamaskaras are taught to children, the twelve names are taught along with the different poses.
