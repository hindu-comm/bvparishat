Namo Vidvadbhyah.  
I read the whole thread and saw how things took a complete Uturn.  
I would like to clarify that we find reference to Sandhyavandanam in Aashauch in granthas like nirnay sindhu and dharmasindhu. Not only in Aashauch, but also in Grahan.  
A Brahmachari, only has to bathe for Shuddhikaran, he can perform Sandhya afterwords. A grihastha will have to wait for 10days minimum and 40days maximum to resume his  
Sandhyavandanam. He can perform Manasi Sandhya though. Further clarification was given by a schollar above.

Sandhyavandanam in rivers is the best type of Sandhya. It is considered Sarvottam and Sandhya near Shayya is considered Adham.

Women were indeed allowed for Gayatrijapam probably in Satyayug and pratham charan of Tretayug. Then came the incident of Vrittrasura Hananam. Indra killed him and was doshi for BrahmaHatya. That sin was then passed on to trees(in form of sap), sea(phen), bhoomi(that whitish substance that comes out) and women(rajodharm). From that time women were prohibited from Vedadhikaar as they have to suffer the BrahmaHatya Dosh of Indra.

Sandhya is never to be stopped, not even in Yatra. There is a provision for 3 Sandhyas to be performed together. "Ekatantrena trikala-sandhyaam aham karishye". Provided 1 extra arghya should be added to each sandhya the next in form of prayashchitta.
