This is the worldview that has been vital and central to Indian culture. This is the secret of its characteristic pluralism and diversity.

This is the worldview of all cultures and traditions believing in converting the other person into what the converter is. Modernity has imbibed this worldview. That is the reason modernity is leading to these illusions of 'discrimination'. It is uniformity-imposing, diversity-destroying and anti-pluralistic.
