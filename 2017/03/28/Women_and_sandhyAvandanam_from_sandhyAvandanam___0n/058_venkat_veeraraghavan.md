Dear Learned members,

  

It was enlightening to see your arguments.

  

Here below I give my 2 cents:

  

Shri Korada ji said that nowhere has it been mentioned that Sandhyavandanam is to be done in a river.

There are 2 sides that I would like to present in this regard giving 2 different persepectives.

Rationally speaking: River / lake water was used in olden days in lieu of taps. Water as we all know is essential in performance of nityakarmas. What better place than a river in olden times?

Scripture wise: The Narayana upanishad in the section on gayatri avahana mentions "prithvi yonih.." where in it can be construed that the essential nature of Gayatri is intimately connected with mother earth and rivers being the nadis of mother earth sandhya worship was done in rivers.

In this regard a siddhapurusha I knew opined that Gayatri japa is always meant to be done in a river/ ocean to counteract the overworking of the suryanadi thereby balancing the heat generated from prolonged japa. This person also had some radical notions about the Gayatri for this age being a new mantra while the Rshi Gayatri was a different mantra altogether. (This last point however makes no sense to me since the Savitri in its current form has been widely mentioned in both Smritis, Shrutis and Upanishads not to mention texts of astra vidya).

  

Regarding women not being given right to nityakarmas the following is my humble opinion:

Feminism and forced equality is a modern western construct that trashes any paradigm that does not agree with its tenets to the letter. Trying to analyse the motives of the Rshis with such a blinkered approach would be to ignore the bigger picture.

Manu clearly states that women remain under the protection of their fathers, husbands and sons at different stages of life. Women were considered as shakti and automatically received 50% of the punyakarma of their protectors(father-husband-son). When this be the case where is the question of double standards?

Added to this Vedic Rshikas like vAgambhrini, Lopamudra, Gargi et al are testimony to the fact that women had the independence and right to knowledge. How did a Gargi or a Lopamudra or a Devahuti find mention if not for their thirst and acquisition of knowledge?

Even today in a cerebral game like chess the of the top 100 grandmasters 98 are men and only 2 are women. Is this because of sexism? Or lack of equal opportunity?

Not so. Women have different biological and psychological priorities compared to men and trying to forcefit artificial equality on them in the name of feminism/ social justice is no less cruel than a couple of pushy parents trying to get an artistically inclined son to excel at math.

Coming back to point, women in the time of Ramayana were worshippers of fire. They had to prepare the altar and the offerings while the man offered the ahutis and both partook of the results.

Else why would Sita call upon Agnideva of all Gods to witness her purity?

विशुद्धभावां निष्पापां प्रतिगृह्णीष्व मैथिलीम् \|

न किंचिरभिधातव्या अहमाज्ञापयामि ते

Agni to Sri Rama: "Take back Mythili, who is sinless, with a pure character. She should not be told anything harsh. I hereby command you." (Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda)

  

Since Sri Rama was Himself an agnihotri He could not disobey Agni deva. This is why He could not tell Sita about Her abandonment directly later in Uttara khanda and had to act through Lakshmana.

  

The point is irrespective of who did what the vedic marriage is a beautiful picture of cooperation where each partner does what they do best and the result is not only synergistic but productive of immense merit to all concerned.

  

I have nothing to say about the modern rationalist movement which tries to force women into places they have never been before. If these rationalists really dont have implicit trust in the Rshis or their words why even bother? Only they can answer!
