According to Shastras the Vedas is Shabda Pramana ie., Sound of vedas itself need to be preserved and made sure that correct tone and prounounciation is maintained. But as far as I know, Arya Samajists prounounce Vedas not in proper tone or pronounciation as given to us by the rishis. But in a different style unique to Arya samaj.  This is just an example. Likewise, there are other differences for instance the Shastras says Gayathri mantra needs to be recited only by Dvijas ie., one who has undergone Upanayana samskar but I see Gayathri mantra made as a regular mantra for all in Arya Samaj.
