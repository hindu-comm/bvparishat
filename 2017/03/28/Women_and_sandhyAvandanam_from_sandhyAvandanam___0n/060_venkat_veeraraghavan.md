Dear Shri Vishvas ji:

  

I was merely suggesting Manu smriti as a "worst-case" scenario. I was not posting any contrapoint to hArita.

I have no axe to grind whether women performed Nityakarma or not.

I am merely exploring possibilities here.

  

The citations you have given only show that both ladies learnt vedAngas (do correct me if wrong) and not much information is given on whether they learnt the vedAh which would be implicit if they were performing nityakarmas.

However the puranas do attest to the fact that women had access to learning from the way sItA and pAnchAli debate with their husbands on the basis on shastra. This would not be possible without deep learning.
