Thanks aadaraNIya Sivasenaniji, for this view.

  

That is how I have been taught.

  

Nityakarma means activity natural to all beings all over the universe.

  

Sun worship is almost a universal cultural practice. In different parts of the world, it had different forms before they were wiped out in the name of anti-paganism etc.

  

Particularly in India, I grew up watching people of several different castes offering arghya and namaskaras to Sun.

  

They did not know that that is called arghya.

  

Without using any Sanskrit lines, they used to do exactly what diṅnamaskāra-s mean, facing all directions.

  

It looked almost like an amantraka Sandhyavandanam.
