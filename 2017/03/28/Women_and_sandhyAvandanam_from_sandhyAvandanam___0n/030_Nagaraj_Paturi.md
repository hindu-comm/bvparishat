The word 'discriminatory' is the crux of the problem in all such contexts:

  

One worldview is:

  

"I love/like/respect you along with what you are, how you are and what you do as long as it is ethical"

  

Consequence of that is,

  

"I love to be what I am, how I am and what I do, I celebrate what I am, how I am and what I do since you love/like/respect me along with what I am , how I am and what I do as long as it is ethical"

  

Another worldview is :

  

"You do what I do. You be what I am and how I am. Only then are you lovable"

  

Consequence is:

  

"You must allow me to be what you are, how you are and allow me to do what you do since that is the way you love me or respect me."
