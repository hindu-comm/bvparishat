While preparing for a talk on "Science and Technology in the Vedic Period"  

I encountered the word सन्ध्या as a cosmological phenomenon.  

There are various efforts to delineate the transition between states and  

map it into feelings, words and icons. The value judgement between  

the states would appear like a religious imposition by the later thinkers.  

My slides for the talk are now available and I can share. Please write  
to me privately if you would be interested.  
I will try to write it up as a paper later.  

Best regards,  

BM
