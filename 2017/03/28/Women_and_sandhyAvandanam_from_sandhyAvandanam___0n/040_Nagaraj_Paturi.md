Sati to widow burning?

  

You mean Sati i.e., widow burning?

  

Was there Sati among non-Kshatriyas? What is the percentage of Kshatriyas in the entire Indian population?

  

Within this minuscule percentage, were there no widows that were not burnt?

  

What percentage of the entire Indian widows underwent Sati ?

  

Education?

  

I said:

  

"Influence of modernity on us so much that in understanding words such as 'education' too we have a monolithic, uniformity-based view of education."

  

You respond saying:  
  

Are you suggesting to that we should live like people as they lived in the middle ages or ancient past I cannot understand what is being suggested here.

  

Is there any connection between my sentence and your response?

  

Let me elaborate for your convenience:

  

When somebody is calling an agriculturist, a carpenter, a fisherman etc. who did not receive modern education as 'uneducated', it means that that somebody is not able to recognize that the knowledge of agriculture, carpentry, fishing etc. of these as 'education'.

  

Even among the contemporary professionals, an auto-mechanic who did not receive modern schooling is considered as 'uneducated'. His knowledge of auto-mechanism is not considered as 'education'. Examples can go on and on from among such contemporary professionals.

  

This description as 'uneducated' is resulting from understanding only modern schooling as 'education'

  

Similarly those who did not receive traditional Sanskrit education are being described as beinng described as those who were 'denied' 'education'.
