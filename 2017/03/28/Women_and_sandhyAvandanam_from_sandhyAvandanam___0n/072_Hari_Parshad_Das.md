Sure Vedas are apauruṣeya. Your point is well taken. However, according to convention, the draṣṭā of the mantra gets credited as the composer. Just like the Kāṭhaka branch of the Veda is not created by Kaṭha, but propagated by him. Similarly, Agni Purana is not originally the creation of Agni. However, it is due to convention only that sometimes, these personalities are named as composers of certain literature/mantras.
