Pls refer to the topic "अशौचे सन्ध्योपासनं" ofअशौच काण्ड fromस्मृतिमुक्ताफलम्

  

<http://vaidyanatha.ambaa.org/SMP3_aashaucha.pdf>  

  

The sandhyavandana, which is a nityakarma, should never be quit. During ashaucha, one should perform the karma till till arghya-pradAna and the rest should be done mAnasika.

  

Only those who are bedridden and cannot perform, for them, their sa-gotrikAs like brothers can perform in their name and give the gayatri tirtham to them.

  

regs,

sriram
