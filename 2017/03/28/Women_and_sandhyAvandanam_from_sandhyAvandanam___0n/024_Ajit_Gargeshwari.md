I meant to say protecting garbha/uterus for women and generative organ for men/ vitality is equally important to continue ones generation and to have healthy off springs. I am not questioning hygiene. But misusing the word hygiene making it discriminatory and arbitrary is the problem. In practice the emphasis often is on ' purity -pollution' rather than on physical cleanliness / physical uncleanliness.  

  
Many other prohibitions beyond such books are either local customs or svakapolakalpitas.    
  

The emphasis is always on svakapolakalpitas. which is the unfortunate part.  
  

I shall try to read the books and articles that have been mentioned to better understated these discriminatory practices and to get the right perspective.  
  

Thank you Prof. Paturi and Prof. Prasad, Prof. Korada and other scholars for having responded to my questions
