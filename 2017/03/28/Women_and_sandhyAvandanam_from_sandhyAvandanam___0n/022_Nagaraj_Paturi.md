There was a thread on BVP on "Ritual purity in Hinduism"[here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/ouQtuO4mOxE/aqX_uJD_AgAJ;context-place=forum/bvparishat).

  

In that thread, I said :

  

1\. The word 'ritual purity' is already an English word. Both the components of it'ritual' and 'purity' are from outside the system that we are talking about it.

  

2\. Cultural Anthropology is the modern discipline that deals with the concept of 'purity' from an intercultural, global, comparative perspective. There, it is always dealt in contrast with another concept 'pollution'. For example, what you discussed under 3 below is called 'ritualpollution'.

  

3.Your example shows that what you have in mind is, obviously,a 'purity -pollution' which is different from physical cleanliness / physical uncleanliness. 

  

4.In Cultural Anthropology, the culture-insider's ideas are called 'emic' ideas and the analyst's categories are called 'etic' categories. Emic categories in Sanskritic tradition for the purity-pollution that you are talking about are 's'oucha-as'oucha'.

  

5\. What you described under 3 below is called mrita- as'oucha. There is jaata as'oucha too.

  

\>I am looking for books and articles that critically deal with the concept of ritual purity in Hinduism.

  

---- 6. There are studies by scholars like Prof. T N Madan and Prof. McKim Marriott on these issues from aCultural Anthropological perspective.

  

7. Bhakti traditions such as Veerashaivism consider that Deekshas such as 'ishtalingadhaaraNa' can nullify such as'ouchas. There are many other traditions which do not negate the idea of as'oucha per say, but consider a certain tool or tools of their tradition can nullify the as'oucha.

  

8. In general,what ritualsare not to be performed by a person inas'oucha etc. are covered in books such as Dharmasindhu.

  

9. Many other prohibitions beyond such books are either local customs or svakapolakalpitas.
