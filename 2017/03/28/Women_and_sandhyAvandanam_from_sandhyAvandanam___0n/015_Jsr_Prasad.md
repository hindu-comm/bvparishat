Yes, I appreciate your example to Ubhaya Bharati, Ajit ji. However -

all that we need to see is whether Siitaa maa qualifies for a 'dwija' as per the vyaakhyaa-kaara. Ramayana epitomizing women in high esteem has nothing to do with her grant of performing sandhyaa-vandanam. After all, Ramayanam is not only **राम**स्य अयनम् but also **रामा**याः अयनम् ।
