Are there are instances to show Dvijas were women? or does the word mean only men. I am asking this question out of curiosity to understand the role of women in Nityakarma. If Nityakarmas are for purifying the mind do men and women women have different ways to purify their minds? If nitykarma implies bhakti then why the difference. If Nitykarma is for the sake karma and nothing else then Karma and its phala does it happen different for men and women? As Sandhya Vandana is a nitya Karma why is it not exclusively said in Dhama Shastras and smritis it is obligatory for all dvijas.Please help me to understand my questions in the right perspective.
