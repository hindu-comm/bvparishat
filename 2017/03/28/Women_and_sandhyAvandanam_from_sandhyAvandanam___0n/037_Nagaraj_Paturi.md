By 'small section', I mean a small section of those who through sweeping generalizations are described as the 'discriminating' class.

  

Fortunately, their influence did not reach the large section of those who through, again sweeping generalizations are believed to be and/or are projected to be discriminated.

  

Influence of modernity on us so much that in understanding words such as 'education' too we have a monolithic, uniformity-based view of education.

  

Only if I am allowed to acquire your 'education', I will consider you to have allowed me to get 'educated' is the feeling resulting from this uniformity-centric , anti-pluralistic, anti-diversity worldview.

  

Equivalents of Vedic hymn recital such as folk song singing, equivalent of purely theoretical courses such as Nyaya, VyakaraNa such as Philosophy (including courses on modern logic), Modern linguistics are being offered in universities. Seats-applicants ratio for these courses is extremely compared to the same for high salary giving courses such as engineering and medicine and many seats in those courses are left unfilled. Still, that 'education' is described as being 'denied' in the ancient times.

  

Since we are talking of pre-modern period and women, unless we have documentation of women seeking those things which are described as 'denied' to them in that period, we can not justifiably use the word 'denied'.

  

But , in any case, that there were persons who, due to their personality disorders, took the shelter of their own whimsical interpretations of S'aastras to justify their insane behaviors were responsible for the bad image about s'aastras is true.
