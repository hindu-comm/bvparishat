Namaste,

  

I am comparing theहनुमानचालीसा of both Gita Press and Mahaviri Tika.
Found slight variations:

  

हाथ बज्र औ ध्वजा बिराजै । काँधे मूँज जनेऊ साजै ॥  

  

In Mahaviri, instead ofऔ it isअरु ; and instead of साजै it isछाजै .
In some of the books, i findऔर. 

  

Are there any variations in avadhi language also? What exactly is the meaning here.

  

Does Hanumanji carry both vajra and dhvaja ?

  

or

  

Hanumanji carry dhvaja in His vajra-like powerful & strong hands

  

or

  

Hanumanji carry vajra like powerful mace (gada) and dhvaja ?

  

  

regs,

sriram
