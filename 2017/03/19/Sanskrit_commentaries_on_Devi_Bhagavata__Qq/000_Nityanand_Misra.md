Dear list

  

I am looking for Sanskrit commentaries on Devi Bhagavata.

  

A book on DLI has an incomplete Sanskrit commentary from the seventh skandha onwards. The first few pages of the PDF have scans of torn pages. Is anybody aware of which commentary this is and where the first part can be found?

  

<https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.344807/2015.344807.Devi-Bhagavat>  

  

Are any other Sanskrit commentaries on the Purana are available online?
