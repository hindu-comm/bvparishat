Namaste

One help/guidance needed.

Someone asked me to give them the meanings of character names in Ramayana. Eg. रामः -- रमन्ते योगिनः अस्मिन् इति रामः, (or such kind of meanings.)

I just wanted to know if there is a list already made upon this by anyone, in any book, work, or any net-resource from where I can have them. If unavailable, then please guide me how to proceed about (-where to see and how to get them.)

Thank you all in advance.
