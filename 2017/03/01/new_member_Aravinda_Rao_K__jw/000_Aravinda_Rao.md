Dear all, namaskars to all,

  

I introduce myself as the new member to this learned group. I am K.Aravinda Rao, a student of Vedanta from Hyderabad. I have been included in the group courtesy Dr.JSRA Prasad, HOD Sanskrit, University of Hyderabad. I know some of the members of this group and I am sure to be benefited by the discussions.

  

I wish to know whether there is any method of searching for certain specific words in the Vedic texts. For instance, if I wish to know whether there is any reference in the Vedas (either in samhita or brahmanam) to the names of Ahalya and Gautama, is there any method of search?

  

The reason for the query is that I have recently started talking on Valmiki Ramayana in the traditional style and I wish to cover the whole text without leaving any episode. I am finding it difficult to know the symbolism in the episodes in the text.

  

Aravinda Rao
