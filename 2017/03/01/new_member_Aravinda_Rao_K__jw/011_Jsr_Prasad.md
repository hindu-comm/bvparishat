Thanks Dr. Giridhar garu, for adding this suggestion which I wanted to do! It works most of the times. Many GRETIL Roman diacritic texts have been converted to UNICODE by Dr. Dhaval at his site - <http://www.sanskritworld.in/> There are many online converters are available to convert data to Devanagari. It is easy to search within the text, once the text is available in UNICODE.  
  

Once again, hearty welcome to respected Dr. Aravinda Rao garu!  

  

Regards,  

Prasad
