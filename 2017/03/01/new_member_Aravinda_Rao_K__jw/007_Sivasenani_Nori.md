Welcome to Sri Dr. K. Aravinda Rao garu (the doctorate is in Sanskrit), who served united AP as the Director General of Police. He has contributed a lot to Sanskrit studies in Hyderabad (CDs of Kaumudi, Mahakavyas etc.) and Vedanta studies on the internet (Advaita Academy) apart from encouragement to, and participation in, the activities of organizations such as Sura Bharati Samiti. सहस्रेण किम्? He is one of the most competent and committed well wishers of Sanskrit.

  

Sir, the question raised by you was discussed only last month in this thread:<https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!msg/samskrita/oTnXu4tATLM/2q_PQR1_EQAJ>

  

Volumes of the index, at any rate a few of them, seem to be available online.

  

Regards

Senani
