Dr. Aravinda Rao, IPS, had a very significant role to play in Swadeshi Indology Conference-2. He was present from the day first to the day last at the various sessions. He is one of the few alert and vigilant Indian scholars acutely aware of the kind and degree of damage and disfigurement being wrought on our heritage by some of the Western Indologists.

  

Highly knowledgeable yet utterly simple a person that he is, his presence and participation would surely lend additional lustre to BVParishat and go to enhance its credibility.

  

Hearty welcome to the heedful scholar.
