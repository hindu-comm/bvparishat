I heartily welcome Shri Aravinda Rao. This is something special day for bvp. Hope your presence will help us to assert ourselves and regroup to fight for the preservation of most important thing in the world I.e. the ancient wisdom.

Most helpful is Wikisource Samskrit to search in devanagari Unicode most of Vedic texts are available there.
