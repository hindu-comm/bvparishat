Dear list

  

I was searching forआथर्वणोपनिषदः edited by Jibananda Vidyasagara. I found the book here.

  

<http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/jspui/handle/10689/21995>  

  

Like all books onWest Bengal Public Library Network site, the book is available as multiple PDFs. It is cumbersome to download seven PDFs and then combine them together every time for each book one wants from wbpublibnet.  

  

Is anybody aware of any tool to download books from the website? Like the DLI Downloaded by Munish Chandel (which is now not very useful as DLI offers links for complete PDFs now)?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
