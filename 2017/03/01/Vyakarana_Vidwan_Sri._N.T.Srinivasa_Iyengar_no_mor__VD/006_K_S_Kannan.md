As far as I remember, original verses only.

  

The books were printed at Rama Press that was housed in his own compound. I do not have details at present, and am not sure I can easily get them either.

  

He was possibly the editor /author/co-author of *Vyākaraṇa Praveśa,* a book on grammar (abridgement (?)of *Siddhānta Kaumudī *with perhaps a new *vṛtti*) prescribed (perhaps even now, and for over 20 years) for traditional Sanskrit examinations in Karnataka. (Prof Varakhedi or Prof Veeranarayana Pandurangi can provide some authentic/fuller details).

  

It was his father who taught *Mahābhāṣya* to *Mahāmahopādhyāya* NRanganatha Sharma also.
