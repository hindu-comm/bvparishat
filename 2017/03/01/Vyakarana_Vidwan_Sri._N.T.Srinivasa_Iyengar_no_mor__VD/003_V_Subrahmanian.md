Individually he has authored many books like Sandhyavandanam, Deshika Stotram in Kannada with pada-vibhajane published by Ubhaya Vedanta Sabha- Malleswaram, Bengaluru.

  

He had co- authored VALMIKI Ramayanam in Kannada. He has been awarded some titles such as 'Abhinava Vālmīki', 'Kesari', 'Vedāntabhūṣaṇa' in Viṣiśṭādvaita, Karnataka Govt's Rajyotsava Award, etc.

  

He was a scholar in Alankāra too.

  

His grandson told me that the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in Bangalore may have some information of any other books authored by him and also audio recordings of his Valmiki Ramayana discourses.
