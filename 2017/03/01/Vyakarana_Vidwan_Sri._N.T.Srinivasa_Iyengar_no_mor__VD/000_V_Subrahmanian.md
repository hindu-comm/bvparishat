Sri. N.T.Srinivasa Iyengar who served as Professor and later the Principal of Sri Jayachamarajendra Samskrita College, Bengaluru, passed away at his residence at the age of 96 years.  

  

An accomplished scholar in Vyakarana, Sri NTS Iyengar had participated in a number of vidwad goṣṭhī-s in various forums and received the presents of honor from several Acharyas, Pīṭhādhipati-s, etc. of many Maṭha-s and other institutions.

  

He had discoursed on a long term basis on several works such as the Viṣṇu sahasra nāma and the Mahābhārata in the Sringeri Shankara Maṭha and elsewhere.

  

We find a note of appreciative remembrance in the website of the KSU:
