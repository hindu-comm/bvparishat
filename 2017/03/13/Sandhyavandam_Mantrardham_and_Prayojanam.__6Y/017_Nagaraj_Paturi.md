\>What is the significance of performing 24+8 Gayatri Mudras. What Bhav should be in our mind while performing.

  

------ This is a very good question, worth researching.

  

The number of mudras being 24 and the number of syllable also being 24 must have some basis.

  

The number 8 too is interesting because 24 is its multiple.

  

I saw a video in which an American teacher is seen performing 24 mudras for 24 syllables one mudra along with the pronunciation of each syllable.

That appears to make sense.

  

That meanings of names of mudras have nothing to do with the meaning they communicate is obvious.

  

But do all these mudras together 'communicate' a meaning? or each of these is a tool for Yogic effects (in the Saadhaka)?

  

We need to find out. The answer seems to lie hidden somewhere.

  

May Vedamaataa reveal it sooner than later.
