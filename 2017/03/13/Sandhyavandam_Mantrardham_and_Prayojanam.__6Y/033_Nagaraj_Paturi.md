Dear aayushmaan Madhwa Raj,

  

While I, as I already mentioned in my previous mail, appreciative of your keenness to know the spirit of a very important ritual, I would like to clarify to you that BVP is not a religious body authorized to standardize the Sandhyavandanam procedure and prescribe that standard procedure to all.

  

Second point, rituals like Sandhyavandanam can be viewed from both from Vedanta or non-Vedanta perspectives. Each saadhaka may take one of those perspectives. Scholars can, if you are interested, know which perspective gives which meaning etc.
