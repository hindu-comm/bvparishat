My idea in Starting the Thread is to Collect the meanings and Tatva ardha in Sandhyavandnam mantras. We know that no standardized procedure is fixed in sandhyavandanam steps. Steps in Sandhyavandanam must be kept in ordered manner with reasoning. Like Slowly bringing the practitioner's attention from Bhooshuddi to Marjanya mantra. My dear group members please help me.
