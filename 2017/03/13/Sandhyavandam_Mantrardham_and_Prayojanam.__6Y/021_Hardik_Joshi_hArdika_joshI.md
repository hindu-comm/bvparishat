Dear Sriramji,  

  
Many thanks...  
  

Probably, mudras might have included to practice the presence of Deity during Sandhya vandanam in external form. I belong to the lineage of Shukla Yajurveda (Madhyandini Shakha) and the sandhya vandanam seems to be bit different from Krishna Yajurveda form.  
  

I am not a Sanskrit scholar and always depend on texts authored by others like Sw. Dayananda Saraswati or Pt. Ram Sharma Acharya to perform Sandhya vandanam.  
  

It seems that you are a scholar of Sanskrit... I would encourage the members of this group to author texts for layman like us regarding Vedic / Puranic worship procedures... We can publish it online...  
  

Best Regards,
