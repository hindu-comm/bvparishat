Hi Ajith ji,

  

  

I searched and got many PDF and documents which increased my confusion. Learning from others will not be as effective as from reading i think.

Coming to questions yes i have many doubts on performing Sandhyavandnam with the proper Bhav .

I don't want to modify anything.

My effort is in Knowing the Standard Steps of Sandhyavandanam with reason to every step why in the hierarchy its there along with meaning and Bhav.

It is well known fact that nobody even in the same family will follow the same steps.

Also people will do according to their wish , someone ignores Marjana or Digdevatha namaskara etc and complete the ritual.

In my view we must have a standard for sandhyavandanam which is the core of Sanathana Dharma and Studies in Vedanta.

Coming to Saving time of Scholars i think no person in BVP gets disturbed when aअर्भक like me asks a question . They will feel more excited to teach me i think.

  

So please let me know the bhav of each and every step in the following format. for example.

  

|               |      |         |                    | |---------------|------|---------|--------------------| | Step(Mantra ) | Bhav | Meaning | What is being done |

|                     |     |     |                            | |---------------------|-----|-----|----------------------------| |                     |     |     |                            | |                     |     |     |                            | |                     |     |     |                            | |                     |     |     |                            | | "आयातु वरदा.....", |     |     | the AvAhana is established | |                     |     |     |                            |

|                    |     |     |                          | |--------------------|-----|-----|--------------------------| | "उत्तमे शिखरे...." |     |     | upasthAna is established | |                    |     |     |                          | |                    |     |     |                          |
