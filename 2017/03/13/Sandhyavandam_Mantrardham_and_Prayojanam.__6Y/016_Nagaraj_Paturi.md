Dear Sri Vishvasji,

  

A huge amount of our current practices have such admixtures. They have Vedic origins. But employ a big number of Puranic/Agamic elements. There is no question of auchitya or anauchitya in this. That is the beauty of what is being called as 'Hindu' tradition.

  

Arya Samaj which wanted to revert back to the 'original', 'pure' Vedic tradition, 'cleaned' these rituals by removing the Puranic / Agamic elements from them. There is an Arya Samaj version of Sandhya Vandanam also. You may see[here](http://www.vjsingh.info/sandhya.html). They use only Veda mantras.

  

One may want to go for such reformations from time to time.

  

But the 'mainstream' 'Hinduism' remains Purana/ Agama amalgamated.

  

The dhyaana s'lokas such as Muktavidruma or Dhyeyassadaa also are not from the Veda.

  

As long as these elements do not disturb the spirit of the ritual, I don't see any anauchitya in this.
