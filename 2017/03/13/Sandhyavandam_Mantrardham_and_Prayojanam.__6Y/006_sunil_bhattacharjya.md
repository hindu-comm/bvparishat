Namaste,  
  

As regards Gayatrijapam, to my knowledge, if avahana is done everytime, the visarjana also has to be done everytime, otherwise avahana may not be needed every time. Further, for many, the Gayatri is an ajapa mantra, in the sense that Gayatri is recited at any time of the day beyond the scheduled trisandhya japas.  
  

Secondly, some people recite the Gayatri-Shapa Vimochana mantra. before or after the gayatri japam. To my understanding, it is to remind the reciters that Gayatri is for spiritual upliftment and one should not try to use its powers for breaking the laws of nature or for using that to harm others.
