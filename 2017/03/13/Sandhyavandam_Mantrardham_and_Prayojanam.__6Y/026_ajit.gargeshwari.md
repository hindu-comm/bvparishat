I perform Sandhya Vandana observing as thought by my father and my father performs seeing how my grandfather performed. That is the best and an ideal way to learn rituals. If that is not possibleone should learn and see how ones Guru or other members in one family performs and learn. If that is followed there will be no confusion or doubts. Questions arises if only one wants to modify.  
  
Editions of Rigvediya Sandhyavandana are available at archives and DLi websites.  
  
As suggested on BVP home page it would be a good idea to search the web before asking for books as that will save time for all
