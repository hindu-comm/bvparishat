Dear list members

  

Is the complete digital text of Natya-shastra available anywhere?

  

The version on GRETIL has four chapters missing (17, 31, 32, 34): <http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/1_natya/bharnatu.htm>

  

The source for GRETIL is the text on SanskritDocuments, which also has these four chapters missing: <http://sanskritdocuments.org/sanskrit/by-category/natyashastra.php>  

  

Thanks in advance, Nityananda
