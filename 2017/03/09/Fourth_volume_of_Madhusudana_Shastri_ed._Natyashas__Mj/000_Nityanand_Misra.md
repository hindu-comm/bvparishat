I found the first three volumes on scribd:

  

Volume I (chapters 1 to 7)

<https://www.scribd.com/doc/233612081/Natya-Shastra-of-Bharata-Muni-With-Abhinava-Bharati-I-Madhsusudan-Shastri>

  

Volume II (chapters 8 to 18)

<https://www.scribd.com/document/210736531/Natya-Shastra-of-Bharata-Muni-With-Abhinava-Bharati-II-Madhsusudan-Shastri>

  

Volume III (chapters 19 to 28)

<https://www.scribd.com/document/185980050/Natya-Shastra-of-Bharat-Muni-and-Abhinava-Bharati-Vol-III-Acharya-Shri-Madhusudan-Shastri>

  

Was a fourth volume published? Is it available anywhere?
