\<\<Prior to the opposition to the SK from the Arya Samajists, the opposition to Bhaṭṭoji's work came from authors like Jagannātha in his Manoramā-Kucamardinī, but that was not because the SK was a Prakriyā work.>\>

  

Sir, I also think that that was not because the SK was a Prakriyā work. Even Swami Dayananda Saraswati wrote the Prakriyā work called[वेदाङ्गप्रकाश](https://archive.org/search.php?query=Vedang%20Prakash)in many volumes.

But I did not get any chance to see any of these, except the[सौवर](https://archive.org/details/Sauvar), probably later edited by Pt Yudhisthir Mimansak.
