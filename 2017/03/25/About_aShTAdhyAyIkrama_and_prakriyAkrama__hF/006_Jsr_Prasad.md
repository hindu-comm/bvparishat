Respected Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya Ji,  
  

Thanks for this valuable comment. But, one suggestion. The diacritical marks, that you use, are not rendered properly. None of the members can read those accents. Kindly make efforts to increase the readability of your posts, as already been suggested by other members before.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
