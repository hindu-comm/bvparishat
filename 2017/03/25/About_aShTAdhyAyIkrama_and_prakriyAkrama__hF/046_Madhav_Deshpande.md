There are some indications of the interdependence of rules built into the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The rules are not stand alone statements, but are to be understood in relation to other rules. This includes relations between rules like utsarga-apavāda, paratva, nityatva, antaraṅga-bahiraṅgatva, siddhatva-asiddhatva etc. Some of this has been brought out by Patañjali in his statement:*kāryakālam sañjñāparibhāṣam yatra kāryam tatra draṣṭavyam* (Mahābhāṣya on P.1.3.12). A fuller debate about opposite positions can be found in the conflicting Paribhāṣās: *yathoddeśaṃ saṃjñāparibhāṣam* versus *kāryakālaṃ saṃjñāparibhāṣam*.
One can look these up in the Paribhāṣenduśekhara of Nāgeśabhaṭṭa and the extensive discussion of these alternatives. Rules of Pāṇini like *vipratiṣedhe paraṃ kāryam* are clear indications that Pāṇini assumed applications of his rules where two or more would come into conflict, and he made explicit provision to resolve some of these conflicts.
Other conflicts were resolved by later grammarians with paribhāṣās like: *para-nitya-antaraṅga-apavādānām uttarottaram balīyaḥ*. A purely linear reading of the rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī will give only a preliminary understanding of the rules, but not the interactional relations of rules to other rules, as presumed by Pāṇini.With best regards,
