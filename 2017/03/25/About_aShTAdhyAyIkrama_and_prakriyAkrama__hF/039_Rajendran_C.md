This discussion seems to be extremely interesting. In the present state of affairs, we cannot envisage Panini sutras without the prakriyakrama of Siddhanthakaumudi and other works.Perhaps Prof.Böhtlingk was bowled over by the mind boggling teleological order of the sutras culminating in the marvel of the Sapadasapthadhyayi/tripadi hierarchy.

I request Prof.Bhate and Prof.Deshpande to shed some light on the nature of Paninian pedagogy before the advent of Prakriya works.Is it true that Bhattikavya was taught along with Ashtadhyayi and kasika?How did Mahabhashya fit in?
