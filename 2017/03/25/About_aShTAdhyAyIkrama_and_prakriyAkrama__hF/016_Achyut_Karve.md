When something is codified in written form we first need to dissect the whole into parts before we render it. Then firstly the rendering has to be such that the successive needs to be built on the one that preceeds.
Secondly one needs to start from a point that is pivotal to the whole subject matter. I think that Panini has rendered the subject correctly.  
Further the siddhant kaumudi does not point to any shortcomings which the Ashtadhyayi suffers from. As such following the Ashtadhyayi should be preferred.
