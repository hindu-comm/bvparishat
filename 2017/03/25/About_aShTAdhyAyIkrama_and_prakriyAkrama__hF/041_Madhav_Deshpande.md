Though the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali comments on the Sūtras in the order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Patañjali's extensive discussions on the Sūtras presuppose the use of the Sūtras in derivation of forms. However, to my memory, the term prakriyā does not occur in the MB. I did not find it in the Word Index to the MB either. We do not have any surviving commentaries prior to the Kāśikāvr̥tti, but the Prakriyā model is found in Dharmakīrti's Rūpāvatāra and Rāmacandra's Prakriyākaumudī before Bhaṭṭoji. This model also spreads to other systems of Sanskrit grammar, and there are Prakriyā works in Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana, Kātantra, and Sārasvata systems. So, clearly this model was popular across the board, and Bhaṭṭoji's SK was not a lone effort. Prior to the opposition to the SK from the Arya Samajists, the opposition to Bhaṭṭoji's work came from authors like Jagannātha in his Manoramā-Kucamardinī, but that was not because the SK was a Prakriyā work. It would be useful if we have some historical data of Vyākaraṇa curriculum in various Pāṭhaśālās in different parts of the country. Certainly, the Marathi Pandits in the lineage of Nāgeśabhaṭṭa up to Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar and Kashinath Shastri Abhyankar focused more on the SK and its commentaries like the Prauḍhamanoramā and Śabdaratna, and the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, but not on the Kāśikāvr̥tti. They were clearly aware of the Kāśikāvr̥tti, Nyāsa and Padamañjarī, as these works are cited mostly for refutation, but the tradition of the Kāśikāvr̥tti as such was not followed through. This may be some historical evidence of the popularity of the Prakriyā model during these centuries. While there was a significant number of commentaries and subcommentaries in the SK tradition, the Kāśikā tradition seems to have dried up after the Nyāsa and Padamañjarī. This may indicate rise and fall of certain models of grammatical works.
