Namaste Kartik , SB



1.  You have invoked the Otto von Böhtlingk expresses his views on Aṣṭādhyāyī and its **Prakriya recasts like the Kaumudi** in the "*Einleitung*" (i.e. Introduction), p.xvi, 3rd para, of his German translation of the Aṣṭādhyāyī titled "***Panini's Grammatik***". What one seems to miss is the DEEP DAMAGE caused by such perspectives,
lurking around for over 150 plus years and advocating negative views on traditional texts leading to Battle: Sanskrit ! I hope that such Oriental Scholars quotes invoked on ‘ declaring appreciatively at opening and damning in the conclusion the works of tradition’, following ‘ Alamkrutya Shiraschedah = Crowning the Head before chopping it’ model, would be studied with great caution and concern.





2. I am highlighting the same quote given by you by re-positioning the quote in two parts ( Yoga- Vibhaaga) and point to what Otto von Böhtlingk seems to miss ; and following his views, the later Sanskrit scholars seem to miscarry the perception on traditional texts, teachings and thoughts ! 



***2a) The appreciation part is ‘ soothing anesthesia ointment applied on the deep cut made’***. "The arrangement of the sutras in the Ashtadhyayi appears **to be strangely scattered here and there**, but actually it is well thought-out and realized in a marvelous way. The purpose is to achieve the most possible brevity and avoid all repetitions, and this is achieved without any doubt. The more attentively one studies Panini's Grammar the more one is amazed by it's very keen insight and one can happily master this enormous subject matter. **The Grammar itself is a masterpiece of a superior quality**. 



***2b) The damning part, arising from the RED-BOLD wordings above is*** : The **later grammars destroyed the unbreakable sequence of Panini's sutras**, with the goal of putting together everything that is closely associated, in one place. **These grammars are fully unintelligible **without extensive commentaries, which must refer to the far foregoing sutras or following sutras, to make any sense at all, **so they (the later grammars) must be considered as mistakes." **





**3*. Both put together, the net communication (Taatparya) is telling one single message***: ‘ We, the ‘LATEST LANGUAGE EXPERTS OF ORIENT, WILL TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR LANGUAGE’, We will Teach you, the NATIVES/ Desi’s, how to study and Apply Paninian rules to understand the Pre-Paninian works of Ancient Indian Civilization, the works being Vedas, Upanishads, Dharma Shaastras, Gita, …..Because ( the later grammars must be considered as mistakes’. ( And, as a consequent step,
we will also teach you the standards of Translation and Practice of your texts). This is a self-declared, self-assumed authority , which almost every orientalists and indologist seem to ‘ buy and stay comfortably in academics’. 



**4. What Otto von Böhtlingk is pointing to Indian Sanskrit Grammarians is :** Ye, Indian Sanskritists using ‘ later grammars to study Panini’, Panini might have been great ( and this ‘ greatness –appreciation’ is associated with our current unintelligibility of the text’ , using Greek, Latin, German standards of Language’). you, the Indian Inheritors of the Panini’s work, using ‘ Later grammars’ are simply stupid ! because, these later grammar works made pedagogic and construction errors in presenting ‘ Panini’ and Passing it on to Next-Generation. In short, YOUR DESI METHOD OF STUDYING PANINI is FILLED WITH DEFECTS COMING TO YOU AS INHERITANCE FROM YOUR GRAND GENERATIONS!
Any scholar who has studied and stakes a claim to have mastered Paninian tradition and Language rules is fundamentally, carrying a foundationally inherited pedagogic error ! Because the root-error is in the very pedagogy and tools used in tradition to study Panini.



 Therefore the Master of Oriental Languages, Otto von Böhtlingk, undertakes to audit , review and present the ‘Soul of Panini’ which will help the ‘ Indians, misguided in understanding the Sanskrit Language works like Vedas, Gita, Ramayana , -- what all are Pre-Paninian ( 700 BCE circa) to study their texts and Languages properly. **Appreciating Long dead men (Panini ) or blaming ghosts of Panini ( like Bhattoji) does not harm anyone !** But destroying the living scholars –tradition and corrupting the future scholarship is worth the ‘ Motive guided effort’.



5. What then is the Traditional Stand on Ashtadhyayai and Kaunmudi :



**Traditional Thinking and Teaching on relation of Ashtadhyayi and its ‘ Teachers – Texts’ ( like Patanjali’s Mahabhashya, Kashikaa, Kaumudi) : All the Vyakarana-Kaara’s of Samskrutham facilitated the study of Ashtadhyayi, for a ‘ Purpose and Teaching – Training a Specific Audience’. The specific book writing and use is a ‘ Author-Teachers Preference’. These Vyakarana-Shaastra kaaras did not reinvent or ‘vision’ new things. They facilitated learning and Thought –Advancement
from their chosen perspective.**

****

**Patanjali picks combining Sutra- Vartika to bring out Bhaashya. Kashikaa kaara simplifies the flow by Sutras. Bhttoji focuses on Prakriyaa. Where is the error introduction ? **

****

**Within Tradition, there was no confusion in teaching the pedagogy of Samskrutham. Mata-bheda is not error. **

****

**The systems and tools to train a poet of literature ( Kavi- Kavya / Rupaka Natya –Rasa domains) and training a ‘Shaastrakaara’ to do the ‘Vedartha –Vedanta Darshana Shaastra – Vidyaa Sthana Vichara’. Acharya Shankara, and all other Acharyas ( SriRamanuja ,Madhva, Venkatadhvarin…Appayya Dekshita..) never made a confusion or said any ‘ Later Vyakarana Kaara’ to be at ‘error and deviation from Panini’. Even Patanjali, at some points, thinks that a sutra may be redundant; but says , We do not understand the ‘ Acharya – Pravrutti in making this sutra’; but we are providing a Vartika – to document the current usage. The Vartika is for usage rectification and validation; It is NOT Amendment to Original. **





**6*. The key point that seems to have been missed by Otto von Böhtlingk*** : Samskrutham has been studied by Bharateeyas as a Shastra of ‘Veda-Bhashaa / Deva Bhashaa/ Mantra Bhashaa/ Yoga-Bhashaa’ ; is always to be studied as a ‘ VEDANGA’ and NOT as a ‘Social Language of a Historic Society and a Ritual language of Community’.



The Language Application does NOT dictate the pedagogy of Language. Any deviation from this standard makes Samskrutham to be a ‘ PRAKRUTHAM – Apabhramsha – Mlecchita – Desi / Jati Bhashaa/ Jatyantarii Bhashaa’.
This is what Bharata documented in Natya Shaastra way back in pre-Christian era; and Mahabharata refers to such language classification as ‘ Mleccha Bhashaa’. Ramayana speaks of such modeling as ‘ Daivee –Maansuhee Bhashaa’. Vedic term for this would be the ‘
Tureeya Vak - Pashu-Bhashaa’.

Dear Sanhitaji,



I do not intend to add fuel to fire, ruffle feathers or promulgate a partisan view as to which method is more commendable, however you may find Otto von Böhtlingk's comments in his Introduction to his translation of Aṣṭādhyāyī interesting. I cannot say for sure what degree of Sanskrit scholarship Otto von Böhtlingk himself held or what authority he enjoys in the modern academic world today (perhaps Dr Madhav Deshpande can comment better) but I personally find his comments quite insightful and interesting, however I am keenly conscious that some of my friends may find them too strong or far-stretched, nonetheless I reproduce them verbatim here.



We know that Otto von Böhtlingk (May 30, 1815 – April 1, 1904) was a German Indologist and his first great work was an edition of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, with a German commentary, under the title Acht Bücher grammatischer Regeln (Bonn, 1839–1840).



Otto von Böhtlingk expresses his views on Aṣṭādhyāyī and its Prakriya recasts like the Kaumudi in the "*Einleitung*" (i.e. Introduction), p.xvi, 3rd para, of his German translation of the Aṣṭādhyāyī titled "***Panini's Grammatik***" in these words:



**Original German:**

*Die Anordnung der Sutra kann uns Her und da befremden, ist aber streng durchdacht und in bewunderungswurdiger Weise durchgeführt. Erstrebt wird die möglichste Kürze und Vermei-dung aller Wiederholungen, und dieses wird ohne alien Zweifel erreicht. Je aufmerksamer man Panini's Grammatik studirt, um so mehr wird man über den Scharfsinn und die glückliche Be-wältigung des ungeheuren Stoffes erstaunen. Sie ist in ihrer Art ein Meisterstück ersten Ranges.Spätere Grammatiken, die Panini's Sutra aus der unverrückbaren Ordnung gebracht haben, um alles dem Stoffe nach Zusammengehörige aneinander zu reihen, sind ohne ausführliche Commentare, die stets auf etwas weit Vorangegangenes oder Folgendes Rücksicht nehmen müssen, ganz unverständlich und als Missgriffe zu betrachten.*



**English Translation:**

"The arrangement of the sutras in the Ashtadhyayi appears to be strangely scattered here and there, but actually it is well thought-out and realized in a marvelous way. The purpose is to achieve the most possible brevity and avoid all repetitions, and this is achieved without any doubt. The more attentively one studies Panini's Grammar the more one is amazed by it's very keen insight and one can happily master this enormous subject matter. The Grammar itself is a masterpiece of a superior quality. The later grammars destroyed the unbreakable sequence of Panini's sutras, with the goal of putting together everything that is closely associated, in one place. These grammars are fully unintelligible without extensive commentaries, which must refer to the far foregoing sutras or following sutras, to make any sense at all, so they (the later grammars) must be considered as mistakes."



Hope this helps.

Kartik

Thanks for this pointer Krishnaprasad ji! Half of that discussion went over Mallinatha vs Bhattoji. Hope, more replies may pour in now.
