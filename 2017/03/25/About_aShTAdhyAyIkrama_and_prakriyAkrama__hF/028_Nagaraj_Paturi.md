Another point.

  

Both Kaumudi method and direct Ashtadhyayee method belong to Prakriyaa bhaaga only. The other side of VyaakaraNa paramparaa is aarthika bhaaga.

  

Both Kaumudi method and direct Ashtadhyayee method are two different approaches in prakriyaa only.

  

As such , to call Kaumudi method as prakriyaa and the direct Ashtadhyayee method as 'not prakriyaa' is a misnomer.
