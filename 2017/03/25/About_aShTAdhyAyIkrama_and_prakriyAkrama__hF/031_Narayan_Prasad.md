\<\<To understand the meaning of a given rule of Pāṇini, the Aṣṭādhyāyī Krama is absolutely essential. There is no question about it.>\>

  

I fully agree with you, sir. Many beginners of Panini directly start the Kaumudi way and are unable to understand anything.

  

\<\<But the meaning of a rule is different from application of a rule in the derivation of a particular form. For the derivation of a given form, Sūtras from across the Aṣṭādhyāyī need to apply, their mutual conflicts resolved using guidance from metarules like*vipratiṣedhe paraṃ kāryam*, or*apavāda-utsarga*relationships, and the Prakriyā-works have demonstrated the application of Pāṇini's rules in a much more realistic manner>\>

  

As Prakriyā-work I mainly used the modern work व्याकरण चन्द्रोदय (5 vols., esp. Vol.3 & 4) of पं॰ चारुदेव शास्त्री. Kaumudi works I did not find useful for me. After having studied the complete Aṣṭādhyāyī, I used these only in rare cases.

  

\<\<the Prakriyā-works have demonstrated the application of Pāṇini's rules in a much more realistic manner than the linear commentaries like the Kāśikāvr̥tti. \>\>

  

In my opinion, the Kāśikāvr̥tti is meant for understanding the meaning of the sutras and not meant for Prakriyā at all.

  

\<\<In myopinion, the linear commentaries and the Prakriyā works are complimentary to each other.>\>

  

Agreed. Even Swami Dayanand Saraswati felt the need of Prakriyā work. But this comes after having studied first the complete Aṣṭādhyāyī. And this also is practical after having studied first some basic texts without bothering much about grammar. This has been my experience (I have studied the Aṣṭādhyāyī only though self-study).

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
