\<\< In the present state of affairs, we cannot envisage Panini sutras without the prakriyakrama of Siddhanthakaumudi and other works.>\>

  

Sir,

 It appears that you have not yet seen the Skt/Hindi commentary of theअष्टाध्यायी by Pt.ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासु. For your kind information, I could very well understand the Panini sutras without the help of any Kaumudi works. In thisअष्टाध्यायी (भाष्य) प्रथमावृत्ति, theप्रक्रिया of examples cited go side by side given in the appendix. After having studied Panini, I also did research work in theसरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव. This latter work is supposed to be a great revised edition of Panini. All this I did only as a self-study.

  

\<\<Perhaps Prof.Böhtlingk was bowled over by the mind boggling teleological order of the sutras culminating in the marvel of the
Sapadasapthadhyayi/tripadi hierarchy.\>\>

  

With due respect to you, I would say that such comment is unwarranted.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
