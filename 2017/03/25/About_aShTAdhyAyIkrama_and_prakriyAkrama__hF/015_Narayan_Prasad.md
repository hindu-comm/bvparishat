\<\<Each method has an audience and benefit; but it does not make any one system to be any superior or inferior to others. \>\>

  

Respected Sir,

  

   I maintain my first claim, i.e. "\< Unless one has studied the Asht., it is useless to refer to any Kaumudii works \>".

  

   Before I comment anything further, I must give my background and highly limited knowledge of Sanskrit, esp. literature.

  

   I had formal education in Sanskrit only up to High School. My professional qualification is in Engineering and I have already retired after working in the same field.

  

   With the above points taken duly into consideration, whatever I would like to say is already available at the following link:

  

    Books recommended for adult beginners of Panini

  

  Best regards  

  Narayan Prasad
