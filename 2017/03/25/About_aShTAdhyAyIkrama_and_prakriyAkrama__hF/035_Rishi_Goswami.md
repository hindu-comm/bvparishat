About both the Prakriyas, I'd say Siddhanta Kaumudi and Mahabhashya both are equally important, for both have their advantages and disadvantages.

The Pracheena method has less Padakritya, I not being a student of Pracheena Vyakarana, am quoting a friend's perspective. He says people who have only studied Asht, lack knowledge of Padakritya, which means say in Sthanivad Sutra, we break each word and ask what if we hadn't said this, then what would habe happened. Why did we choose Analvidhau?  
Or in Liti dhatoranbhyasasya here in vritti why "liN-nimmitAdeshAdikam"? Such chintanam is unique to Navyavyakarana.

And he says most Navya-Vyakarana students lack knowledge of adhikAra and Sutrakrama. Even if it is mentioned clearly, most will forget. Except a few like Angasya, Dhatoh, i don't remember all adhikAras, and also hardly numbers of Sutras.

But i personally feel Kaumudi has an upperhand, for Phitsutra, UNAdi, Linganishasanam aren't in the Ashtadhyayikrama, so that would be essential as well.

Nevertheless, without Mahabhashya also we can sail through literature, Nyaya, Vedanta and other texts easily, for we know the Sutras anyways. Mahabhashya i feel is for curiosity, andnfor authority in Vyakarana. Of course we can't have authority in grammar without studying Paribhashas of Nagesha, Mahabhshya, Praudhamanorama and Vakyapadeeyam. All of these 4 books are equally important for qualifying as an authority in grammar. This is my view.

My friend, he came from Varanasi and informed that under supervision of Shree Ramabhadracharyaji, some book is been made where both methods of learning can be combined. I don't know the authenticity of his claim, he maybe faking it or he maybe serious as well. I'm unaware, maybe someone here knows about it.

Regards  
Rishi.
