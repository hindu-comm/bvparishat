Before writing in detail I will tell these points.

If one is going to self study all the old traditional (i.e which are either prakriya or prakarana ) books are not useful.

  

Books written by modern scholars are much better. Much Clarity

Much lucid. They are crystal clear. All old books are meant to be taught. And could not be taken up directly. With special reference to Siddhaanta Kaumudi.

He often writes Spashtam for vrtti. God knows how can he write like that. But Kashikaa gives the lucid explanation. But before going to any old books it is better to read the modern.

After studying these one can take up Padamanjari which is prakarana method. But Nyasa is more lucid in its language. but is attacked by Padamanjari. Padamanjari is the final and ultimate in deciding the meaning of the sutras because even P Manorama directly takes from PM. Even though Bhattoji or Nagesha Bhatta differ here and there by quoting kaiyyata but still PM is the legendary because it has MBhashya samvaadaa rathar than Kaiyaata( if some times PM could not get samvaadaa of MB still PM is better cos small minor mistakes of human cannot be removed)

  

And if one is a Vedanta or Nyaya student Padamanjari is the book mostly required. All the avaantara discussion taken in Vedanta books from P M. Even direct sentences were copied.

  

If One needs practical application of sutras

  

Then read Mallinatha completely

Durghata Vrtti

Shabdaapashabda viveka

Sahitya Kanthakoddhara

Vaagvyavahaaradarsha (sanskrit and Not Hindi)

Vamana kavyalankara sutra vrtti 5th dosha prakarana

Kavyaprakasha dosha prakarana 7th chapter or all alankara grantha on dosha prakarana like shrngaara prakaasha saraswati kanthabharana
