As Madhav has rightly pointed out, prakriya works are, indeed essential for understanding the application of Panini.I think even Boehtingk must be aware of the importance of the prakriya works and he would not, I am sure, have correctly understood Panini without the help of these later worksThe Geman word he used for "mistake"should be properly understood, I think.
