There was a discussion on this on Samskrita list too.

  

Let me just remind to the learned members the following:

  

The word 'prakriyaa paramparaa' has been used in contrast to 'aarthika paramparaa'. Books dealing with word-derivation from the sutras of AA have been categorized as prakriyaa granthas and books dealing with the philosophy /theory behind AA have been categorized as 'aarthika granthas'.

  

Thus both the methods that use AA directly for siddhi or the Kaunudi versions (laghu, madhya or brihat) that categorize the sutras into theme-wise chapters fall under prakriyaa category only.

  

Labeling Kaumudi method alone as prakriyaa paddhati occurred probably because traditionally (before the direct Aa methods from Arya Samajis, and AAchaaryaa Pushpaji were founded), that was the only method in vogue for prakriyaa.

  

As Prof. Prasad pointed out, Sanskrit language teaching is a broader issue than Kaumudi Vs direct AA. Kaumudi Vs direct AA is both a language teaching method and siddhi method issue. Sanskrit language teaching methods, even the traditional ones are bigger in number than just Kaumudi method or direct AA method.

  

The method mentioned by Prof. Prasad was called Chintana or aakaankshaa paddhati in which declension and conjugation tables were used.
