Namaste



Sharing a piece of information i have on this topic- अष्टाध्यायीक्रम and प्रक्रियाक्रम:. The two teaching pedagogies have specific objectives and benefits. The rise and fall of two models of teaching is a reflection of social dynamics of ' Purohita- profession' and ' Rajaashraya ( kings Patronage) and gurus preferences to transmit their scholarship.



अष्टाध्यायीक्रम : - is mainly needed and used to output students
with a FOCUS on VEDANGA VYAKARANA SHIKSHANA: For Language - SCHOLARSHIP. ( The engineer and architect of the Language-Structures).

 **Basis for this inference**: Mahabhashya : kimartham adhyeyam vyakaranam ? related discussions. Training Vyakaranacharya to follow VEDANGATAA is the KEY. These are DISCIPLINE INTEGRITY GUARDIANS.



प्रक्रियाक्रम: - mainly needed and used to TRAIN PROFESSIONAL who APPLY VEDAS in VAIDIKA YAJANAS / VIDHIS as YAJNIKAS : For Language - UTILTIY and APPLICATION SKILLS. ( The Mason and Workforce who translate the design to a reality called living building).

 **Basis for this inference**: Mahabhashya and Sayana Maadhava Rigbhashya bhoomikaa : katham mantanaam viniyogah ? tadarthe katham vyakarana- shikshaa bhavet ? Training Yajnika- Purohitas to use grammatically correct ' tadartha-vaachaka -shabda with right swaras'. to get the benefit of VEDA-Karma. These are UTILITY -BENEFIT GUARANTEE GUARDIANS.





There is a third dimension of this, which is called the 'VAK-YOGA- PRAKRIYAA', popular name being ' MANTRA SHAASTRA PRAKRIYAA- Krama. This is a SECRET,HIDDEN TRADITON, flashes shown in Bhartruhari's work, pointing in the direction of ' SPHOTA/ Shabda-Brahma/ Shabda Shakti prakashana / Pada- Artha Shakti'. Here, the SIX VEDANGAS ( mainly Jyotisha and Kalpa) are integrally considered to provide customized guidance for MANTRA-SAADHANA as advanced MYSTIC /SIDDHI usage of language. The Key is how to activate and flow ' PRANA' using the ' Seed sounds = akshara -beejas / beeja- aksharas'.



 **Basis for this inference: **'Mantra' is another name for 'Veda'. 'Mantra' is the energizing sounds for Astra-Weapons and Medicine ( *mantaushadha*). Mantra is what transforms the inert (jada) to ' living Conscious entity' (= Praana- Pratishtaa). Mantra mode of language usage requires a pre-qualification of ' Ashtanga Yoga: Samaadhi and then the techniques to deploy it as VINIYOGA. (Patanjali yoga sutras - third Chapter). These are GUARDIANS OF YOGA- SECRETS AND MYSTICISM POWER OF LANGUAGE.





**End note**: This holistic traditional modeling and approach to study 'Panini-Vyakarana' as ' Vedanga Vyakarana' for learning-using 'Veda-Bhasahaa: (Mantra-) Yoga-Samskrutham' is totally out of domain and synch with the classical /social / conversational language model for Sanskrit.



 This is a tradition that is standing out in Bharteeya Bhashaa Shaastra as ' Brahmi linguistics (= Akshara-Brahma-Bhashaa/ Brahma-akshara Bhashaa) , right from Srimad Bhagavad- Gita ( 17-15: Vangmayam Tapah) and is used in all rituals and spiritual traditions over centuries.



 Buddhists and Jains are not against this ' Yoga -utility benefits of Samskrutham, as Mantra- Yoga Bhashaa' , though they may not be open enough to concur on the ' Philosophy of Vedanta ( positioning themselves as Naastika darshanas). The differences in philosophy construction does not change the practical aspect of 'Vak-Yoga'.



 Abrahamic/ Jewish traditions have different names like Shakina for this 'Vak-Yoga' perspective and talk about the sacredness, divinity and power of ' Language alphabets'.
