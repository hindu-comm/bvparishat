To some extent, this thought proves true/correct.

Here, he proposes the study of modern expositions on the Panini's grammar and states the shortcoming of old traditional texts like Kaumudi etc. in very much brief manner.

He is proposing the study of Padamanjari instead of other texts for lucid understanding of Sutrartha. So in this comment, the debate seemed to be viewed in the pedagogical asoect and if a person wants to learn grammar then whjat is the best way to do so is suggested.

When it comes to studying the Paninan grammar, the modern expositions on the same and suggested along with the Padamanjari for lucid understanding of the meaning of sutra. So the suggestion of learning the Padamanjari instead of others must have arose out of the own experience of the writer and his struggle to learn the Paninian grammar.
