With great respect for Otto von Böhtlingk, I completely disagree with his opinion of the Prakriyā type works. To understand the meaning of a given rule of Pāṇini, the Aṣṭādhyāyī Krama is absolutely essential.
There is no question about it. But the meaning of a rule is different from application of a rule in the derivation of a particular form. For the derivation of a given form, Sūtras from across the Aṣṭādhyāyī need to apply, their mutual conflicts resolved using guidance from metarules like *vipratiṣedhe paraṃ kāryam*, or *apavāda-utsarga* relationships, and the Prakriyā-works have demonstrated the application of Pāṇini's rules in a much more realistic manner than the linear commentaries like the Kāśikāvr̥tti. In myopinion, the linear commentaries and the Prakriyā works are complimentary to each other. A great Pāṇinian scholar like Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita composed both types of works, the Śabdakaustubha in the order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī and the Siddhānta-Kaumudī following the previous model of Rāmacandra's Prakriyā-Kaumudī. He was not opposed to one in preference for the other. With best wishes,
