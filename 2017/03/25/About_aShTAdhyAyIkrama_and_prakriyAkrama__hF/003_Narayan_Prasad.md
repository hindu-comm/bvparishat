Please have a look at the Hindi commentary on the Ashtadhyayi by Pt Brahmadatta Jijnaasu (3 vols). Any Kaumudii work is related to the prakriya, i.e. what sutras from Ashtadhyai are required to derive a particular word. Unless one has studied the Asht. , it is useless to refer to any Kaumudii works.
