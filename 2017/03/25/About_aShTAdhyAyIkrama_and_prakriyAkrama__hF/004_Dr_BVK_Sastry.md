Namaste



On the question \< the debate between अष्टाध्यायीक्रम and प्रक्रियाक्रम \> and the response \< Unless one has studied the Asht. , it is useless to refer to any Kaumudii works \> :



The Teachers practice, pedagogy and experience is totally opposite on this claim. Several Teachers ( from South India, and many others, elsewhere also) have taught Kaumudi ( Full Text approach) as a singular reference book , using texts of Kavya ( like Raghuvamsha) have succeeded to help students get a good handle on Samskrutham and Ashtadhyayi. And this has also provided a good foundation for those who desired to explore the ‘Vaidika Vyakarana Prakriyaa’.



Seeing the elephant from sideways and seeing elephant from the front tusk side is an issue of starting point – positioning in the overall goal of making ‘Pradakshinaa’ to the ‘Vyakarana- Ganapati’. One method of starting point can be Kashika, another can be Prakriyaa, another can be Sahitya – Samskara. Each method has an audience and benefit; but it does not make any one system to be any superior or inferior to others.
