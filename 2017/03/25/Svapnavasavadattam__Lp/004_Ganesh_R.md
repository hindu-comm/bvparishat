Thanks a lot for the good words and kind interest showered by Dr. Rajputji, Prof. Deshpandeji and Dr. Sumitraji. Major credits should go to Prof. P. V. Krishna Bhat, Dr. S. R. Leela and Guru Smt. Sundari Santaanam who worked thoroughly for this project. Of course, melodious music of vidvan. Balasubrahmanyasharmaa and naatyadharmi acting of all the artistes should be commended. This was the beginning of an ambitious project which the IGNCA SRC Bangalore took up then. But the adverse times came in the way and the rest could not even be designed.
