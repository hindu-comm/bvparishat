Dear Shri Sridatta,

  

  Thanks for sharing this video link to the performance of Svapnavāsavadattam. I remember taking part in staging the first act of Svapnavāsavadatta in Pune during my high-school days. I had a very minor role in it. This is one of my most favorite Sanskrit dramas, and I have read it with every generation of my Sanskrit students at the University of Michigan.
