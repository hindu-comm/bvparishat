To continue my previous comment on this performance of the Svapnavāsavadattam, it is remarkable that the performance uses Sanskrit as well as Prakrit, something that is rare in modern staging, or even study of the Sanskrit dramas. I remember that the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapith in Pune had staged portions of the Svapnavāsavadattam in Mumbai in early 1960s, and I, as a highschool student, had some minor role in it. Professor Saroja Bhate (then Ms. Saroja Chitari) acted the role of Padmāvatī. But to my memory, we did not use Prakrit originals, but used the Sanskrit chāyās in their place. Later, sometime around 1967, we performed the fourth act of Śākuntalam, but again we did not use Prakrits in the performance. So, the use of Prakrits in performance is a wonderful return to the original composition of Bhāsa. Were other acts of Svapnavāsavadattam performed by this group? Would love to see them.
