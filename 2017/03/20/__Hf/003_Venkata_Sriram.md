Bhaskar ji,

  

You have observed, the shAkta siddhAnta is not taught.Unlike other courses, the shAkta philosophy is very rarely introduced in university curriculum. Unlike pAncharAtra AgamAs that are taught in Tirupathi (RSV), shaiva AgamAs that are taught in Annamalai University, this is rarely taught. There is a Shaiva Agama teaching school in Srisailam which is opposite to Shivaji Sphurti Kendram. Some of the Shaiva Mutts like Dharmapuri Adheenam are teaching Shaiva Agamas, I believe. 

  

I am told that Dr.Mark Dyczkowski who stays in Varanasi conducts classes on Kashmir Shaivism who is a good knowledgeable person and can be contacted via his website "[www.anuttaratrikakaula.org](http://www.anuttaratrikakaula.org)".

  

But I would like to mention one thing and caution that though westerners have taken interest in tantra and shakta philosophy and to some extent excelled in that, but, eventually, most of them have become perverted and ended up teaching eroticism and sexuality. One need to be extremely careful with such "self-styled" teachers who lack sampradAya shuddhi.
This is the reason that most of the females and youth tend to get attracted towards this. I am aware of couple of the shAkta teachers who conduct classes on philosophical part and later train practically in kaula path (using the "M") which is not the right method "कौळप्रतिष्ठां न कुर्यात्"  

  

That is the reason that it is forbidden for all the tom, dick & harry as saidअन्तः शाक्तः । बहिः शैवः । लोके वैष्णवः ।

  

Utmost secrecy is mentioned between the guru and shishya and to get the "right sampradAya" is again the grace of Devi Herself. Till then, you can read the books of Sir John Woodroffe, Douglas Renfew Brooks, Alexis Sanderson etc. for academic purpose. 

  

regs,

sriram
