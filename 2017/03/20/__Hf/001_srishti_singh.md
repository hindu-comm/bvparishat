Hello Bhaskar,

  

There are a few available in JNU library on sakta philosophy, importance of sata by Srividya and Advaita, some testimonies, Sakta intellectuals, Sakta tantra and modern western magic etc. Luckily, all are available in PDF. Please visit.

  

I am sure you will find many more relevant materials on the link below:

  

<http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/results?sid=e8b1db41-67b8-4331-83f7-2c7fea721e5c%40sessionmgr4008&vid=0&hid=4110&bquery=sakta+philosophy&bdata=JmNsaTA9RlQxJmNsdjA9WSZ0eXBlPTAmc2l0ZT1lZHMtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl>

  

I also have one of my friend working of tantra and magic tradition of Assam, will ask her if she can help.

  

Good luck!
