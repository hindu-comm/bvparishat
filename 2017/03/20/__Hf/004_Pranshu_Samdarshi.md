I don't think there exist a separate Shakta philosophy as such. There has been a separate Pratyabhigna schoolwhich arose in Kashmir and provided a firm philosophical basis and interpretation for tantric texts and practices.

  

Also, it is perfectly right not to introduce tantra to mere academics. The tradition has forbidden to do so.  

  

Most of the Shakta tantra texts ends with this or similar statement of lord Shiva, "..

अभक्ते नैव दातव्यं गोपितं रक्ष पार्वती l"

  

("..O Parvati, never reveal it to unfaithfuls and guard it as utmost secret.")

  

In some of the western universities where there has been some serious attempts to introduce tantra in the academic curriculum, it has remained as a nonsensical subject and has been mostly studied as mumbo-jumbo.

  

Regards.
