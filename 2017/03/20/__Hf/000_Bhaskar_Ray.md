Could you share or suggest any research work based on Sakta (शाक्ततन्त्रम्/ शाक्तदर्शनम्/शाक्तागमः) Tantric Tradition or philosophy. Why the Sakta philosophy is not included in the curriculum of universities as a text or a part of study whether Sakta possesses or presents an another philosophical view, doctrine and standpoints.
