Dear Sri Suryaprasad,

  

Let me first bring you to a greater accuracy in your use of words 'iconicity' and 'metaphor theory'.

  

You used the expression 'form-meaningrelationship (Iconicity)' , meaning iconicity means form-meaning relationship (in general)  

  

But in fact, iconicity means form-meaning inseparability as opposed to the arbitrary relationship between form and meaning.

  

Bhartrihari's discussion of meaning is so elaborate and complex that the concept of iconicity is made one of many intricately connected understandings of word-meaning (form-meaning) relationships.

  

On iconicity, he says:

  

सॊ ऽयम् इत्य् अभिसंबन्धाद् रूपम् ऎकीकृतं यता /

शब्दस्यार्थॆन तं शब्दम् अभिजल्पं प्रचक्षतॆ // वाक्य\_२।१२८ //

  

That whole section in which this verse is included contains complex aspects of word-meaning relations.

  

metaphor as figure of speech is roopakaalankaara in Sanskrit and as a kind of meaning, it is laakshaNikaartha.

  

In both these aspects there is enormous amount of discussion about this in Sanskrit S'aastras.

  

But metaphor theory is different from just the concept of metaphor in either of the meanings.

  

For example, conceptual theory posits metaphor as a function of thinking.

  

Even these issues such as whether different levels of meaning operate at the level of thinking or not is elaborately discussed in works such as Dhvanyaaloka.
