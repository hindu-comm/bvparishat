गुरुभ्यः सर्वेभ्यः नमो नमः।

Kindly pardon me for cross posting.

  

Some of my friend have been trying to look for various resources on finding some insights about the form-meaning (shabdam-artham) relationship in Sanskrit literature.

  

I came to know that Patanjali and Bhartrharitouched upon the topic, but I do not know what their conclusions are. I appreciate greatly if you could kindly give some insights for the following:

  

1\. Who touched upon (i)**form-meaning**relationship (Iconicity) and (ii) Metaphor theory in Sanskrit literature?  
2. Could you provide some references on these topics?  
  
Note: form-meaning relationship does not have to be merely phonological(*dhyanyanukaranaalu*)
