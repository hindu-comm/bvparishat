\> What do you mean by - metaphor in व्याकरणम् ?  

  

                           -------- Prof. Korada

  

Sri Suryaprasad said,

  

Who touched upon.........Metaphor theory in *Sanskrit literature*? (emphasis mine)  

  

So he did not limit it to Vyakaranam.

  

That is the reason I provided references for lakshaNaa etc.

  

As I already clarified iconicity is not just form-meaning relationship. it is the idea of 'form is the same as meaning'.

  

That is why I quoted,

  

सॊ ऽयमित्यभिसंबंधाद्रूपमेकीकृतं यदा /

शब्दस्यार्थॆन तं शब्दमभिजल्पं प्रचक्षतॆ //वाक्य\_२।१२८ //

  

Prof. Korada, with his expertise in this area, may further help Sri Suryaprasad with regard to this.
