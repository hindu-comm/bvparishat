Iconicity is covered mostly under the concept of auchitya in Indian poetics:

  

different kāvyānga-s such as vr̥tta, alankāra- particularly śabdālankāra, rīti,, guṇa-particularly śabdaguṇa, samāsadairghya and other such samāsaśilpa aspects, vākyaśilpa, vrittantargatapadavākyādisthānakr̥tavr̥ttaśilpa, etc. being bhāvōchita and rasōchita is called 'iconicity' in semiotics.
