Patanjali talks about shabda artha and pratyaya. The pratyaya part is the experiential one and no amount discussion will be of any help.
Individuals generally interpret words as meaning but such type of understanding leads to a mechanistic type of interpretation - vastusa prayoga. Only when one does sayama on words and their meaning will he understand the meaning of 'sidhe shabdartha sambandhe'.
