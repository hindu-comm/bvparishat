Netra Tantra, a very popular text in Kashmir Shaiva tradition, is also known as MrityujayaTantra or Mrityunjaya Bhattarakah. This was informed to me by Prof. Bettina Barumer who is working on its english translation at IIAS.

  

Pt. Vrajvallabh Dwivedi edited and published this text in 1995 along with Khemaraja's commentary. You can download it here: <https://archive.org/details/NetraTantramEdVrajVallabhaDwivedi>

  

Regards.
