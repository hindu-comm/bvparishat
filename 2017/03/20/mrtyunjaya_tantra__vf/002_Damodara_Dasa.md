Hare Krishna.  
  
Thankyou Samadarshiji for you kind reply. I am talking of Mrtyunjaya  
Tantra as it is refered to by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in  
his Krsna Book as follows:  
  
"After this, Lord Krsna and Arjuna entered a vast spiritual water.  
This spiritual water is called the Kärana Ocean, which means that this  
ocean is the origin of the creation of the material world; this place  
is also known as Virajä, because it is free from the influence of the  
three qualities of the material world. In the Mrtyunjaya-tantra, a  
Vedic scripture, there is a vivid description of this Kärana Ocean, or  
Virajä. It is stated there that the highest planetary system within  
the material world is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, beyond which are  
Rudraloka and Mahä-Visnuloka."  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
