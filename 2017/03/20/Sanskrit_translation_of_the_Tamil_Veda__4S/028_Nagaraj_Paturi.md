\>Periya Vaccan Pillai, a Tenkalai Acharya has explicitly said that Divya Prabhandam is more efficacious than Veda.  
He said that Vishnu's feet runs behind Tamizh Divya Prabhandam while Vedas go in search of Vishnu Paada.

  

------ This is not a Tamil -Sanskrit or Tamil -Veda issue. This is a Bhakti Vs Veda issue. In most of the Bhakti traditions, Bhakti is treated as superior to Shaastras and even Veda.

  

Vedas 'investigate' the ultimate Brahman.

  

Bhagavan loves Bhakti works so much that he helplessly follows them.

  

are two frequent popular expressions.

  

When you place them together for chamatkaara /wit, this kind of expression results. Audience of such expressions enjoy the poetic wit which has praise for bhaktapaaravas'ya of Bhagavan.

  

There are expressions such as Rishis and Munis try to catch you (in their heart.) You fall after innocent, rustic gopis.

  

Such expressions are not intended to humiliate rishis in preference to gopis or to praise gopis at the cost of the prestige of rishis.
