How can you say Vedic Rishis did no have Bhakthi?  

'Tenkalai' itself meant the supremacy of Tamil Hymns over Vedas and Veda-Vedanta became redundant  

No wonder the Vedic lineage shrunk to few 1000s now because of these poetic comparisons.  

A pauranika can take this but never a true Vaidika.  

Svata: Pramana is Veda and that is in Sanskrit only
