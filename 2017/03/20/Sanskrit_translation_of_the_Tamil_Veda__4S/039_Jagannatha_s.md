**Dramidopanishat-taatparya-ratnaavalee and Dramidopanishat-saara are fine summaries of Tiru-vaay-moli.**

**  
**

**(This is already informed to us by Vidwan Sri Srinivasa Krishnan)**

**  
**

**All the publications that contain stotras of Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya do have these two works.**

**  
**

**It is known that Venkataadhvarin(the famous author of
Vishvagunadarshachampu) had translated Tiru-vaay-moli. Unfortunately this work is lost. Only one verse from his translation is available. This is the verse:**

**![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/25875e5489e01/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  
**

**This verse is quoted in introduction of Kannada translation of Lakshmisahasra(I am sorry, I forgot the name of translator of Lakshmisahasra.)**

**  
**

**Another translation is Sahasra-Gaathaa-Ratnaavalee. Translator: Kalki Narasimha Bhagavaan.**

**  
**

**All these translations are in verses.**

**  
**

**The work, namely Sahasra-geeti (by Srinivasa Ramanuja Dasa) is in prose.
