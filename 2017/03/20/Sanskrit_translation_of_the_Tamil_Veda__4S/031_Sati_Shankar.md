AdarNIya vidvadjana,

  

Bhakti is a mArga, aimed to the same destination reached through surrender/unification/Self realization.

As all paths reach the same destination, choice of path is a matter choice depending on the instincts accumulated in the past as per our SanAtana dahrma.

The texts are the records of teachings and revealations of the seers, equipped with their own accumulated powers, that is why we see variations,

  

I think there should not be a dispute or misconception over it at least here.

Best wishes

Sati Shankar
