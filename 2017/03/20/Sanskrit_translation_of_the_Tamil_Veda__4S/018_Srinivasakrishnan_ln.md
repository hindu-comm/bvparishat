Well, there are two well-known paraphrases of Nammalvar's Thiruvaymozhi in Sanskrit. Both are by Venkatanatha (also known as Nigamanta Mahadesika). The first is called Dramidopanisadtatparyaratnavali which has approx. one Sanskrit verse per decad of Thiruvaymozhi's 110 decads. The second one is called Dramidopanisadsara which has approx. one Sanskrit verse per hundred of the original. Thiruvaymozhi has a total of 1102 verses distributed over 100 decads of 11 verses each - 10 regular plus one phalasruti verse. There's one decad which has 13 verses - 12 regular plus one phalasruti verse.

  

Both these works have a commentarial tradition in both Sanskrit and Tamil. I think these two works were printed most recently in the 1970s by the Visistadvaita Research Centre or Vedanta Desika Reseach Society
in Madras (now Chennai). I forget the exact name of the publishing entity.

  

If you have access to a university library system in the US, you can easily get hold of this 1970 edition. I know that the Univ of Michigan (U of M) has copies. I myself have seen them there some 20 years ago. Because they were in the U of M system, they are likely to have been digitized by google. That maybe another path to explore.

  

Hope this helps,
