Thank you very much to you all for giving your valuable time.

When I posted my query yesterday I really started with a clean slate, and by night I reached to a website which I see, would help me to begin at least.

The link is<http://www.srivaishnavam.com/index.html>

  

So far as the Dravidian and Sanskrit issue which crept into the thread is concerned, I think we are on the verge of consolidating our own position and refining our own texts, to make it free from Anglo-Indian stains. Be it Hindi, or Tamil or Bangla.... whatever language and script, if it is closer to our heart and helps us "internalize" the truth which our Texts have been carrying, should be accepted.

Thanks again for your pointers and replies.

Regards

Sati Shankar
