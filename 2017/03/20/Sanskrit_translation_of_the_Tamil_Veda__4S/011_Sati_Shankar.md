Dear Ravishankar Ji,

I agree with what you have said on the impressions and presentations which came during the last fewcenturies.

  

My purpose is to put DraviNa or Tamil Veda, which I came to know about during a conference at Chennai the last year.

I wish to study that side by side the Veda we have in Sanskrit.

Regards

Yours

Sati Shankar
