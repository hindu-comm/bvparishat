Dear Sri Ravi Shankar and Sri Nagendra,

  

I am happy to see your respect for the Veda.

  

I agree with you in saying that Bhakti is part of Veda. To consider Bhakti as avaidik is not correct, I agree.

  

Recently, I had to explain the same to an Indology list member who expressed his surprise at Bhakti being called Vedic. (His surprise was that an ISKCON based eco-village website called its approach Vedic. I told him that ISKCON follows Gaudiya Vaishnava Vedanta which is one of the traditions of Bhakti Vedanta, all Vedanta is Vedic, hence traditions of Bhakti Vedanta are also Vedic.)

  

I provided several arguments for why Bhakti is Vedic.

  

One Prof. Shyam Ranganathan gave his own arguments for how Bhakti can be said to be in Veda.

  

The point is that Draavida Veda concept of Sri Vaishnava tradition is part of their Bhakti Vedanta tradition. As a Vedanta tradition , Sri Vaishnavism or Vis'ishTaadvaita Vedanta follows Veda praamaaNya. Hence any concept of them such as DraaviDa Veda should be viewed /understood in consistency with their Veda praamaaNya vaada only.

  

The word Veda in DraaviDa Veda, thus, has to be taken in a laakshaNika /metaphorical sense.

  

When it is said त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदाः निनिस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन ! it is not disrespect for Vedas.
