In practice in TN and other Southern states,

In Saiva aagama temples after aarthi. hymns from 4 vedas are recited. After that Thiruvasagam/Devaram/(some more) is recited by Oodhuvaars. If that is not possible carnatic songs or atleast some slokas are sung in praise of the Deva/Devi. This part is referred to as Thiravida Veda by the temple archakaas. It can be seen on friday during Chandramouiswara pooja by Sringeri Acharya. The chief pandita, after requesting pandithas of different veda to recite there veda, then asks to recite Thiravida veda.

  

Almost similar is practiced in Vaishnava sampradaya (singing naalayara thivya prabandham).  

  

In earlier days when the bhakti tradition was evolving and Nayanmars/Nayanars were guiding the bhakti in this region, this was accommodated as part of the ritual.

  

It is just the Indian cultural mentality to accommodate. No competition or comparison. Some authors can write X,Y,Z in books after inquiring some people and putting there own perspective.

  

The new method of suffixing "Veda" to bible or quran is part of the conversion techniques. They do multiple level of translations starting from Veda in sanskrit to "Marai" in tamil then lots of convenient talks to say it is Veda.

  

This should not be mixed with existing sanatana dharma tradition in South. First is voluntarily accommodated in the society to elevate the devotion to Ishwara, which leads to better life.
