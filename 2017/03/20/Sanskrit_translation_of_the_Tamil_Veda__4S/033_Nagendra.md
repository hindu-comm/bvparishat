SrutirEva garIyasI..

  

Any kind of scriptures, either bhaktibor gnyayana or smruti, purana or itihasa Or a stotra for that matter if it dosen't follow veda (Sruti) it is called avaidik and any sampradaya which dosen't accept supremacy of Sruti/Veda , though it accepts the iswaratwa is called avaidika mata / paa khanda mata.

  

Some one mentioned that the "vedas are for yagnya" the ruks are suktams (su-uktam ie storams), when they are used for yagnya they become yajuss... bhakti is part of gnyana and is not a seperate subject at all. There is no question of Veda vs Bhakti,

  

Thanks
