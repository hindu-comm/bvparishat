\>Moreover it is not just the equal respect.

\>If you consider TN's history there was always an effort from Tamils to fill the vacuum in their language (Absence of Vedas).  

\>So the acharyas of Shaivaite and Vaishnavaite sects emphasized that their Tamil saints are like Rishis and gave the hymns as a revelation \>and not composition.

  

------- This is not a healthy perspective.

  

1. By the time the concept of Draavida Veda was being proposed, all the present day politics of Tamil-Sanskrit competition etc. did not exist.

  

2. None of those who contributed the idea of Draavida Veda had any disrespect or relatively less respect towards Sanskrit.

  

3. Nowhere, in no temple, where Draavida Veda is used / recited in temple rituals, Vedic hymns are set aside or replaced by the devotional texts of Draavida Veda.

  

4. If any idea in any Vedic mantra is theorized to be found in any other text of Indian culture, it does no harm to the apaurusheyatva of Veda.
