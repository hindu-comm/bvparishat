I am not sure if any standard translation of Tiruvilayadal Puranam is available. I will surely check shortly.  

Siva Lilarnavam by Nilakanta Dikshitar is available in Sanskrit but does not contain the social history  

  
Periya Vaccan Pillai, a Tenkalai Acharya has explicitly said that Divya Prabhandam is more efficacious than Veda.  

He said that Vishnu's feet runs behind Tamizh Divya Prabhandam while Vedas go in search of Vishnu Paada.  

(In Utsavam, Prabhanda Goshti will move ahead of the Utsava Murti while Veda Goshti will follow the Murti in TN)  

  
Tolkappiyam Translation is available from KSRI Chennai.
