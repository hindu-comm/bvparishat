Dear Sri Nagendra,

  

This thread is not about Tamil translation of Veda but Sanskrit translation of what is called as Draavida (Tamil) Veda.

  

It has already been said in the previous posts in the thread that Draavida (Tamil) Veda is not Tamil translation of Veda.

  

The Veda that is in the Vaidika Sanskrit, was associated with yajna.

  

The temple worship is linked to Puranas, Puranic gods and Aagama texts.

  

Contemporary majority popular Indian culture, which is being called Hinduism is centered around this temple worship culture.

  

This culture is an amalgamation of local (folk) cultures and the Vedic culture.

  

As such, use of local languages, and use of songs and other cultural elements in those languages as part of temple culture is but natural.  

  

In fact such use of the participant's ('devotee's) own language is considered to be democratic, reducing the distance between the devotee and the language used for devotion.

  

Recognition of this principle by the early exponents of Bhakti traditions such as Tamil Shaivism, Sri Vaishnavism, Veera Shaivism etc., in itself was a great awareness of need of space and time. It is particularly admirable since the leaders of these traditions themselves were highly accomplished scholars in Veda and Sanskrit.

  

Palkuriki Somanathudu was such a learned Sanskrit scholar that he wrote Brahma Sutra Bhashya and some Sanskrit udaaharaNa works etc. But he advocated use of Telugu and native Telugu meters, so much that he says dvipada,( the doha-like anushtub-like two lined native Telugu meter ) is as respectable as Veda.

  

There is a parallel emergence of Kannada texts during the same period. (Palkuriki contributed even to thoat Kannada corpus)

  

Such praise of local forms of literary expressions as 'equal to Veda' was just to take the praise to the superlative degree.

  

Elsewhere in the world, translating authoritative religious texts such as holy books into modern vernacular languages from Latin and Hebrew was to be demanded for democratization of religion as part of modernity.

  

But here expressions in vernaculars are elevated to the status of authoritative texts many centuries earlier to the above mentioned developments in other parts of the world.

  

Those who view facts from this perspective admire the concept of Draavida Veda in stead of denouncing it.
