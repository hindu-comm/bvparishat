The Shaivaite and Vaishnavaite traditions hold their Devotional hymns as Tamil Veda  
Tamil Movement made Sangam Poetry and Tirukkural as Tamil Veda last century  
Shockingly Bible was translated with the title 'Pari Suddha Veda Agamam' in Tamil and still it is printed with the same title.  
If you require translations of Shaivaite texts visit [www.shaivam.org](http://www.shaivam.org) & <http://thevaaram.org/>  
No wonder Tamilnadu was glorified as land of Vedas by the National Poet Bharathi  
However Tamils are still trying to establish what is Tamil Veda still
