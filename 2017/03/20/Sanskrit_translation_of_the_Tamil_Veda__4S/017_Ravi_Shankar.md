Dear Sri Paruriji  

I have not said so. But Sri Satishji has said that he is going to keep both the texts side by side (Quote - I wish to study that side by side the Veda we have in Sanskrit.)  

He shouldn't be surprised. So I gave the fact.  

  

Moreover it is not just the equal respect.  

If you consider TN's history there was always an effort from Tamils to fill the vacuum in their language (Absence of Vedas).  

So the acharyas of Shaivaite and Vaishnavaite sects emphasized that their Tamil saints are like Rishis and gave the hymns as a revelation and not composition.  
  

There are academicians who sill hold the fallacy that Shaivagamas were originally in Tamil, got translated into Sanskrit and destroyed by Aryan-Bramins who hold custody to the temples.  
  

Ideally naming any other text other than the Vedas as Veda is not only a misnomer but a disgrace to the concept of Apaurusheyatva of Shruthi  

It is akin Ramaksrishna Upanishad, Ramanopanishad and the epitome is Allopanishad  
  

I do not mean any disrespect to the religious experiences and their hymns of the Tamil Saints but requesting you to consider the socio-historical background of the eulogy of Tamil Veda  

  

Regards  
Ravishankar
