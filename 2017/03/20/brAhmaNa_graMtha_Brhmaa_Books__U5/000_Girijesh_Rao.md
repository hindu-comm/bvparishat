Respected all,

  

My queries relate to 'ब्राह्मण Brāhmaṇa' part of the Ved-s.

  

1\. What is etymological meaning of 'ब्राह्मण Brāhmaṇa' in relevant context? Sanskṛt derivation with English or Hindi meaning will be useful.

  

2\. Why are the collection of non-Mantra part of Ved-s with 'आरण्यक Āraṇyak-s' and 'उपनिषद Upniṣada-s' called collectively 'ब्राह्मण Brāhmaṇa'?

  

3\. Apart from the well known but suspected story of 'Taittiri' birds related to कृष्ण Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda, what are the reasons for the two recensions 'कृष्ण Kṛṣṇa' and 'शुक्ल Śhukla' in Yajurved?

  

4\. Should the prose and poetry mix parts of Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda be considered as 'अपौरुषेय Apauruṣeya' like other Sanhita-s i.e. Ṛk, Sāma and Atharva?

  

Thanking you,

  

With regards,

  

Girijesh
