One interesting feature of the Narasimha Kshetras of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh is almost all of them are on hills. Each of them has a name alternative to its famous name. This alternative name in almost all cases begins with the word Veda. Names are Vedaadri, Vedaachalam, Vedagiri etc.

  

The famous Kshetra being developed on a grand scale by the present government of Telangana is known as Yaadagirigutta (Yadagirigutta). In fact, that is a rural pronunciation of Vedagirigutta only. Vedagiri +guTTa. guTTa =hill.
