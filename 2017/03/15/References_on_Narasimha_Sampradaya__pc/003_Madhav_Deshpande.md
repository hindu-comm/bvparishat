There is also a strong presence of Narasimha worship in Maharashtra centered in such popular places like Nira Narasinghpur, with a temple of Narasimha on the banks of the river Nīrā. This Narasimha is the Kuladaivata of my family who comes from the nearby town of Tembhurni, close to Solapur in Maharashtra.
