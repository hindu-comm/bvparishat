Dear list

  

The Hindu Dharma Kosha, a Hindi book by Ramdas Gaur, has a section on Narasimha Sampradaya.Klaus K. Klostermaier in his*Survey of Hinduism* (2010, SUNY Press, ISBN 9780791480113, p. 307) also refers to this section by Gaur.

The book by Gaur has only a snippet view availbale on Google Books (<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mbYoAAAAYAAJ>). I would be obliged if anybody can help with references on Narasimha Sampradaya or the section on it by Gaur in his book.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
