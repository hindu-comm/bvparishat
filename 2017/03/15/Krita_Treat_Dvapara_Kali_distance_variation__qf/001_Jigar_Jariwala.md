hello shreekanth,

The basic scale of time is one respiration. Multiplying the duration of one respiration, seconds are calculated and based on those calculations, days and years are calculated. The basic chatur yuga cycle (cycle of four yugas between mega annihilations and new creation) is about 4320000 years of which, 432000 years are for kaliyuga, 864000 are for dwapara yuga, 1296000 are for treta yuga and 1728000 years make the duration for one krit (satyuga) yuga ...... adding all the durations, they sum up to 4320000 years.

  

Thank You
