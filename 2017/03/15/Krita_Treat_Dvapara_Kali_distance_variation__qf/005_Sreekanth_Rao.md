Thank you, here I am not talking from the gavyuti standpoint rather I am trying to say it's a function of hasta. Yojana is a function of body measurement. And in krita yuga the body size was much bigger compared to Kali yuga please read the story of revathi wife of balarama. I am not sure exactly what is the size ratio. Hence one yojana in krita yuga will be larger in comparision to one yojana in kali yuga. I would like to know by how much. There is hint given by Acharya madhva in brihadaranyaka bhashya that it will be large.
