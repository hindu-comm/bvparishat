Dear Sri Shivaraj Singh,

  

I think I know where you are coming from.

  

You probably consider that the theory that south Indian languages belong to a different family of languages ( which is given the name Dravidian family of languages) than the family of languages to which Sanskrit, Prakrit(s) and north Indian languages belong to be an invalid theory and a western conspiracy.

  

But as long as you can not come up with a new theory that can explain the facts that are explained by the theories of Dravidian and Indoeuropean families, there is no point in harping on the theory that all Indian languages come from Sanskrit.

  

I can help you understand the reasoning through which these theories are arrived at.

  

If you have / develop a strong counter to that reasoning, then you may publish it and get it accepted in the academic circles.

  

Until then, the theory that south Indian languages have no genetic connection with Sanskrit, shall stay.
