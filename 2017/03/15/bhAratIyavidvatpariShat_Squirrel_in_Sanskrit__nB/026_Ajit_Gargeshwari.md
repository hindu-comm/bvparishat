If one says Prakrit is 'Sanskrit/ Prakrit' is a single , one and the same language then one can say there exists only a few languages in India apart from Sanskrit. The answer is begging the question.  
  

All languages except Sanskrit absorbs new words that is what I was trying to say. Sanskrit words are fixed and scope of adding new words exists but is limited.  
  

There is absolutely no misunderstanding Sanskrit Langauge is fixed and was fixed long time back whereas prakrit are evolving languages and are still evolving
