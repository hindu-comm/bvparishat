Thank you Prof. Paturi. I have nothing much to add about what you had written. It is well established theory there is no doubt. I think writing more might deviate away from this thread. This is a possible theory that has been proposed that There was only one language in India (leaving south India and may smaller regions of out ) that was Sanskrit and that language evolved to many languages that India has. This is a good theory which is highly debatable and problematic. When one asks the question how did that one Language became many and why that one language remained fixed and remained static all the time. Perhaps the answer would be Sanskrit remained fixed by its own grammar and was always restricted to certain class and section of society or was the medium for higher education and Prakrits were languages that was used by the masses.  
  

Now let me write about a theory that Sanskrit is static a language after the time of Muni traya Has there been any data to show that Sanskrit language evolved no there is not there is enough literature which shows Sanskrit language was fixed and remained static by its own grammatical rules.  
  
During the past 400 years years or Kannada, Telugu Tamil etc are the medium of instruction even to study Sanskrit at elementary level and for day to day activities so was it is in north India they have different langauges  
  
Recently there has been a trend or a group which thinks the only way to keep Sanskrit studies alive is to tell I speak Sanskrit who do this to distort census report and not for the love of language.

  

Now since there is no Sanskrit word for squirrels and butterflies one has to see Prakrit words or accept words proposed in this thread
