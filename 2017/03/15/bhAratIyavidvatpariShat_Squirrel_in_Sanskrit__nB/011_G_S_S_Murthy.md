Many thanks to all the scholars who have taken pains to ferret out Sanskrit words which look like they denote the "squirrel".Prof.Iyengar's quote from Vaijayanti is most convincing. How I wish we could locate a text (other than kosha listing) where it could be said that the author could not have meant anything other than a squirrel, which has so many pretty characteristics.

Sometime back I ran into difficulties in locating a Sanskrit word that denotes "butterfly". I had to finally go by the Great Apte who perhaps coined the word ' चित्रपतन्ग'. There is a need, I believe, to do research in the matter of simple objects apparently missing in Sanskrit vocabulary.

My gratitude to all for helping me.

Regards,

Murthy
