spelled as गुण्डुचिमूषा used as one word.  

I don't know the origin though.  

In oDiA the qualifier+class compound is common.  

The qualifier can also be used as the noun, for example गुण्डुचि only.  

In local speech usage, उण्ड् is a verb with the meaning "search".  

So गुण्डुचि may mean "moving and searching", the form as a present participle
