================================  
Some points :  
  
a) Prakrit grammars have a fourfold division of words (pada) into: naman(noun), akhyata (verb), etc.  
  
b) In Tamil the four classes of words are : peyarssol (name word), vinaissol (act-word), etc. The first is a literal translation of the Sanskrit nama(pada), the second is for kriya; akhyata being , apparently, untranslatable in Tamil.  
  
Pada occurs in all these works as the term for a word. Furthermore in Talkappiyam, moli==word, being a translation of pada is used. In the Nannul, pada is preferred, sol with the sense of word is also used.  
  
If we come to phonetics in Tolkappiyam a vowel is call uyir, that is, breath, or life. In Sanskrit grammars a svara (or sara in Pali) is used for a vowel. This word is obvioulsy the original of uyir; svara means sound and breath also.  
  
Why so much similarity in grammars if these two languages do not share a genetic origin?
