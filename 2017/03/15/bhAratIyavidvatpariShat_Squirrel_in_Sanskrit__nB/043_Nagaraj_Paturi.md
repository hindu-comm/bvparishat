Thanks for this verse Sri Ujjwal Rajputji since this removes the intrigue and proves that the word for squirrel is found in one of the dialects of a language whose standard form is Sanskrit. Word for certain entities being found in dialects of a language and the same not being found in the standard form of the language and vice versa is common and found in contemporary languages too.
