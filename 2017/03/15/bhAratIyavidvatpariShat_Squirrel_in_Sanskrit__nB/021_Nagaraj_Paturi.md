Bus issue and squirrel issue are not comparable.

  

Bus is a new product which did not exist when Kannada was forming its native words or was borrowing words from Sanskrit, Prakrit or Arabic / Persian. So it is natural that the English word was borrowed.

  

But if you consider squirrel to be existing and /or widely found in those parts of India where Sanskrit was used and there is no Sanskrit word found for that animal, that is certainly an issue and is natural as Bus not being in Kannada.

  

Issue of butterfly is the same.

  

If there is no word for a certain entity in a certain language, it can also be conjectured that that entity was either not there or was not widely found in the area where that language was used, during the period when it was used.

  

Were butterflies or squirrels there in the areas where Sanskrit was spoken? If they existed or widely found, but the word for them is not found in Sanskrit, then it is certainly intriguing.

  

Is there independent evidence to say they existed then?
