\>If one says Prakrit is'Sanskrit/ Prakrit' is a single , one and the same languagethen one can say there exists only a few languages in India apart from Sanskrit. The answer is begging the question.

  

If you are looking at today's multiple Indian languages and are imagining that 'Sanskrit/Prakrit is a single language' is against this fact, the mistake is in bringing today's data as counter to the statement 'Sanskrit/Prakrit is a single language' which is about a situation many centuries older.

  

Even during the period when the single language called Sanskrit/Prakrit was spoken, apart from this (single) language other vibhaashaas, dEs'abhaashaas, bhaashaas of the nishaada and other human groups which did not have genetic connection with the (single) language Sanskrit-Prakrit were spoken in India and were spoken of in ancient Sanskrit and Prakrit literature. In modern parlance, these bhaashaas may refer to the languages of Dravidian, Austroasiatic, Sinotibetan families and some other languages outside these families.

  

Please remember that different languages of the same language family are believed /theorized to be once dialects of the same language which in course of evolution develop into mutually unintelligible entities and as a result, turn out to be /are called as different languages.

  

The same happened to the dialects of the (single) language Sanskrit -Prakrit. The dialects called Prakrits of this language, in course of evolution, changed into several mutually unintelligible entities and thus became different languages which are the ancient forms of the older versions of the contemporary north Indian languages.

  

' Sanskrit is fixed ' etc. are naive understandings of nature of languages. No language is fixed.

  

Books like "Evolution of the Sanskrit language from Pāṇini to Patañjali " bySureshachandra Dnyaneshwar Laddu and many similar works provide evidence for evolution of Sanskrit from time to time.

  

Apart from this, Sanskrit expressions getting rusticized into Prakrit expressions and Prakrit expressions getting 'refined' into Sanskrit expressions was a perpetual two way process. As such, one of them changing/evolving, the other notchanging/evolving is improbable and even impossible.

  

Modern researchers talk of substrata of other languages in Rigveda itself and talk more freely of such substrata in laukika Sanskrita. Viewing Sanskrit as some insulated entity, retaining its 'pure' uninflunced and uninfluencable form is considered to be against the spirit of modern research.
