\>This is a possible theory that has  
been proposed that There was only one language in India  
(leaving south India and may smaller regions of out ) that  
was Sanskrit and that language evolved to many languages  
that India has.  
-- That can be better worded as follows:  
There was a period in Indian history  
when major geographical area of the Indic subcontinent,  
particularly its northern part had speakers of one single  
language, standard variety of which is (today being)  
called Sanskrit and the dialects of which are (today being)  
called Prakrits. The dialects of this language evolved into  
different languages that are being spoken in the northern  
parts of the Indic  
subcontinent.

What is the relationship of Tamil to Sanskrit?  
  
What about the relationship of other south Indian languages to Sanskrit?
