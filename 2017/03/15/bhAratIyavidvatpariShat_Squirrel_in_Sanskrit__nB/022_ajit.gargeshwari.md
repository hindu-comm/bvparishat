I know they are indeed intriguing not to have known words in usage for squirrels or butterflies in Sanskrit. If one doesn't have new word then a new word has to be coined. Since Kannada speaking people decided not to coin a new word for bus they started saying bassu for bus. Similarly one can coin a word and start using them in Sanskrit or Can modify a word found in usage from other languages and introduce them to Sanskrit.  
  
How can one arrive at definite answer to the question why there are no words for common squirrels or butterflies for Sanskrit? Words are more artificially coined and introduced in other languages more frequently perhaps than in Sanskrit language since the usage of Sanskrit language is limited to a few scholars and was never the main language of the masses. Sanskrit language doesn't have the flexibility as does other languages have in terms of absorbing or coining of new words.
