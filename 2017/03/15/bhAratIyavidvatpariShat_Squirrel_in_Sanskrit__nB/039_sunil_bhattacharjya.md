Dear Nagarajji,  
  

In the Ramayana, to my knowledge, Hanumanji says about two languages, one of them being the Sanskrit, and he was in a dilemma as to in which language he should speak to mother Sita. In the Manu Smriti, if I am right, the sage Manu says that there were two languages, one of them being the Arya bhasha and the other the Mleccha-bhasha.. This makes us visualize that in the ancient times,there were two bhashas one of them was the Sanskrit or the Arya-bhasha and the second was the unrefined or Mleccha bhasha. Lord Budddha preached in Magadhi Prakrt and this commoners' language of that time came to be known as Pali and became canonical bhasha for the Buddhists. Magadhi prakrt evolved further into the other variants with passage of time. For example, much later in Lord Mahavira's time, one of the evolved languages was the Ardhamagadhi or the Jaina-prakrt. I am open to correction,  
  

Regards,
