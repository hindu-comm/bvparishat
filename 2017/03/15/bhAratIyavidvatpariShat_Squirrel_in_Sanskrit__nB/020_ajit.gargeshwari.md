There are no Sanskrit equivalents for certain words. New words can be coined as per the rules of grammar If the word चिक्रोडः has been used in Sanskrit Literature for squirrel then perhaps that's the closest equivalent. In Kannada there is no word for Bus. Some people say Bassu for Bus and call it Kannada but no grammar of Kannada can give such a derivation though its a popular usage.  
The word चित्रपतन्ग' can be used for butterflies or even for Kite
