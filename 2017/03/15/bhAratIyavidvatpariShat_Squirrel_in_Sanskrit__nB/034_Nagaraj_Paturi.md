\>This is a possible theory that has been proposed that There was only one language in India (leaving south India and may smaller regions of out ) that was Sanskrit and that language evolved to many languages that India has.

  

-- That can be better worded as follows:

  

There was a period in Indian history when major geographical area of the Indic subcontinent, particularly its northern part had speakers of one single language, standard variety of which is (today being) called Sanskrit and the dialects of which are (today being) called Prakrits. The dialects of this language evolved into different languages that are being spoken in the northern parts of the Indic subcontinent.

  

\>This is a good theory which is highly debatable and problematic.

  

-- This is not a theory but a fact staring into the observer's face. Evidences:

  

1. If the language situation reflected in Sanskrit plays, viz., Sanskrit speaker speaking to Prakrit speaker and vice versa with mutual intelligibility and Prakrit used there always being suited to Sanskrit chaayaa with a small change of sounds, was not the reality at any part of Indian history, the plays would not have been received by their readers /audience as reflecting sociolinguistic reality. If there is a reality of that kind, the two forms of language can not be considered as two different languages.

  

2. Books like Vakyapadiyam dealing with language issue always treated the two as different versions of the same language.

  

\>When one asks the question how did that one Language became many

  

--- That question is not asked because researchers do not move from that one language to the many languages. They start from the many different languages of north India and trace their history. When they keep moving backwards into the various stages through which these many different languages evolved, they are bound to reach a stage where the ancestral forms of these languages were nothing but the Prakrits, the dialects of a language, standard form of which was Sanskrit.Since no one is saying that it is Sanskrit, the standard form which evolved into many language, since what is being said is that it is the different dialects of that language which evolved into many different languages, there is no scope for such a question.

  

\>why that one language remained fixed and remained static all the time.

  

-- That one language is not just the standard form called Sanskrit but its dialects called Prakrits too. So that one language remained fixed is not a fact.

  

Even if one understands your statement as 'the standard form of that language called Sanskrit remained fixed, it is not a correct understanding. All standard forms of all languages are slow in their change compared to their dialects. This slowness in change may give the impression of no change. But it is just a false impression. Not a fact.

  

It is this impression/claim of no change in the literary or classical variety of languages such as Telugu and Kannada,that was contested and countered by the leaders of the spoken language movements that arose during the advent of modern period. Those who opposed the spoken language movements and advocated the continuance of the literary variety, (at least in the case of Telugu ) argued that the greatness of the literary variety was that it remained static /unchanged through the course of centuries of history. The leaders of the spoken language movement (at least in Telugu) published well argued and well substantiated pieces establishing that the literary variety underwent change at every stage of its history. This awareness that languages , even their literary varieties, can not remain static and to understand the histories of languages was considered to be the gift of modern research to humanity.

  

In the same spirit, to consider that Sanskrit remained static can be viewed as contrary to the spirit of modern research.

  

What is ironical is that the understanding of those of the modern researchers who consider Sanskrit to have remained without change, make the same claim as the target of ridicule, viz., traditional Sanskrit scholars who consider remaining unchanged as the greatness of Sanskrit achieved thanks to the power of anus'aasana of Panini's grammar.

  

Those of the modern researchers who take pride in being historicists or historical researchers of language take pride in disproving the claim of the traditional scholars that Panini could bring in unchangeability to Sanskrit.

  

Grammars like all other tools of language standardization do certainly contribute to slowing the change in the standard form but they can never completely arrest the change in that language. Panini's grammar is no exception to this.
