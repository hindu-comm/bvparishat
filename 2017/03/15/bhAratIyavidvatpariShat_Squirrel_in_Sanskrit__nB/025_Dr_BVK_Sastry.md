Namaste



Can we reframe the question differently in this case and explore this issue ? The objective is to find out the logic on how a Sanskrit word is framed for a given entity ? Are there/ were there any rules and discipline that guides us here ?



I fully agree with the observation \< Is there independent evidence to say they existed then? > and with a suggested sub-question \< What constraints prompted such words to appear or disappear from language user society ? >



Here is a thought navigation that leads to the articulation of the question. The cut off reference line taken is 1700 C.E when the new models of Sanskrit Lexicons and translations found their fore in to the academic system and education process. (And of course the pushing of the traditional lexicons to a ‘coma’ phase>.



1. Samskrutham ( Sanskrit) has been there in Indian society for
6000 plus years ( or less if one wants to scale down ) or 1000 plus years ( for conservatives) and used in Indian landscape and society. During this period, language users have taken note of the ‘ entities – objects – animals – artifacts..’ in nature and society for which the users gave a name. 



 **- The entities like ‘ butterfly’ existed in India** (
<http://www.ifoundbutterflies.org/> says : Welcome to Butterflies of India, an internet-based and peer-reviewed resource devoted to Indian butterflies. India is one of the 17 "mega diverse" countries of the world. It is host to a spectacular number of butterflies: approximately 1,800 species and subspecies. About 15-20% of these are endemic to the Indian Region, which makes this an especially important region for butterfly diversity and conservation.



 **Question (butterflies)** : Did the Indian communities use a word to identify the varieties of ‘ butterflies’ ?
Varieties of butterflies ? and keep a word for them in Sanskrit ?
And for all the 1800 species to be identified individually ? what would have been the reason to frame a word like \< नक्रमक्षिका - (H3) नक्र--मक्षिका \[p= 524,1\] \[L=102820\] f. a kind of fly L. >? The notation ‘ L’ means LEXICOGRAPHERS Addition.



 - **The objects like bus did not exist** ( And so did many of the artifacts like computer, cell phone, E-mail, Voice Message, Internet used in our society). So why do we even make an expectation of a ‘word’ for such entities in ancient period vocabulary ? The Sanskrit language lovers have come out with new terms for current use.



 **Question (bus)** : Who is the agency responsible for this ‘ Sanskrit Word Manufacturing for every object around us ’ and feeding it user society ? and ‘ language resource maintenance to fit the new words to the firm –frame work of Samskrutham ?



**Note:** What are we to understand in Sanskrit vyakarana tradition, by Patanjali’s observation on ‘shabda –vyavahara’ and Panini Sutra – ‘tadashishyam samjnaa pramaanatvaat’ ? Did any grammarian or lexicographer in Sanskrit stake claims for such a work? OR, did a Sanskrit language using society go to the ‘ grammarian - lexicographer’ to ask them for a ‘ prescription word’ or ‘approval of word-in-usage’ and a ‘ grammar rule justification’ for derivation !
Is grammarian- lexicographer combine’ responsible for this ‘ Lexicon Enhancing and upkeep –clean up activity ’ ? ( This kind of language activity is an ongoing work in many social languages like English, which produce annual Lexicons, Word usage standards, new word listings, Meaning shade changes, media and literature nuances of usage )




- **IF there is no word for a certain activity in certain language, it can be conjectured ….. **This is a logic with serious defects in the ‘ Thought-womb’ itself. Taking Current language usage as a ‘Telescope or a microscope’ for ‘ over projecting ‘ History’ and ‘ intelligence of a civilization’ to ride on ‘Current usage of an ancient rule bound language’ carries a serious limitation. I will limit my analysis here
to the domain of Samskrutham to show the fallacy here.



 Take the ‘ lexicon term for denoting the shining objects up above the sky, called ‘Stars and planets’ in English. The word I am focusing is ‘ nakShathra’. The lexicon lists the following word , along with many others, with a specific translation as below:



नक्षत्रजा - (H3) नक्षत्र--जा \[p= 524,2\] \[L=102844\] mfn. star-born
; (H3B) नक्षत्र--जा \[p= 524,2\] \[L=102844.1\] m. son of the stars AV.



 **Question ( no word for certain activity…. )** :
Just because such words exist in the lexicon, and lend themselves to a plausible translation as above, can one infer a state of advanced life sciences or Astro-physics concepts association ‘during the period when it was used’ ? which we somehow seem to have missed in the current teachings of Sanskrit ?

Bus issue and squirrel issue are not comparable.



Bus is a new product which did not exist when Kannada was forming its native words or was borrowing words from Sanskrit, Prakrit or Arabic / Persian. So it is natural that the English word was borrowed.



But if you consider squirrel to be existing and /or widely found in those parts of India where Sanskrit was used and there is no Sanskrit word found for that animal, that is certainly an issue and is natural as Bus not being in Kannada.



Issue of butterfly is the same.



If there is no word for a certain entity in a certain language, it can also be conjectured that that entity was either not there or was not widely found in the area where that language was used, during the period when it was used.



Were butterflies or squirrels there in the areas where Sanskrit was spoken? If they existed or widely found, but the word for them is not found in Sanskrit, then it is certainly intriguing.



Is there independent evidence to say they existed then?

There are no Sanskrit equivalents for certain words. New words can be coined as per the rules of grammar If the word चिक्रोडः has been used in Sanskrit Literature for squirrel then perhaps that's the closest equivalent. In Kannada there is no word for Bus. Some people say Bassu for Bus and call it Kannada but no grammar of Kannada can give such a derivation though its a popular usage.  
The word चित्रपतन्ग' can be used for butterflies or even for Kite

Sometime back I ran into difficulties in locating a Sanskrit word that denotes "butterfly". I had to finally go by the Great Apte who perhaps coined the word ' चित्रपतन्ग'. There is a need, I believe, to do research in the matter of simple objects apparently missing in Sanskrit vocabulary.





Had the same issue in 2004, found no answer in Delhi.
