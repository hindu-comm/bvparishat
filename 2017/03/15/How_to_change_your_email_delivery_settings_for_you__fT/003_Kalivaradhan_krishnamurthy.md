HariH OM!

  

Namaskarams,

  

I have been getting digest mail only so far but now for couple of days I have started getting individual postings although I have not changed my mail delivery settings.

  

Still, I went as per your instructions to the group page following the link you have given and when pressed on My settings it gave 'Membership and Email settings" alright.

  

But it does not give the option "Email delivery preference" instead a pop up screen displays my Display Name and ask me whether I want to change it.

  

Nothing at all for specifying delivery method.

  

Kindly help me resolve this problem.

  

DhanyavadaH
