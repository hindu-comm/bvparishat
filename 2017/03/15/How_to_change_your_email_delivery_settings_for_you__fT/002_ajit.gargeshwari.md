It would have been preferable if the moderators had allowed individuals to retain their personal settings and asked members to edit posts if they receive BVP mail in a digest format. How a member would like to receive mails can always be changed by the member and then a member may post the digest again to BVP. This has happened in spite of several requests in the past to edit mails before postings and not to top posts.  
  
Topping of posts also makes posts too long and makes the mail large is size.
