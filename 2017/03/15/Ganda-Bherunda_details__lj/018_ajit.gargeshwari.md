True as written by Prof. Iyengar "I belongto Mysore, where the symbol of the Royalty (Wodeyars) is(GanNDa) BheruNDa (ಗಂಡ ಭೇರುಂಡ )The word GaNDa appears to be a typical old Kannada prefix meaning 'strong/masculine/fearsome..' The word as an honorific for Kings (11th Cent.) is available in several (about ten) epigraphs in the Mysore region. See Epigraphia Carnatica Volumes; for example:
