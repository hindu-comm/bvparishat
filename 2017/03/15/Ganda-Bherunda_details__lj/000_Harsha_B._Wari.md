Dear scholars,

  

Pranam,

  

Recently my Russian friend started researching their state symbol which is a mystical bird with two heads and which represents superior power.

  

His research led him to the mention of Ganda Bherunda in vedic scriptures. Paramatika upanishad gives some details of the story and further gives the reference of 37th chapter of narasimha purana.

  

However we were unable to find any mention in the 37th chapter of narasimha purana.

  

Further, were told by a priest who worships the form of Ganda-Bherunda in a temple at Chennai, to look for the mantra section of atharva veda. We need help.

  

Can anyone guide us please.

  

Om Tat Sat,
