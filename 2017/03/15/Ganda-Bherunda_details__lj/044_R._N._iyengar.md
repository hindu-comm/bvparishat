**Vedic Śarabha (Contd. from my previous post)**

My interest in this animal is because it shares attention of Vedic seers with the *Gaura* of the Ṛgveda on which I spent time identifying it as the wild ass (*Khur*) still flourishing in the Rann-of-kutch region.

Interesting and useful information has been posted in another thread by scholars in Ayurveda. From what I could understand (correction requested) Caraka and Suśruta in the BC period have not said that Śarabha had eight legs. It is in the commentaries (Chakrapāṇi-datta 10^(th) cent; Dalhaṇa 11^(th) cent; Kaiyadeva 15^(th) cent) that we hear

**शरभः********अष्टापद********उष्ट्रप्रमाणो********महाशृङ्गः********पृष्ठगतचतुष्पादः********काश्मीरे********प्रसिद्धः**

Since the three repeat almost the same information, the explanation may not be due to direct observation of the animal after identification. Al-beruni (11^(th) Cent.) in his book on India mentions that ***people relate*** that Śarabha (in the Konkan region) has four additional leg-like parts (two up-turned) at its back and that the animal attacks elephants.

Now, turning our attention to BCE texts (of the period of Caraka, Suśruta) it is found the Buddhist Śārdūla-karṇāvadāna (Ch: *Māsa-parīkṣā*) knows Śarabha as a wild animal that can destroy crops.

In RV (VIII.100.6) the word *śarabhāya* refers to a person. In the YV texts *śarabha* is clearly a wild animal. Sāyaṇa bhāṣya on (KYV) Tai.Sam 4-2-10.4:

explains *śarabha* as a wild animal more powerful than lion. The word seems to appear more in the Śukla YV texts than in the KYV texts (*available to me*). The Kāṇva-samhitā mantra (14.5.5) very similar to the one in Tai.sam is

Here also Sāyaṇa’s commentary on *śarabha* is similar;

![Inline image 5](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/6d4fcbad128c6/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

there is no indication of eight legs.

The Vājasaneya Samhitā text (13.51) is almost same as the one in the Kāṇva above. However, Mahīdhara in his commentary adds ‘aṣṭāpado’ as a description of the animal.

Further by ‘*mṛga-viśeṣaḥ*’ he seems to take it as not identified and hence special.

  

\[*Here, I very much like to add the commentary of Sāyaṇa on the above VS text for sake of comparison. But unfortunately my copy of this rare published text is with a member who borrowed it two years back and is unwilling to return it even after several reminders.*\]

  

A clearer picture of of *śarabha* appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (I.2.3 and VII.5.2) and the Sāyaṇa-bhāṣya.

As far as I know the only indologist to have discussed the above concepts of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in detail is Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati (Prof. Satya Prakash; Univ.of Allahabad, in his *pūrvāśrama*) in his monumental (not well known) book The Critical and Cultural Study of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (Publ. V.G.Hansanand, Delhi, 2003).Here, there are deep philosophical concepts touching upon the Vedic world view on the Origin of Species. In any case clear one to one similarity and correspondence between the domestic (*cow, horse, sheep, goat)* and the wild (*gavaya, gaura*, *uṣṭra,**śarabha)* respectively are brought out. There is a hint that *man* evolved out of *mayu (kimpuruṣa).*I do not like to digress further.

  

In conclusion, with belief in *upamāna pramāṇa*following Annam-bhaṭṭa, we can say, not only *go-sadṛśo gavayaḥ* but also *aśva-sadṛśo gauraḥ* & *aja-sadṛśo śarabhaḥ* \|\|
