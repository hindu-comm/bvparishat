Ghanda Bherunda narasimha dhyana from atharvana rahasya is quoted by the karnataka kingSri Krishna Raja Kamteerava. Akasha bhairava kalpa doesnt give upasana of ghanda bherunda but the opposite of it that is sharabha with which the ghanda bherunda fought. Hence both are not same. Also teh sahasranama or ashotttara in akasha bhairava kalpa doesnt mention this name for sharaba at all.
