Namaste,  
  

To my knowledge, the pauranic story says that the powerful Narasimha could be controlled only by Prahlada. Seeing Prahlada approaching him,
the mighty Narasimha became pleased and affectionately took Prahlada on his lap. The Ganda-Bherunda as a royal insignia, may just be symbolic and may mean a powerful king with an affectionate prince having
control over him (the king), or in fact it may refer to the dynasty of powerful and benevolent kings.   
  

Regards,  

skb
