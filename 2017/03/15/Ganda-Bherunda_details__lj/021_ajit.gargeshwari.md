The arms has a red shield charged with a white two-headed bird, Gandaberunda bordered in blue.Gandaberunda is the official emblem of Karnataka state government.It was the royal insignia of erstwhile Mysore kingdom. The rulers including the current Yuvaraja also wears a pendent of the headed bird "eradu paksi" From the books of Nanjaraje Urs P.V.
"Gandaberunda was first used as a sign on coins in Vijayanagar mints, many of coins which still exists. Since then, the tradition passed on to generations. In mid 16th century, history has it that Yaduraya embarked on a Vijaya Yathra across the Mysore State to consolidate their rank. During the Yathra, an ascetic encountered and gave him a red cloth. The King offered pooja to it and accepted it as a blessing. He won all acclaim thereafter." Following his stature raising to new heights, he announced red cloth as Rajdhwaja or State flag. To add the principles of dharma and sathya, the flag got a slogan as "Sathymevodhbhavaramyaham" with imaginary bird Gandaberunda. The bird was surrounded by elephant headed lion on two sides and a lion carrying Mahishasura’s head on the top."
