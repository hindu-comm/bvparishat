Thank you, Śrī Kannan, for this reference to the article on the Gaṇḍa-bheruṇḍa by Valentina Stache-Rosen in the Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society. Apparently the other article on this that you remembered seeing there is the one by S. Srikanta Sastri that Śrī Gargeshwari gave a link to. At this other link it is said to come from the Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society, although it does not say what year:

Thank you, Śrī Iyengar, for clarifying that the word Gaṇḍa is an old Kannada prefix meaning 'strong/masculine/fearsome,' and that it was used as an honorific for kings. That explains why it does not seem to be found in Sanskrit texts.

  

Regarding the reference to the word Bhāruṇḍeya in the Baudhāyana-śrauta-pravara, I forgot to add the location given in the Vedic Word-Concordance: 17:7. I have now found this in W. Caland’s edition of the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, volume 3, 1913, p. 429. It occurs in a list of names, and seems to be used in the same meaning as is found in the Dharma-sūtras; that is, it does not refer to a bird.

  

The Pāramātmikā-upaniṣad is a large text, and a search in the online edition did not yield the word Bheruṇḍa/Bhāruṇḍa (<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/vaisn/vaimp_cu.htm>, section 7.2). I would be glad to have the location reference for this story in this text. Perhaps a printed edition was used, and a page number can be given (Un-published Upanishads, Adyar Library, 1933, pp. 86-207; photographically reprinted in Upanisat-samgrahah, ed. J. L. Shastri, 1970, part 2, pp. 86-207).

  

The śarabha is also of interest to me. In the Śiva-purāṇa, Śarabha kills Narasiṃha (3. Śatarudra-saṃhitā, 12th adhyāya), and likewise in the Liṅga-purāṇa (1. pūrva-bhāga, 96th adhyāya). I have not yet been able to find a reference in the purāṇas to Bheruṇḍa in his fight with Śarabha.

  

Best regards,
