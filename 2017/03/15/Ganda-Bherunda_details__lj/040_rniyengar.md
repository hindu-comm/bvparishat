Dear Scholars,

It is not always easy to identify the flora and fauna mentioned in ancient texts in terms of modern names. In some cases, it is possible the nomenclature remained but the precise description was forgotten. This might have given rise to artistic and poetic imaginations which in time became symbols of power and hence remained effective as signs popularly understood for evoking special sentiments (or *Rasa*). Over time verbal and mental repetitions perhaps infused reality into otherwise imaginary figures.



In the case of Śarabha my first impulse was to refer to the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma since Śarabha is an epithet of Viṣṇu (No. 358). But the commentaries do not relate this to the eight-footed animal but go towards the derivation of the word as *Śṛṇāti iti śarabhaḥ*. This is also the explanation by Kṣīrasvāmin for the word in the Amara-kośa, where it is listed with wild animals (II.5.11). Quite interestingly,
Artha-śāstra ( II.30.35) knows this animal but sadly enough does not describe its features. Instead *śarabha-krīdita* and *śarabha-pluta* are among the 16 types of movements of horses supposedly well known to the horse trainers.



*Śarabha* as an animal is known to the Vedas, but it is not clear whether it was considered to be eight legged in the most ancient period also. Macdonell and Keith list the name in their Vedic Index, with the comment: “ In the classical literature it is a fabulous, eight-legged beast, dwelling in the snowy mountains, a foe of lions and elephants : the commentator Mahīdhara sees this sense, but without reason, in the Vājasaneyī Sarnhitā”. Mahīdhara lived in the 16^(th) Century and hence before one goes to the Vedic texts and commentaries it is necessary to sift through ‘classical literature’ as distinct from Vedic. In the Purāṇas the name appears as already pointed out by others in this thread. Vettam Maṇi in his encyclopaedia covers this under the genealogy of a person of this name, which does not help us in the present context. Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa refers to *śarabha* in several places (I.Ch 8; II Ch 7) while describing Creation out of Brahma’s body. But this is just a list of wild animals, or group names of such animals. In (II.Ch26) it is an animal that could be hunted along with lions and boars (story of Kārtavīrya of Haihaya country) in the Vindhya Mountains;

There are a few more such verses but nowhere *eight legs* are mentioned. The Br.Pu text with me is a southern version with only two parts. The online version from *Sansknet.org* has three parts the last one being mainly *Lalitopākhyāna* or connected closely with Devī-upāsana. My hunch is, the second and then the third part are later additions. The first part of Br.Pu is of considerable historical interest, since it maintains the Ṛgvedic number 3339 precisely with a valid astronomical explanation. Without digressing textual criticism, it is found the third part of Br.Pu (Online Sansknet version) surprisingly refers to *Bheruṇḍā* also. But *śarabha* and *bheruṇḍa* appear as vehicles for divine entities in the fight against Bhaṇḍāsura

The other famous literature of the classical period namely, the Bṛhatsamhitā does not cite *śarabha.* However the Bṛhajjātaka in (Ch. 27.6); *Dreṣkāṇa-svarūpa* (anthropomorphic form of 1/3^(rd) part of a Rāśi or 10 degrees of the zodiac) as *dvipa-sama-kāyaḥ pāṇḍura-damṣṭraḥ* **śarabha-sama-aṅgrhiḥ**….. Clearly an animal is referred but beyond that I am unable to infer anything. It is the Vaijayantī-kośa of Yādava-prakāśa (11^(th) Cent.) that gives *śarabh*a as eight-legged and also as enemy of the elephant but not of the lion. Still *utpāda* is the mystery; by symmetry one may have to assume that four legs were above.

The word (sound-wise) nearest to *śarabha* is *śalabha* (locust, moth, grasshopper...octopod?). Incidentally some species of *śalabha* can have eight legs like a spider and also can fly. But the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa clearly discriminates the two
