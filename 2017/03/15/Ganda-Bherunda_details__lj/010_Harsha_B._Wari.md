Dear scholars,

  

Pranam,

  

I am overwhelmed by the replies. Extremely grateful to all. I am hunting for the text of the journal of mythic society 1974 that Sri kannan Ji mentioned.

  

My computer has stopped working and it will take me some time to give the exact page nos in paramatmika upanishad. Thank you David Ji.

  

Atharva veda mantra section would be a good discovery. But cannot find it online.

  

Aspiring to serve,

  

Om Tat Sat

Bharat Chandra Dasa (Harsha B. Wari)
