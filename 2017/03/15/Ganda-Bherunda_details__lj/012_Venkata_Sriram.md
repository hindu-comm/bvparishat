Thank you Ajit Ji. That's a beautiful article by Srikanta Sastriji. 
Interesting observation of mine is that when Vishnu as Narasimha became uncontrollable then Shiva as Sharabha subdued Narasimha; and when Sharabha became uncontrollable, then Vishnu assumed the form of Gandabherunda and subdued Shiva.

  

These concepts might have evolved during the those times when Shaivas and Vaishnavas were not getting along with each other. 

  

regs,

sriram
