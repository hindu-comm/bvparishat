Dear scholars,

  

Wonderful to note the various responses. With another thread titled "Sharabha" going on and with latest post by Sri Pradyumna Acharyaji, it seems that Ganda Bherunda and Sharbha not only signified a puranic occurrence (for which more research is required) but they were actually living species that now seems to be extinct!
