Dear Scholars,  
  

It seems that we have not yet found a description of Bheruṇḍa in any available purāṇa. Even the description of Śarabha has so far been found in only two or possibly three available purāṇas. The Skanda-purāṇa verses that Prof. Iyengar found quoted in Nāganātha’s Vīramāheśvarācāra-saṅgraham are not found in the Veṅkaṭeśvara Steam Press edition of the Skanda-purāṇa according to a search of the ślokānukramaṇī in the Nag Publishers 8-volume reprint. I could not even find the Kālikā-khaṇḍa in that edition. However, a new edition of the Skanda-purāṇa based on older manuscripts is underway (<http://hum.leiden.edu/lias/skandapurana-project/>).

  

The same three verses that Nāganātha quoted from the Skanda-purāṇa (but not the fourth half-verse) are found in the available Śiva-purāṇa and Liṅga-purāṇa. They have some variant readings, the most significant of which is the reading saṃhāra-rūpeṇa instead of śarabha-rūpeṇa. For ease of comparison I will copy the three and half verses found by Prof. Iyengar, said to be from the Skanda-purāṇa, and then follow with the quotations from the Śiva-purāṇa and Liṅga-purāṇa.

Śiva-purāṇa, Veṅkaṭeśvara Steam Press edition, Nag Publishers reprint, 3. Śatarudra-saṃhitā, adhyāya 12, ślokas 7-9:

Liṅga-purāṇa, Veṅkaṭeśvara Steam Press edition, Motilal Banarsidass reprint, 1. pūrva-bhāga, adhyāya 96, ślokas 65cd-68ab:

In the shared three verses, Śarabha has four legs. The Śiva and Liṅga purāṇas then move on, making no mention of the four upper legs. Yet, tradition is very clear that Śarabha has eight legs. Even the Buddhist Kālacakra-tantra from the tenth century C.E. refers to Śarabha as “aṣṭapāda” (chapter 4, verse 41). So we may hopefully find more old references indicating this. By the way, I very much enjoyed Prof. Iyengar’s anecdote from his boyhood days at a Sanskrit pāṭhaśālā, hearing about the eight-legged Śarabha and concluding that it must be a dinosaur.  

  

Just as the tradition about Śarabha having eight legs is old, even though we have only one unverified purāṇa reference to it, so the tradition about Bheruṇḍa overcoming Śarabha is old. The article by Śrīmatī Jyotsna Kamat that Śrī Jayadeva Bhat kindly called attention to, “Gandaberunda—The Two Headed Bird,” refers to an old sculpture that depicts this. She there writes:

  

“In Karnataka, Gandabherunda is carved in the scene of ‘chain of destruction’, in the Chennakeshava temple of Belur (1113 C.E). A deer becomes prey to a big python, which in turn is lifted by an elephant. A lion attacks the elephant and the lion itself is devoured by Sharabha. Finally it is Gandabherunda which finishes off Sharabha.”

  

So we may hopefully find some old references to the Bheruṇḍa fight with Śarabha. The available Narasiṃha-purāṇa can now be searched in an online digital edition (<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gret_utf.htm#NarsiP>). It makes no reference to Bheruṇḍa or Bhāruṇḍa, and even makes no reference to Śarabha. Yet, another and probably older version of this purāṇa did refer to Śarabha, as seen in the quotation of it given in the commentary on the Pāramātmikā-upaniṣad, found by Śrī Harsha Wari. Deborah Soifer in her 1991 book, The Myths of Narasiṃha and Vāmana, studied eighteen versions of the Narasiṃha myth from the various purāṇas and the Mahābhārata. Only two of these included Śarabha, the Śiva and Liṅga purāṇas quoted above. None of these included Bheruṇḍa.
