Dear Harsha Wari,  
  

Thank you very much for sending screenshots with the relevant pages from the Pāramātmikā-upaniṣad and its commentary quoting the purāṇa passages in question. R. C. Hazra in his extensive studies of the purāṇas found that only seven or eight of even the eighteen mahāpurāṇas now extant match their descriptions and quotations found in the early writings. I have not checked what he says about the Narasiṃha-upapurāṇa, but probably we here have another case where an early quotation is no longer found in the now extant purāṇa of that name.  
  

Best regards,
