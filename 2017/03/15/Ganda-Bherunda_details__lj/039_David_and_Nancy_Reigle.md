Dear Dr. Ramanujan,  
  

This is a helpful reference, because the Purva Mimamsa Jaimini Sutras are very old. I wonder if the three chapters having eight quarters each are called Sharabhadhyayas even in old manuscripts, or perhaps in the old Shabara-bhashya. I was not yet able to find them in the editions I have.  
  

Thanks and best regards,
