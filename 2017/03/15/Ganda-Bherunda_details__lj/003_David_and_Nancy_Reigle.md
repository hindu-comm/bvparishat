Dear Harsha Wari,  
  

According to the monumental 16-volume Vedic Word-Concordance prepared by Vishva Bandhu and his helpers, the word Bheruṇḍa or its variant Bhāruṇḍa is not found in the Saṃhitās, Brāhmaṇas, or Upaniṣads. In the Vedāṅgas, Bhāruṇḍa is found three times: in Vāsiṣṭha-dharma-sūtra 28.12, in Viṣṇu-dharma-sūtra 56.13, and in Śaṅkha-likhita-dharma-sūtra 105. I was able to check the first two of these, and Bhāruṇḍa is there found as the name of a sāman that is used for purification, not as the name of a bird. The word Bhāruṇḍeya is found once, in the Baudhāyana-śrauta-pravara. I was not able to check this text.  

  

Outside of the Vedic literature, a list of occurrences is given by K. N. Dave in his valuable 1985 book, Birds in Sanskrit Literature, p. 397. He also adds the variant spelling Bhāraṇḍa. You of course already know of the famous story of the Bhāruṇḍa in the Pañcatantra.

  

Interestingly, the Bheruṇḍa bird is also mentioned in the Buddhist Kālacakra-tantra, chapter 4, verse 41, where it serves as the mount for one of the deities in the body maṇḍala. The Vimalaprabhā commentary thereon does not gloss this word. Moreover, although even names are almost always translated into Tibetan in the Tibetan translations of Buddhist texts, this word is only transliterated into Tibetan letters, not translated.  

  

So far I have not found the compound term Gaṇḍa-bheruṇḍa in Sanskrit texts, but only Bheruṇḍa and its variants. I would be glad for a reference to this. Also, I was not able to find the reference to the Bheruṇḍa that you mentioned in the Pāramātmikā-upaniṣad.

  

Best regards,
