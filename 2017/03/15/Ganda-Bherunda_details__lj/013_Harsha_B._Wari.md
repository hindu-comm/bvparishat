Dear Sirs,

  

Pranam,

  

Below is the screenshots of the Paramatmika Upanishad providing the description about Sharabha and reference to Narasimha purana 37th chapter (page 121-123).

  

It is true that there is no mention of Ganda-bherunda there but instead just "Lord Narasimha".

  

ys, BCD
