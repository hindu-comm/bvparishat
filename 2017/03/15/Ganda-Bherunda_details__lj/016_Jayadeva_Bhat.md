Dear Sir,  

I have requested for membership a months ago. I was going through the mail. I am not a learned person. However I got a link to "Kamat's Potpourri: by Mrs. Jyotsna Kamat, Ph.D

Please excuse me if you feel I am interfering.  

"Gandaberunda- The Two Headed Bird

The mystical bird of [Gandabherunda](http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/prani/ganda.htm) is featured in the emblem of the state of [Karnataka](http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/kar/index.htm). The compound name is made of *ganda*,the mighty, and *bherunda* meaning "two headed".

Its origin has been traced in hoary past in different ancient civilizations, more than 4,000 years back. The concept of two headed bird existed among Hittites, Egyptians and Sumerians as well as Hindus. The first human beings pondered over the regular movement of the Sun, tree of life and big birds soaring high in the sky all the time. This idea developed perhaps, into a celestial bird, watching in all directions.

In Egypt and Assyria it was associated with a fertility cult. It traveled through trading tribes to different regions of the then known world.

Vedic India had its concept of two birds moving eternally. [Garuda](http://www.kamat.com/glossary/?whoID=254) in later times, received a divine stature as vehicle of Vishnu, with mythological significance. These two must have been behind the concept of mighty Gandabherunda.

In Indian subcontinent, the sculpture of this mythical bird found in Taxila (a.k.a. Taxasila) is the oldest.

**The Legend of Gandabherunda**

Lord Vishnu assumed *avatar* of [Narasimha](http://www.kamat.com/indica/faiths/gods/narasimha.htm) (half man-half beast) to slay demon [Hiranyakashipu](http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/mythology/16066.htm). But this avatar became so omnipotent that the benevolent gods began to fear of total destruction. Hence they prayed [Lord Shiva](http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/hindu/shiva.htm). Shiva then assumed the form of Sharabha, (a mythical bird) and tamed Narasimha. (man-lion). Vishnu then transformed himself into Gandabherunda and faced Sharabha. Gandabherunda thus came to be known as symbol of immense power. Later this mighty mythical bird was adopted as an emblem by several rulers."
