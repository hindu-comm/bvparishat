***Contribution of Sanskrit to Cultural Advancement in Japan***

**Prof. Dr. Shashibala**

Dean, Centre of Indology, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Delhi Kendra,

**Sanskrit became a medium of transcendental values and cultural advancement in Japan. Entry of Sanskrit scriptures into Japan in AD 552 became their identification with the central axis of human advance. Japanese emperors longing for transcendental values embraced the tradition of sutras written in Sanskrit as a core for national unity and integrity. Buddhism began to unroll unfathomed spheres of thought. Sanskrit was recognized as a divine language in which were written the sacred words of the Buddha which could lead to enlightenment. A host of secular technologies accompanied the new Buddhist order: writing, administration, weaving, metallurgy, calendar and architecture etc.**

**Upto the day a rich literary treasure of Sanskrit texts consisting of *dhārani*s, *tantra*s, *sutra*s and other texts has been kept in Japan for nearly 1400 years. Philosophical speculations opened up new avenues and horizons. The idea of *bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya* overwhelmed the minds to such an extent that the great Japanese Prince Shōtoku Taishi decided to carve out the first constitution of Japan, known as Seventeen Article Constitution based on the Indian ideals. A Sanskrit manuscript of Usnīsavijayā-dhāranī was taken from India for consecration of the constitution. Hōryuji monastery still yields the manuscript written in Gupta script. With the coming of a new political system conditioned by values the country began to emerge out of a clan to a state system. **

**History of literature in Japan begis with****Prince Shōtoku Taishi who wrote commentaries and lectured on Saddharmapundarīka-sutra, Srīmālā-devī-simhanāda-sutra and Vimala-kīrti-nirdesa-sutra. These gave birth to Japanese literature. The sutras can be heard in daily recitation of the Japanese up to the day. The second milestone in the history of Japan as a state stands during the reign of Emperor Shōmu who used Sanskrit sutras as a core to create a unified country and himself became a supreme monarch. During mid eighth century he dispatched Sanskrit sutras to all the provinces and ordered for their recitation on fixed days and time.**

**The system of education saw a phase of democratization in the ninth century with creation of Sanskrit based alphabet invented by the monk scholar Kobo Daishi. To achieve this historic democratization, he created Japanese Kana syllabary of fifty sounds: *a i u e o, ka ki ku ke ko,* etc. It was to spread education to the common man. The new syllabary was a revolutionary step in Japan's civilization; what was hitherto the prerogative of the predestined few, became the potential privilege of all. The entire alphabet was woven into a poem wherein every syllable occurred once. This poem is called Iroha. It is based on the Mahāparinirvāna-sutra.**

**The great monk Jiun Sonja, the last of the Sanskritists of Japan in the traditional style lived from AD 1718 to 1803. A saint of great learning and noble virtues, he stands unique in the history of Mantrayana as the doyen of traditional Sanskrit studies in Japan, and in recognition thereof he was given the honorific title ‘Sonja’ which means ‘*arya*’ or ‘*arhat*”. Nobody else in Japan was given this honor. **

**Flourishing of paper and printing industry owe credit to copying Sanskrit mantras for mass distribution. The earliest surviving example of printed matter in Japan is ‘Hyamanto darani’- Million Pagoda dharani’, produced between 764 and 770 by the order of Empress Shotoku as thanksgiving for the defeat of a rebellion. Emperor Shomu (701-56) strongly promoted copying the entire Buddhist Tripitaka. Thus sutra copying became a major industry in Japan. Wooden tablets called sotōbas written in Siddham letters are often found in cemeteries. **

**After Mantrayana Sanskrit scriptures laid foundations of Zen Buddhist sect in Japan which has permeated deeply into the Japanese cultural life. Other Buddhist sects based on the philosophy of Saddharmapundarika-sutra have large followings in Japan and outside. They play an important role in develpment of different forms of arts and architecture, and molding the behavior of the Japanese people.Calligraphy became a unique form of art developed by the Japanese Sanskritist-artists.**
