Dear Collegues,

  

A Festschrift(संस्मृतिग्रन्थ) in honour of Prof. Shri Narayan Mishra, the reputed scholar from Mithila, who passed away in Banaras in 2013, is going to be edited by prof. Krishnakant Sharma, Dr. Shyamananda Mishra and Dr. Dharmadatta Chaturvedi.

  

Scholars that personally knew him or his work are invited to submitted papers. I am attaching here the call for papers.

Papers can be submitted till April 2017 in any of these languages:

  

Sanskrit, Hindi, English, Maithili, Assamese, Bangla, Bhojpuri...

  

Please get in touch with Dr. Shyamanda Mishra ([snmis...@gmail.com]())for further information.

  

  

Best Regards

  

Oscar Pujol
