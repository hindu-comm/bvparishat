The lawsuit, filed by California Parents for the Equalization of Educational Materials (CAPEEM) and several parents,

alleges that the state's history-social science standards for kindergarten through 12th grade negatively portray

Hinduism — such as emphasizing its ties to the caste system — while endorsing the positive aspects of other

religions, including Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. The non-profit group says this is unconstitutional and

violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  

  

In 2016, there were efforts by many academics (indology,"south asian") to prevent changes.

  

10 years ago - a concerted effort was made by Witzel, Madhav Deshpande etc to prevent the changes requested by Hindu parents.   

It is also fascinating to note that the academic opposition was only against the Hindu tradition. There was no opposition to other

religious traditions. This should inform the people of this list on the nature of Indology and 'South Asia' studies.

  

Kudos to the efforts of Prof. Kannan in pulling together the "Swadeshi Indology" series.

This is an important milestone in Indian intellectual rejuvenation.
