\>So if a chair is established in the name of tradition at a western university, there is statistically a greater likelihood of educated middle class Hindu people looking to the chair (which churns out material in English, that the educated middle class can understand) as the source of knowledge rather than an obscure maTha.

  

  

Can you be clearer Sri Kalyanji ?

  

Do you mean,

  

that is the reason why, I think / I am sure, Sringeri Math wanted to establish the chair at Columbia ?

  

or,
