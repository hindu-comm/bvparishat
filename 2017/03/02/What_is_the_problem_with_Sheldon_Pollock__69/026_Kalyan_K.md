Sri Vidyasankar. The issue as I understood so far is not necessarily about whether an advaitic maTha would hand over control to a Western university. It may not, as you suggest. But let us think practically. How many educated middle class Hindu people know about Sringeri? Very few. How many educated middle class Hindu people know about Western universities? Plenty.Let us accept the fact that for most of the educated middle class Indians, Sringeri is an obscure maTha, while a western university means prestige and authority. So if a chair is established in the name of tradition at a western university, there is statistically a greater likelihood of educated middle class Hindu people looking to the chair (which churns out material in English, that the educated middle class can understand) as the source of knowledge rather than an obscure maTha.
