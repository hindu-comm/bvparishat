Nagaraj-ji. This is the reason why I believe Sri Rajiv Malhotra is right in being apprehensive about the matter and this is the reason why I think Sri Vidyasankar is off the point. It connects to the theme of the thread because, I have been asked by Sri Kannan to read the book by Sri Malhotra (which I am doing currently). Hope that clarifies.
