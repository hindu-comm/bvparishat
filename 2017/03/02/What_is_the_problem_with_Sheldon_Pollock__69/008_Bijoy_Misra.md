Dear friends,

This kind of argument is unfortunate. You have to distinguish between what time a phone call was made versus if Ramayana

was a commissioned composition (my phrase). It is possible that some may have difference of opinion with Mr Malhotra and

his processing of information, but personally I have felt that he and his associates are doing an extremely timely service to India

and India's traditions. I would request all to be kind to the efforts, and only complain if you notice insincerity to the cause.

Pollock and some such people are the new colonialists and they have to be repelled with all energy that India can muster.

Intellectual slavery could be more dangerous than the occupation. . 

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
