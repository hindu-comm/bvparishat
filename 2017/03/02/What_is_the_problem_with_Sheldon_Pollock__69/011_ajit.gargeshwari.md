Intellectual independence doesn't mean just accepting what one camp says and keep accepting a view as 'The View' or the best view on a given issue. It also doesn't mean accepting whatever a person or group says in Toto and verbatim and say there can be no scope for a different view, either be on my side or you are anti Sanskrit anti Indian culture and so on. Multiplicity of views on given topic needs to be tolerated if not accommodated. That is when learning increases and vision broadens.

  

One can understand the insecurity a minority population feels in a foreign land. That will be resolved by the minority population of that land. Has that dramatically changed how Sanskrit, India historical and cultural studies are done in India is the question that one needs to ask. There might have be an impact, but the impact is not as bad as it is being portrayed. There are still a large number of good Sanskrit and India studies that are being conducted in India by those who don't associate themselves with any one camp but talks to both camps or don't talk to either of these two camps.

  

If Indian scholars have lost one funding it should be fine. Plenty of more funding will come by. One can always learn and prevent future fund diversion. If personal funds gets diverted it the persons choice. If tax payers money are getting diverted that is a different matter. There is no shortage of funds in India and India is not such a poor or insignificant country that it was reduced during colonial rule. There is plenty of talent here. Our traditional scholars and mathas are also store houses of knowledge. They are well aware of whats going on around them but what they do is left to their immediate focus, wisdom and long term vision they have. My priority may not be the other persons priority.

  

This is not a justification for typo and grammatical errors.Its easy to poke fun and make sarcastic remarks as its made often. One can be patient and correct or ignore typos.One can easily make quips and take jibes by saying you don't use spell check, you are in a hurry to post and hence will not read your message. Another option would be to correct if a view is wrong or is taken with insufficient information. If a different view is taken with sufficient information then it is another view. Scholars are always teachers first and arguers second. One can always learn from scholars and teachers. Learning is never ending and for me personally I learn new things everyday thanks to all scholars who post here.
