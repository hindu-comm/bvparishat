The thread started as a response to the other thread on SI-2 conference. The member wanted to know why SI-2 focused on Prof. Pollock.

  

Prof. Kannan aptly responded by suggesting to read the book TBFS. It is apt because the context of SI series and the book have the same roots and motivations.

  

Members could say

  

1\. That is not the only source problematizing Prof. Pollock's writings. You might want to read these other sources too etc.

  

or

  

2\. There is no problem with Prof. Pollock at all etc.,

  

or

  

3\. Please read the following counters to the arguments of TBFS, establishing that there is no problem with Prof. Pollock etc.

  

If there are no such relevant additions to be made, the thread may be closed.
