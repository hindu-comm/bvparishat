Dear Prof. Kannan

  

Thanks for sharing the link to the website, which I think you had also shared during announcement of SI-2 in [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/2BvJQ1Zpy1E/bIwq3wIGDgAJ). Good to know that the pre-print papers are available now. I remember earlier that the page had a message like Coming soon .. (as confirmed by its [capture](http://web.archive.org/web/20160814050748/http://swadeshiindology.com/si-1/papers/) on [archive.org](http://archive.org)) and I may have missed an announcement that the SI-1 papers have been uploaded on the site. Please do let us know when the proofreading/editing is complete.

  

Thanks again.
