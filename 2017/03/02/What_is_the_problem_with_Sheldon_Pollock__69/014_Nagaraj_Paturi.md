Come on, Dr Gargeshwari, the book TBFS and the question of problem with Sheldon Pollock are not at all analogous to Western Philosophy and Eastern Philodsophy.

  

"It like saying when I ask'what is the problem with Sri Rajiv Malhotra? I get an answer read Prof. Pollock's and his writings" is another bad analogy.If it was advised to read all books of Sri Rajiv Malhotra or some book of Sri Malhotra not connected to Prof. Pollock, the analogy would have been right.

  

But the book TBFS is directly related to the question of what is the problem with Sheldon Pollock. It in fact is focused on that very question.

  

So your analogies are totally misplaced and wrong.

  

You could have said there are so many other articles and books (if there are) dealing with the question of what is the problem with Sheldon Pollock ; why recommend only the book TBFS ?
