One lines of (1) Let me add reading original works on both sides with an unbiased mind and reading less of blogs and secondary literature will give the best picture. One should know the context as well.  
  
I want to buy a product  
  
From the buyers perspective: Before one purchases a product it will be a good idea to read technical manuals of the product and its competitor products rather making decisions by seeing the advertisements and wranglings both the product companies have shown. Reading technical manuals may not be enough at times one will have to verify the claims and methodologies on how such technologies are developed before one buys a product.  
  
From the sellers perspective: I don't want to develop products myself but will keep criticizing a product is an option. If one doesn't buy my product I will ensure that my competitor never develops a product is another option. If my competitor develops products in spite of my opposition I will throw all possible spikes is yet another option. I will allow competition to thrive is another option and so on...
