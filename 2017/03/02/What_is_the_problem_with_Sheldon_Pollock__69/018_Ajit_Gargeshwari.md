Allow me to add this paragraph. I know its off topic and one might say violates posting rules yet I thought I must. Now we might have more conferences in line with 'Make in India Campaign' being promoted by the government. I must frankly admit I have been a great learner. This debates of these will be like schools within vedanta having a polemical hair splitting debate which are running from centuries and who knows this debate might run for another century. Polemics had its own politics as well. AIT is now more than 160 years old. (could be wrong with figures here). Long live endless debates. 

  

Conferences and debates might be required for non humanities areas as well as one finds hydroplanes,space ships quantum mechanics and what not in vedic mantras.
