The reason for this is when the question 'What is the problem with Sheldon Pollock ?' was asked the answer given was read read 'Battle of Sanskrit' by Rajiv Malhotra.

It like saying when I ask'what is the problem with Sri Rajiv Malhotra? I get an answer read Prof. Pollock's and his writings.Let me give another analogy What is the problem with Western Philosophy the answer would be Please read Eastern Philosophy.
