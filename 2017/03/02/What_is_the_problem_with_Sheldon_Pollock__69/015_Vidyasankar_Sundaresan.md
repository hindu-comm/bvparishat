Firstly, I thank Sri Nityanand Misra for drawing attention to the earlier discussion about this topic on this forum, so I don't have to do it myself now.

  

Secondly, I can see how this issue has become very politically charged, so I'll be brief. I am not an official spokesman for Sringeri, but if anyone thinks for a moment that the Sringeri Peetham, of all the traditional institutions, was going to sell its soul to an American university or to an individual Western Sanskritist, then all I'll say is that they just don't know how the advaita sampradAya maTha-s operate. As for the chair at Columbia, if it had been established, we'd have all heard of it by now. Contrary to how the introduction in TBFS sets up a dramatic narrative about the story, that chair was nowhere close to being set up in the first place. Discussions to explore an idea are a far cry from high impact decisions being taken. And now that it became too controversial, there has been and can be no further movement along those lines.

  

Indeed, the more typically gratuitous complaint about Sringeri that I often get to hear is that decisions are NOT taken quickly and that things happen at a glacial pace, in comparison with other advaita tradition institutions that seem a lot more dynamic. I think it would be useful to remember that Sringeri Peetham's functioning is utterly unlike a corporate environment, where time is money and everybody is looking for a quick return on investment.

  

Thirdly, returning to what is the problem with Sheldon Pollock, there are many, but I wish members of this list and those who organized and attended the Swadeshi Indology conference can find ways to concentrate on the real problems with Sheldon Pollock's views about Sanskrit and Indian history, rather than imaginary ones. It is a quite imaginary issue to think that Pollock would ostensibly gain a perceived right to speak in the Sringeri Peetham's name and that the Sringeri Acharyas and administrators would merrily sit down and let him do so. I also hope that vidvAns will eventually expand their field of vision to look at other issues and scholars as well and not assume that the work is done, now that Pollock's positions have been problematized and analyzed.

  

Please do remember that within two months of the publication of TBFS, another university on the West Coast of the USA actually returned millions of dollars donated by Indian groups, earmarked for the study of Hindu, Jaina and Sikh traditions, even after a letter of final approval was issued from the University of California's president's office. The possibility of constructive engagement of any of our traditions with American academia has been effectively postponed, indefinitely. Whether it has been completely cancelled through the conceivable future remains to be seen. The more contemporary Indian institutions of higher education need to step up and demonstrate that they can indeed produce and sustain academic scholarship on India at a high level. In the meantime, the Sringeris and Melkotes and Udupis and Brindavans of India will keep producing their traditionally trained Panditas and Swamis, as they have been doing for centuries now.   

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
