You are right in a sense Dr. Veppatangudi. The concentration has been in promoting a book and a view of an individual what he says in blogs and elsewhere, rather than real issues that are raised or portrayed in the book itself. We are also having a set of people outside the list who want to promote an individual rather than issues he raises. There is also a side track to this discussion dragging mutts into needless controversies by people who have no clue what Sringeri Mutt is doing or how funding for US universities happen. Some simply write what pleases them.
