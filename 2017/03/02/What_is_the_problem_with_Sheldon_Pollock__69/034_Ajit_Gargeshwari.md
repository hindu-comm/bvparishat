I mus again thank Prof Paturi for having given me and all a fair chance to write and discuss. This has been my stance individual or a book should become become bigger than the cause and individual involved in activism should learn to take everyone along. Sanskrit Scholars are so few why cannot every one speak with one voice. Appreciate good work done in the west and also done is India. Even if all Western scholars are included our number is still a handful why be divided? Let us express difference in scholarly papers and books but differences when it comes to larger issues which will help sustain research and scholarship will not help. An outsider has his own place in a formal system and an insider knows how to get a job done.
