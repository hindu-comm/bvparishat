Scholars are welcome to visit
*[swadeshiindology.com](http://swadeshiindology.com)* web-site

where all videos and many papers from **SI-1** have been available for weeks.

(This is faster than most conferences being held)

.

The same web site also has had the **SI-2** call for papers and other materials available.

  

SI2 videos should be uploaded by the end of march.

Papers being edited and expected to be loaded in 3 months roughly.

  

The focus has been to work with productive scholars who can/want to pursue new topics

rather than recycle old materials.

  

All those interested in future SI conferences are welcome to stay in touch with me.

  

Regards

KSKannan
