Sri Nityanandji  
  
I have read the post of Sri Vidyasankar and with all due respect to him, I don't find his post very convincing. That's all I want to say, since I don't want to reignite old debates. My interest here is limited to understanding what people have against Sheldon Pollock, and as Sri Ajitji suggested, it would be best to read his works and those of his critics like Sri Rajiv Malhotra.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
