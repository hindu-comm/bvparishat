Tirumalaji,  
  

Namaste.  
  

The search engine now is available at <http://35.166.24.128:8080/searchengine/>  
  

You may search there.  
  
The search engine at the UNiversiry of Hyderabad website is down. It may take some more time to get it started.  
Sorry for the inconvenience. Meanwhile, I have installed the search engine at <http://35.166.24.128:8080/searchengine/>

  

  

Thanks and regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
