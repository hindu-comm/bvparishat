Dear Subbu-ji,

  

Adhyatma Ramayana has been the source of inspiration for many saints and bards of South India. 

  

1\) There is a month in Kerala (Karkidakam Masam) which is dedicated as "Ramayana Month" and devotees chant the "Adhyatma Ramayana" which was composed by a great saint of Kerala Thunchathu Ezhuthachan who belonged to early 14th century. Since then, the tradition of singing adhyatma ramayana is continuing in Kerala.

  

2\) There is a popular set of keertanas in telugu called "adhyaatma ramayana kirtanas" (a set consisting of 62 compositions) by a great telugu poet Sri.Munipalle Subramanya Kavi belonging to early 17th century. It was a practice in earlier days that while searching for alliances among the traditional / orthodox brahmin families, the bride was asked to sing few compositions from "adhyatma ramayana" and depending upon her knowledge and familiarity with these, her "samskaara" was assessed.

  

3\) Saint Tyagaraja was highly influenced by "Adhyatma Ramayana" and some of his kirtanas bear the testimony of his tinge towards this work

  

4\) The great Upanishad Brahmendra Saraswathi was influenced by this work and composed "raama ashtapadi"

  

5\) The great raama bhakta and advaitin Sri.Ramabhadra Dikshitar was influenced by this.

  

6\) The father of Bhajana Sampradaya Sri.Bhagavannama Bodhendra Saraswathi, too was influenced by this and propagated the nAma-siddhAnta and tAraka mantra japa

  

regs,

sriram
