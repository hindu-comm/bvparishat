Namaste

  

In his 'श्रीरामायणतात्पर्यसारसङ्ग्रहस्तोत्रम्’, a short work with an auto-commentary, Sri Appayya Dikshita has cited a few verses from the Adhyātma Ramāyaṇam. Those verses are all found in the Yuddha kāṇḍa of the extant Gita press edition. I would like to know if any earlier work has cited verses from the AR or even mentioned it by name.

  

Thanks and regards
