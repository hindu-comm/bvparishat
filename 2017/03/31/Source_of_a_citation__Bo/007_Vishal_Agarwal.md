Nityanand,

  

This Shruti is not traceable in any existing Vedic scripture, as far as I have searched. This is true of many other Shruti citations in Madhvacharya's works. He clearly had access to many more Vedic scriptures in his times than we have today.

  

Baladeva's commentary's distinct interpretations of the Brahmasutras follow Shri Madhvacharya's interpretations. Therefore, they also quote the same Shrutis (just as later Madhva scholars do)- not directly from the Shruti texts but apparent borrowed from Madhvacharya's works.

  

Vishal

Thanks, so it appears to be a Shruti? If so, what is the source (samhita/brahmana/upanishad)?
