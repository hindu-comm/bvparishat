There you go.

  

I would (I guess everyone would) love to go through this valuable work.[This article](http://iosrjournals.org/iosr-jhss/papers/Vol20-issue9/Version-4/E020944751.pdf)has reference to this book.

  

All the references in the article go to prove that there is a centuries old tradition of vasantotsava in the south.

  

The reference that apparently is not covered in the article is the title of Vasantaraayalu that was held by a Reddy king of the 15th century, whose actual name was Kumaragiri Reddy. A book in Sanskrit by him on Natya, apparently on Ekaharyaka (solo) Natya, called Vasantaraajeeyam is also mentioned.

  

(d) Kumaragiri Reddy (1386-1402)  
  
He was the son of Anapota and had to fight against his cousin, Pedakomati Vema (son of Anavema), for the throne.  
He lost Srisailam (Tripurantaka region) to the Vijayanagara ruler, but kept his control over the other parts of the Kingdom with the help of his brother-in-law, Kataya Vema, who was later appointed as the governor of Rajahmundry -Simhachalam region and who went on to found an independent kingdom there after the death of Kumaragiri.  
When he was attacked from different directions by the Bahmani Sultan, the Vijayanagara ruler and Pedakomati Vema (who occupied the oastal area in Guntur district), he abandoned Kondaveedu and went to Rajahmundry (1402) where he died shortly afterwards.  
Though not a capable general, he was a great scholar and spent most of his time in the company of poets and artists. He was, infact, the author of a comprehensive work on dance and art, known as the "Vasantha Rajiyam".  
He was popularly known as Vasantha Raja 1 for celebrating Vasantotsavam in his court. (<http://wikimapia.org/19970690/Kondavidu>)
