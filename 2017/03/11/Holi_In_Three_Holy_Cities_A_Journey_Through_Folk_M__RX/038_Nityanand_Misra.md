The article is a valuable reference.

  

*Further, on the northern walls, the second row shows more prominently the festivities of holi â€“ mixing the colours in small containers.*(p. 50)

  

*In this panel, dancers are mixing and sprinkling colour on each other.* (p. 50)  

  

*... with a pot of coloured water in hand, which is indicative of the holi festival.* (p. 50)  

  

So it is very likely that Vijayanagara's court did see sprinkling of colour on Vasantotsava/Holi. Any reason why the practice of celebrating with coloured water fell out of vogue in Southern parts of he country later? Or was it restricted to courts of kings and not spread among the masses?
