Dear Nityananda ji

  

The holaakaa mentioned in Sabarabhashya is indeed the Holi that we presently celebrate. How can we be sure? Does Sabarasvamin describe it? No, he does not as description of what should be done on an occasion is the subject of a different Sastra, namely the Dharmasastra. In Dharmasastra, Holikaa is indeed described, for instance in the Nirnayasindhu. I do not recall either bonfire or colours being mentioned there, but it occurs on Phalgunpurnima, so it is the same Holi being talked about. Further, it is heard from elders that the festival mentioned in the said Adhikaranam of Mimamsa is the same festival that we celebrate today.

  

I can't say much about the various snanas described in Ayurveda, not being very familiar with the same.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
