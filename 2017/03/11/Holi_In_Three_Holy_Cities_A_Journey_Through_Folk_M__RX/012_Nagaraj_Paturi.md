In a research dissertation on Thiya community, found[here](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CB4QFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fshodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in%2Fbitstream%2F10603%2F15849%2F17%2F17_chapter%252010.pdf&ei=GrCWVL7fHY6LuwSbgYG4CQ&usg=AFQjCNGaw0Hjw5RKvKLWIVO90XrJ39l3jg&sig2=Gh2CSL08ksXAbA-WFPK5Bg,), it is said:  

  

Pooram is a festival of flowers offered to Kama, the love god of Hinduism. Worship of Kama is an all India phenomenon. It takes different forms in different parts of India. Kalakam plays an important role in the celebration of this festival. Lower level organization like Ara or Mundya also plays an important role in organizing this festival. Pooram is a community festival not only of Tiyas, but of other caste groups also. As we have described in Chapter 8, Kama takes three different forms in North Kerala. Kama is made out of flowers, clay and cowdung. This is a process of parochialization of an all India Sanskritic deity.

Poorakkali is a dance art form of North Kerala related to the celebration of Pooram. There is several myths which relate this dance form to great tradition as described in chapter 8. It is related to Vishnu, Durga, Kama, Parasurama etc. Some of these myths mention the name of Tiya in the mythical narrations. Several communities participate in the dance performance, but Tiyas have a prominent role to play in the organization of the event.

Marathukkali is also conducted during Pooram festival. It is also a performing art in which intellectual activity is given prominence. It is a competitive play in which intellectual discussion takes plays on Hindu mythologies. It can also be described as a process of parochialization in which sanskritic ideas and concepts flow to the little traditions. In this play, intellectual discussions at a very high level are held by the players on competitive basis which are judged by experts in Indology, Sanskrit and Philosophy. In this way Tiyas and others have imbibed the concepts and values mentioned in Hindu mythologies.
