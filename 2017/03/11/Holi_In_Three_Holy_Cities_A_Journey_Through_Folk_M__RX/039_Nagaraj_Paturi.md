\>Any reason why the practice of celebrating with coloured water fell out of vogue in Southern parts of he country later?

  

------- AadaraNIya Nityanandji,

  

That 'the practice of celebrating with coloured water fell out of vogue in Southern parts of he country later' itself is a misimpression and misinformation.

  

You might have noticed that the alternative names used in Kannada included ranginaaTa (rangina =of colors + aaTa = play; playing with colors). In Telugu, the word is rangulaaTa with the same etymological meaning.

  

There is a proverb in Telugu, 'avvanu paTTuku vasantamaaDinatlu' = like playing 'vasantam' with an old woman. vasantam refers to a color which is one of the shades of red in Telugu.
