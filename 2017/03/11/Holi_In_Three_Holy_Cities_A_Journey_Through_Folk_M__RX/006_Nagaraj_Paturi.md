**Kaamana Habba (Festival**)

We observed the festival of Holi in a different manner from the celebrations in north India. It used be called festival of God of love (*Kaamana Habba*in Kannada). There would be a bonfire of the God of Love (*kaama*) during the full moon night in a big field (maidan) where men, women and children would gather in a festive mood. To the cries of delight, we all would dance around the bonfire. Jaggery mixed with puffed rice (*puri*in Kannada) would be distributed to all. It was a grand sight to see the fire leaping into the sky and sparks flying all around when frequently stoked

During the day, bands of youngsters would roam all the streets, singing a hilarious Kannada ditty full of levity, which runs like this:

*Kaamana kattige*

(Kaama's wood piece)

*Bheemas berani*

(dried cow dung cake named Bheema)

*Adike gotu,*

(Dried rounded areca nut)

*Ekkadadetu*

(Beating with slippers)

*Kaamana makkalu*

The children of God of love (Kaama)

*Kalla sule makkalu*

(Those bastard children)

*Enenu kaddar?*

(What did they steal?)

*Soude-Berni kaddaru*

(They stole fire wood and dried dung of cattle)

*Ethakke kaddar*

(Why did they steal?)

*Kaamanna sudukke kaddaru*

(To burn God of love-Kaama)

At the end of the song they would all shout with palms slapping against their mouths.

The real fun for children started during daytime. They would go to every house and ask for firewood. Normally, the householder would give some firewood, or even old damaged chairs etc. If anybody were unwilling to give, the intrepid boys amongst us would scale the high compound stealthily, and steal whatever which was fit for burning, like dried fronds of coconut tree etc. Sometimes, the irate man of the house would chase them out. It was all in good fun.

In the evening, all the firewood collected would be stacked in a pyramid shape. After doing the pooja, the firewood would set on fire to the beating of drums or plates, to the wild cheer of all. Presumably, this burning of Kaama was symbolic of dousing the wild and forbidden desires in people.
