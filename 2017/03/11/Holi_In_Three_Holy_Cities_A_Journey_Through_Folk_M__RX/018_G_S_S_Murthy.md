Thank you Prof.Paturi. I am amazed at your ability to marshall so many blogs/writings to show that Holi has all along been an All India Phenomenon. All that I can say is that it was not celebrated by children in my village and I am right in believing that my village could not have been an island of the region. I am also aware that a cousin from Sagar( Shimoga dist.), as a boy, would talk of this festival and it was all totally alien to us. Possibly it was more prevalent in Northern Karnataka.

Regarding antiquity of "mrudanga" there is no doubt at all. Valmiki says: 

'बिल्वा मार्दन्गिका आसन् शम्याग्राहा बिभीतकाह्" अयो\_९१-४९

"म्रूदन्गम् परिविद्ध्यान्गैह् प्रसुप्ता मत्तलोचना' सु-१०-४२

It is however a moot point to what extent present day mrudang resembles what has been referred to by Valmiki.

Regards,

Murthy
