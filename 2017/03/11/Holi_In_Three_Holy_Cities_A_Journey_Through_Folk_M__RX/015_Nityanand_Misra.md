That reminds me of a joke Prof. D. Krishna Sundar (Production and Operations Management, IIM Bangalore) would crack in his classes in 2006. If I recall correctly, the context was how some divisions in corporate firms (e.g. teams working between business and technology) have a life worse than others: “If you are a tabla, you get beaten on one side. If you are a mridangam, you get beaten on both sides. Better to be a tabla than a mridangam.”
