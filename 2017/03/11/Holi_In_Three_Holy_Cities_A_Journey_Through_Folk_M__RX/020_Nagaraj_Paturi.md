You say that:

All that I can say is that it was not celebrated by children in my village and I am right in believing that my village could not have been an island of the region.  

  

You also say that:

  

I am also aware that a cousin from Sagar( Shimoga dist.), as a boy, would talk of this festival and it was all totally alien to us. Possibly it was more prevalent in Northern Karnataka.  

  

So when you say,

  

"my village could not have been an island of the region",  

  

one should infer that by region you do not mean the entire Karnataka but the region around your village in the Hasan area.

  

Since I showed that it exists in the memories of a person (born 1930) growing up in Mysore, the 'region' you have in mind seems to be exclusive of even Mysore 118.7 km away from Hassan.
