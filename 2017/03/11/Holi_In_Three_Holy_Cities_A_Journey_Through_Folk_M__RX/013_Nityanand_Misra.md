Mridanga (spelt in Prakrit/Awadhi/Braja as मृदंग) is mentioned in even the Ramcharitamanasa of Tulasidasa at several places.

  

1.263.1 झाँझ मृदंग शंख सहनाई। भेरि ढोल दुंदुभी सुहाई॥

1.302 तुरग नचावहिं कुअँर बर अकनि मृदंग निसान।

6.13.7 बाजहिं ताल मृदंग अनूपा। सोइ रव सरिस सुनहु सुरभूपा॥

  

Suradasa's Surasagara also mentions the instrument.

  

I do not know how different this is from the Mridangam in the south. Perhaps experts in music on this list can comment.
