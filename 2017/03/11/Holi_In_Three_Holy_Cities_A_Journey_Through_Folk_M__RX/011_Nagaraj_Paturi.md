On some other list in response to a similar impression that Holi is not a south Indian festival and diffused to that part of India from north India, I wrote:

  

------ I come from South India. Both at my birth place in the borders of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and in Telangana where I live and do cultural research,Holiis celebrated with ahuge collective fervour.



 At both the places, it is called 'kāmuni punnama' (Telugu)/kāmana hunnavi (kannada)(fullmoon day of 'kāma', the god of love ). The narrative memorized, recited or related to the ritual at these places is not the Holika one, but is that of the kāmadahana and resurrection of kāma.During the night previous to the festival, kāmadahana is re-enacted through a conflagration/ fire-ritual. The celebrations on the following festival day are taken as the celebration of the resurrection of kāma. In my place of birth, the funeral procession of kāma's death and the wailing by rati, the wife of kāma is also re-enacted with the participants of the procession all male, one in a femalewidow's costume and the remaining in a white male attire enact the wailing paradoxicallyto a fun comic effect merging the mood into the revelling mood of the festival. The procession with the 'corpse' is taken from door to door and the group uses the wailing sounds to'blackmail' the male friend to join the group.Huge processionsofbullock-carts carrying holy colour liquid, inaugurated by the top government officials, travel through all the big streets of the town with a din of drum beats. Though the place technically falls under Andhra Pradesh, songs sung are all Kannada.



 In Telangana , the kāma dahana myth-ritual relation is not so explicitthough the word kāma is used throughout the festival vocabulary. The conflagration fire-ritualduring the previous night does not carry explicit symbols of the s'iva-story as is found in the placesmentioned above. What is special with the Telangana festival is a huge repertoire of songs calledkāmuḍu-kāntakka songswith delicately erotic expressions describing the romance between two formulaic young male and female characters called kāmuḍu and kāntakka.



Mr. Sumanaspati Reddy, who is on this list , as a programme executive at All India Radio, Hyderabad,broadcastsome of these songs from a huge collection of recordings he made for the All India Radio, Hyderabad from the living tradition of singing these songs.(He involved me in the activity as researcher-commentator)



2. TheHolifestival, with the name vasantotsava is part of all the south Indian royal traditions and south Indian temple traditions. Many kings and chief deities of major south Indian temples arehave vasantototsavapriya as one of the titles/names.



3.kāmōtsava was an important part of ancient Indian history and as such get very frequently mentioned, described and reflected in ancient Indian literature. Many modernnarrative writersdealing with ancient Indian historical themes too included kāmōtsava as part of their narrative writing. Utsav the name of a bollywood movie based on the Sanskrit play mr̥cchakaṭikam also refers to kāmōtsava only.
