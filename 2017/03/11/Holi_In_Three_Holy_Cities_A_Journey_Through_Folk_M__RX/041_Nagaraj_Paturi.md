Thanks Prof. Iyengar for that candid personal experience narrative. For me, the most revealing part of it seems to be

  

"I remember the Kannada poem quoted by Prof.Paturi which urchins from the bordering roads around the agraharas would shout for collecting money for buying firewood."

  

The song (not poem), in fact, was not quoted by me, but was found quoted by different individuals from Karnataka, in their own personal experience narratives, as very closely heard from the group close to which they were standing or sung by themselves. But in Prof. Iyengar's narration, it is heard 'from thebordering roads around the agraharas'. That shows that all the Karnataka narratives in the thread are from different social strata or different neighborhood types /settlement patterns. It can not even be generalized that a certain caste's participation is the same in all parts of Karnataka or borders of Karnataka like my birth place. I was eyewitness and participant-observer to celebrations where Brahmins were equally active and enthusiastic participants in thecomically vailingKaama's corpse-procession, ranginaaTa or rangulaaTa.

  

In this thread, there is a Hindi article which historically presents the festival as madanotsava in its origin which matches well with the south Indian view of it as Kaamana habba / Kaaman Pandigai /Kaamuni punnama.

  

Thus it is not wrong to infer that south India retained the ancient pan-Indian madanotsava view.

  

The Holika myth, association with Radha-Krishna / Raas etc. found in the north and not found in the south can be inferred to be north Indian specific aspects not found in the Kaamotsav /Madanotsav origin evidences found in the same parts.

  

The Banjara community songs diffused into Telangana songs of the festival have words such as Holi. phrases such as chemmakelina voli or 'corrupt' forms of Hindi/ Banjara words such as 'Shyama, Khele(n) na Holi !'

  

Pluralistic India with variegated, myriad, Kaleidoscopicexistences /views of the same entity is well exemplified by this pan-Indian festival with all these varied existences/views.
