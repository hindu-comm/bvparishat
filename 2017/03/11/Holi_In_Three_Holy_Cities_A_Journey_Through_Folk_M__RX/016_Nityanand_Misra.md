Thank you Prof. Paturi Ji. My knowledge in folk-classical interface is no match for yours, and I hardly know anything about traditional Holi festivities in the South. Even though I lived in Bengaluru for five years (2004 to 2009), Holi was always with colours with students or professionals from different parts of India. It would be great if you can write on these songs, translate some of them, and publish.

  

Holi with colours is big in Gujarat too, at least from early 1990s. I still remember a very unique Holi in my childhood with actual *tesu* flowers (and without any artificial colours) at the home of one of our close neighbours who were from Gujarati Pushti-marga family (followers of Vallabhacharya and Srinathji). The coloured water was very soothing.
