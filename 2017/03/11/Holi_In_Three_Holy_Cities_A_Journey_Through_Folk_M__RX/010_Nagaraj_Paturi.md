"In the state of Tamil Nadu, people worship Lord Kaamathevan for his supreme sacrifice on the occasion ofHoli. People knowHoliby three different names – Kaman Pandigai, Kamavilas, and Kama Dahanam. People of Tamil Nadu have great faith in Lord Shiva and Lord Kaamathevan.

The story is that, Lord Shiva went into deep meditation after the death of his consort Sati. Due to Lord Shiva’s indifferent attitude, the other gods became tensed and worried. Meanwhile, the daughter of the mountain Goddess Paarvathi started to meditate to get Lord Shiva as her husband.

The gods sought help of Lord Kaamathevan in order to get Lord Shiva back to his original state. Kaamathevan is a god of Love. He was well aware of the repercussions of such an act, but Lord Kaamathevan agreed to help. Lord Kaamathevan shot his powerful arrow on Lord Shiva, while he was meditating. Enraged Lord Shiva opened his third eye and burnt Lord Kaamathevan into ashes. However, the arrow had the desired effect and Lord Shiva agreed to marry Parvathi.

But, Lord Kaamathevan’s wife Rathi felt very sad and she told her sad story to Lord Shiva and requested him to revive her husband Lord Kaamathevan. Lord Shiva listened to her story and agreed to her request.

In Tamil Nadu songs are sung onHolidepicting Rathi’s extreme sorrow. People offer sandalwood to Lord Kaamathevan to ease the pain of burning. People also believe that Lord Kaamathevan was revived on the day ofHoliand celebrate the festival in his name."
