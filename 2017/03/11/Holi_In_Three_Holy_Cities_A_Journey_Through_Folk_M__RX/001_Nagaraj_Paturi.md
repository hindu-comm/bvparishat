Congratulations to aadaraNIya Nityanandji for coming out with this article pertaining to a very important area of Indian culture namely, folk-classical interface.

  

Incidentally folk- classical interface has been my prime speciality within my cultural studies portfolio. That gives me a personal reason to be happy.

  

The article has,

  

"Holi being a popular festival of masses in northern parts of India like Uttar Pradesh, it comes as no surprise that there are many folk songs focused on Holi."

  

I don't see in this sentence any indication that the festival does not prevail in southern parts of India. In fact, that the festival is equally popular in south India is a fact that needs to be widely recognized and publicized. Another fact that needs equally wide recognition and wide publicity is that the festival is not a diffusion from north India but quite indigenous to south India.

  

The apparent distinction of south Indian version of the festival of colors seems to be that in south India, Kaama deva (manmatha) -centrality of the festival is vital and negates any 'diffusion' of the north Indian version which doesn't have this feature. Evidences for Kaamadeva temples and Kaamotsavs in north India as well as in south India in ancient period , galore. So what can be conjectured is that the festival being Kaamadeva-centered in south India is a continuation of a pan-Indian ancient tradition.

  

Coming back to the songs which is the theme of Sri Nityanandji's article, there is a huge repertoire of songs of this festival in south India with themes local to each part of south India.

  

I collected the songs from Kannada-Telugu bilingual parts of southern Andhra Pradesh and the Telugu songs of Telangana.
