The word Holi itself , as you might have noticed in the ethnographies /personal experience narratives I shared, is resisted as a description of the festival from a local perspective. Kaamana habba (Kannada) , Kaamuni Punnama ( Telugu ), Kaaman Pandigai (Tamil) are the names preferred. Since it is a traditional festival, cities are not the best places to see the intensity of the traditional celebration. Diffusion of names and forms from north India are seen more in the cities. Villagers may even think that city people celebrate holi whereas they celebrate Kaamana habba (Kannada) , Kaamuni Punnama ( Telugu ), Kaaman Pandigai (Tamil).
