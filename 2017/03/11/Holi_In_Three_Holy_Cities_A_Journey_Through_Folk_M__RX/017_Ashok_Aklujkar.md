Recall also the verse attributed to Bhartṛ-hari, the poet (probably around third century A.D.):

  

को न याति वशं लोके मुखे पिण्डेन पूरित: ।

मृदङ्गो मुख-लेपेन करोति मधुर-ध्वनिम् ।। (no. 467 on p. 154 of D.D. Kosambi’s edn)

  

There are some books on the history of Indian musical instruments, although I cannot recall their particulars at the moment.

  

Can anyone explain the distinction and historical relationship between mṛdaṅga and pakhāvaj, which is also played on two sides?
