At the time of Sabarabhashya, apparently Holi was restricted to the Easterners. In Sabarabhashya on 1.3.15, the Purvapakshin cites one regional celebration and declares तस्मात् होलाकादयः प्राच्यैरेव कर्तव्याः। From this instance, we come to know that Holi was celebrated by Easterners at that time.

  

The conclusion of the Adhikarana is interesting. Vidhis remain vidhis and are not restricted to people of one region. Vidhis are universal.
