Very informative article indeed, Nityananandji. I am surprized that Mrudang is mentioned as a drum in a North Indian folk song. I had always associated it with South Indian classical music. Or perhaps Mrudang of North is not the same as that of South. Regarding Prof.Paturi's remarks about Holi in South, in the areas where I hail from (Hassan dist. Karnataka) Holi did not exist during my school days. It might have diffused now.

Incidentally, except in recent classical literature, why is it that festivals that are observed to day do not find any mention in Sanskrit classics? Is it that these festivals like Holi, Dipavali, Ugadi etc. are comparatively of recent origin? I am sorry if I have strayed.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
