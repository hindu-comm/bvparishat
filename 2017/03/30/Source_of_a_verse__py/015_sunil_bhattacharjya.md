Dear Raghavaji,  
  

Thank you for the corrections. Earlier I was given to understand that the verse originally appears in the beginning of a version of the Bhagavata Mahapurana but I could not find any version with this verse anywhere. Sri Ganeshji found people reciting that after the ParA pujA and that could also mean that the use of this verse could have been popularized by Adi Shankara. The typos could have occurred during transcribing.
