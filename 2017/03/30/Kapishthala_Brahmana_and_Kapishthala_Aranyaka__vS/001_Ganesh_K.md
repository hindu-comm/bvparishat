Namaste,

  

THe Katharanyaka published by Adarsha Sanskrit shodha samstha(2009) lists only katharanyaka as available (and it lise the kapishtala katha as varient of kathakas).

  

However this book doesnt have not so similar passages with shvetashvatara. TITUS site has kathaka brahmana and aranyaka (remnant portions) however it is accessible only for TITUS members.

  

regards,

Ganesh K.
