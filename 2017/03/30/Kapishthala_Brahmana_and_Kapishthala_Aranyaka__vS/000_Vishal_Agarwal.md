Namaste Respected Scholars,

  

While reading the preface to Swami Maheshananda Giri's commentary on the Shvatashvatara Upanishad, published by the Dakshinamurty Matha (Mishra Pokhara, Varanasi) in 1975, I came across the following statements by Swamiji (Translation and paraphrase) -

  

"Despite numerous efforts, I was not able to procure the Samhita, Brahmana or the Aranyaka of the Shvetashvatara Sakha of Krishna Yajurveda. Therefore, I have contextualized the mantras of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad primarily with the help of Kapishthala Kathaka Brahmana and Kapishthala Kathaka Brahmana. However, as these texts were available to me only in manuscript form, I was not able to study them repeatedly and therefore had to consult the Taittiriya Brahmana and Taittiriya Aranyaka as well."

  

When I went through his entire commentary of Swamiji, I could not trace a single quotation from the Kapishthala Brahmana/Aranyaka, and for that matter, quotations from Taittiriya Brahmana were nil, and from Taittiriya Aranyaka were 5 or so (he does not quote Shruti passages very frequently in his learned commentary).

  

The above reference to Kapishthala Brahmana and Aranyaka are very intriguing to say the least, and I am sure that Swamiji had seen these manuscripts although he does not say where (in the Dakshinamurti grantha-bhandara?).

  

At the Anand Ashrama in Pune, there are two manuscripts titled 'Kapishtala Samhita', but from the length of the folios (as evident in the online catalog of digitized manuscripts published by IGNCA), it would appear that each of these two manuscripts would not cover more than 1-2 Ashtakas. Hopefully, I will be able to visit IGNCA soon to see the films of these manuscripts myself.

  

Pandit Bhagavadatta, writing in 1920s, had mentioned, "I met a Pandit XYZ (cannot recall the name - Vishal) at Nashik who had come across some Brahmins from Mulatapi (Multai in Betul district- Vishal) who knew their Katha Samhita very well." Likewise, in the estuary of Tapi river in Gujarat, there is a community of Kapishthala Brahmins. A community of these Kapishthala Brahmins is also said to be resident (and here, it could just mean the gotra Kapishthala, which is found all over N India as far as Kashmir) in Ujjain, which is not far from Betul. Durga, the commentator of Nirukta, was himself a Kapishthala Vashishtha gotriya Brahmin and wrote his work at Jambusar, which is on coastal Gujarat.

  

So my question to the revered scholars of this list is - have you come across any concrete references to the presence of a living tradition of Kapishthala Katha Yajurveda, and the presence of complete manuscripts of this Shakha? I am hopeful that this is the case, because in our own times, we have come across Shakhas that we had thought to have been lost - like Shankhayana Rigvedis in Banswara in rural Rajasthan who can still recite portions of their Samhita and maintain their manuscripts. And of course, the discovery of the Paippaladis in Orissa in the last century is well known too.

  

With regards,

  

Vishal
