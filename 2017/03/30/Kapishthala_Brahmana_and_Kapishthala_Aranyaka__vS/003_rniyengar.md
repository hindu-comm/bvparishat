In this connection I wonder whether the village "Kapisthalam" and the neighbouring settlements in Tanjavur district, Tamil Nadu may provide some information. This is of course a speculation; but Kanchipuram, Kumbhakonam and the nearby villages on the banks of Kaveri have a hoary tradition of Vedaadhyayana, particularly the KYV. The name Kapisthalam perhaps honours or remembers the original Kapisthala (modern Kaithal) near the Kurukshetra to which place the Kapisthala-katha tradition owes its affiliation.

Thanks
