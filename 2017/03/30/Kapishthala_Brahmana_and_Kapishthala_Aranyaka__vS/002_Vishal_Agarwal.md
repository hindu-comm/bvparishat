These works are not what I was looking for. The Katha Aranyaka, as you mention, incomplete in all of its printed editions. A complete edition of the same was in preparation by the late B B Chaubey, and I presume that he did leave an editable/printable copy of this work before he passed away.

  

As for the Katha Brahmana, the printed portions in Kathaka Samkalana and in a Harvard PhD thesis are all for the Kashmirian version. The Kathaka portion of the Taittiriya Shakha are perhaps closer to the Kapishthala Katha version that I was referring to.

  

A solitary manuscript of the Kapishthala Katha Grhyasutra exists in Varanasi, and a transcript of the same with the Ramlal Kapoor Trust (Bahalgarh, Sonepat)..

  

Thank you.

  

With regards,

  

Vishal
