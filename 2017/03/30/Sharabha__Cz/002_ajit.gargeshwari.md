The article *doesn't support* Dr. Joshi's theory I quote "Sharabha is the Syberian Elka. The ancient people who lived in that area near the north pole, theyseeElka with four legs every day, but they also believed it had eight legs at one time and the god removed the four legs leaving four legs now. The ancient Indians had contacts with the northern people through Aghanistan, Pamirs to all the way up. They knew Northern lights as Fire in the sky. Go through the ancient history of Tokharistan, Semi-rechye, (Dharmarajas Dvaitavana with Dvaita sarovara) and the ancient Ladies kingdom (Stree-Rajya). The ancient Chines believed that the Heaven was on the southwest border of China. They had name for it in their language. For ancient Iranians, Heaven was beyond northeast boundary of their country. They used to call it Paraadesha. From it we have Paradise in English" needs substantiation and further proof.
