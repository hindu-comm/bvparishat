May be of interest.  
According to the article of

KR Bhavana, Shreevathsa. "Medical geography in Charaka Samhita." *Ayu* 35.4 (2014): 371.  
Sharabha (eight-legged deer) are said to be famous in *Kashmira* and *Kumkuma* in *Bahlika*.According to Charaka Samhita, Chikitsa Sthana, Yonivyapath Chikitsa, 30/90-95 & 27/45-46.



I am glad to read this posting andreference to Bahlika. In my postingfor Sharabha and ElkaI mentioned Tokharistan which is northwest of Kashmira. Unfortunately it seems that my article was not posted. Thanks. NRJOSHI
