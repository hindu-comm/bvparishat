I've more than one volumes in scan form from DLI. But, still they are not complete.

You can't get them in shop and many libraries I visited, don't have all volumes of the text.

So, I'll add my request foe the same here.

I know that the Goyanka Library, Lalita Ghat, Varanasi has all volumes. But, I'm far away from Varanasi and they are skeptical about cameras/phones.

Although, I'll try to take help from some friend.
