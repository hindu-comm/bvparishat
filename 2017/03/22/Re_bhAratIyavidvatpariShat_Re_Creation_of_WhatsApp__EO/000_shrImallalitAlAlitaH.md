To add:

If we shift to WhatsApp or Telegram, discussions will not be available for public.

WhatsApp doesn't keep messages on it's servers. So once delivered, it can't be find on their server or any web-interface. Add all other problems which WhatsApp has, as eating up your limited phone memory, making difficult to change phone, etc.

Telegram keeps messages on it's server, but it doesn't have any web-interface for public.

Obviously, you will lose the capacity to search on Google.

What we are discussing here, is not for only us; but it's archive of knowledge and a show of intellectual capacities. GoogleGroups is best.

It assures that these messages will stay for long, unless the owner deletes that.

And, since BVP is publicly visible, anyone can search and find useful informations.
