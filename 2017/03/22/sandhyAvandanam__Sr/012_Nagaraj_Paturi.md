Without any contradiction to the respectedVidwan Korada Subrahmanyamji's views let me add the following:

  

It was already discussed in this and its parent thread how the s'routa karma, in course of time, incorporated paurāṇika elements. Similarly some aspects of smārta (advaita) , mādhva (dvaita) and śrīvaiśṇava (viśiṣṭādvaita) traditions too have been incorporated into the actual details of the practice.

  

For example, Vaiṣṇavas seem to prefer the verse dhyyēyassadā savitr̥maṇḍalamadhyavartī to the verse muktāvidruma..... for dhyānam before and after gāyatrī japam. 

  

Similarly for mantras likeउद्यन्तमस्तं यन्तमादित्यमभिध्यायन्, कुर्वन्, ब्राह्मणो विद्वान्सकलं भद्रमश्नुतेअसावादित्योब्रह्मेति, ब्रह्मैव सन्-ब्रह्माप्येति, य एवं वेद । different schools of Vedanta may have interpretations. Saadhaka subscribing to a particular school may perform the ritual with the bhāvanā as per his school.

  

Most crucially, the meaning of dhīmahi can be taken differently by different schools.Saadhaka subscribing to a particular school may perform the japa with the bhāvanā as per his school.
