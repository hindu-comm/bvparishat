Thankyou sir.

  

I think you have mentioned Main steps.

  

How do each vedic sandhyavandnam differ. Do they differ in ideology of Brahma bhavana. I have one doubt that do we have Dvaita , Vishistadvaita and Advaita philosophies reflect in mantras apart from the ones you have mentioned.

  

  

I found one mantra which almost matches aham brahmasmi which is Advaita concept. And harihara dhyanam.
