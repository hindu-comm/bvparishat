Respected scholars,

Valmiki says: सन्ध्याकालमनाः श्यामा ध्रुवमेश्ः(Sh)यति जानकी । नदीं चेमां शूभजलां सन्ध्यार्थे वरवर्णीनी ॥ सु-१४-४९॥ गोरखपुर्.

This verse is interpreted to mean that Sita would visit the river in the evening for sandhyavandanam. One could construe that women during times Valmiki lived or wrote about, women did sandhyavandanam.

Regards,

Murthy
