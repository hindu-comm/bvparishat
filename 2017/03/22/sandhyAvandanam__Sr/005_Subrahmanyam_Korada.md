नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

ऋग्वेदसन्ध्य़ावन्दनम् slightly differs from the यजुर्वेदसंध्यावन्दनम् ।

  

But the ideology is the same - सविता ब्रह्म ।

  

This नित्यकर्म , as is quoted , is very much there in वेद and द्वैताद्वैत etc are recent developments . The सन्ध्यावन्दनमन्त्रs are not interpreted in any other fashion.

  

We may add --

  

then what about others and ladies ?

  

गोपs take their cattle during sunrise and return during sunset . Similarly ladies fetch water during sunrise and sunset - water should not be fetched during   night .

So both , गोपs and ladies have a glance of Sun during both the twilights and the same is enough for them --

  

असौ यो’वसर्पति नीलग्रीवो विलोहितः

उतैनं गोपा अदृशन्नदृशन्नुदहार्यः

उतैनं विश्वा भूतानि स दृष्टो मृडयाति नः

  

              --- शतरुद्रियम् ,नमकम् , कृष्णयजुर्वेदः
