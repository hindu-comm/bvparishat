Dear friends,  
  

As regards the Bhagavadgitabhashya of Bhaskracharya, the great Dvaita scholar, late Dr. B.N.K.Sharma, in a paper entitled "Bhaskara- a forgotten commentator on the Gita", said that Shankaracharya in his Bhagavadgitabhashya repudiated Bhaskaracharya's Gitabhashya. Dr. Sharma said that this does not necessarily mean Bhaskaracharya was later than Shankaracharya, as both of them could have been contemporary.  

  

Regards,
