AadaraNIya Prof Korada, SAdar PraNAm !

Thanks for detailed explanation on the word “GuNA”.

Prof S Korada is Super Kalpavriksha. I ask one question, he offers me wealth of information enriched many times.

I have no problem with the word GuNa having different meanings in different contexts referring to many example cited by you in your posting.

Now my questions. The word VarNa is used by different scholars with different meanings such as a letter sound, phoneme or syllable. In one of your posting you mentioned it is Aks’ara. In my postings I took VarNa as a phoneme (for convenience of writing in English). By the VarNa I mean /k/ and not “ka”.

In your book you mentioned many Aachaaryas supported VarNavAda.

Question-What exactly these Aachaaryas had in their mind when they used the term “VarNavAda” Were they referring to Aksharas or to Svaras or to Vyanjanas?

Question- One cannot have meanings to the VarNas because it then gets PrAtipadikatvam with grammatical attachment of Sup and Tin.

I read that “ka” is Devataa. “ka” is prajApati. ‘ka” is Yaayudevataa. (References not handy, pardon me) Many ancient etymologists (Shaakataayana, Yaaska) attached meanings to syllables or even to a
single letter. They might have used them as Upaaya (as you used meanings for Gu and Ru”). May such examples are available from the ancient BrahmaNa granthas. I think there is no Praatipadikatvam to these syllables used as Upaaya.

I say now I am using my VarNavada (meanings to /k/,/kh/, /g/ etc) as Upaaya. My Upaaya is not random as in examples listed above where meanings to syllables selected just to adjust to the meaning of the word). My upaaya is systematic matching with periodicity of VarNamAlA. Waiting to receive wealth of knowledge from you so I can remove my misunderstandings. Thanks.NRJOSHI
