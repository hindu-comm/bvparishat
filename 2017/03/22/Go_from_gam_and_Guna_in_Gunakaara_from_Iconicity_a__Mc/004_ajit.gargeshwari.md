Dear Prof Joshi,  
If you want only a Specific member to answer you queries why don't you write off the list mail to that specific person. If you are posting on The list all members can response.  
An attempt was made by member's to answer you queries and delayed responses to questions you ask  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
