Prof S Korada, Saadar PraNaam !

Thanks for explanation about the word Gau and its meaning. I have no problem with it now.

However I have some doubts in my mind about the meaning of the word GuNa. Here are examples- (1) NirguNa Brahma, (2) GuNa of AakAsha is Shabda,(3) Satva, Rajas, Tamas are GuNas, (4) GuNah poojAsthAnam (5) GuNadharma of materials.

I do not see any trace of the meaning multiplication in the use of GuNa in these words as it is in GuNakAra or in DviguNa rajjuh. Please correct me if I were wrong.Thanks, NRJOSHI
