Dear Prof Paturi,

My original question was for Prof S Korada.

  

Anyway since you replied to my question, I have new questionfor you and for others who are interested to reply. We have words like- NirguNa Brahma, GuNadharma ofmaterials, and GuNakaara. What is the connection of GuNa from other two words to GuNa in Gunakara(multiplication). That is what I wanted to know. Thanks. NRJOSHI
