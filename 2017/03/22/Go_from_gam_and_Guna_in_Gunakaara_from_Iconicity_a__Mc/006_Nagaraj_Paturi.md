guṇa in all the five usages quoted by Dr N R Joshi is in the sense of quality, feature, property etc.

  

guṇa has the usage in the meaning of secondary : e.g. guṇībhūtavyangya, gauṇa etc.

  

In fact, this meaning of 'secondary' seems to be underlying the meanings such as quality, feature, property etc.also.

  

That is the underlying logic in vaiśēṣika view of dravya and guṇa too.

  

Underlying the meaning of 'secondary' is the meaning of 'added' (not fundamental ).

  

This meaning of 'adding' is the one that leads to the meaning in dviguṇa etc. and also in guṇakāra.
