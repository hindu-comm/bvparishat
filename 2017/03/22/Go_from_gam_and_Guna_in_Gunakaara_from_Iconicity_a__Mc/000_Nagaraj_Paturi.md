Saadara PraNaam Prof S. Korada

  

Since we are back again on the subject of Shabda and its meaning,

I have a couple of questions.

(1) Yaaska offers etymology of 'GO' (cow) shabda from the root 'gam' (to go) . But it has problems. What is your opinion on Yaaska effort?

(2) There are many meanings to the word 'GuNa' in Sanskrit.

  

In mathematics we have the word GuNakAra (GuNAkAra)for multiplication. What is the meaning of GuNa here?

Please pardon me for asking questions. I simply like to add to my knowledge learning from experts like you. Thanks NRJOSHI
