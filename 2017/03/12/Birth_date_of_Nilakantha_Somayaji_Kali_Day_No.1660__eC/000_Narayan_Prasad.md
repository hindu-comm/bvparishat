Dear Members,

 

    I would like to point out the error in the birth date of the Kerala astronomer, Nilakantha Somayaji, in Roman Calendar indicated by Shri K.V. Sarma.

  

Shri Sarma has quoted Nilakantha Somayaji's birth date in Kali Day No. as 1660181:

  

 "Here, Nilakantha himself says that he was born on the Kali Day 1660181, which works out to AD 1443, Dec." (Siddhanta Darpana, p.xxvi)

  

In the "Tantra-sangraha", he has corrected this birth date in Roman Calendar: "... Kali Day 1660181, which works out to AD 1444, June 14." (p.xxxvi)

  

As per my calculations, the birth date works out to be AD 1444, June 17 (Wed).

  

I would like to know the views of other members.

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
