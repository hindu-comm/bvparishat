आदरणीय नारायण प्रसाद महोदय !  

The Kali day 1660181 mentioned by Nilakantha as his birth date corresponds to June 17, 1444 CE only. This can be confirmed from the recent edition of Tantrasaṅgraha brought out in 2011.  
(Ref: Tantrasaṅgraha of Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājī, K.Ramasubramanian and M.S.Sriram, Hindustan Book Agency, New Delhi, 2011. p.xxxv).

I am enclosing a snap shot of the relevant page for ready reference. The date of June 14, that you find in Prof. K. V. Sarma's edition in page xxxvi could be a typo.
