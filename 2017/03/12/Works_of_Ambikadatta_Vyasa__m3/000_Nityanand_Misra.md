Dear list

  

Which works of Ambikadatta Vyasa are available online? I know of the following

  

Shivarajavijayam:<https://archive.org/details/Shivarajavijayam>

Ashcharya-vrittanta:<http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/428820>

  

Any other works? Is his *Chaturanga-chaturi* available?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
