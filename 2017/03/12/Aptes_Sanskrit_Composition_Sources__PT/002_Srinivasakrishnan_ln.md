Re Apte's Student's Guide to Sanskrit Composition, it may still be used in pockets in India where Sanskrit is taught thru English medium. But I think it is an old fashioned book, written using old fashioned terminologies. Indian students would need some guidance around some of its grammatical terms like 'substantive', 'antecedent' etc. Besides the book has a plethora of references to Latin including Latin phrases and such. They're distracting but not necessarily show stoppers. There's also an emphasis on translation which, I feel, is central to European pedagogy. I feel Coulson's Sanskrit is a simpler and somewhat more user friendly version of Apte's Composition. 

  

In other words, it's a product of its times i.e., the late 19th century. M R Kale in his grammar book mentions that the chapter on usage in his grammar book is comparable to that of V S Apte's in his 'Composition' since both have adapted from a common original. I dont know when and where the original was written. I myself found Apte's 'Composition' rather useful for its lovely selections of quotations from literature.

  

I have heard people (mostly educated in India) say that they found Shri Nautiyal's books in Hindi (especially the smaller 'anuvad chandrika') rather more useful. It has no extraneous Latin type references. Its style is somewhat more straightforward since it addresses itself to those who already know at least one Indian language i.e., Hindi.

  

Unfortunately such books dont exist anymore in Tamil. I'd have loved to use one. I dont know what's the position of Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and the other languages in this regard. I think therefore 'Composition' continues to fulfil a felt gap. It's a quality work and explains concepts by drawing on examples from the masters.

  

Before I forget, let me add that 'Composition's has been translated into Hindi some years ago. The book is likely to be available on-line somewhere.
