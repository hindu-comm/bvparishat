Is it? Who can share a story of how they got aware of the book?

Hindi styled terminology, when one uses halant instead of virama for a non-Indian is an issue as well. Actually even the best books (written 10-20-30 years ago) names the sam thing differently, see<https://sanskritstudio.wordpress.com/book-reviews/>

Not only them. So an intro book is needed to use it, it's not a beginners book anyway. I would say it's a 3rd year book.

And that's great! One understands that Sanskrit is not the mother of all languages and there are others of great interest, that have many expressions and words in common.

Exactly.

Indeed, translation, but how do you learn Sanskrit? You do not learn Sanskrit through Sanskrit, you learn Sanskrit through Hindi, for example, you do not start by learning Panini by heart unless you have 12 years free of worries ahead.

That's an interesting comparison. I myself do not like Coulson's book because of poor typography, but so is Apte's book - one needs time to understand what's written because it's dirty print.

Best books on Sanskrit are written at least 100 years ago. Biggest Sanskrit dictionaries - 150 years ago. And none of them are outdated. They had methodology - common day books have none or little of it.

Kale is great. But Apte is an addition to Kale.

Would love to hear more such stories, thanks for sharing.

Never heard before, but what's so good about it? Is "since it addresses itself to those who already know at least one Indian language i.e., Hindi" the only argument?

Can it be?

Never heard of it, who printed it?
