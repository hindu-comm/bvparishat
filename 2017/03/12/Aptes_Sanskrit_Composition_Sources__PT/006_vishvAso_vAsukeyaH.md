Bollocks, man - we learned sanskrit through sanskrit by an excellent pair of teachers as high school students (we didn't even attend a gurukula) in bengaLUru. Samskrita bharati teaches it to through sanskrit as well (I've experienced that as well). Basic idea is to leverage known words from our local language, and build on it using gestures and the like.
