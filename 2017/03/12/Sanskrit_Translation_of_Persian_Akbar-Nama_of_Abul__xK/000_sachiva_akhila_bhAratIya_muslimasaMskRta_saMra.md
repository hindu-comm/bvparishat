Respected Scholars

‘Muslim contributions to Sanskrit learning’ was a much accepted subject in the beginning of 20^(th)and the last of 19^(th)century in India, but now-a-days the subject has been forgotten by us. Now with this little start, we are trying to make a path for our researchers and scholars of Sanskrit, Persian and History of India, whereupon they will attach each-other.



In this regard a rare Sanskrit Translation of Persian “Akbar-Nama” of Abul Fazl has been published a year’s ego. Persian “Akbarnama”, entitled “सर्वदेशवृत्तान्तसंग्रह” has been translated at the royal instance of Mughal Emperor Akabr in 1595-97 A.D. by महामहोपाध्याय महेश ठक्कुर of Mithila who got the Kingship over Tirhut (Mithila) as a gift for translating the History of Royal state.
