Dear list members

  

I would be much obliged if anybody can help me with email address or phone number of the Sanskrit scholar Dr. Usha Devpura (probably with MDS University, Ajmer). Please reply off the list.

  

The website of the Department of College Education, Government of Rajasthan, has her CV (link below) without any contact details. She is not profiled in the Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars.

Thanks, Nityananda
