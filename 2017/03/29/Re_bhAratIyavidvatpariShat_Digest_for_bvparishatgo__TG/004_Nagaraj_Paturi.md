In this case, the subject line would have been still missing since it is posted through reply mode from the digest subject line.

  

Starting a new post through group interface at<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bvparishat>

or

  

Composing a new mail addressing it to[bvpar...@googlegroups.com](). with an appropriate subject line is also a solution.
