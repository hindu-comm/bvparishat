Dear Sri udaya bhaskar deekshit Parasaram,  
  
I have edited the post aand chnged the subject line.  
  
Please treat this mail as polite request. What is the purpose of of not editing you mails before posting? When the moderators did change mail settings to help scholars who cannot or don't want to edit there was resentment and some went even to the extent of saying let use whats up for scholarly list communications. Please save bandwidth and help others to read posts easily. Please search DLI now at archives the requested book is available. If you have any difficulty please let me know I will send the book to you. Thank you in advance for your understanding.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
