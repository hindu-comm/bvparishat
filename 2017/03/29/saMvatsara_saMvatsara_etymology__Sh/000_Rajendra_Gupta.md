Hon'ble Vidvans

  

I shall be grateful for exact etymology of the word 'saMvatsara संवत्सर'. I shall greatly appreciate your answers in English or Hindi because my present level of learning Sanskrit is not sufficient to fully understand 'Sanskrit only' text.

  

Kindly also give reference of book(s) in English or Hindi for etymology of Sanskrit words.

  

Best regards

Rajendra Gupta
