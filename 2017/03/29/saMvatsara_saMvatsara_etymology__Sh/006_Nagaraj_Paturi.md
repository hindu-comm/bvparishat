Though J Gonda does not derive it that way, his detailed and analysis of the idea of samvatsara in the Vedic texts helped me to confirm what was my hunch earlier: sar = to flow /to progress refers to the flow of time (of year) itself and vas = to stay refers to its steadiness (7th chapter of Gonda's book.) saratyapivasateeti / vasan sarateeti . That matches with the cyclic nature that Gonda shows in the first chapter as 'known' to the Vedic texts.

  

It is this cyclic nature of time that is such a crucial characteristic of Indian view of time contrasting with linear view of time found elsewhere. Mircea Eliade focuses on this characteristic of Indian worldview and shows that linear time is imbibed by modernity and its constituent philosophies such as Marxism from semitic religions.

  

The centrality of the cyclic nature (of year and of time) embedded (in my view) in the etymology of the word, probably explains the significance, as substantiated by Gonda's book, accorded to the concept of samvtsara in the Vedic texts.
