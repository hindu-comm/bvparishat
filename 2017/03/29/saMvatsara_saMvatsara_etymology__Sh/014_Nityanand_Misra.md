Thanks for confirming. So does he offer no etymology at all?

  

Looking at the conjectures, a parallel comes to my mind: the etymology of Kashmir. Babur made the wild guess that the name Kashmir derived from a race of men called Kas, Wilson (yes, the legendary H H Wilson) made a not-so wild guess (still a guess) that it from Kashyapa-mira (which he said became Kashuf-mir and then Kashmir), and the cricketer-traveller Vigne derived it from Kashyapa-pura (even saying that m and p are commutable) and more ridiculously, from the biblical figure Cush. None of these authors could give a complete or convincing derivation, while the Unadi Sutra 4.32 कशेर्मुट् च gives a complete derivation. \[I am writing an article on this as of now\].

  

If we consider a Sanskrit word to be ‘avyutpanna’, there is no point looking for an etymology and the question has no answer. If we consider it to be ‘vyutpanna’, any etymology has to be complete and in accordance with Sanskrit etymological and grammatical sources like Ashtadhyayi and Unadi Sutra-s.
