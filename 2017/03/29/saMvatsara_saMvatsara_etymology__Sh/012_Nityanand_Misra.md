Before anybody derives *saṃvatsara* from *vatsa*, the derivation of*vatsa*itself has to be settled. Any etymology of*saṃvatsara*involving*vatsa*but not deriving*vatsa*independently of Unadi Sutra-s is conceptually flawed, because it amounts to both accepting and rejecting Unadi Sutra-s at the same time.

  

The word*vatsa*itself is derived from the Unadi Sutra वृतॄवदिहनिकमिकषिभ्यः सः (US 3.62). So if one takes Unadi Sutra 3.62 as authority, why not take US 3.72 in the same chapter which derives*saṃvatsara*also as authority? One cannot accept Unadi Sutra derivation for *vatsa* and at the same time reject the Unadi Sutra derivation for*saṃvatsara*.

  

As for Gonda, does he give a complete derivation? Or is it just conjecture? If the latter, why should Gonda's view carry any weight at all? We do not have any reason to believe Gonda had better insight than the author of Unadi Sutra-s, or do we?
