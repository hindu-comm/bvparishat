There are usages such as parivatsara and 'vatsara' as an independent word also.

  

So interpretations such as deriving it from sarva etc. can be taken as ideas expressed for some other good purpose but not tenable linguistically /grammatically.

  

Vatsa -year connection is not as compelling as vatsara -seasonal cycle connection.

  

Still, vas + sar by themselves do not have components meaning seasons or seasonal cycles.

  

Thus

  

‘संवसन्ति ऋतवः अस्मिन् इति संवत्सरः'  

  

should be the 'best so far' but not the most convincing.
