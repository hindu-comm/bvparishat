I've also seen a usage of this word in a stotram about devI, hRdayAmRtam, which was authored by jagannAtha/umAnandanAtha(a disciple of bhAskararAya/bhAsurAnandanAtha).

It was as -

अलं समवलम्बितैरमरशम्भलीविभ्रम-  
भ्रमास्पदपदप्रदैरदृढशर्मभि: कर्मभि: ।  
त्रिलोचनविलोभने तुलितबिम्बडम्भे रुचा  
मनो विश मनोहरे मधुरधर्मणि ब्रह्मणि ॥६॥

One must recognise that the used word is डम्भ, not दम्भ.

So, looking at dictionary and suggesting the meaning of दम्भ here as meaning of डम्भ is wrong, unless we have proof from lexicon.



  

कचशोभाजितकालमेघडम्भे and तुलितबिम्बडम्भे रुचा , these usages of the word डम्भ in the compound hint that it may mean pride(which makes it equivalent of दम्भ).

  

However, unless I see some proof from older commentaries, I'll treat it as a good guess work.
