The shared file gives Dambha = wielder of Indra's vajra

  

But the word has several usages with the meaning outer look being different from inner reality

  

dambhaachaarah in Bh G

  

daambhika = pompous

  

mystic , hidden, not understood on face value etc. match with the famous name Guha of Subrahmanya
