Reetected Scholars , Namaskar!

This question is not directly related to "word occurrence frequencies" but related to VarNa (phonemes) frequencies in Sanskrit words. Why there are small number of Sanskrit words using Retroflex varNas and the Dental VarNa "th" in (Manthanam-churning) and Palatal VarNa "jh"?

Any reason, please help me to understand Thanks. NRJOSHI
