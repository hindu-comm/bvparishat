Paturiji,  

  

You are right. Original verses of Tola Kavi are in Malayalam version of the book. Unfortunately, the translator removed the verses and retained only the stories. I will try to translate only relevant parts of the Malayalam article and post it here later.

  

As you observed, Tola Kavi's verses are in more in Manipravalam style, there is very less/no bi-lingual slesha in them.



regards  
shankara
