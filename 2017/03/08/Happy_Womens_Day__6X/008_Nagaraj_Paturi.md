Vidwan Sri Shankaraji,

  

Probably the bilingual s'lEsha of Tola kavi is somewhere else than the page shared.

  

You might be aware of ManipravAlam, a style that emerged as one of the consequences of mixing Sanskrit with the regional language, particularly in South India. [This wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipravalam)focuses only on Sanskrit-Tamil mixing. There was Sanskrit-Telugu Manipravalam also which prevailed during the 10th -13th Century AD.

  

Bilingual s'lEsha seems to be one such consequence of the Sanskrit-regional language mixing.
