Namaste,

  

Here is a Siva Vandana verse written by Tola Kavi in which he has made use of names of important communities who used to serve in temples in those days.

  

मारारे तव दासोहं वारियस्य जटान्तरे ।  
यंप्राहुरव्ययं नित्यं तन्त्रिणेत्रं नमाम्यहम्॥  

  

In the above verse, marar, variar, embran and tantri are caste names/designations of persons serving in temples.



regards  
shankara
