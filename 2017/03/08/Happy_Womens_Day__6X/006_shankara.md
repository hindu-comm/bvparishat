Savarkarji,

  

Thanks a lot for explaining the slesha prayoga. I was not aware of the Marathi meanings of these words. It is the first time I come across bi-lingual selsha. Though I had read some Malayalam verses of Tola Kavi (9th century AD), with bi-lingual slesha, it had not struck me as an independent genre of slesha. Attaching pdf of 'Tola the Poet' from 'Legends of Kerala'.

  

I had translated a part of this article into Sanskrit for the following blog post.

<https://sanskritwisdom.wordpress.com/tag/tola-kavi/>  

  

I request scholars to provide information on instances of of bi-lingual slesha in Sanskrit verses using regional language.



regards  
shankara
