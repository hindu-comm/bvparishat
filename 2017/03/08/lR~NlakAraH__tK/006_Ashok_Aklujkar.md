It should perhaps be added that the verse is verse no. 4 in the seventh act of Kālidāsa’s Abhijñāna-śākuntalam.

  

(If the specification was made in a post that I missed, pl ingore this suggestion. My computer seems to have recently gobbled up several emails.)

  

The post by Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya indicates that he has taken the verse as coming from Abhijñāna-śākuntalam.

  

I would expect variant readings to be available. If Prof. Vasantkumar M. Bhatt can give us a textual treatment of the passage, it may throw some light on the history of Sanskrit and/or Kālidāsa’s time.
