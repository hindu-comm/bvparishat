.gachchet cet and yady agamiÀyat (l¤ṅ)

‘should he have gone’ and ‘had he gone’ that is ‘if he had gone’ often convey the same sense.

But

*kim **v******¡**bhavi**À**yad**** aru¸as tamas¡Æ vibhett¡ *

*tam cet sahasrakira¸o dhuri **n******¡**kari**À**yat***

cannot be expressed by liṅ. That could not express conditional past.
