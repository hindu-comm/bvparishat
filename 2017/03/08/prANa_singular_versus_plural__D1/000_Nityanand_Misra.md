Dear list

  

I am looking for lexicographic/grammatical references which distinguish between the use of the word *prāṇa* in singular and plural. There are certainly differences. For example, when used in the plural, *prāṇa* cannot refer to the Supreme Brahman (which is the first meaning in the Vachaspatyam). The context is:

  

On page 13 of Light on Pranayama (1983, London: Unwin Paperbacks), B K S Iyengar writes

Quote

Prana means breath, respiration, life, vitality, energy or strength. When used in the plural, it denotes certain vital breaths or currents of energy (prana-vayus).

But we often hear usages like प्राणान् हरति, in which case the meaning appears to be life itself and not the multiple vital breaths. So my guess is that even in plural, the word*prāṇa*can mean life. Monier-Williams lists the meaning life under the entry*prāṇa* by specifying it asplural. This seems to be correct but given my recent experience with Monier-Williams, I would like to double confirm.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
