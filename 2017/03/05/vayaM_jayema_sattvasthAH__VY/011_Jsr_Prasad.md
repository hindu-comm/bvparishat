Dr Bijoy ji,

  
If you just look at the expression and don't want to follow the agreement between number, adjective and pronoun, it is not Sanskrit. This has already been clarified by Prof. Bhat.

  

Simply your pronominal subject 'वयं' used in plural is not agreeing with the adjective/modifier 'प्रशान्तः' used in singular. The thumb rule is - यल्लिङ्गं, यद्वचनं, या च विभक्तिः विशेष्यस्य - तल्लिङ्गं, तद्वचनं, सा च विभक्तिः विशेषणस्य ।
