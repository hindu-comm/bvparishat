Which words are singular (nitya-ekavachana), always dual (nitya-dvivachana), or always plural (nitya-bahuvachana) is not governed by Yoga because this is the domain of speech, where Yoga is not the guide but Vyakarana and Kosha-s are. These words do not have any singularity built in them as you say.
