Dr Bhat,

But it is not an issue of grammar, it is a question of diction and poetics.

My question was on the meter.

रामवत् शीलसम्पन्न: कृष्णवत् नयकोविद: would be possibly appropriate.  

वयं सागरवत् प्रशान्तः could be an expression where the collection of objects is conveyed and not individual objects

Just a thought, you are the teacher.

Best regards,

BM
