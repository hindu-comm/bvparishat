My confusion is whether words like आत्मस्थ, समाधिस्थ, सत्वस्थ, etc would have have singularity built into their use.

It is a yoga point of view, considering them as unique states without multiplicity.

This is different than a cumulative value likeसुख or गुण

I may be dragging it, but I am trying to get the concept into grammar.

सत्यस्थ would be different than सत्वस्थ, so we sayसत्यमेव जयते, butसत्वमेव ब्रह्म

You may analyze if it has merit..
