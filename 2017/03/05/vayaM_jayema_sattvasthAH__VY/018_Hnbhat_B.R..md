His imagination is fine for the expression in the language where there is no adjective - noun agreement like English, or any language. But in Sanskrit the disagreement betwwen adjective and noun is restricted certain popular expression like  वेदाः प्रमणम् which was linguistically debated by नैययिक-s.

  

Dr. Pandurangi will be able to deside whether same could be applied to the sentence like वयं जयेम सत्त्वस्थः to justify the modification by Bijoy Mishra.
