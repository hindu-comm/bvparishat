The point that the construction/change proposed by Prof. Bijoy Misra is ungrammatical is correct (although there is a difference between the way Prof. Prasad locates the lack of grammaticality — a singular subject would not go with a plural verb — and the way Dr. Bhat locates the lack of grammaticality — an adjective should have the same grammatical number as the noun it is supposed to qualify). However, the assumption in the sentence quoted above, namely that constructions such as वेदाः प्रमाणम् are noun-adjective constructions is also not correct. They are appositive constructions; pramāṇa, meaning ‘pramāṇa-bhūta person/thing’ in the cited sentence, has the value of a noun, and the grammatical structure of the sentence is the same as that of ‘A is B’, where both A and B refer to persons/things. Just as someone using bhīmaḥ/bhīmo draupadĪ in the context of Bhīma going to Kīcaka’s residence in the disguise of Draupadī would not be indulging in ungrammatical speech, a person saying वेदाः प्रमाणम् remains in the domain of grammatical speech.
