Friends,

I get that point, That is basic grammar. My question is with thought conversion.

There could be a condition when every object in a group may not participate in

action but the group could be declared as active. I am looking for a construct

where the group can be called सत्वस्थः where each individual may not be.

"We are learned" is a collective expression where each of us is not necessarily

"learned." So the action has converted to a quality, which is labeled on the

group as an expression.

I don't wish to belabor this. "Indians are honest" is a statements, which would

transcend the thought if each person in the group is honest. It would appear as

an expression to convey a thought with metaphorical implication.

Best regards,

BM
