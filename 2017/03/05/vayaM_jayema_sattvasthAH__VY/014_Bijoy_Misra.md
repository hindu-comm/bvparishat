Further analyzing, I see that there could be a difference between a physical

movement and a qualified movement, like रथस्थः vs. सत्वस्थः

If anyone feels like, we can analyze further from the linguistic and

communication point of view. It is possible that grammar would restrict the

expression as pointed out. Singular in use in certain situations would be 

valid in expression in language like Oriya, that I speak. In such situations,

a collection is implied that can contain internal aberrations. It is a function

of broad generalization as I see. सत्व is a singular property hence, multiple

attainments might not convey the required expression.

We can drop the line of discussion if it becomes a distraction.

Best regards,

BM
