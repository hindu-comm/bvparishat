Nityanandaji,

The debate comes whether speech is rule based (lexical) or context-based (semantic).

I appreciate all the responses which are technically right. The question is more from

thought to communication point of view. There could be analysis in the literature.

We wrap up.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
