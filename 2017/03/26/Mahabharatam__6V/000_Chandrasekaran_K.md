Respected Scholars

  

I am trying to locate the following verse which I am told occurs in mahabharata in a conversation between Duryodhana and Krishna.

  

जानामि धर्मं न च मे प्रवृत्ति:

जानामि अधर्मं न च मे निवृत्ति:

हृतिस्थित हृशीकेश यथा नियुक्तोसि तथा करोमि

  

I will appreciate any help in finding its location, in which parva, which adyhyaya, which schloka. I have not so far been able to locate it in critical edition of mahabharata.

  

Thans very much in advance.

  

Chandrasekaran
