Dear Scholars,

Could you please enlighten me with the technical meaning of the word 'कण्ठोक्ति’. This word occurs at many places including the Tribhashyaratna commentary on the Taittiriya Pratisakhya (6.3, 6.5 and 8.16) and the Bharadvajasiksha (final verse). I, however, never found any statement in the sastra that clarifies the meaning of this word. On an online dictionary I found the meaning as "speaking of or enumerating one by one". I hope the traditional scholars would address my query.

  

Also, there is a verse in the शम्भुशिक्षा which I am unable to interpret. This is as follows--

काण्डानुक्रमतो ह्यादौ जटायां दृश्यते यथा।

अलोपलोपकार्याणि त्रिपदादौ तथोत्तरम्॥ शम्भुशिक्षा 23

It would be a great help if anyone could help me to understand this verse.

  

Regards,

Deepro.
