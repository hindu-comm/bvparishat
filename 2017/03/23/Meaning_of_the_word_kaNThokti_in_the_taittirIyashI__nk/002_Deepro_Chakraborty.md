Dear Prof. Deshpande,

Thank you so much for your elaborate answer. I think I understand this now. The explicit verbalization or explicit listing of certain Vedic words in the Prātiśākhya / śikṣā text is called‘*kaṇṭhokti*’.

I just want to clarify my understanding bringing another technical term here. There is a term called *‘grahaṇa’* often used in the Taittirīya Śikṣā-Prātiśākhya literature. Whitney suggests the translation of this word as ‘citation’ or ‘cited word’. He further explains—“The term *grahaṇa* is used… in the sense of ‘citation, word taken or extracted from the *Saṃhitā* to be made the subject of some prescription’ (root *grah*, ‘seize, take’).”Are these terms *‘ka**ṇṭ**hokti’* and *‘graha**ṇ**a’* synonymous?

Regards,

Deepro.
