Dear Deepro,

  

  Whitney's understanding of the term grahaṇa seems to be correct in the context. This is similar to the use of the term by Kātyāyana in his Vārttika: सवर्णेऽण्ग्रहणमपरिभाष्यमाकृतिग्रहणात्. Here the term "aṇ-grahaṇa" refers to the explicit mention of "aṇ" in Pāṇini's sūtra: अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्यय:. Kātyāyana is proposing that if "a" in the Śivasūtra "a i u ṇ" is taken to refer to avarṇa-ākṛti "class property of all 'a' sounds", then we do not need to include "aṇ" in the rule अणुदित्सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्यय:, since all varieties of "a", differing in length, nasality and accent, will be naturally covered, without a specific rule. But, elsewhere in Kātyāyana's Vārttikas, the term grahaṇa refers not to direct mention or listing, but coverage. For instance, Kātyāyana says that without the marker "t" attached to "ā" in वृद्धिरादैच्, this "ā" will not cover its homogeneous varieties (savarṇa), because "ā" is not an "aṇ" sound, since it is not listed in the Śivasūtra: आकारस्य तपरकरणं सवर्णार्थम्, आकारेण सवर्णाग्रहणम् अनण्त्वात्. Here the term सवर्णाग्रहणम् refers to non-coverage or non-inclusion of homogeneous varieties, rather than explicit listing or citation. Therefore, while the grahaṇa is similar to kaṇṭhokti in some contexts, this is not the case in other contexts.
