Dear Deepro,

  

Reading the Tribhāṣyaratna on Taittirīya-Prātiśākhya (6.3), it seems to me that the word kaṇṭhokti refers to explicit verbalization of forms listed in the rule (i.e. asadāma and asiñcan). The "s" in these forms, under certain conditions changes to "ṣ". The commentary cites the form "nyaṣadāma". The commentary raises the question as to the necessity of explicitly listing these two forms in the rule. Can this outcome be achieved by a more generic rule (nanu lāghavād akāravyaveto 'pītyetāvataivālam, kaṇṭḥoktyā kim), and what is the need to explicitly list these two forms? The commentary provides an answer (ucyate, "hṛtsvaso mayābhūn" ityādau mā bhūditi): Such an explicit listing (kaṇṭhokti) is necessary, because a general rule will over-extend "ṣatva" to other instances, where we don't want it. The cited example is "hṛtsvaso mayābhūn". Here, in the sequence "hṛtsvaso", a generic rule (akāravyaveto'pi) will require "ṣatva" of "s" in "aso" coming after "hṛtsu". To avoid the over-extension of general rule, the commentary says that the TP prefers to explicitly list the specific forms where the "ṣatva" takes place.
