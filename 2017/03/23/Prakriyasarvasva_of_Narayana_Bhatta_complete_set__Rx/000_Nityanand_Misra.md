Dear list,

  

There are many books on DLI with parts of Prakriyasarvasva (Part I, Part II, Part III, Taddhita prakarana, etc). I do not know if a complete set of any edition exists. I can download all and check, but wondering if somebody has done it already and has a list of titles which form a complete set.

  

I am particularly interested in the svara-prakarana of the work.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
