Namaste



1. Thanks for sharing this series of lectures and speaker taking reference to the ‘ chaturanga –kreeda - ashva gati’ discussed in Samskruth tradition.



2. An interesting question to explore here:



What might have been the reason for Indian Sanskritists to get heavily addicted to the ‘ Literature – Philosophy’ ( Kavya –Vedanta ) and leave behind the \< Ganitha- Tarka> based applications ? I am aware of the ‘ chitrabnadhas, yantra structures, magical squares and the rangavalli structures’ ; but where did thie teaching –learning-researching tradition go underground ?



Regards
