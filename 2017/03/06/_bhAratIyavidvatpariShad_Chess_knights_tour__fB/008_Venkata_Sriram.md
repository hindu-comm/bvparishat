Namaste Sastry ji,

  

You have rightly observed. We have lost a brilliant technique for mathematical calculations called "akSa-vidya". This is the tool which is used for fast mathematical calculations. Some 75 years ago, there used to be a scholar who was master in this and could count number of leaves in a particular branch of a tree and no. of grains in the handful of rice. A great exponent of yoga shastra and akSa-vidya. He was a dEvi-vara-prasAda to his parents. However, after his passing away, the tradition is lost. 

  

reg,

sriram
