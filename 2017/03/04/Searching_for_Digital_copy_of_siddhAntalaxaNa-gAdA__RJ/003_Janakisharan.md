Respected Sir,  
I did not got the Siddhanta laksana Gadadhari/Jagadishi, but I got the Front and Inner page of this book. It has published by Rashtirya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati. I am attaching the photograph of the Cover & inner pages. I think this book is now out of publication.  
  
  
If someone have digital copy of this book, they can share if copyright permits.  
  
Regards  
  
Janakisharan Acharya
