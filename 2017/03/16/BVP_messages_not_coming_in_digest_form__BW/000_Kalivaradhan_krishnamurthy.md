HariH OM!

  

NamaskaraH

  

I have been getting BVP messages so far in digest form.

  

But now for couple of days I am getting individual messages and not in digest form.

  

I have not changed my settings but find this very annoying and my displays per page does not allow quick glance of other messages in my inbox.

  

Kindly help me resolve this problem.

  

Is it peculiar to me only or other members are also facing similar problems.

  

DhanyavadaH
