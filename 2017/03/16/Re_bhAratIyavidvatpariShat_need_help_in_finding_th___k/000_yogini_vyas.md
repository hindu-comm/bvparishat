Pierre Sylvain Filliozat in the book "The Sanskrit Language an Overview" writes these two lines:

1\) page 103 - "The Natyashastra....recommends for the theatre a language 'devoid of obscure words and meanings, which is easily appreciated by the common people'

2\) page 104 - The poetician Bhaamaha speaks of clarity of language in Sanskrit poetry, in other words 'poetry whose meaning is understood by all, from scholars to

  women and children'.

  

I will appreciate any help in identifying the original sanskrit lines/text which Filliozat is referring to in his statements.
