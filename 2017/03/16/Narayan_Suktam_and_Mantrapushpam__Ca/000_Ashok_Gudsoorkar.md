Respected Scholars,  
We are in a position to refer and study Texts and many Commentaries on Suktas in Rigveda like: Purush Suktam, Sri Suktam, Devi Suktam, Bhagya Suktam etc.  
  
However, I am not in a position to find any good English or Marathi commentaries on Narayan Sukta and Mantra Pushpam(probably from Yajurveda), widely recited in Southern India on many occasions.  
  
I shall be grateful, if you can suggest me any good English or Marathi Commentary with links/PDF/Publication details. Thanks.
