A book is not Scaned twice Sometimes what ones scans may be the only accessible copy of book.  
  
One can see IFLA guidelines here  
  
<https://www.ifla.org/files/assets/rare-books-and-manuscripts/rbms-guidelines/guidelines-for-planning-digitization.pdf>  
  
Please National Mission for Manuscripts Guideline. The same guidelines can be modified and used for books

It always ideal to scan at 600 DPi color and bind the images together. The images have to be tiff images to keep compression loss at the minimal. Jpg is good for palm leaves as sometimes one may have to use image editor to change contrast or increase visibilaty of scripts.One can optimize pdf using different optimizing techniques provided one has the original scanned images. Simply compressing pdfs will reduce DPi and make the scan quality low. When books are scanned for preservation never mind the size it should be at least 600 DPi color.  
  
One can see what a mess DLI has done for several books using Scan Taylor software indiscriminately. Image curvature is fine but one should not get eye pain while reading online.  
  
What Hari prasadji has done is good keeping in mind the scanner and time at disposal he has.Expecting a lot more rare books from him
