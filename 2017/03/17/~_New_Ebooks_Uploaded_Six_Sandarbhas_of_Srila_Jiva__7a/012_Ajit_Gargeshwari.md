When the original itself from photocopies are of lower quality how can re scanning photo copies help in increasing image quality.  
Its best to avoid repeated photocopying . One doesn't get high enough DPI while photocopying that is why its scanned or photographed. Its not a book where one photocopies a chapter and reads. By a book I mean a book where the pages have not turned brittle. If you feel a scan is huge file covert the scan document to images and use Scan Taylor software Scan taylor does compress images to a large extent.  

If scanning for archival purposes, that is, to capture the artifactual information of the manuscript I am talking about Palm leaf not printed paper

24-bit, 150 dpi which can lead to file sizes of 3 MB per image  

If there 300 leaves then it will around 900 MB  
  

Please see the attachment where there pictures shown
