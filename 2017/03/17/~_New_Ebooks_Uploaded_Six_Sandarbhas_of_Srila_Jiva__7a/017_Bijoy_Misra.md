Dr. Ajit,  
  
That was 1994. We created wavelet algorithm to segment and compress.  

Pattern matching was done through higher order software like IDL, that  

was borrowed from the space programs. My personal goal was to  
bring the specimen resource material to the classroom. We had to be extra  
careful on the lens, light, resolution and bit-packing. The library system  
proceeded to digitize many different scripts like Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew,  
Russian etc. The system was later incorporated into various other scanning  
and imaging systems. I moved on to microscope imaging. You can check  
local CDAC in India who may have developed composite systems. They  

could be in use in various efforts.  
  

I wanted to collect old palm leaf manuscripts in Orissa, but have not  

moved on the project. The local Govt there is not very language-friendly!  
  

Let me not say any further.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
