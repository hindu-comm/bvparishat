Thanks for bringing these up.  I taught courses on these when we proposed  

digitization at Harvard in the '90s. Some of the algorithms we created for  
real time processing have been incorporated in various digitizing engines.  

Mostly they have to do with creating a real time noise filter sensing the background  

information and subtracting it out at pixel patterns. More advanced processing  

would involve segmentation and further local processing. Image compression  

through packing was done since memory was expensive those days.  

We proceeded to medical, art and music etc. I am delighted to hear  

of the discussion.
