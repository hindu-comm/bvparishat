Thank you Prof. Deshpande, Ajay Krishna Prabhu, Nakulsinh Gohil ji, Niranjan Saha ji, Prof. Sunil Bhattacharjya and other vidvans who liked and downloaded the book.  
  

Your kind words of encouragement encourage me in my efforts to scan books for the pleasure of the vidvaj-janas.  
  

Sunil ji, my initial plan was to scan in B/W TIFF's in order to reduce the overall size. However, the paper quality on which these sandarbhas were printed was extremely low. Ink on one side of the paper often showed up on the other side. Perhaps these were all printed on Government subsidized paper. I was afraid of even turning pages in these books due to the fact that the pages would tear so easily.  
  

When I scanned as B/W TIFF, the quality came out very poor (see attached image for sample). I did not want to give this quality to the vidvat-samāja. It would be a disservice not only to Sri Jiva Goswami but also to the translator Sri Haridas Shastri. Therefore i decided to go full color, even if it takes more space. The PDF size is slightly greater for today, but after a few years, these sizes will probably be not so great.  
  

I am personally very happy that the most important effort of Sri Haridas Shastriji's life has been preserved for the current and future generations. I hope that he will be pleased with me.  
  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  

hari parshad das.
