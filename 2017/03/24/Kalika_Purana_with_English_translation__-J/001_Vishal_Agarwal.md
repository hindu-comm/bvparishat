I have uploaded the English translation of the Kalika Purana at the link below. This will be active only for a week.

For the Ganesha Purana, the only existing translation by Greg Bailey in two volumes was republished by MLBD recently. It is not available online. I have a softcopy of only the first volume (please write to me offline). Recently, Nag Publishers came out with a very good Hindi translation which I prefer.  

  

Please write to me offline.
