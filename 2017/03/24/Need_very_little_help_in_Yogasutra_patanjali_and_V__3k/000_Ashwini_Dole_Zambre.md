Respected all

I m a student of philosophy in Savitribai Phule Pune University.

I am unable to find the the difference for the Yoga sutra no.2 i.e योगश्चित्तवृत्तीनिरोधः\|2\|\| from Patanjal yog sutra.. I know the meaning what Patanjali said but I want to know what VedVyasa means for the same and Vachaspati Mishra also in Tattva Vaisaradi..

Pls help..

I read some marathi texts but philosophical words make me confused.
