Dear Sri  
Shivaraj Singh,  
I think I  
know where you are coming from.  
You probably consider that the  
theory that south Indian languages belong to a different  
family of languages ( which is given the name Dravidian  
family of languages) than the family of languages to which  
Sanskrit, Prakrit(s) and north Indian languages belong to be  
an invalid theory and a western conspiracy.  
But as long as you can not come up  
with a new theory that can explain the facts that are  
explained by the theories of Dravidian and Indoeuropean  
families, there is no point in harping on the theory that  
all Indian languages come from Sanskrit.  
I can help you understand the  
reasoning through which these theories are arrived  
at.  
If you have /  
develop a strong counter to that reasoning, then you may  
publish it and get it accepted in the academic  
circles.  
Until then,  
the theory that south Indian languages have no genetic  
connection with Sanskrit, shall stay.  
  
================================  
Some points :  
  
a) Prakrit grammars have a fourfold division of words (pada) into: naman(noun), akhyata (verb), etc.  
  
b) In Tamil the four classes of words are : peyarssol (name word), vinaissol (act-word), etc. The first is a literal translation of the Sanskrit nama(pada), the second is for kriya; akhyata being , apparently, untranslatable in Tamil.  
  
Pada occurs in all these works as the term for a word. Furthermore in Talkappiyam, moli==word, being a translation of pada is used. In the Nannul, pada is preferred, sol with the sense of word is also used.  
  
If we come to phonetics in Tolkappiyam a vowel is call uyir, that is, breath, or life. In Sanskrit grammars a svara (or sara in Pali) is used for a vowel. This word is obvioulsy the original of uyir; svara means sound and breath also.  
  
Why so much similarity in grammars if these two languages do not share a genetic origin?
