Dear Sri Shivaraj Singh,

  

What you attempt to point out is the possible influence of Sanskrit / Prakrit grammatical categories on the grammatical categories in Tolkappiyam.

  

That should not be called similarity in grammars.

  

A grammar book of a language is not its grammar. Grammar of a language is the structural and functional rules /norms according to which the language works.

  

The theorists who proposed the idea of Dravidian family of languages and its lack of genetic connection with Sanskrit, were showing differences between the languages they grouped as Dravidian family and Sanskrit in terms of the structural and functional rules /norms according to which the languages work.

  

Similarly phonology of a language does not mean words such as svara and uir. It is the phones and phonemes available in the Des'ya core of the language, the phonemic distribution( i.e. which phones/phonemes of the language occur in which positions of words in which sequence etc.) , in the language etc.

  

At the level of grammar and phonology too, there were a huge number of similarities found among those Indian languages which were classified into different families by them. Then they came up with the theory of 'mutual influence among all Indian languages' leading to such Indian common features among all these languages and gave the name 'convergence' to it. This is discussed in the book" India as a linguistic area" (19560) by M B Emeneau.
