Namaste

  

Here is a news item on the studies about life during the time of Jesus Christ. 

  

<http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/archaeologists-shine-light-on-life-in-the-time-of-christ/article17548175.ece>  

  

This raises some questions as to whether in India too attempts could be made to dig up more information about life during even the past 800 or 1000 years, especially the period of the three Acharyas. 

  

Scholars who have worked in this area may offer their opinions, suggestions, etc. on this topic.
