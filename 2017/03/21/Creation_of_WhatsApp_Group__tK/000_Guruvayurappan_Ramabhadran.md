Dear Group members,  
  
Humble PranƒÅms. To reduce flood of emails and to effectively discuss and track contents, shall we migrate towards some other messaging platform like WhatsApp, which I presume most of us use. This helps in discussing or giving explanations verbally too.  
  
This gives us manageable inbox and at the same time not to miss any Samskriti information. In the WhatsApp group also, We should confine ourselves with the same objective.  
  
Please ponder over and suggest. Requesting the admin of bvparishat to consider the idea and acknowledge. Thanks in advance.  
  
Ram Ram.  
  
Regards  
Guru
