Dear students and doctoral scholars,  
  

As you are aware, भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् is a wonderful, resourceful platform to learn and understand issues dealing with shaastra and ancient Indian knowledge systems and traditions. Perhaps, this is one of the best online forums to satisfactorily answer any sort of question related to shaastra, with the generous and affectionate contributions of scholars of repute, by sparing their 'valuable time.'  
  

As a UG/PG student or research scholar you might have questions related to your subject or the topic on which you work presently.  
  
This is a cordial invitation from us to interact with the participating scholars to put forth such queries related to your project/research topic/dissertation/hypothesis or even an article/paper that you thought to be published.  
  
You can post your queries in Sanskrit/Hindi/English. You are also free to join discussions on other threads of your interest.  
  

वादे वादे जायते तत्त्वबोधः । We would love to see your posts and listen from you, more frequently here!  
  

Best wishes,  

Moderators
