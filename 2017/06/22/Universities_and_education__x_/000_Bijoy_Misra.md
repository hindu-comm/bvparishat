Dear friends,  

As you might know, the entire education system in the west was developed to protect  

the western ideas and "educate" the population in order to uproot them from their tradition.  

A new wave is entering through Canada to restore the tradition. Since the Indian education  
system has been modeled with the western view, I thought this news item in today's New York Times could be of interest to some. I am sharing.
