Namaste

  

Could anyone please help me with the full form of the verse with the words:

  

मोदन्ते पितरः नृत्यन्ते पितामहाः...  I think it says that when a person becomes a sannyasin, his ancestors of seven generations become liberated. I searched with those words but could not find any useful lead.  

  

Thanks
