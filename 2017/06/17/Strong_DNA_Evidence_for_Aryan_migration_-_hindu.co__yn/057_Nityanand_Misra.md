I have known and interacted in personal capacity with both Prof. Paturi and Vishvas Vasuki for some time. They are both well-meaning people and it is unfortunate this discussion has turned acrimonious.

  

Vishvas is to be complimented for his unflinching faith in scientific evidence. No doubt, scientific evidence cannot be denied. However, I am not sure if there is anybody on this forum who understands genetics and statistics well enough to critically evaluate the summary of the research findings as quoted from the Manasataramgini (MT) blog. I can evaluate the statistical aspects of the studies but I do not know genetics well enough. A cross-domain expert is needed. Vishvas did try to get in Dr. David Reich last year, but there was perhaps no response.

  

Aravind Iyer (the suspected author of MT) seems to be an expert, but ... and this is a big but, he can make mistakes. For example, he seems to be well-versed in Sanskrit, but makes a basic schoolboy error [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/about/) in saying that taraMgiNI is Sanskrit for waves. As any dictionary including the Amara Kosha would tell the reader, *taraṅgiṇī* is Sanskrit for river, and not waves. This example shows that a review matters, even more so in the field of science. I would have no problem in taking on face value a publication by Iyer in a journal, but I would not blindly trust an informal piece of writing (like a blog) by him. Unfortunately, his anonymity and some incredulous claims on the his MT blog like his sites have been hacked by somebody who impersonates him on multiple social media platforms do not help matters. I think this is what Prof. Paturi had in mind when he called the blog a gospel: I too cannot put my blind faith in it.

  

Having said that, Vishvas does seem to be more conversant with the AIT versions and literature than Prof. Paturi. It is natural given Vishvas's background in applied science. If Prof. Paturi has inadvertently misrepresented anything, Vishvas can certainly correct him without the acrimony. I am sure Prof. Paturi, like most people in this forum, are open to being corrected. This is not to be seen as a victory or calling a bluff, nor it should be seen as a defeat. I hope Vishvas restates his positions and summarizes the thread, without the acrimony, for the benefit of all.

  

As for me, I am not interested in contributing to the discussion in this thread, since anything that is said in these matters has the potential of opening a can of worms and leads to a loss of time (which I am terribly short of).
