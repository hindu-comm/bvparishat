Dear V Murthy, There is no need to guess about Parsi people and religion. There are inscriptions ofkings of Persian empire of the know historyin Iran. They are printed in books. One has to go to library and search. History of Hurrians, Mitanni, Celtic (god Aryamna brother of Indra) are available. I had written in the past on BVP many more details.

Dear Kalicharan, Thanks for mentioning my name in connection with this subject. History of Hittite (Troy) is available. History of Turkish people (Vrika-wolf people) is available. Mahabharata Kuru Kula was part of Vrika Kula of the sage Atri. NRJOSHI
