\> what a thing to be proud of, and what a contrast with stories of raghu's digvijaya which included the huNa-s and persia!

  

true!

  

since the stories of Raghu's digvijaya speak of an east to west movement and Sri Vasuki-ji wants to take pride in the Aryan invasion from west to east which is now believed by the 'top' not to have occurred at all as invasion but is believed to have occurred as 'migration' by the same 'top' ! What an upamaanauchitya! What a lakhya suited to the lakshaNa under discussion!
