Namaste

  

There is another research on Konkan Brahmins and Central Asian ancestry. Some are saying they are Crypto Jews.

"... non-recombining uniparental contributions in Chitpavan-brahmin Mediterranean or East European type as shown by 20% (HV, U3) mtDNA lineages and highly frequent (R1a and L) Y-haplogroups. The admixture and PC analyses reflected genetic association of Chitpavan-brahmin with Iranian, Ashkenazi-Jews (Turkey), Greeks (East Europe) and to some extent with Central Asian Turkish populations elucidating their distinct Nordic, “Scytho-Iranian” ancestry." -----------*abstract from the research paper of Sonali Gaikwad and VK Kashyap.
