I don't think that there is "the" story - rather there are many possible stories which fit the data (from AIT perspective).I know for sure that some interested people I know don't think

that the miTTAni are the invaders

.

 The invasion likely happened in multiple waves. For example:

-   "We suspect that similarly there were multiple waves of
    Indo-European invasions into India. Most of these were waves were
    Indo-Aryans or at best Iranians, though there might have
    additionally even been a kentum type non-Indo-Iranian wave – sort of
    a mirror image of the western branch of Indo-Aryans (Mittani
    superstrate) that appeared in West Asia \[Footnote 2\]. We discern
    several such waves based on Indo-Aryan literary tradition: 1) The
    pa\~nchajana (who may have come in more than one wave); 2) the
    ikShvAku (these two are early waves); 3) the shalva-s; 4) the
    pANDava-s"
