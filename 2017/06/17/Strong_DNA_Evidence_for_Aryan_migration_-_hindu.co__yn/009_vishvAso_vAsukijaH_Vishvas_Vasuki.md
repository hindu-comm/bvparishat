Yes, I agree. But this reaction is based in folly and a sad sign of our current intellectual state. One can quite easily be a abhimAni hindu, accept evidence in favor of AIT and repudiate enemy narratives(just think of the great patriot bAlagangAdhara TiLak). We don't even need to be apologetic about any Aryan Invasion, dominance and consolidation (quite the opposite - we can derive pride in it and explore exactly why such stunning success came to pass) - all we have to do is reject the fake equivalence of Aryan invasion with the genocidal invasions of the mlecCha-s in India, the America-s and Australia (which is exactly what PV kANe did - never spilt any ink propping OIT up AFAIK).

  

Furthermore, वीरभोग्या वसुन्धरा - nature does not care for moral justifications like "oh we're unjust victims of atrocious foreign dominance. we never did such a thing to others". That's so defeatist and pitiable (besides being false). Who are we trying to convince? Does the Pakistani or Chinese nationalist waste any breath justifying his aggression or defense on some inane theory of moral superiority?

No I don't.

Oh -



"We Hindus never invaded anyone" isone of the things I expect to hear whenever I start discussing with a nice old uncle - often in an attempt to establish moral superiority relative to muslims and christian colonists (with no reference to global scale) :-)  
  
what a thing to be proud of, and what a contrast with stories of raghu's digvijaya which included the huNa-s and persia! Well, at least if this OIT delusion dies, they can reverse this attitude. So, \*that\* is the connection, even if no language issue is being referenced in such statements.

Regarding Dean's two points:

  

"1) Genetics does not deterministically identify languages or cultures. Following Michael Witzel's dictum that, "pots don't speak", we can say that "genes don't speak" either."

  

True, it's not deterministic - yet it is highly correlated, and that's sufficient.  

  

"2) Unless there's been a major revolution that I missed (which is possible), these genetic studies don't allow a very accurate dating like "sometime around 2,000 BC – 1,500 BC"."



Yes, apparently, his knowledge of the state of genetic studies is quite outdated ( a pic <https://imgur.com/B8QB5zS>). Top geneticists and journals are not pulling stuff out of some 2005 era data.
