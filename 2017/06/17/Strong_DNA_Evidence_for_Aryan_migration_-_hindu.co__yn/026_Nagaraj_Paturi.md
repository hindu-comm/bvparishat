Dear Sri Venkatesh Murty-ji,

  

Parsi religion is nothing but Zoroastrianism which is also called Avestan religion. Its close connection with Vedic 'religion' is very well known and well established.

  

In Mitanni what you see is some sparse connections.

  

Whereas in Parsi/Zoroastrian/ Avestan religion the relationships with Vedic are abundant.
