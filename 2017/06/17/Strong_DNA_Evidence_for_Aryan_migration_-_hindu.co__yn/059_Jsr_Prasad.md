Sri Vishwas,  
  

दुस्तर्कात् सुविरम्यतां श्रुतिमतस्तर्कोsनुसन्धीयताम् । You have crossed all limits of propriety and courtesy in insulting the elders and others. Knowing good English and involving in pure vitaNDA is not the criteria of a good scholarship. You are under moderation now.  
  

No more posts in thread please.
