Nagraj-ji,

  

What Vasuki has presented here (going by the snippet he shared) is very interesting – indeed something that no Yavana scholar has professed to date – yet is the only possible scenario if AIT were to be really true.

I think this thesis should be discussed more freely on BVP (since Yavana-s have not shown the requisite moral/ intellectual honesty).

I think the propounder should come on BVP and shed lights on it. Personally I have clarity on my own stand (and know where someone may go wrong) stated earlier in this thread, but I am sure the proposed Iranian origins (near but not quite the Indo-Afgan region) of this Dharmika branch could be of some interest to someone like Dr N R Joshi.

  

Thanks

KT
