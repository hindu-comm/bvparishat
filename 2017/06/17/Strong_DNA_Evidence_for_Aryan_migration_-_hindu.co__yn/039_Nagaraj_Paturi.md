All has not fallen apart. This is only a middle of the course reminder. There is a lot in the previous posts.that has not been answered from the gospel. There are no Ad Hominem comments made against Sei Vishvas-ji. It was a reminder of a previous post about the source of Sri Vishvas-ji. Ad Hominem means attacking the person. Revealing the personal information that is kept hidden by the author of the source is not called Ad Hominem.
