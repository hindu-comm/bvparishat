I did not mean to suggest that it be taken as historical record. Just as a study in contrasting attitudes towards aggression on our part.

Why did you forget Finnish?

-   "In The Indo-Iranian Substratum, Alexander Lubatsky points out that
    the oldest borrowings into Finno-Ugric (FU) are from IA and not IIr.
    The speakers of FU didn’t live in the vicinity of India. Their
    contacts with the IE speakers happened further to the West. If OIT
    were correct then one must expect IIr speakers to have constituted
    the vanguard in the westward out flux from India and transmitted
    loan words into FU. It would’ve resulted in the attestation of IIr
    loans in the oldest strata of FU. However, that is not the case. The
    loan words in the oldest strata are from IA which suggests that they
    were directly transmitted from IA to
    FU."\[[KV16](https://kalavaivenkat.wordpress.com/2016/05/07/musings-on-ait-genetics-and-accusations-of-racism/)\]
