The time period under question is not the 'Mahabharata time'. or Ikshvaku time etc.

  

The AIT theorists try to connect the Mitanni date and the date given by them to the earliest Vedic 'compositions' through migration now and invasion previously.

  

The 'Veerabhoktas' of the Indian part of the Vasundharaa as a descendant of whom Sri Vishvas-ji wants to feel proud , if belong to a different time period than this, are not related to this dot-connecting at all.

  

Only if these Veerabhoktas of India, coming from outside India, belong to a date earlier than the the date given by the 'top' to the earliest Vedic 'compositions, it becomes part of AIT debate. Otherwise, these Veerabhoktas should be considered as the Bhoktas of the Vasundharaa already having the Vedas prior to their arrival.
