Namaste Venkateshji,

  

The Hindu article clearly has ill-motive as you can see from the last paragraph of the article, especially note the last line "What is abundantly clear is that we are a multi-source civilization, not a single-source one, drawing its cultural impulses, its tradition and practices from a variety of lineages and migration histories. The Out of Africa immigrants, the pioneering, fearless explorers who discovered this land originally and settled in it and whose lineages still form the bedrock of our population; those who arrived later with a package of farming techniques and built the Indus Valley civilization whose cultural ideas and practices perhaps enrich much of our traditions today; those who arrived from East Asia, probably bringing with them the practice of rice cultivation and all that goes with it; those who came later with a language called Sanskrit and its associated beliefs and practices and reshaped our society in fundamental ways; and those who came even later for trade or for conquest and chose to stay, all have mingled and contributed to this civilization we call Indian. We are all migrants."

  

AIT, not original inhabitant, is a theory which was refuted many times over by many and now its just being represented by replacing the word invasion with migration. The confusing jargon printed in the article is meant to misguide the readers to think that author "connect the dots" knowing the research well. That is completely untrue. Moreover, the author makes a convenient jump on Sanskrit, based on the 17.5% of the male lineage showing the Y-chromosomal spread! As for the research paper, some find the research funding itself suspect; I leave that to your discretion. The research conclusion also begs the question: whatever happened to this Aryan civilisation with its language that left no trace at its origin?

  

Finally, to quote Raj Vedam ji (from IHAR, <http://www.iharweb.org/>) who counters these kinds of theories meant to attack the Ancient Indian heritage: these kind of people use the spotty y-chromosomal data because the maternal mtDNA tells a strong opposing story and the invading men spreading their DNA sporadically is no indication of migration. However, the a woman's presence in the DNA record indicates permanence. Further, he says that the y-chromosome is withered, shrunk, bombarded with the mutation debris of relentless evolution over thousands of years and might become extinct in time (as is debated in scientific circles) when the gender itself will be determined by some other segment of the DNA!
