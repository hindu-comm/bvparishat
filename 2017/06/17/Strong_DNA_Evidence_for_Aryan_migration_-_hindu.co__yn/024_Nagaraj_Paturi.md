Borrowings are a different story than direct genetic linguistic relation. Mitannni (more precisely Hittite ) language and Avestan are considered to have a direct genetic relation with the Vedic in as much as all the three are considered to be descendants of proto-Indo-European.

  

Finno-Ugric is a different language family without any genetic relation with the Vedic or Avstan or Mitanni (Hittite).
