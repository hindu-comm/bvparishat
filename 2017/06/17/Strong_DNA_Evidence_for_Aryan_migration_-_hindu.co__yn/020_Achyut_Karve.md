Dear friends,

Good point Bijoy Misraji.  Moreover migration in itself proves nothing vis a vis the vedic language. If for a minute we grant that the orign of the Vedic language is outside India is it not the responsibility of those propounding the theory to tell why the vedic language became extinct in the land of its origin. This reminds me of Ptolmey who not being in a position to conceive of a rotating earth made the whole sky revolve round the earth. According to our tradition words are said to be नित्य this goes with the rider that the permanence is in the land of their origin. In addition many of the letters of the Vedic language are not to be seen elsewhere outside India on the other hand all the letters and many words are used in Modern Indian Languages. Is it not a mystery that Sanskrit Pandits, Vidvans and scholars fall such an easy prey to the ideas proposed by vested interests in the West just because there are references to descriptions of foreign lands in the scriptures. What could be more natural than India being the birth place or orign of the Vedas.

Achyut Karve.
