\> In other words, beyond doubt, you were confidently misrepresenting AIT scholarship and fooling yourself and this list.

  

My sanskaara lies in not being provoked to use a similar rash language against you.

  

\> Better be more thoughtful and careful as shrI bijoy rightly suggests. Do better homework.

  

-- Prof. Bijoy Mishra's message was specifically addressed to you.

  

What more could I have expected from someone who sticks to the invasion view which has been replaced by migration and who argues that वीरभोग्या वसुन्धरा - nature does not care for moral justifications and who wants to take pride as a descendant of invaders from outside India and who says does the Pakistani or Chinese nationalist waste any breath justifying his aggression or defense on some inane theory of moral superiority? (implying that morals have no place in veerabhojana of any land)

  

With the hope that the list by now realized who is leading the list to morally unscrupulous invasionism and who is trying to keep the insider's view of the Vedas and the Vedic culture tuned to academic studies, I withdraw from this rantful conversation that does not spare even respectful elders and calls them to be living in fantasy universe and so on.
