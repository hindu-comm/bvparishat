नमस्ते,

  

A stupid friend is more dangerous than a clever enemy. Unfortunately there is no dearth of the friendlies in India (and in NRI community), the author of The Hindu article being one. The controversial newspaper continues to hold sway (terror) over IAS aspirants who perforce consume its outpourings in order to clear the coveted exam.

  

To people who can exercise their brains some points have become clear now:

  

1) Yavana-s have accepted by now that IE homeland is not in Europe (rules out Greeks, Nordics etc permanently).

2) The question is then between central/west Asia vs. South Asia (Afgan-India region).

Further, R1a is patrilinear, so **this rules out migration**: there was an **invasion** either from west Asia to south-east Asia or from the south-east Asia to the west Asia.

3) The R1a subgroups common to central and south-east Asia shows more diversity in south Asia. This is called the “founder’s effect” according to which the origin point of a species is likely in the place where it has a greater diversity. So, India satisfies this criterion.

  

From Yavanas’ point-of-view, therefore, finding a workaround answer to 3) is of utmost importance. One way is to suggest that multiple people came to India in multiple timelines. But this goes against economy of ideas. It is like saying **someone spraying bullets on a crowd and only one person in the crowd getting hit by all the bullets.**

  

4) There is also no explanation of presence of high levels of R1a in many tribes of India (which includes north-eastern and southern tribes of India); with continued focus on propaganda, there never will be.
