You're mistaken about claims made about the origin of the vedic language: The dominant ancestor of vedic (proto indo-iranian -> proto indo european) language and religion came from outside, not the "late" vedic language.

Same applies to the above as well. When rephrased to refer to the ancestor of vaidika religion, this question makes more sense and gains importance. A relevant excerpt:

"Why were the Lithuanian heathens most successful in holding out against the Christian steamroller?" \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/some-notes-on-the-heathen-lithuania-and-its-demise/)\]

-   "The answer we present is related to the unusual archaism of their
    language and potentially religion. Thus, we posit that they were in
    many ways parallel to the Hindus. The Hindus were remarkably
    successful in preserving their Indo-Aryan archaism and their now
    withering Iranian cousins in preserving their Avestan traditions in
    face of several assaults. This relates to a well-developed ritualist
    caste with a powerful oral tradition and specifically a
    grammatically tradition that allowed preservation of the language,
    especially in ritual, close to its old Indo-European state. While
    this was potentially ancestral to the Indo-Europeans as suggested by
    the Roman ritualist guild, the combination with a rigorous
    grammatically oriented oral tradition is clearly attested best in
    the Indo-Aryans and then the Iranians \[Notably, of the local Indian
    languages Tamil, a non-Aryan language, was the next best in its
    preservation of archaic tradition in India precisely because it
    adopted the Aryan linguistic methodology very early in its
    history\]. Hence, we hypothesize that the Lithuanians had such a
    tradition which approached the Indo-Iranian state to certain degree
    \[Totally contra-Rowell, who rather idiotically asserts that
    Germanic, Slav and Balt pagans built shrines to imitate Christians!
    A sign of how deep-rooted Abrahamistic prejudices are in academia\].
    ... In support of this we have evidence from whatever scraps of
    information survive regarding the heathen Lithuanian state that they
    had a well-organized ritualist guild along with the duchy elite with
    whom they intermarried – a parallel to the brahma-kṣatra elite of
    the
    Hindus."\[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/some-notes-on-the-heathen-lithuania-and-its-demise/)\]

Indeed, one must favor the most parsimonious explanation. I wonder who's Ptolmey here?
