Dear Viswas,  

While I respect what you are saying, this statement is erroneous. Most postings are thoughtful  

and are individually created with previously unseen arguments. Lately however superficiality is  
increasing and discussion is entering into trivia.  

Since you are good in what you do, let me suggest to you to start working on a review paper  

with the title "The origin of the Vedic Language". It would be productive on your part. Don't copy  
from anywhere, be independent. Read the original. Reflect hard and analyze. Give it a year.  

Best wishes,  

BM
