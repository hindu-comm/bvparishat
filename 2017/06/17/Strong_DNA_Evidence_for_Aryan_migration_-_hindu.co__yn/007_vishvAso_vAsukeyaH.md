It's been quite clear for a while now (in paper after paper). I am tempted to remind this list of this thread -<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/A$20summary$20of$20Aryan%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/yUHi_V9tS8Y/JQYS_y8PCgAJ>
.  
  
There's some thoroughly confused denial here:<https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/genetics-might-be-settling-the-aryan-migration-debate-but-not-how-left-liberals-believe> (See <https://twitter.com/guNagarbhaH/status/876978373632958464> for a hint of why) . It's all well and good to keep waiting on Indian aDna, but at the very least the reasonable should stop spreading their "conviction" that AIT is baseless and OIT is historically more tenable - and perhaps start preparing for an alternative to the "we hindus never invaded anyone" type stories which sadly stem from misunderstanding and insecurity.
