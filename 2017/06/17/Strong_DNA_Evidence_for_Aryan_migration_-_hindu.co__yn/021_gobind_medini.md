I do not know whether we can take Raghu's digvijaya as a historical record. However, Aryan migration, whether from India or towards India cannot be refuted because Indo-Aryan (IA) linguistic evidence is available in three regions remotely located from each other: (1) India (Vedic IA), (2) Iran (Avestan IA), and (3) Syria (Mitanni IA). The last evidence is the oldest (1400BC) concrete evidence. Interestingly, according to linguistic experts the Vedic and Mitanni IA which are separated from each other by a longer physical distance are closer to each other linguistically than Avestan IA.  
  
The spread of Hinduism (including Buddhism) is not through invasion except with the possible exception of Rajendra Chola-I of Tamil Nadu. However, both Hinduism-Buddhism (particularly, the latter) had spread in South East Asia much before the said Chola aggression (11th century) without invasion or force. This is a unique phenomenon. Various explanations are available, all of them may be true to various degrees. However, this spread (even taking into account possible Chola exception) will have to be distinguished from forceful or coercive proselytizing spread of other religions.  
  

Ultimately everything boils down to types and degrees. For example, one or two temples might had been destroyed by the so called Hindu kings, but usually the secular apologist of other proselytizing religions invariably use this example to suggest that temple and icon destruction has happened in all religions forgetting that icon worship has never been resisted in Hinduism.. while this was the case in most of the other religions.  
  

At the moment, what needs to be remembered without bothering about these theories is to remember the IA contribution (not as a racial group but as a multi-thread linguistic group) to the culture of India by way of Sanskrit language and its literature, linguistic theories, philosophical and theological schools, astronomy, and mathematics. Further, IA contribution is not only by way of Sanskrit but also by IA-Prakrit languages like Pali, ardha-Magadhi. This contribution is made by accepting the local deities, local culture, and practices. In fact these local deities are more popular then the Rigvedic dominant deities (Indra, Mitra, Varuna, and Nasatya) found in Mitanni inscriptions.
