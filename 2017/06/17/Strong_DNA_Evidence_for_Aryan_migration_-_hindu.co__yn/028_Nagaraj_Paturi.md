\>If for a minute we grant that the orign of the Vedic language is outside India is it not the responsibility of those propounding the theory to tell why the vedic language became extinct in the land of its origin.

  

A related question, Sri Achyut Karve-ji, is why the the speakers of proto-Indo Iranian who after migrating to India and after their language evolved into Vedic started all of a sudden composing hymns while they wrote only prose during their life in Syria. In prehistoric studies usual pattern is that musical compositions precede discursive prose writings. But in this case, interestingly, as per AIT, during their life in Syria the ancestors of the Vedic people write discursive prose about how to raise, maintain horses and after they migrate to a new land India, they forget prose writing and start composing musical hymns.
