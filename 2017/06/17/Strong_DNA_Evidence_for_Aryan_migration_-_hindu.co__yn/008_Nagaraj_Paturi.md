1\. The contemporarily relevant and effective and real political aspect of the whole debate lies in the potential of and past use of the Aryan Invasion /Immigration Theory to justify the British (Modern European Nations') invasion of India and opposition to and ridiculing of the Indian Freedom Struggle or Indian National Movement on that basis. It also has connections with norh Indians and upper castes particularly Brahmins being picturized as the ancient invaders of India and other Indians being victims of that from ages.'**"conviction" that AIT is baseless**is rooted in these contemporary consequences'.

  

2. OIT is being brought in as alternative to AIT as an alternative to the AIT explanation to the linguistic data of 'IE family' of languages being found spoken across a wide area including India. A third/ alternative explanation , other than AIT and OIT is perhaps there in the mind of Sri Vishvas-ji. He is welcome to present the same. 

  

3\. "We Hindus never invaded anyone" kind of statements come up in a different context than these language studies. It is in the context of comparing with the past imperialist attempts of global level invasions, some of them inspired by the intentions of spread of religion that people say that such invasions on such global scale, particularly those inspired by the intentions of spread of religion never originated from ancient India.

  

4\. The 'Aryan race', 'Dravidian race' notions, misnomers created on the basis of certain theorizations within the comparative studies of languages were discarded based on the sound arguments that 'race' is a biological anthropological notion and within that framework, Arayan race, Dravidian race are not valid concepts. Gradually the concept of race itself got discarded in the field of Physical Anthropology. Now, these gene studies are being employed as an alternative to race based approach from within biology.

  

5\. Modern academics are an interesting species. When some people argue for undoing medieval wrongs of violence through contemporary violence, they arguably justifiably say we can not progress if we hang on to medieval wrongs and rights. But the same academics never stop arguing for undoing prehistoric 'wrongs' ( knowing fully well that the degree of accuracy of historical conclusions decreases with the length of time we go into the past.) through contemporary actions. As long as such arguments demonizing a section of Indians based on the not yet conclusively settled theorizations in prehistory continues, contesting those fragile theorizations is expected to continue.

  

6\. Sri Vishvas-ji is welcome to enlighten us about his stand regarding the issue , educating us about the pitfalls in the statements like those of Dean Muichael Anderson which is quoted in the immediately previous post to his within the context of the contemporary consequences of these theories.
