I already did (if one cared to follow up on the pic I posted). Two things spring to mind:  
\* Availability of aDNA.  
\* Use of whole genome data rather than microsatellites and Y chromosome.  
  

Prof. Anderson at least humbly admits that he has not kept up with the field of genetics. Others should take a hint. Geneticists have themselves been warning so clearly for a while now:

  

\* First, a paper from 2006 is wildly out of date for this field. The methods used have been superseded. Instead of using one locus, the Y chromosome, and focusing on microsatellites (which have upsides and downsides), researchers now look at the whole genome. Probably the best paper to read on the latest results is Genetic Evidence for Recent Population Mixture in India. The authors date the admixture between two different lineages in the subcontinent to “1,900 to 4,200 years ago.” - Razib Khan  

  

\*Today, Dr. Underhill says there is no comparison between the kind of data available in 2010 and now. “Then, it was like looking into a darkened room from the outside through a keyhole with a little torch in hand; you could see some corners but not all, and not the whole picture. With whole genome sequencing, we can now see nearly the entire room, in clearer light.” - the hindu article.

With each other.

It's obvious isn't it? Take dominance of Turkish in Turkey, of Spanish in South and middle America, of English in North America, Australia and Africa, of Arabic in Egypt and North Africa, of Chinese in Tibet and the Uighur land, Japanese in Hokkaido, Russian in Eastern Siberia. They were all accompanied by fairly massive invasions and gene movement. Why - even Indic influence in South East Asia was accompanied by great population movement and domination (\~5% of Cambodian ancestry seems to be Indian)  

  

And I am not even mentioning the early domination of PIE descendents in Europe (Greek, Romance and Germanic languages vs Etruscan, Basque or Eteocretan).

I'll leave this for now :-)

One can continue fantasizing - "migration" is mostly a euphemism for "invasion" and "dominance" (probably a concession given absence of hard archaeological evidence of battles). PIE speakers did not come to dominate lands from Ireland (note connection with "Arya") to India and even further east without battles.

This fixation on direction funny. As admirers of dasharatha, we are happy to take pride in conquests in all 10 directions. And if you want for some reason to insist on Eastward invasion, go ahead and take Chola raids on shrIvijaya and vijayanagaran raids on Burma. The contrast with the "oh we don't invade, we're so noble" remains. PS: it is shrI vishvAsa btw (vAsuki is a patronymic.)
