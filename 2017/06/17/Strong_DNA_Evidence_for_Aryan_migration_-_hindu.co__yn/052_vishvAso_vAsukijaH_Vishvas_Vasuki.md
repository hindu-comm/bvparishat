That is falsehood. No geneticist implies in his work that there was just ONE wave of IA invaders or migrants. All they say is that they came into India in some time interval (say "1,900 to 4,200 years ago"). In fact, going by other known migrations, multiple waves are indeed the norm - For example the distinct waves of puritans, Germans, Irish, Italians coming to America.

  

On the other hand, some of them do seem to favor multiple waves, read -<http://www.unz.com/gnxp/indo-aryans-dravidians-and-waves-of-admixture-migration/?highlight=waves> .

  

And, where non-geneticists are concerned, you are wrong as well. Here is Taligeri examining Witzel :  

  
""  

But even here, Witzel sees two waves of invasion after the earliersettlement of the four tribes in the Punjab: “The next wave isrepresented by the PUru, although their movement into thesubcontinent had also become a done deed by the time most Vedichymns were composed. The PUru are thus included among the ‘FivePeoples’ whom they initially dominated. Finally, the PUru containeda subtribe, the Bharatas, who were the latest intruders and whothoroughly disturbed the status quo.”

...  
The Rigveda was composed by the priests of the PUrus and theBharatas, and “most of Rgveda was composed as the PUru and theBharata were moving into the Panjab. Portions composed before thePUru assumed a central role in the Panjab (in about threegenerations) were subsequently recast in their style.”

\[Here,incidentally, Witzel suggests a phenomenon roughly similar to that suggested by scholars like Pargiter and Shendge, who visualise parts of the Rigveda being already in existence in the Punjab beforethe arrival of the Vedic Aryans, and being revised and incorporated bythe Vedic Aryans into their text. But while these parts, according toPargiter and Shendge, were originally composed by non-Aryans intheir non-Aryan language, Witzel sees them composed by non-VedicAryans belonging to an earlier wave of invasions.\]

In other words, beyond doubt, you were confidently misrepresenting AIT scholarship and fooling yourself and this list. Better be more thoughtful and careful as shrI bijoy rightly suggests. Do better homework.

First of all, I don't buy your ridiculous claim that there is no mutual disagreement among AIT theorists (see quotes above). Also the blog I quoted for example is an AIT theorist which contradicts your unsourced quotes.  
  
Secondly, as to the migration postdating the earliest vaidika hymns, you may refer to AIT theorists like bAlagangAdhara TiLak, or later ones like M Witzel, either in the original or quoted by shrIkAnta taligeri. Here is an excerpt where he correctly summarizes some of their thoughts: "Indra is generally accepted by even the most conservative ofinvasionist scholars as a symbol of the invading Aryans: at the veryleast as a God invoked by them in their battles against the non-Aryans." (identifying such hymns with RV hymns is left out as an exercise)

By your admitted identification (which I dont comment on), he is indeed strongly placed in a professional discipline that enables him to comment thoughtfully on the issue (much more so than the present company). Willful blindness does not do one credit. Well, anyway, now I've shown other sources.
