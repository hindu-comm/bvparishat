Having satisfactorily called shrI nAgarAja patUri's bluff about his representation of AIT, I withdraw from this conversation as well. I am reminded of the list's reaction when I [similarly pointed out](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/yUHi_V9tS8Y/03qB1C8PCgAJ) shrI bijoy's misrepresentation of a 2009 Nature paper ) I stand by my criticism of his misplaced prejudice with regards to sources and inadequate use of scholarly care in his responses, but clarify that such criticism, being meant in the noble spirit of आसतो मा सद्गमय, need not be taken otherwise.
