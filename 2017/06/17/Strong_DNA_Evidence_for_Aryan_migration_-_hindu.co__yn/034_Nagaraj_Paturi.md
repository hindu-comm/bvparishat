That is the story, sir !

  

As per the current AIT narrative the speakers of the proto-Indo-Iranian who were the Mitanni, were the ones who migrated to India.

  

If they were the cousin branch and were not the 'invaders' , 'migrants' , who were the 'invaders' , 'migrants' , who later started composing hymns?

  

Yes, how do you know that whatever was not there in Vedic hymns was not known to the Vedic people? But logical positivism demands evidence for both the oral compositions of the Mitanni and non-hymn compositions of the Vedic.
