An additional note:

  

Shrikant Taligeri has a section on the "Hindu Invasionist School", quoting fine patriots like BG TiLak, S.D. Kulkarni and vIra sAvarkar. Reading it should disabuse one of the strange notion that OIT type delusion is a necessary aspect of Hindu reaction to enemy propaganda.  
  
""

V.D. (Veer) Savarkar, who more or less accepted Tilak’s hypothesis,takes equal pride in the “achievements” of the Aryans, but is less inclined to stress the “extermination” of the inferior races, and, infact, tries to suggest that the non-Aryans were relatively few in number, and that most of them welcomed the Aryan invaders with open arms.
