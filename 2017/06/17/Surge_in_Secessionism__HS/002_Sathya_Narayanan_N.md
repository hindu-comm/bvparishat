Yes as a eager, young learner of bharatiya culture. I also feel something wrong is happening. Recently some threads are more into social engg aspect. I find here srutis, smritis, puranas, Vedanta, diffe darshana were discussed. The methods to approach it. How to defend against our attackers. I learn a lot in this group. All these made me to defend myself against local attackers on hinduism. The arguments were of high quality.( although I am not a scholar to comment on it). But The unnecessary hatred/seccionist comments remember me of my alma IITM. Now parents and are frightened to put there kids here. Studs are worried abt the deviation. The hatred and politics started by certain studs was not taken seriously in the beginning. Therefore my humble suggestion is to avoid such things.
