**=======Moderators' Note=======**  

  

Namaste All,  
  

It is inevitable for us to intervene again.  

  

We earnestly request you not to discuss issues of debate and controversy that are purely socio-political in nature.  
  
These are giving room to raged controversies and heated debates. As all of us are aware, there are many other forums to serve that purpose. Let us discuss and encourage more issues and questions related to *śāstra* and *saṃskṛta*.  
  
There are many student members in the forum, but apparently their participation is very minimal. You may offer your valuable views on how to rope them into discussions related to respective śāstric subjects.  
  

We regret, we could not allow any further postings of members under moderation, in order to avoid the sheer digression from own objectives.  
  

***The thread is closed please.*
