A thread was recently closed by the moderators, and it seemed quite sensible and timely that they did so, so as to disallow escalation of issues in directions that are not the direct concerns of this august forum.

  

But the occasion also gives rise to reflection upon certain deeper issues, which I may briefly outline here. The issue is one of meta-legal importance, and one in which Sanskritists have an inescapable role to play.

  

There has been much lobbying by secessionists - Indian as well as foreign (though mostly it is Indian at the behest of the foreign) - to radically alter our law/constitution in such a manner that one group is always kept at a disadvantage : thus, Group B can make accusations against Group A on certain grounds, and Group A is legally barred from making the accusations against Group B on the same grounds. (This is apart from the organised backlash - a euphemism for hooliganism - egged on by foreign funded/inspired "institutions"). Such one-sided indemnification goes against the principles of natural justice, howsoever cleverly the laws are framed or phrased.

  

We are all aware how the erstwhile government at the Centre had brazenly proposed passing a blatant bill that would disempower one particular community against another/others, by making certain things cognizable offences, and passing on the burden of proving innocence on the other, legally disadvataged, community.

  

Similar have been laws designed to destroy the Indian family tradition, by enormously empowering the daughter-in-law so that the in-laws can be jailed summarily without so much as the semblance, or even commencement, of a trial. I know of two great Sanskrit scholars in Bangalore, thoroughbred gentlemen to the core, who were humiliated and embarrassed, owing to the blatant misuse of the provisions of law by the new entrant into their family.

  

Western interferences (via NGOs set up by them) under the guise of human rights or social justice are rampant, and aimed at the destruction of the Indian traditions, values, and social systems and customs - only to be replaced by chaos.

  

Members of the legal fraternity who have their moorings in the values of our heritage, have to sit up and think, and proper jurisprudential emendations must be effected in order that our society - with its longest, strong , peaceful, and stable institutional mechanisms - is not to be driven to sheer anarchy through a highly manipulated legal machinery. Western academics in general, and Indological (rebranded now as "South Asian" at the behest of the American powers) scholarship in particular, have played an immensely nefarious role - in making us feel that our heritage has been the most inequitable in history - and as Sheldon Pollock and Co. would love to have it - bearing kinship to, or being a source of inspiration for, Nazism, the worst of (in)human crimes - as if genocide was a regular part of Indian history.

  

That is not to say, of course, that no genocide ever took place in India. The invaders of the Abrahamic faiths did indulge (on Indian soil too), in large scale genocides upon a most innocent people - on such "strong and valid" grounds as refusal to get converted, or asking for freedom from the foreign yoke.

  

It is a great tragedy that most Indians, not excluding the "elite", are **utterly unaware of**, or conveniently close their eyes to, the systematic enterprise of the West - directed against all other civilisations in general in a way - of its senselessly narcissistic pursuit of its own hegemony, even via platitudes and shibboleths of tolerance and harmony.

  

**Sanskritists have a high responsibility here** - in showing how the wild and numerous accusations made by Western academia against our heritage are mostly baseless, and are indeed virulently politically motivated.

  

All this calls for a deep study of our own traditions first, and fair evaluations of its role in sustaining a peaceful, stable, and equitable society. The way a good many Indians squirm whenever anybody speaks of their past, is a pointer to the extent of the feeling of guilt already implanted in the Indian psyche.
