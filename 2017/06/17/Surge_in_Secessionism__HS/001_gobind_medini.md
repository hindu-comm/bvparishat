This thread is likely to go in similar direction as the previous post due to its controversial nature and due to flared tempers of some members. The purport of the thread seems to be based on a notion that group A people (whoever they may be) are being discriminated in law against group B (whoever they may be). The argument was put as an extension of previous post where a case for this Group A vs. Group B (They vs. Us) was made. In any case here are my comments if they pass through moderators' filter.  

  

1.[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Caste_and_Scheduled_Tribe_%28Prevention_of_Atrocities%29_Act,_1989) is the wiki article on Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. There were (and still are) rampant cases of atrocities (including rape and murder of entire families) against Dalits. (see, some[statistics](http://www.thehindu.com/data/U.P.-Bihar-lead-in-crimes-against-Dalits/article14506278.ece)). To tackle and deter such cases, the law has been legislated. The rationale of this law is given in the wiki article itself. This act was recently opposed by few numerically (and hence politically) dominant castes. However, present Government has retained this act against the political pressure.  
  
2. It is true that some NGO's were focusing only on negative aspects of the Indian culture and there were reasons to believe that at least some of them had ulterior agenda. Present GOI has wisely scrutinized these NGOs, examined their activities, and de-registered some of them when irregularities were found in their accounts. In fact, in few cases even judicial action has been initiated when their activities were found to be suspicious.  
  
3. It is difficult to understand as to why this Group A vs. Group B psychology pertaining to the law exists in a scholar's forum. No legislation can be initiated by simply foreign funding and NGO activities as being insinuated in the post. IMO, present government is quite strong and stable so as not to succumb to the foreign pressure, whatever may be their follies or wisdom in other areas.
