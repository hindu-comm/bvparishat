hariH OM,

  

 "Flared" tempers are because of a great personality being calumniated and for this, the blame lies at your door Gobind. Not only this, you don't listen to / evaluate the opposite view points honestly and use too much of hand waving and obfuscation. Hence the tempers being "flared" is well justified. I am no one to advise you, but it is clear that your shrill offensiveness has caused damage to your own cause (howsoever exalted it be according to you). You, by your definition represent all that is good in the world and your opponents are by your definition, bad! Dalitist discourse taken to its extreme with a smattering of adhyayana without any aarjava! Moreover, you seek to pit the best in vaarkari tradition (people with adhikaara according to you to interpret veda, viz. Jnaneshwar, Tukaram etc.) with the ordinary ones in your opposite camp ("coolies" as you call them). One wonders what benefit you derive other self aggrandizement (that too not earned by you but that which you seek to appropriate from a great tradition of which you are a bad follower)? Didn't Jnanoba or Tukoba tell you that vinaya is the first step in adhyayana?

  

 Coming to your "data", please note that any criminal or a civil case involving a scheduled caste / tribe as one party is these days turning into an atrocity case. Much like the 498A. Hence the data presented by you, incidentally taken from a naxal tabloid, is absolutely unreliable.

  

 One can give enough anecdotal evidence where people from non SC / ST castes have not pursued cases against SCs / STs just because of the atrocities act even though they have been grossly wronged. This can never be documented. The atrocities act is also used as an extortion tool because it is by definition asymmetric and hence flawed. The act creates dual nature of nationality and hence opposite to the principle of a republic. When somebody tells you this, you will justify it by harping on the past. Therefore your positions are specious and hence dishonest. Stop playing the perpetual victim. Even the atrocities act has been in force for almost a generation (28 years).

  

shrivathsa.
