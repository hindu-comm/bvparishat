Dear Srinivasa Sastri,

The efforts taken may prove to be very useful for a lot of people and are praiseworthy. However, I noticed a few typographical errors that needs to be corrected. It would be nice if you can proof read once more and get rid of them.  

Here is a sample of errors that came to my sight at the first glance.  

1\. page 1, line 2 (matra missing).

2\. page 3, line 2 (title of adhikarana messed up with sutra).

3\. page 3, sutra 26.5 (hyphenation missing; this is there in many places)

Please see if you can look into these aspects...

Thanks & regards,

-ram.
