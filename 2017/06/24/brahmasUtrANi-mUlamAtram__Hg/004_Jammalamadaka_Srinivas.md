Sir,

In the typing module which worked had a problem with Akara prashlesha. And the second one ...kindly follow the numbering there will be no problem. It is sushuptyutkranthyadhikaranam. That is the name of the adhikaranam.

And by giving hypernation some formatting problem is arising, gender it was discarded.

Thank you for you suggestions.

Regards,

Srinivas sastry
