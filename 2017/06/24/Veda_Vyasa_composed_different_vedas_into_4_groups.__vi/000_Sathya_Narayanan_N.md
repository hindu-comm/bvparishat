Respected Scholars,  
  
I want to understand the status of Vedas before the composition of Vedas into 4 parts.  
Being that, what were the vedas before this ?  
Where the Vedas same before Vyasa composed it into 4 ?  
While composing Vedas, did Veda Vyasa left certain Veda mantras or Shakas ?  
  
Note: I am looking from the parampara (tradition) point and also from modern history point.
