Dear Sir,

  

Per my understanding of the Mahabharata, the vedas were one initially, at the dawn of this kalpa (in fact, every kalpa)

  

But with the passage of yugas, and the attendant decrease in lifespan of mortals, the vedas were successively abridged to enable their retention in memory

  

In this yuga, vyasa arranged the vedas into four divisions to enable retention and entrusted them to a specific rishi lineage each for propagation

  

he is the compiler, the arranger, not the composer

  

In my opinion, veda means information itself, nothing else, and information is one whole

  

but it is studied in divisions for ease of comprehension and understanding

  

with regards

Harsha
