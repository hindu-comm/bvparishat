Namaste,

  

In tantra shaastra, the geometrical diagrams - dot (bindu) (circle is the expanded form) and triangle (trikONa) represent Parashiva and Shakti. And, intersection of bindu & trikONa represent union of shiva & shakti. 

  

त्रिकोणरूपिणि शक्तिः बिन्दुरूप परः शिवः ।

अविनाभावसम्बन्धं तस्मात बिन्दुत्रिकोणयोः ॥

  

In the similar lines, there must be some connectivity between (1) the circle and pitru-devatas (2) chaturasra and vishvedevatas. These are drawn during sapiNDikaraNa (if I am right - because I never participated in any shrAdha ritual nor studied the prEta-kalpa (as my parents are alive).

  

I would like to know the significance of these geometrical figures behind shrAddha kalpa.

  

regs,

sriram
