To construct a circle, one need not know the value of 'pi'! Circle is a set of points that are equidistant from the center. Thus with a rope, fixing one end, and moving the other end, one can draw a circle. If we look at the Shulbasuutras, the intersecting points of circles are used to construct a square. Sulbasuuta also describe the procedure to draw a circle of area equal to that of a square and vice versa. Further there is also a mention of value of pi in these suutras, and also that this is an 'approximate' value and not the exact one!  
  

You may refer to [scl.samsaadhanii.in/iit-ropar/lectures/6/Applied+Geometry+in+SulbaSutras.pdf](http://scl.samsaadhanii.in/iit-ropar/lectures/6/Applied+Geometry+in+SulbaSutras.pdf) for more information.  
  

Thanks,  

Amba Kulkarni
