The Sanskrit text, by the famous Hindu mathematician, Baudhayana in his[Baudhayana Sulbha Sutra](http://veda.wikidot.com/baudhayana-sulbha-sutra)of the 6th century BC mentions this ratio as approximately equal to 3. The Hindu mathematician,[Aryabhatta](http://veda.wikidot.com/aryabhatta), in 499 AD worked out the value of Pi to the fourth decimal place as \[3x (177/1250) = 3.1416\]. In 825 AD one Arab mathematician Mohammad Ibna Musa said: This value has been given by the Hindus \[Indians\] (62832/20,000 = 3.1416).
