Respected GSS Murthy Sir,  
  
I was able to read some articles published on ancient mathematics from Geometry p.o.v.  
These give a very good idea from basic mathematics p.o.v and how the calculations evolved.  
The authors of sulba sutras had a different methods for finding the value of pi. Although the importance of Pi as such was not important those days.  
Currently, the formulae used in those times are mapped to the current formulate 2(pi)r and analysis is done.  
The interesting thing, is the value derived in sulba sutras are same as the current value of 3.14, approximated to 2 digits after decimal point.  
  
From auspicious and inauspicious p.o.v. I have seen circular and square alters made for agnihotra sadas at Kanchi Kamakoti mutt.  
They used wet clay and did it. Not sure whether cubical bricks were used for square alters.  
  
Anyway thanks for your question, which made me to dive deep into the mathematical aspect of this.
