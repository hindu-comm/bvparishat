On the day of the passing away of one�s own father or mother, one has to perform Ekoddishta Shraaddha; if father�s brother had no male issue then too the Ekoddishta Shraaddha be performed. In the Parvana Shraaddha, Vishva Devas are to be invoked first and their puja is to be performed.But without Vishvadevas in Ekoddishta Shraaddha, Brahmanas are arranged in Deva Pitru Shtaanaas and worshipped. In the Deva Kaarya, two Brahmanas are to be arranged and for Pitru Karyaa three Brahmanas; Or at least one each of the Karyas are required as minimum. Pretajeeva deeds to be kept in the form of a Pinda �n Bhumi beneath Kushaa grass with black Tilas and water. Brahnanaas would get ***shuddhi*** on the ***eleventh day*** of the demise, while Kshatriyas get purified on the thirteenth day, Vaishyas on the sixteenth day and Shudras on the thirty first day. On the termination of Sutaka or Asuddhi, Brahmanas should perform Ekoddishta Shraddha on the **** ***twelfth day***, after a month, after Traipaksha or three weeks and every month thereafter for a year. Then the action of �Sapindeekarana Paarana Vidhhana� must be followed, when the departed Soul would abandon the �Pretha Swarupa� and attain the status of �Pitru Devatva�.The Pitaras are of two types viz. Amurtaas (Formless) and Murtimaan ( with Form). Naandimukhaas are stated to be Formless and Paarvanaas are Murtimaans.  

  

*Shraaddha is performed only after shuddhi.*
