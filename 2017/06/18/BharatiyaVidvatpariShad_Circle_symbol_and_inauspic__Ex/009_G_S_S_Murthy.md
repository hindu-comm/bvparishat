My most sincere thanks to all the scholars who have tried to educate me. I was totally aware that my knowledge was perfunctory at best in this area. I now know that my way of looking at it was totally wrong. I agree with Prof.Nagaraj Paturi that "inauspicious" was not the right word.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
