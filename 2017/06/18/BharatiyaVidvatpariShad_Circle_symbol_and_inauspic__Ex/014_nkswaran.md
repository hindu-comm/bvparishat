Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} {BharatiyaVidvatpariShad} Circle symbol and inauspiciousness.

  

Dear Murthyji and Nagaraj ji                 1. I think Murthyji is not wrong in using the term 'inauspicious' modifying pitrkriyas. That is how it is taken by Sampradaya. If somebody keeps a bunch of darbha grass with its tip in southward direction, then he is advised not to do so. Here 'vyavahara' goes like this: 'darbha' is placed so only in 'asubhakarya's.                   
        2. In the Grhya rituals circular shape is associated with 'pitr's and square is associated with 'deva's. In the Sraadhaprayoga 'aupaasana' is done on 'homamandala' arranged in square shape whereas 'sraaddhahoma' proper is done on a circular 'homamandala'. Also while smearing 'gomaya' on the ground for 'paadaprashaalana',
circular shape is maintained for 'pitr's. Square shape is maintained for Vishve devas.                 3. I have got a strong NOTION that the'pindapitryajna' in the 'Srautakriya' is one of the basics which originated our 'Sraadha' ritual meant to propitiate our own ancestors (and not the pitrgana's).   

I know that my statements need further explanation. But let me conclude for now.    nks
