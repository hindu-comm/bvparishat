Some of the practical consequences of misunderstanding these rituals as inauspicious are:

  

1\. Some of my acquaintances have been asked to either vacate their rented houses for conducting aabdika shraadha rituals in the house or were compelled to find a venue or arrangement outside the rented house for the purpose.

  

2\. Hall providers are not agreeing to provide halls for the first anniversary which is conducted at a bigger scale than the rituals of the later years.
