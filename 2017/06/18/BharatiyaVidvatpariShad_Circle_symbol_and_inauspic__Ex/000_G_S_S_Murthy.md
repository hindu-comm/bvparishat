Dear Scholars,

In a certain Vedic rite associated with Sraadh, a circular portion and a square portion of ground are marked in water. The former becomes the seat for pitrus and the latter for visvedavas. ( I hope I have got it right) I am just wondering if the figure of a circle being associated with inauspiciousness has anything to do with the Vedic people not having been able to figure out the correct manner of tiling a circular area with rectangular bricks! Square seems to be associated with auspiciousness. Vishnusahasranaama has "chaturasra" as a name of Vishnu. Perhaps yajna platforms also avoid circles. I am aware that I do not have adequate information to make any conjecture. Scholars could enlighten.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
