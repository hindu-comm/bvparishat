For constructing a yajnavedika, my belief is that a circular area is not prescribed as it is not easy to construct one without knowing the value of "pi". Is it that a circular area is associated with inauspiciousness? If so, is it that they found a circle to be enigmatic and declared it as inauspicious?

Regards,

Murthy
