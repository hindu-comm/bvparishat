The article in Hindu is claiming very strong DNA evidence for Aryan Migration into India.



My comments:

As long as Indian scholars do not investigate the ancient history of the land between Afghanistan the western Europe, this AIT theory will rise from time to time. Several times I tried on BVP to bring attention of scholars to the ancient history of Afghanistan, Indian river names in Lithuania, Ladies Kingdom from Synkyang province of China, Tokharistan, and Persian Empire of the known history. Every time I was simply neglected or set aside. I had shown my power point on this subject in 2010 in Pune and Hyderabad. One person who travelled in the Mid-east was present in audience in Hyderabad. At the end of my presentation I got up and said he has seen all these inscriptions and photos in the museums of Middle-east countries. Dr Joshi is right about his understanding of this subject. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
