Dr Narayan Joshi-ji,

  

Your words,

  

"As long as Indian scholars do not investigate the ancient history of the land between Afghanistan the western Europe, this AIT theory will rise from time to time."

  

indicate that you do not subscribe to AIT theory.

  

I too (probably like many members of BVP) remember that-

  

Several times you tried on BVP to bring attention of scholars to the ancient history of Afghanistan, Indian river names in Lithuania, Ladies Kingdom from Synkyang province of China, Tokharistan, and Persian Empire of the known history.

  

But sir,

  

you were never neglected or set aside.

  

Every time, we requested you to educate us about this area in which we are not as knowledgeable as you are.

  

You may briefly give us the gist of your

  

1\. Conclusion

  

2\. Evidences that lead to this conclusion.

  

3\. How these evidences lead to this conclusion.

  

If your theses does not fit summarization in a brief email post, you may post a longer version as attached to an email.

  

Thanks in advance for sharing.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
