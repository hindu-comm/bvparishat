A third edition including Prof. K.V. Abhyankar’s contribution in terms of readings from some additional manuscripts and providing of cross-references is, I believe, still easily available from the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. The Institute staff is prompt in filling book orders. You do not need to postpone your purchase until your next trip to India.
