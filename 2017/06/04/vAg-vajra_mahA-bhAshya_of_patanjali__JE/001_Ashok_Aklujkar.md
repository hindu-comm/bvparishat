The word is found in a verse quoted by Patañjali. See Kielhorn’s Mahābhāshya edn., vol. I, p. 2 line12.  
  
The rendering of the passage you have quoted is correct. It seems to me that you need not search for another English rendering. However, if you must have another translation for some reason, there is a Navāhnikī translation by K.V. Abhyankar and J.M. Shukla published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (I do not have it at hand).
