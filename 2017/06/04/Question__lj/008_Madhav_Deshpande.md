Dear Shri Karve,

  

  Thank you for trying to get information regarding the descendants of Shamshastri Dravid. Three manuscripts of Vedavicāra and the edition printed in Vai in 1912 all uniformly contain the colophon: इति श्रीमद्द्विवेदिद्रविडशामशास्त्रिविरचितं वेदविचारप्रकरणं संपूर्णतामगमत् । तेन परमात्मा श्रीरामः सुप्रसन्नो वरदो भवतु । श्रीमहालक्ष्मीबल्लाळेश्वरार्पणमस्तु । This makes it clear that he is the author of this text. The text is also cited with his name in some other sources. The text must have been composed sometime before 1912, when the Vai edition appeared. The three manuscripts I have do not give any date.
