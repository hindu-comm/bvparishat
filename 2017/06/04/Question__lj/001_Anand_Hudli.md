Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

It appears the dedication statement, श्रीमहालक्ष्मीबल्लाळेश्वरार्पणमस्तु indicates that the Kuladevatas of the author could have been the popular deities of Mahalakshmi of Kolhapur and Ballaleshwar (Ganapati). As you might very well know, families in Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka usually have two deities as Kuladevata - one male and one female. Khandoba is perhaps the most popular Kuladevata, but other deities enjoy their fair share of Kuladevata worship too.

  

Regards,

  

Anand
