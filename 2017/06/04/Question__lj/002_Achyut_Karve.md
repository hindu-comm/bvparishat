Dear Madhav Deshpande,

My acquaintance from Nashik Shri Kamlakar Ware has confirmed that Shamshastri Dravid is a well known name in Nashik. He has confirmed that his descendants continue to live in Nashik. He has assured me that he will let me know their address in a couple of days.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
