Thanks, Antonia, for that reference. During my undergraduate days in Fergusson College in Pune, I was studying German along with Sanskrit.
There was a celebration of 50 years of German teaching in Pune, and we performed the 4th act of Śākuntalam on stage in German. I acted as Śārṅgarava and my Sanskrit teacher Pt. N. N. Bhide (who also knew German) played the role of Kaṇva. It was sometime around this occasion that I translated Goethe's poem into Sanskrit.
