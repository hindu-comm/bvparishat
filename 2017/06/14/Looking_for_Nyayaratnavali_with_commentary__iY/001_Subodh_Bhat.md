There is only one published commentary on Nyayaratnavali by Padamannur Narayana Achar (father of famous Samskrit Scholar Bannanje Govindachar), in 1940's. Sorry even I would like to have a copy of the same. Half of this work is translated to English by a western scholar Sttaford Betty which was published by Motilal Banarasidass, copy of which is easy to obtain.
