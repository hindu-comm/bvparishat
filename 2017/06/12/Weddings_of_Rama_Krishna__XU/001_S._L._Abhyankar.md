When reading your message, it comes to mind :-

1.  First of all, there was never any wedding of राधा and कृष्ण. So
    "radha madhava vivaaha" or "radha Krishna vivaaha"both are
    misconceptions.   
2.  If so, "vivaaha" must not be translated as wedding. The option then
    becomes to focus on the etymology of the word विवाहः. Obvious धातुः
    is वि+वह्. We have similar word प्रवाहः where the उपसर्गः is प्र. So
    विशेषं वहनमनेन इति विवाहः, प्रकृष्टं वहनमनेन इति प्रवाहः \| 3.  राधा and माधव rhyme with each other quite well, becoming
    onomatopoetic becauseof repetition of वर्ण ध. 4.  Thinking of रामसीताविवाहः, it was first the स्वयंवरम्, where the
    privilege of choice was with Sita. Her choice was then sanctified
    and celebrated by विवाहसंस्कार. In allस्वयंवर-s the privilege
    vested with the bride. So they are all called by the lady's name -
    सीतास्वयंवरम्,रुक्मिणीस्वयंवरम्, दमयन्तीस्वयंवरम्,
    इन्दुमतीस्वयंवरम्, etc.
