Not an answer, but this may be of interest to you. Note the names of two small works by Gosvami Tulasidasa:

1\) पार्वती-मंगल: A work on the wedding of mother Parvati and Lord Shiva

2\) जानकी-मंगल: A work on the wedding of mother Sita and Lord Rama

Needless to say, पार्वती-मंगल and जानकी-मंगल are the Prakrit spellings of पार्वती-मङ्गल and जानकी-मङ्गल. Also note that the use of the word मङ्गल for wedding is similar to the use of the word कल्याण for wedding.



PS: The works are in the ‘sohar’ (a metre for folk songs) and ‘harigitika’ (a Prakrit metre) metres
