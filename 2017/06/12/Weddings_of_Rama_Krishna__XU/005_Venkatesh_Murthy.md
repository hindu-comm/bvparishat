Namaste

  

It is also because of Panini Sutrasअजाद्यदन्तम् 2-2-33 andअल्पाच्तरम्‌ 2-2-34 and the Vartika for 2-2-34 sayingअभ्यर्हितं च पूर्वं निपतति इति वक्तव्यम्। मातापितरौ।

  

In a Dvandva compound the more honourable member is placed first. Mother is more honourable than Father. Thereforeमातापितरौ and so on. But inउमामहेश्वराभ्यां उमा and महेश्वर are equally honourable butउमा has less vowels and it is placed first.
