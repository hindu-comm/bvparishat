> ***Abstract:**** *We often face in India a misconception that her > ancient culture and more specifically her knowledge systems, are of no > relevance to our current problems and conditions. Indeed, except > perhaps in the arts, Indian culture is increasingly divorced from > education and Indian life, museified and exotified in its own land.
> However, when we look at Indian systems of nature conservation > (including water management), medicine, lifestyle, ethics and yoga, > their applicability, if not urgent necessity, is immediately apparent. > Besides, India’s cultural foundations, which remain her best > sociopolitical cement, hold several lessons not only for the country’s > cohesion, but for an increasingly divided and polarized world, as they > help us address issues of secularism and multiculturalism. This > lecture will highlight some of those important ways by which ancient > India could still help her present avatar.**** >
> ***About the Speaker:**** *Born in France in 1956, Michel Danino has > been living in India since 1977. A student of Indian civilization and > its early development, he has authored papers and books in French and > English. Recent titles include The Lost River: On the Trail of the > Sarasvati (Penguin India, 2010, a multidisciplinary study of the Vedic > Sarasvati river) and Indian Culture and India’s Future (DK Printworld, > 2011). Michel Danino has taught and lectured at many institutions, > including IIM Ranchi and several IITs. Since 2011, he has been a guest > professor at IIT Gandhinagar, where he is assisting its Archaeological > Sciences Centre, giving courses on Indian civilization and > coordinating a course on Indian Knowledge Systems. His other interests > include nature conservation and the creation of innovative educational > material. He is also a member of the Indian Council of Historical > Research.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
