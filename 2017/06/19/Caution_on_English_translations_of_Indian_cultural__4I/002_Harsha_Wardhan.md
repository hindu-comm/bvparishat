Respected scholars,

  

I believe my recent posts have got something to do with this message. Sri Bijoy is right - we need to exercise caution when it comes to translations.

  

The best course of action in my view is to develop a passing acquaintance with the source language, in most cases, Samskrit, and then only peruse those translations that provide the original verses also. If that is not possible, then one should get the original verses from another source to a comparisonal study. This is hard work, but the results will be superior.

  

Further, I have noticed that only translations by esteemed scholars and unbiased academics are worth studying. In fact, one should also first do a search on the translator to know of any red flags.

  

I have no hesitation in admitting that I am automatically suspicious of western academic scholarship as well as the output of these so-called new age Indian gurus. They do more harm than good.  
  
regards

Harsha
