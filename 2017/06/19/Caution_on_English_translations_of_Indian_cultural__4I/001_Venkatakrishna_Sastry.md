Namaste

1\. I agree with the point made in the post below on ' Translation of Samskruth Texts' available on Internet and spew out by search engines.

  

The problem has a deeper legacy and need for remedial action. The magnitude of works that need attention is not only the primary works; but also the secondary derivatives of the same. The same amount of
attention is needed for regional language discourses ,and translations that have used such 'English translations' as authentic base and basis for local knowledge propagation.

  

2. Probably it would be better and easier to ' Build a NEW PROJECT OF SAMSKRUTH RESORUCES TO BRING OUT WHAT THEY SAID ' AS THEY WERE - Prior to the translations' !This work needs to be done in an unbiased manner and professionally ethically academically justifiable manner to attract right amount of resources.

  

3\. Can there be a listing of names and data base building for such a project ?
