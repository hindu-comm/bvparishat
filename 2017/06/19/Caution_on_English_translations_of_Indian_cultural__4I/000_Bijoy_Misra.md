Dear friends,  

Greetings.  

Lately I observe an increase in demand and search of English translations  

of Indian cultural texts. I do not know the need and the intended use.
I wish  

to offer a caution that most translations done by individuals who may not be  

culturally ingrained could be erroneous and mechanical. The translations  

may never replace the original text for any education or learning.  

I do realize the curiosity of the learners and the desire to "understand".  
However it is important who the individual might assume as the teacher.  

I would urge all to be extremely careful and refer to the original text always.  

If you indulge a bit, you would discover the beauty and the clarity of the  

original text. Please make efforts to find out a local teacher in case self-reading  
gets difficult. Please never compromise by assuming some material and forming  
your ideas based on such derivatives.  

Let me hope that people would pay attention.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
