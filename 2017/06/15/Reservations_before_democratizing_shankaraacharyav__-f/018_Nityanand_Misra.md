With due apology to the moderators who have closed the thread, I would like to make an important point.

Statements like these are highly objectionable as they paint the ancestors of a large part of India's population (nearly 30%) as sinners. If a caste Hindu (savarna) made a negative remark stereotyping the ancestors of the community Mr Medini belongs to, Mr Medini would label him/her casteist. If Mr Medini would not, activists from his community certainly would. Sections 153A and 153B of the IPC would be invoked. Some would even file police cases, burn effigies, and invoke the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Do remember how Ashis Nandy was hounded and had to tender an unconditional apology in the Supreme Court for his remarks on corruption among empowered OBCs, SCs, and STs.

  

But Mr. Medini can make such casteist remarks with impunity on a scholarly forum. Because if somebody calls out his casteism, he can simply say:

There we go. We have a member who identifies with his caste and shamelessly paints forward caste people of the yore as "sinners". Sorry to say that this is not just casteism but also Dalit activism masquerading as scholarship. BVP is just not the forum for this.
