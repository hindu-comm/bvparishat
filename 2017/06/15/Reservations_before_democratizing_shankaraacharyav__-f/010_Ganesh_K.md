Namaste Gobind,

Whether ancient shastras or modern research it is an established norm to respect facts and figures that serve equally valid pramana vis a vis personal opinions which doesn’t serve any good except carrying away a majority of fools.

Responses to your opinions:

1) This is what is taught even today by followers of western sponsored slaves who were benefited by their personal gains . First please refer to the census statistics and beware of the facts. As mentioned in my posts this reservation game is subscribed by majority of other religion followers who claim to have no such caste discrimination as taught by the western invaders. Isn’t this contradictory to the values you have quoted in the constitution. Is this partiality called as equality and that is the value we get out of education system that helps to bring out truth?

2) Why this affirmative action out of this positive discrimination given to 70% of population in India for so many decades has not yet helped out the majority and still politicians are struggling to add new castes to this list and the GENERAL list shrinks further. All this is in the name of progress. Progress is colored out and discriminated for equality whatever may be the quality achieved.

3) How many castes (% of population) that got deleted. IS the current 70% the outcome of these deletions then we need to realize that the percentage of sufferers were such a huge majority.

4) What segregation are you speaking of? Refer to the documented history of through politics of non trivarna kings of Vijayanagara as per Talbot (2001) on King Prola,Addanki Kings who stretched from[Cuttack, Orissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttack,_Orissa "Cuttack, Orissa")to the north,[Kanchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanchipuram "Kanchipuram")to the south and[Srisailam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srisailam "Srisailam")to the west,Mooshika Raja Vamsha dating back to Tamil Sangam Era,96 Clans of Maratha who reigned with power and belonging to the so called suppressed castes of present era is what the politicians are still propitiating for the “positive discrimination for affirmative actions” further? Also this included literary exponents like Molla for translating Ramayana (ofcourse from Sanskrit) ,Kanakadasa etc.

5) Exactly the constitution wants equality by favouring majority of population . Who are the true minorities and what constitution is doing to them in theory and practice. Please relook at the census data.

Coming to the new topic of brain drain please refer to the statistics of Indians outside India especially in some states where they are more than 40% of the population. What does this indicate on the qualified resources moving out of inequality and suppression in country of birth discriminated by birth alone.

  

regards,

Ganesh K.
