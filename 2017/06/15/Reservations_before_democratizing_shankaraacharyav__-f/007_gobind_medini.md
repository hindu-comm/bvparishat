Normally, I ignore people whose world view is completely different and whose minds are closed. Here I make an exception to make another point: No body has exclusive rights to interpret Vedas or Vedic tradition. We (and many people like me both from Warkari tradition and from other streams) do not recognize any exclusive Vedic authority to interpret Vedas in a particular way. As Tukaram says, only we (here, those who see sarvAbhUti parameshvara and behave with equability) know Vedas. Others (i.e. those who do not see such samatva and who endlessly quibble about Vedic injunctions) are only coolies who carry Vedas as a load. (Cf: Tukaramachi Gatha). Gita call such people veda-vAda-rataaH and deprecate them (BG 2.42-44).

You are operating in a different plane and hence do not understand the point I am making. So, let us stop here.
