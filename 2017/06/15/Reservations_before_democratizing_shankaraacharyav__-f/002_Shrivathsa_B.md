Very valid and pertinent thoughts by shrii GK. I endorse his appeal to the Veda democratizers to remove or at least decry caste based reservation which is a current problem rather than attack the straw man of a stray verse in an obscure grantha which not even 1% of population can read and 1% among those who have read it can understand.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
