Where are personal opinions? I am going by the Indian constitution.

Why bring westerners and other religions in picture? Caste is an internal problem and a reality. What is required is annihilation or nominalization of caste as suggested by Dr Ambedkar rather than blaming reservations. Religion based reservations are not allowed by the constitution and I am not advocating them. So there is no need to bring other religions in the issue of reservations.

I have not understood this figure of 70%. Fifty % is the limit for the general category. The status of reserved categories is slowly changing.

You have asked a good question. I have not heard of any deletions. There is a proposal however, to delete creamy layers from the reserved categories. There is also a proposal for economic criterion. You may see my earlier posts where I said that implementation has problems and situation needs a review. However, SC/ST (about 25%) need help to bring them into main stream. OBC's are granted another about 25% on a state to state basis. To my knowledge, addition is happening in this category. In any case, due to 50% ceiling the existing reservations base gets diluted due to additional claims.

Your information seems doubtful. For example 96 clans of Marathas were never called shUdra by birth. In any case, we are not talking about kings but about ordinary labor class segregated due to traditions.

Here we are not talking about majority or minority but about socially and economically backward strata of society.

As I said they move outside for better prospects and upward mobility rather than suppression. You are probably confusing and equating economic backwardness with social suppression. Yes, sometimes they are interconnected but not always.
