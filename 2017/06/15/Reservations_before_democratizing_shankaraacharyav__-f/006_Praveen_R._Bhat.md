The prAyaschitta is not as per the whims of anyone; it has to be prescribed by the Vedas. And none of these political, social norms are binding as Vaidika karma. You can take it anyway you like since you follow ardhajaratinyAya with Shruti and Smriti as confirmed by you more than once, including in this mail later, but no Vaidika does so.
