WHat is noted obviously is you are not giving any pramana or proof. For the point #3 of traditional priest reservation,what is the % of reservation ,procedure to be followed,how many got it,where is it documented as proof??

  

Also very obvious saddening situation is that a cry baby continued to cry than wake up on its own limbs,despite decades of reservation to meet out the percieved equality why the majority who enjoys this social menace continue to still cry?? is there something really wrong as swabhava?? Doesn't it show to problems within (the birth or modern gene theory). THe status of these and their history centuries before foreign mutilation out of invasion clearly indicates the truth (as well as the present truth).
