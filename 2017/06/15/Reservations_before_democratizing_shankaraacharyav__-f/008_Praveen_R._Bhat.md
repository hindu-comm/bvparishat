To each his own, please feel free to ignore. However, do not expect the same from others to ignore your malicious view of painting all Vaidikas with the same brush, biased as it is, lest it be taken as truth by some!

Then why do you crib about the orthodox tradition? Interpret it however you like.

If many, like you, but not all of Varkari tradition recognise so, then it is not a Varkari view at all, or you come off as using ardhajaratinyAya w.r.t. Varkari view as





well!

That is nothing new, it is the saying of orthodox Advaita tradition as well, since it is the goal of the Vedas.

Again, Upanishads also talk of the same thing, so nothing new there either.

Indeed,



I am operating at a traditional plane, which is a different plane than yours, but there is nothing to not understand in what you say. Its perfectly understandable, given your biased view and seeing everything from the social justice angle.

If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

  

As for my response, I am just using UShTradaNDanyAya.I wish that Ishvara lived upto your social standards and created everyone in the world equal, instead of some poor, some missing limbs, some less intelligent, etc.

Thankfully, Tuka Maharaj said it without such ridiculous biases leading to self-contradiction as crying of being left of Vedic studies and calling those very Vedic followers as worse than coolies in the same breath! :)
