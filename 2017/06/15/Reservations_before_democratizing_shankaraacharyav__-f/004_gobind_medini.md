Dears (Shri Shrivathsa / Shri Ganesh K)  

  
I do not want to involve myself in a political rhetoric but address one point, that of brain-drain which I will address later. For other points I can invoke karma theory and its collective and social manifestation. This theory was conveniently (mis)used by vested interests to justify untouchability, lineage based discrimination in the form of chAturvarNya, and social injustice in general. I am invoking it here just to make a point: in Vedic tradition there is something like prAyaschiita for the past sins. Why not the so called forward castes take the "positive discrimination" and "affirmative action" as an atonement of their past sins? Veda democratization (this term is not mine, but I like it) is just setting right one anomaly. As a typical backward caste member I will not be interested in learning Vedas but in ensuring myself a dignified life. For that I have to reject not (necessarily) Vedas, but certain smRRiti-s. Veda-democratization is but a small part of rejecting this aitihya (discriminatory part of chAturvarNya in theory and practice) in a specific context. It does not mean that I reject many other wonderful things in Indian civilization. As a member of Ramnami schedule caste, I can be a Rama-bhakta and an Advaitin at the same time and still reject the discriminatory smRRiti-s - the so called essential part of Hindu-dharmashAstra - in a specific context. I can love Mahabharata, Ramayana, my warkari tradition, its saints etc and still reject the "shambuka" story of Ramayana. By doing so I am rejecting the law of excluded middle.. in the sA.nkhya style of kapil muni. I hope, you understand all this.  
  

After making my point about karma theory to just show that it can be used (misused) either way, I must make another point. Indian constitution has been formulated and ratified by the constituent assembly members not for endorsing karma theory or any particular religious doctrine but to work towards following objective: "We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, democratic republic and to secure to all its citizens: **Justice, social, economic and political; Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; Equality of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.** Within this framework we call always sing "Vande Mataram", Sare Jahase Achcha, or Namaste Sada Vatsale Matrubhume etc.  

  

Now coming back to brain-drain which is an important issue. Those who have to migrate to foreign countries due to "local affirmative action" are quite small in numbers. Most of the migrations are for better prospects and upward mobility; and these would have happened any way (with or without local affirmative action). I am not blaming the migrants, because desire to move up socially and economically exists in all sections of the society irrespective of tags of "forward" or "backward". The important point is what contribution they make to their land of birth and lineage. In a state like Kerala, foreign remittances is an important part of the state economy. In our neighboring country (China) not only these remittances but the productive human power itself is enriched when some of them return and/or contribute to the national development from within. Obviously, this or any other contribution is voluntary. What matters is, (a) they be good citizens of their adopted country, and (b) they maintain fraternal and empathic relations with the people of their land of origin.
