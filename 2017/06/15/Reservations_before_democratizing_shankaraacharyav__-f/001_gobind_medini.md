1\) Caste based reservations in independent India (post-26 Jan 1950 when Indian constitution came into force) are necessitated precisely because birth based reservations of a different kind existed for more than two millenniums in the Indian subcontinent.  
  

2\) The post-Independence reservations are of the nature of "positive discrimination" or "affirmative action" and such positive discrimination exists in many civilized societies in one way or other. These actions are there to ensure a minimum level playing field. They are not there to force the indiscriminate equality (as in cultural revolution of China during 1966-76).  
  

3\) Reservation scheme is not static. Castes can be added or deleted in the "reservation list" (if required) depending on their relative development. Not many people are thus aware that the reservation is not entirely birth dependent. For example in Maharashtra even a Brahmin whose father is a priest, who is without the conventional (secular) education, and who has been taught the craft of priest-hood, can enlist himself as a conventional priest (भिक्षुक) to get reservation benefits, whatever they may be for this particular category. However, if his progeny get secular education then these benefits are withdrawn from their next generation. Further, reservation for physically handicapped and for the ex-servicemen etc. are also not birth based.  
  

4\) This is not to suggest that reservation is a panacea for all social inequalities and social ills. There are quite a number problems within the existing reservation system and its implementation. There may also be a need to inject economic criteria along with the exclusion of creamy layers. All this however, does not mean that "positive discrimination" and "affirmative actions" are not required at all. We have to understand that we are trying to take a corrective action in the background of extreme segregation practiced over two millenniums.  
  

5\) Whenever a religious practice clashes with the constitutional principle(s), the latter is to be held supreme. Paradoxically, the Indian judiciary has yet to establish this supremacy in unequivocal terms.
