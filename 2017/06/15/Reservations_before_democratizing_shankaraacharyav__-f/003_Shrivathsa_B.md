hariH OM,

  

 The duplicity of the Veda democratizers in full flow. Speciousness finds embodiment in them.

  

1\. No word about why many among forward castes are poor and many among backward castes are rich (was true even when the idea of reservation was being conceptualized). Was this because there was a reservation in force for two millennia? Defies logic!

  

2\. When will the level playing field be achieved? Another two millennia? Or four? Until then, let the meritorious escape to foreign lands! Thus making the already technologically backward country even more backward. And make the country the slave of the west.

  

3\. Cherry picking on an obscure clause in reservation for a small subset of Brahmins while completely neglecting the plight of the poor among other "forward" castes.

  

4\. Monkey balancing act without an assertion or an acknowledgement as to whether they do recognise that poor exist even among "forward" castes.

  

5\. Then why not take the Brahmasutra issue to the Supreme court? (Fear of getting face blackened? Or confirmed of a forward caste conspiracy which will dismiss such a petition with costs imposed on the petitioner?)

  

The Veda democratizers are a political class with their scholarship driven only to political ends. No wonder that they don't even bat an eyelid while being this specious. Their whole philosophy rests on calumny of the greatest (men and ideas) to ever have trodden the earth. Their only licence being their birth in a "lower" caste. Can there be anything more ironic that those who want to oppose birth based stray references (as in the case of apashUdrAdhikaraNa) are the ones who are using their own birth to the maximum advantage! (Both to get government reservation and also to calumniate).

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                            shrivathsa.
