I have met the person who was approached by the local community in Sawantwadi Taluka to contest the Panchayat elections for a seat reserved for OBC category. The information is based on my direct interaction with him. I will be of course obliged if some knowledgeable person give me more information about this curious phenomenon of priest getting a reservation. My meeting with him took place about 10 years back and he was not averse to the idea of priest getting a reservation though he refused to contest the elections.

I don't understand all this. What gene theory? Genotype-phenotype relation is probability based. Further, mental markup and its relation to phenotype is not established. In fact emergence of mind and its relation to body itself is so complex that any straightforward explanation is ruled out. Hence there is no scope for racist theories when we are talking about individuals and social justice. Justice is an idea which transcends classes and races. Also, note that we are not talking bulldozed equality sans merit and context. We are talking about equality in the context of justice and constitutional framework.
