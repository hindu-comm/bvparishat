Thank you Shri Pravin ji.

English version was much upto what I was looking for.

It will take me some time to read the Swamy Pramathanandaji lecture.

Heartiest thanks once again.

  

  

Thank you to Shri Reddyji as well.

The link works but as Shri Pravin ji stated, the old hindi takes much time to read.

  

Regards to the contributors
