The English translation is available here:<https://archive.org/details/themetaphysicsof00sreeuoft> and the unchecked transcription of the first four chapters of Vichara Sagara as taught by Swami Paramarthanandaji is here:<http://arshaavinash.in/index.php/download/vichara-sagaram-by-swami-paramarthananda/>

  

I found the old Hindi difficult, but if you can lay your hand on Vichara Sagara Sanskrit by Swami Vasudeva Brahmendra, its quite readable, which is what I think the above lectures of Swami Paramarthanandaji would most likely be based on.

  

Kind rgds,
