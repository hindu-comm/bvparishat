Dear learned members,

  

I am looking for a book titled

  

Shri vichara sagara aur Shri Vritti ratnavali

By Sadhu Nischal das ji

  

In English, Hindi or Sanskrit script.(whichever available)

  

The book I have seen is some old hindi script not very familiar to understand.

Any help for download link or direct purchase through net will be much appreciated.

  

Thanks in advance.

Regards

Sudhakar Kabra
