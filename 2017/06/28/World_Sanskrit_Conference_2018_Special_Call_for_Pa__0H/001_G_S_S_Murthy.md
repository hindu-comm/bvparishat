Prof Amba Kulkarniji and other scholars,

I am vaguely thinking of submitting a paper. However I do not have Latex software. As a private person I am not associated with any academic Institution. I would like to know if some academic institution in India, preferably in Bangalore where I live, has the necessary Latex software package and can help me in formatting my proposed paper to meet the requirements of WSC.

Thanks and regards,

GSS Murthy
