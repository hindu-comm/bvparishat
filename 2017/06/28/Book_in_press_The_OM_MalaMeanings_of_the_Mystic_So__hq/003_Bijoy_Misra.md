Dear Sri Nityanand,  

This is refreshing. Congratulations.  

I like the cover design. I will read next month.  

Let me urge all to engage in constructive work than simply  

getting into reactivity and political debates. We have a huge  
amount of material to unearth, learn and disseminate.  

We have to create new literature for the free nation.  

Best wishes,  

BM
