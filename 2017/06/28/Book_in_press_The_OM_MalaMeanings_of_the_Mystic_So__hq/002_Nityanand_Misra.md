I forgot to add. The members of *Bharatiya-vidvat-parishat*are thanked in the Preface of the book:

  

“Another source of learning something new every day is the *Bharatiya-vidvat-parishat* mailing list, members of which have helped me on countless occasions while writing this book.”

  

So once again, thanks to all members of BVP for all the help.
