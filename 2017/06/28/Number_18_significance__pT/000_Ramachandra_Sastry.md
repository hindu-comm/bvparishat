Namaste,

  

One of my friend had a question to me, if there is special/unique significance for number 18 which denotes no of parvas in Mahabharata, days of war in Kurushetra, no of chapters in BG ..and so on...  

  

Else, is this just acoincidence?

  

Request scholarsto kindly provide the information.

  

Regards

Ramachandra
