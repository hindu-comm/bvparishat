Hello Sastry'ji,

  

If you can read Kannada - you can go through Dr. Bannanje's article "PuraNa Prapancha" pages 9-12. You can download the PDF from here:

<http://www.taraprakashana.org/shribgarticles.html> (filename -[05-PurANa_Prapancha.pdf](http://www.taraprakashana.org/downloads/tp-bg/articles/05-PurANa_Prapancha.pdf))

  

  

best regards,

Suresh
