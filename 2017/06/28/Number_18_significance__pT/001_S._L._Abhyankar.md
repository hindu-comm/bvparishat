-   There is mathematical significance also. Any number of zeros be
    inserted between 1 and 8, all such numbers are divisible by 18.
-   It seems this significance is used to denote status of spiritual
    attainment OR of knowledge of scriptures as in the addresses SHRI
    108, SHRI 1008, etc. More the number of zeros, more attained or more
    knowledgeable the person, rather the Swami is.
