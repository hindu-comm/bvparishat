As usual, our poor scholar Monier Monier-Williams simply copied the entry from Boehtlingk-Roth.

  

Boehtlingk-Roth get it wrong (no idea if they were ‘inspired’ by Wilson or it was a product of their incompetence).

  

पूजन\[L=46575\]\[p= 4-0829\] (wie eben) n.

— b) eine Sache, die Jmd ehrt: पूजनात्पूजितमनुदात्तं काष्ठादिभ्यः P. 8, 1, 67.

  

“eine Sache, die Jmd ehrt” (Jmd = jemand) means “a thing, that someone honours”.

  

The sense in the word पूजन in 8.1.67 is that of verbal activity by ल्युट् च (३.३.११५) or means by करणाधिकरणयोश्च (३.३.११७). Cannot be an object for sure.

  

PS: If the unscrupulous Monier-Williams were alive today and you called out his bluff, he would have blamed it on Dr. Shoenberg. After all, Monier-Williams “found it impossible to guard against a few errors of omission and commission due to the rapid impairment of his powers”. As the supremely grateful Monier-Williams wrote, Dr. Shoenberg “came to me in a condition of great physical weakness” and then “left me to die”.
