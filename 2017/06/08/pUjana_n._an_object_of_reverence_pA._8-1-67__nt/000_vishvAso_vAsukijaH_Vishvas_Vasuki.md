<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=641> claims this meaning:पूजन n. an object of reverence पा . 8-1-67  
  
I want to know if I am wrong in concluding that MW is mistaken based on the below?  
  
This meaningseems to be mistaken based on the meaning of the sUtra ( <http://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/8/1/67>) . काष्ठ। दारुण। अमातापुत्र। अयुत। अद्भुत। अनुक्त। भृश। घोर। परम। सु। अति। इतिकाष्ठादिः।      
      These are expressions of wonder. "पूजनात्" in the sUtra denote these pUjanavachana-s according to commentaries.        
    so, no "object of reference".            

  
Also kalpadruma and vAchaspatyam don't give this meaning.       
    

  
कृत्यल्युटो बहुलम्‌ can yield such meaning - but only if literature attests to use in such a sense - which I doubt.
