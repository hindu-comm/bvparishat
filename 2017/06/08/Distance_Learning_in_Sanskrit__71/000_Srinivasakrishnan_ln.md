Families of our acquaintance in the East Coast of the United States have asked if there are distance learning opportunities in Sanskrit for people normally resident in the US. Specifically the question seems to be, are there open universities in India which offer a BA in Sanskrit, for example? Prefered mediums are Telugu, Hindi or English. These are highly motivated students, of generally the Gita, who are currently
learning Sanskrit at middle/ high school level through popular institutions on their own or with help.

  

I'd be obliged to the group for any pointers in this regard.

  

Thanks and Warm Regards,
