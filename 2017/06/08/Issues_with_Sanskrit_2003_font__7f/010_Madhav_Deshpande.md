Hello Vikram,

  

  This is a wonderful news. Having done some font-designing myself, I know how time-consuming and complicated this work is. I hope your effort is successful and produces an improved version of Sanskrit 2003, with light, bold and italic versions. Please keep us posted about availability of these new versions. With best wishes,
