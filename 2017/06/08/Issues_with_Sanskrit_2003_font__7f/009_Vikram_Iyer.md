Hi Everyone,

  

          I am writing this as I am collaborating with a typography expert to create a better version of Sanskrit 2003 free for all with support for light weight and several ligature upgrades. As with any activity of this scale funds are required to be able to keep the project going. If anyone is willing to contribute financially please get in touch with me.

  

  

          A sample version of the upgraded font is attached below.
