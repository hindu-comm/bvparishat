Hi Rakesh,

  

       Namaste, Its gives me great pleasure to speak to people regarding this project. I am working with a typography expert Sridhar Murthy from Mudrika to create a light weight of the font. He also proposed to make some corrections to the existing**Bold**font.

  

       The font along with the glyphs come upto 977 in number. The timeframe for the lighter font is 4 - 6 months. Have attached a proposed sample version of the new light weight. I have had a discussion with the Swamiji who has created the original font, Swami Satchidhananda from Omkarananda Ashram and he has given a green signal to the proposal with the condition that it remains free for everyone. I have obliged to the same and he is excited about the continuity of the project making changes to it. I will be meeting the Swamiji to create a write up and to make it a crowd-sourced initiative. Vyoma Linguistic Labs, M.D has agreed to create a space on their website for people to track the status of the project including the funds collected so far.

  

       It has remained a dream project for me for the last 2 years. I also have a plan to add proper support for Vedic swaras (Rig and Sama) to the typography so that it can be consumed by everyone across digital and print media for everyone.

  

        The proposed quote for the project is**4 Lakhs**because of the complexity and the timeframe associated with it. The project will be done in Coreldraw or Adobe Indesign tools which support vector graphics based on my understanding.

I need support on the financial side of things because the sum is too big to consume only from my side. I believe there are provisions for tax rebate for the contribution to the same. I want to appeal to all organizations and individuals local and abroad because of the immense impact the font with light weights will have on the Sanskrit community which can be used in schools, organisations on all media.

  

  

        Let me know if you need additional information and it would be greatly helpful if you could make any generous contribution for a noble cause and also forward the same to people who will be willing to participate in this endeavour.

  

Regards,

  

Regards,

 

  Vikram
