Hi All,

  

  

   Just wanted to share my progress with the Sanskrit 2003 enhancement project that I am undertaking. The font is taking shape and is coming out well. I would like to post a sample from the light font being created is as attached.

  

   We are way too far behind completion and I need financial assistance. Kindly help me meet the objective for the largest benefit of the community, details of the project are shared in the same thread above.
