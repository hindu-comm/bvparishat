Namo namah

Sanskrit 2003 is a beautiful font.

Just sharing my exp & my wishlist..

\(1\) The issue I face is when words are underlined the line appears over the mAtrAs that r written below the letter...

  
(2) also we can't highlight/ bold a specific letter in a jodAxar ..the while jodAxar , mAtrA gets highlighted.. I have worked in shreelipi font which has this helping font...

Regards
