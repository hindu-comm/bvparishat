Dear Rajputji,

  

  I am using the same version of Sanskrit 2003 that you sent with your link. This is the version of the font from Oct 21, 2014 that is on the website of the Omkarashrama. It still has the same issues that I explained. I am wondering if these issues show up on Macs, but not on Windows.
