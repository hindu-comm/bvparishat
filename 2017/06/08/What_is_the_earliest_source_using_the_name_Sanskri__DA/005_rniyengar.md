Prof.Aklujkar,

Thanks for sharing your paper which is of interest to many of us here on BVP. I remember to have come across in the Vaitāna sūtra (1.5) which
most likely refers to abhicāra-prayoga.

Vācayati yajamānaṁ bhṛgvaṅgirovidā samskṛtam\|\|

This may perhaps indicate that the yajamāna spoke something slang after which the Brahma makes him speak in a refined way.

  

But in Bhasa’s Pañcarātra (II act) we find the following.

बृहन्नला : सुणादु भट्टा \|

राजा : ऊर्जितं कर्म \| संस्कृतमभिधीयताम् \|\|

बृ : श्रोतुमर्हति महाराजः \|

  

Please comment whether we can take the above to be a Prakrt-Samskrt juxtaposition.

  

regards

RNI
