I would like to add a footnote to Ashok Aklujkar's excellent article on this subject. There is a verse in Rāmāyaṇa (Sundarakāṇḍa 28.18)

yadi vācam pradāsyāmi

dvijātir iva saṃskṛtām \|

rāvaṇam manyamānā māṃ

sītā bhītā bhaviṣyati \|\|

“If I were to speak a cultured language (samskr̥tāṃ vācam) like a Brahmin, then Sītā would take me for Rāvaṇa, and be frightened.”

The word saṃskr̥tā appears to be an adjective of the word vācam. The other interesting thing is that half the manuscripts of Rāmāyaṇa have the reading satkr̥tāṃ vācam. The expression satkr̥ta corresponds more directly with the Prakrit 'sakkaya' and Pali 'sakkata' used to refer to Sanskrit. The word samskr̥ta corresponds to Pali saṃkhata, which is not used to refer to a language. So it seems that 'satkr̥ta' was one of the early expressions used to refer to Sanskrit besides the term 'saṃskr̥ta' itself. One of these terms became more mainstream, while the other term faded away.
