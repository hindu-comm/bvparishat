I am upset on hearing this news. He is a 'parama-guru' to people like us. I got a couple of opportunities to hear his precise, profound lectures in shaastra, as a PG student in Vidyapeetha. He was an epitome of knowledge and humility. His lucid and elaborate commentaries on Nyaya prakaraNa granthas is a great boon for a mandamati like me. It is an irreparable loss.  
  

यद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा ।  

तत्तदेवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसम्भवम् ।।
