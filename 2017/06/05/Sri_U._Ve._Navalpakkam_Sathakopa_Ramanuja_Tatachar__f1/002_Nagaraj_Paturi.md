We were waiting for his guidance at MITSVA, Pune.

  

There must be numerous such individuals and organizations feeling a sudden loss of support with his Vaikunthapraapti.

  

We can be sure of Vaikunthapaarishadatva for such divyapurushas.

  

We can only pray for their continued shubhaasheeh on us from their yonder divine abode.
