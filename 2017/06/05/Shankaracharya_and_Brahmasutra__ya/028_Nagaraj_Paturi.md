Dear Sri Sriram,

  

Having read aadaraNIya Sri Nityanand Misra-ji's posts for so many years you might be aware of his level of knowledge about all these issues. He himself is a great scholar of a Bhakti Vedanta tradition, as you know and he is aware of other Bhakti and Bhakti Vedanta traditions.

  

His comment was specifically focused and was argumentatively formulated.

  

In any case thanks for sharing your understanding of the tradition which I am sure can add value to interested members.

  

Regards,
