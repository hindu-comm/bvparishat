// From Arun Tiru (arun prabhakaran)r: Day before yesterday G Sudhakaran, minister for public works, while inaugurating Sri Shankaracharya Sanskrit University's Shankara Birth ceremony at University's regional center at Thuravoor Alleppy, said that AdiShankara lacks greatness and popularity comparing to E M S Namboodirippad, the first communist chief minister of Kerala. Because of his support to 'chaturvarnya' he is irrelevant hence public keep off from his birth day celebrations. //  
  

There is no question of comparing EMS with Shankara; such comparisons are odious! Communists never found anything worthwhile in Indian culture and history. They don't like Shankara, but did they like anybody else or anything else in the cultural tradition of Kerala? Say, Narayana Guru? The great Mathematics tradition of Kerala? Performing arts like Mohiniyattam, Thirayattam, Padayani etc.? Or Margam Kali the old dance of Christians?.. or Kerala's marital arts? They hate cultural nationalism even of liberal and moderate disposition. Their religious heads are all outside India. (Marxism was another dogmatic religion).  
  

Shankara is identified by today's scholars as the commentator of Brahmasutra. He supported apashUdradhikaraNa (BS 1.3.34-38) and as such supported hierarchical chAturvarNya. His other aupaniShad commentaries do not contradict his BS commentary. To keep consistency with his BS-commentary, he misinterpreted jAbAla story of ChAndogya. I have many posts on this topic in the archives "science-religion-philosophy" group. See [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/science-religion-philosophy/sChUPUEF3bk/overview). Also, see Adi Shankara on[shUdra-s](http://creative.sulekha.com/adi-sankar-on-sudras_325415_blog). (The references were checked by me).  
  
In Maharashtra, many scholars disagreed with Shankara's axiology (including nationalist leaders and scholars like Lokamanya Tilak in his famous Gita-Rahasya and Dr. K. L. Daftari in his Aupanishad Soukhya).  
  

To be fair to Shankara, he followed the framework of BS faithfully. Other AchArya-s did the same. BS framework provides not only apashUdradhikaraNa but also provides for the refutation of other Indian schools. I don't see any reason to refute these schools. They offer their own perspective and their refutation seems purposeless, today. So, instead of blaming BS framework, it is better to keep it aside except the preamble and the first four aphorisms (..a pa.nchapAdikA style). The full BS commentaries will be studied only in the academic circles while most of the references in the social circles will be confined to adhyAsa-bhAShya and first four sUtra-s. This is already happening.  
  

There is no point in blaming Shankara for hierarchical and hereditary chAturvarNya; he did not create it, though he could have reformed it. All the machinery was there in the form of Upanishads, Gita, and Mahabharata. Vivekanada had asked the question as to why Shankara could not use this machinery to grant shUdra-s the right to study Vedas and Upanishads.  
  
So, Shankara, the great theologian and the scholar, definitely deserves a university in his name. I am not sure however, if he can be the national icon which can connect with the socially deprived, or could be a model for social harmony (सामाजिक समरसता). This may happen only if we invent a new Shankara of maniSha pa.nchakam and devotional songs. The myth makers have already attempted to create this new Shankara but not forcefully enough to enter into the imagination of ordinary people. We Warkaris meanwhile have kept a respectful distance both from Shankara and from Brahmasutra.
