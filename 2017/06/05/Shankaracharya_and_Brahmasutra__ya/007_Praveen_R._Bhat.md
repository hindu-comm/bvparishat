That goes with any sutra work, including Panini's. The anuvRttis and thereby, explanation are learnt only in tradition.

That is true about all Upanishads and Gita, as well. Despite these mantras and verses being elaborate, there are various schools, tangential to each other.

Oh, but it does, in sampradAya. Its not for no reason that it is called as a nyAyaprakaraNa.

I agree, except for the instead part. One need not be exclusive of the other.

As you said, he was not the creator of the system but a follower. There are many a national icon who have included only a smaller or larger sections of society, be it by varNa, community, specialty or other.

Sure, a free society indeed.

The commentaries were on works which themselves were meant for particular classes. Why is Bhagavatpadacharya to blame for that! The perspectives differ. Sant. Tukaram could be said to not have a "trace of scholarship" since he did not write commentaries and therefore, Vedantins keep him away, but that would be comparing apples and oranges. Yet, Sant. Tukaram and Shankaracharya are both national icons. Not everyone needs to be all-inclusive to be national icons. Each system of study, including modern education, is based on adhikAribheda. The modern education can obviously consider qualifications of one life, while Vedanta of across lives based on karma theory. Still, Shankaracharya never denied mokSha to anyone, which is why he went beyond the prasthAnatraya and wrote prakaraNas, stotras and shlokas which themselves could lead one to mokSha. To conclude, his commentaries may not be all-inclusive but other works definitely were.

I was hoping that someone would answer this question for my academic interest.

Thanks much
