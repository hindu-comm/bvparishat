Interpreting differently doesn't have to mean misinterpretation.

Quite a lot of the refutations are meant to resolve one's own confused thinking in manana. Ergo, there is a purpose. Most people do not even know what bits and pieces they have picked up from random philosophies growing up. When they come to Advaita Vedanta proper, they start drawing similarities with those and risk concluding wrongly. The structured study of Brahmasutra bhAShya beyond chAtussUtrI, even if many things may seem irrelevant, help resolve the misunderstandings gathered.

Bhagavatpadacharya is a national icon, but I'd be surprised if someone has to connect with socially deprived in all expected ways to be a national icon.

If a new Shankaracharya is invented, wouldn't that be a myth? In another mail ahead you ask "should we create and propagate myths in first place?" We Vedantins respect and love the Shankaracharya as he is, with or without the existent stories that some call myths, some as facts. Why should new be added?

May I ask as to what this means? Does this mean that Varkaris belong to Shankarasampradaya and distanced themselves or were they only influenced by his works, in which case there is no real distancing themselves.
