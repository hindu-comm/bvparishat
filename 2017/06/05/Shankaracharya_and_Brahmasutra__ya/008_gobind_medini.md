You have not understood my point; when you have a coherent treatise why go for convoluted sUtra-bhAShya? Just to show that one cannot learn without a tradition? There are good prakaraNa-grantha-s both in Sanskrit as well as in local language. Why not read and understand them without getting entangled in BS in the name of tradition?

See my above comment. In fact read Upanishads and Gita yourself if you want to understand why Shankara had to use certain schemes like adhyAropa-apavAda, sattA-siddhAnta etc.

I don't understand the fixation about BS other than clinging to the tradition in the name of nyAyaprasthAna. Make Yogasutra as the nyAya prasthAna where nyAya is interpreted as moral way (as judgment), it will give some decent values instead giving you apashUdradhikaraNa.  

Most of the times, saMpradAya is another excuse for effete and stale thinking!

See my above comment. Upadesha sAhasrI is not the only treatise. There are very many others, one can follow any of them.

Yes, he was a follower.. follower leading his follower! Who is jagad-guru then? Buddha, Vivekananda, Gyaneshvar, Tukaram, Narayana-Guru, Kabir, Nanak ..all of them had a broader, inclusive vision. Yes, comparisons are odious but I can't help making them here.

For being a national icon, one has to be inclusive. Scholarship is a lesser criterion!

Warkaris as Bhagavatas follow the Bhagavata dharma based on Gyaneswari, Eknathi Bhagavat, and Gatha. Sometimes Dasbodh which is an Advaita Vedanta work (Gaudapada and Yogavasistha variety) is also included. Well known Marathi scholar Dr S. D. Pendse opines that Bhagavata philosophy (ontology, epistemology) is that of Advaita while axiology is different, it is Gyana-Karma Samuchaya which is not acceptable to Shankara. IMO, Tukaram is the distinguished mark of Bhagavata tradition. He is the protagonist of egalitarian liberation theology whose analog now can be seen in South America and Mexico (developed independently).
