Yes Sir! We are supposed to do that generation-after-generation without any respite.

Sir, I have not rejected Shankara or any body for that matter, I am only expressing my discomfiture and fear towards a supposed national icon who endorses putting hot oil (or whatever) in our ears even if we accidentally hear a word from Vedas or Upanishads.

Are you serious Sir, when you quote such passages out of context?

We have no problem with obscenity Sir, we are after all low class people. Some of us have also heard about so called ribald obscenities described in Vedas about Ashvamedha Yagya etc. We have no problem with that either. We take it as repressed sexuality expressed in a ritualistic manner.

I am not at all perfect in all respect sir, and I am not seeking to be a national icon. Finding faults does not give me high at all. But I do that occasionally, not always.

I don't think I am self-righteous excessively, but is self-righteousness bad?

Warkaris like me love Gyanaba and Tukaram. We remember Pasayadana when we remember Gyaneshvara.

Of course not sir!

No sir; in fact the lack of traditional learning allows me to look at the things impartially.

Sir, Vivekananda was frank enough to apply course correction even in his own thinking. You can also show some passages from his speeches etc.which are not in sync with the fashionable secular thinking which is prevalent today. Yet his thinking and message is in conformance with our constitution and modern sensibilities.
