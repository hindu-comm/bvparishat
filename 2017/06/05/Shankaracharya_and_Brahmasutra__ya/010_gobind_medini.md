Gita, and Upanishads might have mentioned shUdra-s but they do not slot shUdra-s to the lowest rung of servitude nor do they deny shUdra-s the access to Vedas or other scriptures. Not only that, Gita offers many shlokas which teach "samatva"- the unity and parity seen by an equanimous mind in all life forms. As against that Shankara enthusiastically defends apashUdrAdhikaraNa which denies shUdra-s the access to Vedas, misinterprets aupaniShad passages to justify this prohibition, indirectly authenticates smRRiti-s which confine shUdra-s to servitude, and if I may say so, uses unsavory language in few of his comments (please, see the Sulekha link provided by me).

Early Buddhism was positivist, rationalist, and at the same time set "alleviation of sufferance" as the main goal of dhamma by preaching Arya-Satya and Dwadasha-Nidana. This is not to suggest that it remained without any blemish through its history. It competed with Vedic dharma as well as with other cults of popular Hinduism and in the process became the pale version of popular Hinduism.. recall Vajrayana and many other cults developed within it in Tibet and elsewhere. The point is, we cannot justify one bad with another bad.
