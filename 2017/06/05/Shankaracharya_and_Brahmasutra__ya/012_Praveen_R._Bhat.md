And you, my response since that's not the point you made; please look above. In any case, the same argument holds with all works. Jnaneshvari's Marathi is convoluted and lost on many, still it is studied. The author himself gets lost in examples many times and tries to pull himself back to the topic by stating that his brother is saying: enough with examples! See? I could find faults too where they don't belong!

Learn? Why not! Advaita Vedanta goal? Definitely not! You don't become a doctor by studying medical books by yourself.

Its clear that those who think they are entangled in Br. Su. have very biased views and selective reading, especially not having learnt in the teaching tradition.

Ditto. adhyAropa-apavAda, sattA, etc, is a shruti scheme, not created by Bhagavatpadacharya! Upanishads use a creation story, koShaviveka, avasthAtrayaviveka, sharIraviveka and refute all those by explaining these schemes.

If you do not understand it, that is perfectly alright. I'm sure many outside Varkari tradition do not understand the same too.

That is also accepted in the orthodox AV tradition and Bhagavatpadacharya is said to be the author of Vivarana on VyasabhAShya.

Those who made it so may have made such "misinterpretation" of nyAya to meet their own needs, which is okay too, but pointing to others about things they do not understand is not. With morality as a bias, no text can become nyAya (tarka/ logic) prasthAna. The logic of understanding things as they are does not work with emotional biases, especially in jnAnamArga. Jnaneshvari itself interpreted with such biases will need a new vyutpatti for jnAna.

apashUdradhikaraNa written not by Bhashyakara, but by Badarayana Veda Vyasa, is inside the value system, different from yours or mine in this era. I wonder if Bhagavatas keep Bhagavat Purana and its author also out of their following unless they consider authors of Bh. Pu. and Br. Su. as different.

And self-learning is what leads to such self-righteousness.

And I repeat, one need not exclude the other. prakaraNas are meant for those who do not have adhikAra in prasthAnatraya, due to lack of learning or karma, in this life or across.

If all leaders who are followers are not jagadgurus, then only Ishvara is jagadguru. Else jagadguru is a samAsa that can resolve in more ways than one that you see. For eg, one Sringeri "jagadguru" said it for Himself so: jagat guru yasya saH.

I wonder whether any great scientist fits the bill either then.

Thanks. In that case, Varkaris can't be keeping distance from someone whose tradition they never belonged to.
