Dear Sri Gobind Medini-ji,

  

Your narration of the sequence in which you came to know of different aspects of Shankara, clearly show that yours is a sample of how intellectuals get introduced to Shankara.

  

That is not the way 'ordinary people' come to know of Shankara.

  

They know stotras like Mahishasura mardini stotra; like them for their aesthetic qualities; then they come to know that Shankara is the author of them. They do not even remotely know about the authorship debates among researchers about each of the stotra.

  

Adavaita Vedanta ideas like Maayaa and Mithyaa form part of popular vocabulary. The understanding is usually not detailed, rigorous, or accurate.

  

When they look at the pictures or sculptures of Shankara, they identify who he is; express reverence; remember some hagiographical narratives like crocodile holding his leg to make his mother agree to his sanyaasa sveekaara etc.

  

------------------

  

When we say, learned in Advaita Vedanta , that does not mean they are modern educated. There are a huge number of rural spiritual practitioners who know minute details of Advaita Vedanta, practice-oriented details of it such as PancheekaraNa and so on, but without modern education. I know many of them hailing from the communities considered to be at lower ranks of social hierarchy too. I know many hailing from tanner-cobbler communities too with a high level of knowledge, spiritual experience and spiritual progress following Advaita Vedanta, some of them living an ascetic life , some others family life.

  

These can not be called 'ordinary people'

  

---------------------

  

Naga Sadhus are of Shankara parampara only.

  

--------------------

 There are many modern Shankarite monks hailing from 'non- Brahmin', 'non-dvija' communities.  

  

-----------------------------------

  

Reality of these things is so complex that eludes always any easy generalization.

  

Warm regards,
