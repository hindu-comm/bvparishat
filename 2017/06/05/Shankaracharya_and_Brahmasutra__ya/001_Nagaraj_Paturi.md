Dear Sri Gobind Medini-ji,

Which S'ankara do you think,is in the imagination of ordinary people? The one who commented on theapashUdradhikaraNa(BS 1.3.34-38) ? Ordinary people? Do ordinary people know these details?  

  

it is the S'ankara of devotional songs who is in the popular imagination. We need not invent such a S'ankara. No myth maker needs to try to create that S'ankara or forcefully enter him into the popular imagination. Who is in the popular imagination is the S'ankara of devtional songs only.

  

The non-scholarly non-researching but book-reading type Indians know the S'ankara of hagiographies with all the funny stories like parakaayapraves'a to learn kaamas'aastra etc.

  

Recently a Telugu movie was made with all such stuff and the most awkward thing in that movie for me was making Mandana Mishra into a comedian like humorous character.

  

Such movies are effective in affecting the popular imagination.

  

The scholarly S'ankara known through his commentaries and other rigorous works is the one known only to scholars and is beyond the popular imagination.
