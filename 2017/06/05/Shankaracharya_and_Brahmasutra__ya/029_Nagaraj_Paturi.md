                             =========== Closing note=========

  

1\. This thread was initiated by respectable Vidwan Sri Gobind Medini-ji focusing on the question f S'ankara's status as national icon vis-a-vis his inclusive or otherwise approach based on his bhaashya of apas'UdrAdhikaraNa of Brahmasutras.

  

2\. Sri Gobind Medini-ji's posts are welcome addition to the group as he brings in things like Warikari tradition, one of the great Bhakti traditions of India. His aadhyaatmika abhinivEs'a and his amazing erudition, his nationalist spirit evoke a great respect in me. He is one of the younger members of the list coming from technology background but very much learned in various Indic knowledge traditions.

  

3\. We know all the younger participants in the thread how respectably learned they are. It gives great pleasure to see all these youngsters to be so erudite in the Indic knowledge traditions, Sanskrit, Shaastras etc. , their respect for the tradition, their abhinivEs'a for aadhyaatmika saadhana etc.

  

4\. Whether books and authors under discussion are inclusive or not , this forum is.

  

5\. National Icon status of S'ankara is not given or removed by us. It is already established. We are here only to study how he acquired it, due to which qualities, activities, contributions and situations.

  

6\. Irrespective of whether our ancestors were inclusive or not we must be.

  

7\. It is through various traditions such as Warikari that the anti-inclusive tendencies in our society which always originate from the hegemonic and other personality disorders of individuals have been being balanced from time to time in our society.

  

8\. Thanks to all the scholars for their enlightening contributions.

  

The thread is being closed.
