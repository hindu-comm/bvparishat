It is difficult to make a general statement; but I consider myself an ordinary Indian (Hindu) and I came to know about Shankara in following sequence: (a) As the great Guru of Hindus, (b) As Bhashyakara, (c) Manishpanchakam and devotional songs came much later.

As I said earlier, the Shankara of devotional songs came into my imagination quite late. I do not know how many people know a particular Stotra in Sanskrit in the name of Shankara. At least I did not know it until I saw Stotraratnavali published by Gita Press, Gorakhpur. This happened after I have read all Shankara Bhashyas as translated and published by Ramakrishna Matha.

Yes. I have heard them too though I have not read the original hagiographies or their translations.

Movies are quite a powerful medium to effect or affect the public imagination. (I have not seen any movie on Shankara, though I have heard about a movie on him in Sanskrit by G. V. Iyer). I hope, that movie does not caricature Mandana Mishra. That would devalue Shankara too!

That is right. But let us face it.. both Shankara of hagiographies as well as Shankara of Manishapanchakam are created by myth-makers. We can project the latter Shankara on social platforms without claiming his historicity (that is without claiming Manishpanchakam as history). Is it a correct thing to do? Are we projecting the real Shankara in the public imagination? That is, should we create and propagate myths in first place?. In Vedanta it is acceptable in the name of Adhikari Bheda and Arundhati Nyaya. Such myths and theories are used only as a pedagogical tools. However, in general this approach needs to be taken with caution; otherwise the history and objective truth itself may become irrelevant one day.
