I assume, you have read the entire thread in science-religion-philosophy archives. If not, it is [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/science-religion-philosophy/sChUPUEF3bk/TsWNomxjAQAJ). After reading that thread if you draw the conclusion that Shankara's interpretation is a mere interpretation, then I have no further arguments.

BS aphorisms were formulated or compiled in a bygone era as memory aids when writing was not in practice. The brevity of these aphorisms add to confusion rather than clarity. The very fact that there are half a dozen vedAnta schools which argued against each other on the basis of BS does not make a good case for clarity. One can study BS and various subsequent commentaries to track the evolution of a particular tradition. This whole exercise has academic value but I don't think it adds to the understanding of the shA.nkara vedAnta. Instead the most authentic shA.nkara vedAnta may be found in upadesha-sAhasrI where sha.nkara is not bound to BS framework.

How can one become the national icon if he excludes a large section of people from studying Vedas and Upanishads - the very foundation of the theology which he was preaching? He used and authenticated the very same smRRiti-s which permanently slotted this large section to the lowest rung of servitude.

You can of course love and respect Shankara. Ours is a free society, but lower caste people like us find no reason to love Shankara. We have our Gyanaba-Tukaram. We love them not because of their caste but because of their inclusive outlook. We don't see a trace of it in Shankara's commentaries.
