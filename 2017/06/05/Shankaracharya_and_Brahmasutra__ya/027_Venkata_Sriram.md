Namaste Mishraji,

  

It is similar to medieval vaishnava bhakti movement that connected the downtrodden, sanskrit-illiterate common folks. One of their important objectives is to conduct pilgrimage to Pandaripura. 

  

As sanskrit was associated with scholars (paNDita-bhASa), an alternate path was conceived by Jnaneshwar Maharaj to connect common people.
Thus, He composed 'hari-pATha" which is in Marathi and is sung by all warakaris during their Pandari yatra. In order to reach to the common masses, Jnaneshwar Maharaj composed all His works in Marathi, unlike in Sanskrit, even though, He was a great sanskrit scholar, great yogi and tarka shAstra paNDita.

  

Interestingly, He was a great shAkta and was initiated into the secrets of kauLa path in the lineage of nAtha-sampradAya. His work 'amritAnubhava' and 'jnAneshwari' speaks testimony to this fact. His mastery & knowledge of kuNDalini vidya is unique if one studies His 'jnAnEshwari" especially the 6th chapter where He describes the typical upsurge of sarpa from mUlAdhAra.

  

However, all said and done, He was a sampradAya-vAdin and showed great respect towards Sankara Bhagavatpada. After getting inspired with 'saundaryalahari', He wrote 'amritAnubhava' (shAnkari vidyA - in the words of Jnaneshwar Maharaj) which is on similar lines and He was also a votary of Goddess Sapthashringi, near Vani village at Nasik. The samadhi of the preceptor of nAtha-sampradAya is here (Guru Matsyendranatha). I have visited this place.
