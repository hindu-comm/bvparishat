If Shankara is at fault, what about the BG itself:

  

  

कृषिगौरक्ष्यवाणिज्यं वैश्यकर्म स्वभावजम्।  

*परिचर्यात्मकंकर्म शूद्रस्यापि स्वभावजम् ॥ ४४ ॥*

*  
*

श्रेयान्स्वधर्मोविगुणः  
परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात्।*  
*

  

स्वकर्मणातमभ्यर्च्य  
सिद्धिंविन्दतिमानवः॥ ४६ ॥  

  

सहजंकर्मकौन्तेय  
सदोषमपिनत्यजेत्।  

  

There is nothing that Shankara or other smritis have done that is not already done by the BG. So, there is absolutely no basis or justification in segregating the BS from the BG as far as this aspect is concerned. Shankara has only stuck to the BG and other smritis that are in tune with it. Also, the scripture does not see the 'servitude' a malaise; it rather sees it as a stepping stone to liberation itself!! 

  

In fact there are popular instances where the BG copies have been burnt wholesale in public places by the so-called oppressed for the sole reason that it contains the term 'chāturvarṇyam'. Such people have not seen any difference between the BG and the Manu smriti. So, it is wrong to fault Shankara or the BS for one's own misunderstanding/misinterpreting these texts.
