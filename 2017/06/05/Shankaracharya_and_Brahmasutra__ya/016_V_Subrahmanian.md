It is fundamentally wrong to compare the BS with the other prasthana-s. BS has for its primary purpose the settling of doubts regarding the purport/meaning of particular vedanta vākyas. That is why there are adhikaranas: (as per both purva (veda vakyas) and uttara mimamsa):

  

<http://sanskritdictionary.com/manoj%C5%AB/1017/4>  

  

According to the Mīmāṁsakas a complete Adhikaraṇa consists of five members : विषय the subject or matter to be explained, विशय or संशय the doubt or question arising upon that matter, पूर्वपक्ष the first side or prima facie argument concerning it, उत्तर or उत्तरपक्ष or सिद्धान्त the answer or demonstrated conclusion, and संगति pertinency or relevancy, or (according to others निर्णय the final conclusion); विषयो विशयश्चैव पूर्वपक्षस्तथोत्तरम् । निर्णयश्चैति सिद्धान्तः शास्त्रे$धिकरणं स्मृतम् ॥

  

Such is not the case with the BG and upanishads. There is no rule that the BS should cover the entire gamut of the upanishads and the BG. Only those particular points that need clarification, in the view of the sutrakara are complied in the sutras. A bhashyakara's role is clearly defined: to bring out the intent of the sutra/sutrakara. You and I are nobody to dictate terms to either the sutrakara or the bhashyakara as to what their job is and how they should go about it. Shankara says in an upanishad bhashya: We are here to bring out the purport of the veda vakya and not to dictate what the veda should or should not say.  A follower of Shankara first appreciates that and then alone the learning process succeeds.
