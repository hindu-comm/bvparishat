Dear Sri Gobind ji,

  

The followers of Shankara do not feel uncomfortable with the Manishapanchakam. There is nothing in the work that warrants that. It is quite popular in the scriptures to have someone as a Brahma jnani who is a non-brahmin or someone following a profession that is not regarded as 'clean', and that he is revered as a teacher. The case of Dharma vyadha is just one. Shankara himself, in the apashudradhikarana has said that there is no bar for a shudra to acquire self knowledge. In the ajatashatru brahmanam of the Brihadaranyaka there is the case of a brahmin, Balaki, getting instruction from a kshatriya jnani on atma tattva.

  

Some decades ago a group of people from Karnataka went to Sringeri with the evil design of cornering the then Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamiji with their misconceived notion of the manisha panchakam. They asked him: Shankaracharya said he would accept a chandala for a guru. Would you do that? The Swamiji without losing his cool replied: If we come across such a chandala who is a Brahma jnani, we would happily follow the method of our Great Acharya. Needless to say the group of men were shown their place.
