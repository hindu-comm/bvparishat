If a particular person is inclined towards services as his natural disposition let him do it. Why connect it with birth and Upanayana? Gita is not saying that. Sahaja = that which comes naturally, aptitudinal.

I disagree. Gita is a syncteric text and is not a reformist text. Gita is giving here concession to those who are attuned to varNAshrama. However, this varNashrama is not necessarily connected to birth or hierarchy. Sahaja is something which comes naturally or aptitudinally. We don't have assume that it is connected with birth or hierarchy. A butcher's son need not be a butcher, he could be a poet if poetry comes to him naturally.

BG's copies have been burnt probably because some vested interests are using BG to perpetuate their class hegemony by improper interpretation. In any case, I oppose burning of Gita or any other scripture. Warkaris respect Gita, Upanishads, and Vedas; and modern Warkaris interpret them using their ability of discrimination (Viveka). They know how to reconcile scriptures with modern times. (As some body here has said, interpretation is my favorite word :-)  
  

I am not blaming Shankara, I respect him as a theologians and a scholars. However, I will not accept him blindly. If he tells something or endorses something which is repugnant to my moral conscience, I will not accept it.
