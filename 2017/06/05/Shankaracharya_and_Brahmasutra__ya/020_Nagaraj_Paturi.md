                 ================== Moderator's note===================

  

I note with sadness that some of the respected members are resorting to unnecessary harshness towards the other member while trying to defend their position or countering the position of the other member.

  

May it be remembered that BVP is a space where polite , decent exchanges alone are allowed.

  

Strength of our argument should lie only in our logic and it should not be replaced by or supplemented with expressions that cast aspersions about the respondent. Doing so can give an impression of lack of strength in our argument.

  

I admire the restraint shown by those members who are keeping their politeness in tact or not resorting to harshness even under provocations.

  

More inclusive approach is good for the nation and an antidote to nation-breaking forces.

  

An argument that a book or author is not enough inclusive can be answered by 1. inclusiveness in that author or book by seeking right interpretation or through other methods of reasoning 2. saying that his approach is limited by his times and his non-inclusive aspects are not essential foundations of his whole argument and so can be discarded without harm to his core central theses.

  

But to try to justify or support non-inclusive approach is not the solution.

  

If there are no further arguments to be made on healthy lines the thread can be closed.

  

Members resorting to harsh expressions shall be brought under 'moderated' category.
