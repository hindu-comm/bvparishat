... because... they are also sutras. You said sutras are memory aids used when there was no practice of writing; that was one of your reasonings for Br. Su. adding to confusion than clarity. Let that be, I don't want to run around in circles.

I find medical books without a teacher convoluted too. :)

Great, others don't, even though Marathi is their mother tongue. So the argument holds.

That is why it is a nyAyaprasthAna (tarka); it is the very first task of a tarka grantha!

No, direct study is already prohibited in all dharma shastras, but study via prakaraNas, smritis and itihAsa is not prohibited, nor is mokSha denied. It just restates it. Now, I am afraid that most of those who object to something being prohibited, they think that the other classes enjoy it and we don't. The attitude is "I want to do it because the other does it and I am not allowed". Unfortunately, there is no other

purpose

. The same goal attained by other, albeit, simpler means, are rejected by them! That is termed as a social injustice.

One can go on and apply this indirectness to everything under the sun! Sanskrit study is not denied for anyone please. Mere listening to Panini sutras themselves are said to be chittashuddhikAraka for all varNas.

The difficulty of understanding is no basis to reject anything, especially if there are many other who understand it.

Same is true with Panini sutras. No one studies Br. Su. without commentaries.

Yes, I do celebrate it and I am very well learning it in the sampradAya itself, thanks.





And whoever said I am being stopped.

You are the one who said instead: "M

ake Yogasutra as the nyAya prasthAna

".

Thats the idea! Finding faults with ekadesha approach is laughable, be it with Jnaneshvari or Br. Su. :)

Why not? After all, yours was a standard argument of apashUdradhikaraNa.

Yes, but you do not seem to throw away the baby with the bath water with one idea you do not agrees with there, do you?

If self-learning is a tradition, I am a doctor without patients. :)

In my mind too, I am just as impartial as you are in your mind.

I've already answered earlier with the list

so: creation stories,

koShaviveka, avasthAtrayaviveka, sharIraviveka.

I was not planning to quote it, but since you are pre-decided, I could ask you not to quote apashUdradhikaraNa :)

All Upanishads, all AV commentaries.

Bhashyakara was a sampradAyavit, not sampradAyakRt. He is required for people to understand the teaching of prasthAnatraya right and get mokSha. I don't carry my emotions to learning. For ex. when I studied sannyAsopaniShad, I didn't cry that I may not be eligible for particular type of sannyAsa if we strictly go by nail marks, etc!

Why not! If you can blame Bhashyakara, I am just passing the buck upwards. You can take it from there wherever you want to stop.

The self-realization process starts with chittashuddhi, but doesn't end there.

Because it rejects that yoga can give mokSha.

Because the goal of yoga is not svarga, but chittashuddhi and aid vAsanakShaya in AV and chittavRttinirodha and kaivalya in yoga.

I can be the most socially just person, but that doesn't give me mokSha.



In any case, yama has nothing to do with caste-class discrimination, for or against. ahimsA cannot be interpreted as non-discrimination, that would be against satya. :)

True, but one doesn't reach and end directly, without the path that leads to it.

Not in jnAnakANDa and prasthAnatraya.

That suggestive measure is incorrect. Vedanta already has chittashuddhi as a basis to it, which includes yoga. So prAptasya prApti cannot be done.

Emotional biases don't account for morality.



mImAmsakas conclude that dharma is learnt from shAstras. What is moral in social conduct has no say on Veda dharma.

To what end? The goal will be diluted along with it. Indian constitution has no say in matters of mokSha. It can socially be appealing, but would not suit the purpose of the Vedas. Of course, legally, the social conduct holds, but in a personal journey, Vedas override all social rules. If we go your way too, Vedas themselves say follow deSha, kAla, nIti, but not for mokSha.

That's convenient, whatever helps. For many, Shankaracharya is also not one person, but not for me!

Thats ardhajaratinyAya. If you want to follow that with Bhagavatam, the same can be done with Jnaneshvari and Br. Su. alike.

You could, but to no fruitful end. I too would like to like to be Hercules, but my upbringing, my genes, my food habits, lifestyle, etc, do not allow. I'd like to help patients with some medicines that I think are perfect for them, but somehow I am not qualified. someone would like to say so: I'd like to get great marks for medical school, but I don't understand with the same even if taught more than my friend who is brilliant and gets it immediately. Sorry, they tell me. Its my brain which is this way; science and the medical colleges are against me. They don't tell me why I have such a brain. Vaidikas tell me its my karma. I don't believe that nonsense. I should be able to do it just like my friend. Boo hoo, they tell me.

Not 



even hypothetically? :) Then again, it is aprAptasya niShedhaH. If Varkaris never belonged to Shankarasampradaya, where is the question of keeping him aside?!

Some non-Nazi scientists tell me only some people are qualified to understand their work. These people don't like it and call such scientists Nazis.

Thats laughable too. :)





  

I think we both have made our cases.
