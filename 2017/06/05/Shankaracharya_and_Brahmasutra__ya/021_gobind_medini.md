That is the point I made, why to refer something which has no clarity. I find it convoluted.. and yes, even the structure of BS is convoluted.

It is an independent coherent treaties with Gita as its basis. With little bit of explanation I understand it and can appreciate its poetic beauty. Marathi is my mother tongue and with little efforts I can understand the text. In fact, Pasayadana could be understood by me without efforts. I have already explained my reservations about BS: (1) It refutes other schools, (2) It prohibits lower classes from studying Vedas (and indirectly Sanskrit itself, think about it), (3) its pithiness and structure makes the understanding difficult; (4) As an exercise of standardization through memory aids, BS in itself has become redundant (though not the commentaries thereon); (5) Animal sacrifices are endorsed in BS (admittedly they are also there in Vedas).  
  
However, if you want to celebrate and study BS then nobody is stopping you.

Standard argument of Priests, Mullas, and Maulavis! Theosophy is not science and technology. Further, I am not suggesting that tradition is always wrong or to be rejected. Don't think in black and white. I have my own Warkari tradition and even there I use my faculty of discrimination.

Again tradition :-) I have my tradition of self-learning. It allows me to look at the collective tradition with impartially and with fresh perspective.

Where is adhyArope-apavAda in Shruti? Don't quote Paingala a solitary reference inserted most probably post-Shankara. And where is sattA-siddhAnta? Mundaka..may be. You are hell bent on denying any creativity to Shankara, then why is he required? He is a good follower of the tradition and nothing more. But by the way, where is this apashUdrAdhikaraNa in Vedas?...blame it on Badarayana or Vyasa (or whoever)!

I am aware of it. Even Vedantasara includes all the eight limbs of Yoga and Madhusudana includes it in entirety making it essential part of Self-realization process. Then why do you need BS? In fact Yama are against animal sacrifices and caste-class discrimination. You can take a break from Vedas here. Vedanta is an end of Vedas not only as conclusion but also as a literal end of Vedic practices (kAmya-karma).

Nyaya is a polysemic word with multiple meaning. Morality as a bias! It is not bias, it a corrective factor. I am suggesting that Vedanta tradition has applied and assimilated Yoga as a moral corrective. Stick with it.

Jnanamarga without moral basis is no Jnanamarga. Yoga provide that moral basis.

That is what I am saying. We should reconcile it with modern times (in India, with Indian constitution).

We take Vyasa as a compiler of scriptures and there could be number of Vyasas. Vyasa is not one person.

We don't accept application of karma doctrine here and adhikAra in prasthAnatraya etc. That is the difference between modern Bhagavatas and traditional Vedicas. In fact we don't accept authority of smRRiti-s in this respect. I am repeatedly mentioning apashUdrAdhikaraNa to bring out this point. If I have an inclination to study Vedas, Upanishads or whatever, I should be able to apply myself without talking about my karma or birth etc.

Yes, Ishvara is (hypothetical) jagadguru. No body else. In our avadhUta (Dutta) tradition one can have multiple Gurus even animals and prostitute :-) There is no Jgadaguru and not certainly Shankara.

Scientists can fit the bill. But a Nazi Scientist cannot.
