 Wow, Gobind, you excel at drain inspection. For you, anyone, any book who doesn't meet your standards is to be rejected.  

 Let us do the same exercise for Jnaneshwari which you seek to juxtapose with BS.

  

1\. Propagation of superstition.

ते एकवांचूनि अघवा शास्त्री सिद्धान्त निर्माणधात्री । परी जळो ते मूळनक्षत्रे । Jnaneshwar suggesting that the learning of the one not oriented towards adhyAtmavidyaa is like the child born in mUlA nakShatra. The drift being that just as a mUlA nakShatra child brings bad to the family, the shaastea learning of a person not oriented towards adhyAtmavidyaa is dangerous. So, 1/27 part of the population branded as bad by Jnaneshwar? Secondly it can also be "interpreted" (Gobind's favourite word) as abuse of scholars.  

  

2. Obscenity

In the context of avyabhicaariNii bhakti

रिगता वल्लभा पुढे । नाही आङ्गी जीवी साङ्कडे । तिये तियेकान्तेचेनी पाडे । एक सरला जो । example of a woman sleeping with her husband to show avyabhicaariNii bhakti.

  

नातरी जीवाचिये सेजे । गुरु कान्तु करूनी भुञ्जे । ऐसी प्रेमाचेनी भोजे । "He makes the guru his husband and makes love on the bed of jiivaatmaa."

  

If one were to look closely, every single work and person in this world can be called faulty. Let us ask you, why you seek crap? Are you perfect in all aspects? Does finding faults give you a high?

  

I am Jnaneshwar maharaj's bhakta but I had to cull out the above to get you out of your self righteousness. So, what next? You think the Warkaris will throw out Jnaneshwari? They have better brains and not affected by toxins unlike you.

  

Stop blowing hard. You are not the first to discover apashUdrAdhikaraNa. You also think your lack of traditional learning to be some chip on your shoulder.

  

About people the case is far worse. You can find many chinks in Vivekananda's personality. Too bad he wasn't of immaculate conception as you think your magnanimous self to be.

  

It is some great vyuShTi of their heinous sins that Jnaneshwar and Tukaram had to get you as their votary. Your approach is execrable to the extreme.

  

Shrivathsa.
