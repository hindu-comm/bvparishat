The following is a 'proverb' from India, as reported in the book 'Chips of jade: being Chinese proverbs with more folk-sayings from Hindustan and other oriental countries

'. I remember this to be a Sanskrit subhashit, which also includes a sati stri, and has cobra's jewel in place of serpent's fang.

  

The Lion’s Mane, the Miser’s Hoard,  
The Serpent’s Fang, the Brave Man’s Sword,  
Ye may obtain — when they are dead.

Can anyone help me with the Sanskrit original?

Thanks.
