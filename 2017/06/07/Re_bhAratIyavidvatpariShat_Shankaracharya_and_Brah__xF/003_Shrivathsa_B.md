Oh. 13 c jnanadeva is mentioning, but Shankara is endorsing.

How specious can it get!

  

Gobind, regardless of your nitpicking and slander, Shankara and Jnaneshwar together with a host of other satpuruShas are national icons. You think you can slander and deny them the same. But the reality is quite the opposite. You succeeded in slandering yourself. Your juxtaposition of BS and Jnaneshvari is mere cherry picking.

  

Your "non traditional" approach is exclusively to slander Shankara. Nothing more. Quite natural for ill informed fanatics.
