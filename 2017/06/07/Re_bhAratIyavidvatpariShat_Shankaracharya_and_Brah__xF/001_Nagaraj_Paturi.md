Dear Sri Ramchander Deekonda-ji,

  

I already mentioned what the forum stands for.

  

Whatever members have been doing----- snubbing, counter-arguing, debating or whatever it is, has been stopped by closing the thread.

  

That is how this forum runs.

  

I think that leaves no need or scope to protest. 

  

Regards,
