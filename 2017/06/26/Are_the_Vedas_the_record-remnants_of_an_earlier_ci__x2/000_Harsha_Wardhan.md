Respected scholars,

  

That the Vedas point to the highest Brahma is known, as the BhagavadGita affirms. The highest jnana.

  

But apart from that, the Vedas are also known to have informational auxiliaries on various other branches of knowledge. The lower jnana.

  

Is it possible that an earlier civilization attained great heights in all spheres of knowledge (including Brahma jnana), and they recorded their information in a scientifically rigorous language (Samskrit) for dissemination or preservation?

  

Could it be that the Vedas are the remnants of these records, and one of the reasons they are held in high regard is that this earlier civilization placed great emphasis on information?

  

I am entering into the realms of pure speculation here, but the idea that the Vedas might have had an intermediary non-divine stage strikes me as reasonable.

  

Am I erring in entertaining this possibility?

  

regards

Harsha
