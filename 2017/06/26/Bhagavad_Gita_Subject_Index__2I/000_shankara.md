Namo Vidyadbhah

  

I am looking for a subject index of the Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit, Hindi or English) preferably by an Indian author. Please note that I already have a word index of the Gita. I could not find any subject index in the Gita editions that I could access. I request your guidance in this matter.

shankara
