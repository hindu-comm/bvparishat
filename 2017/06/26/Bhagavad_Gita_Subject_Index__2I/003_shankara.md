Paturiji,

  

I am looking for an index covering all major topics of the Gita such as Isvara, Jiva, Jagat, Sthitaprajna, Karma, Yoga, Bhakti, Gunas, etc. which would be helpful for reference especially for those who are not familiar with the Gita.  

  

A subject index by Douglas P Hill is is available[here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=P6S0JqjeRLAC&pg=PA217&lpg=PA217&dq=bhagavad+gita+subject+index&source=bl&ots=2TAdK7HIfw&sig=pT7R50QoJqOjBO4eErgd_ajZPko&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhl97vjd7UAhUJvY8KHSdXAfcQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&q=bhagavad%20gita%20subject%20index&f=false).



Glad to know that you are preparing a list. if it is possible, please share it once it is finalized.  

  

regards  
shankara
