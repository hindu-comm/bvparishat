Parallel to this thread, there have been many threads running on text and scholarship and many other sspects. Those threads have been receiving wonderful contributions too. As such this or any such single thread does not characterize the nature or direction of the entire forum.

  

On issues of the kind discussed in this thread, Sanskrit scholars respected by us for their scholarship on texts etc., endorsed the misrepresentations of India in the books meant for children and youngsters due to their lack of proper perspective about their native culture.

  

It is hoped that this thread helps in widening the understanding of younger members and the senior scholars of the kind mentioned above.

  

With this, the thread is being closed.
