The [article](https://scroll.in/article/737715/fact-check-india-wasnt-the-first-place-sanskrit-was-recorded-it-was-syria)in scroll that I shared in the thread onOrigins of Vedic language, that makes fun of celebrating Sanskrit by Indians in the form of 16th World Sanskrit Conference includes the following sentence:

  

> 
> > Sanskrit is the liturgical language of Hinduism, so sacred that lower > castes (more than 75% of modern Hindus) werenâ€™t even allowed to listen > to it being recited.
> > 

  

I made the following points in one of the threads (<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/oSQalXcvA7I/Egv6gV2tNgAJ>) of BVP on 3rd May 2016:

  

> 
> > **1. Which people labelled as lower castes wanted to learn Sanskrit > and were denied the opportunity? When Sanskrit was spoken in major > part of the Indic subcontinent, people labelled as lower castes spoke > dialects of Sanskrit that are called Prakrits. Sanskrit was the > standard form spoken all over the Sanskrit-speaking areas in the same > form whereas the Prakritas spoken by the people labelled as lower > castes had regional variations. The situation is similar to a common > variety of Kannada being usedby the elite all over the places and the > non-elite Kannada having regional variations. Sanskrit plays reflect a > reality of the Prakrita speaking characters understanding the > Sanskrita spoken by the Sanskrita-speaking characters and vice-versa. > That was how the reality was in all the Sanskrit-speaking regions. > Then why at alldo the Prakrita-speaking people labelled as lower > castes need to 'learn' Sanskrit when they already understand it and > speak it in a different form of their own? Do the speakersof > non-elite dialects of Kannadaneed to learn the elite Kannada as a > course in a school? Don't they understand the elite form and respond > to in their own dialect?** >

In other parts of the Indic subcontinent (for example, in south > India ), where Sanskrit was not the spoken language, Sanskrit was > used only as a language used for studies, book-writing etc. People > labelled as lower castes did not need to communicate in that language > or to understand that language., because their way of life did > notneed the use of Sanskrit.** >
