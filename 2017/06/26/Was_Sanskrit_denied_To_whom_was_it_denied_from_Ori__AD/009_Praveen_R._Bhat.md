Namaste Nagaraj Mahodaya,

  

I could even say so:

-   \(a\) The scriptures deny access of Vedas to a particular varNa.  
-   \(b\) The scriptures were in Sanskrit. -   \(c\) The denial in (a) makes sense only if Sanskrit was known to
    the varNa, else Sanskrit is denied, Vedas automatically become
    denied. -   \(d\) Therefore, Sanskrit was known to the varNa and couldn't have
    been denied.

  

Kind rgds,
