1\) The so called elite, non-elite divisions are there in almost all languages and cultures. The point is, why should such divisions be canonized, and that too on the basis of lineage, by the secondary and/or tertiary scriptures such as in MS 3.156 and BSBh 1.3.38. In fact the former (MS 3.156 along with Medhatithi's commentary) not only prohibited Shudras (backward castes) from learning or hearing of Vedas, but also prohibited the teacher from teaching Sanskrit and related subjects to Shudras. It is also possible to find some other late "book" which expressly prohibited Shudras from uttering a Sanskrit word, though It is not clear to me as to what extent these injunctions were put into practice. For example, I have not heard or read that molten lead was really filled in the ears, or tongue was cut etc. Be that as it may, if such injunctions did exist in books then at least academically they beg the question - why were these injunctions formulated in first place and what purpose they served if they were not put in practice (assuming that they were not put in practice).

2\) Perhaps, we are missing a point here. The validity of birth based classification whereby certain class or castes have to perpetually do only certain type of work and as a corollary they need or need not learn Sanskrit is being questioned here at the basic level. The question is of canonizing (superimposing) something that may happen naturally. Canonization rules out (even) exceptions and thereby prevent the social or upward mobility. Seeking such a mobility is the natural right of all members of a civilized society in modern times. Such a mobility can be denied in the name of stability and individual karma but then we will be talking about two different world-views.

3\) This point possibly answer your question, at least partly:** **"Which people labeled as lower castes wanted to learn Sanskrit and were denied the opportunity?"... But more than the answer it again begs the question.. why scripturize something which may happen rightly (naturally) or wrongly (by force when it cannot be prevented)? A man and his kins may usurp the throne by force by violating the injunctions and declare him-self/them-selves as Kshatriyas. Giving social sanctions to such caste conversions only underlines the compulsions and inherent weakness of the system.

4\) That is true. However, this denial had symbolic importance.. the "feeling of denial" was about the denial of basic right to pursue the vocation or activity of individual choice. It was not really (or only) about learning Sanskrit. Presently, the backward castes - like almost all others - are more interested in upward mobility (both economic and social) in which learning Sanskrit is not a priority. This again strengthens my earlier point - irrelevance of scriptural injunctions pertaining to the four-fold classifications in the present times. What remains now is to remove their basis from our minds.
