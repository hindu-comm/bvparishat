Dear Sri Kalyan-ji,

  

Let us imagine that in a population which included speakers of a version of Latin in big numbers, a certain Holy Book in Latin was declared inaccessible. That does not mean speaking that version of Latin or Latin language in general was declared inaccessible to that population.

  

In a system where preserving, singing/performing oral texts in a certain language and using those oral texts for ritual mediation is also a hereditary right cum duty of a certain social group, the oral texts are inaccessible to all other speakers of the language in which the oral texts are, who (which speakers of that language ) do not have preserving, singing/performing oral texts in a certain language and using those oral texts for ritual mediation as their hereditary right cum duty. These speakers of that language are not denied the right to speak that language. They are denied the right to preserving, singing/performing oral texts in a certain language and using those oral texts for ritual mediation.

  

This is part of all occupations in that system being part of the right cum duty of a certain social group. In the Indian case, that social group was a caste. Elsewhere, it can be a tribe.
