Dear Sri Kalyan-ji,

  

It is the right cum duty of Oggu or OggolLu caste to perform the the oral texts of the caste -mythology of the Kuruma caste and to use those oral texts for ritual mediation in the rituals of the Kurumas inside and outside their households.

  

It is the right cum duty of Baindla caste to perform the the oral texts of the caste -mythology of the Madiga caste and to use those oral texts for ritual mediation in the rituals of the Madigas inside and outside their households.

  

It is the right cum duty of gauDa jeTTi caste to perform the the oral texts of the caste -mythology of the gauDa caste and to use those oral texts for ritual mediation in the rituals of the gauDas inside and outside their households.

  

I can give you scores of such examples from the Telugu speaking castes.

  

Similar such priestly performing castes playing similar role to certain specific castes is found in many other parts of India.
