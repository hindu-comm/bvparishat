Dear Sri Nagaraj  
  
  
  
//In a system where preserving, singing/performing oral texts in a certain language and using those oral texts for ritual mediation is also a hereditary right cum duty of a certain social group, the oral texts are inaccessible to all other speakers of the language in which the oral texts are, who (which speakers of that language ) do not have preserving, singing/performing oral texts in a certain language and using those oral texts for ritual mediation as their hereditary right cum duty. These speakers of that language are not denied the right to speak that language. They are denied the right to preserving, singing/performing oral texts in a certain language and using those oral texts for ritual mediation. //  
  
A few things don't fit into this scheme -  
  
1. Even though brahmins were preserves of tradition, knowledge of vedas was not denied to kshatriyas and vaishyas.  
  
2. Shudras were not denied access to traditional smriti texts.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
