Respected Scholars,

  

Two very important questions seem to have been put forth.

1\) What use is studying the Vedas or studying Sanskrit in general?

2\) Why studying a language as Sanskrit poses problems for the mass of people that only a few even today make it to the level that you all have reached?

  

The above two questions need to be answered by those who have studied the Vedas or Sanskrit.

  

With regards,
