Respected Shri Patturi-ji.  
  

I more or less agree with your own observations and the views expressed by David Buxbaum and Donald Davis. I however, don't believe that MS projected exclusively Brahminical vision for following reasons. (From my post of Science-Religion-Philosophy group, dated 9/11/2013):  

  

// smRRiti-s, particularly manu-smRRiti \[MS\] tried to create a model of ideal (moral) social structure. In this model, Brahmanas could not invest either in political power or any material wealth and had to depend on other classes (particularly administrative class and business classes - i.e. kShatriya-s and vaishya-s) - almost on their alms (daana). Brahmanas according MS and other smRRiti-s was paradoxically to be the most materially and politically constrained group. In return of austerities and poverty they were to be accorded spiritual stature and dignity; and other classes - particularly kShatriya-s were to protect them. This explains the disparity in penalties related to the classes. This is an hierarchical model through-and-through where arrows of spiritualism and materialism directed in opposite directions - so called spirituality defining the hierarchy on paper. I am not sure to what extent this model was successful and whether in its purest form it worked any time in history.  
  

Brahmanas (particularly priests) tried to wriggle out of this constrained situation by increasing the importance of yaGYa-yAga and carved out a stable living for themselves. YaGYa-yAga became a kind of status symbol - both for the king and the rich land-lords and merchants. Brahmana class added political counseling and fortune telling in their armory of traditional skills and tried to invest in political power as well. Brahmanism became a brand rather than a spiritual vocation and even some kings seem to have declared themselves as Bramnana to appropriate both spiritual and worldly power. (An alternative explanation as to why Shunga, Kanva, Shatavahana, Vakatakas etc were Brahmana kings is that the barrier between classes were quite fluid all through the history).  
  

I have not come across specific cases of Shudras being punished severally for minor offenses as prescribed in MS in the history books that I read - but this cannot be ruled out //  
  
Now to add to what I had said earlier..  
  
Sanskrit code-books like MS might had feeble and indirect influence on a very small portion of caste-codes as suggested by you. Yet there is no doubt that there was a group classified as untouchables which was a socially discriminated (segregated) group at least in Common Era. The evidence is available even in history books. In early Vedic civilization however, this four-fold class division wherein this group was heavily segregated is not seen - puruSha-sukta (RV 10.90) cannot be taken as its confirmation for various reasons - both philosophical and philological.
