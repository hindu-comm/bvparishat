Dear all,  

Did you know that as per the Census of India 2011, a mere 4.95% of India speaks English fluently and can understand the language as well as the august members of this group?  

By that logic, English is denied to a majority of the population and all the members on this group are denying it to the larger population as they write and speak in it every day, but don't "bother" to teach it to others.  

Does that make the members of this group downright evil, Selfish, arrogant people who seem to discuss issues that do not concern themselves with the common masses? I would think not.  
  
Every era has had such languages - when my grandfather was in school, it was Urdu. Sanskrit texts were translated into Urdu and can still be seen at the National Museum in Delhi. But yet it was the court language and "denied" to a majority of the population. Latin was taught in the highest temples of learning (including oxford) till a few decades back, but was "denied" to the larger masses.  
  
So wouldn't it be exciting to celebrate the glory of Sanskrit, what it offers, what possibilities it holds for the future?  
  
And now with sustainable development and climate change, it perhaps offers, in its vast voluminous tomes, the only alternative to a sustainable way of life - if there ever was one, it can be found here.
