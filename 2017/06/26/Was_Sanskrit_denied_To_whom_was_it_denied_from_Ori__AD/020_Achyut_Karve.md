Dear scholars,

We do not seem to be making use of Sanskrit in modern education. Sanskrit is one of the most compatible languages for human memory. If we can convert at least our secondary education material especially mathematics, science social studies into Sanskrit metre or sutras and employ them in education that part of knowledge will remain intact with the child for life.

If a child can learn a foreign language like English children in India can surely learn Sanskrit on condition that the shiksha path is properly oriented for the child so that he can read and write Sanskrit.  
With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
