Dear Sri Kalyan-ji,

  

\>In ancient days, knowledge of vedas gave upward mobility and such knowledge was denied to certain sections of the population.

  

  

------ Upward mobility is of several kinds, financial, political, social etc. Differentactivities/occupations/skills give upward mobility of different kinds in different societies in different periods of history. Apart from the skill of reciting Vedas, there are many otheractivities/occupations/skills that gave different kinds of upward mobility in ancient India. In a system whereall activities/occupations/skills are hereditary right cum duty reserved for the respective castes, everyactivity/occupation/skill that gave upward mobility to a certain caste can be viewed as denied to the castes that do not get that kind of a mobility.
