Respected Sri Gobind Medini-ji,

  

You identified the point that I mentioned in my response(s) to Sri Kalyan-ji. The point is that the social system where activities or occupations were part of right cum duty of a social group comes in the way of choice of a person from the hereditary occupation of his social group to that of the other. In the Indian case, this system is the caste system. 

  

Coming to canonization of such a system, Sanskrit books of code did not deal with the castes such as those I mentioned in my previous posts in this thread. But still the system of reserving different activities, skill or knowledge areas to different castes was followed strictly in numerous castes not covered in these books, across the length and breadth of India. Canonization in this case was maintained through oral texts or memory (smriti in the sense of memory). Caste panchayats executed this code.

  

Another point is, caste system (different from varNa system) was not created by Sanskrit code-books. Sanskrit code-books had feeble and a highly indirect influence on a very small portion of these caste-codes. Origin and perpetuation of caste-codes was independent of Sanskrit code-books. The Sanskrit code books if at all, were looked up for guidance by only a small section of Indian society. So much for the effect of their canonizations.

  

The following is from<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusmriti>

David Buxbaum states, "in the opinion of > the best contemporary orientalists, it \[Manusmriti\] does not, as a > whole, represent a set of rules ever actually administered in > Hindustan. It is in great part an ideal picture of that which, in the > view of a Brahmin, ought to be > law".^([\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusmriti#cite_note-74)) >
