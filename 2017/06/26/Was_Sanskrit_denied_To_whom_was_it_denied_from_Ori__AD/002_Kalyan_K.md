Dear Sri Nagaraj  
  
//Sanskrit is the liturgical language of Hinduism, so sacred that lower castes (more than 75% of modern Hindus) werenâ€™t even allowed to listen to it being recited.//  
  
I dont know if learning Sanskrit itself was denied to anyone, but study of vedas was denied to shudras. There are many references for this in scriptures. Shudras were not allowed to listen, hear or study vedas. Perhaps the reference to Sanskrit was actually a reference to vedas. As to what percentage of the population were regarded as Shudras, that is open to investigation.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
