hariH OM,

  

A better way to pose the questions may be:

1\. "Now that vedas have been available for at least about 100 years to general public (Aryasamaajis were veda universalizers, Rama Krishna Mission has been teaching veda in many of its schools without consideration of caste), how many from the non dvija castes actually became ghanapaaThis in any single veda?"

Ans: None as far as I know. I don't even know of the rare exceptions.

  

2. Will someone please tell what dRRiShTa phala viz. getting more money, getting professional status etc. are gained in this day and age by learning veda? Purohitas are finding it difficult to get brides because the "profession" is looked down upon even by brAhmaNas themselves (thus they never give their daughters to purohitas). Their children don't get reservations even if their parents are struggling to make ends meet etc.  

  

What is the purpose of doing this *kaakadanta pariikShaNa* by websites such as [scroll.in](http://scroll.in) and its ideological compatriots? One simple answer is that it is driven towards throwing muck on brAhmaNas and the vedic tradition. That is all.

  

People gush with enthusiasm when Vedas are given the status of intangible heritage by UNESCO etc. But somehow the custodians of that tradition are the greatest villains.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                             shrivathsa.
