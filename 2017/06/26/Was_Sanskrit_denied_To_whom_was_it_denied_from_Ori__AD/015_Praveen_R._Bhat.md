The purpose of studying the Vedas as per the orthodox tradition is either since it is a

चित्तशुध्यर्थं



कर्तव्यं कर्म or मोक्षार्थम्।

 The Sanskrit language, as a means of communication would have been a necessity when and where it was a language of communication, but otherwise व्याकरणसहित Sanskrit was only for the purpose of

stud

y of 

शास्त्र

s since व्यकरणं वेदस्य मुखं प्रोक्तम्।



Unfortunately, masses do not ask these valid questions. Although it is said प्रयोनमनुदिश्य मन्दोऽपि न प्रवर्तते, yet in such cases, the question as to what my purpose or goal should be, is almost never asked. The thinking is thus: if I've been denied or some one even infers that I may not be eligible, I want to do it just to question/ oppose/ dismiss that. Even if the path to मोक्ष is made easier for someone without elaborate study and practice, one isn't interested.

  

I haven't known even one among such who asks why such a व्यवस्था and what do I gain from it. I don't need to do it just because the other does. The other way around of greed leading ब्राह्मण, etc to अब्राह्मणकर्म, etc, may also be true, but most of it was to earn a livelihood in recent times, at least. In that, the tradition-defined goal of life is lost on many.

  

धन्योऽस्मि।

प्रवीणभट्टः।
