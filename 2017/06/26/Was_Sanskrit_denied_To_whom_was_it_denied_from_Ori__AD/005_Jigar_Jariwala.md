Dear scholars,  
  
In ancient times (vedic and puranic) Sanskrit was the major language  
for education purposes. If we talk about "lower classes" (so called  
lower classes), let me tell you that smithy (blacksmith, copper-smith,  
etc.) books were written and taught in Sanskrit (in gurukuls).  
  
The book related to chemistry, architecture, construction, all were in  
Sanskrit (ad taught in that sole language)  
  
But with the arrival of British they wanted to destroy our far better  
ancient technology, they created a social divide and started  
destroying the skills of these people in masses, they labelled these  
classes as "lower classes" and edited the social norms so that these  
talent could be destroyed..........  
  
Best example is the periyar caste of south India....  
Periyar architects built the most magnificent, and beautiful  
architecture (palaces and temples). The British laid a direct ban on  
them through enforcement of Law....  
  
  
  
And such destruction in other parts of India went on....

\>\> Sanskrit that are called Prakrits. Sanskrit was the standard form spoken

\>\> understanding the Sanskrita spoken by the Sanskrita-speaking characters  
\>\> and  
\>\> vice-versa. That was how the reality was in all the Sanskrit-speaking  
\>\> regions. Then why at all do the Prakrita-speaking people labelled as  
\>\> lower  
\>\> castes need to 'learn' Sanskrit when they already understand it and speak  
\>\> it in a different form of their own? Do the speakers of non-elite  
\>\> dialects  
\>\> of Kannada need to learn the elite Kannada as a course in a school?  
\>\> Don't  

\>\> they understand the elite form and respond to in their own dialect?\*  
\>\>  
\>\> \*2. In other parts of the Indic subcontinent (for example, in south India  

\>\> ), where Sanskrit was not the spoken language, Sanskrit was used only as  
\>\> a  
\>\> language used for studies, book-writing etc. People labelled as lower  
\>\> castes did not need to communicate in that language or to understand that  

\>\> language., because their way of life did not need the use of Sanskrit.\*  
\>\>  
\>\> \*3. One may argue that the non-Brahmin authors of Sanskrit, are all  

\>\> kings,  
\>\> hence kshatriyas not people labelled as lower castes . But that is not  
\>\> true. In India, kshatiyas find mention only in books. In the actual  
\>\> reality  
\>\> and actual history, kings were mostly people labelled as lower castes  
\>\> that  
\>\> were accorded Kshatriya status after becoming kings. For example, the  
\>\> Reddy  
\>\> kings or Rayala dynasty kings of Vijayanagara were all 'people labelled  
\>\> as  

\>\> lower castes' only.\*  
\>\>  
\>\> \*4\*\* People labelled as lower castes feeling denial of opportunity to  

\>\> learn Sanskrit began only during therecent period of history. But this  
\>\> situation lasted only for a short while. Modern education very soon  
\>\> provided opportunities for all people irrespective of their caste or  

\>\> religion to learn\*
