Dear Patuariji,

The perspective which you have presented is valid. However we need to differentiate between dialects spoken by communities of different castes and those spoken by different tribal communities. The reason is that these tribal communities have remained on the fringes during the feudal era and were not integrated into mainstream social evolution. If the evolution or origin of vedic literature was during the period when social organisation had not reached feudal frameworks it would be safe to say that the vedic language evolved from more ancient tribal languages. These tribal languages though only spoken have an inherent ability of remaining stable over generations. I have observed that the phonetic effort exercised by individuals in tribal communities remains unaltered even when they are distributed over a large geographical area as also the transfer of phonological, morphological as well as phonetic characteristics over generations remains unaltered. I therefore feel that a thorough investigation of the languages of these communities is necessary however unevolved they are.

This investigation I feel will supply the necessary foundation for reconstructing the process of evolution of the vedic language.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
