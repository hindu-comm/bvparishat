Friends,  
  

We seem to be obsessed with questions which are better addressed elsewhere.  

As I had observed earlier, the forum is getting into social issues than discussing  

text and scholarship. Social issues have religion is them and one might have opinions.  

It would help if we redirect ourselves to search the science of language and the  

analysis of the texts.  
  

I urge all curious people to read Kane's treatise on Dharmashastra (particularly vol II)  

to get an analysis of the social condition during the Vedic period.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
