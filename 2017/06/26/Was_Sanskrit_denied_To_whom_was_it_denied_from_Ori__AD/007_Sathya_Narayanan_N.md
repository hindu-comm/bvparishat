As Nagaraj ji said,  
  
This is quite prevalent in Tamilnadu. Even in our ancestors place, we have such temples taken care by certain community.  
  
People from all communities go and worship the deity. Do age old rituals. But the performing rituals and rights are theirs.  
But ppl can know the mythology or tradition behind it.  
  
  
regards,  
sathya
