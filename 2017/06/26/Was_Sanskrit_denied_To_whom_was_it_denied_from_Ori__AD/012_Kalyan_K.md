//A better way to pose the questions may be:  

1\. "Now that vedas have been available for at least about 100 years to general public (Aryasamaajis were veda universalizers, Rama Krishna Mission has been teaching veda in many of its schools without consideration of caste), how many from the non dvija castes actually became ghanapaaThis in any single veda?"  

Ans: None as far as I know. I don't even know of the rare exceptions.//  
  
  
This is because in the modern day, knowledge of English and sciences leads to better job prospects rather than vedic knowledge.  
  
  
//2. Will someone please tell what dRRiShTa phala viz. getting more money, getting professional status etc. are gained in this day and age by learning veda//  
  
  
Not much material wealth can be gained by vedic knowledge, but this is a modern day phenomenon. In ancient days, knowledge of vedas gave upward mobility and such knowledge was denied to certain sections of the population.
