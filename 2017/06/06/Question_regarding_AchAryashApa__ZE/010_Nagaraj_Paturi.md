Corrected version of my previous message:

  

Books like anāchāranirṇaya being composed in a certain region is not a proof enough to say that a certain region has rampant deviations from the norm.

  

BTW, does this book mention a śāpa ? Does that book mention the anāchāra-s it lists as caused by that śāpa ?
