Many cross-regional mutual perceptions of anaachaara, particularly among Brahmins come to mind:

  

In some regions, performing certain sacred rituals with the cleanly washed *wet* clothes is considered to be aachaara. The same is considered to be anaachaara by the Brahmins of the region where performing those sacred rituals with the cleanly washed *dry*clothes is considered to be aachaara . Vice versa is also true.

  

Using wet rice for apara karma-s is considered to be aachaara in a certain region. Using wet rice in s'ubha karma-s is considered to be anaachaara in the same region because it is perceived to belong to apara karma-s. But in some other regions using wet rice in s'ubha karma-s may not be considered anaachaara.
