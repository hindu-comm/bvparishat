Dear Paturiji,

  

  This is very interesting. The same story of Paraśurāma's curse is found in the Sahyādrikhaṇḍa, where the curse is directed at the Citpāvan (Chitpavan) Brahmins. After cursing the Citpāvan Brahmins, Paraśurāma, in this story, brings the Sārasvata Brahmins from the north and settles them in Konkan and Goa. I have written about this story previously. 
Looks like the same story of Paraśurāma's curse gets extended in Kerala to local brahmins. I wonder if there is a Sanskrit narrative source for this story from Kerala. I remember the name of a work called Keralotpatti, but I have not seen it.
