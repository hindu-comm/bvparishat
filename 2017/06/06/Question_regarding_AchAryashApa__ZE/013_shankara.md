Deshpandeji,

  

Parasurama's curse on Kerala brahmins is described in a Sanskrit text named 'Keralamahatmyam', chapter 99. Attaching Devanagari text of this chapter with this mail. This text is extracted from a recent edition of this book in Malayalam script.  

  

Keralamahatmya is said to be a modern work, but its author or exact period is not known. It is in the form of a dialogue between Yudhisthira and Garga Muni, during the forest life of the Pandavas.

  

As Niveditaji observed, the Anacharas are listed in the 4th pada of 12th chapter of Laghudharmaprakasika also known as Saankarasmriti. Attaching pdf of laghudharmaprakasika. This smriti is ascribed to Sankaracharya.  



regards  
shankara

Dear Paturiji,

  

  This is very interesting. The same story of Paraśurāma's curse is found in the Sahyādrikhaṇḍa, where the curse is directed at the Citpāvan (Chitpavan) Brahmins. After cursing the Citpāvan Brahmins, Paraśurāma, in this story, brings the Sārasvata Brahmins from the north and settles them in Konkan and Goa. I have written about this story previously. 
Looks like the same story of Paraśurāma's curse gets extended in Kerala to local brahmins. I wonder if there is a Sanskrit narrative source for this story from Kerala. I remember the name of a work called Keralotpatti, but I have not seen it.
