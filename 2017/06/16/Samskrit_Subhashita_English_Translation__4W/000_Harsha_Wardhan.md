Respected scholars,

  

I am looking for English translations of the numerous Subhashita (good sayings, proverbs, etc) that are present in Samskrit language.

  

I have seen some samskrit only compendiums, but I am looking for samskrit original +english translation compendiums, if such a thing is there.

  

Could you share any resources that you may have or guide me as proper?

  

Dhanyavaadah
