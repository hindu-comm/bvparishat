Shri Harsha Vardhana-ji,  

  
Three independent texts are available for sA.nkhya:  
  

\(a\) IshvarakRRiShNa kRRit sA.nkhya-kArikA, (b) tattva-samAsa, and (c) sA.nkhya-sUtra  
  

The first one is the most important treatise and have following six commentaries: 1) mAThara vRRitti, 2) yukti-dIpikA, 3) gauDapAda-bhAShya, 4) jayama.ngala, 5) Vachaspati's sA.nkhya-tattva-kaumudI, and 6) sA.nkhya-chandrikA.  
  
The second one (tattva-samAsa) also have six commentaries by unknown commentators. In any case tattva-samAsa is quite brief.  
  
The third text (sA.nkhya-sUtra) have following commentaries: The most important commentary on the text is viGYAnabhixu's ** sA.nkhya-pravachana-bhAShya (16thC). Other important commentaries on this text include Anirruddha’s kApila-sA.nkhya-pravachana-vRRitti (15thC), Mahadeva’s vRRitti-sAra (c.1600) and Nagesha’s laghu-sA.nkhya-sUtra-vRRitti.  
  

Translation of vAchaspati's tattva-kaumudi by Gabganath Jha can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/anenglishtransla00vaacuoft). However, I would suggest a contemporary reading of kArikA in sA.nkhya-tattva-manorama by Dinanath Pandey. This is an independent interpretation directly based on kArikA but by taking into account (and mostly rejecting) other commentators. You can find it on [archive.org](http://archive.org)  

  

On pAta.njala yoga sUtra-s there are commentaries by vyAsa, vAchaspati, viGYAna-bhixu, and Bhoja. You can find translation of the sUtra-s with vyAsa commentary and notes of others (vAchaspati, bhixu, bhoja) by Dr Ganganath Jha [here](https://archive.org/stream/yogadaranasutra00patagoog#page/n0/mode/2up).  
  

regards,
