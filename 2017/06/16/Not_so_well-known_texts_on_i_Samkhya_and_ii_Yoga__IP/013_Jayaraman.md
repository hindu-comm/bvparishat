Namaste  
  
I attach two images that are screen shots from shodhganga website  
  
<http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/90282/7/07_chapter%202.pdf>  
  
which provides a very good list of printed and yet to be printed works on Yogasutra commentaries. I understand that your query is about the English translations of these texts. I hope this list might help refine your search for translations of these texts.  
  
best wishes.
