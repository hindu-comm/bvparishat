Dear Sri Venkata Sriram ji,

  

Thank you for your kind input. The book seems to be in Hindi, a language I know fully, but have lost touch with for some years. I will read it though.

  

Regarding sambhavi mudra, it is my opinion that when it comes to yoga, we should keep aside considerations of jati, varna etc because they have outlived their utility. I think mudras and practices are applicable to all. However, which practice one takes up depends upon his/her level of strength and inclination.

  

You may find much material of interest in Swami Lakshman Joo's writings (mudras and a host of other practices).

  

with regards

Harsha
