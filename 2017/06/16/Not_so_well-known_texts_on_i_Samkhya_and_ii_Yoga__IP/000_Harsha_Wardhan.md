Respected scholars,

  

In your researches, have you come across, or have you come to know of any not-so-well-known texts (vrittis, bhashyas, etc) on **(i) Samkhya**, and **(ii) Yoga**?

  

I think Samkhya suffers from obscurity, as except for the yuktidipika we do not have any hitherto unknown independent works

  

And in my opinion Yoga has a dearth of works written by traditional yogis; except for Vijnanabhikshu (who's been translated by TS Rukmani) I do not know of any other practical yogi who has written anything in the nature of a commentary on yogic practices

  

****I am primarily looking for english translations of such texts as my samskrit knowledge is only perfunctory****  

  

Kindly guide me in this regard
