Namaste,

  

A beautiful book called 'योगमार्गप्रकाशिका' by Mahant Yugal Das ji.

.........

  

Also, I vaguely remember somewhere reading (i think 'yog ank' - Gita Press) by Brahmaleen Udiya Babaji that in Kali Yuga, the mudra called 'शांभवी मुद्रा' is the best which is prescribed for all - irrespective of varNa & kula. I need to refer that again.

  

rgs,

sriram
