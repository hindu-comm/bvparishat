Respected Harshavardhan Ji,

  
  
"**Is there a way to contact Dr Umesh, for I have not seen his book *Science of Mind Control* to be available for purchase on the math's website or on any other website."  
**  

A close well wisher of me is a visitor of Umesh Ji. His observations are below:  
"It is impossible to contact Umesh Ji. He only sees persons whom he wants to see."  
  
Myself tried several times through the well wisher at IITM. He meets Umesh ji. He has also categorically rejected the chance to meet Umesh Ji.  
Umesh ji moves in Chennai normally like any person. But we cant spot him.  
Many have tried different methods to meet him. It ended being unsuccessful. The person known to me, meeting Umesh ji was also very accidental and destiny.  
  
Umesh ji stays in mylapore with his mother. Now he will be around 60+.
