Namaste Harsha Wardhanji,

  

I'm mentioning this only since it doesn't appear on your list on yoga, although you may be already aware of Adi Shankaracharya's vivaraNa on vyasabhAShya on yogasUtras. There is an English translation by Trevor Legget and another by TS Rukmani, now easily available.

  

Kind rgds,
