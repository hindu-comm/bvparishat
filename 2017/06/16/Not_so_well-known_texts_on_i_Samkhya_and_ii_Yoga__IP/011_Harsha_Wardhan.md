Dear Sathya Narayanan ji,

  

Thank you for your kind response. In this thread, a yahoo mail account's login credentials have been shared by a respected scholar which contains scanned copies of the said book. The mail ID also contains a couple of other books of related interest. You may please peruse.

  

The information about Sri Umesh is rather interesting. It seems the gentleman has taken to the yogic path in totality. It would not behoove us to disturb his solitary lifestyle. May he continue his sadhana in peace.

  

with regards

Harsha
