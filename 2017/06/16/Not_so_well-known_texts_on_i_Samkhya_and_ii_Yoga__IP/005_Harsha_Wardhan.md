Dear Sir,

  

Thank you for the book *Yoga, Enlightenment and Perfection*. I have read it fully, and find in it signs of a honest account of real yogic sadhana.

  

Is there a way to contact Dr Umesh, for I have not seen his book *Science of Mind Control* to be available for purchase on the math's website or on any other website.

  

Let me again convey my appreciation to you for taking the time to respond to my request.

  

regards

Harsha
