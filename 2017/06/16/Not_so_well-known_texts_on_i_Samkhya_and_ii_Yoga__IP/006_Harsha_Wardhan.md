Sri Gobind ji,

  

Thank you for your kind response

  

I posted this query ****after**** having gone through:

  

****(a) Samkhya:****

  

isvarakrishna's samkhyakarika with vachaspatimisra's tattvakaumudi and the bhashya of gaudapada

  

yuktidipika on the karika

  

kapila sutras (samkhya) with aniruddha and vijnanabhikshu's commentaries

  

tattvasamasa, with F max muller's free rendering of it in his six systems, J R Ballantyne's trans. of the kramadipika, and narendra's commentary as well

  

also I went through Sri Ram Shankar Bhattacya and Gerald F Larson's encyclopedia of indian philosophies vol IV on samkhya which has short summaries of the principal works (most of the later commentaries are mere repetitions, due to a paucity of actual works to comment upon)

  

***My request was more in the nature of a query to find out if any further works have come to light in the course of any research work***

  

For ex, wouldn't it be great if miraculously the sastitantra came to light !!

  

****(b) Yoga sutras:****

  

I have commentaries by Vyasa, vacaspatimisra, sankara, vijnanabhikshu, hariharananda aranya, bhoja and western works such as that of j h woods and latest by e f bryant

  

for hatha yoga, i have the jyotsna critical edition on the hathapradipika along with the HP 10 chapter version, the gherandasamhita, the siva samhita, the yuktabhavadeva, the dattatreyasastra, the vasisthasamhita, the hathatattvakaumudi and other works whose names i cannot recall right now  

  

***I was trying to see if new works have come to light, such as that of the many attributed to gorakshanatha or matsyendranatha***

  

for ex, the hatha yoga project in SOAS is doing a massive translation of some ancient texts

  

thank you for your kind list of works though, I'll try to procure any that I don't have

  

with regards

  

Harsha
