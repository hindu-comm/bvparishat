Sri Achut-ji,

  

There are two views about this :

  

1\. The language is found in the Vedas revealed to the Brahmarshis at the beginning of the creation. Thus is not thetongue of any particular group Viz. Ethnic, geographical or of any particular race.

  

2. The modern researches, being discussed in the other thread that seem to have triggered your question treat it as a tongue of a particular group Viz. Ethnic, geographical or of a particular race.

  

When we are in discussion with the #2 category, we have to , at least for the sake of the argument , treat it as they treat and discuss.
