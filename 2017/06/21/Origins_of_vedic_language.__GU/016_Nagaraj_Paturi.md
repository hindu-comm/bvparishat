Once on another list, the following link to an article was shared:

  

<https://scroll.in/article/737715/fact-check-india-wasnt-the-first-place-sanskrit-was-recorded-it-was-Syria>  

  

I included the following sentences in my response:

Indians have been attached to the Vedas and Sanskrit for millennia and have been nurturing and nourishing it for millennia. No other place did that.

  

What fun do these people get in celebrating their 'discoveries' saying that 'the origin of what you have been nurturing and nourishing with mamatva in your place is outside your place'?  

  

It is not required to make claims such as

  

'all IE languages originated from India or all IE people are descendants of Indians'

  

to claim that the Vedas and Sanskrit are ours.

  



It is not even requiredto argue against the claims

  

that the Vedas and Sanskrit have their origin outside India

  

to claim that the Vedas and Sanskrit are ours.

  

'Vedas and Sanskrit have been with us and with us alone for millennia and not with the places or people claimed to be their origins'-is enough

  

to claim that the Vedas and Sanskrit are ours.

  

Knowledge of migrations of numerous different peoples and languages far and wide across the globe long long long ago, which is not a news , does not and need not affect the attachments of people to the languages they have been speaking, cultures they have been living and places in which they have been living for very long periods.
