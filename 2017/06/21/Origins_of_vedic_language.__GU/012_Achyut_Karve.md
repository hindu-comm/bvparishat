My view is that more than the words and their meanings the basket of letters spoken or recited during that period is reflected in the compositions of the Vedas. In fact these letters should be addressed to be the genetic material in the enquiry of the origin of the Vedas. The fact that the Maheshwar Sutras do not include ळ itself shows that the centre of vedic culture in those days had moved north of the vindhyas.
