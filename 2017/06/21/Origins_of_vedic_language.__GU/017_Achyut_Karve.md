Dear Scholars,

There is more to it. How do people preserve protect a treasure trove of their fore father's. By building museums in their memory. Yes they can be protected in buildings because they are non living they are artifacts. We have been entrusted with protecting a language which obviously cannot be protected in a museum as it is living. We have taken charge of protecting it because it is ours. Nay it is we alone who can protect it because all the conditions for its protection are only available in our land as it was born and brought up here.

Language is not a thing which can be either imported or exported. It is the life breath of nature and hence its permanance over a geographical area. It is high time that linguists give up ranting such ideas as Arctic home of the vedas. Those Indians who subscribe to this view are those unfortunate ones who have not been in a position to appreciate their own mother tongues leave they understanding a tongue as refined as Sanskrit. May God protect them.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
