Dear Acyut Karve ji,  
  
In Tamilnadu the story is Sanskrit and Tamil came from Shiva's damaru.  
Many poets from earliest times mentioned in tamil literature have said Agastya gave tamil and have recorded the same thought in different way.  
Agastya was send by Shiva with tamil. Agastya disciple wrote the pannini equivalent grammar for Tamil.  
  
In a way, Tamil came from the divine being. Not composed at the beginning.  
  
regards,  
sathya
