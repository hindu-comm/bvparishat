Dear Patuariji,

You have made a valid statement. Thus the origin of Vedic Sanskrit must have happened in one of the two ways. We therefore need to grant credibility to both these views.

Should we carry on this thread as an exercise and look at the pros and cons of the arguments in terms of the Sanskrit language.

Q.No 1. Do we know of any other language which is not considered to be the tongue of a community and yet is a fully evolved literary language?

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
