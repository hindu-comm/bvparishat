Respected Subramanyan Ji,  
  
That sight belongs to Prof G Sankara Narayana of SCSVMV university. He is a scholar in Tamil and Sanskrit language.  
I dont know him personally. But follow him in Facebook.  
He has a huge following in Fb on areas like History/Language/Archaeology/Shilpa Sastra in Facebook.  
I think, He is in this BVP.
