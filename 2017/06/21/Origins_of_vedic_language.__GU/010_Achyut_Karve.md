Dear Satyanarayananji,

  

I am of the opinion that Sanskrit as also the other modern formal Indian languages are an outgrowth of the very many dialects as well as tribal languages spoken in those geographical areas. Thus this small questionaire.

  

How many dialects does Tamil have or How many Tribal communities live in Tamilnadu? Can their languages be distinguished from Tamil in any particular way? Do these Tribal languages seem to predate Tamil or other way round? In other words have these tribal languages through the course of evolution taken on a distinct lingual form as Tamil or the other way round? Can an uneducated Tribal speaker easily speak Tamil as also can a Tamil speaking individual easily speak the tribal tongue? 

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
