Hi!

  

The first scholar, to my knowledge, to draw attention to the absence of nose ring in ancient Indian culture was N. B. Divatia, in his Wilson Philological Lectures published in 1921. (N. B. Divatia. 1921. *Gujarati Language and Literature*. 2 vols. Bombay: McMillan and Co. for the University of Bombay at vol. 1. p. 398; see the attachment)

  

Best,

  

Hemant
