Thanks, Sri Venkata Sriram. A similar question arises in connection with Saundaryalahari 61 which starts 'asau nāsāvaṃśas tuhinagirivaṃśa dhvajapaṭi'. This verse is traditionally understood to describe the beauty of the pearl in the nose ring of the divine Mother. The Saundaryalahari is traditionally ascribed to Sri Adi Sankara.
