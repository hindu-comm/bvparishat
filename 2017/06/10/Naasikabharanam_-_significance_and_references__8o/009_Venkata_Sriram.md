Dear Ramachandra Ji,

  

परशुरामकल्प सूत्रं is considered to be the authoritative manual for srividya tantra in general and navAvaraNa archana in particular. There is a prakriya calledचतुष्षष्टिपूजा which involves 64 upachArAs.
Shri.Parashurama has compiled some of the important divine ornaments that needs to be offered to Devi during the puja which are supposed to give saubhAgya to the upAsaka. Pls go the 160th page of the link given below (vide ref: मणिकुण्डलयुगळं **नासाभरणं** अधरयावकं....)

...........

  

Also, among the samskArAs, we have nAsAvEdha-samskAra which is done with mantra paThana. When we have ample instances in Lalita Sahasranama (which is from Brahmanda Purana) and Kalpa Sutra (compiled by Parashurama), what is the point in discussing whether it isअर्वाचीन or not.

  

regs,

sriram
