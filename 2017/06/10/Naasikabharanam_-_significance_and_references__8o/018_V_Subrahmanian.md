There is a reference in the Soundarya Lahari, of which there is a Tamil translation of 11 CE. Someone may study theLalita Sahasranama bhashya of Bhaskararaya and the Soundarya lahari bhashya too to see if they give any references.

  

There is a reference to this practice in Karnataka among women of the Yogis of the Matsyendranatha/Gorakhnath sampradaya which dates back to 11 CE:
