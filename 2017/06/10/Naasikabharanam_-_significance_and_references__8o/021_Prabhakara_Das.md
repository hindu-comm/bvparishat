One more was missing . The legend of Kanyakumari Devi. Please go through.

Copy pasting

The Devi stands as a charming young girl in her penance with a rosary in her right hand, and a sparkling nose jewel that sheds lustrous radiance. It is believed that the nose ring of Devi Kanyakumari set with rubies are so bright and that could be seen from far at night. Also it is told that some ships sailing in the sea, mistaking the brilliance of the rubies for the light from the Lighthouse , went off shore got wrecked, hitting against the rocks nearby. In this point of view eastern side gate of the temple is kept closed. The idol made of blue stone, is believed to have installed by sage Parshurama
