References to nose ornament were offered by Prof. Wakankar ji and others. Its significance has been mentioned by Sri Venkata Sriram and Prof. Iyengar, from a Yogic point of view and Prof. Venkatesh Murthy mentioned about an Ayurvedic point of view.  
  

One more point from Ayurveda perspective could be as follows.  
  
Rasashastra (Indian alchemy) mentions purification of metals for therapeutic purpose. This is known as 'deha-vedha.' This is to make 'bhasma' kind of medicines. Also, wearing gold/golden ornaments on body would bring some health benefits.  
  
Piercing nose can be compared to piercing ears (karNa-vedha), which is a saMskAra.  
  
When earlobes are pierced and a foreign body, - a golden string, is studded over there, body tries to assimilate the golden metallic nano-scale particles in the blood. Since our body is pA\~nca-bhautika, it requires some metal content. External supply of such metallic particles by wearing gold or silver, would rejuvenate the doshic (humoral) imbalance and neuro-system as well. I heard this from some elders, but yet to get any reference from samhita texts.
