Namaste

  

The very ancient Bhavani Sahasra Nama is from the ancient work Rudrayamala Tantra. In this Bhavani Sahasra Nama there is no**नासाभरण
word or any other word for Nose ornament. It may meanनासाभरण was added in Lalita Sahasranama in 16th century or later. The Puranas have many interpolations, additions and deletions. This is not surprising.**
