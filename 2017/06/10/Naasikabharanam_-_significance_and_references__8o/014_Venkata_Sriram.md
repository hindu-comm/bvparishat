Namaste,

  

I wonder how come all those research scholars have deliberately ignored the following name fromललिता सहस्रनामं

  

**ताराकान्तितिरस्कारिनासाभरणभासुरा**  

  

The chief deity ofललिता सहस्रनामं is Tripurasundari in general and Kamakshi in particular. The vAk devata-s have composed this at the command of Lalita and eventually handed down in tradition. Later, Hayagriva initiated this to Agastya in Kamakoti Sthana. 

  

Granted that 'nose-ring' was handed down to us by Mugals in 16th century, then how come, this is found inललिता सहस्रनामं. As this sahasranama is dedicated to Kamakshi of Kamakoti Pitha, She must be sporting with this ornament and the deity (the vigraha) is supposed to be the ancient one. 

  

What surprises me is that all those scholars (Prof.Gode, Prof.Jitendra Nath Banerjee, Dr.Gopinath etc.) who wrote papers on ancient indian jewellery, didn't mention this.

  

So, it is possible that :

  

1\) Either Lalita Sahasranama could be of recent origin (post-11th century)

2\) The scholars have overlooked this ornament to capture

3\) Probably, this ornament was not of much importance in early South Indian culture

  

regs,

sriram
