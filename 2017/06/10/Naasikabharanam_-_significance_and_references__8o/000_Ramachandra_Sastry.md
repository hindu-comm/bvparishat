Namaste,

  

Can i kindly request scholars to help me with the significance and references for Naasikabharanam in sastras/puranas which few traditional indian woman wear.

  

I am aware of reference found in Lalithasahasranamam, however would like to know any other references from sastras/puranas.

  

Heard there is a reference available in Ayurveda sastra as well, can some one please help with that as well.
