Namaste

  

I am afraid the Nose Ring was brought to India by Islamic influence by Mughal Emperors. Kindly see this -

  

'In the 16th century, nose piercing was bought to India from the Middle East by the Mughal emperors. In India, a stud (called a "Phul") or a ring (i.e. "Nath") is usually worn in the left nostril, although both nostrils are pierced in some areas.The reason the left nostril is more commonly pierced is due to that spot being associated with female reproductive organs in Ayurveda (i.e. Indian medicine); the piercing is supposed to make childbirth easier and lessen period pain. An Indian woman's nose piercing is sometimes joined to her ear by a chain.'
