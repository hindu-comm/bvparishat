Dear Sirs,  
  
I came across following approaches, methods, and criteria while studying Vedanta texts:  
  

1\) अनुबंधचतुष्टय (four-fold relation between the student and the text)  

2\) षड्विधलिङ्ग तात्पर्य (conclusion of the textual analysis by six-fold criteria)  

3\) षड्विधप्रमाण प्रामाण्य (acquiring-validating knowledge using the six-means)  

4\) प्रामाण्यदृष्टी चतुष्टय (four views of acquiring and validating knowledge)  

5\) ख्याति पञ्चक (five theories of perceptual errors) (can be included in 3)  
6) अंतरंग-बाह्यरंग परिक्षण (investing the internals and the externals of a text)

  

I do not see anything that gives extra-weight to faith or tradition explicitly in the above criteria and methods except following two factors:  
  

\(a\) Vedanta tradition seems to acknowledge two extra means of knowledge called aitihya (ऐतिह्य) and saMbhava (संभव) within six means mentioned in (3) above. (Cf. Laghu Vasudeva Mananam - both Sanskrit and Marathi versions). The saMbhava, to my knowledge, is related to measurement (मापन) so let us leave at that. However, "aitihya" is said to be related to anything whose source is not known. In such cases Vedanta takes the tradition as pramANa in the name of aitihya. Most of the times aitihya is included in shabda (Agama).  
  
IMO, "aitihya" might had been established by mImAMsA to validate "apauruSheyatvatva (अपौरुषेयत्व)" of Vedas by supporting the shabara-bhAShya of jaiminIya sUtra. However, in practice, it is applied to many other issues and defines the traditional approach towards prAmANya. For example, "philological and historical investigation" (बाह्यरंग-परिक्षण) of Vedas is generally avoided by traditional Vedantins or mImAMsaka-s. Another example is the paradox - if aupaniShad verses are reflected in Bhagavadgita and if Bhagavadgita is open to all for moxa, then why Upanishads themselves are not open to all for moxa. This is explained on the basis of aitihya which accepts authority of smRRiti-s as part of tradition which restricts the access of Vedas and upaniShads by way of injunctions. The emphasis-deemphasis on a particular pramANa or li.nga (or combination thereof) is also decided by the tradition. For example, vedAnta treats karma-kANDa as secondary while for mImAMsaka-s brahmavAda is secondary. MImaMsA treats upaniShad-s merely as arthavAda of Vedic karma. For mImAMsaka-s, Vedas are vidhyAtmaka (of the nature of injunctions).  
  

\(b\) प्रामाण्यदृष्टी चतुष्टय classifies the Astika-Nastika schools in four epistemic categories viz. (b1) मीमांसा (validity of knowledge intrinsic, invalidity of knowledge extrinsic), (b2) सांख्य (validity and invalidity of knowledge are intrinsic), (b3) न्याय (validity and invalidity of knowledge are extrinsic), and (b4) बौद्ध (validity of knowledge extrinsic, invalidity of knowledge intrinsic).  
  
Vedanta is generally supposed to follow mImAMsA epistemology though both mImAMsA and vedAnta follow their own respective khyAti-vAda (theory of perceptual error). Vivarta vAda and anirvachanIya khyAti allows vedAnta to adopt any of the four views but tradition followed "vyavahAre bhATTanayaH".  
  
The svataH-prAmAnya (intrinsic validity) of texts coupled with aitihya allows traditional Vedantins to select their texts - Vedas, upaniShad-s, shA.nkara bhAShya, and pramANa-grantha-s; and holding their tradition as supreme. (Of course others can do the same and hence it is essentially "your word vs. my word"). All theorists of "intrinsic validity, extrinsic invalidity" can claim that there are no contradictions or inadequacies in their texts, it is only the individual reader who interprets them wrongly for various reasons extraneous to the text. Only the tradition (i.e. saMpradAyavit or gurus of the tradition) knows the correct interpretation. To establish the supremacy of the tradition, other traditions need to be refuted. BrahmasUtra (vedAnta-sUtra) must refute other schools to establish the supremacy of vedAnta. Even within vedAnta, its sub-schools compete with each other to establish their own supremacy among themselves by emphasizing or deemphasizing the pramANa-s, and particularly by differentiating the shabda-pramANa.  
  

sA.nkhya school also follows svataH prAmANya but they hold that the object itself can be intrinsically valid as well as invalid. This approach is reflected in their calling Vedas as Apta (trusted) as well as avishuddha (not very pure). In short, sA.nkhya-s reject the "law of excluded middle" while shA.nkara vedAnta does the same in the name of mAyA. FAPP however, traditional vedAnta followed realist scheme of bhaTTa-s and effectively became a closed saMpradAya (cult).  
  
Shankara brought order and sanity in the general confusion of "shabda as a tradition" by saying that all shAstra-s and their prescribed karma etc have only one purpose - that of establishing the oneness of Self (Atman) with Brahman (Cf. upadesha 2.17.4, 2.17.9). This is a radical approach which aligns dharma with moxa. Here individual movement has to be towards moxa without sacrificing individual, familial, and social obligations but without building ego or strong identities. Strong identities based on class, caste, family, race etc. has no place in vedAnta. Shankara explicitly rules them out in upadesha (Prose section), though Bhatta school injects strong Vedic identity and smRRiti-s reinforce hereditary classes by their differential treatment. Shankara could not (or did not) carry over his radical approach to brahmasUtra and consequently "vyavahAre bhATTanayaH" prevailed post Shankara.
