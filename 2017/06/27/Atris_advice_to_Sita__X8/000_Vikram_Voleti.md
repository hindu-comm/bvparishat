Hello all,

  

I am fairly new to Advaita philosophy, and am currently spending a lot of my time reading and listening to discourses on our Smritis and Upanishads (in Sanskrit).

  

I have a doubt about a point raised in Valmiki Ramayana. I'm not sure if this is the right forum to ask this - if not, please point me to the right forum.

  

Considering the Ramayana and Mahabharata have Advaita philosophy embedded in them, under a wrapping of moral advice for bhoutika life, I am listening/reading the Ramayana in Sanskrit, while considering both. There is a point raised towards the end of Ayodhya kanda when Rama, Lakshmana and Sita visit sage Atri and his wife Anasuya. Anasuya advices Sita on the virtues of a good wife. I am struggling to interpret one particular advice - a good wife always serves her husband, \*even if he is virtuous or sinful\*.

  

I can think of a lot of bad consequences of this sort of thinking, but I am assuming that I might be missing something. Is there anyone who could clarify this point for me please? 

  

Here are the verses in Sarga 117, Ayodhya Kanda (taken from [valmikiramayan.net](http://valmikiramayan.net)):

  

नगरस्थो वनस्थो वा पापो वा यदि वा अशुभः \|  
यासाम् स्त्रीणाम् प्रियो भर्ता तासाम् लोका महा उदयाः \|\| २-११७-२२

22. yaasaam= to which;striiNaam= women;bhartaa= their husband;nagarasthaH= whether lives in a city;vanasthovaa= or in a forest;paapovaa= whether he is sinful;yadi vaa= or;shubhaH= virtuous;priyaH= (he is) dear (to her);taasaam= to them;(are obtained) mahodayaaH= greatly fortunate;lokaaH= words.

"Highly fortunate worlds await those women, await those women, to whom their husband is dear no matter whether he lives in a city or in a forest; whether he is sinful or virtuous."
