Dear Shri Vikram Veloti-ji,

  

In Sanskrit textual analysis, six characteristic signs are used for discerning the text or the topic:

  

उपक्रमोपसंहारावभ्यासोऽपूर्वताफलम्।

अर्थवादोपपत्ती च लिङ्गं तात्पर्य निर्णये।।  

  

1\. Consistency between "opening and closing paragraphs" (उपक्रम-उपसंहार) , 2. Emphasis by "repeation" (अभ्यास), 3. "Originality" (अपूर्वता), of the idea, 4. "Result" (फल) if the text (idea) is put in practice, 5. "Eulogy" (अर्थवाद), or praising of the subject to illustrate its importance, 6. "Reason" - argument or justification for or against the subject.

  

Eulogy often uses exaggeration, apparent perversion, fantasy, or any other means to illustrate the importance of the subject (person, event, quality, virtue, idea etc.). It is not to be taken as true in a literal sense. It is to be reconciled with the norms (शिष्ठाचार) of the day.

  

For example, sage Atri is eulogizing the good wife and not endorsing the sins of the husband. A good (wise) wife is supposed to ignore the minor follies or inadequacies of her husband and love him. According to modern norms, she can advise him (and even admonish him) to stay away from the sins without stopping loving him or being unfaithful to him. Of course, all this need not be stretched beyond a limit where a virtue itself becomes a perversion (सद्गुणविकृति).

  

regards,
