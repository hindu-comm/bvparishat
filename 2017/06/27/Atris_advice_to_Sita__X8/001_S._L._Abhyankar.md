Overall import of the translations are okay, though word-by-word translations are not correct. A standard method, which I follow for studying a verse is

\(1\) decipher conjoint words

\(2\) understand formatting process of each word, getting to the root word, whether nominal root or verbal root

\(3\) decipher compound words and apply (2) to get to root words of the component words

\(4\) understand from dictionary, meaning(s) of the nominal or verbal roots

\(5\) put all words in a prose syntax

\(6\) translate, selecting meanings appropriate to the context. Selection becomes necessary, because many words may have number of meanings.

  

Just for illustration, the first step would lend verse२-११७-२२as =>

नगरस्थः वनस्थः वा पापः वा यदि वा अशुभः \|

यासाम् स्त्रीणाम् प्रियः भर्ता तासाम् लोकाः महोदयाः \|\|

Actually there is a problem with last two words in first line. They can be written and pronounced as (i)वा शुभः or (ii)वाशुभः or (iii)वाsशुभः or (iv)वा (अ)शुभः You will appreciate that meaning of (i) is just opposite of the rest three. This would underscore the importance of doing meticulous check of how the reference text is written. Sometimes a text as available could be wrongly written also.

  

Basically the wordअशुभः orशुभः is interesting. Usual meanings areअशुभः = of bad omenशुभः = of good omen. But by its etymology the words are derived from the verbal root शुभ् (शोभते) meaning the disposition being or becoming pleasant. For example an owl does not have any pleasant disposition at all. So it isअशुभः of bad disposition and hence of bad omen. A woman's husband beingअशुभः means one, who does not have a good disposition, either by his looks (such as unkempt beard) or by his character. For example, a drunkard would not have a good social disposition. 

  

There is problem also with the last two words in second line. You have scripted them as महा उदयाः The wordमहा cannot be an independent word. It is a component of the compound wordमहोदयाः, which has the splitमहा-उदयाः. When deciphered at step (3) the deciphering would lend महान्तः उदयाः येषु तेमहोदयाः The compound wordमहोदयाः is adjective ofलोकाः Together the two wordsमहोदयाःलोकाःmean "(those) worlds, where the (sun)-rises are (big), i.e. where the days are always bright, OR(those) worlds,where everything gives rise to big (things) The translation quoted by you as "greatly fortunate" cannot be dubbed as wrong. But the translation what one can get by deciphering would be more satisfying. Would you agree ?

  

Maybe you would like my method of study. If yes, you may proceed accordingly.
