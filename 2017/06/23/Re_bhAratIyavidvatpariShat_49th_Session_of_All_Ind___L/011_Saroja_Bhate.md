Janakisharan ji

I suggest your organising committee reconsiders the issue of dates of the session. There will be, I am afraid, quite a few senior scholars who may not be able to cope with the hot summer I have already received messages from a few Executive Committee members of AIOC 49th session who are not happy with these dates.How about Jan. or Feb.?

Please convey this message to the concerned officials.

regards

Saroja Bhate

General Secretary,49th session of AIOC
