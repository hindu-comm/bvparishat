Namaste,

  

This verse is from Devi Bhagavata Skandha 9, chapter 5. Translation of the verse is given below.

  

When great personages so desist,then what to speak of me, who is an ordinary mortal having one mouth only!” Thus saying, the Maharsi Yâjñavalkya, bowed down to the Devî.  

  

But, it would easier to understand this verse fully, if we takes into consideration the preceding and succeeding verses too. Giving below translation of these verses from Devi Bhagavata English translation by Swami Vijnanananda.

  

त्वं संस्तुता पूजिता च मुनीन्द्रैर्मनुमानवैः ॥ २७ ॥  
दैत्येन्द्रैश्च सुरैश्चापि ब्रह्मविष्णुशिवादिभिः ।  
जडीभूतः सहस्रास्यः पञ्चवक्त्रश्चतुर्मुखः ॥ २८ ॥  
यां स्तोतुं किमहं स्तौमि तामेकास्येन मानवः ।  
इत्युक्त्वा याज्ञवल्क्यश्च भक्तिनम्रात्मकन्धरः ॥ २९ ॥  
प्रणनाम निराहारो रुरोद च मुहुर्मुहुः ।  
  
The Munîndras, Manus, men, Daityendras, and Immortals, Brahmâ, Visnu and Mahes’a all worship Thee and Sing hymns to Thee. Visnu ultimately becomes inert when He goes on praising Thee by His thousand mouths. So Mahâ Deva becomes when he praises by His five mouths; and so Brahmâ by His four mouths. When great personages so desist, then what to speak of me, who is an ordinary mortal having one mouth only!” Thus saying, the Maharsi Yâjñavalkya, who had observed fasting, bowed down to the Devî Sarasvatî with great devotion and began to cry frequently.
