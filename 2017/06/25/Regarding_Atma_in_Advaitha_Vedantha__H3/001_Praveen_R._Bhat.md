It is that brahman, which is the basis of everything that is dravya or adravya, it is the subject that objectifies dravya and adravya without oneself ever being objectified, it is one who becomes Purushottama to create the entire world, and it is the uttamapuruSha in vyAkaraNa who deals with the entire creation.
