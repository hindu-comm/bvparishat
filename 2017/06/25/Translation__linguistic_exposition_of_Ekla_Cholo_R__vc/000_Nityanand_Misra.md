Dear list

  

I am looking for a good translation (word-for-word is preferred) and/or linguistic exposition of the song Ekla Cholo Re by Rabindranath Tagore. I would like to understand better words like*moner kotha*, *roktomakha*, *dolo*,*bojranole*, etc. Tagore's own translation is not literal, and I do not know Bengali well-enough to judge if a translation is good or not.

  

Also, are there any good Bengali-English/Bengali-Hindi dictionaries available online which give the origin of the words?

  

Thanks, Nityanand
