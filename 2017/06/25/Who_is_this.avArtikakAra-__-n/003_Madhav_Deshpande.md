Dear Shri Subrahmanian,

  

  I also went through Vishal Agarwal's article on Sundarapaṇḍya, but he does not refer to these quotes from Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya on the Nr̥siṃhatāpinī-Upaniṣad. But the possibility does exist. The other question is whether this Bhāṣya really belongs to the Ādi-Śaṅkara, or to one of the later Ācāryas in his lineage. The colophons of this Bhāṣya do refer to Śaṅkara-Bhagavatpāda-the discile of Govindabhagavatpāda.
Perhaps, Vishal Agarwal may know if the authorship of this Bhāṣya has been discussed or disputed by any scholars. If the author is one of the later Śaṅkarācāryas, then he could be quoting from Sureśvara's Vārttika, which needs to be checked for these quotes in any case.
