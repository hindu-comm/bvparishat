In the Anandashram series of Brihadaranyaka Vartika Vol 2, at the end, the index for the vārtikās is given in alphabetical order, with the first pāda of each verse. I checked there for the verses on hand and did not find them. I also checked in the index to the Taittiriyopanishad bhashya vartika and the Naishkarmyasiddhi. This is just to rule out Sureshwara's authorship of the verses. Let's see if any other leads emerge.
