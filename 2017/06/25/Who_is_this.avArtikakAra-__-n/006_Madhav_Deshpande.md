Thanks Vidyasankar. I was wondering about the question of authorship of this bhāṣya. Its style feels very different from the other Upaniṣad-bhāṣyas of Śaṅkara. The degree of attention paid to details of Sāmasvaras etc. is rather unusual. Whether by Ādi-Śaṅkara or not, the text deserves a serious study.
