In the bhāṣya to the Nṣimhatāpanyupaniṣat attributed to Shankaracharya, there occur a few references to a 'vārtikakāra' and his verses. I am giving two such references here.

I could not get any significant results from a google search of these verses. Nor could I search in the Brihadaranyaka bhashya vāartika of Sureshwaracharya as there is no searchable text online.

  

My request to scholars in this forum is to kindly help in identifying this 'vārtikāra' and the source of the cited verses. Is there any independent work of Sureshwaracharya or any other ancient author on the Nrsimhatapanyupanishad?

  

Thanks and warm regards
