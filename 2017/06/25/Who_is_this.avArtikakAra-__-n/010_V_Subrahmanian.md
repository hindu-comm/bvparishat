Here is another 'vārtika' verse, cited at the beginning of the nr. uttara tāp. bhāṣya:

From this and yet another I came across that is this upanishad specific, I think the reference is to a work on this very upanishad that existed prior to the bhashya. Even this verse is not traceable to any work while doing a google search. 

  

Also, are there any commentaries, references/citations, of this upanishad in any non-advaitic tradition?
