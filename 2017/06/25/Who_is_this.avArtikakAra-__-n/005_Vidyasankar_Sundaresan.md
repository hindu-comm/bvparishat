This bhAshya is included in the Sringeri-Srirangam (Vani Vilas press) collection from a century ago. It meets Paul Hacker's criterion of mss colophons referring to Sankara bhagavatpAda. It usually gets ignored in the academic literature. I haven't seen much discussion about it, either affirming its authorship by the author of the brahmasUtrabhAshya or denying the traditional attribution to Sankara.

Nevertheless, by implication, the authorship is usually denied, because when anyone says anything about authenticity of texts in the SAnkara bhAshya corpus, this commentary is typically not even mentioned.

I have to check whether Holenarsipur Swami Saccidanandendra Sarasvati has mentioned anything about this text.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
