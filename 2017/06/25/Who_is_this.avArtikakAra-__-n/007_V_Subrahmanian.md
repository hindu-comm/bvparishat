The Nr.Tāp. bhashya is referred to by HH Sri Abhinava Nrsimha Bharati Swaminah of Sringeri (1599-1622 AD) who wrote a bhashyam for the Shivagītā of the Padmapurana \[Ch.6.verse 46\]. While commenting on the word विश्वतोमुखम् of the verse he directs the reader to see what the 'Acharya' has said in his commentary to the word सर्वतोमुखम् of the nrsimha raja mantra of that Upanishad. Obviously he is referring to Shankara by that honorific.
