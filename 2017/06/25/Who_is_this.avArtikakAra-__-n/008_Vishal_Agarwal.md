Respected scholars,

  

The Nr Pu Up and Nr Ut Up are both interesting scriptures and there are mutliple opinions available regarding their antiquity, as well as that of the so called Shaankara Bhashya on them.

  

The Nr Pu Up has the infamous statement that women and shudras cannot read the Shruti, and this seems to be the oldest 'shruti' statement to contain this provision. The Nr Ut Up has the famous words 'brahmaivedam sarvam' that are quoted by all Bhashyakaras as shruti without listing the source, but these words are found nowhere else in the shruti literature exactly the same way other than in the Nrsimha Uttaratapaniya Upanishad. Similar, but not the same words, are however found elsewhere - Brahmemam sarvam (Paippalada Atharvaveda Samhita), Brahmaivedam Vishwam (Mundaka). The Purvottara text as a whole is a transitional scripture, using Vedic literature heavily (whether the Mandukya Up, the RV Samhita and so on) but its Tantric elements are quite interesting different.

  

Several editions of Brahmasiddhi of Mandana Mishra cite the words 'atraiva samvaliiyate' (quoting from memory) as coming from this Upanishad. However, these same words are found in the Madhyandina version of Brihadaranyaka Up. Most printed editions of the Br Up are of the Kanva version, and therefore, the Brahmasiddhi editors seem to miss this fact out.

  

Now coming to the commentaries: The commentary on the Purvatapaniya cites some texts like Sarasamgraha and Mantraraajakalpa. I am not sure if these texts are preShankara. Among modern scholars, Tarkateertha Lakshman Shastri Joshi believed that the Purvatapaniya commentary is genuinely the work of Shankara, whereas that on Uttaratapaniya is a forgery (see his intro to the Upanishad volumes of the Dharmakosha). G C Pande also said forcefully that the commentary on this entire text was the work of Shankara and that its differences from other Shankara commentaries is due to the fact that the Acharya wrote it towards the very end of his career. I personally find his arguments very subjective. See his 'Life and Thought of Sankaracarya' (MLBD).

  

As we come to the Vijayanagara era, the Upanishad is definitely quoted as a Shruti. Note also that the region had a vibrant following of Nrsimha Avatara. Vidyaranya's Panchadashi quotes it as Tapaniya Shruti. He also wrote a summary commentary on this Upanishad along with many others, and seems to indicate that Sureshvara wrote a Varttika on it as well. Of course, if the Nr Pu Up commentary quotes from Sureshvara's Varttika, the chances of the Bhashya being from the pen of Shankara are reduced, although the Guru can always quote from his disciples works.

  

I think the criterion that a particular Upanishad is old or new merely because Shankara or Ramanuja quote or or do not, is not very sound. Several Vedic Shakhas have been rare or have had only a very regional circulation for 2000 years and could have been ignored or missed by learned scholars. We often miss the fact that Shankara also definitely quotes the Jabala Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad, and possibly even the Paramahamsa Upanishad. Likewise, the Bashkala Mantra Upanishad has a Vrtti on it that seems to be from the pen of Shankara and is very similar in style to his other Upanishad commentaries. On the contrary, he and Ramanujado notquote the Maitrayaniya Upanishad, which is a bonafide Vedic text (its 6th Prapathaka has echoes in Vakyapadiyam, Chapters 2 and 3 in Vanaparva of the Mahabharata; quotations occur in the works of Jnanaghanapada, the grand-disciple of Shankara; in Shaabharabhashyaetc.). For that matter, they do not quote from the Talavakara or Shankhayana Aranyaka portions other than the 'Upanishad' chapters even though there is considerable Upanishadic material in other parts of these Aranyakas.

  

My 2c.
