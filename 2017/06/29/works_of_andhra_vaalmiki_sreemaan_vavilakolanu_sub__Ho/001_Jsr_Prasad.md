Namaste.  
Indeed it is a great help to all those who want to read the books of Sri Vaasu-daasu garu, especially the 'Mandaram.' Upon my brother's request, recently I started to search for this great work. With your kind help, now there is an access to His entire wealth of books.  
  

Saashtangams to Brahmasri Nelanutala Srinivasamurthy garu and Lakshminarayana garu.  

  

I believe, like me many other Telugu speaking members might benefit from the corpus.  
  

Thanks a lot!  
  

Regards
