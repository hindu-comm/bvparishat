Namaste,

  

The telugu community doesn't need the introduction of a great rAma-bhakta Brahmasri Vavilakolanu Subbarao Garu (lovingly called as vaasudaasu garu). He is also called as 'Andhra Valimiki' as he used to be in communion with his ishta devata bhagavan ramachandra and to his credit is the translation of entire vAlimiki rAmAyaNa (7 kANDAs) into telugu poetry. Those series of telugu works are named by him as 'mandaram'. Apart from this, he authored some minor works in telugu on dharma shastra, bhashyam on sandhyavandanam, telugu grammar, and others.


  

He was a great rAmOpAsaka and completed the entire 7 kandas of rAmAyaNa into telugu poetic form in a span of 4 years. During this translation period, he used to have only a cup of milk in the morning and spend 22 hours in writing. It was a great tapasya for him which he later narrated. 

  

It is a delight to see that all his works are put on web and e-books are available here. Here is the link :
