Sriram ji,

  

The pictures at the top in the website are apparently of Sri Subbarao. From his picture it appears that he is a vishishtadvaitin. I am under the impression that the suffix 'rao' is common only among smarthas and madhvas. Could you clarify? Also, a the end of the page there are two pictures of two dampati-s. Are they in any way related to the revered author?

  

Thanks

subbu
