What was your case? Please write exactly.  

Please do research yourself than quoting here and there.  

Be analytic in approach, understand the author. Please  
read the whole than getting stuck in words. Explore the substance..  

Read the poetry, not the commentary.  

Your intro says that you teach. As a teacher the task  

is to help create new researchers than citing Brahma created earth!  

That's another thread. You have the task of leading the new youth.  

I have to say this as a colleague and a well-wisher..
