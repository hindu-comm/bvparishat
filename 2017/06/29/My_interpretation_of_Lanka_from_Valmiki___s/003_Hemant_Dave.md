If you want to pursue the matter in a meaningful way, U P Shah's scholarly discussion on Lanka in his introduction to Uttarakanda should provide you a proper perspective on the entire issue. The learned author refers to a number of previous scholars and their work, in case you wish to read them.

  

Best,
