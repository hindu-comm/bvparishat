Does the Valmiki Ramayana state the existence of the Rivers Godavari and Krishna while proceeding from the Mahendragiri mountains to Lanka.

Godavari at Panchavati.  

Secondly we need to assess the sea levels then. Even today we have salt water lakes on the eastern coastline.

My thinking comes from Hanuman's "leaping" प्लवन  

Thirdly are the remains of the so called fortified city been identified in Lanka.

I have not checked.  

Fourthly there seem to be a historical relationship between Orrisa and Lanka. Ashoka sent emmisaries to Lanka in his bid to spread Buddhism.

These are much late to the legend.

Please do study Valmiki. He is the greatest creative mind ever lived.
You would be delighted.

Everything else would look trivial.
