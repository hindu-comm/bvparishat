Thank you. I had heard of the scholar, but never read him.  

There is a whole group of scholars who study India linguistically  

by dissecting words. Many of them exist where I work.  

These scholars have little to do with the poets or the authors.  

By removing the poet, an epic becomes a myth and not a  

creative contribution human effort.  
  

Dr Shah does miss the poet. You would know if you study  

the epic. There is also an effort to get a "mean" Ramayana story.  

This concept is wrong. A creative material is its own reference.  

It can be retold many ways. Each retelling could be creative in its  

own manner. I have to study what they mean by "critical".  

To me an art is not a mathematical quantity. Additions can  
occur in oral rendering, but all that freezes in time till somebody  

retells it in Maduari or Puri or in Cambodia. Each child also is  

creative in its own way..  
  

Please read Valmiki deeply. Please appreciate the creative genius.  

The statement whether Valmiki did not know south India (as claimed  

in the article) has little to do with his story and the poetry.  
  

Best regards,
