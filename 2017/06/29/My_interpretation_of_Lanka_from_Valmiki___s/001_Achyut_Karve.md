Dear Bijoy Mishra,

Does the Valmiki Ramayana state the existence of the Rivers Godavari and Krishna while proceeding from the Mahendragiri mountains to Lanka.

Secondly we need to assess the sea levels then. Even today we have salt water lakes on the eastern coastline.

Thirdly are the remains of the so called fortified city been identified in Lanka.

Fourthly there seem to be a historical relationship between Orrisa and Lanka. Ashoka sent emmisaries to Lanka in his bid to spread Buddhism.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
