I allowed this post, though it is addressed to the editorial board of the AJIS, thinking that the younger members can get educated about plagiarism questions.

  

Sir, quoting translations as translations mentioning that it is a translation while acknowledging the translator and providing bibliographical details of the translation work is not considered to be plagiarism.

  

Depending purely on translations may lead to questions of correctness of translation etc.
