Good afternoon,

  

I am Ramamoorthy Thiyagarajan, working at Research Unit of Indira Gandhi National Open University. Shortly I am going to be awarded PhD. I have prepared a paper relating to Valmiki Ramayana, titled "Leadership skills explored by Valmiki Ramayana". May i submit my paper. Kindly note since Ramayana is in Sanskrit, i have used English translation available from Webpages, which are free access, for my quotes. If u feel it is not plagiarism, i can submit by today itself. - Moorthy
