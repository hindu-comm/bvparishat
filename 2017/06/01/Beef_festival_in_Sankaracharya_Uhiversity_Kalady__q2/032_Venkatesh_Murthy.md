Namaste

  

I am surprised to see how a person can study the Sanskrit Sastras and divine Kavyas of our great Kavis and still show total insensitivity to the hurt feelings caused by Beef festivals. There is not one word of reconciliation, not one word showing empathy to fellow scholars and citizens on the matter of this Beef festival. I am wonderstruck by the stubborn ness to not see his own fault. I thought only less educated people will be this stubborn. But I was wrong.
