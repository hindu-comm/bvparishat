To supplement what Sw. TV ji said, parts of plants are cut which grow again, that is not killing the plant. Even in cases where a tree is to be cut for practical purposes, more are to be planted as a prAyaSchitta karma. Even where animal sacrifice is prescribed in the Vedas, it is with a guarantee of a higher gati for the both the jIvas, the sacrificer and the sacrificed. With social morality, it can be rejected, but Vedas have a broader perspective across lives.

  

Kind rgds,
