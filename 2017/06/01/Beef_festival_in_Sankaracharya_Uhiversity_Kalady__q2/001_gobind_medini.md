The tradition of cow worship and protection showcases the humane side of Hinduism of being grateful to the benefactor. There is no point in going into dirty politics; but this incidence shows that a section of secular Hindus and non-Hindus (particularly in Kerala and few N-E states including W.Bengal) do not appreciate this humane side of Hinduism. They want to play politics around this issue in the name of freedom of expression and food-habits.  
  
IMO, cow worship is a cultural feature and not religious dogma... (to my knowledge, we can find cow-bull sacrifices and rituals about eating their meat.. particularly in bRRihadAraNyaka (6.4.18) bull meat is recommended for the birth of a son who would become a Vedic scholar!). This is the possible reason for including it the state constitution. Had it been a religious dogma Ambedkar would not have approved it as a part of the constitution. Prohibition of cow slaughter is a Directive Principles of State Policy contained in **Article 48** of the **Indian Constitution**.
