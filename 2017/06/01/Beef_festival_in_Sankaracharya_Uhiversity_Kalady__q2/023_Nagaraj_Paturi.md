To those who argue that there are evidences of beef eating by the Vedic people in the past, irrespective of relative validity of Arya Samaj argument that this understanding is based on misinterpretation of lines or interpolations over the over beef interpretations of the same, my questions are: during the times from where beef eating is reported, the same people had a different costume, (kirīṭa etc. ), different transport , different housing etc. Do we have to start wearing those costumes, start living in such residences etc. ?

  

Science-bound rationalists and all such 'modern' people believe in the early human life being of primitive humans roaming nude. Based on that can we argue for roaming nude today?
