of course not, its not even politically motivated or about Religion. It is economically motivated as NGOs like Peta (Jallikattu) & Ford foundation & R Vatican Media who are agents of animal farming & dairy industry in US. Its like the gun industry, the Mafia controls the politicians.

  

and students are the only bastion left, hence IIT (a recent entrant) or TISS/JNU is where they push this agenda. been associated with TISS since 1984 and JNU so should know the Vatican Shadyantra.

**"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and famous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in all of us. And when we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."......Marianne Williamson**
