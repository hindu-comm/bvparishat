The surprise expressed by the thread initiator was about the University established in the name of Sankara, with significant contribution of initial funding from Sringeri Muth being a platform for such festivals.

  

But there should be no surprise to those who know how leftist governments and leftist vice chancellors appointed by them changed the univrsity's orientation away from the vision of the fund contributors like Sringeri Muth.

  

This was discussed in another thread on BVP.
