One can imagine the extent of damage these salaried so-called scholars of universities can render to Dharma. Sick thinking, sadism, secularism, liberalism, diverting and manipulating has become a fashion. In the words of Srimad Bhagavatam this is soul-killing. Course correction would need a massive and joint effort on the lines of Rajiv Malhotra's or others trying to do. Best remedy is that they start chanting hari nama (say,108×16 times) daily as recommended in Bhagavatam.
