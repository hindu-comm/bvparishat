I find it rather strange that Vidvan P V Narayanan brings in ‘Sangh Parivar’ (सङ्घपरिवारस्य मृषावादान् दृढमनुधावन्ति, सङ्घपरिवारस्य नाटकम्) out of context. The scholars are posting on BVP of their own accord. BVP is not a political forum and most scholars here are independent of the ‘Sangh Parivar’. On the contrary, it is the organization of ‘beef festival’ which is political. The Deccan Chronical report clearly says “The SFI also organised beef fests at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, …”. The SFI, or Students’ Federation of India, is the student wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which is in power in Kerala but fighting for political survival in the country.The same SFI had planned to organize a beef festival in Congress-ruled Karnataka, but the Bengaluru Police did not allow it and detained those who had turned up both for and against the festival.
