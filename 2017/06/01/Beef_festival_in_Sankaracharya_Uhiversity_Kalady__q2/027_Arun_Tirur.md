Let me shamefully add a bizarre state of mind of political as well as of ruling class of Kerala.

  

Day before yesterday G Sudhakaran, minister for public works, while inaugurating Sri Shankaracharya Sanskrit University's Shankara Birth ceremony at University's regional center at Thuravoor Alleppy, said that AdiShankara lacks greatness and popularity comparing to E M S Namboodirippad, the first communist chief minister of Kerala. Because of his support to 'chaturvarnya' he is irrelevant hence public keep off from his birth day celebrations.

  

So, a minister can abuse Adi Shankara, from the dais of Sri Shanakracharya University. This is the sad state of affairs in Kerala. Also remember the protest by left wing students who protested against erecting Shankara's statue at the entrance of University.
