I forgot to thank aadaraNIya Vidwan Sri Shrivathsa-ji for his post below for covering the important economic aspects of the issue. For Marxists, economics is everything and they try to 'guide' and 'educate' us on the basis of economics how cow-slaughter is justified. Shrivathsa-ji focused on the same economics aspect to argue how rampant cow-slaughter is not justified.
