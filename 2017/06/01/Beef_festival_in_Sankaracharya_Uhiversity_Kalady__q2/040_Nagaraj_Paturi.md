This is not conclusion from the previous sentence. This is the point based on reports that SFI, student wing of CPI (M) organized the fest.

\>Opposition to religion in general very much implies opposition to particular religions - especially those of the "dominant old order". Examples not listed here.

  

---- Religion as a phenomenon , as a feature of human life style and culture is what is being called as Religion in general. Marxism as a philosophy opposes this aspect of human life on account of that being 1.' pre-scientific', 2.' idealistic' . 3, 'fatalistic.' 4. 'status-quoist' 5. 'pro-rich' etc. Religion as a phenomenon as part of this theory includes even tribal religions and modern religions.

  

To oppose is a specific religionespecially those of the "dominant old order" is part of strategy /practice of the movement but not part of fundamental philosophical contradiction with religion itself.. 'Dominant old order' is not the reason for the fundamental contradiction between materialism and religion. Marxism's contradiction with religion philosophically is on account of it being materialism (in contrast to Hegelian idealism). It is thestrategy /practice of the movement that political parties cite to justify what they do.

  

Since that it is the activity of a student wing of a political party is the starting point of the discussion the contrast between the philosophical position and the activity is an analysis of the given, the activity.
