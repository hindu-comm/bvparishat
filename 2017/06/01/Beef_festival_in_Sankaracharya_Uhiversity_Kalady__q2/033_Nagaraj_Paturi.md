I am glad to see regrets expressed by Prof. P V Narayanan for his impolite expressions.

  

Respected vidwan Sri Venkatesh Murty-ji, I can understand where your astonishment and anguish is coming from.

  

Your view is that the cow-worshiping attitude, which is one of the traditional shaastra learner's pre-requisites is missing here.

  

Let us leave the shaastras, tradition and all such things aside just for the sake of argument.

  

I already mentioned in my earlier posts how culturally insensitive it is towards the group around you to conduct either pork or beef festivals.

  

Kerala High Court has already exposed that there was no need of a protest as the order under question does not ban beef or beef eating.

  

In spite of all this, to try to justify the beef festival or at least his not saying anything against it while trying to educate the list about the justifiability of cow-killing or beef eating in general can baffle people who expect cultural sensitivity from a shaastra-trained person.
