// In a response to my comments, another member has said that Kerala is *‘**a place where indigenous breeds have been systematically exterminated…’* This is nothing but the refection of a comment recently made by an RSS leader who racially humiliated the South Indians referring to them as ‘black’ (hence apparently ugly) people.//  
  

If the writer (Dr P. V. Narayanan) is referring to Tarun Vijay a BJP MP from Rajyasabha and the former editor of RSS weekly Panchajanya, then this is what he said in an Al Jazira interview while defending India against the charge of racism and discrimination against the blacks:  
  
"If we were racist, why would have...all the entire south which is complete...you know Tamil. You know Kerala. You know Karnataka and Andhra. Why do we live with them? We have black people around us. You are denying your own nation, you are denying your ancestry, you are denying your history, you are denying your culture and you are trying to be good."  

The BJP leader, however, apologised for his statement while admitting that his choice of words was wrong.

"I feel the entire statement said this - we have fought racism and we have people with different colour and culture, still never had any racism," Vijay said. "My words perhaps were not enough to convey this. Feel bad, really feel sorry, my apologies to those who feel I said different than what I meant," he added.

So to conclude that Mr. Vijay racially humiliated the South Indians referring to them as ‘black’ (hence apparently ugly) people seems to be a rather shrill and exaggerated reaction, particularly when Mr Vijay had already apologized without any delay.
