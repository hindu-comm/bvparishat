Dear Subbuji,

  

There is a separate category called "*intellectual perverts*" who are more dangerous to the society. Literally, they are called 'चारुवाकः' who are learned in scriptures and twist them, thus, their voices are 'pleasing to the ears'. 

  

This new class is more dangerous / destructive in nature than ignorant people.

  

चतुस्सागरः पर्यन्तं गोब्राह्मणेभ्यः शुभं भवतु...

  

regs,

sriram
