It is ironical that beef fest is arranged in Shankaracharya University of Sanskrit where Shrigeri Matha is a fund contributor. It is expected by the ordinary Hindus like us that the Matha writes to the University administration to lodge a protest and express its concern after verification of the Deccan Chronicle report.  
  
Their seems to be some confusion about Matha's relationship with the University if Dr. P. V. Narayanan's report is to be believed. (प्रथमं तावदिदमवधेयं यत् कालटि श्रीशङ्कराचार्य संस्कृतविश्चविद्यालयस्य शृङ्गेरिमठेन सह न कोऽपि सम्बन्धो वर्तते। नापि चास्य प्रारम्भाय पश्चात् प्रचालनाय वा मठात्तस्मात् एकस्यापि रूप्यकस्य साहाय्यं स्वीकृतम्।). Even then Amnyaya Mathas and reputed Mathas like Shringeri and Kanchi can write to the university established in the name of Shanakaracharya and express their concern.  
  
Article 48 of the Constitution of India mandates the state to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle. Even if for the sake of argument we assume that the article projects only economic concerns, its mandate is clear and needs to be respected. If Kannur and other such beef festivals violate the directive principle of the constitution then such festivals are not justified (even though directive principle is only advisory) and legal action needs to be taken..to my knowledge, in Kannur such action has been taken.

P.S. Personally, I am against the cruelty perpetrated against the animals - particularly when they are killed for religious or for non-religious purpose.
