Namaste

  

It is not correct to compare Pork and Beef because Pig is not sacred animals for Muslims. But Cow is sacred for many Hindus. At least for showing respect to sentimental values and national leaders like Vinoba Bhave it is poor judgement to organize Beef festivals. It is poor judgement and lack of empathy to write in this forum and defend it like Sri Narayanan has done.How can rats and cows be equal? Should we give up all decency and commonsense in the name of Questioning our beliefs?
