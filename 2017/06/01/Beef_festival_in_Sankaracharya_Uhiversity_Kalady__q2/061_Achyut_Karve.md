Dear Patuariji,

This group I believe is not a religious group. It is a group of scholars and intellectuals. I suggest that you do not put up threads that would result in any way bringing in the belief systems of individuals or of contemporary social groups. For eg. Madhav Deshpande's post on Anachaara was regarding historical belief systems. These topics are handled with facts and references and do not have a tendency to go wild. However the thread in question was not so right from the beginning.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
