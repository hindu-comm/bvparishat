If you begin to feel ashamed of such politicians , there can be no end to it. We have plenty of them all around.

  

It is pitiable to see a minister not knowing whom to compare to whom. He doesn't seem to know that E M S Namboodirippad is not known outside Kerala, leave alone outside India.

  

S'ankaracharya is known and revered all over India.

  

Kerala's demography itself is such that 26.56% are Muslims. 18.38% are Christians. (44.94% non-Hindus) Hindus are 54.73% (<http://www.census2011.co.in/religion.php>)

  

Participation in S'ankaracharya birth day celebrations depends on this.

  

The CPI (M) workers who participate in EMSN birth day celebrations are not the whole of Kerala, leave alone whole of India.

-------------------

  

The beef festivals were organized by the student wing of CPI (M) , Marxists.

  

Marxism, as a (dialectical ) materialist ideology is anti-religious. It is expected to oppose religion in general, all religions and all religious beliefs. Karl Marx himself when he talked against religion as a phenomenon, all the examples he had in mind were from Christianity or Judaism or remotely Islam. In any case, if Marxists wanted to protest against religious belief (not to eat beef), then to show that, they could have protested against the belief that pork should not be eaten too. Pork is eaten by a good number of poor people in India. Their right to their food habit too could have been voiced. (While I point this out to expose the double standards of the festival organizing and participating Marxists, I am against any such festival of pork too). Why did they choose to protest against the food related belief of only Hinduism and not against the same of any other religion?
