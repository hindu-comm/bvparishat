Any moderator of a group likes to have the least number of members under 'moderated' list to lessen the amount of moderating work.

  

I wish the same here. I wish the number of members whose posts are considered to be potentially digressing etc. is as small as possible.

  

But I am sorry to note that the number needing moderation is growing.

  

These digressing posts below, even after cautioning against digressions is an example of such a growing need.
