This thread is not focused on vegetarianism Vs non-vegetarianism. While all pro-beef eating or pro-non-vegetarian, all pro-non-vegetarian or not pro-beef. Similarly all beef-eaters are non-vegetarians, all non-vegetarians are not beef-eaters. Majority of non-vegetarians in India are against beef-eating.

  

That shows that vegetarianism Vs non-vegetarianism topic is different from beef-eating vs anti-beef-eating topic.

  

More over the this thread is not focused on the question of beef-eating vs anti-beef-eatingalso.

  

All beef-eaters do not perform beef-festivals.

  

So the focus here is on beef-festival at a specific place, SSUS, and its incongruence with that place on account of the name in which it is being run and not on beef-eating in general.

  

Whether a court points it out or not, even if a child points out that emperor did not have clothes, while others were not able to point out the same, the fact of whether emperor had clothes on his body or not has to be argued only by showing clothes on the emperor's body.

  

Any vegetarianism Vs non-vegetarianism discussion, only so far as it is relevant to Sanskrit or Indic knowledge tradition may be started as a new thread.
