BVP is not a forum meant for discussion on all issues. It has a specialized focus.

  

Since views for and/or against cow-protection, cow-slaughter etc. are very much part of Indic knowledge tradition, the focus of the group, and SSUS is a university with "of Sanskrit" included in its name, and its name includes the name of Sri S'ankaracharya , the topic of the thread was allowed as relevant to the group.

  

All other topics are beyond the focus of the group.
