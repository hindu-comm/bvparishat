Respected Members of the BV Parishad

  

I want to share two things about cow slaughter and food in Vedas.

  

1\. There is a debate on Beef eating in Vedas. But Sringeri Jagadguru Bharathi Mahaswmami clearly said in an Anugraha Bhashanam (Telugu) that Sastras contain the statement "An innocent cow should not be slaughtered". The link to the video is here<https://youtu.be/qnZaovlUjbU?t=10m52s> .

  

2\. The Veda clearly says in the Taittiriya Upanishad "ओषधीभ्यो अन्नम्" "Food comes from vegetation". Pujya Dayananda Swamiji used to add to this that though one may have a non-vegetarian meal, food comes from vegetation and can therefore be vegetarian alone.

In this context, I would like to share what Swami Tattvavidanandaji told in an Upanishad class recently where the mantra "ओषधीभ्यो अन्नम्" came up for discussion. He acknowledged the objection that people raise about plants too having life and dismissed it saying that though plants too have life, the objection is misplaced. This is because, ओषधी is explained by our Rishis as "फलपरिपाकान्तम्" "That whose life ends with its giving its respective ripened fruit". A paddy crop, for example, dies after it gives us the rice grains. The crop is over after it gives its fruit, which in this case is rice grains. So is the case with wheat and most of the vegetables. Take tomatoes, or sugar cane or even bananas, for example. That is why farmers have to start afresh every year. Therefore, we are not killing to eat, but only eating that whose life is already over. The Rishis had a clear intention in mind and made rules only after being well thought out.

  

  
  
  
Thanking You
