Sorry for having posted on a closed thread. In my opinion many of the issues discussed in this thread are beyond the scope of BVP. Its best not to have such posts or start thread that leads to digressions and controversies. The list moderator perhaps can close such threads at the outset. The learning one derives from several such threads that go on BVP list is very low. Posts are posted without deleting previous posts. If one wants to read its hard to make sense. Tthis happens on almost all threads.
