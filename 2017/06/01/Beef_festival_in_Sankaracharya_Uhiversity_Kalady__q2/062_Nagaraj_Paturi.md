Thanks Sri Achyut Karve-ji, for the good point and good suggestion distinguishing posts about belief systems and posts expressing belief systems.

  

But my observation is that posts expressing belief systems can always enter the threads with posts about belief systems and can digress into conflict between belief systems.

  

Among academic fields, particularly social sciences and humanities have a potential for ideological differences entering into discussions from time to time.

  

Particularly fields like Indology /studies on Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ studies on Indic Knowledge Traditionshave been more and more prone to such ideology based conflicts. Biases like Euro-centrism, Orientalism, Colonialism etc. themselves have become topics in the studies (of cultures/knowledge traditions) of this kind. Particularly in Indology /studies on Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ studies on Indic Knowledge Traditions, unlike in comparable fields like Egyptology, Studies of classical Greece/ Greek etc where the people, languages and cultures that make the subject matter of the field are not owned up as 'mine' or felt as sources of their current living culture by the people of the region, Indians own up the people and culture that make the subject matter of Indology /studies on Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ studies on Indic Knowledge Traditionsas 'mine' and feel that culture as source of their current living culture. Biases like Euro-centrism, Orientalism, Colonialism etc. which look at the subject matter of the field 'Sanskrit literature and Shaastras /Indic Knowledge Traditions' itself with antagonistic outlook are reacted to passionately in such conditions.Political ideologies like Marxism too do the same , look at the subject matter of the field 'Sanskrit literature and Shaastras /Indic Knowledge Traditions' itself with antagonistic outlook. This antagonistic outlook too is reacted to passionately by the people who own up Sanskrit literatureand shaastras/
Indic Knowledge Traditions' as 'mine' and feel that culture as source of their current living culture. This forum, among many other things,
has a near 'unity' in defending the subject matter ofIndology /studies on Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ studies on Indic Knowledge Traditions, i.e., Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ Indic Knowledge Traditionsfrom the antagonistic outlook towards them, from
biases like Euro-centrism, Orientalism, Colonialism etcand from political ideologies like Marxism which are equally biased. In other words this forum has a respect for and is biased in favor ofthe subject matter of the field ofIndology /studies on Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ studies on Indic Knowledge Traditionsi.e.,Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ Indic Knowledge Traditions.

  

This thread was initiated by a person with a naive, I should say, surprise at what was happening at a place imagined by that person to be a place that has a respect for and is in favor ofthe subject matter of the field ofIndology /studies on Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ studies on Indic Knowledge Traditions i.e.,Sanskrit literature and shaastras/ Indic Knowledge Traditions.Through the discussion it became clear that his imagination and expectation was wrong, next time when he hears such news he should not be surprised.

  

That the event under question was not necessary brought out unambiguously by an official forum, one of the organs of our government which has expertise in examining evidences, proofs, reasoning etc.

  

All the obfuscating outpours on the achievements of Indic Knwledge Traditions have already been countered in various suitable legitimate fora effectively and irrefutably.

  

With this, the thread is being closed.
