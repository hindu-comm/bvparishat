Each discussion has its focus based on the starting observation. To list all other issues that come to mind and say that that discussion does not focus on all those reveals being impatient abouta focused discussion and as per this member it is being intellectually patient.

The focus of the thread is a beef festival conducted at SSUS by Marxist students. The member justifies it by saying,

  

"BUT, it SHOULD NOT BE an act denying the rights of others. If the habit of eating beef is a culturally and historically evolved practice it should be given space in the society. ***When it is denied*** people naturally will protest in their own way. Students who uphold the democratic values also will participate in it."

  

It is exactly this argument that "It is denied", that the court has disproved. The court asked people to bring proof from the order under question that it is denied.
