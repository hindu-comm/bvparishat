Nagaraj Sir,

  

First of all, hats off to you for the way you have handled this thread.

  

The one person in question, who is pointing fingers at our culture, tradition, scriptures and calling them superstitions has made his intentions clear too. He has an ideology which he wants to uphold. This is quite evident from his posts. When he says, he thinks logically, why does he not read the particular law, in its entirety and then speak rationally, I ask.

  

I would like to conclude by mentioning that any discussion with a 'vitaMDavaadin' doesn't bear any fruit.

  

It's better to close the thread and move on.
