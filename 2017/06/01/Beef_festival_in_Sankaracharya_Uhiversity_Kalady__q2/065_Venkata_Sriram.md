Dear Nagaraj garu,

  

Yes ! I was unaware of that place. I held that university in high esteem owing to the place 'Kalady' and that too bearing the name of jagatguru.  Now, i am clear about it's polarization.

  

What is more surprising is that even sanskrit scholars there hold this polarized view. A basic sanskrit student need to study 'raghuvamsa' kaavya and even after reading such a beautiful poetry, if the heart doesn't melt....then, probably, it is Kalidasa's failure in producing 'rasa-nishpatti' to such readers. 

  

regs,

sriram
