Dear Sri Nagaraj-ji  
  
Ahimsa is the highest dharma, says the Mahabharata. We cant practice full ahimsa, but we must strive to reduce himsa as much as possible, IMO. As human beings evolve technologically, they should also evolve morally and intellectually. Ideally, the world should proceed towards vegetarianism and even veganism, IMO, as humanity progresses. However, that is only an ideal and current reality is different.  
  
Having said that, while consumption of any form of meat is tolerable, celebration of meat eating is nothing short of barbarianism IMO, because it is equivalent to celebrating violence. I therefore fully agree with you when you say you neither support beef festivals nor pork festivals. I thank you for injecting sanity into this discussion.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
