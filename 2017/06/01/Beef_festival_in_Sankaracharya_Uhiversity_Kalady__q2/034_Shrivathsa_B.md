hariH OM,

  

PV Narayanan's hand waving can perhaps even accommodate cannibals!

  

To think that this man comes from a place where indigenous breeds have been systematically exterminated and he being blissfully unaware of it is extremely saddening. It is perhaps people of his thinking who perpetrated the worst genetic extermination of a species in recent human history.

Let us also not forget that Kerala gets a large percentage of its milk requirements met from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

Does all of this surprise anyone? If anything, PV Narayanan should have been at the forefront against the beef festival. But no. He is at best, blissfully unaware and at worst, in cahoots with an ideology which is destroying natural resources.

  

I request the group administrators to formulate a policy against idle and irresponsible intellectualism. There seems to be a need for promotion of "skin in the game" intellectualism.

  

The intelligentsia of a society which looks upon rodents as equivalent to cows is in severe need of course correction. A clear case of idle intellectualism which is at the same time reality denying.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
