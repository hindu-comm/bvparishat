Making sweeping generalizations about an entire group of which one is a member and casting aspersions on the entire group using characterizations such as 'unity' , is nothing but putting oneself on one side of the fence as jnaani and placing the entire remaining group on the other side as ajnaani.

  

The group needs to take a decision about how to proceed with one of them blaming all the remaining of them.
