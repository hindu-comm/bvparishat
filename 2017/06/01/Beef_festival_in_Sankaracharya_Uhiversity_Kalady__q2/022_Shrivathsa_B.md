hariH OM,

  

 "Cow, the life giver and rodents the pests are equal."

  

 "Our country was agriculture dominant at the time of independence and the mention of cow in the constitution is incidental". (Begging the question as to whether people have stopped eating altogether in 70 years since independence. The possibility according to him seems quite real!)

  

 This is the limit to which one can stretch one's kutarka while calling others opinions as aj\~naanamUla.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
