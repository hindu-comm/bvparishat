Namaste

  

Carefully reading Sri Narayanan's email he says -I’m not a member of any organization affiliated to CPI (M) or any other left party now.

  

Does it mean he is not member now but was a member sometime in the past?

  

There are many sympathizers for Communists in Kerala. Before solving big social problems of India why is he not worrying about Kerala's own problems? My friends migrating from Kerala say the environment is so depressing and employers are always scared of strikes and Bandhs by employees. Any business leader will think hard to start any business and employing workers there because of the Communists.
