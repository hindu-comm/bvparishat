Namaste

  

It is sad to see Truth is always so very difficult to get in these matters. The Press does not tell the Truth, the Politicians do not tell the Truth and the bureaucratic officials do not tell the Truth, the Religious leaders do not tell the Truth. The best every body is does is tell Half-Truth but not whole Truth. One insider is there but even his message cannot be read. What an unfortunate situation.
