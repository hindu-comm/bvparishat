Whether Sringeri Math's funds are involved or not,

  

the fact remains that

  

The leftist /Marxist vice-chancellors appointed by leftist /Marxist governments of Kerala subverted the spirit of Sri Sankaracharya in whose name the university is founded. In this[post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/FRQ_Y07zTYg/A3kyGY6TAQAJ)on BVP I sharedthe Vision of Mission page of the university where the verse  

  

शृतिस्मृतिपुराणानामालयं करुणालयम्

नमामि भगवत्पादशंकरं लोकशंकरम्

  

is printed.( underlines and the box around the verse for highlighting are mine).

  

Prof. P V Narayanan himself admits :

  

कालटि श्रीशङ्कराचार्य संस्कृतविश्वविद्यालयः न केवलं संस्कृतस्य तदनुबन्धिनां च विषयाणां विश्वविद्यालयो भवति। तत्र विद्यमानेषु उपपञ्चविंशतिविभागेषु केवलं सप्त वा अष्टौ वैव संस्कृतसम्बन्धिनो भवन्ति।नाम्ना आदिशङ्कराचार्यं समादृत्य वृत्त्या लक्ष्येण च विश्वविद्यालयोऽयं संस्कृतं विषयान्तराण्यपि यथाशक्ति समुपसेवमानोऽस्ति।  

  

This is one of the aspects of subversion /misleading since the name of the university has '**of Sanskrit**' in it.

  

The second aspect of subversion/misleading is to do Marxism in the name of Shankara. Contradictions between Marxism and Shankara galore. (details beyond the scope of the post). 

  

Beef festivals etc. are not even ideologically Marxist, as already pointed out. Marxism as ideology is opposed to religion in general and not against cow-worshipor any one such strand of one of the religious traditions in particular. These activities are clearly activities of a particular party claiming allegiance to Marxism.
