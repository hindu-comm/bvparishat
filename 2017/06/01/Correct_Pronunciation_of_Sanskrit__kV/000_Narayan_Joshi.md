Prof Korada in recent posting

यद्यपि बहु नाधीषे तथापि पठ पुर व्याकरणम् ।

स्वजनः श्वजनो मा भूत् सकलं शकलं सकृत् शक्रुत् ॥

Each year the local Chinmay mission temple invites me to act as one of the examiners in yearly Geetaa chanting competition. The resident swami of the temple is another examiner. From the last 4 years I was requesting swamiji to see my power point presentation on Internal beauty (VarNavada) of Sanskrit. Finally he found time on May 27 of this year and sat with me for 3hours to see more than 100 slides. He was impressed and said that he was delighted to see the new dimension of Sanskrit. In my presentation I use examples of Indrashatru, svajana and shvajana, sakala and shakala, sakrut and shakrut and kaNa and ks’aNa. If change of accent changed outcome of Indrashatru, how much effect change of a phoneme will do? We see it clearly that change of a single phoneme causing changes in meaning in the listed examples. Meaning of VarNas will increase interest in Sanskrit and its correct pronunciation. Thanks. NRJOSHI
