Dr Korada, Dr Shastry and other scholars, my Pranaams.

  

Though this thread has been closed, I am tempted to raise one intimately related issue here.

  

The issue is- One knows well the writing of words, sentences or verses in Sanskrit in grammatically correct way, but is not able to pronounce or recite in a correct fashion due to some tongue/teeth defects and also inadequate knowledge of pronunciations.

  

The case is 'I myself'. I have memorised many Stotras and a few Rigvedic Suktas which are very dear to me. I have written down in grammatically correct way; but, I am not able to pronounce in acceptable/ pleasant way.

  

With recommendation of some renowned Vedic scholars, I joined a good Vedic school (Ashram) in Maharashtra and stayed there for two months (along with all young Vidyarthis ) to learn correct pronunciations. With God's Grace , I received 'Santhas' and could learn to pronounce/recite some Suktas (10-12 no ) fairly well to the satisfaction of Pandits/ Adhyapakas there. But, somehow, I was not able to acquire that skill for normal Stotras. The Adhyapakas give 'Santhas' for Suktas only and not for Stotras. As I observe the main difficulties in correct pronunciations are regulated breathing and pauses at correct places.

  

I shall be really grateful if some scholars give me guidelines for correct pronunciations of Stotras and Suktas both. May be, some books/links are available.

  

Warm Regards.

-Ashok Gudsoorkar.
