Namaste



1. The illustration is drawing attention to ‘ Samskruth Pronunciation within the frame of Indian Context and Vedic Traditions of usage where faith- devotion still plays a critical rule’.



2. We have more stories where ‘ imperfect pronunciation’ is believed and practiced for delivery of miracles for the devout practitioners’. One such usage is ‘ (nArAyaNa - nAreyaNa :: *नारायण - नारेयण ) *. This is the story associated with the place called Kaivara at Karnataka. The logic offered is : God undersands the intention wrapped in imperfect use of language ! (bhAvagrAhI janAradanaH as against bhAshA roopI …). 



3. The illustration is also a pointer on the importance of training ‘ Veda - Social - Service Provider ( Purohita/ Archaka)’ ,
for proper use of ‘ Samskrutha –Varna – Uccharana’ in ‘ Mantra –prayoga’s to render the ‘Veda – Samskrutha Mantras’ services ( at homes or Mandirs). Many good meaning actions have ended up in delivering unwarranted unwanted results !



4. The illustration is also a pointer to the importance of education processes to ‘Create awareness on the importance of ‘ Samskrutha Uccharna’ for getting the right results , for the less knowledgeable and believing customer, who heavily depend on social media, Television channel broadcasts of ‘ mantras’, youtube chants and facebook shares to ‘ grab and learn Veda- mantras’ as ‘Self- Education’ and ‘ Free for all exploration’. 



5. There are several larger dimensions of this issue, which Indian language academia and teams seeking Battle: Sanskrit need to address. They are : Challenges and outcomes in the reading of Samskruth in manuscripts of regional languages and ‘ Language –Grammar –Articulation ‘ for Alignments that need to be addressed as a part of academic
publications of ‘Shuddha –Paatha’ = Critically Edited Correct rendition of Samskruth Text for Correct Pronunciation . This is a different dimension of Samskruth studies, deeply engaged with ‘ Critical editing of manuscripts and texts, on the Latin Scholastic model’. 



( Reading of Samskruth texts through conventions of Romanization ,
Machine –Transcription and Translations, and Plurality of scribing conventions including IPA / Diacritics on roman alphabets – is a bigger, dangerous and contemporarily challenging stable to clean up ! ). 



Summarily, there seems to be convergence of thought on ‘Recognition and Acknowledgement of the Problem facing Samskrutham: Correct Pronunciation’. And This recognition- acknowledging the problem can be the first step to revisit the ‘Shikshaa Foundation of Vyakarna’ . One can not change unless one acknowledges the existence of a Problem. (Dr. Yadu in some earlier post has said this).



This foundational traditional model, the Varna- Uccharana -Yoga way of starting Samskruth studies, recommended as ‘Vedanga Vyakarana Paddahti’
was sacrificed at the altar of ‘ Classical Language Status seeking and modeling of Samskrutham’ in academia and ‘ Social Conversation model push to popularize Sanskrit’. So much so that one of the prestigious institutions offering Sanskrit studies had made an open declaration: ‘ There is no need to read or utter even a single Sanskrit word for successful completion of the program; it was considered enough to have the skill of reading the script ( in anglicized diacritics mode) ‘. 



Look for Action suggestions and support.
