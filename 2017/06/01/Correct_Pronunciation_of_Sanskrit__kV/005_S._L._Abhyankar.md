What should be English spelling of संस्कृतम् ? What makes most people in south India tend to use "tha" instead of "ta" ?

  

I get to think that all संस्कृत words should be written in देवनागरी only, period. That would avoid all mistakes of pronunciation also, such as भक्षक instead of रक्षक, गीथा instead of गीता, etc.
