Namaste,

  

There was an interesting incident that happened in Bengal which I used to hear from my teacher who taught meचण्डी पाठः. The method of recital of चण्डी पाठः consists ofपूर्वांगः andउत्तरांगः respectively. The पूर्वांगः consists ofदेवीकवच, अर्गळ, कीलक whereदेवीकवचं is a prayer to Goddess Chandika for protection of oneself (self, entire limbs of body, one's wife, children, lineage etc.). 

  

A sample shloka is given below where Goddess Indrani is is prayed to protect one's gotra, Chandika for protection of agricultural livestock,

Mahalakshmi for protection of one's progeny and Goddess Bhairavi for protection of one's better-half.

  

गोत्रमिन्द्राणि! मे रक्षेत्पशून्मे रक्ष चण्डिके ।  
पुत्रान् रक्षेन्महालक्ष्मीर्भार्यां **रक्षतु** भैरवी ॥ 40 ॥  

  

The bengali archaka while chanting this shloka used to utter "bhakSatu" instead of "rakSatu" owing to the typos. He used to get negative results and his wife used to suffer with ailments. Interestingly "b" and "r" both look alike in Bengali script. If we put a small dot (.) beneath the letter "b", it becomes "r".***\[Bengali Script : ব - b ; র - r\]***

  

Though, this could be aआख्यानं to give prime importance to theवर्णोच्चारणं, it should be noted that considerable importance was given to pronunciation that may give wrong results if mis-spelt. 

  

Also, the proper halt and care is compared to a tigress which, while moving from one place to another, holds it's cub with it's teeth at the neck. The teeth neither injures the tender neck of the cub nor the cub slips off from the tigress's hold. 

  

regs,

sriram
