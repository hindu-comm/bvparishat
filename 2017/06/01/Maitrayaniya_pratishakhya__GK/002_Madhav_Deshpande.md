Dear Gowtham Sarmaji,  

  

   According to the researches of Witzel and Kashikar, the Maitrāyaṇīya community was found mostly in the adjacent regions of Gujarat and northern Maharashtra, and that the Gujarat branch seemed to be in a better preserved condition. The search for Maitrāyaṇīya Prātiśākhya in Gujarat may be more fruitful.

  I have discussed the social history of the Maitrāyaṇīya Śākhā in northern Maharashtra in a recently published article, and I have attached here that article for those who may be interested.
