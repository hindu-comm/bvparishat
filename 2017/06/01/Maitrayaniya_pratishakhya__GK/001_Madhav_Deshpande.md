Dear Gowtham Sarmaji,

  

  Yudhishthira Mimamsaka had reported that during his visit to Nasik, he saw a manuscript of the Maitrāyaṇīya Prātiśākhya at the home of the Late Shridhar Shastri Ware. I myself spent some time in Nasik many years ago in search of this manuscript, but could not find any. This is the only reference to this Prātiśākhya that I am aware of.
