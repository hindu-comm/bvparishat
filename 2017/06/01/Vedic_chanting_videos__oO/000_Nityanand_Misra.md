Dear list

  

A few years ago, I had come across a link to an Indian government website which had a rich compilation of Vedic chanting videos. If I recall correctly, one of the video series was for Yajurveda chanting led by a senior Shrivaishnava acharya named Parashurama Ghanapathi (or a similar name).

  

Unfortunately I have lost the link to the video series. If somebody has them, they are requested to please share.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
