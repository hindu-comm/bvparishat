I had come across the attached map of Indian subcontinent (partly) which is drawn on a linguistic basis.  
  

Is it possible to explain following points though they might not directly connected with the study of Sanskrit? (Assuming the linguistic map is correct).  
  

1\. The Brahui language is supposed to belong to Dravidian group and (yet) it is found in Balochistan (and also in Afghanistan if one goes by the wiki).  
  

2.The Dravidian group languages are not only found in South India but also in Eastern part of India and also in Balochistan.  

  

3\. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Bengal are non-Dravidian (Indo-Aryan) language areas and yet only Marathi is sharing the Devanagari script with the Hindi heart-land.  
  

4\. What is the oldest reference of Sanskrit, (not the word but language), by way of inscription, manuscript, or in any other manner in (a) India and (b) out side India.  
  

5\. What is the oldest reference of Devanahgari script in India.
