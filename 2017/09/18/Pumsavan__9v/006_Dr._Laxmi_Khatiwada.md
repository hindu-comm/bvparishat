Thank you for your valuable information. I am digging out the OM glyph from Indus script. OM is a PRAN SHAKTI or trinity power of sound. It seems related to fetus symbol. Among the डिम्ब, जीवा, भ्रूण the OM symbol seems the shape between the transaction period from जीवा to भ्रूण। In this period Pineal gland is built in embryo. And I am seeking the relation between OM glyph, Pineal gland formation process.
