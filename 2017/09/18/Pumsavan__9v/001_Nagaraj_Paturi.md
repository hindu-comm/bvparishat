Dear Dr Laxmi Prasad-ji,

  

Can you be more specific about your question?

  

1\. Are you talking about the development of fetus? Are you asking about the development of Pineal Gland ( called "third eye" in the early period of its discovery) in the fetus ? Do you want to know if there is anything in the S'aastras indicating that Pumsavana rituals are intended to /contribute to the development of Pineal Gland in the fetus ?

  

2\. Are you talking about the married couple and/or the pregnant woman and her husband? Do you want to know if there is anything in the S'aastras indicating that Pumsavana rituals are intended to /contribute to the development of Pineal Gland in either the husband's or wife's brain?

  

If it is #2, how did you get this question? Are you thinking of husband combing the hair of the pregnant woman /affectionately touching the mang of the pregnant woman? If the trigger of your question is this act by husband, then it is Seemantonnayanam not pumsavanam.
