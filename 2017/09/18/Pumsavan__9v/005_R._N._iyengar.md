I do not know of studies that connect Pumsavana rites with the Pineal Gland. However there are studies that explore relation between Anatomy, Neurology and yogic chakras. In the present case, I presume, pineal gland gets correlated with Ajnachakra. There is a claim that Om-glyph like formation is physically present in the brain structure which perhaps gets self-reflected in deep meditation. I am only providing some information available in Journals. I have attached a paper published in IJHS in 1987 on the subject. If you are a medical doctor you may be able to appreciate it better.

Thanks

RN Iyengar
