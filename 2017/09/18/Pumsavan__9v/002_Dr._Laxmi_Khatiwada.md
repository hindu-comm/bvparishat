Dear Nagaraj sir in  

I am seeking the answer of #1. the development of Pineal Gland in the fetus or embryo in 8ths week or within. Indus Om script is deciphered a symbol of fetus. Om is the symbol of Praana and trisakti or trinity power. Pumsavan karma is seems to pray for a better praana in the fetus not boy or girl baby. I want to know the relation of Indus culture and contemporary Hindu (not exact hindu but sanatan culture)

  

Laxmi
