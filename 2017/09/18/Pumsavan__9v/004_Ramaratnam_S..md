Dear scholars,

  

With all humility I would like to say that the present reporter has brought out a book entitled 'The Ritual Traditions of India' wherein the significance of rituals is discussed at length. I would not say that it contains all the scientific aspects of the rituals but it can serve as a starting point for the discussions.  

  

with regards,

Dr.S.Ramaratnam,

Vice Chancellor,

Jagadguru Kripalu University,
