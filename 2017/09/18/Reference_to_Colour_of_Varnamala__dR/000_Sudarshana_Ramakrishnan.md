Namaskar,  
  
This is my first post so please excuse in advance for any group rules I might not be aware. Quick search did not provide me with the topic I am looking for.  
  
My request is regarding any references in texts to associate specific Colours to Aksharas in the Varnamala.  
  
For examples - Ka varga is Green (I made it up ) and Da Varga is (blue shades) . What colour gets associated with various swaras?  
  
Maybe there is some texts around raga and colour associations.  
  
If there is an existing list or clear reference that will greatly help.  
  
For example, there is a type of *Synesthesia* called Chromesthesia. It maps sounds to specific colours in the brain and the listener always associates (please look up online for the terms).  
Is there any research recent or past around this within our tradition?  
  
I din't want to make it too long, but let me know and I can explain context for my request.  
  
Thanks,  
Sudarshan
