Dear Scholars,

Since about two months, I am facing one serious difficulty.

I am receiving many mails/posts of commercial nature: ie from Banks, Insurance companies, Financial institutions etc. Neither am I member of those institutions nor have i entertained any correspondence with them. (eg- During 19th-21st Aug, I received 50 mails of such nature, out of total-200 mails !

  

I am having some fear/anxiety of 'hacking'. some of us might have experienced such difficulty earlier. I request you to offer suggestions to prevent such mails/posts. Warm Regards.
