Respected scholars,  
I would be greatly thankful if anyone could direct me to any biographical etc sources on Vaidyanaatha Tatsat, who - among many other texts - has written the Alamkaaracandrikaa on the Kuvalayaananda. The NCC (vol 32) lists a great variety of texts written by the author, none of which (apart from the above) is available to me. It mentions further that he was son of Raamacandra (this info the author gives himself at the end of Alamkaracandrika) and grandson of Vitthala Bhatta . Any clues on these?  
Any hints for possible directions of inquiry would be very much appreciated!

Andrey
