Namaste,

The chapter on amshitva hetu (being a composite whole as an indicator of mithyAtva) from the advaita siddhi is available here:

  

<http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-amshitva-hetupapattih>

  

The siddhikAra takes up a syllogism proposed by chitsukhAchArya for analysis.  

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
