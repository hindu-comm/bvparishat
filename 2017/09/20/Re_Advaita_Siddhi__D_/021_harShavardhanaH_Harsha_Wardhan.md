Namaskar to all

  

This ongoing translation of the Advaitasiddhi is an excellent initiative.

  

Apart from Sri Ganganath Jha's english translation, is there any other english translation of the Advaitasiddhi available? I am referring to a complete translation here, not abridged.

  

best

Harsha
