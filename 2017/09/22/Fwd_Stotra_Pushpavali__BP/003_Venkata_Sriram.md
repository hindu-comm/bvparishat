Namaste,

  

Few months back, I had read her works of Satguru Tyagaraja. A beautiful masterpiece on the saint bard ! A vivid descriptions and hymns is the evidence that she is receiving spiritual guidance from Tyagaraja Swami - a great nAdOpAsaka and rAma-bhakta.

  

My prostrations to maatrumurti pusha ji.

  

rgs,

sriram
