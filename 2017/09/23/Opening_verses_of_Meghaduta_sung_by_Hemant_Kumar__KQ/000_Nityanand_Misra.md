Dear list

  

Sharing this rendition of verses 1 to 5 and verse 9 of Meghaduta by the late Hemant Kumar which I came across today. The pronunciation by the singers is almost perfect! Thanks toSreekanth V Lakkidi for pointing this out to me.

PS: Does anybody know who the female singer is (verse three onwards)?  

  

Thanks, Nityananda
