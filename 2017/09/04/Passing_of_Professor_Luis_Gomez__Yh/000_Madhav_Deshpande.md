Dear Colleagues,

  

  It is my sad duty to inform you that my colleague and a long time dear friend Professor Luis Gomez passed away yesterday in Mexico City.
He was a leading scholar of Buddhist Studies and a wonderful teacher.
He and I read many Sanskrit Buddhist texts together, and shared in common dozens of students at the University of Michigan. His memories will always be alive with me.

 

Madhav Deshpande
