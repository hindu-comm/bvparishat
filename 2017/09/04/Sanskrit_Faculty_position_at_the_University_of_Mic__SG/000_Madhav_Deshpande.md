Dear Colleagues,

  

  Please take a look at the attached advertisement for a tenured/tenuretrack faculty position in Sanskrit at the University of Michigan, and share it with all interested individuals. Since I have retired from the University of Michigan recently, no correspondence regarding this position should be sent to me personally.

  With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
