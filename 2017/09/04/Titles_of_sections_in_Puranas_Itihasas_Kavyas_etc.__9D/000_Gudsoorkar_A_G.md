Dear Scholars,  
During our studies of ancient and even later Sanskrit Poetic Literature, we come across variety of terms used for the "sections" of the Treatise(ग्रंथ) viz काण्ड(in Ramayana), पर्व(in Mahabharata), स्कंध(in Bhagavatam), मयूख(in Chandralok), सर्ग, अध्याय(common) and many others.  
  
Do we have any write-up or essay discussing the rules/guidelines for correctly naming the section/division of the Treatise(ग्रंथ)? And also listing the variety of such terms.  
  
The Discussion or Guidance of scholars will be very useful for the novices. Regards.
