Respected Shri Venkata Sriram and nkswaran,

  

Many thanks for your links on Saptasati Bhashya and other texts, I have downloaded the recomended books and will surely enjoy reading those.

  

Earlier I had read Bhavopnishad of Shri Bhaskararya but could not relate few things with Durga Saptashati. Hopefuly, the things will be clear after reading the recomended text.

  

With warm regards,
