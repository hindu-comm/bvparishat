haTha, maTha and shaTha are all words in most Indian languages, even in Hindi.

  

My question and contention is, does the Tha (ठ) mean the same in all these words?

  

While some acronym like words are indeed there, like mantra = mananam trAyate makes sense, but if we go after this acronym kind of explanation of every word, then it doesn't sound correct.

Unless it follows the rules of forming new words, adjectives and nouns from verbs, that makes sense.

मुञ्च -> मुक्त

युज् -> युक्त

These have defined rules being followed.

  

It would be wrong to say that (for example):

yukta = yajate, kAmyate, tat (purely as an example).

  

So, pending question from my side:

When (and how) can we know when a word is indeed an abbreviation (like an acronym, mantra = mananam trAyate) and when it is not based on individual letters.

  

Some say that हृदय = harati, dadAti, yAti = takes, gives, moves (blood).

Would this be a correct break up of the formation of hRidaya?

  

It is not very difficult to imagine, in an age when surgery was there, and war (thus killing), that people saw the heart pumping blood (of a wounded or killed soldier).

  

But, in this case, do we know (or any indication) how old is the word? And how words were formed in pre-Panini times.

Since Panini described (and not prescribed) the language of his time, words and verb formation rules were already there as guidelines if not as hard rules.

  

Sorry if there are too many questions here.

All genuine queries.

  

Dhanyavad,

Shashi
