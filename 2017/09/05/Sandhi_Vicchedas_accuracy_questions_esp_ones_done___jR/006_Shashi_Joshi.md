Is hatha formed from ha = sun, tha =moon in the first place?

Or is it a later extra explanation?

  

For example, we see things like, what is a friend

Fun

Real

Interesting

Empathetic

Dear

  

(I just used an example)

  

Can **any** sanskrit word be made an acronym?

  

If ga of jagat is gamyate, is it also for ga of gaNesha? And garbha, and garva?

  

I have read the guru = remover of darkness as a etymological construct,and I don't find any other word with same break up.

  

Yes guru removes darkness, but does the word originally and literally means that or means one heavy with knowledge?  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
