Namaste

  

The issue here is referring to the way the term ' Ha-Tha' is explained under the Yoga context.

  

Abhayankar is right in the observation \< हठयोग-शब्दे ह-इति सूर्यः ठ-इति चन्द्रः इति विश्लेषणं संधि-विच्छेदः न \| एतत्तु शब्दार्थ-विश्लेषणम् \|> . The approach is called ' Artha - {Nirukta- Nirukti - Nirvachana} for 'Taatparya - Vyaakhyana} ' approach.  

  
1. Sandhi-Viccheda is NOT the only way or even the primary way of getting at the total communication embedded /understood from a 'Samskruth Word' in tradition.

  

2. The traditional texts provide a ' perspective' from using the 'Pada-Vakya- Pramana' paddhati (a pat of Yoga-Samskrutham pedagogy) to understand the given term (Pada) as a part of sentence (Vakya) to project a communication (Artha).

  

3. In this context, the speaker seems to be presenting the explanation of the term 'Ha-Tha' in the context of ' Yoga interview in English for a non-traditional audience and viewership, presented through a media'.

  

4\. This discussions on 'Yoga -Feminism' is NOT using the 'Sandhi Viccheda' approach. The approach used is called the 'Yoga-Samskrutham way of explaining the 'Varna-akshara- Prateeka/ Pratimaa/Symbolsim :: What sound stands for what concept communication in a given context'.
You can see the use this in the use of the words -- 'fundamental dimensions .. symbolism ....perspective'..' The prerogative to draw the line is not a privilege loaded for favoring one sided thinking'.

  

5. When

  

\(a\) an analyst misses the essence and essentials of capturing the meaning of 'Samskruth terms used in sentences texts with context',  
  
(b) analyst -translator- critic -debater breaks the 'Word - Integrity-circle' (Padatva of Samskrutha Shabda, guided by the rule 'Sub-Ting antam padam': from Panini and 'Arthavt padam' from Pratishakhyam ; and 'Vak- me - manasi- pratishthitam- from Vedas)'

  
and

  

\(c\) dont know / dont care for the 'Artha-Saamarthya-Prakriyaa / Yoga-Vrutti- Prakriyvaa' way to get back the 'Knowledge- Total Meaning Circle' - from the broken parts.

  

Then

  

' Samskruth Term will not reveal its internal beauty and secrets' ( Patanjali invokes a quote from Veda to endorse this position: vivrunute tanoom svaam').

  
 This Total cyclic process of 'Creation of segments from Circle (Srushti),Sustaining (Sthiti- Gati) and getting back to Circle from parts (Taatparya Nirnaya)' is guided integrally by six unified disciplines 'Vedanga paddhati'.

  

There is lot more to contemplateand need tocorrect thedamage done to Samskruth studies.
