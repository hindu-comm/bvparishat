Pranams to All Agrajas and to all Respected Learned members,  
  
I come across such vicchedas and quite often am unsure if it was done accurately or done ONLY for effect on the crowd and some front row adulation. In this context three questions come to me  
  
1). Is this viccheda or this meaning correct ?  
2). Where can I find more about this word **esp its viccheda?  
**3.) Where can read more of this aspect of words? I know amarkosha might tell me words but will it tell me the roots and the **viccheda**more? Orshould I ask on this forum always to learn ?  
  
The third question is usually an ongoing underlying common question for all such words.  
  
The current word I was looking at was Hatha from Hatha yoga. Can Hatha be : Ha = Sun and Tha = moon ? Is this meaning accurate? Please throw some light on it. (This was said by Sadguru in one of his videos - at time 2:00:45 --<https://youtu.be/65Q1EbsKRnY?t=7249>)
