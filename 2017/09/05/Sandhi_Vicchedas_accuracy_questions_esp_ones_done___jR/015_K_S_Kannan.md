A proper example of an acronym in Sanskrit would be the "derivation" of the word *avadhUta*,

said to be derived by joining the first letters of four words.

  

Acronyms are rather few in Sanskrit: the time-honoured ones are taken as acceptable.

There is no practice of creating new ones as per one's whims.
