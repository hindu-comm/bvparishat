Vritti has multiple meanings. While short commentary, or more precisely a sentence which expands a sutra supplying the missing words, is one definition, the word has a technical sense in grammar: complex formation (as it has a technical sense in other Sastras like Natyasastra).

  

The distinguishing feature of vritti is that a sense other that of the components alone is conveyed. Technically there are four or five vrittis in grammar - namely by addition of krit affixes or primary nominal affixes (which are added to roots resulting in substantives), taddhita or secondary affixes (which are added to substantives to form different substantives), sanaadi affixes or derivative verbal affixes (which are added to roots to formed derived roots like frequentatives, desideratives etc.) and formation of compound words (samaasas). There is a fifth vritti called ekaSesha vritti, but some consider it as a part of Samaasavritti.

  

Within Vyakarana, these vrittis are a fascinating subject and show why Vyakarana is much more than "grammar". In fact the principles delineated in this section of Vyakarana are used in linguistics in sentence analysis and discourse analysis.
