Dear Friends/ Researchers,



I edited the Gajashastram of Palakapya,with a Sanskrit Commentary,English Paraphrase and nearly 150 or so black and white sketches. It was published by the Bharatiya Kala Prakashan,Delhi,in early 2000. The Introduction and Bibliography of the book give a fund of information about other books-like Matangaleela etc-on the Gajashastra.

  

Moreover,the interested persons may refer to some chapters on Gaja and Ashva in the Manasollasa alias Abhilashitarthachintamani of Someshvara,in addition to the Hariharachaturanga..



Presently,am editing the Ashvashastra of Shalihotra,with a Sanskrit Commentary,English Paraphrase and some black and white sketches,along with an Introduction.

  

Both these Sanskrit Commentaries -in the form of unpublished manuscripts-on the Gajashastra and Ashvashastra are my new finds,as they are not mentioned anywhere in any Catalogue of Mss. or books on History of Skt. Lit.

  

Though no independent work on Goshastra is available,there are chapters in other Sanskrit Texts,dealing with that topic.

  

For details,the scholars are requested to read/refer to my Keynote Address,delivered in September 2014 in the National Seminar on "Mrugapakshishastra",organised by the University of Mumbai. The papers presented in it were later on edited and published by Dr. Gauri Mahulikar.

  

The Sarasvati Mahal Library,Thanjavur,has recently reprinted their earlier editions of Gajashastram and Ashvashastram.



One Dr. Joshi from Tirupati has edited one Ashvashastra Ms. and it is published from some Sanskrit University in Jaipur.I just now do not have it at hand for furnishing publication details.

  

Hope,the interested will be benefited by this piece of information.

  

Best luck.
