Gosastra, a tale:

We know that Asvasastra was first written by (Pandava) Nakula and Sahadeva authored Gosastra. In an ethnoveterinary conference, we found that Gosastrawas not available. However, we started searching for it. After going all over, we found a version of it in Orissa state library- but highly damaged. Fewscholarsopine that more are available.  

We also have a version in Telugu titled, "Sahadeva Gosastra".

  

Can someone translate it for us? Or, is there any more information/version about Gosastra that others know of?
