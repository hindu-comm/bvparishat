With regards  

पालकाप्य (PAlakApya) a text of treatment of elephants was published as Anandasrama Ser. 26. 1894. Apart from this there is text named HariharacaturaNga by GodAvara MiSra of Odisha of C. 14th Cent. deals with the two chs on Elephant and on Horse. This is text on war science and was published by Government Ori. Library, Madras in 1950. A critical edition is to be done as many texts are available in Odisha with some additions.  

There are many mss. available in the Oriental libraries as गृहचिकित्सा where the treatment for the cows also availble. Have to explore.  

One book named अश्वचिकित्सा in Malayalam was published by University of Kerala in 1962. It may give you some information.  

The New Catalogus Catalogorum in its vol 34 gives some information under शालिहोत्र also.  

But yes, there is no specific text on the treatment of cows alone, but in Odisha State Museum, there are 6 mss. which deal with the treatment of Cows, but in odiya language with some Sanskrit verses here and there.
