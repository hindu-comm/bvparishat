Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

Gradually these studies developed into more complex Indo-European family studies. There is a lot published. But the writing style demands a background in Historical Linguistics.

  

If you are looking for a specific issue from these sources, please share the question.

  

We luckily have stalwarts on the list. You will get the guidance.
