Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

The feature of Sanskrit that you are trying to discuss is technically called inflection. Please go through<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection>

  

Sanskrit is a fusional language. Please go through<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language>

  

The other contrasting feature you are trying to discuss as 'mechanically suffixed.' is called agglutination. Please go through <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination>

  

  

South Indian languages are agglutinative languages. Please go through<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language>  

  

You were enquiring 'Are they mechanically suffixed or does the word and the suffix need to undergo modification as is the case with Sanskrit? '

  

That means you want to know whether Greek is fusional or agglutinative.

  

You have the answer in<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language>
