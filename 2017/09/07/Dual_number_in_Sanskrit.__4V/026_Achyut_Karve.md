Dear Madhav Deshpandeji,

I greatly value your comments on the subject. However we cannot forget/overlook the fact that Sanskrit was a language of शिष्ट.  
This means a lot to me.  
I have been associated with the Tabla for long. It's literature which evolved through a parampara of a select community (शष्ट) has thrown up unique modes of recitation. A study of which have been presented in my book 'Unveiling the Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology'. The same is true of Indian classical Music which has evolved from various vedic traditions. Nowhere in the world one sees something similar to our classical music. Music the world over is rendered in tempered scale which has evolved through mathematical computation. Indian Music has evolved through speech and hence the evolution of ragas which are unique to Indian classical music.

It is this study that is giving me the impetus to dig more and more on account of, if I may say, a seeming parallel between the two.

Sanskrit if I am not mistaken did not evolve as a mother tongue of a people. It appears to have evolved for a specific as well as special purpose. As a result not only did its literature (here purpose) evolve but together with it its rules popularly called grammar.

To put such a language as Sanskrit side by side with languages which evolved from spoken tongues is to me unjust if not criminal.

Be as it may I feel highly obliged by the support you as well as your colleagues are rendering in this endeavour of mine.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
