Dear Madhav Deshpandeji,

Thanks for your comment. I will go through the commentary on the three vartikas in greater detail and come back.

As far as comparative study of sanskrit and greek is concerned I would be happy to understand what you meant by 'broader context'?

The theme of this thread is dual number. The presence of dual number in a language increases the number of suffixes one and a half times that if the language only had singular and plural.

I have been made to know that there are only 21 possible suffixes for nouns and pronouns and 27 for verbs. (Kindly correct me if I am wrong) What I was figuring out in Ancient Greek was the nature of suffixes, the way they are suffixed and their number. Are they mechanically suffixed or does the word and the suffix need to undergo modification as is the case with Sanskrit?

To my knowledge in Indian regional languages they are mechanically suffixed.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
