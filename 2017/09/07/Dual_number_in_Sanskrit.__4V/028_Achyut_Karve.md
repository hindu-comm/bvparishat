Dear Paturiji,

I while reading the first anhik of the Mahabhashya interpreted the following reference differently.

(He says, one goes to a potter requesting him to make a pot so that one may use it; but one does not go to a grammarian with the request to make new words so that one may use them. )

Though words are used to express meaning without fore thought yet it is grammar that seives these words and determines which are those that are capable of conveying meaning. Thus apart from one conveying meaning it also results in one's upliftment. Patanjali also opines that grammar defines rules only for words (शब्द ) and not of non words (अपशब्द).
Thus Sanskrit Grammar does not talk of rules for a particular language but general rules applicable for language in general because it deals with words. The first sentence of Mahabhashya reads अथ शब्दानुशासनम्
and not अथ संस्कृत शब्दनुशासनम्. Thus grammars other than Sanskrit may be said to be grammars of non words.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
