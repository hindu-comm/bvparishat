Which Indian formal language shares this characteristic of dual number in noun, pronoun and verb forms?  

  

I do not know what a formal language means.

  

No other Indian language , to my knowledge , has dual number.

  

Was that just a jijnaasaa, or you want to make a point out of this?

  

If you want to make a point, please go ahead.
