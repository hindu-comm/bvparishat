\>How did the Greeks derive the singular dual and plural forms of nouns pronouns verbs and adjectives for different word/root endings.

  

--------------It is viewed in this case as the retaining a certain feature of the Proto-Indo-European by some of its members while the remaining members of the IE family lost it.

  

\>Sanskrit has an elaborate system of grammar to achieve this. Did the Greeks also have it?

  

--------------The wisdom that grammar does not produce language/words , it only analyses the language/words was expressed , way back by Ptanjali in his Mahabhashya. (He says, one goes to a potter requesting him to make a pot so that one may use it; but one does not go to a grammarian with the request to make new words so that one may use them. ) So Sanskrit did not achieve dual number through its elaborate system of grammar. Its elaborate system of grammar analysed the dual number which was already there in the language. Similarly Greeks do not need any grammar book to 'achieve' their dual number. Dual number existed in their language just as it existed in Sanskrit. It is a different thing that they had a grammar of their language. That was called *techne grammatike (*The art of writing) . That book is attributed to Dionysius Thrax.

  

\>Did prakrits like ardhamagadhi and Pali also retain the dual number of Sanskrit?  

  

--------------Pali lost the dual number. It is understood as a result of change of au into o.

  

\>Can losing the dual form be interpreted as a process of simplification of language?  

  

--------------It could be seen as change of the cultural cognition.
