Dear Shri Karve,

  

  Please take a look at this webpage:

  

<https://www.quora.com/Are-there-languages-other-than-Sanskrit-which-in-addition-to-the-singular-and-plural-have-a-dual-number>  

  

The author's initial paragraph is important:

  

"Far from being unique among languages in expressing a grammatical dual, Sanskrit is merely**one among probably hundreds of languages that has some sort of special form (whether productive or not) to express two of something**. I quickly put together a custom*World Atlas of Language Structures*map with the available data showing the geographic distribution of languages with duals."
