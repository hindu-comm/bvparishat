Dear Paturiji,

Subsequent thought has cleared my understanding.

राम: राम: च रामौ  
And  
राम: रामौ च रामा:

Thus राम: रामौ रामा: form a Samhita like Word assembly. If the dual number is removed राम: रामा: do not retain the Samhita form.

However Sanskrit has dual forms for each of the seven cases of nouns and pronouns as well as dual number for verbs in all the persons.

Which other Indo-European language shares this characteristic?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
