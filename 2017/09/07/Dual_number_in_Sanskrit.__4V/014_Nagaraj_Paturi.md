\>However Sanskrit has dual forms for each of the seven cases of nouns and pronouns as well as dual number for verbs in all the persons.

\>Which other Indo-European language shares this characteristic?

  

---- I shared a link to a thread on another forum where a similar question was discussed.

Did you go through the [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/samskrita/asYMQx4IzAE/A0H6kuvPG0cJ)?

The very second post , i.e., the very first reply there was by Sri Vishnu Shaastrii-ji. It is as follows:

> Dear Ramakrishnan, >
> Yes, Classical (ancient) Greek has singular, dual and plural forms for > nouns, adjectives and verbs. For example, the word for “man” is > anthropos (ἄνθρωπος) and its nominative case forms in all three > numbers are: >
> ἄνθρωπος ἀνθρώπω ἄνθρωποι >
> The first person singular, dual and plural number, present tense, > active voice, indicative mood forms for the verb “educate” paideuo > (παιδεύω) are: >
> παιδεύω παιδεύετον παιδεύομεν >
> In a more modern time frame (approximately between 800 – 1200 AD) Old > English had a dual number for nouns but not for verbs! We see those > dual forms in “Beowulf” and other Old English literature. >
> विष्णुः

In the same thread, Sri Vardhan-ji pointed to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_%28grammatical_number%29>

  

Again,

  

Was that just a jijnaasaa, or you want to make a point out of this?

  

If you want to make a point, please go ahead.
