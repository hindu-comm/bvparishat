Dear Paturiji,

How did the Greeks derive the singular dual and plural forms of nouns pronouns verbs and adjectives for different word/root endings.

Sanskrit has an elaborate system of grammar to achieve this. Did the Greeks also have it?

Formal Indian languages mean modern written Indian regional languages.

Did prakrits like ardhamagadhi and Pali also retain the dual number of Sanskrit?

Can losing the dual form be interpreted as a process of simplification of language?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
