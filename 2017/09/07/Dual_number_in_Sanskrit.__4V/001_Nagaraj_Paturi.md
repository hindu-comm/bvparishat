Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

Most of us here have a clarity in this regard.

  

We have our answers for these questions.

  

Before we set out to respond,

  

-you mentioned in one of your recent mails that you are currently studying Sanskrit with a guru.

  

Did you put these questions to him?

  

What were his answers?

  

Did you ponder over these? If yes, what are your thoughts?

  

If you have no prior thoughts either from your teacher or from yourself, please let us know that.

  

We can start conversing based on this foundation.
