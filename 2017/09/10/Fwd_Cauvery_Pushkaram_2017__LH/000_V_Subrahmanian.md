Namaste

  

Here is a request from my friend:

  

You must be aware of the Cauvery Pushkarani starting from the 12th of Sep for a fortnight. We want to find out more about the authentic elucidation for the 144 year cycle of this observance, (not just the 12X12 cycle) has anything been recorded in history about it or the previous one back in 1873 etc.

  

Am sure someone could have done some research on this too!

  

  

Thanks and warm regards,
