Namaste Vidwans,

  

Are there any records / manuscripts maintained about the Srimad Ramayana Kalakshepam that took place between Periya Tirumala Nambi and Bhagavad Ramanuja at Tirupati foothills ?

  

What went on and has the goshti between them is preserved in the form a book ? It is told that Ramanuja was taught the secrets of Ramayana 18 times by his maternal uncle and guru Periya Tirumala Nambi. What does the vaishNava samparadaya say about this?

  

regs,

Sriram
