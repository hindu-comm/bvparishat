Dear kind VidvƒÅns,

  
May I request your help in finding a book that has gone out of print and is no longer available from the publisher? Perhaps one of you has a copy of it that you no longer need, and would be willing to sell to me. It is part 1 of Sthanangasutra, with the commentary by Acarya Sri Abhayadev-Suri Maharaja, critically edited by Muni Jambuvijaya. It was published in 2003 by the Shri Mahavira Jaina Vidyalaya, Bombay/Mumbai, in the Jaina-Agama-Series as volume 19, part 1. I already have parts 2 and 3 of this text, and would very much like to complete my set.  

  

Nowadays requests for PDFs of books are frequent on this list, so I hope that you will not mind if I request a physical book here. I have already checked with major booksellers in Delhi and Mumbai (Biblia Impex, Motilal Banarsidass, Hindi Granth Karyalay, Chetana Book Centre), and they do not have it. Any help in finding a copy of this book to purchase would be be much appreciated.  

  

Best regards,
