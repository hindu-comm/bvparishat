By saying that many gaushalas do not have these conditions does not in any way answer the many issues raised by this author. Let us not wish away these conditions which prevail in the gaushalas. The best way forward is to rectify the many shortfalls pointed out by the author and match our reverence for the cow by treating them in a humane manner. One could perhaps start a petition on those lines for instance and forward it to the Minister concerned. We can all work towards the improvement of the condition of the gaushalas which will be the positive result that will result from reading this article.
