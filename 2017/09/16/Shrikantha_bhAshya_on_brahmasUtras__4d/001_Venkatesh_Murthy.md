Namaste

  

Interesting numbers 20,21 and 22. I heard from one Madhva there were 21 commentaries on Brahma Sutras before Madhvaand in them Sankara Bhashya is 20th and Ramanuja's is 21st. He explained in Sankara's Advaita the whole world of Dvaita is Mithyaa and becomes Zero. Therefore 2 goes to 0 = 20. Therefore Sankara Bhashya is 20th. In Ramanuja's Visistadvaita the whole world of Dvaita 2 becomes One with Sriman Narayana. It is like 2 goes to 1. Therefore Ramanuja's commentary is 21st. In Madhva's Dvaita system the whole world of Dvaita 2 remains Dvaita even in Moksha. It can never become One with Sriman Narayana. It is always separate. 2 remains 2. Therefore Madhva commentary is 22nd.
