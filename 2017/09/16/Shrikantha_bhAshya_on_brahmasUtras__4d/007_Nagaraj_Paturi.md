In his commentary, Shrikantha transferred the Shaiva philosophy in a Vedantic terminology. Shrikantha lived in the XI-th century, our era. We know almost nothing about his personal life, so this aspect will remain a mystery forever.

There is a Srikantha here too:

Siddhas such as Sadyojyoti (ca seventh century^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaiva_Siddhanta#cite_note-13))) are credited with the systematization of the Siddhanta theology in Sanskrit. Sadyojyoti, initiated by the guru[Ugrajyoti](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ugrajyoti&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ugrajyoti (page does not exist)"), propounded the Siddhanta philosophical views as found in the*Rauravatantra*and*Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṅgraha.*He may or may not have been from Kashmir, but the next thinkers whose works survive were those of a Kashmirian lineage active in the tenth century: Rāmakaṇṭha I, Vidyākaṇṭha I, ***Śrīkaṇṭha,*** Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha, Rāmakaṇṭha II, Vidyākaṇṭha II. Treatises by the last four of these survive. King[Bhoja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhoja "Bhoja")of Gujarat (ca 1018) condensed the massive body of Siddhanta scriptural texts into one concise metaphysical treatise called the*Tattvaprakāśa*.
