Namaste,  
  
I am reading a book by Dr BNK Sharma- "Brahmasutras and their principal commentaries". Dr Sharma says that the names of 21 pre-Madhva commentators on the brahmasutras have been recorded by Narayana Panditacharya, who was the biographer of Madhva. Interestingly Shrikantha's name does not appear in the list of these commentaries. When did Shrikantha write his commentary on the sutras? What is the earliest existing reference to his commentary?  
  
Thanks  
Kalyan
