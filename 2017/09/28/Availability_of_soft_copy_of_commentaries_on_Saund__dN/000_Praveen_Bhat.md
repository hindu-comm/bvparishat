Namaste all,

  

Currently I am referring to Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan book Saundaryalahari (with commentaries in Sanskrit) which has ten commentaries. Since I have borrowed it from someone and need to return it in couple of days, would anyone know if a soft copy is available online? I couldn't find the same in [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

Would someone also guide me if all Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan books can be bought online?

  

Thanks,

--Praveen Bhat
