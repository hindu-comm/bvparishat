Namaḥ sarvebhyaḥ

I was reading a Sanskrit story book on [storyweaver](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/SKT/sktgraph?lex=SH&st=t&us=f&cp=t&text=pratIkSethAm&t=KH&topic=&mode=g&corpmode=&corpdir=&sentno=) and came across a word pratīkṣethām. I was looking up for the lakāra on [Sanskrit Reader Companion](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/cgi-bin/SKT/sktgraph?lex=SH&st=t&us=f&cp=t&text=pratIkSethAm&t=KH&topic=&mode=g&corpmode=&corpdir=&sentno=) that mātā Ambā Kulakarṇī shared with me some time back. It says the “**imp. \[1\] md. du. 2**”.

There is an abbreviation document [here](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/abrevs.pdf) but it is in French! While I could decipher some of them such as imp. = imperative and du.=dual, I find it difficult on some of the abbreviations. In general, what is the best way to understand these? Specifically, in the case of the word in question, what does **md.** mean? I thought it may be causative (ṇic) but there is another abbreviation ca. that seems to be the right one for causative.

Dhanyavādaḥ
