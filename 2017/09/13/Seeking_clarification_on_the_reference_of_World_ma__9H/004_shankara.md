Namaste,

  

Nilakantha's commentary on Mahabharata interprets pippala and Sasa from the standpoint of Vedanta. Whereas, Devabodha in his commentary on Bhishmaparva interprets pippala as the shape of a dvipa. I could not understand him completely as his commentary is too terse.  

  

Attaching relevant pages extracted from Mahabharata commentaries of Nilakantha & Devabodha.

  

regards  
shankara
