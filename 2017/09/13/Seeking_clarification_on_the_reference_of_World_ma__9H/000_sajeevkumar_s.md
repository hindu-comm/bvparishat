Pranams to the list

I have recently come across the following information. May I request the scholars to kindly enlighten me on this.

//The first ever world map was sketched thousands of years ago by the Indian saint

Ramanujacharya, who simply translated the following verse from Mahabharata and gave

the world its real face.//

  

सुदर्शनं प्रवक्ष्यामि द्वीपं तु कुरुनन्दन।  
परिमण्डलो महाराज द्वीपोऽसौ चक्रसंस्थितः॥  
यथा हि पुरुषः पश्येदादर्शे मुखमात्मनः।  
एवं सुदर्शनद्वीपो दृश्यते चन्द्रमण्डले॥  
द्विरंशे पिप्पलस्तत्र द्विरंशे च शशो महान्।
