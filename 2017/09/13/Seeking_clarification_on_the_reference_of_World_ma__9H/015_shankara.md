Sriniji,

  

I had a glance at 'Bhugolanirnaya', it has only 7 verses or paras. I could not find in it any mention about Sudarsanadvipa, pippala, or Sasa mentioned in the Mahabharata verse.

  

Bhugolanirnaya of Vedantadesika is available at the following link, towards the end of the volume.

regards  
shankara
