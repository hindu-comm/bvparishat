I never said that Ramanuja drew this or something like this. But someone took the clue from the verse and drew the world map in such a way that it could indeed be represented by the figures of rabbit and peepal leaves.

  

Coming to the hump on the rabbit, yes, the imagery in the verse is not the perfect one. It was just a near similarity.

  

For that matter, does the computer mouse has any similarity with the real mouse? But why was it named so? Imageres need not be that close to reality.
