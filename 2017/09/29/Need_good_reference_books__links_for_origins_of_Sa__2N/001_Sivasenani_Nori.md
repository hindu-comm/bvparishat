Sir

  

SanAtana means "that which is there always", that is without a beginning or end. This SanAtanadharma was taught to the present generation by the previous one, to the previous by the generation before them and so on. This Dharma transcends the present creation and no beginning is known. So, it would be appropriate to enquire about the details or foundations of Dharma, rather than the origins. If such indeed is your quest, the three sources given below might be useful to you.

The book, "[Hindu Dharma](https://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/)" by the Paramacharya of Kanchi, available on the website of Kanchipeetham (also available on Amazon.in) is a wonderful introduction to SanAtanadharma. This is a lucidly written book with a simplicity that a child can appreciate and depth that a profound scholar would find difficult to better.

Secondly, there is an Encyclopedia of Hinduism in six volumes that has been brought out by Ramakrishna Mission. I briefly browsed the contents of this and no more but the publisher has such a long history of high quality publications, that one can safely depend on it.

Finally my own guru Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam wrote articles on the Vedas and fourteen Vidyaasthaanas. These fourteen subjects encompass everything about Hinduism, except secular literature. Prof. Korada learnt Veda and Vyakarana from his father and Mimamsa, Nyaya and Jyotishafrom competent gurus. He learnt Ayurveda and other Sastras through a combination of self study and from elders, and incidentally. As such he is eminently qualified to introduce the 14 Vidyaasthaanas. All of these are hosted by Jijnaasa Foundation (<http://ancientindianwisdom.com/>- you need to search hard though, for Prof. Korada's articles there).

Whereas the first book (by Paramacharya) is intended to introduce SanAtanadharma to skeptical Hindus if I may say so; the second one seems to also have foreigners as the target audience; and the last source seems to assume that the reader has some prior knowledge and delves into the main texts freely and presents the key tenets without explicitly seeking simplicity: in short, it is a scholarly introduction.

Regards

N. Siva Senani
