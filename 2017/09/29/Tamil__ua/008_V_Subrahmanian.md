This is true. We can hear such mispronunciations in musical composition renderings by even famous musicians sometimes, while Veda is rendered by those who have not studied in a pathashala with Grantha lipi. Many mistakes can be noted when such people recite the Veda. I have heard, to my amusement, a Tamilian purohita saying: ममोपार्त्त... for ममोपात्त... This, of course, is not an error of the category discussed in this thread, but simply how one can make mistakes when the language is not known.
