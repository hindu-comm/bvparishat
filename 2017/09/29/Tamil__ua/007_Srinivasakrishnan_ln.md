\> The 'Tamil reader using just one symbol for four letters knows clearly how to distinguish 'गणेश गणपति  ' from '.कणेश कणपति .  

  

The short answer is he does not. He can not.  

  

As far as the text is in Tamil language, the sounds are unambiguously represented. Where sparśa sounds are concerned, Tamil permits only varga prathama sounds in word initial position and varga tritiya sounds in the medial and final positions. (Geminates are an exception to this of course).

  

But if someone unfamiliar with Sanskrit were to be given a stotra text in Tamil script, say, a namavali of Ganesa, his pronunciation would be all over the place. Some people rely on their ear to pronounce correctly. Some people make a pass thru the text before first use and annotate it with superscript characters (1,2,3,4) to distinguish the aspirated, voiced consonants from their unvoiced, unaspirated counterparts. Such annotated texts are even available in print in temples and such, for those who are unfamiliar with Devanagari.  

  

But most stotra pocketbooks (pothi) dont have such annotations so pronunciation would generally not be perfect. This is well known.  

  

Hope this helps,
