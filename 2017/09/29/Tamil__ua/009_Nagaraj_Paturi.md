ममोपार्त्त... for ममोपात्त kind of mistakes /blunders in pronunciation of mantras is found all over the country due to wrong training of purohits. I had to correct one of my purohits uttering navama navama for na mama , na mama; he was a Telugu speaking purohit; so the problem is not unique to or limited to Tamil speaking purohits.  

  

Mother tongue interference is found in the pronunciation of English or any non-mother-tongue language, not simply in the pronunciation of Sanskrit. This is a universal feature of language learning.

  

But good training helps correct pronunciation of mantras whether it is Tamil purohits or Malayali purohits or any other purohits. Just as mother tongue interference in English pronunciation is being reduced through phonetic training , mother tongue interference in Sanskrit pronunciation can be reduced through phonetic training. This is required for all purohits across the length and breadth of the country not just Tamil purohits.

  

There was a thread on priestly errors:
