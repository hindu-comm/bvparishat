-----------I mentioned in my earlier posts on the orthography related threads on this list, that the scripts of each language suits the phonemic system of that language, following the principle of minimal tools for maximum use.

  

It is a popular level misunderstanding, not based on a professional understanding of linguistics, phonology, orthography etc., to think that --- "this 'sound' (popular parlance for the technical 'phone')has no (script) symbol in this language. That is the weakness of this 'language' (keeping script in mind)" But most scripts have a symbol or a sequence/group of symbolsfor a phoneme of that language leaving all the allophones 'within' that phoneme to be represented by that symbol or a sequence/group of symbols. Classic example of that such a misunderstanding is thepopular impression (sometimes unfortunately among Tamilians themselves) that Tamil script having the same symbol for p and b or k and g etc. is its weakness. But the fact is that in Tamil phonology, p and b are not two different phonemes. They are allophones 'within' the same phoneme. i.e. Tamil speakers do not pronounce p in a certain position of a word (say, immediately after m ) and do not pronounce b in a certain position of a word (say, in the initial position of a word). They pronounce invariably p in the word-initial position and invariably b immediately after m .Sohaving the same symbol for p and b does not cause any difficulty to them. p and b are called(mutual)allophones. They together constitute a phoneme. One symbol for one phoneme (i.e. for both the allophones 'within' that phoneme ). Native speakers learnwhat to pronounce for which symbol naturally.
