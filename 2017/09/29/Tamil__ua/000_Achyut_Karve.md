Dear Scholars,

  

The 'Tamil reader using just one symbol for four letters knows clearly how to distinguish 'गणेश गणपति  ' from '.कणेश कणपति .  

It is well known that Tamil uses one script symbol for each of the five class of consonants viz., for क class, च class, ट class, तclass and प class. How is it then that Tamil readers still can easily read the word by using one of the five consonants including the nasals. Has anybody researched this unique method.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
