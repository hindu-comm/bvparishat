Thank you very much. I could find only this about त्रिष्टुभ in the suggested book:   
**कष्मात् त्रिष्टुप? त्रिभिर्वेदै:, कायवाङ्मनोभिर्वा स्तौति स्तोभते वा।**  
As I try, **काय, वाङ्, मन**, body, speech and mind, all praise with pause or with excess.  
If I am erring, please correct me. Why is त्रिष्टुभ considered so? What is so special in its structure that**काय, वाङ्, मन,**all the three are engaged?
