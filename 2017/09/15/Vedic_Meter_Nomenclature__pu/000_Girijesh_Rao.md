Naman to all here,

  

My question is regarding logic behind the nomenclature of the Vedic meters namely गायत्री, ऊष्णिह(क), अनुष्टुभ(प), बृहती, पंक्ति, त्रिष्टुभ(प), जगती.  
For example, if we take त्रिष्टुभ(प), it is 4x11 syallables. The name त्रि + ष्टुभ apparently does not relate to this mathematics.  
What is the reason for naming this meter so? Likewise others also should be explained.

  

Thank you all.

Girijesh
