the metric arrangement of the meters is not by accident, gayatri and anushtup use 8 syllables in a pada....jagati etc use 12 and trishtup etc 11

trishtup as a chandas is ruled by Indra and is the meter of choice for kshatriya worship just as gayatri is for brahmins, jagati is for vaishyas etc. The 11 syllables denote the 11 rudras.

The rudras are the deities of transformation.  

Transformation is only possible when all 3 manas, vAk and kAya combine and cooperate. My 2 cents.
