There is evidently some confusion regarding what I remarked. I did not indicate any personal preference for the ra-pratyāhāra argument, but merely pointed out Bhaṭṭoji's viewहकारादिषु अकार उच्चारणार्थ: । लण्मध्ये तु इत्संज्ञक:।, to show that traditionally not all uccāraṇārtha elements were treated as "its". One need not agree with Bhaṭṭoji's views, but that shows that Professor Devasthali's position that all such elements are "its" is a more recent position. Whether Bhaṭṭoji is right or Devasthali is right depends upon one's subjective understanding of the anunāsika pronunciation of all or only some of these elements. The actual anunāsika pāṭha was already lost before Kātyāyana and Patañjali, and hence the maximप्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्या: पाणिनीया: arose.
