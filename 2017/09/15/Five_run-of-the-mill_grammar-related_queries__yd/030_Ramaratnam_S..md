It is a very interesting discussion and we must thank all the scholars for participating in it. The purpose being a part of byparishat is amply rewarded. We must be proud to have such scholars as Dr. Madhav Deshpande and Dr. Saroja Bhate among us. It is gratifying to note that they are able to find time to share their views with us. It will be very useful if somebody/organization comes forward to bring out a booklet consolidating the views of these scholars on such discussions.  

  

with regards,

Dr.S. Ramaratnam,

Vice Chancellor,

Jagadguru Kripalu University,

Odisha.
