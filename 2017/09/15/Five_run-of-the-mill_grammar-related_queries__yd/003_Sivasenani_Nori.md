Namaste

  

We usually start with हरिः ओम् श्रीमहागणाधिपतये नमः। Here Hari and Om are independent words.

  

Similarly it is श्रीगुरुभ्यो नमः, SrIguru being the word. Whenever SrI is appended we are doing a compound श्रीमान् च असौ गुरुः। Writing them separately is indeed seen but that shoukd be understood as a way of writing and no more. There could be other peculiarities in writing. For instance many old manuscripts start with श्रीगणेशायनमः without space between the first two words. Whatever be the writing convention, while reading we do not observe gap between Sri and gaNapati.

  

The same extends to writing in Roman, including names. For instance Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi ought to be Indirapriyadarshini (and Nitish Kumar, Nitishkumar) but we observe the gap. This needs to be seen as a writing convention and not an exact representation of the spoken word. It must be borne in mind that language is always what is spoken. Writing is only a representation of the spoken word, but not language itself. My approach had been to be careful - at least while writing in Devanagari - myself, but to look at forms with gaps as conventional, and not "wrong". For instance, introducing gaps in the long samaasas (the ones with abhangaSlesha) of Sanskrit prose works is actually very useful.

  

झभञ् does not undergo any change. The marker, ञ् has to be pronounced like "n" in "lunch" or पञ्च. This is often pronounced / heard as य्ँ but that is not correct. There is a perceptible difference in pronunciation of ऋ, ञ, (and conjuncys like ज्ञ), श, ष, and स in different parts of India today. Further there are regional variations: va \> ba in the East, la \> La in South-central, ta \> la in Kerala, ya \> ja in certain parts, ra/la and ra/Da in certain parts and so on and further sub-regional variations. For example, in Guntur of AP there is a tendency to replace "dhya" with "jja" (sanjja, majja etc.). However Sikshaa is clear about the pronunciation of each of these and the regional or sub-regional variations do not change the correct forms.
