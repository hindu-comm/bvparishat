Dear Rakshitji,

  

  You have given a proper account of the difference of opinion on this subject. Professor Devasthali was one of my teachers at the University of Pune. While I respect his opinion, there is a constant disputation on this subject. For instance, the Siddhānta-Kaumudī says: हकारादिषु अकार उच्चारणार्थ: । लण्मध्ये तु इत्संज्ञक: । The "a" in the ŚS लण् alone is treated to be an इत् by Bhaṭṭoji, as he wants to achieve the र-प्रत्याहार, using the rule आदिरन्त्येन सहेता. Where such a purpose is not intended, the uccāraṇārtha sounds were not treated as "its". The case of the "ra-pratyāhāra" itself is a hotly debated topic, and its necessity is denied by several scholars within the tradition composing works like र-प्रत्याहार-खण्डन. The anunāsikatva of such elements is not a given fact, since even Patañjali did not have a version of the Aṣṭādhyāyī with clearly marked accents and anunāsikas, but an assumption based on whether it is useful. This is what gave rise to the maxims प्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्या: पाणिनीया: and प्रतिज्ञास्वरिता: पाणिनीया:. Such maxims allowed the commentators to make convenient assumptions useful for particular conceptions like the र-प्रत्याहार.
