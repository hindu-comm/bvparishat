A quick reaction to Dr. Deshpande's mail. Nagesha is technically right. We need some mechanism to discard the phonemes not wanted in derivative prakriya. Itsamjna is the only way to discard such phonemes. even the socalled"ucchaaranaartha" phonemes need to be discarded if we want to strictly apply Panininian procedure. It is not enough to say they are "ucchaaranaartha" The rule Upadeshe ajanunaasika...serves this purpose for all such vowels. Moreover itsamjna of u in ru is required to distinguish it from r. Thus in the expression " praataratra (praatar-atra) the rule ato roraplutaadaplute ati does not apply. because we have r and not ru in praatar..Otherwise it would have been praatoStra (here, S stands for avagraha) ".Commentators also have accepted itsamjna for u in ru
