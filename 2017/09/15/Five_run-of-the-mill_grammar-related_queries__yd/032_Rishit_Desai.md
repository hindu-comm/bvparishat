May I further add a line from BhaimiVyakhya Vol1. p. 136 u/s 8.3.28 \[Hindi transliterated\] 'ukāra uccāraṇaartha hai. prayojanābhāva se it saṃjNa nahi hoti' (The ukāra is an uccāraṇaartha, Due to the fact that it has no use it cannot be designated an 'it'.)

  

I, for the sake of logic and clarity prefer Prof. Devasthali's views. Dr. Bhate, thanks for your acknowledgement. Personally I disagree with Bhattoji's interpretation of both "aloSntyasya" and "yasyeti ca". I prefer the Kāśikā for the former and S.C.Vasu's translation of the latter. When we do this, the need for the pratiṣedha-Vārttikas on both these sūtras is eliminated.  

  

Dr. Deshpande, am grateful for responding to us learners. Your book "The theory of Homogeneity" is enlightening and I have learnt a lot from it. There are several gems of wisdom in it and my personal favorite is your use of the words 'Homogeneous' and 'Homorganic' to explain Pāṇini's inclusive sāvarṇya.

  

Am privileged to be on this forum.
