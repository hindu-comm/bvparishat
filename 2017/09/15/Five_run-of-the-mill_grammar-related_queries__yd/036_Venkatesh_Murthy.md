Namaste

  

I am very thankful to BVP scholars for the depth of Vyakarana knowledge. It will be nice if we get the same depth in Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta. But in these fields there is a chance of going into long arguments and philosophical hair splitting. Probably they are not coming out and discussing these fields for this reason.
