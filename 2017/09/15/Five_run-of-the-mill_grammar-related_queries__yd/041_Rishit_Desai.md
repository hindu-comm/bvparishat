Respected Shivakumariji,

There are two opinions building up; (1) mukhasukhārtha=anubhandha and (2) mukhasukhārtha ≠ anubandha.

The reason I quoted that line from Bhaimivyakhya is twofold:

First, to state the counter point of view in this argument; i.e. view no. 2 since that is how most commentators comment. It is Nāgeśa who leads us in our discussion of view no. 1. Second and more importantly, this line from Bhaimi draws forth the main substratum of this differentiation; i.e. when there is a prayojana it is an ‘it’; otherwise not.

Now to refer to your point of there being the symbolic anunāsikatva (candrabindu) in the Bhaimi. This cannot be the basis of the undergoing discussion. First, because these symbolic representations have only been started by BhimsenShastriji (and is now being followed in many new publications) for ease of students and will not be seen in any Manuscripts. (Scholars may judge the veracity of my statement). Second and more importantly, the logic that the chandrabindu points to an “it” entails the posthoc fallacy (post hoc ergo propter hoc). Third, you may also refer to Bhamivyakhya Vol. 1 p. 127 u/s 1.1.45 where Bhimsenshastriji admits (in the footnote) that although he has depicted the /u/ of ‘kuk’ and ‘ṭuk’ with the chandrabindu, “dhyāna rahe ki kuch vaiyākaraṇa yahan ukākara ādi ko uccāraṇārthaka mānate hue prayojanābhāva ke kāraṇa ina ki itsamjnā nahin karte. Parantu anya vaiyākaraṇon kā kathana hai hi uccāraṇa bhī to ek prayojana hai atah ina ki itsamjnā aur lopa avaśya karanā chāhiye.” **\[You’ll are cautioned to the fact that some grammarians consider this /u/ to be a mukhasukhārtha as it has no purpose and thus is not an ‘it’. However, other grammarians suggest that even pronunciation is a purpose and so these are also subject to the ‘it’ and therefore lopa.\] **

Thus, while the majority believe in view no. 2, a discussion that would change one’s opinion should always be welcome. Finally it is upto scholars of repute to judge and decide.

Rishit
