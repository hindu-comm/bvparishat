Rishit ji, thanks. Dr. Devasthali's observations strengthen my point that itsamjna is the deviice to discard phonemes not wanted in prakriya and derived form. It is uniformly applicable to all including ucchaaranaartha.                            
                                   
            . Prof. Deshpande's argument of the LaN pratyahara does not stand because the pratyaahaara, which is obviously a nonpaninian tantrayukti to account for some forms like kloooptashikha
is rejected by Nagesha and even by modern scholars.I think we should not impose the views of later commentators on Panini and try to intrpret him in his own light. Panini obviously did not prescribe LaN. It deserves to be discarded.

Well, this debate has raised many interesting issues which need to be elaborately dealt with.First of all we should try to understand the implications of asiddhatva which will help resolve the issue of sasajusho ruH the starting point of the debate.

I wish I have more time. But I will try in my next mail.
