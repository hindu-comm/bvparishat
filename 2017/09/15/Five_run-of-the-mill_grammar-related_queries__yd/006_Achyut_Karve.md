Dear Raviji,

On the question of recitation of the Maheshwar there is one more question.

Why is it that the first sutra is recited as ऐउण् instead of अइउण् .

4\. How does झभञ् घढधष् become झभय्ँ घढधष्? I've happened to hear many pronounce thus. What's the सन्धि involved?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
