I don't have access to my books at the moment, but in many places like "u" in "ru", the commentaries, going all the way back to Mahābhāṣya say that such and such a sound is purely mukhasukhārtha. That means it is not technically an "it", and does not get deleted by "tasya lopaḥ", and yet it is not counted as part of the morphological unit. It is there to facilitate the pronunciation of "r". Other instances of such mukhasukhārtha elements may include "a" in rules like "ra-ṣābhyām no ṇaḥ ...", where "a" is strictly not an "it", and yet it does not count in the substantive meaning of the rule.
