Dear Shivakumariji,

  

  Different editions of the Aṣṭādhyāyī add such signs. Several editions (e.g. S.M. Katre) add svarita markings. Historically, the text of the Aṣṭādhyāyī that had reached Kātyāyana and Patañjali did not have these markings, and therefore they essentially proposed to reverse engineer such markings based on the perceived need and utility. This is what is reflected in the maxims प्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्या: पाणिनीया: and प्रतिज्ञास्वरिता: पाणिनीया:. The lack of anunāsika and accent markings in the early written versions of the Aṣṭādhyāyī has something to do with lack of such markings in the early forms of Kharoṣṭhī and Brāhmī that were close in time to Kātyāyana and Patañjali. Not all oral features of the Aṣṭādhyāyī could be fully represented in the early forms of these ancient scripts. For a discussion of this early transmission of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, please see my attached article. With best wishes,
