Salutations scholars,  
Below are five run-of-the-mill questions on grammar. I figured not one qualified to start an entire page in this forum and so I jotted them down and now there's five. I'd be greatful for your guidance and thanks in advance.  
  
1. Of "हरिः श्री गणपतये नमः" and "हरिश्रीगणपतये नमः" which is right?  
Shouldn't first one be हरये श्रियै गणपतये नमः?  
Shouldn't second be हरिश्रीगणपतिभ्यो नमः?  
  
2. Somewhat on the same plane, shouldn't it be "श्रीगुरुभ्यो नमः।" I've seen usage aplenty of "श्री गुरुभ्यो नमः।"  
  
3. ससजुषो रुः is in त्रिपादि। How does then उकार get इत्संज्ञा and subsequently gets elided? Shouldn't उपेदेशेऽजनुनासिक इत् and तस्य लोपः be blind to ससजुषो रुः?  
  
4. How does झभञ् घढधष् become झभय्ँ घढधष्? I've happened to hear many pronounce thus. What's the सन्धि involved?  
  
5. How to explain compound words in Sanskrit being written in Roman script by splitting them? I've seen books named "Avyaya Kośa", "Nyāya Siddhānta Muktāvalī." Shouldn't they be named Avyayakośa and Nyāyasiddhāntamuktāvalī?
