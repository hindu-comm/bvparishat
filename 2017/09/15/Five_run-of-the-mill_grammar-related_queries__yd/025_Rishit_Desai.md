Respected Scholars,

Am quoting a paragraph of G.V.Devasthali from his ‘Anubandhas of Pāṇini’ p. 22; ‘The first point to be noted is that in several cases, anubandhas (particularly vowels) are used only for ease of pronunciation. Commenting on ŚS6, the Kāśikā declares that the vowel /a/ in that sūtra is nasal by pratijnā and is, therefore, an anubandha; but the same vowel /a/ occurring in each one of the letters \[sic\] (in the other ŚSs beginning with “ha” is only for the sake of pronunciation and hence is not to be considered an anubandha. If this view is strictly followed, several of the vowels used with the pratyayas etc. by P will have to be denied the designation anubandha. **But we may not be so fastidious**; and may assume that even such letters \[sic\] (and these are all vowels) as appear to have been used by P for mere ease of pronunciation (mukhasukhārtha ot ucccāraṇartha) are also anubandhas…’

The point I believe he is trying to communicate (and I, with my limitations, do agree with this view) that “these” vowels, i.e. both the mukhasukhārthas and those that give out a purpose, are all anubandhas. When they have a specific purpose such as the /i/ of ṭunadi which invokes the num, they are not called mukhasukhārtha. In all other instances such as the /u/ of sīyut; i.e. when they have no purpose, they are mukhasukhārtha.

For only if they are anubandhas, can they be elided.

Further, even the /t/ of the tapara should be an anubandha as it needs to be elided. And if we were to agree on this fact then, the references of the /t/ in “āt” or a vidhiyamāna “at’ of say 7.1.86 are then the mukhasukhārtha /t/ and not the mora-limiting /t/. I am unable to quote references for these at the moment.

All in all, all mukhasukhārthas are anubandhas but not all anubandhas are mukhasukhārthas.

This is my humble explanation and is open to criticism.
