Dear Learned members,

  

Seeking your guidance on the following:

  

I am told by many learned ones that Pitritarpana is not to be performed by those with living parents / living father. (Except as part of Brahma Yajnam nityakarma).

  

Can anyone give me the exact sutra reference from either the Apastambha / Bodhayana grihya sutras to support this contention?

  

Also for one with living parents, which part of the Pitri tarpana in Brahmayajnam needs to be performed for Bodhayana sutris?

  

Many thanks,

  

Venkat
