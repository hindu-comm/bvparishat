Shri Korada Garu:--

  

One more complication recently arose in this seemingly "simple" ritual.

Recently a purohit had come home for performing my father's father's shraddha (my pitaamaha's shraddha)

  

Using the Bodhayana Brahmakarma Samucchaya as pramana and the directions of Bodhayana Ghanapaatis from Shringeri I had told my father to face south for Pitru and face north for Rshi tarpanas. (Pramana attached from Bodhayana Br Karma Samucchaya) ..since he performs Brahmayajna daily.

  

The purohit came and told him this is wrong since while one is sitting facing east, offering rshitarpana udaka of water falls on the Northern direction and offering pitru tarpana goes in the southern direction.

  

Although in the surface this seems logical, if one considers both hands (and not just the right hand) the above logic makes no sense and goes out of the window.

  

I have tried convincing him but of no use.

What are your views in this matter? And has Rshi Apastambha said anything in this regard?

  

Thanks

  

Venkat
