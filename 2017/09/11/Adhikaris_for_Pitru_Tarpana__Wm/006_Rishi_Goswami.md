Namaste

I do Pitri Tarpana, not regularly, but Amavasya Tarpana and in Pitripaksha daily \*currently.

I was never taught to do Tarapna with adding Yava-tila-aadi to my Copper Glass, i just do it after Pratah Sandhya with same Loti i use for Arghya. But over here, I see alot of Pandits asking Yajmans to wear Pavitri, having 2 kushas in hand, and then adding chandan, and yavatilam to copper vessel and then pouring through the requeired Vedavakyas.

I'm Krishna Yajurvedi Telanga Brahmana of Taittiriya Shakha, I'm living in Mumbai since 5-6 generations so I don't know my mother tongue and many traditions lost. But now our culture is mixed with Mumbai's, so I'm unaware of exact method. As most Brahmans I interact with are Shukla Yajurvedis who are mainly from North.

So if any Krishna Yanurvedi Brahmana Guru here, please guide me, what is our prescribed method to perform this rite? Are yavadi required?

And I don't use Pavitri for Sandhyavandan daily, I only wear Munji Mekhla, is Pavitri compulsory?

Namaskara.  
Rishi.
