Dear Shri Rishi ji

  

Thanks for clarifying.

  

Since you have jeeva pitrus who already perform tarpana, kindly ascertain *what you have adhikara for* at present.

That would be your first step.

Some friends of mine are spreading Tarpana manuals online for those who do not know how.

Although this is a good thing, it is wise to know adhikara first if there is a senior in your kula performingsome rituals.

I had a rather sharp disagreement with a friend on this list on the subject of performing pitri tarpanas outside of Brahmayajnam.

With and without Til is another story altogether.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
