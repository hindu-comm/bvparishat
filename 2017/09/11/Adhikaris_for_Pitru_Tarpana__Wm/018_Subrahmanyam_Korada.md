नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

 In addition to the three types ofतीर्थम् the special Brahama-tirtham can be added where both the hands are joined and the water falls along the elbow

                                   
---- Vid rniyengar

  

Yes , ब्रह्मतर्पणम् / ब्राह्मम् is also there . In the same context in अमरकोश --

  

मूले ह्यङ्गुष्ठस्य ब्राह्मम् -- the beginning of the thumb is ब्राह्मम् , i e ब्रह्मतर्पणम् should be done through the beginning of the

thumb . ब्रह्मणः इदं ब्राह्मम् ।

May be what you have mentioned is the आचार in your region .

  

If one has to do तर्पणम् with अञ्जलि , then it is possible in a नदी etc or one has to take water into an उद्धरिणी , place it

in अ‘ज्जलि and offer .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
