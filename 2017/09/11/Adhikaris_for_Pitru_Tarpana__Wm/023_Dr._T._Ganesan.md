So what is the clarificaion ?

  

If these rules are mere अर्थवाद then, are they not to be taken seriously and therefore meaningless?

It cannot be that the ancient sages have prescribed these rules for no purpose.

  

In this context it is worth referring to the commentary of Ramakantha,
a great Saivasiddhanta Acharya who lived in Kashmir (circa 9-10 CE) on the Matangaparamesvaragama (a Saiva Agama) Kriyapada 3:99.

  

He states that the opponent (a Mimamsaka) raises the objection why these rules of Nityanushthana, etc. are to be learnt and followed as these are not taught by the followers of Jaimini ?

  

Ramakantha answers "Since for the Jaiminiya-s it may be right to hold such a view as they consider the Sastra (here the Veda-s) as अपुरुषेय ; but here (in the Saivagama context) these Sastra-s were all given by the Omniscient Siva and He can never utter such meaningless /purposeless words. If ever He were to do so then He is no better than a child or an idiot and therefore, the Sastra-s given out by Him loses its authority''.
