Namaste,

  

Amavasya tarpanas, gaya tarpanas, tila tarpanas etc. are nishiddha for jeeva pitrus.

  

They are eligible only for pitru tarpana with shuddha-jala which comes as a part of brahma-yajna. In brahma-yajna, there are certain swaadhyaya mantras followed by deva, rishi & pitru tarpanaas.

  

Since, you stay in Mumbai, there is a sringeri shankara mutt in Chembur and good vadyaars are there who are teaching vedas to office goers on weekends. You may approach them.

  

Regarding, brahma-yajna, there are sampradaya bhedas and vary from Andhra sampradaya to Tamil sampradaya. For us, (andhra), doing pitru-tarpana (as a part of brahma-yajna) with prAchInavIti is prohibited (for jeeva-pitrus). Whereas, in Tamilnadu, I have seen my own friends doing pitru-tarpanam with prAchInavIti. Also, the tarpanAs vary with Apastamba & Boudhayana sutras.

  

So, it is better to approach a good purohita who should be of your swa-shakha belonging to your grihya-sutra and hailing from your region.
Because, he can explain better the variations of sampradaya.

  

I have learnt the brahma-yajna from one of the cousins of shri vidhusekhara bharati swamiji (purva-ashrama shri kuppa venkateshwara prasad) and since my parents are alive, I am doing the pitru-tarpana (as a part of BY) with shuddha-jala only and am forbidden from using tila.
Also, I am forbidden from donning yajnopavitam in 'prAchInavIti' position while doing diva-pitru-tarpanam.

  

rgs,

sriram
