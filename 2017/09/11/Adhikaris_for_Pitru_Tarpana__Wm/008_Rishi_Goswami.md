Namaskara Mahodaya.

Thankyou for informing. I will contact them.

I am jeevatpitrika but i do tarpan of pitamaha and prapitamaha (sapatneeka).

(I'd like to clarify I'm not doing Amavasya tarpanam with that vidhi but Nitya as part of brahmayajna, but just chose this Tithi. Father does Amavasya Tarpana, so even i do it on this tithi. I didn't clarify this, Sorry for writing in haste).

Namaskara \_/\\\_
