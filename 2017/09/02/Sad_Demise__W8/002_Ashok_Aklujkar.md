Dear Krishnaprasad and (your source) Shri Gaurav Sharma,  
  
Kindly let the other BVP members know the personal details about Shri Sivarāja/Shivaraj Ācārya/Acharya Kauṇḍinyāyana (where he lived, where he taught, what are the dates of his birth and death, what his principal works other than the Kāvya-prakāśa commentary are, etc.) and what the distinctive features of his scholarship were. Also, when the time is right, if there are any unpublished works of his and if any effort is being made to preserve those works.  
  
a.a.
