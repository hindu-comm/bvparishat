Dear Learned members,

  

Has anyone here attempted a Purascharana of Gayatri? If so, please share your experiences, any resources like "Gayatri Purascharana Paddhati" etc.

  

Also, does Gayatri have a yantra form in the Vedic or Tantric context? Please throw some light on this if possible.

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
