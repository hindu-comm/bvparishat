Though there are many texts available, I feel the paddhati given by Shri Ram Sharma Acharya of Gayatri Parivar is most Authentic. He himself did 24 purascharan each of 24 lakh mantras.

  

Most of his books are available online thru awgp website. You may also get those from Gayatri Shaktipeeth located at various places.
