This custom of doing परिषेचनम् for food that we intake seems to have been adopted from the sacrificial tradition. In the अग्नि होत्र प्रकरणम् it is ordained that before and after the होमः one has to do परिषेचनम् for अग्नि. There it is prescribed that, in the evening the accompanying mantra shall be ऋतं त्वासत्येन परिषिञ्चामि and that in the mornings, it shall be altered as सत्यं त्वर्तेन परिषिञ्चामि. It is explained in the *Taittiriyabrahmana* that ऋतम् means mental truth (Sayana) and is equated with अग्नि. And सत्यम् is explained as verbal truth (Sayana) and equated with आदित्य. (see the attachment).

Sayana explains these terms,  ऋतम् and सत्यम् differently at different occasions. Sometimes he explains ऋतम् as अवश्यंभावी .

   The tenor and approach ofBrahmanatexts are such that it is very difficult to make out any thing solid and concrete. Primarily aimed to be the manuals of sacrificial rituals, these are neither the mere practical manuals nor the mere literary interpretations of *mantra*-s used for sacrificial rites. Wild imagination, giving random etymologies for words and intertwining these with myths, and symbolising and de-symbolising things, images and ideas are the very nature of theBrahmanatexts. The *Satapathabrahmana* portrays the Yajnas ( and the deliberations on these, probably the Brahmana texts too) as dense forests where one is likely to get lost in their thickness, and get afflicted by hunger and thirst, if he is not properly equipped. 

तानि वा एतानि यज्ञारण्यनि यज्ञकृन्तत्राणि, ...यथारण्यानांमुग्धांस्चरतो शनाया वा पिपासा वा पाप्मानो रक्षांसि सचेरन् एवं हैवैनानशनाया वा पिपासा वा पाप्मानो रक्षांसिसचन्ते, अथये विद्वांसो यथा प्रवाहात् प्रवाहमभयादभयम् , एवं हैव ते देवतायै देवतामुपसंयन्ति (12.2.3.12)

   Some of the Brahmana passages explain certain sacrificial acts based on mundane practices and customs. Some social and cultural acts are, at times, explained based on certain sacrificial acts as well. For some such curious statements in the *Taittiriyabrahmana* one may visit
