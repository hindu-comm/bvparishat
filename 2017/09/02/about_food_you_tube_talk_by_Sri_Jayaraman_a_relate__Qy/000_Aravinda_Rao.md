This is a query for traditional scholars.

  

During the lunch time the mantra सत्यंत्वर्तेन परिषिञ्चामि is read and during supper the mantra ऋतं त्वा सत्येन परिषिञ्चामि is read. In the morning we are doing parishecanam of satyam with ritam and in the night doing parishecanam of ritam with satyam.

  

Is there some bhashyam on it? I could not hazard any interpretation except that during the worldly activities during the day one has to keep in mind ritam also in addition to satyam and in the night he has to get back to satyam. It depends on accepting the meaning that ritam would mean 'whatever is right in a particular context' and satyam is the saarvakaalika satyam.

Any clarification please?
