It would be great if someone could provide information about Lopamudra in detail. There is a little information on wiki that I have read already and since, I am not proficient in Sanskrit, I cannot read the original Sanskrit texts about her. I wish to write a poem in English about her/based on/inspired by her and do not want to go factually incorrect.  
Any help would be greatly appreciated!  
  
Best Regards,  
Navanita Das
