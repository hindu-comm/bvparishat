Namaste

  

You can read about Lopamudra under Agastya in the Puranic Encyclopedia -

  

<https://archive.org/stream/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft#page/4/mode/2up>

  

She was daughter of a King and became Agastya's wife. But she demanded Agastya to bring wealth for leading family life. Interesting story.

  

Some information is available here also -
