Pranams to all,

  

I am sure all scholars will agree with Dr. Ramaratnam's suggestion to bring out booklets containing important discussions taking place at BVP. Besides this, I request BVP management to create an archive of BVP discussions along the lines of Indology list and Advaita list. Discussions of each month can be searched online or downloaded for offline use.  

  

<http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/>

  

<http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/>  

  

In addition to archives, Indology list has a search interface which is very much useful.

regards  
shankara
