Dear Scholars,

  
After seeing a lot of derivation processes, I am tempted to hypothesize the importance of पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् rule in the following manner.  
  
1. In gammatical derivation process सपादसप्ताध्यायी rules can be applied in random order.  
2. Once you start applying त्रिपादी rules, they must be applied sequentially.  
  
Is this paraphrasing fine? Or is there a counterexample to this hypothesis?
