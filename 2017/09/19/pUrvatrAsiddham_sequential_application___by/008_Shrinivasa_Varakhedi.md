Dear Dr.Patej ii,

  

Sorry for the delayed response. Yes, as you stated the application of TripAdvisor sutras follows the order of sutras. However, there are many exceptions. A paper presented by Sridhar and Shrivasa Varakhedi on conflict resolution technuques in ashtadhyayi deals with this subject.

  

Warm regards,
