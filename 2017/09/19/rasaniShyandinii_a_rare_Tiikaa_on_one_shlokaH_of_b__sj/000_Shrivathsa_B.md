hariH OM,

  

 This is a beautiful Tiikaa work on one shlokaH of bAlakANDaH of vAlmiikiirAmAyaNam.

  

 This book seems to have been republished in 2010. The publishers have put in great efforts to bring out this book which is error free.

  

 The book is uploaded here:

 I am extremely thankful to shrii Venkatasubramanian of Vyoma Linguistic Labs for having introduced me to this work and sharing the hard copy.

  

स्वस्ति,

   भवानीभारती जयतेतमाम्,

                 श्रीवत्सः ॥
