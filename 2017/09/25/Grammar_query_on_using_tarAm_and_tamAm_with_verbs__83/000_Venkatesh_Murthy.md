Namo Vidvadbhyaha

  

William Dwight Whitney says on page 176 of his Sanskrit Grammar book -

  

'By a wholly barbarous combination, finding no warrant in the earlier and more genuine usages of the language, the suffixes of comparison in their adverbial feminine form,तराम् andतमाम्, are later allowed to be added to personal forms of verbs: thus सीदतेतराम् (R.: the only case noted in the epics) is more despondent, व्यथयतितराम् disturbs more, अलभततराम् obtained in a higher degree, हसिष्यतितराम् will laugh more. No examples of this use of तमाम् are quotable.'

  

1. Why he is saying barbarous combination? Is it not allowed in Paninian grammar?

  

2. Why he is saying No examples of तमाम् are quotable? Are there no examples or there are examples but he cannot quote them?
