Thank you, but there is indeed nothing to wonder at. Digitized texts (such as the large corpus of GRETIL), searchable through the Unix/Linux program grep (and similar programs, available on all platforms) allow one to find examples of specific forms (though they should always be checked against editions, since most e-texts have a rather high number of typographical errors); sometimes Google also can help to find occurrences of a form. (The form hantitamām in Amaracandrasūri's Bālabhārata is one, however, which I simply had encountered in my reading recently by chance.)

  

When a Japanese colleague recently said to me how very useful grep and Google Search are, I composed the following verse, half in jest:

  

Grep-śaktyā sumahatyā ca Google-anveṣaṇena ca\|  
gakāradvitayenaiva cchidyeran granthasaṃśayāḥ\|\|

  

By the very great power of Grep, and by Google Search---just by these two G's doubts about texts/text-passages

can be cut off.  

  

Of course grep and Google themselves alone cannot really resolve doubts, but they certainly can help, when carefully/critically used, and controlled by judgement.
