Namaste

  

I am not defending Whitney but he thinks तराम्andतमाम् are not used with verbs exceptone examplein early works like Epics but used in later works. Forतमाम् he cannot quote any example. Panini is describing language of Sistas and not inventing a newlanguage. A word used must have some Sistas using it for support. If we get some word with Panini grammar but it is not used in Sistas what is the use? But here Sistas is also not properly explained. If they are some persons in the past how can we develop the language for new Sistas today? Otherwise the language will be stuck in the Sistas of past.
