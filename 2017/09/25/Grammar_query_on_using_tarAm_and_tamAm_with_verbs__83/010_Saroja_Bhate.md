I fully agree with Sivasnaniji'sviews except on one point: Patanjali as an aid to understand Panini. The Pune scholar he mentioned is right , because,Patanjali's main task is to explain Varttikas rather than to independently interpret Panini. He has hardly offered an independent interpretaion of a rule not glossed by Katyayana, who, in turn, has discussed not more than onethird of Paninian sutras. The Mahbhashya is a wonderful masterpiece, a rich mine of information on India's intellectual history documenting debates on many epistemological philosophical cultural issues alongwith linguistic issues, of course.It does offer solutions to some tricky points in Panini.It makes a pleasant reading with its vibrant prose. And yet, a serous student of Panini cannot rely on mahabhashya as he can on Kashika for a complete interpretaion of every single rule of Panini. This is what the Pune scholar meant. Mahabhashya has its own place as bhashya, the first avaialble exegesis on Panini and Katyayana together, but it has its own limitations as far as an aid in interpreting Panini is concerned.

As for Whitney he has already been disposed of even by his fellow followers.
