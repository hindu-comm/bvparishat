There certainly are examples which could be quoted from classical literature. (Whitney was, no doubt, more well read in Vedic literature than in classical Sanskrit.) Here are two: bhātitamām in Śrīharṣa's Naiṣadhacarita 22.95 (verse numbering may  
differ in different editions; it is the verse beginning gaure priye  
bhātitamāṃ tamisrā), and hantitamām in Amaracandrasūri's  
Bālabhārata 1.4. Others can be quoted, also from śāstric literature.
