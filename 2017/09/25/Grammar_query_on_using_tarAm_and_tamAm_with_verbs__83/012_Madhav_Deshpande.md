  Sarojaji has given a proper account of Prof. S.D. Joshi's approach to Pāṇini, and the limitations of the Mahābhāṣya. Besides the explanation given by Sarojaji, S.D. Joshi was also of the opinion that certain aspects of Pāṇini's grammar had already become unclear by the time of Kātyāyana and Patañjali, so that these great minds were trying their best by offering alternative explanations for many features of Pāṇini's work. Prof. Joshi's view was that an intensive study of the Aṣṭādhyāyi could reveal aspects of Pāṇini's work that were lost before Kātyāyana and Patañjali.

  As for Whitney, his approach to Pāṇini has been rightly criticized by many. However, Whitney's contribution lies is focusing on the study of Sanskrit language as attested in the known Vedic texts. In his edition of the Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā (Atharva-Prātiśākhya), under rule after rule, Whitney cites detailed statistics of how many instances in the available Atharvaveda go contrary to the rules of the Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā. His grammar of Sanskrit gives details of every form with its earliest attestation. Thus, his approach to Sanskrit language through attestations in texts paves a way for a study of Sanskrit, not through rules, but through actual attestations in known texts, and allows us to see how different forms of Sanskrit developed over a long stretch of time. So there are some positive benefits of his approach.

  I am not defending Whitney's criticism of Pāṇini, but merely pointing out how different his approach was, and that there are some benefits to be derived from that approach.
