For - tarāṃ indeed there is no problem in finding very many attestations; the original poster had however asked whether examples of -tamāṃ can be quoted (Whitney had said that no examples there of can be quoted). -tamāṃ  
is indeed much rarer, but is by no means unattested in classical literature, both kāvya and śāstra. I cited earlier two examples from mahākāvya (by Śrīharṣa and Amaracandrasūri); let me now mention one from a verse in Vidyācakravartin's Saṃjīvanī commentary on Ruyyaka's Alaṃkārasarvasva: the form is vyākriyatetamām (p. 203 of S.S. Janaki's edition).
