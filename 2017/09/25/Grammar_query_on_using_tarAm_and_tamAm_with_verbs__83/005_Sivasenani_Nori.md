We must understand the position of scholars like Whitney. They are not willing to accept something as right because Panini said so. If Panini has no sanctity, why talk about Patanjali etc.? It is not merely Western scholars who hold these views. A Pune-based Indian scholar who passed away recently started translating the Mahabhashya into English and then stopped after a few volumes, since he sincerely felt that Patanjali did not understand Panini. So the phrase "barbarous combination" is Whitney's judgement of the rule of Panini by which "the suffixes ... are allowed to be added to personal forms of verbs". Amongst all scholars of Sanskrit grammar, Whitney, in my view, deviates the most from the Paninian framework. He does not admit the ten lakaaras framework, for instance.

  

Many years back, this breath-taking boldness had its attraction to me. Why should something be right merely because a venerated person says so? However years of study have changed this view. To start with tradition does not shrink away from new explanations. If a system were to replace "su" with "ra" and explain how rAmaH is to be derived, it is admitted as equally valid. Patanjali admits as much saying that an alternate scheme is viable, but it cannot be called Paninian. Bhartrihari makes clear that pratyayas like "su" are only upAyas - devices like a scaffolding which are used till the goal is accomplished and abandoned later - and not real. Finally there are alternate frameworks of grammar within Indian tradition (Caandra-, Kaatantra-). At a different level, non-Paninian usages, say the long lR, are routinely used (in Tantra) by otherwise staunch Paninians.

  

The real test of an alternate framework is this: comprehensiveness and simplicity. A given system - say the Vedic roots system of Whitney with Greek-inspired tenses and moods - should explain the known usages of language as comprehensively as possible. Further such a system should be simple. These criteria are very powerful which can be understood better if we consider examples.

  

If we apply this test to, say, English, where do we stand? Who is the Panini of English? Or, how steady, complete or simple are the various theories of Chomsky in terms of describing any language?

  

This - is the alternative better than the munitrayavyAkaraNam - must be the focus, not whether Paninian framework is accepted or not, or the choice of adjectives used to describe it.

  

While one believes that in general mankind has improved over years, it is seen that some of the ancient texts are yet unmatched - in scope, precision or concision. So while boldness is all good in statements of intent and attitude, the actual work surpassing earlier works is proof whether that boldness is real or mere hot air. This is what makes Navyanyaaya so admirable - and yet they are quite respectful towards the earlier works.
