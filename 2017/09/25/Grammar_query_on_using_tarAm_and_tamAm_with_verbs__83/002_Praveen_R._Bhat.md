It is very much allowed by Panini sutra



५.३.५६ तिङश्च \[अतिशायने तमबिष्ठनौ\] and ५.३.५७ द्विवचनविभज्योपपदे तरबीयसुनौ \[

अतिशायने\]।

 Maybe the तद्धितप्रत्यय combining with तिङन्तपद finds the mention as "barbarous" in his book since it may be difficult to understand, especially being used infrequently. However, I find the usage of the word barbarous w.r.t. सम्यक्कृतम् words

barbarous

!

It may be possible that even a widely well-read person may have difficulty finding तमाम् usages in literature, but Kashika quotesपचतितमाम् and जल्पतितमाम् as two examples, so derivations with other तिङन्तपदs seem possible in the meaning of अतिशय of गुण। None of the commentaries on Kashika or Siddhantakaumudi seem to be limiting the usage as far as I can tell. The scholars here may be able to enlighten us more.

  

Kind rgds,
