Please avoid such questions with broad /huge scope. Try to be specific.

  

You may start with books like Kathopanishad, if you are interested in ancient sources.

  

Or, you may read Swami Vivekananda's discussion of the issue if you are interested in modern stuff.

  

If you have specific questions, please feel free to post.
