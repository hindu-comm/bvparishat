Namaste,

  

Paramacharya had a knack of narrating fascinating parables....and this is one such. The Ramabhadra Dikshita wrote a poem called 'Patanjali Charitam' and this was recorded. 

  

I sometimes get intrigued whether these stories have any basis or just handed down like that without any historical evidences. Gaudapada was brahma-raakshasa and Govindapada in his purvaasrama had 4 wives (one from each varNa) !! 

  

Thank God ...Sankara Bhagavatpada is spared

  

rgs,

sriram
