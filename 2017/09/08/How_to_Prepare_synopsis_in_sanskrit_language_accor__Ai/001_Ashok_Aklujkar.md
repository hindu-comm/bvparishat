Dear Shri Luitel,

  

I do not mean to be unkind to you, but I must say that I am surprised by your request. Do you mean to say that you became an assistant professor in a department of Sanskrit without being exposed to such concepts as “the method of research, the review of literature, statement of the problem, problem analysis, data interpretation, hypothesis”— in short, without ever being required to write down a plan and/or without even once going through the exploration of a library (through catalogue cards or an electronic catalogue)? If such is the reality, then Sanskrit studies in India are in much more serious trouble than I thought. (Here I have in mind also the other inquiries similar to yours that appeared on the BVP forum.)

  

If I have misunderstood you and if you have already done some work on the Ph.D. project, why not first ask your Ph.D. guide if you are on the right track and get your plan critiqued by him/her and then ask the members of this forum to suggest additional sources?

  

A Ph.D. program is supposed to be a test of whether you can work independently in a reasonably broad but well-defined area of research. If the members of this forum help you in all the respects you have indicated, where will the test of your independence occur? Unless this test occurs, how will the next (and more important) test, namely that a Ph.D. degree should be awarded only if the resulting thesis/dissertation makes an \*original\* contribution to a specific field of knowledge be met?

  

Have you gone through the bibliography volumes of Prof. Karl H. Potter’s \_Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies\_? Have you looked at books that have“Viśiṣṭādvaita” in their titles? Have you considered the possibility that“Research on Visistadvaita Vedanta” may be too broad a way of specifying your dissertation topic?

  

If the library of your department or university is poor in the area you have chosen for your research, have you explored the Internet, googling with key words?

  

Since I have too many other commitments to meet, I will not write another response to your post of inquiry. However, I do hope that you will do the necessary leg work and finger work yourself and, at the end of your Ph.D. project emerge as a confident scholar capable of bringing something new to the study ofViśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta.

  

  

a.a.
