Namaste

  

1\. How to undertake ' Research in Vishista-Advaita' in an advanced and specialized area which is a conglomerate of several disciplines and
dimensions covering:

  

 - (1a) ' Spiritual Practices ( = Yoga-Sadhanaa) + Comprehensive formulation of'Logic -Philosophy' (= Tarka - Jijnyaasaa) ' 

  

 (1b) Get such a proposal to be guided by a competent Professor at University ( India or Abroad) ? Would a Professor at any modern
(Secular ) Sanskrit Universitybe considered equivalent by any semblance to be and belong to, empowered and intended to groom a ' Tattva - Abhyaasi - Shaastrajna' ?

  

  'Upaadhyaaya-- Shikshaka - Samshodhaka' are different class from ' Tattva - Darshana - Saadhakas.

  

 ' Shaastraabhyasa for Tattva -darshana'(A Personal life style and value commitment = Shaastra - Yoga ) is different from ' Shaastra -Grantha - paatha - anuvaada chintana - mudrana ' ( A scholarly academic exercise for ' Panditya and jeevikaa vrutti / Vidyaa - Shaastra - Vaanijya vrutti - Udyoga) .

  

 Universities outside of India distinguish these aspects by use of the term ' Practicing Professor - Professional of Religion' .

  

 ' University' is different in its structure, goals and constraints from a 'Gurukul'.

  

 ' Gurukuls may answer the expectation of ' Tattva -jijnyaasaa -Samshodhana / Abhyaasa' in ' Vedanta - Vishista - Advaita Darshana Shaastra', but they can not award a ' Doctoral degree' covered under UGC norms.

  

 There is a lot more to think on what Professor Aklujkar and GSS Murthy have noted. And Venkatesha murthy's observation reading \< 'I heard for PHD the candidate must sendhis research to foreign university professor and get the approval. It is not sufficient ifhis guide approves. Then there will be a good evaluation and the **candidate will have to dogood research to please the foreign professor.** '> . A \<Foreign Professor> is identified by the ' Mindset to approach and appreciate Veda- Shaastra - Achaarya - Sampradaya \> and not by birth, name, occupation, post held, place of living and such other non-consequential tags. In Indian context, this would be akin to asking a ' Naastika -Chaarvaka to guide a'Vedanta - Tattva jijnyasu'.

  

 India - of - Pre independence ( colonial period) submissively allowed ' Foreign Professors' to ' Re-Orient andTrain theTraditional Scholars and set a three hundred years precedence' in aligning the ' Shaastra - Dharma-Sampradaya to ' Religion- Philosophy- Theology- Anthropology' frame.

  

 This precedence triggered the standards of ' Traditional Schools and mindset of scholars of Tradition' to get their research approach
to meet the standards set for 'philosophy -studies aligned to Biblical language scholarship' and ' invite the approval of research studies, as thepleasure of foreign professor'. This wascontinued
through theUniversity proceduresfor ' grooming a Scholar of the Oriental disciplines'commissioned as per directive approved from
the Colonial government. This frame work forged around 18th and 19th centurieshas created its' sampradaya' of  faithfully following of these footprints of research methodology -pedagogy to please the foreign professor( 'Foreign Acharya -Pada- Paada -grahana - paddhati') for ' Ph.D- padavee- pradaanam' as ' Svarga- apavarga -siddhi = Purushartha - Moksha'.The technicalities and sophistry of administrative procedures are niceties of language ; but they have not changed the ' inner essence, the soul'.

  

 One may prefer to read the detailing provided in the 'Prolegomena' of Critical Edition : Mahabharata' on how the process of ' Mahabharata Critical Edition related research progressed' and ' Teams that contributed to this mammoth output' and later lectures of Chief Editor
of Mahabharata Critical Edition Project. This may helpto understand the depth of the problem in this area. And the current debate on ' Revisiting Critical Edition of Mahabharata'. And how to address ' Research in Vishista Advaita and write thesis in Samskruth language'.
