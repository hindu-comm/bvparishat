Dear All,

  

I was searching for books written in Marathi for my father to read. But unfortunately Sahitya Akademi doesnt have any books in Marathi.

  

Marathi is not listed on their ebooks page as well. Kindly guide me if I am mistaken. Below is the link I was checking.

  

<http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/publications/e-books.jsp>  

  

  

Regards

Sunil
