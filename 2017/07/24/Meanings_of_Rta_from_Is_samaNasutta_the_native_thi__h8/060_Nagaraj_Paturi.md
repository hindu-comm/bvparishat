Dr Yadu-ji,

  

I was travelling. As such was not able to respond to your saadhana post.

  

"To me R^ita is for us to practice to observe, find, recognize, and (apply) implement in our own life when you are still living."

  

Is this the distinction between R^tam and Satyam?

  

That is, is Satyam not topractice to observe, find, recognize, and (apply) implement in our own life when you are still living ?

  

Both R^tam and Satyam are being used parallelly, side by side, as part of identical expressions, in all the quotes we discussed here.

  

vadishyaami, vachmi etc. are expressions that are used in connection with both.

  

All these expressions refer to actionsin our own life when we are still living.

  

So this point does not help to identify the distinction between the two.
