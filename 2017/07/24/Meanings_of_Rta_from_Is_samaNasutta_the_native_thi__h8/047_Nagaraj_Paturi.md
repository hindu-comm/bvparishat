No. Ritam can be something like Brahman. But Satyam is not just Jagat.

  

When it is said that Jagat is Satyam (Vyaavahaarika satyam for Advaitins, just Satyam for others), it does not mean that Satyam refers to Jagat alone.

  

Satyam can be the value of a statement. (Truth value)

(<https://www.britannica.com/topic/truth-value>)

  

Truth value of a statement can be relative to the knowledge of the speaker and listener of the statement.

  

Keeping a promise is also considered to be satyavaakyam. (Haris'chandra)
