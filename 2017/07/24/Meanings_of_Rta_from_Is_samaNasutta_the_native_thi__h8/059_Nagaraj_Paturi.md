Sir,

  

That is रुत not ऋत .

  

शब्दार्थप्रत्ययानाम् इतरेतराध्यासात् संकरः तत्प्रविभागसंयमात् सर्वभूतरुतज्ञानम् \|\| YS 3-17\|\|

  

is the sutra.

  

रुत is the sound made by living things.  

  

One can acquire the ability to understand the sound made by any living thing by acquiring Samyama of the distinction between sound/word, meaning and knowledge which (distinction) usually gets contaminated because of the many other understandings that are false.
