Dear Dr Abhyankar

  

I am familiar with the term and it's dictionary meaning.

  

My question was specifically associated the "गणपत्यथर्वशीर्षम् "ऋतं वच्मि \| सत्यं वच्मि \|"

  

Why did our ancestors used TWO different terms to express " सत्य
-meaning TRUTH ", which cannot change as it is and has to be absolute.

  

Thanks  

  

Dr Yadu
