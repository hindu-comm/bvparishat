Namste"  

  

IMO - This is only way one can clearly understand the importance of "saadhkaa's" responsibility to understand and practice the, verify and validate for themselves what is the real truth and not what they read, and perceive "prtyaksha anumaana pramaaNaani".

  

This can only satisfy the primary message from Shankara, "ब्रह्म satya jagna mithyaa", both terms used to mean TRUTH.

  

This also what it is said "TRUTH IS GOLDEN or GOLD"

  

How can and how does distinguish between "Gold Plated" & "pure GOLD", whose responsibility should that be ? This may help solve us why our ancestors "hiraNmayena paatrNa satyasyaapihitam mukham" as the last mantra in Yajurveda text as well as ishaavaasya upaniShada.  

  

We all know Yajurveda is for practice not just academic thinking.

  

If my view and understanding does not fit to what they (some) who think it should be, then they need to explain why did Shankara insists on "jagna beging mithyaa" as they say in Marathi "kshaNabhanguura". To me jagan that is manifested is constantly changing thus cannot be really true, where as, recognizing that "brihat principle of expansion" "The Change" is the real truth.  

  

To me R^ita is for us to practice to observe, find, recognize, and (apply) implement in our own life when you are still living. That is why during puujaa one says as a covenant, "R^itam vacmi \| satam vachmi", because this for actual practice and not an exercise of academic recitation and then gloat that he/she is an elite saaadhak. Everything ultimately boils down to "Perception & Reality".

  

This also help us understand हितभुक् मितभुक् ऋतभुक् ( त्रयं समुदितं कारणं भवति -- हेतुर्नतु हेतवः ) Thanks Pro Korada reminding me the significance of these recommendations from Ayurveda, which is the real viniyoga of observed knowledge.  

  

I firmly believe that greatest knowledge and/or philosophy is of absolute no value to me after I am dead. So if one does not understand it, and/or has no desire to practice the principle in their own lives how can there be any value that is the real "viniyoga" from our vaidik texts.
