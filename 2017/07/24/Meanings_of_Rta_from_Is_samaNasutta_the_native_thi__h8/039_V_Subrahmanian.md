Namaste  
  

Even though two words have the same meaning, when both are used in the same place, a difference is meaning is to be stated, taking the context into consideration. Hence the difference. There is this mahopanishadic verse giving several names for Brahman, which itself is a name:  
  
ऋतमात्मापरं ब्रह्म सत्यमित्यादिकाबुधैः।  
कल्पिता व्यवहारार्थं तस्य संज्ञा महात्मनः ॥4.54॥  
  
\[In order to facilitate parlance, the wise employ words such as Rtam, AtmA, Param, Brahma, Satyam, etc., to designate that Supreme Self.\]   
  

You can see both ṛtam and satyam in this list. In such situations, etymological meanings will have to given to some words.  
  

regards  

subbu
