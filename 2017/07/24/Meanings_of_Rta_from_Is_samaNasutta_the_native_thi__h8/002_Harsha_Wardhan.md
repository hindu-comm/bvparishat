Dear members,

  

Adding to the discussion, in my view,**ऋत**is the original name for Dharma, or rather, the concept of Dharma originates from the concept of**ऋत**

  

**ऋत******means the fundamental order inherent in the universe, the underlying basis and foundation of all creation.

  

It can broadly be approximated to the english words **harmony** or **order**.

  

Also, I suspect (this is just my conjecture) the word**ऋत** is the basis of the english word **rhythm**.  

  

with regards

Harsha
