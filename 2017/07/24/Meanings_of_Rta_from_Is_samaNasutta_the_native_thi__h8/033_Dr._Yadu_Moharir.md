Namaste Prof. Paturi

  

Based on what has been discussed in last 2 week on this thread, the statement that "R^itam" is the ultimate truth does not make sense to me, especially after reading V.N. Apte's paper.  

  

Help me understand, TRUTH is absolute that does not change during all three periods "Past, Present & the Future" (trikaalaatiita).  

R^ita does identify and signify some variation and change, so, how can it be the ABSOLUTE TRUTH ?  

  

Thanks to all scholars who have contributed to improve my understanding of "R^ita & satya"
