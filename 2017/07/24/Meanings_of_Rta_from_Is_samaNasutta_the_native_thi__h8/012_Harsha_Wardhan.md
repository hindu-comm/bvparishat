Shri Hemant ji,

  

Thank you for sharing the article. In it I find a rebuttal of the generally accepted (myself included) non-physical meaning ofऋतas a higher order or fundamental principle. The physical meaning Apte derives is clear, plain and simple - it's the zodiac path.

  

Occam's razor in action.

  

But this brings me to a pet theory of mine - that of the interpretative stances on the Rgveda. I am not a scholar, and correct me if I am wrong, but rgvedic verses have been mostly interpreted from an astronomical perspective. No doubt, this is because of the references in the Rgveda to the celestial bodies, the deitiesrepresenting them, the zodiac, and so on. In fact, as you know, BG Tilak based his entire dating scheme on the astronomical data.

  

I am curious, though, if other interpretations are possible. One of my earlier unanswered posts pertainedto a unique interpretationof the Rgveda from a biological viewpoint. A medical doctor Shri Rele of the previouscentury opined that the verses in the Rgveda could refer to the human brain, the brain stem and the spine.

  

This may be a digression from the focus of the original post, but I'd appreciate any light respected scholars may throw on this matter.

  

with regards

Harsha
