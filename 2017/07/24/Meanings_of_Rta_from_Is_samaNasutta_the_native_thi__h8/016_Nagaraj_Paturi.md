We also have S'riti lines like:

  

ऋतं वदिष्यामि। सत्यं वदिष्यामि। तन्मामवतु। तद्वक्तारमवतु। अवतु माम्। अवतु वक्तारम्॥  

  

whereऋतंandसत्यं are separately used.

  

There was a suggestion in the thread thatऋतं was used in the sense of Dharma . It is partly true too.

  

Finding Ritam as a component in the etynomological mening of words like anritam and ritam used as an equivalent of Dharma, people have suggested that

  

1. Ritam as that where Satyam and Dharma meet

  

2. Ritam is the absolute Dharma and absolute Satyam in contrast to relative (dEs'akaalabaddha) Dharma andrelative (dEs'akaalabaddha) Satyam. at the absolute level, Dharma = Satyam. It is that Dharma =Satyam that is being called as Ritam. Words Dharma and /or Satyam when used in the sense of their absolute forms, they are synonymous to Ritam. When the two words are used in the sense of their relative forms, they are not the same as Ritam. But due to semantic change in course of time, Ritam got used in the sense of relative Satyam too. It is because of such usages that usages such as anritam as opposite of satyam came into existence.

  

Coincidentally, in the west too, there came words like Natural Law into existence right from the days of classical Greek philosophy. It is at this level that THE Truth pursued by the natural sciences which is the Law underlying all natural laws is connected to the concepts of Natural law/Natural justice of jurisprudence and Natural Law of Ethics.

  

People with such understandindings from the west, started appreciating the view of ritam as a concept close to the idea of Natural Law of the classical Greeks (**<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law>**)(which later travelled into Christian theology).

  

While I was typing this post, Dr H N Bhat's post quotingऋतं वदिष्यामि। सत्यं वदिष्यामि। and its traditional commentary got posted. It confirms the view that ritam is the Dharma and Satyam at the level of , in the sense of Brahman.
