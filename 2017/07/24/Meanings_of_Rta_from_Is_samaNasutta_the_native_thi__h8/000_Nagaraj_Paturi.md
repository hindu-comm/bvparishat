ऋत has several meanings. One of them is truth.

  

अनृत means lie, falsehood etc.

  

ऋत in its origin refers to one of the pivotal, highest, vital, central ideas of Vedic thought.  

  

The meaning truth forऋत is secondary and is a derivative of the above mentioned deeper meaning in the Vedic texts.

Dear Paturiji,  
Thank you for the reply.  
  
Is this the reason that the Vedas have the force of reality and have stood the test of time.

Obviously then अनृत would mean that which does not have the force of reality and hence could not not stand the test of time and hence withered away.
