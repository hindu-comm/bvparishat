This is exactly the reverse of the views expressed so far on Ritam- Satyam relation.

  

All the traditional commentaries such as the SaayaNa bhaashya and all the contemporary writings have understood Ritam to be 'paaramaarthika' in the traditional parlance or cosmic, absolute etc. in the contemporary parlance.

  

Let us see if there is a lexical or semantic confusion here.

  

There are many words which are used to denote the general /broader category and its subcategory at the same time.

  

Satyam is one such.

  

Satyam, the broader category is used in classifying expressions such as vyaavahaarika satyam and paaramaarthika satyam. 'satyam' in both these expressions refers to the broader category.

  

When it is said that 'satyam' is vyaavahaarikasatyam, the word satyam in- 'satyam' is - refers to the subcategory of the broader category 'satyam'.

  

When Ritam vadishyaami and satyam vadishyaami are placed side by side, 'satyam' in satyam vadishyaami is the subcategory.

  

When the bhaashyakaara is using the word satyam as part of the samaasas vyaavahaarikasatyam and paaramaarthikasatyam , he is using it to refer to the broader category of which , satyam in satyam vadishyaami is a subcategory.

  

ritam in ritam vadishyaami and satyam in satyam vadishyaami , both refer to subcategories.

  

This is about the semantics of the word satyam used in the explanations.

  

But the point explained in these explanations is that ritam refers to The TRUTH, The only truth, without scope for a plural of it; satyam refers to truth with a scope for a plural 'truths'.

  

It is not even a mass-weight type distinction.

  

It takes us to the level of a distinction between reference frame bound law of nature and reference frame free law of nature. Reference frame bound observations and the laws of nature arrived at from those observations are all truths. If at all one believes in the possibility of a fact or law of nature not bound by any reference frame or valid in all reference frames, there is a word to refer to that fact, law of nature or truth which is THE Fact, THE Law of nature, THE Truth. That word is ritam. One could say that there is no such fact or law of nature not bound by any reference frame or valid in all reference frames. Then one can say ritam is not there. But there is a word available to say that. That is ritam. All brahmavaadins are ritavaadins too. They believe thatthere is such fact or law of nature not bound by any reference frame or valid in all reference frames; they call it ritam.
