Namaste Prof. Patturi,

  

I am also traveling, and hence will await for your  

understanding.

  

In the mean time to make my point clear.

  

Can some one tell me why Shankara insisted on "jagata" being FALSE, NOT TRUE.

  

To me anything that changes cannot be the ultimate TRUTH (satya).  

  

As I understand it,

  

a. All manifestations are subject to change.  

  

May that be "WHATEVER", including knowledge the primary tool for acquisition of knowledge.  

  

We well continue only if we agree on this baseline.

  

I totally agree with Sayana's commentary that follows Shankara as pointed out by Dr H.N. Bhat. I will come to that point and clarify my position after we establish this baseline.  

  

Thx

  

Dr Yadu.
