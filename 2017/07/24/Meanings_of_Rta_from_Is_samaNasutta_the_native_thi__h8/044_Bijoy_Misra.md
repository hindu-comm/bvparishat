Nagarajji,

What I wrote is purely based on my understanding of the use of the word in Rgveda.

i do see where the composite viewpoint could be.

I readऋत as the originally created field in whichसत्य exists. It gives the possibility

of multiple universes and a lot more yet to be brought into cognition.

So I use the English word "causality".

Best regards,

BM
