In the Taittiriya Upanishad occurs the shanti paatha where we have Rtam vadishyami, satyam vadishyami..In the commentary, Shankaracharya says:

  

ऋतंयथाशास्त्रं यथाकर्तव्यं बुद्धौ सुपरिनिश्चितमर्थं त्वदधीनत्वात् त्वामेव वदिष्यामि ;सत्यमिति स एव वाक्कायाभ्यां सम्पाद्यमानः, सोऽपि त्वदधीन एव सम्पाद्यत इति त्वामेव सत्यं वदिष्यमि..

  

According to this, Rtam is that truth based on the scripture, existing at the mental, intellectual level. Satyam is that very truth expressed by word and deed. Thus both are the very same truth but with avasthaabheda. It could be compared roughly to the madhyamaa and vaikharii stages of vaak. Rtam is unmanifest truth and Satyam is manifest truth.
