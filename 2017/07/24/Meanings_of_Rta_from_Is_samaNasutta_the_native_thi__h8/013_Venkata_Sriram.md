Namaste,

  

Few months back, there was a vidvat sadas and veda bhASya was discussed by famous vedic scholars like Mahamahopadhyaya Vishnubhatla Subramanya Ghanapati and Shri.Narendra Kapre Ji whom I know personally.

  

The expressed a grave situation which is currently being observed.
People, without studying the basic Sanskrit, without being thorough with vyAkaraNa, nirukta & chandas, are trying to venture out commentaries to mantra-bhAga (which is a-paurSeya) as per their own whims & fancies. Let them twist the kAvyAs as per their own theories but not veda mantra bhAga which requires traditional grounding under sampradAya teacher for a span of almost 16 years !

  

regs,

sriram
