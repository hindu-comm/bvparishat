One other view from ChandOgya Upanishad: 4-2-5

5.  Tani ha va etani triny-akasarani satiyam iti, tad-yat sattad-amrtam,
    atha yat-ti tan-martyam, atha yad-yam tenobhe yacchati yad-anenobhe
    yacchati tasmad-yam, ahar-ahar-va evam vit svargam lokam eti.

Again here we have the usual symbolic meaning of the word*satyam,*etymologically derived. What is*satyam? Satyam*is, says the Upanishad, a word which can be dissected into three syllables-*sa, ti,*and*yam -*and from the point of view of this interpretation of the Upanishad,*sa,*the first letter, stands for what is immortal; the second one*ti*stands for what is mortal, and*yam,*the third one, is that which holds the two together.
