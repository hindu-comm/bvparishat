Shri Harsh Wardhan is right.  

  

It is well known the root is ऋ = movement. As Sri Aurobindo put it "Rtam is Truth in Movement" i.e. as implied by *"yaathaa-tathyato arthaan vyadaghaat shaasvatibhya samaabhyah* in Isha Upanishad. Please see this entire mantra beginning with *sa paryagaat*. Note the echo of the RV mantras in sukta RV(1.22) *vishnu vicakrame* in the Isha mantra *sa paryagaat*  

  

Satyam is the Supreme Being, Brahman etc. from which Rtam proceeds. Rtam is a fraction of the infinite Knowledge, Consciousness and Shakti of the Supreme and consequently is also Satyam. Yajna is also called Rtam because the Veda mantra employed has its origin the *parame vyoman* RV (1.164.39) and hence is imbued with Rtam and has the capacity to bring about *ishta siddhi* in this Universe.  

  

Rtam is also used a synonym of Satyam in Samhita.  

  

thanks.
