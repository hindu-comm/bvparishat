Sorry for joining back late into the discussion. (I was away teaching)

  

Aayushmaan Sriram-ji,

  

You have choices:

  

1\. Make the Vedabhashya-knowing scholars join the list and answer the questions from the list members.

  

2\. Take the questions from the list to them and come back with the answers.

  

3\. Observe the discussions in the list.

  

............................

  

Coming to the discussions in the list, list members try to refer to various sources, some of which flow from some authentic Veda Bhashya material only.

  

In spite of all, modern interpretations of Veda mantras, deviating from the traditional ones to some or a great extent, like those of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, founder of Arya Samaj, Sri Aurobindo etc. keep, taking place.

  

A good attempt to link contemporary understanding with the ancient authorities is the ideal being pursued by most of the members.
