Sri Yadu ji,

  

From my understanding of Advaita, I think Sri Adi Sankara is said to adhere to a strict interpretation of mayavada. In his view, everything is Brahman, and Brahman is everlasting, unchanging, etc, so there's no scope for a Jagat to exist. It's all Brahman only, nothing else is there.

  

Based on this conclusion, the only logical way to resolve the daily experience of the manifest world is to classify it as a falsity. There is no other option if you go to the logical end of the assertion that Sarvam is Brahman. Jagat cannot be anything but mithya in this viewpoint.

  

So, in my view, Sankara resolved the paradox of manifested world vs the unchanging Brahman by going to the extreme end that logic leads to.

  

Therefore, Sankara does not even accept the existence of a manifest world, calling its experience and perception an error.

  

This is my understanding. Apologies if this is incomplete.

  

Regards

Harsha
