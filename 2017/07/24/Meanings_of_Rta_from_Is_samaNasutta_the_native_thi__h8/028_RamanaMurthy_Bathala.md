Dear Sir,

I do not know grammmar of sanskrit. I am just a learner, in fact ab infant learner.

In RamaKrishna Math, everyday evening there will be Arati (TwiLight Service) to Bhagavan Sri Rama Krishna. In that service , one of the song goes like this:

ॐ ह्रीं ऋतं त्वमचलो गुणजिद्‌ गुणेड्यो नक्तंदिवं सकरुणं तव पादपद्मम्‌ ।

मोहङ्कषं बहुकृतं न भजे यतोअहं तस्मात्त्वमेव शरणं मम दीनबंधो ।।1।। etc…

  

This song was written by Swamy Vivekananda himSelf. He described Sri Rama krishna as ऋतं.

I have two books which give word to word meaning of all the Arati Songs recited in the RamaKrshna Math. These books are published by Ramakrishna Math. I am trying to copy a few relevant pages related to the word ऋतं.

The following is from book titled “ARATI SONGS”[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uf7odDvEIlg/WX9NBHFASAI/AAAAAAAABHw/tNgztduQe8gvspJbaDqIIBvxX0rVzbTIgCLcBGAs/s1600/r1.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uf7odDvEIlg/WX9NBHFASAI/AAAAAAAABHw/tNgztduQe8gvspJbaDqIIBvxX0rVzbTIgCLcBGAs/s1600/r1.png)[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aUaLd-JieWE/WX9NTzWhr8I/AAAAAAAABH0/jH-ERArNN0oZL0rPhaFM7iIHJFm4CsUxQCLcBGAs/s1600/r2.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aUaLd-JieWE/WX9NTzWhr8I/AAAAAAAABH0/jH-ERArNN0oZL0rPhaFM7iIHJFm4CsUxQCLcBGAs/s1600/r2.png)[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-psfTbuTutjM/WX9NcwT5pLI/AAAAAAAABH4/F9FmbelS4iMASuiys3XlEKjQ-PisQz-CwCLcBGAs/s1600/r3.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-psfTbuTutjM/WX9NcwT5pLI/AAAAAAAABH4/F9FmbelS4iMASuiys3XlEKjQ-PisQz-CwCLcBGAs/s1600/r3.png)
