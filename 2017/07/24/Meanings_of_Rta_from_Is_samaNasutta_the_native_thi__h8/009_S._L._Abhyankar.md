Dr. Moharir,

  

I copy-pasted meanings of ऋ, not because people would not know it, but to bring all shades of meaning at one glance.

  

Actually I am confused at the phrase "from Is samaNasutta" in the title.

  

It is not clear, whether you meantगणपत्यथर्वशीर्षम् bysamaNasutta ?!

  

Obviously, in the mention ofऋतं वच्मि and सत्यं वच्मि, meaning ofऋतं is distinctly different from that of सत्यम्. So, I proposed my interpretation.

  

Now coming to other part of the title, "before the "daiva" logic expanded..", how does one know which logic was "before" and which one "after". There is mention of दैवम् in 18'14 of गीता "दैवं चैवात्र पञ्चमम्". There, it is one of the सर्वकर्मणां सिद्धये पञ्चैतानि कारणानि (18'13). So what meaning do we assign toदैवम् in that context ?

  

So, to my mind, your question combines getting to understand meaning of not onlyऋत but also ofदैव.
