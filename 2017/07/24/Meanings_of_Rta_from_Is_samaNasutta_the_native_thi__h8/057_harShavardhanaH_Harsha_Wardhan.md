Respected Scholars,

  

I am weighing in with my viewpoint.

  

The discussion here seems to be revolving on this point - Which is the first principle and which is it's derivative/characteristic -ऋतं or सत्यं?

  

The issue has some shadesof the old Nyaya-Bauddha debates on the issue of substance vs quality/attribute -

  

- Whether substance can exist without qualities or can qualities exist without substance? Whether qualities determinesubstance (making quality the primary principle) or whether substance determines quality (making substance the first principle)?

  

- How areऋतं and सत्यं related to each other, if they are not the same?Isऋतं that of whichसत्यं is an attribute, or isसत्यं the thing from whichऋतं emerged?

  

It depends on how you define the words and frame the meaning.

  

The Vedas are infallible because they are based on the truth. The truth is that there is a first principle from which all comes and into which all goes. Is this first principle, the Sat (in the sense of being/existing)ऋतं or सत्यं?  
  
Again, it depends on which word you give primacy to.

  

This makes me think thatऋतं and सत्यं are two ways of defining the same principle. They are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. Like the apocryphal blind men of 'indostan, we seem be grappling with parts, and missing the whole.

  

Perhapsऋतं and सत्यंrefer to a concept that language is not equipped to properlydelineate.

  

regards

Harsha
