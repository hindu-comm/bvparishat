Namaste

  

1\. Nice to See Dr. Krishna Kashyap bringing in Panditaratnam KSV's observations on 'Satya'. Surely the entire book in Samskruth brining out the original thinking from traditional point of view is a pleasure to read.

  

2\. Coming back to the primary issue- Why Two Terms -'Rutam and Satyam', if they mean the same thing ? - Maybesome more references worth exploring here, again getting back to the starting question : What is/are the meaning/s of the term ' Rutam' ?

Given the multiple shades and contexts, how justified are the translators limiting to mean ' absolute Truth' only ?

  

Illustrations of usage:

  

(Rigveda - Aghamarshana Sutra -extract from Mahanarayana Upanishad) -

Thanks in advance for the clarifications on term meaning.
