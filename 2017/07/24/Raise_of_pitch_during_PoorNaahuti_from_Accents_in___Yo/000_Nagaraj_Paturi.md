Namaste

  

In aHomayou may notice the frequency pitch of the Mantras will increase sharply for the Poornahuti. The ending Mantra for Poornahuti will have very high frequency. It feels like the priests are almost screaming in high pitch. Was this a rule in the ancient Yaagas or recent? What is the reason for increasing frequency so much?

Increasing the pitch during पूर्णाहुति appeals to be a well-thought out concept. If the attention span of the audience would have diminished towards the end of the याग, increasing the pitch would be a way to rejuvenate the attention of the audience

This discussion is a digression from the ASU discussion.

  

Let us be careful with the words pitch, frequency etc.

  

Both svaras within an octave (such as mandra, madhya, taaraa ) and the octaves themselves and the the voice types voice ranges (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_type>) such as tenor, dass etc. are issues of frequency. Loudness is amplitude.

  

ASU, as Prof. Iyengar reminded from the books on history of Indian music, is an issue related to svaras within an octave.

  

Voice range issue that is being pointed out here can be discussed as a different thread.
