Jana Gana Mana was adopted as the National Anthem of India by the Constituent Assembly of India on 24 January, 1950. This fact is contained in the procedings of the Consntituent Assembly which says as follows:  
  
"Mr. President: There is one matter which has been pending for discussion, namely the question of the National Anthem. At one time it was thought that the matter might be brought up before the House and a decision taken by the House by way of a resolution. But it has been felt that, instead of taking a formal decision by means of a resolution, it is better if I make a statement with regard to the National Anthem. Accordingly I make this statement.

The composition consisting of the words and music known as Jana Gana Mana is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the Government may authorise as occasion arises; and the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it. (Applause). I hope this will satisfy the Members."

Saying that another song will have the same status does not imply that this is also the national anthem.

Orders of the Government of India about the national anthem can also be seen in the following link. The orders clearly state Jana Gana Mana as the national anthem.

Calling any other song as the national anthem of India can be interpreted as sedition, as it is tantamount to declaring oneself or one's group as a separate nation.  

Tamil Nadu has its own patriotic song but it is called Tamil Thai Vazhthu. It can be heard on the following link.

If a person calls this as his national song, he can be booked for sedition, because calling it his national anthem is tantamount to declaring himself as separate nation.  

You can call any song as your anthem, but not national anthem. For example, when a World Tamil Conference was conducted in Coimbatore, the following song was presented as Tamizh Semmozhi Anthem. But calling it national anthem would change the meaning:
