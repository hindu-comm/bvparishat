Respected scholars,

  

I am trying to get a copy of the writings of Sri Sabhapati Swami, the distinguished Tamil yogi and saint of the 19th century.

  

He is said to have written two books on the practical aspects of yoga.

  

Could you let me know if his book ***Om: The Cosmic Psychological Spiritual Philosophy and Science of Communion***, is available in pdf form anywhere? I have tried the usual digital archives but cannot find it.

  

I would appreciate any help you could provide in this matter.

  

with regards

Harsha
