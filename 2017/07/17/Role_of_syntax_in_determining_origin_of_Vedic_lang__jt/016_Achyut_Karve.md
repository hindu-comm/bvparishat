Dear Mishraji,

  

You have made the right point. Has any Indian or have Indians studied and published any book or article on the languages of the tribals. It is the lack of indigeneous work that is helping foreign intellectuals to foist their theories on to us. A detailed study of tribal languages will surely help evolve a theory challenging the existing one. 

  

Historically classifying letters is a process which is taken at hand after all the letters of a language have been identified and are put to use in building the vocabulary of a language. Every species is endowed with unique organs of communication and so is man. To believe that a particular population in a given geographical area learnt or evolved a language from a source outside the geographical area is stunning revelation especially when India still holds a sizable tribal population which has maintained its lingual and cultural identity. Is there any information that those who migrated out of Africa in sizable numbers carried with them any language. Even today immigrants who wish to migrate to Europe from Africa prefer to cross the Mediterranean rather than migrate by land. India has a long history of trading with the communities on the Eastern Coast of Africa. In fact even Vasco-da-gama was navigated from the Eastern Coast of Africa to India by traders
inhabiting the Eastern Coast of Africa. Even Buddhism spread to the East and Far East via sea routes.

  

I feel that a lot of indigeneous work needs to be done in this sphere and this requires funds which are meagre.

  

Theories proposed by the West are not sacred cows. They need to be intrepreted to context. Unless we carry out indigeneous research we will be left with no alternative but to buy their theories. In the absence of indigeneous workthese Western theories have been institutionalized into our institutions and hence to rout them out is no easy task. 

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
