For the easy access of the members, I am attaching here the bibliography on Sanskrit Syntax prepared jointly by me and Professor Hock and published in a volume edited by him. There is an updated version of this bibliography published in a more recent volume on Sanskrit Syntax edited by Hans Hock and Peter Scharf, but I don't have a pdf of it at the moment.
