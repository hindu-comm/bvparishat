Max Mueller starts with the assumption of "barbarian" India even never visiting.

The assumption becomes that the Vedas must be imported. The development

is complicated. Some people lately realize the pseudo-theories, but we need

full fieldwork and analysis. There is some work on Santali language.
Michael

Witzel here has compiled the non-IE words in the Vedas. Though we have

general evidence that the Vedas were composed in the greater Punjab area,

we don't have a full reconstruction. Madhavji may say more since he has

worked a lot in the area.

  

Please do investigate the sounds and symbols in the original hill languages.

it could lead to whole new discoveries. But you need to prepare yourself on  

the basics of words, grammar, neurology and speech sciences.
