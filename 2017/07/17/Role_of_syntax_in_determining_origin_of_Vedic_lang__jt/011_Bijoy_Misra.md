Achyutji,

  

While your questions are worthwhile, the efforts needed to dig into the linguistic

variations are enormous. The origin of Vedic language is still an open

question. PIE bases itself on some people carrying a language with them,

and this part has no convincing evidence nor any relevance.

  

If you have time, please do study the interior hill languages. The Vedas talk about

stories which have be tracked in the local cultures. The whole Narmada valley upto

Jharkhand could be a fertile area for study. I recommend a book by Frank Southworth

entitled "Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia".  

  

I am not aware of research into pre-Vedic languages in India. It is required. Jaina

literature talks about them, but not in a scientific manner. We need an analytic

examination.

  

Best regards,

BM
