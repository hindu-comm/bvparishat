During our school days (1954 around) the 7th standard exam used to be called as "Vernacular final" exam. We started learning English only in 8th standard. Until then the medium was "Vernacular". I guess the meaning was that the medium was of languages, which had वर्ण as the premium thought, (hence vernacular. ?)
