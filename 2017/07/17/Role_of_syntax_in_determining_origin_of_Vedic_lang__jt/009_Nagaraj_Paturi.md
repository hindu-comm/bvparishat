Sri Achyut Karve-ji,

  

You seem to have a great fire in you to fight the presently established theory (theories) tracing the origin of Vaidika or laukika Samskritam to a re-constructed proto-Indo-European.

  

That passion and motivation is highly laudable.

  

But the other side is very strongly established with highly intricate theorization covering vast data.

  

Please patiently go through the whole stuff and then counter them with your data and arguments.

  

It needs training in the methodology of Historical Linguistics.

  

You may even challenge the validity of Historical Linguistics itself. But for that you need to go into the philosophical foundations on which that discipline is based.

  

Western Indology is strongly anchored to and centred around Historical-Critical method.

  

One may refuse to get into that method itself.

  

Let us take traditional Sanskrit scholars and Vedic scholars who are either not aware of or not interested in (following ) the Historical-Critical method or Historical Linguistics.

  

In what way does it affect/reduce the quality of their study of Sanskrit or the Vedas?

  

The quality or rigour required or measured in your study depends on the questions that you address in your study. The qulity or rigour of study of a traditional scholar who is not interested in Historical-Critical or Historical Linguistic questions at all is not affected by his not being aware of or not employing the methods of those approaches or disciplines.

  

But if you are interested in countering Historical-Critical or Historical Linguistic claims of those following or interested in those approaches, then you are bound to follow the history of ideas of their claims historically critically.

  

No claim is a final word.

  

You may be able to shake the foundations of the present claims in Historical Linguistics of Vaidika and Laukika Samskritam such as Samskritam has its origin in proto-Indo-Eropean. But you can do it only if you get trained in the method of that discipline and study the present body of knowledge around the Vedas and Sanskrit.

  

What do you want to do? Get into the method and fight from within? or Question the validity of the method/discipline itself? or Ignore the method/discipline itself and focus on the huge number of valid, interesting topics that are not bound to the method/discipline?
