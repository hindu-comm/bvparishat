Dear Paturiji,

  

I live nearly seventy km. away from Mumbai in Thane District. Northern Thane District is house to the Varli Tribe whereas Southern Thane District to the Thakur tribe. The whole of Thane District is also house to the Katkari tribe. It would be great field work. If you have any collegues in Mumbai you can connect them to me. I will not only help them but also take keen interest in the field work.

  

These tribes maintain their unique language through generations.  This is only possible on account of their unique way of articulation of speech.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
