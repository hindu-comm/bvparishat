Dear Scholars,

In the process of partition migration took place in large numbers from Sind, Punjab and east Bengal. In the course of the past 70 years in fact it is their language that show mutations and not the other way round. A detailed research into the nature of the shift in their language will surely give a clue either in favour or against established theories regarding origin of the vedic language.

These migrations took place in families and hence they were in a position to maintain their original tongue. However in the case of vedic and post vedic times migrations were of invading people mostly men who then mingled into the population through hybridisation. This is the main reason why Indians show ethnic mix up. In such circumstances to believe that such invading people were behind the composition of the Vedas is hard to believe. Languages are generally preserved through the mother.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
