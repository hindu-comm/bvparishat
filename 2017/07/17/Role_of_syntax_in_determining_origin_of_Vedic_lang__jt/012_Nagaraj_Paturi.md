Dear Sri Achyut Karve-ji,

  

If you can provide the location and other details of these languages, I can ask my colleagues in linguistics located in a University closer to the location(s) to look into the information so that verification of past work on them and visiting them for fieldwork, if not yet studied, will be easier.
