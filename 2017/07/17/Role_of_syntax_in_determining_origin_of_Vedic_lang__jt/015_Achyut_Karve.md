Dear Paturiji,

  

It is really astonishing that you have put your finger at the right point. Yes, I am a die hard convert to the conception that the Vedic language is indigenous. Having been educated in a convent school,
being the son of convent educated parents and having an angliced accent I learnt Marathi which accidentally was my mother tongue. 

  

As I had to learn my mother tongue in adulthood I was in a position compare the English tongue with the Marathi tongue. In the course of time I realized that the mode of articulation of these two tongues was different. English is not written as it is spoken however that is not the case with Marathi or for that matter any other Indian Language.

  

The Tabla took me to the level of letters. The Maheshwar Sutras helped me to decipher each of them.

  

I cannot think of any other language outside India that can present letters in the form and sequence that have been presented in the Maheshwar Sutras. The reason that they could be presented in the form presented in the Maheshwar Sutras can be no other than that the phonation of Vedic Sanskrit was unique. 

  

I am in contact with tribals (Katkari and Thakurs) for the past 15 years and can see that these languages share letters as well articulation process similar to that of Sanskrit, they voice consonants plosively, the diaphragmatic air expulsion mechanism i.e., phonation with the help of the naval (नाभी प्रयत्न), intonated vowels and the samhita form of speech i.e., each sentence is spoken without breaks.

  

I value your comments very much. I am also aware that the task ahead is uphill. However, I am equally committed to squash this myth that Vedic Sanskrit has been imported. On the contrary migration of people into India has only helped mutate the chaste tongues that we had. The most recent example is the effect of English on our regional languages. 

  

Tribal languages have remained stable over time because these tribes populated romote areas, had a way of life independent of the mass of population and were not influenced by other formal languages or tongues spoken by various castes.

  

Being a Marxist I do have a sound base into the method and hence the barrage of questions that I am putting forth.

  

I would feel obliged if you help me in this endeavour.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
