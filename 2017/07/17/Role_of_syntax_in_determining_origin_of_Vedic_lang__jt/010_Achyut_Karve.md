Dear Paturiji,

Do you have research students pursuing study of tribal languages. Two tribal languages Viz., Thakur and katkari languages are such that they are spoken in the same areas but have contrasting consonant articulation.

If any student is interested I can help.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
