Dear Shri Karve,

  

  There is almost 200 years of research on Vedic texts, language, phonology, syntax and all other aspects. A good place to begin is to look at the bibliography on Vedic syntax in the book by Hans Hock. A link to this book has been provided by Professor Paturi. This extensive bibliography was compiled jointly by me and Professor Hock. It is not possible to summarize this vast research in an email message.
