\>Astrology as a business to take advantage of the vulnerable people bothers me.

  

--- Your title to the thread is "local news". Post was a link to a news. That was proved to be a rumour/joke meant to caricature. Thus any discussion other than the news or the stereotyping in it is

  

either a digression

  

or an obstinate sticking to the falseimpression of'"Astrology as a business to take advantage of the vulnerable people" being done officially by the government' intended to be created by the false news

  

or attempt to bring the theme of "Astrology as a business to take advantage of the vulnerable people" into discussion with the pretext of local news.

  

samaNasuttam or your study of it can be a new topic for a new thread.

  

If "Astrology as a business to take advantage of the vulnerable people" was intended to be discussed , the title 'local news' or the link to the news was not the proper way to do it.
