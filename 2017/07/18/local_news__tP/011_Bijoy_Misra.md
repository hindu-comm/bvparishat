Nagarajji,

  

I am not against anything. People have a right to practice what they like.

Astrology as a business to take advantage of the vulnerable people bothers me.

  

The reason I am studying SamaNasuttam is to place it in time. I am toying the

thought that the development of Jainistic thoughts could be pre-vedic. it has

possibly to do with the discovery of the role of the senses in human construction,

what they do and what are they supposed to do? This has link to our

thinking here on the neurobiology of emotion. 

  

Best regards,

BM
