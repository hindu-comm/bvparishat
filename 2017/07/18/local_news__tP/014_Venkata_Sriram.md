Namaste Harsha ji,

  

If one turns on the news channels in the morning, one would find all the self-styled soothsayers, astrologers, numerologists, therapists who have made our jyothishya shAstra (the eye of veda puruSa) a laughing stock.


  

Unfortunately, this wrong information is polluting the young minds as well as gullible viewers and they are under the impression that this is info which is there is our vedas. 

  

Giving emphasis on 'puruSa-prayatna' is good but to what extent is the question. There is also a 'prArabdha' which plays pivotal role.  Our revered member Prof.Korada Ji who himself is a great jyotiSya vidvAn is the right person to answer.

  

regs,

sriram
