Nagarajji,  
  
I have no difficulty if someone predicts the future, that is also science.  

I loved the samaNasuttam since it talks about individual accountability,  

and I call that as the first principles. The question is the discovery  

of the cause of our failures inside of us than looking outside.
Hanuman  
is not watching the stars before he leaps. He waits for the evening in  
Lanka not for auspiciousness but to take advantage of darkness. To me  
these are first principles. There is a strong element of personal sincerity  
and truthfulness built into the process. The question is if these are naturally  

evolved human traits as part of being more functional and strategic.  
  

When we look beyond our means, we invoke stars. Hanuman's  

journey to Lanka is different than Rama's journey to Lanka. Hanuman's  

journey is open-ended. Once we think open-ended, the stars probably  
have no role (they have no choice than to align to support the cause!).  

We succeed through truth (if we hold onto truth). There is no "win"  

or "loss". "Truth" triumphs.  

  

In the west, "truth" is a prescription and not a realization. Hence  

the play gets relative. I am in "truth" is different than I "win". The west  

is consumed with "wins" and "losses" and who is "first" etc. Truth  

has no "first", it just exists. This is the Jaina discovery, eventually adopted  

to Vedanta as I see. Thoreau in the west understood it. But politically  

the society wants to create a system of vanity than equality. One has  

to create relative truth to justify the actions of slavery, subjugation and  
violence.  

  
"Truth" may not transcend beyond the individual. It is not clear if  

it would manifest the same to all, as Patanjali would suggest.  

The trick is to be functional while holding on to the truth.
SriKrishna's  

analysis has relevance in this context.  

  

Many modern Jainas might argue differently!  They would say Truth is  

calling Mahavir as Bhagavan. SamaNasuttam ends with those statements  
possibly for political reasons! Let me study more.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
