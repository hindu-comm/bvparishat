My previous post and your present post have gone in two different directions.

  

My post did not support or oppose predictive/horoscopic astrology. It was focusing on stereotyping 'Hindus' as superstitious. The news you shared in your thread initiating post was a joke by an anti-BJP journalist , who was trying to make fun of the pro-'Hindu' approach of the BJP by creating a false news caricaturing the BJP goverment in Madhya Pradesh. You wanted to know whether the approach described in the joke was forward or backward. Prof. Kannan exposed the rumour value in the 'news'.

  

You are continuing the stereotyping based forward - backward discussion by telling us how much you are against fate-centric thinking and so on.

  

I am focusing on stereotyping itself.

  

Let me remind you that there was a discussion on BVP on the Daiva-Purushakaara question.

  

I said in

This debate between daiva (fate) and purushakaara (human effort) is the most relevant and important debate in this context. In the western philosophy it takes the form of fate and free will debate. Daivavaadis (fatalists), those who say daiva only works not purushakaara, are the ones who make society nishkriyaapara.



Vaidika texts including itihaasas and puraaNas encourage human effort while recognizing daiva fully.

  

Prof. Rani quoted:

  

दैवमात्मकृतं विद्यात्कर्म यत्पौर्वदैहिकम्।

स्मृत: पुरुषकारस्तु क्रियते यदिहापरम्॥

बलाबलविशेषोऽस्ति तयोरपि च कर्मणॊ:।

दैवं पुरुषकारेण दुर्बलं ह्युपहन्यते।

दैवेन चेतरत्कर्म विशिष्टेनोपहन्यते॥ 

  

Many references can be quoted to show that 'Hindu' scriptures always supported purushakaara (human effort) while not discounting daiva.
