Aayushmaan SriRam-ji,

  

Prof. Korada-ji has already said what he has to say on this in his post

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/nVrb0C85oR4/pMRRdD09LgAJ>  

  

and some other posts.

  

I am already having hard time handling digression from the "local news" theme.

  

Please help me by not bringing new digressions.

  

Thanks,

  

Regards,
