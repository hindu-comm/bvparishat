Relief!

Most India TV programming abroad is supported by astrologers.

Many half-baked soothsayers have a field day taking advantage of the

stressful life of the immigrants. The native-born in the west and the

far east spend money in gambling and people from South Asia spend

money in reading the stars. It is a huge unregulated industry!
