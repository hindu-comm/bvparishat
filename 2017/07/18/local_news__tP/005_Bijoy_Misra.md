They exist. In certain inner city and tourist areas, they have store front operations.  

I had seen a store in Cambridge possibly catering to the new arrivals.  

Sometimes they have psychics.  
Back home it appears as a part of the main stream.  

I think there is a belief that conjugal stress is connected to the stars.  

Lately the temples in the US are also becoming big business centers.  

Like the churches, people do notice human vulnerability and create religious service to pacify the pains of living..  
  

Lately I am reading a book called SamaNasuttam, a compilation of Jaina teachings  

published in 1993. It is in old Prakrit, they call Ardhamagadhi. The style and logic  
are extremely refreshing. It does not look like a "reaction" as is taught in history  
books. I wonder if it was the native thinking before the "daiva" logic expanded itself  

in India. I invite Jaina scholars in the group to get in touch privately for possible exchange.  

Traits like accountability and attitude are powerful and scientific. It can  

become too lonely!  

  

Best regards,
