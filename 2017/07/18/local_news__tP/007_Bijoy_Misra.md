Nagarajji,  
These are later additions, where the philosophy is used to create dogma.  

The book I am referring is pure first principles, anyone can experiment.  

One just observes oneself and not externally. A shramaNa has seasons,  
but no stars.  

The question is if the cosmology of man is deterministic or conditional.  

These early Jaina philosophers invoke determinism, but they do get into  
trouble to find closures. Dying (allowing one to decay) possibly  

cannot be assumed as a design of life. Vedanta could be a compromise.  

I am just a student, but I love their analysis. We ask "what is forgiveness?"  

and "who forgives?"  

Best regards,
