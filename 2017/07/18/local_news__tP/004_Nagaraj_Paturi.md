"The profession of astrology is advancing rapidly. More and more people are recognizing that astrology provides valuable insight into the complexity of 21st century living. Our members need to be professionally prepared to meet the demand for astrological services. There are number of universities which offer graduation and post graduation in astrology. There are also certificate programs which provide short term courses in astrology. Apart from this the ISAR (International Society for Astrological RESEARCH) provides resources for members to advance their skills including its CAP (Certified Astrological Professional) program. The program includes education/training, consulting skills, and ethics. In establishing the educational requirements for ISAR Certification, educators from top astrology schools around the world have been consulted. Many of their recommendations have been incorporated into this program."

Due to the various possible outlets for remuneration, and the fact that most astrologers work in a freelance capacity, the extent of earnings varies greatly. Some practitioners work on a one-to-one client-based method where customers pay the astrologer for a reading. Normally the astrologer will offer the first session at a low rate (or occasionally free) in order to convince the client to use them on a regular basis. Rates vary, but can range up to £130 per hour for a renowned and well-established astrologer. Others earn their core wage by writing horoscopes for a publication. Again, rates can vary considerably, but a daily slot with a local newspaper can net around £6000 per year, or significantly more for a national newspaper. Magazines that feature horoscopes tend to be weekly publications, but the rate of pay can be decent with a popular colour magazine; you can work on around £90-£100 per horoscope or \`article'.
