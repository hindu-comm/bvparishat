There is a whole debate nowadays on Indology list and other Indological circles whether what is (being ) called as Vedic Astrology is Vedic or not. Their argument is that predictive astrology is not Vedic in origin, it is Hellenistic in origin. (Some of our respected friends shared dais with them to support them in these arguments.) Fine, let us agree with them, for a moment, for the sake of argument (why, I have no hesitation in agreeing with them even not for the sake of argument) that predictive/horoscopic astrology is not Vedic in origin and is Hellenistic originally. But what is its import? They are saying that Vedanga Jyotisha was not predictive/horoscopic astrology. If predictive astrology is 'superstitious', what they are saying is that you were not superstitious in regard to your astronomical understanding, it is we who taught you the 'superstitious' aspects of it.

  

If you want to talk of first principles, Prof. Misra, they are telling you that you didn't have it in your first principles.You imported it from us. We now say that they were non-superstitious by nature. (You didn't say that). There was a highly celebrated modern Telugu writer by name Gurajada Apparao , who in one his short stories(1910-14), describes Indians to be extremely superstitious and all the British characters, officials of the government, are archaeologically knowledgeable capable of identifying Gaandhaara sculpture in a Buddha statue being worshipped as Siva and so on. This is a sample of how we enjoy stereotyping 'Hindus' to be superstitious and western people to be scientific.( This author , in one of his lyrical poems, unequivocally says, " The English are skillful in being able to see the nature of things that is not visible (from outside)" . We have the above mentioned attitude of Gurajada Apparao amongst us even 100 years later, today.

  

They say, not having predictive/horoscopic astrology in first principles was Vedic. We say that it was Jain.

  

Let us now go into the question of why western astrologers and Indologists focusing on astrology are so hell bent on proving predictive astrology to be Hellenistic in origin not Vedic in origin, particularly now. Is it not connected to the huge market for and money involved in the service-business of predictive/horoscopic astrology? Is the 'Vedic' tag question not connected to the competition among brands of astrology in the western market where the western astrologers have their stakes?
