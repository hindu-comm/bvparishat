Dear scholars,  
  

Greetings from Manipal University Press!  
  
There is no better way of reaching out to the world with our intellectual output other than translation.  
  
Manipal University Press (MUP) invites proposals for publication of translation works. Presently, MUP has two types of translations being brought out at regular intervals. One set of them is under the series - *Indian Literature in Translation* and another is *Traditional Indian Texts in Translation*. Quality translation of important works in regional languages and Sanskrit are being brought out under these series.  
  
Those interested in publishing with MUP may write to [edito...@manipal.edu]() for the proposal form or for any other details.  
  
MUP is an academic publishing house and a sister institution of Manipal University and is governed by the MAHE trust. It is regularly bringing out reference books, translations, scientific manuals, journals, etc. Since its first book in 2011, MUP has come a long way in six years and has brought out over 100 publications.  
  
MUP also offers editing services to first-time authors and researchers at a nominal price. The Design and Production Division also offers support in bringing out conference proceedings etc.  
  
You can visit our [website](http://mup.manipal.edu) for more details.  
  
Regards,  
  
Dr Arjuna S R
