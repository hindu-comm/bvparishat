Namaskar Sir,  

Yes Sir we have referred that book and also some other books. The introduction of some of the lexicons are very informative also. Mr. Patkar has dealt more on the commentaries on Amarakosa. I think these Hindi books may throw light on some new lexicons and also to have a complete study, we need to have all the reference books.  

with regards  

Mamata
