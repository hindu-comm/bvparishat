Namaste,

  

 I can't find an edition of Atharvaveda in Unicode, that I can copypaste and reuse with accents in devanagari. At<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/1_sam/avs_acu.htm> there is a text in transliteration, but I have no converter for vedic accents.<http://www.onlineved.com/atharva-ved/?language=1&kand=18&sukt=4&mantra=42> seems interesting, but the text is a picture.

  

Thanks,

Marcis
