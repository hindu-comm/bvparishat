Dear Scholars,

  

Is the Phalashruti फलश्रुति of the Vedas in the meaning or in the recitation? Patanjali in his Mahabhashya says that one recitation of the Maheshwar Sutras is eqivalent to one recitation of the Vedas. Thus one will naturally ask as to what is the main purpose of recitation of the Vedas.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
