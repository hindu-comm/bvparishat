To Sri Phani B -ji: The reference is in the Marathi commentary to Patanjali's Mahabhashya sentences.

  

To Sri Achut-ji:

  

The Marathi commentator is neatly giving all the steps involved in the process of learning Maheshwara sutras leading to the phala of reciting the Vedas.

  

He says,it is the saadhus'abdajnaana resulting from the maaheshwara sootraant shabdajnaana (vyaakaraNajnaana) that leads to the puNyaphala equivalent in amount to the puNyaphala of recitation of Veda.  

  

That said, these expressions of equivalent in puNyaphala never actually mean what they appear to say in words. It is just to instruct /motivate people towards tings like maaheshwara sootraant shabdajnaana (vyaakaraNajnaana) that they mention these equivalences, not to instruct to give up the 'equivalent' actions.
