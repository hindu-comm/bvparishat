Respected scholars,

  

How is the concept of "rta" related to the relatively later concepts of "dharma" and "karma"?

  

If we go to the speculations of the ancient Indians, are there any other concepts that are the progenitors of the concept of karma? To the best of my knowledge, karma has its origins in the law of cause and effect that old rishis discovered. Samkhya is the oldest system that builds upon the concept of karma and gave rise to yoga. Later, in the Mahabharata, we find the Gita again giving great prominence to this concept.

  

with regards

Harsha
