Respected scholars,

  

I am tying to gain an understanding of the etymological meanings of the phonetical sounds that constitute the samsktit alphabet. Each letter in the alphabet (and its basic phonetical derivations) has an etymological meaning, and I am very curious as to who and how was the original mapping (that is, building of relation) between letter and meaning done.

  

For ex, off the top of my head, "ra" means "movement, upwards", "gu" is darkness,"ru" means "remover". "dhi" means "intelligence", derived from "dha" meaning foundation (presumably). There are numerous examples worth citing, but my knowledge is limited in this respect.

  

But I am curious - how was the letter-meaning mapping done? Is there an etymological list of the samskrit alphabet with meanings attached to each letter of the alphabet?

  

Could you kindly direct me to any works (books, website etc) that can throw more light on this matter?  

  

with regards

Harsha
