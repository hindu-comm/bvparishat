Dear Harsha Wardhanji,

  

This is to draw your kind attention to the following points relating to the study of names:

  

The need of studies on names and the methods to be followed were discussed at an international conference held at Tübingen in 1931. In this field, there is an organization named International Council of Onomastic Sciences (erstwhileInternational Committee of Onomastic Sciences, 1949-1993) maintaining contacts among onomasticians and furthering the studies at international level since 1993.

  

Betty Heimann, in her article "Zur indischen Namenkunde",*Studia Indo-Iranica*(Leipzig 1931), lays stress on the meaningfulness of Indian names.In 1938, J. A. van Velze in his book *Names of Persons in Early Sanskrit Literature* (Utrecht), treated the personal names in Sanskrit inscriptions and older Sanskrit literature including Vedic, Epic, Puranic and grammatical.



In 1978, M .B. Emeneau in his article named "Towards an Onomastics of South Asia" (*Journal of the American Oriental Society*, p.1), discussed issues relating to semantic study of names with special onomastic problems and stressed the necessity of further work on the subject.



F.M. Fenny: ‘Names and Naming’. *The Encyclopedia of Religion* ed. Mircea Eliade, Vol.10, New York: Macmillan Publishers, 1987, p.300-301,
is also worthy to be consulted.



In 2008, Professor Samiran Chandra Chakrabarti wrote a book on *Proper Names of Persons in Vedic Literature*, published by the School of Vedic Studies, Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata-700 050.
