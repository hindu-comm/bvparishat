Hi!

  

1\. Not **all** names are based on Sankrit. Some are derived from languages other than Sanskrit. FBJ Kuiper's (and following him Witzel's) publications deal with the issue. It must be noted that many serious scholars do not agree with Kuiper's methods or results (E.g., Alfred Master, Rahul Peter Das, Manfred Mayrhofer, Thomas Oberlies, and others.)

  

2\. In so far as the present day system of naming is concerned, the tripartite names are a 'gift' of the English. Secondly, the middle name in Gujarat and Maharasthra (which is father's name) has nothing to do with what is understood by middle name in the West. (In German a person may have more than one name. The famous Indologist GeorgeBühler's full name isJohann GeorgBühler, whereJohann Georg is his first names (Vorname) and Georg is is common name (Rufname).)

Elsewhere in India, if I am not mistaken, father's name does not appear. R. C. Majumdar for instance stands for Ramesh Chandra Majumdar or S. K. Chatterjee or Suniti Kumar Chatterjee, and so on. In the south the naming practice is quite different. In Gujarat (and presumably in Maharashtra also), there was no concept of surname; and even if people had one they were not used.

  

For the rest, I do not know much except that patronyms (Rama Dasharathi) and metronyms (Lakshmana Saumitri) were in vogue. For the latter, Sarvadaman Singh (*Polyandry in AncientIndia*) has an interesting hypothesis, which I also reach independently.

  

Kane's essay in the IHQ (14: 239 ff. which I have not read) can be consulted. And in case you can read German, the following will be useful.

Best,

H.
