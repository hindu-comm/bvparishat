Respected scholars,

  

I am trying to get an understanding of the names and naming conventions of vedic and post-vedic India. When I read the scriptures, I always find myself pleasantly surprised by the names occurring in them.

  

Here are a few questions on this issue:

  

1\. Though all names in the vedas and the puranas are based on samskrit, I find the older names to be quite different from the later ones. For example, the names of rishis and kings in the Upanishads are all unique, without a parallel. Whereas the names of kings and rishis in the ramayana, mahabharata and the puranas seem somewhat similar (in that they are compound names, have a gramatically-derived meaning). Can any light be thrown upon this area?

  

2\. Were mononymous names like vasistha, yajnavalkya, vyasa, suka, common? How about polynyms with a first name, middle name and surname, as is now prevalent in these times?  

  

3\. What were the favoured or popular names of the vedic period?  

  

4\. Was it common to give multiple names to a single person? I am not referring to derived or clan names like kaunteya or pandava, but other ones, based on characteristics, exploits or given at birth.

  

5\. How were cities named?

  

6\. Were women's names changed after marriage in those times?

  

7\. Did astrology have anything to do with naming people and cities?

  

I'd appreciate your kind responses on this matter.

  

with regards

Harsha
