Re Point #7 about astrology and personal names, Alfons Hilka does deal with it. While the book mostly deals with post Vedic names, it's a very systematic treatment. I feel it may be generally useful to anyone interested in the subject of classical Indian personal names. It's also in German unfortunately.

  

The reference is:

  

Hilka, Alfons, 1877-1939:Beiträge zur Kenntnis der indischen Namengebung : die altindischen Personennamen.(Breslau : M. & H. Marcus, 1910)
