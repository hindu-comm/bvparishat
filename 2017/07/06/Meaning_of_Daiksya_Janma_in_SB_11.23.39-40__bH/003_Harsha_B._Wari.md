The correct number of the verse is 10.23.39/40.

  

Daiksyajanma according to Sanatana goswami'scommentary is: "*yajnAdi dIkshA sambandhi janma*", Sri Vamshidhara as "*devadIkshArUpam*" and Sri Vallabhacharya as "*yAjnikarUpam janma*".

  

Srila Jiva Goswami writes:*yajna* (through *Daiksya janma*)is meant to be performed to please the Supreme Lord Sri Hari "*aham hi sarva yajnanam bhokta ca prabhureva ca* (Bg 9.24)". Brahmanasdespised all the three births, that is: their own birth in a Brahmana family; second birth - savitrabirth i.e., through upanayana; and third birth that is initiation in performing *yajnas* (vedicfire sacrifices). The reason was that all even with all these three births only illusion and pride bereft of the understanding that it is all meant for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Thus Sri Suka described them as "*bAlisha vrddhamAninaH*" i.e.,Though presuming themselves advanced in Vedic learning, they were actually inexperienced fools.
