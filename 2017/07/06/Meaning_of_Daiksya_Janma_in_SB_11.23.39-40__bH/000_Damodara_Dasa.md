Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Vidvajjanas,  
  
dhig janma nas tri-vrd yat tad  
dhig vratam dhig bahu-jnat채m  
dhik kulam dhik kriy채-d채ksyam  
vimukh채 ye tv adhoksaje  
SB 11.23.39/40  
  
I came across this sloka in Bhagavatam that describes three janmas and  
acaryas explain that they are 1) Birth of body 2) Upanayana & 3)  
Daiksya Janma.  
  
First two I know but I am not very clear about the third Daiksya  
janma. This diksa has a different guru from what is had at the time of  
initiation and to whom one is surrendered in gurukula?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara das
