\>We have to define if Ramayana is a social document,

historical document, religious document or a piece of creative  

literature. We can say it to be "all of the above" and the young is  

free to reject the statement.  If we analyze and categorize we might  
have have better luck in engagement.

  

                           -Prof. Bijoy Misra

  

The present young generation (as predicted by Sri Aurobindo long ago) is for more intelligent than the previous generations. They are not only able to receive intricate understandings defying compartmentalized categorizations but are even enjoying such new ideas and are proud to face their world with such view-changing ideas. Particularly Indian descent children will be excited to boast such unique identity vis-a-vis their other American peers.
