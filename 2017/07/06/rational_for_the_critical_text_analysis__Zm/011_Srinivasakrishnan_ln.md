This is rather revealing. I see the same in the context of Vedantists and non/anti Vedantists going beyond scoring points against each other. Agamic Hinduism is no different, with its written texts, elaborate exegetical traditions and emphasis on a frequently jealous all powerful male god (with a devi tagged on as an apologetic appendage), the devi being completely subsumed in the heart or on the left side of the male god's body.  
  

Consequently, it seems we have our own brand of fanaticism.
