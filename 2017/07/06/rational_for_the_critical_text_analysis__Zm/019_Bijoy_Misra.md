Nagarajji,  
  

The western views are based on "finding" history.  

The assumption is that a document depicts events in the past.  

Simulations are done on the basis of documents to recreate history.  

My view is that the India context is based on legends that are  

built up through folk literature. Hence to simulate history of India  

through textual analysis could be (is!) in error.  
  

That there would be a whole group of new people of Indian descent  

living in the US was unknown just forty years ago. We as  

parents are searching for material that we can furnish to our children  

and grandchildren. The education process has been set up to depict  
India differently than a person of India would like. These are political  
issues. Nobody even thought of educating children when they arrived.  

  

I do not know how the youth in India deals with their educational  

process. We have to define if Ramayana is a social document,  

historical document, religious document or a piece of creative  

literature. We can say it to be "all of the above" and the young is  

free to reject the statement.  If we analyze and categorize we might  
have have better luck in engagement.  
  

I have taken Ramayana as a piece of creative literature for my  

own efforts and understanding. I have not studied Mahabharata.  

I am thinking on it for future work. I chose the Gita Press  

version of Ramayana for my work. In my looking for the Mahabharata  

text I was directed to this thread. I will keep looking.  
  
Dr Mamata Dash in the list has just the articles that Dr Iyengar  
recommended. I will study. I love the camaraderie in the group.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
