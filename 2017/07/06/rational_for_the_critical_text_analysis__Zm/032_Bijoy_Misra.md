Recitation of individual वर्ण would not lead to the language diction.  

it would come when we say them together in a phrase. The technical  

term is संहात where individual voice would play a role.Through संहात  

meanings and melody would develop. The exact science is not  

studied yet. Individual वर्ण articulation in Sanskrit or other Indian  

languages would play a role. The process may not be detectable  

in non-phonetic languages like English.
