\>I would very much appreciate any help

in Sanskrit textual analysis undertaken by the scholars in India.

  

There are various members in the list who are stalwarts (like Prof. Ashok Aklujkar) in the field of Textual Criticism of Sanskrit texts.

  

All of us (including myself) were trained as part of our Post graduate and research level courses, professionally in the field of textual criticism. We in our long careers in the field of literature did textual criticism of manuscripts, reviewed/ critiqued that of others, participated in bringing out critical editions.

  

In fact, a large part of early modern literature research in India was preoccupied if not obsessed with textual criticism only.

  

Each of the publications of texts of hundreds if not thousands of books had long introductions with textual critical notes all by Indian literature scholars only.

  

On BVP , there have been 105 threads covering manuscriptology, some announcing training in the field, some discussing the field and so on.

  

I am sorry to be quoting your first post verbatim:

  

Dear friends,  

I am not very conversant with the documentary literature.  
I have used English texts and translations only when needed.  

For the past two days I am looking in web to find a document that  

might enunciate the rational for a "critical" manuscript.  

Please let me know if anyone has a reference for an epic.  
If it is a hardcopy book, I might find in our libraries here.  

Best regards,  

BM

  

After a few posts by me suitable to this, you gave us the clarification:

  

I wanted a statement (essay/book) by the Indian scholars on the local  

thinking of "critical".  

  

which was not coming out through the first post.

  

Later, you explained source of your curiosity by narrating :

  

Twenty five years ago, I led the Harvard project  
of digitizing scholarly materials for creating digital library.  
I was exposed to the issues of textual analysis at that time.  
Harvard research is text based and people do take enormous  
interest in preserving texts. I did interact with Prof Greg Nagy  

on Greek oral literature. I learned about scribe extrapolations.

  

and so on.

  

Even your latest

  

"I would very much appreciate any help

in Sanskrit textual analysis undertaken by the scholars in India."

  

does not lead to 

  

1.Critical Text editing in ancient India ( J. Sanskrit Academy, Usmania Univ 1979)

2.Canons of textual criticism in Medieval India (J.Dayananda vidyapeetha 1988)

  

If these were the kind of books I was looking, I would have said,

  

I would very much appreciate any help

in Sanskrit textual analysis undertaken by the ***ancient or medieval*** scholars in India.

  

I apologize for not being able to get this meaning from your first post or the later ones.
