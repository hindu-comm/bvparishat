One more personal confession I must make.

I am allergic to historical interpretation of text.

To me it is totally engineered by the Church and I reject the approach entirely.

A folk tale is not a myth nor it is history. It is what people believe, it is an imaginary narrative.

It possibly rolls.

  

Asian Games is happening in Bhubaneswar. Somebody sent me a recording of Shankar Mahdevan

singing an old Oriya folk song. I saw how the folk part of it can be slaughtered by improper appreciation.

It may be happening worldwide! It is the diction that makes poetry.
