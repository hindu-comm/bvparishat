Prof Paturi,

  

A minor excursus: does TTD make it mandatory not to publish the year of publication anywhere in the book? This is not the first such dateless book of theirs that I have encountered. (Or is a page missing?)

  

One will have to work out the date of the book by ascertaining the tenure of Mr Prasad IAS!
