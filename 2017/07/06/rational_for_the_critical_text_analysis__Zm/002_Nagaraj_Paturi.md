"The textual critic's ultimate objective is the production of a "critical edition".This contains the text that the author has determined most closely approximates the original, and is accompanied by an*apparatus criticus*orcritical apparatus. The critical apparatus presents the author's work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations calledsigla); second, the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating); and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference)."  

  

1. We have the traditional Sanskrit words such as pATha, pAThAntara used in reference to orally transmitted texts too.

  

'variants' in the above passage comes close topAThAntara.

  

I heard traditional purohits using words like hispATha is like that, mine is different and so on.

  

That shows that the traditional scholars were variant-conscious and allowed variants. 

  

2. The third of the above passage,

  

a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).  

  

may help those looking for a better variant on a different basis than the editor's.
