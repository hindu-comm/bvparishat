Nagarajji,  
  
I am sorry. Twenty five years ago, I led the Harvard project  
of digitizing scholarly materials for creating digital library.  
I was exposed to the issues of textual analysis at that time.  
Harvard research is text based and people do take enormous  
interest in preserving texts. I did interact with Prof Greg Nagy  

on Greek oral literature. I learned about scribe extrapolations.  

  
At that time, I was also interacting with late Swami Sarvagatananda  
([www.swamisarvagatananda.org](http://www.swamisarvagatananda.org)) in Ramakrishna Mission where I  
learned about the grammatical parsing of Brahmasutra in making  
various "advaita" streams. I have not examined how the analysis  
was done. This however caused me to give time to Sanskrit studies.  
  
After 2001 terror episode, I was invited to be a part of an interfaith  
group when I learned about the Christian traditions through textual  
analysis. There I learned how fanaticism is bred through text analysis.  

People have enormous "faith" on written word in a book. This was  

a revelation to me. I would be quized about Hindu words and my  

long-winded explanations were only heard and forgotten. People  

expected binary analysis.  
  

This in short is my background in the current curiosity. I have formed  

an opinion that the human thinking is concept-based and not word-based.  

Words are limited and confining. All words are local conversions.
The  

human process is semantic than lexical. Words are only approximate.  

We add metaphors, context, embellishments to convey our thought.  

While as scientists we look at external world in analysis, for the language  
we must look internally.  
  

Hence my stress in melody. Melody is the intermediate between thought  

and expression. I am distracting from my question. But I thought I should  

clarify my internal confusion. I would very much appreciate any help  

in Sanskrit textual analysis undertaken by the scholars in India.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
