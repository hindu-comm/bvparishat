Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

The word 'critic' has a broader meaning. What you probably mean is the 'textual critic'.

  

1\. Critiquing the existing approach to textual criticism: suggesting Dharma criterion or Kaavyatva criterion in place of the purely documentational criteria is well taken. Critiques of textual criticism from similar points of view have been there in the west too. A well argued Indian critique based on Indian insider's perspectives will be welcome.

  

2\. Critics in general (other than textual critics) have done enormous work in the form of bringing out the poetic beauties of these Sanskrit works.

  

As a general note, when we enter into discussing ideas that belong to disciplines such as linguistics, literary criticism etc.,that have been the full time long career professions of many co-members of our forum, and the disciplines and the contributions of co-members of our forum have been huge in size, detail and intricacy,expecting that the wheel would have already been invented in the fields makes us sound sensible. It is at least as sensible as a member from these fields such as linguistics or literary criticism expecting that his 'new' 'contributions' to topics belonging to fields such as Physics could most probably have been already invented wheels in those fields.
