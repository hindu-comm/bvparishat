Dear friends,  

I am not very conversant with the documentary literature.  
I have used English texts and translations only when needed.  

For the past two days I am looking in web to find a document that  

might enunciate the rational for a "critical" manuscript.  

Please let me know if anyone has a reference for an epic.  
If it is a hardcopy book, I might find in our libraries here.  

Best regards,  

BM
