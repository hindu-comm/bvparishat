I spent some time today in reading Sukthankar further.  

He analyzes the problems of text comparison.  

Bur he does not articulate a motivation. He refers to  

some request by Winteritz which I have to check.  

The assumption that Mahabharata was retained as  

a religious text might be incorrect. The bards could  

be performing (improvising) than reciting from memory.  

The last part is my personal speculation of retention  

of secular literature, unlike the Vedas etc. A recitation  

lineage would not die (my opinion), a live performance  

could alter it.  

Question:  

Besides the Gita is Mahabharata used in religious service in India?
