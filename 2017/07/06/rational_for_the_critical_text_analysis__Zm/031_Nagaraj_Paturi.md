" Were the Vedas composed for rituals? When were they put to use in rituals and for what purpose?

Is the significance of the Vedas not beyond the purpose to which they were put?

And what was the purpose for which they were primarily composed? ''

                                   
    - Sri Achyut Karve

  

Let me convert your interrogatives into their underlying declaratives.

" Vedas were not composed for rituals. They were put to use in rituals at a later time. Significance of Vedas is beyond the purpose to which they are put. They were primarily composed for a different purpose than ritual. ''

  

Sri Achyut-ji,

Vedas were not 'çomposed'. They were Seen/Heard.

There can not be intentions for such Seeing /Hearing.

You seem to mean Yajna by your ' ritual' .

Yajna is not (just) a ritual. Right from the earliest Veda mantra that was Seen/Heard, Yajna was part of the ideas contained in the Vedas. Just as the Vedas were Seen/Heard, Yajna was also Seen/Heard. Veda itself says that the Yajna performed by the dEvAh was the model emulated by humans. yajnEna yajnamayajanta dEvAh. tAni dharmANi prathamAnyAsan.

Veda-Yajna relation is as old as the Vedas themselves. That relation is mutual, intricate, inseparable .

You might want to read the chapter on Yajna in

Neither Veda nor Yajna have got to do with religion.
