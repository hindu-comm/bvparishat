Dear Mishraji,

If you really feel that it is diction that predominantly matters in poetry with which I personally agree you should move to the Maheshwar Sutras to get the right diction.

Unlike poetry in other languages Sanskrit poetry or verse if you may say so is not sung but recited. In other words Sanskrit Poetry is a metered form of prose. It's chaste recitation is said to give release.

However Patanjali referring to those who can recite well but are not good at its shastra and those who know the shastra but cannot recite remarks that neither are fit for release. According to Patanjali one needs to know both thoroughly.

This is an arduous task and we can just hope that we become one of those fortunate ones to achieve it and subsequently breathe a sigh of relief.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
