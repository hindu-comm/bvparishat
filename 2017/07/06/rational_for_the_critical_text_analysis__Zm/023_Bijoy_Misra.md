Nagarajji,

As always, you are a mine of information.

Most of India possibly has to be reinterpreted from the first principles to engage the youth.

Glossy books and trash literature are flooding the market..

Slogans are not solutions.

Times are changing pretty fast!

I will study more.

Best regards,

BM
