'secular'-'religious'division itself , as a mutually exclusive binary, is alien to Indian context.

  

As such, compartmentalising Vedas as 'religious' and Mahabharata etc. as non-religious does not suit Indian context.

  

'Religious' 'service' too is not suited to Indian context.

  

Parts and/or whole of Mahabharata are 'sung' , or read out in purANa pravachana in temples.

  

Parts and/or whole of Mahabharata are read as paaraayaNa (reading, often silently, for acquiring puNya or as a kaamya ritual.  

  

There are Dharmaraja temples and Draupadi temples in south India.

  

Alf Hiltebeitel covers these among other things in his four volume book on the Cult of Draupadi.
