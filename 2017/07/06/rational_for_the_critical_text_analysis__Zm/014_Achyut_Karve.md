I do not know how much the following poetry will address the question that Mishraji is trying hard to present. The poetry reads thus:-

You ask me what words can do;  
Words cannot a pebble move.

Words are they when they hold their sway;  
Bring to life the past each day.

In as much as words describe reality they are strictly governed by the grammar of that particular language. This aspect of language is usually used in communication and science. However there is an aspect of language which describes the internal reality of man which is generally referred to as experience. This is usually expressed in poetry. It is this aspect of language that Bijoy Mishraji is hooked on.

This aspect of poetry can only be experienced.

Indian poetry especially that of Sanskrit according to Mishraji needs to be addressed from a point beyond reason.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
