Fanaticism is a function of the words.  

Some years ago, I was giving a talk on "Hindu Prayers" in a Benedictine monastery.  

A Divinity School student did pop up and asked "What language does God speak?"  

My answer "God has no language" stunned him, but he did sit down!  
  

The event happened in 2003 in local Glastonbury Abbey <http://www.glastonburyabbey.org/>  

in their series "Listening to Other Voices".
