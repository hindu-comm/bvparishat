Your first did not have anything indicating 'by the Indian scholars on the local  
thinking of "critical".'

  

It in fact, uses the word "Critical manuscript"

  

There can not be a critical manuscript.

  

There can only be a cirtical edition of a text based on its various manuscripts.

  

Now that we know that you are looking for an Indian response to or critique of the "critical edition" concept, members may now be able to help you .
