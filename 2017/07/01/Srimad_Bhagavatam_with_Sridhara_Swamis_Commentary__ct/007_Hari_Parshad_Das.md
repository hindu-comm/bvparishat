Thank you so much again shankara ji for the links. I will download them too.  
  

I know this may perhaps be asking for too much but of someone has the Srimad Bhagavatam with anvaya, padaccheda and hindi anuvaad and would be willing to share, then it would be great. It was published by Sri Krishna Janmasthaan Seva Sansthaan and is out of print for long time. The translator is Sudarshan Singh 'Chakra'.  
  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  

hari parshad das.
