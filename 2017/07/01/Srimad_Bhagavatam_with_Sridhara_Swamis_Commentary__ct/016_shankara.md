Hari Parshad Das ji,

  

The skandhas 4 & 5 you had shared are in fact Vol 3 of the Bhagavata with translation of Dayakanti Devi, not that Sudarshan Singh Chakra (This was pointed out to me by BVP member Jaya Prakash).  

  

Vols 1 to 4 & 7 of Dayakanti Devi's translations are now available at

regards  
shankara
