Really nice. Thank you so much Shankara ji for posting these links. Thank you also to the volunteers at the Swami Akhandananda Granthalaya for scanning these books.

  

Shankara ji, parts 3 and 4 of this collection were missing/ These two volumes contained skandhas 4 , 5 and 6.

  

I have uploaded skandha 4 to :<https://www.dropbox.com/s/ru4bnn5g1uexnbz/skandha_04.pdf?dl=0> and skandha 5 to :<https://www.dropbox.com/s/4434kfkggva9epy/skandha_05.pdf?dl=0>

  

This is not a very high quality scan and maybe a page or two is missing from Skandha 4 and a Chapter is missing from Skandha 5. Still it is better than having nothing. I got these from a sadhu in Vrindavan.

  

**Can you please upload these volumes to archive for everyone's benefit?** Thank you for the immensely valuable service that you are rendering to all the vidvaj-janas here.

  

Now the only remaining skandha is the 6th one. Until someone finds that volume of Chakra ji, there is another anvaya done by Śrīmatī Dayākānti Devī. It can be found at :<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.273609/mode/2up>

  

Also I noticed something else. The scans of the Sudarshan Singh Chakra edition done by the Swami Akhandananda Granthalaya and the ones i have uploaded now to dropbox have a certain difference. The former does not have the translation (only anvaya is shown) whereas the latter also writes down the translation separately. Maybe this is because of a difference of editions. If some vidvan can find all the editions and scan them in color, then it will be a great service to all relishers of the Bhāgavata.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,

  

hari pārṣada dāsa.
