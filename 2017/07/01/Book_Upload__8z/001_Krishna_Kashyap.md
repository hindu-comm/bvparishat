I have a general question regarding digitizing manuscripts.

  

Is there a service available which digitizes or scans the original manuscripts and gives back content in some PDF or similar form? will they send back the original manuscripts if we mail it to them or hand carry them? how much does this service cost.? is this service available both in India / USA. what is the cost difference? can it be uploaded to [archive.org](http://archive.org) or some other area for storage? any help is deeply appreciated.
