Thank you Diwakar ji

  

I think the Himalayan Academy translation is the same as Dr Natarajan's.

  

I am aware of Marshall Govindan's work (Kriya Yoga). However, my interest is only in the third tantra concerning yoga, while the publishers sell the full set.

  

I was hoping to check if some other translations are also available.

  

regards

Harsha
