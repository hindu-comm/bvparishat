Respected Scholars,

  

The Thirumantiram is an important Tamil Saiva Siddhanta text authored by Sri Thrumular, a contemporary of Patanjali.

  

His work includes an original exposition of Yoga in the third tantra of the total nine tantras/divisions of the sacred work.

  

I know of Dr Natarajan who had translated the entire work some years back, but on reading the translation, I get the impression that the translation is more poetic than literal.

  

If, by any chance, any respected scholar here has another English translation of the said text, I'd be grateful if you could consider sharing it.

  

with regards

Harsha
