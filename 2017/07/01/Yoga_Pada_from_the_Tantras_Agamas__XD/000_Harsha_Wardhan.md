Respected scholars,

  

I am looking for English translations of the Yogapada (Yoga sections) present in various tantras and agamas.

  

Some of these tantras and agamas have been translated into English by a few scholars (Ref. Swami Sivaya Subramaniyaswami/Himalayan Academy, and the Institut Francais de Pondichery) but a major portion remains untranslated.

  

If you have any copy of any published/unpublished English translations of any tantras or agamas, I'd be grateful if you could consider sharing them.

  

with regards,

Harsha
