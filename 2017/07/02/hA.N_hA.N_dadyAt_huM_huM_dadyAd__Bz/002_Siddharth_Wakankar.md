Sir,

  

This verse is(or should I say,was) also very popular in villages and recited during the ceremony of partaking of food.

  

I used to hear this(in the 1950s) in Ujjain and nearby places in Madhya Pradesh also,with a reading : na dadyaat simhagarjane in the last paada. One syllable is missing in the second paada and I am not able to recollect it now,because of a long gap.

  

This is a kind of "floating mass of literature",-traditionally handed down-very popular with members of the learned families.
