Many years ago, while visiting Hawaii, Professor Rama Nath Sharma took me and my wife to dinner. At the dinner, he cited the following verse:

  

परान्नं प्राप्य दुर्बुद्धे मा प्राणेषु दयां कुरु ।

परान्नं दुर्लभं लोके प्राणा: जन्मनि जन्मनि ।।

  

A beautiful floating verse of Sanskrit sense of humor.
