Namaskar.

  

Does anyone know where this verse is from:

  

हाँ हाँ दद्यात् हुं हुं दद्याद् दद्याच्छिरकम्पने।

मौने च द्विगुणं दद्यान्न दद्याद्व्याघ्रझम्पने॥

  

(This is supposed to be an humorous instruction to the server on how to serve food: Keep serving while the diner says हाँ हाँ or हुं हुं or shakes his head. Give twice as much if the diner is silent. But, stop when he jumps like a tiger.)

  

Regards,

  

Sandeep
