Dear list

  

I have started a new short video series on Sanskrit names. In each video, I will pick up a Sanskrit name, give its root(s), and explain it in English. The series is aimed at people having no knowledge of Sanskrit as well as Sanskrit beginners. The aim is to get more and more people interested in Sanskrit by connecting with them over the topic of Indian names.

  

The first video of the series is here. Please share with those who may be interested.

Would like to hear your feedback and suggestions.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
