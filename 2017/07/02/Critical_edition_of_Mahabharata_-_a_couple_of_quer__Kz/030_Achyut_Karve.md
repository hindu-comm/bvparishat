Dear Mishraji,

The study of the compositions of the Classical Tabla entails the study of letters as well padas in the composition sans the meaning which words generally carry in language. It is this study of letters that I have covered in the book titled 'Revealing the Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology'.

This study will surely help in demonstrating the niceties of the Sanskrit language and more specifically the vedic language.

I have already sent you a soft copy of the same. I would like scholars like you to review the book.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
