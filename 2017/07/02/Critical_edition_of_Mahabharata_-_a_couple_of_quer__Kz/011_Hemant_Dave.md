Not to discard anything and preserve everything even at the expense of science and rationality in the name of tradition is dangerous to me. Anyway.

While I don't have much to say on your views regarding sagotra marriage or Indian calendar, I think you may find Sukthankar's following assertions profitable.

  

"To prevent misconception in the mind of the casual reader, it is best to state at first what the constituted text is *not*. \[…\] this edition is *not* anything like the autograph copy of its mythical author, Maharṣi Vyāsa. It is *not* \[…\] a reconstruction of the Ur-Mahābhārata or of the Ur-Bhārata \[…\]. It is also *not* an exact replica of the poem recited by Vaiśampāyana before Janmejaya. It is further wholly uncertain how close it approaches the text of the poem said to be recited by the Sūta (or Sauti) before Śaunaka and the other dwellers of the Naimiṣa forest.

It is but a modest attempt to present ‘*a version of the epic as old as the extant manuscript material will permit us to reach* with some semblance of confidence. It is, in all probability, not the best text of the Great Epic, possible or existing, nor necessarily even a good one. It only claims to be *the most ancient one according to the direct line of transmission*, purer than others in so far as it is free from obvious errors of copying and spurious additions."(1933/1944:128)



As he further wrote:

Also, scholars like Sukthankar, Belvalkar, and indeed scores of other

scholarsafter them

were not "

in awe of, and heavily influenced by, Western scholars

". The project of the CE of the Mbh is itselfa proof. Edgerton was the only scholar to have been invited to participate in the project; the rest were all Indians, that too during the oppressive colonial regime. Sukthankar's scathing reply to Ruben and his Epic Studies

papersin general (see the Memorial edition) or Belvalkar tearing apart R. Otto's theory of stratification of the Bhagvadgita (Journal of University of Bombay, vol. 5, pp. 63ff)

, show no awe or influence.

Yes, the

y

had mastered the method developed in the West, esp. in Germany, but they were strongly rooted in their own soil as well.



  

And, the critical editions (of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) contain the then known manuscript tradition in its entirety--much more than that preserved in Nilakantha--as variant readings, interpolations, etc. in footnotes and appendixes, and without any errors at that (cf. Prolegomena, p. 13). So one can construct the text as one pleases! Thus, the CE is even more 'inclusive' than the Nilakantha-text!
