Hi!

  

Sukthankar spent his lifetime to study the manuscripts of the Mahabharata. The Prolegomena was written after his very minute study of the manuscripts. His method of selecting text was tested and proved to be correct. Except Ruben (who got a deservedly caustic rejoinder from the master) and Lévy (whom Sukthankar dismissed with a tongue-in-cheek remark) all scholars had unanimous praise for Sukthankar's scientific method and his work. Many of these scholars were real giants and had spent good many years in studying the great epic and were master (at the least)oflower criticism.

  

After the sad and untimely demise of Sukthankar, S. K. Belvalkar took charge of the CE of the Mahabharata. Belvalkar was also a very learned and meticulous scholar. It was he who saw Edgerton's edited Sabha Parvan through the press. Edgerton wrote in the Postscript of his Parvan that‘I am confident that his \[scil. Belvalkar's\] scrupulous and intelligent scholarship will come as near to replacing Sukthankar as is humanly possible’. I think these words speaks volumes about Sukthankar's scholarship.

  

It appears from your posts that you did not read Prolegomena before and were not even aware of the method used by Sukthankar. Yet in a single day you seem to have understood his method so much so that you could pronounce a judgementthat '\[s\]ince it is a matter of judgement, I guess I will continue to prefer the judgement of Nilakantha'.

  

Sukthankar had laid down the following rule: ‘On principle \[…\] lines that are peculiar to one recension, *having nothing whatsoever corresponding to them, at the same point, in the other recension*, are to be viewed with grave suspicion. Unless there is overwhelming evidence to prove their originality, they should be treated as spurious’ (1927/1944: 8; original emphasis). He elaborated the same directive in his *Prolegomena*: ‘all lines belonging to one recension only, and *a fortiori* such as pertain to a combination of manuscripts amounting to less than a recension, for which there is nothing corresponding in the other recension and which are not absolutely necessary for the context—all lines, in short, with a defective title—have been placed in the footnotes or the Appendix, pending further inquiry regarding their credentials’ (1933/1944: 120).  

  

Sukthankar, V. S. 1927/1944. Foreword \[to Ādiparvan, Fasc. 1). In P. K. Gode (ed.), *Sukthankar Memorial Edition*, volume I, *Critical Studies in the Mahābhārata*, pp. 1–9. Bombay: Karnatak Publishing House for V. S. Sukthankar Memorial Edition Committee, Pune.

Sukthankar, V. S. 1933/1944. Prolegomena. In P. K. Gode (ed.), *Sukthankar Memorial Edition*, volume I, *Critical Studies in the Mahābhārata*, pp. 10–140. Bombay: Karnatak Publishing House for V. S. Sukthankar Memorial Edition Committee, Pune.

  

The attached file should make clear to you the difference between the Vulgate (Nilakantha's) and the CE. It's a review of Sabhaparva by another titan Emeneau. He discusses just one instance (p. 268), but better informed scholars can provide many more.

  

Of course, one is always free to prefer the text that suits his/her needs.

  

Best,

Hemant
