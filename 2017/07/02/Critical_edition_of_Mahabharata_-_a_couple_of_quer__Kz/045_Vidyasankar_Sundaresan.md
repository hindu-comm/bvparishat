Dear Prof. Rukmani,

  

It is a pleasant surprise to see you on this forum. I will email you a pdf of my PEW paper on the pancIkaraNa.

  

The reference to recaka, kumbhaka and pUraka occurs in the SAnkarabhAshya on gIta verse 4.29, which refers to prANAyAma.

  

I have to reread what I wrote about the bhAmatIkAra's handling of pancIkaraNa and trivRtkaraNa in this paper, to remind myself, but I think I made only a passing reference to Vacaspati Misra. If I had to write up my thoughts on the pancIkaraNa text anew, I would most probably expand upon it and state things quite differently. I think the general impression that the bhAmatI school accepts only the idea of trivRtkaraNa cannot actually be supported. I think that the text of bhAmatI or even kalpataru under brahmasUtra 2.4.20 contain no reason to think that these authors rejected the possibility of pancIkaraNa.

  

Namaskarams,

Vidyasankar
