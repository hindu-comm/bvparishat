My observation is that the same defect continues on to the translation of texts into  

English. The translators study the language and not the poetry. They translate  

from left to right. Poetry is a composition, it is wholesome art. A poet has a thought  

to express and he/she wanders various ways to reach there. Superlatives are poetic  

renditions than literal journalism.  

I did have a discussion with a person here who is engaged in poetry translations in  

the US. He told me that his goal is to bring Indian poetry to the "main stream".  

He discovers myths and legends. He has little interest to appreciate the creativity  

of the poet in presenting the thoughts in words that makes literature.
I gave up.  

To me it is the human element that makes poetry.
