Friends,

I totally agree with Dr Ganesh's observation.  

What has bothered me is the application of the history of Bible copying to the manuscript work in India.

Copying Bible became a political process and it became dogmatic in order to create rules to govern.

(Arab-Isareli conflict continues through Bible analysis.)

I do not know if there is evidence of political distortion of the Mahabharata text in order to suit a king or a culture. 

I am not knowledgeable in the subject. I read some books and essays and they appeared cursory to me.

So I thought to create a forum to help clarify the topic. Substantial differences in northern and southern

manuscripts would not surprise me. My difficulty is if I would label such differences"intentional".

Essays use stronger words which are in rampant use in the western religious documentation literature.

The process of creating the literal "critical" edition is documented in the essays. 

In any case, let me study further and I will report if I discover answers to my confusion. The definition

of character, insecurity, text distortion, manipulation, truthfulness and scholarship are built in to the problem.

From a distance, these terms are of more value than a text itself.

I thank all for having helped me to learn.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
