Sri Hemant Dave

  

Thank you for your lengthy post. I was in fact seeking posts such as yours. My situation is such that I need to decide in a day. Over a period of time I heard criticisms of the critical edition (to the effect that it is based on the judgement of the Editorial team and does not give weight to the received tradition) and have developed the habit of depending on the edition Nilakantha commented. After reading the Mint Article I got the impression that the CE is not what I thought it was and hence, my post.

  

This is not to deny the scholarship of Sri Sukthankar. In fact I am full of admiration of the effort put in by him, but do I accept his world-view? No. Let me give you an example. MM P V Kane was one of the foremost authorities on Dharmasastra in the twentieth century. Yet when a relative asked him about whether a sagotra marriage is alright, the great scholar replied in the affirmative saying that such restrictions were needed to avoid inbreeding at a time of thin populations but not today (narrated to me by one of the members of the Kane family). The published views of MM Kale on such matters are similar. So, I have great admiration for his scholarship and yet I do not accept his positions in matters of following Dharma. It is no coincidence that both Sri Sukthankar and Sri Kane have a strong BORI link (MM Kane was the founding member of BORI donating five acres of land to the institute). To me it seems that the Pune of those years was in awe of, and heavily influenced by, Western scholars (Indologists?).

  

In the extract quoted by you one of the conditions for determining selection is whether something is absolutely necessary for the context. This is a judgement call.

  

The exclusivist approach to critical editing (only that text which exists in all manuscripts is genuine) does great harm to tradition, especially given the way other references by more ancient authors are dismissed. The earliest manuscript available to BORI was 1511 AD, where they bothered to figure out the date (many manuscripts were dated using the cyclic years which the Editors did not consider as any useful dating; only those dated using an era such Vikram samvat were considered to arrive at the date of the manuscripts) but there are many references (easily running into hundreds) from other books established to have been written before 1511 AD, but the Editors dismissed such references as being references to the "local versions" of the epic extant at that time.

  

It is now recognised in Humanities studies that scholars bring their biases to their work and that true objectivity does not obtain. The CE would be a good case study.

  

There has been another great effort by a massive intellect which might be pertinent here. India had an intellectual giant in Physics (Noble Prize level Physicist) - Meghnad Saha - who led an effort to make the Indian calendar scientific. The result is that this Official Calendar of India does not find any traction with people of India. The culprit again was underestimating the hold of tradition in this country.

  

Once again, thanking you for your response,

  

N. Siva Senani
