I am open to correct my impression about Pune and what "seemed" as Western Influence to me. I have the memorial edition. Reading those essays being such a pleasure, I will definitely read them in good time.

  

My whole point is about deciding what "spurious additions" are and the nebulously defined boundaries: it is neither Jayam, nor Bharatam, nor a Mahabharatam which ever existed. While this is the stated status of the text, in practice, Academia treats it as if it were THE Mahabharatam, the most definitive one. In reality it is the view of certain scholars, very learned no doubt, as to what they think ought to be the Mahabharatam. Can such a version be afforded the status of Smriti? No. In fact, I have a hunch, that if we were to ask these Editors whether they are determining what Dharma is (without conflict with Sruti) by editing this, they themselves would be the first to offer profound denials. If we were to put the same question to Arjunamisra, Devabodha or Nilakantha, they would reply that they only said what they understood from their teachers and yes, the work is reliable as a Smriti. The purpose of Mahabharatam, in tradition, is to teach Dharma like a friend would and is not meant to be an object of academic curiosity. If it is studied academically, nobody has an objection (say if somebody offers a course on Principles of Management as per Mahabharatam) but it should not be consulted for knowing Dharma. Society would be better served if people understand the CE to be the "Academic" edition of Mahabharatam. I will take it any day as THE academic edition.

  

Though I am opposed to your views, Sir, I am grateful that you engage for it certainly clarifies my own thinking. And, yes, I do find the views of Sukthankar presented by you very profitable.
