Dear Scholars,

Kudos to those scholars working on the translation on the critical edition into Kannada. I hope scholars of other regional languages take lead and work on translations of the critical edition into other regional languages. Other universities need to emulate the work being done by the Mysore University.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
