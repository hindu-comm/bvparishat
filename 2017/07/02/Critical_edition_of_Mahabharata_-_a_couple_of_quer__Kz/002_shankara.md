Sivasenaniji,

  

In the prolegomena page v, Prof. Sukthankar explains that out of the 235 manuscripts collected for critical edition, nearly half were in Devanagari. I think the author of Livemint article mistook Nandinagari for Devanagari. Out of 235, only 60 manuscripts were actually used for critical edition of Adiparva (page viii & ix of Prolegomena), in which 30 were in Devanagari. Link to Prolegomena is given at the bottom of this mail.  

  

"Of these 235 manuscripts of the Ādi‚ a little less than half (107) are in the Devanāgarī script alone. The other scripts are represented in this collection as follows: Bengali 32, Grantha 31, Telugu 28, Malayālam 26, Nepālī 5, Śāradā 3,1 Maithilī 1, Kannaḍa 1, and Nandināgarī 1."
