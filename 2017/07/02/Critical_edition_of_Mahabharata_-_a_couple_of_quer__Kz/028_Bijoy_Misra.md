As I have tried to suggest before, the researchers must discover the rendering method.  

It is possible the original poet himself/herself was a performer.
Valmiki says that he  
taught how his material would be presented. A story is not a recitation, it is a  

communication. Mapping from the modern days, people try to associate motive or  

sponsorship to creative work. They are wrong, possibly politically motivated.  
They are not poets anyway. A piece of art is not made up, it is the expression of  
creative impulse.  
  

Yesterday we had the Independence Day concert here in Boston. Boston is known  

for its novelty in music. A new composition was featured and was sung.  

The refrain of the song was "Some of us is in you!". At the face of it, the sentence  

may appear meaningless in Chomskyan sense, but it had profound effect while  

rendered in a massive public assembly, declaring inclusiveness. Here is poet  

Alan Menken is singing his previous compositions on piano

In my childhood, we would come to Bombay Shivaji Maidan for the Indian People  

Theaters meetings. Poet Pradeep singing his own composition was always a hit.  

I learned much later how dedicated a poet he was. It is the melody that sticks.  

Melody is possibly an impulse. Somebody has to explore the neurology of prosody.  

As Viswanath Kaviraj says (sAhitya darapNa), it could be a pure joyful connection to  
one's thoughts.
