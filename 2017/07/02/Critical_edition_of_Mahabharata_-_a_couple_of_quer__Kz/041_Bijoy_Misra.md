Thank you, Nagarajji. This is a good tutorial on the process.  
It is like how a history text might be written. People try their best.  
The process perhaps assumes that there is a single-author  
text. or that we assume to extrapolate the text at a certain point in time.  
I do see words like "spurious" and "fraudulent" in the essays.  
These words are used freely in the literature in Indology, that had bothered me.  
I need to study further for my own understanding before I can make  

a statement.  

Two more general questions:  
Has the "critical edition" replaced the texts in circulation?  

What has been the field experience?  

  

PS. On a lighter note, we are in the Trump age in the US!
