I do not want to give the impression of the thread being closed in a tone of biased in favor of the Critical Edition.

  

1\. The issue of translations of the Critical Edition was what lead Dr Sivasenani-ji to start the discussion. The project discussed in the article to which link was provided by Sivasenani-ji in his thread-initiating post is a project aiming to translate the left out variants and other footnote material of the Critical Edition. The points made by Prof. James Hegarty in justification of the project may be useful for the projects of Indian language translations of Critical Edition also. 

  

2\. The point made by Sivasenani-ji seems to be that the pre-modern commentators of MB did not look for the original verses composed by the original author as much as they looked for the verses that had Ekavaakyataa with the remaining verses in terms of the spirit of the book, i.e., (Vaidika ) Dharma. For them all the verses having such Ekavaakyataa are deemed to be of Vyaasa only. Vyaasa, for them need not necessarily be a single or multiple individual author(s). For them, Vyaasa is the name given to the principle of the integral composition of the work that is responsible for the Ekavaakyataa, working through single or multiple author(s).

  

3\. Prof. Bijoy Misra's point seems to be similar . But the criterion of unity that compels overlooking the criterion ofthe original verses composed by the original author seems to be, in stead of (Vaidika) Dharma, some aesthetic quality such as 'melody'. Ethics and Aesthetics was a pair in ancient Greek philosophy. If Sivasenani-ji seeks the criterion of one of the pair, Prof. Misra seeks the criterion of the other.

  

4\. Prof. Vishwa Adluri too is talking of the Ekavaakyataa in the name of unity.

  

This is just to remove the possible apprehensions of bias in favor of Critical Edition.

  

Closure of the thread stands as it is.
