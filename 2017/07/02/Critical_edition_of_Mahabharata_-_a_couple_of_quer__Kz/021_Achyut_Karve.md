Does any of the world languages have anything of the sort of abstract poetry. I am a student of the tabla and find that it is made up of letters which are put into the form of a metre. The composition in itself has no literal meaning. This has a long drawn tradition through the pakhwaj.

The sheer number of metres in Indian poetry should open the eyes of critics that a poetic form of expression in Indian languages and particularly in Sanskrit is far beyond the meaning that the verse intends to express.
