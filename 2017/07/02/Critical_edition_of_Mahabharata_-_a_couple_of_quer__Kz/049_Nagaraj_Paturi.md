"Is the critical edition available in all Indian languages, which will make the work accessible to students and parents alike?"

  

                                   
          --- Sri Achyut Karve

  

  

"Any other rendition in any other language would be a translation. Scholars could, for example, work on critical editions of Kamba Ramayana, Nannayya Mahabharata, Potana Bhagavata or Tulsidas Ramacaritamanasa. It is quite possible that there are variant readings of these works too, preserved in different manuscript transmission lines, but each of these critical editions will necessarily be in the original languages of the respective texts, not in Bengali or Marathi or Kannada or contemporary Hindi. Translating these other works into other Indian languages would be worthy projects, whether from a popular perspective or a popular one, but these would be different from working on critical editions of these texts."

  

                                   
                 ---- Dr Vidyasankar Sundaresan

  

Sri Achyut-ji.

  

The Critical Edition is a modern product.

  

It is Critical Edition of MB , a book in Sanskrit, printed in Devanagari script.

  

What do you mean by being available in all Indian languages?

  

1. Do you mean to ask if the Sanskrit text as per the Critical Edition is published in various Indian scripts ?

  

or

  

2. Do you want to know if thethe Sanskrit text as per the Critical Edition is translated into various Indian languages ?

  

What Dr Vidyasankar Sundaresan-ji mentioned is not the post-Critical Edition translations of MB.

  

He was mentioning the transcreations /retellings of various Itihasa puranas in various Indian languages centuries earlier to the Critical Edition.

  

He was telling that after the advent of printing technology, even these transcreations /retellings of various Itihasa puranas in various Indian languages composed centuries earlier to the Critical Edition, lead to the question of which of the various manuscripts of each of these books should be brought into printed form. Then Critical Editions of each of theseIndian languagetranscreations /retellings were prepared after consulting various manuscripts of each of them.

  

------------------

  

Your worry seems to be that a parent or teacher may not use a certain portion of MB while instructing children thinking that that portion is not in MB as per the Critical Edition. 

  

To this, Dr Vidyasankar-ji is saying,

  

"Even two hundred years ago, when family elders were very familiar with the material and retold itihAsa purANa accounts as stories to children, they would rely upon their own memories of what was told to them when they themselves were children, not upon manuscripts. It was truly personal smRti that provided the material for this."

  

'But today, if the teachers or parents would like to consult MB, the Critical Edition does provide the opportunity to see the variants left out by providing them in the foot notes' is what Dr Sundaresan-ji is saying.
