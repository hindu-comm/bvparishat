In 19th and 20th century before independence INC was the only visible and official platform available to Indian nationalists (both so called hard liners and soft liners). Beyond that platform there were "revolutionaries" and Pune and Maharashtra had no dearth of them either. The point here is: being eclectic without abandoning the core values is a strength rather than a weakness. In fact I will not use the word "influence" because it is being given a negative connotation here though there is nothing wrong in a positive influence.
