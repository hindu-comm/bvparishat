Ma'am, Shankara ji

  

Thank you for the pointers.

  

The abundance of manuscripts in Devanagari has been clearly missed by the Mint essayist.

  

Regarding the other point, I understand that the "critical apparatus" of the learned scholar V S Sukhtankar seems to be a subject of study by itself. I get the clear sense that he was an active editor, passing judgement on various textual segments and making a choice based on considerations significantly different from whether or not the lines under consideration occur in the highest number of manuscripts. To start with, from all the manuscripts available, representative manuscripts were selected. So, the rarer Kashmiri and Nepali manuscripts have representation and weight equal to the text commented upon by Nilakantha, which seems to be nearly ten times as popular (from the evidence of manuscripts available to BORI, which itself might or might not be a representative sample). Even here, it is not as if evidence from majority of manuscripts is always considered. The one good thing is that the learned editor was forthright about it and did not try to gloss over the fact that he used his judgement, as much as Nilakantha might have. I will reproduce but one sample, for lack of time.

  

While making a very erudite comparison between Northern and Southern versions (which paints a very convincing portrayal that a simpler Northern version was embellished with additions in the Southern version), the Editor says (p. xli in the Prolegomena to the Adiparva) "passage No. 78 gives, in 119 lines, the details of a fight, which, in the Northern recension, at least originally, is disposed of in two lines! The latter I consider adequate treatment, taking everything into consideration"

  

If anything, this is an example of the Editor's milder remarks.

  

Since it is a matter of judgement, I guess I will continue to prefer the judgement of Nilakantha.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
