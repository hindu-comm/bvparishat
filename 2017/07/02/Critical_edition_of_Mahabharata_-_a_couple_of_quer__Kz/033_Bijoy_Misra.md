You should study the rational behind the project.

For the western researchers, the goal is comparative mythology or trying to search identity.

Hence the plot becomes the issue.

You may investigate the local thought processes in the journey.

Being hung up on the cultural issues in the story bothers me.

I would appreciate more research on the style, metaphors, melody and rendering.

  

Hanuman gets poetic to witness Lanka in the evening. From the story point of
