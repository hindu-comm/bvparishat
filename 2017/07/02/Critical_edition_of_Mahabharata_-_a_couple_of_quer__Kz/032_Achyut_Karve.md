Is it not conceivable that the so-called spurious parts were added in the process of bringing the MB in written form. When was the MB first brought in print? Who brought it into print?

I am asking this question because as long as it was protected in an oral tradition additions might have been limited and that too very difficult. Writing affords space to add as the writer can go to and fro into composing new stanzas.

These aspects need to be reflected upon.
