@ N. Siva Senani,

  

Yes, there can always be questions regarding the method and criteria accepted. As for the CE, as Sukthankar wrote, the method was revised, invented even, as the Classics for which such methods were first employed and improved, are lilliputian compated to the nyagrodha-like Mahabharata text (Prolegomena, pp. 97ff.). The benefits of the CE are too obvious to be recounted.

  

I differ insofar as dharma and Mbh is concerned. We can certainly use the CE to know the dharma. (You mean to suggest, unwittingly, that the dharma was contained in exactly those passages that were considered spurious and since those passages have been removed, we can't use the CE to understand the dharma!)

  

Surely, the CE was an academic programme. And who knew it better than the master himself. He called such an exercise 'academic wrangling' (Meaning, p. 123). When Sukthankar turned to the meaning of the Mahabharata, he, as so perceptively noted by Prof. G. C. Jhala in his Introductory Note to the *Meaning*, also made use of the vulgate. As Jhala wrote:Dr. Sukthankar apparently did not confine himself to the text of the Critical Edition even where it was available.' (p. ix)

  

The *Meaning* speaks volumes about Sukthankar's own understanding of the great text. See the following quote:

He wrote, forthright,

This was noted by S. M. Katre in his memorial of the great scholar. He wrote:

nd it was his journey from *corpus* to the *anima* that required him to fall back upon

the Vulgate.
