Sri Bijoy-ji,

  

The word ' critical edition' , as has been repeatedly mentioned in the thread, is a technical term belonging to the field of textual criticism. People who used the term in the case of the texts of Indian epics too used it in that sense only. The word 'critical' , to respond in terms of your numbered questions,

  

1. Delineate a record of history?  

2. Delineate the original story line?  

3. Delineate the original text?  

4. Discover the social customs in ancient India?  

5. Discover the majesty of oral literature?  

6. Create a stabilization among the available texts?  

7. Other points  

  

#3 & # 6 come close to what a ' critical edition ' is. All other numbers are absolutely not connected to the issue of ' critical edition'.

  

................................

  

If you are interested in explaining to children and youngsters, you may tell them the following:

  

This activity (of preparing a critical edition ) emerged due to the advent of printing/publishing.

  

When ancient books like Mahabharata were to be brought into printed form, there emerged the question of which of the several manuscripts of that epic should be brought into printed form.

  

Reasonable answer to this question would obviously be whichever of the several manuscripts is the 'correct' one, i.e., the one written / composed by the original author.

  

How to decide whichis the 'correct' one, i.e., the one written / composed by the original author ?

  

The fact is that none of the manuscripts is the one written directly by the author with his own hand or the one directly dictated by the author to his scribe and the one directly written by that scribe with his own hands.

  

The material used for writing, e.g., palm leaves can not be intact beyond a certain amount of time. So to preserve the text of the epic, the text was copied into freshly made ,say, palm leaves.

  

From the time of the original scribe's writing, the book could have got copied several number of times.

  

The texts were copied into newly made material, say, palm leaves, not only for preservation. In the absence of printingtechnology, any person needing a copy of the book, had to get it copied by a scribe.

  

During this process of copying and recopying, it is possible that verses not to the liking of the scribe or the person commissioning the scribe, were deleted (not copied ) Verses could have been added by the scribe or the person commissioning the scribe. (This is the explanation for why the text in all the available manuscripts of the same book are not the same.

  

Deletion of verses continuing into all the manuscripts can not be undone today. But verses deleted in one 'lineage' of manuscripts could have got preserved in another 'lineage'.

  

Interpolations (verses added later to the original compositions) need to be removed if the original composition is to be restored.

  

Other possibilities such as modifications bythe scribe or the person commissioning the scribe, scribal errors, carrying of the errors into the later copies, damage to the material, say, palm leaves, loss of full leaves etc., make the issue extremely interestingly/thrillingly complex for the investigator looking for the original composition by the author(s) of the book.

  

*The version of the text brought out by the investigator as the closest to the original composition is called the 'critical edition' **because the version is the result of a 'critical' (meticulous, intricate investigation) process.***

  

Readers looking for the 'original composition' would like to have this version in print to be 

  

I am sure children and youngsters get excited to hear about the process.
