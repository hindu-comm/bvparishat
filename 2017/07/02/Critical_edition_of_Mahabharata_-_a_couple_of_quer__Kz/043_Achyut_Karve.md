Dear Paturiji,

You have enunciated the scope and the intent of the critical edition very nicely.

However what needs to be pursued is it's worth in modern times.

The practice of story telling to children by elders i.e by parents and grandparents has virtually ceased.  
Formal schools have now been entrusted/delegated the job of character building. In these circumstances how can the critical edition help?

Is the critical edition available in all Indian languages, which will make the work accessible to students and parents alike?

The MB is storehouse of personalities both worth emulating and discarding. It is a mine describing circumstances which test personalities. The point is that this cannot be the work of an imaginative mind alone unless it is aided by real history. Thus the objective of composing the MB is well beyond writing history as it is now written comprising of events, places and persons (not personalities).

The objective of writing modern history is different from the objective of the epics. This aspect needs to be brought into focus.

I think this what Bijoy Mishraji is seeking.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
