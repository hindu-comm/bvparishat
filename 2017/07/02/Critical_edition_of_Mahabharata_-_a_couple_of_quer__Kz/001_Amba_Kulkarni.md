Dear Siva Senani ji,  
  

You may refer to Prof Sukhthankar's article  
  
A comprehensive Prolegomena ( Vol. I ), written by V. S. Sukhtankar, brings out the material and methodology of the project  
  

in this regard.  
  

  

You will find more details on BORI's website: <http://www.bori.ac.in/mahabharata_project.html>  
  

Best,  

Amba
