Why can't we hand over the issue to a geneticist who will better guide us. They have the requisite technology as they can tell us whether the Vedas are written by the Aryans or not.

Why do we not define our aim of having a new recession of the MB?

Is the objective to trace the original one or to decontaminate the ones we have at hand and have one which is more truthful and reflects the intention of the original not merely as a history book found now-a-days as best sellers on book stalls. If one is trying to compare the MB with the work of Epicurus he better not read any recession of the MB as dates mere genealogy and places do not lie at the core of the work of the MB.
May he remember that the MB is simultaneously a literary work which Epicurus was not eyeing.

The MB has come to us through an oral tradition lasting centuries. Now it is the job of the linguists rather than that of historians to decontaminate the MB by giving reasons related to phonetics, phonological and prosody.  
If parts of some recessions of MB have found their way into the final recession reasons thereof should be given. In case some parts have been dropped though they appear in all recessions reasons for their being dropped should be given.
