Dear PaturijiI,

What I intended was that those parents who are interested in following the critical edition and as yet are not Sanskrit literate for them I would like that authentic translations be made available in various regional formal languages.

In the modern era when translation softwares are available this work should not pose problems if we engage in the task and feel that it is worthwhile attempting.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
