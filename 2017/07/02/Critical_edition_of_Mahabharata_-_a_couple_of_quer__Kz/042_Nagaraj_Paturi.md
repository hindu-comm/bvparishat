\>Has the "critical edition" replaced the texts in circulation?

What has been the field experience?  

  

--- 1. 'Print' editions, 'critical' or not have by and large replaced the manuscripts in day to day use. But there are very rarely manuscripts being used for ritualistic text use.

  

\>The process perhaps assumes that there is a single-author

text.

  

----- 2. No, textual critics assume multiple authors. For example, Mahabharata is considered by most of them to be a text accrued during a period of several centuries. Prof. Vishva Adluri's poorva paksha is with the'accrued' argument only.
