Dear Misraji,

  

The word 'Critique' should have been used instead of the word critical.
The word critical carries negativity. Historical material especially a historico/philosophico/literary work like the MB needs to be treated more fairly as it has the potential to contribute to modren or contemporary thought.

  

Secondly, the MB needs to be interpreted in a wider perspective namely the social institutions that were then prevalent. The historical setting of the MB is during a period of transition from a tribal society where the family as such has not been institutionalized to an epoch of kingship within the tribe itself. The MB therefore is a story of life and evolving relationships in this period of transition. 

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
