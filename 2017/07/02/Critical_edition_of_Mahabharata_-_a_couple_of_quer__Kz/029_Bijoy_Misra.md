Dear Achyutji,  

Since you are into musical composition, you may explore the scientific  

aspects of melody in music. What we have to explore if a word  

carries its own melody in a composition. Give it several years of  

study, both technical and empirical. Put together your findings  

in book. Take Marathi folk poetry, which might be more tractable.  

These thoughts are not developed in the west. The west is stuck  

in vaikhari and not the inner voice. It would take another hundred  

years before west gets away from the word mode (hopefully!)  

Best regards,  

BM
