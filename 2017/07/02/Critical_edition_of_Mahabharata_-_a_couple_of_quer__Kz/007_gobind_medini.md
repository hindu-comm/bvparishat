// To me it seems that the Pune of those years was in awe of, and heavily influenced by, Western scholars (Indologists?).//  
  

This statement is the very antithesis of what Pune was and how Pune was perceived by historians of 19th and 20th century.  

Pune was at that time in the vanguard of Indian freedom struggle as well as the reformist movements. Indian nationalism itself was shaped by (and at) Pune. Being rationalist and objective is wrongly being equated here as being in awe of western culture. Further, there is nothing wrong in accepting from other cultures and civilizations what is positive and useful for the development of the native nationalism. This is the signature of confidence rather than the weakness.
