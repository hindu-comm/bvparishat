Apologies for posting in a closed thread.

  

The complete critically edited text of the *Mahabharata* is translated into Gujarati along with the original Sanskrit shloka in twenty volumes (14,000 pages) by Tapasvi Nandi, Shantikumar Pandya, Vasant Parikh, R. D. Shukla, Mansukh Savaliya, and J. K. Bhatt, and edited by Dinkar Joshi. It was published by Pravin Prakashan, Rajkot in March 2009 (first five volumes) and March 2010 (the rest fifteen).

  

Best,

Hemant
