Salutations to scholars.

  

Today's Live Mint has an essay on the critical edition of Mahabharata (<http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/MGzWHO2hFNC87saL4SRdkN/Mahbhrata-the-critical-edition-and-beyond.html>)

  

Two points caught my attention. Firstly, apparently out of the 235 manuscripts used to arrive at the "critical" edition of Mahabharata, only 1 was in Devanagari, compared to 20 to 30 each in Telugu, Bengali etc. Is this true and representative of the entire edition?

  

Secondly, the essayist explains her understanding of the process like this: "The editor and team for each*parvan* (or chapter) went through and tallied all the manuscripts they collatedâ€”stanza by stanza, line by line, word by word. In the final form, verses which occur on the greatest number of manuscripts are deemed to be authentic and included."

  

To be sure, there are other paragraphs as well explaining the selection process, but I highlighted the above because the above should have been the main principle, if not the only one and the Critical Edition seems to have not made the above the only or main principle. I wonder what the understanding of scholars who have consulted the Critical Edition is.
