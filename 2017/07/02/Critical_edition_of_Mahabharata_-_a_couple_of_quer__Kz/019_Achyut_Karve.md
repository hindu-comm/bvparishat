Dear Mishraji,

You are right in your observation that it is the form of verse that has helped protect not only the scriptures but also the epics.

Poetry not only appeals to the intellect but also fills the heart.

It is this versification of information that has enthralled the Indian
mind for centuries. This is not to be found on the scale and variety in any other land. People as also intellectuals of foreign lands will hardly be able to ever appreciate poetry in its Indian form.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
