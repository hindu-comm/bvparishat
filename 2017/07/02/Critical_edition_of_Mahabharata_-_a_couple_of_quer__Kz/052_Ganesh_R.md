NamaskaaraH,

  

I have read the critical edition completely and the critical text several times

Having a fair knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses,if any, I have due respect for it and the great people behind it. Iam also following this thread keenly. But it is very painful and deplorable to say that some of those who have their axes against the critical edition are so badly driven by emotions and unscholarly biases. Not withstanding this, some are not even well equipped to have a critical review of the critical edition itself as a few, it seems, have not even thoroughly read the eighteen volumes of it. Hence such discussions would not yield any great results in the scholarly world and the world in general.

  

The critical text, along with the original is translated into Kannada by a team of scholars and is being published by the Mysore university

But the work is not yet complete. I do have any idea with regards to other languages.

With deep regards

  

Ganesh
