Namaste Vidyasankar Mahodaya,

It is a long time since we corresponded. The comments you have made above re. the MBh and the problems raised are perennial and may not be easily resolvable.The many versions serve a valuable heritage in the sense that some regional cultural practices get included in their respective version. In that sense they enrich our understanding of the richness of our multi-faceted culture. Be that as it may I am writing to you personally for a favour.

You had a long time ago sent me a copy of your paper on the authorship of the Pañjīkaraṇa work of Śaṅkarācārya and I remember vaguely a reference to the 'pūraka' 'recaka' origin in that paper and a reference to Miśra. Could you resend it to me if you still have it on your computer. Thank you very much.
