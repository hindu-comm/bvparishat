As recommended by friends here, I did read Dr Sukthankar's essays today.  

Except in some areas in second essay (discussion of the shloka meter),  
I didn't find anything relevant or interesting.  

A creative composition has to be evaluated on the style of story telling.  

A composition is not a political document that the plot would be challenged..  
The characters are the part of the composition. The entire piece is one.  

A good reviewer must know the rendering of each piece and check if the  

poet has applied the creative literary skills in developing the character.  

He sounded defensive apparently being flooded with some early reviews  

of the plot by German scholars. He could possibly get into many  

vernacular renditions to comment on the cultural acceptance of the plot.  

I know all these take time. We accept what is given. We have to do more.
