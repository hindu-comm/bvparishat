Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

Somehow I have failed to locate a document stating the "objective" of creating a "critical" edition.  

Please help if you have a reference. I need help with the definition of the word "critical"  

in the context of Indian epics.  

Is it to (one or many of below)  
  

1. Delineate a record of history?  

2. Delineate the original story line?  

3. Delineate the original text?  

4. Discover the social customs in ancient India?  

5. Discover the majesty of oral literature?  

6. Create a stabilization among the available texts?  

7. Other points  
  

I find beautiful description of the steps in the work, but not a stated goal. My efforts here  
are to help create research interests among the new youth and new scholars. So I educate  

myself what I can as clearly I can. Please excuse me for my low level of exposure. I am  
still reading, but trying a short-cut in asking.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
