"There are bundles of work on how the  
Vedas are organized, ***but no work on who wrote the first sukta and why.***"

  

I dont know what you mean by 'who wrote first sukta' - the name of the Rishi is explicitly stated before each sukta of Rigveda.   

  

Sri Aurobindo has written extensively on the spiritual culture of the Vedic Rishis. Why Agni sukta is the first and Vayu etc. suktas come next at the head of Rigveda is answered at length in his works. Please visit [Sri Aurobindo - His Writings](http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/writings.php). His follower T V Kapali Sastry has written in depth on these same topics in Sanskrit in his commentary Siddhanjana (only 1st ashtaka) on Rigveda.
