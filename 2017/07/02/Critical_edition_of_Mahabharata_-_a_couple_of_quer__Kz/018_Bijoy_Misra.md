I narrate a short experience in this context.  
During my college days in 1960's India had the conflict with Pakistan.
Nehru had  

already instituted military training for all college-going youth following the war  

with China in 1962. The 1965 conflict was more prolonged and the mobilization  

was heavy. I had organized a folk-theater club with the aim of raising funds  

through public performances in order to help raise awareness and engage  

the youth. My father was a poet and he had interest in these.  
  

This is where I was first exposed to variation of scripts. We were working on the  

lost art of folk theater that the villagers performed. We did discover the variation  

of scripts through this process. However the tunes of the composition were  

not affected. Working with the musicians I found that the melody of the lyric  

was helpful in connecting to the words. It took me a long time to experiment  

through neuro-science that we compose in sentences and not in words.
Again  
later, our great grammarian friend Bhatrhari helped me understand the process  
through his brilliant analysis.  
  

Diction and rhythm are as essential parts of poetry as the words. For twenty years  

I run a group here that creates and hosts poetry reading. We invite poets in  

all languages to participate. What I discover that the poet "expresses" than "writes."  

An expression has its own grammar. Scientific research on human expression  

needs much finer sensing and we don't have the tools yet. What I admire that  

scholars in India pioneered the work thousands of years ago possibly in search for  
the truth in human speech!  
  

I was delighted to read in Valmiki the other day about his rationalization of the  

curse that he uttered. People who are in literature would know. I do see that  

the brilliantly technical line gets slaughtered through translation or "editing.".  

The line could be considered alien in a "myth" story...  
  

Any editing process must expand the book by allowing various renderings than  

removing apparent "dissimilar" material. Such is my opinion.  
  

If you can, try massive projects of discovering the melody of the literature.  

This would need huge amount of public and private effort. I recommend attempts  

in short segments for research and enjoyment..  
  

Best regards,
