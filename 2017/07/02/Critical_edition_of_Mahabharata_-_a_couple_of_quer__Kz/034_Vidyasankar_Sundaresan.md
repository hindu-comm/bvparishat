It is also possible that in the process of transmission and redaction, spanning several centuries, specific verses were dropped rather than added, for one reason or the other. All of this is the bread and butter of manuscriptology. Sometimes, the signs are clear whether something was added or taken out. In other instances, it is never clear and you are left with a "much can be said on both sides" situation, which each scholar can perhaps resolve for himself as per his own opinions/assumptions, but without hope for any broad consensus to develop.

  

With the itihAsa-purANas, we are looking at a hybrid oral-written textual transmission, in combination with an upanyAsa/harikathA performance context, especially when we look at the 400-500 years before British colonial rule. In my view, one of the biggest strengths of the BORI critical edition is the collection, in one place, of a vast number of manuscript readings from various regional sources. Even if one has reservations about the particular reading adopted by the editorial team, and for good reason, one has available, at hand, the extensive critical apparatus and variants preserved, in one place. We can always go back to the form and content of the text that a key commentator uses, if we want to address other questions.  
  
Personally, I would problematize the idea that a critical edition is somehow the historically prior, "original" version of the text. Nevertheless, viewed against the context of two millennia of text transmission, I think the preparation of the critical edition was an absolutely necessary preservation measure at a crucial time in our history.

  

This doesn't mean that we shouldn't critique the ideas and methods of "higher criticism" and "lower criticism" as inherited originally from European Biblical scholarship. Ideally, critiquing the critical method is a part of the process of honing and fine-tuning research methodology, discarding untenable assumptions made by scholars of the past, reviewing fresh evidence as and when appropriate, and striving to better understand our past and our present. Also, I think that critiquing contemporary scholarship that is derivative of the critical edition can be legitimately done without necessarily dismissing the value of the CE itself. There are much better and more experienced scholars on this list who can speak about this.
