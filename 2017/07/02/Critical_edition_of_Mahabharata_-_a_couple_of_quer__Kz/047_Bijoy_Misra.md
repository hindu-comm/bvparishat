In general I have difficulty in statements like "spurious" interpolations.  

I cannot fully comprehend the process. I would imagine that "retelling"  

of a story might take place catering to the local audience. I myself  

use different words in different lectures to explain the same concept.  

Here the assumption is that the person would refine his/her vocabulary  

gradually.  

I would think that the audience influences the "retelling" tools.  

So I am not surprised that variations of "story telling" exists That  

could be organic. The dichotomy comes with asserting that a print  

text must override the spirit of improvisation. The oral literature is  

human-oriented and is dynamic. The print text is inert and passive.  

I am looking for the human factor in the work. Hence I was mentioning  

melody.
