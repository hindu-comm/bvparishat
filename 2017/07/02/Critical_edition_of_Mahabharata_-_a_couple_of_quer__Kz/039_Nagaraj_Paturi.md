I was travelling. Hence this mistake of approving this digressing post by Sri Narayan Joshi-ji in this thread.

  

Since the issue of the locations mentioned in Mahabharat and their possible correlations with places of known history is not related to Critical Edition, members are requested not to respond to this post in this thread.
