The language research has been dominated by the German Indology.  

Swadeshi movement did subscribe to the view of the 19th century Indology.  

The father of swadeshi Lokamanya Tilka was looking for the home  

of the Aryans. Nobody questioned the "assertions" clowned as "findings".  
Research on the evolution of language was bypassed.  

It may still be the case. This view needs critical analysis.  
  

Through whatever reason, India has gone through a phase of documenting  

history through description. There are bundles of work on how the  

Vedas are organized, but no work on who wrote the first sukta and why.  
  

The same thing I notice on Ramayana. There are huge works on  

counting trees in the text, but no research on who Valmiki was.  

Hopefully we encourage the new researchers to dig in deeper.  
  

Please do accept good from all cultures, but not what anyone  
thinks of you. Unless you breathe the air, you don't understand the air!  

Please breathe it hard and feel it.
