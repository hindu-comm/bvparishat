Although Prof. Paturi stated briefly that these concerns do not really pertain to the critical edition, let me attempt a little more by way of clarification.

  

1\. Practice of story-telling at home to children is very easy to resuscitate. It only takes a small effort by parents and it needs to be addressed by looking at other cultural and social factors outside of old handwritten manuscripts, popular modern printed versions or the scholarly project of a critical edition. Even two hundred years ago, when family elders were very familiar with the material and retold itihAsa purANa accounts as stories to children, they would rely upon their own memories of what was told to them when they themselves were children, not upon manuscripts. It was truly personal smRti that provided the material for this.

  

2\. By definition, a critical edition of any text can only be in the original language of the text. Any other rendition in any other language would be a translation. Scholars could, for example, work on critical editions of Kamba Ramayana, Nannayya Mahabharata, Potana Bhagavata or Tulsidas Ramacaritamanasa. It is quite possible that there are variant readings of these works too, preserved in different manuscript transmission lines, but each of these critical editions will necessarily be in the original languages of the respective texts, not in Bengali or Marathi or Kannada or contemporary Hindi. Translating these other works into other Indian languages would be worthy projects, whether from a popular perspective or a popular one, but these would be different from working on critical editions of these texts.

  
3. The availability of a critical edition could help with all these concerns. With respect to character building in a formal educational setting, for example, the BORI edition is a very valuable thing to have, without thereby taking away from the validity or use of say, the version used by Nilakantha for his commentary. Indeed, the Clay library's English translation and the Gita Press's Hindi translation use the latter version, not the critical edition, and can also serve as equally valuable things to have on hand for a formal educational institution.

  

I hope these reflections help answer some of the concerns that are floating in the minds of many of us nowadays. Finally, I believe the BORI edition, with its "embarrassment of riches" in footnotes detailing the readings that were left out of the critically reconstituted text, serves today as an invaluable resource in documenting the many different traditionally handed down accounts, to preserve the form and nature of the epic against the onslaught of the numerous made-for-TV versions and the "My Gita" type of "creativity" that are becoming popular nowadays.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
