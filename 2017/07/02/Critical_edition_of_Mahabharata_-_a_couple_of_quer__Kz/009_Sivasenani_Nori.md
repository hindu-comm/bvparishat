I see no virodha in being influenced by Western scholars and being in the vanguard ofFreedom struggle or reformist movements. If anything there should be a positive co-relation, for India's freedom struggle emerged from a Western framework, not the traditional classes. It was Allan Hume, a Britisher,who started the Indian National Congress.

  

Tradition is not opposed to being rational or being objective (except for Sraddha in Veda). The vast Darsana literature is testimony to that.

  

India's tradition has been inclusive and not exclusive. The stance of Mimamsa on validity of Smriti is instructive here: it is presumed to be true unless contradictory evidence is found in Sruti. Against this, the act of preparing a Critical Edition is exclusivist, i.e. it excludes anything which is not there in all the manuscripts as a general rule.Typically, tradition views the edition of Nilakantha favourably since a commentary is seen as a kavaca.
