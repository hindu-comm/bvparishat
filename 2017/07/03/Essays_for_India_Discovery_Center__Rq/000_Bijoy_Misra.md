Dear friends,  
  

With the aim of helping the new youth in understanding India and her culture,  

I with a group here put together effort in a project called India Discovery Center  
which would be designed as an education cum activity center for the public and  
the school going children. It is a concept of helping to create awareness on India  
among other communities in the world and to foster research in many areas of  
India's history that are assumed or extrapolated. Hopefully by exposing the  
challenges and creating a multi-disciplinary line of inquiry we can help reconstruct  
the growth of ideas, concepts, language and literature. We believe that many of  
the key elements are yet to be discovered. We expect to engage the new youth  
with the task.  

  

I am sharing a list of topics that we are working on to create "exhibits". The list  

would become a hundred items next year. This is an effort of reconstruction  

to help create "Show and tell" as classroom projects. The choice would be left to the  

teachers to integrate into the local world history syllabus.  
  

We are looking for strong researchers who have an aptitude in teaching.
The task  
is to create High-school relevant educational essays on the topic. Some members  

in BVP are already helping. I thought to encourage more to participate. I can help  

further if you would be inclined to participate in the project. We need be analytic  
than descriptive.  

  

The Center is planned to open in 2021. You can visit the early website

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
