I had the joy of interacting with Sri Krishnachar for a long period when he had undertaken the printing of the two-volume book Sri Dakshinamurti Stotram in English, published by the Sringeri Shara Peetham. Sri Krishnachar was a student of the author of the book Ved.Br.Sri.D.S.Subbaramiaya at the Central College.  
  

Sri Krishnachar would go through the proofs meticulously and has on occasions pointed out errors to us in Sanskrit. He lived a fine orthodox life of a Madhva. He was fond of cricket and used to take time off from his press and other work to watch the telecast. He has quipped 'idu ondu sattvika ananda' in lighter vein. His press has brought out innumerable literature of the Madhva shcool.  
  

तस्मै महात्मने श्रद्धाञ्जलिं अर्पयामः ।
