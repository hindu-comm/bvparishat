In the above noting, is the reference to Prof D S Subbaramaiah of Physics department, Central College? I was a student of his (1953-56) and he taught physics with a deep understanding of the fundamentals. I have walked with him to his house (one-room tenement somewhere in Cantonment area) from Central College several times. He was a bachelor and had equally deep understanding of advaitha. I did not know that he authored the book on Dakshinamurti stotram. It is a pleasure to remember him.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
