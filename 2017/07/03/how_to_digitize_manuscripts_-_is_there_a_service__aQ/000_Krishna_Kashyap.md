I have a general question regarding digitizingmanuscripts.

  

Is there a service available which digitizes or scans the originalmanuscriptsand gives back content in some PDF or similar form?
will they send back the originalmanuscriptsif we mail it to them or hand carry them? how much does this service cost.? is this service available both in India / USA. what is the cost difference? can it be uploaded to[archive.org](http://archive.org/)or some other area for storage? any help is deeply appreciated.
