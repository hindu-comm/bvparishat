In his Mahābhāṣya (Paspaśāhnika), Patañjali says: "तद्यथा अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यकुक्कुट: अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यसूकर इत्युक्ते गम्यते एतद् आरण्यो भक्ष्य इति." This seems to be unrelated to the context of sacrifice, but the distinction between grāmya and āraṇya animals is there. If grāmya refers to "domesticated," I wonder why they were domesticating cocks, if they were abhakṣya.
