To add..  
  

Shri Bhide explains that  
  
(1) Atharva Veda was related to the religion of the masses (page 2), and  

\(2\) Cock was excluded from the shrauta sacrifice; however, the large part of society who followed the "popular religion" and who were not part of Brahmanism had already domesticated the cock and were offering it for their own local deities (grAma devatA) (page 3).  
  

We can infer from these two observations that Atharva Veda was placed in the shrauta corpus at a later date synthesizing the popular Hinduism and Vedic (shrauta) religion. This canonization might had happened in the post Maurya era because Arthashastra as well as early Buddhist Nikayas mention only Trayi (three Vedas).
