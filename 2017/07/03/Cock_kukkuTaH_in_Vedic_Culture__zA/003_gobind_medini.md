To connect Vedic knowledge with modern science of evolution:  
  
Many varieties of cock (domestic fowl) are descended from a single wild species of red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) present one time in Northern India. This red jungle fowl dates back to 2000BC and has been so modified in domestication as to be non-existent today (Cf. Volpe's standard text on evolution, page 16).  
  
In Shri Bhide's article, the cock in baudhAyana shrouta-sUtra is a jungle fowl; and hence the sUtra is probably pointing towards a more ancient period of Northern India than the period pointed by the cock mentioned in atharva-veda which is a domestic fowl.  
  

This is also a clue (though admittedly not a proof) of the association of early Vedic period with Northern India. It all depends on when the jungle fowl was domesticated and descended into another sub-species and what is the overlapping period when the jungle fowl and the domestic fowl existed together.
