Namaste,

  

I found a short interesting article regarding the importance of cock (कुक्कुटः) in vedic culture. The article is 'Cock in Vedic Culture' by VV Bhide.

  

Pls refer the 1st article in the journal published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan whose link is below:

  

.........

........

  

Probably, we can infer some relation with Cock and it's association with Lord Subramanya whose flagstaff isकुक्कुटः

  

regs,

sriram
