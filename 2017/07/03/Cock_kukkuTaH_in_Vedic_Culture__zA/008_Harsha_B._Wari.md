In this context, can anyone throw some light on "mesha-lavaka kukkuta yuddha vidhi" as one of the 64 arts.Why is it one of the 64 arts at all? In what way it is useful? I have done some preliminary research on this but not satisfied.

Like, i found an article about No climax - No resolution culture of Balinese men who watch cock fighting.

  

Can any scholars throw some light on this? or it should be a different thread.
