The Pali canonical texts normally refer to three Vedas, but they occasionally do refer to āthabbaṇa-manta (= ātharvaṇa-mantra) as something forbidden for the Buddhist monks to practice. Most likely, as you say, the Atharvaveda was not yet included as the fourth Veda, but was known to the authors of the Pali canonical texts.
