Dear Sriramji,

  

  Thanks for giving a link to V V Bhide's article on Kukkuṭa in Vedic culture. As an aside, V V Bhide was my father's college classmate and a close friend. Perhaps as a consequence of Bhide writing this article, his close friends used to tease him with the nickname "Kukkuṭaśāstrī".
Bhide was knowledgeable in the details of Vedic sacrifice, and his father was an Agnihotrī, a relatively rare thing in modern Pune. I remember seeing the fire altars at their home. Unfortunately, V V Bhide passed away at a relatively young age. His book on the Cāturmāsya sacrifices \[[The Cāturmāsya Sacrifices : with special reference to the Hiraṇyakeśi Śrautasūtra](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34752841)\] was published by the University of Pune in 1979.
