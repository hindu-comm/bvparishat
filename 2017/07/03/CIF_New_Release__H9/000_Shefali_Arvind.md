Hari Om Blessed Self!

  

Greetings from Chinmaya International Foundation!!  

  

Announcing a New Release!

  

'***Parisaranītiśatakam***' by Dr. Mangesh Venkatesh Nadkarni - A very interesting book on environmental science written in the form of Sanskrit verses with English versification.  
  
Parisaranitisatakam, a collection of 113 verses, deals with earthy issues like pollution in different forms and sources, deforestation, and depletion of water resources. Simple language makes it easy-to-read for even those with a little knowledge in Sanskrit.

  

The purpose of this Śatakam is two-fold - one, to sensitise particularly young minds towards environmental concern, and secondly, to stimulate further interest in Sanskrit, how Indian tradition has been respectful about environment and conservation of nature.
