An incidental reflection.

  

I am fortunate to know Sri Prahladachar, who is now a swami heading a mutt, doing exemplary work.

  

This is a good practice in the two main stream traditions, visishtadvaita and dvaita traditions. There is such lateral entry for the post of the head of the mutt. A person with vast academic and administrative background heads the mutt which has its own vast resources and dedicated students/followers. Such swamis can build up the mutts with their modern vision and produce competent scholars.

  

Unfortunately this tradition of lateral entry is not seen in the advaita tradition. Swamis are picked up in childhood and they grow up in insulated, cloistered environment without worldly knowledge, while elderly people touch their feet and make them feel that they are the teachers for the whole jagat. I belong to this tradition, hence it is only a reflection, not meant to offend any sentiment.
