The induction of children into sannyasa is a thing of the past. Such a practice was prevalent in other traditions too such as Madhva. On a couple of occasions such boys, into sannyasa, gave up the order to choose to lead a worldly life. After such bitter incidents all traditions, of all the mathas, are very careful in this matter.
