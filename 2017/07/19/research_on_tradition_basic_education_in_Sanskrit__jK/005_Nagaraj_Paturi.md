Sri Andrey-ji's words in a message to me:

  

> 
> > "The main focus of my current research is the place of kāvya within > the traditional Sanskrit education. I am particularly interested in > the “basic” education, i.e. the one that may be common to most > paṇḍita-s, before one proceeds to study one’s specific śāstra-. My > research has two parts: the textual and the “anthropological” one. For > the second part, I would like to conduct interviews with scholars, who > have themselves attended to a “traditional” education, i.e. studied > directly with a teacher." >
