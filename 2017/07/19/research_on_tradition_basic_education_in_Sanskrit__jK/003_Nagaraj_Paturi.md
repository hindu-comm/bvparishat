Respected members,

  

It used to be the practice to start Samskritam with the study of a sarga each of at least two different Kavyas.

  

Can you please tell here if you yourself entered Samskritaadhyayana that way?

  

If yes, with which sarga of which Kavyas did you start?

  

Do you know any acquaintance of you who entered Samskritam learning that way ?

  

If yes, can you please provide contact information of that person to Sri Andrey Klebanov-ji offline?

  

I told him that most of the Sanskrit scholars( including the members of the list) studied that way only.

  

Am I right?

  

Please respond.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
