Traditional Education in Sanskrit would have different focuses in different institutions, such as

-   in वेदपाठशाला-s the focus would be on वेदपठनम्, But often the focus
    would be to prepare students to become भट-s who conduct the
    षोडश-संस्कारrituals. They catch the boys young, say about 8-year
    olds. The course is of 12-odd years. It is all rote-learning. My
    impression has been that even after as many years, knowledge of
    Sanskrit as language is not at all good. -   My friend Dr. Nilesh Joshi has done doctoral work in व्याकरणम्. He
    is व्याकरणशास्त्री. If I understood it right, he spent good time in
    Varanasi learning अष्टाध्यायी so intently that he can quote
    सूत्रक्रमाङ्कः of any सूत्रम्. I guess, Dr. H. N. Bhat, who is a
    regular participant in the list, also learnt Sanskrit in
    "traditional" education. -   आयुर्वेद cannot be learnt without knowledge of Sanskrit. So
    Ayurvedic colleges/institutions would be a good resource to find out
    how they combine Ayurveda and Sanskrit. Maybe we can call Sanskrit
    of Ayurveda as "applied Sanskrit". -   I don't think there would be any institution focusing only on काव्य.
    To my mind there is no need either. Because most Sanskrit literature
    is poetry only.
-   This leads me to think of भारतीय संस्कृत संस्थानम् which offers
    exams for self-study of Sanskrit. Couple of those exams are called
    as काव्यतरङ्गिणी and काव्यावगाहिनी.

Hope, this helps.
