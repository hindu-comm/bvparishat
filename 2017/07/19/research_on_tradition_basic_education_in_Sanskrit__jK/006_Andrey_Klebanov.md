Dear Prof. Paturi-garu,

  

thank you very much for breathing a second life into my post and for initiating a more concrete discussion.

In fact, my interests are twofold:

  

\(1\) Connected to my current official research project, I would like to study the place of kāvya- within the traditional course of basic Sanskrit education. Hereby I would like to find out, --which kāvya-s, --at what stage of education, --paying attention to which topics, --how many sarga-s, --with or without commentaries etc. were introduced by different teachers/ teaching institution in the educational process.

  

\(2\) On a broader level (and this is my main interest), I am, however, aiming at producing a more detailed picture of traditional Sanskrit scholarship by addressing three following aspects:

\- traditional Sanskrit education (in a broad sense, not limited to the role of any particular topic within it)

\- lives of individual paṇḍita-s (here I would like to interview some scholars concerning their life-stories)

\- various "expressions" of traditional scholarship (this includes such things as vākyārthasabhā-s, aṣṭāvadhāna-sessions, but also such things as mentioned by Dr. Gourisankar in his previous post).

  

Being limited financially, I hope that already during my current visit (that officially at least, should relate primarily to my limited interest as described in (1)), I will nonetheless be able to start gathering material for the broader research aim that I described in (2). In this regard, I would be **immensely thankful to the members of the list for any kind of help or piece of advise**!!!

  

I consider it also important mentioning, that my research is purely academic and is not connected to any ideology or the like. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, the traditional Sanskrit scholarship makes an absolutely unique case unparalleled in any of the living World cultures, so that the study of it has an immense value in itself! I hope, however, that my research will also enhance our understanding of various principles inherent to the traditional scholarly practices. This will inevitably amplify our understanding of many historical phenomena that, in the last hundred years or so, were all too often misinterpreted in or overlooked by the modern scholarship (outside, but also inside India).

  

with many thanks and best regards,

  

Andrey
