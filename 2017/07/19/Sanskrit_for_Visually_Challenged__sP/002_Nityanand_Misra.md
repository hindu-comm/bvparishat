Braille is taught at the JRHU and if I remember correctly, books in Braille are also available. But I am not sure about the Sanskrit department (I have been to the university but have only visited classes in the Music and Fine Arts department). I do not think many Sanskrit works have been published in Braille. Your best bet would be to contact the Vice Chancellor Dr. Yogesh Chandra Dubey, who is himself a Sanskrit scholar. His email and phone are available here:

Also useful would be to contact Pandit Ram Kumar Sharma, a Sanskrit scholar who works with the JPM Blind School in Delhi. He has worked for a long time on publishing spiritual books in Sanskrit which are published by the Delhi-based Adhyatmik Chetana Samiti. They have published several Sanskrit books in Braille including the Gita, Vishnu-sahasranama, Lalita-sahasranama, Stora-piyusha, and Guru-gita. The plan to publish many more books including the four Vedas and eighteen Puranas in Braille. The below links are helpful:
