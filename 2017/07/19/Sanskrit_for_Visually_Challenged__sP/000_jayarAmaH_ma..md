Dear Members  
  

I would like to know efforts in the field of Sanskrit to make Sanskrit learning accessible to visually challenged in India and elsewhere.  
  

My web search indicated that there is only one university in India -
Jagadguru Ramabhadracharya University for the disabled - that offers courses on Sanskrit subject. Are the courses Visually disabled friendly?  
  
I also understand from the web that there is something called Bharati Braile for Devanagari and other indian scripts.Is this taught in the above university or where do I go to learn this in India?  

  

What are the online and offline resources in this regard?  
  

regards  

Jayaraman
