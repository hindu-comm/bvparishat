Dear Shri Jayaraman,

  

Your highly important questions will probably be best answered (with up-to-date information) if you contact the registrar of the Jagadguru Ramabhadracharya University.

  

The addresses I have for the founder of the university, Śrī Rāmabhadrācārya (himself an astonishing phenomenon of Prajñā-cakṣuḥ pāṇḍitya), go as follows:

  

\(a\) Śrī Tulasī Maṇḍala,220 Ke. Rāma-nagara, Gaziabād 201 001. U.P.

(b) Chitrakoot Ashram 

Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyās A, Āmodavana

Post Naya Gaon 

Chitrakoot

Satna – 485331, Madhya Pradesh

  

Probably Shri Nityanand Misra, a highly helpful member of this forum, will be able to update these and provide email addresses.

  

a.a.
