Dear BVP members,  
  
I would be grateful if someone could volunteer to referee a text submitted to Springer Briefs  
on history of science and technology (<http://www.springer.com/series/10085>).  
  
If you are interested, please let me know, and I shall pass on your contact details and credentials to one of the authors,  
Prof. Bretislav Friedrich (Fritz-Haber-Institute, Berlin). Although working in the field of Chemical Physics,  
he often spends his free time writing serious history of science articles.  
  
  
Best,  
Mallikarjun Karra
