Dear Paturiji,  
Thank you for the reply.  
  
Is this the reason that the Vedas have the force of reality and have stood the test of time.

Obviously then अनृत would mean that which does not have the force of reality and hence could not not stand the test of time and hence withered away.  

With regards,  
Achyut Karve
