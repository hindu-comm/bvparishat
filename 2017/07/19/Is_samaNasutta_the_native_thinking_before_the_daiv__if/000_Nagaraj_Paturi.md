Lately I am reading a book called SamaNasuttam, a compilation of Jaina teachings  

published in 1993. It is in old Prakrit, they call Ardhamagadhi. The style and logic  
are extremely refreshing. It does not look like a "reaction" as is taught in history  
books. I wonder if it was the native thinking before the "daiva" logic expanded itself  

in India. I invite Jaina scholars in the group to get in touch privately for possible exchange.  

Traits like accountability and attitude are powerful and scientific. It can  

become too lonely!

Nagarajji,  
These are later additions, where the philosophy is used to create dogma.  

The book I am referring is pure first principles, anyone can experiment.  

One just observes oneself and not externally. A shramaNa has seasons,  
but no stars.  

The question is if the cosmology of man is deterministic or conditional.  

These early Jaina philosophers invoke determinism, but they do get into  
trouble to find closures. Dying (allowing one to decay) possibly  

cannot be assumed as a design of life. Vedanta could be a compromise.  

I am just a student, but I love their analysis. We ask "what is forgiveness?"  

and "who forgives?"

I loved the samaNasuttam since it talks about individual accountability,  

and I call that as the first principles. The question is the discovery  

of the cause of our failures inside of us than looking outside.
Hanuman  
is not watching the stars before he leaps. He waits for the evening in  
Lanka not for auspiciousness but to take advantage of darkness. To me  
these are first principles. There is a strong element of personal sincerity  
and truthfulness built into the process. The question is if these are naturally  

evolved human traits as part of being more functional and strategic.
