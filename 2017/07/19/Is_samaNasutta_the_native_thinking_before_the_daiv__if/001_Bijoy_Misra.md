Nagarajji asked me to post in this thread.  

I had written in response to Yogavashistha reference in the "local news" thread.  

Please read those for relevance.  
  

Nagarajji,  
  
Thank you. There could be many more references.  

What to think is if these developed in two different strands -  

connecting to अनृत and ऋत reference in the Vedas.  

What we are seeing later is the integration of the two strands.  

Why the अनृत did not record their thoughts could be a good question.  

The possible response could be that it was a discovery-based system  

and did not need any invocations to be learned. But it is possible to have  

a full language for communication. अनृत people could coin their own  

word to label the ऋत people. They may also not care! I can also see  

that the Vedic material is layered over the so called अनृत material,  

but there is no analysis. It is the first principle analysis that appeals  

to me in the samaNasuttam. The compilation could be late, maintained  

by the residual अनृत people.  

  

With this scenario, the question would be how the concept of "daiva"  

entered into the culture and a whole lot of ritual technology developed.  

  

These are purely speculative ideas. But as I read various interpretations  

of the Vedas, I see rampant conjectures. One other point that  

needs examination is the introduction of violence into the system.  

We are told that horse and chariot entered the scene and a process  

of occupation began! Since such evidences appear to be cursory,  

one might think of a model of gradual evolution of personal philosophy.  

(one eventually develops a theory of death, calling it "liberation" etc.)  

  

Hopefully many would think further and help extend or reject such  
hypothesis. I have to study many more years. I appreciate the Forum  

for letting me express my rudimentary thoughts.  

  

Best regards,  

BM
