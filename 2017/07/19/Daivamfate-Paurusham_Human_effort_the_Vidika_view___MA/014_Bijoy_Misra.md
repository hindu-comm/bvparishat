My earlier thinking started with Sushruta.

He operates with the treatment plan from the first principles.

He categorically declares the role of mind in healing.

Also he finds the treatment plan in the local setting than

invoking external elements. That a disease or an accident

could be a natural part of human living is a rationalization.

The task is to create a treatment plan than asking various

questions. It is unlike offering treatment plan through

faith or conversion. "well-being" can be different than

"treatment."

  

I don't know if we can set a good date on Sushruta. I am

hearing an arbitrary 900BC, It appears to me as an independent

scholarly document, untainted by any "faith".
