Nagarajji,

  

Human effort in climbing a tree and human effort

in understanding inner processes are different.

What we have to check if introspection as a process

self-developed through group living. I am looking

for shramaNa as a state of human society. It appears

self-contained, hence I think of its indigenous origin.

The process might lead to individual abilities like the

vibhUtipAda etc.

  

Destiny. fate, will are different concepts, probably much later.

They are closures. The self-containment is open-ended.

  

I am going away for a week.. I might read occasionally.

  

Best regards,

BM
