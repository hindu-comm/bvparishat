I think it would also be relevant to note that the Yoga Vasistha of Valmiki (the Mokshopaya of Kashmir) places the highest emphasis on human effort, and while accepting the effect of destiny/chance/fate in human affairs, it downplays its power and makes it secondary to current effort. It also provides a nice twist on destiny, terming it nothing but the current efforts of a previous life.

  

There are many verses on the efficacy of effort, I am just quoting from memory here:

  

सर्वमेवेह हि सदा संसारे सम्यक्प्रयुक्तात्सर्वेण पौरुषात्समवाप्यते ।  
  
The Mahabharata in the Brighu-Brahma dialogue (if I remember correctly), calls destiny subservient to effort (but does not negate it altogether) and calls for a clear adherence to the power of human exertion to get things done.

  

The Panchatantra and the Hitopadesa too, in their various verses, disparage reliance on chance, destiny or fate, and call for manful exertion. "Works are accomplished by industry, not by wishes", goes one verse fragment that has stuck in my mind.

  

just my two paisa
