Thinking that your Paurusham is in reading samaNasuttam, a thread has already been opened to help you share your views there.

  

It is Daivam that you chose to respond to this thread where your Paurusham does not lie.

  

Others whose Paurusham lies in the topic of this thread, shall continue the discussion.

  

We will wait for what Daivam has in store for us after a week.

  

Good luck (daivam).
