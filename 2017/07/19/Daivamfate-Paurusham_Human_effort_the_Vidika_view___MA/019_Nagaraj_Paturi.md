Again Sri Bijoy-ji, you are taking liberties with technical terms of certain disciplines, meanings of which are established in those disciplines.

  

You might have seen how all the downpour of references from scriptures show that paurusham/ purushakaarah /maanusham is always used in contrastive relation to daivam. Human effort as a translation to this technical term(s) can not be reduced to just something like climbing a tree.

  

To say things like 'much later', you need to do a highly meticulous research in history of ideas with sufficient documentation.

  

This thread is not a debate between shramaNa - suppoters and shramaNa - opposers.

  

shramaNa has nothing to with the theme of the present thread.

  

This thread is intended to make the group look into the Vaidika sources discussing the daivam -paurusham issue, with the hope that particularly younger members will learn that Vaidika tradition is not essentially fatalistic (Daivavaadi) but had a sufficient emphasis on human effort balanced with a recognition of daivam.
