Namaste,  

  
It might be that, Caraka is a philosopher-doctor and Sushruta is a layman's-doctor. Sushruta endorses the views of Caraka on daivam, but he speaks of no पुरुषकार । The word पौरुषं has got other meanings in his context.  
  
Since Sushruta accepts the daivam, he has no second thought on दैवव्यपाश्रयचिकित्सा, which is one of the three types of treatment. Spiritual treatment is connected with this, even in the west.  
  
Caraka says, both disease and treatment are based on पुरुषकार । दैवम् functions through कालविपाक ।  
  
नाकाले जायते कश्चिन्नाकाले म्रियते तथा ।  
जगत्कालवशं सर्वं कालः सर्वत्र कारणम् ।।  
  
When there is a clash between दैवम् and पुरुषकार, the stronger one would prevail over the other. Because, sometimes, दैवम् could be exhausted by performing expiatory rites. But, again it is performed through पुरुषकार only. At times, this would contradict the sayings - नाभुक्तं क्षीयते कर्म कल्पकोटिशतैरपि etc. A close examination is required here.  
  

A pseudo-doctor (भिषङ्मानी) may kill a patient, whose daivam is weak, by committing पुरुषकारापराध । (refer दैवेन चेतरत् कर्म विशिष्टेनोपहन्यते ।)  
  
Also, in spite of following good food regimen, one may be afflicted with disease.  
  
What is the reason?  
ननु पथ्यसेवायां क्रियमाणायामपि बलवत्प्राक्तनाधर्मवशादपि व्याधयो भवन्ति ।  
  
Then, what is the purpose of the शास्त्रम् ?  
शास्त्रस्यारोग्य-साधन-आहार-आचाररूप-पुरुषकारोपदेशकत्वेन प्रयोजनवत्त्वम् ।
