yogavAsiShTha (YV) teaches GYAna-karma-samuchachaya-vAda (ज्ञानकर्मसमुच्चयवाद) unlike traditional Advaita. For example, when sutiixNa asks Agastya as to "which one of the two is conducive to the Liberation, work or Knowledge; then Agastya replies (YV I-1/7):  
  

उभाभ्यामेव पक्षाभ्याम् यथा खे पक्षिण: गति:  

तथैव ज्ञानकर्माभ्याम् जायते परमम् पदम् \|\|  
  

\< (Verily) birds are able to fly with their both wings, even so both work and knowledge together lead to the supreme goal of Liberation \>  

  

Interestingly, YV's metaphysics is quite similar to that of Advaita as taught by gauDapAda and sha.nkara. It says,  
  
\< The world appearance is a confusion: even as the blueness of the sky is an optical illusion. I think it is better not to let the mind dwell on it, but to ignore it." (I-3/2) \>  
  
Oft repeating term used in YV is kAkatAlIya - a bird alights on the coconut palm tree and at the very moment the ripe coconut falls. Such is life.. such is Creation.  
  

How to reconcile the metaphysics with the GYAna-karma-samuchchaya? YV teaches to ignore the metaphysics of illusion though it is abundant in such metaphysics:  
  

\< (There is no power greater than right action, hence) one should take recourse to self-effort (pauruSham), 'grinding one's teeth', and one should overcome the evil by the good, and fate (daiva) by present efforts \> (YV II-5/9).
