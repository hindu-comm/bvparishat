Bijoy ji,

  

That line (in fact the entire paragraph) is the author paraphrasing the liberal view on free will. (I left out that part considering it to be extraneous)

  

If you will read further, you will find that he does not agree with the liberal view of the existence of free will- in fact, his entire writing is an attack on the concepts of individuality, soul and free will.

  

I gave that reference to supplement the western view as seen from a modern western lens.

  

with regards

Harsha
