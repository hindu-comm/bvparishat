Also, I should mention that "free will" or "cosmic will"

are not analytic concepts. They are more to do with

rationalization of our "work". Analysis comes to define

"work"and what constitutes "work". A discovery like

one has to breathe to maintain life could be a milestone

in culture. Then the question is if "living" adds entropy

to the universe or we find a way to leave it the way we

received it. Somehow, personally, I love the latter thinking.

Vedanta could be a compromise, but I have to study

further.
