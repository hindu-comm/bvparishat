***uttama*** coming at the end of a compound

(in items 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 & 8 above in your list), and

***-tama*** as a suffix indicating the superlative

(degree of comparison) - are different.

  

(Ultimately, even *uttama* has its constituent -*tama* suffix) .

  

Technically the suffix is called*tamap*.
