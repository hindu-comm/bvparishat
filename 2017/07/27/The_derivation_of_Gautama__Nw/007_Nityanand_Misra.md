Well, I agree with Dr. Bhat who says that *gotamas* would be inflected as *gotamāḥ* and not *gotamaḥ* in nominative singular. Dr. Bhat had not considered the possibility of *pṛśodarādi* which SKD and VP give based on the MBh *nirukti*. Being the fine grammarian he is, if he considers the*pṛśodarādi*option, he will also say that *go* + *tamas* -> *gotamas* -> *gotama* is possible.

Yes we do, to the extent that both are names of Vedic seers. The names are inflected differently though.

I cannot answer how common. Perhaps we could grep on*pṛṣodarādi/pṛṣo* in SKD and VP. But some very common words like हंस and सिंह are indeed explained as *pṛṣodarādi* formations*.*Perhaps other scholars in the list can comment here.

I agree one should be preferred. But the other cannot be ruled out altogether. We have to see the accent and match it with the accent in RV. That will be the true test of the etymologies. But if we end up with the same accent with both, it is still a tie :). For Sanskrit commentators, this *per se* does not seem to be a problem. Sayana offers as many as five different etymologies for *rudra* in his commentary on RV 1.114.1. Is one true and others false? It is difficult to say. I say it adds to the beauty of Sanskrit by allowing for multiple meanings with independent etymologies. This is particularly true for compounds. Another example: RV hymn 4.58 is dedicated to five deities at once (Agni, Sūrya,Jala, Go, and Ghṛta). RV 4.58.3 (*catvāri śṛṅgā trayo asya pādā dve śīrṣe sapta hastāso asya, tridhā baddho vṛṣabho roravīti maho devo martyām̐ ā viveśa*) is an esoteric verse.Sāyaṇa gives two different meanings: one each for Agni and Sūrya, and says it should be similarly interpreted differently for the other three deities.Patañjali interprets it as describing Shabda Brahman. So we have six meanings of the same verse. This verse is a*ṣatsandhāna kāvya*! I doubt if such verses can be explained without considering multiple meanings and also multiple etymologies.

It may not be enough, but I have stopped using M-W altogether. I am very much interested in Paninian derivations or *niruktis*. SKD and VP do that religiously. I like it. You look up a word in SKD or VP, there is a good chance you also learn something about an Unadi Sutra or a Paninian Sutra. It is wonderful. For people like me.

It is okay. We need not agree on everything.

I used to think PWG is great, until we had the discussion on Goldman’s wrong translation of *kṛtajña* in VR 1.1.2 as “knows how to act upon it” where it=what is right. Nobody uses*kṛtajña* in Sanskrit in this sense, and there are no known historical usages in this sense to me. A member mailed me offline showing the entries in M-W, PWG, and Wilson on*kṛtajña*. It is a bad chain of lexicographer after lexicographer repeating mistakes, starting from Wilson. Perhaps *copied* is a strong word, but I am sure they both drew upon Wilson.

I do not know how many people were involved in VCP. I do not have a reliable source on the same. So I cannot say.

Well, I like to read meaning of a Sanskrit word in Sanskrit itself. Plus, SKD almost always gives a derivation. Why for for English when one can understand the word in Sanskrit. The former way you learn only one Sanskrit word. The latter way you learn many in one go.

I just use the digital editions.

Nothing like it! It is always good to have such discussions.
