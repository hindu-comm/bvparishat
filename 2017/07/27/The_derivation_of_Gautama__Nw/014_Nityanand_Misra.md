Well, not one but several. And also the opinion of Theodor Goldstücker who wrote in *Panini—His Place in Sankrit Literature* (colour emphasis mine):

  

*“In now adverting to the treatment which the scientific and classical literature has received in the Sanskrit Wörterbuch, I need only say that this department is in the hands of Dr. Boehtlingk. In saying this, I have said everything. After such an expression of opinion, it will, of course, be my duty to show, at the earliest opportunity, that Dr. Boehtlingk is incapable of understanding even easy rules of Panini, much less those of Katyayana, and still less is he capable of making use of them in the understanding of classical texts. The errors in his department of the Dictionary are so numerous and of so peculiar a kind — yet, on the whole, so thoroughly in accordance with the specimens I have adduced from his Commentary on Panini, that it will fill every serious Sanskritist with dismay, when he calculates the mischievous influence which they must exercise on the study of Sanskrit philology.”*
