Namaste All

  

My observations seeking technical clarifications on this thread of discussion on Gautama (-- ? --Gotama).

  

**The summary point** I wish to drive is the 'Critical Need to revisit the issues: How to Study Samskrutham using Current dictionaries ? Challenges posed by post 1500 CE Sanskrit Dictionaries in understanding Pre 1500 BCE texts and traditions in the Language Class called 'SAMSKRUTHAM'. The first line of effort begins with MW-Dictionary
review for 40,000 L -marked words out of 1,86,000 listed entries.

  

The Language Tools -Grammar -Dictionary for understanding SAMSKRUTHAM are covered by SIX traditional disciplines called VEDANGA in a UNIFIED APPROACH (Yoga way of learning- using Samskrutham).

  

**The requested clarifications ( being technical, only limited readers may have interest in this line of analysis).**

  

1\. **Technical:** Are we focused in this thread on understanding the communication from the above term as

1-a) **Gautama as a 'Prakruti shabda (Base unit)' a NOUN ( Subanta -prakriyaa yogya Prakruti)** in its FULL, as given form ? - in which case, it is a samketa, a designation.

  

It does not matter where it occurs; how one explains/ explained the derivation -process to suit a usage -context, even in SKD or VP or MW for convenience with a plurality of meanings. The very split of the given unit as 'Go (a given prakruti with multiple meanings - in chandas and Bhashaa) added on with a modifier '- tama (pratyaya with a swara marking) following a rule which yields a relative/ comparative /superlative value becomes ' objectionable' in this model.

  
**Or**

  

1-b) Gautama as a 'Ting- anta prakruti (Base unit)' a DHATU ( or DHATU GARBHA or DHATU SAMASA getting a samjna for further -prakriyaa's ) in its SPLIT form ? - in which case, it is a PRE-PROCESSED DERIVATIVE, open for Meaning associations; all of which may or may not be listed in any one or all of the dictionaries. Certainly the Translators and ' indology interpreters and Orientalists using ' academic freedom' and Indian poets like Sri Harsha using 'poetic license' would go in a ' free for all' model to interpret the word and claim ' better understanding of tradition -texts-practices'.

  

**Or**

  

  

**2) All approaches are open ?!** Then lung power rules over logic and tradition. As is seen in the recent ' Mahabharata -related discussions on BORI -Critical Edition review' .

**  
**

**  
**

**Net Result : Battle -Sanskrit**

  

**RESAON** : SANSKRIT DICTIONARIES carrying Embedded issues in interpreting - understanding a word belonging to 'SAMSKRUTHAM: LANGUAGE CLASS.

  
**Note**: Panini, a part of Vedanga Linguistics covers both Chandas and Bhashaa - as branches of ONE LANGUAGE CLASS - SAMSKRUTHAM :: One Language Class where two sets of words result due to different levels of refinement and standards. Historicity and Social usage are minimalistic criterion or non-issues.

  

There is all evidence in tradition and in this list itself to show GAUTAMA is understood and used differently in CHANDAS and BHASHAA branchs of SAMSKRUTHAM LANGUAGE CLASS. This is what I have pointed to in my earlier posts seeking 'Yoga way of Learning Samskrutham', as a 'Language Class by levels of refinementby APPLICATION - UTILITY ( VINIYOGA) . One may like to see Dr. Yadu's posts on importance of Viniyoga in this forum.
