That I cannot know. For me this is highest class.

So be it, two ways possible.

639 pfzo in SKD<https://yadi.sk/d/p9I2wBON3LW7Nj>

1163 pfzo in VCP<https://yadi.sk/d/Yefkn8nh3LW7PV>

  

Lists of such words attached in IAST. So it's a very small number I would say.

This I cannot but ask to help us.

That's way Roth said - enough with Sayana, I can make same amount of guesswork and his guesswork is no way better than mine.

In your case it's a riddle, an esoteric riddle, so it's done specially. In case of gotama there was no riddle meant, just or weak understanding.

Would love to read your note on what is SKD and VP and why they should be preferred.

That I agree.

But first you have you have to spend 10 years with Unadi, to understand how to understand the structure of the dictionaries.

But I agree on Zgusta and can understand your disappointment. What I do not understand - don't you get disappointed with different other issues in SKD or VCP?

1 out of 144k words and you stop using a dictionary? Are you serious?

Sure they took everything they could from Wilson. They tried to be critical but failed here.

Boethlingk at least names his sources.

Lucky you. I use Russian-Russian dictionaries myself for similar task. But here - my knowledge is not enough. I would want to try

Sure, but still one needs to know the structure. Seen<http://sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/simple-search/v1.0/list-0.2s.html> ?See<https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/Cologne/issues/156> as well.
