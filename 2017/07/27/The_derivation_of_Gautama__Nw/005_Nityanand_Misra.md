Likewise, Dr. Gasuns.

Maybe I was too terse. Anyway, this is what I meant: as per the SKD and VP (citing the MBh), the word is a compound of *go*(=cow) and *tamas* (=darkness). This is to say that word formed is *gotamas*, of which the final sound *s* is elided. This elision is explained by counting the word in the *pṛṣodarādi* class, in which the elision of a sound is often seen (*varṇanāśātpṛṣodaram*). So the word *gotamas* becomes *gotama*.

*  
*

Now, there has to be some strong reason why the author of the *Mahābharata*thought that the word is *go + tamas*= *gotamas* -> *gotama*, rather than *go + tama = gotama*. Could the reason be the name of sageDīrghatamas? The way*dīrghatamas* is inflected, it is clearly *dīrgha* + *tamas* =*dīrghatamas*. So a similar name*go + tamas*=*gotamas* is possible, and as words in the*pṛṣodarādi*class are common, it is not unfounded for SKD and VP to follow the*Mahābharata nirukti* and offer a*pṛṣodarādi* explanation, which by the way is very much in the grammatical framework.

  

This is not to say that go + tama(p) = gotama is not possible. In fact, that is the second derivation given by the VP as*atiśayena gauḥ jaḍatvāt tamap*. So at least the VP acknowledges both possibilities.

  

One thing that SKD or VP do not consider is the accent of the word. The word *gotama* occurs in the Rigveda. The accent may be different with the two derivations (I have not checked it yet, as I am pressed for time now). If some scholar can throw light on what accent the word will have with the two derivations, it would be great. If they are different, we can cross-check with the Rigveda to see which one matches the attested accent(s).

Well, that was not a question for you, but for myself to answer (in the line below). As for M-W, I have stopped using and trusting it after I found several basic errors. Anyway the M-W is to a great extent plagiarized from Boehtlingk-Roth, who in turn copy some entries from Wilson, who in turn essentially published what was a work of Bengali Pandits (without even naming them). So to me, VCP and SKD are much more reliable any day.
