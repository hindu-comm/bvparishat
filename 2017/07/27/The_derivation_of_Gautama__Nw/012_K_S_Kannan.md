Apropos *gotamas* in lieu of \**gotama (*when *tamas* is involved as a member of the compound-word).

  

There is a grammatical maxim, though I cannot trace it to its source. It says

***sarve sāntā adantā api syuḥ.***

  

As per this maxim, we may have *śira* as valid**in lieu of *śiras* too!

(So with *manas* or *tapas*.)

  

Cf. Bhāsa who uses *śiropadhāna* instead of *śiraupadhāna* as a compound. This is notwithstanding unPāṇinian usages in Bhāsa.
