Nityanand,

  

You raise a very difficult issue and there is no easy solution.Goldstücker <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/GSTScan/2014/web/index.php> is said to be "the all beginning and nothing ending one" (by Boethlingk, in a letter in German language to Roth). SoGoldstücker's Sanskrit-English Dictionary stuck in the middle ofअ, although it was just a remake of Wilson, is a joke compared to PWK and PWG, that remain the biggest Sanskrit dictionaries up to date. Similar to Poona dictionary, mid-अ. Goldstücker lived in London, is forgotten even by historians of science and was always saying bad words about Otto, who was well known and has given more to Sanskrit than whole generations of scientists. 1/4 of money in Russian Academy of Sciences went to PWG and PWK, so Russia values Sanskrit and has proved it many times in the past.
