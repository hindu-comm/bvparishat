So your argument is againsthnbhat's<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/Os8VKbDWJtk>:

  

The word meaning "darkness" is tamas ending in constant s and in masculine gender nominative it will be  " तमाः" and not तमः. Though the word  गो has multiple meaning, the given seems to be folk etymology and fancy.

So we see an analogy, ok.

How common? What does your intuition says?

I see.

But there can be no 2 true solutions. One should be preferred to the other. Etymology is not a game after all.

And I checked it's occurrences in Rigveda, indeed.

Indeed, that would help.

If there is one thing I would want to request, that would be listing those errors. I've seen some of your notes regarding specific terms, but that would not be enough to stop using it at all. At least because Apte (as did MW himself before) copies many articles 1:1 from MW.

It was the year 2004 when I had my first discussion about MW. Scholars told me that they add notes on margins of the printed edition of MW and then I realized, that still so many (even Indians) use MW, but do not give back. So I wanted to change it. Now, in 2017 it has changed a bit with <http://sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/simple-search/v1.0/list-0.2s.html> in simple search mode.

I'm a bad attorney for MW andZgusta - Copying in Lexicography - Monier-Williams 1988 <http://yadi.sk/d/h8ALxcCb8sY9w> is a way to understand why, but I can't agree with all said below.

I have compared (textdiff method) Wilson and PWG and I must say it's a bold statement.

Did VCP name all of its sources? I guess not less unnamed effort was in the background as well.

If you can read German, and I understand that you can, it's strange to use SKD (asthe main source), that was a source for PWG and ignore PWG - for it was made by a man who loved Panini above all and Sanskrit is in debt to him. 50 years passed since SKD when PWG came out, that's a big time frame, indeed and a lot was done. Why not Apte in 3 volumes? Or you like the SKD method before?

For MW there is<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tutorial_wikner/wikner.pdf> - a way to understand how to work with MW. Typographically it is the best dictionary far above anything else ever made or seen.

For SKD or VCP - is there something similar? I do not understand many things in both because I do not know what to look for where. I guess there is none, but it's a pity. Until that time<http://www.payer.de/amarakosa/amara205a.htm> is the source I prefer most if we speak about Indian dictionaries. Is there any lexicographicalresearch done related to SKD or VCP? All I've seen is one review mid-1830.

  

Thanks for your patience. For many things, I'm too dumb and beg my pardon, if they are obviouseven to a child in India,
