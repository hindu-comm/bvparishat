I agree with digitized manuscripts should be made accessible to one and all. Do repositories in Europe which have so many Indian manuscript give them away for a download. or if there is charge do they send Images or PDFs to any one who asks them. One can take a lead from Dharmatma Trust but Alas

!

we have less 'Dharmatmas' and more people who take away our material and sells them back to us.  

There is one more phenomena in the past few years As soon as a digitization program is announced many assume that all digitized materials of an institution will be given away for free or any one can ask and get copy. This is a highly erroneous assumption. The primary purpose of digitization is for preservation not give away digitized materials of an Institution to one and all for free or against payment.  
  

These are my ramblings!

Subject:Re: \[INDOLOGY\] Digitization of Rare books at the BORI  

Dear Madhav and friends,

  

Thanks for the great news about digitization plans at BORI.

  

There's a phenomenon I've begun to be aware of over the last few years.
An institution or person in India announces a digitization plan. Then some digitization actually happens. But then, the resulting files are hoarded and not made available to scholars. This has happened with MS collections in Kerala, Mysore and elsewhere. There are exceptions, of course. 

  

What motives and ideas are behind this behaviour? 

  

"Digitization" is a kind of magic word. It is a semiotic sign for participation in a progressive, modern world. It's what you do if you don't know what to do. And "digitization" is also a sign for possession: if a manuscript is digitized it has been grasped or gained in some psychological sense.  A couple of decades ago there was a similar aura surrounding "making a database." It was a self-standing good, and sent out a semiotic sign of ownership and power. "I have a database of the Vedas," was an assertion of power and status independent of the instrumentalization of the database.

  

So perhaps it's reasonably easy to account for a desire to digitize something. (NB I'm not talking about rational reasons, but about irrational motives.)

  

Then, why refuse to share the resulting digital files? Perhaps for all the old reasons, connected with ideas about loss of mana (in the Austronesian sense), fears about making a dreadful mistake, and residual anger resulting from constructions of colonial oppression.

  

Excuse my ramblings!

  

Dominik
