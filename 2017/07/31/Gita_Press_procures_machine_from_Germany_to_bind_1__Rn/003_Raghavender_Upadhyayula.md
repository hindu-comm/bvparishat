Dear Misra Ji,  
  

Indeed a welcome news. We all are, in particular I am, extremely grateful to Gita Press for a tireless service to Sanatana Dharma.  

It is also sorry to hear that the help came from Germany, when India has a sizeable population of rich people who could have donated some money for such a noble cause.  

I hope this opens the eyes of rich Indians.  

  

  

Best Regards,  

Raghavender
