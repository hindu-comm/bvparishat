The verses are very common indeed. A simple Google search for kaṣṭena likhitaṃ will already lead you to some other examples. One cannot be completely certain that none of the scribes who set it down, in one form or another (there are many small variants), was ever hit while copying, but one can be very certain, I would say, that the verse should not be interpreted as expressing such a thing. kaṣṭena here, as normally, simply should be taken as meaning 'with pain(s)', 'with suffering', 'with hardship/difficulty' or the like. The translation with which you express disagreement is rather better than the 'with many a hit' one.
