Namaste

  

I heard from a Digitization expert from Delhi once. He saidmany Indian Libraries with Ancient booksare very unwilling to allow Digitization. They get upset if someone approaches them for this purpose. Strange behavior. Outside scholars don't have a chance toread the books. It is a very closed System.  
  

Namaste  

  

There is another issue of quality of digitization. Often the pdfs of digitized books is unreadable totally or partially. This has to be addressed by technology experts. Only then the whole project will be useful really.
