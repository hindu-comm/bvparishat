I had offered to help Murthy ji but could not meet him due to my commitment with other digitization work. As Shankaraji has said a list or title page photographs if they are made available would be useful. Logistics is an issue with me I cannot travel 30 kms and come home for just 3-4 un-scanned books unless they are extraordinarily rare.. Not all old have been digitized. In my experience in personal collections if there 1000 books then more than 100 books can be re-scanned or will be new books. If the existing scan quality is poor then such books can be re-scanned and it would be great opportunity to do so. Looking forward to a list from Murthy ji.
