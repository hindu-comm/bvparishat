Murthyji,

  

It would be helpful if you share a list of these books. As you know, a large number of Sanskrit books are already digitized by DLI and similar digital libraries and are available on the internet. Re-scanning of the same books can be avoided, by sharing the list with BVP members, some of us can check whether the scans of these books are available on the internet or not.  

  

regards  
shankara
