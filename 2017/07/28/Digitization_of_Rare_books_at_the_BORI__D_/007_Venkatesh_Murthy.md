Namaste

  

I heard from a Digitization expert from Delhi once. He saidmany Indian Libraries with Ancient booksare very unwilling to allow Digitization. They get upset if someone approaches them for this purpose. Strange behavior. Outside scholars don't have a chance toread the books. It is a very closed System.
