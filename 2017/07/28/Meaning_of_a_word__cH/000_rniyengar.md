Respected scholars,

  

Is कोविराल (Koviraala) a Sanskrit word? I could not locate it in any of the available Lexicons. I suspect this may be a word used in some Agama/shilpa texts on temples.

Can it have any linkwith अंतराल (antarAla= intermediate space) a similar sounding word?

  

Is the word कोविरालused in any Indian language for any purpose?

  

My Google /Jstor/Archive search did not produce any results. I would be grateful for any help.

  

Thanks

RN Iyengar
