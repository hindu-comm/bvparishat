Dear Professor Mahanty,

  

  This is a beautiful Guruvandanam. In one line, however, there appears to be a Vr̥ttabhaṅga: यदीया वाचश्चामृतमधुरस्निग्धा: सुसरसा:। In this line, the syllable "ra" in "madhura" becomes Guru before "snigdhāḥ", while the Śikhariṇī meter requires a "laghu" syllable in this spot, as is the case in all your other lines. Some change like यदीया वाचश्चामृतमधुरधारा: सुसरसा: will make the meter work well. With best wishes,
