Namaste!

  

Indic Academy is conducting a4-day intensive coursetitled “**Meaning and History: The Mahābhārata as Itihāsa**” for scholars and students of Mahābhārata, and all those interested in Indic textual studies in general. The course will be at**IGNCA, New Delhi, July 27th to 30th, 2017**.

  

The course adopts a literary and philosophical approach to study of Mahābhārata after providing a thorough philosophical critique of historicism, and racist, anti-Semitic, and arbitrary historical criticism based Indological approaches. The concepts of History and*Itihāsa*are evaluated from the perspective of twentieth century Western philosophical analyses of Time and their relationship with Christian theology and Ancient Greek understanding of Time, and contrast it with Mahābhārata exposition on*kāla*. Nature of*Itihāsa*is analyzed and compared with*mûthos*and modern history writing. And finally, an extended philosophical analysis of selected readings from the text.  
  
The course will be conducted by Prof. Vishwa Adluri and Dr. Joydeep Bagchee, authors of acclaimed book “T*he Nay Science: A History of German Indology*”, the most devastating criticism of Indology and the “historical-critical method” till date. The authors are uniquely qualified to conduct a course like this – they are accomplished philosophers in the Western Continental tradition, studied history of Christian theology, Ancient Greek classics as well as Indian texts deeply, and have made major contribution to Mahābhārata studies – working in English, German, French, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit languages.  
  
I am attaching a PDF flyer with details about the course.**We request you to consider attending this important course and encourage other scholars and students at your organization to participate in this as well**. We request you to distribute the PDF FLYER attached on your internal network. In addition, if you can please send us your mailing address, we would like to send posters for display on the notice boards at your organization.
