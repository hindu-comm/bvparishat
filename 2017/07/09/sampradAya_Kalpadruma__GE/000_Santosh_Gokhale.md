Respected Scholars,

  

I am looking for a PDF version of *Sampradāya Kalpadruma* of *Viṭhṭhaleśa*.  

Would be much obliged if anyone could share a copy of it.  

  

Further, are they any scholars here who have researched further into the thesis that*Jagannātha Paṇḍita* was a descendant of *Vallabhācārya* from his mother’s side? I am aware of R B Athavale's work regarding this (BORI (1968), pp. 415-420).

  

However, I have no further reference which establishes this firmly, and pointers to any research papers on this would be helpful.

  

Further, how does the Puṣṭimārga tradition look at this thesis? Is it a widely held belief in the tradition?  

  

Kind regards,

Santosh Gokhale
