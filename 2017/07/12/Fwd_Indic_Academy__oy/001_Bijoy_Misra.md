I do see various conferences in India with an extra obsession to what  

the western research might have been on the topic. Would it not be more  
appropriate to break new grounds by further analytic study by the local scholars?  

It is possible that people want to be confined to communications in English  

(for whatever purpose) and analyze material available in English language.  

I would strongly encourage scholars and institutions to dig in more into  

the history, geography, morals, customs and the social practices appreciating  

the local values as they themselves observe and practice. Somewhere I think  
that native research is necessary for literature and cultural studies.
Hopefully  
we encourage them that reacting to what others might have written. India must  

find a way to liberate herself from this cultural imposition!
