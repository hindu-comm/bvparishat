Dear Scholars,

In Marathi two ळs are phonated out of which one is retroflex and the other is not. For example in बाळ, कमळ, काळ or नाळ ळ is retroflex however in कळ, मळ, फळ or तळ it is not retroflex. Thus we find two variations in Marathi one retroflex and the other with a plain blade and neither the retroflex nor the plain touch the palate. However in the case of Marathi dialects the ळ is voiced as a dental ल and not as ड़. The conversion of ळ to ड़ however it not so. The ड़ invariably will be voiced as a touch consonant.

What is the situation in Vedic Sanskrit?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
