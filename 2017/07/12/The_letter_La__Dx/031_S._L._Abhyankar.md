Actually the letter ழ் in தமிழ் has in pronunciation of some Tamil words (maybe not all words containing this letter, but yes, some words) has an element of the sound of ड् !!! Note, I am cautiously using the phrase "an element of the sound of ड्". In those pronunciations, it is neither completely ळ् nor completely ड्. By that Tamilians are probably right, that Tamil pronunciations have to be inculcated by being in Tamil environment, not by any formal learning.

  

Tamil friends in the group may please comment, better still, with examples of related words and their pronunciations.
