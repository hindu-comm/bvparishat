In Telugu 'minimal pairs' establishing the phonemic distinction between l and L are as follows:

  

kala = dream ; kaLa = art;

  

kAli = past participle of the verb kAlu =burn; kALi = goddess kALi

  

........  

  

There is a popular scene of a recent Telugu movie in which a Telugu teacher on his deathbed , daunts his student for pronouncing kaLlu =eyes as kallu = a liquor.

..........

  

-L(u) is a plural suffix

  

mullu (sing) = thorn > muLlu (pl) =thorns

  

kaalu =leg \> kaaLlu =legs

  

paalu = part/share/portion \> paaLlu = parts/shares/portions

  

......

  

baDi = school \> baLlu =schools
