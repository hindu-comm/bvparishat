The R̥gveda-Prātiśākhya says: द्वयोश्चास्य स्वरयोर्मध्यमेत्य सम्पद्यते स डकारो ळकार: "Occurring between two vowels, the ड becomes ळ." However, this change is not recorded by Pāṇini, and does not occur in shared verses found in other Vedaśākhās. The Śuklayajuḥ-Prātiśākhya says डढौ ळळ्हौ न माध्यन्दिनीयानाम् "ड and ढ do not become ळ and ळ्ह in the Mādhyandina Śukla Yajurveda." This change is found in the Kāṇva branch of the Śukla Yajurveda which is generally found in Southern India, while the Mādhyandina Śākhā is generally found in Northern India. There is a long-standing debate whether the occurrence of ळ in the R̥gveda, not yet known to Pāṇini, is a phenomenon that developed in some Śākhās due to local language influences. One cannot assume that the "original" R̥gveda necessarily contained this sound. The best we can say is that some Śākhās developed this variation. My own views on the genesis of R̥gvedic Retroflexion are contained in a long article published in 1979. The pdf of this article is too large to be sent as an attachment to this message.
