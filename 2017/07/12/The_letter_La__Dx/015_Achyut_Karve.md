Dear Scholars,

  

The main reason for initiating this thread is to highlight that all studies into the origin of the Vedic Language are around etymology.
Looking to the uniqueness of the Vedic language one has also to look at its evolution from a phonetic and phonological point of view rather than just an etymological one. 

  

If there are at all an papers which deal with the evolution of the Vedic Language from a Phonetic, Phonemic and Phonological angle rather than an etymological one I would be deeply interested in reading them.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
