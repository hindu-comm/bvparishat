Dear Scholars,

It appears that the letter ळ as on date exists only in South India and Western India does it exist in any of the so called Indo European Languages?

My next question would be out of the languages in which it is still prevalent in which of these languages it is just used as a letter in a word and in which of the languages, if any, it used as a suffix?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve
