Namaste,

We can observe that southern india, west and south Maharashtra and gujarat has the pronunciation of ळ in their languages.

The main reason of specifying the regions of Maharashtra is that Marathi in northern Maharashtra doesn't contain ळ as we could listen all the Marathi words containing ळ with replaced pronunciation as ड.

The Northern districts of Maharashtra and some Sothern territories of Madhya Pradesh sharing the boundries with the districts ranging from Nashik to Jalgaon popularly known as "Khandesh" has its clear pronunciation as ड.

केळे= banana = केड़

खेळ = game = खेड़

कमळ =lotus =कमड़, etc.

  

Regards,

Gandhar.
