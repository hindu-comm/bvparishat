Another interesting thing to note about ळ in some Vedic Śākhās is that this is a variant for ड and not for ल, as one sees in the Southern pronunciation \[कमलम् \> कमळम्\]. The occurrence of ळ in Pāli is similar to that in the Vedaśākhās \[Skt दृढ \> Pali दळ्ह, Skt (?) एडमूक \> Pali एळमूग, but Skt बाल remains बाल in Pali\]. In this respect, Pali shares some features found in certain Vedaśākhās.
