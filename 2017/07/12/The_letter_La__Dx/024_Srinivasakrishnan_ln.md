Thank you, Prof Deshpande, for several instructive remarks on the subject. The following remark you made though thought provoking needs to be taken, I feel, with some counterfactuals:

  
  
\> One cannot assume that the "original" R̥gveda necessarily contained this sound.  
  

1\. The ळ sound has a northwest-southeast gradient within south Asia. For example, Bangla is a classic example of a language which falls outside this gradient. It has no ळ  

2\. In Tamil and Malayalam (may be true for Telugu and Kannada too though I cant say), there's a phonemic contrast between ल and ळ. Thus, 'kalam' (vessel) vs 'kaLam' (field), 'kal' (stone) vs 'kaL' (toddy). This is probably not true in north Indian languages which contain the sound. I'm willing to be corrected here.  

3\. The Gurmukhi script does not have it eventhough Punjabi language does have the sound. It's likewise indeed curious that Panini does not record it while a treatise concerned with pronunciation such as the Rg Pratisakhya seems to provide for it.  
  

Thanks and Regards,
