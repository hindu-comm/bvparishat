Dear Sastry,

Possibly from the point of view of the metalanguage of Sanskrit Grammar this attempt might appear futile. However from the point of view of reconstructing the Ur Vedic Language it is necessary that we recreate a proto vedic alphabet. This proto vedic alphabet will help us in decontaminating the modern recitation of the Vedas as also help us to compare the various recensions of the Vedas.

A proto language cannot be built on the basis of a written alphabet with assigned sounds. 

My feeling is that all attempts to build a proto vedic language are deductive in nature i.e. they are being deduced from the alphabet that we speak today. However the problem is that today there is no uniformity in the phonation of the alphabet in various Indian regional languages and this has had its effects on the various recensions of the Vedas. 

Hence it is necessary to use the inductive method with the Maheshwar Sutras as the basis. This can be achieved by evolving sutras with the help of which we will be in a position to determine whether a particular letter in a word has been chastely voiced or not.

By making two sutras viz.,अइउण्andअइउत् we now have two homogeneous अ's,इ's and उ'sinstead of one inspite of being differentiated by pitch and point of phonation. This can be considered a first step towards determining the 18अण्s

Shri Madhav Deshpande has looked at the issue from the point of view of the metalanguage of Sanskrit and he is right in doing so. 

With Regards,

Achyut Karve.
