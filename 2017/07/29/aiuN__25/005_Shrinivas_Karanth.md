Namaste

first of all we have to note that अण् is a letter and not a group of letter.

In the sutra "तपरस्त-.." we get the word अण् from the previous sutra "अणुदित्सवर्णस्य..".

And hence the sutra "तपर.." describes that the अण् followed by तकार or तकार followed by a अण्  is stands for the अण् of same variety and length.. 

अ, इ and उ are अण्s .. But अइउ is not अण्. It is a group of letter.

So तपर-sutra is not applicable here..
