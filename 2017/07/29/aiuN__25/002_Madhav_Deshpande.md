Dear Colleagues, Almost 47 years ago, as a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, I wrote a term paper on the "Pāṇinian Procedure of Taparakaraṇa: A Historical Investigation" for Professor Paul Thieme, and the paper was published in 1972 in a journal that he edited. This is one of those relatively inaccessible journals in India, and hence I am attaching a pdf of this paper for those who may be interested. The paper is rather very long and goes into numerous issues, but may be of some interest. With best wishes.
