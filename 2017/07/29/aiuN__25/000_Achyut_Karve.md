Dear Scholars,

  

From the sutras तपरस्तत्कालस्य and अदेङ्गुण: it follows that अत्, इत्, and उत् are capable of being derived and in addition अत् being defined as guna in the sutra अदेङ्गुण: we can form the sutra अइउत् which will be a guna sutra of the first Maheshwar Sutra अइउण्. On the recitation of the two sutras अइउण् and अइउत् one after the other one will notice a change in pitch of the two sutras on account of a change in the points of phonation of the अण्s. If the above derivation is faulty please share the reasons thereof.



I urge scholars to reflect on the above concept and comment. 

  

I am posting this idea of mine as I could not hold myself. However, if this idea has been previously conceived I urge scholars to share the same with me.

  

I am putting all my strength and conviction together to share this post.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
