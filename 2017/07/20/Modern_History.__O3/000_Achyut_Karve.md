Dear Scholars,

  

Dear Scholars,

  

We have been made to believe that proper history starts from written history. Chronology does play a role in history. By history is not just chronology.. The reason why modern history or more particularly western history starts from written material is that they could not evolve a system of oral transmission as their languages were prone to mutations.
This might be they reason why they were forced to evolve writing even when they had not identified the various speech sounds that constituted speech.

  

On the other hand the Vedic people evolved a system that was immutable and could be transferred from one generation to another by the word of mouth. Having evolved such a system resulted in apathy towards evolving a written script inspite of having identified all the speech sounds in the Vedic Language.

  

The reason for this apathy is that literature handed down from one generation by the word of mouth was considered नित्य and that the written one was believed to be अनित्य. The belief in the immutability of the oral tradition is epitomized in the word अक्षर ब्रह्म.

  

I request scholars to dwell on the subject.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
