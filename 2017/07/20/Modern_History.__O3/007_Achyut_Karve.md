Dear Paturiji,

  

There is one more aspect that needs to be reconciled and that is the movement from the Samhita form of discourse - which is unique to the Vedas and Slokas and Sutras which do not abide by the metre - to a sentence being made of separate words. The word form of a sentence is the universal form in which discourses are written. This material shift reflects mutations taking place in the phonetic pattern in the population.

  

If you find material or discussions or references on the above aspects and those in the mail before please let me know. It will be very helpful to me in furthering my studies into अपभ्रंश or mutated languages.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
