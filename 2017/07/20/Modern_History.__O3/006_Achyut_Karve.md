Dear Paturiji,

Thank you for generating the references.

There are many concepts that have been generated in Indian scriptural tradition which possibly are not to be found any where elsewhere. Take the case of sacrifice (yajna) versus worship. Or शब्द and अपशब्द or प्रयोग and शास्त्र, योग. Surely these concepts are a product of a unique tradition which has evolved and bred in this land.

The most unique of these concepts was the term akshara.  
Can you tell me one language other than an Indian one which uses all the 25 consonants. I do not know of any.  
This is the reason why I am pursuing the matter. Without investigating the rich source of tribal languages blindly accepting theories propounded by the west is unacceptable.

Whether the origin of the Vedas is in or outside India matters very little. Not to independently study our own languages is surely a sin we are allowing ourselves to commit.

As matters stand today we cannot reconcile the nuances of the contemporary indian formal languages and present a cohesive comparative study of these languages leave alone reconciling dialects. This has political ramifications for the future.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
