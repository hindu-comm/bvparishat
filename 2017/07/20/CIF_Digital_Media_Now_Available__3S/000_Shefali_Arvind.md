    *Chapter 1*

> Jīvanmuktiviveka is an important Vedāntic treatise mainly dealing with > topics that are related to the state of Jīvanmukti, that is, ‘being > free or liberated even while living’.

  

-   ***[Manīṣā-pañcakam](https://www.chinfo.org/index.php/shop-now/english/manisha-panchakam-detail)***
    or the Pentad on Conviction is a set of five verses composed by Ādi
    Śaṅkarācārya. This introductory treatise on Vedānta is categorised
    as a Prakaraṇa-grantha. In just five verses, Śrī Śaṅkara elucidates
    the four Mahāvākyas in most lucid manner, making this text
    invaluable for any student of Advaita-vedānta.
