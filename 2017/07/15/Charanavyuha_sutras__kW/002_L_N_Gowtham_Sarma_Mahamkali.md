Thank you for your reply ganesh.  
I have gone through saunaka kruta Charanavyuha well. Every Charanavyuha that maybe saunka ukta, katyayana ukta or kautsa ukta will have four khandas i.e. for four vedas. Every Charanavyuha related to which Veda will have some exclusive information about it's Veda. The Rig Veda charanavyuha will have more about Rigveda and comparatively less information about the rest. Similarly the katyayana ukta Charanavyuha will have more information about yajur Veda when compared to other Vedas I have the above said 3 Charanavyuhas and and wanted to know about exclusive Charanavyuhas of Krishna yajur Veda and samavedam
