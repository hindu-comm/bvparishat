Dear Shriram,

One who has trained himself to appreciate the intricacies of Indian Classical vocal music will surely appreciate the sloka. By the advent of the sitar unfortunately the vina has gone out of vogue in North Indian Classical music. In fact the advent of the sitar changed the format of North Indian Classical music by the evolution of the Agra Gharana of North Indian Classical music.

Appreciate the reference provided.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
