In याज्ञवल्क्य स्मृति (Yajnavalkya Smriti (vide sloka no. 115 of Yati Prakarana)), the instrument 'vina" has been extolled and said that one who knows the intricacies of playing Vina attains moksha.



वीणावादनतत्वज्ञः श्रुतिजातिविशारदः ।तालज्ञश्चाप्रयासेन मोक्षमार्गं नियच्छति ॥ (११५)



In tantra shAstra, Goddess Raja Matangi is appeased with vINa vAdana.
Also, one should give due respect to vaiNikAs (who who plays the vINa) and if one insults them, one incurs the wrath of Yoginis associated with Raja Matangi. 



Regs,

Sriram
