Dear Members,

As I enjoyed this post about the exalted spiritual status of Veena music at another site, I wanted to share it here with BVP. Satsanga even in the e-space makes one to share and spread happiness.

True to this, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a link to the video of the Utsavam at Srirangam with Veena recital, from Sri Sreyas Sarangan. I think he is a member of BVP. I hope he does not mind if I share that video link with BVP. With due thanks to the persons behind the video and its spread including Sri Sarangan.

धन्योस्मि

नारायणः
