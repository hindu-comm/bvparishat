Shivers go down my spine as I hear the word Veena. What a tragedy that this instrument has totally vanished from the stage of North Indian Classical music. This is what history does. North Indian Classical music evolved in the courts of Nawabs and princesses. The moment the courts vanished so did its music. Whilst South Indian Classical music was bread in the temples and so it will continue to enthral human minds until the temples last.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
