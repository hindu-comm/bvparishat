Dear Deshpandeji,

I went through your article. The article contains views expressed from time to time on the a subject of phonetics and phonology by various authorities. However in the end you have rightly pointed out that the science of Sanskrit phonetics as well as phonology needs to be resurrected for various reasons.

My post is just a step towards it.

I will have to translate the article before I make my points on the article.

I would however love to read articles written by you on the subject as they will surely help me in building a perspective on such a difficult subject.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
