It boils down to a "word" and its "meaning."  

For some reason the western science did develop in identifying objects.  

That the object could be manifestation of a concept is a more nuanced  

analysis and is steeped in the view of the universe and the definition of  

an object. Then the western theories have dominated with the art of  

teaching language and hence the behavioral angle. Transcending from  

a "sound" to the human signature is gradually coming up. Though it  

is fundamental, we do not have sensors to measure the minute time  

scales of thought processing. We may see more in our life time.
