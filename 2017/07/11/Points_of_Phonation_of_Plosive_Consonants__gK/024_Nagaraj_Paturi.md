\>It goes to the credit of our vedic composers who could make, feel and demonstrate that difference.

------ Yes, well established by now. Contribution of Shikshaa granthas and other Vedic texts to contemporary articulatory phonetics is widely recognised.

\>Modern linguists have still not been in a position to demonstrate the difference between the articulation of speech sounds and sounds  

\>Modern linguists concern themselves only with scripted sounds rather than the live articulated ones of which they have no clue.  

---- This is not correct.

You may begin with something like<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics>

and study further.

Its a huge field with huge amount of Experimental techniques listed in the same page.

Modern technology is utilized as in

Please, please do not make sweeping negative comments on the contemporary disciplines in the name of praising Vedic Sciences.

This does disservice rather than service to Vedic Sciences.

You can save a lot of your efforts in reinventing the wheel by studying what is already studied, researched and found.

We can contribute from our own study or drawing from the Vedic Sciences only by acknowledging the previous stage of the body of knowledge to which our study belongs.
