Dear Scholars,

I am reminded the way an earlier thread ended  
Quote from Shri Madhav Deshpande's earlier mail.

"I note that you have very different views regarding all these issues.
I have given my reasoning with textual evidence known to me, and referred to relevant research, and I rest my case. With best wishes,"

However with the experience that I now have, having followed the group for a couple of months, I wish that the present post be viewed more pragmatically rather than esoterically.

In view of the fact that each one of us has an organ of speech which we use for communication our study needs to go further than how we use our lingual organ to communicate through a particular language. A particular language need not use all the lingual sounds that are potentially available. It uses a select few from these and evolves them into a language. Hence the differences in the lingual sounds that each language uses results in the uniqueness of each language. Thus each language might use a different set of lingual sounds of which some might be common to all languages. 

The problematic I am trying to address is what are the potentially available lingual consonants that are available to man as a species which has a defined physiological lingual apparatus which then go into the evolution of a particular language. The Maheshwar Sutras contain those which can be organized in a Sutra form. There can be many more consonants which cannot be presented in sutra form. Whilst on the other hand phonological and phonetic studies have tried to classify lingual sounds found in various languages including Sanskrit. Whether Sanskrit uses all the potential lingual sounds is another question.

There arose some pertinent questions in my mind while I was grappling with instructing children how to recite the consonants of the devnagari alphabet. The main among them was whether the following letter of a particular class of consonants be phonated posteriorly to the one before or anteriorly to the one before or at the same place as the previous consonant Viz. All consonants of a class are articulated at one single point . 

As is obvious in the diagram थ is phonated posteriorly to त. And so is the case with the other class of plosive consonants. Grammar being a science to make an individual doubt free and confident about usage, I would request the esteemed members of this group whether the depiction in the diagram is correct or misplaced. Plosive consonants being touch consonants identifying their exact place of phonation in vivo in the oral cavity should not pose problems.

I hope that the members will help me out of the enigma.

With Regards,  
Achyut Karve.
