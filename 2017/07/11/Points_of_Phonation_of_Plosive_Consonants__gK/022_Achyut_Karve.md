Dear Mishraji,

Mishraji has correctly pointed out that there is a basic difference between sounds and speech. Aksharas mean sounds used in speech
articulation and whilst sounds mean other sounds that humans are capable of making. Modern linguists have still not been in a position to demonstrate the difference between the articulation of speech sounds and sounds. Coughing, sneezing, mimicking sounds of other birds and animals and other such sounds are not speech sounds. On the other hand Modern linguists concern themselves only with scripted sounds rather than the live articulated ones of which they have no clue. It goes to the credit of our vedic composers who could make, feel and demonstrate that difference.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
