Dear Prof. Deshpande,

Thanks a lot for sharing both the papers. They are invaluable. I read the वैशिष्ट्ये long back.

Yes, the variations in the pronunciations were there for hundreds of years along with specific vocabulary of Sanskrit (बिडाल in what is now Gujarat but मार्जार in what is now Maharashtra; or पाणी in Gujarati and Marathi but जल in Bengali, and so on).

Thanks once again.

Best,

H.
