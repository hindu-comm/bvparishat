Dear Shri Karve,

  

The distinction between त and थ is not because of a difference between their sthānas or point of articulation, which happens to be exactly the same. The difference between these two sounds is because त is voiceless and without aspiration (अघोष, अल्पप्राण), while थ is voiceless and with aspiration (अघोष, महाप्राण). In contrast, द is voiced and without aspiration (घोषवत्, अल्पप्राण), while ध is voiced and with aspiration (घोषवत्, महाप्राण). These distinctions have been fully understood by the Sanskrit phoneticians. All these four sounds have the same point of articulation, with differences in phonation (अनुप्रदान). I don't know what is the source of your diagram, but that diagram is full of errors, and should not be relied upon to make new assumptions.
