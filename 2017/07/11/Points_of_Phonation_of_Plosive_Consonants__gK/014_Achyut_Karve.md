Dear Mishraji,

The relationship between word and meaning is on account of Samskara. It can be interpreted in terms of Pavlov's experiment.

Once a friend of mine taught a two year old to recognize a cat by the the word dog and a sparrow with a crow and vice a versa. The child had no problem calling a cat a dog and a crow a sparrow. When the mother noticed it she was at first astonished however when my friend told that he had so taught him she then corrected the child.

What I want to underscore here is that there is no mystical relationship between a word and it's meaning. Language is a social activity.
Letters and letter phrases (words) by themselves have no meaning.
Meaning is addused through a process of adaptation.

I have been a student of the tabla which uses letters and letter phrases. I have all these years been intrigued by the thought that how is it that these letters and letter phrases of the tabla do not elicit worldly meaning. The reason for the same still eludes me. The uniqueness of a word form needs to be further investigated.

Thus in Sanskrit a root has ascribed meaning which so to say is incapable of conveying meaning until it assumes the form of a pada or word. That this movement from a root to its word form has been formalized in Sanskrit is what baffles me. It is this ideation of the process of word formation in Sanskrit that needs to be investigated at a neuro physiological level.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
