Dear Mishraji,

Normally that is in resting state an individual breathes in with the help of the diaphram. In stressfull activity he breathes with the help of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles of the chest. However exhaling is achieved by relaxing the active muscles active during inhalation. Thus normally inhaling is controlled however exhaling is natural and fast. This process is used while speaking and is termed as Pulmonary egressive mechanism However in the case of Vedic Sanskrit the breathing process is different. I have termed this process as the Diaphragmatic air expulsion mechanism. This mechanism operates the way we do Kapalbhati. This method helps control exhalation during phonation. 

I have described the process of phonation in my book Unveiling the Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology at the beginning of Chapter 7 - The physiological characteristic of phonation of plosive letters. Find below the relevant portion.  

"a) Sanskrit is a unique language in that, letters and words are voiced only with the aid of the diaphragmatic air expulsion mechanism.

b\) We say, consonants distinguish themselves from non-consonants  
or vowels by the manner in which they are articulated. Consonants are by nature plosive. For this to happen, it is necessary that voicing be done in  
a particular manner. The details thereof are given below:

i\. Air needs to be expelled from the lungs to produce each speech sound.

ii\. The tongue needs to shape itself in a specific way to produce a particular speech sound.

iii\. Attention needs to be paid to the area of contact of the lips while voicing प class consonants.

iv\. There are specific points on the lips, the roof of the oral cavity and the pharynx, where alone if the tongue is pressed, it generates specific consonants.

v\. For an explosion to take place, energy needs to be released instantaneously.

vi\. When the tongue is pressed at certain specific points in the oral cavity, the back of the tongue blocks the passage of air through the pharynx into the oral and nasal  
cavity, while simultaneously pushing the diaphragm upwards with the help of the abdominal muscles. Thus producing a positive pressure in the larynx and the trachea.

vii\. When the tongue is released by drawing it backward, air gushes out through the mouth resulting in a plosive sound.

viii\. When a letter is voiced discreetly, the tongue is drawn backward thus regaining its neutral position i.e., lying on the floor of the oral cavity.

ix\. The larynx plays the role of sound creation and of tone and pitch modulation.

Note: It is important, that the tongue be drawn backward while voicing of a letter. In case the tongue is pushed forward, it means that the pulmonic  
egressive mechanism has been used to voice the letter. Using the diaphragmatic air expulsion  
mechanism, is the unique characteristic of Sanskrit phonation, and hence the production of plosive  
letters. The diaphragmatic air expulsion mechanism resembles the one used while doing Kapalbhati Yogic exercise."

I hope your question is answered.  

I have no access to a library. If possible kindly send me the link.
