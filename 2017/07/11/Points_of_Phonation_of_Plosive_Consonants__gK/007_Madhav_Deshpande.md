Dear Hemantji,

  

  Thanks for pointing to my Marathi article on this subject. For easy reference, I have attached a pdf of that article.  I want to point out that there are no fixed points of articulation along the oral cavity. Each language makes choices along what is physically a continuum of a curve. Sanskrit, theoretically, makes a certain set of choices as described in the Prātiśākhyas and Śikṣās, but these texts themselves offer alternative points of articulation for sounds like "r" ranging from danta, dantamūla, barsvya, to mūrdhanya, giving us a glimpse of dialectal variation in the pronunciation of Sanskrit. Modern Sanskrit pronunciation is largely guided by the pronunciation of the mother tongues, but it was like this probably for hundreds of years, some of the variation being noted in the Prātiśākhyas and Śikṣās.
