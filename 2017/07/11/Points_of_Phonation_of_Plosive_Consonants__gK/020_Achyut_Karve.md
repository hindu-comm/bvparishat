Dear Mishraji,

For the past 30 years or so I was looking subject exclusively from a phonetic point as I was engaged in finding out the relationship between recitation of the compositions of the tabla and the technique of playing it on the tabla.

My study of phonetics in relation to language and child development is not more than ten years.

Presently I am working with 5 to 10 year olds. Here I will be in a position to observe the relationship between phonetics, concept generation and memory.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
