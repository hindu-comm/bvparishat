Achyutji,  

Possibly you are confusing between the physical sound versus human expression.  

The latter is utterly internal. You may gain studying Sri Aurobindo's  

essays in English or grammarian Bharthari in Sanskrit. I can send you a paper  

where we dealt with the neuro-science of speech ( bit technical, please write privately).  
Language is not what we speak, but what we think. The Vedas have good exposition  
also.  

You have to throw away the Pavlovian approach. In such models, language is  

supposed to be learned. You have to reflect yourself and come to your conclusion.  

Best regards,  

BM
