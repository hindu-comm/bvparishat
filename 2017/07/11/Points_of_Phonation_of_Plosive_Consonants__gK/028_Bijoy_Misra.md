Achyutji,  

You seem to continue to be hung up on "sounds".  

The organ movement is prescribed through the  
shikshA literature. The sound is a function of the  
exhalation through an oral architecture. The latter  
is defined for a class than for individual letters.  
You may refer to Panini's book to get an orientation.  

While you may continue your teaching, that is not  

how a classicist would approach the subject.  

Possibly some breathing principles are also involved  

which I have only examined superficially. Try reading  

PratishakhyA literature.  

Best regards,  

BM
