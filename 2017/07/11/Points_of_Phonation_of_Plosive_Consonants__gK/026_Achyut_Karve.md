HiDear PaturijiI,

I will surely go through the references.  
However none of the books buttress their claims with an audio or video track. How will any one know the pronunciation of any letter of the author on the basis of which one can interpret the writings. The international community also doesn't seem to have brought out standard phonation of each of the letters.  
The intention of the Maheshwar Sutras is not only to generate pratyaharas but also as a means of instructing articulation of chaste letters. I have used and am using the Maheshwar Sutras for instructing letters successfully to children and grownups alike and they have proved successful. More than being an aid to instruct letters I have also used the maheshwar Sutras successfully for correction of articulation in those who have speech defects. Once Dharma is instituted there is no cause for Adharma to stay put. It vanishes into thin air all by itself.

We need to distinguish between what one means as phoneme and what we mean by akshara. By phoneme we mean any of the perceptually distinct units of sound in a specified language that distinguish one word from another, for example p, b, d, and t in the English words pad, pat, bad, and bat. Whereas an akshara is an inextinguishable permanent नित्य, सिद्ध speech sound not just a human sound. Each individual needs to search this for himself in himself because we are hard wired for it.
The Maheshwar Sutras are just a recipie for identifying them. Thus surely akshara is not that which is commonly uttered in words and rendered in script as the west tend to interpret it. And hence what is meant to be conveyed in the script is not akshara but a phoneme.

This is what I wanted to bring out. A change in approach alone will help overcome the confusion in which the subject matter of points of phonation of consonants is mired. I expected that some one from the community will supply an alternative diagram for each of the plosive consonants. Instead they chose to rebuke my diagram and added ' In short, the diagram is at best confusing and useless for all practical purposes'. Or ' I don't know what is the source of your diagram, but that diagram is full of errors, and should not be relied upon to make new assumptions.'

I do not intend to hurt any individual or the community.

All I wish is that wisdom will ultimately prevail.

At the cost of repetition I am attaching a improptu clip of a child in whom I was in a position to correct lipsing with the help of the Maheshwar Sutras.
