Is त वर्ग (post-)alveolar? Or is त वर्ग both (post-)laveolar and palatal? Or Is क वर्ग both velar and pharyngeal? (I assume that the diagram represents Sanskrit phonemes. Marathi and Assamese, for instance, have different phonation than Sanskrit respectively for the palatal and dental and retroflex sounds). The present day pronunciation of Sanskrit differ from place to place (like that of Latin in Europe); the articulation of ज्ञ andऋ for instance.

In short, the diagram is at bestconfusing and useless for all practical purposes.  

Best,

H.

  

PS: In case one wants to understand ancient Sanskrit phonetics, one can start with S. K. Chatterjee's The Pronunciation of Sanskrit in *Turner Volume* (*Indian Linguistics*, 1960, vol. 21, pp. 61-82. For ancient Indian observations on (Sanskrit) phonetics, see Siddheshvar Varma's*Critical studies in the Phonetic**Observations of Indian**Grammarians* and W. S. Allen's *Phonetics in Ancient India*.
