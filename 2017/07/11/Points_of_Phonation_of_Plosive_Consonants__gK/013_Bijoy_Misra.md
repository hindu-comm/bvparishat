Dear Achyutji,  
  
Madhavji makes an excellent technical point. The letter articulation in classical Sanskrit  
is prescriptive and not empirical. The prescription makes it scientific and precise. The  
melody and the mapping capacity of converting ideas into sounds is also hence made  
scientific. The variations are through vocal chord and airflow manipulation in the consonants  
and time measures and intonation in the vowels. The cosmological implications of the  

class of consonants analyzing their origin would be a good scientific study.  

  
The teaching of letters to the children is done through sounds (as done to me) and not  
through precision. The question can come regarding whether a letter in the Sanskrit  
alphabet is a sound token or it is the product of a signature manipulation of the oral  
muscles. It is the latter that makes it "classical". It is also the reason why many  
untrained Sanskrit recitations sound artificial and distorted.  

  

At the same time, I have not seen any analytic paper that examines the full range of  

independent human sounds from the point of view of muscle manipulation.
International  

Phonetic Alphabet lists various observed sounds in the world, but we need phonetic  

imaging to check the difference in the empirical use.  IPA is done to check how  

different language speakers can articulate English sounds. What we have to check  

if Chinese or Arabic sounds can be mapped into Sanskrit alphabet. If not, why not?  

Knowledgeable people might know more.  

  

Best regards,
