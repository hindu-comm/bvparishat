I have attached an article of mine giving a brief history of the theories of Sanskrit phonetics. The Śivasūtras are a particular listing of Sanskrit sounds, but by themselves they do not provide phonetic definitions of these listed sounds. For that, one needs to look at the Prātiśākhyas and the Śikṣās. The extant Śikṣās are generally later than the available Prātiśākhyas. These texts provide phonetic definitions that occasionally reflect dialectal differences in the pronunciation of Sanskrit in the various Vedic Śākhās.
