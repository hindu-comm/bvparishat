Achyutji,  
Excellent. Just keep studying.  

There is difference between sound and speech.  

Just go bit deeper than recitation.  

Please appreciate that word is a tool, it is a limitation.  

Think what produces speech, why we speak etc.  

You can do scientific experiment on your own speech than observing others.  

We need to study our voice and than hearing others (try hearing internally).  

I think we have exhausted our discussion on this (at least my part!)  

Best regards,  
BM
