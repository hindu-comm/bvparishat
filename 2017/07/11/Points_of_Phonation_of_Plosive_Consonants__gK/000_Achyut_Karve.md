Dear Scholars,

  

Find below a diagram showing the different points at which each of the plosive consonant is articulated. Note that in the case of the च ट and त class consonants the shape of the tongue changes however the area of phonation of the consonants remains the same. These points have the unique characteristic that the tongue can be pressed against each of these points. Also note that the consonants of the क च ट and त class consonants can be articulated in two different areas of the oral cavity. There can be no more consonants than these because the points at which the tongue or the lips in the case of प class consonants can be pressed against the Alveolar, Palatal, Velar and Pharyngeal areas of the oral cavity are finite and fixed.

I would like that the esteemed scholars of the group to comment.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
