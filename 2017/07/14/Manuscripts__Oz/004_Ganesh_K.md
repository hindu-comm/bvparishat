Namah:

  

Please note that you will have delay in reading my inputs as it is highly moderated.

  

1\) Uddamareshwara tantra manuscript was known to many old upasakas as we see in preface of the published portion of guhyanamasaahasra. This also however is similar to the stotra khanda of brahmanda and khila of markandeya which are not in the published formats.

2)The purva bhaga of rudrayamala is considered to be Devirahasya available in print (however this should have more of other portions that are not published,especially the yamala cult).

3)the nitya shodashikarnava with bhashya is available in print and is part of the vamakeswari tantra along with the yoginirahasya

  

Only the guruparampara were these are preserved are of some help however have its on secrecy dealing with these as you might know well that these should follow strict adhikara nirnaya with tightly coupled guru shishya banda and yoginishaktisaadya.

  

regards,

Ganesh K.
