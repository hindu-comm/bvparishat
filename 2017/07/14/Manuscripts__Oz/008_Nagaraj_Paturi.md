Dear Sri Ganesh K,

  

I did not change your posting permission status. It was already under 'allowed' (not moderated) category.

  

As a general note, let me clarify:

  

To keep a certain id under moderation

  

1\. does not make the moderators happy.

  

2\. Moreover it increases the burden on the moderators.

  

3\. But moderators take this step when they see potential for impolite or spoilsport or trouble-creating messages from the id.

  

4\. This is done not as a punishment.

  

5\. **This is done to keep the situation under control and keep the option of asking the member to re-post the message after removing impolite or spoilsport or trouble-creating aspects included, most of the times unwittingly, in the message.**

  

6\. Members who were requested to re-post with such changes might remember how their messages with changes were promptly posted.

  

7\. This exercise behind the screens minimises the 'annoying' posts.

  

8\. Total avoiding of such posts is not possible because we never know when an unsuspected can post an avoidable message.
