Hello,

  

Thank you all for your kind replies. However both the documents you have pointed me to, are not the correct scriptures. Both of these are wrongly attributed as Vamakeshwara tantram but is "Nitya Shodashikarnava" which is allegedly a part of the Vamakeshwara tantra. You can confirm this by a cursory look on these scripture \[It begins with the sarva siddhikari stuti which is most celebrated among many Shrividya lineages\]. The Vamakeshwara tantra as whole is said to house various sahasranamas, kavachas and stutis of paramba \[ Famed Khadgamala /Shuddha Shakti Sambudyanta Mala being one\].

  

And the Uddamareshwara Tantra being printed by Chowkambha is probably wrongly attributed or may be a small part of the original tantra. This tantra is said have various patalas and kalpas related to Ucchishta Ganapathi and other forms of Gananatha. This was one of the main textual authority of Ganapathya philosophy. However this version of the tantra focuses on nothing but shatkarmas and yakshini upasanas.

  

Thank you and I humbly appreciate your replies. Please let me know if any of you own a copy or point me to someone who does. Thank you much.

  

Best Regards

Suhas Srinivasa Bhat
