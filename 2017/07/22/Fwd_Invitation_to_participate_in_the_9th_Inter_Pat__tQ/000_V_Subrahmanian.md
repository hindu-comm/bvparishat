Namaste  
  

I have attended this program a couple of times and have found it very interesting. The Trust is doing a very sincere job for the last 7 years in conducting this program with a huge spending. I would recommend people to attend this program which is free and even lunch is served. It is everywhere Veda, Sanskrit, etc. sattva.
