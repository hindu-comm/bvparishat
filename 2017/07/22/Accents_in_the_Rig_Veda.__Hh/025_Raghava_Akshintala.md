Thank you Sri Nagaraj Paturi garu. Sri Vishwanadha Acyutadeva Rayalu was the elder son of the celebrated Kavi Samrat Sri Viswanatha Satyanarayana (who won Jnanpeeth Award for his book Ramayana Kalpavriksham).

  

Sri Rayalu had conducted a deep study of Vedas and had a very unique insight. He had written several articles (in Telugu) and published them in 5 volumes titled "Vedaravindamu". The articles are available individually at<https://vedaravindamu.wordpress.com/>

  

I would also like to bring to notice of this august body of scholars another book that is relevant to this discussion, viz. Svarasiddhāntacandrikā of Srinivasa Yajvan, edited by Sri K. A. Sivaramakrishna Sastri and published in 1936 as part of “Annamalai University Sanskrit Series – 4”. This book is an exhaustive commentary on Pāṇini’s Svarasūtras.

  

The book is available for download at <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.313390>

  

A text version of the introduction in English is available at <https://vedaravindamu.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/sri-srinivasa-yajvas-svarasiddhantacandrika-introduction-in-english/> (please excuse typos).

  

Regards,

A Raghava Krishna
