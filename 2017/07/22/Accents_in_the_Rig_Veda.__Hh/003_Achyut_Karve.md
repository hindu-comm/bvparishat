Dear Shri Madhav Deshpande,

In the event the accents are unmarked can they be reconstructed with the help of Paninian grammar.  
In short had we had recensions of the Rig Veda without accent markings would we have been in a position to reconstruct the accents independently.

The reason for asking this question is I have at hand a manuscript of the compositions of the tabla without accent markings. I need to go about marking the accents. How far can Sanskrit help me achieve this task?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
