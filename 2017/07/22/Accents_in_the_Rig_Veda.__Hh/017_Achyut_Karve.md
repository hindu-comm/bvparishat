Dear Nilakantha Dash,

  

The three i.e.music, mantra chanting and speech grades appear to be different. However that they are the product of a single mechanism i.e., the madhyama (articulation of speech sounds) in speech is what is important. Does this mechanism operate in three discreet and different modes? If so what are they?

  

It is important to note that Western Music evolved out of a string instrument mathematically. That is not the case with Indian Classical Music. Indian Music evolved from recitation be it Rig Vedic, Sama Vedic or Yajur Vedic. In other words the difference of forms in recitation of the Vedas is on account of a subtle differetiation in the use of the human voice organ which the Indians innovated.

  

Yadnyavalkya in his shiksha describes how musical notes could be produced with the help of the technique of Udatta, Annudatta and Swarita and in the process linked Rig Vedic recitation with Sama Vedic recitation. With the Tabla the recitation is that which is used in the recitation of the Rig Veda. The compositions of the Tabla are not sung. In this sense the recitation of the compositions are different from vocal music.

  

In fact a detailed study of Indian Classical Music and of percussion instruments like the Pakhawaj, the Mridingum and the Tabla which have a language of their own will help analyse the recitation of the Vedas.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
