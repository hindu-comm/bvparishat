Dear Paturiji,

  

I am not Sanskrit literate. If there is an English translation it would be helpful.

  

Secondly I have tried to describe the articulatory process or मध्यमा of Udatta and Anudatta. This aspect does not seem to have been dwelt with in the reference of the previous discussions. I would like scholars to dwell on the articulatory or Madhyama aspect among the Vaikhari, Madhyama, Pashyanti and Para.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
