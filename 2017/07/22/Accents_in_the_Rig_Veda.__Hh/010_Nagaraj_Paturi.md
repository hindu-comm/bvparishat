This discussion is a digression from the ASU discussion.

  

Let us be careful with the words pitch, frequency etc.

  

Both svaras within an octave (such as mandra, madhya, taaraa ) and the octaves themselves and the the voice types voice ranges (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_type>) such as tenor, dass etc. are issues of frequency. Loudness is amplitude.

  

ASU, as Prof. Iyengar reminded from the books on history of Indian music, is an issue related to svaras within an octave.

  

Voice range issue that is being pointed out here can be discussed as a different thread.
