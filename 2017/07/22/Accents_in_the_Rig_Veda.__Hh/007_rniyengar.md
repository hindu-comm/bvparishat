Anudātta, Swarita, Udātta (Asu)

This topic would be of perennial interest in the context of Vedic cultural practices, not just limited to RV. I like to present a few points that may seem quite tangential to what is being discussed in the thread, but which I sincerely feel are relevant to Vedic Studies. The dictionary meanings given for accent and intonation are insufficient to characterize the Vedic ASU-triplet. My argument is, it is this triplet which became seven in the case of the Sāmaveda. Perhaps in the Yajus we can find the transition between the three and the seven. I have read (correction requested) that the SV is textually same as RV, the difference being in its rendering (chanting performance) only. This provides a clue to what originally ASU could have been. This is the origin of frequency modulation which forms the foundation of classical music. This is not a new finding any way! While expert opinions on what constitutes ASU are many, attempts at objective definitions are scarce. I know of one fundamental research work

***Ragas of Karnatic Music, by N.S.Ramachandran Univ. Of Madras 1938***.

He discusses (Tamil Nadu) RV chanting at length and concludes if S=1, then A=8/9 and U=10/9 in terms of their basic frequencies as harmonic sound waves. This is based on concepts of music but that need not deter one if one likes to map regional variations of ASU in RV. This does not exhaust all the questions related to RV tradition but points to one important discriminator which in oral recitation gets confused with loudness and regional style in pronunciation of the aksharas and the time wise rendering or speed. When ASU text markings remain same but rendered differently, we can suspect that in the above triplet (8/9, 1, 10/9) the first and/or the third values have been altered. Does this or any other attested triplet style remain stable during a long recitation? This is a moot question. Only systematic spectral analysis of recordings using modern mathematical methods can show a way forward.

Thanks
