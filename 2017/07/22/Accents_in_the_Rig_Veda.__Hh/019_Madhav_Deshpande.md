In my opinion, the accents of Sanskrit need to be viewed in two different contexts, namely the accents of spoken colloquial Sanskrit, and the accents as they are rendered in the recitation of the Vedas.
The identification of the accents with musical notes like gandhāra etc. (as in Shriramana Sharma's document) and a more elaborate identification with musical notes in texts like the Nārada-Śikṣā represent musicalization of the recitational tradition over long periods of time.
The natural accents of spoken Sanskrit on the other hand, as described by Patañjali (and the Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā) are relative high and low pitch levels within the range of a given person (the important term is samānayame = in the same key). Two people speaking Sanskrit (or any other language for that matter) do not speak in the same key, and the women and children generally speak in a higher pitch, and yet their speech can reflect relative pitch differences. The historical accent of Sanskrit begins with this natural relative pitch differences (high = udātta, low = anudātta, transition from high to low = svarita), but in the recitation of the Vedas, these differences were rendered in terms of musical notes. Wayne Howard's study of the Sāmavedic recitation shows that different reciters evidently used different keys, and yet maintained relative differences between different notes. In some of the modern recordings of Vedic recitation, I hear an accompanying instrument like a Veena, and that shows a full musicalization of the Vedic recitation. To my perception, the Veda recitation in Maharashtra is not as musicalized as it appears to be in the South, and the range of high and low notes in Maharashtra seems to be smaller than that in the Southern recitation.
