Dear scholars, I feel like writing. Mr Achyut karve wants to know the rules that would help him putting accent (or some theoritical) marks on tabla notations. Musical books have marks on letters. They follow some different rule. Music notation marking is not applicable to Tabla also.

Udatta, anudatta and svarita of Veda, pratisakhya and paniniya siksa are different. Again there one may find anta, adi and madhya differences.

Again Madhyama, vaikhari, pashyanti and para are something different.

So I feel, these are three different methods and process related to
music, mantra chanting and speech grades. Thank you.
