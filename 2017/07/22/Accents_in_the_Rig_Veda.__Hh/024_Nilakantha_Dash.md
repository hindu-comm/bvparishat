Thanks Mr Achyut Karve and Prof Nagaraj Paturi. This discussion leads to many truth and contemporary knowledge. The book (pdf) sent by Prof Deshpande is a big book on the right subject.

I think it is better to listen some vedic chanting live. or some vedic prayer live (like the suprabhatam live done every morning in Venkateswaram temple of Tirupati for about 15 minutes - Kaushalya supraja-----). I know it is very difficult to stand there around 3.30 am. But it is once in a life-time experience. No recorded version is equal to listening live there what 7 vedic pundits chant.

Thank you.
