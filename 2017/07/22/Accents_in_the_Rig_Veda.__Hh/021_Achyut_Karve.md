Dear Shri Madhav Deshpande,

Is there any article written on the use of the larynx in intonation.
For many years I was unable to exactly reason out the up and down movement of the larynx in speech until I discovered that this movement is on account intonation of vowels during speech.

If you have any references kindly share them.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
