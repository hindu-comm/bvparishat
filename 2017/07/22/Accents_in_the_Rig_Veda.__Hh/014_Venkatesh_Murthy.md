*Namaste*

In my humble opinion if anyone wants to go deep divinginto any ancient Sastra it is importantto gain proficiency in Sanskrit. Translations may be there but they do not go deep. The Translator may also have his biases. Better read the original and understand it. There are many manuscripts without any translation. The researcher will miss all of them without Sanskrit proficiency.
