Namaste

  

In aHomayou may notice the frequency pitch of the Mantras will increase sharply for the Poornahuti. The ending Mantra for Poornahuti will have very high frequency. It feels like the priests are almost screaming in high pitch. Was this a rule in the ancient Yaagas or recent? What is the reason for increasing frequency so much?
