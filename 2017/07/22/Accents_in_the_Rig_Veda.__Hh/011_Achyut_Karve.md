Dear Scholars,

  

This is an extract from my book 'Unveiling the Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology'

  

"The larynx plays an important role while intonating

vowels, as it helps in modulating the tone and pitch of

a vowel. The larynx moves sympathetically during

phonation of letters. However, during the process of

intonation, it has a key role to play, as it modulates

the pitch of the vowel sound. While intonating a

vowel downwards the larynx moves downwards and

while intonating a vowel upwards the larynx moves

upwards. Apart from the above, the vocal folds in the

larynx help in creating turbulence in the air, when it

passes over the vocal folds, thus producing sound."

  

Thus it is the larynx that is instrumental in intonating a vowel. The larynx helps in lengthening of shortening the length of the resonator thus raising or lowering the pitch of the vowel.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
