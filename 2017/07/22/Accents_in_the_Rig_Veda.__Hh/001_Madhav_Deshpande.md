Generally, the marking of accents in the manuscripts of the Rigveda is the same in manuscripts, except, as reported by Witzel, the Kashmiri manuscripts mark the Udātta, while other manuscripts mark the Svarita and Anudātta. Staal reports that the recitation of the Kramapāṭha of the Rigveda in Kerala shows a distinct pronunciation of the Udātta. The actual oral rendition of the accents of the Rigveda is slightly different in different regions of India. Studies of the oral tradition by Wayne Howard's study of Veda recitation in Varanasi and Frits Staal's study of the Nambudiri Veda recitation and others may be useful in providing information regarding local variation in recitation of different Vedas, including the Rigveda. The Keral pronunciation "धियो यो न: प्रचोदयाळ्" is one well known instance of regional variation.
