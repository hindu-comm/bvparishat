Hare Krishna,  
  
Respected Vidvajjanas,  
I wanted scanned copy of manuscript of Bharadvaja Samhita (the one  
with four chapters and which is known as a part of Narada Pancaratra).  
In the catalog of Vaisnava Literatures in Adyar Library I found it  
mentioned with information --  
0884 Bharadvaja Samhita, PM;59,16; SKT, GR  
  
I don't know how to get it from there and if possible in soft copy  
(scanned copy). If someone can help me out on this.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
