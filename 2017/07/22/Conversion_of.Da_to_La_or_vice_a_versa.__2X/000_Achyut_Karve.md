Dear Scholars,

The ड़ and ळ other than being two discreet and distinct sounds differ in articulation. While phonating ळ the tongue does not touch any of the parts of the oral cavity whereas the ड़ while being while being voiced does touch the palate. The second point of difference is that ळ is voiced as a retroflex letter whereas ड़ is not. Thus of the two we need to decide which of the two is a contamination.

If there are any references in this regard kindly tell me.

I am presently reading Madhav Deshpande's article on Rig Vedic retroflexion.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
