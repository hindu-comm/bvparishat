Namaste,

In modern languages we can hardly see the phenomenon of ड़ resembling with ळ.

On the other hand this resemblence can be seen between ड़ and र

In बंगाली-

বাড়ী (home) = बाड़ी = बारी (bārī). In मराठी -> वाडी (a group of settlements) (wādī)

  

  

পড় (to read) = पोड़ = पर (para). In हिंदी -> पढ़ना (to read). In Sanskrit -> पठ्

  

দড়ী (rope) = दोड़ी = दोरी (dorī). In मराठी -> दोरी (rope)

  

  

Herein we can see no connection with ळ in the words.

  

Whereas in

केळ -> केला, (banana)

मिळणे -> मिलना (to meet)

we can see direct conversion of ळ to ल.

Regards,

  

Gandhar,

Dombivali.
