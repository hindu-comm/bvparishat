According to Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas, both ड and ळ are mūrdhanya or retroflex sounds. While ड is described as a stop (sparśa), ळ is described by some texts with the term duḥspr̥ṣṭa. In modern phonetic terminology, this may be described as a flap sound, in contrast with a stop sound. They both involve touching the top of the oral cavity with the reversed tip of the tongue, but the nature of touch is different.
For ड it is a firm touch (sparśa) while for ळ it is a flap. The R̥gveda-Prātiśākhya ascribes the change of intervocalic ड to ळ to an authority named as Vedamitra, and not to Śākalya, and yet the Śākalya Saṃhitā of the RV seems to have followed this view of Vedamitra. The views ascribed to Śākalya by Pāṇini are not fully followed in the Śākalya Saṃhitā as it has come down to us, indicating that the reciters of the Śākalya tradition, over time, adopted practices from other teachers.
