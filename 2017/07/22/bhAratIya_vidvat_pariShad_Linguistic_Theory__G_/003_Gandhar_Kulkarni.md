Namaste,

To get the question linked with Sanskrit I will like to divert you to Vākyapadīya and Paspaśāhnika. Wherein for sphoța (getting acknowledged/receiving the receivable meaning) vaikharī vāņī (language uttered by mouth) is not the most essential aspect of language. The discussion between ākŕti-nityānityatva shall provide you a wide preview on the answer to the question.

Regards,

Gandhar.
