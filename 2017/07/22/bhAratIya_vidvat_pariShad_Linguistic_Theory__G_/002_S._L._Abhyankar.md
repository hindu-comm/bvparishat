I am presently in Morocco and the languages people speak are Arabic or French.

  

English, as we know, is the language of International communication, at least, of business communication. People here do understand my English but were very happy when I used couple of Urdu words such as मुष्किल and तकरीबन. Those words are common to Arabic also.

  

What I am finding that you do not have to be anxious to speak entire sentence. For example, yesterday I wanted an envelope. So I made two or three separate phrases, always supplementing with action. So I said, "I" took a stop, while pointing to myself. Said "want" (For this I had copied down both Arabic and French words from Google translate) Then said "envelope" (For this alsoI had copied down both Arabic and French words from Google translate) Hurray ! I got an envelope !

  

Finally language is means of communication. You have to make yourself understood by the listener. This may not work in "Mass communication". So, it seems that communication "one-to-one" and "Mass communication" are different.
