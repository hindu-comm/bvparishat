Members did not respond to this post probably because the article in the link does not talk about Sanskrit or Indic studies, the focus of the forum.

  

But the question in the title of the article "Is the study of language a science?" is answered in the affirmative through practice though not through argument. Study of language in Various vaidika shaastras has all the rigour of a science.

  

That said, there have been many threads on BVP on the shaastreeya study of language in Vaidika Shaastras.

  

Comparison between Chomsky, his Universal Grammar, Linguistic Theory, his theory of grammar writing etc. and Paniniyan tradition was once a big interest among scholars.

  

It has its continued relevance even today.
