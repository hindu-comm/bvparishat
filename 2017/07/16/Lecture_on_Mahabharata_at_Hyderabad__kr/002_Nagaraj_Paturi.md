Dear Sri Harshavardhan-ji,

  

Thanks for responding.

  

The words used in the flyer are those of the Indic Academy organisers.

  

I circulated the announcement among BVP members on their request.

  

Yes, in any case, it is true that the "studied" cultures , all over the world are asserting on how the studying scholars should or should not
represent them.

  

Regards,
