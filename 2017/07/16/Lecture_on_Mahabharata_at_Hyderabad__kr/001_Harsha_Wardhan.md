Dear Nagaraj ji,

  

Thank you for the info.

  

The below quote is interesting:

  

".............Prof. Adluri mapped the Western reception of the Mahābhārata, showing how a pseudoscience called “Indology” was created to replace Indian notions of time, history, and personhood with concepts borrowed from Christianity.............."  
  
I did not know that the entire field of western indology was suspect.

  

It is good that India is finally reasserting itself and wresting back its narrative.

  
with regards

Harsha
