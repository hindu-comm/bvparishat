If I know it right, India has two National anthems - जनगणमन-अधिनायक and वन्दे मातरम् first one in Hindi and second one in Sanskrit !

  

Is दीप्ति-श्री-महोदया planning to make Sanskrit-translation of जनगणमन-अधिनायक ?

  

Actually, grammatically, analysis the word जनगणमन-अधिनायक is a compound word ! But by rule of Sanskrit grammar संहिता समासे नित्या it should have been जनगणमनाधिनायक. It seems रवीन्द्रनाथ टागोर knew all that well, but took the departure from Sanskrit rule, since that way it does not rhyme well and hence made it a Hindi poem. It is also well-known that he did not compose it as National Anthem for India. It was a poem to welcome the British Emperor ! Only independent India adopted it as the National anthem.

  

Interestingly two neighboringcountries have adopted two poems by the same poet as their National anthems -जनगणमन by India and अमार सोनार बाङ्ग्ला by Bangladesh !
