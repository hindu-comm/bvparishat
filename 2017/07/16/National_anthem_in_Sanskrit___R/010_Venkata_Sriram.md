Dear Madam,

  

Instead of tampering with national anthem, you can take up the famous "samgacchadvaM..." prayer from veda. Pandit Damodar Satwalekar Ji used to emphasise his students to chant these in schools. 

  

Here is the link:

Also, you can teach the students to sing in chorus the famous song that was sung by MS Subbulakshmi. The inspiration behind this song was Kanchi Paramacharya.

  

The lyrics are here:

Both the above songs and tunes are very inspiring for students.
