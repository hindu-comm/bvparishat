There was a lengthy case in Supreme Court With IndianUnion with Shri Warrier who spoke in Sanskrit while presenting his case .His claim was the current national anthem was composed to please the Raj and not fully covering the ethos of our culture

After a lot deliberation court ruled against the writ and dismissed plea

This happened a 25 or 30 year back I am writing this from my memory

Please excuse me if I am wrong
