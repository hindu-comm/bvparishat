Deepti Ji,  

 You should call your song by some other name. You can call it your school anthem or a Desh-Bhakti-Song etc.  
  

Calling a song the national anthem can land you in legal trouble. Not only is the national song fixed and unchangeable, even the method of singing it is fixed. The national anthem can be sung either in full version or in short version. The full version should take 52 seconds and the short version 20 seconds. The occasions when the full version is to be sung and when the short version is to be sung are already fixed and cannot be violated.  
  

Therefore, tampering with the national anthem and calling some other song as the national anthem can create trouble.  

  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai
