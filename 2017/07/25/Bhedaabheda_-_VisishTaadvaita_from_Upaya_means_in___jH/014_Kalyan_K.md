//I am also trying to get more material on Vijnanabhikshu, the modern integrator of bhedabheda, samkhya and yoga, whose ideas I find to be refreshingly appealing.//  
  
If you find anything, please share the links here. Thanks.  
  
//I remember reading your thread on the central assumptions of advaita vedanta some time back on BVP. May I ask what your opinion of Bhadabheda is, from that perspective?//  
  
It is too early for me to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of bhedAbheda. My study has just begun. Lack of material is proving to be a hindrance. In fact, I have taken up bhedAbheda only because I found fundamental inconsistencies in traditional advaita.
