Respected Madam,

  

Thank you for giving a direction re Vijnanabhiksu. As I am not an academician, I do not have any institutional login/subscription for these journals, and it seems digital copies are behind paywalls, but I will try to get these papers.

  

I have studied your translation of Vijnanabhiksu on the Yoga Sutras. And I have also studied Vijnanabhiksu's commentary on Samkhya Sutras translated by Sri Nandalal Sinha. In the introductory verses, Vijnanabhiksu gives a good summary of his views on the interface of Vedanta and Samkhya+Yoga.

  

But I think his total views can only be understood after his commentary on the Brahma Sutras are annotatively studied by a scholar such as yourself. To the best of my knowledge, they are as yet unpublished, and this constitutes a hurdle for translation-dependent people like me.

  

As you are an authority in this matter, I would request you to kindly consider, if time permits, giving us a precis of his views as mentioned in Vijnanamritabhashya.  

  

with pranams

Harsha
