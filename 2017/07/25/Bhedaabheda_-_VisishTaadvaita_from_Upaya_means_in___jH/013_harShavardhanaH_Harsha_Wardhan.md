Sri Kalyan garu,

  

The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy had this to say in this matter -

  

"Although in the modern period Bhedābheda Vedānta has been eclipsed in popularity by neo-Vedāntic interpretations of Advaita Vedānta philosophy, its lineage continues today among traditional scholars in Puṣṭimārga**and GaudīyaVaiṣṇava**religious communities."

  

My personal view is that Bhedabheda is very much alive- albeit in a morphed form- as the basis of dvaita systems, which owing to their emphasis on Bhakti, appeal to most people.
