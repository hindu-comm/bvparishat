Dear Sri Harsh Wardhan  
  
Are there any followers of bhedAbheda (as propounded by Sri Bhaskara) today? Or has the school lost all followers?  
  
One difference that I can see is that vishishTha-advaita considers jIva as sharIra of brahman while I did not come across such a description in bhedAbheda. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong here. Also, in my understanding, bhedAbheda pre-dates advaita whereas vishishTha-advaita came after advaita.  
  
Sri Nagaraj, can we really consider Sri Bhaskara's bhedAbheda as an example of a bhakti school?  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
