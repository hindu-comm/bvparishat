Sri Kalyan garu,

  

A paper by Dr TS Rukmani that touches upon Vijnanabhikshu's approach to the concept of (Yogic) Isvara is here:<http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1511&context=jhcs>.

  

This is important as the concept of Isvara is where Samkhya is attacked - it is said to be atheistic as it has no concept of personal isvara. In Yoga, isvara is said to be special purusa, and not equated with the Brahma of Vedanta. Advaita considers Yoga's ontology to be deficient when it comes to the concept of Isvara.

  

In Saiva Siddhanta, Isvara is equated to SIva and is considered equal to Brahma of Vedanta with the added characteristic that this isvara gives "grace" to the sadhaka or upasaka - a concept that finds its parallells in the Shaktipat of Kashmir Saivism and also in certain western christian traditions (but in a very feeble form)
