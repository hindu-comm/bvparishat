Namaste

  

There was some discussions on Advaita List sometime back in June. There is lot of common ideas in Bhedabheda and Visistadvaita. The teacher of Sri Ramanuja was Sri Yadava Prakasha. He was Bhedabheda Vaadi but when he was explaining 'Kapyasam' word from Upanishads Sri Ramanuja became sad because he was comparing God's eyes to Monkey's behind. But many Sri Vaishnavas think he was Advaiti. It is not correct. Kindly see this link for Bhedabheda information -
