Thank you Sri Nagaraj garu

  

I am aware of the plagiarism controversy with Rajiv Malhotra

  

Here's a paper by the same Andrew Nicholson containing a discussion relevant to our thread:<http://www.academia.edu/2399512/Reconciling_dualism_and_non-dualism_three_arguments_in_Vij%C3%B1%C4%81nabhik%E1%B9%A3u_s_Bhed%C4%81bheda_Ved%C4%81nta>

  

He has given some untranslated arguments of Vijnanabhikshu as mentioned in his Vijnanamritabhashya, a commentary on the Vedanta sutras

  

with regards

Harsha
