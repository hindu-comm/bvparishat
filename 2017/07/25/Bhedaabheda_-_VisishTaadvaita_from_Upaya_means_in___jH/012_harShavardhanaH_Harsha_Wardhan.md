Sri Kalyan garu,

  

Thank you for the book.

  

Yes, less literature is available in regard to Bhedabheda, which is an important tradition in vedantic thought.

  

I am also trying to get more material on Vijnanabhikshu, the modern integrator of bhedabheda, samkhya and yoga, whose ideas I find to be refreshingly appealing.

.

I remember reading your thread on the central assumptions of advaita vedanta some time back on BVP. May I ask what your opinion of Bhadabheda is, from that perspective?

  

with regards

Harsha
