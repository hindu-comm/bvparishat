Respected scholars,

  

All extant Indian philosophical systems are soteriological, Vedanta (advaita, dvaita and other sub-systems) included.  

  

But I could not find much Vedantic literature focusing on the upayas (the practical means) to attaining liberation (moksha) within those systems.

  

Please note I am not saying that there are no vedantic upayas - I am saying there is not much focus or discussions that I could, in my limited reading, find on the matter.

  

It is entirely possible I did not know of works dealing with Vedantic upayas, so I am asking for recommendation and guidance here in this matter.  

  

I would appreciate any guidance you could provide.

  

with pranam,

Harsha
