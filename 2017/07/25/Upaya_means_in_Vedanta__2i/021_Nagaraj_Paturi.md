Even I am surprised at this out of the blue reference to a common place statement from /attributed to Karl Marx.

  

The following statement too room Sri Achyut-ji seems to have no context in the thread:

  

\>Many scholars would object or not conform to the view that western thought right from the days of greek philosophy is totally material i.e they opine that truth lies outside ourselves.

  

-- Sir, who in the thread saidthat western thought right from the days of greek philosophy is totally material?

  

Please kindly stick to the topic. Please post only if you have anything to contribute the discussion.
