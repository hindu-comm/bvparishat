In almost every Vedantic tradition there are books dealing with the details of the actual practice towards what constitutes Moksha for the tradition. In fact, there are multiple such detailed paths discussed in different books of the same tradition.

  

For example, VivekachooDaamaNi of Advaita is a conversation between Guru and S'ishya. Guru almost walks the S'ishya through the track.

  

Any such track needs a constant Abhyaasa for the track to provide sustained results.

  

DakshiNaamoorti Stotra is such Abhyaasa tool for the sarvaatmatva upaaya provided in Vivekachoodaamani.
