Prof.V.Krishnamurthy, Retd. Professor of Mathematics @ BITS, Pilani has translated the Paramacharya's discourses into English bearing the title 'Advaita Sadhana'. Prof.VK is very close to us especially in advaita circles and gives occasional discourses in 'advaita academy' along with our revered member Dr.K.Aravinda Rao Ji.

That said, strictly speaking from traditional view point, the upAya is 'nitya-karma' (svadharma) as per one's varNAshrama which paves the way for chitta-shuddhi; then followed by vichAra of vedanta vAkyAs. The vAkya 'athAto brahmajignAsa' assumes that the mumukshu is endowed with viveka, vairAgya, shama, dama etc.
