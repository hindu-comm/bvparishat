Phalas'riti of DakshiNaamoorti stotra :

  

सर्वात्मत्वमितिस्फुटीकृतमिदंयस्मादमुष्मिन्स्तवे  
तेनास्यश्रवणात्तदर्थमननाद्ध्यानाच्चसंकीर्तनात्।  
सर्वात्मत्वमहाविभूतिसहितंस्यादीश्वरत्वंस्वतः  
सिद्ध्येत्तत्पुनरष्टधापरिणतंचैश्वर्यमव्याहतम्॥१०॥  

  

My verse-translation of this:

  

The present praising poem titled as

The Truth of Everything as Self alone

by hearing next reflecting on thesense,

and being quite absorbed in final sense,

and singing loudly feeling all the sense,

along with great enormous power of

attainingstate of self as everything

the level of controller of the world

controling power taking eight-fold form

results thereafter on its own for sure
