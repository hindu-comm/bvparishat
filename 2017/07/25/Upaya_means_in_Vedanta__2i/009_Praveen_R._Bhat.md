Further to others' responses, jnAna itself, post svakarmAnuShThAna, takes place through shravaNa, manana and nididhyAsana. shravaNa includes shAstratAtparyavichAra, so that itself can accomplish the other two stages for a rare uttamottamAdhikArin, but for almost all cases, the other two stages are needed. manana is made up of saMshayanivRtti w.r.t. to ascertained shrutitAtparya, followed by nididhyAsana which is staying with the final vision after resolution of all doubts. This itself can be in two ways: initially, confined to sitting in a secluded place, etc, following the antaranga steps of Yoga but the object of meditation is the mahAvAkya and/ or staying with the concluded vision in all situations, bringing the mind back when it drifts off.

  

For those whom shravaNa and manana themselves are difficult to achieve, nirguNopAsanA is prescribed, as established by Panchadashikara in chapter 9.
