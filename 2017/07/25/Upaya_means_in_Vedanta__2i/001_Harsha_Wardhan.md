I want to add to my post to avoid doubts-

  

Take Advaita for example, as explained by Adi Samkaracharya. In the Upadesasahasri, he provides an overview of the entire system. In Samkara advaita, it is only knowledge (jnana) that is required to remove ignorance (avidya) and not any special works (karma). So the entire upaya is removal of mental error of multiplicity by the jiva.

  

Advaita as explained by samkara is a special case, as the entire scheme is built upon the recognition and removal of error. It is knowledge that is the upaya.

  

In the dvaita systems, the upaya is bhakti (devotion), to the best of my knowledge.

  

My query pertains to a deeper discussion of the practical aspects of vedantic upayas.
