As a general note, let us note the following:

  

1\. Most of the literature on Vedanta including original prasthAnatraya itself is as much a discussion on upAya as it is on upEya. Bhaashyas by each school of Vedanta too, as much interpret the upAya in the prasthAnatraya as they analyse the discussion of upEya in the prasthAnatraya.

  

2\. Books like Yoga Sutras are books on upAya only.

  

3\. Most of the Vedanta literature is in the form of actual texts to be used as part of the upAya only. For example stotra literature etc. is all never a discussion of upAya, all the texts are tools to be used as part of upAya only.

  

4\. Very small portion of actual literature of any Vedanta is a discussion or debate about a specific school's theory about the upEya. All the remaining literature is actually either a guidance towards upAya or actual textual tools to be used as part of upAya.

  

5\. People use words like sAdhaka, sAdhana and siddhi only because they are talking of actual implementation of upAya. Those who are intested only reading /listening about the upEya do not use such words.

  

6\. For schools like Dvaita, Bhakti is both upAya and upEya. Bhakti leads to better Bhakti that leads to still better Bhakti and so on finally leading to mOksha which is nothing but uttamottamabhakti or paramOttamabhakti.
