Many scholars would object or not conform to the view that western thought right from the days of greek philosophy is totally material i.e they opine that truth lies outside ourselves. Sanskrit language has the ability to internalise 'that truth' and project it as an experience.
This internalisation of the external reality through language not only reveals the external material reality to an individual but also allows one to realise and see for himself that internal reality which sages have described in the Vedas and the Upanishads.

Thus if one is seeking an upaya outside himself it would be better if one turns to western philosophy. As far as the Indian tradition goes the upaya is in the upeya itself.  

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
