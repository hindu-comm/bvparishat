Many members rightly pointed out that upAya is in a big proportion in the Vedic literature.

  

An interesting observation is that it is because of this inseparable intertwining between upAya and upEya in Vedic literature that the western academicians were not able to accept the status of philosophy to different discussions and the texts containing them, of the Vedic literature. upAya discussion for them was 'religious instruction' for them.

  

Today some mistakenly think that Vedanta literature is pure 'philosophy' without guidance for actual practice.
