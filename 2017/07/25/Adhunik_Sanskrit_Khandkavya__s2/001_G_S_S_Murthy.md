Dear Nagpalji,

While I do not have such a list I can only say that a Khanda Kavya "Chandrikaa" is included in a book of collection of Sanskrit Poems, also titled "Chandrikaa", recently brought out by Devavani Parishad, R-6 Vanivihar, Uttam Nagar, Mangal bazar Road, New Delhi 110059.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
