Respected scholars,

  

I am looking for the early volumes (and specifically Vols I and II) of the journal *Yoga Mimamsa* edited by Swami Kuvalayananda of Lonavala.

  

On [archive.org](http://archive.org), I could get Vols III and IV of the*Yoga Mimamsa*, but Vols I and II are not available.

  

DLI download facility is still down, but I remember drawing a blank when I searched for these volumes earlier, before it was taken down for maintenance.

  

If any member(s) have them in PDF form, I would appreciate if they may consider sharing them with me.

  

with pranam,

Harsha
