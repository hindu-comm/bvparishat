Respected scholars,

Dr Vasant G Rele was a medical doctor who had rather interesting ideas on ancient texts.

He interpreted the inverted tree concept of the Bhagavad Gita as a literal imaging of the universe as a human body.

More importantly, he authored a treatise on the Rg Veda, in which he put forth the notion that the Rg Veda is to be interpreted as verses about and on the human body literally. That is, he favoured a literally biological interoretation.

I'm not sure how his ideas are accepted by the larger academic community, but I find his ideas worth pursuing. From a yogic viewpoint (which I respect) existence, reality and liberation all are rooted in biology, so I'm favourable to his interpretations.

I'd appreciate any thoughts the respected members might care to share on the matter.

With regards  
Harsha
