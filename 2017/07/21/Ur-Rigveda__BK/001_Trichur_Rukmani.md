Surely there is no Ur-RV which can be recovered in an oral tradition of thousands of years. Can it be even stated that only the RV which has come down to us is the only one which existed in that hoary past. It is well known that a number of the śākhās of the Vedas are not even available; so is it even worthwhile to talk abut an UR-RV? Also why do we need to follow the western tradition of textual recovery when most of our ancient wisdom heritage has been handed down orally.
