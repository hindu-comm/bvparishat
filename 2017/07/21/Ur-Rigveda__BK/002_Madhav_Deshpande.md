Full texts of the Śāmkhāyana and Āśvalāyana Śākhās of the R̥gveda have been published in recent times. They differ from the Śākalya's Saṃhitā only in some details. Ur-R̥gveda is a theoretical concept that would ideally reconstruct an ancestral version of the R̥gveda of which the available Śākhās are different variations. The need to produce such an Ur-R̥gveda as been discussed by a few scholars (R. G. Bhandarkar among them), but no comprehensive effort on the lines of the Mahābhārata (BORI) has ever been undertaken. Hermann Oldenberg's research points to possibilities of various stages in which the RV Saṃhitā came to be put together.
