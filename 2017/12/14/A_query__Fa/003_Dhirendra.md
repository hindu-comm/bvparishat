Dear Sir  

Follow the steps below:  
  

1\) Open the homepage <http://www.jainlibrary.org/index.php> and Sign in  
  

2\) Then type or paste "Syadwad Ratnakar" (without the quototation marks) in the search box and click the button "Search All Except Author & Publisher"  
  

3\) You would get the list as shown in the attached screenshot. Click in the box "Std File Download" for each search result to download it.  
  

Sir take care of the spellings for the search, let me know if you face any difficulty, in that case I can send these files to your personal email address.  
  

Regards  

Dhirendra Kumar
