hariH OM,

  

 First of all, profuse thanks to shrii hariparshad for uploading another valuable book.

  

1\. All the books of sv. akhaNDAnanda are online on [maharajshri.net](http://maharajshri.net) and I don't find any commentary on bhaktirasAyana there. I will be grateful to know if he has indeed written a commentary on the work.

2\. svAmii akhaNDAnanda has written an exhaustive introduction to bhAgavatam in his two volume book and in that he has a sub heading titled "हरिसूरिकी उत्प्रेक्षाएँ" and here he deals with a few of harisUri's verses (भागवतदर्शन, सत्यसाहित्य प्रकाशन ट्रस्ट, मुंबई, pages ७६-८४).

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
