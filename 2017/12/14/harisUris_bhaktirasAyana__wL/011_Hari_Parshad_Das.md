my pranams to all vidvaj-janas.

  

After trying hard to look for a copy of the edition of Bhakti-rasayanam published by Swami Shri Akhandanand Saraswati, I could not easily locate it anywhere in India.

  

However, a kind friend of mine got it scanned from a university in the west. I have uploaded this edition for all vidvans interested in this grantha.

  

**Download Link**:<https://archive.org/details/bhakti_rasayanam>

  

However, this edition too does not have any commentary to understand the verses. Just some small footnotes by the editor.

  

So in total, we have three available online editions of the Bhakti-rasayanam till now:

  

**1)** The one I just uploaded (link above).

  

**2)** The one found in the multiple commentaries on 10th skandha : (<https://archive.org/details/SrimadBhagavatamCanto10withMultipleSanskritCommentaries> )

  

**3)** Small notes named 'Prapā' on Bhakti-rasayanam by Madhava Shastri Datara : (<https://archive.org/details/bhaktirasayana_prapa> )

  

Besides this, there currently seems to be no other edition which has anything extra.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,
