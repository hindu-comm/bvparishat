When you say, 'Atman itself is Brahman', you are probably using the word Atman in the sense of parama aatman. All your statements such as 'There as many jeevas as there are individuals but there is only one Atman (Brahman) among the different jeevas.' can get more clearly articulated , if you substitute parama aatman for Atman. The word jeeva is being used in the sense of jeeva aatman only.

  

That jeeva aatman and parama aatman are different from each other, to begin with, is obvious from the very necessity of the use of two different words for the two different concepts.

  

But Advaitins believe that jeeva aaatman is the present perception of the (parama) aatman about itself as an individual self, though in the ultimate (parama) analysis, the fact that attribute of individuality to it was necessitated only by vyavahaara in which it is partaking and in theultimate (parama) (paaramaarthika) analysis, it is the(parama) aatman itself without the limitations of individuality.
