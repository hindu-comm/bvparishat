Dear Sri Damaru Bhatta-ji,

  

If you heard from an Advaitin that

  

1. सर्वम् खल्विदं ब्रह्म,  
2. ब्रह्म सत्यम् जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापर: ।।

  

mean the same

  

or that "ब्रह्म सत्यम् जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापर:"

  

is contained in

  

"सर्वम् खल्विदं ब्रह्म",  

  

and you want to verify whether he is right in saying so,

  

the answer is

  

he is right from his perspective.

  

If you want to know how he is able to derive

  

"ब्रह्म सत्यम् जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापर:"  

  

from

  

"सर्वम् खल्विदं ब्रह्म",  

  

then it is as follows:

  

Since S'riti says,

  

All this is Brahman, ("सर्वम् खल्विदं ब्रह्म",)

  

Jagat is Brahman. That is brahmatva of jagat is true. Jagattva of brahman is only apparent.ब्रह्म सत्यम् जगन्मिथ्या meansbrahmatva of jagat is true; jagattva of brahman is only apparent.

  

When 'all this' in 'All this is Brahman' is taken to mean 'individual self' or the observing self which is called jeeva in Vedanta, then it leads to the statement:जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापर:.

  

That is how an Advaitinderives

  

"ब्रह्म सत्यम् जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापर:"  

  

from

  

"सर्वम् खल्विदं ब्रह्म".
