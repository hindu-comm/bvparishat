As independent statements they are having two separate meanings. Even the second statement in itself is comprised of multiple short standalone combination words.  
ब्रह्म सत्यम् । Brahman is Reality  
जगन्मिथ्या । Jagat is an appearance  
जीवो ब्रह्मैव । Jeeva is Brahman alone.  
नापर:। therefore not separate.  
One should understand the implied meaning of this multiple words by adding the word एव to each like  
ब्रह्म सत्यं एव।  
जगत् मित्य एव  
जीवः ब्रह्म एव,न अपरः।  
Here we can see that Brahman is the only Reality and hence there cannot be a Jagat independent of Reality. Therefore Jagat is also in the same Reality which is otherwise called Brahman. But the Jagat has just the opposite nature of Brahman, like impermanence etc. Reality cannot be impermanent. So then why is the Jagat with it's impermanence told is Brahman only? Impermanence is always in reference to a permanent. The changing nature of Jagat is experienced on a permanent substratum (स्वरूपम्) hence it is called the appearance and the substratum on which it appears is the Reality. Without the substratum the appearance cannot happen. So what is the reality of the impermanent appearance? It's substratum, the Reality. (The snake cannot appear without the rope)  
As appearance Jagat is मिथ्या, but as it's substratum Brahman is the reality. So Jagat is in reality Brahman alone, but not as the appearance but the स्वरूपं, reality. In all the three times, before, now and later the rope alone is the truth. But the experience of the snake even though felt as real was never a truth. Hence the reality of Jagat is Brahman in all the three periods of time. Never it was not Brahman. Jeeva is part of Jagat hence that too is not different from the one reality Brahman.  
Therefore, सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म। When Jeeva, part of Jagat is in reality the Brahman, is there anything that is not? Hence सर्वं is Brahman alone. बृहत्वत् ब्रह्म it encompasses everything. नेहनानाऽस्ति किंचन।
