Dear Sir,

  

With reference to the previous discussion, I would like to add that jeeva (the individual self) is different form the Atman. The Atman itself is Brahman. There as many jeevas as there are individuals but there is only one Atman (Brahman) among the different jeevas. Kindly, give me your feedback. Thanks.

  

With regards,

Damaru Chandra Bhatta
