Dear Sir,

  

I think that the individual self is jeeva (doer, subject, ahankar,
chidavasa \[the appearance of the Atman in the mind\]) but the observing self is the witness (Brahman). The jeeva thinks he knows (pramata), he does (karta) and he experiences (bhokta). But the observing self (the witness, Brahman) does not do anything. Do you think there is any difference between the observing self and the witness? Kindly, share your opinions. Thanks.

  

With warm and best regards,

Damaru Chandra Bhatta
