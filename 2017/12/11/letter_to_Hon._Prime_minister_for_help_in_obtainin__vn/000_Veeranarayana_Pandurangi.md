Dear all,

on the occassion of recently concluded Internationalworkshop'New Research Frontiers' organized by Karnataka Samskrita University at Aksharam, Bangalore on 20-22, 11.2017, on the presentation by prof. Jaddipal there was hue and cry about difficulty in obtaining manuscript copies from libaries both in India and abroad.

  

We have put a small step towards this. One letter was drafted and signed by all participants there adressing prime minister to interven. I have attached the copy of signed letter for your perusal so yo too can join there. You can write this letter I independently too.
