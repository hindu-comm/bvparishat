Respected members,

  

I have uploaded my submission to the WSC 2017 on some phonological aspects of Tamil TaittirÄ«yaka recitation, specifically consonant duplication, at [academia.edu](http://academia.edu). The link is

  

<https://www.academia.edu/35369564/Modeling_the_Phonology_of_Consonant_Duplication_and_Allied_Changes_in_the_Recitation_of_Tamil_Taittir%C4%AByaka-s>  

  

I don't know if the paper is good enough for serious publication, but I would love to get any feedback from the scholars on this list.

  

Thank you!

  

Ramakrishnan
