Hi

'

 Wonderful mail, Srini. My surname is maṭhādhikāri (मठाधिकारि) but I could not spell it properly in english and had to change the "ṭh" to "t".

  

 We should either use the IAST form or extend uppercase letters for additional letters as in[Harvard-Kyoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_transliteration#Transliteration_Comparison)for writing Indian languages in english script.

  

Regards,

Harsha
