Namaste Srinivasa Kumar Acharya



1. Thanks for pointing the sensitivity of spelling used in the names
from the aspect of \< concerns towards PSRPublic Social Responsibility,regarding the usage of word 'Mutt' and its meaning implications, mostly unaware of \> .



The term ‘मठ ‘ existed in Samskruth with meaning specificity, before the roman transliteration conventions and translation errors started .




2. I do not know whether you intentionally avoided the English dictionary listed meanings for this term ‘Mutt’ :



(plural mutts) A mongrel dog; **a dog of mixed breed or uncertain origin**. (figuratively, sometimes pejorative) **A person of diverse ancestry**. (chiefly US, slang) As **a term of abuse: an idiot, a stupid person**.

A criminal; suspect; mope, perp (1980s+ Police)



Source: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mutt> ; <http://www.dictionary.com/browse/mutt> .



3. Monier Williams dictionary lists the term meaning as follows:



मठ \[Cologne record ID=13540\] \[Printed book page 213-2\] मठ¦maṭha, m., ī, f. hut; solitary hut of an ascetic or student, cell; monastic school, college: -cintā, f. care of a monastery: -ṃ sam- -ā-car, rule a monastery

4. It would be an interesting point to explore what should be the translational mapping of ‘Ramakrishna matha’ . What will rightfully describe and explain the nature and relation of these institutions with Samskruth tradition and terminology ? What would be the right descriptor to go with the name of Sri Ramakrishna order : - '
monastery , seminary, society, samaj ashrama, church, or mission' is an interesting point to explore. 



The official terminology noticed at the url [www.ramakrishna.org](http://www.ramakrishna.org) is \< Headquarters :
Ramakrishna Math & Ramakrishna Mission> ; The Centers outside of India are called 'Ashram', 'Society', 'Center', 'monastery', ' mission -ashrama', 'mission-seva-samiti', ' mission and mission Ashrama', ' Vedanta Ashrama', 'Vedanta Center',>.



Tracing the history of the issue, the genesis of the problem goes back deeper in time. At the url - ( <http://www.ramakrishna.org/rmk_hstry.htm> - page dated 1966) - Swami Adiswarananda, Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York, explains Ramakrishna order in India and West as follows:





***Ramakrishna Order of India***

Upon his return to India, **Swami Vivekananda founded The Ramakrishna Order of India in the name of his teacher, Sri Ramakrishna, who is regarded as the Prophet of Harmony of Religions. The Order is the pre-eminent religious organization of modern India**. More than 1000 monks of the Order serve throughout the world. While in the West the work is mainly in the form of conducting worship, teaching, writing and lecturing, in India the Order is widely known for its vast charitable activities -- running hospitals and schools, rural uplift, and extensive relief work in times of emergency. The Swamis of the Order work tirelessly in the spirit of "Service of God in Man," regarding the service of all people as a veritable form of worship.



***Ramakrishna Order in the West***

**The Centers of the Order in America, often referred to by such names as Ramakrishna or Vivekananda Centers, or Vedanta Societies, were first organized by Swami Vivekananda for the propagation of the Swami's teachings**. Today there are Centers in many of America's major cities, including New York, Boston, Providence, Chicago, St. Louis, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Berkeley, Sacramento, and Hollywood. Because of their belief in the underlying truth of all religions, the **Centers of the Ramakrishna Order are at the forefront of the Interfaith Movement**.





I hope this thread does address the issue of PSRPublic Social Responsibility in Samskruth terms usage and translation.
