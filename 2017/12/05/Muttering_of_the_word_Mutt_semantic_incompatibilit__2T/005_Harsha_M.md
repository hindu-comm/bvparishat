Dear Srini,

  

Thanks for this email.

  

  

\>\>Maṭha stands for traditional educational institution as well and in many cases for pilgrims’ hospitality (lodging, feeding, etc.)

  

In addition to this, I think it would also stand for "School of Thought". Small variations in the proposed philosophy of a higher monk and the teaching methodology is the main reason for establishment of new branches of**Maṭhas.** Otherwise the same name could have been reused by all. More the*maṭhas,* more actively the philosophy is being discussed and reinvented.

  

Regards,

Harsha
