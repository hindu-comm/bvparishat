Interesting post, Sir.

  

I have two observations. The rUDhyartha always prevails over yaugikArtha. Example pankajam is a lotus, not a weed or something. And, none the less beautiful for its muddy etymology.

  

Second, a brahmajnaani is indistinguishable from a madman, it is said. So if a matham is seen as a place having people whom the general public think are mad, it might still be tenable. At least, this could help in our speculation about how the word came to be used, as it is being used now.

  

In view of the above, it seems that present usage has good basis.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
