namāṃsi,  

  

The two important social, cultural, religious, spiritual and philosophical institutions of Vedism or Hinduism are Maṭha and Mandira. Maṭha (monastery) and Mandira (temple) serve any of the above-mentioned purposes and play an important role as a place of worship for the Vaidika or Hindu societies. Mandira stands for religious importance whereas Maṭha stands for traditional educational institution as well and in many cases for pilgrims’ hospitality (lodging, feeding, etc.) Both of them, monastery and temple, ‘may’ house a fixed (acala) or mobile (cala) idols (pratimā) for the worships and prayers of the community for meditation purposes.  

The common usage of the word ‘Mutt’ for **Maṭha** (with diacritical underdot mark below, which annotates phonetical importance of cerebral char ‘**ṭ**’) or even **Matha** (without diacritics) is not a ‘standard lemma’ semantically or lexically that refer to these institutions. Instead, the word ‘Mutt’ mutters meanings - “A dog, especially a mongrel.”, or “A stupid or incompetent person.” as lemmatised in standard lexicon, which derogatorily defame such important institutions making us unaware of the orthography and semantics of Indian languages. The word मठ(transliterated: Maṭha/Matha/Math) is lemmatised by couple of standard lexicon as “anorderofHindumonks - fromtheSanskritword*maṭha*hut”.

Even the Vedic or Hindu institutions themselves (even have been registered officially) and other Indian English writings including publicly read Indian dailies use the ‘Mutt’ tragically. This refers to a recent report published on a renowned newspaper regarding the Karnataka state Govt’s Muzrai Act amendment, sadly. This could be seriously looked into respecting the social and lingual sensitivities.

This is shared with the concerns towards PSRPublic Social Responsibility,regarding the usage of word 'Mutt' and its meaning implications, mostly unaware of.Please do ignore if it disinterests you and any views on this is welcomed.

  

Thank you for your time for going through the mail.
