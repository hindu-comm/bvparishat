This is a predominantly south Indian problem. People in south India tend to use antiquated Colonial Era spellings still. No Hindi speaker will ever write Cawnpore but any amount of Tamils write 'Tanjore' for Thanjavur and 'Madura' for Madurai still. They would even pronounce the latter after the English fashion as 'mejura'. The current sensitivity for the English spelling of 'maṭha' is unfortunately a victim of this antiquated practice.  

  

The word in this spelling is recorded by Yule and Burnell in their dictionary ( Hobson Jobson dictionary) which was first published in 1886.

**MUTT**, MUTH , s. Skt. *maṭha;* a sort of convent where a celibate priest (or one making such profession) lives with disciples making the same profession, one of whom becomes his successor. Buildings of this kind are very common all over India, and some are endowed with large estates.

  

The sense of 'simpleton, blockhead' associated with the word 'mutt' seems to be an Americanism and is dated to 1901. The sense of a 'mixed breed or mongrel' seems to date to 1906. See:

### mutt 

noun

1.  A dog, esp a hybrid; mongrel *(1906+) * 2.  A stupid person; [klutz](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/klutz),
    [muttonhead](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/muttonhead)*: A mutt?
    Yeah, he's that all right. Not too much brains * *(1901+) *

1.  A criminal; suspect; [mope](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/mope),
    [perp](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/perp) *(1980s+ Police) *



The spelling was clearly not pejorative when the Colonialists started using it. But it has been made to sound so over the years by this adherence to Colonial orthography.
