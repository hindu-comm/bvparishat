Dear friends,

  

I have been traveling and missed participation in the Fourm for several months.

Our presentation slides from our research through the period 700BC-200BC

are now posted at our website htttp://[indiadiscoverycenter.org](http://indiadiscoverycenter.org)

We are preparing work on our next seminar for the period 200BC-500AD.

We have scheduled the seminar for April 28, 2018.

  

In our framework we divide the cultural history into six tracks: (i) Geography and People,

\(ii\) Art and Culture, (iii) Language and Literature (iv) Philosophy and Religion

\(v\) Science and Technology and (vi) Economy and Politics. We would appreciate

any objective reference and research material that you might have. We realize that

most of the material has been speculative and arbitrary extrapolations.
Our goal

is to map an Identity of Indian nation through an analysis through our own experiences

and local understanding. I will report further as we make progress.

  

Best regards,

Happy New Year.
