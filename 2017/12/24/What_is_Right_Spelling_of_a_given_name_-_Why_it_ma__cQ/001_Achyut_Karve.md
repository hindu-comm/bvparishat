Dear Sastryji,

  

As yet none from the list have responded to your query. Should I feel free to respond?

  

A simple question is why 'to' is phonated as it is generally phonated and 'go' not phonated as 'to'?

  

To my belief as the English language does not give any rules for writing down spoken words is it not fair to say that english spellings are governed by convention?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
