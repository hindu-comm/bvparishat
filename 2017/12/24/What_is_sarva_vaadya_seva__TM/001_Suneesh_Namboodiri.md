Namaste,  
  
I have seen Sakala -Vadya -Pradakshinams in Kerala temples , in this all temple Vadyas will be participated , as per Kerala tradition Nadaswaram is not used (long sized nadaswaram) in this place short Nadaswaram type of instrument is used.  
  
Chenda ,Elathalam, Timila,paani,maddalam, idakka ,Kuzhal,kombu etc are used - Paani is the most important instrument in temple rituals ...also in chanda .. both right side and left side is used .. right side chenda .. (valam thala ) is deva vadyam left is asura vadyam ....  
  
  
Dhnayavadaha
