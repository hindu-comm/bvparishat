Namaste

  

During grand ceremonies, especially at the end of an elaborate temple puja, there is a 'sarva vaadya sevaa'. On those occasions it is common to see the Nadaswara (piped instrument) goshthi performing for a minute or two. Is this really meant by 'sarva vaadya..'?

  

What is the instrument 'tuurya'?

  

The reply of scholars here is welcome.

  

Thanks
