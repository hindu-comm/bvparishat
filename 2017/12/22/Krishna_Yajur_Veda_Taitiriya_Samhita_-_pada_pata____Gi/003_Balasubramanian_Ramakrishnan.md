The best padapaatha in Sanskrit was published about 120 years back and is available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). The good feature of the book is the extensive footnotes explaining the lakShaNa details, especially samhitaa to padapaatha conversion rules, from the praatishaakhya and the vyaasa shikShaa. Unfortunately, they are scattered over the book, so you cannot find a specific rule easily. That said, the book is great, though not as error free as the grantha texts from kumbhaghoNam, though the authors of both the devanaagarii and the grantha texts are the same. I personally prefer the grantha texts for various other reasons as well.

  

In any case the links are

This was republished as a single volume with a foreword by the great yudhiShThiro miimaamsakaH, by the Ramlal Kapoor Trust. I like the hard copy better, but it’s kind of hard to get.

  

Ghanapaatha has not been published in its entirety. Most vaidikas I meet scoff at written ghana texts. They say people with ghana texts (this is available for some parts like the rudram, chamakam, etc.) invariably recite it wrong and I have found empirically that there is a lot of validity to their views.
