Dear Sri Venkat,  
  

I do not know about online resources, but there are no published English translations of Sāyaṇa's Veda-bhāṣyas as far as I know. Only two of his prefaces or bhūmikās to his Veda-bhāṣyas have been published in English translation: Peter Peterson translated Sāyaṇa's preface to the Ṛgveda-bhāṣya, published in 1890 in volume XLI of the Bombay Sanskrit Series, *Handbook to the Study of the Rigveda*, Part I, and reprinted in 1974 by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute as *Sāyaṇa's Preface to the Ṛgvedabh**āṣya*. Dr. Saraswati Bali translated *Sāyaṇa's Upodgh**āta to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā and the Ṛgveda **Saṃhitā*, published in 1999 by Pratibha Prakashan, Delhi.  
  

Regarding alternate English translations of the Ṛg-veda, there are seven complete English translations that I know of:  
  

1. H. H. Wilson, *Ṛig-veda Sanhitá*, 6 volumes, London: Trübner and Co., 1850-1888.

2. Ralph T. H. Griffith, *The Hymns of the Rigveda*, 4 volumes, Benares: E. J. Lazarus and Co., 1889-1892.

3. Svami Satya Prakash Sarasvati and Satyakam Vidyalankar, *Ṛgveda Samhitā*, 13 volumes in 12 bindings, New Delhi: Veda Pratishthana, 1977-1987.

4. R. L. Kashyap, *Rig Veda Samhita*, 10 volumes in 12 bindings, Bangalore: Sri Aurobindo Kapāli Sāstry Institute of Vedic Culture, 2004-2009.

5. Prasanna Chandra Gautam, *Modern English Translation of The Rig Veda Samhitaa*, 4 volumes, Kathmandu: Kulachandra Gautam Smriti Sansthaan, 2012.

6. Tulsi Ram, *Ṛg Veda*, 4 volumes, Delhi: Arsh Sahitya Prachar Trust, 2013 (not seen by me).

7. Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton, *The Rigveda*, 3 volumes, New York: Oxford University Press, 2014.

  

Wilson believed that Sāyaṇa understood the Vedas far better than any outsider could. He therefore took Sāyaṇa as his authority for the meaning of the Vedic words and verses, and closely followed Sāyaṇa’s commentary throughout his translation.

Griffith tried to strike a balance between Sāyaṇa’s interpretations and the interpretations of the German scholars who rejected Sāyaṇa, such as Rudolph Roth. His translation is in English verse, which means that he had to adapt the meaning he understood to fit the required number of English syllables.

Satya Prakash and Vidyalankar followed the Arya Samaj line of thought, which rejected Sāyaṇa altogether. However, as comparison will show, they adopted much of Wilson’s translation, and thereby brought in quite a bit of Sāyaṇa’s interpretation, perhaps unwittingly to themselves.

Kashyap followed the Sri Aurobindo line of thought, which also rejected Sāyaṇa. His translation includes some of Sri Aurobindo’s psychological interpretations of the Vedas, meanings which were also elaborated by Kapali Sastry in his unfinished Sanskrit commentary.

Gautam and his team of co-translators tried to jointly ascertain the meaning of the Vedic verses, and when they reached unanimity on this they attempted to put this meaning into modern English. This translation differs quite a bit from the other English translations.

Tulsi Ram’s translation is described in the online listings as following the Arya Samaj line of thought. The one verse I saw from it seemed to be an expanded paraphrase rather than a translation as such.

Jamison and Brereton’s translation is subtitled “The Earliest Religious Poetry of India,” which shows their approach. It draws upon the advances in scholarship over the last century, and will replace Karl Geldner’s German translation as the standard of reference for most Western scholars.
