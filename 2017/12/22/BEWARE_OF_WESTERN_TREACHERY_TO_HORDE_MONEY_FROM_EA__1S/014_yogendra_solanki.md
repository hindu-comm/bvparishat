Dear Prof. Sivakumar,  
  
You are absolutely correct. Today they have started charging $5, next will be more charges only. But you will not find much support from Indian-Hindu people. It is a sad part of our Indian Education. Each highly educated person, though spiritual ( I can not dare to say religious), but defines Karma as per his/her convenience.  
  
Modi has decided to share information of NRIs' properties in India with US, but after sometime, US will for sure ask for taxes as well. US Govt works for dual way, on one hand they give charities, on the other hand they take away everything we have. One one hand they come to India to help poor, on the other hand they convert millions, and convince them to fight against Hindus. So we are fighting with our brothers only.  
  
There is a श्लोक क्रियावाचेमनसि एकरुपताम् but this never happens. Talking something and doing something else. That is why India is one of third world country. But people will write every now and then - I am Proud to be Indian - I am Proud to be a Hindu. But in real life you will not find much support.  
  
Thanks to Rajiv Malhotra who brought all these conspiracy to our notice, but some people do not want to believe it. We already lost Kashmir, Kerala and Eastern states to xians, these are the example of being Ostrich.  
  
If we do something , it will be counted as a Karma, if we do not do anything that as well will be counted as Karma.
