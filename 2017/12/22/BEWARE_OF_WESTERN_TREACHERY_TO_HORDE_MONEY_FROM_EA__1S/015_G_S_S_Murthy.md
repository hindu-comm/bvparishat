As far as I know, this is Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad, in letter and in spirit. How does a subject like conversion from Hinduism to Christianity find a place in these discussions unless this august group has morphed itself to Hindu Vidvat Parishad? May I draw the kind attention of the Administrator?

Regards,

Murthy
