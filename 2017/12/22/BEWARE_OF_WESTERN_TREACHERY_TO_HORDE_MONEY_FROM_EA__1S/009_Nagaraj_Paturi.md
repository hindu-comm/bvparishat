Sri Venkatesh Murthy-ji,

  

Correcting Prof. Sivakumar's paranoia /conspiracy theory about [archive.org](http://archive.org) need not necessarily lead to aatmanindaa by Indians which has become a characteristic of some of the . contemporary Indians. Aatmanindaa and parastuti is not a necessary /essential counter when you perceive aatmastuti and paranindaa in your correspondent's words. Perceiving aatmastuti and paranindaa in one's correspondent's words and taking it as an error born of subjectivity sometimes erroneously leads to aatmanindaa and parastutiwhich is mistaken for objectivity. True objectivity lies in the ability to identify merits and demerits on both sides.
