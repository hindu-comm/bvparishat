Namaste,  
  
I agree with Sankaraji and Abhishek Chatterjee ji.. Prof Sivakumar doesn't seems to know what he is writing.. [archives.org](http://archives.org) has kept downloading and uploading free and will for ever keep downloading and uploading free. That's their promise and hence they collect funds from users as voluntary donations once a year. If you like to donate you may else you may not. May be you conveniently forget there is donate button on on the site you pointed <https://rajivmalhotra.com/get-involved/donate/>.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
