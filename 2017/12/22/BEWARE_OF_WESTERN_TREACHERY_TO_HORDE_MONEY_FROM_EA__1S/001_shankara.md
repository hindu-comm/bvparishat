Prof. Sivakumar,

  

I think your post is based on wrong information or misunderstanding. As a frequent user of [archive.org](http://archive.org), I know that one does not have to contribute any money in order to download files from [archive.org](http://archive.org). There is no compulsion at all in this regard.

  

It is true that once a year, there is a fund raising campaign exhorting users to make voluntary donations.  

  

regards  
shankara
