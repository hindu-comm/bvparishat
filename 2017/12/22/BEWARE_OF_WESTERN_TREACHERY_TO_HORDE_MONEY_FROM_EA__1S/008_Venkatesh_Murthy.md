Namaste

  

The great Indian minds of ancient India are our past. Present Indians do not have even a fraction of the greatness of the ancients. Education and research in India is poor standard. We have to accept there is a gulf of difference between ancient Indians and today's Indians. There is no body greattoday. I asked a learned Sanskrit professor Shri Rama Nath Sharma - is Kashi a good place to study Sastras. He said it is not good. If this is the fate of Kashi imagine other places.
