That true of every service in the world. Is there anything free ?. If some one gives anything free another person has to pay. If scholar offers free teaching or writing some one has to pay for the scholars lively hood. I cannot understand objections raised. I am not a spokesman for [archives.org](http://archives.org) yet I am writing this. One can view anything and everything with suspension or one can take advantages of the resources that are offered at [arhives.org](http://arhives.org) for free. If one feels [archives.org](http://archives.org) is cheating one need not upload ones material there. If there is violation of law the same can be reported to archives.

  

This theory of of seeing conspiracy behind every act in this world is funny indeed.
