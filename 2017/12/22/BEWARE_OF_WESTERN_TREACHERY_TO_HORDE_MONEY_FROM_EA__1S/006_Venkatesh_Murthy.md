Namaste

  

In the era of Globalization all human beings have become mostly the same. We are not better than Westerners. How many corrupt Indian welfare organizations are collecting donation money? Donation money is used for personal gains by corrupt organizations. We cannot even give donations because the donations are going to the pocket of some greedy persons and not to serve the needy. People are the same every where.
