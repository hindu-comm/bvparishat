SAdara SAshtAnga praNAm,

  

It has been our tradition to help all who are in search of knowledge and in need of medical help. Our Aharyas extended the help to the needy without expecting anything in return.

But the western culture is not to extend any help without demanding a sumptuous return.

Our tradition made many of us to upload many books in internet archive. At first they did not charged for downloading a data. Now the cat has come out! They have started requesting $5.Tomorrow they will start charging for downloads, for that has been their tradition. We, good at heart, will be loosing the very right of the uploaded data.Beware of supporting and depending on the Internet Archive!Those who are having doubt may discus the matter with Sri.Malhotra available at<http://rajivmalhotra.com/>

  

With praNAm,

  

*Prof. Sivakumar*
