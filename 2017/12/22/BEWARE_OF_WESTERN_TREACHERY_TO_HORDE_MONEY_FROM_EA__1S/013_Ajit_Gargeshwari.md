The same argument is true for government. Government collect taxes and provide service to citizens. An Ashrama or Matha collects money from public and run their activities. Armed forces get salary from the money government collects from individuals Dont you see a conspiracy in all these activities? One can have intuitions or arguments based on dreaming or non existence like a hares horn or based on facts its left to individuals. I don't see any core arguments but see only wild imaginations imagined conspiracy and wild theories.  

  

I have not seen any trickery with [archives.org](http://archives.org) from the last 15 years. May be you are imagining a conspiracy. Let me listen to your arguments allow books to be eaten by rats and insects do nothing to make hem accessible or preserve them digitally and will keep inventing conspiracy theory on any individual or organization that's doing a good job in keeping knowledge free and open for one and all on a perpetual basis.

  

I have said what I need to Thank you for reading.
