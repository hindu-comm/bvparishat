Dear Sri G S S Murthy-ji,

  

The post to which you are responding has many factual errors such as

  

"Today they have started charging $5"

  

which has already been pointed out and corrected by different members in response to the thread initiator.

  

What [archive.org](http://archive.org) keeps asking for is donation.

  

Coming to issues like Hinduism, evangelism etc., though it seems to be as digressing as the other aspects of the post here, in general, the issue is a little tricky. Whether one likes it or not , academics in Social Sciences and Humanities in general and Language and Literature studies, Philosophy and other such studies in particular, Sanskrit and Indic Knowledge Tradition studies more in particular, may not escape from issues like religions and motivations like evangelism etc. for different academic or academic-looking activities.

  

BVP's policy statement has the following:

  

Members may discuss Government policies specifically those policies that are related to Sanskrit or Indological Studies.Discussion of politics in general within the frame work of historical understanding of Indological studies or Sanskrit, in specific,*is allowed.*(highlighting mine)  

  

Email forums of western Indologists whom many of us admire greatly , do not at all hesitate to discuss such matters.

  

In this case too, if there were to be a valid and relevant connection for Hinduism, evangelism and other such matters to the topic under question or if the members bringing up such matters provided any proof of their claims in this regard, such discussion would have been well within the norms of the forum.

  

The discussion of such matters is certainly irrelevant in the context of this thread, since proof of relevance has not been provided.

  

The thread is being closed as there seems to be no scope for any new addition of knowledge.
