Namaste

  

The big sadIrony of Sanskrit scholarship -

  

India will be most populous country by 2025. It will overtake population of China.

<https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-to-outnumber-China-in-population-by-2025-US-Census-Bureau/articleshow/7189858.cms>

  

BUT the number of Sanskrit scholars is decreasing. Old scholars die but there is no young scholars to replace them. The corrupt Government does nothing. In ancient times Kings were supporting Sanskrit studies. Democracy as a form of government has failed everywhere in the world including USA. The wise saying is the biggest defect of democracy-
Votes are counted but not weighed. The vote of a fool has same weight as the vote of a learned person.
