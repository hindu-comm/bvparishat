Namaste,

  

I may pleased by excused if I have referred a blog here which may be violation of norms. But found this article interesting especially the "Contribution of women scholars in the field of Advaita Philosophy".

  

Here is the link:

Apart from the above list, I know few women scholars who have surpassed men in terms of spiritual achievements be it yOga-mArga / tantra-mArga etc. Though, they have not undergone 'upanayana' ceremony in a traditional way but are on par with traditional, orthodox men in terms of spiritual luminance and achievement.

  

regs,  

sriram
