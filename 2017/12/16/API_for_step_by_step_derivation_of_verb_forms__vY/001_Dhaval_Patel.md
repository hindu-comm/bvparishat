For all friends who find the API business too technical, there is now a more user friendly way to use the work.

  

1\. Open <http://api.sanskritworld.in/#!/default/get_get_prakriya>  

2\. Enter verbform in SLP1 e.g. Serate / Bavati etc.  

3\. Click on Try it Out!  

4\. See the Response Body for step by step derivation.  

  

If you are not familiar or comfortable with SLP1, you can transliterate back and forth from your favourite transliteration scheme in <http://www.learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript>.

  

P.S. - I personally extend my thanks to Mr. Vishvas Vasuki for drawing my attention and interest in flask-restplus and swagger documentation.
