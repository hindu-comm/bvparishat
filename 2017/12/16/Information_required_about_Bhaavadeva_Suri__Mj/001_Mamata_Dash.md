With regards,

the New Catalogue Catalogorum, vol XVII adds this Bhaavadeva Suuri entry. Though the PArshavanAthacarita author is the disciple of Jinadeva SUri, there is one text KAlakAcAra kathAnaka and another YatidinacaryA, may be by him. Because it is told that this Bhaavadeva sUri is the descendant of KAlakasUri.
