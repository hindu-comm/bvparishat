Dear scholars,

  

Many of the statements made by Prof.V.Pandurangi are unfortunately true and such institutes have become an arena of politically powerful and govt.patronised scholars who push their own persons and interests and least bothering about the subject or the future of the institute.It is a kind of a Herculean task for the successive administrators to reform those institutes.Prof.Varkhedi hopefully will have to try to check such practices.

I wish him success in this effort.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
