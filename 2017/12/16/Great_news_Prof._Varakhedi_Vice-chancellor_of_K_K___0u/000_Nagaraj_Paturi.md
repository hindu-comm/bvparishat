I am glad to share the great news of our respected Prof. Srinivasa Varakhedi-ji is now the Vice-Chancellor of Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University, Ramtek, Nagpur.

  

He took every institute that he lead to the best heights of development.

  

I witnessed how he transformed the Sanskrit Academy on the campus of Osmania University from an obscure place into an institute of buzz and development.

  

I am currently a beneficiary of his networking of resources for Indic Knowledge Studies all over the country.

  

A huge number of Sanskrit or Indic Knowledge Studies institutes/universities are making use of his excellent leadership skills.
