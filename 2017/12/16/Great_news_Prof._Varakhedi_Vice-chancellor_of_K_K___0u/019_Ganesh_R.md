Dear Prof. Varakhediji,

  

Please accept my hearty congratulations. In you I see an incisive mind that is empowered with a warm and kind heart, a rare and enviable combination that is much needed to bring dignity and efficiency to such high offices that you have justly adorned. I wish you success in all your personal and public activities that are going to enrich Sanskrit and the sublime culture for which it is committed to.

  

With utmost warm regards

  

Ganesh
