I too extend congratulations to my (and everybody's) friend Prof. Varakhedi for not only taking over as VC but for the effort he will put there to make it a good center of learning.

  

the situation is alarming in samskrit world. somebody has produced these samskrit universities out of for samskrit or vote share, and left them in lurch. त्यक्ताः पितृभ्यां वने. there are no caretakers. the VCs take charge for every three/four/five years and use these varsities to put their own people as much as possible, and nothing else. I have seen many people who want to become VC only to get a ex VC tag. prof. Narang used to joke "these people are even ready to go to hell for the sake of ex VC (of hell) tag", true, these varsities are not too faraway from becoming hells, unless we take drastic steps to regulate them in right way.

  

there is no common goal, everybody is running in his own way. no continuous policy in academic administration is being followed. therefore many universities have suddenly become dull due to policy changes, best example is a well known centrally funded deemed university in south india(not now offcourse, it was a little old story). Sometimes I feel that even many old samskrit colleges are maintained better than universities founded anew.

  

I publicly request prof. Varakhedi to concentrate to set the rules for administration of samskrit universities across nation rather than routine file-signing job in KKGKSU.

  

for example, 1. it is the age of bogus research due to the UGC pressure. no one will become a good scholar in the present carriculam, and the research they produce will be bogus as well. 2. due to UGC rules many universities are being forced to adopt the semester system fully. we need to think properly about such practices. 3. similar is the story of research journals. if we follow UGC rules no samskrit student will be able to publish an article in such a reputed journals, because reputed journals are not sufficient to cater the needs, and all the bogus journals are the only help for the students.

we need to reform the carriculam, departmentisation of knowledge so our students will get comprehensive knowledge of shastras.

we need to integrate modern subjects like yoga and computer to help our students to be employable.

  

I hope prof. Varakhedi will take some steps to meet these challenges. with his dynamic leadership we will achieve a lot.

  

I know it is easy to suggest/ write policy papers for central government. it is very difficult to make policy work. 

  

but we need to realise the problems to solve them.
