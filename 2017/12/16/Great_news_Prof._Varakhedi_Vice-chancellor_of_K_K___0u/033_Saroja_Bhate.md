I completely agree with Prof. BVK Shastri.I would like to emphasize one point: Dialogue between the oriental erudition and modern scholarship is the need of the time.We should honestly accept पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वम् while glorifying the achievements of our predecessors. at the same time a deeper penetration in to the treasure of literature of the past is bound to yield many a precious gems of wisdom relevant to the modern times.For this however a clear unprejudiced open approach is badly needed. The main problem is: Who will do it?
