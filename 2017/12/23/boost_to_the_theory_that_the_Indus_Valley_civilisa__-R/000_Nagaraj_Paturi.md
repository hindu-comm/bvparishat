The same Tony Joseph has come up with yet another article

  

# Who built the Indus Valley civilisation?

<http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/who-built-the-indus-valley-civilisation/article22261315.ece>  

  

This time, he projected four different scenarios and in the first scenario , he concludes

  

"For the advocates of the Vedic Aryans-as-Harappans theory, the finding would be the long-awaited confirmation of what they have always asserted without proof: The Indus Valley civilisation was Vedic, and the Aryans were those who built it."

  

-----------------

  

"No matter how this debate proceeds, there is no question that finding R1a in the Rakhigarhi samples would give a significant boost to the theory that the Indus Valley civilisation was Vedic Aryan"

  

One good development in his approach this time is, he repeatedly says something like:

  

Every single Indian, *like the vast majority of the human population*, is a descendant of migrants and almost every Indian carries multiple lineages.  

  

"Our cultural traditions, myths, beliefs, practices, languages, and physical attributes are all, at the same time, both indigenously evolved and adapted as well as acquired from elsewhere, much the same as it is for every other civilisation on earth."  

  

He even goes to the extent of saying,

  

"Our uniqueness lies in the way we have created a common fabric out of it all, over time."

  

That is why I keep saying that in stead of worrying about the languages of India being classified into four different language families, it is better to focus on " India as a Linguistic Area"<http://eemaata.com/books/India%20as%20a%20Linguistic%20Area%20-%20Emeneau.pdf>, which focuses on the 'convergence' among Indian languages.

  

Also, it is better to remind those who keep saying you came from outside, that all humans came to their present locations from outside , from Africa.
