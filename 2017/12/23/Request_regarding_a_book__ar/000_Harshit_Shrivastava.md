I request all the scholars to please let me know the details of Rasollasa Tantra (रासोल्लास तंत्र). Please let me know that from where can I read this great Vaishnava book? From where it is published? (Better if along with hindi translation) I desperately want to read this book, whether soft copy or hard copy! Please help me!!
