Dear Members,

I recently prepared the text of a talk I gave at a Seminar on **Science & Technology in the Indic Tradition** at the Indian Institute of Science in February. My talk was on **Concept of Probability in Sanskrit Texts on Classical Music.** The paper is slated to appear in the Proceedings in the next 1-2 months. Since in BVP there are many Sanskrit scholars interested in music and also there are enthusiasts like me exploring *Science in Sanskrit*, I am sharing a pre-print of my paper here. The article may be of interest also to research students looking for new topics and methods.

Observations, discussions and comments are welcome.

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
