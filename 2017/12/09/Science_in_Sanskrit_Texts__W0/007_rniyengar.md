Dear Dr.BVK, Namaskaara! Thanks for reacting to my paper. We are on the same page when it comes to importance of reviving Sanskrit academic- intellectual- scholarly tradition true to its original tenets. But I recognize there are some differences too in our perceptions. Please read on:

Thanks for pinpointing that contemporary Sanskrit studies should not leave out Music which is as much part and parcel of sanaatana-dharma as any other shastraic subject. Colonial writings have in fact colored this segment quite a bit; but then for good and also for bad! It depends on how historically you map out the effects. For example, introduction of Violin (courtesy the Great Muthuswami Dikshitar) has been beneficial. But the Pythogorean imitation of dividing the string and the claim of some scholars that Indian music also follows that or a similar law is an imitational drag. The Indian gamut is more abstract as detailed in the Sanskrit treatises.

Again thanks for your kind words. You write 'when one connects'. Yes; but it all depends on 'how one connects'. If this leads to claims such as "the present day Veena was known in the Tretayuga", then I am afraid it becomes empty rhetoric. On the other hand if it is recognized that like Sanskrit words changing their meanings, objects can change although their name may remain same; it will be a worthwhile point for further research.

I am not sufficiently learned in VyaakaraNa to respond meaningfully to this point. What I have observed is that Bharta- and before him Naarada- developed classical music as a 'dhvani/naada/shabda' shastra in parallel with Grammar. But then there is a big difference, Sanskrit as a language is used in the texts to describe music, but music itself in its Raaga and NirgIta modes is independent of any articulated language. In this sense music theory is more general than PaaNinian constructs. This seems to be the derivative result over a period of time of the Samaveda style of singing, where the words themselves (originally Rgvedic) seem to lose theirUcchaarana importance. This is an area in need of systematic comparativestudy. Now, of course as you imply if Sanskrit scholars distance themselves from traditional modes of abstract thinking and fall prey to simplistic approaches, western linguists will fill the gap with their grey-matter colors; this is unavoidable.



With regards
