Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

Thanks for sharing the paper. I have discussed this issue in my monograph and formulated a concept of \`Shruti-Punja' or \`Shruti-Megha'. I am quite happy that empirical and computational research in music is now proceeding in this direction. I am also attaching a PDF copy of my monograph for ready reference (though you already have the monograph with you). The discussion about \`Shruti-Punja' comes at the end of the monograph. I am also attaching a paper on \`Shruti-Nidarshanam' experiment.

  

Thanks once again

  

With Warm Regards

  

--- Vinod Vidwans
