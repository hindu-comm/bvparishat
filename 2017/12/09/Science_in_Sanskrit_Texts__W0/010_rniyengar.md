Dear Members,

The proceedings of the Conference is not yet published and I do not know when it will come out. However, I sent my work to the Indian J of History of Science for possible publication. After peer review and some revisions the paper got published recently with an altered title. ( The word 'probability' in the title was too scary for the reviewer and perhaps for the readers; hence changed !) I am sharing a copy of the *published version* with scholars of Sanskrit, history, science & music.

thanks  

  

RN Iyengar
