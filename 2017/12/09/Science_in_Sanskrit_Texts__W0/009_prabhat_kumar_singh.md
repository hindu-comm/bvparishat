Dear Sir,

  

I very much agree that we need to unite forces. I am a programmer and have been working tirelessly over past 10 years for deploying machine learning using Sanskrit. I am not promoting, but soliciting common direction.

I have developed an English>Sanskrit translator(link<https://xn--l1b8d.xn--h2brj9c/>). It is 0.02% complete as of yet. My vision is to make an AGI using this framework. Currently AGI(artificial general intelligence) is almost non-existant in practice but only theories. If we could,अथ.भारत will be first of its kind and establish the mettle of our great heritage. It won't ever be called a dead language or impractical. It will allow people to collaborate and usher 4th Industrial revolution of AI & robotics.

  

History is written by winners. We have a great history but bleaker recent past. We now have a great opportunity.

  

Looking forward for thoughts from learned members of the group.

  

Namo Namah
