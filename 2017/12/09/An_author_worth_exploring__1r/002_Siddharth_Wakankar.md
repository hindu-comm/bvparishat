Dear Sir,

I read ,some 40 years back,his excellent book,in a typed form, on the Vayupurana and other books on History.His command over Sanskrit was phenomenal.

I would prefer to read his book on the Lalita Cult,if it could be easily procured.

  

Thanks and regards.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
