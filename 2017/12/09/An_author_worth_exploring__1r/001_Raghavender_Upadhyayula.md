Dear Subramanian gaaru,

  

I had the fortune of reading his works long back. And I have in my possession a book written by him on the origin of Lalita Sampradaya or Upasana.

The book is titled "The Lalita Cult".

He has nicely traced the sakta sampradaya, from Vedic times.

  

Thanks for bringing this to the forum.

If I am not wrong, he was a contemporary of Dr V. Raghavan.
