Dear Sir Raghavendra,

  

That book in the typed form ,in all five copies,is in the Library of the Oriental Institute

,M S University of Baroda.Possibly,it was presented to the Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. I do not know whether it is brought out in the form of the book.

You may request the Librarian of the O.I.MSU,Baroda,opposite Palace Gate,Palace Road,Vadodara-390001-Gujarat.ph.0265.2425121, for its Xerox copy.

We have his other books also in .O.I.Library.

You may look into the MSU.website for other details.

At present,am out of Baroda

  

Best luck in your efforts.  

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar
