Dear N. K. Sundareswaran,

The Vedanta work KAIVALYANAVANEETAM is in Tamil written by Tandavaraya Swami of Nannilam. And it is said that the Sanskrit version of it was written by Krishna Pandita (Pupil of Brahmananda Yati) name KAIVALYA DEEPIKA (with onw PRABHA commentary).

I got the paper manuscript of Kaivalya deepika (with Prabha commentary) from the Oriental Library and did my research in its edition and critical study. And it is being published. You mentioned that the Sanskrit Version of it is written by Shankukavi has been published in 1940. I tried a lot to get this copy but I could get up to 55 pages of its PDF somehow.

If you want to know more about it I will share it
