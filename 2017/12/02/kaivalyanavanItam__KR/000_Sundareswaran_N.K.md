Dear Scholars,

There is a Sanskrit version of the Vedanta work KAIVALYANAVANTAM. it is said that the original work is in Tamil written by Tandavaraya swami of Nannilam.

The Sanskrit version is written by शङ्कुकवि. This has been published by R. S. Vadhyar & Sons (Palghat, Kerala), in 1940's. It contains a Foreword written by MM. N.S. Ananthakrishna Sastriar . Sastriar opines that the Sanskrit version is original and the Tamil version is its translation. Some scholars hold that शङ्कुकवि and Tandavaraya swami are one and the same.

I would like to know whether any further study (or even a new edition) on the Sanskrit version of the text has been brought out .

Thanking in advance,

Sundareswaran
