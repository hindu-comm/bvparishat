Recently, Pujyasri Swami Omkarananda Saraswathi, President of the Gnananda Niketan, visited the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam ashram at Sailorsburg, PA. He lectured on the Kaivalya Navaneetham in Tamil. In the lecture he mentioned that in June of 2017 the Kaivalya Navaneetham translated into Sanskrit by Sanku Kavi was released in book form in Chennai. If my memory serves me right, the Pujya Swami himself presided over the function. If someone wants to purchase the book, they should approach the Gnananda Niketan.  

  

Also, I'd really be surprised if the Ramanasramam Library does not have a copy of this Sanskrit work. They even have a copy of the German translation (publ. 1855 at Leipzig, Germany) of the Tamil Kaivalya Navaneetham. Ramana Maharishi is said t have held the Tamil work Kaivalya Navaneetham in high regard.  

  

Hope this helps,
