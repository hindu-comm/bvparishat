Dear V Subrahmanian ji

  

The Tamil, Telugu and English versions of Kaivalyaneetam are available. I have purchased online. Recently I am not at home, otherwise I would have sent you the correct information.

And about sharing ofpdf of the first 55 pages of the Sanskrit version of Kaivalya-Navanīta by Śaṅkukavi, I will send you it separately. This google group allows only upto 8MB file.

  

Regards
