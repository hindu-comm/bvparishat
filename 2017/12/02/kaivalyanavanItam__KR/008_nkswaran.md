Dear Dr Janakisharan ji,

Thank you for the piece of information.       I too would like to have a copy of Shankukavi's Sanskrit version in pdf form. Kindly share the same on this forum.

I would like to add : There is a Malayalam version (translation) with detailed notes and exposition written by Thiruvallam Bhaskaran Nair. It's avilable in the Archives .
