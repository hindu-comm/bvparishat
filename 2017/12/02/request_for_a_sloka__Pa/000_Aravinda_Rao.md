Namaskaras,

  

I will be grateful if someone provides the sloka which has this meaning.

  

"In order to attain the knowledge of Self, four blessings are needed - the divine blessing, the blessing of the teacher, blessing of the shastra and the blessing of one's own antahkarana". (daivakripa, gurukripa, shastrakripa and antahkaranakripa).
