There is a utility developed by Pratyatosa, called Diacunic. I have been using it for very long. In my opinion this utility offers the greatest ease in using the marks. It is based on the semicolon and after pressing this key one can press a to get elongated a, etc. Unfortunately it is not working on my lap top. Hence my request to this forum. Now I am using the Bhasha IME on my lap top. One has to toggle between Control F8 and F9 each time one uses the utility. For instance if I want to type two or three words in a sentence using the marks, I have to do the toggling several times to accomplish this. In Diacunic, once the software is 'active' one need not do the toggling between other keys. Just the semicolon is enough to accomplish any mark one wants anywhere.
