Many many thanks Prof. Nagaraj ji for the trouble you have taken to guide me further. Unfortunately the trouble seems to be lack of compatibility between my widow 7 ultimate and Bhasha IME. Sri Venkatesh, Bhasha creator, has given an additional download which is supposed to solve it. But that also does not seem to work. I would rather you do not waste you precious time in guiding me any further. I will try to get in touch with Mr.Venkatesh, who had earlier helped me in making my Chandas software self-executable on Windows.

Thanks once again and warm regards,

Murthy
