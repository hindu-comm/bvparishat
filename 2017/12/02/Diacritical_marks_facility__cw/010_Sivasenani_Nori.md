Sir

  

One way of typing letters with diacritical marks at a fair clip in Word is to assign shortcuts. You will find the option for assigning short cuts in the same tab which you need to use to insert symbols. Sample shortcuts:

  

Ctrl + Alt + a = ā

Ctrl + Alt + Shift + a = Ā

Ctrl + Alt + i = ī

Ctrl + Alt + Shift + i = Ī

Ctrl + Alt + u = ū

Ctrl + Alt + Shift + u = Ū

...

  

and so on.

  

If you set this up in all the machines you use (desktop, laptop etc.) and every time those machines are changed (and when you reinstall MS Word), after a while one gets used to it and one can type at normal speed while using Word. Occasionally one will come across hiccups. For instance Ctrl + Alt + s (= ś the way I assigned shortcuts) throws up System Information in the latest HP laptops. So, my solution was to shift to Alt + Shift + s = ś.

  

The above configuration has served me well for many years, nearly a decade now.

  

Regards

Senani
