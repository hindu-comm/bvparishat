\>My question is how does jain dharma historically and presently relate to what we call 1) sanatana dharma, 2) hinduism

  

With sanaatana dharma, it has the relation of being a part of sanaatana dharma.

  

'Hinduism' is not an insider's category.

  

'-ism' , the suffix in this word shows that this is an English word.

  

The word-concept 'religion' was introduced by them into Bhaarat.

  

Since they had a 'religion', they wanted us to fill the column 'religion' in the official forms. The word Hinduism got coined for that purpose.

  

Removing the suffix, the 'Hindu' part of the word is older.

  

That was used by the Persian travellers /invaders in the sense of the people on the other side of the river Sindhu. Since, the people on the other side of the river Sindhu, included Bauddhas and Jainas, the word Hindu referred to all people including Bauddhas and Jainas.

  

In contemporary syllabi of 'Comparative Religion', they classify 'Hinduism', 'Buddhism', 'Jainism' together as 'Dharmic religions'. Jadaism, Christianity, Islam together as Abrahamic religions. Validity / applicability of the word-concept religion aside, classifying'Hinduism', 'Buddhism', 'Jainism'together is justified. But it may be observed that this categorisation already is separating 'Hinduism' from 'Buddhism' and 'Jainism', implying that 'Hinduism' refers only to the Veda-connected aspects of culture of Bhaarat.

  

Gradually this strategy of 'language engineering' or more precisely 'connotational engineering of words' i.e., the efforts to make words mean what the engineering agency wants to mean is heavily under way in the case of the word 'Hinduism'. The objective is to make the word mean narrowest of things, i.e., to contract the semantic field of the word to the narrowest extent possible.'Hinduism' is made to mean just 'Vedic' or even just 'Brahmanical'. All non-Vedic is non-Hindu.

  

The target is BJP, the political party claiming to represent 'Hindus'. The objective is to tell the party that you don't represent these, these, these and these. You (BJP) can not fight for your intellectual heritage etc. coming from the sources other than just the texts of Vedas. The texts of Vedas in any case do not have any intellectual heritage etc. worth the name. So, in essence, you (BJP) have no *locus standi*to fight for the protection of the intellectual heritage etc. of any kind. Whatever intellectual heritage you mention as being fought for by you (BJP), we will show that it comes from outside the texts of Vedas, so non-Vedic, so not to be represented by you.

  

You see any book of Prof. Sheldon Pollock that is being debated now. It begins with the mention of the rise of BJP. You see the book, " Why I am not a Hindu' (arguing for separating folk 'religion' from 'Hinduism') by Prof. Kancha Iliah, patronised by America and Christian missionaries, it begins with the BJP, Ayodhya movement etc.

  

The point is, the word 'Hindu' was created by the western colonisers. The efforts to make it mean the narrower and narrower aspects than what it was originally used for also are of the western and westernised Indian intellectuals only.

  

While these Breaking India efforts are in a full swing, some of the zealots of different schools of Vedanta are busy naively fighting among themselves helping these breaking efforts. 'Whatever is the consequence, I am here to fight these avaidikas in imitation of (my imagined) fight by the founder of my school against these avaidikas.' 'Whatever is the consequence, I am here to fight these Vishnu/Siva followers with whom the founders of my Siva/Vishnu cult was founded'.Whatever is the consequence, I am here to show that these folk cultures are inferior to Vaidika culture' is the spirit of these zealots who naively and unconsciously help these breaking efforts.

  

Identifying and emphasising the mutual continuities among different Dharmic religions is the need of the hour.

  

Sri Sripada Abhayankar-ji, Sri V. Subrahmanian-ji rightly showed such aspects of unity.
