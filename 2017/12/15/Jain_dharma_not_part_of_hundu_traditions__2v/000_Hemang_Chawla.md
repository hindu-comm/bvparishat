Namaste,  
  
My question is how does jain dharma historically and presently relate to what we call 1) sanatana dharma, 2) hinduism  
  
I ask these based on following understanding:  

1.  Non vedic schools i.e. sramana (of which carvaka is also a part) are
    called nastik and those that subscribe to vedas are called aastik 2.  Hindu word was used to have a geographical connotation until islamic
    invasion when abrahmic faiths referred to sanatanis, jains, sikhs
    and buddhist as hindus (as per Dr. Elst) 3.  Jainism was relegated a separate status in 2006 (after apparently a
    hundred years of asking) from hindus

4.  Even still Article 25(2)b of the Indian constitution refers to
    hindus as inclusive of jains, sikhs, and buddhists
    <https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1539376/> 5.  Some state jainism is offshoot of sanatana dharma? But some state
    sramana school is older

What are the arguments for and against this dharmic unity?

  

Thanks
