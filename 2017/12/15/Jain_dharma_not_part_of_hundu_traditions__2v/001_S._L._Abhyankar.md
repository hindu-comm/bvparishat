Dear Mr. Hemang Chawla,

  

Jains offerपंचणमोक्कारो- ॐणमो अरिहंताणं,ॐणमो सिद्धाणं,ॐणमो अवज्झाणं ... etc.Is not ॐ नमो from Hindu tradition ?

  

Jains also have temples. So there is idol worship, which is also primarily Hindu tradition.

  

Jains have 24 तीर्थंकर-s. In Hindu tradition, the संध्या-मन्त्र-s have 24 नमः-s => केशवाय नमः, नारायणाय नमः, माधवाय नमः, गोविन्दाय नमः, ... etc.

  

Many Jain मुनि-s are Sanskrit scholars, though theपंचणमोक्कारो-quote is not Sanskrit and also faults the Sanskrit grammar rule thatनमः should be with fourth case.
