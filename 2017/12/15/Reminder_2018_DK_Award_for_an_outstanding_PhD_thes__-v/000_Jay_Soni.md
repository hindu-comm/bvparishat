Dear Colleagues,

Allow me to remind you that the deadline for the Award is 31st January 2018.

The Award is for an outstanding PhD received in the period 2015-2017 on Sanskrit and related studies. It is for a scholar who is based outside South Asia.

  

The link for the details are given below. Initially you could send me an email showing interest in the Award. After that I'll need the degree document and a letter of support from your main supervisor, together with a link to download your thesis. The hard copies can be sent later to an address I shall provide.

  

Please see the details of the Award here:
