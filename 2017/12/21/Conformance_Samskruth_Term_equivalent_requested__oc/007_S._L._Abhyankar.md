Dear Mr. Karve

  

Dr. Shastry's basic post was on how to ensure that a machine such as a computer will generate/render most appropriate translation.

  

I got a result at [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de). I think, that result is from a large database and not by analysis of components of a word. In fact the result at [spokensanskrit.de](http://spokensanskrit.de) is the verb-form अनुप्रपद्यते although my input was the noun "conformance". So, that, as a machine-output, is not a good output.
