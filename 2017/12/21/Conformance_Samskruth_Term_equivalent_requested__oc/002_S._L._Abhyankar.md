नमस्ते श्रीमन् वेंकटकृष्ण-शास्त्री-महोदय !

Since conformance is behavior according to something, I think संस्कृत-word should be अनुवृत्तिः

  

In the word अनुवृत्तिः

the prefix-component अनु is equivalent to "according to" and

the abstract noun component वृत्तिः is equivalent to "behavior".  

1.  धातुः वृत् seems to be the most appropriate. 2.  The कृत्-प्रत्यय "क्तिन्" also seems to be the most appropriate.

As detailed by you, for a machine to compose the most appropriate equivalent, it is challenging. The word "conformance" also has a prefix "con", the verbal root "form" and a suffix "ance". Considering that prefix सम् better corresponds with "con" आकृ better corresponds with "form" and क्तिन् corresponds quite well with "ance", one may think that समाकृतिः should be the word for conformance. Yet अनुवृत्तिः appeals to be more appropriate than समाकृतिः

  

An analysis of a word such as "conformance" by word-elements contained therein would not help in getting the appropriate संस्कृत-word. Am I right ?
