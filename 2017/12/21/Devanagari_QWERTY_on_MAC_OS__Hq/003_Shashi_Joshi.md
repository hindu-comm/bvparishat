What I mean to say unless you are used to typing on a devanagari typewriter, which has keys arranged different than an english typewriter/keyboard, you don't need anything but google.inout tools.

That way you can type the closest english spelling and it converts to correct devanagari most of the time. A few times it doesn't you can pop up the virtual keyboard and type exactly what you want.

  

Please search 'google input tools', if you have not tried it yet.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
