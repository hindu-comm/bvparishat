1. You are welcome to see and evaluate the ‘ keyboard solution’ - the new product that has been brought out and under ‘ trial test before launch’.



 Lot more development has been completed. Currently I am at Bangalore. You are welcome to visit again and see feel and test hands on the new hardware product which addresses all concerns you have raised
Namely 

(A) to meet the needs of \< those who are not using English keyboard, ***a solution should be found that doesn't force them to learn English keyboard***. > and

(B) provide equal comfort at Hardware level for those \< who are using computers> and \< do know English> and \< comfortably type many Indian Languages \> and

(C ) The Samskrth / Indic language beginners with digital devices , who need not be forced to learn ‘aAbBcCdD ‘ first before ‘अआइई’.





2. Regarding Google Input Tools and its convenience, Yes, there is good advantage and the product has been serving the need of ‘ many users already knowing English and Devanagari. ( Or those who rely on the Google engine efficiency for Transliteration at Browser level, and Unicode compliance! I am working at the level of ‘ Primary Character editor / Word pad which is critically needed as a basic editor of Unicode multilingual characters. Right now we are operating under the cool shade of Microsoft Word options. This may not lost long or is already lined up to come at a cost to the user. So it is prudent to have localization of Digital devices in a mode that meets the needs of Indian language users without forcing them to learn English Keyboard.

Sastry ji,

Thank you elaborating the topic for the benefit of all. I have met you at your home in Bangalore and am aware of your wonderful work.



I had already clarified in my mail that for those who are not using English keyboard, a solution should be found that doesn't force them to learn English keyboard.

Here is the last part of my email:

"So as far as a quick solution for typing devanagari on a regular Englishkeyboard goes, I strongly recommend google input tools.*If one is not going to use Englishkeyboard and is used to Hinditypewriter or some other layout, then it is a different story. Then we sure need better solutions*."



But most folks who are using computers do know English. And being able to type not just Devanagri, but most Indian scripts using the same keyboard does give some ease of use.

As long as we are using a keyboard, any, the script part is dying just a bit.



Google Input tools does provide a very easy and quick solution to typing in most Indic scripts.

That is all I am saying.

I am not saying this is the only solution and must be the only solution.

But there is large body of internet users who do find it useful.

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
