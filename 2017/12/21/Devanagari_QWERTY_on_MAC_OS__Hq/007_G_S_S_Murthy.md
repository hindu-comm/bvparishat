Google input tools do not work on my laptop which has windows10.I would request guidance if any of you has successfully used Google input tools on Windows 10 machine. I do not have Office suite I make do with Libre. I am not sure if the problem is with Libre and not Windows 10.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
