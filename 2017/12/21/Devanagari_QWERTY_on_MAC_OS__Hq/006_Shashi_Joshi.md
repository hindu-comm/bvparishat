I understand your point very well.

But many of us are used to english keyboards and for them it becomes very easy to have google input tool kind of solution.

Its limitation is only as much as of unicode font, which is only regarding some missing ligatures .  
  
I agree that it abstracts one level away from the devanagari script, but then anything except a pen and paper would be abstracting away from the life of a script. For, a script is not to be punched with one finger but to be drawn, calligraphied with a flowing pen or stylus.

  

So as far as a quick solution for typing devanagari on a regular english keyboard goes, I strongly recommend google input tools. If one is not going to use english keyboard and is used to hindi typewriter or some other layout, then it is a different story. Then we sure need better solutions.  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
