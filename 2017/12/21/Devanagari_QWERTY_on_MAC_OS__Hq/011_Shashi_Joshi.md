Sastry ji,

Thank you elaborating the topic for the benefit of all. I have met you at your home in Bangalore and am aware of your wonderful work.

  

I had already clarified in my mail that for those who are not using English keyboard, a solution should be found that doesn't force them to learn English keyboard.

Here is the last part of my email:

"So as far as a quick solution for typing devanagari on a regular Englishkeyboard goes, I strongly recommend google input tools.*If one is not going to use Englishkeyboard and is used to Hinditypewriter or some other layout, then it is a different story. Then we sure need better solutions*."  

  

But most folks who are using computers do know English. And being able to type not just Devanagri, but most Indian scripts using the same keyboard does give some ease of use.

As long as we are using a keyboard, any, the script part is dying just a bit.

  

Google Input tools does provide a very easy and quick solution to typing in most Indic scripts.

That is all I am saying.

I am not saying this is the only solution and must be the only solution.

But there is large body of internet users who do find it useful.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
