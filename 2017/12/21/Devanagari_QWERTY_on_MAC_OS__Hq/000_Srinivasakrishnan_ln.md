Recently I had good and bad experience with the subject topic.

  

1\. The Office on my Mac (Word 2011) could never render Devanagari for a long time.

2\. Recently after I upgraded my OS and upgraded my MS Office for Mac versions, showing Devanagari and Tamil have been made possible. Dont know how this miracle actually happened.  

3\. I can type Tamil using the Anjal method (that ships with the Mac) and I can render any document without any problem.  

4\. As for Sanskrit docs, I can render any doc that I have created with other software like Pages etc.  

5\. I still can not input Sanskrit source using the Devanagari QWERTY input method (that ships with the Mac)

6\. I am running Mac OS High Sierra 10.12.6. I'm also running Microsoft Word for Mac 2011 version 14.7.7.  

  

Does anyone have a solution to the above problem? I'm right now not going to upgrade to MS Office for Mac 2016.  

  

Thanks,
