History of the Tamils from the earliest times to 600AD by PT Srinivasa Iyengar (Reprint 1989 Rs.65/-)is a very good book. He quotes from both Tamil and Sanskrit texts to describe his version of Tamil history. The book should be available in the market (Asian Educational Services, 5,Sripuram I street, Chennai 600014 )
