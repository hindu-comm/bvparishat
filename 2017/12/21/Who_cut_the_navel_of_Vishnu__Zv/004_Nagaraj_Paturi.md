It is the cyclic nature of the Trimurti system which is the basis of Brahma's birth from the navel of the sustainer Vishnu.

Among various cyclic patterns, the Vishnu to Brahma cyclic relation is analogous to the tree to fruit/seed cyclic relation. Brahma the seed 'creates' the tree, theViraat the cosmic manifest universe visualised as Vishnu, from which/whom the fruit/seed for thenext creationgets generated. Brahma from the navel of Vishnu is a depiction of this cyclic relation.
