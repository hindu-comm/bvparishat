Dear Sir,

  

By highlighting the esoteric aspect I am not in any way denying the existence of Vishnu or Brahma. If one looks deeply into the Ramayana or MB one will find esoteric significance related to ascent of Kundalini etc, but this does not mean Sri Rama, Sri Krishna and the Pandavas are fictional/mythical.

When absolute reality manifests, it carries the patterns of its "DNA" within the lila too.

  

So I would not discount the exoteric or the esoteric.

  

When I said MG's question was cute, I just meant that he took the symbol literally and extended the same symbol to an irrelevant territory.

  

But now thinking about it, anything created in a dream acquires a life of its own. SO in that sense the creator is separated from the dreamer by His own nescience brought about by Yoga Maya.

  

My 2 cents,

  

Venkat
