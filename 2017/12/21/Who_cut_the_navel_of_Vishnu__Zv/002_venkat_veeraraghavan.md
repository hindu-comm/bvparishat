MG: Very cute indeed.

  

As Dmitri mentioned it is symbolic. Esoterically: Brahma represent the creative impulse of Vishnu who creates from His navel. In Yoga nidra the awareness is directed from the navel center which is also thew center of WILL. WILL decides the persistence and stregth of the dream.

Exoterically Kshirodhakasayi Vishnu represents the child inside the placenta swimming in amniotic fluid. His navel is connected to the created world (inside-out) which is represented by Brahma.

So exoterically speaking the answer to your question is mid-wife.
