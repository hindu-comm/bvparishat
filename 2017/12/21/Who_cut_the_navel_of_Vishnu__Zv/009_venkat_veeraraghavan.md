Dear Sir,

  

I would just like to comment about one sentence here:

"Since ‘lotus-springing-from-human-navel’ is not a biological possibility"

  

Swami Vishuddhanada of benaras would disagree with that statement...:)

  

It was recorded with a few disciples of his and certain outsiders that the swami while ina certain mood, pressed his navel and a red lotus bloomed out of his navel and the room was filled with a pleasant scent.

  

Again..I did not see this, but the accounts do exist.

  

Regards,

  

V
