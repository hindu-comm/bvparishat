Respected Vidvaans  
  
Here are two links (English and Hindi) to a long story based on the iconography of Vishnu sleeping on a bed of serpents while a lotus flower emerges from his navel.

I had written this story in May 2012. I did not use the traditional meaning of the phrase PADMANABH as ‘from whose navel springs the lotus flower.’ Since ‘lotus-springing-from-human-navel’ is not a biological possibility, I chosen another dictionary meaning of NABH /navel as ‘center’ and translated PADMANABH as ‘center of a lotus stock.’ My story is based on the assumption that the Hindu Gods are not merely symbols/ icon or *lilapurush* लीलापुरुष (god playing the role of man), but that they were our ancestors who actually lived during the the earliest phase of human civilization. The story is also based on the assumption that even if the Gods are supernaturalbeings who take avatar and perform role / *lila* as human beings they have to obey the laws of nature and cannot do anything that a human cannot do.

  

Thus, in the above-linked story, no lotus flower emerges from Vishnu's navel and hence nobody cut it.
