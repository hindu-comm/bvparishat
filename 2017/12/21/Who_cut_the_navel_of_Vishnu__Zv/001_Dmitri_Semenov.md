"Lotus-navelled" involves symbolism that shall not be stretched too far. Even the verb jan- when applied to deva-s is not to be understood the same way when it is applied to humans and animals.  
Thus attempts to extend symbolic images into details from other domain are leading to nothing but confusion. The answer to your question is "the question is not applicable/valid".
