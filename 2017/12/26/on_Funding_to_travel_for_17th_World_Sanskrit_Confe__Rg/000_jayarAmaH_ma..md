Namaste  

  

In this August forum of scholars of Indology I would like to make a query on behalf of those whose abstracts have been accepted (including mine) for presentation but do not have the means, personally or officially, to travel to the 17th World Sanskrit conference to be held at Vancouver, Canada from July 9-13 2017.  

  

The conference organizers have made it clear in their website that they will not be sponsoring any.

  

Hence, what are the funding sources for such individuals?  

  

regards

Jayaraman
