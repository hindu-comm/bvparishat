Vidvaa.msas!  
  
Is there any difference in meaning between su'jaata and sujaata' (the difference between the two words is udatta accent) in Rigveda?  
It seems there are actually two different words here.  
  
Difference in udatta accent cannot be explained (to the best of my understanding) by change of it due to different declensions cases as shown by two examples  
  
RV 1.72.3 su'jaataa.h  
RV 2.2.11 sujaataa'.h  
  
Best,  
 Dmitri.
