I have two queries. I will be grateful for answers/pointers.

  

1\. Does buddhist chanting also have the concept of udaatta/anudaatta etc ?

  are there any specfic traditional buddhist texts for these ? - are they informed/influenced by praatishaakyas ?

  Any pointers to papers/books on this topic will help.

 

  

2\. Are there any sanskrit manuscripts that are translations of Chinese sources.

  For eg: there are in chinese records that the works of 'Laozi' was translated into Sanskrit and sent to India.

  Is there anything in Sanskrit that are translations from Texts that originated out of India ?.

  I am not looking for supposed greek influence etc - but interested in east-asian or arabic translations into Sanskrit.

  

thank you.

regards.

subrahmanya
