This thread seems to be discussing two different aspects:

1\. Existence of भवान् (सर्वनाम) and भवन् (भूसत्तायाम्+शतृ). Declension of the two are different and there is no reason to get confused between the two words.

2\. Mixing up of भवान् and युष्मद् while referring to the same person in a conversation. Usage seems to allow the mixing up so long as मध्यम पुरुष is avoided in a sentence with भवान्. In भवति भिक्षां देहि, we need to assume that it is a shortened form of भवति! त्वं भिक्षां देहि.

Does what is given above give the correct picture?  

Regards,

Murthy
