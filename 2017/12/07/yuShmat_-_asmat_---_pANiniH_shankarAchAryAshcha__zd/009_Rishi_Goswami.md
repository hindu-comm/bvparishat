नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।  
Koradaji, and all Vaiyakaran-s! I once again was reading Ugitashch where I came accross something I may have in my subconscious but not able to recollect.Something which maybe in front of my eyes but Im not able to concieve.  
  
भवत् शब्द being Davatvant(ugit), why on ङीप् no नुमागम? भवान् has नुमागम so why not in भवती?  
  
Also, what exactly is व्यपदेशिवद्भाव? When भवत् is considered Avyutpanna Pratipadik, that is not डवत्वन्त, we say that we say that we need उगित् for ङीप्। So its Okay for ङीप् due to व्यपदेशिवद्भावेन ङीप् स्यात्। So Bhavatee is Sadhu. Is it because we do not consider Bhavatee as Ugit?
