Apropos Sri GSSMurthy's first point.

  

1\. There is a reason for confusion/conflation between the two.

**The base of both is *bhavat in the Masculine*.**

But once we look into their derivations, we perceive the difference.

  

2\. The pronoun is Root *bhA* (*dIptau*) + *Davatu (uNAdi)*which yields

***bhavat* as the base** for the Masculine, and

*bhavatI* as the base for the Feminine.

(Apparently, there is no such base in the Neuter).

  

The forms in the Nominative in this case are

*bhavAn bhavantau bhavantaH* in the Masculine, and

*bhavatI bhavatyau bhavatyaH* in the Feminine.

(The forms in the other Cases are easy to guess, I suppose.)

  

3\. The noun/adjective (actually the Present Participle) is Root *bhU (sattAyAM) + s'atR* which yields

***bhavat* as the base** for the Masculine, and

*bhavantI* as the base for the Feminine, and

*bhavat, again,***as the base** for the Neuter.

  

The forms in the Nominative in this case are

*bhavan bhavantau bhavantaH* in the Masculine, and

*bhavantI bhavantyau bhavantyaH* in the Feminine, and

***bhavat** bhavatI bhavanti* in the Neuter.

(The forms in the other Cases are easy to guess, I suppose.).

  

4\. Thus *bhavat* is

\* (a) the base for the Pronoun (Masculine)

\* (b) the base for the Present Participle (Masculine)

\* (c) the base for the Present Participle (Neuter), and

  

\* (d) the Nominative Singular form of the Present Participle (Neuter); and even  

\* (e) the Vocative Singular form of the Present Participle (Neuter), and

\* (f) the Accusative Singular form of the Present Participle (Neuter)

  

5\. The confusion arises as neither dictionaries nor grammar books

present the above set of information in a single place.

  

Please correct me if I have erred somewhere.
