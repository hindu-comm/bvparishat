I have not studied this subject but a few months ago a prominent Telugu writer made the same allegation in a Telugu daily. I spoke to the writer (Mallepalli Lakshmaiah) to know

as to what his source was. He could not give any solid reply but referred to a stray remark in a book by Rhys Davids, who was an ICS officer turned Buddhist who was in Sri Lanka for a long time.Apart from such wild remark, there does not seem to be any historical evidence.

  

Surprisingly, Ambedkar, in his book 'Revolution and Counter-revolution in India' (Ch 5) writes categorically that it is the Islamic conquests which were a death knell for Buddhism and not

Hindu hostility. Several Buddhists fled to Tibet at that time to save their lives. The book, available on line, may be seen.
