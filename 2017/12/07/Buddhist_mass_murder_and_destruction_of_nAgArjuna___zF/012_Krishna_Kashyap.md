close communication with western scholars of today is needed to clarify things. One has to connect at the academic levels.

  

One organization in USA which is working on building chairs at various universities in USA is this DCF - Dharma Civilization Foundation. For those who are near southern California, there is an event today. 2 professors of Indologywill be presenting there.
