The so called Hindu violence on Buddhism and Buddhist violence on Hinduism are only fabricated by Western historians who had vested interest and who wanted to create a division among Indians. Who destroyed Nalanda? Who destroyed Somanathpur temple and thousands of other temples all over the country. True History speaks for itself. Why have they coined a term Brahminism? Does it mean apart from Brahmins there are no Hindus? Is Valmiki a Brahmin? Vyasa was born to a fisherwoman. There are hundreds of sages and great personalities who were not Brahmins. The Westerners deliberately use the term to divide Hindus. There was Vaidika darsana and Avaidika daarsana. Astika darsana and Nastika darsanas. There is no Brahminical darsana. All Indians must understand the dubious motives of the Western historians and desist from undermining our own culture.
