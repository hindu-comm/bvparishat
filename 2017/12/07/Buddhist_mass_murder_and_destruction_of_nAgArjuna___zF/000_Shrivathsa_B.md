hariH OM,

  

 Some hagiographical and mischievous stories about shrii sha\~NkarAcArya have gained so much currency that certain anti hindu forces have started using them for their evil ends.

  

 A great yati of our time wants to write a rebuttal to

1\. the story which says that sha\~NkarAcArya was the one responsible for the destruction of the buddhist monastery in nAgArjuna koNDa. It seems that those claiming this trace it to a remark by a british archaeologist and they further buttress it with some hagiographical stories.

2.the story of sha\~Nkarabeing a mass murderer of Buddhists. This again is traced to certain hagiographical stories.

  

 The spirit with which he wants to write a rebuttal is that if these stories aren't exposed for hollowness in time, they may turn out to be gospel truths in the future sociopolitical discourse.

  

 I request this pariShat to provide information about books available on:

1\. The history of the buddhist monastery in nAgArjuna koNDa, its time of existence, destruction etc.

2\. Any scholarly rebuttal of the story of sha\~Nkara being a mass murderer of Buddhists.



svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
