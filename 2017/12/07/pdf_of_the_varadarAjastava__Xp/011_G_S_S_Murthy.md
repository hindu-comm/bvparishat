I am sorry I could not respond to Mr Abhyankar's posting regarding my blog on Varadarajastava. I had converted my blogs into Docx and forgotten about it. After being reminded now, I ferreted it out from my disc and have converted into PDF which I have attached. Prof Klebanov may have a look at it for what it is worth.

Regards,

Murthy
