Dear Gopal jī,

  

Thank you very much for these two articles.

These are, in fact, exactly the articles, in which I encountered reference to *Appayyadīkṣitendravijaya*-. It seems to me that the author of the article “Vaishnava writings....” knows about the text also only via the reference in the article by Bronner (“Renaissance man...”).
