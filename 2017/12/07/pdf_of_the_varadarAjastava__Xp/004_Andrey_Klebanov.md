Respected Scholars,  
  
thank you very much for your instant help and for the many furthering remarks! It is extremely useful to me.  
  
Incidentally, I wonder if any member of the list may be aware of a text called अप्पयदीक्षितविजयः written by someone Śivānanda Yogī. So far, I have only seen references to this text in secondary literature, but never encountered the actual Sanskrit text.  
  
thanks once again for you invaluable help!  
  
Andrey
