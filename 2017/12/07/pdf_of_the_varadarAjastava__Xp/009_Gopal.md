Namaste,

  

glad to be of some use.

  

An esteemed member Sri Madhav Deshpande has an article on Dikshitar's student Bhattoji in the same journal. You may want to request him for any source material on this topic . I am attaching an article on dikshitar's life by his later day descendant published in 1928. The same gentleman had published a much cited piece in 1929 journal of oriental research that you may find useful. I cannot get that easily but someone who has worked on Dikshitar may be of help to you.

  

sincerely

..gopal gopinath
