Dear scholars,

  

may anyone possibly help me acquiring a soft copy of Appaya Dīkṣita’s Varadarājastava with the svavṛtti-? It seems that no library in my country keeps a copy of any edition of the text.[Here](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.496365)I found a digital version of one of the editions printed in Telugu script. I thought it was worth enquiring on the list before embarking on the study of Telugu. Thank you very much in advance!

  

best,

Andrey Klebanov
