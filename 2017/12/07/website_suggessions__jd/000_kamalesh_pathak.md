learned members,

since 15/16years i surfed plenty of sites to download sanskrit books and my collection was over 16 GB, unfortunately the entire hard disc is burbt and i can not recover any data, so i decided to re download all sanskrit pdf , so your references are requeted,

earlier i downloded vedas, up vedas, their brahmin, aranyaka, shiksha, shulba, grihya, shrauta, dharma, sutras, jyotish, ganitam, tantras, grammer books, upanishad commentories,strotras, 1000 names, kavach, and lot more, but all is gone, its a painful moment, 

link suggession will help me,

thanks in advance.

regards
