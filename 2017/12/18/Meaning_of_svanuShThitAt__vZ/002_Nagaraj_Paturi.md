What is well-practised here? Donkey's braying? or donkey's awakening of its owner? Donkey woke up its master successfully. That is well-practised. But that was what the dog was supposed to do: awakening the master. The donkey suffered. Paradharma turned out to be bhayaavahah for it.

Your looking / apparent seems to be coming from theश्रेयान स्वधर्मो विगुणः part. 'Svadharma, though is not good, leads to the practitioner's welfare or in other words does good to the practitioner.' is the direct meaning from the words. But how can BG call any svadharma 'not good'? So only when the meaning 'that looks to be not good', is taken for the word viguNah, , it matches the context. So svadharma, even if appears to be 'not good' to the practitioner to whom it is svadharma, when practised, leads to the welfare of the practitioner. It is better than paradharma, that is practised well.

What is welfare? It has aihika and aamushmika aspects. In the places/times where/when caste-system is practised, the village panchayat punishes a non-potter for making pots and punishes a potter for refusing to make pots. Logic? The village panchayat considers the non-potter's making of pots to be violating the exclusive right of the potter. But this right implies duty because if a potter to whom making pots has been given as exclusive right does not make pots, the village is deprived of pots. So when a potter refuses to make pots, he is punished. Securing livelihood, not getting punished by the village panchaayat are the aihika benefits.

  

In a system , allowing the system to function in the way it is organised by the society of the place and time keeping larger welfare in mind, is considered puNya-giving. That is aamushmika benefit.
