First of all let me thank bvp for creating an opportunity to interact such a scholar like you.  
I'm very glad with your response. In my earlier post I mentioned that I found that in some article. Infact that article was also mentioned the same thing as you said the quotation was told by him in historical linguistic view itself. I even mentioned this as "अत्र sound change पदेन सन्धिरपि स्वीकर्तुं शक्यत इति मन्ये". Can we? or cannot? Please guide me further.  
If cannot how can we trace sandhi (physically).
