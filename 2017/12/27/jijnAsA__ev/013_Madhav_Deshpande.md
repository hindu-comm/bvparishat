Dear Shri Rajeshwar Rao,

  

  You started your discussion by citing "sound change" as found in Leonard Bloomfield's book "Language". If you read that book carefully, you will notice that he is not talking about anything like sandhi, but more like sound change as part of historical development of languages and their dialects. Over long periods of time, languages change, and sometime it is possible to explain the "why" of some changes, other changes are difficult to explain, because the causation of sound change involves numerous possible factors, not all of which we have access to in the known historical record. This is what Bloomfield is talking about. The discussion of sound change in modern linguistics has progressed far beyond Bloomfield, and today we have better understanding of this phenomenon, but no understanding of history can be entirely complete, since many pieces of historical evidence are not available to us in the surviving record.
