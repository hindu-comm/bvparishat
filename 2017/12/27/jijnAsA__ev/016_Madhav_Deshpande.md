The notion of Sandhi as "sound change," though not included in Bloomfield's discussion, needs to be understood in a different way. The sandhi rules represent a portion of the derivational process, and as such are purely describing something like in the place of x, y occurs, in the environment z. As in all languages of the world, people speak with sandhis, and they actually do not take unsandhied separate words and then combine them. The Sanskrit grammarians, like the Pratiśākhyas and the Padapāṭha before them, take the analytical elements as derivationally prior, and by applying various rules to them, finally come up with utterances that are close to the actual spoken language.
This process is purely descriptive. Bhartr̥hari rightly says that the prakr̥ti-pratyaya divisions are all kalpita "theoretically constructed" and are not part of the real usage of language. So the sandhi rules describe sound change only as a theoretical descriptive process, and not any actual change. In Patañlali's terminology, this is only a buddhi-vipariṇāma. This is like deriving bhavatu from bhavati by replacing "i" with "u" by applying a rule like "eruḥ". In fact, it is not the case that any user of Sanskrit mentally derives the form bhavatu in this manner. The grammatical derivation is a useful explanatory process, but not a description of how the usage of language actually occurs. You may want to read W.S. Allen's book "Sandhi" for a modern linguistic understanding of the phenomenon of Sandhi. If you do not have access to it, I can probably send you a pdf. With best wishes,
