Respected Nagaraj Paturi sir,  
Thanks for your kind responses. Sometime ago I found above mentioned issue i.e causes of sound change are unknown in some article. Two more days before I found that biological or environmental states effects the sound change. I went back to sanskrit texts I could only get saNhita(in external sandhi case). Is there any other reason which effects sound change in our ancient texts.  
I have observed telugu balavyakaranamu a little. But I did not see your concerned treatment of that. I would be grateful if you share that link or publication details.  
Thanking you
