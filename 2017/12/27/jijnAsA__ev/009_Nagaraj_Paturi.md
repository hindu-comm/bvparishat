You are probably looking for a phonological /articulatory phonetic explanation for the morphophonemic changes occuring at samhitā.

  

yaṇādēśa is a good case to bring home the point.

  

That y, v, result from the samhitā of i + a/ā/u/ū//ē//ō/ai/ou, u+ a/ā/i//ī/ē//ō/ai/ou, is mentioned in descriptive rule.

  

That tālavyatā of i leads to the tālavya consonant y ōṣṭhyatā of u leads to the ōṣṭhya consonant v is a phonological /articulatory phonetic explanation for the morphophonemic change called yaṇādēśa sandhi.

हरिस् + शेते = हरिश्‍शेते ,

तत् + च = तच्‍च

सत् + चरित्र: = सच्‍चरित्र:

उत् + चारणम् = उच्‍चारणम्

सद् + जन: = सज्‍जन:

उद् + ज्‍वल: = उज्‍ज्‍वल:

  

etc,

  

That phonetic assimilation is happening isa phonological /articulatory phonetic explanation for the morphophonemic change covered by s'chutva sandhi rule occurring in these examples.
