Panini's work is descriptive and not a historical one.

  

In other words, Panini's work tells you what happened and to discuss why it so happened is not within the scope of his work.

  

In Telugu scholarly circles, during modern period, a similar discussion cropped up.

  

Chinnaya Suri's Bala Vyakaranamu does the equivalent of Panini's work to a significant corpus of classical Telugu.

  

A scholar by name Korada Ramakrishnaiah came up with a book by name "Sandhi" , in which he gives a historical treatment to all the Sandhi morphophonemic changes covered by the Sandhi Paricchedamu , the chapter on Sandhi in Balavyakaranamu.

  

Some people started thinking /writing that Chinnaya Suri failed to give this understanding or was ignorant of this understanding. Some of these were in high academic positions too. What their academic training or their own reception of that training did not help them understand is that a synchronic , descriptive work is not interested in or does not focus on such diachronic , historical understanding of phenomena.
