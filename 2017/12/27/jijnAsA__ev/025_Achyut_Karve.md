Dear Deshpandeji,

  

I am presently engaged in drawing out the padas of Tabla Compositions.
As said by you 'Bhartr̥hari rightly says that the prakr̥ti-pratyaya divisions are all kalpita "theoretically constructed" and are not part of the real usage of language.' Though this a theoretical process it is helpful to protect and preserve the aesthetics of a language for future generations, especially when such a language is no more a spoken language or is in the process of waining out.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
