IIT Kanpur has develped a website on our treasures of Vedas, Shastras etc.

  

Check it out:<https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/>

  

No issue of language as IITK smartly put each shloka in various languages. Most amazingly, commentary on each shloka by various scholars has also been provided. Good use of technology.
