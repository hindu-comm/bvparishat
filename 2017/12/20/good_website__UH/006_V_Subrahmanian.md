This site started off some ten years ago with the Bhagavadgita resources. Over the years they have added many other texts. The name continues unchanged. There is the Valmiki Ramayana, the Ramacharitamanas, various other Gita-s, etc. 

  

As far as one can see, excepting the Brahma sutra-s section, which has the Shankara commentary thereon, all other sections in that site are not any advaita-exclusive. For example under the Bhagavadgita section, one can see the following commentaries, sub-commentaries and translations.
The site has been very useful for various types of users. For example, one can make a comparative study of the bhashyas of various schools for any given shloka on one page itself. Of course, there are many errors such as spelling, typographic, omissions, etc. which require a thorough corrective exercise:

Maybe if someone helps them uploading commentaries of Sri Raghavendra Tirtha, and other bhashyas for the Brahma sutras, etc. they too will be added. The effort is a voluntary one, coming from faculties and students of IIT- Kanpur.
