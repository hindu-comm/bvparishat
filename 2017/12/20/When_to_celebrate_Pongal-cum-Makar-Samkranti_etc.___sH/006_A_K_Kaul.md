Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your response.

Yes! You are right! The Indian calendar is Luni-solar combined and that is what I am trying to portray through all these mails and articles!

The overall gamut of the Vedic, Pauranic and siddhantic solar year is that it is a seasonal year, which is known as a tropical year as per modern astronomy!

That is why the Vedas, the Vedangas, the Puranas, epics and even the siddhantas have said that a year comprises two Ayanas, six ritus, twelve solar and lunar months and sometimes there are even thirteen lunar months.

Example is better than precept!

The Bhagvadgita 8/24-25 has said

> 
> > 
> > अग्निर्ज्योतिरहः शुक्लःषण्मासा उत्तरायाणम् \| तत्र प्रयाता > गच्छन्ति ब्रह्म ब्रह्मविदो जनाः \|\|
> > 
> > 

 

धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्णः षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम् \| तत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिर्योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते \|\|



"Those who have realized the Brahma

n,



when they pass away during the period presided over by agni, day time, the bright lunar half and the six months of Uttarayana, they attain Para Brahman





(and do not return to this mundane world again

). ( On the other hand) those (yogis) who pass away during the six months of Dakshinayana, dark lunar half and night time, they attain to the abode presided over by the lunar deities and then return to the mundane world again"

  

Here the references are to the two ayanas of six months each of Uttarayana and Dakshinaya. These six months are obviously seasonal solar months. In these very solar months, the two halves of six lunar months each viz. the bright lunar half and the dark lunar half have been subsumed!

That means obviously, the lunar months are not much away from solar seasonal months!

And that is the real irony these days!

The Rashtriya Punchanga tells us that the month of Madhava starts on the day of Vernal Equinox whereas at the same time it clubs it with Chaitra instead of Vaishakha! This is against the injunctions, in fact the letter and spirit, of all the Vedangas, Puranas and even the siddhantas and that is why we are celebrating Vasanti Navratras when more than a month of the Vasanta Ritu is already over and so on!

This will be clear from the attachment "Vishuva=Mesha" from the Vishnudharmottara-Purana, which has profusely been quoted by Aadi
Shankara in his works!

It has said unambiguously

चैत्रो मधुरीति स्मृतः वैशाखो माधवः प्रोक्तः , शुचिर् ज्येष्ठ उदाहृतः i.e. Chaitra is a synonym of Madhu, Madhava is asynonym of Vaishakha and so on. At the same time it has reiterated what all the other shastras are crying from housetops

तुलामेष गते भानौ विषुवद्दिनमुच्य्ते \|\|धन्वन्तो मिथुनान्तश्च अयने सौम्यदक्षिणे

''When the sun enters Mesha and Tula, those are the days of (Vernal and Autumn) Equinoxes (respectively). The end of Dhanurmas is the start of Uttarayana and the end of Mithuna Rashi is the start of dakshinayana!"

Thus it leaves no doubt in anybody's mind that whether it is Pongal or Vasanti Navratra or Sharadiya-Navraatra or any other solar or lunar festival, we are not celebrating any of them as ordained by the shastras but only as per the whims and fancies of some vested interests!

We must certainly take up cudgels against the same, without any further delay!

शुभस्य शीघ्रम्

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
