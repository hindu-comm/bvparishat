Dear Shree A K Kaul, Thanks for reply. But you did not catch my point of Indian calendar being combined luni-solar calendar. Although the sun enters the rashi of Capricorn (Makara) on Dec 21, Indians wait until the moon also enters Makar Rashi. This adjustment is little precarious. This year entry of the moon in Makar rashi was actually Jan15-16 and (not on Jan 14). The same logic of luni-solar calendar is behind all other festivals such as Yugaadi, Deepavali New year. This combined luni-solar calendar (with extra month after two and half years) was followed throughout the middle-east and India in the ancient time. Jewish people follow even today this combined luni-solar calendar but their method of adding extra month is different from that of Indians. So one year Yom kippur and Hindu Dasarafall on the same day and next year one month apart. Arabs were following this calendar until the prophet of Islam changed it to hundred percent lunar calendar. The effect was unbearable to Arabs because according to old luni-solar calendar Ramadhan (fasting month) used to come in winter (when days are short) and nowit gradually started moving backwards and started falling in the summer months(when days are longer). Arabs complained to the prophet but he insisted on lunar calendar. Why?

There are many other scholars on this list. Please help me to correct myself if I were wrong in my understanding of our Hindu calendar.

Thanks. N. R. Joshi
