Dear Shri Kaul,

  

The whole Nirayana vs Sayana argument is based on whether there is any significance attached the Nakshatras in the zodiac. There is ample evidence in the Vedic literature to show the significance of nakShatras too, apart from seasons as you mention. The Sayana system considers only the seasons and downplays the significance of nakShatras. For example, is it correct to fix the vernal equinox as the starting point of ashvini nakShatra in Mesha Rashi or the day when the day and night are of equal duration? In the past, the answer to such questions may not have been so relevant, since the magnitude of the precession of equinoxes a.k.a ayanAmsha was not large.

  

Anand
