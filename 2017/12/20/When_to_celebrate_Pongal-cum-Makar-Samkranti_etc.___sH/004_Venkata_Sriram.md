Interesting observation Kaul-ji.

  

However, adding more confusion to the 'already existing confusion'.
This year there was confusion whether sankramaNa was on 14th or 15th.
Kanchi Mutt's opinion was on 14th and Sringeri Mutt's opinion was on 15th.

  

There was a proposal on behalf of Telangana govt. that a common panchAnga would be drafted by placing all the siddhAntis on a common platform and taking their opinions and resolving calculation issues.

  

rgs,

sriram
