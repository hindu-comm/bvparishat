Dear Shri Narayan Joshiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Glad to receive your feedback since unless we exchange views in a dispassionate manner, we cannot arrive at the Truth.

First of all let me assure you that you are not wrong in your assessment of Hindu calendar since it certainly is luni-solar as you have aptly put it!

In my article that has appeared in the

<http://www.pragyata.com/mag/when-should-pongalmakar-samkranti-be-celebrated-and-why-434>.  

I had requested at the end to visit

<http://reformedsanathancalendar.in/calendar.html>  

to get a fair idea of as to what I was talking about!

You can download the complete Tamil/English version of the "Reformed Sanathan Calendar" from there which is just a labour of love by a Tamilian gentleman Shri T V Sivaraman. As an alternative you can download the Hindi version viz. "SMKAP" edited by Shri Darshaney Lokesh! You can even download both the versions!

A sample page of the Vedic month Tapas is attached. It started from December 22, 2017, the day of real Pongal as the sun had entered (so called) sayana Makar Rashi on December 21, 2017 at 21hrs 58 mts. IST.

You will find all the details of lunar month like "lunar Pausha-Magha", Tamil "Tai" and so on. You will also find details regarding the tithi that was prevailing like Panchami up to 24.25 , and Dhanishtha
nakshatra of the relevant "name-sake" star from 19.19 and so on.

I am also attaching, for the sake of comparison, the page for December 2017 of the Rashtriya Panchanga. On top of it, we find the claim "Vedic Tapas" and within brackets "Makara" which means it is the month of Makara Rashi as per the Vedas! Rashtirya Panchanga has not written anywhere there that it is the month of Sayana Makara, but ironically, it claims simultaneously that it is the month of (solar) Pausha, when actually it is the real (solar) Magha as per all the Puranas, siddhantas and even the Vedanga Jyotisham!

Prior to that the same RP has said, "Sun enters Tropical Capricornus h. 21-58" and since it has clubbed the same "tropical Capricornus" with the Vedic month Makara, it is clear that in the heart of hearts, it believes the tropical phenomena to be the real Vedic phenomena!

In the same breath, the same Rashtriya Panchanga page tells us that the sun is in Dhanus and it will enter Makara on January 14, 2018, when nirayana Magha will begin!  

Don't you think it a bit confusing as to what to believe and what not to believe!

Regarding Adhika-masa, if you peruse the page of the RSC for the month of "Simha" (July23-August 22) you will see it is for the month of Bhadrapada Purushottama" whereas the page for "Kanya" says that that was the month of Bhadrapada-Shudha!

It was an adhika-masa since there were two New Moons (Amanta) between the two solar (so called) Sayana Samkrantis of Simha and Kanya!

So kindly rest assured that we have tried to follow the injunctions of scriptures both in letter and spirit to the extent humanly possible!

Regarding the Islamic calendar being just a lunar (synodic) one, it is said that because of the uncertainty about the dates of adhika-masa in case of luni-solar calendar, the pilgrims had sometimes to wait for a whole month till the Adhika-masa was over as it was supposed to be an inauspicious period for such a pilgrimage as "Haj"! It was because of that reason that a luni-solar type of calendar was dropped there!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
