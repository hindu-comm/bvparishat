Dear Shri Veeraraghavanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your response. There has been delay in answering your mail as there was (and still is!) some problem with the system (computer). However, better late than never!

Later on, the Saha Calendar Reform Committee, set up by the GOI in 1954, had said on page 260 of its Report, "In continuing to follow the*nirayana*

**

**system,**the Hindu calendar makers are under the impression that they are following the path of*Dharma.*They are actually committing the whole Hindu society to*Adharma."*

The present Shankaracharya of Joshi Mutt and Dwarka H H Swami Swaroopnanad Saraswati has advised to strictly follow the same tradition of Dwarka Mutt of 1893 AD.

Similarly, His Holiness Swami Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti has also encouraged the use of Sayana Panchangas.

Besides, there are several other Swamijis of different Mutts etc. who are recognizing as to how we are following a wrong tradition these days.  

All these details are available on

[www.reformedsanathancalendar.in](http://www.reformedsanathancalendar.in)

  

At the same time, it is the bounden duty of every scholar of this august forum and other forums to bring all these anachronisms to the notice of a common man.



VVR://If Dec 21/22 was the time Sankranti was celebrated, are you able from your research to tell us when and where in history this practice got distorted?

  

AKK://There is an in built error in the Surya Siddhanta, both old and the current one!

Its calculations yield mean longitudes which are neither so called saayana nor so called niraayana, whatever ayanamsha we may use!

This error was negligible around Shaka 444 i.e. 522 AD. After that year it went on increasing approximately by about one arc minute per year with the result that within a couple of centuries from 522 AD, the calculated samkrantis of the sun started taking place later by about 3 days from the actual dates when those samkrantis should have been celebrated. Since the SS had advised in 3/11 that the calculated longitudes must tally with the observed positions, maybe the astronomers of those days made those adjustments which became known as beeja corrections.

Same is the case with the longitudes of Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata of 490 AD, who was a contemporary of Varahamihira!

Thus by 10th century AD, this difference in the solar longitudes had increased by about seven degrees/days! Munjal the astronomer recognized it and advised in his Laghumanasa 1/5 to increase the longitudes of sun

, moon and planets by one arc minute per year from Shaka 444.
Accordingly, he advised to increase it 

by 6° 50' f

or

the Mesha Samkranti

 (Vishuva/Vernal Equinox)

of the sun

 and planets

of 932 AD to make them tally with the observed positions known as "drik

-

tulya".

***Historical proofs of the above:***

Alberuni was in India in 1030 AD and he has appreciated this gesture of "Punjala" (Munjal!) in no uncertain terms on page 367 of "Alberuni's
India":

  

Quote

"Hindus found out that the real solstice precedes the solstice of their calculations. For Punjala the author of 'Small Manasa' (Laghumanasa) says that in the year 854 of Shaka-kala the real solstice preceded his calculation by 6° 50' and that this difference will increase in future by one minute every year....

"These are the words of a man who either was himself a most careful practical observer, or who examined the observations of former astronomers which he had at his disposal, and thereby found out the amount of the annual difference. No doubt, also other people have perceived the same or a similar difference by means of the calculation of the noon-shadows. Therefore Utpala of Kashmir has taken this theory from Punjala"

Unquote

  

Similarly, as late as 12th century AD, Bhaskarachaarya-II has said in his Siddhanta Shiromani 1/19  

रवेश्चक्रभोगो अर्कवर्षं प्रदिष्टं द्युरात्रं च देवासुराणां तदेव\| रवीन्दुयोर्युतेः संयुतिर्यावदन्या विधोर्मास एतच्च पितरं द्युरात्रं\|\|

Bhaskaracharya's own commentary "Vasana Bhashya" has explained the meaning thus

रविर्यावता कालेन पूर्वगत्या मेषादिभचक्रं भ्रमति तावत्प्रमाणं रविवर्षं प्रदिष्टं\| ...

द्युरात्रं च

 देवासुराणां तदेवेति\| यदर्कवर्षं तदेव देवानां दैत्यानां च द्युरात्रमहोरात्रम् \|\|

  

"The time taken by the sun to complete one revolution of the Rashichakra starting from Mesha, is known as a solar year. It is said to be a day and night of the gods. Similarly, the time taken by the conjunction of the moon with the sun till such next conjunction is known as a lunar month. It is said to be a day and night of the manes."

That is exactly what the Surya Siddhanta, Aryabhata, Lalla-Tajntra, Siddhanta-Shekhara and Bhaskaracharya-II etc. etc. have said meaning that the solar year is seasonal i.e. tropical!

Bhaskara-II has said further

क्रियतुलाधरसंक्रमपूर्वतो अयनलवोत्थदिनैर्विषुवद्दिनम् \| मकरकर्कटसंक्रमतो अयनं द्युदलभा विषुवद्दिवसे अक्षभा\|\| 2/46

The days of entrance of the sun into Mesha and Tula are known as Vishuvad days wheres the days of Makara and Karkata Samkrantis are known as Ayana days (Samkrantis).

Again Vasna Bhashya says

वर्षायनर्तु युगपूर्वकमत्र सौरान्मासास्तथा च तिथयस्तुहिनांशुमानात्

A solar year comprises ayanas, seasons and months whereas lunar month is determined by tithis.

As late as Shaka 1543 i.e, 1621 AD Nrisimha Daivagya, while commenting on the same shloka has confirmed in his Vaartika

वर्षः वत्सरः वसतो अयने यस्मिन् स वत्सरः \|\|यातीत्ययनं राशिषटकेन दक्षिनाशामुत्तराशाम् वेति \|\| इयत्तिं गछत्यसाधारणं लिङ्गमिति ऋतुः \|\|

"Varshah=vatsarah. Where the (two) ayanas reside, (that period) is known as Vatsarah. The two Ayanas, Dakshina and Uttara comprises six rashis each."

Thus it i s clear that at least till about 17th century, we were celebrating Makar Samkranti on the shortest day of the year and so on!

***

***Grahalaghava/Makaranda switched over to "niraayana"***

"Grahalaghava" and "Makaranda" karna-granthas (simplified mathematical works for calculating panchangas) came into existence around 16th century. It appears that these works without going deeper into the astronomical principles of the Surya Siddhanta or Aryabhata or Brahma Gupta or Munjala or Lalla or Shripati, least of all Bhaskaracharya-II etc. that Makar Samkranti was the shortest day of the year and so on, prepared simplified mathematical formula/tables which yield mean longitudes of planets much akin to that of the Surya Siddhanta or Aryabhatiya etc but which are totally against the letter and spirit of those very astronomical works which these two books were supposed to simplify!

That is how this nirayana versus Sayana came into existence!  

***  
***

***Nirayana longitudes are used only for making predictions:***

Ironically, Ganesha Daivagya through his Grahalaghava 3/17 advised exactly the same method of calculating Ayanamsha as Munjal i.e. one arc-minute per year from Shaka 444. It is to be used to make the Grahalaghava longitudes "sayana" for calculating sunrise/sunset, lagna and declination etc. of the sun, moon and planets because all such calculations are done by tropical longitudes!

In other words, except for making predictions, nirayana longitudes are hardly of any use!

Ironically, this very or similar ayanamshas have been used for calculating nirayana longitudes from the tropical longitudes of planets as obtained from Overseas Observatories to make them niraayana, i.e. to make correct longitudes incorrect, whereas Munjal had advised to make incorrect longitudes correct by adding the ayanamsha!  

  

***N. C. Lahiri invented "Lahiri/Chitra" Ayanamsha:***

Then in early 1940s, with so many panchangas being spawned from Makaranda, Grahalghava, Sarvananda Karna and such other works, late N C Lahiri devised an "Ayanamsha" nearer to that of Grahalaghava, so that the Samkrantis that were being celebrated as per those Panchangas did not get disturbed! It is known as Lahiri Ayanamsha, and later the GOI
succumbed to the same Aaynamsha and that is why it is following Lahiri Ayanamsha especially since the late N C Lahiri was the Secretary of the "Saha Calendar Reform Committee" in 1954 AD. The same Calendar Reform Committee had warned though that by celebrating festivals etc. as per niraayana Rashichakra, they were advising gross Adharma!

  

***We must stop such Adharma immediately otherwise the consequences will be disastrous:***  

Now it is up to the present scholars to take up cudgels against such Adharma in one voice and start celebrating all the festivals and muhurtas on correct days!

If we do not do so at the earliest, I must put on record as to what the consequences will be

The Gita 16/23 has said unequivocally:

यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः \| न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम् \|\|

"One who acts willfully against the injunctions of shastras, he/she does not attain success, nor happiness least of all Moksha"

Celebrating Makar Samkranti on any other day than the shortest day of the year is certainly a willful disrespect towards our Puranas and other shastras!
