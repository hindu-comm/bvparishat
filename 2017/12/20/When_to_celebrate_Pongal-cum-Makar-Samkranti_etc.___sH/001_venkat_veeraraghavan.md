Dear Shri Kaul ji,

  

Thank you for your revolutionary ideas.

You present a very cohesive argument.

  

Can you also explain why we are celebrating the wrong sankranti when we have so many scholars, muttas who profess to be in the business of protecting dharma?

  

If Dec 21/22 was the time Sankranti was celebrated, are you able from your research to tell us when and where in history this practise got distorted?

  

Many thanks,

  

Venkat
