Dear Shri Sriramji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Sriram:\\However, adding more confusion to the 'already existing confusion'

AKK:\\\\Our scriptures are very clear about such situations! The Gita 17/24 has said

तस्माच्छास्त्रम् प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ \|\|ज्ञात्वा शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि \|\|

"

Therefore, the scripture alone is your guide

 

in determining what should be done and what

should not be done. Knowing this, you ought

 

to perform only such action as is ordained by

the scriptures.

"

Since there is absolutely no scripture, I repeat absolutely no scripture, whether Purana or Smriti or epic and so on that has said that Makar Samkranti is any other day than the shortest day of the year or Karkata Samkranti any other day than the longest day of the year or Mesha Samkranti any other day than the day of Vernal Equinox or Tula Smkranti any other day than the day of Autumn Equinox, I do not think there should be any confusion as to when to celebrate Pongal and observe Dhanurmas/Kharmnas and so on!

It is, therefore, a humble request to scholars like you to try to put the records straight!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
