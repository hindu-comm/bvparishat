नमस्ते श्रीमन् हर्ष-महोदय !

Converting image files into texts will be a great effort especially for converting manuscripts (manuscript = whatever is scripted manually).

  

I think it has to be done by replicating the strokes than letter by letter.

Both in Devanagari and Kannada, a conjoint letter like त्त has different strokes for the first त् and the second त

-   In Devanagari the first त् is a small horizontal stroke. -   In Kannada one of the two त-s is horizontal stroke with a knot.

In Kannada in a letter like त्य, the य which comes in second place has a different stroke thanthe letter य itself.
