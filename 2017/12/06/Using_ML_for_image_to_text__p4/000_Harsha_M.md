Dear Experts,

  

Has anybody tried to use ML to convert vernacular text in a scanned image to unicode text, especially sanskrit/kannada. Upon search I found that CCA algorithm can be used to extract letters from text in image form, but it may not work with Devanagari as the letters will be joined together to form a word.On the contrary in kannada, a single conjugate letter (ottakshara) might be disjointed .

  

I want to do it as a hobby project. Any inputs are welcome.

  

Regards,

Harsha
