Namaste

1. Thanks to scholars who have taken great pains to deliberate on this issue. I place below the summary as I understand of this discussion, and request scholars review of the same. This summary may help the social users of Sanskrit in conversation to keep to the 'Shista prayoga standards.

 With all this scholarly input, we may need a second look at understanding to understand the intended meaning of Gita usage \< अपरं **भवतो** जन्म परं जन्म विवस्वत: । कथमेतद् विजानीयां **त्वमा**दौ प्रोक्तवानिति \> ? \> ?

 And I am still not sure whether this has resolved the starting question raised on this post \< Could this be an indication of the distinction that originally existed between the use of bhavat and the use of yuṣmad?\> by Profesor Aklujkar.

2. It Seems there is some convergence of position on (a) the use of bhavat and the use of yuṣmad (b) the multiple dimensions of deriving 'bhavat' from the dhatu with different pratyayas (c) The translation or
approach to unfold the 'vivkashaa = speakers intention ( vaktuH
atishayena vaktum, Ipsitatamam Karma)' which cannot be vitiated by the fancy constructions and compilations of usage across different segments of texts and time periods.

 \< **1.****So , by and large , we may conclude --****** **1.** **भवति** **भिक्षां** **देहि**** is acceptable (****मनुस्मृत्यनुरोधेन** **प्रयोगबाहुल्याच्च** **) or it can be** **भवति** **! (****त्वम्****)** **भिक्षां** **देहि** **।**

******** **भवति** **=** **पूज्ये** **(** **पूज्यार्थे****** **** **तत्र** **भवान्** **,** **तत्र** **भवती** **etc are acceptable to Panini et al )**

**** **2.** **If there are** **शिष्टप्रयोगाः** **then one may employ** **मध्यमपुरुष** **with** **भवच्छब्द** **- '** **पृषोदरादीनि** **...’** **।** **\>**

3. But this is neither the final say or end of the exploration. There can be more to explore from the perspective of cross linguistic debate on how Greek and Latin, German and French, provide rules to express such simple thoughts in ritual and social request-conversations. Would ‘bhavan or tvam end up as a default second term in the prayer like ‘ dehi mE kRupayA (prabho- tvam – bhavaan –bhavatee)’ where the user left to infer the connecting term. Again getting back to \<Shishta-prayoga>, later \< Nootana - Shishtas \> may shape the future usage; but \< puraana/ Poorva –prayoga\> needs to stay in the ambit of rules by which the expressions were regulated. Does it mean there is a criticality to rethink on the other question \< ke te Shihstaah> ? Patanjali’s criterion in Mahabhashya would certainly chop off almost every modern Sanskrit linguist and indologists ( including Grimm), whom current academic scholarship takes as inviolable authority !

4. Consolidating the discussions:

***(******4******a) the use of bhavat and the use of yu******ṣ******mad******* ****

****

- (**Rishi Goswami**) First of all let us know one thing that युष्मद् is सम्बोधनैकपर । That means युष्मद् is only used when someone is addressed.

- (**Rishi Goswami**) Bhavatu has Yushmadarth-pratiti. But it is not Yushmadarth. It has a pratiti.

***(******4******b)*** ***Professor Korada :****** the multiple dimensions of deriving 'bhavat' from the dhatu with different pratyayas*************

-**** भवतु is in सर्वादिगण -- under उगिदचां सर्वनामस्थाने’धातोः 7-1-70 and is connected with root- भातेर्डवतुः , 1-65 उणादिः , भातीति भवान् ). भवतीति । सर्वादिषु भवतु इत्युदित्पठितो भातेर्डवतुरिति व्युत्पादितश्च । शत्रन्तात्तु ङीपि शप्श्यमोर्नुम् इति नित्यो नुम्।



- The provisions under 'ugit' gives two routes - उगित् द्विविधं प्रातिपदिकं प्रत्ययश्च to derive the form भवतु .

o The pratipadika route is - तत्र प्रातिपदिकमुदाहरति - भवतीति । सर्वदिगणे भवतु इति अत्युत्पन्नं प्रातिपदिकं पठितं तस्य व्यपदेशिवत्त्वेन उगिदन्तत्वात् ङीप्

o The pratyaya route is यदि तु सर्वादिगणे पठितं भवतु इत्येतत् ’ भातेर्डवतुः ’ इति व्युत्पाद्यते तदा उगित्प्रत्ययान्तस्यैव उदाहरणं बोध्यम् । भूधतोः शतरि .... भवच्छब्दात् ङीपि तु .... भवन्तीति रूपम् ।



- Madhviya Dhatu vrutti states connects भवतु to (भू सत्तायाम् ) and states -(भू सत्तायाम् ) --- अलिङ्गः संबोधनैकविषयश्च युष्मदर्थः , भवदर्थस्तु अन्यः इति तद्योगे प्रथमः । यदा तु अस्मात् संबोधनविभक्तिः तदा युष्मदर्थयोगात् मध्यमो भवति - हे भवन् भवसि इति ।



- Haradatta introduces the additional dimension of ‘**upa****-****pada' technicality**. What is ' upa-pada' ? It is a a term which is not having the 'ting' affix related process and is used in the sentence. ( Definition of Upa-pada : Panini - 2\\.2\\.19 upapadamati\~N .) The sentence under debate is ‘ bhavati bhikshaam dehi’. Should the term 'dehi' be treated as ' ating' in the given sentence for construction with ‘ bhavati’ to mean ‘ Respected Lady, you please give me the alms’ - ' bhavati bhikshaam dehi' - is expanding the scope of this already complex discussion.

 Under the sutra (2-2-19), at Balamanorama, an example is discussed to focus on **compounding technicalities attracted under** **upa****-****pada******** rule and** **what it** **does to the communication**. The extract reads **\<** **मा** **भवान्भूदिति**। अत्र भूदिति तिङन्तेन माङः समासनिवृत्त्यर्थमतिङ्ग्रहणमिति भावः। भवानिति पदं तु समासाऽभावसूचनाय मध्ये प्रयुक्तम्। ननु माङस्तृतीयधात्वधिकारे सप्तमीनिर्दिष्टत्वं तु अदृष्टं येन तस्य उपपदत्वात्समासः प्रसज्यत इत्यत आह--माङिति। ननु अतिङ्ग्रहणं व्यर्थं, मा भवान्भूदित्यत्र सुपेत्यनुवृत्त्यैव समासनिवृत्तिसंभवादित्यत आह--अतिङ्ग्रहणमिति। एवंच उपपदमसुबन्तेन समस्यत इति फलितम्। \> -

[*https://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/vyakhya/2/2.2.19.htm*](https://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/vyakhya/2/2.2.19.htm) This section brings out the ‘ samaasa (compounding technicalities involved and related debate in connection with bhavaan ! adding more complexities in looking at the given sentence \< bhavati bhikshaam dehi\> as a three term sentence or a two term sentence!

- Haradatta does not accept Madhaviya Dhatu vrutti opinion and introduces a different technicality and concept of 'upa-pada' and 'gamyamaane' (=if it is intended meaning is being understood in the communication), to present his dissent.

- Mahabhashya discussions present a class model of communication \< महाभाष्यम् --- भवदादिभिर्योगे इति वक्तव्यम् । के पुनर्भवदादयः? भवान् ,...स भवान् , तत्र भवान् , ततो भवान् .\> ****** ****

****

**(****4****c ) The translation or rather approach to unfold the 'vivkashaa = speakers intention ( vaktuH atishayena vaktum, Ipsitatamam Karma)'** **in the usage** **‘** **bhavti bhikshaam dehi** There is a set of traditional guidelines which cannot be vitiated by the fancy constructions and compilations of usage across different segments of texts and time periods.) I place my thoughts in the future directions for this debate to evolve. It is worth a deep contemplation why a eight years boy would be trained to use the ‘alms request to a household lady’ and use ‘Samskruth with precision of grammar and accent’ ? While ‘bhavati bhikshaam dehi’ has a respectable austere communication and call for a ‘ bhikshaa daanam’ as a ‘ duty of the house hold; but when the same is used in vernacular, yields a sense of ‘begging food’ ! Why Brahmins insist on mechanical repletion of the ‘ritual’ without understanding the utility and significance of the directive? And what could have been the vernacular models of request for alms by the ‘bhikkus and Samana’s’, ‘Saadhus and Sharanas’ ? which carry the same essence of communication ? That is to highlight the Samskruth and Vernacular connection in society.

And ably deliberated by R.G.Bhandarkar in the Wilson Philological Lectures on Sanskrit and the derived Languages delivered in 1877. Source:

***My additional notes*** : One needs to be careful in the Samskruth Word writing.

 The Romanization of Devanagari script has provided the advantage of using computers for Samskruth discussions and formation of special discipline like 'Sanskrit Computational Linguistics'. All this has come at a heavy penalty of

- (i) 'Silencing the VOICE ( Uccharana aspect) of Samskruth

- (ii) Dismemberment of the 'Swara- Maatra'in writing Samskruth terms and

- (iii) Creating a Superstructure called 'Sanskrit Research built on partial data'.

‘ Bhavati bhikshaam dehi’ is the classic example which has shown details to substantiate all these points. For the given form ' bhavat', traditional texts show many ways to derive it from root, using a pratyaya or no pratyaya, with a swara or no swara, meaning construction when the term gets aligned to another pratipadika/ sarvanama/ dhatu/ upapada in the sentence, poetic license of usage, social usage, ritual usage and 'Shaastra (Shista) prayoga. And all this become ‘ insensitive’ in current Sanskrit teaching and usage !

 It would be an interesting exercise to reverse the gaze and audit the post colonial writings and research on Samskruth works (especially Veda related, primarily in India and abroad) using the genre of texts and tools of Samskruth Language grammar (= Vedanga Vyakarana as a part of Shadanga Veda -Adhyayana - Samshodhana Sampradaya) to see how much distanced are we from the source tradition.

 History locked persons may not worry about this issue, for such research is only of academic interest and 'heavenly benefit' (=Svarge loke Kaama -dhuk bhavati?!)

 What about the society which claims to live by the Vedic Injunctions by interpreting and practicing the vedic texts for the Culture, Identity and Utility ?

 Probably this could be a strong enough reason and justification to explain the motion called Battle: Sanskrit .

 On the top of all this comes the 'Language Modeling issue', which is called 'How to Model and Study the Language of the Transcendent ( Apaurusheya Bhashaa), the Consciousness ( Braahmi/Sarasvati/ Bharati- Chaitnaya Bhashaa) , the Cosmos ( Prakruti Bhashaa), the Divinities (Deva-Bhashaa)' ! for which 'Yoga' alone is the recourse. That is yoga-Samskrutham: Yoga way of studying Samskrutham, the long last tradition called Vak-Yoga.

 This debate has served as a small pointer to highlight the need to explore ‘Vak-Yoga’ as the original name of Samskrutham.
