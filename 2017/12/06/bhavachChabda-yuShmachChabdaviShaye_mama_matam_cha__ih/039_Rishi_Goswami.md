Maananeeya Ks kannan ji.  
Thankyou very much for the answer above. Im greatful but I have a doubt.  
If Bhavatu is Ugitlakshan Gneep it is read in Gauradigan for Niyamaarth By "Siddhe sati......." Nyaay. You said that Bhavatu is pratipadik. Do you mean it is Avyutpanna? If it is Avyutpanna why will there be a need of Ugitlakshan Gneep? Cant we just say that the Gneep is for Pratyay/Davatukrit Shabd Bhavatu and Gauradipath is for the Pratipadik Avyutpanna Shabd Bhavatu?  
  
Im a bit confused. Which Bhavatu is to be taken in the example, "Bhavati bhiksham dehi." ?  
Haraye namah.  
Namaskar.
