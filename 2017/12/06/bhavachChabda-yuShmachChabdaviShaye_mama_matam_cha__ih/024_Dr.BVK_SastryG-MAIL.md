Namaste

  

The discussion is becoming intricate and interesting ! The trigger
point for discussion was  \< Professor Aklujkar: Could this be an indication of the distinction that **originally existed** between the **use of bhavat and the use of yu****ṣ****mad?** I will think about the possibility. \>

I place below the views exchanged so far. The issue seems unresolved on ‘**Shista-Prayoga****’** **of** **‘** **Bhavat****’** . The social
language / Prakrut /Desi usage is not the norm for judging the standard usage in Kavya, Darshana and Guidelines provided by Grammarian.

*** Points to*** ***contemplate*** ***being*** : Did Panini – Patanjali miss some of the niceties of usage from Valmiki and Vyasa (Gita) ? ***OR*** Did a different set of rules govern the earlier usages ? ***OR***  There is something missing in understanding the
usage of ‘ Bhavat’ used in current conversational Sanskrit with fair amount of looseness ? A carry forward issue from earlier usages ?
How then would translate and explain ‘ he bhavaan / bhavatee/ bhavantaH’ ?

A) \< Rishi Goswami - Sent: Thursday, 7 December, 2017 6:27 PM \>
**-** **It is quite evident that** **Bhavat shabd can be substituted with Yushmad whenever wished with no compulsions associated with its usage**. …. Over here we can clearly see that **Bhavat can totally replace Yushmad, even though used in third person**. It does not matter where the person is, Pratyaksh air Apratyaksh. It is a total representative of Yushmad and also can be switched from Bhavat to Yushmad in the same shlok referring to the same person as mentioned in The Gita.

B) Professor Korada : Some scholars hold that **in all the places of** **मध्यमपुरुष** **it is** **संबोधनार्थ** **only** . Also all the forms of युष्मच्छब्दप्रथमाविभक्ति denote संबोधनम् only -- संबोधनार्थः सर्वत्र मध्यमे कैश्चिदिष्यते । तथा संबोधने सर्वां प्रथमां युष्मदो विदुः ॥ तदेव 
…. **भवच्छब्द** **cannot be used in** **संबोधनम्** **and also it has got** **लिङ्गम्** **(** **अलिङ्गे** **युष्मदस्मदी****) and as such it cannot be a substitute to** **युष्मच्छब्द****** **and hence cannot get** **मध्यमपुरुष** **--** **** तदेवं भवच्छब्दस्य असंबोधनविषयत्वात् लिङ्गवत्त्वाच्च अयुष्मदर्थत्वात् मध्यमो न भवतीति स्थितम् -- पदमञ्जरी , 1-4-105

  

C)  HN Bhat : इदमस्तुसन्निकृष्टं समीपतरवर्ति चैतदो रूपम् \| अदमस्तु विप्रकृष्टं तदिति परोक्षे विजानीयात् \|\| These are the **rules of pronouns** idam, etad, adasbased on प्रत्यक्ष, परोक्ष, सन्निकर्ष विप्रकर्ष :

(BVK)- Also, the ‘root’ from which ‘ bhavat’ (praatipadika) is derived
and the ‘ pratyaya- prakriyaa’ is presented differently.

HN Bhat **:** **Distinguishing the terms** **भवत्**** by derivation process**: \< भवत् is not derived from bhoo dhatu, as explained above **and it is sarvanaama**. The भवत् derived from bhoo dhatu is not Sarvanaama and is derived as शत्रन्त भवन् - भवन्तौ - भवन्तौ! सर्वनाम भवच्छब्द is derived as भवान् - in the singular and rest like शत्रन्त from bhoo dhatu. "त्यदादीनि च"(1.1.74) makes सर्वनाम भवच्छब्द to take cha suffix by वृद्धाच्छः 4\|2\|114 deriving भवदीयः and from यमष्मत् - त्वदीयः, युष्मदीयः

(VACHASPATYAM ) - भवत् - भवत् \[Cologne record ID=36299\] \[Printed book page 4645,b\]

भवत्¦ त्रि० भा—डवतु । १ **युष्मदर्थे****,** **सर्वनामता** **चास्य** । भवान् - भवत्याः पुत्रः भवत्पुत्रः । भू—शतृ । २ वर्त्तमानकालाथ -\[Page4646-a+ 38\] ३ भवनकर्त्तरि च । भवन् स्त्रियामुभयत्र ङीप् शत्रन्तस्य

( MONIER WILLIAMS) भवत् - भवत् \[L=35227\] \[p= 0702-b\] 1bhavat, an, antī, at, being, becoming; present; (antī), f. time being, present time; (**with some grammarians**) the technical term for the present tense; \[cf. bhavanti.\] भवत् \[L=35228\] 2bhavat, ān, m. (said to be fr. rt. 1. bhā, to shine, Uṇādi-s. 1. 64), the honorific or respectful pronoun, generally translatable by your honour, your highness, your worship, your lordship, you (**used respectfully for the second personal pronoun, but properly with th****e third person of the verb, e. g. bhavān dadātu, let your highness give**); bhavan, voc. sing. m. ‘O sir,’ ‘O my lord,’ or contracted into bhos, q. v.; bhavadbhis, by your honour; (atī), f. lady, your ladyship; bhavatyas, your ladyships; bhavati, voc. sing. f. ‘O lady:’ Manu II. 49 assigns a different position in the sentence to this honorific pronoun according to the person using it; **a Brāhman should say, bhavati bhikshā****ṃ** **dehi, ‘good lady give alms;**’ a Kshatriya, bhikshām bhavati dehi; a Vaiśya, dehi bhikshām bhavati: **this honorific pronoun bhavat is sometimes used when tvam occurs in another clause of the same sentence; sometimes the plural is employed to express greater courtesy** (e. g. bhavantaḥ pramāṇam, your honour is an authority**); bhavat is exceptionally found in construction with \[Page0702-c+ 81\] the 2nd person sing**.; \[cf. atra-bhº, tato-bhº, tatra- bhº.\] — Bhavat-putra, as, m. your honour's son, your highness' son, your son. — Bhavad-deva, as, m., N. of a man mentioned in the Smṛiti-kaustubha. — Bhavad-vaćana, am, n. your honour's speech, your speech. — Bhavad-vidha, as, ā, am, any one like your honour or like you. — Bhavad-vidhi, is, m. your honour's manner (i. e. the way in which you are treated). — Bhavan-manyu, us, m., N. of a king; \[cf. bhu-manyu, bhū-manyu.\] — Bhavā- dṛiksha, as, ī, am (bhavā for bhavat), or bhavā- dṛiś, k, k, k, or bhavā-dṛiśa, as, ī, am, any one like your honour or like you.



-------------------

Surely, technicalities of Samskruth Language have a bearing on these rules and look for whose word rules the standards of Samskruth: Grammarian or Poet.
