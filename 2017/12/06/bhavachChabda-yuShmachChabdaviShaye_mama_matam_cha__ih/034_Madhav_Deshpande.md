As it appears to me, there is no known explanation for the alternation of bhavān and tvam in reference to the same person in the same passage.
Consider this one from the Bhagavadgītā where each line shows this alternation:

  

ākhyāhi me kobhavānugra-rūpo namo 'stu te deva-vara prasīda vijñātum icchāmi bhavantam ādyaṁ na hi prajānāmi tava pravṛttim (Bhagavad Gita 11.31)
