Dear Madhav,

  

Thanks for the supplementary evidence. It strengthens your assertion. I notice that the bhavat-sentence has (almost?) always preceded the yuṣmad-sentence in the passages you have cited (from your collection that must have taken much time to put together). Could this be an indication of the distinction that originally existed between the use of bhavat and the use of yuṣmad? I will think about the possibility.
