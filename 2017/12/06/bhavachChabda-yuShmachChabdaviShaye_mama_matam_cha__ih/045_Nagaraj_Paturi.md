The third person usages in the sense of second person usages, in an honorific sense are seen in Tamil, (I think in Malayalam too).

  

sārukk(u) enna vēṇḍum? ( What does 'sir' want?) in the sense of What do you want, sir? is a regularly used traditional expression in the expressions by traditional assisting class.

  

sār! ungal̥akk(u)( to + honorific you) enna vēṇḍum? ( Sir! What do you want?) may have an alternative expression 'sār! unakk(u) ( to + non-honorific you ) enna vēṇḍum ? ( Sir! What do you want?) in a certain rustic style of expression.

  

sārukk(u) enna vēṇḍum? ( What does 'sir' want?)  

  

sār! uṅgal̥akk(u)( to + honorific you) enna vēṇḍum? ( Sir! What do you want?)  

  

'sār! unakk(u) ( to + non-honorific you ) enna vēṇḍum ? ( Sir! What do you want?)  

  

convey the same meaning.
