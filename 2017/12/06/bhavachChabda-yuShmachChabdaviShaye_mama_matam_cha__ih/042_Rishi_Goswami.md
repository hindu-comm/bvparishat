I read the Padamanjari Tika carefully. It is crystal clear.  
भवति! भिक्षां देहि। First of all let us know one thing that युष्मद् is सम्बोधनैकपर । That means it is only used when someone is addressed. Therefore it is Aadyodatt. Twam will come automatically as "api" is used in the Sootra. Prayujyamane aprayujyamane api.  
As we can see, the Anvay is. भवति! त्वं भिक्षां देहि। The sambodhan is Bhavatu Shabd over here. So how can Bhavatu be संबोध्यविषयक and सम्बोधनविषयक at the same time?  
2Viruddha Dharma in the same Dharmi at the same time?  
  
If so, भवति! भवान् भिक्षां देहि??? It doesn't seem possible. Now the question arises that can Bhavatu Shabd be Sambodhya Parak? Pandamanjarikaar says. I quote: "युष्मदर्थप्रतीतेः स्थानिन्यपीति मध्यमः प्राप्नोति, न वा युष्मदर्थत्वात्, अलिङ्गः सम्बोधनविषयश्च  
युष्मदर्थः। भवदर्थस्तु लिङ्गवान् न च सम्बोधनैकविषयः।" That means Bhavatu Shabd is not only(ek) Sambodhana Vishayak. It can be Sambodhya Vishayak also.  
  
The question was that "ParamAham pachami or Paramatvam pachasi" has Yushmadartha so Madhyam and Uttam are used respectively. But Bhavatu also has Yushmadarth-pratiti as mentioned by Padamanjarikaar.  
But it is not Yushmadarth. It has a pratiti. My lack of knowledge had made me think that Bhavatu can totally replace Yushmad Shabd.  
But though both have the same Arthapratiti, Alingatvat and Sambodhyaparakatvaat also both are not the same.  
  
You can use Bhavat Shabd wherever there is Sambhavna of Yushmad Shabd. As BVK Shastriji mentioned, now it is totally on Vivaksha which Shabda to use on which occasion.  
Thankyou for all the support of Schollars. My Jijnasa is resolved finally.
