The other difference between Hindi āp and Sanskrit bhavat is that in Hindi usage, if one is addressing someone with āp, one does not switch to tum or tū in the same conversation. The usage of bhavat as recorded in epics and classical works is different. There is switching back and forth between bhavat and tvam with reference to the same person in the same conversation. For example, consider verses 7 and 8 in the first chapter of the Bhagavadgītā:

  

अस्माकं तु विशिष्टा ये तान् निबोध द्विजोत्तम ।

नायका मम सैन्यस्य संज्ञार्थं तान् ब्रवीमि ते ।। ७।। \[Here Duryodhana refers to Droṇa in second person.\]

भवान् भीष्मश्च कर्णश्च .... \[Here he is referred to as bhavān\]

  

There are numerous such instances in the epic and classical literature.
