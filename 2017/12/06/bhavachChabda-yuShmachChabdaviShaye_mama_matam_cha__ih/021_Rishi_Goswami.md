Namo Haraye.  
Thankyou Hn Bhatt ji.  
Yes, I was going to write that but then I thought that my question was answered so I did not clarify further. And the response for Linga is that "Yushmad Asmad Shat sanjnakas trishu Saroopah." Yushmad Asmad and Shat Sanjnak roopas work in all three genders with no change. Samano roopo yesham te saroopah.  
  
You and the learned men maybe knowing this but just writing it for the sake of it. Thankyou again for the effort.  
Namo Namah.
