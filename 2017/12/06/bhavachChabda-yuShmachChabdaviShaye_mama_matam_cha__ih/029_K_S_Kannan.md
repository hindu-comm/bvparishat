*bhavat* is said to be of 2 types

\- (a) as *sambodhya-para*, and

 (b) as *sabodhanamātra-para*.

In (a), it has no *yu**ṣ**mad*-sense.

In (b), it has.  

  

As a result,

in (a), there is the usage of *prathama*-*puruṣa*.

in (b), it will have *madhyama*-*puruṣa*.

  

There is also the opinion - of Rakṣita - that

it is only in the feminine that *bhavat* can be (b).

  

If anybody needs the reference for the śāstraic discussion on this by a leading authority,

I can supply.
