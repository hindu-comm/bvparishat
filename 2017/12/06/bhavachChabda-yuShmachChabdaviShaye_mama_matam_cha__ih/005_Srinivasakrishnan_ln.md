A counter factual however.  

  

The Hindi 'aapa' is sometimes used in third person for a person in context. AIR radio concerts when about to play a song by an ustad,
start in pure third person, " liijiye suniye pandita ravishankara kaa sitaara vaadana. pandita ravishankara sangiita ke vishva mein etc etc.... ' . After this they immediately switch to, 'aapa ne apanii mauziqii taaliima ustaada allaauddina khaana se praapta kii'.  

  

It's a somewhat tricky situation - here Hindi 'aapa' seems to be exactly like the classical 'bhavaan'
