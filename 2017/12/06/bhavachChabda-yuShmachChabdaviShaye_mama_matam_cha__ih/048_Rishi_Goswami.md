Dear BVK Shastryji,  
Namaste to you.

My doubts were very aptly resolved when I read MudraRakshasam. It even improved my language.

It often deals with using 3rd person in order to reflect greatness. Bhavat shabd is often substituted by words like "Arya" and "Deva" there. Where the Tikakar writes, "bhavacchabda-arthe aaryashabdaprayogah".

What my initial doubt was, is Bhavatshabda in reference to a person in front of us appropriate? Is it used in 3rd person but meant for the 2nd person (ie the person I am talking to/addressing)?

The answer seems pretty apt in usage. Bhavatshabd is in Prathama Purusha, but 3rd person is only a sign of respect, in reality, the meaning of it is to address a respected person we are talking with in front, and cal also be otherwise as bAlamanoramakara says, "sambodyAsambodhyasAdhAraNatvAd".

It can be  
"Aryah/tatra bhavan Chanakayah Uchyatam"  
in actual 3rd person (asambodhya-viSHaye),when Arya is far from me, or it can be  
"Kim AjnApayati Aaryah/Devah/Bhavan?"  
When Arya is in front of me (sambodhya-viSHaye).

Bhavan is not tvam shabd but a sarvanam used in sense of sambodhyAsambodhya-sAdhAraNatva.

Balamanorama explained perfectly and it became more clear as I read more literature, Nrisimhavijamahanatakam, Malatimadhavam, Mudrarakshasam and Dashamumaracharitam.  

Balamanorama:  
"BhavAn AgaCCHhatItyAdau tu na madhyamapuruSHah, yuSHmatchhabdasya sambodhyaika-viSHaytvAt bhavatchhabdasya tu svabhAvena sambodyAsambodhya-sAdhAraNatvAd ityalam."

So, this meaning was blurred when initially exposed to it, which became clearer through time.

Thankyou to all schollars for helping.  
Namaste.
