Namaste Rishi Goswami ji, Murthy ji

 Please do not take this as dragging of the discussion. \<The Upapad is Yushmad in Samanadhikaranam \> does not resolve the original issue raised, for the reasons placed below. The multiple explanations of ‘ bhavat’, using two roots also does not resolve the issue. I place below the rule segments with two specific instances of common usage and uncommon usage to substantiate my argument.

 The original question triggering the deliberation is not resolved so simply ! and it does not close the issue articulated and raised as follows: \< Could this be an indication of the distinction that originally existed between the use of bhavat and the use of yuṣmad?> by Professor Aklujkar\> and understanding Gita (4-4) \<अपरं **भवतो** जन्म परं जन्म विवस्वत: । कथमेतद् विजानीयां **त्वमा**दौ प्रोक्तवानिति \> ? provided by Prof. Madhav Deshpande\> ?

 The issues involved have critical impact on ‘How to Use, Teach, Research, Translate and Study Paninian Samskrutham.

 If one is planning to be happy and brush off the debate by tagging it as ‘irrelevant’, ‘Buddhist / Hybrid/ Brahminical Sanskrit technicality of classic language’, I do not have any tiff with them. It still remains to be explained as to the insistence of ‘ Brahmanical insistence on using ‘Bhavati Bhikshaam dehi’ as an important expression in a ritual associated with Vedic studies.

(Note: Many urls providing Samskruth texts typed from image-pages need proofing. I do not know who needs to address this issue. The precision of Samskruth cannot be allowed to stay at the mercy of the ‘typos’ and ‘ program provided display errors showing little pretty boxes and question marks ! Any way that is a different issue of ‘Sanskrit-Computer’ teams.).

 ***The reasoning on why*** ***\<******The*** ***Upapad is Yushmad in Samanadhikarana******m*** ***\>*** ***needs an extended analysis.*******



1. I do take note of the 'upa-pade' and the '(sati) saptami' of the term in the sutra. The entire debate of ‘bhavati bhikshaam dehi’ needs to be analyzed in the ‘total perspective of ‘sarvanama - and
‘purusha vidhaayaka niyama for kriyapada’.



 The model of slack –slick –slang social usage of Tamil cannot be a comparable issue under the discussion of technicality of ‘Samskrutham’. The tolerance of such inaccuracies in the ‘translation’ especially in to English has been the mother seed of many problems in derailing ‘Sanskrit Research’ ! and ‘Social conversation model of Sanskrit prachaar- prasaar’.

 The relevant sutra segment to understand this discussion on **Why** **‘****Bhavati bhikshaam Dehi****’** **is a right expre****ssion** and held as ‘training for a (young eight year old) brahmana vatu in the guru kul and intending for veda-adhyayana’ are the following.

 2\\.2\\.19  **upapadam ating**** ( Technicality of upapada)**

 Let us introduce an additional line for analysis.

 ***Line for analysis***: sloka-pada: ‘maam pahi samkarshana, maam pahi he keshava’.

 ***Question***: Should ‘tvam’ as ‘yushat –sarvanama is needed here or Not? How is ‘Paahi’ to be justified and aligned to ? What is the users intention - Is it ‘Keshava, tvam paahi’ (Stress on Keashavas action) or ‘Keshava,maam pahi’ ( Stress on My need and desire, submission).

2. Just for arguments sake, why should 'sati be placed in between as suggested in the brackets

 \<Yushmadi upapapde(**sati**)samanadhikarane shtanini api(prayujyamane aprayujyamane api) madhyamah(**syat**).\>



 Is it because it is explained so? Why should ' upa-pada' be treated to imply 'additional word'? as Balamanorama explains -

 युष्मदीति ॥ **उपोञ्चारितम्पदमुपपदम्** ।

 I do understand the rule of upapadam उपपदमतिङ्॥ (2-2-19) comes as a part of ting- ating samasa discussion; but it is relevant here because , the samasa is ‘ nitya’ and the outcome is a ‘ pratipadika with a ‘dhatu garbha’. See

 \[ - काशिका-वृत्तिः - उपपदम् अतिङ् २।२।१९ - नित्यम् इति वर्तते। उपपदम् **अतिङन्तं** **समर्थेन** **शब्दान्तरेण** **सह** **समस्यते** **नित्यम्****,** **तत्पुरुषश्च** **समासो** भवति।

 कुम्भकारः। नगरकारः। \]. The ‘ sarvanama’ is distantly and deeply connected due to the ‘ Dhatu and Ting’ embedded in the ‘ tatpurusha - samasa - janita

 –pratipadika’.

 Following the well travelled path of 'वाक्यद्वयमिदं / yoga-vibhaaga' models, the expanded construction of the sutra for (1-4-105), why not see the sutra construction be argued out differently ? Why not go by the Panini’s definition of ‘ upapadam ating’ ? taking clue from the Balamanorama observations ‘\*युष्मदि। उपोच्चारितं पदमुपपदम्। युष्मदि समीपोच्चारिते सतीत्यर्थः। समानमेकमधिकरणं वाच्यं यस्येति विग्रहः। **सामानाधिकरण्यं** **च** **युष्मदस्तिङः** **स्थानीभूतलकारेण** **विवक्षितम्****, \`****लः** **परस्मैपद****'****मित्यतस्तदनुवृत्तेः।** तथा च फलितमाह--**तिङ्वाच्यकारकवाचिनि** **युष्मदीति।** स्थानं-- प्रसङ्गोऽस्यास्तीति स्थानी, तस्मिन्। प्रसक्ते सतीत्यर्थः। प्रसङ्गश्च तदर्थावगतौ सत्यां वक्रा अप्रयोग एव भवति। **तथा** **च** **\`****स्थानिनी****'****त्यनेन** **उपपदभूते** **युष्मदि** **प्रयोगं** **विना** **स्वार्थं** **बोधयति** **सतीत्यर्थः** **पर्यवस्यति**। तदाह-- अप्रयुज्यमान इति। \`स्थानिनी'त्यनुक्तौ युष्मद्युपपदे प्रयुज्यमान एव मध्यमः स्यात्। ततश्च राम पाहीत्यादावव्याप्तिः स्यात्। अपिना लब्धमाह--प्रयुज्यमानेऽपीति। \`युष्मद्युपपदे स्थानिनी'त्येवोक्तौ राम त्वं पाहीत्यादौ युष्मत्प्रयोगे मध्यमो न स्यादतोऽपिग्रहणमिति भावः। अत्वं त्वं संपद्यत इत्यत्र तु न मध्यमपुरुषः, तत्र युष्मच्छब्दस्य गौणत्वात्। \`भवानागच्छती'त्यादौ भवच्छब्दयोगे तु न मध्यमपुरुषः, युष्मच्छब्दस्य संबोध्यैकविषयत्वात्, भवच्छब्दस्य तु स्वभावेन संबोध्याऽसंबोध्यसादारणत्वादित्यलम्। \\



3. Then the likely expansion of (1-4-105) would emerge as :
