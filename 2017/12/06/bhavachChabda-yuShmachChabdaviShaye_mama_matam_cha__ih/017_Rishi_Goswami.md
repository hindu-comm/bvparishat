नामस्कारः।  
If we take the above conversation in mind, using आईए with आप is incorrect. So आप आएँ is the correct usage as in third person.  
तुम आओ।  
But with whom will we use आइए then? So what I think is, आइए maybe a verb for the third person and not the second person. As it is only used with आप।  
आइए can be called as सामान्यभविष्यत् प्रथमपुरुष and आएँ can be considered as लोट् प्रथमपुरुष।  
Many thanks to all schollars also.  
  
What I think is आप is also used as युष्मद् but only the पुरुष is changed. भवत् can totally be translated as आप as well and not वे। As now, आप is gramaticaly used in third person only, so आप will do the rest.  
  
My conclusion: Third person can also be used while the person is front with the word भवत् in Samskrit which I hought could only be used for a person you aren't talking about. As I am the first person, the one Im talking to is the second person. But I can also talk to him in Third person in meaning of second person with the usage of भवत्। Am I right?
