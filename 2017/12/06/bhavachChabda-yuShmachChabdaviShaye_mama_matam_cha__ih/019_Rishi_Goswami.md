नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।  
Many thanx to all schollars who helped me. What I've derived of this discussion. A schollar,Shri V Subramanium gave a link of Ramayan which was very helpful.  
प्रोषिते मयि यत्पापं मात्रा मत्कारणात्कृतम्।  
क्षुद्रया तदनिष्टं मे प्रसीदतु भवान्मम।।2.106.8।।  
When I was away from home, my meanminded mother committed a sin for my sake which I never wished. You may pardon me graciously.

तदपत्यं भवानस्तु मा भवान् दुष्कृतं पितुः।  
अभिपत्ता कृतं कर्म लोके धीरविगर्हितम्।।2.106.16।।  
So be a worthy son and let not the sinful act committed by our father and condemned by men of wisdom be approved by you.

Over here we can clearly see that Bhavat can totally replace Yushmad, even though used in third person. It does not matter where the person is, Pratyaksh air Apratyaksh. It is a total representative of Yushmad and also can be switched from Bhavat to Yushmad in the same shlok referring to the same person as mentioned in The Gita.  
These are some examples from Abhishek Natakam 4th Sarg.  
1.राम: - अये विभीषण:। विभीषण! अपि कुशली भवान्।  
विभीषण: - देव! अद्य कुशली संवृत्तोऽस्मि।  
2.राम: - लङ्कागमने मार्गं दातुमर्हति भवान्।  
वरुण: - एष मार्गः। प्रयातु भवान्। (अन्तर्हित:।)  
3.राम: - वयस्य! विभीषण! कथमिव भवान् मन्यते।  
विभीषण: - देव!  
एतौ हि राक्षसेन्द्रस्य सम्मतौ मन्त्रिणौ नृप! ।  
प्राणान्तिकेऽपि व्यसने लङ्केशं नैव मुञ्चत: ।। 20 ।।  
तस्माद् यथार्हं दण्डमाज्ञापयतु देव:।

It is quite evident that Bhavat shabd can be substituted with Yushmad whenever wished with no compulsions associated with its usage.

Thankyou all Schollars for helping me out.  
Haraye Namah.  
Rishi.
