आप being used in the sense of तुम in Hindi is similar to what happened in English. Just as the singular 'thou' got completely replaced by the honorific 'you', in the usage of a certain social class in Hindi/Urdu, आप replaces तुम. In the usage of such class, even मैं gets replaced by हम .

  

आप being used in the sense of 'this person' is also such a development of honorific expression replacing the singular.

  

In my place people call such expressions as नवाबी जबान .

  

Usage of आप in both the second and third persons in Hindi; does it have parallel in the use of भवच्छ्ब्द in Sanskrit ?

  

Use of भवच्छ्ब्द in third person in ancient Sanskrit usages, if substantiated with more examples should be a very interesting observation.
