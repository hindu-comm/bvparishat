युष्मद्युपपदे समानाधिकरणे स्थानिन्यपि मध्यमः॥१।४।१०४!
अस्मद्युत्तमः॥१।४।१०६!!  
युष्मद्युपपदेे स्मानाभिधेये सति प्रयुज्यमानेऽपि अप्रयुज्यमानेऽपि मध्यमः !  
अस्मदि उपपदे स्मानाभिधेये सति प्रयुज्यमानेऽपि अप्रयुज्यमानेऽपि उत्तमपुरुषः !

These are the rules restricting Second person and first person verbs to युष्मद्  
अस्मद् whether these two used or not. But with rest of the nouns third person is used शेषे प्रथमः॥१।४।१०७!

" भातेर्डवतुः" भवत्छब्दस्य भा दीप्तौ इति धातोर्निष्पन्नस्य युष्दस्मद्भिन्नत्वात् शेषत्वेन युष्मदर्थत्वेपि प्रथमपुरुष एव! न तु प्रत्यक्ष-परोक्ष-भेदेन!

 Again, ‘bhavat’ - if it is to be treated as a derivative from the root ‘ bhoo’ (to be) with a participle ( Krit) to yield the ‘ pratipadika form’- bhavat, which becomes a ‘ naama-pada’ ( and not a sarva-naama), capable of taking on ‘ gender specificity as masculine /feminine – bhavaan - bhavatee , the grammar technicality is different between the two shabda-roopas. Due to this root ‘bhoo’ embedded in ‘ bhavat’, all the meanings of the bhoo dhatu get inherited to the use of bhavat with the modifications from krit pratyaya. This does not happen in the sarvanama- yushmat  

----'  
Not clear. Sorry.

भवत् is not derived from bhoo dhatu, as explained above and it is
sarvanaama. The भवत् derived from bhoo dhatu is not Sarvanaama and is derived as शत्रन्त भवन् - भवन्तौ - भवन्तौ! सर्वनाम भवच्छब्द is derived as भवान् - in the singular and rest like शत्रन्त from bhoo dhatu.
"त्यदादीनि च"(1.1.74) makes सर्वनाम भवच्छब्द to take cha suffix by वृद्धाच्छः 4\|2\|114 deriving भवदीयः and from यमष्मत् - त्वदीयः, युष्मदीयः
