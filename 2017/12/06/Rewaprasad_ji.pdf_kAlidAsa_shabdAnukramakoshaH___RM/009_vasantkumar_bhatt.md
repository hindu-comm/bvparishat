Respected Dr. Shankara,

Namaste ! Every time Your instant help is highly appreciated.

I would like to know that is the "Kalidasa Concordance - vol. 1" based on Telugu manuscripts of Kalidasa's work OR is it based on some printed editions ?

Kindly give me the proper sources of that KOSH. I have checked some words, & found that they are not available in popular editions.

Thank you again for your kind help.
