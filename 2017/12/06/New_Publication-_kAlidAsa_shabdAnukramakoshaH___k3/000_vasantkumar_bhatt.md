Respected Scholars,  
Namaste. Here is a very exciting news. Prof. Rewaprasad ji and Dr. Sadashivkumar Dwivedi has published a Word Index of Kalidasa ( with complete texts of 7 poetry ). कालिदास शब्दानुक्रमकोशः । It is a important research tool for the textual studies in Kalidasa. It will be also helpful to study the Indian culture through Kalidasa. I congratulate both the editors and thank them for publishing such great work.  
I have attached some pages of the same for the first hand information.  
Regards and thanks,  
Vasantkumar M Bhatt
