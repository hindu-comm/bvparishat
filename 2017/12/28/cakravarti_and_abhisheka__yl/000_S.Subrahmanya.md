namaste

I would like to request help on these questions:

  

a\) what are the sources to find out more about what a Cakravartin is - definition, responsibilities etc

b\) is there a special abhisheka done to be crowned as a Cakravarti ?

  - are there details about this abhisheka for cakravartin ?

  

This is the only reference I have found so far.
