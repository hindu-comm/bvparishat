Namaste



1. The scholars demise is deeply mourned. It certainly is a loss to the field of comparative linguistics.



2. Samskruth research seems to have remained compartmentalized in national boundaries ! There needs to be some way for Indian traditional scholars to understand how world outside of India has looked at the

‘ Paninian frame of language’.



3. How to rekindle the fire for Samskruth Research ? at Russia ? or rather globally ? Options being:



 - Conversational model (Sambhashanam) or

- Ritual ( Karma Kaanda)

- Academic translation – manuscript research Classical model in ivory towers

- Science-Technology- Techno-linguistic Research ? where Technologist frames language in machine boundaries and ‘ anglicized program strucutures’

 OR

Yoga-Samskrutham model as People Wellness benefits by ‘ practice of Samskrutham as Yoga’ ?
