Namaste.

  

It is a very sad news to hear the demise of Prof. A. A. Zaliznyak.

  

I knew him as the author of highly useful for me "Грамматический словарь русского языка" (1980) \[Grammatical Dictionary of the Russian Language\]. This is also a reverse dictionary about which I learnt during my student life of Russian. Such a dictionary in any Indian language is still a desideratum.

  

May his soul rest in peace !

  

Narayan Prasad
