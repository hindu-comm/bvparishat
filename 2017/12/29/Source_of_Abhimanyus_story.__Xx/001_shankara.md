Namaste,

  

It seems that the story of Abhimanyu learning Chakravyuha-bhedanam from Arjuna is not there in the Mahabhrata available to us today. This story might be part of folk-lore.  

  

Chapter 34 of Dronaparva of Mahabharata has the following conversation between Yudhishthira and Abhimanyu wherein Abhimanyu says that he was taught by Arjuna how to break and enter the chakravyuha and that he would not be able to come out of it by himself.

Yudhishthira said:

  

एत्य नो नार्जुनो गर्हेद्यथा तात तथा कुरु \|  
चक्रव्यूहस्य न वयं विद्म भेदं कथञ्चन \|\|१४\|\|  
  
त्वं वार्जुनो वा कृष्णो वा भिन्द्यात्प्रद्युम्न एव वा \|  
चक्रव्यूहं महाबाहो पञ्चमोऽन्यो न विद्यते \|\|१५\|\|  

  

अभिमन्युरुवाच\|\|

  
द्रोणस्य दृढमव्यग्रमनीकप्रवरं युधि \|  
पितॄणां जयमाकाङ्क्षन्नवगाहे भिनद्मि च \|\|१८\|\|  
  
उपदिष्टो हि मे पित्रा योगोऽनीकस्य भेदने \|  

नोत्सहे तु विनिर्गन्तुमहं कस्याञ्चिदापदि \|\|१९\|\|

  

There is also an interesting article on Abhimanyu's previous life (Abhimanyu Upakhyana) by M.R. Majumdar published in ABORI 1945.
