Respected Scholars,

Pranams..

  

It is usually said that Abhimanyu, while he was in the womb of Subhadra, learnt thetechnique of entering *Chakravyuha* from LordKrishna.But as Subhadra fell a sleep, theunfortunate Abhimanyu did not hear the technique of coming back from*Chakravyuha* and due to the incomplete knowledge, he wasbrutallykilled in the Mahabharata war later.

  

I wasunable to trace back this story in*Mahabharata*. Does this story is part of Mahabharata or does it belong to any other source/s? Please guide to find the primary source/s of Abhimanyuâ€™s story.

  

Thanking you,

Anil.
