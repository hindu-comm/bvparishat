Dear list,

  

Jai Shri Ram!  
  

I have co-translated a book named 'Kashi Martand' on Jagadguru Ramanandacharya ji, the most prominent spiritual exponent of Shri Ramanandi sect. The book was originally written in Hindi in 1990s and has been translated in English now.

  

Shri Rama, along with twelve Mahabhagwats, re-appeared in mrityulok around 700 years ago in his Guru avtaar. Some of the renowned disciples in lineage are Shri Kabirdas ji, Shri Raidas ji and further in lineage are Goswami Tulsidas ji, Meera bai, Shri Nabhadas.  
  
The book has been translated on inspiration of Mahamandaleshwar Svami Abhiramdas ji Maharaj. I am attaching few images of the book's promotion (With Dr. Subramanian Swamy, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Shrimati Heera ben and Shri Pankaj Modi (mother and brother of Shri Narendra Modi), Svami Abhiramdas ji Maharaj, Malookpeethadhishwar Svami Rajendradas ji respectively).

  

If any one is interested to take the book, please feel free to contact me through email.

  

Warm regards,

Apurv Agarwal
