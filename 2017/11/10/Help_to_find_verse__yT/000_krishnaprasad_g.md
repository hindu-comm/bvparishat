Dear all

I'm looking for a verse on Nyayashastra with the following meaning:

One may read this work and feign understanding. One may even teach it. One may even write commentaries on it. But he may still miss the secrets hidden herein.

  

I am not able recall the source too. Kindly anyone help.
