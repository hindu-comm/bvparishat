I am looking for the text of the Vādyādhyāya (6th chapter) of the Saṅgītaratnākara. I checked the [archive.org](http://archive.org). Butnone of the copies includes this chapter. The third volume of the Adyar edition (Saṅgītaratnākara of Śārṅgadēva. III: With the kalānidhi of Kallinātha and the sudhākara od Siṁhabhūpāla) contains this chapter. All other volumes are available online except the 3rd one. Even the Anandashram edition does not contain the 6th chapter. Any assistance to find an online copy of this chapter would be highly appreciated.  

  

Regards,

Deepro.
