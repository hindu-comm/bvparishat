Date of Mahabharata war is a topic of great interest to many; believers and non-believers; Swadeshis and Videshis alike. The most recent work on this is by Dr. Bhatnagar, a reputed astronomer, published in IJHS. I am attaching a copy of the paper for those who are interested in the subject. I find the work to be of high quality without misinterpretations of the text. Whatever may be the historical period in which Krishna lived, the sky observation details available to us today in the MB text cannot belong to 2000-3067 BC. They are more consistent with 1400-1800 BC.

When we think of MB date, it can not be separated from the Great BhIShma PitAmaha and the UttarAyaNa PuNyakAla, which this year was over a week back. Tomorrow is the opening of the UttarAyaNA-Door in ViShNu temples which synchronizes with the Winter Solstice day once in about 18-19 years.

  

Greetings for a blissful VaikuNTha EkAdas'I
