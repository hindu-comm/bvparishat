Namaste,

  

In the context of the two articles cited in this thread, I would like to add another one.

  

A few years back, I had an opportunity to work with Acharya Sadaji (Dr. K. Sadananda,Chinmaya Mission, Virginia, USA) to reprint his older article for a local temple souvenir. A digital copy can be obtained by following the link:

thanks,

..gopal gopinath
