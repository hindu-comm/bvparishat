नमस्ते श्रीमन् आमोद-कुलकर्णी-महोदय !

  

To my mindभाष्य, is different from both प्रवचन and व्याख्यान.भाष्य,is always with reference to a reference text. By that token शाङ्करभाष्य is not any generic term. One has to clarifyशाङ्करभाष्य on which text, whether on गीता or ब्रह्मसूत्राणि or ईशावास्योपनिषत् ....  

  

I think, grammaticallyभाष्य, derived fromभाष् with ण्यत्-प्रत्यय would translate as "May it be so said" Sinceभाष् is आत्मनेपदी,भाष्य becomes loud thinking by oneself unto oneself. When one is deliveringभाष्य, there can be no interjection. Soभाष्य is always an uninterrupted flow of thought, with reference to a reference text.

  

गीता by itself is not aभाष्य. there are so many interjections by अर्जुन and सञ्जय.   

  

प्रवचन and व्याख्यान can be considered as being synonyms. The prefix प्र inप्रवचनhas in it, almost the same force as the prefixes वि and आ have in व्याख्यान. Of course, in its meaningख्या has quite some long winding utterance, than what utterance is there in वच्. Because of long winding inherent to it, Indian classical singing has got its name as ख्याल गायकी.
