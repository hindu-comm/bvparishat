Some practical observations:

  

1\. The word 'pravachana' is being reserved /used to refer to 1. explanations through lecture-performance 2. on religious /spiritual topics / texts 3. to a religiously /spiritually oriented rather than academically oriented audience.

  

2\. The word bhaashya has been used to refer to specific commentatorial
works or works of the nature of commentary of great prestige 1. in a written format 2. not necessarily but including on religious /spiritual topics / texts 3. addressed to academic audience not excluding the religiously /spiritually oriented ones.

  

3\. The word vyaakhyaana has the same features as bhaashya above, but it is not used in as prestigious a sense as that of bhaashya, it refers to a generic commentatorial work.
