Sri L Srinivas was right. It had to do with the settings. Only managers were allowed to attach files to a New Post during the previous moderator. I think thats a default settting that remained unchanged. There was a discussion among the managing team on this. As per our decision, now I changed it to allow all members to attach files to their New Post.
