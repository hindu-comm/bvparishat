I dont see either the attach button for "New Topic" or that for "Reply".  
  
I think it's the way BVP has been set up. If you want to change it for the "Reply" window, this what you do:  
  
You select the gear button on the right hand side top when you're in the group page. There you select 'group settings' . Here you select 'permissions' and then within it 'posting permissions'. There is an attachment setting there. The setting could be 'owners', 'managers', 'all members' or public. I suspect the current setting is one of the first two categories.  
  
  
  
Hope this helps,  
  
Srini
