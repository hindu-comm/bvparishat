Not only rules of Sandhi, but other grammar rules, are not expected to be learnt for a native speaker of Sanskrit, if learnt from native speakers. Nor languages spoken from childhood, are seen to be learnt by learning grammar of the language. Why specifically for Sanskrit the
rules of Sandhi? In native speakers of any language is using Sandhi rules naturally applicable to the language spoken. We learn grammar in schools only and not for speaking the language.

Ramaratnam ji, sandhi is a phenomenon that is not intended to add meaning to a sentence. So people are more likely to ignore sandhi as compared to other grammatical rules. Also, sandhi is expected to pervade Sanskrit speech quite uniformly so I found it more important to discuss it.
