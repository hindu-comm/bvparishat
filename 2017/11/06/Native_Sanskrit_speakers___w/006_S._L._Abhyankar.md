नमांसि अच्युत-कर्वे-उज्ज्वल-राजपूत-महोदयौ !

  

Having read your responses, I would like to respond as follows =>

Because of its long-established and comprehensively detailed grammar, Sanskrit has become a language with zero tolerance for deviations, even for spoken Sanskrit. In fact, that single fact distinguishes Sanskrit from any other language. For most other languages, spoken tongue can be much different from the literary tongue. Once when speaking to an English gentleman, I was surprised to learn that an Irishman may just not understand what a Scot is speaking, though both consider that what language they speak is English. It is also well-known that American English has become much different than British English.

Having said as above, I must also acknowledge that some regional variations have crept into Sanskrit, especially when pronouncing words like ज्ञानम्.In North India they would pronounce it as ग्यानम्, in Western India they pronounce it as द्न्यानम्, though the actual syllabic composition is ज्-ञ्-आ-नम्. Despite these pronunciation-differences, the written word will always beज्ञानम्.In all dictionaries it will always be found as a conjunct ofज्-ञ्-आ.

1.  In North India they tend to pronounce a letterlike स्त्री as
    इस्त्री.
2.  Many such deviations have come to be tolerated. But note, these are
    only tolerated, not accepted by changing rules of grammar.

Having said so, one does find Sanskrit dramas with chaste Sanskrit spoken by select characters and lesser characters speaking अर्धमागधी. All such dramas are not Sanskrit dramas *per sé*, but bilinguals.

1.  Such tradition seems to be universal. For example I just now used
    the French phrase per séwhich translates into English as "for
    itself".
2.  e.g. is the abbreviation of the Latin phrase '**exempli gratia**,'
    meaning 'for example.'  

About use of संधि-s in spoken Sanskrit, the rule is clear, regarding whenसंधि is compulsory and when it is optional. The rule is well versified, so that one can easily etch it in one's memory => संहितैकपदे नित्या, नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः / नित्या समासे, वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते // The rule applies to all Sanskrit, spoken or written. Even though it is the rule, the rule itself grants use of discretion or choiceविवक्षा, which is akin to "T&C apply"
