Achyut Karve ji,  
  
I answered a similar question elsewhere recently.

  

Sanskrit was not (contrary to popular misinformed opinion) a single dialect. It was the grammatically and phonetically standardized form of spoken late-Vedic.

For there to exist a standardized form of the language, there should be multiple non-standard forms that are in use. The very existence of Pāṇini's grammatical standard is itself the most potent proof of there having been multiple dialects of spoken sanskrit in the late-vedic period.

  

The spoken dialects for which sanskrit grammar was composed can all be called sanskrit even though they did not obviously 100% agree grammatically or phonetically to the standard language in practice. Vestiges of these pre-standardized Old-Indic dialects survive from Indo-Aryan literature composed throughout the vedic period, particularly from the 5th-2nd centuries BCE (when a profusion of grammatical and phonetics texts were composed to standardize the spoken language).  
  
Vedic was not a single uniform dialect, it is the common name (umbrella term) given to several closely related spoken Indo-Iranian dialects of the Vedic period in South Asia (roughly 1500 BCE to 300 BCE).  
  
If you mean to include all the Vedic (and vedic-derived) spoken dialects in the name ‘sanskrit’, then Sanskrit was the only spoken IE language (in the predominant sense)

 in the India of the Pāṇinian era

.  
  
However, we know from evidence that on the western fringes of late-Vedic India (areas of Punjab and Sindh which are now part of Pakistan), some old-Iranian

 

dialects were also spoken along with Sanskrit. It is likely that an archaic form of Tocharian was also spoken near Kashmir. In addition, we know that in the Mauryan period and slightly earlier, certain dialects of Greek (such as Yavana

 i.e. Ionic

) were also spoken due to the greek invasion of Persia and North-Western India. Old-vedic (the dialects of the Ṛgveda) may itself have originally been spoken as multiple closely related Indo-iranian languages (with the oldest vedic mantras possibly composed originally in the parent indo-iranian itself).
