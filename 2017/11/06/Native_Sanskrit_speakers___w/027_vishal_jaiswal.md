Can someone please enumerate (or point me to a resource/thread that lists) the entire set of differences between simplified Sanskrit (as propagated by samskrita bharati in written/spoken forms) and real Sanskrit as it exists (in written form).

  

I am not asking about the reasons for the same, I just want a list of the differences from the perspective of grammar.

  

Thanks,

Vishal
