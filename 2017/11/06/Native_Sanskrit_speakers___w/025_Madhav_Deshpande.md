Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  Thank you for your beautiful summary of a very complicated situation of Sanskrit, variety of forms of Sanskrit, and other co-existing languages/dialects. The standardization of Sanskrit, following the Pāṇinian norm, is somewhat like the standardization of languages like Marathi with the beginning of standardized textbooks that began to be produced during the British period. Such efforts at standardization hide the reality of actual language variation. There is of course variation build in the Pāṇinian description of Sanskrit itself. Those interested may consult Paul Kiparsky's book: Pāṇini as a Variationist. The best single publication on language/dialect variation in Indo-Aryan (including Sanskrit and Vedic) is the volume titled "Dialectes dans les Littératures Indo-Aryennes," a collection of conference papers edited by Colette Caillat, published in Paris in 1989. With best wishes,
