Achyut Karve ji, there are several incidences in various Sanskrit texts, including Vedic texts, that indicate that it has always been possible to make out the native place of a person based on how he spoke. So it is no surprise that we see influence of the regional language on Sanskrit or English spoken by the people.  
  
But that should not mean there are no 'native' Sanskrit speakers today. There are many children whose first language is none other than Sanskrit.  
  
The question is whether there are such people who speak Sanskrit since childhood with sandhi as described by Panini.
