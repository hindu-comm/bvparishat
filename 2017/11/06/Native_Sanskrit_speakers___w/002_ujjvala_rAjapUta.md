नमस्ते श्रीपादमहोदय।  
  
I have seen several videos showing conversation among people from the Sanskrit-speaking villages. But in what I saw, I did not find sandhi happening properly.  
  
Sanskrit Bharati teaches spoken Sanskrit without sandhi (in most places). However, I feel that allowing sandhi to happen can make speaking Sanskrit easier and faster. Sandhi should not be something that is supposed to be learned only when one becomes a scholar. Probably, kids who see elders speaking with sandhi will learn it right from their very first utterances and sandhi might become very natural for them and bring an ease in overall language learning. On the other hand, we can't expect kids to do sandhi when they are used to hearing to discrete words, because while learning language children try to imitate elders as closely as they can, however difficult it may be.  
  
These are just my assumptions and please inform me if I am wrong somewhere.
