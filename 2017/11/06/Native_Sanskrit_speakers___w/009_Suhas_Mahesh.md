I have had interest in this matter from quite some time, as I find the unsandhied visarga ('aha,' as we karṇātas do it) extremely awkward and want to purge it from my own speech. I don't believe being a native speaker has anything to do with sandhied speech. We just pick up whatever we hear— sandhied or unsandhied. I know a few native speakers, the most prominent being Udayana Hegde (also on this list). However, I have not seen any of them (or indeed, anyone in my life) consistently performing अपृथग्यत्ननिर्वृत्त sandhi in real time. Vowel sandhis are more natural, and scholars sometimes make them. However, inexplicably, even 'easy' visarga sandhis are often ignored. For instance, H.V. Nagaraj Rao whooftenmanages to spin out complex लुङ् forms in real time, says सः instead of स. Sri Bharati Tirtha Swamiji produces (inconsistenly) almost all the common sandhis in an extempore speech on Youtube. I think it is reasonable to believe sandhied Sanskrit is no longer transmitted from mouth to mouth anywhere. However, if anyone is interested in reviving a reasonably sandhied form of Sanskrit, I am all for it.
