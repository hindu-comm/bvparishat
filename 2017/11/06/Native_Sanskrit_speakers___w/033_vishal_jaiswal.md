Arvind ji, thank you for the clarification.

  

I never implied that there are any flaws. I know that simple Sanskrit is a proper subset of classical Sanskrit.

  

Let me make my question precise,

What grammatical constructs and features are missing in simple Sanskrit, that are of course present in classical Sanskrit.

Sandhi is one such feature.

I want to know about all the other ones that were kept aside to keep things simple.

Hope to hear on this.

  

Vishal
