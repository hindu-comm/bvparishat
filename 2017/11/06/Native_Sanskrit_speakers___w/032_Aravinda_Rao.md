There is absolutely no difference Vishal ji, It is like the difference between the English of a high school student and the English of a post-graduate. I have also done my Ph.D in Vedanta and can say with some authority that there is no difference in syntax, rules of grammar etc. You may examine it for yourself and discover any flaws.

I am not a spokesperson for Sanskrit Bharathi but I love the organization for all the service they are doing.
