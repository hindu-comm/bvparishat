\>the usage of Sanskrit language is limited to a few scholars and was never the main language of the masses. Sanskrit language doesn't have the flexibility as does other languages have in terms of absorbing or coining of new words.

  

-------------- This misunderstanding about Sanskrit has been repeatedly discussed in this forum and elsewhere time and again. Thought, does not hurt to discuss it again here in this context.   

  

1. Standard dialect is the variety of a language that is used by a language group for the purposes common to all the speakers of the language across its various regions where it is spoken in the form of various regional dialects and across its various social strata where it is spoken as social dialects. For example, the variety of Kannada that is used by all the people of Kannada for the purposes such as use in print and electronic media, contemporary literary works, text books, official communication etc. is called standard Kannada. (standard not in the sense of respectable or authentic but in the sense of uniform and relatively slower in change than dialects ). Sanskrit was such a standard form and Prakrits were the regional dialects of the same language.

  

2. Do we say Kannada is the main language of the masses; it has two forms : standard and the dialectal or do we say standard Kannada is never the main language of the masses only dialectal Kannada is the language of the masses? We say the first, i.e.,Kannada is the main language of the masses; it has two forms : standard and the dialectal. Similarly, we should recognize that 'Sanskrit/ Prakrit' is a single , one and the same language, the main language of the masses with two forms: the standard called Sanskrit and the dialectal called Prakrit(s).

  

3. Does standard Kannada absorb more non-Kannada words or the dialects borrow more non-Kannada words? standard Kannada has more Sanskrit and English borrowings than the regional dialects. Similarly, Sanskrit has more Greek and other borrowings than Prakrits. Does coinage of new terms happen more in standard Kannada or its regional dialects? It happens more in standard Kannada. In the same way coinage of new terms happened and has been happening more in Sanskrit

  

--------------------------------------------

  

\>If one says Prakrit is'Sanskrit/ Prakrit' is a single , one and the same languagethen one can say there exists only a few languages in India apart from Sanskrit. The answer is begging the question.

  

If you are looking at today's multiple Indian languages and are imagining that 'Sanskrit/Prakrit is a single language' is against this fact, the mistake is in bringing today's data as counter to the statement 'Sanskrit/Prakrit is a single language' which is about a situation many centuries older.

  

Even during the period when the single language called Sanskrit/Prakrit was spoken, apart from this (single) language other vibhaashaas, dEs'abhaashaas, bhaashaas of the nishaada and other human groups which did not have genetic connection with the (single) language Sanskrit-Prakrit were spoken in India and were spoken of in ancient Sanskrit and Prakrit literature. In modern parlance, these bhaashaas may refer to the languages of Dravidian, Austroasiatic, Sinotibetan families and some other languages outside these families.

  

Please remember that different languages of the same language family are believed /theorized to be once dialects of the same language which in course of evolution develop into mutually unintelligible entities and as a result, turn out to be /are called as different languages.

  

The same happened to the dialects of the (single) language Sanskrit -Prakrit. The dialects called Prakrits of this language, in course of evolution, changed into several mutually unintelligible entities and thus became different languages which are the ancient forms of the older versions of the contemporary north Indian languages.

  

' Sanskrit is fixed ' etc. are naive understandings of nature of languages. No language is fixed.

  

Books like "Evolution of the Sanskrit language from Pāṇini to Patañjali " bySureshachandra Dnyaneshwar Laddu and many similar works provide evidence for evolution of Sanskrit from time to time.

  

Apart from this, Sanskrit expressions getting rusticized into Prakrit expressions and Prakrit expressions getting 'refined' into Sanskrit expressions was a perpetual two way process. As such, one of them changing/evolving, the other notchanging/evolving is improbable and even impossible.

  

Modern researchers talk of substrata of other languages in Rigveda itself and talk more freely of such substrata in laukika Sanskrita. Viewing Sanskrit as some insulated entity, retaining its 'pure' uninflunced and uninfluencable form is considered to be against the spirit of modern research.

  

------------------------------------------

  

\>This is a possible theory that has been proposed that There was only one language in India (leaving south India and may smaller regions of out ) that was Sanskrit and that language evolved to many languages that India has.

  

--That can be better worded as follows:

  

There was a period in Indian history when major geographical area of the Indic subcontinent, particularly its northern part had speakers of one single language, standard variety of which is (today being) called Sanskrit and the dialects of which are (today being) called Prakrits. The dialects of this language evolved into different languages that are being spoken in the northern parts of the Indic subcontinent.

  

\>This is a good theory which is highly debatable and problematic.

  

--This is not a theory but a fact staring into the observer's face. Evidences:

  

1. If the language situation reflected in Sanskrit plays, viz., Sanskrit speaker speaking to Prakrit speaker and vice versa with mutual intelligibility and Prakrit used there always being suited to Sanskrit chaayaa with a small change of sounds, was not the reality at any part of Indian history, the plays would not have been received by their readers /audience as reflecting sociolinguistic reality. If there is a reality of that kind, the two forms of language can not be considered as two different languages.

  

2. Books like Vakyapadiyam dealing with language issue always treated the two as different versions of the same language.

  

\>When one asks the question how did that one Language became many

  

--- That question is not asked because researchers do not move from that one language to the many languages. They start from the many different languages of north India and trace their history. When they keep moving backwards into the various stages through which these many different languages evolved, they are bound to reach a stage where the ancestral forms of these languages were nothing but the Prakrits, the dialects of a language, standard form of which was Sanskrit.Since no one is saying that it is Sanskrit, the standard form which evolved into many language, since what is being said is that it is the different dialects of that language which evolved into many different languages, there is no scope for such a question.

  

\>why that one language remained fixed and remained static all the time.

  

--That one language is not just the standard form called Sanskrit but its dialects called Prakrits too. So that one language remained fixed is not a fact.

  

Even if one understands your statement as 'the standard form of that language called Sanskrit remained fixed, it is not a correct understanding. All standard forms of all languages are slow in their change compared to their dialects. This slowness in change may give the impression of no change. But it is just a false impression. Not a fact.

  

It is this impression/claim of no change in the literary or classical variety of languages such as Telugu and Kannada,that was contested and countered by the leaders of the spoken language movements that arose during the advent of modern period. Those who opposed the spoken language movements and advocated the continuance of the literary variety, (at least in the case of Telugu ) argued that the greatness of the literary variety was that it remained static /unchanged through the course of centuries of history. The leaders of the spoken language movement (at least in Telugu) published well argued and well substantiated pieces establishing that the literary variety underwent change at every stage of its history. This awareness that languages , even their literary varieties, can not remain static and to understand the histories of languages was considered to be the gift of modern research to humanity.

  

In the same spirit, to consider that Sanskrit remained static can be viewed as contrary to the spirit of modern research.

  

What is ironical is that the understanding of those of the modern researchers who consider Sanskrit to have remained without change, make the same claim as the target of ridicule, viz., traditional Sanskrit scholars who consider remaining unchanged as the greatness of Sanskrit achieved thanks to the power of anus'aasana of Panini's grammar.

  

Those of the modern researchers who take pride in being historicists or historical researchers of language take pride in disproving the claim of the traditional scholars that Panini could bring in unchangeability to Sanskrit.

  

Grammars like all other tools of language standardization do certainly contribute to slowing the change in the standard form but they can never completely arrest the change in that language. Panini's grammar is no exception to this.
