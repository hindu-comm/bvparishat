Dhanyavaad Nagaraj ji,

I would like to know more about point #1 .

  

Specifically, what grammatical constructs/features are not covered for beginners,

As well as,

What grammatical constructs are not used in the written samskrita bharati publications, which are common otherwise.

I just know there are two such things,

Sandhi and idioms.
