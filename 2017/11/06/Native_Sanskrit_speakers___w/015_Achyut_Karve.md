Dear Scholars,

The following HNBhatji's comments echoes a well known English dictum  
"Grammar does not a man make."

"Not only rules of Sandhi, but other grammar rules, are not expected to be learnt for a native speaker of Sanskrit, if learnt from native speakers. Nor languages spoken from childhood, are seen to be learnt by learning grammar of the language. Why specifically for Sanskrit the
rules of Sandhi? In native speakers of any language is using Sandhi rules naturally applicable to the language spoken. We learn grammar in schools only and not for speaking the language."

But does the above dictum apply to Sanskrit? Does not Patanjali in the first anhik not list the benefits of learning grammar and the curse that would ensue if one does not study it?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve
