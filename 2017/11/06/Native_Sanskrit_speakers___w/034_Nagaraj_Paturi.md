Dear Sri Vishal-ji,

  

The difference is of two kinds :

  

1\. Between the Sarala Samskritam taught for the beginners and the regular Samskritam that is the version where the student is introduced to all the features of the language.

  

2\. Between the idiom of Sanskrit that is found among the scholars who speak Sanskrit from the traditional gurukula background and the idiom of the Samskrita Bharati trained speakers. Because it is the difference in the style or idiom of speaking, grammatical correctness is the same on both sides.

  

Another difference probably is between the style of textual Sanskrit and the spoken Sanskrit. The differences under #2 above are within the spoken Sanskrit only.
