Dear Ujjwalji,

Each language has an inertia which can popularly be called a flow of words. Children tend to capture this flow of words and speak. We find that in virtually all languages the world over a meaningful sentence is made up discreet words and is spoken so too.

In the case of Sanskrit on account of vedic literature which is recited in Samhita form it is expected that words in a sentence also should be spoken in Samhita form that is with sandhi.

My question is whether non usage of sandhi renders the words (पद) in a sentence discreet. If they don't then using sandhi rules in speech need not be mandatory.

Further in many recitations we find that reciting strictly according to print (where in some cases the words are joined by applying sandhi rules or where the words are separately written) in fact not only affects but in some cases distorts the padas.

However there is a tendency in spoken (non formal) languages to join words in speech.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
