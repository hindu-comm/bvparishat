Dear Ujjwalji,

"The question is whether there are such people who speak Sanskrit since childhood with sandhi as described by Panini."

Why should we not ask the question to ourselves as to why do those who speak Sanskrit from childhood not speak with sandhi? Is speaking with sandhi natural to Sanskrit or an elitist view of Sanskrit speech?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
