Dear Scholars,

What is the alphabet of Sanskrit? Devnagari is the script not the alphabet. Native Sanskrit speakers speak Sanskrit by aligning it with their native tongues. Thus one can easily make out the native tongue while one is speaking Sanskrit just as one can make out the native tongue of a person when he is speaking English.

In short as on date there exists no native tongue in respect of Sanskrit. If there was any it needs to be resurrected.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
