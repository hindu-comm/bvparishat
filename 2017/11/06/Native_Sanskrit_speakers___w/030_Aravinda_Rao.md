Dear Vishal ji,

I have acquaintance with the Samskrita Bharathi almost right from its inception. I should confess that I answered my grammar paper in my M.A Skt examination mainly with the help of the booklets published by Samskrita Bharathi. As pointed out by Sri Udayana, it is simple Sanskrit which is used and it is in perfect conformitywith the grammar of Panini. I have seen their latest books too, and they are a marvellous improvement on the earlier books.

Some modicum of mastery of Sanskrit idiom can be achieved only after a regular study of the books published by them in addition to study of classical texts.

Regards,

Aravinda Rao
