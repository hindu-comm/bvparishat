Dear Ramkrishnanji,

You have addressed the problematic of the origin of Sanskrit in a very comprehensive manner.

If I am not wrong

"For there to exist a standardized form of the language, there should be multiple non-standard forms that are in use. The very existence of Pāṇini's grammatical standard is itself the most potent proof of there having been multiple dialects of spoken sanskrit in the late-vedic period."

the above passage means that till the time of Panini there was a process of crystallization taking place in the usage of Sanskrit which Panini has addressed through his Ashtadhyayi. Is it also true that in the period immediately after Panini Sanskrit experienced a process of decadence which is evident in the later commentaries which prefer to differ from the views of Panini.

Such type of crystallization and decadence is also to be seen in the arts where no sooner a particular art form reaches its zenith it begins to degenerates.

This has also happened with the tabla of which I am a student.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
