Dear Scholars,

Was Sanskrit ever a mother tongue of a people? Is there any evidence to the affect?

In my opinion it was never a mother tongue. Any effort to make it one would obviously lead to corrupting the language resulting in a new apabhransh tongue.

"of. Madhav Deshpande's response:

Dear Nagarajji,

Your comments are absolutely on the dot. The propogated home Sanskrit is a wonderful experiment in detecting the interaction between the actual mother-tongue like Hindi or Kannada, and the acquired second language like Sanskrit. A Marathi friend of mine who tries to speak Sanskrit once said: "स: परस्परं गत:" with the intended meaning "He went directly \[without stopping here\]." This usage became possible because the word परस्पर in Marathi has that meaning, though Sanskrit does not classically have this meaning for this expression. "  
  

The above is the product of over enthusiasm in speaking Sanskrit without regard to the nuances of its Grammar.

Sanskrit to my belief is a language crafted for protecting knowledge through an oral tradition. Therefore non adherence to Grammar rules has the likelihood of rendering all the literature it contains useless in the future.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
