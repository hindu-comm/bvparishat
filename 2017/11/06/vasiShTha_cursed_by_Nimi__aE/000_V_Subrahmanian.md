Namaste

  

In the Brahmasutra Bhashya 3.4.32, Shankaracharya cites an instance of Vasiṣṭha being cursed by Nimi and later taking birth as Mitrāvaruṇa:

  

वसिष्ठश्च ब्रह्मणो मानसः पुत्रः सन् निमिशापादपगतपूर्वदेहः पुनर्ब्रह्मादेशान्मित्रावरुणाभ्यां सम्बभूवेति

  

I would like to know where this story occurs, whether in only only source or many texts. One retelling of this story is here:

The source of the story is not given here. Hence this request.
