Some loud thinking =>

1.  The quote विष्णुस्त्रेधा निदधे पदम्can be suggestive of विष्णु
    occupying Heaven, Earth and Hell स्वर्लोक, भूलोक, पाताळलोक, that
    way, the entire universe.  
2.  The context could be of वामनावतार when विष्णु asked King बलि to make
    space available for putting 3 steps. Having transgressed स्वर्लोक
    and पाताळलोक in two steps, बलि had to offer his own head for the
    third step. His own head meant भूलोक, which बलि commanded as his
    empire. 3.  What would be etymological or grammatical analysis of त्रेधा if same
    meaning is of त्रिधा ? 4.  Is निदधे (लिटि प्र.पु. एक. of निधा) ?
