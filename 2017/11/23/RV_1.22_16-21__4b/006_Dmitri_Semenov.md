Sorry, I misunderstood your idea, thus, upon realizing it, deleted my message.  
  
What you propose might be possible in the context of one stanza.
However, three steps (padaani) of Vishnu are mentioned in several other places in RV,  
so to allow interpretation you proposed it shall fit well with other occurrences.
