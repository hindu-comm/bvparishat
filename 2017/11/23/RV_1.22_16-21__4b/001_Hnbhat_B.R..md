16 The Gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence Viṣṇu strode  
Through the seven regions of the earth!  
17 Through all this world strode Viṣṇu; thrice his foot he planted, and the whole  
Was gathered in his footstep's dust.  
footstep's dust.  
18 Viṣṇu, the Guardian, he whom none deceiveth, made three steps; thenceforth  
Establishing his high decrees.  
19 Look ye on Viṣṇu's works, whereby the Friend of Indra, close-allied,  
Hath let his holy ways be seen.  
20 The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Viṣṇu is,  
Laid as it were an eye in heaven.  
21 This, Viṣṇu's station most sublime, the singers, ever vigilant,  
Lovers of holy song, light up.
