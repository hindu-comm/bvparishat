Respected members,

  

The B.Ed syllabus of Bangalore University with Sanskrit specialisation prescribes the following books for their course

  

1. Teaching of Sanskrit by Apte.D.G, Bombay padma publications

2. Problems of teaching Sanskrit by Huprikar G.S.

  

Can anyone help with the soft copy of these books. They are out of publication now and unavailable at any libraries here

  

Thanking you

  

Srivalli Anand
