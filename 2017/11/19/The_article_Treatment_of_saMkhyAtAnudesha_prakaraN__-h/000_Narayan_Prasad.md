Respected scholars,

  

  I presented my paper mentioned under the subject above at thethe AIOC, 44th session, Kurukshetra , 28-30 July, 2008. It is 9 pp. A4 size long in 12 point Times New Roman.

  

Most probably I had submitted for publication in JOIB, but I am not sure, because I cannot trace any correspondence with its Director.

  

If at all it was published, it might be in Vol.58 to 61. These volumes are not available at BORI.

  

If it was not published, I can send it for publication in JOIB. If it was published, I would like to get a scanned copy.

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad

*Summary of the above paper*

  

संख्यातानुदेश is the application respectively of terms stated in the उद्देश्य and विधेय portions in their numerical order when the stated terms are equal in number. Páõini prescribes it under the sítra यथासंख्यमनुदेशः समानाम् (P.1.3.10). 



Based on the present author’s “Concordance of Nine Sanskrit Grammars” \[1\], a comparative study of the treatment of संख्यातानुदेश in the Post-Páõinian Systems of Sanskrit Grammar is presented. The nine grammars considered are पाणिनि, कातन्त्र, चान्द्र, both recensions of जैनेन्द्र grammar (with महावृत्ति and लघुवृत्ति or शब्दार्णवचन्द्रिका respectively), शाकटायन, भोज, हेमचन्द्र and मलयगिरि. Comparison of the sítras of these grammars indicates that different systems may be classified into two groups - the first group consists of चान्द्र, शाकटायन and मलयगिरि grammars that discard this प्रकरण, whereas the remaining systems constitute the second group, which retain it in the सूत्रपाठ or परिभाषापाठ. The कातन्त्र has it in the कातन्त्रपरिभाषासूत्रवृत्ति of दुर्गसिंह and भावमिश्र, whereas हेमचन्द्र lists it among one of the 57 paribháúás at the end of his बृहद्‌वृत्ति.



The defects of P.1.3.10 in the various sítras of the अष्टाध्यायी has been discussed in detail in the महाभाष्य. Although the post-Páõinian systems have tried to minimise the defects of संख्यातानुदेश as discussed in the महाभाष्य, none of them have succeeded in removing the defects completely and the readers have to resort to the commentary for clarification.
