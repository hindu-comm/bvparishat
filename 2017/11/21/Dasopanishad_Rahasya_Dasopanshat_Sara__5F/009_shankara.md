Dr. Dash mahodaya,

  

It was helpful. Thank you very much.  

I got information about the following Upanishatsara texts from it.  

  

1\. Upanishadartha Sara Samgraha by Tarakabrahmanandayati, disciple of Raghavananda. 39 stanzas, mostly in Salini metre, giving the advaitic essence of Taittiriyopanishad and celebrating Rama as the impersonal Brahman, after the fashion of Ramatapani. Adyar Up. p. 191

  

(It is not clear what is meant by 'Adyar Up. p. 191. Is it reference number of a manuscript or printed edition?)  

  
2. Upanishatsarasamgraha with vyakhya (vidvanmanohara) by Subrahmanya, son of Sarvesara, of the Mindi Somayaji family and pupil of Venkata Pandita. MT 2182 (with C). 2497.  
  

I got information about one more text from another source.

  

3\. Bodhananda Gita A metrical epitome of the 10 Upanisads in 12 chapters by Bodhananda, pupil of Brahmanandayati. Printed Kalpathi 1909.

  

Though the 3rd one, Bodhananda Gita was published in 1909, it could not be found in any of the digital libraries on the internet.

shankara
