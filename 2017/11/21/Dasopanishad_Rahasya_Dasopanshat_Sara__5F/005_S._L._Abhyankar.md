There are two very scholarly books by revered philosopher saint गुरुदेव रानडे founder of Adhyaatma Vidyaapeeth at Nimbal - (1) Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy (2) Vedanta, The Culmination of Indian Thought

  

The second one, although has the word Vedanta in its title, it covers in its compass, philosophical thoughts from Buddhism, Jainism, Saamkhya, Nyaaya, Meemaamsaa, etc.
