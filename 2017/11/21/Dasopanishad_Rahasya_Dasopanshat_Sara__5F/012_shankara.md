Namaste,

  

First two texts are not yet published; their manuscripts are preserved in various centres, details of which are available at [namami.org](http://namami.org) and also in New Catalogus Catalogorum.  

  

3rd text was published in 1909 from Kalpathy, Kerala. But, I could not find its copy anywhere on the internet. I request anyone having access to it, to kindly share its scan, if possible.  

  

regards  
shankara
