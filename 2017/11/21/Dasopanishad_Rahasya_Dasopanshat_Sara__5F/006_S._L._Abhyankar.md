There is book "अष्टादशी" by Vinoba Bhave. It gives verse-by-verse translation of 18 Upanishat's. There is another book by Vinoba Bhave "उपनिषदांचा अभ्यास" i.e. Study of Upanishat's. There is yet another book ईशावास्यवृत्ति actually a commentary on ईशावास्य because the word वृत्ति connotes commentary, apart from its lingual meaning as "way of life - ईशावास्य as way of life.

  

What I have with me are books in Marathi. But they might have been translated into other languages.

  

It may turn out to be a good idea to put together शाङ्करभाष्य-son different Upanishat's. Actually every शाङ्करभाष्य is replete with quotations from other Upanishat's.
