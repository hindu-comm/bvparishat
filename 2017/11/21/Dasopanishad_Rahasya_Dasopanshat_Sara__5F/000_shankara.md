Pranams to all,

  

Attaching Dasopanishad Rahasya and Dasopanishat Sara. I would like to know if there are any other texts that deal with essence of Upanishads.  

  

Dasopanishad Rahasya is extracted from the book 'Upanishat Sri' - Anthology of Articles on Upanishads available online at <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.273637>  

  

regards  
shankara
