In yuddhakANDa, after 106 shlokas in last sarva, where it starts to say

धर्म्यं यशस्यमायुष्यं it seems not part of vAlmIki words, but by later compilers.

It says "this is rishi spoken adi kavya ramayana, created byaharshi valmiki in past...."

This won't have been original Valmiki himself.

  

The part of writing the ramayana is more a mAhAtmya, what one gets by reading, reciting, chanting and writing the Ramayana.  
  
So I won't like to consider this shloka that you quoted, as proof of script.

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
