Namaste,  
  
Could the organizers of SI 2 please make a copy of the paper by Subhodeep Mukhopadhayay available? I would really like to read the complete paper with references on his comparisons of Gaṇita Śāstra & Western Mathematics as soon as possible. (It does not have to completely edited or anything. The basic content with references is what I am looking for)  
  
Anticipating a quick response,  
Dhanyawadam
