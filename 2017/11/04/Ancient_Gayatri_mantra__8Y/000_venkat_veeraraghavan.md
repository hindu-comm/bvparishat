<https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/pralaya-das-sage-of-narmada-tat-of-20th-century-regarding-gayatri-mantra>  

  

Dear learned ones:

  

Please view the above link.

It is an English rendering of the relevant part of "Tapobhumi Narmada" a pathbreaking book with certain startling claims.

  

There are some corrections in the text for ex: the Rshi of the said rk is actually śyāvāśva ātreya. And the meter is anushtup.

  

Is there any other source that claims that the said mantra by the above Rshi was the ancient gāyatri?

  

Thanks
