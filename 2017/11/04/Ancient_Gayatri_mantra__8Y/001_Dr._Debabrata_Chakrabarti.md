Dear List,

There is also a Dvadasaguru Mantra by Lakshman Deshika as propounded by the sage Pralaya Dasa. I tried to search the source but failed. Could anybody give me any clue?

If anybody chants it he is able to perform pranayama and kriya in the main along with some other pranamas to deities.

Regards

Debabrata Chakrabarti
