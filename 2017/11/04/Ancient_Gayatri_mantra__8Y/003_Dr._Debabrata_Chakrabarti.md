Dear Sir,

I am sorry to say that I am unaware of any link whatsoever. The book is written in Bengali and one has to glean from it the mantra and its implications. It has been said by Pralaya Das that Dvadashaguru mantramala is a Pranama Mantra, and if it is chanted, it enables you to please Ma Narmada, Bhavanishakti, Hari, Hara, Vishnu-adi all Devashakti-s and Divyashakti-s. If this mantramala arises in one's mind at the time of death, one attains Brahmi Avastha.

For further details one has to go through the book.

Regards

Debabrata Chakrabarti
