Hello:

  

Are any of the learned members aware of (or know of people) who are experts in constructing Yantras? I have some doubts that need clarification on the 1-1 relationship between mantra and yantra.

  

Also were there yantras for Vedic mantras or is this a new development along with tantra?

  

Thanks,
