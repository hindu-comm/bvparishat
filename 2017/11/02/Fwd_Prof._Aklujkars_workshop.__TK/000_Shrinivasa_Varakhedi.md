Dear sir,

  

Praṇām.  

  

We, at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, are hosting Prof. Ashok Aklujkar's workshop on "Philosophy of Language". It is a one-day workshop that will be held on World Philosophy Day (16 November 2017).During the morning session, Prof. Aklujkar will address the audience aboutBhartṛhari's line of thought and its significance in a general context. In the afternoon sessions, he will engage the audience with a reading from the original text (Brahmakāṇḍa only).

  

Sir, I'm writing to request you to personally inform the students of KSU about this workshop, and request the interested students to attend the same (although it is a working day). Prof. Aklujkar has worked with theVākyapadīya for decades - it is sure to benefit students who are interested in understanding Indian thought.  

  

Kindly oblige.

  

Gratefully,

Manjushree.
