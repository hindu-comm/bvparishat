hariH OM,

  

 You may have a look at the following sUtras of aShTAdhyAyI to start with:

उदात्तादनुदात्तस्य स्वरितः - 8-4-65

स्वरितात्संहितायामनुदात्तानाम् - 1-2-39

  

 When anudAtta follows udAtta (in pada pATha), the udAtta becomes a svarita in saMhitA. Any anudAttas succeeding a svarita become ekashruti. For an introduction to this you may read aShTAdhyaayii prathamAvRRitti, specially the explanation in parishiShTa of 1.2.36 for prakriyaa with an example.

  

 To understand svaraprakriyaa fully, one will have to work with both saMhitA and pada pAThas under able guidance of an AcArya.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                             shrivathsa.
