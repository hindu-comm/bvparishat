Dear Deshpandeji/Shrivathsaji,

Thanks for the pdf.

It is heartening to learn that intonation markings have first to be marked in the pada patha before they are marked on the Samhita. This is a great clue. The tabla compositions therefore need to be first split into phrases duly marked with intonation before they are assembled into Samhita form.

Further on the difference between accent and intonation. Accent is related to stress whereas intonation is related to pitch. My experience tells me that intonation is achieved by manipulating the larynx. Can I get any reference in this regard?

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
