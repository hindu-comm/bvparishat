Namaste



I seem to be missing something here: \< Accents- Intonations ‘ and ‘ Pada-PAtha before Samhitaa’.



**Reason: **

(i) The ‘Accents’ and ‘ intonations’ ( The concept of ‘Swara’ and ‘Sthana-Prayatna’ in Samskrutham goes back to ‘ Vedas’ / Pratishaakhyas - Shikshaa shastras way before ‘ known work of Panini.



(ii) Great volumes of literature in Samskrutham existed side by side with and without ‘Accents’ and ‘ intonations’ . The Kavyas , the Shaastras and Vedas .



(iii) The rules for ‘Accents’ and ‘ intonations’ wre analyzed way before the known models of line symbols came in to writing - in Vedas or msic ( Earliest known models being Natya Shaastra / Artha Shaastra).
Lipi-Shaastra is a later design after the ‘ Uccharana – Shikhshaa Shaastra’. Therefore, Panini and Patanjali focuses primarily on ‘ Articualtion’ rather than ‘Script design’. It is ‘Artha Shaastra’ whihspeaks about the ‘ scripting need and clue on it. But then ‘Artha –Shaastra’ s not dealing with the Vedas; it is dealing with social business ( saamjika vyavahara/ Aakshi Vyavahaara).



(iv) ‘Intonations ( Swara = udaatta and the rest ) come Primarily in ‘Samhita’ where the ‘Varna-maalaa’ has already got the ‘ Stana-Prayatna’ clarity well defined.



(v) Pada-Patha as a ‘Vikritui’ patha is traditionally believed to be derived from ‘Samhitaa’; which does not look at the ‘ History’ as the oriental scholars frame on Vedas. At least in Panini, the Samhita takes precedence over all the Vikruti Pathas. Why tradition should be right or other wise – is a separate issue for debate. It is deeply connected with the views related to ‘ Historcity’ which goes deep and ante the period of Vyasa – Valmiki.



(vi) ‘Accent and Intonation’ primarily goes by Voice mechanism usage and audition : Production and sensing the sound as Speakers conscious effort . The writing is an independent effort and discipline . The debate on writing needs a study of scripting systems, writing amterials in India; a muddled topic with overtones linked to decoding of IVC
symbols, Framing of Aryan- Dravidian invasion and divide. 



(vii) All known works seemingly guiding the ‘ line marking – Horizontal /vertical / duplexed on the given ‘ Brahmi (Devanagari / Nandi Nagari / Grantha) script symbol’ is of very late origin.



(viii) Different intonation of Vowels and rules related to it are ‘ Mantra’ related; and are considered ‘sacred’. The shift in ‘swara’ in articulation – in Samhitaa or Vikruti PAtas or even across Vedas is considered a disaster ( at least up to known history of Vedic teaching in Gurukula in South, up to late 20^(th) century).



(ix) What happens to Swaras flowing in a sequence and coming in ‘ Closest proximity that may cause a coalescence ( parah sannikarshah samhitaa ; sandhi )’ and how the articulation output is pronounced
and sensed by the speaker and listener is a ‘ SWARA- YOGA’ issue. I am on the look out and eager to look for scholars who can explain the ‘Swara-Sandhi ( beyond Varna-akshara)’ where the udaataa –anudaataa etc; get ‘ Coalesced’. And its effect. This is of great importance for ‘Mantras’.



Help appreciated.
