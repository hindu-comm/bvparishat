Dear Shrivathsaji,

Thank you for the our response.

I am in the process of marking intonations for the compositions of the tabla. There is no precedent to this attempt. As such I would like to know if there are specific rules regarding intonation in Sanskrit grammar. I will surely read the relevant portion of the Ashtadhyayi cited by you.

What is the difference between ekshruti and swarita? To my knowledge ekshruti is defined as  
ऐकश्रुतिदूरातसंबुद्धौ meaning it is the sound of a vowel made while we call. And swarita is समाहारस्वरित:.

I am grateful to you for the guidance you have given.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
