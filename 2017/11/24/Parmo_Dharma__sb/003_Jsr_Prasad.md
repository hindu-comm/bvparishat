Dr. Ravi ji,

  

Alternatively, why not we popularize our own terms (rather concepts!) in English? This is not to discourage from your current requirement. The word अहिंसा has Yogic connotations and धर्म has Dharmashastra connotations. I would rather prefer to translate it as '*Ahimsa* is the highest *Dharma.*

Thanks
