The sentence 'अहिंसा परमो धर्मः' occurs several times in several different contexts in Mahabharata.

  

The word परमः, as explained by Prof. Korada, is used in a comparative sense to indicate superlative degree, to mean 'among various Dharmas , ahimsaa is the highest.'

  

Dharma = duty is only one of many meanings of Dharma.

  

Dharma = nature, feature, property, principle of nature, quality;

  

But that does not suit here.

  

Dharma = which holds (everything together), which sustains (everything), etymologically.

  

Even that does not suit here.

  

Dharma = ethical norm,

Dharma = principle of ethics,

Dharma =basis of ethical judgement

  

अहिंसा परमो धर्मः goes well with meanings like  

  

Dharma = duty

Dharma = ethical norm,

Dharma = principle of ethics,

Dharma =basis of ethical judgement .

  

So one may translateअहिंसा परमो धर्मः as

  

(when faced with a choice among various duties, ethical norms and/or bases of ethical judgement ), ahimsaa = non-violence is the most fundamental/ultimate of all theduties, ethical norms and/or bases of ethical judgement. All otherduties, ethical norms and/or bases of ethical judgement are to be evaluated on the touch-stone of ahimsaa.

  

Our ancient literature gives such a status to each of other aspects of dharma like satyam etc. depending on the context.
