Prof Prasadji,

Namaste.

You have done a great service to the community by posting your vivid recollection of the event. We enjoyed the event vicariously.In terms of knowledge management, placing on record proceedings of such a scholarly event is no less important than the event itself. Your suggestions are very valid.Many thanks.
