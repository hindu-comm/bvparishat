Namah sarvebhyah.

I have a few points.

  

1\. On the presentation by prof. Jaddipal there was hue and cry about
difficulty in obtainingmanuscript copies from libaries. We have put a small step towards this. One letter was drafted and signed by all participants there adressing prime minister to interven. I have attached the copy of signed letter for your perusal so yo too can join there. You can write this letter I independently too.

  

2\. There was a good discussion on which language to be used for thesis. Most of the scholars supported sanskrit for this purpose, though there may be a few people to understand it. Pr. Aklujkar told- my generation has suffered from this problem. This is the only last chance to protect the language. We should not waste it. We should urge different departments to allow to submit in samskrit.

  

3\. What is the research model of India?

Dr. R Ganesh emphasized on anubhavaadhaarita reseach in core areas of humanities.

There were discussions on Aagamaadharita and intuition based reseach.

Some yukti based, kriya, tapasya, samadhi,

  

4.Interdisciplinary studies.

Dr. Vinay chandra emphasized multidisciplinary studies like psychology, temple architecture, ancient indian history.

  

5\. Dr. Kannan told that we should study various shastras. Vocabulary is a kry factor for creative thinking. Einstein factor book.

  

6, international publication standards

7 response to attacks.

  

8\. My emphasize was on the regular creative mode of indian thinkers. No shastra was a static. We need to be creative in this good time.

  

  

although we thought to organize such workshop for KSU students only, later it was opened for all.People need it, we learnt it.

Overall there was a great response from reseach students across india.  

  

It is my opinion that by organizing such workshops twice a year we would be able inculcate some standard conscious in our students.

  

There was a demand for graduate students seminar, a yearly affair. I hope we would be able to do it soon. Last year KSU and PPSM organized such a seminar.

We have audio recordings of most of the presentations.

I thank all students and resource persons for making this workshop a great success.
