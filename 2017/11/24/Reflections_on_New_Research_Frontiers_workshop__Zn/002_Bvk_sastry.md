Namaste

Due to my travel , I missed participation in this wonderful Indian Samskruth scholars initiative.

  

I am curious and eager to know whether the workshop provided any clues to explore the bhaarateeya answers to the question:

‘ शास्त्र-संशोधनं कथं करणीयम्? किमर्थं ?’ राष्ट्र-हितं कथं अनुसन्धेयम्?

How to conduct the technical Shaastra- research ? For what benefit? And for National prosperity?

  

All the detailed line items i see in the report covers  Action points
covering ‘research for academic scholarship and employment in the ivory towers of institutions’ which , again depends upon ‘ policy for public exchequer tax- payer money spending and consumption’ and ‘ grant providers wish fulfillment through research’.

  

This is neither the Applied research model of west nor the ‘ tapas’ model of Bhaarath! The outline is a gist of how religion research is undertaken in seminaries by faith- committed and ordained professionals’.

  

If my understanding is off the target, please help me to regain the ‘ right understanding of Shaastra-Samshodhana paddhati’.

  

P.S. i am not against the tradition or an outsider. I am asking a clarification pl.
