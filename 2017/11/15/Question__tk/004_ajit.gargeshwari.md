One probably can cite [archive.org](http://archive.org) permanent url associated with the item for citation.  
  
Most often an up-loader to [archives.org](http://archives.org) assumes that they hurt none in the process which might be, always the intent of any up-loader. When one is scanning in bulk there is no way to verify individual books or articles copy-write status. Probably there should be a data base from which one can verify copy-write status of published materials. I don't know why such a database doesn't exist. How does one balance genuine preservation needs off libraries and simultaneously make such materials accessible to all.  
  
Many [archive.org](http://archive.org) up-loaders do have strange names.Why do up-loaders hide their real names and upload is question one needs to ask. Why do [archives.org](http://archives.org) allow such uploads in obviously fictitious names?  
  
One answer might be that enthusiasts who upload at [archives.org](http://archives.org) would not have got any permission from the custodian of the materials they scan to make public uploads.
