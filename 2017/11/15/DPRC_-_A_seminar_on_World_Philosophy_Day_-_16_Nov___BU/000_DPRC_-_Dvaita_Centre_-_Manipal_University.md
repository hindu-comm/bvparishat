Dear scholars,

Namaste.  

  

We are glad to inform you all that Dvaita Philosophy Resource Centre (DPRC), Manipal University is celebrating 'World Philosophy Day' with a Special Seminar. This seminar is a part of the ongoing '*Computational Analysis of Mahabharata and Tatparyanirnaya*' project.

  

**Title**: **The Intellectual Duty of the King: An Indian Perspective**

**Speaker: Dr Nirmalya Guha**

**Venue**: Conference Room, Department of European Studies, Manipal University, Manipal  

**Date** and **Time**: 16 November 2017, 4 pm.

**Abstract:** Mahābhārata, especially Śāntiparva offers a unique perspective on how the King must prepare himself intellectually. The procedure assumes that the king is a fallible and (both physically and intellectually) a vulnerable human being. Within the limits of vulnerability, the king must always keep heightening his intellectual pedestal by reasoning. The reasoning method is based on a comparative evaluation of duties. These ideas of Mahābhārata deeply influenced the political philosophers of ancient India. The talk will briefly review the evolution of the royal wisdom.

  

All are welcome! Please find the attachment for more details.

Thank you.
