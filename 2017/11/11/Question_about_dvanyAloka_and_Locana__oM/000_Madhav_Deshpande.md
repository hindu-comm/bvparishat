Dear Colleagues,

  

  I am currently reading a section of DvanyƒÅloka with Abhinavagupta's Locana. However, what I find is that the three or four different editions that I am consulting give very different readings, and this is very frustrating to say the least. My question is: Is there a critical edition of these texts that provides all manuscript variants, and provides a text that is more trustworthy? The translation of Mason and Patwardhan is not accompanied by a Sanskrit text. Any help would be appreciated.
