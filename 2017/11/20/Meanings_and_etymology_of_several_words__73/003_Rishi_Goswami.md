Namaskar Andrey ji.  
Bera is mostly a substitute used for the word बिल्व। If we see dhatu is बिल भेदने। रूप बेलति, बेलयति। So if we take the nyaay, "रलयोरभेदः" like लोमन्/रोमन् and dhatus रघि/लघि and many more examples we can make dhatu बिल/बिर भेदने। We can search for a अक्ड़ित प्रत्यय like अच् etc to make it लघूपदगुण=बेल/बेर leaf.  
Else I dont know if it is used for Vishnupuja. I dont think so.  
But in samskrit there is no word like bera/bela or i haven't seen any use of such words. Amarkoshkar would have mentioned it in the vanoushadhi part if existed. This was just an estimate i could have thought of.  
Rishi.
