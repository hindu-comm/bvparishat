\>Amarakosha as the sole authority for all Sanskrit words is not tenable.

  

It's a wonderful and deep point though it's been rather mildly stated. This phenomenon, of a felt need for new koshas, adduces additional evidence for controverting the Indian NCERT group of historians (R Thapar, RS Sharma, D N Jha) and their rajaguru, DD Kausambi, who have been peddling, for 50+ years, their own politically motivated theories of 'death of sanskrit' after Harsha.

  

At a rough estimate, 6 or so centuries elapsed between Amarasimha and Yadavaprakasha.

  

Hope this helps,
