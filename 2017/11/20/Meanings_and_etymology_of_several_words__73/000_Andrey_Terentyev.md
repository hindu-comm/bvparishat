Dear Learned members,

  

I am reading a book "Vaac" by Andre Padoux.

<https://ru.scribd.com/document/226168382/Vac-by-Padoux-Andre>

  

On the page #47 (64 in sequence) there are several words i could not find in any dictionary available to me (<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/> )

  

There are

\- bera

\- muudra

  

Could you help me please to clearify meanings as well as etymology of theese words?

  

Many thanks,

Andrey
