Dear list,

  

A gentle reminder for applying to participate in the one-day workshop,[“Philosophy of Language:Reading of the Brahmakāṇḍa of Bhartṛ-hari’s Vākyapadīya”](https://www.amrita.edu/event/workshop-philosophy-language-brahmak-v-kyapad-yam), to be held on 16^(th)November 2017 in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Bengaluru.

  

In the first session of the workshop,[Prof. Ashok Akjulkar](http://asia.ubc.ca/persons/ashok-aklujkar/),(ProfessorEmeritus, University of British Columbia) will deliver a lecture on the topic,“How Bhartṛ-hari Makes a Rewriting of Philosophy’s Global History Unavoidable.”

  

“*The talk is meant primarily to introduce the philosopher Bhartṛ-hari, to explain the structure of his Vākyapadīya or Trikāṇḍī and to state the ideas that form the undercurrents of his statements at various places. The ideas have a close relationship with the ideas that have found expression in modern Western philosophies of language and grammar and in modernanalyses of typical problems of philosophy, namely in problems of epistemology and ontology*” - Prof. Aklujkar. 

  

In the second session, Prof. Aklujkar will engage the audience with textual readings from the Brahmakāṇḍa of the Vākyapadīya.

  

The workshop is open to all interested. Kindly refer to the attached brochure for further information.
