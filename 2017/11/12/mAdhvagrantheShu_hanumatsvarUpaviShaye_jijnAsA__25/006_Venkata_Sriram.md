श्री विद्यारण्य मुनि while commenting the मुख्यप्राण स्वरूप for following mantra of ब्रह्मानन्दवल्ली

"तस्माद्वा एतस्मादन्नरसमयात् । अन्योऽन्तरात्मा प्राणमयः । तेनैष पूर्णः"  

  

says that: मुखबिलेसञ्चरन्नुच्छ्वासनिश्वासकारी वायुः मुख्यप्राणः

  

The vital force that operates in the mouth in the form of inhale & exhale is 'mukhya-prANa'. And this vital forces in the form ofमुख्यप्राणः resides in mouth between two jaws. And hence, Hanuman-ji's jaws are symbolically represented as 'strong & swollen'.
My spiritual mentor told me this once.

  

regs,

sriram
