From Puranic Encyclopeadia:

  

1)*Birth.*Many and different are the stories about  
the birth of Hanūmān told in Purāṇic literature, and  
they are briefly noted below.  
(1) The semen discharged by Śiva, whose erotic  
feelings were excited by the sight of Viṣṇu disguised  
as Mohinī was received by the Saptarṣis and deposited  
in the womb of Añjanā, and Hanūmān was born out of  
it. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śatarudrasaṁhitā).  
(2) Daśaratha divided among his wives the divine  
pāyasa (pudding) got from the putrakāmeṣṭi yajña  
which was performed so that he might be blessed with  
children. Somehow or other a kite snatched some  
pudding and flew off with it. On its way the pudding  
fell down from the beaks of the kite on the fingers of  
Añjanā doing tapas in the forest. She ate that pudding  
and Hanūmān was born as the son of Añjanā due  
to the extraordinary powers of the pudding. (Ānan-  
da Rāmāyaṇa).  
(3) Śiva, once in his fierce and effulgent form (aspect)  
entered Kesarī, the husband of Añjanā and had coitus \[Page307-b+ 63\]  
with her. After that Vāyu (Wind-god) also had coitus  
with her. Thus as a result of the sexual act by both  
the Devas Añjanā got pregnant. Later, Añjanā was  
about to throw into the valley of the mountain her  
new-born child as it was an ugly one when Vāyu  
(Wind god) intervened and saved the child. Hanūmān  
was the child thus born of Śiva and Vāyu. (Bhaviṣya  
Purāṇa, Pratisarga Parva).  
(4) Hanūṃān's actual father was Śiva. Gaṇapati  
was born to Śiva and Pārvatī as they played in the  
forest disguised as elephants. After that Śiva and  
Pārvatī played about in the forest disguised as monkeys  
as a result of which Pārvatī got pregnant. Since  
Pārvatī did not like the idea of being the mother of a  
monkey, Śiva, by his yogic power entrusted the child,  
(in embryo) that was in the womb of Pārvatī to  
Vāyu (Wind god), who carried it with him hither and  
thither till it became mature, when it was deposited in  
Añjanā, the monkey woman. The monkey called Kesarī  
was her husband. Thus Hanūmān was born as the son  
of Añjanā.  
Añjanā also has a story of her own. Once upon a time  
she was the maid-servant called Puñjikasthalā of  
Bṛhaspati. One day she went out to gather flowers  
when the love-makings of other young women attracted  
her so much that, without gathering flowers, and her  
erotic sentiments being aroused much, she returned  
home and covered Bṛhaspati with kisses. Bṛhaspati got  
really angry with the misbehaviour of his maid-servant  
and cursed her into a female monkey. She was told  
that, after she had lived for sometime with a monkey-  
husband she would get a child from the vitality of  
Śiva, after which she would return to him as maid  
servant as of old. And, accordingly, Puñjikasthalā  
became a female monkey under the name Añjanā and  
lived at Añjanā forest with a handsome monkey called  
Kesarī as her husband.  
It was while Añjanā was doing tapas so that she might  
become pregnant by Śiva that Śiva and Pārvatī played  
in that forest disguised as monkeys, and Pārvatī  
conceived and the child ultimately came out as the son  
of Añjanā.  
Even while Añjanā was pregnant the child in her womb  
had much to suffer at the hands of Bāli. Hearing from  
Nārada that Śiva's son had been born in Añjanā's  
womb Bāli feared that the actual birth of such a son  
would jeopardise his lordship over the monkeys. To  
ward off the threatened contingency, Bāli, as advised  
by Nārada, let in the five metals (gold, copper, iron,  
tin and zinc) in watery form into the stomach of  
Añjanā. (This is a means of causing abortion). But,  
the attempt misfired. Instead of the five metals killing  
the child in Añjanā's womb, they became ear-orna-  
ments for it, and Hanūmān was thus born with orna-  
ments in his ears. (Kaṁba Rāmāyaṇa Pūrvakāṇḍa).
