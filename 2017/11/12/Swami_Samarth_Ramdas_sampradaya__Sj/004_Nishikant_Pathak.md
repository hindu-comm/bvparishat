\|\| Shree Swami Samarth \|\|

  

Dear Sir,

Samarth Ramdas Swami had many disciples. Kalyan Swami was his chief disciple & a Patta Shishya. He had many shishyas. It is said that 43 Mahanta are listed in his followers. Further to this spiritual lineage Brahma Chaitany Gondavalekar Maharaj, a very well known Saint is listed.

  

Regards,

Nishikant Pathak
