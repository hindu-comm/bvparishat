There are many Mathas established by Samartha Swami Ramdas all over India and some clue could be had through the Mathaadhipatis.His direct vamshajas may be from his elder brother as the Swamiji was a Brahmachaari.You may get some info.from Sajjangarh near Satara in Maharashtra.

Best luck in your search.
