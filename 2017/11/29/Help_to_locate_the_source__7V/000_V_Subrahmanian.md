In his Taittiriyopanishat Dipika, Sri Vidyaranya cites a verse as from a Purana:

  

महापापवतांनॄणांज्ञानयज्ञो न रोचते ।प्रत्युत ज्ञानयज्ञस्तु प्रद्वेष्यो भासते स्वत: ॥॥

  

This verse appears in 'Sri Datta Maahaatmya composed by Sri Vasudevananda Yati<http://www.transliteral.org/pages/z160502023954/view>  

  

On a search I could get only the above source with the full form of the verse as cited by Vidyaranya. It appears that the Datta Mahatmya is a later composition. Could anyone please help locating the verse in any earlier work? Or perhaps say that the Mahatmya preceded Vidyaranya?

  

Thanks and regards
