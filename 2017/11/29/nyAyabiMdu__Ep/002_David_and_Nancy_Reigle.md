The Nyāyabindu published by Chaukhamba in the Kashi Sanskrit Series (vol. 22), edited by Chandra Shekhar Shastri, is in Sanskrit only. Likewise, the Nyāyabindu published by Bauddha Bharati, edited by Swami Dwarika Das Shastri, is in Sanskrit only. The book by Mrinalkanti Gangopadhyaya is: *Vinītadeva's Nyāyabindu-ṭīkā: Sanskrit original reconstructed from the extant Tibetan version, with English translation and annotations*, Calcutta, 1971. It includes an English translation of the Nyāyabindu. An earlier English translation of the Nyāyabindu is found in *Buddhist Logic*, volume 2, by Th. Stcherbatsky, 1930. A later English translation of the Nyāyabindu is found in *A Millennium of Buddhist Logic*, volume 1, by Alex Wayman, 1991.
