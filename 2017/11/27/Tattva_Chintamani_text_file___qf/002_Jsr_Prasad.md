Dear Sundar,

  

We tried to create a Nyaya corpus 9 years ago. You may get part II of Anumana-khanda published by RSVP, Tirupati as a Unicode text, alongside some other Nyaya texts from here - <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/Corpus/>  

  

Also, I believe, CISTS, IIT Bombay has created a website with links and data.
