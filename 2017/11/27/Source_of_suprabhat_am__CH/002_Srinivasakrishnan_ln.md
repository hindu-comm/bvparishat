A few corrections maybe in order here. The author of the Venkatesa Suprabhatam is an acharya named Prativadi Bhayankaram Annan. He flourished mid to late 14th century to mid 15th century. He's usually not called Prativadi Bhayankaram Annangaracharya. He's said to have been given the title of 'prativadi bhayankaram' when he defeated a pandit named 'Narasimhamisra' in a sastrartham.  

  

Secondly in the link you've pointed to (which I have not read) there's a wrongly captioned picture. The acharya in the picture is Prativadi Bhayankaram Ananthacharya (1874-1936), a Srivaishnava scholar. He's the one after whom the Ananthacharya Indological Research Institute in Mumbai is named. Prativadi Bhayankaram Annangaracharya (1891-1983) is a mid 20th century Srivaishnava achrya and scholar.  

  

The article you've pointed to appears to have been misled by the wikipedia entry which has made the mistake of giving both the wrong name as well as the wrong picture.

  

The names being medieval and titular, can be confusing, I agree.  

  

The story of the Venkatesa Suprabhatam is narrated somewhat more authentically in the *History of Tirupati*, Vol 1 (pp. 210 - 212). I have scanned the relevant pages and attached herewith.  

  

Trust this is useful.
