Namaste

  

What is the connection with Prativadi Bhayankaram Srinivas the popular playback singer in South Indian films? Was he related to the great stalwart Acharyas and Venkatesha Suprabhatam? PB Srinivas voice was so closely matching Dr Rajkumar. He used to say 'Here is my body only. My voice PB Srinivas is going there'. Actually when Dr Raj started singing in films all felt PB Srinivas voice was better matching than his own voice.
