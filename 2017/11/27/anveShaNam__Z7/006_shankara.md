Namaste,

  

Girvanapadamanjari of Varadaraja & Girvanavangmanjari of Dhundikavi were published as appendices in the Journal of Oriental Institute, Baroda vol. 7, no. 4, edited by UP Shah in 1958. They are available online at the following link.  

  

<https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.283284/2015.283284.The-Journal#page/n411/mode/2up>  

  

An exhaustive introduction to these texts by U.P. Shah was serialized in succeeding issues of JOIB Vols 8 & 9. That too can be found at [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

regards  
shankara
