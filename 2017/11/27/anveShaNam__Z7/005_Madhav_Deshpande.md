A text titled Gīrvāṇapadamañjarī by some Varadabhaṭṭa was published in 1960 along with another text titled Gīrvāṇavāṅmañjarī by U.P. Shah from Baroda (Oriental Institute) in The M. S. University Oriental Series, No. 4. This is not text on grammar, but a free form conversation designed to teach colloquial Sanskrit usage. Conflation of Varadabhaṭṭa with Varadarāja may have lead some people to think of this as a text on grammar like Haradatta's Padamañjarī.
