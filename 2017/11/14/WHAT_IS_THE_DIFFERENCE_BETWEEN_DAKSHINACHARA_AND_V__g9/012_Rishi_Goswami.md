But why was Vaamaachar made when "Turiya" and women were allowed to attain Moksh through Puran? Yes I know, that streeshoodras are allowed Pouranik mantras and basic karma such as Vaishwadev etc. They just are not allowed to speak mantras but are not karmachyuta or akriyas like sannyasis.  
But through my understanding of the vaamaachar, i think that they are allowed maans madira etc. Are Brahmans allowed to do that if they are vaamaacharis?  
If not, even in Dakshinachar, kshatriyas were allowed to drink and eat flesh(restricted, not all types). So what is the actual prayojan to make such a maarg?  
Is it made for Stree shudras? Is it made for Brahmans who can eat and drink the "Abhakshya" and still attain Moksh?
