Dear Sri Rishi-ji,

  

These maargas (or any maarga including bhakti maarga) are not 'made' by anyone.

  

They come into existence.

  

when you speak allowing, who you think should allow or should not allow these?

  

Vedas, Smritis or any other?

  

Vedas do not have any instruction allowing or disallowing these things directly.
