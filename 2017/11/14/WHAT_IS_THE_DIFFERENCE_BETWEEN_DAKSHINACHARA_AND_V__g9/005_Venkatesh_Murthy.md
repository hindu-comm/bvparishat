Namaste

  

IMHO the दक्षिण Maarga can be followed and it is beneficial also. Example - Adi Sankara replaced Vaamachaara in many temples by दक्षिण type of worship. It does not have the Pancha Makaaras. In Lalitha Sahasra Naama there is a name Samayachara Tatpara. This is clearly showing for Lalithambika the Samachara internal type worship is best and not external worship.
