If we go deep into the roots of these tantrAs, there is no distinction of vAma and dakSiNa either. It was kula-tantra which got ramified into two schools of thought viz., shrIkula and kAlikula. The kAlikula is popular in north, east and shrIkula is popular in south. Later, depending upon the propagators, the names stuck as dakshinamurti sampradaya, hayagriva sampradaya and bhairava sampradaya. Accordingly, yantra-puja-kalpa was formulated by the propagators and sages.

  

The most popular in the south are 'saubhAgya-chintAmaNi kalpaH" which is followed in kAmakoTi pITa which was drafted by Sage Durvasa. Barring this, most of the parts are following the 'parashurAma kalpa' which was drafted by Sage Parashurama. Keeping this as base, several AmnAya mutts have modified / refined a bit to suit their mode of worship. Even the great vedic scholar & shrIvidyA upAsaka 'dharma-samrAT' karapAtri ji took this as pramANa for his work 'shrIvidyA ratnAkar' and 'nityAhnikaM'. The great shAkta shrI bhAskararaya took this as pramANa and later his chief disciple shrI umAnandanAtha wrote commentary to this which is now called as 'nityOtsava'.

  

Now, coming to your point.

  

................

Can Brahmans in vaamachar eat abhakhshya and prohibitted food by Vedas  

.............

  

What do you mean by a-bhakSya ? If it is मद्य, मांस, मत्स्य, then , yes, going by the pramANa ofपरशुरामकल्पसूत्रं, there is prescription of it but it is NOT aनियम विधि BUT aपरिसंख्या विधि. The sutras say:

  

अनित्यकर्मलोपः । मपञ्चक अलाभेऽपि नित्यक्रमप्र्यवमृष्टिः ॥  

  

Since, this vidhi is taken to beपरिसंख्या विधि, there areअनुकल्पाः (substitutes) advised inलोपामुद्रा संहिता as:

substitute for मद्य -गुड मिश्रिततक्रं वा दधी ; सैन्धवलवण मिश्रित पयः ; ताम्रपात्रगतं क्षीरं  

substitute for मांसः -मूलकं (raddish),आपूपः  

substitute forमत्स्य :कदळी फलं (as perलोपामुद्रा संहिता); garlic / ginger (also calledनागर खण्डं).

  

In several AmnAya peetas, the above substitutes are followed. The karvIra puSpa is shown as a substitute for maithuna. Also, swa-strI-samparka is also permissible.

  

.......................

Can Adwij also be engaged in Vaamachar  

............

  

First of all, you should remove whatever wrong notions you borrowed about vAmAchAra. And, yes...non-dwijas have the adhikAra to perform devi puja with vAmAchAra rituals. However, here too the shAstra has given certain injunctions for consumption. One should never consume this freely at one's own free will then what is the difference between a vAmAchAri and a drunkard / non-vegetarian person.

  

Theत्रिपुरोपनिषद् vide 12th mantra says:

  

परिस्रुतं झुषमाद्यं पलं च भक्तानि योनीः सुपरिष्कृताश्च ।

निवेदयन् देवतायै महत्यै स्वात्मीकृत्य सुकृती सिद्धिमेति ॥

  

ie., one should offer the madya, mIna, mAmsa ONLY after purifying with rituals and meditate on the Devi as non-different from oneself, thus, attains highest siddhi.

  

While explaining the above shloka, shrI bhAskararaya makhin and shrI rAghavAnanda tirtha yati have explained the esoteric meanings and what all should be offered by chAturvarNAs respectively (traivarNikAs should adopt substitutes).

  

**Last but not the least :**

  

The so-calledअभक्ष्याः are also used inश्रौत यागाः andसौत्रामणी rituals whereसोमरस, पशुयाग, यजमानस्य मैथूनं, वेश्या नाट्यं are seen. So, if somebody says,वामाचारः isनिन्द्य thenश्रौत यागाः that involvesपशुहिंसा, सोमरसपानं, मैथूनं (यजमान एवं यजमानपत्नी) is also निन्द्य.

  

Food for thought !!
