my pranams to all vidvaj-janas.

  

The thread started with a simple question on differentiation between vāma and dakṣiṇa ācāras, but I am a bit taken aback to see that the discussion has turned into negativity about tantras.

  

In brahma-sūtra (2.2.42) i.e. utpatty asambhavādhikaraṇam, Adi Shankaracharya has spoken against a specific pāñcarātra text which seems to specify the origin of the jīva.

  

The Śrī-bhāṣya clarifies the situation in order to establish the authoritativeness of the pāñcarātra texts.

  

Entire books dedicated to establish validity of āgama/tantra have been written by the Śrī-vaiṣṇavas e.g. Āgama-prāmāṇyam of Sri Yamunācārya (<https://archive.org/stream/pancaratra-agamas/Agama%20Pramanyam%20%5BSkt-Eng%5D#page/n0/mode/2up> )

  

The most widely accepted Purāṇas such as the Śrīmad-bhāgavatam too validate the tantras. The Śrīmad-bhāgavatam goes ahead to say that tantras were a bona-fide way of worshiping an image of Hari even in Dvāpara Yuga:

  

**Pramāṇa**: **यजन्ति वेदतन्त्राभ्यां परं जिज्ञासवो नृप** (श्रीमद्भागवतम् 11/5/28)  

  

**Commentary by Sri Sridhara Swami**:वेदतन्त्रभ्यां वैदिकेनागमिकेन च मार्गेण । यजन्ति पूजयन्ति । परं ईश्वरं ज्ञातुमिच्छवः ।

  

The worship of deity in the age of Dvāpara consisted of a mixture of both Vedic and Tantrik rituals. In this age of Kali however, there is immense importance of Tantras, especially for worshiping various deities in the temples:

  

**Pramāṇa: नानातन्त्रविधानेन कलावपि तथा शृणु** (श्रीमद्भागवतम् 11/5/31)  

  

**Sri Sridhara Swami says**:नानातन्त्रविधानेनेति कलौ तन्त्रमार्गस्य प्राधान्यं दर्शयति

  

The various details of installing and worshiping deities, mantras, bhūta-śuddhi etc. are not always to be found in śruti. Therefore, Āgamas and Tantras are an indispensable part of the lives of many sādhakas.

  

Tantras are not always a case of easy mokṣa. They are often also a case of mokṣa for those who cannot directly access the Vedas.

  

In the Saundarya-laharī, Adi Shankaracharya has mentioned the names of 64 tantras. The commentator Lakshmidhar says there that these are all non-Vedic, but Bhaskararaya does not agree with this opinion of Lakshmidhara.

  

Buddhists may have composed some literature under the name tantra but this does not invalidate all tantras, just as the Jainas composed various Purāṇas but this does not invalidate the authenticity of the Purāṇas coming from Sri Vyāsa. The Śrīmad-bhāgavata-purāṇam itself accepts that some tantras were created by Śrī Nārada:

  

**तृतीयमृषिसर्गं वै देवर्षित्वमुपेत्य सः**

**तन्त्रं सात्वतमाचष्ट नैष्कर्म्यं कर्मणां यतः** (श्रीमद्भागवतम् 1/3/8)

  

**Sri Sridhar Swami**:सात्वतं वैष्णवं तन्त्रं पञ्चरात्रागमं आचष्टोक्तवान् \|

  

So according to the Purāṇas, there are various authoritative tantras. One cannot reject all tantras wholescale. This is the reason why previous authorities such as Nāgeśabhaṭṭa have accepted the validity of various tantras and quoted them in various places. They are all good scholars who have placed faith in the validity of various tantras.
