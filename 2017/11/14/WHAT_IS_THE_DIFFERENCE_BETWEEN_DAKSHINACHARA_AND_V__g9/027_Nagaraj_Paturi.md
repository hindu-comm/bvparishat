No one during contemporary times identified the soma plant. The present yaajis are using some 'substitutes'.

  

There are articles by western Indologists trying to understand the concept of Soma rasa. None of these is conclusive.

  

Still, people take it for granted that Soma rasa is some intoxicating drink.

  

Gita has 'पूष्णामिचोषधीन् सर्वान् सोमो भूत्वा रसात्मकः'. Soma here is the common medicinal quality of (medicinal) plants. This could be metaphorical extension of the original meaning. But the original meaning can not be liquor from which the meaning of 'common medicinal quality of (medicinal) plants' can be derived.

  

The descriptions of something like elevated moods found as results of drinking Soma in some Vada mantras do not mean intoxication.
