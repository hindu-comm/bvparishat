Namaskara Vidwajjanah!  
I actually did not get answers to my question asked previously so please quench my thirst.  
  
Can Brahmans in vaamachar eat abhakhshya and prohibitted food by Vedas? Are they allowed to do that?  
Can Adwij also be engaged in Vaamachar? I know they have Pauranik mantras and pooja prakar, but that is not vaama bhairav Tantra.  
Can someone clarify please?  
Dhanyavadah.
