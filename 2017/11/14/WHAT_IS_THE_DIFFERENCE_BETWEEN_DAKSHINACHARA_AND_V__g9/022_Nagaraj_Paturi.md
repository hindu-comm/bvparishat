This forum is not a dharma peetha to decide the adhikaras of dvijas and advijas.

  

It is better to use sentences like this text says dvijas must do this or this text says advijas are allowed to do this etc.

  

What is the purpose of the questioner in asking these questions? For his own decision making in to do or not to do? To judge some behaviour observed by him? For academic purposes such as giving references in article?
