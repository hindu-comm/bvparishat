Just in a lighter vein.

There used to be a joke while we were in the Government service. If you are trying to please your boss through hard work it is like dakshinaacaara. It is a tough process. If you can take recourse to please him by the three or five makaara-s, then it is vaamaacaara. The latter is effective in most cases, which seems to validate the claim by the tantra proponents. At any rate, the combination of the two is sure to succeed.
