Namaste

  

\>The so-calledअभक्ष्याः are also used inश्रौत यागाः andसौत्रामणी rituals whereसोमरस, पशुयाग, यजमानस्य मैथूनं, वेश्या नाट्यं are seen. So, if somebody says,वामाचारः isनिन्द्य thenश्रौत यागाः that involvesपशुहिंसा, सोमरसपानं, मैथूनं (यजमान एवं यजमानपत्नी) is also निन्द्य

  

Dharma Sastra texts have prohibited some Srauta Yaagas in Kali Yuga. Ashwamedha is one such. First of all there are no ruling Hindu Kings today. Therefore nobody can do Ashwamedha. The questions of meat eating and sexual intercourse of the Chief Queenwith the dead horse will not arise. Many criticisms of Ashwamedha are useless because nobody is doing it today.

  

In Srauta Yaagas done in modern day they will invariably use substitute of flour animal instead of real animal. Soma plant is not available. They are using Putika plant with no intoxication powers. In some Yaagas with sexual intercourse they are skipping that part. I do not know about Veshya Natya. I have not heard of it. First of all the Srauta Yaagas are very rare and done in some rare venues. It is notcommon likeChandi Homa.
