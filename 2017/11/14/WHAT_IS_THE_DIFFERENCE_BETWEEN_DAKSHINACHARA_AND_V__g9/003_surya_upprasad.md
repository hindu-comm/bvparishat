Respected Guruji (Korada ji), pls ignore my ignorance and enlighten me.

  

I could see the following sentence in your replay on the subject line:

  

All the तन्त्रग्रन्थs are अवैदिक and अशिष्टाचारप्रवर्तित । They say the purpose is ' easy मोक्ष ’

  

Now, are theseतन्त्रग्रन्थsshould be followed or not? as you mentioned that these are

अवैदिक and अशिष्टाचारप्रवर्तितis my जिज्ञासा. These can be ignored as these areअशिष्टाचारप्रवर्तित,I think.

  

Hence i humbly request you to enlighten me in this regard.

  

With humble pranams

G Surya Prasad,

Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Puri
