नमस्ते श्रीमन् ओरोबिन्द-पदियत-महोदय !

(I hope I have spelled pronunciation of your name correcly)

  

That (1) Sanskrit had only oral tradition (2) Sanskrit was written much later - both are myths, possibly maliciously concocted myths.

  

Please see (1)<https://samskrutacharchaa.wordpress.com/category/sanskrit-the-language/sanskrit-was-spoken/> (2)<https://samskrutacharchaa.wordpress.com/grammatical-proof-that-sanskrit-was-also-written/>

  

Basically, why we are accepting somebody's hypothesis that there was decadence of Sanskrit during the times, when grammarians presented its grammar ? If we continue to give credence to a wrong hypothesis, everything further will be wrong.

  

I think that the moderator should intervene and stop the cascading wrongs.

  

Cordially, S. L. Abhyankar
