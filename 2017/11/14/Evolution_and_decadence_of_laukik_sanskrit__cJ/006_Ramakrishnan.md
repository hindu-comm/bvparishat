Śrī Abhayankar ji,

  

I think by 'decadence', he means the period when Sanskrit lost its position as the prime language of speech and/or literature and was clearly replaced by another language or languages i.e. when the majority of Indo-Aryan speakers could no longer identify their own spoken dialect with the language of the Ashtādhyāyī.

  

I think this happened sometime between the 10th and the 15th centuries of the current era.

  

Regards,

Ramakrishnan
