नमस्ते श्रीमन् नागराज-महोदय !

  

From what I have understood, it has been argument of Achyut Karveji, not mine, thatलौकिकSanskritsuffered decadence due to the (rigid) structuring of grammar by Panini. According to him, (rigid) structuring of grammarcaused decadence of free-wheeling Sanskrit speech, i.e. संस्कृत beinglanguage of the masses, which he terms as लौकिक संस्कृत.

  

Your mention of "..twocenturies before European colonialismestablished itself in the subcontinent..." is in tune with my mention ofभास्कराचार्य, मण्डणमिश्र and श्रीमच्छङ्कराचार्य et al.
