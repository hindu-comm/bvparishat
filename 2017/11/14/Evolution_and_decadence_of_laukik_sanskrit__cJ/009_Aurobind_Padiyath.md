Namaste,

Has the demise of oral-tradition any impact on this? The shift from oral tradition to print reduced the interest in Ashtadhyayi getting less prominence and later more shift to Sidhanta/Lagu S Kaumudi etc followed by change in teaching methodology using the route of Siddha roopa etc could have made the learning and usage less interesting.

it's my IMHO

Aurobind
