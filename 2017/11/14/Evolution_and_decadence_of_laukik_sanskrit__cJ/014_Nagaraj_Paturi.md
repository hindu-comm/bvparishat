Moderator in his moderator's role does better not to enter into the correctness or incorrectness of the content of the post.

  

But yes, from outside the moderator's role, I agree that this is again one of the untrained/ less informed understandings from Sri Achyut-ji. Words like 'decadence' of a language must first be defined well before concluding that 'decadence' happened.

  

"The shift from oral tradition to print reduced the interest in Ashtadhyayi getting less prominence and later more shift to Sidhanta/Lagu S Kaumudi etc followed by change in teaching methodology using the route of Siddha roopa etc could have made the learning and usage less interesting."

  

too has many such mistakes:

  

Print is a highly recent development.Issue on hand is not Ashtadhyayi becoming less prominent. So this post Sri Aurobind-ji is a digression from the starting point of the thread.

  

The issues such as the context that lead to AA and impact of AA on the later Sanskrit and the reasons for the expressions in Vritti, Vaartika, Bhashya etc. that are / may look to be 'differing with Panini' , are all discussed in detail by scholars , some of those stalwart authors being on this list itself.

  

In stead of making concluding claims in a field in which we are just beginners, it is better to humbly request such stalwart members for guidance.
