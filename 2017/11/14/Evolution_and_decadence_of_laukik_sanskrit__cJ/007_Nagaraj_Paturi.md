\>Your mention of "..twocenturies before European colonialismestablished itself in the subcontinent..." is in tune with my mention ofभास्कराचार्य, मण्डणमिश्र and श्रीमच्छङ्कराचार्य et al.

  

"..twocenturies before European colonialismestablished itself in the subcontinent..." are not my words, they are the words of Prof. Sheldon Pollock as part of his "Death of Sanskrit" thesis with which I disagreed and the threads to which I posted links are part of my effort to provide counter examples to his thesis.

  

There were rejoinders to"Death of Sanskrit" thesis by other western academicians like Prof. Hannender:

Sri Karveji's argument that post-Paniniyan grammarians had to differ with Panini in order to account for the 'decadent' changes in Sanskrit is naive.

  

There are scholarly publications on why the authors of vritti, vaartika, bhaashya etc. had to make expressions that appeared to differ with Panini.
