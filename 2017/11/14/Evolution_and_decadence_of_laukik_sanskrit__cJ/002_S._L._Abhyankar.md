श्रीमन् रामकृष्णन्-महोदय !

  

I also disagree with Karveji's observation that structuring of Sanskrit grammar by Panini led to decadence of लौकिकSanskrit. सिद्धान्तशिरोमणी of भास्कराचार्यwas of 12th century. If सिद्धान्तशिरोमणी was about गणितम्, he also composed तत्त्वकौस्तुभ on ब्रह्मसूत्र-s. श्रीमच्छङ्कराचार्य's compositions are also of period 1300 years after Panini.So how can any one say that from 500 BC to 12th century AD the language suffered decadence ? Sanskrit of भास्कराचार्य and श्रीमच्छङ्कराचार्य' was nothing but लौकिक. The debate between मण्डणमिश्र and श्रीमच्छङ्कराचार्य was certainly लौकिक संस्कृत.

  

If लौकिक संस्कृतsurvived for 1300 / 1600 years after Panini, how can any one dare to blame Panini that his structuring the grammar led to decadence ? Absolutely abhor-able !  

  

The language suffered decadence only during British Raj or maybe also during Mugfhal dynasty and during times of so many invaders before Babar.
