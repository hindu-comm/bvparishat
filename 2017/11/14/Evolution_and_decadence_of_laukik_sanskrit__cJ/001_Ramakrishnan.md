Dear Achyut Karve ji,

  

I apologise for answering this late, I do not thinkPāṇini's time or the 1000 years that followed him shows any sign of decadence as far as sanskrit speech and/or literature is concerned.

  

In fact it shows the exact opposite i.e. that period (even down till the 10th century) is commonly agreed to be the golden period of sanskrit literature.

  

The period of decadence (comparatively) set in during the last 1000 years i.e. sometime between the 10th and 20th centuries CE. Again this is only comparative.

  

I dont see based on what evidence exactly you think that decadence set in immediately afterPāṇini's time.

  

I would call the period immediately followingPāṇini a period of considerable literary renaissance.

  

Regards,

Ramakrishnan
