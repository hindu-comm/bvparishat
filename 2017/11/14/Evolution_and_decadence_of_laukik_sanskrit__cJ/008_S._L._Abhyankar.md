नमस्ते श्रीमन् रामकृष्णन्-महोदय !

  

My contention is that a dialect which emerges with quite some local flavor, definitely differs from the original. Logically then, such dialects do not have to have the same name as of the original. If more and more of the population would speak such native tongues, the original will get relegated. This keeps happening all over the world all the time. How many people in Europe as of today speak Greek or Latin or Hebrew ?

  

I would like to contend that when a dialect differs too much from the original, it should become known by a name different from the original. So if लौकिकं संस्कृतम्is different from original, it should no more be called as any type of संस्कृतम्. By that logic लौकिकं संस्कृतम्is itself a malafide phrase. Almost all Indian languages have great influence of Sanskrit. Yet they all have their own names. None of them is लौकिक संस्कृत.

  

I think we are indulging in all this debate, only because of the bad phrase लौकिकं संस्कृतम्. I for one would like to rest my indulgence.
