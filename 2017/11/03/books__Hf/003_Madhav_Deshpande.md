Hello Sudip,

  

  I have sent the text of Mātr̥cetṭa's Śatapañcāśatka to you using WeTransfer. For anyone else interested, here is the download link:<https://we.tl/FJ6olsthuA>. The link will remain active till November 10. If you do receive a pdf of the Kunjunni Raja Felicitation Volume, please forward it to me. Best,
