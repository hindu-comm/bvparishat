I did not know about this wonderful website. Thankyou very much. Im not able to find exactly where on the page was this Geeta given. Im trying to find out about other Granthas or Purans etc. Are there any other Anvyayas available? Can you please provide the link if any?  
  
I generally search the shloka on the net or just look for it in [sa.m.wikisource.org](http://sa.m.wikisource.org). Are there any good sites which you know of?
