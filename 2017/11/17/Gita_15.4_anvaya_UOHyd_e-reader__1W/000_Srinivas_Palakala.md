Namaste vidvadbhyaH

I was looking at[BG 15.4](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/e-readers/sbg/15/index-15.html)on the UOHyd e-reader and the words tat and padam are analyzed as dvitIya ekavacana (2 eka). I was thinking these should have been prathama since parimArgitavyaM is tavyat pratyaya that is applied in karmaNi and hence the karma should have been in prathama. Hoping the learned would shed some light on the correct analysis.
