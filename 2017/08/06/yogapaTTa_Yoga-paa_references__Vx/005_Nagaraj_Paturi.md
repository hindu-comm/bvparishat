Original meaning of paTTa seems to be a waist-belt like cloth binding the waist for holding the waist tight during any action such as weight-lifting, fighting etc.

  

Gradually the piece of costume, as a consequence the word referring to that, through metaphor, came to indicate a deekshaa, a vow / a pledge.

  

This probably is the source of paTTa in paTTaabhisheka. paTTa = a vow to rule.

  

Interestingly, in Telugu, there is the usage paTtamu kaTTu = (literal) to tie a paTTamu in the sense place in a high post /a high position. The word kaTTu = to tie in this could be a reference to the tying of the waist-cloth as a deekshaavastra.

  

In marriage rituals and upanayana rituals too there is a ritual element of tying (grassy waist-band) around the waist.

  

In sannyaasa deekshaa rituals in the s'ankara tradition, there is a ritual element of giving yogapaTTa to the person taking to sannyaasa.

  

Thus , the sense 'binding cloth' in the above contexts seems to be common in all.

  

It seems to be that sense that is being involved in the present usages in the sense of posture securing binding cloth.
