Respected scholars,

  

**योगपट्ट** (*Yoga-patta*) is a cloth strip that is tied around the back and legs of a yogi. It helps in maintaining a stable, easy posture in dhyana.

  

**योगपट्ट** is defined in the *Concise Encyclopaedia of Hinduism Vol 3* as a band of cloth used for holding the crossed legs firmly in position during yogic meditation. It goes round the two legs at the level of the knees, the legs being slightly raised. It may be wound round in other ways also.

**I am looking for references about योगपट्ट in classical texts to understand its actual usage in context. There is not much information available in the public domain about theयोगपट्ट \|**

  

*I found some rudimentary textual materialhere:*
