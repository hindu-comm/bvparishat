I am not an expert on Agamas, but I have looked into texts attributed to Naarada for getting a historical estimate of the Naarada-shilpa. There are more than 14 texts ascribed to Naarada, Agama texts included. It is not only the authorship that gets confused but also the titles. There is a Naaradiiya-samhita (ed. RP Chowdhury; KSV Pub.No.15 Tirupati) which I understand is the traditionally accepted Pancharatra text. The organisation, contents all fit into the orthodox definition of Agamas. More info on authenticity is available in the Introduction. The start of the text as shown below is altogether different from the Bharadwaja samhita that you have kindly made available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). There is another published text "Naarada-pancharaatra" available (see below). But that text while being VaishNava is more a PurANa rather than Agama. There is confusion about even the years in which these two texts were published, let alone their original dates. But that is not relevant for the present thread.
