Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvajjanas,  
I would like to know the authenticity and position of Bharadwaja  
Samhita (one with four chapters,  
<https://archive.org/details/np_bhsamhita>) which is considered a part  
of Narada Pancaratra.  
  
How and What is its connection with Narada Pancaratra?  
In which sampradayas or traditions it was used?  
Is it a bonafide pancaratra text?  
What is the detailed Introduction to its commentator Sarayu Prasad Misra?  
  
Thankyou,  
Your servant,  
damodara das
