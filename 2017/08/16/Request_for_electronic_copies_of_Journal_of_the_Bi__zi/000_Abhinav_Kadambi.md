Namaste,

  

I have been wondering if the electronic copies of a complete/partial collection ofJBORS publications were available online. The last I checked on Archive (before the current mindless blocking of access by DoT), some low resolution scanned copies (from a library in Kerala?) of publications numbered 2.1, 4.1, 12.1, 21, 22, 23.4, 24, 24.2, 26.1, 26/27, and 28 were available. It would be of great help to future scholars if a more complete and Hi-res digital collection is made openly accessible.

  

I request any scholar who possesses these scans already to share them here if possible.  

  

Thank you.
