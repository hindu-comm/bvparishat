Hello Adheesh and Ashok,

You have presented the programme in such an attractive manner especially the verses by Vidyut and Madhav The sessions are also well planned and giving representation to even Tamil literature and Kudiyattam. I will sorely miss these events. My heart and spirits will be with you all those physically I will not be there.

All the best.

omrukmani
