Namaste

  

I think Yama is older than Shani. Because there is a story in the Puranas. Once Surya's wife Samjna could not bear the heat and she secretly created her shadow Chaya Devi looking exactly like herself and she went away to her father's house. She also left her children Yama and Yamuna with Chaya.

  

Surya did not see any difference and he had two children with Chaya. The son was Shani. But Chaya became a bad step mother to Yama and Yamuna and started ill treating them. One day Surya saw this and got suspicious. He threatened Chaya to tell the truth and she told the whole story of Samjna.

  

Surya went after Samjna but she was not in her father's house. She became a female horse secretly and was living on earth. But Surya found out and he became a horse and mated with her. This time Ashwini Devata Twins were born.
