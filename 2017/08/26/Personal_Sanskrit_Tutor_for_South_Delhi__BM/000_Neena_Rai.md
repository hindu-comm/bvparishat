Dear members.

  

I am a student of Sanskrit. I had a great teacher who taught me Sanskrit for a year but has now moved to another city. I am looking for a new Sanskrit teacher. Can someone help me out with some references? Does anyone here teach Sanskrit?

  

Teacher should be well versed in grammar and be able to explain sandhi, samas, vibhakti, roop etc as and how they are formed in verses.

I would prefer to start with Anuvad Chandrika.

  

It would be great if he knows the scriptures well, specifically the Valmiki Ramayan. Jyotish, ayurved and chanakya/shukra niti knowledge will be much appreciated.

  

Look forward to guidance from other members here.

  

Best regards

Neena
