Respected scholars,

  

  

I want to translate a hitherto untranslated Sanskrit text on dramaturgy into English as my PhD thesis. Can you suggest a professor under whom I can do this? An ideal guide would be one who is conversant in both the Śāstras and english (at least the former if not the latter). Knowledge of Abhinavabhārati along with a background in the Trika philosophy would be favourable.

  

Can you suggest me an institution under which I can pursue such work with scholarship/stipend?

  

I would love to hear any other valuable suggestion which would help me serve this purpose.

  

Praṇam,

Amar Acharya.
