Dear Madhav Deshpandeji,

Your interpretation is correct. The conversion of a Sanskrit word to prakrit involves a change in internal effort as in धर्म becoming धम्म.
The same has happened in ma icchami being phonated as micchami.

Reasons for sandhi not taking place between aa of maa and i of icchami in Sanskrit you know better.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
