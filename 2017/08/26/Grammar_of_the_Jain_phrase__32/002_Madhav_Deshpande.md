Dear Nityanandaji,

  

  Thanks for looking into the Abhidhānarājendra. Yes, this work supports the interpretation "mithyā me duṣkr̥tam" for the Prakrit "micchāmi dukkaḍam." This is also seen elsewhere. The grammatical problem with this interpretation is that the genitive singular form in Prakrit is "me" and not "mi," as one can see from the textual context:मिच्छामिदुक्कडम् खामेमि सव्व जीवे, सव्वे जीवा खमंतु मे। Here, the dative/genitive form "me" is actually used in the phraseसव्वे जीवा खमंतु मे. That makes it linguistically difficult to treat "micchāmi" as "micchā + mi". This is precisely the dilemma.
