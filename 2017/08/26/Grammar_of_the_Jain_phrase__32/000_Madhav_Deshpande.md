Dear Colleagues,

  

  Someone recently asked me the meaning of the Jain phrase "micchāmi dukkaḍam". On most of the web sources, the explanation is given like this: micchā mi dukkaḍam (Skt. mithyā me duṣkr̥tam) meaning "May my evil deed be ineffective". I am wondering whether micchāmi in this phrase is originally "mā+icchāmi" and the phrase meaning: "May I not wish evil."
In several textual contexts, micchāmi occurs with other first person singular verbs like khāmemi:मिच्छामिदुक्कडम् खामेमि सव्व जीवे, सव्वे जीवा खमंतु मे। I will appreciate any light that our Prakrit scholars can shed on this. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
