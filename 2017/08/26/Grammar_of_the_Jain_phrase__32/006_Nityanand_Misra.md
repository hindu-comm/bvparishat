Dear Prof. Deshpande

  

Indeed, the dilemma exists. Another thing to ponder over is if *mā+icchāmi* will result in *mecchāmi* instead of *micchāmi*. Is it possible that *mecchāmi* can become*micchāmi* and*me* cansimilarly become *mi* at some some places? The*Abhidhānarājendra*lists words like *miṃḍha*(Sanskrit*medhra)* where the e→ i transformation takes place.

  

I also checked the*Abhidhānarājendra* on *mi*. The work says *mi* is an *avyaya*and is also the *ādeśa*of *asmad + am*. Inother words, *mi* is same as *mām*\[accussative singular\]. This is a conjecture, but is it possible that the sentence is *micchā mi dukkaḍam* =*mithyā māṃ duṣkṛtam =māṃ \[prāptaṃ\] duṣkṛtaṃ mithyā \[bhavatu\]*? That would imply a sense of forgiving (as opposed to asking for forgiveness in*mithyā me duṣkṛtam*).

  

Thanks, Nityananda
