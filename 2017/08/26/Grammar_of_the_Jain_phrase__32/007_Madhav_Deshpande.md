Dear Nityanandaji,

  

  Thanks for continuing to think over this dilemma. In Ardhamāgadhī, mā+icchāmi would naturally become micchāmi, rather than mecchāmi. In his Introduction to Ardhamagadhi (p. 80), Professor A. M. Ghatage says that "e" and "o" are reduced to "i" and "u" if they are followed by a consonant cluster. He offers the following examples:

  

Skt. gaja+indra \> ArdhM. gaya+inda \> gainda (गइन्द)

Skt. eka+indriya \> ArdhM. egindiya

Skt. ratna+ujjvala \> ArdhM. rayaṇujjala

Skt. nīla+utpala \> ArdhM. nīluppala

  

Shortening of long vowels, including "e" and "o", is widespread before consonant clusters in most Prakrits and Pali. In Pali, I remember the examples like Skt. mahendra \> Pali. Mahinda, Skt. alpeccha \> Pali appiccha, etc.  So, mā+icchāmi \> micchāmi does not seem to be problematic. What is rather surprising is why such an explanation did not occur to Jain commentators, and why they offered the analysis: micchā + mi.
