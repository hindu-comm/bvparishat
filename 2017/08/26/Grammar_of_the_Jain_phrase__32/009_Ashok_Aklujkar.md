I have been hesitating to post the following to the BVP forum over the last few days because I did not have the time to ascertain if the sound change I am presupposing (ṣy —> cch) is possible in Pkt (nor do I have the time at present):

  

Over the years, I have instinctively and unreflectingly taken micchāmi as related to Sktmṛṣyāmii and the first part of the conventional Jain utterance as intended to convey “I forgive (your/every one’s) bad/painful deed/act (toward me)”.

  

Root mṛṣ does occur in Skt in the sense of’tolerate, put up with, forgive’. Grammars list it as occurring in the first (bhv-ādi) and tenth (cur-ādi) classes. Whether the precise formmṛṣyāmi/marṣiṣyāmi is attested in Skt does not concern me much, since not every usable form is actually preserved in the surviving literature of any language.

  

It is perhaps instructive that the commonly used Pkt dictionaries do not cite the instances of the clause under discussion, namely ofमिच्छामिदुक्कडम्, when they give the meanings of micchā-dukkaḍa,etc.

  

I have asked a friend who knows much more about Pkt literature and Jain community than I to find out what the earliest occurrence ofमिच्छामिदुक्कडम् is, how the traditional commentators have glossed it (if they indeed have), and what the elders in the Jain community generally take the clause to mean. If I learn anything that goes against my understanding based on the ‘mṛṣyāmi—> micchāmi’ link, I will let this forum know.
