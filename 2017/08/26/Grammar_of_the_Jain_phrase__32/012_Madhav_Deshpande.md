Dear Shri Bhat,

  Namo namaḥ,  

  

  I checked theपाइअ-सद्द-महण्णवो, and, yes, it lists "मिच्छ is apabhramsha root for इष् इच्छायाम्." The citation given there is an Apabhraṃśa citation, while micchāmi dukkaḍam occurs in much earlier Jain Prakrit sources. Obviously, if micchāmi dukkaḍam were to be equivalent to icchāmi dukkaḍam, we will have a much bigger problem of interpretation.
