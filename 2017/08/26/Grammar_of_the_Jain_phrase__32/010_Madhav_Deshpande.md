Dear Ashok,

  

  Your suggestion that micchāmi could be a Pkt version of mr̥ṣyāmi does suggest a possibility. However, I have not found the use of the Pkt verb micchati in this sense in any Pkt dictionary so far.
Ratnachandra-Ardhamāgadhī-Quadrilingual-Dictionary-OR-Maharashtri And Deshya Prakrit Dictionary-Vol-4, gives only nominal forms micchā = mithyā, independently and in compounds. The same is true for Abhidhānarājendra (Vol 6). These sources do not list a verbal usage of micchati = mr̥ṣyati. I had also thought of this possibility, but after checking these lexicographical sources, I abandoned that option.

  

  Shri H. N. Bhat pointed out that the examples I had cited were all compounds. But the same phenomenon of shortening vowels before a consonant cluster occur in the sandhi of uncompounded sequences: tattha+aṭṭhamie \> tatthaṭṭhamie (Ghatage, Introduction to Ardhamagadhi, p. 77).
