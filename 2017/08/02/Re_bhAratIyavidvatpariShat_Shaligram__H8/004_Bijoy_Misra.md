Dear Sri Venkata,

We have to find a rationale such that the new youth also

understands the logic of "sAkSAt viSNu swarupam".

It could have special geologic or medicinal significance.

We should go with the thinking that no concept is arbitrary

(my opinion).

  

Some analysis might have already happened. Please check.

  

Best regards,

BM
