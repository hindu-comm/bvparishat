There is no ऊँ in the Yajus.

Actually the Vedic Text reads the mantra as follows:

  

पिता नोऽसि पिता नो बोधि नमस्ते अस्तु मा मा हिँसीः

  

The verse is in गायत्री metre:

  

\[O Mahavira\],

  

You are our father. Please awaken consciousness lke our father. We salute to you. Please don't harm (0r injure) us.
