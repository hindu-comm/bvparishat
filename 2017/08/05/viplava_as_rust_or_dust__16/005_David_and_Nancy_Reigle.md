Many thanks, kind sirs! for your helpful and learned replies. What Sri Bhat wrote, and Sri Deshpande agreed with, and which was supported by the observations of Sri Abhyankar and Sri Kannan, makes perfect sense to me:

  
  
"Due to double meaning as applicable mirror and speech, it should be purely contextual and need not dictionary meaning."  
  

I thought that this might be the case, but my familiarity with the Sanskrit writings was entirely insufficient for me to be sure about it. Now I can be sure about it. Thanks!  
  

Best regards,
