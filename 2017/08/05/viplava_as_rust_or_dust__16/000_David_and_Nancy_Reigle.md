Dear kind Vidvāns,  

  

What seems to be a basic meaning of viplava given in existing Sanskrit-English dictionaries is confusion, in the sense of being dispersed or scattered or disordered. Vaman Shivaram Apte gives a total of 16 different meanings for viplava. Among these various meanings is rust or dust on a mirror (obviously a mirror made of reflective metal in the first case, or glass in the second case). The only reference given for this meaning, by Monier-Williams in his 1872 and 1899 editions, and by Apte, is the *Kirātārjunīya*, chapter 2, verse 26 (neither this meaning nor this reference is given in Wilson’s dictionary, *Śabdakalpadrumaḥ*, *V**ācaspatyam*, or Petersburg Wörterbuch). This verse is:  

  

apavarjita-viplave śucau hṛdaya-grāhiṇi maṅgalâspade \|  
vimalā tava vistare girāṃ matir ādarśa ivâbhidṛśyate \|\| 2.26 \|\|  

  

“Your flawless intellect is reflected in your speech, which is free of logical fallacies and grammatical errors, as in a clear, polished mirror, pleasing and propitious.”

  

(translated by Indira Viswanathan Peterson, *Arjuna and the Hunter*, 2016)

  

As noted by the translator: “Verse 26 features the figure of speech *śleṣa* (polysemy), involving double meanings for several words, e.g., *śuci* (clean, pure/free of errors) and *viplava* (blemishes such as rust/violation of standards of proof).”

  

Mallinātha in his commentary had given the two meanings intended here as follows:  

  

viplavaḥ pramāṇa-bādhaḥ \| anyatra bāhya-mala-saṃkramaḥ \|  

  

I understand the second meaning, bāhya-mala-saṃkramaḥ, as “the accumulation of impurities on the surface.” This, of course, on a mirror, would be rust or dust. My question is:

  

Is there any other place in the whole range of Sanskrit writings where viplava specifically means rust or dust on a mirror? Or is it only in this *Kirātārjunīya* verse, where viplava was used in a double meaning?

  

Thanks.

  

Best regards,
