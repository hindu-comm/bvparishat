Etymologically विप्लव is वि+प्लव.

  

In Apte's dictionary प्लव is mentioned as प्लु-अच् hence from धातु प्लु.

  

क्त-कृदन्तम् of प्लु is प्लुत. Now, as is well-known, प्लुत is a type of pronunciation of a vowel. One meaning ofप्लु is to swim. Connecting this meaning ofप्लु toप्लुत as a type of pronunciation of a vowel, it comes to mind that, that meaning ofप्लुत seems to have thought of the ripples of a wave. Is notप्लुत-pronunciation of a vowel cascading like the ripples of a wave ?

  

It hence comes to mind that meanings of words in Sanskrit should be understood by giving a thought to how various shades of meaning evolve and develop by the cascading effects. Considering the etymology of the word, hence becomes a good strategy.

  

By that one would get large number of examples. Comes to mind, what is said about कर्म - कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः \| अकर्मणश्च बोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणो गतिः (गीता 4'17).

  

By such token, may I say गहना शब्दार्थगतिः !!

  

पाणिनि also declares समर्थः पदविधिः (2-1-1) I would take the liberty to understand this to mean पदस्य विधिना पदं समर्थं भवति OR पदविधिः एवमनुसरणीयः येन पदं समर्थं भवेत्
