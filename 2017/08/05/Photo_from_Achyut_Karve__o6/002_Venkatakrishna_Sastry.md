Namaste

  

1\. It is good to have concern for future of Indian languages /samskrutham /Devanagari script / Rajbhashaa et al.

  

2\. Survey Reports do show that Indian languages ( like many other world languages) are choked by the throttle of English through technology. India is taking the hit for its sixty years of special patronage for English (as a colonial legacy)at the cost of its native, spiritual, cultural, national, regional languages in education.

  

3\. At Yoga Samskrutham University, a US patent has beenreceived on ' Samskruth Brahmi script related Technologies'; and the writer has a product ready for delivery to address the above issues of Indian Languages in cyber space. 

  

Please contact me off the forum to know more on development and support role you are willing to provide. There are some final issues to be sorted out before product final release.
