The title mentions Kashmir Shaiv philosophy

  

But the post mentionsशैवसिद्धान्ते

  

Can you please be clearer as to what you actually are interested in?

  

Or, you might want to enquire about how many strands of Shaiva Siddhaanta are there to be studied and then choose one of them and then try to take the help of list members regarding that chosen strand.
