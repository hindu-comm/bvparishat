Please go to

  

<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gret_utf.htm#BhG>  

  

Copy the texts from the files, paste them in word, all in a single file, save as a single file giving it a name. Whenever you want to check for a verse or line, go to "find" in word and type the line you want and check.

  

It may be easier to get the text transliterated into Devanagari and save the Devanagari text as a word file.

  

An ITX Devanagari text is available at

  

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/bhagvadnew.html?lang=sa>

  

You might want to get it convertd into unicode for an easy search in word.
