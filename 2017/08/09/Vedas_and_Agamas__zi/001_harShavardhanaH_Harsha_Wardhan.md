Sri Prabhakara Rao garu,

  

The multi vol Encyclopedia of Agamas (agama kosa) by Late Prof. S. K. Ramachandara Rao could be useful to you. In the introduction, the author explains his understanding of the link between Vedas and Agamas. You can find some vols here:<https://ruthaavaree.wordpress.com/archived_texts>

  

You may also profitably check into Kashmiri and Tibetan agamas. Dr Jaideva Singh's writings may give you some references wrt Kashmiri sources. I am not knowledgeable about Tibetan agamas.

  

The French Institute in Pondicherry has some publications that could be relevant. Dr T Ganesan is the expert on Agamas and Saiva Siddhanta there. You may get in touch with him for further information.

  

The Thirumanthiram of Sri Thirumoolar has some verses concerning Vedas and Agamas, if I remember correctly. Dr B Natarajan did a labour of love and translated the text. It is here:<http://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/tirumantiram>. You can also buy a copy from the RK Math in Domalguda if you are in Hyderabad. Recently, Marshall Govindan has produced a translation. Check here:<http://www.thirumandiram.net>

  

regards  

Harsha.
