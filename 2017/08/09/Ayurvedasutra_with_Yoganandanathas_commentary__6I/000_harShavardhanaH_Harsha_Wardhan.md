Respected scholars,

  

Is an English translation of the Sanskrit text named **Ayurvedasutra** alongwith the commentary of *Yoganandanatha* available?

  

I found that Sri R Shama Sasty, that great scholar from Mysore, had published the Sanskrit text with the Sanskrit commentary, alongwith his English introduction. For those who are interested, it is available here:

  

<http://sandhi.hss.iitb.ac.in/Sandhi/Books/Indian%20Science/Indian%20Medicine/Ayurveda/Source%20Works/Ayurvedasutra%20with%20Yogaanandanaatha%27s%20Commentary%20-%20Sastry%20(1922).pdf>  

  

I am not sure if an English translation of the text + commentary has been attempted. Pls let me know if you are aware of such a publication (physical or digital).

  

regards

Harsha
