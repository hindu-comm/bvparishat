Respected scholars,

  

Are you aware of any public access or free digital repositories or archives of papers and journals such as JSTOR?

  

I am as yet aware of only DLI and [archive.org](http://archive.org) for scanned books, and now jstor.

  

I'd appreciate any resources you might point to.

  

regards

Harsha
