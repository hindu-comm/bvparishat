Namaste,  
  

Could anyone provide me with a copy of:  
Sāyaṇa's preface to the R̥gvedabhāṣya Translated by Peter Peterson..  
  

As far as I could see, it is not in the archives. I could not get thru the library network I usually use due to the status of the copies available marked up as "not to be circulated"..  
  

thanks,  

..gopal Gopinath
