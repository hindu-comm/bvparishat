Namaste

  

The continuity is also Illusion. The Vedanta Siddhanta Muktavali author has shown this is also Illusion. What is happening is you think the Waking world is the same as the Waking world before you sleep and dream. But it is Illusion only. The Waking world after you get up looks like the previous Waking world because of Ati Saadrushya but it is actually not the same Waking world. There is no proof even in Science to show the Waking world before going to sleep is the same as Waking world after the sleep. All this is part of the Illusionof the Dreamer Jeeva. The Pot seen before is not the same Pot after waking. Therefore he makes a very bold statement -  

एवं जाग्रदवस्थायां प्रपञ्चम् अनुभूय सुषुप्तिं गत्वा पुनरुत्थाय योऽयं प्रपञ्चानुभवः स प्रपञ्चान्तरमेव विषयीकरोति प्रत्यभिज्ञानं तु अविवेकादेव । When ten people see a Illusory Snake instead of a rope lying in front of them they all say 'we saw the same snake'. But it is because of Aviveka they are saying that because the Avidyaa Vrutti of one person cannot be known by another person. Every person's snake is appearing in his Avidyaa Vrutti. They are all seeing different snakes but they think they are seeing the same snake. The Pratyabhijnaa of seeing the same snake isError. Similarly a person experiences a Waking State World and goes to sleep. Then he gets up and he sees another Waking state World. The Pratyabhijnaa of seeing the same Waking state World is because of Error.
