Sri Bijoy-ji,

  

Can you please help me understand the relevance of your present post in the context of the present thread?

  

Need to cater to the younger members of the group is well taken.

  

Catering to the younger audience outside the group is done by all of us depending on the context/audience. This forum is no such context.

  

In what way "Please help empower students to think and discriminate than to accept and follow." is relevant to the present thread, I am not able to follow.

  

Who /which post in the present thread, asked students or any other audience of the post to accept and follow?

  

In what way isyour reading of the Gita at the temple relevant to the present thread, sir?
