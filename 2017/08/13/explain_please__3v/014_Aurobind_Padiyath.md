Sri Suryanarayana Rao,  
There are two important aspects of Advaita one should clearly understand and analysis of the situation should be a derivative affirmation of these two.  
They are  
1. अद्वयत्वं meaning absolute nonduality.  
2.अनन्यत्वं meaning nonexistence of anything other.  
The entire Advaita approach should be able to reduce to these two above mentioned aspects.  
These two words may seemingly give the same meaning but they have to be understood as follows  
First one is an affirmation that there is only absolute One and that's nothing but Brahman.  
The second word is for explaining, if there is anything existing as other, they are the same truth appearing as different, in truth there is only One.  
The 7th mantra of Mandukya precisely explains it. There are many other places in other Upanishads also. I'm not writing them for brevity.  
सदात्मनासर्व्ं आत्मैवाभूत् as Sat everything became the Self. As the self is nothing but Satchidananda. And अयं आत्मा ब्रह्म। This self (the listener's) is Brahman. The word सर्वं above stand for Brahman (बृहत्वात्).  
So the waking dream and deep sleep all are appearance of that truth as तुरीयस्पन्दनं as explained in Mandukya. Our dream is an appearance of waking plus imaginations of waking. The waking and dream are again appearance of Consciousness as objects which have no independent existence without Consciousness. Even deep sleep is an aspect of the same Consciousness where there is no objects nor the organs of comprehension available for objectify. So what appears in all the three states are nothing other than that Consciousness. Hence all objects in those states are also non other. This do not deny whatever happens in each of those states, what Advaita confirms is that they are nothing but Consciousness appearing as objects and not different from that Consciousness in their absolute reality.
