Dear Sri Venkatesh  
  
You say that the continuity in the waking state is also an illusion. I dont know what you mean by illusion, but I want to share a thought.  
  
If you put a CCTV camera that records your position before, during and after sleep, the recording in the CCTV camera should confirm the continuity of the waking state.  
  
Also, it is very easy to check that the fundamental laws of nature do not change before and after sleep. Based on this also, the waking state before and after sleep can be treated as same.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
