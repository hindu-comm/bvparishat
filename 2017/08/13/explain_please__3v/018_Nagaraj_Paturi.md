Sri Achut-ji and other members posing such questions,

  

1\. If you pose a question, having your answer to that question in your mind, reserving your answer to be brought forth only after others answer that question, please make it clear by saying 'I have my own answer to this question; I will come out with mine / I will surprise you with mine once I see your answers or once I realise that you have no answers'

  

2\. If you pose a question with a sincere jijnaasaa , please make that clear and then please don't put forth your answer to the same.

  

3\. If you are looking for an answer given to the question in the ancient Indian texts, please make that clear. If you are looking for answers from modern fields dealing with the issue, please make that clear. If you are looking for answers from neither the ancient nor modern studies, but from one's own meditation on the topic and the aantaraanubhava resulting from it, please make it clear. Then the answering member can also make it clear whether the answer is from an ancient text or modern studies or one's own meditation.
