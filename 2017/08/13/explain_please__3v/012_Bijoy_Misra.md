Excellent point. Timeकाल as a factor in the object space is an important milestone in

the philosophical system. काल could have its own interpretation in the context of

the universe and life. 

We are trying to present many of these concepts together in a sketch for our seminar

in Oct. I will post if we reasonably capture various nuances. We are mostly ignorant,

but we are trying to compile whatever we think we understand and we can reasonably

explain.

Best regards,
