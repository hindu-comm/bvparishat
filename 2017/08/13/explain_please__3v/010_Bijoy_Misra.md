Nagarajji,

I was responding to the post of interpretation of dreams and their relevance

in following up. Dream as a neurological event and its interpretation could

be the question. May be my point counters the proposition. It was my reaction

to "knowledge" versus "opinion". The transition of the vedic sat to the

upanisadic satya was what I was trying to convey. Possibly I failed to articulate.

Gita is just an event where we congregate to reflect on satya which

apprars to be deductive, but asymptotic.

Sorry for any distraction my posting caused. Thought to share how the

youth moves away from us. I believe we can do more by empirical reasoning

than prescriptive thinking.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
