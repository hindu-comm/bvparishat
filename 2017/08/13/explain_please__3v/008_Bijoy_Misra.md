Dear friends,

  

You all might do a tremendous service if you may orient your discussion such that

you can communicate it to a young person in his/her teenage. Please communicate

in your local school groups or youth centers. A researcher or a scholar is also an

educator to the public. Education demands conviction for the student to appreciate.

We must resort to the upanisad way of learning through analysis than the puranic

way of learning through listening. We have to rediscover the sense of any belief

through deep introspection and analysis.

  

Such is my opinion after having the seen my motherland and the faith from a

distance for several decades. We need retelling through absorption than repeating

or quoting books. The latter has been imposed through years of subjugation.

We have to recover from the shackles of the imposition and resort to examination.

Please help empower students to think and discriminate than to accept and follow.

Empowering people is the message of India. I will do Gita reading today at the

Temple.
