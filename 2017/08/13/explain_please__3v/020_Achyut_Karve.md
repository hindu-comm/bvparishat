Dear Scholars,  
  
How can one understand anything written in the scriptures without self introspection. Questions help one introspect which help in understanding the intent of the scriptures because the scriptures are themselves the result of deep introspection or meditation. Questions also help directing ones thinking thus creating the preconditions for an answer.

The questions that I have put are impromptu. They are not premeditated. Had I known the right answers I would surely have written them.

Now may I hope the questions are taken in the right spirit.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
