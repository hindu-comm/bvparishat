One devotee has a dream1.

  

In that dream, he has a dream2.

  

That devotee sees in his dream of God appearing and advising the devotee to go and search his Idols in a certain place. Then very happily the devotee does as per the Divine Advice and most surprisingly he finds the Idols as accurately Advised by God in the dream.

  

The devotee wakes up from his dream1.

  

He realisesthat that dream1 , in which he has the dream2 is unreal.
