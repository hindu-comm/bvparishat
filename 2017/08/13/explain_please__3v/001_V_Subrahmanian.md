You may refer to these lines of Shankara in his Brahmasutra bhashyam 3.2.4:

  

मायामात्रत्वात्तर्हि न कश्चित्स्वप्ने परमार्थगन्धोऽस्तीति — नेत्युच्यते —सूचकश्चहि स्वप्नो भवति भविष्यतोः साध्वसाधुनोः ; तथा हि श्रूयते —[‘यदा कर्मसु काम्येषु स्त्रियꣳ स्वप्नेषु पश्यति। समृद्धिं तत्र जानीयात्तस्मिन्स्वप्ननिदर्शने’ (छा. उ. ५। २। ८)](http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Chandogya?page=5&id=Ch_C05_S02_V08&hl=%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%81%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%81%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%EA%A3%B3%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%81%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%C2%A0%E0%A5%A4%20%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%82%20%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%20%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%87)इति ; तथा ‘पुरुषं कृष्णं कृष्णदन्तं पश्यति स एनं हन्ति’ इत्येवमादिभिः स्वप्नैरचिरजीवित्वमावेद्यत इति श्रावयति ; आचक्षते च स्वप्नाध्यायविदः — कुञ्जरारोहणादीनि स्वप्ने धन्यानि, खरयानादीन्यधन्यानि’ इति ; मन्त्रदेवताद्रव्यविशेषनिमित्ताश्च केचित्स्वप्नाः सत्यार्थगन्धिनो भवन्तीति मन्यन्ते। तत्रापि भवतु नाम सूच्यमानस्य वस्तुनः सत्यत्वम् ; सूचकस्य तु स्त्रीदर्शनादेर्भवत्येव वैतथ्यम् , बाध्यमानत्वादित्यभिप्रायः ; तस्मादुपपन्नं स्वप्नस्य मायामात्रत्वम् ॥

So, according to Shankara, the falsity, vaithatyam, of dream events and objects, is not incompatible with the reality that dreams can sometimes indicate. There are instances of Srinivasa Ramanujan, getting solutions to his mathematical problems in dream which he attributed to Lord Narasimha, his ishta devata's grace.
