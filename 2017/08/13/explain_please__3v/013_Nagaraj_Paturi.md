To Sri G S S Murthy-ji or to whomsoever it is relevant,

  

Dream is just an analogy in Advaita Vedanta. Nowhere in authentic Advaita Vedantic texts is it said that Jagat *IS*dream.

  

Advaita's position is that, since sarvam khalvidam brahma, Brahmatva of Jagat is Satyam. Jagattva of Brahman is a false perception.

  

Dream is brought only as an analogy to this false perception.



Nowhere is it said that Jagat is not there. It is only said that Jagat is not there the way it is perceived. It is said that It ***IS*** there AS BRAHMAN. But is being perceived not as it actually IS.

  

"the only difference between reality and dream is there is continuity in reality whereas dream is discontinuous" is just a statement of normal observation.

  

But during modern times, scientific knowledge helped people to understand that

  

what is cognized during the dream

  

is not the cognition of what is not there as being there,

  

but it is the cognition ofwhat is there inside the dreaming individual as being outside that individual

  

and is the cognition of what is abstract in a concrete form.

  

The analogy of dream to the perception of Jagat has the following aspects of auchitya:

  

Brahman /Brahmattva of Jagat is an abstract aspect and Jagat / Jagattva of Brahman is a concrete aspect.

  

Realisingthe Brahmattva of Jagat (including the observed and the observer ) is an introspective/inward/subjective process. Watching the inside aspect. This process helps in realising that the Brahman which is the actual form of Jagat can be experienced inside. Brahman is both in its subjective (within /inside) and objective (without/outside)aspects. In itsobjective (without/outside)aspect, it is being perceived as Jagat. This perception is being compared to the process of dream where the inside is being cognized as the outside.

  

निजांतर्गतम् पश्यन्नात्मनि मायया बहिरिवोद्भूतं यथा निद्रया (दक्षिणामूर्ति स्तोत्रम् )

  

Please noteयथा निद्रया. It is just an analogy.

  

please noteनिजांतर्गतम्. Dream isनिजांतर्गतम् (which is a modern knowledge ) (Dream is in factनिजांतर्गतम् but बहिरुद्भूतम्।) being known in Indic Knowledge Traition, by the time of composition ofदक्षिणामूर्ति स्तोत्रम् is amazing!
