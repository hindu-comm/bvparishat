Sri Kalyan K garu,

  

\>In some places both states are given same treatment while in other places both states are differentiated.

  

---- Many pairs of concepts in many studies/fields have similarities and differences. In aspects where they have similarities, they are given the same treatment and in aspects where there are differences they are given different treatment.

  

I never realised that such a discerning can baffle some and create an impression of confusion in them.
