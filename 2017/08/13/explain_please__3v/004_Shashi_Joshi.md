1\. It is helpful to have a subject line that summarises or hints at the content

  

2\. ज्ञान कर्म भक्ति are different but somewhat overlapping ways to walk your path. None is superior. The end state of your own conscious being should be - some detachment to the unreal.

  

Everyone has mind, body and 'heart', thinking, doing and feeling.

These 3 yoga paths address these 3, which we all have to some extent.

  

A bhakta is not mindless bodyless atma.

A jnani is not merely software with no body or feeling.

A karmayogi is also not a thoughtless, heartless automaton.

  

When one starts to split hair between theoretical -vaitism and proven path, and rejwct other paths absolutely (and not rejecting only for self) one starts to lose the path while remaining attached to the path and the associated aham.

  

Having a dream about icons and statues of a form of god is itself total maya. And finding one, if proven that it was without setup, is also totally maya.

  

Formful vishnu is maya, formful shiva is maya, as is formful devi a maya.

These forms are only for us to understand the abstract concept and to feel them.
