Sirs

I have a serious question in Vaithatya prakaram of Mandukya Upanishad.

Briefly stated, waking state is vithatam as much as dream state. It has been proved without any doubt by Adi Shankara and His ParamaGuru with which my intellect accepts.

However, I have a question for further clarifications from learned people of our group.

Question begins:

One devotee sees in his dream of God appearing and advising the devotee to go and search his Idols in a certain place. Then very happily the devotee does as per the Divine Advice and most surprisingly he finds the Idols as accurately Advised by God in the dream.

Now, according to Purva Paksha, including me for a while, this incidence proves without any doubt that Advaita falls in a trap and also fails all together because dream state and waking state are connected and neither of these two states are vithatam. All Bhaktas in Dwaita and Visitadvaita are proven correct and devotion wins and one is in danger by following Advaita philosophy or Jnana Marga.

Hence, I feel it is better to stick to Devotion on God rather than travelling in Advaithic path which looks scientific and simple but complex to achieve.

Shall I then conclude to have more devotion and wait for Jnana to come automatically as a corollary of devotion. Advaitha ( my favorite absolute science) is to be given a bye and I will have to tread the path of Bhakti alone in case I am not convinced of proper explanation to my question.

Awaiting response please. Regards to all the members.
