Abhyankarji,  
I appreciate.  
Please send me some melodies and some lyrics  

either privately or post here (others might benefit).  

Also it would help to have any story/research on the origin of the meter or the style.  

I am trying to educate people that India is larger than the region we come from!  

We have to have strong research on pre-vedic culture and language.  

Best regards,  

BM
