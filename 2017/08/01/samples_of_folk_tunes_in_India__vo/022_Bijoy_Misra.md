Srivatsaji,

  

Good. Achyutji's point is right. Kirtan could be a later addition.

Please check if good studies are made. Paturiji may help.

  

India must be reach in these cultural traditions. Pure folk songs are

possibly made up by bards who could be an institution in themselves.

Bards might act as social reformers and educational resources

for the masses. It is possible that they have to develop an art form that

would entertain and educate. Such art form is certainly a late night effort

when the day's noise is quiet and mind is more relaxed. I would visit

such performances with my mother during my early childhood. Lately

I am thinking about the significance of art in retaining a culture.

  

Good artistic rendition in right setting possibly touches us and lets us

reflect on the story. There is a certain difference between passive

entertainment and active reflection. Legends, stories and their narration

could be a part of of the artistic process. Art of telling a story becomes

a science by itself. It needs exploration.

  

In the west, the folk stories talk about suffering, pain and betrayal.

Stories are evolving. My thinking is that a folklore must associate

life with nature to let one think larger. The nature is earth, forests,

river and the sky. A folklore would reduce individuality and would

put us in the larger context of the universe.

  

Some more stray thoughts.

  

Best regards,

BM
