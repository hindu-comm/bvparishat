अभंग and ओवी are two tunes, I guess, very typical of Marathi compositions especially the devotional and philosophical ones. For example entire दासबोध by Saint Ramdas, spiritual precept of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, also entire तुकारामगाथा of Saint Tukaram, contemporary of Saint Ramdas both these are in अभंग-meter.

  

भावार्थदीपिका alias ज्ञानेश्वरी of Saint ज्ञानेश्वर is his commentary on Gita. It has 9100 verses in ओवी-meter.
