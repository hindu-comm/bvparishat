Dear friends,

I might have mentioned before about our South Asia Poets' Group here.

We are meeting to explore India's folk literature coming Sunday.

I would appreciate any pointer to any collection of tunes and melodies

of tunes in interior pockets of India. Of course I would love to read any

analytic paper on the subject dealing with the duration, prosody variation

and brain function.

Thank you.
