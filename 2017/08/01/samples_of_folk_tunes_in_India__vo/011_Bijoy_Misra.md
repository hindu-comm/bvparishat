Paturiji,

I also have difficulty with the phrase ":ethnomusicology"

Who are the "ethno" here?

Also a good definition, why something is called "folk"?

Is it by convention or does it have any basis?

I will very much appreciate to study and analyze if I can.

I am interested in the brain function producing a tune.

Best regards,

BM
