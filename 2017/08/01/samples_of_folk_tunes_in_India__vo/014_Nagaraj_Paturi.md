**\>**I also meanwhile looked through Wikipedia on "ethnomusicology"
and

read the extremely superficial story.

  

Wikipedia says

**  
**

Ethnomusicologyis the study of music from the cultural and social aspects of the people who make it. It encompasses distinct theoretical and methodical approaches that emphasize cultural, social, material, *cognitive, biological,* and other dimensions or contexts of musical behavior, instead of only its isolated sound component. ( emphasis mine )

  

  

  

\>"ethno" is not "non-western".

  

It further says:  

  

During its early development from comparative musicology ***in the 1950s***, ethnomusicology ***was*** primarily oriented toward non-[Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world")music, but for several decades has included the study of all and any musics of the world (including Western art music and popular music) from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives. ( emphasis mine )  

  

We can not have the cake and eat it too.
