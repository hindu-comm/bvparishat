Dear Paturiji,

  

I used to attend various lectures on ethnic culture, anthropology,

and language when I got interested in the languages. I did observe

a big gulf between the subjects and the researchers. The studies

are not objective, mostly comparative. We must throw away

the artificial reference model. Possibly Indian scholars should

create their own comparative mythology and anthropology by

creating their own standard. Russia, China, Japan have escaped

this "comparative" business. India has succumbed. Hope she

rejects soon.

  

Anyway, these are political issues and I am not so interested.

My view is that we must study the original and create a framework

to study.  It is not useful to know what anyone has thought about

anything that I can observe myself. One won't know unless one

breathes the air on site and gets a feels of the "culture"..

Music is not mechanical, it is aesthetic. It needs ingrained

experience to appreciate and study. Others can learn and

perform, but would be unable to feel it, just like we are unable

to "feel" the "other" music. "feeling" is different than understanding.


Most observational interpretations could be erroneous, possibly are!

Unlike physical sciences, social observation needs assimilation.

One does not "touch" it, one must "experience" it.

  

Sorry, I am digressing. I will study more. Please send me any

papers on your own field studies.

  

Best regards,

BM
