Its a huge world.

  

One interesting area is Marga-Desi discussion which is part of folk-classical interface issue.

  

Carnatic classical = Vedic music + south Indian folk music

  

Hindustani classical = Vedic music + north Indian folk music.

  

In Telugu, Annamaachaarya of 15th century, has examples of folk song genres as part of his huge ( a few thousand song) lyric-repertoire. He discusses how adaptation of folk tunes etc. creates the 'dEs'i' musical world. 

  

In the case of other musician cum lyricist personalities of India, we may not find such a clear documentation of the fact that Carnatic classical = Vedic music + south Indian folk music;Hindustani classical = Vedic music + north Indian folk music. But evidences for this can be seen all over.

  

dEs'i of a certain period turned out to be mArga during the later period.

  

Today the actual singing styles of India, have a range of degrees of folk-Vedic amalgamations ranging from pure folk, through folkish classical and classicalish folk to 'pure' classical.
