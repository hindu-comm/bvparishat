Abhyankarji,

  

Please check if we have any recording in rural (untrained) voices.

The African Americans in this country are doing music without

any real training. I think certain music develops through listening

and practice. Possibly the folk music is done for individual expression

of liberation than for performing. i saw this.

What is the interpretation?

The leisureliness of structured music has to be a later development.

Some stray thought here.
