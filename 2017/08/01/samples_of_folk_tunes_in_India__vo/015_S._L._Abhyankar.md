An important aspect of metrical poetry is that some sense of music is implicit and inherent to the meter itself. My idea of mentioning अभंग and ओवी as meters of Marathi devotional compositions is inclusive of the music inherent to the meters. Entire मेघदूतम् is in मन्दाक्रान्ता meter. I am often left wondering whether the idea of choosing this meter was because it was a message to be carried by a cloud. For a cloud to digest and carry the message correctly, it becomes appropriate that the meter should be one that has an easy pace. "Easy pace" includes the music for the poetry.

  

Even श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता is a गीता. It is hence advocated that गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या. When rendering his advice to अर्जुन, श्रीकृष्णभगवान् never wanted to be harsh onअर्जुन. Arjuna was already so much disturbed !

  

The beauty of metrical poetry is that you do not need a music director to set music to it. Music is inherent.

  

In Maharashtra some families have a custom to spend nights awake. For that, they summon troupes who sing गोंधळ-songs, all through the night. The songs are devotional. But the pitch is often high, because their music is supposed to help people stay awake. Interestingly I was recently in SAFI, a sleepish city in Morocco. There in the hotel for 5-6 nights some music and singing was going on all through the night. It disturbed me alright. But it also every day reminded me ofगोंधळ custom in Maharashtra.

  

One may find even doctoral studies done under the aegis of universities in Maharashtra on many such folk-lore and maybe, also of the music that goes with them.

  

Apart fromगोंधळ, there is a deity मल्हारी मार्तंड also known as खंडोबा of a place known as जेजुरी. The music and songs sung as devotion to that deity are very special. Thattradition isvery old.

  

भावार्थदीपिका alias ज्ञानेश्वरी of Saint ज्ञानेश्वर is itself of the year 1290, i.e. more than seven centuries old. Whereasज्ञानेश्वरीis inओवीmeter, [हरिपाठाचे अभंग](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdL2tuGWpBE) also bySaint ज्ञानेश्वर are inअभंग-meter.

  

Compositions inअभंग-meter have typically three lines of six letters each and the fourth line is of four letters. There are some other variants also, but this pattern is most common.
