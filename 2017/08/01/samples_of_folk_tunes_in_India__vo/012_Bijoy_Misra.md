Dear scholar friends,

Here is a sample of what I am looking for

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvkQwTd5UzI>  

  

This is from southern Orissa, the lyric is about three hundred year old,

the technique of beats through striking pieces of wood could be much

older (I cannot estimate). It is an hour long recording. You may watch

if you appreciate performing arts.

  

They are telling the story of Lakshmana being hit by Ravana and then

healed through the mountain medicine. The interesting part is the story

telling aspect where they help create emotion through rhythm, speed and

tone modulation. Various pieces of social instructions are cleverly added.

Not only it becomes a performance, it also becomes an educational

exercise through musical immersion. The technique is the rapid escalation

of variety of moods through quick succession. The science of mood escalation

is lately being analyzed. These people know empirically. To wade through

all rasa(s) in an hour could need some experimentation. I would like

to know if this technique of packing is widely practiced. 

  

I have requested our group here to search in their own regions. People

here are technically savvy, but are not much into culture or literature.


Most are passive in these and see movies for leisure. They never had

the opportunity to look and reflect. it is a function of schooling and

environment. So, I am leaning on my friends back home.

  

I also meanwhile looked through Wikipedia on "ethnomusicology" and

read the extremely superficial story. "ethno" is not "non-western".
There

is a vocabulary problem. The fundamental question would be

if "music" is in the voice or if it is produced through "instruments".
The "folk"

music, I would think, is vocal with some percussion or flute accompaniment. 

Hence, the hypothesis would be that the human tune is not a function of the

language. Such tune could be a human signature. But we don't know its

composition.

  

Each person can do the experiment on his/her own feelings of

liberation (release of emotion) and the expressions of melodies. 

(Valmiki discovers shloka, but he did not record his discovery!)

  

You can send me any melodies privately or you may post here.

  

Best regards,

BM
