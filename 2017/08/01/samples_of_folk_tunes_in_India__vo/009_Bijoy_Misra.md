Paturji,

They mostly create descriptions.

I need analysis on why a tune exists.

My thinking has been that we are flooded with descriptive material

and also teach them without thinking. We know the stanza counts

in the Vedas, but we need to know how Gayatri came to be.

Please guide us through your or other analytic work.

There are large ramifications.

Best regards,

BM
