Dear members,  
  

I am in need of an article by Prof S D Joshi 'Adjectives and Substantives as a single class in the Part of Spech' in Journal of the University of Poona , Humanities Section, 25, 1966 p 19-30 (Also indexed as JCASS A 9)  
  

Does anybody have a pdf?  
  

With kind regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
