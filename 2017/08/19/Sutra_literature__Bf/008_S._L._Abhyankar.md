नमस्ते श्रीमन् बिजोय्-मिश्र-महोदय !

These days I am getting to think that most of Sanskrit literature is a subject, not of lexical translation, but of "interpretation". For example the महावाक्यम् - सोऽहमस्मि can be translated as "He is me" or "I am He". As interpretation it would encompass the entire अद्वैततत्त्वज्ञानम् "He and I are not different at all. We are same, rather, we are one entity only". In ईशावास्योपनिषत् thisमहावाक्यम् is a part of the statement योऽसावसौ पुरुषः सोऽहमस्मि (यः असौ असौ पुरुषः सः अहम् अस्मि = (my interpretation) "Who this ? This PuruSa ! He is me only.).

  

I think, being cryptic is the fundamental of not only the सूत्रवाङ्मयम् but much of Sanskrit literature. Even in गीता, where basic purpose was to clear अर्जुनस्य संमोह, in 13'27 it does no better than saying यः पश्यति स पश्यति (one who sees, sees).

  

In Hindi they say समझदारको इशारा काफी होता है Suggestion or hint is enough for one, who has an understanding mind.

  

Yes, "understanding mind" is the basic presumption. All effort to explain anything to someone, who does not have an understanding mind is wasteful. Hence in 18'67 inगीता this caution, not to waste effort with people not having "understanding mind", is well elaborated इदं ते नातपस्काय नाभक्ताय कदाचन/ न चाशुश्रूषवे वाच्यम् .. Even inफलश्रुतिof श्रीगणपत्यथर्वशीर्षम् - इदमथर्वशीर्षमशिष्याय न देयम् I take it thatअशिष्यorअशुश्रुषु is simply one, who does not have an "understanding mind".

  

All our scriptures are only for those, who have an understanding mind. By corollary, they are for everyone, who has an understanding mind. "Understanding mind" is the basic condition and that puts aside all other conditions of caste, creed, religion, language, culture, color of the skin, gender, age, education, aptitude, where and when on earth you are, whatever. The scriptures are basically universal in their spirit and hence eternal. That is why they survive and will survive.

  

It becomes wrong to brand them as Hindu scriptures. Nowhere in the scriptures, one would find the word Hindu. Unwitty people are misled to think that anything in Sanskrit is Hindu.

  

Sorry for this digression. But yes, "understanding mind" is the fundamental of not justसूत्रवाङ्मयम् but for much of Sanskrit literature.
