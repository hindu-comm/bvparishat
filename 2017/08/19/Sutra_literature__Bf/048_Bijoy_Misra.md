Nagarajji,

alpAksram may not be a unique characteristic though Panini tries hard in situations.

He would also go for longer constructs if warranted. Other sutra literature are

seen to have long constructs. Actually my inquiry has been to find the need and the

characteristic of the construction.

Some of the flash theories have also to be carefully qualified to apply in this context.

Best regards,

BM
