Sri Achyut-ji,

  

AA's lakshaNa is, in most cases, made up of several different Sutras.

  

One lakshaNa statement may include several sutras arranged one after the other.

  

Statement thus formed may include a few pratyaahaara expressions which express a list of phones.

  

Maheshwara sutras is a table that helps create the list of phones that can be 'called' to apply the lakshaNa statement 'for siddhi of' (to generate) the lakshya - expression.

  

Thus Maheshwara Sutras are not directly lakshaNa of any lakshya. They participate in the siddhi of several different lakshyas.

  

On what corpus of lakhyas was the whole book focusing, Prof. Madhav Deshpande and other scholars published several articles.

  

So if you are interested in knowing why a certain phone is not included in the table, in the generation of which corpus of lakshyas this table participates, you must read those articles.
