\>At best ‘asandhigdham’ is a pious wish; but as an ideal to strive for, it is perfect. It is a near equivalent of “accuracy and rigour”
not so exactly expected to be aimed always in science subjects, but certainly so in Mathematics.

  

"not so exactly expected to be aimed always in science subjects"

  

not so exactly but expected, right?  

  

Rigour is a different aspect. It is a feature of the method, reasoning, logic , argument etc. also not limited to be the quality of a statement of definition, law, theory etc.

  

Whereas accuracy applies to expressions such asdefinition, law, theory etc

  

asandigdham is unambiguous.

  

ativyaaptavyaaptasambhavaadidosharaahitya brings asandigdhataa.

  

In any case , ancient texts used asandigdhataa not in the case of mathematics but in the context of sutras of sutragranthas only.
