Nagarajji, Abhyankarji,

I have read some of these and understand the basic thrust.

What I am looking for is any sAkhA literature or sections in

brAhmaNa literature which might suggest codification.

It appears to me as a technique like we do index cards these days.

I would like to see any analysis on the selection of information

and the technique (syntax, style etc) of the process. It seems

technical to me than just empirical. I see it as an intermediate

development before the shAstra literature is created.

I assume some original literature might exist, hence the query.

Best regards,

BM
