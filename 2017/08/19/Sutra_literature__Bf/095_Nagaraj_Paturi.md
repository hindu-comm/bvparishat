Email posts, like books, for that matter, like any piece of communication have anubandhachatushTaya. My अधिकारी was the member to whose post I was responding. My prayojanam was to cater to his prayojanam. I remember his enquiry on l̥ . My answer to his question on lakshya and lakshaNa was based on that.

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

As an upAsaka of my Guru in both senses of the term and vriddhas and agrajas like Prof. Korada, may I present my vidyaa as far as it is prasanna to me? If there are any flaws in the following argument, they are totally due to the deficiencies in my upaasanaa and not those of upaasya(s):

  

अ इ उ ण् , ऋ लृ क्...... इति माहेश्वराणि सूत्राणि अणादिसंज्ञार्थानि ।  

  

implies each of अण्, अक्, अच्, हल् etc. is a संज्ञा। संज्ञा here means a technical term of a śāstra. Particularly here, it means the technical term of the śāstra. The śāstra here means AA.

  

The meaning of artha inअणादिसंज्ञार्थानिis different from the meaning of lakshya in the pair of technical terms lakshya and lakshaNa, though in a day to day usage artha and lakshya, in a certain sense are synonyms of each other.

  

LakshaNa in the pair Lakshya - LakshaNa refers to the (description/statement of) the 'rule'/principle/ (set of )common feature(s) shared by several different lakshyas (instances/cases/examples/usages/observed facts/pieces of data).

  

अ इ उ ण् , ऋ लृ क्...... इति माहेश्वराणि सूत्राणि अणादिसंज्ञार्थानि । is not saying thatमाहेश्वराणि सूत्राणि are providing thethe (description/statement of) the 'rule'/principle/ (set of )common feature(s) shared by several different lakshyas (instances/cases/examples/usages/observed facts/pieces of data) namelyअण्, अक्, अच्, हल् etc.  

  

अ इ उ ण् , ऋ लृ क्...... इति माहेश्वराणि सूत्राणि अणादिसंज्ञार्थानि । meansअ इ उ ण् , ऋ लृ क्...... इति माहेश्वराणि सूत्राणि are *for the purpose of* saṁjñās (technical terms, here, grouping technical terms) likeअण्, अक्, अच्, हल् etc.

  

Ifthe माहेश्वरसूत्रs are लक्षणम् of thesaṁjñāslike अण् , अक् etc., thenमाहेश्वरसूत्रs are to be taken asthe (description/statement of) the 'rule'/principle/ (set of )common feature(s) shared by several different lakshyas (instances/cases/examples/usages/observed facts/pieces of data) namelyअण्, अक्, अच्, हल् etc.

  

LakshaNa statements in a grammar book may be in the form of definitions of technical terms used in the book or the statements delineating the common features of sveral usages in the language that is being described/prescribed by the grammar book.

  

माहेश्वरसूत्रs are neither of these is my humble opinion placed at the feet of gurus .  

  

Obediently,
