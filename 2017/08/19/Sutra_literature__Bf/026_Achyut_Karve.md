Dear Scholars,

If I am not mistaken any creative writing invariably has to visualise the subject matter and put it into parts. With the Ashtadhyayi we find that he has split the subject matter primarily into eight parts and has subsequently divided each such part into four parts each. This process is even followed today while writing articles or books.

What Sanskrit provides is that they need not be written down as is necessary for a prose writing and the author can commit it to memory in the process of drafting.

However the problem with the Ashtadhyayi is that the author has not stated the axioms separately and instead has included them into the subject matter itself. This may be the cause for differences cropping up subsequently.

Any writing needs a starting point and rightly Panini has started it with letters. However from there onwards he takes for granted that students know the Vedas or spoken Sanskrit. And it is here that the difficulty starts. Students tend to interpret the Ashtadhyayi in terms of their own usage because they have already picked up the tongue causing confusion when the contrary is expected.

They are these issues that have been addressed by Katyayana, Panini and later by Bhartrihari and some more.

Therefore for reconstructing the Ashtadhyayi as was envisioned by Panini we need to go in the reverse order because they are these later authors who have described the preconditions on which the Ashtadhyayi was formulated. Patanjali therefore often refers to स्वभाव of Panini.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
