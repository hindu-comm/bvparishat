I wonder why the passages of Bharata and Abhinavagupta dealing with the Sangraha, Karika and Nirukta have not been discussed.

The basic question raised by Bijoy Mishraji was :It has to do with the origin of sutra literature like any analysis why the

style developed.

See the attachment. I think that the passages contain some hints about the formation of Sutra style.
