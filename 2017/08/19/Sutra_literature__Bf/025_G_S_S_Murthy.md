Dear Prof.Paturiji,

I do not think it is necessary to believe that Panini saw the whole of Ashtadhyayi in a flash. He would have borrowed several ideas from his predecessors. He would have worked on it for decades and like any truth seeker, refined his premises as he went on applying his rules, created various divisions like ganas, lakaaraas etc and was forced to make set,anit,vet lists and finally several lists of exceptions.

Regards,

Murthy
