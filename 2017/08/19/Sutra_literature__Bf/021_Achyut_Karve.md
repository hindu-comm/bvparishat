Dear Scholars,

If I am allowed I feel that as said by Bhartrihari we need to realise that in the sutra texts the whole is bigger or beyond the sum of its parts. Thus a Sutra needs to be visualised before it is put in prose form in which ever language it be. This is because sutra literature pieces together experiential realities rather than mere thoughts which are largely based on reasoning.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
