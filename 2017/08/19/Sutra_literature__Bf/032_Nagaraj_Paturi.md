Dear Dr Joshi,

  

When someone says, a phenomenon that occurred in the past can be explained using a certain theory, that does not mean that the theory was known by the time of occurence of that theory.

  

When someone says, the action of a person in the past can be explained using a certain theory it does not mean that the theory was known to the person that executed the action.

  

Why past, if I explain the action of a contemporary person , it does not mean that the person executing the action knew the theory.

  

Moreover the point being discussed here includes the aspect that the person in whom the process of incubation, insight etc. happen is usually unconscious of this process.

  

Applying these points to the case of Panini's composition of Ashtadhyayi

  

when I explain Panini's composition using sphōṭa theory, it ***does not mean***

  

a\. sphōṭa theory was known *by the time of* Panini

  

b\. sphōṭa theory was known *to* Panini

  

c\. Panini *used* sphōṭa theory in his composition.

  

That said, I did point out the coincidence/interesting aspect that Panini's composing process is being explained using a theory propounded by a sage/scientist belonging, of course during a time later to him, to his tradition.
