The sphOTa theory of flash or the insight (flash) theory of modern cognitive science or not romantic theories nor are they ideas of revelation.

  

In my very first response in the present thread to the idea contradicting Panini's visioning of his creative work, I said the following:

I don't know whether those contradicting the idea of flash as applicable to the present case and as applied by me here in the present thread, read the theories cited by me from cognitive sciences either through the links provided by me or through some other source of their own. I don't know whether they studied the sphOTa theory of flash.

  

If they did they would not have confused a theory of cognition for an occult or a spiritual notion of revelation. 

  

The whole debate boils down to the following:

  

One side: AA resulted through a trial and error, observation to generalisation to more observation and then correction of previous generalisation and then to more observation and then to a better generalisation and so on, then a sutra and then correcting the sutra and so on writing and striking off , step by step gradual development of the whole book from zero idea to the whole idea, without any previous vision of the whole work.

  

The other side: All the observations and the generalisations based on that are done by the author with a greater efficiency than a one by one observation a huge number of, if not all observations and the generalisations based on them occurring with the entire picture occurring to the mind's eye at the same time, with all the intricate relationships between the parts and the whole of all these generalisations too occurring to the mind's eye at the same time, the scheme of how all the generalisations and their intricate relationships can be articulated through a set of intricately arranged and ordered sutras occurring to the mind's eye at the same time. Please remember that this process has observations in its background, skills and methods of generalisations in its background. But the distinction of this process lies in its quicker processing, in mind, of the broadest scope of observation and a quicker envisioning of the entire scheme of the book at the same time. Writing down of the book of the book begins only after such an envisioning of the whole work happens. Proposing this process does not imply saying Panini did not observe, did not study previous works etc. It just means that Panini was such a genius that he had a skill of quick and intricate processing of broadest range of his observations and the previous studies of them. The quickness or the speed of that processing is so great that it appears as though the whole work occurred as a flash to him.

  

I am arguing for this second side.
