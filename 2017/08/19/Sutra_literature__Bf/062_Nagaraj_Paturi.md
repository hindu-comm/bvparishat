\>The discussions have gone far away from the original question of optimality in linguistic representation

  

--- I agree, whether the original question was on 'of optimality in linguistic representation' or not, (I think it is not) , (I think, your words "has any among the inheritors of the tradition made attempts to work out the general principles behind*sūtra*formation; not just limited to Aṣṭādhyāyī but including a few other texts roughly belonging to the same period." rephrase the original question),

  

there was indeed a digression.

  

The flash theory discussion , which never had any emotional aspects in the thread , started with Sri Achyut-ji's following post:

I nearly supporting him quoted Prof. Peter Raster.

  

The ensuing discussion went on very dispassionate lines of debate between two opposing views about how Panini could have composed his "intellectual monument" (Bloomfield) that "antedated modern linguists by millennia" (H A Gleason).

  

I was trying to explain what was the intention of Prof. Peter Raster. I brought in Aha! moment theory of the Gestalt Psychology and sphOTa for that purpose.

  

I brought the discussion every time back to the original topic.

  

When the initiator wanted to know , away from the original question, what was the need for Sutras or Sutra works , yes, there is a scope for digression.
