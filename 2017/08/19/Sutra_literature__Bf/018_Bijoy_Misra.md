Nagarajji,

I "know" and I "read" are two different statements. I have read some of the stuff

but I could not decipher "how" sutra as a technique in literature might have come

to be. I "see" mathematical concepts of "indexing" through the process. I would

like to check if analysis on the matter exists..

A "sutra" seems to aim at compaction of space as well as compaction of concepts.

Normally the scientific process goes for an "observation" to an analysis. A "sutra"

tries to condense an analysis to a phrase, which has the potential to be expanded. 

One can think that the metaphorical representation and use of adjectives could

also be a part of the "sutra" process. it could have some clue how we create

memory and unravel stories.

I am extremely sorry if I don't articulate right. Possibly I should do more research

before putting a question. Let me keep on looking.

Best regards

Bijoy Misra.
