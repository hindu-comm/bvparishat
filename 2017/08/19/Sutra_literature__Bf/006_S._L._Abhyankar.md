नमस्ते श्रीमन् बिजोय्-मिश्र-महोदय !

Your message has become quite confusing to understand what focus is in your mind. In the previous message there was mention of "sUtra"-literature. In this message there is mention of (1) "..sAkhA literature or sections in

brAhmaNa literature.." (2) "..an intermediatedevelopment before the shAstra literature is created..." And you also mention (3) "..some original literature.."

In your two messages together you have used the word "literature" in combination with five other words, which I have marked in magenta colour.
