Dear Madhav Deshpandeji,

I would be more than grateful if you can provide me information on the attempts previous to Panini Vis a vis the composition of an alphabet for Sanskrit either for instructing students how to recite the letters  
or for the purpose of writing.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
