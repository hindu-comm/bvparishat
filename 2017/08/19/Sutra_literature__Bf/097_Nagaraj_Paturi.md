If lakshaNa is used in the sense of definition of a technical term, and if a technical term can be called a lakshya in that connection/context, may be we could see Maahes'vara suutras as helping to form lakshaNa of various pratyaahaara based technical terms such as aN, ak, hal etc.

  

But vyavahaarah padaas'rayah refers to padas of lokavyavahaara IMHO.
