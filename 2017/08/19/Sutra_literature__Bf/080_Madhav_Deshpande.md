Dear Misraji,

  

  The available evidence points to gradual development of the science of grammar in ancient India, and Pāṇini's grammar is the only complete surviving version of this ancient period. Pāṇini may be said to have given it a full form, as you say. However, in the absence of grammatical works of his predecessors, it is not possible to make a viable comparative statement. For reasons not clearly known to us, in many branches of ancient knowledge systems, only one ancient exemplar survives. This is true of Nirukta, Mīmāṃsā and many other branches.
The surviving works clearly refer to numerous predecessors, and so we know that they were not the only works of those branches. Yet, other works somehow fell behind in circulation, and eventually were lost.
