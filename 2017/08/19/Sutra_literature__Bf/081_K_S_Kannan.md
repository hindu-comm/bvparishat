In response to GSSM and NP.

  

Not only that.

  

Laws such as of Kepler have been arrived at independently by machines (Artificial Intelligence) from a mass of data provided to them (which includes even redundant data).

  

There may therefore be a method to test whether Panini has done what he set out to do with high efficiency - the comprehensiveness and compaction he must have sought to bring in or whether there can be any "improvements" on him, or even whether a totally new paradigm can be possible.

  

Given the fact that linguistic data are not as easily amenable to law-making as the data of the physical world, owing to the fluid, and even protean, nature of the linguistic realm abounding in allotropy - synchronic as well as diachronic - it is yet not an impossible dream that the *nāma-prapañca* can draw inspiration from*rūpa-prapañca*(even if involving/introducing some additional/different features); after all the *nāma-rūpa-vyākaraṇa* was done by the same "author".
