True Sri Gobind-ji, very much true.Those like me and Prof. Kannan, who cited Gestalt theory did so to say that this flash (the Aha! thing) is universal. sphOTa theory is also a theory applicable to all.

  

Potentially flash of a thing like AA can happen to all humans.

  

But as has been repeatedly said , that requires all the observations, generalisations, identification of intricate relation between those generalisations etc. with a GaruDa drishTi (thanks to Sri Jagannatha Sarma-ji ), as happened with Panini.

  

Now its history, record, that there is one and only AA and there is one and only Panini, who had its flash. It happened because one and only Panini had all the observations, generalisations, identification of intricate relation between those generalisations etc. with a GaruDa drishTi ..
