Dear Prof.Deshpande and other scholars,

My CONJECTURE on how Panini might have started on Sutra formulation is based on my successful attempt to write a computer program for Sandhis. This program is based on a set of clear rules spelt out in a Primer "Second Sanskrit Course" by MS Gole. The program does not try to decipher Panini sutras and arrive at the result.

  

Sandhi Sutras form a compact subset of Panini Sutras and seem to be self sufficient to codify Sandhi rules. Panini might have first tried to work out a set of Sutras for Sandhi and he would have been successful. That might have made him think, " Pretty good! Can I extend it further to cover the whole of Sanskrit Grammar?" And I leave it here.

I am willing to be contradicted and made fun of. 

Regards,

Murthy
