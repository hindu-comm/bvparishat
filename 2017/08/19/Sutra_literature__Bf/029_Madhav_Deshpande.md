Dear Paturiji and colleagues,

  

  In this whole discussion of how Pāṇini may have composed his Aṣṭādhyāyī, it would be useful to remember Patañjali's description of how Pāṇini produced the sūtras:प्रमाणभूत आचार्योदर्भपवित्रपाणि: शुचाववकाशे प्राङ्मुख उपविश्य महता प्रयत्नेन सूत्राणि प्रणयति स्म. At least in Patañjali's conception of how Pāṇini produced his rules, it was not a flash of insight, but a deliberative act of great mental effort.
The huge amount of details, references to previous teacher's opinions, recording variation of usage in different regions and scholastic tradition, etc. suggests the same. It was a long deliberative act involving collection of enormous data of language use, and an intensive study of the previous grammatical works. The fact that numerous sūtras of Pāṇini are virtually identical with sūtras of the Prātiśākhyas, and with the few known sūtras of other teachers like Āpiśali, shows that he had done an intensive study of a wide ranging grammatical literature, and then composed his rules. This is what I mean by a "deliberative act of great mental effort."
