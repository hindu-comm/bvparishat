नमस्ते श्रीमन् बिजोय्-मिश्र-महोदय !

Thinking of Sutras and mathematics  

1.  The शल्बसूत्राणि have primarily mathematics as their subject. 2.  Vedic mathematics is mathematical exposition expounded from select
    Sutras from the Vedas 3.  शिवसूत्राणि are primarily arrangement of vowels and consonants, the
    arrangement having inherent to it elements of set theory - All the
    14 sutras together make one big set of all phonemes. Each one of the
    14 sutras is a subset of the big set. Rather, sutras 1 to 4 make
    another subset of vowels and sutras 5 to 14 make the other subset of
    consonants. The concept of प्रत्याहार-s facilitates creation of
    large number of "intersection" sets, if I may say so. 4.  अष्टाध्यायी is one big algorithm, the अधिकारसूत्राणि serving as
    declarations of 'topics' or if I may say so, of subroutines.
    निषेधसूत्राणि serve as 'if-then-else' conditional statements.
5.  But every other सूत्र-वाङ्मयम् such as ब्रह्मसूत्राणि, योगसूत्राणि,
    श्रौतसूत्राणि may not have as much of mathematical logic. Even then
    sinceevery सूत्र-वाङ्मयम्has chapters in it means, there is
    arrangement and order, which should be prone to be deciphered.
