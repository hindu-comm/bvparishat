Dear Colleagues,

  

We do not have full access to grammatical works of Pāṇini's predecessors, but there are a few glimpses here and there found in quotations in commentarial literature. For example, Pāṇini7-3-95 reads तुरुस्तुशम्यमःसार्वधातुके, while Āpiśali's quoted rule reads तुरुस्तुशम्यम: सार्वधातुकासु छन्दसि. A comparison of these two rules reveals that the two grammarians are by and large using similar modes of formulating their rules, and they have a shared terminology. The difference is that while Pāṇini's rule is a general rule, Āpiśali's rule states that, in his observation, the particular phenomenon occurs only in chandas. There is another interesting quote regarding the views of Vyāḍi and Gālava: इकां यण्भिर्व्यवधानं व्याडिगालवयो:. Again this quotation suggests that Vyāḍi and Gālava had terminology like इक् and यण्, very similar to Pāṇini, and this further hints the possibility that these grammarians had a similar version of the Śivasūtras that may have allowed them to formulate these short forms. There is another interesting quote about the views of a grammarian named Bhāguri:

  वष्टि भागुरिरल्लोपमवाप्योरुपसर्गयो: ।

  आपं चैव हलन्तानां यथा वाचा निशा दिशा ।।

This quote suggests the possibility that Bhāguri not only had the short forms like हल्, further suggesting a shared version of the Śivasūtras, but his system also had terms like "lopa" and affixes like "āP", as they are found in Pāṇini's system. Such indications make it very clear that Pāṇini was not an entirely new grammarian, but that he followed a long line of previous grammarians, and made changes in their formulations as he saw fit. However, the shared style and terminology indicates a wide-spread tradition of grammatical science prior of Pāṇini's time.
