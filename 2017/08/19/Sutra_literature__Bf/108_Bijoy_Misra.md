Sundareswaranji,

Good finding. There might exist a document that analytically creates a time evolution

of styles of creating literature. On the face of it, a sutra appears as a teaching tool.

This is where I imagine the concept of indexing. How informative and meaningful

an "index" could be is another process of evolution.

My Natyashastra reading has stalled. Thank you for reminding. Each "mudrA"

in principle can be thought of as a sutra. In such situation a sutra becomes

a samjNA derived from a metaphor.

There is something called "working memory". Its organization appears to be mathematical

in nature. So we may speculate that the condensation or repackaging of information

was created to organize the working memory in order to create better access.

Jut a speculation.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
