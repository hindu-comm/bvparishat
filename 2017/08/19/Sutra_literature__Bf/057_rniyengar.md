The discussions have gone far away from the original question of optimality in linguistic representation, to issues that border on the emotional. Bijoy Mishra is trying to bring it back and Abhyankar ji has pointed out one characteristic by its ‘absence’. A general ‘presence’ is that of pre-defined abbreviations or (saṅjñā). There would be many other wares in the sophisticated intellectual toolbox, built in an ecosystem conducive for such literature. So I rephrase Mishraji’s question with an analogy. *Two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen combine to make one molecule of water.* All the words in this sentence are supposed to be understood by the Guru andŚiṣya*.*Such long sentences are represented as *sūtra* *aka* formula using Roman alphabets and Hindu numerals as subscripts; as is too well known. The background for understanding this in all its sophistication and complexity involves study of Chemistry from elementary level and going up and up further. This may be called a meta-language or by any other name for convenience. There are at least two evidences that Piṅgala and Bharata used the ‘meta-language’ concept to further their theories of prosody and music that are primarily ‘śravaṇendriya-janya’ like ‘Bhāṣā’, all the same remaining rigorous in terms of pattern recognition and presentation.

The Brahmāṇḍa purāṇa does not give a definition of Sūtra. Of course a Purāṇa is not expected to get into such issues. At best ‘asandhigdham’ is a pious wish; but as an ideal to strive for, it is perfect. It is a near equivalent of “accuracy and rigour” not so exactly expected to be aimed always in science subjects, but certainly so in Mathematics. Now, the question is, has any among the inheritors of the tradition made attempts to work out the general principles behind *sūtra* formation; not just limited to Aṣṭādhyāyī but including a few other texts roughly belonging to the same period.
