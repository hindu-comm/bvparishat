Sri G S S Murthy-ji,

  

You or your ideas don't deserve to be made fun of.

  

Just to bring fun into the discussion, let me say, we may try playing cricket. Sometimes we may play well too. But a Sachin, a Brian Lara, a Muttaiah Muralidharan or an Anil Kumble are a class in themselves.

  

Coming to the serious aspect, the exercises such as yours are very good to be used in a higher level Sanskrit class room, to teach students how laakshaNikas arrive at lakshaNa. By doing such exercise they realise that we are being guided by the lakshaNa book to follow the 'rule' inherent in the lashyas of the s'ishTas. 'We follow the s'ishTas not the lakshaNa' is learnt by them.

  

It gives them the confidence that everyone has a potential to become a Panini.

  

Only through such an exercise and realising the challenges through personal experience that they can appreciate the greatness of Panini.
