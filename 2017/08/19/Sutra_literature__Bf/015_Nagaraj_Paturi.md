Coming back to the original thread,

  

\>Your message has become quite confusing to understand what focus is in your mind.  

  

                                   
                 ---- Sri Abhyankar-ji

  

Sri Abhyankar-ji,

  

You are not alone/the first one to face this confusion from the posts of Sri Bijoy-ji.

  

\>In the previous message there was mention of "sUtra"-literature. In this message there is mention of (1) "..sAkhAliterature or sections in

\>brAhmaNaliterature.." (2) "..an intermediatedevelopment before theshAstraliterature is created..." And you also mention (3) \>"..someoriginalliterature.."

\>In your two messages together you have used the word "literature" in combination with five other words, which I have marked \>inmagentacolour.

  

                                   
                      ---- Sri Abhyankar-ji

  

This is the pattern. The initial question begins somewhere. You provide the answer taking the meaning of the initial question in the way any reasonable person would take.

  

Then comes the answer " I know all this stuff. What I am looking for is....." , taking the discussion to a different point than the initial question.

  

To be fair to him, we have to assume that he really knows all the stuff that we post in response to his question. But why did we assume that he was asking for that stuff? Are we at fault? Do we everytime misunderstand his intial question? To be fair to ourselves, we should consider that we understood his intial question on the basis of how he articulated it. Then where is the fault? Articulation. Better articulation from him may save our time and efforts. How I wish, we knew all that he knew about the issue while asking for help!
