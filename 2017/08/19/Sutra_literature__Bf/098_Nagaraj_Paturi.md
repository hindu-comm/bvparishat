As is my nature, I thought , 'there must be some reason for a respectable scholar calling Maaheshwara Sutras as lakshaNa. I found the following justification.

  

Definition is an answer to the question, What is X? To the question of say, What is अण् ? , ifअ इ उ ण् is taken as the answer, the sutraअ इ उ ण् an be treated as the definition or lakshaNa ofअण् . But for अक् , not one , but the sequence of two sutras अ इ उ ण् and ऋ लृ क् works as the definition or lakshaNa .

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

That said, when we say A A is a lakshaNa work, what do we mean? lakshaNa of what, do we mean, A A is? We mean that it provides the lakshaNa of Sanskrit language. From this point of view, what are the lakshyas of the lakshaNa(s) in A A? Expressions in Laukika and Vaidika Sanskrit are the lakshyas.

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Lakshya(s) of Natyashastra is (are) Natya performance(s).

  

Lakshyas of Sangeeta shastra are Music(al) renderings.

  

The term Rasa is not the lakshya of the lashaNa called Rasanishpatti sutra. The Rasa in theNatya performance(s) is the lakshya ofthe lashaNa called Rasanishpatti sutra.

  

Vibhaava, Anubhaava vyabhichaaree bhaava etc. are terms (samjnas) that form part of the Rasanishpatti sutra. Those terms are not the lakshaNa(s).

  

Can the definitions of these terms be treated as lakshaNa and these terms themselves as lakshyas?

  

May be in relation to each other, a term and its definition could be treated as lakshya and lakshaNa respectively.

  

But, at least, that is not what we mean when we say Natyashastra provides lakshaNa of Natya, its lakshya.
