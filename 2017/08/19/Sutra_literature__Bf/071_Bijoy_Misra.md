Prof Deshpande,

This could be the method of gradual accumulation.

So, one would think that the technique of compaction and

directive writing was developed and Panini gave it a full form

application (Kalidasa among the sutra practitioners!).

Prof Aklujkar gives a possible sketch for construction at the

end of his paper.. But it is possible to create a skeletal template

and then fill in through time.

Let me look s'ulba sutra literature and check if I can find any clues.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra.
