Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

प्रमाणभूत आचार्योदर्भपवित्रपाणि: शुचाववकाशे प्राङ्मुख उपविश्य महता प्रयत्नेन सूत्राणि प्रणयति स्म.  

  

does not contradict what I said.

  

When someone says, the painter knew his picture completely before starting to paint, it does not mean he spent a long time in painting.

  

In sculpting, they use the word subtractive process. It means that the sculpture knows his sculpture completely before starting to sculpt. The process of sculpting is just removing that part of the material that is not required to be there as per the vision of the sculptor. This does not mean that the sculptor takes days, weeks, months or even years to sculpt.
