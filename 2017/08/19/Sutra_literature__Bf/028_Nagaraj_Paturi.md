Dear Sri G S S Muthy-ji,

  

When it is said that some creative work or a scientific discovery occurred to a person as a flash , it does not mean that there is no previous knowledge, thinking, or any other process involved or is there behind that flash.

  

You might want to study Gestalt theory of problem solving[here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ak9xH15qNVQC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=psychology+topic+thinking+cognition++flash&source=bl&ots=WrkPji2kDN&sig=3zwjF-B-TIssmeGJiGqvuKydhfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5_MCdvevVAhWHuo8KHT0zARkQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&q=psychology%20topic%20thinking%20cognition%20%20flash&f=false), Psychology's study of incubation[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_(psychology)), Psychology's study of insight[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight), discussion of Eureka Effect[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect)and so on.

  

In fact, when we say that the entire Ashtadhyayi could have occured to Panini as a flash, we are applying the theory on similar lines as the above cognitive science theories, coming from the aarthika bhaaga of the Paniniyan tradition, called 'sphOTa', articulated by Bhartrihari in Vakyapadiyam to the beginner of that tradition. SphOTa theory too proposes that the idea to be communicated through an entire piece of communication occurs to the communicator all at once, though the communicator consciously or unconsciously arranges the whole communication of that idea into a certain scheme and communicates. Even the scheme of communication occurs as a flash to the communicator. Then he/she goes on to put the scheme into a communicable form such as a scientific work, a kaavya, a piece of musical presentation, a painting, a sculpture and so on.

  

Nevertheless, this flash is a result of a previous attempt at problem solving only. But this attempt too need not be conscious, slow, stepwise, trial and error process as you might have seen in the above theories of cognitive science.

  

Bhartrihari calls the flash as sphOTa, the flashed communicable entity as vaakyaartha or pratibhaa, connects it to bhaavanaa, itikartavyataa (intuition) etc. But agrees that there is abhyaasa behind this. Classifies the aagama resulting from abhyaasa into aasatti and viprakarshaa. He provides an elaborate theory of this process involved in the flash .
