Sri Achut-ji,

  

I am afraid, you are admiring me for what I have not said.

  

I was trying to understand the words of respectable Prof. Korada. He said,अण् is lakshya andअइउण् is lakshaNa.

  

I an earlier post, I said, the sequence of sutras that leads to the siddhi of a Sanskrit word is a lakshaNa of all the lakshyas to the siddhi of which that sequence of sutras leads. This is well known to all those who know AA.

  

At that point, I said that Maaheshwara Sutras are just participants in such a node - sequence of sutras that forms a lakshaNa for the lakshyas in the actual usage(s) of Sanskrit.

  

Prof. Korada's explanation, I am sure, is not to contradict this well known understanding.

  

He says that Maaheshvara Sutras are lakshaNas of the lakshyas called aN, ak etc. Here , he is using the word lakshaNa in the sense of definition. That a technical term can be called a lakshya and its defintion its lakshaNa was/is not known to me. But I just take it because it came from a guru of the stature of Prof. Korada.
