In this[post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/017uK-B6zh8/u4Xp2HkoDWQJ)in the[thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/panini$20mozart%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/017uK-B6zh8/u4Xp2HkoDWQJ), I said,

  

"Prof. Peter Raster of Germany whose name I was quoting in a thread on universals in Panini, while speaking about the idea of composition of Ashtadhyayi as a 'miracle', brought the analogy of Mozart's composition of a huge number of symphonies (around 600 works altogether )within the small age that he lived. He said that Mozart when asked about how could he compose such big complex compositions in a short span of time, he used to say that he 'saw' the whole composition in his mind.Prof. Raster said that Panini must have 'seen' the whole of Ashtaadhyaayi in a flash. Ability to see that way is what is called as 'yogipratyaksha'"
