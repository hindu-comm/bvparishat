Dear Shri Karve,

  

  All you have to do is to look up the various Prātiśākhyas and Śikṣās. Many of them are available in pdf form on DLI or Archive.org etc. I have attached Professor George Cardona's monograph on the Śivasūtras, where he summarizes the classifications from the different Prātiśākhyas. A different account is provided by Kiparsky, though he does recognize the existence of Pre-Pāṇinian ordering of the Varṇasamāmnāya. No study claims that the Varṇasamāmnāya originates with Pāṇini.
