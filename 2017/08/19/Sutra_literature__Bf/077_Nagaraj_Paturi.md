Thanks Prof. Aklujkar, for these details.

  

How many more such treasures you have with you?

  

When and how will the Indian nation acknowledge the services to Indic Knowledge Traditions rendered by Gurus like you and Prof. Deshpande?

  

Members influential with the Government of India should do something about this.
