Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

Sorry, I overlooked to give the publication particulars. They are:

  

2008. "Traditions of language study in South Asia." In *Language in South Asia*, pp. 189-220 (= chapter 9). (eds) Kachru, Braj B.; Kachru, Yamuna; Sridhar, S. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 

  

The volume has a common bibliography for all the articles included in it. That is why the publication particulars of the studies I refer to did not appear at the end of the pdf I shared on the BVP forum.

  

I am glad you liked the article. Many thanks

  

a.a.
