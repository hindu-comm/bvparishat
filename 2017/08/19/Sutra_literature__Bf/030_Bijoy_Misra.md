Dear friends,

From personal experience, we can easily check that creative writing and creative analysis are not

similar in their origin. The creative impulse can be flash like, an inspiration to do something new and

novel. Creative writing is imagination, it can be a fancy, the author is the owner. On the other hand

creative analysis has the world as its base. It is more of distillation of existing facts with possible new

discoveries which could take years of deductive effort.. It is empirically understood that the creative

analytic work blossoms in the youth while the creative writing matures with age.

My thinking has been that a sutra is an effort of condensing larger texts into rules and norms.

In the sciences the process could be analogous to the laws, formulas and equations. The latter process

is algebraic in nature. So I wanted to check if there is any research on how the sutra style came to

be, particularly if it was connected to number theory and numerology through astronomy. The technique

can go deeper in organizing information, like classification and noticing dissimilarity. The discovery and

enunciation of alphabet by the "unidentified scholar" might have something to do with the origin of the

technique.

Best regards,

BM
