I agree and disagree with Sri Murthy-ji and Karve-ji.

  

We must tread cautiously while speaking about Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have a fair though passive feel of the field, and can hope to make some sensible comments.

  

While it is true, as Sri Murthy-ji says, that there can be a possibility that AI can evolve a grammar which could even surpass Panini - theoretically that is - that that is nowhere near reality must first be recognised. It is no ordinary task, first of all, to make even a sensible "linguistic survey" - some such as Panini must have accomplished while or before embarking upon a grammar of that scale or precision, whatever they may mean. There is not even a dim vision of AI succeeding or even attempting in a manner comparable to Panini, in evolving a grammar for even the English language, one at which virtually the thousands of engineers working in the field of AI are so familiar if not actual adepts at. *The Comprehensive Dictionary of the English Language* authored by Randolf Quirk *et al* has over 60 pages dedicated to the treatment of the just the definite article (the *the*), whereas all that Panini wrote - to describe as fully as possible a language as complex and sophisticated as Sanskrit - if printed run on, is of a bulk less than 60 pages. Panini has done the quintessential work, for he knows what language is - in theory and in practice, and what could be needed beyond his work is not much more than add a note here or a note there, but nothing substantial stands to be supplemented.

  

As to the ability of AI doing translations, it is simply not true that all grammar is done away with or just ignored. Fairly sophisticated semantic grammars such as Lexical Function Grammar (LFG), or its more sophisticated versions and advances, are abundantly made use of in Machine Translation. Mere statistical approaches can take one thus far but no further. I may not be very wrong if I say even LFG owes its genesis more to Fillmore than to Chomsky. Fillmore himself was not unacquainted with Panini.

  

It is quite another matter that most Western linguists conceal, latterly especially, what they owe to Panini, or to Indian linguistic analysis in general. It is typical of the West, after all, to "digest" Indian concepts, repackage them, and present it as their *own*. This characteristic hypocrisy of the West is centuries old, even though it is they who cry hoarse about IPR.

  

It looks like Karve-ji is given to speak more than he knows. Does he mean Kepler's Laws were "debased" by the automated learning algorithms? What is at all debasement according to him? What does he mean by debasing Panini? Did even Patanjali's "*shakyam pratyAkhyAtum*" debase Panini ? Does "*uktAnuktaduruktachinta*" of Katyayana debase Panini? Would alternative grammars that were proposed/produced in the post-Paninian period "debase" Panini? I am sure if someone turned out a new grammar that surpassed Panini's, he would perhaps be garlanded by Panini! *akke cen madhu vindeta kimartham parvatam vrajet*?

  

And what grammar did denaturalise a language ever? What on earth is this "denaturalisation of language"? It would have been better if Karve-ji spoke with clarity of what he meant by the special terms/concepts he is pressing forward.

  

Mathematics is, indeed, an artificial language. Science was strengthened, not hindered, by the profuse growth of mathematics. Science would be no quintessential science were it not for its mathematical expression. For all the beauty that Nature abounds in, it is written in the language of mathematics (to paraphrase Galileo), hence the most "natural" language! The metalanguage Panini has pitched upon is the metalanguage *par excellence*in that it is utterly useful for the description and handling of his object language viz. the natural language, the Sanskrit. And of course there are "scholars" who would *love* to declare that Panini murdered Sanskrit, much as there are *sincere* haters of the "hegemony" of mathematics or mathematicians bidding fair of late to trespassing into realms that were till now the *forte* of specialists in humanities and social sciences.

  

And finally, it is exactly those who attempt to write algorithms of Paninian procedures that truly and best understand the importance or role of Panini. After all, the complexity of language was a closed book to all in the West until attempts were made to accomplish "automatic translation", and even better, till the ALPAC Committee gave its fatal verdict to the numerous language projects, many of them multinational, that were being carried on across continents. It is only upon the*grand failures* that the best engineers in the West faced in handling language with their (un)becoming overconfidence, that true appreciation regarding the Indian endeavours towards the analysis and synthesis of language began to dawn upon them, gradually begetting the respect that were naturally due to these endeavours. It was given to master cynics such as Whitney to hold Panini to ridicule, or again, speak spitefully of the Navya Nyaya language (an *artificial* natural language again) as did Athalye and Bodas do in their Introduction to the BORI edition of *Tarkasangraha*.

  

And lastly, the basic presumption/pretension made, or at least the impression given, by some that Panini sought to write a primer for beginners to learn Sanskrit is not even laughworthy. Before censuring or even eulogising Panini, what the project was that Panini set about to handle needs first to be appreciated.
