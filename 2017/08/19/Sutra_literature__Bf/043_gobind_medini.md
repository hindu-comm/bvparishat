In my understanding, Sphota theory is about meaning of a language construct in general and sentential meaning in particular. It is as much applicable to any meaningful sentence or a group of sentences as to the pANinI's aShTAdhyAyI. The flashes of insight which are being talked about in the name of pANinI and aShTAdhyAyI are available to ordinary person as much as to pANinI.
