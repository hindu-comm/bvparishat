Abhyankarji,

Language and expression are cultural. In Sanskrit, the words reveal thoughts.

In English the word becomes a descriptive tool. The translators use dictionaries

to check some "equivalence" and they fail miserably. I have not looked how the

Sanskrit to English dictionaries came to be. Some local people here would believe

a dictionary word rather that a "native" creating an interpretation. I do not know if

scholars back home use dictionaries or struggle to interpret through multiple

readings and contemplating the context. A word is not "local" (Bhartrhari).

Best regards,

BM
