Dear Paturiji,

I admired you because you related it to natya Shastra' and Sangeet Shastra'. The correct recitation or the performance of the Maheshwar Sutras is in fact the lakshana and not just the written letters.

Taking the written letter for the phone is to my understanding वस्तुसा प्रयोग.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
