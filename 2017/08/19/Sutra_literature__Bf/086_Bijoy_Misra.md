Friends,

It is possible that we have exhausted the analysis of the topic as much we can.

We may close the thread and pursue individual efforts and share any new finding

gradually. People may pursue Panini and his contribution in another thread.

Once I thought he was the most scholarly of all people lived. Then I confronted

Valmiki and Bharata. Lately I am stuck with Charaka.

Thank you.
