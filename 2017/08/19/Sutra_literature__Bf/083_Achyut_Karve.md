Dear Scholars,

The attempt of looking at Paninian grammar as a a source for AI not only debases the effort of Panini but also denaturalizes language. In short such an effort is the product of looking at grammar as an object better called वस्तुसा प्रयोग.

The traditional practice of teaching Sanskrit is the only way to protect the Sanskrit language. The more artificial one makes it the sooner it will die and that surely was not the purpose of composing the AA. To put it into Paturiji's words, traditional teaching practices offer

"the confidence that everyone has a potential to become a Panini.  

Only through such an exercise and realising the challenges through personal experience that they can appreciate the greatness of Panini."  

and of the language.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve
