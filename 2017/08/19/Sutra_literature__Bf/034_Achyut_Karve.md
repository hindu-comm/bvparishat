Dear Scholars,  
  
Though analytical thinking in creative analytic is a long drawn process yet many a times the basis for the structure is a spark.

We see this happening in Panini in the Maheshwar Sutras. Using the sutra form for rendering a subject is one thing but to apply it to letters is mind boggling.

Previous attempts to sequence letters do not appear to be as robust as the Maheshwar Sutras. Taking cue from the Vakyapadiam it can be said that they simultaneously serve two purposes as light i.e. as the illuminor and the illumined. First as an instruction of letters as also a means to express letter groups.

Thus to totally rule out the presence of a spark or flash is not correct. Secondly it is fine that a writer has worked for a number of years for analysing a subject but without an amazing spark it would not have been possible to generate nearly 4000 sutra lines. That can only be the work of a genius. To put a subject matter into a defined form is no easy task.

Thus I feel that though what Madhav Deshpandeji has said is valid one cannot rule out that creative analytical writing needs a spark or a flash.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
