\>My thinking has been that a sutra is an effort of condensing larger texts into rules and norms.

  

'that a sutra is an effort of condensing larger texts into rules and norms'

  

if modified by changing

  

'larger texts' --------- to-----------> ideas contained in the texts either oral or written along with the ideas from the adhyayana-adhyaapana tradition of the texts selected for and orgainised into a specific s'aastra (such as meemaamsaa or vedaanta)

  

and

  

rules and norms -------- to --------> briefest possible and the most precise expressions,  

  

applies to meemaamaamsaa sutras and vedaanta sutras (brahma sutras)

  

since these two sutra books have their roots in the braamhaNa and aaraNyaka texts (upanishads counted as part ofbraamhaNa and aaraNyaka texts)and their adhyayana - adhyaapana traditions.
