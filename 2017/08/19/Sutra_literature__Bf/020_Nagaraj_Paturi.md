The[link](https://www.academia.edu/3747402/P%C4%81nini_and_Euclid_Reflections_on_Indian_Geometry)I provided earlier in the thread too is to an article by Johannes Bronkhorst only.

  

Both the articles by him trace the origin of the Sutra literature to Srauta Sutras and Kalpa. Interestingly, the ancient text Brahmandapurana too, in its 33rd Chapter does the same. It brings in the definition of Sutras as part of its 'narration' from Brahmanas, their rishis to kalpa and to sutras.

  

The point that is focused on in his article on Euclid and Panini is the commonality in the scientific expression universally.

  

Aiming at brevity (alpaaksharam), precision (asandigdham), sense-making (saaravat) and widest possible applicability (vis'vatomukham) is found in all scientific expression all over.

  

But what sutra books in Vedic/Sanskrit tradition distinctly have is the extreme brevity that is achieved through computer code like arrangement of common components of different sentences as strings to get connected to the uncommon /components of those sentences. These common components too make sutras and through a system of rule order and rule connecting, these sentence-pieces form into full sentences.
