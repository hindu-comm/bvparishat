Sutra can be part of only a sutra book. A (Sanskrit ) sentence can be part of any (Sanskrit ) verbal communication.

  

(Exceptions can be there to 'Sutra can be part of only a sutra book': An example of an expression that is given the name of sutra even though it is not a part of a sutra book is rasanishpattisutra, picked up from Bharata's Natya Shastra)

  

Sutra can be an incomplete portion of a sentence too. i.e., it need not have a samaapti. A sentence is a group of words with a samaapti.

  

Sutra is called a sutra only if it has the features such as alpaaksharam , asandigdham etc. A sentence can be called a sentence, even if it does not have such features.
