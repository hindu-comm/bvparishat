\>alpAksram may not be a unique characteristic though Panini tries hard in situations.He would also go for longer constructs if warranted.
Other sutra literature areseen to have long constructs.

  

"He would also go for longer constructs ***if warranted***."

  

Don't you see that your own sentences show that alpAksharam is the ideal for sUtrakAras, since they resort to longer constructs *only if warranted*?

  

I said in one of my previous posts in the thread,

\>Actually my inquiry has been to find the need and thecharacteristic of the construction.

  

Whatever is the need for brevity in scientific expression all over the world, is the need for brevity here too.

  

What is the need for Newton to say

  

Actioni contrariam semper & æqualem esse reactionem (What is usually translated into English as For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction) so briefly?
