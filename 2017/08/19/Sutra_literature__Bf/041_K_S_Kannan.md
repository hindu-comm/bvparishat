I more than fully agree with the analysis provided by Prof Paturi.

I remember how, way back in 1987, if I remember aright,

I had in a writing of mine compared Sphota theory with the Gestalt theory.

  

Those who have a naive view of science think that everything in science proceeds

on lines of a fixed routine of experiment, observation, and inference.

A true grasp of how at true moments of discovery, leaps happen in sudden flashes

is well detailed in Arthur Koestler's (1905-1983) *The Act of Creation* (1964),

and set forth and accounted for even better in Michael Polanyi's (1891-1976)

incisive and insightful writings, going well beyond Karl Popper's *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*(1934).

(An excellent summary of the penetrating analysis of Polanyi

can be found in Gelwick's *The Way of Discovery*(1977)).

  

Psychologists have also delved into the neural basis for the Aha! moments

of solving problems with insight.

  

I recall that my own grandfather is said to have remarked that

Panini's work is really grasped only by those

who can visualise the entire work as an *akhanda*-*mandala*.

  

The analogy of the subtractive process of the sculptor is also a powerful one.

The opposite of a bird's eye-view is what is called a worm's eye-view:

Panini would lose neither the wood for the trees nor the trees for the wood.

The analogy of Garuda provided by Jamadagni is commendable.
