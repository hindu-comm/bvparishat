Dear Misraji,

  

Here is an example. Take for instance the first stanza of the Vakyapadiyam. I am illiterate as far as Sanskrit is concerned and hence with the translation.

Is the level of visualization of the above the same as 'The cat caught the rat' or 'I see smoke and hence there is fire out there'. 

  

Therefore I have described the former visualization an **experiencial reality** and the later as

**thoughts based on reasoning**.   

  

In this thread itself there was a reference to Euclid. One cannot compare Euclid and Panini. While Euclid was looking at the reality of the figures of geometry through the eyes reason Panini was looking at language as experiencial reality. If one sees some uniformity of treatment of the subject throughout the discourse that is incidental to the subject and is necessarily not its core. Those who will try to impose Euclid's logic or reason on Panini's Ashtaadhyayi or the Maheshwar Sutras are bound to fail.

In short it is incorrect to view Sutra Texts (those of Panini included) through the eyes of reason alone as for them the reality is not the real world we see but the world presented in Vedas because for them the world of the Vedas is the real one.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
