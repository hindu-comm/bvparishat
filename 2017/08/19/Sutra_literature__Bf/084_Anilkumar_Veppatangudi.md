Sutra or aphorisms came into existence,as I understand with my little knowledge, to make it easier to transmit knowledge orally. In fact, Sutras made it difficult to understand the essence of the matter without commentaries or understanding the context. What will a scholar make out of a Sutra हलन्त्यम् without a commentary or learning from an expert? Are we missing the wood for the trees?
