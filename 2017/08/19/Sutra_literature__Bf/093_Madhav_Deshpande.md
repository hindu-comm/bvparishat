Dear Shri Karve,

  

  While I admire your enthusiasm for the Śivasūtras, they are not the origin of the standard Varṇasamāmnāya with the order of consonants like k, kh, g, gh, ṅ etc., but it is a particular reordering of the traditional Varṇasamāmnāya to fit the need of Pāṇini's grammar to produce specific short forms for various groups of sounds. There is also no inclusion of long vowels etc. in the Śivasūtras. The short "a" can stand for the entire class of "a" varieties, differing in accents, length and nasality, while long "ā" (not listed in the Śivasūtra) cannot. So there is a different system specific logic in exclusion and inclusion of different sounds in the Śivasūtra listings. On the other hand, the Varṇasamāmnāya, as given in the Śikṣās and the Prātiśākhyas has the purpose that is to provide a pure phonetic listing of sounds, organized by their phonetic features. Therefore, the long vowels get included in the Varṇasamāmnāya, but they are excluded from the Śivasūtras.
