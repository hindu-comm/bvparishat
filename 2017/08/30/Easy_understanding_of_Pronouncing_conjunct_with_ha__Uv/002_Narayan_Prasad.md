\<\<As I read in the other threads, ब्रह्म has to be pronunced as barmha.>\>

  

I am of the opinion that such wrong pronunciation is due to the effect of the speakers' mother-tongue. If ब्रह्मis to be pronounced barmha, it should be written as such, i.e.ब्रम्ह, but in Sanskrit it is never written like this.

  

Similar is the case withष being pronounced as ख, त् as ल्, व as ब etc. The wrong pronunciations ofक्ष, ज्ञ are well known.
