Pranamah!

We read or write the Devanagari script from left to right and up to down. This is, you can say, the rule for Devanagari Script. ब्रह्म will be read as it is written i.e. BRAHMA. We first write B then add R the same way first we write H then M, so we will pronounce them as we have written.
