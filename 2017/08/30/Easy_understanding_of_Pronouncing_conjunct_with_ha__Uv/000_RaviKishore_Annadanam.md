Namaste All,

  

I have seen some of the earlier posts in this group about "pronunciation ब्रह्म, अह्न,चिह्न etc.". However as I am at the very beginning of learning, I am getting confused with the pronunciation of conjuncts with ह.

  

Is there any rule I can easily follow based on which letter ह is in conjunct with?

  

As I read in the other threads, ब्रह्म has to be pronunced as barmha.

Will this is be same with ह conjunct with र as well? Example from Sri Lalitha Sahasranama: ह्रींकारी , ह्रीमती, हृद्य.

Also, how to pronunce जिह्वा, गुह्य, etc?

  

Please help me.

  

Dhanyavad,

Ravi Kishore Annadanam
