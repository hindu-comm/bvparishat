    yam eva vidyAH /Sucim apramattaM

    Namaste,

    I am looking for Shruti pramana for this verse. Earliest reference is in Nirukta (ii.9) where Yaskacharya

    lists this as teh 4th and last verse of Vidhya (Devi)'s instructions to an acharya about the 

    qualifications of veda acharya and vidyarthi.  The first three verses of this quartet occur in

    Samhitopanishad  (upa-brahmana) brahmana of Samaveda (2nd adhyaya).  The quartet occurs in minor upanishads,

    Vasishta Dharma shastra and Sayana's bhumika to RV bhashya. But I could not find the original 

    shruthi pramana for the above quoted fourth verse. If the scholars could point me to the source or 

    point out whether this is an extrapolation in nirukta, I would be thankful.

    sincerely,

    ..gopal Gopinath
