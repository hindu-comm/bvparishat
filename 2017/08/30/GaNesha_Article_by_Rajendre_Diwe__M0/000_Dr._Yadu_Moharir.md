Dear List

  

Recently there has been discussion on GaNeha in Veda.

  

Attached please find an article by Rajendra Diwe from New Paper Hitavada dated August 27 2017.

  

He had attended my talk in December 2015.

  

May be I was able to touch and resonate his cords of thinking.

  

My focus is on the UTILITY and not just Who said WHAT & WHERE ? One needs to look and reflect on WHY someone may have said so in a specific manner !!?  

  

I firmly believe that all knowledge is for the living and it has no value to me, after I am dead, thus we need to use the knowledge when we are still alive.  

  

Best Rgds

  

Dr Yadu
