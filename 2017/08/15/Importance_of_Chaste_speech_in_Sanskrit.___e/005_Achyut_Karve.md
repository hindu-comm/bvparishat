Dear Bijoyji,

We speak unchaste languages. As a result at least as I experience it the picture of the word we hear follows the utterance of the word I.e there is a lag in visualising the meaning. At the same time we do not visualise a word before we utter it as we do when we are writing. Let us take the example of the word chair. The visualization of the chair follows after we have heard the word chair not as we hear the word chair.(I think you have in your article sent to me put the delay at 200 milliseconds) At the same time while uttering the word chair the visualization of the chair and the effort to say the word are not simultaneously. The same is true of other languages. However when we utter the Sanskrit word गौ: we find that we can simultaneously visualise the cow while uttering the word गौ:. At the same time there is no delay in visualising the word on hearing it.

It is from this point of view that I am suggesting that the sequence para-pashyanti-madhyama-vaikhari does not hold good for non chaste languages as well as for non chaste speech. I feel that it is in this context that Patanjali says that people utter words to express meaning.
Meaning, there is no one to one correspondence between what is intended to be conveyed and what is actually conveyed through speech. Hence the numerous misspells while we speak languages other than Sanskrit..

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
