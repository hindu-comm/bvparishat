Dear Scholars,

  

Why is so much importance is given in Sanskrit to chaste speech in recitation as well as in speech?

  

In my opinion the reason thereof is that unchaste speech has the effect of inverting the process of speech production. The four parts of speech in Sanskrit are stated to be para-pashyanti-madhyma-vaikhari. That is speech starts from conceptualization followed by seeing the concept to be communicated followed by the effort to phonate and finally leading to the sound produced which is the vaikhari. Thus while speaking a chaste sanskrit tongue what has to be conveyed is first visualized and then rendered through speech after going through the intervening stages.
However in the case of unchaste phonation or in the case of Non-sanskrit languages this process of speech production is inverted.
That is one cannot visualize without phonating the word also it is on account of unchaste speech that the first three parts of speech namely para-pashyanti-madhyama are hidden from those who speak an unchaste tongue.

  

I request members to comment.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
