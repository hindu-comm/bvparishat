Achyutji,

I recommend that you study भर्तृहरि to gain a framework

on these. Try to handle it in original Sanskrit. Do give

time. Many scholars here have also worked on those.

He talks speech science empirically. We need to experiment

on the concepts.

  

The biological limitation in processing is independent of the

language. 

  

Best regards,

BM
