Dear Achyutji,

"Chasteness" is a function of our efforts in creating and uttering the syllable.

What we have to examine is the definition of a "word" and if the "syllable"

can be considered a word. Once we declare that the fundamental unit

of speech is a syllable, our all efforts goes into producing the syllable

than creating a compound. Since we live in a word-oriented society, we

do not fully analyze where a word gets its meaning. Please do research

on the topic. 

Best regards,

Happy Independence Day.
