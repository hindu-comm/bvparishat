Thank you Dr. Joshi for kind words.

  

Dr. Bijoy Misra,

  

I tried my best in the thread “A Hindu-geo-centric world-view” in presenting the relevant ideas, therefore though it is difficult let me try some more (by going farther back).

As you might remember, in one of my early threads “The specifics of Sanskrit VarNamAlA” we discussed (in your presence) the Devata-foundation of Sanskrit sounds. Here is an excerpt from that thread:

  

> “The first element (00) of a matrix (क / अ / ह), as well as the final > (44) element (ञ / इ / य), is of special interest because it is the > farthest location of this universe. >
> 00 is seen as the entry point, and 44 as the exit point. Let us > consider 00, first. >
> 00 can be seen either as a द्वार or as a बाधा. Without crossing this > point there cannot be any hope of... >
> ...each of the entries in L, R, or C matrix belongs to certain देवता. > So who is the देवता behind 00? >
> क - कार्तिक >
> अ - अश्विन् >
> ह - हनुमान >
> All three of them are also known as कुमार ("child").”

  

So the framework for Hindu-world-view, as these essays try to show, is no different from the brickwork on which Sanskrit sounds are built. The Hindu-worldview essay in this sense is only a strengthening argument for the main argument laid out in the Sanskrit-varnamala conversation thread.

In all this we are not talking about big ideas, texts or big deities; this is about the “smallest” of all deities. Moreover, a Devata in the Veda **is not a given**; the Devata **had to be discovered** and understood. This has implication.

  

Some of it is brought out in the Hindu-worldview thread, where the “left” and “right” orientations (as defined) of residents, and the presence of the most prominent Kumara temple (at Palani) at the predicted location, and other things – none of that is my invention, all that was/ has been already there for all to see/ observe.

If my answer is not satisfactory or something is amiss, please let it be known.
