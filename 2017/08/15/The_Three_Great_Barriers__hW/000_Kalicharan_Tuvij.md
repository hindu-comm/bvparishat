नमस्ते,

This thread (in a way) follows another thread “A Hindu-geocentric World-view” where a Triangle-representation (consisting of Southern, Eastern and North-western vertices) of BhArata-varSha was elaborated.

The three vertices were seen as the orthonormal basis of core competencies of India. Here with your permission I want to share my thoughts on – what I perceive as – the last generation of giants, that came in particular from these three regions, and the kind of influence they continued to exert on the succeeding generations.

These three giants were – to my mind – indeed the very last of their kind, yet, the greats before them must have been necessarily even bigger in stature. “Giants of giants”, so to say.

To cut to the chase, my point is: to be able to see our tallest giants we need to surmount the obstruction presented by the giants that are nearest to us.

These giants, the shadow of whom we live under, are :-

1) Panini (Western Vertex)

Greatest grammarian in recorded history.

Yet, Sanskrit is far more organic and far deeper than a genius Sabda-SAstra.

2) Buddha (Eastern Vertex)

Greatest democratizer of enlightenment in documented history.

Yet, humankind needed strong nations to create prosperity – that includes even the preconditions for enlightenment (whatever does that mean).

3) SankarAcharya (Southern Vertex)

The greatest Synthesizer in the known history. Different nuances of Vedanta became “different nuances of Advaita”.

Yet, even as everything looked perfectly well on paper, “the theory and its nuances became a chakra-vyuha”.

  

  

Till the time we continue to live under their shadow, unable to see beyond, we continue to live in bondage.

  

Happy Independence Day,

KT
