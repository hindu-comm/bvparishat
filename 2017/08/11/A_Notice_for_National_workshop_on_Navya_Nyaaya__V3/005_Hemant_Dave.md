You may find the following information useful.

  

In her article ‘Indian thought and Western science in the nineteenth century’, Mary Boole, wife of George Boole, the celebrated founder of Boolean algebra, wrote that nineteenth century European science ‘could never have reached its present height had it not been fertilized by successive wafts from the \[...\] knowledge stored up in the East’ (1901: 947, *ap*. Ganeri 2001: 7) She also informs us that apart from Boole himself, the inventor and designer of computing machines Babbage (who was a friend of Cole­brook) and De Morgan were greatly influenced by Indian intellectual traditions (ibid. p. 958, *ap*. Ganeri 2001: 7).
