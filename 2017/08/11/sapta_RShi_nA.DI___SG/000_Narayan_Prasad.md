Dear Members,

  namaste !

  

  BTW, has the series of publication on the sapta riSi nADii (ஸப்த ரிஷி நாடி) been completed ? The first volume appeared in 1951 and the sixth in 1961. The B.O.R.I. library has only the first six volumes (Aries lagna to Virgo lagna).

  

  Any English translation of the Tamil text of this work ?

  

  Any soft copy available anywhere to download ?

  

  Thanks and regards

  Narayan prasad
