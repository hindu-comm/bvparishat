Dear Scholars,

You took interest to discuss the meaning of a word with me last time. Please help me with a new word.

In translating the Naradashilpa on 'Pillars' I am stuck with one form or design or decoration: it is called

पौरीकाषम् . What could this mean? The text reads: मध्यचत्वरकं क्वचित् पौष्पिकं क्वचित् पात्रिकं क्वचित्पौरीकाषम् \|\| The context is: the central square part of the column/pillar exhibits (or is made in) flower or leaf designs and some times with पौरीकाषम् design. पौरी independently could mean something related to 'city, town.'..MW cites this as the language spoken among the palace workers. कष is attested as a rubbing stone. काष is supposed to mean 'any object against which cheeks (of elephants) are rubbed'.I could not locate this word पौरीकाषम् in other Vaastu texts.I would be thankful if at least a plausible meaning could be divined, since the ParamparA of this word appears lost.

best regards

RN Iyengar
