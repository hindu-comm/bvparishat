**Abstract**  
Although the sacred stories of Hindu deity Balarama are categorized as mythology in the Philology and Religious Studies, these stories have much broader relevance for the history of India and deep impact for the life and culture of modern India. This paper is divided into two parts: The first part examines the sacred stories of Balarama and historical understanding of the deity, while the second part examines the impact of these stories on life and culture especially the ecological awareness of modern India. Unfortunately, classical literature is relegated to the background in modern India. However, the present paper demonstrates that they preserve unique traditional systems of culture that could leave humanity with long lasting benefits well into the future.
