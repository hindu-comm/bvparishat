Dear list members

  

Apart from[Burton’s English translation](http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/ar/index.htm), which other translations/publications of *Anaṅgaraṅga* are available online?

  

I know of the following

1\) A manuscript of an unpublished commentary under <https://archive.org/stream/AnangarangaCommentaryCambridgeManuscript>

2\) A translation by Tridibnath Ray (book is on loan and needs login for access): <http://www.archive.org/stream/anangaranga00kalyrich>

  

How about print publications? Any translations or commentaries?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
