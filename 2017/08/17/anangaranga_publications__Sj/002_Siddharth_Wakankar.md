Namaskar.

  

I am editing the Anangaranga with an unpublished Sanskrit Commentary written by Ganesha Nilakantha Vathodkar Shastri. The proofs are with me and hope to complete the same in near future.

  

There is one book in Marathi by Gajanan Raghunath Mulye from Karjat,published way back in early 1900,which was challenged in the Bombay High Court as an Ashleela Book,but,it was turned down by Justice Brown.

  

I think,the Nirnayasagar Press also published the Text. You may also get other books kin Hindi/Gujarati etc.
