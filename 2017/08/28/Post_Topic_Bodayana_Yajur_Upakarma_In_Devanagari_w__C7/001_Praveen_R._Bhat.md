A small book Yajurveda Sandhyavandanam sold by Giri trading targetting new intiate brahmachari vaTus has both Apasthambha and Bodhayana nityakarma procedures with mantra in Devanagariand svara including upakarma, as far as I remember. I'd have confirmed the same, except that I have packed all my books to shift from here and I can't find it in the open boxes. If you have access to Giri trading, I suggest you buy it.

  

Kind rgds,
