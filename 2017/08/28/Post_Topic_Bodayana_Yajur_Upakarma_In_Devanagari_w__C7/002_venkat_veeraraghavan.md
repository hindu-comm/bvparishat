Namaste Shri Praveenji:

  

Thank you so much for replying back to my post.  

Is this the "Yajurveda trikala sandhyavandhanam" byParthasarathy I just got off the phone with Giri Traders Nanganallur and the gentleman there told me that there is no Kanda Rshi Tarpanam in that book.

Is this the Sanskrit and English version? It seems to have Sandhyavandana, samithadhanam and Brahm Yajnam though.

  

Thanks also to Dr.Korada Subrahmanyam Garu for his guidance regarding Brahma Yajna. He was kind enough to enlighten me that many mantras were added by successive generations.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
