The upAkarma procedure for the bodhAyana, at least as per that book, is quite different from the aapastamba procedure. The order of upAkarma homa in the aapatamba is prajaapatim, somam, agnim, vishvaan-devaan, saa.mhitiibhyo devataabhya upaniShadbhya.h, yaaj\~nikiibhyo devataabhya upaniShadbhya.h, vaaruuNiibhyo devataabhya upaniShadbhya.h, brahmaNe svayambhuve and finally using the Rk sadaspatimadbhutam for sadasaspati. The Bodhayana procedure is more complicated, uses a different order, and it seems the upaviitam is also nivItI etc for certain homas. This is done only when doing tarpaNam, not for the upAkarma homam in aapastamba. Furthermore, the changing of the thread happens during the homam here, whereas for aapastambins, it's a separate procedure before the homa. There are many interesting differences here.

  

Thanks for the link Shri Ramachandra.
