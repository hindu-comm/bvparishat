Dear All,

  

I am looking for Bodayana Yajur Upakarma source in Devanagari with Svaras notation included if possible.

  

fyi: Yajur upakarma is uniform across Apastambha (90%), Ashvalayana and Bodayana with certain rituals like Samithadhana, Brahma Yajna and Kanda Rshi tarpana varying significantly. I have tried through all personal sources with ho luck.

  

I am hoping some one can help me in this group.

  

Appreciate any help or pointers I can get in this regard,

  

Many thanks,

  

Venkat
