I do have a question on "shaakhaahar". A vegan friend pointed out that the word in itself refers to food products from the shaakha, ie the branch. One can extend it to other plant based products. However it does not in itself imply something taken from any animal.  
  
Could someone please share what is the historical basis and etymology of the term shaakhahar? What is your opinion on the inference?  
  
Thank you,  
Hemang
