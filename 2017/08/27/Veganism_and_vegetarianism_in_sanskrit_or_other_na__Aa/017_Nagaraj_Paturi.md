\>But indeed if it is in reference to "plant product items of a food-menu", when did milk and dairy products come in this category?  

  

---- I just said that is शाक isplant product items of a food-menu. I did not say food-culture called शाकाहार, with only uncookedplant product items in the food menu once existed.

  

Milk and dairy products seem to be always a part of a food culture to which we today give the name 'vegetarian' food culture.
