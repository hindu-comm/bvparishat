Dear Sri Hemang-ji,

  

It is शाकाहार not शाखाहार.

  

शाखाहार is a humorous spelling mistake typical of many such sign board spelling errors.

  

Then to create an etymology (शाखा + आहार) out of the faulty spelling is the further degree of the humour.

  

शाकाहार (शाक + आहार ) is the right word.

  

Older use of the term शाक seems to be in contrast to the term पाक . शाकपाक is used as an idiomatic /conventionalised pair of words. शाक seems to be in reference to the uncooked plant product items of a food-menu. पाक seems to be in reference to cooked items of a food-menu.

  

शाकाहार seems to be अर्वाचीन प्रयोग .
