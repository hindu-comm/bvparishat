Paturi ji  
  
Indeed, it is a funny mistake we see at multiple places. Now that devnagri has started vanishing from sign boards, it gets even more confusing as to which version is correct.  
  
But indeed if it is in reference to "plant product items of a food-menu", when did milk and dairy products come in this category?  
  
Thank you,  
Hemang
