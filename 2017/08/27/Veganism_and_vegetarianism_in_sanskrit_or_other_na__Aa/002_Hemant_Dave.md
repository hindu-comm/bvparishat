Hi!

Jaina and Buddhist texts refer to ahimsa, and (by extension) to vegetarianism (for ahimsa and vegetarianism, see, M. A. Mehendale, in his collected works, *Madhuvidya* published by the L. D. Institute of Indology, Amdavad). References may be followed from Alsdorf's *Beitraege zur Geschichte von Vegetarismus und Rinderverehrung* now also available in English translation. Also see, D. N. Jha's work on cow.

Best,

H.
