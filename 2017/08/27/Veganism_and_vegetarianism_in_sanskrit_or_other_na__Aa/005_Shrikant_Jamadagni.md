namaste

  

Please read the verses 1 - 56 of Chapter 5 of Manu Smriti.  

Even though meat eating (that is done as per prescribed rules) is allowed by Manu he categorically puts his weight behind vegetarianism. He extols the merits earned by NOT eating meat. In the end he remarks that though consuming meat, alcohol and sexual intercourse are not sinful, abstinence of these three bring great rewards.
