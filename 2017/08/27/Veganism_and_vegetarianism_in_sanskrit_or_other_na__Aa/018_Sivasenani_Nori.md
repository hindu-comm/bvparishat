There is a discussion in Nirukta about the relationship between names and meanings. Let us take a carpenter. He is called a Takshaa because he shapes wood. Similarly a mendicant is called a Parivraajaka because he wanders without staying at one place. Now, it is quite possible for the carpenter to also wander sometimes and for the Parivraajaka to shape wood sometimes, say for his Danda, but we continue to call the wandering carpenter a Takshaa and a mendicant working a piece of wood as a Parivraajaka. So one principle of names is that, naming is based on mukhya-karma, the main characteristic. That is the way of the world, lokavyavahaara (which is taken as a given bySastras)

  

So milk and honey might not be from Saakas (vegetables) and mutton might be ultimately from vegetables (since goats eat grass and vegetables to grow its flesh), but the former is Saakaahaara and the latter maaMsaahaara. This is lokavyavahaara.
