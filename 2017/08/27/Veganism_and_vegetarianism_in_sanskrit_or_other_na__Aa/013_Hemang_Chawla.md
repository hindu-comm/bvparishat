Namaste to all,  
  
Thank you all for the various references, especially Patauri ji. I will go through them.  
  
Patauri ji, the aim is to build a grand Indian narrative of Indian vegetarianism and now veganism. The idea of learning from history or doing literature survey must never be equated to "going backward" in terms of regressiveness. In any case the forward-backward dichotomy has hegelian basis of linear history, with no logical equivalence to good or bad in any context. Same with new or primitive. Things must be evaluated for their own merit.  
  
The arguments for no dairy in veganism are two fold in terms of 1) cruelty and 2) consent. The aspect of cruelty seems to be of concern in the olden days. As for consent, the torch of Indian vegan revolution must be held by us and not handed out to the ettic. We must reform from within than utilizing outside resources (alone). This is the motive behind this thread.  
  
I do not have a query specifically on whether Indians ate beef or not. As with any other decentralized culture, there would have been communities that did and those that did not. Either way, the underlying theme of ahiumsa in different forms is prevalent in the text and civilizational ethos. I would go through the links and the references shared.
