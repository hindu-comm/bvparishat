Dear Sri Hemang Chawla-ji,

  

Your signature has the tagline 'Transitioning Vegan'.

  

Based on that it can be inferred that you are looking for sources in the premodern Indian literature for Veganism and Vegetarianism.

  

'Veganism' in the sense of not eating even milk, milk products, butter, ghee etc. , as you can easily imagine, is not so well known in the ancient Indian literature.

  

Vegetarianism is THE philosophy of food in Buddhist and Jain literature.

  

On the Vedic side, as described in the Vedic literature, food culture was diverse and was different for different varṇas and āśramas.

  

Vegetarianism is found within this diversity alongside non-vegetarianism in that literature.

  

From the time of revival and propagation of Vedanta by Sankara and the revival and propagation of Bhakti schools of Vedanta, vegetarianism turned out to be the food culture of all the followers of these schools. Even those portions of Vedic literature which appeared to be indicating say, animal sacrifice in yajñas, were interpreted by these schools to have been 'misunderstood' earlier as nonvegetarian.

So if you are looking for vegetarian understanding of the 'apparently' nonvegetarian (portions of ) texts, you will be able to get them from the post-Sankara Vedanta and Bhakti Vedanta literature. Some historians see this development within 'Vedic' ('Hindu') culture as an influence of Buddhist and Jain traditions on Vedic culture.

  

I don't think the issue of beef-eating is part of your thread - initiating enquiry.

  

Beef-eating , if found, whether in an 'apparent' / 'misunderstood' form or otherwise in the 'Vedic' ('Hindu') side of the literature has the same response from the post- S'ankara Vedanta and Bhakti Vedanta literature. In other words, the texts with vegetarian argument that you come across from post-Sankara Vedanta and Bhakti Vedanta literature cover the issue of how mention of beef-eating in the ancient texts is argued / interpreted by them.

  

Mythological narratives of Vedic 'Hinduism' and the food habits described in them need not be a guide for our current food-choice , since we do not in any case follow their costume, the weapons they held or used, their housing style or their housing technology etc.

  

Mythological way of looking at the past has its present day alternative, historical way of looking at the past. The same historical critical method which tries to show beef-eating by the ancient Indians tells us that the primitive ancestors of Indians, for that matter, primitive ancestors of all humans walked /ran nude, ate raw, uncooked food. That can be no justification for our walking or running nude or eating raw flesh today.

  

Vegetarianisation of Hinduism or sections of it , even if it is the influence of Buddhism or Jainism or any other thing, is similar to developments such as changing from primitive food, clothing and shelter styles into later styles. 

  

Ancient texts on the issue can be viewed from this perspective.
