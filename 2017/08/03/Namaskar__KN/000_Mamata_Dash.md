With regards to all the Vidvaanas in the group, I request you all to pass me a reference on the text Śabdaliṅgārthacandrikā by Sujana Bhaṭṭa. While preparing a compendium of Sanskrit Lexicon, we have cpme across several texts, which have not yet seen the light of the day. The number of the Lexicographical texts has touched 630. We are still collecting the ref. going through several texts, Commentaries, different articles on the lexicon etc.  

Now we have planned to edit a text named Śabdaliṅgārthacandrikā by Sujana Bhaṭṭa.There are 5 mss. available in Chennai. Interstingly it has  

a Com - Dṛṣṭāntasiddhāñjana by Vidvat Kallola Bhaṭṭācārya and has a  

Super Cc. Śarat by Cakora Bhaṭṭācārya.  

  

We are planning to edit the lexicon with the commentaries. I just want to know, whether any scholar has worked on it ?

I will be obliged if some scholar will respond to it.  

with regards to all the vidvaans,  

Mamata Mishra
