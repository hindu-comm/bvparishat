Dear Mamataji,

  

  It is wonderful that you are collecting Sanskrit lexicographical works so comprehensively. The WorldCat does not show any listing for a publication titledŚabdaliṅgārthacandrikā. So, there is probably no earlier published edition, and your edition will be a great new contribution.
