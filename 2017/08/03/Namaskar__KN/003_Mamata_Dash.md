Thank you very much Madhav Deshpande Sir.  

We are now preparing a list of lexicons. During the collection, if we come across some unpublished lexicon trying to edit it. In this row, we have published द्विरूपकोशसङ्ग्रह (two) . And one अव्ययार्णव and another namedनानार्थपदपेटिका by Sujan, who is also the author of शब्दलिङ्गार्थचन्द्रिका are ready to be published. The नानार्थपदपेटिका is a kosa which deals with the words based on the ending consonants, hence can be called as अक्षरान्तकोश . Our next venture is to work on शब्दलिङ्गार्थचन्द्रिका . As this has a commentary and the commentary refers to many texts more than one hundred, it attracts us.  

We need the blessing and cooperation of the scholars to complete the task.  

with regards  

Mamata Mishra
