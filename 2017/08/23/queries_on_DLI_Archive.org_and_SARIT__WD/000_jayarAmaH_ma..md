Namaste  
  

**query 1**  
  

It seems [archive.org](http://archive.org) website is down, from where very valuable scanned ancient indic texts were accessible.  
I also attempted to to access DLI. There, i found a notification that they have taken down the website due some copyright violations.  

  

Is it the same case with [archive.org](http://archive.org) website? I did not find any notification there.  
  

**query 2**  

In this indological source - Search and Retrival of Indic texts (SARIT) -  
  
<http://sarit.indology.info/exist/apps/sarit/works/>  

  

I found some lapses in the content, in terms of missing text. I searched the website for an email id to report the issue. But did not find one. Can anyone help ?  
  

regards  

Jayaraman
