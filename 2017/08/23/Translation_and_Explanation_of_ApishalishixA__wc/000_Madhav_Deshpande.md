Dear Colleagues,

  

  I have attached a rare publication by the Late Professor Barend Van Nooten which contains the text, translation and explanation of the Āpiśali Śikṣā. Āpiśali Śikṣā is one of those rare texts belonging to a predecessor of Pāṇini. The prose Pāṇini Śikṣā published by Yudhishthir Mimamsak is almost a verbatum copy of the Āpiśali Śikṣā, with some changes. Van Nooten's publication may be useful to Shri Karve and others interested in ancient Sanskrit phonetics. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
