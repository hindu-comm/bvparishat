Dear Shri Abhyankar,

  

  I have attached two more pdfs. One contains the text of the Āpiśali Śikṣā along with the prose Pāṇini Śikṣā and Cāndra-Śikṣāsūtras.
This is a booklet edited by Yudhishthir Mimamsak. The other edition is by Peter Freund. There is a Ph.D. dissertation from the University of Pennsylvania by V.S. Rajam that compares the Tamil grammar Tolkappiyam with Prātiśākhyas, Pāṇini and the Āpiśali Śikṣā. Āpiśali was clearly a predecessor of Pāṇini as Pāṇini refers to him in his sūtra: vā supi āpiśaleḥ. I am not aware of any other surviving works of Āpiśali, but from the reference by Pāṇini, it appears that he also composed a grammar of Sanskrit.
