You have asked a very good question, Dr. Kumar. I hope the forum will attract more such questions (instead of questions like ‘What should I do my Ph.D./M.A. dissertation on?’ or ‘Can you give me a bibliography on topic X?’, without specifying what effort one has already made to put together a bibliography on X).  
  
Kālidāsa might not have come across the name of Raghu’s wife anywhere in his sources. Or he might not have come across the name of a ‘special’ wife like Sudakṣiṇā in Dilīpa’s case and Indumatī in Aja’s case. Noteworthy for this latter possibility may be the fact that, in Raghuvaṁśa 3.33 (athāsya go-dāna-vidher …), Kālidāsa specifically informs his readers that Raghu had more than one wife and in Raghuvaṁśa 5.36 (brāhme muhūrte …) Kālidāsa characterizes Raghu’s son’s mother as devī ‘official/principal wife’.  
  
What we should note, fundamentally, in this context is that Kālidāsa’s goal is to compose an original aesthetic work. His objective is not to give a complete or consistently constructed account of a royal line but to offer a poetic account that will be socially enlightening in a previously untried way — will put forth a vision of what happened to a great and culturally important family over a long stretch of time. He is free to retain and/or emphasize only those parts from his sources which he needs for his grand design and discard the rest. If the detail about Raghu’s wife is not needed for his running thread in the Raghuvaṁsa, he can set it aside, just as he can set aside what the Ādi-kavi has already achieved.
