Dear Scholars  

Kalidasa has left the name of wife of Raghu between Dileepa and Aja in his Raghuvansha. What may be the reason? Is the name of wife of Raghu found anywhere? Why did Kalidasa chose silence over mentioning the name of wife of his hero,Raghu on whose name he named his epic and attributed the name of family....रघूणामन्वयं वक्ष्ये .....etc.
