Namaste Prabhat Kumar Singh

  

1. Appreciation for your love to work with Sanskrit in the domain of AI/ Machine Translation and pitching the issue to ' Open source of scholars at Bhartiya Vidwat Parishat'.

  

2. What you have articulated, below highlighted as the goal is asking the foundational question which Vedanga Samskrut Vyakarana has deliberated deeply and built an entire ' set of disciplines and philosophies' for the purpose of ' Self- Realization'. These were not intended for market commercialization to be force fitted in to the ' Computational Linguistics Model and Machine Translation, where the base template is derived from 'English likeness'.

  

Many questions that Dr. Narayan Joshi has raised on this forum have a bearing on this issue, in a distant yet seriously related way.

  

  

\<The **contributors need to translate** such files into sanskrit. There are 8000 such description files. The outcome will create first every sanskrit model to explain flowers (features) into sanskrit or vice-versa. \>

  

  

3. There are two components in your question;one - a translation issue and second visual to word decoding.

  

 Providing information on Both have serious commercial dimensions and damages to the cause of "Developing Samskruth as Programming language'' - for which this forum - by contributors and the philosophy of the forum may not be the most appropriate platform to respond in detail.

  

 Even if all the 8000 files are given as a translation, what will it achieve ? A visual -Name Tagging by script entry ( and help like Emoticons ?? )

  

 Note: What is Emoticon ? Why ? What is the difference between Emoji and Kamoji ? - See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon>

  

  

4. What you are asking is not in the realm of ' Word -Meaning - Explanation and extraction' for which dictionaries and grammar rules are used. What you are looking for, appears to be a visual illustration of given word and Word for a given visual (flower in this case).

  

  

5. If you can give more backgroundof your project and goals, sponsors and guide /evaluators of this project ( - of course on off-the forum correspondence) I may be able to provide some clues on this work. The information gathered from public forum inputs may not be able to meet all your needs.

  

( Note: I have seen the information at the link <https://github.com/jollysean/labelsE2S>).
