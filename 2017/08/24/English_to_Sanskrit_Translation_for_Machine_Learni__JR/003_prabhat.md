Namaste Shriman,

  

I am very glad for your email and questions within. It allows me to explore new dimensions of this venture.

I took time to build the first DNN(deep neural network) on said concept so that explaining it becomes easier.

Here is the repository for all current and future works.<https://github.com/aaryavrate/concept1>

I am very determined that it is going to provide greater good for humanity(in terms of IT tools), establish the glory of Sanskrit, and many more.

Answer to 2# There is no force-fit with english. I have been working for more than 10 years in building sanskrit based intelligent models using ANN(artificial neural networks) using the ingenuity of Sanskrit as universal CFG(context free grammar). Otherwise the development would have been easier but results not so superior. I am pursuing superior results. Finally, commerce is transient bridge to cross chasm and tough valleys. Universal welfare is end goal.

  

Answer to 3# The DNN application creates an image as per the sentence provided. Imagine a system which draws picture of LordShiva as you recite the mantras glorifying Lord Shiva. Isn't this going to revolutionize learning, communication and so many aspirational goals of this community as well as many other communities? I belive applications are far more wider. What I mentioned is just the tip at top.

  

Answer to 4# Yes, it is not just dictionary lookup work. But it is not so tough as well. It is merely explaining a scene as per your knowledge. For proof of concept of first version, if 10% of member contribute 1 hour of translation, we will achieve a historic feat. Please contribute.

  

Answer to 5# Project is aimed at creating a sanskrit based system to aid in further development of new age digital technologies in many fields of industry and academia, as also explained above. I am self sponsoring all the work for my hobby/passion. As a brief intro, I am management consultant at a bank in Singapore(Linkedin profile is here<https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryaanarchitect/> ) . Success criteria is to provide easily trainable/applicable models using Sanskrit.

  

Lastly, I would invite you to join the project. Also please keep your feedback/criticism/blessings coming.

  

Naman.

Prabhat Kumar Singh
