Hi,

  

I am an ameture researcher on AI/machine learning. There is a need to translate english labels of image data to sanskrit. If possible, please collaborate to translate the labels to sanskrit. It will be very crucial, important and historical contribution.

  

The English text is in following format of 10 lines.

The contributors need to translate such files into sanskrit. There are 8000 such description files.

The outcome will create first every sanskrit model to explain flowers (features) into sanskrit or vice-versa.

  

Here is the git repository. <https://github.com/jollysean/labelsE2S>

  

I can help the contributors in understanding the technicalities, so that they can focus more on Sanskrit department of this project. Also, can pay/financially support if translators do not want free contribution to project.

  

Regards.

Prabhat
