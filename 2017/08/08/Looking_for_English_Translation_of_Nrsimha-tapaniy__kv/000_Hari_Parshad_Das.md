dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams.  
  
i wanted to ask if anyone here has an english translation of the Nrsimha tapaniya upanishad. I have seen the online translations and i am specifically looking for a published translation.  
  
If anyone has a softcopy and would be kind enough to share, it would be really nice.  
  
Thanks in advance.
