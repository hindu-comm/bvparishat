The following should help:

Grimes, John. 1988. A[ConcisedictionaryofIndianphilosophy: Sanskrit-English](http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=22335&recCount=100&recPointer=2&bibId=873420).Madras : Radhakrishnan Institute for Advanced Study inPhilosophy, University of Madras, 1988.

  

The same is published also by:Albany : State University of New York Press in 1989 and 1996.

  

Restricting the search to Nyāyaśāstra may be counterproductive, since the terms likeJati, vyakti, avacchedaka, vibhu, viṣaya … are not confined to Nyāya and even in Nyāya works their meanings are affected by engagement with other darśanas/śāstras.
