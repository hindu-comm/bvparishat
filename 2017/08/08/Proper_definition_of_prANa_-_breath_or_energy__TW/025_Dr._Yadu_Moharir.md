Namste Scholars,

  

I have been trying to follow the thread on "praaNa"

  

It appears to me that the interpretation for the 'samaana" vaauyu is not explained properly.

  

IMO - "samaana" is probably the most important of all because if that "life providing / nourishing entity (OXYGEN) does not reach all the organs / tissues of the body the tissue will cease to function and die.
Thus, it (sammana vaayu) needs to be interpreted as "OXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN", which is the primary mechanism that carries Oxygen through out the entire body.
