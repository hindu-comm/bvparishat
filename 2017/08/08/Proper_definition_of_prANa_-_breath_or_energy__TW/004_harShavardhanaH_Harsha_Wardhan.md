Sri Nagaraj garu,

  

It is surprising how I missed the thread you posted. I thought I had gone through all yoga related posts on BVP on my previous searches. In fact, I remember being surprised by the low amount of posts on yogic matters, but then I realized BVP was created primarily as a list for Sanskrit scholars, and it is only fairly recently that Indic subjects are also being allowed.

  

Coming to the topic, even the Chhandogya Upanishad, which contains, to the best of my knowledge, the earliest reference to prana from a salvific perspective, does not define prana - it just refers to it.

  

I guess I will have to dig deeper at other original sources to get at a proper definition of the term. Maybe the agamas might help.

  

I appreciate you taking the time to give me your valuable guidance.

  

with regards

harsha
