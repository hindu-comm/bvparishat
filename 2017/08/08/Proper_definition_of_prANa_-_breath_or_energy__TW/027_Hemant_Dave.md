Professor Paturi,

1.

Yes, I meant ‘semantic change’. Thanks for providing the ‘technical term’. And glad that you got my point.

2.

For your second point, you reproduced my lines adding your emphasis.

“What Olivelle and other scholars are arguing is quite reverse: prana *is* outward and apana *is* inward breath!". (Your emphasis).

And then added your comments:

“If I read \[*sic!* *Read*: had read\] from you that ‘What Olivelle and other scholars are arguing is quite reverse: prana *was originally* outward and apana *was originally* inward breath!’ \[your emphasis\], I would have thought that you were telling us that the present day to day use of the term apaana is being shown by Olivelle and other scholars to be a semantic change from the original meaning 'inward breath'.

“But your sentences had present tense and not the past tense leaving no scope for thinking of a semantic change.”

What you suggest is, by standards of English, I should have used past tense. You seem to (or I) have had a different exposure to English and there is nothing to complain about it. However, let us assume that what you said is correct, if only for the sake of argument. English is not my mother tongue; nor does it appear (from what you write) it is yours. (Didn’t B. K. Matilal in the beginning of his path-breaking *Perception* make a caveat about his English?) You should/*could* have understood from the context what I meant, for all we had been discussing was *the meaning of prana in ancient India*.

Let’s do a little archaeology.

Harshvardhan ji, who started this thread, mentioned the *Atharvaveda*, *Mundaka* and *Katha*, and later *Chhandogya* *Upanishad*.

In my post I referred to Olivelle’s Introduction (to his translation of the *Upanishad*s) and cited two references: Bodewitz’s ‘Prana, apana and other prana-s in *Vedic literature*’ and Zysk’s ‘The science of respiration and the doctrine of the bodily winds in *ancient India*’. In citing them, I had, keeping with the theme of the thread, Vedic literarure and ancient India in mind, naturally. It is good to remember that we were talking about ancient texts and ancient India.

Then you posted this: “But if it is translated as current of nerve impulses? that Prana (current of nerve impulses responsible for intake of life supporting materials *including inhaling of air*), Apana (current of nerve impulses responsible for expelling of excretions of life processes *including exhaling of air*).” (My emphasis. By the by, translation of what, their ancient or modern meanings? While translating an ancient text, should one translate the(se) words as they are used in (India in) modern times or they were in ancient (India)? I feel only a mu(g)dha would translate them as they are understood at present disregarding their ancient usage.)

Now, it was in response to your this ingenious explanation, which laid down that prana and apana should be respectively ‘translated as’ ‘inhaling of air’ and ‘exhaling of air’, that I pointed out that ‘What Olivelle and other scholars are arguing is quite reverse: \[the meaning of\] prana is outward and apana is inward breath \[in anceint texts\]!’ It is only too obvious that the ancient texts are meant here. Any person with normal intelligence and knowledge of the context will parse this sentence as I have done. If paraphrased, it would read, for instance: ‘\[in ancient texts\] prana stands for outward and apana for inward breath’. (Oops, use of present tense, again!)

Since at this point of time I did not know that I would have to discuss ‘semantic change’ in my future post, the question of my using past tense here does not arise. Had I talked about ‘semantic change’ in *this* post, and *had I juxtaposed the current use of the term vis-à-vis the ancient*, I would certainly have written the way you think I should have written, or something similar. (May I be allowed to know that much English, pray?)

And how you responded? You expediently jumped from ancient to modern India, thus:

“These two words are in *daily use* in all the Indian languages. Apaana as inbreathing is in complete contradiction *with that usage*.” (My emphasis)

So, Dr. Paturi, were we, all this while, in this thread discussing the ‘daily us\[ag\]e’ of those words? NO.

Then came your unwarranted sarcasm:

“Probably scholars want to say that all Indians have been using the word wrongly.”

What made you pass this derisive comment is not my concern. In my reply I put accross that these scholars have shown that in the ancient texts the meanings are reverse. It was, thus, a clear case of ‘semantic change’ (thanks once again, Dr. Paturi!). In your reply, ignoring all previous discussion, you conveniently chose to build your argument on the use of the tense. Sad.

What you have done is sophistry and Dr. Paturi in advancement of knowledge sophistry does not help, really.

I would certainly appreciate if you could justify your translations and refute, with good logic, the arguments put forward by Bodewitz.

With best wishes,

Warmly,

H.



Respected members,

When I cited Bodewitz and Zysk, I was under the impression that Zysk translates prana as exhaling and apana as inhaling. (I had read Bodewitz before but not Zysk. I might have thought, subconsciously, that after Bodewitz’s lucid and cogently argued paper, no scholar would want to translate the words as inhaling and exhaling. But this is what Zysk does; he seem to have cited Bodewitz *honoris causa*!

Thanks to Dr. Paturi I closely read Bodewitz again and I am convinced, once more, that prana and apana stands, among other things, for exhaling and inhaling respectively in the ancient texts. Surely, Bodewitz is not the first scholar to suggest this. He has traced the complete genealogy of research on these two terms. As he shows, it was J.S. Speyer in 1872 who first differed from the great *PW* in translating the terms and that he was followed (independently?) by Eggeling in his translation of the *Shatapatha Brahmana* (1882–1900) and Paul Deussen in his *Sechzig Upanishad’s des Veda* in 1897. These two scholars were not consistent with the translations of the terms, however. It was Caland’s paper Zur Exegese und Kritik des rituellen Sutras in *ZDMG* in 1897 and 1901 (51: 128 ff. and 55: 261 ff.) that convinced Böhthlingk to acknowledge that ‘hopefully, the matter \[of the meanings of the two terms\] has been solved once and for all’ (*ZDMG* 52: 518; *ap*. Bodewitz 1986: 327).

As can be seen, the contention of Dr. Paturi, with the emphatic ‘In any case’, that ‘the argument of apaana meant inward breath has its origin in Deussen’ is untenable. This of course is a minor point.

For those who do not have access to Bodewitz’s paper, a scanned copy is attached herewith.

Best,

H.
