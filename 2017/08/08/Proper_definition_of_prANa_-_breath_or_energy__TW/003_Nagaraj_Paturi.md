Some clues /food for thought:

  

All the five words praaNa, apaana, vyaana, udaana, samaana have common word-components.

  

praaNa and apaana are mutually complimentary but opposite in direction as part of the five praaNas system.

  

As the name of the five praaNas system it means the common feature of all the five.

  

Air /wind as a translation is the insufficiency of English language. Current of signals /nerve impulses could be closer. Ayurveda has a very big number/classification of such 'nerve currents'.

  

As a higher level word/concept, referring to the Ultimate, it refers to that Ultimate viewed as a fundamental impulse of all the impulses.
