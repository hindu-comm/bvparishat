We have a choice:

  

1\. Treat praaNa as one of the five praaNas and praaNa as the name of all the five as two different unconnected words or see the reason /connection for why the same word /phonemic sequence is used in both the sense of the name of one of the members of the group and the name of the group.

  

2\. see praaNa as the five praaNas or as one of them completely different from and not at all connected to the word /concept praaNa used in the Vedas and Upanishads in reference to the ultimate/highest upaasya concept or try to figure out the commonness between the praaNa as the five praaNas or as one of them and praaNa used in the Vedas and Upanishads in reference to the ultimate/highest upaasya concept.
