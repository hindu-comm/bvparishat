To realise that air/wind is a wrong way of looking at praaNas , let us take Sri Harshavardhan-ji's own words in the initiating post:

  

{Prana (inward moving),apana(outward moving), vyana (circulation), udana (head and throat), and samana (digestion and assimilation)}

  

Shall we put air/wind/breath beside every English expression in the parantheses :

  

Prana (inward movingair/wind/breath),

apana(outward movingair/wind/breath),

vyana (circulationair/wind/breath or air/wind/breath of circulation),

udana (head and throatair/wind/breath or air/wind/breath in head and throat),

and samana (digestion and assimilationair/wind/breath or air/wind/breath of digestion and assimilation)

  

Only in the first two it gives the impression of being correct.

  

In all the other three it very clear is ridiculous.

  

But if it is translated as current of nerve impulses ?

  

Let us see

  

Prana (current of nerve impulses responsible for intake of life supporting materials including inhaling of air),

apana(current of nerve impulses responsible for expelling of excretions of life processes including exhaling of air),

vyana (current of nerve impulses responsible forcirculation),

udana (current of nerve impulses responsible for the life processes inhead and throat),

and samana (current of nerve impulses responsible fordigestion and assimilation)

  

praaNaapaanasamaayuktah pachaamyannam chaturvidham

  

If samaana is thecurrent of nerve impulses responsible for peristaltic motion and other such movements in the digestive system, what is this praaNaapaanasamaayuktah praaNa is responsible for digestion and intake of the life supporting stuff into blood and apaana is the current of nerve impulses responsible for the expelling of the remaining stuff.

  

Vaata in Ayurveda too is usually a neurological aspect. Most of those problems labelled as vaata doshas in Ayurveda are in modern medical terms, neurological problems only.

  

Once it is realised that praaNa(s) is/are current(s) of nerve signals/impulses, justifiability of spanda in YV's Brahma spanda s'akti can easily be realised.
