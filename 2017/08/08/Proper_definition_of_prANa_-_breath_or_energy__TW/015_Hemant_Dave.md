Nagaraj ji,

  

That these scholars 'probably \[...\] want to say that all Indians have been using the word wrongly' is your way of looking at things, which I do not want to challenge. I however would want to see it as an instance of change of meaning over the centuries. मृग in Vedic Sanskrit stands for wild animal, in Classical Sanskrit any animal, and and in the NIA languages, if I am not mistaken, it means deer; the Iranian cognate of the same word was developed to mean 'hen' in Persian and (by borrowing) in many modern Indian languages. If someone points out that the original meaning of मृग is wild animal, I would not interpret it as him suggesting that all speakers of NIA use it wrongly. The English 'guest' and 'hostile' (via Latin) have the same meaning (stranger), originally, is another instance. I know that many contributors to bvp do not seem to be accepting/acknowledging such changes in meaning of word (e.g., posts in Rta saying **but** Shankara interprets it as...), but I do.

  

The papers by Zysk are attached herewith for those who want to pursue the matter further.
