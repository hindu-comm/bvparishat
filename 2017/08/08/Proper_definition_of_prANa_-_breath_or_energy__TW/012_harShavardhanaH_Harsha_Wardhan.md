This is a very relevant paper you have shared, Nagaraj garu. Brown makes a full survey of mentions of prana and apana in Upanishadic literature, and arrives at a well-reasoned conclusion that from the heart (center of trunk, I think) above is प्राण, and from the heart below is अपान.

  

My original doubt, regarding the etymology of प्राणis also partly answered in the paper. **प्र**and **अप** both denote movement, and their directions take root from their juxtaposition.

  

To complete the etymological discussion, could you kindly clarify what **ण** could mean in प्राण and**अन** inअपान \|

  

thanks

Harsha
