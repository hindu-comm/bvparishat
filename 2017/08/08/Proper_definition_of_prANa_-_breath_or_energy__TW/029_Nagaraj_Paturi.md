\>What you suggest is, by standards of English, I should have used past tense. You seem to (or I) have had a different exposure to English and there is nothing to complain about it. However, let us assume that what you said is correct, if only for the sake of argument. English is not my mother tongue; nor does it appear (from what you write) it is yours. (Didn’t B. K. Matilal in the beginning of his path-breaking*Perception*make a caveat about his English?) You should/*could*have understood from the context what I meant, for all we had been discussing was*the meaning of prana in ancient India*.

  

---- Dear Sri Hemant Dave-ji,

  

There is no question of (grammatical) knowledge of English involved here. Even if you would have said in Hindi present tense or Sanskrit present tense or present tense of any other language, to communicate that the scholars wanted to say that that was the original meaning, use of past tense in the language used would have been required.

  

Until you posted the examples of meaning change in words, that the use of present tense was done in the place of the required past tense was not realised. (I think that is natural and reasonable)
