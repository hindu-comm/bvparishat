Giving so many examples of different meanings of the same word in different times and contexts could have been saved by using one technical term 'semantic change'.

  

At the time when I posted as

  

"These two words are in daily use in all the Indian languages. Apaana as inbreathing is in complete contradiction with that usage.

  

Probably scholars want to say that all Indians have been using the word wrongly.![](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/x7Az90uC0FlqG1NQNJvbQl7YtYRlnWzoqu2O_ZLb9xIKhYpJarh3aZrZ_qlU6_VKMQpRwI5_nDi9FsJOqf0XSQHw_6yv1VK7rhIBScGS2g=s0-d-e1-ft#https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif)",

  

all that I read from you was

  

"What Olivelle and other scholars are arguing is quite reverse: prana *is* outward and apana *is* inward breath!". (emphasis mine).

  

If I read from you that"What Olivelle and other scholars are arguing is quite reverse: prana*was originally*outward and apana***was originally*inward breath!",

  

I would have thought that you were telling us that the present day to day use of the term apaana is being shown by Olivelle and other scholars to be a semantic change from the original meaning 'inward breath'.

  

But your sentences had present tense and not the past tense leaving no scope for thinking of a semantic change.

  

In any case, the articles shared by me in earlier posts in the thread show that the argument of apaana meant inward breath has its origin in Deussen.
