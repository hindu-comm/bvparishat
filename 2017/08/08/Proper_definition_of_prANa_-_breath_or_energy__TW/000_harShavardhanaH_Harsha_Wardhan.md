Respected scholars,

  

The wordप्राण has been given many meanings, ranging from "life-force" to "cosmic energy" to "vital breath" to plain "air".

  

The problem that I confront is that the texts that discuss प्राण (ones that I have referred to) assume that its contextual definition is known to the reader and plunge straight into discussion on it.

  

Most texts present an added complication in that they deal with प्राण on three levels:

  

***(i) as actual breath (air) -***

  

- divided into 5 or 10 sub-categories based on their location and function in the body {Prana (inward moving),apana(outward moving), vyana (circulation), udana (head and throat), and samana (digestion and assimilation)} orPrana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Krkara, Kurma, Devadatta, and Dhananjaya.

  

(Interestingly, the Atharva Veda is said to present a typology of 7 prana, 7 apana and 7 vyana)

  

***(ii) as energy, or force, representative of the Lord himself.***

  

Here, Upanishads provide an added layer of meaning: (just quoting to set the context)

  

**Mundaka Upanishad (3.1.9):**  
  
*esho anur atma cetasa veditavya yasmin pranah pancadha samvivesha  
pranais cittamsattvam otam prajanam yasmin vishuddhe vibhavatyesha atma*  
  
**Katha Upanisad (1.3.1):**  
  
*RtaM pibantau sukRtasya loke  
guhAM praviStau parame parArdhe  
chAyAtapau brahmavido vadanti  
paJcAgnayo ye ca tri-NAciketAH*

  

  

***(iii) as jiva himself or life itself:***

  

Not as popular a category as the first two, but some have alluded to this interpretation. VS Apte defines this shade of meaning as the spirit or the soul, or the Supreme Spirit

I have come across only one straightforward definition of **प्राण** as energy or force in the **Yoga Vasistha** (**Nirvana Prakarana, Purvardha, Chap 25**) in the dialogue between the sages Vasistha and Bhusunda, where Sage Bhusunda says**Pranoyamanisham Brahmanspandashaktih sadagatih.**

  

Incidentally, I am not sure of the exact meaning of this definition. Mitra translates this as - **"the vital breath, O Brahman, is a moving force by its nature, and moves suo motu."**

  

But Mitra is from a different era, and I suppose **Brahma-Spanda-shakti** can be defined in another way too, given that Spanda is a big concept in Trika Saivism. I request knowledgeable members to translate this verse also.

**  
**

**I suspect prana means breath (air) laden with energy (power). Is this correctetymologically?**

**  
**

**  
**

**I request knowledgeable members to respond with their valuable inputs on this matter.**

  

  

with regards

Harsha
