To view praaNa as not just air/breath/wind and as some motive aspect is not done either newly or just by me.

  

The very title of the thread has the words breath and energy as alternatives. That shows Sri Harshavardhan-ji himself was aware of such views.

  

Air/breath/wind meaning does not fit the context in many of the meanings given by ancient Ayurvedic and other books.
