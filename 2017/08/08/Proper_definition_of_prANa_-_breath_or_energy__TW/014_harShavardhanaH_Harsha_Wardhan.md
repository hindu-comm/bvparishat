Here's another paper on the same subject with a detailed analysis from a Vedic angle:

  
The Hindu Conception of the Functions of Breath.-A Study in Early Hindu Psycho-Physics  
Arthur H. Ewing

  
Journal of the American Oriental Society  

Vol. 22 (1901), pp. 249-308

In this paper the rootअन् is explained to mean "to breathe", and VS Apte also defines अन् similarly.

  

  

I thank you Nagaraj garu for introducing me to JSTOR. I was all along under the impression that this was a paid resource, and hence did not try to register there.

  

regards

Harsha
