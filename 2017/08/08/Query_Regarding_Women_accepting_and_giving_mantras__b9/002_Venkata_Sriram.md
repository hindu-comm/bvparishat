"According to the principles mentioned in Vedas, Puranas, Itihasas,Pancaratras, and tradition, can women receive mantra diksa  
(independently of her husband)? Can she give mantra to others also andbecome guru herself?  

//////

  

The women can receive diksha. However, the conditions apply (applicable to shAkta-tantra only)

  

1\) widow can receive with the permission of her son

2\) unmarried can receive with the permission of her father

3\) married can receive with the permission of her husband

  

विधवायाः सुतादेशात कन्यायाः पितुराज्ञया ।

नाधिकारः स्वतो नार्या भार्यया भर्तुराज्ञया ॥ (कुलार्णव तन्त्रं)

  

However,आचार्यत्व for strI is given to one's own Mother and also to women who have attained mantra-siddhi and who are chaste and have guru-bhakti.

  

In Bhairava Tantra:

  

साध्वी चैव सदाचारा गुरुभक्ता जितेन्द्रिया ।

सर्वमन्त्रार्थतत्वज्ञा सुशीला पूजने रता ॥

गुरुयोग्या भवेत्सापि कुलटापरिवर्जिता ।

स्त्रियोदीक्षा शुभा प्रोक्ता मातुश्चाष्टगुणा स्मृता ॥

  

It should be noted that among the 12 propagators ofश्रीविद्या, the wife of Sage Agastya wasलोपामुद्रा who became the teacher & propagator of 'Lopamudra Vidya'.

  

Now, among the vaidika / pauranika mantras:

  

The shastra & sampradaya prohibits the women from uttering 'Om' (praNava) and 'swAha' in mantras. Hence, when such mantras are given, the 'praNava' is either removed or replaced with tAntrika-praNava (ह्रीं) OR prAsAda mantra (औं) and swAhA is replaced with 'namaH'. 

  

There is a tradition of initiating 'gaurI-panchAkSari' mantra at the time of marriage itself to women when 'gaurI-puja' is done.
Unfortunately, this tradition has taken back seat in marriages and importance is only given to videos, photos, buffets and receptions.
