PramaaNas differ from sampradaaya to sampradaaya.

  

What constitutes S'aastra too varies from sampradaaya to sampradaaya.

  

For example, for many Bhakti sampradaayas , Bhaagavata is not mere PuraaNa; it is a s'aastra; it is a pramaaNa. 

  

In Bhaagavata PuraaNa, Naarada in his previous birth was a s'oodra and was given ;but was given deekshaa by the sages.

  

Bhakti paddhat's mantradeekshaa requires its own pramaaNas.
