Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Manoj Sastriji,  
I am also from a family following Vallabhacarya Sampradaya. Now, I am  
following ISKCON Hare Krishna Movement and am involved in developing  
vaidika grama (village) with all aspects in place in Gujarat. You seem  
to be from Surat and we are not very far. I would like to invite you  
to visit our project.  
  
By the way we have our team researching in sastras for detailed  
principles of Varnasrma dharma and how to practically apply it in our  
community. It is a co-incident that currently our topic research  
running is diksa in varnasrma especially following pancaratriki vidhi.  
I was following the thread you started but could not reply due to time  
constraints. Sorry for the delayed reply. I think I have something  
substantial to say here from pancaratras as follows:  
==========  
Bharadvaja Samhita, considered a part of Narada Pancaratra says --  
(Translation mine with bhakti touch as this samhita is for visnu devotees)  
  
prāptamicchan parāṁ siddhiṁ janaḥ sarvo'pyakiñcanāḥ\|  
śraddhayā parayā yukto hariṁ śaraṇamāśrayet\|\|13\|\|  
"One who desires to achieve ultimate benefit (parama siddhi) and who  
is without desire for proprietorship (akiñcana) must take shelter of  
Lord Hari with transcendental faith."  
na jātibhedaṁ na kulaṁ na liṅgaṁ na guṇakriyāḥ\|  
na deśakālau nāvasthāṁ yogo hyayamapekṣate \|\|14\|\|  
"There is no consideration of birth, family, gender, or quality, work,  
etc. nor is there consideration of time, place, and circumstance in  
accepting this yoga process (pāñcarātriki vidhi)."  
brahmakṣatraviśaḥ śūdrāḥ striyāścāntarajāstathā \|  
sarva eva prapadyeran sarvadhātāramacyutam \|\|15\|\|  
"Everyone, whether he be a Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiṣya, śudra, women,  
antyaja, or anyone, should, with full faith, take shelter of Lord  
Acyuta, who is the master of all living entities, through the medium  
of this yoga."  
  
==> This establishes that even women can take diksa.  
  
Later after few verses who can become guru is discussed as follows:  
  
prapitsurmantranirataṁ prājñaṁ hitaparaṁ śucim \|  
praśāntaṁ niyataṁ vṛttau bhajed dvijavaraṁ guruṁ \|\|38\|\|  
"Thus, one who is desirous of surrendering with faith, should take  
shelter of guru who is always engaged in chanting the mantra and is  
knower of bhaktisiddhānta (prājñaṁ), is always engaged in showering  
mercy on fallen souls (hitaparaṁ) without any desire for personal  
benefit, who is always pure in heart or free of sins, peaceful, and  
always engaged in prescribed duties (ordained by his guru or by  
varṇāśrama). Such a guru should be the best of twice born (dvijavaraṁ  
meaning brāhmaṇa)."  
saptapūruṣavijñeye santataikāntinirmale \|  
kule jāto guṇairyukto vipro śreṣṭhatamo guruḥ \|\|39\|\|  
"If such a guru knows his last seven generations or his last seven  
generations were also endowed with knowledge, devotion, qualities,  
etc. and whose unbroken family tradition (kula) is pure (sinless), and  
the guru himself is endowed with all the previously mentioned  
qualities, then such a guru is considered to be the best of all."  
nācāryaḥ kulajāto'pi jñānabhaktyādivarjitaḥ \|  
na ca hīnavayojātiḥ prakṛṣṭānāmanāpadi \|\|41\|\|  
"On the other hand, one cannot become an ācārya even if one is born in  
great family line as mentioned before, but is devoid of jñāna-bhakti  
etc qualities. Also, unless there is an emergency, an ācārya from a  
lower birth or age should not initiate a person from a higher birth or  
age."  
na jātu mantradā nārī na śūdro nāntarodbhavaḥ \|  
nābhiśasto na patitaḥ kāmakāmo'pyakāminaḥ \|\|42\|\|  
"Even then a woman cannot become an ācārya, nor a śūdra, nor an  
antyaja, one who has been cursed, or one who is fallen  
(mahapātakadūṣitaḥ). Also, for a disciple who aspires for  
desirelessness (akāminaḥ) a person with material desires cannot become  
guru.  
striyaḥ śūdrādayaścaiva bodhayeyurhitāhitam \|  
yathārhaṁ mānanīyāśca nārhantyācāryatāṁ kvacit \|\|43\|\|  
"Women, śūdras, etc., can give instructions on good and bad and are  
also worthy of respect as per their qualifications and conditions but  
are not entitled to get the position of ācārya."  
  
==> This establishes that women cannot become guru in any case.  
  
Then there is exception to above:  
  
kimapyatrābhijāyante yoginaḥ sarva yoniṣu \|  
pratyaksitātmanāthānāṁ naiṣāṁ cintyaṁ kulādikam \|\|44\|\|  
"But, because perfect yogis (or nitya-siddha devotees) who are on the  
stage of yoga-pratyakṣa (or self-realized – seeing god face to face),  
pratyakṣitātmanāthānāṁ, take birth in any or every family tradition,  
in such cases no consideration of kula, gender, etc. as mentioned  
earlier apply (they can become ācāryas)."  
  
==> Thus in case of siddha yogis or devotees being born in any family  
and having any gender (male or female) they can become guru.  
  
====================================  
  
Seems this should be fine enough to solve the controversy as far as  
Pancaratra vidhi is concerned. For more please read the samhita from  
below link with commentary of Sarayu Prasada Mishra.  
  
Link to Bharadvaja Samhita with commentary:  
<https://archive.org/details/np_bhsamhita>  
  
Can anyone tell some introduction about the commentator Sarayu Prasada Mishra?  
Comments from respected scholars awaited for my translations.  
  
For vaidika vidhi of upanayana etc. I am convinced that neither can  
women take diksa nor can they become gurus (or give mantras).  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
