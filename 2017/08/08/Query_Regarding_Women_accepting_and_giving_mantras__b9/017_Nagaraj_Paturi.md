Is the information in the web page correct?

  

<http://www.pushtikul.com/pushti_parimal/rules_of_pushtimarg.htm>  

  

8. In Pusti Marg only male Goswami descendents of Srimad Vallabhacharya are qualified to give ashtakshar mantra and Brahm Sambandh initiation. In pustimarg, traditional seat of Guru is not passed on to disciples and therefore, initiation should be taken only from a descendent male Goswami.
