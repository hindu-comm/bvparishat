Dear manoj shastri,  
Vaikhanasa aagamaas detail deeksha vidhi for ladies and is detailed as the fifth special procedure. While detailing on who is guru this samhita is silent about ladies. Veda adhyayana adhikara is not prescribed for ladies,in fact the brahmana explanation and it's sayana bhasha for the mantra to be recited by wife during the mandatory ishti itself instructs so.  
Coming to gargi episode how can one conclude that gargi learnt veda,when in the whole brahmana of that upanishad speaks about only aatmajnaana portion while the proceeding discussions on the same context is purely on esoteric meanings on the purvakaanda portions of Vedic rituals by learnt adhyetaas. Also the vamsha brahmana portion coming later should have her name mentioned,if she had been in the parampara.  
The printed version of haritha smrithi had only 7 chapters. Please share the 21st chapter you have quoted. Same with yama smrithi vachanam quoted by interpreter of vyaakarana prakriya not being available in editions of yama smrithi.

Regards,  
Ganesh.
