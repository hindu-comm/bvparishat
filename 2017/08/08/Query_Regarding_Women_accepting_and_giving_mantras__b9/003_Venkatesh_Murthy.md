Namaste

  

I also heard Swamijis giving Mantra Diksha to aged women after Menopause. This is allowed but I don't know which Sastras allow it. But if the woman is a widow the Swamiji if he is orthodox will require her to shave her head. Widows without shaving head are not allowed in orthodox circles and functions in Mathas and so on.
