Respected Nagarajji,  
  
I belong to Pusti Marga ṣampradaya that are held in traditional haveli  
parampara. My family is disciple of gurus at Jamnagar Haveli, gujarat.  
It is not new but very traditional.  
  
In all havelis women are given deeksha or brahmasambandha for last 400  
years. Vallabhacarya's and his disciples's granthas also mention it.  
But as you pointed out, women in this sampradaya cannot become guru  
although from the family line of Vallabhacarya.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
