Dear Sastriji,

  

From the word in the question itself when "specifically" something needs to be identified it cannot be generalised. interestingly another pancaratra text as well details for ladies deeksha and the fourth level of yaga as aacharyatva and explains that the ladies with permission of husband and without violating his wills will reach devaloka along with arundathi. Shall wait for the answers for other questions.

  

regards,

Ganesh K.
