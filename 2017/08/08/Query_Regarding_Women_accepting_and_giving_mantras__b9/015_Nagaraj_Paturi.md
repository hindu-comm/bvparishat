Sri Manoj Shastri-ji,

  

There is Pushti Marg claiming origin directly from Sri Vallabhacharya-ji.

  

There are many other Vaishnava traditions claiming an origin from a descendant in tradition of Sri Vallabhacharya-ji.

  

I posted a link to Pushti marg web site where deeksha to women is opposed.

  

Do you belong to or Are you talking of any other tradition than Pushti Marg which claims origin from Sri Vallabhacharya-ji.

  

What is the connection of Paanchraatra here?
