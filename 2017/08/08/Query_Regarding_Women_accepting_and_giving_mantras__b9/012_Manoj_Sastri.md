Dear Ganeshji,  
Thankyou for this valuable information. I will look in to Vaikhanasa  
Agama about what you have explained. Can it be said that if not  
specifically mentioned that women can't give deeksa mantra (become  
guru) then it is to be taken that she can as the allowance for her  
taking mantra is already given and thus automatically she can give  
mantra also if qualified (as a man receiving mantra can give mantra  
also if qualified)? Is that not logical?  
  
Regarding Gargy, I will just look into your questions and try to  
understand the matter.  
  
Regarding quotes from Yama and Harita Smrtis, I will just get them and  
post soon here.  

  
Regards,  
Manoj\\<br />
