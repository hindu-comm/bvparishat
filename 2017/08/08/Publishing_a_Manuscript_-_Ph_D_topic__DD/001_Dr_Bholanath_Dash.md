Dear Bharadwaj,

You have to see first the New Catalogus Catalogorum (NCC) volumes. pdf copy of some NCC volumes are available online also. You can find this NCC volume in your library. I don't know which University you are doing your research work. In NCC Volume V Under गणित title some entries are there.

  

Thanking you
