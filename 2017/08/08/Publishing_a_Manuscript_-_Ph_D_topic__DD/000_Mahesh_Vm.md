Dear All,

  

I could see lot of catalogues of manuscripts listed out by various institutions. 

  

But how do we know that a particular manuscript is not published so far.. ?

  

Where is it updated?

  

Sorry for this layman's question. I do not know much on this subject.

  

I would like to pursue my Ph D by publishing an unpublished manuscript.

  

Subject preferably - Mathematics.

  

Sirs.. Can anyone suggest me a work and also where can I locate that ?

  

Or suggest me a Mathematics topic which is not handled much.. for the

Ph D thesis..

  

Regards.

  

Bharadwaj.
