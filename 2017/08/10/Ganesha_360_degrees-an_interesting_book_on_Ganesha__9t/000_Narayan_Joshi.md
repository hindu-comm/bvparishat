The book ,”Ganesha-360⁰ The Science of Smart Living” authored by Dr. Yadunath Moharir is different from the traditional books on Ganesha written from religious and devotional point of view. Members of BVP are familiar with postings of Dr. Yadu stressing the usefulness (Viniyoga concept). He has a doctorate in Chemistry and worked many years in pharmaceutical industry in US. He uses his practical knowledge from the industrial world to bring out purpose behind Ganesha pooja.

Devotes perform pradakshina around the deity Ganesha in temples. Dr. Yadu looks at circumbulation from a different angle. According to him circumbulation can and to be regarded as an essential tool & a protocol, wherein one examines the core issue or central issue (the puruSha) from all angles. In one whole chapter he offers many practical examples where vighnas (obstacles) can possibly be avoided when one studies his undertaking from all angles (vighnastasya na jaayate). He uses stories from PuraNas about Ganesha and uncovers hidden meaning of Ganesha pooja. Ganesha is suggesting to his devotee that I do not remove the obstacles but I suggest to you to look around to avoid them and understand deeper meaning. Dr Yadu uses Sanskrit quotations interpreting them differently to stress their practical utility perspective. They are not just for recitation but for learning the secret of smart living, because all knowledge is for living, and no value after one is dead. In Sarva Pooja, Ganesha pooja is prescribed on various occasions- Vidyarambhe,Vivahe, Paveshe, Nirgame ….etc. On each of these occasions, meaning of Ganesha pooja is explained in another chapter. This book is useful to everybody. It is great self-help type book full of examples from practical life. Each chapter ends with “Take home message” . I recommend this book for professionals, parents, and students in order to achieve success in jobs, examinations and in other undertakings. Everybody should keep this book handy and read frequently to remind oneself the message of Ganesha-360⁰ to follow right path to avoid vighnas. Dr Yadu is not against performing pooja of Ganesh in traditional way. His stress is on understanding signals beckoned by Ganesha during or after his pooja.

The book has six appendixes where shlokas from different Puranas and from compositions of Santa purushas are included. In short this is very useful book. It is available from SVYM Enterprise, DBA-Nutritional Consultant Unlimited, Inc. 8239 E Onza Ave., Mesa, AZ 85212 USA. E-mail [dry...@yahoo.com]().
