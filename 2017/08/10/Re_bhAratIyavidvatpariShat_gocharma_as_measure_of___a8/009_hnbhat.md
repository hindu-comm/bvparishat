13,061.016ab yat kiṃ cit puruṣaḥ pāpaṃ kurute vṛttikarśitaḥ/  
13,061.016cd api gocarmamātreṇa bhūmidānena pūyate//

Here in the verse of MBh "gocarmamātreṇa bhūmidānena" will be meaningless repetition of bhūmidāna and gocarma meaning clearly measurement of giving land would be fit. As suggested by BVK Sastry reading "gocaram" as correction to gocarma will be far fetched in all the references provided by MW taking all to be scribal error!
