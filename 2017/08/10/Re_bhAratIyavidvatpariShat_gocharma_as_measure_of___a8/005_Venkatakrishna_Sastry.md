Namaste

  

1, One suggestion and a line of thinking : The word गोचर्मं seems to me to be a simple mis-reading for the word ' गो -च रम् ' - a word indicating the ' Measure of Land for a 'Cow- grazing'.

Another scaled down concept could be: Gifting ameasure land of 'Go-Charma'- land that a cows skin occupies; which is fairly an area of around 100 square feet , comfortable for a cow to stand and shelter for grazing OR land enough for practice of yoga (Todays measure size being Yoga-Mat area of about 25 square feet) . These days bricks- donation for Mandir is considered as a social cause and meritorious. In the earlier days, the measure of land may have been different by the sixe of a known animal.

  

2. **Logic for thinking on this angle**:

  

(a) The 'skin' as such and 'skin of Cow' is considered ' impure' in traditional schools.

  

\(b\)  The word गोचर्मं seems to me to be a simple mis-reading for the word ' गो -च रम् ' - a word indicating the ' Measure of Land for a 'Cow- grazing'. Even to this day, many Indian villages have a earmarked ' Public space, donated by landlords as a 'Cow grazing space' ( Kannada :गो माळ  ) , which is owned by the community. ( Land grabbers of current period have misused this land is a different issue. To know more on this land for cow graze and revenue department orders and Supreme court cases in India, see links below:

(b-2)<http://www.deccanherald.com/content/366262/circular-silent-protection-gomala-land.html>  
Circular silent on protection of gomala land, tanks - Bangalore, Oct 30, 2013, DHNS 23:52 IST

The Karnataka government issued a circular to all the regional commissioners and deputy commissioners to demarcate village boundaries and protect government land including Gomala and tank bed almost two-and-half years after the Supreme Court’s order instructing chief secretaries of all the states to protect government land.  

  

(c) There are severalerrorsin reading 'manuscript s for the script and ' correlation' with the 'words' as ' preferred by the views of the Editor /Research Scholar', who is'reading' andtranscribing/ and significantly ' the alignment with the views of the funding institutions'.

  

(d ) There is a ' context and purpose' for all 'Daanam' - Gifts under Ritual/ Religion context.

  

\(e\) The ' gift of land' - Bhoomi -danam' is considered auspicious.

  

(f) गोचर्मं / ' चर्मtechnically does not seem to map on the same line as ' कृ ष्णा जिन ' व्याघ्र चर्म  the deer skin / Tiger Skin which is used in ' Upanayana Samskara' as a present .

  

(g) गोचर्मं - is considered as a case to hold ' small weapons' or ' hand-glove' for a warrior.

  

I hope this information helps to have a fresh look at the line and 'ticklish point' raised by Dr. Yadu.

Look forward for scholars inputs.
