Namaste,

  

Gocarma has been dealt in detail in 'Mensuration in Ancient India' by Sarada Srinivasan 1979 and PV Kane's History of Dharmasastra. Relevant pages are attached.

  

Extract from Kane, History of Dharmashastras - P V Kane vol 2 part 2, page 859, foot-note 2021.

2021\. यकिचित्कुरुते पार्प पुरुषो वृत्तिकर्शितः । अपि गोचर्ममात्रेण भूमिदानेन शुध्यति । वसिष्ठ 29. 16, अनुशासन 62.19, बृह. 7, भविष्यपुराण 4. 164. 18. The मिताक्षर on या. I. 210 quotes it as Manu's and reads the 2nd पाद as ज्ञानतोऽज्ञानतोऽपि वा. Brhaspati defines gocarma as equal to ten nivartanas and a nivartana is defined by him as land that is 30 rods (square) with a rod of ten cubits. दशहस्तेन दण्डेन त्रिंशद्दण्डैर्निवर्तनम्। दश तान्येव विस्तारो गोचर्मैतन्महाफलम्॥ बृह. 8. The मिताक्षरा on या. I. 210 quotes बृह. as सप्तहस्तेन ... दश तान्येव गोचर्म दत्वा स्वर्गे महीयते। शातातप I. 17 also reads दशहस्तेन &c, . Br. 9 gives another definition of gocarma ’that extent of land which a thousand cows with their calves and a bull occupy without being compelled to stand doing nothing is called gocarma' सवृषं गोसहस्रं तु यत्र तिष्ठत्यतन्द्रितम्। बालवत्साप्रसूतानां तद्गोचर्म इति स्मृतम्॥ पराशर XII. 49 says that that land which a hundred cows with one bull occupy without being closely packed together is gocarms. Visnu Dh. S. 5. 181 defines gocarma differently as that much land of whatevor extent the crops raised on which will maintain one man for a year'. Wide Aparatrka p. 1225 and Hemadri (Vratakhanda, part 1 pp. 52-53) for several definitions of gocarma.

I would like to know the measure of surface extent which the word गोचर्म denotes. Please clarify.
