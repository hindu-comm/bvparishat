Dear list members

  

I am looking for a commentary/exposition/word-for-word translation of the popular Ganapati Arati‘sukhpakarta dukhakarta’ in Sanskritized Marathi attributed to Samartha Ramadasa. Specifically I am looking for help with the following

  

1\) A better understanding of the Marathi words used: नुरवी (from नुरणे?), पुरवी, फरा,उटी,फरा, पाहे, पावावे, etc. I can look up the Marathi Kosha-s I have, but that may not be enough to get the contextual sense

2) The *anvaya*, for exampleवार्ता विघ्नांची is often written in one line and नुरवी in another line, butवार्ता विघ्नांची नुरवी together makes sense (I guess)

3) The insights, for example why Ganapati is called bothसरळसोंड and वक्रतुंड in the same line

  

Preferred languages are Hindi and English, but I can also understand Marathi.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
