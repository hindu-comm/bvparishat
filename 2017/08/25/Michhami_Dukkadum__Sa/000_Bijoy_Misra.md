Friends,

I received this email today from a Professor in MIT, my parent institution.

\>\> Dear Misraji,  
\>\> Today is the last day of Pajushan, the Jain Holy Week. It is our tradition to fast on this day, pray and then say to each other "Michhami Dukkadum" - which means that if I have hurt you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, I ask for your forgiveness.  
\>\> I say the same to you.  

  

I think this is a beautiful tradition, could be pretty indigenous. 

Though I did not undertake the fast, let me say to you all -Michhami Dukkadum
