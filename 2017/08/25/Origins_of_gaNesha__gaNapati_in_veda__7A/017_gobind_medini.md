Why not? I am 100% native nationalist Indian, but if शंकर भगवत्पाद does not allow people like us to read, learn, and understand Vaidika Suktas why should we believe him and not the foreigners who understand Sanskrit and interpret the Vedic corpus? Further, we do not doubt the integrity of those Indians (NRIs or otherwise) who have recommended these foreign authors for understanding the evolution of this deity.  

  

Here is an article by Dr Dhavalikar in Loksatta (Marathi newspaper) which I had freely translated, supplemented, and uplinked in "Science, Religion, Philosophy" group in 2013.
