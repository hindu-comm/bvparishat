In the Madhva philosophy, Ganapati is accorded a place in the Mandukyopanishad. He is also admitted as a srishṭikartā in a limited sphere. Sri Jagannathadasa's Harikathāmrtasāra also has this element. Also, they hold Ganapati as the younger brother of Skanda.

  

The famous Advaitin, Sarvajnatman of the 9 CE, in his invocation to his Samkshepaśārīraka composes a verse to Ganapati hailing him as the jagatkāraṇam.
