With all due respects to every commentators: Every PuraNa Story has a parallel contemplative practice behind it. Should we practice to perfection we will see the truth of the Veda. Kanci Parmachayra says, puraNa is the 'lens' of Veda.  
So, what is ganApathi? There is an excellent article in the Book: Yogic, Vedic Heritage Festivals of Bharata -which is an English translation of a book in Kannada language by Swami Shri Rangapriya Shri. I am one of the translators (love of labor project - the book is sold at cost to the publishers). You can find more information in this book on Ganesha and few other Gods of our festivals.  
  
A simple over view: Ganesha is the Door keeper of Sushumna marga in us at moolaadhaara (Ganesha Atharva Shirsha). I.e. he is one of the three knots of yoga. A knot is known as a granhti.

A ‘granthi’ also means a ‘head’. The act of untangling a knot, is technically known as chopping the knot. By chopping the head or the knot one can gain access to the pathway of knowledge and become wise.
The popular story in which Ganesha’s father Shiva chops his head off and later replaces it with an elephant’s head, allegorically, represents the feat of untangling the knot by yoga practice and gaining access to the path way of knowledge of all things and becoming wise.
