नमस्ते,

The framework in my opinion needs some mending. Ganesha is not to be found as being literally mentioned in the Veda.

There is a mechanism “संवर्तन“ through which the same deity is represented in different texts or traditions. In mathematics this concept is known as “homomorphism” that forms the very core of Mathematical or Physical Enquiry.

A very basic example of संवर्तन is the presence of a Devi for each Deva; e.g. इन्द्राणी for इन्द्र, and so on.

So, Ganesha is also present in the Veda, but as a deity that “is a different deity” to the literal minded.
