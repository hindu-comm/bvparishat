This article by Rajarshi Nandy is worth looking into- <http://www.pragyata.com/mag/the-remover-of-obstacles-148>  
  
Those interested in a philsophical interpretation of the Story of Ganapati, may refer to my book Musings on Hinduism, which has a brief chapter on it- <http://www.amazon.in/Musings-Hinduism-Nithin-Sridhar/dp/9383826304/>  
  
Regards,  
Nithin
