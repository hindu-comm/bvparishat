Dear Shri Bhoslay/Bhosale,

  

Kindly punctuate your sentences, so that your intended meaning may be easily understood.

  

If you intend to say that all articles of foreign origin lack genuineness, please explain how you arrived at this conclusion (what your data base was, how wide and varied/diverse it was, if you have direct personal experience of all authors concerned, etc.)

  

It will also be helpful to spell out your own preparation in the field concerned — what your adhikāra or eligibility is (how long you have studied the fields involved, how many sources you have read in their original languages, etc.; please note that I am not asking about your academic degrees, although they may be relevant, too — a person can be learned and perceptive even without having M.A.s and Ph.Ds).

  

a.a.
