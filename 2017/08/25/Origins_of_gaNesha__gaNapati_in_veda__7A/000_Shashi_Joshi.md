Namaste vidvatmahodayAH,

Best wishes to all on Ganesh Chaturthi.

  

I find gaNapatiH mentioned in Rigveda (<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_veda/gaNapatisUkta.html?lang=sa>)  

  

My question is - in what form was he known in Vedas?

As elephant headed?

  

If so, what was the story behind his elephant head as per Veda?

What is the story behind his origin - son of Parvati and Shiva? Created while she went for bath?

If not, where does this story gets first mentioned?

  

And what indeed is the rationale of elephant head?

All stories are created for a purposeful effect on the audience. What is it here?  

  

This is asked with all reverence and shraddhA, but want to understand the spiritual aspect of this story.

Even if it is not spiritual, it must have an intended purpose.

  
  

Dhanyavad,  

\~ Shashi
