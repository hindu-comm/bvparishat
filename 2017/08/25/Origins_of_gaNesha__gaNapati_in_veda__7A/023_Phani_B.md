I have had this doubt from a long time. The rik that we use while invoking Ganapati "GaNAnAm tvA" from rigveda hasBrahmanaspati is
devata.

However, both Indra and Ganapti have same beja which is "lam" from mantra shastra which may have some connection to the other rik from rigveda "mahahasti dakshiNena".
