Ganesha in the yoga and tantra traditions may also be examined by those who might have studied the traditions.

  

In the discussion on the six chahkras it is seen that Ganesha is in the muladhara, i.e. the rectum, which is the end point of the alimentary canal. Ganesha is said to represent prithvi tattvam, which is the main contributor to the making of the physical body. It is the physical body with all its desires is the main cause of obstacles for the spiritual practitioner and hence it is symbolically the Vighnanayaka. We are expected to dwell on this prithvi tattvam and slowly get over the obstacles caused by the body. This is a simple vedantic understanding of Vighneswara.

  

In the tantra tradition, which is as old as the vedic tradition, there are forms such as Ucchishta Ganapati. Probably the Vedic tradition slowly absorbed the tantric tradition of Ganesha.

I have not read the article of Rocher.
