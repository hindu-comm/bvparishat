Dear Prof Paturi,

As Prof Iyengar indicated, the question could be rooted the process of knowledge organization

through the "meta" process. It appears to me that for application purposes, "descriptive/analytic"

literature gets converted to "cryptic/directive/declarative" literature. The latter would be only

comprehended by people who have a learned background. Compaction can force abbreviation,

symbolic substitutions, contextual groupings and metaphors. The questions that come could be

many. Two principals are:

\(1\) When such process might have started in the growth of literature?

\(2\) Did anyone create a methodology for compaction?.  

The answers may not be easy to find and we may have to keep looking.

I taught courses on knowledge organization in AI etc some twenty years ago.

I was not aware of the deep sutra literature. So is the interest.

Best regards,

BM
