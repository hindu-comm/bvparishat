This thread is being started as a branching out from the thread on a valuable topic by Prof. Bijoy Misra-ji.

  

I don't know if this was the question intended by Sri Bijoy-ji:

  

While concise, accurate, expressions of scientific ideas such as definitions, laws, theorems etc., are common between S'aastras and Sciences (contemporary and of western origin), why Sutra granthas or Sutras as a an organised book or a book with organised system of Sutras is found only in S'aastras and not in Sciences?

  

Why a Sutra grantha gets stabilised once for all for a S'aastra and all the later development of S'aastra happens only as further and further or varying or mutually opposing or debating interpretations of these settled down sutras unlike in Sciences where laws/theorems are essentially expected to be falsifiable by the later laws/theorems and the development of Science happens only in the form of newer laws/theorems falsifying the older ones?

  

Whether this was the intended question of Sri Bijoy-ji or not, I think the above questions on topic of Sutra granthas make sense to the members and discussion on these lines can add value to Indic Knowledge Traditions.
