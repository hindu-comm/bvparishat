Dear Sri Bijoy-ji,

  

Shall we keep the question of why did it originate , when did it originate and how did it grow /evolve into that form to the older thread or a new thread separately started for the purpose

  

and

  

the question of why here not elsewhere to this present thread here?

  

unless we feel that one of these entangled with the other and one of these can get answered by the other?
