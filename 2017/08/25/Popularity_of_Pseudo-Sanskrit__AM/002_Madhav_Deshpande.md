Dear Murthy-ji,

  

Many years ago, my wife and I were attending a Satya Narayan Puja at the home of a friend, and to my shock, the "learned" priest was randomly adding anusvāras and visargas to word after word. After the Puja was over, I asked him about this, and he said that is how Sanskrit is.
Words end either in an anusvāra or a visarga, and you need to add these if the printed pothi does not show this. None of my teachers had taught me this secret of Sanskrit!
