Mistakes can take place anywhere, particularly in the use of language.
All of us have learnt from mistakes. If there are mistakes in the slogans, the scholars may write to the appropriate authorities suggesting corrections. It is not proper to criticise something done with good intentions. It is not proper again to brand it as pseudo Sanskrit. It is too much to call them 'priests of the ruling party.' Even in *parihāsa*, there should be an *aucitya.* Let us not forget that we are Sanskritists steeped in *samskṛti.* Nobody is beyond criticism but the Prime Minister of a nation should be given due respect.
