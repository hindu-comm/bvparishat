My regards to all the scholars here,



My question is related to ‘Critical Edition’ of ancient texts e.g.*Rāmāya**ṇa*and*Mahābhārata*by BORI.

I wish to know very basics of the process and the end result. Being a person who does not know Sanskrit, I request replies on my queries either in Hindi or in English.



((1)What is a VulgateEdition?



((2)What is a Critical Edition of a text? Does it represent certain form that was available at some point of antiquity, ascertained from available manuscripts?



((3) If some portions of the presently available editions are omitted from critical edition, does it mean that there was a time when they were not there in the original text altogether?



((4)Should those portions be treated as interpolations?



((5) What is the process to reach till critical edition? Are mathematical and statistical tools used in the process?



Thanks,

Girijesh Rao
