- A People's Edition, i.e. an edition which is popular among the general public, as opposed to scholars.

- There seems to be no universally accepted definition, which is understandable given the situation with manuscripts. The attempt is to provide a most likely "standard" edition, while carefully noting all differences in available manuscripts compared to the CE (critical edition). Since scholars work long and hard to arrive at such a Critical Edition of the text, that is usually taken as the standard for further references etc. In India, critical editions of Ramayana and Mahabharata do not seem to have received such wide acceptance.

- The considered opinion of the Editor is that the omitted material does not belong. So while side-stepping the question of whether it might have been a part of the "original text" or not, the opinion of the Editor is that it is an interpolation. The Editor may not always be able to say with 100% confidence that the Ur-text (i.e. the earlier text or original text) did not have this material.

- Yes, in the view of the Editor based on the evidence available to him or her at the point of publication of the CE.

\- We might or might not. Each successive iteration would be more laborious than the earlier ones and would yield only a fraction of improvement. As things stand, preparing a Critical Edition does not seem to use too much mathematics or statistics, but it is possible. For instance, while editing the Mahabharata, instead of counting all available manuscripts, all similar manuscripts are grouped and each group is given a weight. So there might be a hundred manuscripts in Nagari, but these would be classified into, say, two recensions - the one following the commentary of Nilakantha, and the other a Northern recension. As against this, there might be only 3 manuscripts in Sarada script. These three would represent the Kashmiri recension. So, fifty manuscripts are equated to three.
