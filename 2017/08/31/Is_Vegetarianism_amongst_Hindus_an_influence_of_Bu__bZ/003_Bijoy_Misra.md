I just went through the massive Charaka samhita compiled by Segments I through VI.

While he creates a strong foundation for the wellness with rational explanation,

he has no hesitation in "prescribing" meats of bird, animals and fishes for use as

diet and medicine. The text is dated 2nd century BC. This would suggest

that meat-eating was popular or various kinds of meat were widely available.

He has a great study on the biochemistry of various animal tissues and fat cells.

When he recommends uncommon animals, he would like to hide the information

from the patient! While he most likely compiles the information, his apparent

thorough grasp of of the tissues in the human body and their conditions could amaze

any physician.
