Namaste,

  

Pujya Swami Dayananda Sarasvati ji (Arsha Vidya Gurukulam) used to connect vegetarianism to the Taittiriya mantra, almost whenever he quoted ओषधीभ्योऽन्नम्। He used to say that food is only vegetarian. So our source of influence of vegetarianism lies in Vedas itself. I thought this might be relevant.

  

Kind rgds,
