'The oldest possible' is the point relevant to the thread too.

  

The oldest version of the text is given the date between 8th and 9th centuries BCE.

  

This is pre-Buddhist.

  

Hence the oldest version version of Mahabharata is pre-Buddhist.

  

The version reconstructed by the Critical Edition is pre-Buddhist.

  

ahimsaa paramo dharmah is pre-Buddhist.

  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

pre-Buddhist or post-Buddhist are diachronic views.

  

I brought in an ahistorical /synchronic concept, 'independent of Buddhism'.

  

I argued on the basis of 'maa himsiih' mantras that non-violence (of course placed along side violence towards the harmful ) is part of Veda mantras themselves and hence independent of Buddhism. Mahabharata which is vedaartha upabrimhaNa inherits this view from such Veda mantras and hence its ahimsaa paramo dharmah is independent of Buddhism.
