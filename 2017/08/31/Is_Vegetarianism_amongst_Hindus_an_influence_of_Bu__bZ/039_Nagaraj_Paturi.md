I could not respond to this long post as I was travelling and was carrying out the moderation work through my mobile phone.

  

Now I went through the post.

  

Though the post does not deal with the main theme of the thread, it connects us back to the post referring to Prof. Adluri's work on the unity of Mahabharata.

Now Sri Hemant Dave-ji is quoting Prof.Vishnu Sitaram Sukthankar's words,

These are the kind of views argued against by Prof. Adluri.

PS: As an aside I may point out that inइतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत् by Veda the Mahabharata is meant as shown by Professor M. A. Mehendale.

  

  

Veda inइतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत् is not Mahabharata.

  

Mahabharata is one of the Itihaasa -PuraaNa books through which samupabrimhaNa of Veda i.e., the actual Veda in the form of Veda mantras, is being brought into a samupabrimhita form.इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत् means'Itihaasa -PuraaNa books including Mahabharata are samupabrimhita forms of Veda.
