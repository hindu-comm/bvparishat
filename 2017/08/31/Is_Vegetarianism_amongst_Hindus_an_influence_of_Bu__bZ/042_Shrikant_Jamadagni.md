As I mentioned in my earlier post Maharshi Manu puts his considerable weight on the side of vegetarianism; he promotes it, lauds it.

  

So what is the date of Manu-smriti as also non-vedic texts that advocate vegetarianism?

  

Does anybody think that Manu-smriti's pitch for vegetarianism is later addition?  

  

thanks
