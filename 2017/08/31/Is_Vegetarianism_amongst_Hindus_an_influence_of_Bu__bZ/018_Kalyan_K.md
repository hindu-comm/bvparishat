//Mahabharata is older than Buddhism and Jainism is undisputed and well established//  
  
Sri Nagaraj garu, The commonly assigned date for Mahabharata is 400 BCE to 400 CE. These dates are post-Buddhistic/post-Jainic. However, I am not sure how these dates are arrived at. If you have other dates that lead to your conclusions, please feel free to share. Thanks.
