Nagaraji,

  

With due respect to all, I have to submit that I am extremely leery about the current

dates assigned to various epochs of evolution of Indian concepts and events.

While I say this, I don't have a firm alternative. All I can think that it has to be left for

the future researchers to reconstruct from further archaeology and mathematical

modeling. It may take several decades/centuries of fresh analytic work.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra.
