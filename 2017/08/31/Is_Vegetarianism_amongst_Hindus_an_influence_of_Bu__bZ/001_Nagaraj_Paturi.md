Dear Dr Sivasenani Nori garu,

  

\>What I want to know is this: Is there any textual evidence to say that practice of ahimsaa and vegetarianism amongst Hindus is an effect of these two religions?

  

---- Let us divide this into two parts:

  

1.Is there any textual evidence to say that practice of ahimsaa
amongst Hindus is an effect of these two religions?

  

2.Is there any textual evidence to say that vegetarianism amongst Hindus is an effect of these two religions?

  

Answer to #1: Emphatic NO! Mention of ahimsā and mention of the principle "ahimsā paramō dharmah" description of the practice of ahimsā by r̥śis is very much pre-Buddhism and pre-Jainism.

  

Answer to #2: You quoted my words, "Vegetarianisation of Hinduism or sections of it , ***even if it is*** the influence of Buddhism or Jainism or any other thing" (emphasis new )

  

'even if it is" in my words obviously shows that 'Vegetarianisation of Hinduism or sections of it isthe influence of Buddhism or Jainism or any other thing ' is not my opinion or stand.

  

That part of my statement is part of a method of argument.

  

In this method we grant validity to the pūrvapakṣa just temporarily,
just for the sake of argument and then counter that argument.

  

My counter- argument was-

  

just as thepūrvapakṣa can not walk/run nude or eat raw food /flesh, on the basis of primitive man being believed , by thepūrvapakṣa itself to have walked / to have run nude etc., the pūrvapakṣa can not justify today's non-vegetarianism on the basis of a pre-Buddhist or pre-Jainistnon-vegetarianism being presented by them aspūrvapakṣa.

  

I don't know any Buddhist or Jain text claiming to have reformed Hinduism.

  

It is the modern westernized Indian and some of the western researchers of Indian culture who emphasise the differences and discontinuities between Vedic and Buddhist / Jain thoughts sidelining /ignoring the continuities between them , that make such claims.

  

As long as we overlook this divide and rule strategy of these groups and continue to look at each other with hostility, we render their strategies successful though unwittingly.
