1\. Non-violence in Vedic tradition being pre-Buddhist /pre-Jainism or in other words independent of Buddhism / Jainism should not be surprising because expressions of non-violence or expressions such as "Ye, don't commit violence against...." are part of mantras of Rigveda and Yajurveda themselves. There are several mantras ending in मा हिंसीः।


  

2\. But the characteristic of Vedic tradition which baffles a non-discerning, non-subtle, crude, superficial observer is the thriving of its ideal of non-violence always alongside its allowance to harm, kill, punish etc. There are Vedic mantras instructing to harm/kill harmful entities. Some mantras express a wish for courage, strength to succeed in such harming/ killing / punishing.

  

That one way of looking at 'non-violence' is to save entities vulnerable to violence from such violence by resorting to violence against those committing violence against such vulnerable creatures is a subtle understanding of non-violence inherent in the Vedic world-view. क्षत्त्र or क्षत्त्रिय is an agent of such non-violence (no violence against the weak / vulnerable).

  

3\. It is this subtle understanding of violence and /or non-violence rooted in the Vedic tradition right from the Veda mantras that is inherent in Mahabharata that fails a superficial reader of it in understanding the congruence of अहिंसा परमो धर्मः with the remaining parts of the book that make the book appear to be a book of war.

  

4\. Let us take the portions of the book that can not but be integral to the book and see if they have vegetarianism and non-violence.

  

One such portion is संभवपर्व , शकुंतलोपाख्यानम् । It can not but be integral to the book because it provides the source of the name of the book itself. It is the story of the birth of the वंशकर्ता of the वंश after which the book is named. The book or at least its early chapter is a वंशचरित्र and is structured as such. Within that वंशचरित्र, this portion is the most vital one because it is the story of the birth of the वंशकर्ता of the वंश after which the book is named.

  

Now, in that story, one of the most significant characters is कण्व महर्षि।

  

कण्व is described in that narrative as a vegetarian, non-violent sage.  

  

His non-violence is indicated through the description:

  

He (Dushyanta) was pleased to see even wild animals being mild (gentle) there (in Kanva's ashram)

  

Entire ashram is described in detail. Not even a single violent activity is described. Shaastras studied there are described.

  

in detail. None of them is a shaastra related to wars or such violent activities.

  

When asked about Kanva, Shakuntala says,

  

Bharata growing on that campus, is described as

  

सिंहसंहननो युवा \|

This violence by Bharata is not condemned by the extremely non-violent sages there.

  

  

Moreover they praised him for the valour and gave the title Sarvadamana to him.

  

Why did Dushyanta go there? For the violent activity of hunting.

  

But he showed extreme respect towards the extremely non-violent sages lead by Kanva.

  

Non-violent sages encouraged violent Bharata and violent Dushyanta showed utmost respect for the non-violent sages.
