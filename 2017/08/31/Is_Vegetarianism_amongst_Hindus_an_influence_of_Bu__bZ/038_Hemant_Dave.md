Vishnu Sitaram Sukthankar was a great scholar. He had a great sense of humour too. Since I lack both, scholarship and humour, I quote him.

  

In his *Meaning*, Sukthankar refers to certain Professor Thadani, professor of English at the Hindu College of Delhi who thought that the *Mahabharata* is “but an account of the connection and conflict between the different systems of Hindu Philosophy and Religion”. The learned professor further assumed that the Great Epic is not a mere story of the deeds of mythological or historical gods or heroes ; but “a wonderful explanation of all systems of Hindu Philosophy and Religion ... which, when examined in the light of ancient method of Letter-analysis, reveals the great secret of its real meaning and mystery.”



On Professor Thadani’s original and ingenious views Sukthankar writes:



“This ‘letter-analysis’ is a real magic wand in the hands of .Professor Thadani. With the help of this mysterious instrument, the learned Professor gets the most astounding results. People have so long considered the Gambling Match as the most realistic and heart-rending scene of the Whole *Mahabharata,* and some soft-hearted people must have even shed surreptitiously a few tears when reading the pathetic scene of the denudation of the noble Princess of Pancala by the vicious Dushasana. Professor Thadani brushes away all this shallow and misplaced sentimentality. “The word for gambling in the text”, argues Professor Thadani, “is Dyuta (d, y, u, ta) meaning, (d) giving, (y) Buddhi, (u) woven with (u) the

senses of knowledge, and (ta) the senses of Action. The Gambling Match is thus a discussion between Buddhi on the one hand (Yudhishthira), and the senses of Knowledge and Action, the basis of Jainism (Shakuni) on the other.” A foreign critic has ungenerously remarked about the book that it is confusion worse confounded. I will not criticize this theory. Professor Thadani is right in insisting that for debate or discussion there must be a common ground of agreement between opposing views, without which a discussion is impossible. I have none with the learned Professor, nor have I had the good fortune of coming across anybody who had. Professor Thadani stands unchallenged.”

  

Best,

PS: As an aside I may point out that inइतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत् by Veda the Mahabharata is meant as shown by Professor M. A. Mehendale.
