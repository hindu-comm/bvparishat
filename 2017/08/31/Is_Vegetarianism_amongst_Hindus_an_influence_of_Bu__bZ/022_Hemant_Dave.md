I wonder if there any difference between the 'nucleus' of the text and the text as we have it (either Vulgateor CE). If the 'origins' of the text (or events?) are dated to the eighth century BCE, does such dating*eo ipso*prove that the text as we have it is *equally* old?



If Adluri is arguing against the "accretion and redaction theory" it is because his teacher Alf Hiltebeitel believes the Mbh to be a 'unitory' work written by a coterie of authors over a couple of centuries. To quote him: 'I suggest, then, that the *Mahabharata* was composed between the mid-second century B.C. and the year zero.' For Ramayana he says, ‘I think the *Ramayana* must have been written at about the same time as the *Mahabharata*, or if anything a little later’ (*Rethinking the Mahabharata: A Reader’s Guide to the Education of the Dharma King*. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press.2001, pp. 18–19. By the by, there is no “year zero”.)



We have on one side the ‘analysts’ and ‘unitarians’ on the other (to borrow these terms from “Homer”ic scholarship). Both the groups have their different data, different arguments and different epistemologies. When we naively club them together, we commit epistemic violence. Goldman, for instance, dates the kernel of the Ramayana before the Buddha (in his Introduction to the English translation of the Balakanda), but then he is an analyst (believe in accretions, interpolations, etc.); Hiltebeitel, on the other, takes these epics to be without any growth over the centuries but dates them post-Maurya.

  

My question is: is it wise to eclectically (or arbitrarily?) place these epics (or maybe the Mbh alone!) in pre-Buddhist period and also deny any increments in them?
