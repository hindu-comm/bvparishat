just going through the <http://ancientindianwisdom.com/> and like the vegetarianism & beef-eating Rishis & dalit & women oppression narrative for Bharat,

  

find that even our websites are falling for the East India Company fake Indologist conspiracies.

  

it talks of the

Ancient Indian Civilization, amongst other world civilizations is the oldest and is distinguished by its profound thought and wisdom. This civilization is identified as the Vedic Civilization, Sindhu-Sarasvati civilization and **Aryan civilization. **

**the Dravidian Aryan Divide is the Biggest hoax pulled in by the EICo self-styled historians (who were just employees and evangelists) like Max Mueller & Bishop Caldwell who didnt know any sanskrit but used gullible sankrit pandits to translate for them, so that they could distort our shastras.**

**"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and famous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in all of us. And when we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."......Marianne Williamson**
