Sir

  

Pranam.

  

Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

  

While one instance was pointed out from one of the Suttas, I was unable to locate it as exact reference was not given. Due to lack of earlier study, I took some time to figure out the relative positions of various texts within Buddhist tradition before reading long texts. It looks like I have to go through a rather long Sutta to get the exact line. Meanwhile work pressure is not allowing me to do further study. Since vegetarianism itself is not universal within Buddhism, at least as far as food is concerned my sense is that we will not find much in Buddhism, but one should expect to find some statements against animal sacrifice.

  

Food-wise, Jainism may be a richer source.

  

To sum up, not a whole lot of references have come up from members of BVP as of now, but unfortunately, that does not establish anything.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
