To demand / expect all Hindus to eat either vegetarian or non-vegetarian is against the spirit of diversity which is hallmark of Hinduism.

  

Recently I heard an author who is in news for writing a controversial book on merchant caste, demanding on TV that all vegetarians must start eating non-vegetarian.

  

Asking all non-vegetarians to start eating vegetarian is as ridiculous.

  

Asking that on the basis that 'Hinduism is a vegetarian religion' is even more ridiculous.

  

'Hiduism' has never been and is not uniformly /universally vegetarian or non-vegetariam
