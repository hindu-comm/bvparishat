Friends,

Many of you might disagree with the following observation of mine.

It contradicts the present theory of human behavior. But I have pondered

on it for a long time through personal observation and observing others.

I was with a few Buddhist monks last night and we discussed.

  

Let me share. Theview can be stated as follows:

  

1. Truth and non-violence are traits of human biological signature.



2. From these two, non-violence is possibly the original attribute.
Man

  can think, plan and defend. Man need not directly confront.

  All men like to be self-contained. 

  

3. Violence in mind can arise due to the scare of survival. Men are not

  violent when they invite adventure like climbing a mountain or swiming

  ocean. They get violent when their food is denied or they are attacked.

  

4. Violence in mind is inflicted and not generated. It develops through

  learning. Learning is cultural in nature and is not biological.

  

5. So we try to unlearn through various new learning or we try to discover

  our "self".

  

Please feel free to ignore or comment.

  

Best regards,

BM
