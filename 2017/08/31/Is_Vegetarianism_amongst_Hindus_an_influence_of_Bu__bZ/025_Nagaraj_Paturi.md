His focus is not that.

  

That part of the focus is mine.

  

Critical Edition is construed to be the 'original' form of the text. 'Original' form of the text is given the date earlier to Buddhism.

  

If Critical Edition is given a post-Buddhist date, then what is the significance of the date 8th century being mentioned in connection with Mahabharata should be answered. If that is considered to be the date of an older form or the date of the oldest form of the text, which needs to be earlier than that of the Critical Edition, then the efforts of the team preparing the Critical Edition should be considered to be a failure because the very purpose of their efforts is to trace the oldest / original form of the text.
