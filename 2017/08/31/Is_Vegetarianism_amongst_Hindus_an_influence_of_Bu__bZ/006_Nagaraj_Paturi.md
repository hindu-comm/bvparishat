"However, despite the divergent perceptions of ritual butchery noticeable in the Vedic and post-Vedic texts, the general Upanisadic idea of ritual killing of animals as futile gained in strength and may have culminated in the doctrine of ahimsa, which is the defining trait of Buddhism and Jainism."

"The Sutta Nipata records the story that several old and decrepit but rich brahmanas once visited the Buddha at Jetavana to ask him whether their practices were in conformity with those of earlier times. The Buddha however answered in the negative and taught them that cattle should not be killed for sacrifice;9 for, like our parents and other kin, cattle are our great friends and give us food, strength, beauty, and happiness. Thereupon the brahmanas are stated to have given up the killing of cows."
