\>My question is: is it wise to eclectically (or arbitrarily?) place these epics (or maybe the Mbh alone!) in pre-Buddhist period and also deny any increments in them?

Did the Critical Edition team recognise additions to the 'original' text?

  

Yes, it did.

  

Does Prof. Adluri agree with the team?

  

Yes, they do.

  

Thus does Adluri agree that there were increments to the text?

  

Yes, he does.

  

Then what is his point?

  

Critical Edition is a unitary text is his point.

  

What is he arguing against?

  

He is arguing against the view that the text is a compilation of mutually incoherent ideas.

  

In what way is it relevant here?

  

Ahimsaa paramo dharmah is integral to the text.
