Sir,

  

Can you please help us understand how this is connected to the present thread?

  

This approach to human nature is already found in modern Hindu thinkers such as Swami Vivekananda. He posits this 'human is inherently good, divine' approach of him against 'human is by birth a sinner' approach.

  

If you take purushaarthas as innate human urges, the imnate urge for dharma is already there in it.

  

There is a thread alresdy discussing morals being intuitive or not, this may belong there.
