But what is the truth anyway?  
  
This is this book: **<https://www.scribd.com/document/27692654/Jainism-the-Oldest-Living-Religion-001195>  
  
**Also, Rishabhadeva (the first thirtankara in Jainism) is considered the re-initiator of Sramana philosophy, which would include ahimsa as a core philosophy, in this era and if he and his son is talked about highly in vedas that means they already existed as great kings before the vedas getting written.  
  
In my opinion though, if jains accepted Rishabhadeva as a thirtankara does not make him a jain. Nor does it imply jainism, the specific religion which came later as an introducer of ahimsa or vegetarianism.  
  
I agree this is good to show them that veg'ism did not only belong to India but I for one would not bow down to the goons. Instead I would like India to be the leader of vegetrianism and veganism in the world. We have science too on our side. No need to feel ashamed.
