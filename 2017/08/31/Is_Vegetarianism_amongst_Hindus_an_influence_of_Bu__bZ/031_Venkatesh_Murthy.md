Humane killing

  

<http://kb.rspca.org.au/what-do-we-mean-by-humane-killing-or-slaughter_115.html>

  

In ancient times killing animals in humane way was not possible because they did not have electric shocksto make animals unconscious before killing. orrifles for rapid death.Therefore they made the Ahimsa rule because killing was inhumane. This was the reason for vegetarianism. If you ask old people they will say they are not afraid of death but they are afraid of suffering before death. They always wish forvery quickand peaceful death without suffering. Himsaa is not only killing but it covers making the animal to suffer torture before death. The torture before death is worse than death.
