Dear Nagarajji,

I assume you are referring to my post.  

I am sorry if you thought that the post did not follow the track.

I am of the view that vegetarianism in the trait of non-violence is a biological signature

than a religious injunction. I expressed such view.

The date and inception of Jainism are debatable

Please feel free to remove my post in case it is found irrelevant..

Best regards,

BM
