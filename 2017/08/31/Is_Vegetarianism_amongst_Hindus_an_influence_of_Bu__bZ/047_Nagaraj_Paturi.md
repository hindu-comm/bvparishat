Go to<https://theveganoption.org/vegetarian-history/>

  

DN Jha, who is one of the participants in VegHist Ep 1 is not there in VegHist Ep 2, because in his book he talks of non-vegetarianism in Buddhism too.

  

In further episodes the Jain significance in the story is relegated into insignificance through Greek contributions, Egyptian contributions and what not.

  

So the story is that Veganism has its origins all over.

  

Good.

  

Better than a guy who is nowadays going around blaming Brahmins, Jains and the merchant caste for the 'menace' of vegetarianism and demanding that non-vegetarianism should be forced on all these vegetarian groups.

  

This website is useful to tell him that the white, his gods, are saying that the 'menace' of Vegetarianism has its origins all over, not from Brahmins, Jains and the merchant caste.
