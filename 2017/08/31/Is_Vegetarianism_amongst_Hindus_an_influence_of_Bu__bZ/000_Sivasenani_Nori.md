I am starting a new thread so as not to divert the focus of the other thread.

  

Salutations to the learned scholars!

  

I heard the assertion that Vegetarianism amongst Hindus is an influence of Buddhism or Jainism. As one example of the existence of this kind of thinking, Prof. Nagaraj Paturi recently wrote "Vegetarianisation of Hinduism or sections of it , even if it is the influence of Buddhism or Jainism or any other thing, is similar to developments such as changing from primitive food, clothing and shelter styles into later styles".

  

In a similar vein it is asserted that ahimsaa in Hinduism is an effect of Buddhism and Jainism.

  

What I want to know is this: Is there any textual evidence to say that practice of ahimsaa and vegetarianism amongst Hindus is an effect of these two religions? It is understandable that such references would not be found in Hindu texts, but surely somewhere Buddhism and Jainism would boast that they reformed Hinduism, or something to that effect?

  

About ahimsaa, based on what I read, from the days of Nirukta, stance of Sanatana Dharma is that killing in a sacrifice is not himsaa because Veda says so. Mimaamsaa has a similar stance - that only injury caused outside Vedic sacrifices is himsaa. Sankaracarya takes a similar stance.
