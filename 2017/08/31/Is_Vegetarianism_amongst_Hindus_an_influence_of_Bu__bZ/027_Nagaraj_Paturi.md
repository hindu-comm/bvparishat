Why non-violent sages encouraged violent Bharata?

  

Since क्षत्त्र or क्षत्त्रिय as an agent of such non-violence (no violence against the weak / vulnerable), needs valour.

  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



One of the most prominent faces of movements of non-violent movements and environmentalist movements today is the anti-war philosophy.

  

Is Mahabharata an anti-war book?

  

What is the angirasa of Mahabharata according to Anandavardhana?

  

śānta.

  

What is the sthāyībhāva of śānta?

  

nirvēda or śama.

  

What does that mean?

  

Aanandavardhanaachaarya of 9th century AD read the book as the one with vairāgya as the central emotion, not as a book of war and violence.

  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Is there an internal evidence in the book for the view that the book is an anti-war book?

  

What is the udyōga (effort) in udyōgaparva?

  

The parva has simultaneous efforts of preparation for war and prevention of war.

  

Let us take bhagavadyānaparva portion ofudyōgaparva.

  

There is a huge anti-war portion of the lecture by Yudhiṣṭhira here.

जयो वैरं प्रसृजति दुःखमास्ते पराजितः \|

सुखं प्रशान्तः स्वपिति हित्वा जयपराजयौ \|\|५९\|\|

Does this mean that the entire discussion is anti-war? There is a long debate back and forth for and against war in this episode. Among many arguments offered in justification of war, the one that repeatedly crops up is the justifiability of punishment to the offenders of Draupadi.

  

Then what is the whole context of the anti-war talk ?

  

The line of argument in all the lectures including that of Sri Krishna is that to prevent war is the foremost priority as per Dharma. But to allow the villains to grab the portion of kingdom even after the condition of vanavāsa and ajñātavāsa is fulfilled is also not Dharma. After all the Dharmas are balanced, the net result is that war should be executed only as the last resort only after exhausting all the options available for preventing the war are exhausted.

  

This priority for prevention of war is what is being highlighted here as part of the discussion on non-violence.
