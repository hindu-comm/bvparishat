Despite a lot of discussion on what critical edition is and what it is not in this forum, your following remarks make me think that you have some original views regarding it.

  

Critical Edition is construed to be the 'original' form of the text. 'Original' form of the text is given the date earlier to Buddhism.

If that is considered to be the date of an older form or the date of the oldest form of the text, which needs to be earlier than that of the Critical Edition, then the efforts of the team preparing the Critical Edition should be considered to be a failure because the very purpose of their efforts is to trace the oldest / original form of the text.  

  

The idea was to trace the oldest possible and not **the** original text. What Sukthankar wrote was this:
