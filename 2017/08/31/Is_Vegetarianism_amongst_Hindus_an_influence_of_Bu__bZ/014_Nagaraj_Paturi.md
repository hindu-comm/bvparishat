Mahabharata is older than Buddhism and Jainism is undisputed and well established.

  

Mention of Ahimsaa in it is obviously older than Buddhism.

  

What is to be noted is that the book begins with the narratives against killing snakes etc.

  

पौष्यपर्व in which this snake-narrative occurs in fact begins with the story of a dog cursing Janamejaya for hurting its baby.
