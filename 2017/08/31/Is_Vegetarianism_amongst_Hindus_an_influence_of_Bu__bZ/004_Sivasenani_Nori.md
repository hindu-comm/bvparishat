Sir

  

I understood your intention clearly, when I first read your post in the other thread. The following clarification from me is in order. Typically when we say that people say X or Y, it is customary to cite examples. Since you are much respected on this forum, I thought that your sentence is a good enough example. That is why I introduced your sentence with the remark "as one example of the *existence* of such kind of thinking" (emphasis added). This *existence* is not in you or your mind, but in loka, for only when people have such views will a scholar even make a poorvapaksha of it. For instance, we do not go to the trouble of stating as poorvapaksha, a view such as "Jesus Christ is the avataara of Prajaapati" (by the way, I did read some such view, voiced by an early nineteenth century first-generation Christian of Calcutta, who was originally from an orthodox family), since it is not widely prevalent.

  

So, while I do suspect that people like Romila Thapar and their speculations are responsible for such views, since I have not read works of, or about, Buddhism or Jainism, without the lens of Sanaatanadharma, I am asking for pointers, so that a considered view can be developed.

  

Having said the above, I realize that there is scope for some readers to think that the *existence*, referred to above, is in your views. I hereby clarify that such is not my intention. I will take care in future to draft sentences more precisely (may be with avacchedakas :-) ) to remove the scope for such misunderstanding.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
