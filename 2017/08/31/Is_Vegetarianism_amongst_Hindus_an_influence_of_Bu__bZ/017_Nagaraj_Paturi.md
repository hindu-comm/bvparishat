Dear Sri Bijoy-ji,

  

\>I assume you are referring to my post.  

  

Yes, that was in reference to your post only.

  

\>Please feel free to remove my post in case it is found irrelevant.

  

Googlegroups technology does not have a provision for any other person than the posting member to remove the post. Even a moderator or any other management member can not remove the post.

  

I did not intend to say that your post has objectionable stuff and does not deserve to get posted to the forum. I even suggested that it may suit to be posted in the other thread.

  

\>The date and inception of Jainism are debatable

  

Let me try to get connected to this statement: It may mean, "You guys are saying that non-violence in Vedic literature such as Mahabharata are older than Jainism. It is not easy/possible to decide in this matter because the the date and inception of Jainism are debatable. You are saying this to counter the theory that non-violence in Vedic literature/culture is an influence of Buddhism and /or Jainism. But if an older date is proved for the inception of Jainism,the theory that non-violence in Vedic literature/culture is an influence of Buddhism and /or Jainism may then be proved right."

  

If this is how it gets connected to the present thread, let me say that dates of many things like Mahabharata, Vedas etc. are all debatable. The present discussion is based on the present understanding. If new dates are decided, the discussion is bound to change.

  

\>I am of the view that vegetarianism in the trait of non-violence is a biological signaturethan a religious injunction.

  

  

Let me again try to connect to the present thread: It may mean, "Let us not debate Vedic non-violence and/ or vegetarianism older Buddhist/Jainnon-violence and/ or vegetarianismolder,non-violence and vegetarianism are in the origins of all human society. So there is no surprise if it is expressed in ancient Vedic literature. Opinions like those of D N Jha that Buddhists and Jains too ate non-vegetarian are questionable because there can not be non-vegetarian in the beginnings of any tradition of humans"

  

There are both sides to this issue in biology. Vegetarian side is for example:
