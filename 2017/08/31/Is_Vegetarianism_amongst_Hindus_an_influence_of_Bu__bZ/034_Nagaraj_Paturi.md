\>I am not sure either way, which is prakshipta later addition and which is original. And also not sure how one determines this.

  

The threads on BVP on Critical Edition, Textual Criticism etc. deal, precisely, with this topic only.

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/critical$20edition%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/Kziie9QogX4/HdUeffggBgAJ>  

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/critical$20edition%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/1DachGbPcbU/UaXYIiBgAQAJ>  

  

Once you understand through these threads or some other guidance, how prakshiptas are decided etc., please come back to this thread and follow it closely.

  

You will be able to know that what you thought missing is exactly what is covered in the thread.

  

If any portion of the Mahabharata text is found in Critical Edition, as per the theory of Critical Edition, is not a later addition.

  

Please follow the thread:

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/violence$20in$20yajna%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/Mhr_u4Q2qvU/soCEzOLTCAAJ>  

  

If you mean the same as what is being discussed in this thread, by your words,

  

"There are references in Mhb that say that sanctioning of meat eating has been added by bad guys later, it was not like this before etc.",

  

please note that the verse being discussed in the thread is part of Critical Edition, so should be considered as not a prakshipta.

  

Ahimsaa paramo dharmah is also found in the Critical Edition. Hence not to be seen as a prakshipta.
