Nagaraj ji,

I read all your posts, and learned a lot as well. I have had similar thoughts on this topic of ahimsa and sanatan dharma but didn't have the detailed references.

  

What I have found missing so far in the discussion is : since there are many later additions to Mhb, is it possible the ahimsa texts are later additions, after Buddhism or Jainism started to stress on it? I am not stating, just questioning the possibility. And I don't find it wrong either way. Just want to know.

  

There are references in Mhb that say that sanctioning of meat eating has been added by bad guys later, it was not like this before etc.

  

Now, this itself could be a later addition!  
  
I am not sure either way, which is prakshipta later addition and which is original. And also not sure how one determines this.

  

Any light on this will be well appreciated.

  

Pardon any mistakes or miscommunication.  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
