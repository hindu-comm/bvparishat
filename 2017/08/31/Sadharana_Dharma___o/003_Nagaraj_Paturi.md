I said, 'People in India too are guided by the morals of their respective villages, tribes, castes, communities etc. enforced by the respective social groups through mechanisms such as public opinion, caste and village panchayats etc.'

  

Within this diversity of moral instructions, the Vidhis and Nishedhas of Vaidika Shaastras are also part.

  

The statements of Vidhis and Nishedhas incorporate a consequence for performance and / or non-performance of an action.

  

This consequence is either in the form of reward or punishment.

  

Common man is motivated either by a desire for reward or fear of punishment.

  

Only an enlightened person , a jnaani can know the do or the don't without the help of a code of vidhis (do's) and nishedhas (don'ts) and can be motivated to perform the vihitas and nishiddhas without looking for rewards or punishments.

  

Again in Vakyapadiyam, this analysis is expressed in the verses:

  

या प्रवृत्तिनिवृत्त्यर्था स्तुतिनिन्दाप्रकल्पना /

कुशलः प्रतिपत्ता ताम् अयथार्थां समीहतॆ // वाक्य\_२।३१९ //

  

Words of praise and censure are composed for the purpose of persuading and dissuading (or motivating people towards do's and don'ts). A clever receiver of meaning of such words does not take the meaning of those words literally. 

  

विधीयमानं यत् कर्म दृष्टादृष्टप्रयॊजनम् /

स्तूयतॆ सा स्तुतिस् तस्य कर्तुर् एव प्रयॊजिका // वाक्य\_२।३२० //

  

Action which is prescribedas giving a tangible or intangible benefit is praised. That praise is meant only to motivate towards action.

  

व्याघ्रादिव्यपदॆशॆन यथा बालॊ निवर्त्यतॆ /

असत्यॊ ऽपि तथा कश्चित् प्रत्यवायॊ ऽभिधीयतॆ // वाक्य\_२।३२१ //

  

Just as a child is dissuaded ( from say, crying) using the threat of a tiger and the like, (a consequence of) (natural or supernatural) harmful effect is mentioned (in statements of 'don'ts) though that effect could be untrue.

  

न संविधानां कृत्वापि प्रत्यवायॆ तथाविधॆ /

शास्त्रॆण प्रतिषिद्धॆ ऽर्थॆ विद्वान् कश्चित् प्रवर्ततॆ // वाक्य\_२।३२२ //

  

A wise person even after realising this truth about theconsequence of natural or supernatural harmful effect that is mentioned in statements of 'don'ts in shaastra , does not perform the action that is prohibited (because he understands why the action is prohibited)
