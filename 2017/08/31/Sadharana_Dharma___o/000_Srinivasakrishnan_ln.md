QUOTE

  

As a culture, India has no sense of morality. We have never focused on morals and ethics in this country.

It seemed to my untrained eye that the article was downplaying the role that the concept of *sādhāraṇa dharma* had in people's lives. I'm sure he had a reason for doing it.  

  

My own interest is in following up on the original sources for the *sādhāraṇa dharma* as understood by ordinary people. I mean all those lists of do's and don'ts they teach you in school such as ahiṃsā, satya, asteya, indriyanigraha, śauca, dhṛti, kṣamā etc. Aren't there some handy verses for this in e.g., Manu?

  

Thanks,
