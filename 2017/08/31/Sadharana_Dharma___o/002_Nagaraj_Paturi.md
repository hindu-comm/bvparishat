I read that piece by Sri Jaggi-ji.

  

He says,

  

> 
> > "At times, it appears easy to sermonise on morality and ethics. But > morality and ethics appear good only when applied to others, never on > oneself. *But a person is imbued with consciousness, does not have to > be told, “Do this or do not do that”. Such a person will act > appropriately and according to a given situation.* >
> 
> > Everywhere else in the world they try to tell you what is right and > what is wrong. In this country, by contrast, you are not told what is > right and wrong. *You are only told what is appropriate in a given > situation. What is appropriate today may not be so tomorrow.* All the > embodiments of the divine you worship — Rama, Krishna, Shiva — cannot > call be called morally correct figures. They are not. Because it never > occurred to them to be that way. But they are the peak of human > consciousness. >
> 
> > If you want something indigenous — not indigenous to this nation, but > germane to to your being — do not impose rules; do not dictate, “thou > shall not”. That is because people will bypass morality at the first > opportunity they get. *Let us make the necessary effort to see that > human consciousness operates in a certain way because that is the only > insurance — and the ultimate one — that we have.*" >

Vakyapadiyam has this to say:

  

इदं पुण्यम् इदं पापम् इत्येतस्मिन् पदद्वयॆ /

आचण्डालमनुष्याणाम् अल्पं शास्त्रप्रयॊजनम् // वाक्य\_१।४० //

  

( With regard to the two words (concepts) , this is pāpam this is puṇyam, śāstra is of not much use for people of all classes including the caṇḍāla class )

(All people can judge what ispāpam and what ispuṇyam by themselves through intuition )

(caṇḍāla lit. those who are the most courageous, providing services that look horrifying to others, comprising of services like caretakers of cremation grounds, hangsmen etc. )

  

It goes on:

  

चैतन्यम् इव यश्चायम् अविच्छॆदॆन वर्ततॆ /

आगमस्तम् उपासीनॊ हॆतुवादैर् न बाध्यतॆ // वाक्य\_१।४१ //

(Like consciousness, tradition too is eternal, perennial and has been perpetually carried by people. Those who follow such a tradition are not affected (guided) by their own or non-traditional logic in judging this)

  

For the time-being, if we set aside the issue of tradition, lest we should digress, we may notice that the idea of consciousness is invoked by Vakyapadiyam too. )

  

Sri Jaggi-ji is probably talking from this kind of understanding. This is an advanced level of understanding.

  

This consciousness is considered to be operating among humans through antarātman or manassākṣin equivalent to English conscience. Vakyapadiyam subscribes to innate knowledge school in epistemology. As per this school, conscience too is innate. Empiricist epistemology may hold that conscience, the intuitive ethical/moral sensitivity (among other things) is post-natally acquired. Sri Jaggi-ji's words indicate his subscription to innate conscience.

  

But such a high level understanding is not understandable to all.

  

People in India too are guided by the morals of their respective villages, tribes, castes, communities etc. enforced by the respective social groups through mechanisms such as public opinion, caste and village panchayats etc. As such, it may be exaggeration to declare,

  

> 
> > "As a culture, India has no sense of morality. We have never focused > on morals and ethics in this country." >
>   
> > 

He was probably keeping the apparently 'immoral' aspects in itihāsas and purāṇas.

  

Pūjya Vēdavyāsa's Mahabharata is a guide to train people to understand various cultures, customs such as polyandry, surrogate parenthood etc.,
from a cultural relativist perspective. Sri Jaggi-ji probably is trying to make modern generation understand such things.

  

But if not properly received, statements such as "As a culture, India has no sense of morality. We have never focused on morals and ethics in this country.", may be misleading to the less intelligent audience.
