Namaste,  

  

The great sanskrit scholar & modern economist Dr.V R Panchamukhi needs no introduction to the scholars' community

who is also one of the members of this august forum.

  

A few months back, he gave beautiful discourses in english about the importance of BG and it's relevance to the current society  

from management & administrative perspective which was telecast in SVBC Channel in night.

  

I followed most of his lectures in SVBC channel. I was spell-bound for his scholarship and yet a simple & humble approach. Generally,

orthodoxy & modern approach is a rare blend among the scholars and Dr.Panchamukhi Ji is of such a combination.

  

The Raghavendra Swamy Mutt, Mantralayam has uploaded online all his lectures which has come to almost 80 episodes.The teachings of BG

have been explored from Management perspective and very useful for personality development discourses.

  

Here is the link to listen.
