//Hari Om everyone!

  

Chinmaya International Foundation is hosting a new Webinar series on Introductory Sanskrit by Dr Varun Khanna who holds an MPhil in Sanskrit grammar and a PhD in Hinduism (Vedanta) from Cambridge University, UK. He is Assistant Professor of Sanskrit at the new Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth (University for Sanskrit & Indic Traditions) based at Adi Sankara Nilayam, Ernakulum, Kerala.

  

Dr Varun will be teaching an introductory Sanskrit class via Webinar weekly starting on Sunday 5th February 2017.The classes will start from scratch, and explore the depths of the coolness that is Sanskrit.
Please be sure to sign up if you are interested, and if you know anyone else that might be interested, or even if you don't, please share this link widely:

If you live in a country whose time zone doesn't allow you to view the class live, you can attend the class over "relay", which means the class will be put up on YouTube so you can view it at a time that is convenient for you. So definitely still sign up no matter where you live in the world!

  

For those of you wondering whether you can still sign up, YES! If you are a registered student, you will have access to all the videos of all the classes (even the ones you missed). Registration will remain open until Week 5, because until that time you can still feasibly catchup. Do enroll and spread word.//
