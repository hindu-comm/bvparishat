Namaste



On \< व्युत्पत्ति / विग्रहवाक्य of स्वान्ताच्छभाव \> and given Guru paadukaa stotra:



1. Guru-Paadukaa Stotra is not a case of ‘solecism’ . The composiiton would appear as ‘solecism’ – when one does not make sufficient contemplation on the ‘meaning of the Samskruth Term, as applied in Yoga-Saadhanaa ‘ context; and limits the analysis to superficial sound-structures and ‘ preferred appealing translations’ !



**Definition of Solecism** : 1 : an ungrammatical combination of words in a sentence; also : a minor blunder in speech. 2 : something deviating from the proper, normal, or accepted order. 3 : a breach of etiquette or decorum.



2. Amarakosha provides the meaning for the term : (१.४.३१५)
चित्तं तु चेतो हृदयं स्वान्तं हृन्मानसं मनः



svantam = Covers the meanings related to ‘Chitta, Chetas (=Consciousness), Hrudayam (= Heart, symbolic of emotions), Maanasam ( related to mind= Vaasana), Manas (= Mind).



The translation or intention of the sloka is not limited to ‘ purity of heart’. It has a far reaching implication by Saadhanaa- instructions.
Guru-Paadukaa stotra is not just a eulogy of the ‘Gurus sandals’. Neither it is a ‘ stuck to the worship of Gurus sandals’ in the place of a ‘ Iconic Devataa Pratimaa’ as a substitution and string to hold on for adhyatma- sadhanaa. Sri Guru-Paadukaa Stotra is a yoga instruction – ‘ poojana model’ for Sadhakas to ‘ Purify their internals at various layers from Chitta through the manifest aspects of life style’. This is the meaning that one arrives at by applying yoga way of understanding Samskruth composition.



3. When this aspect of the term ‘svanta' in the third line understood, then the term 'svaahaa' in the second line would become clear and gets properly aligned to the Sanatana Dharma – Poojaa-Paddhati, as ‘ Antar-Poojana’::Worshipping Devataa in ones own hrudaya’ ( hrudayastho janArdanaH) as ' Tapas'. 



 ‘ svaahaa’ is a special term for ‘use in the context of yajna; ‘svaahaa-sahya-aksha-dhurandhara’- turns out to be an instruction related to ‘ Antaryajna’. The practice guidance is to be learnt from the competent 'Guru'. This is the preceding step to get the pre-qualification for the practices stated in the third line, and progress by the layers of meaning, associated with the term ‘svAnta’.
