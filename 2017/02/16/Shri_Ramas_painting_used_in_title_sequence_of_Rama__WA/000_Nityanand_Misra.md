Dear list

  

For the past ten years, I have been trying to find out the source of the painting of Shri Rama in the attached image. As many members would recall, this painting was used throughout the title sequence and opening credits of every episode of Ramanand Sagarâ€™s Ramayana.

  

The painting, the vertical lines, and the vertical pattern on the right appear to be from a folio of a manuscript. The word Ramayana in Devanagari is most likely not a part of the original painting/folio, as that was the space for the opening credits in the title sequence.

  

In 2010, I emailed Sagar Arts (using the emails listed on [www.sagartv.com](http://www.sagartv.com) then) and Shiv Sagar, the grandson of Ramanand Sagar, enquiring about the painting. I got a response saying that they did not have any information about the source of the painting.

  

My search is still on. If anybody has any information about the manuscript or the school/artist/time of this painting, I will be very grateful.

  

Thanks and regards, Nityananda
