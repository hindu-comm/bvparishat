Dear Prof. S Korada,

Saadara PraNaam!

About a month ago you posted etymology of the word ‘Guru” saying Gu means Andhahkaara and Ru means to dispel that. Here meanings are attached to syllables (Gu and Ru). Is there mention of attaching meanings to “syllables” in any of the ancient books like Nirukta? How did you think of these meanings-any grammatical process involved?
Please pardon me for asking this question. My only purpose is to learn from you. As you know my interest is in VarNavAda.Thanks. NRJOSHI.
