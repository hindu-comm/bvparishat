Namaste

  

Can we add a few more popular such derivatives:

  

durgā: durgati-nāśini

  

ककाररूपा कल्याणी कल्याणगुणशालिनी

  

गं गणपतये

  

शं करॊतीति

  

kṛṣṇa: Here one can fine more than one derivatives:

  

<http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SabdaSaarasvataSarvasvam/index.php/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%83>

  

It looks like one can devise one's own derivation in every case. There appears to be no norm in this. For 'Rāma' too there are such letter-based derivatives.

  

Scholars may throw more light on this niyama or absence of niyama.
