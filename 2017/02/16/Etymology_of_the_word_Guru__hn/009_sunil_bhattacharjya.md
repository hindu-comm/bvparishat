Namaste Sastryji,

  

The word"Guru" is very ancient, and one of the 108 upanishads explained its meaning as the one who removes darkness. I do not remember the verse at this time. Such being the antiquity of the word, should we look into the later texts to contest that meaning of the word?

  

Regards,

Sunil KB
