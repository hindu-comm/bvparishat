Namaste.

  

If we believe in quite a few of the traditional etymologies, it would appear that the linguistscame first and the words later, which can not be true. For example, if the etymology of the word ‘guru' गुरु is gu + ru where "Gu means 'Andhahkaara' and Ru means to 'dispel that'," it would imply that the word guruगुरुwas coined by some philosopher-linguist.During my imaginary walks with our pre-historic ancestors, I have tried to read their minds to find the origin and evolution of words. My theorem on the origin and evolution of the word guruगुरुandits associated word such as AchArya आचार्य, teacher,sir,shri श्री, rajA राजा, surya सूर्य,hari हरि, hara हर, heroetc. is as follows. 

-   Sound of chirping of sparrow is chya च्य / chir चिर / chirya चिर्य.
    Sound of crow's caw is kak-kak काक-काक.  
-   Therefore sparrow is called chiriya चिरिया and crow is called kaka
    काक.  
-   Prehistoric humans believed that the Sun is a bird. Hence names of
    Sun are based on sound of birds. e.g. a word for Sun is khaga खग
    (\<kaka काक). Other common words for bird and Sun are patanga पतंग,
    pakshina पक्षिन andpUshaN पूषण (\< pakshin पक्षिन).  
-   In the same way the word Surya सूर्य is derived from chiya चिया /
    chiriyaa चिरिया a word for sparrow, -   chiya चिया \> jua (word for Sun in Swahili). Chirya \> churya \>
    jurya \> jurava (Swahili word for sparrow).
-   chiriya> jiriya \> siriya \> surya सूर्य (I have tried to derive 77
    words for Sun in 65 different languages of the world from chiriya
    चिरिया and khaga खग. Ref.[Why our ancestors might have called the
    Sun as Sun हमारे पुरखों ने सूरज को सूरज क्यों कहा
    होगा](http://dnaofwords.blogspot.in/search?q=sun)<http://dnaofwords.blogspot.in/search?q=sun>) -   Both Sun and fire have light and heat. Therefore, words for fire
    might have been derived from the words for Sun.In fact, the words
    peru पेरू is used for both Sun and fire. peru पेरू> feru \> fire
      
-   Surya सूर्य \> jurya \> jyura \> jwara ज्वर \> jwala ज्वल   
-   Because the first Guru गुरु of the world would have been the person
    who was expert in lighting a fire and to teach others to do so,
    therefore, the word guru गुरुmight have been derived from the word
    for fire. jwala ज्वल (fire)> jwalu ज्वलु (one who can ignite fire)
    \> gyaru ग्यरू \> guru गुरु.
-   The guru गुरुwho had the expertise and control over fire must have
    been head of the group. Therefore, Jwara ज्वर \> chyara \> chajara
    \> caesar/ czar. -   jwa**ra** ज्वर \> **ra**jwa रज्व \> rajya रज्य > raja राज \> raja
    राजा. That would mean the guru and raja were the same person in the
    times of our pre-historic ancestors.  
-   jwari ज्वरी \> shyri श्य्री \> shri श्री /sr स्री i/siri सीरी / sir
    सर  
-   Shri श्री \> shari शरी \> hari हरि/ hara हर.
-   shri श्री \> hari हरि> hero
-   Surya सूर्य/ jurya \> churya \> charya चार्य \> Acharya आचार्य \>
    adhi अधि + Acharya आचार्य \> adhicharya अधिचार्य \> dhicharya
    धिचार्य \> diicharya दिचार्य> teacharya टिचार्य \> teacher.
