Dear Prof Korada, Saadar PraNaam

Thanks for explaining meaning of the word GURU. You have added: one can take a device for some purpose and leave it behind after the purpose is served. There is no norm that a device should be like this and this.

I would like to add some interesting examples of such devices:

In Nirukta contention is raised against the method of etymologizing as adopted by the reputed grammarian Śākaţāyana. He split up a single word into its constituent syllables (akşara) and derived each of them from different roots. This, the opponents argue, is fantastic and proceeding too far. In justifying Śākaţāyana’s principle Durga cites a Brāhmaņa passage, in which a word is derived from more than one root and as such lends support to the procedure followed by Śākaţāyana. For example in Śatapatha Brāhmaņa (XIV.7.4.1) the trisyllabic word hŗdaya is derived from three different roots—viz. hŗ from the root **hŗ,** da from the root **dā** and ya from the root **i.** So Śākaţāyana cannot be blamed when he is following the Brāhmaņas that constitute the greatest authority in such matters.

The term ***nighantu*** has been derived by Yāska in as many different ways—viz. from the ***ni***+root ***han, ni+***root ***gam, ni +*** root ***hr*** etc**..** The logic behind using multiple roots is these roots can be shown to have some or other affinity with the resultant vocable.

Respected Vidvān V.Subrahmanian requested scholars of BVP to throw more light on this niyama or absence of niyama. I say now there is no niyama in etymological explanations of Sanskrit words. Use any device-prakriti, pratyaya, syllable, root, or even single phoneme (Varņa).

I used Var ņas from Varņamālā (periodic table of articulated letter sounds) not for as any device as described above but because there is an order inVarņamālā. The advantage of using Varnamālā is the order in semantic elements attached to Varņas with no randomness. They change gradually along with physical properties of letter-sounds. As I stated before there is no Sphota doctrine in Nirukta of Yāska. Many ancientāchāryas supported Varņavāda. I feel now vindicated in usingVarņavāda to fetch out internal beauty of Sanskrit words. BVP scholars feel free to raise objections to my posting because I believe Vāde vāde jāyate tattvabodhah!. N. R. Joshi
