Namaste



Please, May I be helped to understand why the ‘ names’ and sound/ varna-letters’ in names must always be stretched to a ‘ artha –nirvachana’ = meaning elucidation ?



This effort would be understandable if the ‘ terms such as ‘ganapati’ are used for dhyana and ‘ mantra-japa’.



It is true that Vaidika-Shabdas are associated with a lot more tags that are considered in Pratishaakhya and Viniyoga directives; but then , they are not treated as ‘ mantra-akshara beejas’. Nor the generic meaning and function-action association is always given.



For example, the word ‘ashwa’ for horse is explained. But would a similar explanation go for ‘haya, turangama’ also ?



May be there was a hidden wisdom in the ‘Samjnaa’ proprosition and ‘ concept of ‘ samjna-praamaanayat’ by Panini .

Look for more illuminating exchange of information .

Namaste



Can we add a few more popular such derivatives:



durgā: durgati-nāśini



ककाररूपा कल्याणी कल्याणगुणशालिनी



गं गणपतये



शं करॊतीति



kṛṣṇa: Here one can fine more than one derivatives:



<http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SabdaSaarasvataSarvasvam/index.php/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%83>



It looks like one can devise one's own derivation in every case. There appears to be no norm in this. For 'Rāma' too there are such letter-based derivatives.



Scholars may throw more light on this niyama or absence of niyama.

Dear Prof. S Korada,

Saadara PraNaam!

About a month ago you posted etymology of the word ‘Guru” saying Gu means Andhahkaara and Ru means to dispel that. Here meanings are attached to syllables (Gu and Ru). Is there mention of attaching meanings to “syllables” in any of the ancient books like Nirukta? How did you think of these meanings-any grammatical process involved?
Please pardon me for asking this question. My only purpose is to learn from you. As you know my interest is in VarNavAda.Thanks. NRJOSHI.
