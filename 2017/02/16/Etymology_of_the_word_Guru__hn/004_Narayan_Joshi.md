Dear BVK, Namaste!

Your perspective is from Mantra science, Japa, Yoga to look at the Sanskrit words used in Vedas and in related spiritual books. However there are hundreds of words of secular nature in Sanskrit. These are names of instruments used (example-Cakra, MaNi-Mekhalaa, Krakara-ParNa, Ulukhala) in the ancient times. If one limits himself to Sanskrit of religious scriptures, it is his choice. VarNavaada tries to cover all kinds of words.

  

And VarNavaada is not a new subject. Many ancient achaaryas were in favor of VarNavaada. This has been discussed by me on BVP many times. Mine is New VarNavaada based on physical properties of letter-sounds. It simply brings out internal beauty of Sanskrit and Indian culture.

  

So my research and development of the subject goes on. Recently I read books on Nirukta. Certain things I posted from those books here on BVP. I will post soonabout the ancient Aks'ara (syllable) vaada.

  

Right from the ancient BrahmaNa granthas, Brahmins and scholars were interested in etymology because language undergoes changes constantly. Yaaska knew this.

  

It is always interesting in exchanging ideas with scholars like you on BVP. As I posted earlier, there is discussion on the ancient VarNavaada on pages-82 t0 85 of the book of Prof Korada. Thanks NRJOSHI.
