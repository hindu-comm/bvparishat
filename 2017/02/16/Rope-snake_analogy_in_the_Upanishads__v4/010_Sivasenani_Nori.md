Actually the reactions of the learned scholars Sri K. Kalyan and Dr. T. Ganesan stand even if the Advaitic aspect is removed. Their argumentation could be conceived as:

  

1\. Sankaracarya gave extensive references from Sruti for supporting his view.

2\. The rope-snake analogy is very important to his system.

3\. If the analogy were available in Sruti, he would have surely quoted it.

4\. That he did not quote it therefore can be taken as a strong pointer that a) the said Upanishads did not include this analogy, or b) Sankaracarya did not know of these Upanishads, or c) these Upanishads were composed later, or d) these Upanishads became available later.

  

This is similar to the argument about Bhagavatapurana.

  

This is the logical side. The way a sAdhaka views these matters is different (and maybe not relevant on this forum except if such practices are being studied by somebody). Both Bhagavatapurana and other Upanishads enjoy acceptance amongst the sAdhakas, including Advaitins. For them, as long as there is no explicit condemnation, such texts are prAmANika. In fact many other texts like YogavAsishTham are also acceptable following a similar logic.

  

Another aspect is that these texts are considered prAmANika based on AptavAkya, which trumps tarka.
