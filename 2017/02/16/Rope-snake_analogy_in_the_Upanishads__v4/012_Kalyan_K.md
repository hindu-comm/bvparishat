Sri Nagaraj gaaru, IMO, the case of classical Greece is different from the case of classical India. In India, if a text is named as an upanishad, then it is automatically a Shruti and hence it is apaurusheya and anAdi (eternal/beginingless) from the traditional perspective of pUrva and uttara mImAMsa. One would expect that a text that is eternal as per tradition, would precede Shankara. Hence, the assumption of precedence is implicit in the original post.
