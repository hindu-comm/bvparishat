On this point, Sri Sivasenani has already clarified. For the record, I do think that the oldest upanishads like brihadaranyaka (aham brahmAsmi, neti neti) and chhandogya (tat tvam asi, sarvam khalvidam brahma) have a very direct advaitic view. So my personal preference for or against advaita has no relevance to my immediate reaction.
