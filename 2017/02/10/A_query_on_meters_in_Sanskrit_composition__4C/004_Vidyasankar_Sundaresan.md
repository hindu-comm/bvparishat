Dear Sunilji,

  

This is my last attempt at responding, to summarize what has already been said in numerous ways by different scholars on this list.

  

In theory, a good poet can use any word in any composition and make it fit the meter by positioning it appropriately in his verse.

  

However, as the word AryabhaTIya (not AryabhaTTIya) itself is only the title by which the text is known and does not occur within its content, your question about compatibility of the word does not even arise. If you are wondering whether the word AryabhaTTIya will fit into the Arya meter better than the word AryabhaTIya, the problem is that no expert in chandas can say anything about a word that does not directly occur in the text under consideration.

  

The name given to a text in chapter colophons and titles do not count, because those portions of a text do not have to fit any metrical constraints.

  

I hope you realize that your question conflates many unrelated things. The name of an author and the derivative title of his text have nothing to do with the verbal content of that text. Furthermore, even if you assume that there has to be some connection between Arya as the first name of an author and the poetic meter called Arya, it still leaves your confusion about -bhaTa vs. -bhaTTa untouched.

  

I don't know if this helps or if it only further deepens your confusion. In either case, I retire from this thread of discussion.

  

Wishing you good luck and best regards,

Vidyasankar
