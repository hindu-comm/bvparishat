I forgot to add that Prof Prasad had already explained this adequately in the previous thread. Using a word with an -Iya ending, in order to name a text of an author with an a-kArAnta name, simply follows the basic taddhita rule of Sanskrit grammar. There is nothing majorly remarkable about it and as far as I know, the AryabhaTIya has very little to do with the AryA poetic meter.
