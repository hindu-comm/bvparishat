Namaste



Some thing is not finding the right ‘Caesura ‘ here.



a) The ‘yati- niyama’ is a lesser issue compared to ‘ Vyakarana niyama’ : Though we get ‘ api mASham masham kuryaat, chandobhangam na kaarayet’ ?! 



- \< The *caesura* at every 4 mātrā-s is evident: > … IF the singing is taught without a need for language-grammar comprehension ! Example :Mangalashtaka singing to bhajan-taal, Singing of Jaya Jagadeesha hare in many Hindu Temples for aarati, Many ‘ (Gangaa-)
aarti’ songs (Kannada / Or Other Indian Languages) which are only ‘Geya- pradhana’ for audience locked to devotion –ritual and visual grandeur of the finale of the event before ‘prasaad’. \>

- At \< *āryabhaṭ *=**5 --** *ṭīyam *=4.> the ‘*caesura’* could be: \< *ārya-bha* = 4 **--** *ṭī-yam *=4.>

b) ‘ Padaantya-virama’ for pattern recognition-repetition in chandas
is of a higher order compliance related to ‘ pada-antargata – yati virama’. 

 - \< When I recite Āryā, I see pauses only at the end of the 2nd and 4th Pādas:..>





c) Even Bharata allowed the ‘Nata-Vita –Gayaka’ license for ‘ apa-shabdas’ in songs, but Panini is like a hunter chasing them ! So does one base research on ‘Bharata’s License’ or ‘ Panini’s Lock’?
