Dear Prof. Kannan,  
  

There has been interesting and deep discussions on the AryA meter and several scholars including Madhavji and you had been kind to express the views on the AryA meter. Would you pemit me, at this stage. to draw your attention to one of the verses where Aryabhatta himself had included the word "आर्यभटीयं" (please see Golapada verse - 50, copy attached). My related query is : if Aryabhatta would have used the word "आर्यभट्टीयम्" in place of "आर्यभटीयं" in that verse, would there have been any discrepancy like yati-bhanga?  
  

Regards,
