Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  
My question is very simple.  
Had Aryabhatta been the name of the author, could the name of his writing be called Aryabhattia and not Aryabhatia? What I mean is that will the word "Aryabhattia" fit in that composition in "arya" meter. I guess, only a expert in the chandas can reply to this. . The answer will be either yes "yes" or "no". and if "no" what could be the reason. Aryabhatta's stature will not influence this as this is an impersonal discussion on the compatibility of particular word in the composition in a particular meter..  
  
Regards,
