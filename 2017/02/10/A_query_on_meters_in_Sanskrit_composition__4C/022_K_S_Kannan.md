Thank you Suhas for the kind information.  

You have provided a detailed tool for testing metrical correctness for āryā,  

a tool that is already there, though, in works on prosody.  
  

Suhas was my student for a brief spell of time,  
and I have gotten to know from him something I knew but intuitively, as actually having a śāstraic basis.
