I don't quite understand what you seem to understand by the word yati: "The*caesura*at every 4 mātrā-s is evident". Somehow, in the recitation of Āryā that we were taught both in Sanskrit and Marathi, there were no such pauses at every 4 mātrās. There are probably regionally different ways of reciting this and other meters. When I recite Āryā, I see pauses only at the end of the 2nd and 4th Pādas:

  

ā paritoṣād viduṣāṃ

na sādhu manye prayogavijānam (pause)

balavad api śikṣitānām

ātmany apratyayaṃ cetaḥ (pause) 

  

On the other hand, a meter like Śikhariṇī has explicitly defined yati-s splitting all pādas into segments of 6 and 11 syllables \[rasaiḥ rudraiḥ channā\]:

def: rasaiḥ rudraiś channā \[yati\] yamanasabhalā gaḥ śikhariṇī. No such yati-s are defined for Āryā to my knowledge.
