Thanks, Suhasji, for this clarification. I see the caturmātrā structures described by the Vṛttaratnākara, and the violation of that condition in the first pāda of my verse. My confusion in this was partly related to the use of the word yati after each group of four mātrās. Yes, there are the four mātrā structures internal to the pādas of Ārya, but we do not have yati or ceasura after each of these four mātrā groups. Thanks, once again. By the way, do you have a pdf of Andrew Ollett's article that you refer to. For some reason, I do not have access to this article through the library of the University of Michigan. Perhaps they do not subscribe to its online access. I would appreciate if you can share this pdf. With best wishes,
