Dear friends,  

  

I did read a claim quite some years ago that the work of Aryabhatta, in "Arya" meter, was called "Aryabhatiya", due to metric reasons and I believed that without much enquiry. I have also raised a query on this in this group in another thread, but it got drowned in the maze of other arguments. Kindly permit me to raise that question in a separate thread and I am sure the great Sanskrit scholars of this thread in this great forim of scholars, will be in a position to enlighten me on this. The query is as follows :  
  
**Had Aryabhatta been the name of the author, could the name of his writing be called Aryabhattia** **and not Aryabhatia**?  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
