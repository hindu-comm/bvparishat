Dear Prof Deshpande,  
  

I too have to check an explicit source, if any, for the question of *yati* in Āryā metre. I just followed my instinct.  
  

Okay, let me turn the question to you: have you come across verses in Āryā, where there is no natural *caesura* after the 4th *mātrā*, in at least the odd *pāda*-s (and to the extent possible even in the even)?  
  

Regards,  

Kannan
