If some author had been named Devadattabhatta, any work by him could, in theory, be called Devadatta-bhattiya. There was a recent author called vaidyanAtha dIkshita and his compendium, titled smRti-muktAphala is popularly called vaidyanAtha-dIkshitIya. A commentary on bhAgavatapurANa by a citshukha is generally called citsukhIya.

  

However, because Aryabhata's name was never -bhatta, this question does not arise in his case. The two-t spelling, whether for the author or for the text, is nothing more a popular misconception, enforced by erroneous writing in Roman script. Even the authors on Wikipedia, not necessarily a uniformly reliable or scholarly group, have mentioned that -bhatta is a misspelling.<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata>. There is no need to persist in a doubt when it has been resolved completely satisfactorily, is there?

  

I hope this helps. Regards,

Vidyasankar
