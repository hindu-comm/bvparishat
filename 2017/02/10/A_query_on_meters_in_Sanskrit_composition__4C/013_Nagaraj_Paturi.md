*caesura* or Yati is also called as virati, viraama etc. because there is a pause in recitation and such a pause is required for long paadas and not for the short ones. Thus only the second and the fourth lines of aaryaa have a yati or virati or viraama. Where? has several variations.  

  

In Telugu, one variety of aaryaa called kandamu (probably kanda\<skandha) has it at the end of the last syllable of the first three gaNas of the second and the fourth lines.
