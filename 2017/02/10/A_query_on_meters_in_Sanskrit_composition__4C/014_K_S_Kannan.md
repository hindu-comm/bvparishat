I have always read the verse with **easily available** marking off-s at every 4 *mātrā*-syllabics. Thus:

  

ā pari- =4 mātrā-s

-toṣād =4

viduṣām =4

**Total =12**

**-------------**

na sādhu =4

manye =4

prayoga- =4

-vij**ñ**ā =4

(nam) =2 \*\*\*

**Total=18**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

  

balavada- =4

-pi śikṣi- =4

-tānām =4

**Total=12**

**------------**

  

ātmany- =4

-aprat- =4

(-yayam cetaḥ) =7 \*\*\*

**Total=15**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**  
**

It is only in the even *pāda*-s, and **only towards the very end** even there, that we find this non-divisibility into units of 4. (Otherwise, you do not come across a situation where it breaks at 3 or 5 units - as it happened in *āryabhaṭṭīyam*). There is never a case of indivisibility into units of 4; if there is, to that extent it has lost its *geya-guṇa* or rhythmical recitation.

  

You can see this *consistently* followed in **hundreds** of verses. At least I have not come across an exception.

  

The *mātrā-vṛtta*-s in general, I believe, conform to beatings of time essentially. You may witness this pattern in the sub-varieties of *āryā* too - like *gīti, upagīti, udgīti,* and *āryāgīti.*

  

The only caution we may need to take is getting misled in the case of the Sanskrit *chāyā* of Prākṛt verses. (And Prākṛt verses too, one may note, betray this pattern generally).

  

My hunch is that the *kanda* verses (in Kannada, perhaps Telugu etc. too) conform to this; I have not physically checked them.

And if true, this is a universal feature of the *āryā* family of metres.

  

Of course, I have not read anywhere a formal statement to this effect. And I would be thankful to anyone who proves the situation to the contrary.
