Dear Professor Kannan,

  

  Where inआर्यभट्टीयशब्द:do you see a yati-bhaṅga? It has twelve mātrās, and I am not aware of any yati-s in any pādas of the Āryā meter. The definition of Āryā that I know runs as:

  यस्या: प्रथमे पादे द्वादश मात्रास्तथा तृतीयेऽपि ।

   अष्टादश द्वितीये चतुर्थके पञ्चदश सार्या ।।

  Perhaps, there are alternative definitions of Āryā describing yati-s in various Pādas, that I am not aware of.
