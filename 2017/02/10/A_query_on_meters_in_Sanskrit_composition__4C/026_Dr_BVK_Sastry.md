Namaste



At this phase of the discussion on this thread, which primarily started with the ‘ Name –related ‘yati’ in the given verse , **more complications and complex issues** are invoked by bringing in the ‘ Bhoota- Vaidya model analysis of tender ‘Arya meter’ - by Andrew Olett. The author has many comments to offer on the ‘Arya – Lakshana and compliance of it in Arya Saptashati’ (Page 272 of article). 



***The pitch of analysis gets upgraded to the focus on core, critical and larger complex issues, as one wades through the article. The emerging issues are like : ***‘How Samskruth Texts were taught and transmitted in the ‘ Prakrut environment of Maharastri- A language using different referential set of phonology and prosody’. ? What were the norms of the shifts and pedagogy ? Was there a similar challenge in teaching ‘Samskrutham’ in other ‘Prakrut-Desi –Apabhramsha language environment’, which other wise carries the same challenges of ‘Teaching Samskruth in an alien language context like English, German, French’?



The following observation ( from page 272 of the article ) should be sufficient to make this extended discussion on ‘Arya- related Yati’ by Guru-Laghu markers and Gana grouping, as a far stretched one, on fringe lines. IF Saptashati itself failed to observe the Arya –primary rules, why debate about it in one specific instance and use it as a ‘
history –name marker’ ?

2. In the abstract, Olett, the author says: \< The traditional description of the gana-cchandas family of metres of Sanskrit and Prakrit literature, of which the \[1\]arya metre is the best known, refers to ganas or ‘groups’ of matras. Matras correspond to the ‘moras’ of modern phonology. In this paper the \[1\]arya is given a detailed analysis on the basis of the traditional description and the empirical data provided by its use in an early Prakrit anthology, the Sattasaı. Several new metrical phenomena are identiﬁed , and the incidence of syllabic patterns, rhythmic structures, word boundaries, and stress are considered. **The prosodic foot is shown to play an important role in the regulation of the **\[1\]**arya’s categorical and gradient patterns. This analysis uses Optimality Theory to account for both kinds of patterns** and supports recent research that holds partially ranked constraints responsible for gradient patterns in metrical corpora. **Other theories, which derive metrical structure by bottom-up rules, fail to account for the **\[1\]**arya’s characteristic patterns**.>



Again a point to highlight single stanza analysis for the ‘Arya – lakshana conformity to be used as a History-Name-Marker’.



3. Page 274 –shows how Arya was ‘ vocalized and sung in Prakrut Variants with different patterns – Maharashtri and Sauraseni : A point that was brought in earlier by Professor Deshpande.

4. The Lakshana from Vrutta ratnakara provided in the post is more classical and leans towards ‘Sanskrit –Arya meters’ than ‘ Arya – Prakrit’. 



5. The observations on page 278 of the paper under the sub title:
Theoritical implications have serious issues that need to be addressed; and this strikes at the root of this entire debate and the analysis modeled for ‘Arya’ –analysis. If as Olett observes, Maharashtri observes a different pattern for word boundaries and prosodic metrics in constructing the ‘ verse –feet (= Paada)’, and these are not considered linguistically / phonologically ‘ irrelevant ( and have been taught so in earlier period ), then the ‘gana-analysis’ or the ‘ word-boundary analysis’ followed in this entire thread of discussions would be abinitio out of alignment with the original design and practice of ‘ Aryaa – Gitikaa’.

This issue ( apart from several other ‘ Bhoota Vaidya analysis of the tender jasmine like ‘Arya meter’ presented in the article) needs closer attention and review! . 





6. Last but not the least: ‘Maatraa’ count is a combine of ‘ CV/ VC combinations, Stress , Accent, Phonological mora, the singers choice to align and adjust the syllable length to the pleasure of tune and ears, and has over riding contexts of language, language grammar, local dialect, the ‘ranga-prayoga’ ( as in Dhruvaa Ganas) which Abhinvagupta makes a detailed presentation in his commentary on Natya shastra. This also needs be looked at more closely to understand the ‘ Measure of Aesthetics – By Ear sensing the time –durations and Mind grasping the meaning of the composiiton’, both of which stand beyond the scripted notation to which the lines and half moon symbols are juggled around.

The 12-18-12-15 condition alone is insufficient for āryā. There would be no perceptible rhythm if this were the only condition. The rhythm comes from the compulsory division of the verse into chunks of 4 mātrās (chaturmātrāgaṇa-s), which Prof. Kannan has intuitively identified. This would be familiar to the scholars here. I am only posting it because there seems to be no description of āryā's constraints available on the internet.The lakṣana from[vṛttaratnākara](https://sa.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0):
