Dear Prof Deshpande,  
  

Consider the very definitional verse you have provided.  

The *caesura* at every 4 mātrā-s is evident:  
*  
*

*yasyāḥ  
*

*pāde  
*

*prathame  
  
*

*dvādaśa  
*

*mātrās  
*

*tathā tṛ  
*

*tīye  
*

*(pi)*  

etc.  
  

You will see that there is no rupture at the 4th *mātrā* item.  
  

That way,  
*āryabhaṭīyam viditam*  

would be fine as the 1st or the 3rd *pāda*,  
with the scansion (in terms of 4-*mātrā* units) like this:  
  

*āryabha  
*

*ṭīyam  
*

*viditam  
*

  

But in *āryabhaṭṭiyam* as the first word this does not happen:  

*āryabhaṭ* =**5**  

*ṭīyam* =4.  
  

I am yet to come across an *āryā* verse where the (instinctive) rule I state has not been followed. Will be thankful if you can spot such a verse.  
  

Regards
