For the reasons that have been shown already - namely the requirement of units of 4 *mātrā*-s -***āryabhaṭṭīyam* cannot be the first word in an *āryā* verse**. **It can only be *āryabhaṭīyam*.**

  

That was precisely the nature of violation in Prof. Madhav Deshpande's composition. It could figure elsewhere in an *āryā* without any violation, as for example shown in my composition.
