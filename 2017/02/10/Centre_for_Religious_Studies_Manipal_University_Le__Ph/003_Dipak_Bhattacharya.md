Dear Veernarayanji,  

I should state that I immensely enjoy your mails enjoy your mails,but you rarely post mails.  

May I request you to send your valuable more frequently?  

Incidentally, I am preparing a lecture on pre-Classical grammatical tradition in India. If you are interested I will send a pdf of the unpublished paper to you  

Yours  

Dipak Bhattacharya
