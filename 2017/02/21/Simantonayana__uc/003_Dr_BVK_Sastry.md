(In the context of Samskaras : Seemantonnayana on another thread)



I am starting this as a new thread on specific Vedic Samskara : Upanayana and Vedarambha. This is a ‘Dharma-Shaastra –Practice related issue with a current social relevance and needs practicing – scholars input.



**Question/s :** **How exactly to portray the distinction between ‘ Upanayana’ and ‘Vedarambha’ for Current Hindu Communities ? **

** Which one is optional before ‘Vivaha’
for ‘ Brahmanas’ who come in as a minority miniscule component of ‘ Hindus at large’? **

** How is the distinction between these two ( and following two more before Vivaha) being observed in the narrow band of ‘Brahmana Vaidika Communities’ ? **

****

**Why this question**: Some Dharma Shaastra texts deal with these two Samskaras in a combined way ; Some deal with this as two independent
sequential – time separated – Family specific choice Samskaras.



 Over a period of time the numeric count of Samskaras have varied from 48 to 16 to12, with some critical overlaps in ‘ ritual , cultural and social understanding’. Specifically the ‘ Vidyarambha ( Samskara before Upanayana) and Vedaramha ( Post Upanayana). In the current socio-cultural milieu observed as ‘ Religion –Culture –Community practices, Rites of Passage ( using the Abrahamic model of terms from theology) does not help to get a clarity on the position provided in Dharma Shastras.



**Reason for the question:** **In current Social practice,**
different institutions, Mandirs and ‘ Guru –Guidance’ resources bundle up the ‘ Vaidika –Samskaras’ taking out the ‘ Specificities of
Prescription made in the resource original texts’. Under the generic name of ‘ Hindu Samskaras’ the precision and clarity of the ‘Samskaras’ are made in to fuzzy practice of ‘Religion practices and profession, Professional services’ all over the globe. No doubt this is a money spinning portfolio for many non-profit institutions. But that does not absolve such practices and advocates of such practices from the charge of ‘ unwarranted, unauthorized Meddling with the Vaidika Dharma Shastras’ and use them for ‘ convenience of misguiding the faith community’ .



One can verify the grit of this statement by exploring the explanations provided for the Samksaras in several major institutions as ‘ brand –proprietary administration of Vedic services’.

**Current Social Relevance: ******The issue has come to be a critical debate point, on the ‘ Steps to be incorporated in the
Conduct of Marriage in Brahmana communities’ . So much so that some Hindu Brahmana marriages are allowed / forced to be conducted with ‘ lesser number of Sapta-Padi’ vedic commitments; and some times even without it, giving preference only to the tying of the ‘ mangala sutram’ ? .



 The choice of what the couple prefer out of the ‘Sapta-padi’ vows is becoming a la carte menu card selection passed on to the marriage officiator - ‘ Purohita’.



 This is where the very fundamental bedrock of the ‘Sacredness and Vedic covenant of Hindu Marriage’ is under erosion. The commitment of marriage –partners to Vedic Covenant is integrally connected to the
previous commitments emanating from ‘Upanayana and Vedarambha’. These are issues that fall out of the ‘Secular Court Proceedings ‘ and ‘Academic Religion Research writings on ‘How they Practiced in a bygone historic era’. The issue is What to do now? And relevance of continuity claim of Vedic Tradition and Identity. 



Thanks in advance for scholars help in this matter.
