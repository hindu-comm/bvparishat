respected scholars,

namasthe..

when i read about *kusa* grass in the internet, i had gone through with this information as:

  

**In the Simantonayana** **or hair-parting ceremony, the pregnant woman's hair is parted centrally from her forehead to her crown with three stalks of kusha grass tied together, while the[*Gayatri Mantra*](http://www.gurjari.net/ico/Mystica/html/gayatri_mantra.htm)is recited.**  

**  
**

these are the queries i wanted to get info**  
**

  

here why this hair parting of a pregnant woman?

  

and what is the purpose of using*kusa*grass?

  

i will be grateful for your reply.

  

thanks in advance

  

sreelatha
