From a mimaaMsaa point of view when a dRshTaphala is there, the same is offered. If not anadRshTaphala apUrva is offered.

  

For instance, in बर्हिषि रजतं न देयम् (silver may not be given in a Yajna), the reason given is that Yajamaana would lose wealth and therefore cries (सोरोदीत्).

  

However in व्रीहीनवहन्ति (he pounds the grain, \[in order to prepare flour for puroDAsha\]), a question is asked as to why husk should not be removed using another method, say, using nails. The answer is apUrva.

  

Similarly in the present context, if it is a vidhivaakya it is to be followed - no other reason is required.

Senani
