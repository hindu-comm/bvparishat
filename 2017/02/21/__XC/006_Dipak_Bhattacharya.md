Dear Veernarayanji,  

1.001.08a rā^(’)jantam adhvarā^(’)ṇãṃ  
1.001.08b gopā^(’)m r̥tásya dī^(’)divim  
1.001.08c várdhamānaṃ suvé dáme

The reconstruction is conjectural; it does not give sense to us because we are used to read sve as sve. But one may note that the metre demands that there should be eight akÀaras, G¡yatr¢ having eight syllables.

There is a difference between classical and Vedic metre. In Classical Sanskrit the aksaras or sandhied syllables are never further resolved – kva s£ryaprabhavo... has to be read as kva s£ryaprabhavo and not as
kuva..s£ria.... The Rgveda represents an older way of pronouncing according to metre that was later lost.
