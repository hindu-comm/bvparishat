Srinivasji,

  

This is not a direct reply to your query. Still, I hope this will be useful to you.  

The text you are using contains typos. In the place of सरिद्विरज झ्षकन्यकाभ्याम्, the actual text is सरिद्विराजज्झषकन्यकाभ्याम्.  

It would save your time if you make use of a flawless text, possibly from printed book.

  

The complete text and translation of Gurupadukastotra is provided in Sringeri Vidya Bharati Foundations's journal 1.3. Though this stotra is popularly attributed to Adi Sankara, as per the information given in this journal, this stotra was composed by Sri Sachchidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Swami of Sringeri. The order of verses also seems different.

Any additional information about the authorship and change in verse order will be highly appreciated.



regards  
shankara
