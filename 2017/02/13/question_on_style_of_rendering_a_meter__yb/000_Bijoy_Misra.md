Dear friends,

  

The discussion on the Arya meter in the other thread was quite

provocative to experiment how we may use time measures in

rendering. I have always thought that there is an element of

poetic expression in rendering which is built in our sound

conversion process. From this point of view I wold think that

aमात्रा would not be a frozen entity in recitation but could carry

a variation in expressing the thought in a sentence. Research

on this would need high order sensing which should be attempted.

  

I have a poetry question which might have been researched.

Poets like Valmiki use theअनुष्टुभ् meter to create different

रस through the process of their composition. Prof Deshpande  

tried that in his dialog composition between Sita and Ravana.

The question is if there is work that studies use of a meter

to help create different emotions. Vedic Gayatri might have also

similar renditions. 

  

I put a new thread on the topic for eliciting comments and

information.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

  

PS. Yes, we are buried in snow here. Are there examples

of seasonal variations rendered through a meter?
