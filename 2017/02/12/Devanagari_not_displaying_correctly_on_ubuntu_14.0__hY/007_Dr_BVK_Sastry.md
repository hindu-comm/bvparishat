Namaste



On the observations, I have a lingering issue and desire to share it on the forum. Do we have a home team really desiring and willing to do what it takes to develop a ‘Samskruth Language Appropriate Technology’ ?



My observations ( -personal opinion with the simple question: What is the action plan to achieve the goal covered by the statement : Sanskrit is best suited language for computers’.)

:



1. \< I prefer the Ubuntu's native keyboard support such as ibus with Harvard-Kyoto/ itrans. \> Here the Non-English USER ( and in the context, the Devanagari Sanskrit script character in-putter to the document), is re-adjusting the ‘Language Related Mindset’ to the ‘Techno-Linguist Provided layout and conveniences’.



2\. On \< Moreover, being used to qwerty keyboard, my fingers don't have to learn the new keyboard layout. > 



First one is Sellers offer to make ‘Devanagari run on given Anglicized Keyboard layout’.



Second one is Native Language users reluctance to change from the addictive convenience of typing ‘Devanagari through English’.



The Font setting, Browser issues are related further down the line which are band-aid patches, and the like are the price being paid for not addressing the primary issue hidden in the 80’s statement: Sanskrit is best suited language for computers’.



Till the ‘ native language community users mindset related to ‘Devanagari Language working on the ‘ lent comforts by roman script based technology’, the Samskruth Language Appropriate Technology will not find an opportunity to evolve and develop, beyond these ‘ patch-solutions’.





Look forward for those members who have a passion for Samskruth- Technology.
