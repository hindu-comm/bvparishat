This is precisely why I restricted my answer to the context of my current needs. Perhaps, it would be the same for those who are already trained in typing \*only\* on qwerty. There is a certain bias most of us have when it comes to something one is already comfortable with, needless to mention if one is even good at, which is a bias against learning something new.

I did read through your post more than once and since I am inline with your thinking at most places, I shall stick to the above sentence which is like a संग्रहवाक्य. However, I would like to say that exploiting the computer-friendliness of the language cannot be divorced from language and script learning which needs to be followed as a कर्तव्यता right from school level. IMHO, it is unfortunate that most of our states have \*only\* regional language scripts for Shrutis, Smritis, other scriptures and classical works. That should also change in favour of Devanagari, else the English-script will be replaced by a regional script.

  

On a related note, we were asked by an ashram to declare on the govt census-sheet that our mother-tongue is Sanskrit and not a regional language, so that the language is preserved by pushing the govt to focus more on Sanskrit, via TV programmes, etc, and stop it from becoming a classical language. More such things need to be done.

  

Kind rgds,
