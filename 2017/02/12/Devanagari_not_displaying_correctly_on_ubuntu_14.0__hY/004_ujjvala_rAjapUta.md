I don't see what the problem really is. Ubuntu comes with the INSRIPT layout which I think is the best way to type using the standard keyboard.  
Also, there are keyboards using which one can type क by pressing 'k' and ल by 'l', प by 'p', etc. But I won't recommend these "phonetic" layouts if you want to type devanagari for long time. The default Gedit text editor also works.
