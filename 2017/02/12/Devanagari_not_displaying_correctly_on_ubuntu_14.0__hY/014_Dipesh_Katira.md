I write in Gujarati as well as in Devanagari. In my ubuntu 14.04 LTS text entry settings I get an option to select inscript Gujarati but in Hindi, Marathi or Sanskrit where Devanagari is used, options such as KaGaPa, WX, Bolnagri etc. are only available. I want to use inscript devanagari. Please guide.
