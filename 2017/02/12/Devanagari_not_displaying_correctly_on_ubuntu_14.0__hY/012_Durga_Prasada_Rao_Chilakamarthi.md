Hi,

  

Regarding the queries on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, i recommend to reach out to Ubuntu forums 'Ask Ubuntu' you should be getting immediate help.

  

<https://askubuntu.com/?_ga=1.144511356.839751567.1483007250>  

  

  

Alternatively you can take recommendation from forum if this issue is resolved in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS which is the latest Long Term Support version.

  

Please let me know in case any additional details are required.
