To be fair, dhaval's emails tend to be of the announcement-type, which don't necessarily expect an acknowledgement. Contrast with queries such as <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sanskrit-programmers/REazkGofPCE> , where a response is expected and needed. So, the list is far from dead.

Oh! That sounds so tiresome. Hope you succeed.
