I dont know about reincarnation, per se, but cyclic creation and destruction are referred to in the Rig Veda 10.190.3 -  

  

सूर्याचन्द्रमसौ धाता यथापूर्वमकल्पयत \|  

  

The traditional interpretation of this is that the sun and moon have been created by the creator as before (i.e. in the previous creation cycle).

  

The indological interpretation simply says that the sun and the moon were created one after the other.
