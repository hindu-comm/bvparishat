It is western Indological method to say that the divine in the Veda is modeled on the basis of the human reality 'known' to the 'composers' of the mantras.

  

What is the human reality on the basis of which the rebirth of the 'sacrificed' Purusha in the Purusha Sukta could have been modeled?

  

Is Purusha Sukta an evidence for human sacrifice? They do not take even a moment to say, 'yes'.

  

Is Purusha Sukta an evidence for the idea of rebirth?

  

                                
---------------------------------------

  

Wherefrom did the idea of rebirth enter at least Upanishadic Brahmana / Aranyaka texts ?

  

'Some local tribe outside the Vedic community'.

  

Language of these outside the Vedic community tribes can form substratum in the Rigvedic language. Somehow only ideas such as rebirth of the same communities refuse to form a substratum of ideas of the Rigveda.
