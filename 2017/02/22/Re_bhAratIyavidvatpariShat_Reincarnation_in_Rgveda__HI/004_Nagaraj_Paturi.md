The following were found quoted in some articles:

  

Within the*Rig Veda,*there is a lovely funeral mantra that states:

***āta etu mana punah kratve dakshāya jīvase,***

***Jyok ca sūryam drishe*.**Rig Veda 10.4.57.4

“May your spirit return again, to perform pure acts for exercising strength, and to live long to see the sun.”

While reincarnation is not specifically mentioned in this rik (verse), it is quite obvious that as a funeral rite, this would be referring to reincarnation.Likewise, in the*Yajur Veda (Shukla)*there is a much more direct reference to reincarnation.This verse states:

***savitāte shridebhyah prthivyām lokamicchatu,***

***tasmai yujyantAmustriyāh****.Yajur Veda 35.2*

“*The sun God grants bodies in different births, according to your deeds, providing a happy or unhappy place on this earth.May radiant beams prove helpful to you*.”





Ṛgveda 3.1.20-21 "The knower of birth is hidden in every birth" (janmañ-janman nihito jātavedāḥ).
