I am curious as to why the 12 verses of RV 10.58 are never referenced in these academic discussions about Rgvedic origins or otherwise of return to another life after death.

  

yat te yamaM vaivasvataM mano jagAma dUrakam \| tatta A vartayamasIha kshayAya jIvase \|\|

... ... ...

yat te bhUtaM can bhavyaM ca mano .... kshayAya jIvase \|\|

  

Clearly, in these mantras, there is an entreaty by the survivor(s), asking the departed one to return to life here. The prayer wouldn't make sense if it weren't already a given that the dead can return.

  

Yes, there is the back story given by Sayana for this hymn, about the resuscitation of subandhu gaupAyana after his death. However, if the dead can potentially return to the same body, is it too much of a stretch to allow the possibility for the dead to return to a different body? Is there anything internal to the Rgveda that would rule it out? Also, I would think that to set it aside saying that the 10th maNDala of the Rgveda is a late book would be simply begging this question.

  

Regards,

Vidyasankar
