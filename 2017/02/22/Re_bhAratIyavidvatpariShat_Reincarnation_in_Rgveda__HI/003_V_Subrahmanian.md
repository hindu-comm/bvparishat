The very karmakāṇḍa of the Veda is full of injunctions that are aimed at attaining other worlds after death: 'अग्निहोत्रं जुहुयात् स्वर्गकामः' । । 'ज्योतिष्टोमेनस्वर्गकामो यजेत' । The Purvamimamsa admits that the jiva is different from the body for the yāga performed with this body here will give the bhoga phala in another world in another body. Their philosophy as stated by Shankara in the Vedanta is: by not performing both kāmya and niṣiddha one will not get rebirth. By adhering to vihita one will not earn pratyavāya. By this one will exhaust all past karma in this life and will cease to be born henceforth. So, they accept rebirth.

  

This verse, based on a smriti, paraphrased in the Naishkarmya siddhi, says:

  

“शुभैराप्नोति देवत्वं निषिद्धैर्नारकीं तनुम् ।

उभाभ्यां पुण्यपापाभ्यां मानुष्यं लभतेऽवशः” ।। (नै.सि.१.४१)

  

by meritorious action one attains devatva, by prohibited action lowly bodies for suffering and by a balanced combination one attains human body.

  

कर्मणा पितृलोकः' इति श्रुतेः  by karma (without upasana combined) one attains pitr loka.
