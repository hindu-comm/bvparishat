Dear Vidwan Sri Ramchander Deekonda garu,

  

Benedictions / wishes need not necessarily be in the imperative mood with a second person subject.

  

Many a time, third person statements are used metaphorically as wish/ blessing/ benediction/ curse expressions.

  

This is one of those.

  

Purusha , here is the Purusha , Person, the Chaitanya residing in all beings.

  

The line has two levels of meaning : 1. contextual, suitable to the ritual in which it is used. (Vajapeya )

  

2\. general, context - free meaning : It has a measure of hundred. The person has a hundred years of longevity and hundred indriyas. (In fact,) it is the aayushya itself which is established in the indriyas. (That is why booth are hundred in measure).

  

As a benediction, it just means 'may this hundred years of longevity (of the Purusha ) be to the person receiving this benediction. .
