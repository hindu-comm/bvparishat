Respected Shriman Subramanian and other vidvAns,

  

The speaker Shri Suryanarayana Murthy, in the video does not explain the benediction completely. He simply elaborates on the figurative meaning of sentence "*zatamAnam bhavati".*  
  

My humble enquiry is (1) if it is a benediction it must be in second person (*bhava*). Here in this mantra the blessing is in third person (*bhavati*). Why third person, when the "blessed and the blesser" are face to face. (3) And, who is this *puruSa* who has hundred *indriya*s and is hundred years old.

  

Since this benediction is routinely bestowed in this part of the country (Telangana and Andhra), many sanskrit lovers have developed a sort of *jijNAsa* to understand its meaning Scholars may please help us appreciate the mantra.

  

dhanyo'smi
