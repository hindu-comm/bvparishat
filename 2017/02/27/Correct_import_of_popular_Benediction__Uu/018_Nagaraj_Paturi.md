२०.२.२ सर्वस्तोमेनातिरात्रेण बुभूषन्यजेत सर्वस्याप्त्यै सर्वस्य जित्यै सर्वं एवैतेनाप्नोति सर्वं जयति  

  

                                  
----पंचविंशब्राह्मणम्

  

is another such example.

  

Lines ending in sarvam jayati are found used as aas'eervachanas.

  

But the lines might have a different meaning in the context in which they originally occur.

  

But to use such lines as aas'eervachanas must in itself be from a tradition that had some justifiable foundations.
