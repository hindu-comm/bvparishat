Let me translate the SaayaNa Bhaashya quoted by AadaraNIya Sri V. Subrahmanianji connecting it to the points I made in my previous post.

  

I said:

  

The line has two levels of meaning : 1. contextual, suitable to the ritual in which it is used. (Vajapeya )

  

2\. general, context - free meaning : It has a measure of hundred. The person has a hundred years of longevity and hundred indriyas. (In fact,) it is the aayushya itself which is established in the indriyas. (That is why booth are hundred in measure).

  

SaayaNa Bhaashya provides the ritual context for the first sentence "It has a measure of hundred". What has a measure of hundred?

  

SaayaNa Bhaashya says 'Gold'. Gold is of hundred measures (units ) called Maana-s. One Maana = 1/20th of a p(r)aNa (another unit ).

  

Thus 1 paNa = 20 Maana-s

  

    5 paNa-s = 20X5 =100 Maana-s

  

thus s'atamaanam = 5 paNas

  

What gold? The gold required to be used in that ritual.  

  

There is a stuti of gold previous to these lines:

  

हिरण्यम् अध्य् अवरोहति । अमृतं वै हिरण्यम् ।  

  

Thus the line s'atamanam bhavati is saying that 5 paNas of gold is required for the ritual.

  

What is the significance of the number 100? i.e., why 100 maana-s ? Because the longevity of the person is 100 (years). Indriyas of the person too are 100; (5 karmendriyas + 5 jnanendriyas) X 10 naaDis (for each indriya). Each indriya works through 10 naaDis for 10 different functions. These 10 X 10 = 100 functions can be viewed as 100 indriyas.
