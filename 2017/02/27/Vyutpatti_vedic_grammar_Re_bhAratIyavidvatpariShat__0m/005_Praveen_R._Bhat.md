The above examples of doubling follow either from अचो रहाभ्याम् द्वे, (doubling of any consonant except हकार after रेफ or हकार, which is in turn preceded by a vowel) or अनचि च (doubling of any consonant except हकार, preceded by a vowel and not followed by a vowel). This is not limited to Vaidika usage. It can be heard in regular usage also. Most traditional chanters follow mandatory doubling and in regular usage, it is optional. In Gita chanting, you might hear traditional chanters chant अर्ज्जुन उवाच, for example.

  

Kind rgds,
