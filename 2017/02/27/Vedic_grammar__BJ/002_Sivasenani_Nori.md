Ashtadhyayi is the general grammar for "Vedic" Sanskrit \[1\]. At least two English translations - by S. C. Vasu and by Ramanatha Sharma - are available.

  

For specific SAkhas, the specific prAtiSAkhya is the recommended text. Not all prAtiSAkhyas have English translations.

\[1\] There is only one Sanskrit. This is the stance of Mimamsa, Nirukta and Vyakarana. That these are different languages was the speculation, initially by Western scholars, either in furtherance of the Imperial Project, or out of genuine confusion about what constitutes a language. For instance, those who see "Vedic" and Sanskrit as separate languages will see a number of Telugus, a number of Kannadas and at least more than a hundred Hindis.
