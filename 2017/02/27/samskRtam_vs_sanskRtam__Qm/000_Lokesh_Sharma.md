Please accept my humble obeisances.  

  

Thank You for my accepting me in the group. I am a student of Computer Science but due to my interest in ancient scriptures I am inspired in learning Sanskrit. Its been few months since I have started. Anyway coming to the topic, I want to know if the the dot inसंस्कृतम् stands for म् or न्. In other words is itसम्स्कृतम् or सन्स्कृतम् ?

  

धन्यवादः
