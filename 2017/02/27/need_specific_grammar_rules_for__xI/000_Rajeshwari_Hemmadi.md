Respected all,  
  

As I posted in my prev post that I am trying to read vAchaspatyam  
  

Can anyone guide me to the specific rule & details for the following...  

  
(1) पुत्र appearing as पुत्त्र  
(2) गर्ध appearing as गर्द्ध  

\(3\) ऊर्ध्व appearing as ऊर्द्ध or ऊर्द्ध्व too  
(4) कर्म appearing as कर्म्म .. but at times its with only one 'm' too

  

  

Please guide me  
  

Also any easy book where devanAgari script is used for this?  

  

regards
