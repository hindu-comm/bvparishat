28.2.17

Dear Veernarayanji,

Who should enlighten you? You are yourself a very great scholar.

But we have to note that the Vedic poet could not recite without metrical consistency.

Just one example:

Of *agniÅ p£rvebhir ¤Àibhir* and (b) *¢·yo n£tanair uta*

(a) has eight syllables and (b) has seven syllables. But the Vedic seer could not read defectively against rhythm when G¡yatr¢ should have an octosyllabic p¡da. So, it is presumed, that he read **¢·**iyo or** ¢½**iyo to make the recitation rhythmical.

Again 6.48.8b reads in the printed texts *tvám agne mânu****À¢¸¡****m*. We should have eight syllables instead of seven as in the printed text. To maintain the rhythm one has to read *tuvam* which, one can presume, was the original reading.

Best wishes Dipak Bhattacharya
