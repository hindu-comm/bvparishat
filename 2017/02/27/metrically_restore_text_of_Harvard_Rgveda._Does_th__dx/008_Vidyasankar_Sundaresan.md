Dear Prof. Pandurangi,

  

Back in 2012, this issue had come up for discussion on BVP, although the thread in which it appeared was about the current condition of BORI. I thought it would be pertinent to point that out here, via the link below. In the five years since, I haven't had reason to change my opinion that the supposedly restored text is an extreme force fitting of RV verses to conform strictly to syllable counts as per meter, leaving aside all other considerations pertinent to the orality of the text.

  

Also, I would assert that analysis of poetic meter would have definitely come only after the verse itself. There are any number of instances, even in the itihAsa-purANa texts, where verses challenge the constraints imposed by meter, yet the tradition has preserved them as such, without trying to "emend" them. e.g. mUDhagrAheNAtmano yat-pIDayA kriyate in the gItA or aparAjitas sarvasahaH and vinayojayas satyasandhaH in the sahasranAma, just to cite a couple of instances off the top of my head.

  

I don't see why a "metrically restored" version of such cases would be any improvement over the recited version preserved in the tradition. This would be even more the case for the veda than for smRti texts, in my opinion.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
