Sir, my problem is not to which reading we are used to. We are ready to give it up if it faulty. But which is the correct reading? How does tuvam happen in the place of tvam? Is tvam wrong at all in rgveda?  
Whether vedic rshis used tuvam really for the sake metre? Is it possible that someone uses wrong word for the sake of metre?. Normally we have seen people use correct words even if it breaks metre. Na vaa Elena aksharena is the nyaya.  
Is not modern reconstruction is purely an act of distortion?  
This is my problem. Pl. Enlighten me
