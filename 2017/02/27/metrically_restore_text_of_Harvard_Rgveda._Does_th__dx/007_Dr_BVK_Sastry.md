Namaste



On \< metrically restore text of Harvard Rgveda. Does this reading make any sense? >



1. It does not make sense. It is also offensive to the sensibilities held by the Time-Honored Indian Tradition on ‘Vedas’ for Centuries as a ‘ Sanatana Dharma’ and ‘ National Heritage’ resource .



2. A point of greater frustration is the ‘ benign silence, ignorance and indifference’ of Indian Veda- Communities, Academia and ‘ saffron- leadership – institutions’ which hold community wealth and money for the sole purpose of ‘ Guarding Dharma, Dharma resources, taking responsibility of Dharma – Texts preservation and education –practical’s. There is a ‘ internal break down’ due to the failure of
keeping proper vigil and take the right action in time in the appropriate magnitudes, on such ‘ root-cutting’ action. What is presented all the time, is the greater glory of Veda ( and its derivatives through Gita and other ‘religion model pooja vidhis at Hindu Mandirs’ with the unabashed use of ‘Vedic tradition’ for personal glorification, brand building and money-movements’ within the nation and beyond. 



3. The point to contemplate would be this: Why would any one in the classical tradition need ‘ such an edited text’ ? What use and purpose will it serve ? In other words, what is the damage control issue and action here ? And why would one inside of tradition want to ‘pass the authority of their won sacred text and tradition’ to an ‘alien interpretation’ ? and bear the consequences of the same to make a cry for ‘Battles’ ?? 





**4. Here is my line of reasoning ( and I wish someone proves to me that I am wrong. That helps me to keep my peace.) **:



The url referred to for this reasoning is : <http://liberalarts.utexas.edu/lrc/rigveda/index.php> . The methodology related passage from the web page reads as below:

This online text of the Rigveda derives from the highly important *Rig Veda: a Metrically Restored Text*, by Barend A. van Nooten and Gary B. Holland, published in 1994 by Harvard University Press; van Nooten and Holland's edition, as the first attempt to present the poems in their entirety in the poetic form in which they were composed, constituted a watershed in Rigvedic scholarship, but it has been out of print for several years. The preface of the printed book states (p. i) that the content was "in part derived from an incomplete electronic version of the Rig Veda produced at the University of Texas in 1970." (N.B. The Linguistics Research Center produced a *complete* electronic version of the text; decades ago, a copy was donated to the Oxford Text Archive.) Re: editing in this new online electronic version, outlined below, or Rigvedic language issues in general, contact [Karen Thomson](http://www.rigveda.co.uk/ "Karen Thomson's home page").

Our text here is based on the van Nooten & Holland electronic version (itself derived from the much earlier UT Linguistics Research Center electronic text), which was issued on a 3.5" diskette together with the printed book. A file on the diskette bore the notice:

**Copyright with the authors and Harvard Oriental Series. The electronic text may be used for research but not for commercial purposes.**





***Reasoning***



a) All the sacred guidelines held by Indian schools of Sanatana Dharma have been violated unilaterally in this exercise and presentation. The outcome is a tampered document of Vedic tradition.

 My understanding of Indian tradition on Vedas is given below. :



 - ‘ Veda / Rig-Veda’ to be a ‘Darshana’ where in there is no human intervention provision giving scope for a ‘ Metrical restoration’ using a ‘ human rhetoric audition standard.

 (Shuddha Patha does not necessarily mean manuscript compared text editing using arbitrary values for the authenticity of manuscripts, on the model of Greek and Latin related. ).



 - Veda is VOICE- PRIMARY tradition and scripting /Translation / historical reconstruction is NO WAY of working with the understanding of the veda.

 ( The resource is a SECONDARY DERIVATIVE publication, sidelining the VOICE-PRIMARY AND VOICE-PRIMACY Guideline.)



- The ‘Shadanga Vedanga Paddahti’ within which the ‘ Language and Metrical Structure related guidelines :: Vyakarana and Chandas’
used in preparing this ‘ Metrically Restored Text’ - were designed and meant for ‘ Understanding ( Vedaartha nirnaya), Practical Application (Viniyoga - Prayoga - Yajna Vidhi) and Meditation (Devataa upaasanaa). The texts of Kaatyayana and several others repeatedly endorse the integrity in approach and ‘ Don’t Tamper Veda’ warning. 

The present edition violates these text reconstruction edicts.



- Within Indian Traditional frame of understanding, there is NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OF VEDAS, NO AUTHOR FOR VEDAS, NO ELECTRONIC TEXT BASED ON TECHNO LINGUSITIC STANDARDS OF PHONEME- GRPAHEME MATCHING, WHICH HAVE INADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR SWARA (which are critical for Vedas). Those who prefer to stand by Sri Aurobindo for Veda – interpretation on a mystic plane may take a little time to read the original work by Sri Kapali Sastry - <https://archive.org/stream/99999990292408RigvedaSamhitaPart1/1990010087892%20-%20Rigb%20bhashya%20bhumika#page/n43/mode/2up> . The outcome titled *Rig Veda: a Metrically Restored Text*, by Barend A. van Nooten and Gary B. Holland, published in 1994 has several violations of traditional position. And as a corollary, the derivative text inherits the same defects.



The present edition seeks a ‘Copy Right’ Notice and institutional authority on the sacred text.



- The ‘ Important’ textual manuscript resource, to be fair, ( at the least to begin with ) would be and ‘ Shadanga Vedanga Tools for ‘ Veda- Mantra : Text construction-repair- restoration – Application’ , would be ‘Sayana Madhava’s Edition ( without the dress up provided by Professor. Maxmuller )



Maxmuller says:, in editing Sayana Bhashya with Rigveda Sanhita : ' This is what I should have done, if it had fallen to my lot to carry out the editio princepes of a Greek or Latin author, and what would have satisfied the claims of classical criticism' ( Preface - xxxi) - The sacred hymns of the Brahmanas: Together with the commentary of Sayanacharya - Edited by Maxmuller ( 1874)



The present edition inherits the same shortcomings charged on the ‘Transaltion and perspectives of colonial thinking provided in Maxmuller’s work’.
