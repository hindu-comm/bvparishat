Namaste



On \< We experiment on these occasionally through recitation with our Temple group in order to check the expressiveness of the composition.
>



My understanding: 



a) \<recitation> of a given ( Vedic or musical or poetic / Sanskrit or other language) aims three things:

- (a-1) Ease and pleasure of expression. ( Singer /Chanters
mind set)

- (a-2) Audience and Context ( Desire to get a sense of satisfaction / applause/ peer recognition / A compliance to a cultural tradition) ) 

- (a-3) Modifications introduced ( Improvisation or Tweaking of the text and process).



All these are permitted in ‘literature, music and dance’ where the goal is ‘ aesthetics ( personal experience of happiness/ glimpse of bliss :: rasa –anubhava).



It is true that \< tuvám> and \< tvám> do sound and sense differently to the \< metrically tuned ears and yard-stick of analytics> ; but does any one have a filter to say / identify / authenticate which one of these two is the ‘Darshana of the Rushi’ ? All other ways of using the given composition are off the table for this discussion. The deviant usages and constructions need to find their own justifications. We do see such arguments classified under ‘ Sampradaya bheda / Patha bheda’, when Human logic or Higher Logic can not be used; we stick to ‘History as the anchor of logic and proof’. This is a powerful argument used by the philologists , Word-usage –Statisticians , manuscript proofers in academia. Unfortuantely for these eams, Samskrutham is a langauge which does not squarely and smugly fit in to this block.



To give the classic case of debate to substantiate the issue, who amongst us \< saampratam, asmaasu \> can make a decision on whether there is/ was a ‘ hidden** **अ ‘ behind the famous ‘ Tat-Tvam – asi’ – the original text going back to hoary past ? Is this a line of argument for metrical reconstruction approach as some have worked on 23 /24 syllables of vishwamtira gayatri mantra ? Did the acharyas have ‘ Patha-bheda’ or ‘sampradaya –bheda’ or ‘ darshana-bheda’ or ‘Vyakhyana –bheda’ or ‘ phaloddeshya vidhana bheda’ ? Based on the ‘ Implicit Trust on the authenticity of the literal string of the text ( and the validation by grammar tool for understanding various meaning options)
there are schools and sampradayas originating and surviving. In other words, ‘darshanootha paramparaa’ has yielded place to ‘ darshana –vyaakhyaana /shaastra –shraddhaa’ and now it is moving to \< darshana –vyakhyaana interpreted as ‘ kaavya –sangeetha – loka geeta prathaa’.



b) \< Veda> by its definition and conceptualization is a ‘Vision’ (Darshana) of Truth (Satya- Dharma); and is a ‘Shruti ( Heard as a Musical Voice of Cosmos = Sukta) by a ‘ Rishi’ (also called a kavi).
The entire composition (Mantra- sukta) is aid to be a ‘ Holistic Vision and Transcendental audition / Heard’ without a ‘ human intellectual and emotional intervention.



 When ‘Veda’ comes to the point of \< application= Yaajnika Prayoga/ vidhi \> as a part of ritual, the goal is to achieve a pre-contemplated
benefit (Samkalapa siddhi). It is nothing to do with \< group recitation to check the expressiveness of the composition \>. 



c) Just because the word ‘kavi’ means a ‘ Rushi’ and also a ‘poet’, it does not mean ‘ Veda’ has to be downgraded and evaluated on the lines of \< local poetry, music composition where a DJ decides the taste and benefit \>. Poet as a ‘word-crafter for human literature generation’ is different from ‘ Poet = Kavi = Rushi’ who is ‘ Visions and Hears the Voice of the Cosmos’ ( Prakruti Vaak) through Yoga. At least, that is not the essence of tradition , as I am given to understand.

We experiment on these occasionally through recitation with our Temple group in order to check

the expressiveness of the composition. We reach the conclusion that there would be adjustment of

mAtrA in rendering in order to express. 

Here is an example.
