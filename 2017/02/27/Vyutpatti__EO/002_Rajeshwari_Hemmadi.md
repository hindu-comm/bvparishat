For example , names , nouns r specific.. I read somewhere "bharga" has bha-r-ga.. Where each letter points to verb & so attribute.. .. Even maatraas too have specific meaning..

  

As of now , at start ,this is my idea.. But will certainly value the guidance from esteemed & learned members of this beautiful forum.

  

Regards
