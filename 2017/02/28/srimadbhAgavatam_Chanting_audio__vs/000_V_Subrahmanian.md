Namaste

  

I am looking for buying or downloading any good rendering of the entire Srimadbhāgavatam in chanting mode, without any commentary. This is for a person who wants to learn the pārāyaṇam of the text. As a recorded resource will be helpful in this endeavor the request is made here to share details of any such audio. Preference is for a rendering by South Indians, male or female.

  

warm regards
