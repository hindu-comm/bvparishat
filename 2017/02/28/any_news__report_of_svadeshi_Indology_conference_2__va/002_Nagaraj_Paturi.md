**Infinity Foundation India**

Dear listfolk,



The second editionofthe Swadeshi IndologyConferenceSeries was held at theIGNCApremises,NewDelhion 17th, 18th and 19th February in collaboration withIGNCA. It was titled "GlobalPerceptionsofIndianHeritage"



Theconferencegot off to a great start with an inaugural function graced by the presenceofthe Union Minister for Law and Justice and Information Technology, Sri. Ravi Shankar Prasad and Rajya Sabha MP and BJP stalwart Sri. Subramanian Swamy.



This editionoftheConferenceseries was much larger in scope than the first one and had three parallel tracks. Continuing on the themeofcritiquing the Neo-Orientalist Schoolofthought led by Prof. Sheldon Pollock, this edition saw 10 theses put forward by Pollock countered.



There were 35 paper presentations on topics ranging from Rasa, Mimamsa, Chronology, Desacralisation with the maximum numberofpresentations being made on the topicofRasa.



Apart from these paper presentations, there was the robust refutation from the traditional scholars. The format is called***Vakyartha Sadas***and it is something that is conducted amongst traditional scholars in their own groupings but has gone outofthe larger public discourse. We were able to bring back this ancient tradition centre stage and it was a huge success. We will be continuing to engage with these scholars and will strive to make their voice heard in the larger mainstream discourse.*Vakyartha Sadas*, the traditional formof**Purvapaksha and Uttarapaksha debate will slowly be revived and restored to its rightful position as a scientific and rigorous formofdebate that has been the cornerstoneofour intellectual tradition.**



Theconferencesigned off with a valedictory function in which, awards for the best papers and two monographs (the outcome from SI-1). These were sponsored and given away by FICS (Foundation forIndianCivilisation Studies) run by Sri. Mohandas Pai.



The papers which won prizes were:



1. Prof. K Gopinath for his paper on Rasa titled "A computational Theory for Rasa"



2. Megh Kalyanasundaram and Manogna Sastry for their paper on Chronology titled "PurvapakshaofSheldon Pollock's useofChronology"



3. Nilesh Oak for his paper on Chronology titled "A cririqueofPollock's "self-evident claims" for the chronologyofMahabharata and Ramayana AND Assertion for the datingofMahabharata and Ramayana events based on the internal astronomy evidence"



4. Dr. Shrinivas Tilak for his paper on Mimamsa titled "Professor Sheldon Pollock on History in India: A critique from the perspectiveofMimamsa"



5. Sowmya Krishnapur for her paper in Sanskrit titled "Sheldon Pollock Pratipaditasya Vyakarana Sastra - Prabhutvayoha Sambandhasya Yuktiyuktatva Pariksha"



6. Subhodeep Mukhopadhyay for his paper on Sastra titled "Practice versus Theory: Ganita Sastra and Western Mathematics"



7. Sudarshan Therani for his paper on Philology titled "The ScienceofMeaning"



In addition to the above papers, awards were also given for the two papers from the first editionoftheconferenceseries that were turned into monographs. These monographs were released at theconferencein their draft form. It is a momentofpride for the movement that we have created a significant bodyofwork in such a short spanoftime. A draft versionofthe selected papers from SI-1 was also released at theconference.



Hence, asofnow, starting with TBFS, this movement has produced 4 books: TBFS, ProceedingsofSI-1, and two monographs. Soon, we will also have the proceedingsofSI-2 published. We will therefore have a solid bodyofwork in just over a year's time.



The monograph details are as follows:



1. Manjushree Hegde is the authorofthe monograph titled "PoliticsofSanskrit Studies: A Critical AppraisalofSheldon Pollock's Ramayana"



2. T M Narendran is the authorofthe monograph titled "A PariksaofSheldon Pollock's Three Dimensional Philology"



Congratulations to all the prize winners!



We will take a small breather but will soon announce plans for the nextconferenceofthe series.



Lastly, we have had excellent video coverage and the videos will be up sooner rather than later on all platforms.



Do look out for the upcoming fantastic videos from Si-2.



Regards,



TeamIFI
