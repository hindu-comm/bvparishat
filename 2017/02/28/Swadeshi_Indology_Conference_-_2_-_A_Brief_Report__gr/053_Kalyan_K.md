I see two opposite points of view on this list - those that defend traditional maThas and those that point out flaws in them.  
  
Irrespective of whatever is the real situation, one thing is for sure. The traditional maThas are no match for the Western universities in terms of their influence. Now whether this is due to the inherent problems with the maThas or whether this is due to the larger problems with the fragmented state of Hinduism or whether it is due to both reasons, is a debatable point.
