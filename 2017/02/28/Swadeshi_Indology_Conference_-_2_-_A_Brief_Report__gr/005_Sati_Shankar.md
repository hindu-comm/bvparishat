Respected vidvadjan,

In this whole of the Pollock associated endeavor, no work can be categorized as irrelevant or unwarranted.

The most pinching and painful incident to me has been what has been written in the first chapter of TBFS, where a stage had been set to sell off the world rights of Advaita Vedanta, in favor of Pollock. If our Mathas have no capability to judge what is right and wrong and evaluate their own decision and bias, forglitter or whatever incentive, I personally think, must not have the exclusive rights to represent the Tradition as a whole. Thanks to RajivJi and his painstaking selfless efforts that big damage has been averted.

  

For the rest, Padmashree to Pollock was a political or better say religiopolitical decision of the then Gov. of India, his acts Church and Left funded or whatever, he has his own intents. We should have our own to defend and promote our own the professional way.

Best wishes

SatiShankar
