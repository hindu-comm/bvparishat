This thread seems to have reached the stage of closure.

  

It is true that it all started with Prof. Pandurangi enquiring about SI-2 report.

  

There was an objection expressed towards targeting Prof. Pollock in SI-2. It was suggested that he should be appreciated. It was replied that producing counter-arguments to his appreciating only, though not admiring.

  

A separate thread was started on the issue with Prof. Pollock.

  

These two threads branched out into the issue of Sringeri Matha, Pollock and Sri Malhotra.

  

In the course of discussion, mathas and traditional Scholars were criticized severely badly. That was responded to equally strongly. A venerated ascetic traditional scholar member expressed his deep pain about the criticism of mathas and traditional scholars.

  

Contribution of mathas and traditional scholars and need to defend them was agreed by most including those who criticized them earlier.

  

Need to fight the attacks on our culture and traditions by a section of western Indologists was agreed upon by most of the participants. It was also suggested that SI series need not be viewed as the sole saviors or custodians, though their role need not be ignored too.

  

Shall we close the thread with this?
