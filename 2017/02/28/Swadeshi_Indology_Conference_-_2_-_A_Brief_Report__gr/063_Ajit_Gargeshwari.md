A detailed view later all I can say is this we now have a Purva Paksha and Maha Purvapaksha.  
  
This verse of Bhagavat Gita is not the motto of BVP. It is the signature line of the List Owner as per google group policy. This list belongs to members.  

  
atha cet tvam imam dharmyam  
 saṅgrāmam na kariṣyasi/  
tatas svakīrtim dharmam ca  
  
 hitvā pāpam avāpsyasi//  
  

I have my signature line and many do have their own.  
  
Before you take up intensive study of Mutts it would be a good idea to make one position clear. Is your only agenda anti pollock anti matha or matha reformation or picking up on the innocence of non English speaking traditional scholars or is there more. Do you represent cause of Sanskrit studies or are you the spokesperson of a book or organization that supports such books with its own agenda. Whats the organization real agenda? Is this organization a representation of Indian scholars or American Indian diaspora. That will help  
  

What survival and whose cost is it need to be clearly told. Are you talking about survival of Sanskrit traditional scholars, Mathas and Sanskrit research or are you talking about a hyped view an individual who in the disguise of good research has funded organization which in turn funding a disguised political ambition.  
  

If you are involving mathas in controversies you need to prove your stance. BVP list don't have as of now official representative of Mathas but have scholars who know the working of mathas from insider perspective. If you make attacks generalized in nature against traditional scholars and mathas thinking that only you should write
and conduct conferences bring out articles and books and they should listen as mute spectators that is another issue.  
  

An explicit statement giving your organization charter and the organization MOU and its commitment to research for Sanskrit and indology at large which will have an inclusive agenda would be useful.  
  

As I said more will follow  
  

Thank you
