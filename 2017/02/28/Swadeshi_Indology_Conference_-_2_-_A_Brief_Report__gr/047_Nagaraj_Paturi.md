Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

Thanks for your kind words.  

  

While I am with you in identifying a need to produce counter literature the one produced by a section of western Indologists who view the matter of their focus, i.e., India, Indian culture and Sanskrit, I am not able to go with you in your content and tone when you spoke of Mathas and traditional scholars.

  

Purport of your angry expression about Mathas seems to be that SI conferences, work and persons in their background are the only saviors of Sanskrit, Indian culture and India. May I remind you that but for the Mathas and their strong resistance to the trappings of modern academics and their methodology rooted in an alien culture, the 'original' Vedic, Sanskrit tradition that modern zealots claim to be/interested in saving, would have disappeared or lost its form that the modern defenders claim to be /interested in defending.

  

You are right. Sitting idle without conscious effort would not have produced Sankaras, Ramanujas, Madhvas and so on. But none of those walked into the methodological traps laid by their rivals, respondents or debate opponents.Each one of them stayed strongly posted in their foundations while saving the traditions that they devoutly followed and upheld. The force of resistance they needed in doing so is much smaller compared to the similar force required by the mathas during modern times because the pressures including the ones exemplified by your own angry expressions to walk into the traps of alien methodologies that are capable of uprooting the centuries old thoughts, reasoning techniques and their philosophical foundations.only a tree that stands still resisting the uprooting machines run by engines of millions of horse power knows the amount of 'activism' and 'conscious effort' required in doing so. Did they ever ask you 'do you know the amount of pressure we are withstanding, or did you ever experience the consequences of withstanding such pressures, the way you are asking them whether they ever heard of Prof. Pollock ? Your words such as 'the general incompetence, chronic laziness, bouts of loftiness and readiness to be sold out, or even eagerness to be bought off - of a good many of them.'
is a sweeping generalization filled with unhealthy vocabulary about traditional scholars. What good can a traditional scholar do to the person buying them when they do not want to and as such are seen as incapable of using the language or method in which the buyer wants them to defend him/her. At the most, you can a call a person not knowing English and as a result not understanding the bad English words used by the person's correspondent and taking it sometimes as even praise as an innocent, gullible person. But throwing abuses on such person for being that gullible or for resisting to learn English and speak back to the correspondent in the same kind of English, is not fair. I wish them greater strength in conserving their traditionality, originality and remain an eternal source of ideas, thoughts, reasoning techniques etc. Coming to our responsibility to counter the detractors of our tradition, what for those Vishvamitras taught us the astras if not to defend those rishis and their tapas?
