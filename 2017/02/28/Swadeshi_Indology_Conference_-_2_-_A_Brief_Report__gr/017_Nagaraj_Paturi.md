Prof. Kannan said on the other thread that "Many of our scholars too think that Westerners are doing us a favour by looking into our texts! "

  

I agree. Would like to add more.

  

1\. There is a mindset that can be called " love of locals for the tourists " . Locals feel grateful to the tourists for considering their place as worthy of touring. They innocently consider all the tourists to their place to be the admirers or more, the lovers of their place, without critically analyzing the motives of each of the tourists.

  

2\. There is another mindset that can be called ' love of the mother tongue speaker of a language for the learner/ second language speaker of the language". The mother tongue speaker looks at the learner/speaker with an affectionate, pampering smile forgiving all the mistakes, accent or stress problems etc.of the learner/speaker. He feels grateful to the learner /speaker for having considered his language worthy of learning, without critically analyzing the motives of each of the learner.
