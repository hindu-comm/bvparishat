Dear Vidyasankar Ji,

I do accept that I have never made a survey, even to get a small sample to analyze whether our Mathas have necessary value judgment. I do trust that most of them, and more importantly, "us", have been having it, that is why our tradition has survived more than a thousand years of continued denouncement, shocks and damages.

I have been refraining from coming to these threads, just to not to lose my focus from the work I have at present, but we can not ignore that Rajiv Jihas invested more than two decades of his life and resources and this has been well documented and no one sensible can deny its impact. The instances he presents chronologically which is publicly available can only be challengedby the Matha in question, which they have not done so far to contradict or refute TBFS, to the best of my knowledge and information. The conclusion is, therefore, obvious.

It is said 'if you want to invent a bicycle, do not re-invent the wheel'. In researches we do rely on works, surveys, etc. already done and published, though critically and that we do.

I have written in my post/reply very clearly, "what pinched me", and since our tradition belongs to us all, we have right to "scrutinise" the functioning of various agents of the system of our tradition, for its own health and sustenance. And that I have done. Frankly, that is neither part of my current professional activity nor intended for near future.

  

Hope this makes my stand clear.

Regards

Sati Shankar
