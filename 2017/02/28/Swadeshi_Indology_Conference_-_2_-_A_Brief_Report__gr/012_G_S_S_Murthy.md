Dear Prof. Kannan and Prof. Paturi,

I have great regard for your scholarship and I regret I seem to have annoyed you. Prof. Paturi is right. I did mean that we need to appreciate Prof.Pollock for the way he is doing whatever he is doing. May be, he is indirectly helping us to raise our standards of studying our texts.

It is really a pity that my "5 Pollocks" remark is a flight of fancy. I would like it to happen some day.

I have said whatever I felt like saying and I do not intend to participate in this thread any further.

Thanks and warm regards,

Murthy
