Dear Scholars,

  

I think I have made my stand pretty clear.

  

Why should we be against Prof. Pollock or the sacred *maṭha*-s? I do not think we have to be against anybody.

  

Dr Vidyasankaran spoke of the *maṭha*-s in a particular strain. I do not know whether he is an official spokesperson of any *maṭha*. If he can express his views of *maṭha*-s, others too can : even Ajith Gargeswari can.

  

I am thankful to Dr Ajit for enlightening me about the Gītā verse as the signature line of the List Owner. My high regards for the List Owner to have chosen one of the best lines of the Gītā as the signature (or Oh, I should be rather so jealous of him!!). But I think all the members of the list respect that verse of the sacred text, which has supreme contemporary relevance as it had at all times.

  

My dream is very simple: If our civilisation survived, nay flourished, for a few thousand years, it still can do so by looking into its own original value-systems and genius. Indological work in the West, especially in the West, is constantly producing a contrary verdict. The elite of our country today are at a loss to handle this. Something must be done to rectify this.

  

I make some analysis. Others do theirs. I have nothing to suspect that Dr Ajit or Dr Vidyasankaran or anybody in the list have any doubt that all is not well with our heritage today, and something must be done for this; and primarily, that we all respect our heritage. I think this platform is for the expression of divergent opinions. Why should a single opinion rule?

  

(The List Owner asked for a report, and in deference to a person I respect, I gave the report. I was not keen on doing it by myself. when comments came, I had to respond. I did not start or trigger anything).

  

While listing out or analysing the various contributory factors, if I have hurt anybody in the process, it was purely unintended, and unfortunate. I do not think I have made any personal comment on any individual or institution. I do not believe in *ad hominem* attacks.

  

I respect Ajit as I do Vidyasankaran or Kalyan or Paturi or Sati Sankar or Venkatakrishna or others. It is another matter that we all differ on different issues.
