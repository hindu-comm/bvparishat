Our mathas know what they are doing and so does Sri. Rajivji. Lets us not keep discussing the same issues again and again. All scholars believe and do know how defend the views they publish. Its not that just one scholar knows all those who don't write don't know about issues. Awareness is fine this is an overdose of awareness. Lets wait for the proceedings to get published.
