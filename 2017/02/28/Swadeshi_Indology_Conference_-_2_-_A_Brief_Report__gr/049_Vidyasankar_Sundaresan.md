Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

I'm not a professor, just a Dr (PhD), but thank you for framing the larger issues in a way that makes it easier for me to respond to the numerous concerns raised by other respondents in this and the related thread. I'll briefly address the specifics of the situation with respect to Sringeri Matha and then move to general observations.

  

1\. Not responding to the allegations made in Rajiv Malhotra's book, TBFS - 

  

The Sringeri Acharya has advised the Matha's administrative officials, and the SVBF trustees who were thinking of funding a university chair, to hold back from responding to Rajiv Malhotra's allegations. To begin with, getting involved with this kind of fracas that has been thrust upon it is just not Sringeri's style. It is not becoming of their dignity. The dharma of a public institution like a maTha that supports a sannyAsin tradition has to reflect the dharma of a sannyAsin to be tulya-nindA-stuti. This unexpected nindA from a recent champion of dharma is therefore being taken in its stride. If people who \*should\* know better misunderstand the resulting non-response, well, the problem is theirs. And it is up to people like Mr. Malhotra to decide whether they should continue with their nindA of the Sringeri administration, using innuendo and making far-fetched allegations against people with whom they've interacted just two or three times, or to focus their energies on real problems.

  

It's funny. It is so easy for our people to dismiss an accusation against a Hindu institution/leader as being politically motivated when it is a contemporary political leader who makes it. The truth value of such a statements is automatically denied, even without investigation. However, the same people seem to have absolutely no qualms in believing an allegation against another institution/leader, when it is someone like Mr. Malhotra making it. I believe we should ask ourselves, what is a kshatriya, intellectual or otherwise, if he is not primarily a politician?

  

For what it is worth, I think that vidvAn-s like the members of this list should not only choose their kshatriya champions wisely, but should also be in a position to provide wise counsel to the kshatriya when he tries to overreach with his strength. All our purANa teachings, like the viSvAmitra-vasishTha account or the sahasrArjuna-jamadagni one, point to the pressing need of that brahma-kshatra balance. Sringeri's thinking is rather like vasishTha's, not like that of jamadagni's son. Rather than fighting against the kshatriya on his own terms, through conflict, they are sure that the kshatriya will go a long way before realizing that he is the one who needs vasishTha's certification and not the other way round. In the meantime, he may even pick unnecessary and ultimately meaningless fights with the brAhmaNa; that's his svabhAva. Perhaps this attitude seems shortsighted or even outdated to many of us today, but that is how it is. It will necessarily take a long time, but the Sringeri tradition has exhibited tremendous patience, for many centuries now.

  

A proposed Indian philosophy chair at Columbia University is a moot point now; it's just not going to happen. Those who are convinced that the Sringeri Matha people are ill-equipped to undertake something like this can rest easy. As for those who think that Sringeri Matha was somehow handing over authority to speak for the advaita tradition, to either Columbia university or to Prof. Pollock, they ultimately reveal only their ignorance of both the advaita tradition and the environment of the contemporary American university.

  

At the end of the day, it seems to me that the only mistake that the SVBF trustees in the USA did was to consult Mr. Rajiv Malhotra, in order to get his input BEFORE signing any agreements with or making any binding commitments to the university. Little did they realize that he would turn around and shoot at them instead, just to position his own written critique of a Columbia professor named Sheldon Pollock. My summary take on this is, yes, Sheldon Pollock's intellectual output needs critical analysis, but Mr. Malhotra had absolutely no need to frame his narrative the way he did, pretending to save the Sringeri Matha from itself. I am not going to comment on whether he is or is not the right person to do a critical scholarly analysis of Pollock. To me, it reveals more than a little callousness, that in his eagerness to lead a battle against Sheldon Pollock for saMskRta, a general who says he champions dharma would treat the people who hold together an ancient Hindu institution as just so much collateral damage. It should make everybody question his saMskRti.

  

2\. Capabilities and organization -

  

The Sringeri Matha does not have people doing public relations and media outreach. The Matha is located in a remote location, and deliberately so. Even with the reach and availability of modern technology, the Sringeri Acharyas are not in the habit of making phone calls to journalists or politicians, or sending personal emails and things like that. Adopting marketing and publicity strategies in the modern corporate style is pratiloma; it goes against the grain of that institution's culture. In today's world, we may wish that the situation should be otherwise, or that they should still hire people to do these jobs, but I would urge list members to remember that the current way of leading our lives, constantly connected to the external world through more than our physical senses, is not our time honored way. Nor is it the only or even the desirable way of doing things. This is especially important for a sannyAsin, whose dharma is to prefer being avRtta-cakshuH, rather than yielding to the parAnci-khAni tendency (cf. kaThopanishat).

  

Allowing a cable TV channel to broadcast specific Pujas and other events at the Sringeri temples or maintaining a website are concessions made to the wishes and expectations of contemporary followers. The Sringeri Acharyas, and therefore the administration too, prefer to apply modern technology for more meaningful goals than to market themselves or to defend themselves against accusations like what Mr. Malhotra has done. They operate and maintain one of the earliest solar energy generation units in India, which powers the daily needs of thousands of pilgrims, rather than demanding that the state of Karnataka make special electricity arrangements for their use. They prefer to use IT for executing projects like the hyperlinked e-text archive at <http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net>, the second edition of which was released just a few weeks ago. If people prefer to think that the Matha leadership is somehow naive or misinformed or ill-informed or that they are technological Luddites, well, that is just some more nindA, born out of ignorance, towards which Sringeri reacts with samatva-buddhi.

  

As a corollary to the above, if remoteness and perceived inaccessibility translate to obscurity, as Sri Kalyan describes it, then sure, yes, that is just the way it is. My response to this is that obscurity lies in the eyes of the beholder. The governor of Arunachal Pradesh recently commented that Indians today tend to know more about the United States than about the northeastern states of India. If that kind of willfully uninformed section of the Indian populace, which now has to take its cues about dharma from a USA based leader, is the audience to whom an institution like the Sringeri Matha is obscure, then so be it. I hope I don't have to belabor its past history or its present importance to the larger advaita vedAnta tradition, when it comes to members of this list.

  

3\. More general points -

  

I think contemporary Indian Hindu society is fundamentally mistaken in its expectations and its understanding of its own history and culture and institutions. Rather than expecting a sannyAsin organization to be active in the public domain, we should realize that the primary dharma of a sannyAsin is nivRtti, a reduction of rajoguNa. Our old sampradAyas are not organized like the Christian churches. Expecting a traditional maTha to mimic the Christian seminaries and theological colleges is fundamentally misplaced, in my view. Being vigilant over issues that impinge upon public society, conducting seminars and conferences on political, social and cultural issues, etc etc fall in the realm of the men and women of this world. It is pravRtti dharma, which is the domain of the men and women of this world, not the dharma of a sannyAsin who renounces this world or an institution that was born in the milieu of that separation of pravRtti and nivRtti. Rather than thinking that it is the maTha or the traditional paNDita that is failing our society, I think we should turn the issue around and realize that it is our changed society that has been failing our traditional maTha-s and paNDita-s, for more than a century now. I include myself as a member of this changed society in this general criticism as well, for my grandfather was an adhyApaka and a vyAkaraNa SiromaNi, whereas my degree is in a technology field and I am eloquent in English, making mistakes with saMskRta.

  

Finally, let us not forget that if the seminary and theological college model is what is necessary today, then we do have institutions that perform similar functions. All the newly established organizations, from the Ramakrishna Math, from a century ago, to the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, born a few decades ago, are waking up to that social and cultural need, through the various educational initiatives that they are putting in place. They are younger, without the onus of long history and custom, so they are better equipped to lead that kind of effort. If one is doubtful about how these new institutions relate to and connect with traditional institutions like the maTha-s, which are rooted in an older paradigm, I suggest that we should go and talk to a few experienced leaders of these newer institutions, or just to members of this list who are engaged with them in various productive and constructive ways. We are never going to have the kind of organization and control that the Christian West is used to, but all of these new institutions will clearly evolve and develop in uniquely Hindu ways. The heavy hand of the Indian government and the burden of an outdated colonial baggage that it has inherited needs urgent attention too. The detailed expertise for doing these things need not come from maThAdhipati-s, whether of the advaita tradition or the dvaita tradition or the rAmanandI tradition. It is up to people like us, and our children and grandchildren, whether we find solutions for these wider issues, whether we help our institutions flourish or whether treat them like collateral damage in some other endeavor of our own, the way Mr. Malhotra has recently done with respect to Sringeri.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
