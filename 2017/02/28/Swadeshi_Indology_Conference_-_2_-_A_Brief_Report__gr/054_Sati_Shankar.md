Respected Vidvadjana,

  

Words, words, and words, seldom to the point, just circling around 'a' pivot to attain a zero sum game. It is not my comment but an expression of my state of mind at this pointoftime and in this thread specifically.

  

I put a simple statement yesterday,  

" If there is something wrong in reporting (here in TBFS), ... it must be made explicit. With due respect and Honour to Sri Shankaracharya Ji and the body managing the affair, if what Mr.Rajiv Malhotra has written ...., is not correct then, I am afraid, it would damage (his) credibility. The same applies to the Matha if the otherwise is true. So credibility is at stake both sides."

  

I simply wanted to know the facts, One side has pleaded in its own secluded, and indirect way, theother sideis silentonfactual.

A common man wonders, where to go?

Regards

Sati Shankar
