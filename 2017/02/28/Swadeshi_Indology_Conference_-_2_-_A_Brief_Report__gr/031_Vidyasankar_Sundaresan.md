Dear Dr. Sati Shankar,

  

Indeed, Mr. Malhotra has done much and written much. I have even helped him with references and my own inputs when he wrote his earlier book, Indra's Net.

  

As for the chronology and instances described in TBFS, I suppose this is the time to let this list's members know the following. The Sringeri Matha administration and SVBF in the USA have not officially refuted his account of it with evidence from their side, only because the senior Sringeri Sankaracharya has instructed them not to do so. I have also largely kept silent because of this. Although I'm not an official representative, what I say online about that Matha seems to carry some authority in my readers' minds. Therefore, I have consciously restricted the nature and content of my responses as well, while the official Sringeri people have strictly followed the directive and have exercised tremendous restraint and discipline in keeping silent, knowing fully well that their silence is apt to be misunderstood.

  

What conclusion one draws from this is dependent upon what assumptions one makes about the people and institutions in question. However, please ask yourself, what purpose would be served if the Sringeri Matha's chief administrator and the US based trustees of SVBF make public their side of the discussions? Should the Sringeri Sankaracharya and the Matha officials grant ammunition to Mr. Malhotra's critics and enemies, by providing definitive proof of where Mr. Malhotra is wrong where they are concerned? What should be their higher dharma in this situation?

  

We live in rather strange times. Self-appointed gurus, calling themselves paramahamsas and yogis and what not, enjoy wonderful credibility, with people like Mr. Malhotra rushing to their defense when their behavior results in scandals and controversies. Meanwhile, the custodians of an ancient sannyAsa and vedAnta tradition, wedded to old-fashioned ways of dhArmika behavior, are dismissed willy-nilly and criticized in a cavalier fashion!

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
