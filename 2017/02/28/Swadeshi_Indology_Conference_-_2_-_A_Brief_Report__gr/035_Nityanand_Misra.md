Dear Bijoy Misra Ji

  

I have written similar things in the past about TBFS/SI-1. So I do not know why you say you are stunned. Malhotra has a chapter named Is Sheldon Pollock too big to be criticized in his book. I ask if Malhotra and Swadeshi Indology are too big to be criticized?

  

You say I participated in the first SI conference. That is not even the half-truth. I was not just a mere participant. With apologies to Prof. Kannan, I think I should now publicly state my exact role in SI-1 since it has been brought to the forum by Dr. Bijoy Misra. My role in SI-1 was twofold:

1\) I was one of the two anonymous reviewers for SI-1 and did a critical evaluation of all the paper submissions (in their raw/unedited format of course).

2\) I chaired a session on the three papers themed on Ramayana and presented closing remarks.

  

I must add that Malhotra is probably reluctant to admit this or unaware of this: in an email on his discussion group, he wrote that I was at SI-1 in some other capacity that he did not recall.

  

Having clarified that, I would say that as of now, I am sceptical (though not disillusioned) of the SI series, and my scepticism has increased over the last many months. Something tells me it should not take months and years to publish proceedings of a conference (usually proceedings are published before a conference starts, or soon after it ends). Something makes me suspicious if only selected papers presented at a conference are published (if some papers are not worth publishing, why were they invited for presentation in the first place). Something is amiss when the only account/report on a conference is its own official account, that too given when specifically asked for (in case of SI-2, by Dr. Pandurangi). I hope this clarifies my current position.



Lastly, while recognizing the fact that Malhotrahas motivated many scholars, let me state my view that he an activist but not a scholar. For this reason, I am unwilling to blindly accept all his claims in TBFS. In addition, TBFS is a motivational work and not an academic work. In fact, Malhotra himself admits on p. 404 of TBFS that the book is not intended to be *an academic book in the conventional sense*.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
