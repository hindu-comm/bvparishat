Dear Dr. Sati Shankar,

  

I find myself in a curious position of having to dismiss the dramatic narrative arc drawn in the first chapter of TBFS and yet granting that there is much in how Sheldon Pollock's output has been analyzed since then. It is rather like the imaginary tiger in a dream that has woken up our vidvajjnas to the crying need to speak for ourselves with our own voices.

  

As for whether or not our Mathas have the capability to judge right and wrong, I suggest finding out first-hand what their capabilities are, rather than relying on second hand reports of incidents narrated by people who are not deeply involved with the respective traditions. If my experience is any guide, I think you will be pleasantly surprised how well informed the young people (and even the old people) at these institutions are about all these issues, cutting across various sampradAyas, at least in southern India where I have some personal contacts. The traditional Indian Mathas are not ivory towers, divorced from the intellectual churn that is currently happening in the wider Indian society.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
