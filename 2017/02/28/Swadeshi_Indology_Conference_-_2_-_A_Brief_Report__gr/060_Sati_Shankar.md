Dear Shastri Ji,

If an expansion of words is the aim, I would prefer to keep silent as it is endless and useless.

A simple question, not only on the topic of this thread but on any, If we have a statement on which one is saying it is right, the other one is saying it is wrong. both positions are damaging not only to both sides but to all and we have to choose one. Don't we have a right to know which route is correct and should be chosen to follow??

  

We do a critical appraisal of a number of texts and statements, no matter Indian or not, do we need to establish an audit department or call CAG to pass a judgment?

  

Every academic or better say scholarly inquiry involves a method of value judgment which is accepted by all the sides, as we have been adopting in shastrarthas.

Do you find my inquisitive query like,

"So what is expected? An American model trails E-mail investigations and wash the ‘ dirty linen’ in the public and feed the frenzy of media? Typical of American Sensationalism in making warmth through scandal debate ?"

  

If someone is deceptive in claims or misguiding, thereno harm in following the modern investigation to know the truth. And it is practiced throughout the world including India.

Regards

SS
