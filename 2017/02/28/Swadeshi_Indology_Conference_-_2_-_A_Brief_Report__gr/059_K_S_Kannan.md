Dear scholars,

  

I am very sorry if I have given the feeling of abuse of anybody. It was **not my intention at all**. Let me try to clarify.

  

There is no doubt at all that our *maṭha*-s have put forth efforts to protect our tradition/heritage. As Prof . Paturi pointed out very well, but for that, *what would have been there for us to protect* now?

  

The only issue was that their *siddhānta*-s were shielded *only from* what we may perceive today as their *internal* (or shall we say domestic) adversaries - the *bauddha*, the *jaina*, the *cārvāka* etc.. We have all known of long standing disputes between rival *maṭha*-s within even particular sub-sects. If but a fraction of their energies was directed against the steamrolling external enemies - the invading faiths of peace and philosophies of mercy, the damage and loss could have been much less.

  

The ideal of *sāttvika-pravṛtti*, or even plain *nivṛtti,*is indeed commendable in itself, no doubt. But it is not as though the whole society had to adhere to the same. The premier role of *kṣattra* had always been to protect *brahma*. When *kṣattra* loses sight of its primary role, *brahma* can even**go round the earth and extirpate the defiant *kṣattra "*twentyone times*(tris-sapta-kṛtvaḥ)"*if needed*.*

*  
*

Where is life not a battle?

At the level of the body, you fight against illnesses.

At the level of the nation, you fight with foes whether they are *sahaja* or *kṛtrima*.

At the level of the intellect, you need *śrutyanugṛhīta-tarka* to fight*śruti-pratidvandvi-tarka.*

At the spiritual level, you need *sattvānuprāṇita-rajas* to fight *tamonunna-rajas.*

*  
*

And when did *kṣattra* function well, and at its finest, unguided by *brahma*? What could a Chandragupta do without a Kauṭalya? Or a Shivaji without a Samartha Ramadas-ji?

  

It is precisely here that the point lies. For whatever reason, the two did not intertwine properly - for centuries, in our country thus ignoring the dictum:

*nābrahma kṣattram ṛdhnoti*

*   nākṣattram brahma vardhate/*

*brahma kṣattram ca sampṛktam*

*   iha cāmutra vardhate//* (Manu)

a veritable golden *sūtra*.

  

When we are in a state of glory, we are apt to become lax and myopic. Sage Apastamba appropriately warns us about this danger of carefreeness and laxity in moments of joy. It is this state of languor, stupor, and torpor that we have to be much afraid of. We somehow did not pay heed to this, and hence our present sorry state of affairs.

  

Nobody expects the *maṭha*-s to directly involve in public debates. But they can surely have their public organisations who execute the jobs for them. Are not some *maṭha*-s running schools or hospitals? Have they ceased from all commercial activities? : Is no *maṭha* running a choultry or a community hall? Or are their schools/hospitals all doing free service? Are not some *maṭha*-s busy indulging in mud-slinging against their rival *maṭha*-s too?

  

To paint them all then with a single brush - as totally untainted by *rajaoguṇa -*may not tell the full truth.

  

Is it enough merely to preach, without implementation :

*pratyaham pratyavekṣeta naraś caritam ātmanaḥ* ? (Vālmīki)

Are we to eschew all introspection?

  

Willy nilly, we have to admit that they did lack certain strategies, and more importantly the vision and the perception needed to save our heritage. Had they not lacked, they would have surely inspired at least a small percentage of their own *pandit*-s, or scholars out there in public institutions at least, to study the philosophies and styles of functioning of their foes also, and come out with proper antidotes. And they would not have been accused of violating their essential dharma for that, or had had to feel guilty of straying from the righteous path. *Āpad-dharma*-s become vitally important in moments of *āpad-*s; they are precisely devised for those occasions. Adhering to *sāmānya-dharma* even in situations of *āpad* is no great wisdom; it is looking at things topsy-turvy.

  

Who is a man of widom? :

*āpadi sphurati prajñā yasya dhīras sa eva hi*!!

  

Have not Kaca, the son of Bṛhaspati (in our own*Purāna*-s), and Kumarila (in our own philosophical history), shown the way - of learning valuable things from the foes at moments of *āpad*? 

  

As a young boy I had heard an anecdote : when Alexander met Kauṭalya, the latter told the former he had changed his plans at the last moment. When the surprised Alexander asked him how did he come to know of that,
Kauṭalya shocked him saying that his (Alexander's) PA was an agent planted by him (Kauṭalya)!

  

Whether the story is true or not, it has a message: never ignore the enemy; study him well, rather! Somehow our *sāndhi-vigrahika*-s never bothered to realise the importance of learning the new brand warfare technology from the new brand foes - either in the physical battlefield or in the intellectual battlefield. There lies our tragedy : both *brahma* and *kṣattra* failed on some vital counts, though they were *honest and hard-working* on many other counts.

  

It is not enough to build temples; it is essential too to build an impregnable bulwark against the iconoclasts and marauders. Has anyone kept an account of how many temples were looted of how much of wealth?; of how much of our art was disfigured and destroyed and if not, looted to land in the West? of how many of our icons made as footsteps to mosques?; of how many Indian sepoys served our enemy forces - Muslim or British?

  

I am not speaking of politics; I am speaking only of survival. No entity can be impervious to, or be oblivious of, changing circumstances.

  

If our Indological studies are being monopolised by the West - and for over a century, we have to look into what is happening and what we must do. There is no need to blame them: two analogies suffice -

*śvā yadi kriyate rājā sa kim nāśnāty upānaham?*

and

*maṇinā bhūṣitas sarpaḥ kim asau na bhayaṅkaraḥ?*

  

We have to study them only to know what they do and how they do - only to take corrective measures required from our side. While not all of them can have evil intentions, some are definitely doing enough damage.

  

The first step, then, is to **take stock of** this - and this is where we have failed, and failed massively at that - **and then act** appropriately. We cannot wish away the enemies of our heritage, and tell ourselves "all is well with the world", and relapse into a lax life. Have we not been told by our wise predecessors:

*kriyā-samabhihāreṇa virādhyantam kṣameta kaḥ*? (Māgha)

and

*kṣamāvān niramarṣaś ca naiva strī, na punaḥ pumān*!! (Vyāsa)

  

Ought we to be servile even now, even after the colonialists have left? Or run away from the battle-field?:

*arjunasya pratijñe dve - na dainyam, na palāyanam.*

*  
*

  

Are we to acquiesce with the foe, and thus acquire nothing but infamy and demerit?

  

I am only reminded of **the glorious motto of BVParishat** - the words of Kṛsna himself to Arjuna :

*atha cet tvam imam dharmyam*

*   saṅgrāmam na kariṣyasi/*

*tatas svakīrtim dharmam ca*

*   hitvā pāpam avāpsyasi//*
