Dear Prof. Kannan

  

It is good to know that selected papers would be published in a few months time. However, may I ask why only selected papers and not all the papers that were invited for presentations? If cost is an issue, the remaining papers can be digitally published as PDFs. If time needed for editing is an issue, they can be published in their unedited form.

  

Or is the poor/questionable quality of many papers in SI-1 an issue? In my post below on impressions of SI-1 on this forum, I had said that a weakness of of SI-1 was that most presenters were young researchers without formal training in Indology and that their lack of academic experience and formal training in Indology/Sanskrit made them ill-equipped to make their response substantial: <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/coIVFJwUxhQ/WTP4QfhiBwAJ>

  

As an example the presentation onsacred philology in SI-1 was so extreme that I would call it a joke. I remember even Dr. Elst said that the paper did not deserve to be selected. But the fact is that it was selected, and it should be published in some form (digital/unedited/whatever). Why would you not publish it?

  

I get the feeling that there is a *veil of secrecy* around a conference series which is being touted as a historical and academic Indian intellectual response. Many months after the completion of SI-1, we have not even seen abstracts of the papers presented. Your report on SI-2 gives all details about dignitaries, prizes, etc, but is silent on content of the 35 papers. Could I request you to at least share the abstracts of the 35 papers that were presented?  

  

Thanks, Nityananda
