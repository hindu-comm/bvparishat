Dear Bijoy Mishra Ji

  

Thanks for the suggestion, but I would say let us wait for the proceedings of SI-1 and SI-2 to be published and made accessible. There were some papers in SI-1 on Ramayana: I do not know if they are a part of the selected papers that Prof. Kannan said he is editing and will be published. We can both then go through the reviews of Pollock's publications. If you still think that as aspect of Pollock's work is not sufficiently covered in the 2,500 pages, I would be happy to consider your suggestion. No point in reinventing the wheel.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
