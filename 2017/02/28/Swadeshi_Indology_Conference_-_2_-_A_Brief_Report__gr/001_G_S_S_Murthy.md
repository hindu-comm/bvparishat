Dear respected scholars,

I believe I am fully qualified to step in where angels fear to tread.I have no great scholarship in Sanskrit nor in Indology. I have neither read Pollock nor those who claim to be anti-Pollock. I might have marginally read about Pollock and those who oppose Pollock. Somehow to start or nurture a school of thought with the sole object of opposing Pollock does not appeal to my simple mind. There are so many diverse traditions of thought in Indian tradition that I believe a Pollock tradition will do no great harm. Let him say what he wants to say and let some follow him. If others have their own points of view let them say it and there will be their followers too. Why make a giant of a wind-mill?

Regards,

Murthy
