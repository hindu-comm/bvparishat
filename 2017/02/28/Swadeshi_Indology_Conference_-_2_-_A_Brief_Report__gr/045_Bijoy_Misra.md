Nityanandaji,

It appears that you have difficulty in identifying with the cause that SI

is advocating. When we appreciate the cause, the individual acts

could be overlooked. Please give some thinking if the cause has

merit. With your analytic background,your review of the cause would

be educational to many. If you discover that the cause has merit,

you might suggest how to proceed with the necessary activism.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
