Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

Someone shared video sometime back, of a lecture in Sanskrit, by HH Sri Bharati Tirtha Swamigalu, in which HH was cutting the "Death of Sanskrit" thesis in his own characteristic style. Probably someone brought to his notice that such a thesis is propounded by someone; he responded. He did not mention the name of Prof. Pollock. But who else, can we say, was being countered by him?

  

But let me tell you, the magnanimity of these tapasvis is such that they can forgive even such individuals and talk compassionately to them.

  

Once, an erstwhile traditional and traditionally trained Telugu professor, then proselytized into Marxist cult, was invited to speak in Shakarmath, Hyderabad, in the presence of Swamigal. He , as expected, spoke on misogyny in the S'aastras and so on. I countered him with a few words and said it is not proper for me to speak more in front of Swamigal. Swamigalu during his speech did not start with this issue. But covered this and countered naturally powerfully. But what brought me to tears was that he invited this Marxist first, spoke extremely affectionately and said, 'please keep good health'!
