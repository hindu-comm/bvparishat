Sri Kalyanji,

  

Diagnosis of 'whether this is due to the inherent problems with the maThas or whether this is due to the larger problems with the fragmented state of Hinduism or whether it is due to both reasons' is required if greater 'influence' than western universities is the goal aimed at by mathas and their 'inability' to reach that goal is regretted. Traditional mathas or those who rightly understand what they are, do not compare them with universities at all.

  

Universities are part of modern educational system limited in their scope to education in its modern form. The sphere of work for the maThas is not limited to education. 'Education' which is one of many activities of the maThas, is not modern but traditional.

  

An Indologist is to a traditional Sanskrit scholar what a cultural anthropologist is to the culture that he studies. Can we say, a cultural anthropologist is more influential than the community that he studies? 

  

The big difference between the cultural anthropologist -cultural community relation and the Indologist-traditional Sanskrit scholar relation is that the activity of the traditional Sanskrit scholar appears to be similar to that of the Indologist. This confusion is there among Indologists themselves too. Some of them began to call each other 'great naiyaayika', 'great meemaamaamsaka' also. An Indological researcher on Nyaaya is not a naiyaayika, just as an Indological researcher on Ayurveda can not be an Ayurvedic bhishak/vaidya.

  

Similarity between the research and the researched is leading to all the confusion.

  

Many Indologists get amazed at the depth , width, meticulousness and rigor in their subject matter i.e., traditional Sanskrit scholarship. In many of them, it lead to a respect towards their subject matter. In some, it lead to a jealousy born psychological disorders that are getting reflected in their apathetic attitude towards traditional Sanskrit scholarship, Sanskrit, Indian culture and India. We , who are trying to oppose that apathy too are not the traditional scholars, the subject matter of the Indologists. We, like the Indologists themselves belong to modern education and are trying to educate the ill-mannered colleagues to behave better.
