Dear Scholars,  

  

Here is a brief report of the conference.

  

The second Swadeshi Indology Conference (SI-2) was held on the **17th, 18th, and 19th of this month** (February 2017) at New Delhi.

  

The conference had **six components**: an inaugural function, a few plenary sessions, paper presentations,*Vakyārtha Sadas*sessions, release of monographs, and a valediction. Everything went on as planned, except that the sessions extended up to almost7.30 pmin the evenings, owing to extended discussions.

  

**IGNCA** (Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts) **played a key role** providing the venue (3 halls) as well as local hospitality and other benefactions.

  

In all, **35 papers** were presented on **ten themes**- in **three simultaneous tracks** in 3 halls; the topics pertained to the extraordinary claims of Prof. Sheldon Pollock, purporting consciously (or at best ostensibly unconsciously) to misinterpret our heritage.

  

**The focus on Pollock** (as with SI-1) **was on grounds of** his being the most influential scholar - in academic circles (also through his students who are well placed in celebrated academia), firstly, and secondly, in his reach on the general public, especially Indian (by virtue of his editorship in leading publishing houses); but even more importantly on grounds of the complex and complicated intellectual maze he has conjured, aimed at confounding and bamboozling the reading public by an ostentation of scholarship: in width, depth, or impact, or even the novelty of ideas or interpretations - in short, in terms of the **Neo-orientalism** he has sought to bring about in a copiously camouflaged and convoluted language - he has added new negative dimensions to Indology (and hence totally incomparable to some of the earlier Orientalist Indologists, the damage caused by whom pales into the background in quality and quantity). So much for the*raison d'être*of the themes of the conference.

  

**Inaugural Session**: The conference was inaugurated by Sri Ravishankar Prasad, the Hon'ble Minister for Law and Information. Dr Subramanian Swamy, Rajya Sabha MP, gave the key-note address. Prof R Vaidyanathan (Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore) and General GD Bakshi gave the Special Invitee addresses. Sri Rajiv Malhotra (Founder, Infinity Foundation) gave the Welcome Address, and Dr Sachchidananda Joshi, Member Secretary of IGNCA tendered a vote of thanks. Earlier, Dr Sudhir Lall of IGNCA, welcomed the guests onto the stage.

  

There were four **Plenary Sessions** - addressed by Prof R. Nagaswamy (renowned archaeologist), Ms Meenakshi Jain (Former Fellow, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library), Dr. Pappu Venugopala Rao, D Litt (reputed musicologist , dance theoretician, and*aṣṭāvadhānin*), and Dr Lokesh Chandra (President, Indian Council of Cultural Research, and Director, International Academy of Indian Culture).

  

There were **10 Academic Sessions**, presided over by 10 Chairpersons. Among them figure Padma Vibhushan Dr Sonal Mansingh (Trustee, IGNCA), Prof Korada Subrahmanyam (Centre for Applied Linguistics and Translation Studies), and Dr Amarjiv Lochan (Member, International Association for the History of Religions, and International Association of Sanskrit Studies)

  

Of the 35 papers presented, 4 were presented on skype, and one was a recorded video. Among some important participants were Dr Shrinivas Tilak from Canada, Dr. Koenraad Elst from Belgium,Dr.Naresh Cuntoor from USA, Dr. Charu Uppal from Sweden,*Śatāvadhānin*Dr. R Ganesh (independent scholar of repute) and Prof K Gopinath (of Indian Institute of Science) from Bangalore. Among the papers presented were 9 on the*Rasa*Theory, 6 on*Mīmāṁsā ,*and 5 on Buddhism; others were on other topics such as*Śāstra*, Philology and Desacralisation. 6 lady scholars also contributed papers. About 15 of the scholars were below40 years of age. Over 15 were from the fields of Science/Technology, but backed by a sound knowledge of Sanskrit. There were participants from half a dozen States of our country. A few papers were in Sanskrit.

  

A novel feature of the conference was **3 sessions of*Vākyārtha Sadas***. 3 young students trained by*Mahamahopādhyāya Brahmaśrī*Mani Dravida Sastrigal debated**in Sanskrit**in the traditional style of *śāstrārtha,*key themesgleaned from the theories of Sheldon Pollock. The purport of the discussions was presented in English at the end of each session.

  

**2 monographs** written by two young scholars were also released on the last day. While one was on Pollockian Philology, the other was on the politics of Sanskrit Studies.

  

The **Valedictory function** had an address by Dr Sachchidananda Joshi, Sri Rajiv Malhotra, Dr K Aravinda Rao (Trustee, IGNCA, and Member, Indian Council of Philosophical Research), Dr Sudhir Lall, and Prof K S Kannan (Academic Director).

  

**Best Paper Awards** of Rs.70,000/= each, instituted by Sri T V Mohandas Pai (academician and philanthropist of repute) of the Foundation for Indian Civilization Studies, were presented to 8 candidates.

  

A **Lifetime achievement Award** was conferred upon Dr. Nagaswamy.

  

**Publication** : A total of 5 volumes (including the 2 monographs released, and selected papers presented at the two conferences) would be published in a few months time. They are being edited by me.

  

**Prospect** : A conference on the Aryan-Dravidian Theorywith focus on Tamil Naduis being planned next, in the latter half of 2017. A Call for Papers will also be announced in the coming months.
