Thanks, Prof. Prasad Ji. By *both of you*, do you mean Dr. Vidyasankar Sundaresan and me?

  

Regarding my post on the other thread, I would not say I am *annoyed* for the past one year. It is just that I believe in high standards for non-fiction books. If claims made in a non-fiction book are questioned or called as misleading, the author has a responsibility to either defend the claims or admit his/her mistakes. This high-standard is not limited to TBFS alone, I made this point in my review of Devdutt Pattanaik's My Gita also (both TBFS and MG are non-fiction, and in both cases we have seen authors choosing not to answer specific questions). The standard I have is also reflected in the motto of this forum: नामूलं लिख्यते किञ्चित्.
