Dear Dr. Sati Shankar,

  

Sorry, if you had specified, "answer in 200 words or less," I would have reduced my word count.

I think the correct stance should be the following.

  

"If there is something wrong in the way the Sringeri Matha's administration was discussing with Columbia University, it should have been made explicit in TBFS. With due respect to Mr. Malhotra, there are words, words and more words, filled with innuendo and insinuations, casting aspersions on the integrity of the people in charge of making financial and decisions for the Matha. If Mr. Malhotra's readers want to question the credibility of the Sringeri Matha, they should question his own credibility too."

  

The reality is that the onus of proof is not on the Sringeri Matha administrator, Sri Gowrishankar, or the SVBF chairman, Dr. Yegnasubramanian, to prove Mr. Malhotra wrong. It is up to Mr. Malhotra to back up his allegations and innuendo with proof for his grandiose claim and conclusions about Columbia and Prof. Pollock being given carte blanche to speak for Advaita Vedanta in the United States.

Please ask Mr. Malhotra for substantive facts. I have clarified that I am not an official spokesman for Sringeri Matha, but I do know both the general manner of conduct there and some specific details about this whole Columbia chair issue. If I did hold an official position in the Sringeri administration, I would exercise much greater restraint than I am showing now and I would obey my Acharya's directive not to bother responding to these maddening allegations at all.

  

So, once again, to put it in as little words as possible, the official silence from the Sringeri side is because they have NO desire to damage Mr. Malhotra's credibility. They are willing to let people think what they may and say what they say.

  

Beyond this, you have to question the Matha within yourself whom you would rather believe.

  

On one side, you have Mr. Malhotra, with a history of easily making enemies out of possible friends/allies, due to his habit of making wild accusations against traditional scholars and institutions, without any proof. I would rather not mention names, but please do a Google search to find how he lashed out at a respected member of this very list, just last year.

  

On the other side, you have an institution that has not only had centuries of history and tradition behind it. Sringeri is also one of the select few religious institutions in India that has not seen even a single whiff of impropriety in its financial management in the last few decades, when it has been surrounded by political sharks waiting for the slightest opportunity to create problems for every Hindu religious institution.

  

Please pick your side. I believe I don't have anything else to add on this thread, so I'll keep mum over future responses.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
