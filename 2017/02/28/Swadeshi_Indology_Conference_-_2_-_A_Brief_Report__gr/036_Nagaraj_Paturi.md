(Apologies for repeating the above. But I thought good to remind after a gap of several posts)

  

3. This love turns into respect or even veneration if that tourist or language learner (in #1 & #2 above) turns out to be from the country / community / class that the local or mother tongue speaker(in #1 & #2 above) has respect for. In the present case, we Indians have respect for the westerners, partly due to colonial hang over, respect for 'developed countries' on account of our less 'developed' status. As a result, in the contexts under of 1 & 2 above, if the tourist or learner is from a western /'developed' country we look at that person with a venerative affection, without critically analyzing the attitude or motive of each of those persons.

  

This is about the general population.

  

Coming to the 'educated' , learned, academic 'locals', there are other factors that get added to these attitudes. 

  

4. For example, another factor that needs to be taken into account here is the advantages and weaknesses of both the insider and outsider researchers of cultures, languages etc. advantages of insider researcher are obvious. But weakness of an insider researcher is taking many aspects of his research focus for granted. It is exactly here that an outsider researcher has the advantage. He/she does not take any aspect of his/her focus for granted. His research , out of necessity, turns out to be more meticulous than the one by the insider. Culture insiders and insider researchers alike get amazed at this meticulousness and develop an awe for the outside researcher. An Indian researcher of western culture can create such an amazement among western culture insiders and vice versa. But if it is a western outside researcher, the factors of colonial hangover, and 'developed' status intensify the awe and amazement.

  

5. Another very important factor that works in the case of'educated' , learned, academic 'locals' is the current methodology of all contemporary academics having roots in western countries and cultures and that giving an advantage to westerners over others in giving an impression of greater (amazing ) rigor and greater meticulousness to the readers. This factor is a huge intensifier of awe and amazement towards a western outsider researcher's writing about say, an Indian language or culture.

  

The awe that we are able to see among Indian'educated' , learned, academic 'locals' for the western Indologists and western Sanskrit scholars has a combination of all the above aspects.
