Dear Mishra Ji,

Hinduism is NOT recognized as a "Religion" under Income Tax Law in the sense Christianity or Islam is taken.

We have seen cases against Sri Shankaracharya Ji, jailed, tortured, humiliated and finally acquitted clean after nearly eight years. The whole drama turned out to be an anti-Hindu conspiracy. So court cases and legal status of Matha as a Trust or another legal form of entity is not relevant here for the matter under consideration.

What is important is a clarification on the facts as, not to repeat the same, as credibility is at stake which will guide the masses in the future. Mistakes are natural so are their corrections. We are all human beings, after all.
