Dear Vidyasagar Ji,

  

If there is something wrong in reporting (here in TBFS), whatever and whosoever one may be, and above all, when it is associated with the public sentiment via tradition, it must be made explicit. With due respect and Honour to Sri Shankaracharya Ji and the body managing the affair, if what Mr.Rajiv Malhotra has written ( I am concerned here only with the issue of transfer of rights of Vedanta), is not correct then, I am afraid, it would damage the credibility. The same applies to the Matha if the otherwise is true. So credibility is at stake both sides.

  

Personally, I have no mercy in such matter, if something is put before the public, it must be true and supported by evidence OR must be proved contrary and again supported by evidence. Any attempt for mass movement on fishy facts is doomed to fail sooner or later once facts are out.

I am no insider or outsider to any side, both are mine (ours) and my Matha is within me.

  

Regards

Sati Shankar
