Dear Bijoy Mishra Ji

  

I have typed this in a hurry, so please excuse any spelling or grammar mistakes. What cause is SI advocating? From their own website<http://swadeshiindology.com/>(retrieved March 4 2017, italics mine)

  

Quote

Swadeshi Indology Conference Series comprise *one of the activities of Infinity Foundation India*.

Further down on the same website, the larger context is clarified thus (ibid., italics mine)

  

Quote

Infinity Foundation India is a not for profit trust incorporated at Chennai, India. It envisages four tracks of activities.

Track A: *Original* R&D/book publishing. *Rajiv Malhotra, inspiration of IFI has 15 books in the pipeline* and he is looking for experienced research/writing assistants to help him out.  

Track B: Swadeshi Indology movement: This will nurture new scholars *to take up the subject matters from A*, produce more scholarship and publish more books. The idea is to build a Home Team of intellectuals of the highest standard.  

Track C: E-learning: Here we plan to develop courses based on topics where we have research leadership. The book, *Being Different*, will be the first topic for such a course. These will be taught with university credits. We are just now putting concrete plans together.  

Track D: Outreach. This includes popular level mass distribution, using media and social media. This is where all the book clubs and volunteer teams come in.

So as per its own website, Track A will involve **original** research and publishing (including 15 books in pipeline by Rajiv Malhotra), Track B (Swadeshi Indology movement) will pick up subject matters from Track A (in that sense it is kind of secondary research), Track C will involve teaching a book on topics with research leadership, for example Being Different by Rajiv Malhotra with university credits, and so on.

  

Therein lies the problem for me to identify with Swadeshi Indology. Swadeshi Indology is not just promoting a cause, it is promoting a personality (Malhotra) and trust (Infinity Foundation) along with the cause. Rajiv Malhotra is all over Swadeshi Indology. He is the primary creator of original content in Track A, which will be picked up in Track B (Swadeshi Indology), and taught in Track C. Swadeshi Indology claims to counter 250 years of narrative, but is a part of a larger movement involved in creating and promoting a cult centred around a personality. That, Bijoy Mishra Ji, is my problem with Swadeshi Indology as it stands now. Indology and scholarship need to be independent of larger-than-life personalities.

  

Just for a sample, let us look at some statements from pre-print papers of SI-1 to see the *paroksha* and *pratyaksha* *prashasti*-s of Rajiv Malhotra (as per the papers he is right, invaluable, precise, clear, one and only, eye-opener of thousands, illuminating, blah blah). I do not know if these will make it to the final versions. But they sure give an idea that Track B is following Track A.

  

On “Death of Sanskrit”

*as Rajiv Malhotra rightly calls them,*

*The analysis Rajiv Malhotra has performed ... has been invaluable for its preciseness and clarity.*

  

Sheldon Pollock on “Sastra”

*as Rajiv Malhotra bears him out to be*

*In the words of Rajiv Malhotra*

*In the words of Rajiv Malhotra, it is a „non-translatable‟*

*Well does Rajiv Malhotra say*

*Thanks to the one and only, Sri Rajiv Malhotra, whose videos and books (especially The Battle for Sanskrit) opened the eyes of thousands of insiders like me,*

  

Critique of Sheldon Pollock’s ““Rāmāyaṇa Volume 2 : Introduction to Ayodhyākāṇḍa”

*Rajiv Malhotra, in his book, The Battle for Sanskrit, writes,*

  

A pūrva-pakṣa of “Deep Orientalism ?”

*Consider, for example, the section “Blaming Sanskrit for Nazism” in Malhotra (2016).*

  

Sanskrit : the Phoenix Phenomenon

*(ref. Malhotra 2011, Ch.2)*

*Also, his stand about the influence of Islamic forces as pointed out by Rajiv Malhotra(2016:285-286)*

  

Did Indian Intellectual tradition hold that all knowledge of practice is contained in śāstras?

*Rajiv Malhotra wrote an illuminating article about Vivekananda’s contributions to knowledge of the West in celebration of Vivekananda’s 150th birth anniversary.*

*Rajiv Malhotra coined the term history-centrism (Malhotra 2011) to highlight the inextricable link between*

  

Thanks, Nityananda
