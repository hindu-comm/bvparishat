Namaste

On points highlighted below:

The post below creates more nausea on the way current debate and scholars seem to present, summarize and surmise the role, responsibility and authority of the 'traditional mathams', run under the sacred code of 'Sannyasa -Paramahamsa Parivrajaka Yati Dharma'.

IF the following clarity presented below, present in the lay peoples mind is understood by the elite academia, then there is nothing to debate ! The fallacy and nausea that such debate generates becomes clear.

The targeted singling out of one of the 'oldest institutions' held in high regard by 'Dharma Practitioners', just because the ' money involved was significant' and the SI proponent makes a sweet talk to whip up sentiments and touch the raw nerve of public high sensitivity is much more regrettable.

Bharath has a plethora of ' Mathams' , and 'Mathams running
successfully their show as 'Missions, Societies, Mandirs and Universities'. Why are they kept in to the side wings ? Why are they not brought to the table of 'postmortem analysis in this Battle' and made to jump in to the fray ? Is it because they sing the same chorus tune of SI - Battle cry ?

Let me present some basic position statements:

**1. Matha's are not ' modern Universities'** **by Objectives,** **functionality** **and processes.** **They are different ' breeds'.**

The very comparison of ' matham' to a ' western university' model and suggested outcomes of inappropriate nature built on this self-visioned understanding shows how poor is the in-house scholars appreciation of a traditional institution, the role by the head of the matham' under the leadership of 'Sannyasa - Value - Boundaries'.

Mathams are not seminaries or the ' churches for specific scripture promotion' for promotion of ' Religion postulated as politically correct Hinduism' !

**2**. **Matha's are not '** **Social reform agencies,** **Soceities and Trusts,** **a community congregation place of worship by faith** **- practice'** **as private proeprty** **! to supplement the role of a secular or a theocratic state using** **'** **Dharma = Religion and Matham = Mission'**** ideology !**********

**In short,** **Mathams are NOT ' Mandirs'. Example :** **T****irupathy devasthanam is NOT a ' matha'.** **Udupi Mathas are different from the 'Sri Krishna Mandiram'.**

  

**3. 'Matha' is NOT an empire building or Empire aspiring or Empire controlling institution like** **Papacy****;**** The clarity between 'Saamrajya** **(empire)****'****, 'Swa-Rajya ( Ones own Nation)** **and** **'****Swaarajaya****m'** **( Moksha Saamrajaya)****'**** are not same. Matham is for 'Swaaraayam'****.**

**4. Matham head is not the CEO** **of a Corporate where ' Fina****n****cial success is measured by Stock Market indices and Media rating'.**

**5. Matham is NOT student enrollment center and Social service providing,** **a Trust conglomerate** **running** **a series of** **educ****ational institutions****, hospitals and ' orpanges and old age homes'** **at all levels to make 'Dhanam' from 'Vidyaa****' 'Seva' related****** **Service business =** **'** **Panya** **-Vyavahara' !**

**6 . Coming to Pollock issue, the** **battle is for the ' Academia Warriors and Maharathis with their sepoys and soldiers'; It is not the battle of '****Saf****fron** **-Adhyatma -****Dialoguers'.** **Have you ever seen a Sri Krishna dressed in Saffron robe ? or with a** **microphone addressing a gathering in the** **square** **for a discourse ? Why drag the ' Sannyasa oath holder' to the social scandalizing de****bate ?**
