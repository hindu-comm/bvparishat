......  

My  
dream is very simple: If our civilisation survived, nay  
flourished, for a few thousand years, it still can do so by  
looking into its own original value-systems and genius.  
Indological work in the West, especially in the West, is  
constantly producing a contrary verdict. The elite of our  
country today are at a loss to handle this. Something must  
be done to rectify this.  

..................  
  
  
There is gross misunderstanding about how our civilisation survived. And this misunderstanding is not limited to people out side of our country but afflicts even those who reside in the country.  
  
Let me put one quote by Colonel James Tod from his "Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan":  
  
"What nation on earth could have maintained the semblance of civilization, the spirit or the customs of their forefathers, during so many centuries of overwhelming depression, but one of such singular character as the Rajpoot? . . . Rajasthan exhibits the sole example in the history of mankind, of a people withstanding every outrage barbarity could inflict, or human nature sustain, from a foe whose religion (Islam) commands annihilation; and bent to the earth, yet rising buoyant from the pressure, and making calamity a whetstone to courage. . . . Not an iota of their religion or customs have they lost. . . ."  
  
Mahabharata rightly says:  
शूर बाहुषु लॊकॊ ऽयं लम्बते पुत्र वत सदा  
तस्मात सर्वास्व अवस्थासु शूरः संमानम अर्हति \|\|  
न हि शौर्यात परं किं चित तरिषु लॊकेषु विद्यते  
शूरः सर्वं पालयति सर्वं शूरे परतिष्ठितम \|\|
