My opinion is that be it humanities/languages (the 14-line Shiva Sutras or multi-volume Vachaspatyam) or sciences (one page Watson-Crick paper of multi-volume *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* by Newton), quality matters irrespective of the size. I am not postulating on quality of the publications, we will only see that once they are out.
