Dear Scholars,

  

I wish to make a small clarification. I fondly hope this will be the last item of the thread.

Due to the overwhelming number of mails I had had to handle, confronting veritable *atiratha*-s and *maha*-*ratha*-s, I missed responding to some portions of some mails. I am, too, losing the patience to recheck all that has been said by others and myself.

  

The "unhealthy language" that I used is, I realise, was not in good taste. I realise my mistake. But there was some confusion, I guess, on the part of those who felt offended too.

  

I used two words fairly consistently, if I remember aright. I used "*pandit*-s" for the traditional *vidvān*-s, and "scholars" for the modern-educated intellectuals. If I referred in that sentence that these people cannot buy articles paying $30 or more, the reference was obviously to these, not the traditional *vidvān*-s, whom I respect highly. It is perhaps not the case, however, that the majority of them did their very best in the given circumstances. It is not easy to pass any verdict; nor is it so desirable either. Nevertheless, it is not that there are no bitter truths at all.

  

As to the beautiful note of Shivraj Singh, citing Col. Todd. Why go so far - till 200 years ago? Even till as recently as 50 years ago, most Hindus could retain their traditions/customs/values intact though not without struggle. But the way the powers that be behaved making inroads into our society, corroding it from within and eroding the very national ethos brazenly, is perhaps an untold story. I have noted earlier how, even among Indologists, Ingalls was far more dignified as against the turpitude and chicanery of a Wendy or a Pollock - both of whom were conferred high public awards by our own erstwhile governments.

  

Finally, I must admit I have learnt a lot in the course of these discussions. I do not believe that there is only one way, my way, to solve the issues. i never did. That is why, some might have noticed, there was not a word of braggart in my report. Yes, I have highlighted the positive aspects. The negative ones are for internal consumption, for future amelioration and edification.

  

The plus point is that, as Prof. Paturi sagaciously pointed out, there is a general agreement on the existence of the problem. There may be differences as to diagnosis and medication. But if more and more of us put forth efforts (in as coordinated a manner as possible, preferably), we will surely move towards the goal state.

  

The very existence of BVParishat is, in this context, an excellent opportunity for scholars to debate and help each other.

  

Let not our disquisitions stoke fires of animosity and disrupt each others' work

\- not *vāde vāde vardhate vaira-vahniḥ;*

but rather be leads to evocations of the verity of things:

***- vāde vāde jāyate tattva-bodhaḥ,***

the one, in fact, that takes us closer to *niḥśreyasa*;

***tattva-jñānān niḥśreyasādhigamaḥ***

***  
***

*śubham !*

Deep Regards to all
