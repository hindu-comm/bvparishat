Swami Ji

  

If I may, please do not leave the group. While I agree that many discussions on the group (even many of my posts) may not be to your liking. But my opinion is that the group needs a voice like yours. You are one of the few people who present a traditional Shastric view, many times in Sanskrit, and it would be a loss of many people if somebody like you leaves the group.

  

While some on the list may have a view thatit is the role of kṣattra to protect brahma and some may pride themselves with the neologism Intellectual Kshatriyas, my view is that the power of kṣattra is no match to the that of brahma, as Valmiki says so precisely:

  

धिग्बलं क्षत्त्रियबलं ब्रह्मतेजोबलं बलम्।

एकेन ब्रह्मदण्डेन सर्वास्त्राणि हतानि मे॥ वा.रा. १-५५-२३ ॥

  

The verse could not be more apt for this situation as you have ब्रह्मतेजस् and carry the दण्ड, which no Indologist (old, new, swadeshi) on this list does.

  

With regards, Nityananda
