I would like the challenge posed by foreign Indologists to be looked upon in an entitrely different way. For every Pollock who studies Sanskrit and reaches a position where he can influence Indians, India should produce 5 Pollocks who study a non-Indian language and become authorities in that language like Pollock has become in Sanskrit studies.

Regards,

Murthy
