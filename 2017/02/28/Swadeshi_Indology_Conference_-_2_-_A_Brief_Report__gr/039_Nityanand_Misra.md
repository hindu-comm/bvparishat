Regarding a clarification from the Matha, does the Sringeri Peetha have a media incharge/public relations department? They do have an Administrator and Administrative Office as seen from <http://www.sringeri.net/contact> (also a Peshkar and Publication department), but I do not see a media/public relations department. If an author/mediaperson/publisher wants to contact Sringeri Peetha for an article query, who would they contact? The Administrator? Is the Sringeri Peetha a registered trust or society? They seem to have been represented in courts by Administrator Of The Shringeri. For example Administrator Of The Shringeri vs Charity Commissioner in Bombay High Court (1962). And there was another case Sri Sringeri Nelamau Samsthanam vs State Of Karnataka And Others (1997).

  

Sorry for the digression, this probably needs a new thread. But in the context of getting an official account from Sringeri Peetha, I think the questions are relevant.
