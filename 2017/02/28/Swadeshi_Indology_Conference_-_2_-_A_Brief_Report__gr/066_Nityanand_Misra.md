Dear Prof. Kannan

  

Thanks for your taking the time out and sorry to bother you again.  

  

A quick question about SI-1: I remember there were paper submissions by Shankar Rajaraman (Badrayan Vyas awardee) and Dr. Sati Shankar (member of this list). I do not see them in the list of papers under<http://swadeshiindology.com/si-1/papers/>. Will these two be part of the selected papers that are going to be published?

  

Kind regards, Nityananda
