I am stunned to notice the critical tone Mr Nityanand Misra. I had heard he had participated

in the first SI conference in Chennai. He should write if he was disillusioned for whatever

reason. Rajiv Malhotra is an activist scholar and we have to accept the work with

our kindness because it is a much needed awakening.
