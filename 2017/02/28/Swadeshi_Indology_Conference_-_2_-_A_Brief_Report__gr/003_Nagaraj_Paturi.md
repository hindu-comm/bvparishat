Sri G S S Murty has a point when he says , "Why make a giant of a wind-mill?"

  

In fact, this point has been made repeatedly by several people.

  

SI team too repeatedly defended their current focus on a specific scholar.

  

Both the sides of the argument have their own merits.

  

But if a team is putting concerted efforts in a certain direction, they must have thought of the consequences too well.

  

Let us remember that they said that this focus is only the current one and that will change in future.
