True. Srinivasa Ramanujan's famous theorem might also be of one page. Vachaspatyam by Taranath Tarkavachaspati is a multi-volume work Quality did not suffer because of it's size. Are not we comparing research in Humanities with that of Sciences. Methodology surely differs. Postulating about the quality may be too early before they are out.
