Nice flights of fancy, dear poet!

  

We probably have enough scholars who cannot write mails without half a dozen errors within 3 lines of their mails to even academic groups! So busy and important they are that they have no patience to revise even single line mails! If only we could dream of even a score of scholars in the *entire* country having but a fraction of the extensive and intensive cultivation of the likes of Pollock! 

  

Lack of awareness is a boon: ignorance, some say, is bliss!

  

I do appreciate your point, Mr Murthy; but then, do you want only others to rise to the occasion?
