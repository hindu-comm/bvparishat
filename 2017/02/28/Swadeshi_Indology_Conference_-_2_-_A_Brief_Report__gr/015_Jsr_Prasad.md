Dear Sir,  
  

It is a sheer co-incidence that I thought of this maxim. I missed the opportunity to participate in the SI-2. I do not wish to miss the video capturing of the proceedings again, if they are available. Can you kindly share the links with the list. Proceedings amounted to 2500 pages, shows the magnanimity of efforts fuelled in. Once again, congrats to you, SRM and all scholars. This is a battle not with battle tanks - but with think tanks; a battle not with guns as weapons, but with pens as weapons!  
  

Regards
