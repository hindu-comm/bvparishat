Dear scholars,

  

I guess we had fairly long discussions on the Swadeshi Indology Conference Series. Many scholars have given very valuable inputs. I may attempt some responses/clarifications from my side (and help Prof Paturi draw the curtain on the issue, if he likes).

  

The starting point was Prof **Veeranarayana Pandurangi**'s curious enquiry regarding the happenings of SI-2 conference. There was or is no veil of secrecy here. The focus is, rather than on trumpeting much about, more on some quiet work that is being attempted here. Some information to the scholars/public is also required, hence the Call for Papers for/Schedule of/Report of the Conference to the public, or at least academic groups, is made as occasions demand.  

  

Sri **Nityananda Misra**-ji has raised some important issues - reg. selection of papers for presentation/publication of abstracts/papers etc. I guess Sri Misra knows much about how these happen. As far as my knowledge goes, things have to move pretty fast in the fields of the like of science and technology, as issues of IPR and patents loom large there; hence the urgency of publication, and issues of priority of dates of publication etc.; abstracts are provided well before the conference, and the Proceedings are made available soon after, or sometimes during, the conf; or even at the time of registration itself. Take a look, on the other hand at, say, even the World Sanskrit Conference: do these things all happen here as they do elsewhere? I am not sure that all the papers will be published either. Conferences are also occasions where evaluators get an idea as to how well the presenter has mastered what he sought to say. Where was it announced by us, first of all, that *all* papers presented in the conference would be published? Misra himself has spoken of some "young researchers without formal training in Indology"; should they be not given an exposure to the performance of some knowledgeable scholars, which they get by attending a conference? I do not understand how Misra is vested with an authority to demand, or even insist on publication of *all* papers?

  

Sri **Ajith Gargeswari** seems to be confident that our *maṭha*-s and scholars are doing well what they need to do. I can only call this unfortunate. Even over a hundred years ago, some of the Western Indologists were themselves bemoaning that Sanskrit scholarship is dying in India. He speaks as if the tribe of Sanskrit scholars is still flourishing in India. I sometimes wonder how many of them had even heard of Prof. Pollock earlier. Many proffer a very generic and specious argument saying the likes of Pollock come and go, but Sanskrit and Sanatana Dharma are eternal. If no conscious efforts were required, why should the great Śaṅkara or Rāmānuja or others have worked so hard? The fact is that our *maṭha*-s and scholars are not at their best today, and something is missing, the proof of which is in the way our younger generation has largely lost interest in our heritage. Assessments can vary, and I have no quarrel with those who differ on this. He may feel that no damage has ever been done, or even sought to be done, by Western Indologists; or suspect that our conferences are bent on proving little more than spaceships in *mantra*-s. We can surely admire his capacity for imagination rather than for verification. How many of our traditional Pandits or modern scholars know what is being written in Western journals and publications - especially when each article may well cost $30? It is only people who have tried to tap our scholars on key issues that can realise the general incompetence, chronic laziness, bouts of loftiness and readiness to be sold out, or even eagerness to be bought off - of a good many of them. It is only a Paturi who can realise the degree and magnitude of the organisational structure that the West provides to Indologists, as against all odds against their counterparts here in India. What wonder, then, if there are more number of Indologists, and more competent ones at that, in the West today than in India? Or will Ajith Gargeswari pretend ignorance even here?

  

On the other hand, we believe that there is much truth in what **Bijoy Misra** said viz."He \[Rajiv Malhotra\] and his associates are doing an extremely timely service to India and India's traditions. Sheldon Pollock and some such people are the new colonialists and they have to be repelled with all energy that India can muster. *Intellectual slavery could be more dangerous than the occupation*" (*italics ours*). And the words of Prof. **Vidyasankaran Sundaresan** - that "the *vidvajjana*-s are waking up" now, and more importantly, the following - deserve full attention : "I wish ... those who organised and attended the Swadeshi Indology Conference can concentrate on the real problems with Sheldon Pollock's views... I also hope that the *vidvan*-s will eventually expand their field of vision to *look at other issues and scholars as well and not assume that the work is done, now that Pollock's positions have been problematised and analysed*". (*italics ours*)  

  

Finally, as to the touchy issue of the role of *maṭha*-s in general: I personally believe that the *maṭha*-s should have been active in the public sphere also, even if indirectly. Look at the seminaries and theological colleges throughout the world: they study *every issue that impinges on them*, even if indirectly, and prepare documents, write books, hold seminars and conferences, and even award degrees - educating the public on their stand etc. Dear friend Ajit Gargeswari was stung by a comment on spelling mistakes even though he was not named or even meant to be criticised specifically. How I wish our *maṭha*-s resembled him even remotely! : retorting with force if not fury when their methods or values were criticised; they failed even when they were held to public ridicule, or even when openly attacked or subtly sabotaged. They should have been at it for the past 300 years at least - doing *purvapaksha,* not just of the Cārvāka or Buddhism or Jainism*,* but of the virulent invading proselytising faiths and the avalanche of modern isms which all had an impact on their values, philosophies, and lifestyles, undermining them with great success and on a formidable scale. They have slept enough living in their dream-world; it is time to wake up to the realities - where so many of their writs are flouted and pooh-poohed.  

  

Lastly, I cannot help admiring Prof **Paturi** for his wonderful balancing act - as an astute administrator, not hesitating to give his impartial ruling - without any hesitation but without sacrificing the dignity of the Parishat.
