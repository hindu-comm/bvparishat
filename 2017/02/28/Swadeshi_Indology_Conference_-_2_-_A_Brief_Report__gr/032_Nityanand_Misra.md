My personal opinion is given the seriousness of the uncorroborated claims in TBFS about Sringeri Matha and SVBF, there should be an official statement from the Matha or SVBF. However, if HH Bharati Tirtha Swami Ji has advised against it, it may not happen.

  

I disagree with my learned friend Dr. Sati Shankar's when he says that the conclusion is obvious if Sringeri Matha/SVBF do not refute Malhotra's account. The silence from Sringeri Matha/SVBF in itself does not prove Malhotra's version. As it is Malhotra (and not Sringeri Matha/SVBF) who presents the dramatic narrative without concrete evidence (transcripts of emails or phone calls or extracts from any documents exchanged between SVBF and Pollock), the onus of proving the tall claims is on Malhotra alone. This may also not happen given Malhotra's poor track record of not answering questions around even simple claims in his book (like the claim that Pollock has written that Anushtup was invented by Buddhists and copied by Valmiki).
