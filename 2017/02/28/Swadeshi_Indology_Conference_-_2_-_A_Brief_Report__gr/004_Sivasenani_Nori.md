Sri G S S Murthy

  

Namaste. The case against Pollock is made by Sri Rajeev Malhotra in his "Battled for Sanskrit". Pollock's scholarship is of a high order. His students are in influential positions with access to influential media vehicles. For instance, one Ananya Vajpeyi, a student of Pollock writes in The Hindu spewing venom against Indian traditions. The Hindu seems to particularly favour her given the alignment between the thoughts of their editor and her. For all talk of scholars will refute Pollock as they see fit, ,that is simply not happening. So the initiative by Prof. Kannan is indeed very welcome especially as we do not have an active tradition of engagement with Indologist and Neo-orientalist scholars and yet as Sri Rohan Murty's (son of Narayana Murthy if Infosys) donation of 160 crores to a project in Harvard shows, the part of India which is trying to discover its roots by reading primarily in English (basically most of young middle class India) believes the stuff written by Pollock and his ilk. So, the work of Prof. Kannan and others is indeed laudable.

  

Let us look at it from another angle. What is the problem with the present attempt? Pollock and his Sishyas would feel something like "Aha, the whole of India's scholar community is now standing up against one man. So great is our contribution. Now, it is only a matter of time before our ideology steamrolls India and Indians will start feeling guilty about Sanskrit he way Germans feel about holocaust". Let them feel so. Ravana also felt invincible, and Rama did not even have a chariot. We should not be bothered about feelings, but should focus on outcomes.

  

Since no harm is being done, and much good is likely, I urge the scholar community to support this initiative as much as possible. At the least it should not be discouraged.
