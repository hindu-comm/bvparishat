Dear Sri G S S Murtyji,

  

Now that you admitted your sarcasm /intended meaning, you might also have appreciated mine about Sri Aurobino etc.

  

Dear sir, you say, "I did mean that we need to appreciate Prof.Pollock for the way he is doing whatever he is doing."

  

Appreciating Prof. Pollock? That is exactly what is being done by those who are producing arguments counter to his. If they did not appreciate him, they would have ignored him. If, of course, by appreciating, you meant admiring, they did not do that. Whenever people asked them to ignore him, they said he is too great a scholar to be ignored. What more appreciation do you want? Since you are not satisfied with such an appreciation of his work, your dissatisfaction would only mean that you like them to admire him, accept his point of view, agree with him etc., because these are the things they are not doing with regard to him.

  

This is not the right platform or occasion to remind/educate you about why westerners had and have the context to learn Sanskrit and why Indians did not and do not have such a context to learn any other western language than English. Whatever are the motives, some of which are not not so admirable, discussion of which is too huge to be covered here, in the west, there are funds and other provisions for learning Sanskrit. Do we have any comparable motives, motivations, funds etc., for India to produce scholars of that level in any western language other than English? Within the available context, motives, motivations, funds and other provisions many Indians are excelling in many contemporary western languages such as French, German, Spanish etc.

  

Admiring Prof. Pollock, 'for the way he is doing whatever he is doing.' is not happening because he is saying, Sanskrit is dead, Sanskrit was only a liturgical labguages, S'aastras are frozen ,Sanskrit is harmful etc.

  

Best way of appreciating him is to produce counter arguments to his arguments by recognizing that he is worthy of engaging.
