With this post full of choicest abuse for tradition and maTha, you reveal your intentions.

I fear people like you more than Pollack, etc.People like you are next generation of insiders who will harm us more than others, just like those reformers of British age.

  

With this post my fear about this list becoming a playground of indologist, old new and swadeshi, becomes true.

  

I think people like me, who came to bvp in early days to make it a place to learn from traditional people, should consider to leave this list now.

  

It's not even a proper platform now for sane people.
