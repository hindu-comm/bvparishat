I doubt if this the video (which is four years old) Prof. Paturi is referring to. There is just a passing reference लोकेषु वर्तमाना संस्कृतभाषा मृतभाषेति भ्रान्तिरपनोदनीया। and no cutting of any thesis. There are many in India who call Sanskrit as मृतभाषा (I have heard this since my childhood) and so I doubt if Swamiji had Pollock's thesis in mind. I may be wrong here though.
