To extend Prof. Prasad's analogy of think-tanks being equivalent of tanks and pens being equivalent of guns in this battle, I can add that questioning an intellectual in academia is equivalent to a challenging a kshatriya on the battlefield. Questioning academic honesty of an intellectual (e.g. by saying their claims are false or misleading) is akin to challenging paurusha of a kshatriya. If the intellectual/kshatriya does not respond to a scholastic question/challenge for a duel, what do we make of the intellectual/kshatriya?

  

PS: Any resemblance to the phrase *Intellectual Kshatriya* is unintended.
