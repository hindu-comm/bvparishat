Dear Dr. Vidyashanka Ji,

The other side which remained silent is the other side, not your side, you have given enough information on modus operandi of Matha. People like Sati Shankar (s)and Sri Malhotra will come and go but Matha shall remain as they have been, I do understand. Therefore, the onus is on the other side.

Secondly, questioning is always important than remaining silent and in the process, here, nothing personal.

Regards

Sati Shankar
