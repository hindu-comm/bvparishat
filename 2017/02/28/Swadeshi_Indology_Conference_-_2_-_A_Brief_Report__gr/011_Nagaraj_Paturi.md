Dear Sri G S S Murtyji,

  

I agree with Prof. K S Kannan when he calls your idea of five Pollocks 'flights of fancy'.

  

Why should we produce a scholar of Prof. Pollock's level in some non-Indian language? How does it work? Will Prof. Pollock then stop doing what he is currently doing by looking at these scholars of non-Indian languages saying, "now that there are scholars of my Sanskrit-level from India in non-Indian languages, I should stop doing those things which are objectionable to those Indians who are opposed to what I am doing?" What weird logic? Why would he think that way or react that way?

  

or, was there an implied sarcasm in the form of saying, " Please appreciate Prof. Pollock for reaching this level in Sanskrit which is not his mother tongue. If your Sri Aurobindos, Sarojini Naidus, Srinivasa Shastrys and a huge number of scholars acquired command over English which is not their mother tongue, still did not interfere with the politics of the English speaking countries or did not speak about the 'harmful' aspects of English, it is their weakness. If somebody learns Sanskrit to this degree and talks about harmful effects of Sanskrit, it is his strength. Why do you frown at the strength of the other person in stead of overcoming your own weakness? "
