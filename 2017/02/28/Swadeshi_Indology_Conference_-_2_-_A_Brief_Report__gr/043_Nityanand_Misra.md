Dear Prof. Kannan

  

Thanks for your response.

  

Let me clarify: I simply asked why only selected papers are being published and not all papers. I am nobody to insist or demand publication of all papers. I was interested in knowing is if cost, time, or quality of papers was the issue. I hope I am allowed to be curious about the reason.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
