Correction:

  

While I am with you in identifying a need to produce counter literature ***to*** the one produced by a section of western Indologists who view the matter of their focus, i.e., India, Indian culture and Sanskrit ***with antagonism***, I am not able to go with you in your content and tone when you spoke of Mathas and traditional scholars.
