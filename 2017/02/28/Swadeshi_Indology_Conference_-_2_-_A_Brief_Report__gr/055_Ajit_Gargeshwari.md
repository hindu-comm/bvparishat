Our Mathas don't need any defense. If not for them or their founders Sanskrit would have been wiped out from India a thousand years back. If one wants to help one can always do less of damage to them or their reputation and drag them on lists where they are not represented. We don't have Mathas official spokes person on this list but have views of those who do have a great inside knowledge of Mathas.  
  

There is no term as Hinduism and Hindus never stood for any one matha. If that is understood it will be good enough.  
  

Without the knowledge of Traditional scholars from India western

 

Sanskrit studies and Indian Sanskrit studies will have no foundation.

They are the Gurus for all. Generalization should be avoided always. If one does not want to help least one can do is to not generalization and hurl abuses at themWhen it comes to complex textual problem its the traditional scholars who can teach no one else can substitute them.  
  

Thanks for your views and also for reading or not reading what I have written
