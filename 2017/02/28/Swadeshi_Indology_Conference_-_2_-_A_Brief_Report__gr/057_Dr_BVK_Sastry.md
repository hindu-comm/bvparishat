Namaste



On \< " If there is something wrong in reporting (here in TBFS), ... it must be made explicit. >



So what is expected ? An American model trails E-mail investigations
and wash the ‘ dirty linen’ in the public and feed the frenzy of media ? Typical of American Sensationalism in making warmth through scandal debate ?



Through this genuinely honest to the core Truth seeking, what is
proposed ? To declare virtuous and victorious either side of the debate in the zero-sum game ?

 How will this ‘Self- Introspection ( Atma –Shodhana / Atma – Pradarshana; the pet phrase for this is ‘ Tapas’ = Heating ) help in SP Battle ?

 Will it help to build a team ? Will it improve the scholarship ? Will it bring out the Truth ?



 Certainly, the statement would be : ‘ India is waiting to Know the Truth’ !



If one needs to see the ‘ in house Text –productions, more damaging than SP ’ and prior to SP , which has been swallowed ‘ religiously and avowedly, with passion by many in the SI teams’, all produced inside of India, there will be a need for a much greater damage control exercise. One would need a separate SI –In house Audit team and resources.



As this is besides the point here, I refrain from expanding of this.
