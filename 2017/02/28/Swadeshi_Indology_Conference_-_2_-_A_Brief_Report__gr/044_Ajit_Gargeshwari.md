Please this as my ending note on this thread.  
  
Thank you Prof Kannan for clarifying. I am very glad that you have read, commented and affectionately answered my questions. With great admiration and respect towards the cause you are with I am writing. I however wish to respectfully disagree on this point. I don't pretend ignorance but its not so bad as it is portrayed that is what I was trying to say.  
  

The primary purpose of mathas is to propagate the dharma the founders of the Mathas had realized. Everything else is secondary and incidental in nature. How will Indological articles written by scholars who don't see any allegiance with any mathas and who have only lip sympathy for learning the traditions that mathas stand for help the mathas. Traditional scholars or traditional writers have a different audience you are right they may be a dwindling lot but still they do exists. Generalization is not always the best solution. How many westerners visit Churches? Attendance to churches have come down. Religious and pious propagation is personal to individuals and that is where mathas come in. Probably some wanted to gain the stamp of the Matha and say they have the stamp of mathas and their followers and wanted to increase their political if not academic influence. Since they got none they have started to talk 'Grapes are sour' you are a lazy lot You say 'retorting with force if not fury when their methods or values were criticized; they failed even when they were held to public ridicule, or even when openly attacked or subtly sabotaged" can the same question not be turned around? I hope its a beginning of a great chapter in the annals of scholarship and not two factions at logger heads. Spliiting into camps avery small group on Sanskrit and India study researchers will this help is aquestion that has to be considered.  
  

Younger generation have lost interest in our heritage because it doesn't pay enough or is not motivating enough. This is not a problem mathas have to address to. This is trend in across all research disciplines. Good Sanskrit studies with the needed meta is being done out side the formal fold.  
  

If west is proving organizational structures its because of the money the goverment and private spenders want to spend of research and education. This is where goverment and private bodies can step in. When the goverment spends less than 3% of GDP on education a small chuck goes to higher education out of which all the amount goes towards salaries and maintenance and little fund is left for research. I don't know how the politics of anti pollock or ant western Indological stance is going to help. Will outsiders of who are not with academia help our universities or does this need to come from the universities themselves is a question that one needs to ask. Will social media blogs and activism help that a question that needs to be answered.
