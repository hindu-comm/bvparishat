Respected vidvAn-s,

It is a known fact that many a European and other Occidental scholars took interest in Indian laguages and acquired proficiency with ulterior motives, mostly evangelical. I was shocked when I read the Preface of the celebrated Sanskrit-English dictionary of Sir Monier Monier Williams that the sole purpose of their undertaking such a stupendous project was ".....to enable his (Colonel Boden, founder and first occupant of Boden Chair at Oxford) countrymen to proceed in the CONVERSION of the natives of India to the Christian religion".
