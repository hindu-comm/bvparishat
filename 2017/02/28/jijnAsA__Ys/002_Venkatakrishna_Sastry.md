Namaste

  

As thetopic of definition and meaning of '**Deva**' -hassurface again, and the reference to explain is drawn from Rigveda,  it may be worth while to make further contemplationon the total text andtranslation mapping of this term presented in lexicons /Translations and current usage. The current usages do not reflect or resonate with the the original conceptualization of 'Deva' in
Rig-Veda mantra.

[  
](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/index.htm#)  
Some other part of Vedas also speak of 'Deva'as onewho may unify us with auspicious Buddhi ( sa no devah shubhayaa buddhyaa samyunaktu) = Buddhi -Yoga pradaataa devaH.

  

The fall out question from this contemplation is : would the concept of 'God' in Abrahamic Theology map to the Vedic Concept presented above ? How would we explain 'Ganesha as a Deva' using the Rigvedic meaning ? without recourse to Ganapathyatharva sheersha upanisaht ?
