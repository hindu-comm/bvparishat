Thanks for all the responses. Some of Mukul's claims in his [HT interview](http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/interview-a-book-on-how-gita-press-helped-shape-hindu-right/story-ukC4K0hIdA11KFjlVBCPxL.html) are really bizarre.

  

“When Malviya died in 1946, they brought out the 13th issue of Kalyan. It was impounded by the British government because it was so rabid and called on people to kill Muslims.”

NM: Difficult to believe Kalyan published this and it could be an extrapolation or misrepresentation of what Kalyan actually published. Have to see the original article(s).

  

“It's a Marwari trust. It is supposed to have only upper caste people. The trust rules say that.”

NM: Will need to cross-check with the trust rules if trustees have to be Marwari-s alone or upper caste people. Even if it is the case, it is common for community trusts and organizations in India (e.g. the Agrawala Samaja-s, Bunts' Sangha-s, Brahmana Samaja-s, Yadav Mahasabha-s) to have trustees from a specific community alone, so I do not know what is the big deal with Gobind Bhawan Karyalaya having people from a specific community alone.  

  

“For instance, his relationships with women were warped. ... If you read the letters (Poddar's letters to the women), at one level, it's like how a modern Radha would have written to Krishna; then it gets erotic at times, and then ends with 'aapki behen'.”  

NM: Mukul probably means the women's letters to Poddar and not the other way round. Still, one needs to see the actual content of the letters to cross-check if what he claims to be erotic is really erotic or not.  

  

The book is important as it promoted by well-known people (Arundhati Roy, Ramchandra Guha, etc) and received considerable coverage. I might be buying a copy in the near future and will share if I get any more information on the above claims.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
