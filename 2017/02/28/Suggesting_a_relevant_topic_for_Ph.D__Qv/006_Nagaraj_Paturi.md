For the benefit of younger students particularly research course aspirants, let me clarify that

  

1\. If you propose your translation work as research work, your proposal will get rejected.

  

2\. If you propose to work on say, Valmiki Ramayana, by studying an English translation of the same and by not studying the Sanskrit original, your proposal will get rejected.

  

But

  

3\. If you propose to study how well a translater translated, what problems were faced by the translator, how that person resolved those problems, what are the politics involved in translating, what are the aspects of comparative study that can be understood through translation, what future translators can learn from the translation etc., your proposal shall not only be accepted, it shall be encouraged and supported.
