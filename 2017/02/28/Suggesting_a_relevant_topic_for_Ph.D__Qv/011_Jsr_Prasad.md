I regret, immediately I do not have a pointer to this. But you may do a search online. Alternatively, you may like to visit the following site contributed by our respected member, Sri Shankara ji \<<http://hinduebooks.blogspot.in/2010/08/works-of-sri-sankaracharya-sanskrit-20.html>\>. You can see many Hindi translations for Sankara bhashyas. But, be vigilant, they were translated by scholars of repute.
