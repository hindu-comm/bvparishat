Madam,

  

The research scholar has already said that his research itself is in the field of translation.

  

Translation is a highly established field of academics and research in it too is well established. Researcher does not study the source text through translation as you seem to imagine. The researcher focuses on the method /quality /problems of translation and not on the contents of either the source text or the target text.
