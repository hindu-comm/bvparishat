Dear Vishvasji,

  

  Though Professor K. V. Abhyankar was not my direct teacher, as he had retired many years before my college years in Pune, I used to visit him at his home very often for advice, and I continued to do that after I migrated to the US in 1968. Just a few weeks before his horrible murder, I visited him. He was sitting on a gaddi with four or five heaps of books around him. He said that these were his current projects. While I was talking to him, another elderly man, Mr. Joglekar (if my memory serves) came by to see him. Prof. Abhyankar introduced him to me as his current student in Pāṇinian grammar. Prof. Abhyankar not only continued his research vigorously till the very end of his life, he continued to teach privately at his home. His Introductory volume to his father's Marathi translation of the Mahābhāṣya is an excellent source on the history of the Pāṇinian tradition, and especially of the Marathi Pandit tradition of grammarians coming down from the great Nāgeśabhaṭṭa down to the Abhyankar family. He was a great scholar and a wonderful kind person.
