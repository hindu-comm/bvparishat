Dear list

  

I have the following translations of the Jnanesvari

  

1\) Hindi translation by Pandit Raghunath Madhav Bhagade (1924, Indian Press, Prayag)

2\) English translation by Ramchandra Keshav Bhagwat (1979, Samata Books, Madras)

3\) Sanskrit verse translation by Mahadev Sharma Oka (1929, M P Oka, Poona)

  

I find that both the Hindi and English translations are more of bhavanuvada-s and are without the word-for-word meanings, which helps in appreciating the text. In this respect, the Sanskrit verse translation appears to be truer to the original text from the linguistic perspective.

  

Is there a good translation of the Jnanesvari in Hindi or English with word-for-word meanings? I may be asking for too much, but something that indicates the part of speech and details of root/lemma, inflection/conjugation, etc would be ideal.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
