Dear Dr. Deshpande,  
  
I am looking for softcopies of marathi translations of Dnyaneshwari by Sonopant Dandekar and Sakhare Maharaj but unfortunately the documents are not available on Web.  
  
I already have the hardcopy of Sonopant Dandekar's book at my home and can certainly purchase the other one locally.  
  
However, I travel a lot and find it difficult to carry the hardcopies on my journeys.  
  
I shall be obliged if you can share the pdf's with me on Google drive or otherwise.  
  
Thanking you,  
  
With warm regards,  
Anand Chapekar  
Pune, India
