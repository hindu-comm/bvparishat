Thanks a lot Professor Ji, the translation by Yardi is helpful. I would also appreciate if you could send the translations/commentaries by Dandekar and Sakhare. While my knowledge of Marathi is very basic, I can understand if the context is clear enough.

  

As an example from Jnanesvari, I am trying to get the essence of the word कवळले in 1.20:

अकार चरणयुगुल। उकार उदर विशाल। मकार महामंडल। मस्तकाकारे॥ १९ ॥

हे तिन्ही एकवटले। तेथ शब्दब्रह्म कवळले। ते मियां गुरूकृपा नमिले। आदिबीज॥ २० ॥

  

Molesworth Marathi-English dictionary gives the meaning of कवळणें as“to embrace”. The translations give the meaning of the verbal form variously. It would be great if you could throw some light here.

  

Bhagade: ये तीनों जहाँ एक होते हैं वहाँ वेद समाविष्ट हैं।

Bhagwat: The combination of these three syllables ... covers up and comprehends all the truth revealed as Divine word or word Absolute.

Oka: शब्दब्रह्म समाविष्टम्

Yardi: .. all these three are united in the sacred syallble Om, which encompasses all spiritual knowledge.

  

Bhagade and Oka both use समाविष्ट, which has the sense of entering, while Bhagwat and Yardi use encompass, which has the sense of enveloping/surrounding. I feel समाविष्ट (with the sense of entering) makes more sense if कवळणें is taken as “to embrace” (rather than “to surround”). However, as I do not know what all senses कवळणें is used in Marathi, I might be wrong.

  

Also note how the translations render मकार महामंडल मस्तकाकारे. I feel Bhagwat and Yardi have simplified a bit too much (grand crown/circular head) while Bhagade’s Hindi sounds faithful to the original text.  

Bhagade: और मकार मस्ताकाकार महामण्डल है

Bhagwat: while the syllable म the grand crown of his head.

Oka: मकारमस्तकोऽसि त्वम्

Yardi: and the letter m his circular head. \[!\]

  

Thanks, Nityananda
