This is Khasanis A.V. Translation of 1.19 &1.20  

19\. The syllable + forms two feet of lord Ganesha, the syllable उ forms his big belly, while  
the syllable म the grand head—  
20 Combination of all the three syllables makes ॐ and covers up, as well as  
comprehends, all the truth revealed as Divine word or the Absolute. I therefore bow  
down to this Ganesha in the form of Onkara, through the grace of good Guru , the  
primary seed of the entire Universe.
