Dear Nityanandji,

  

  I have sent the files for the Marathi tr/coms by separate email to you. The word समाविष्ट as used in Marathi has the sense of "included, collected" and the Sanskrit rendering of Jñāneśvarī is using this word in the Marathi meaning. The wordsतेथ शब्दब्रह्म कवळले to me mean "the Śabdabrahma appeared there in an encompassing form." The verb कवळणे has the sense of embracing, encompassing.
