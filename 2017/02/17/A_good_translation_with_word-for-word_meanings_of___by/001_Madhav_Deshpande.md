Dear Nityanandji,

  

Here is one more English translation of Jñāneśvarī by M.R. Yardi. But I don't know of any English translations that are word-for-word translations. There are some translations/commentaries in modern Marathi that come close to this description, especially one by Sonopant Dandekar, and another one by Nanamaharaj Sakhare. I have pdfs of both of these, and if you are able to read Marathi, I can send them to you through We-Transfer.
