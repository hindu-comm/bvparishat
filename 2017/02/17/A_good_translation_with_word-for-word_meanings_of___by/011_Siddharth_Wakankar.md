Suprabhat.

  

I faintly remember that one Shri Kumthekar has translated the Jnaneshvari in English in the last century,in 3 parts.Old libraries might possess them.You may inquire with the library of the Oriental Institute,Baroda,where it is housed.

Best luck in your search.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
