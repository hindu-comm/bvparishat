Thanks Ajitiji. Thanks for the suggestion. In DLI, I could find one edited by Bhandare and it has only two parvas. I need the Kavyamala edition published in 1898, which is complete. As regards the webmasters address of that particular site, can you please send the same to me? I understand that they acknowledged with thanks that they got quite some help from you some years ago.  
  

Regards,
