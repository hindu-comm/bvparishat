Dear shrI harunaga, the scan quality is just so much superior to the DLI scans! The volume 1 from DLI is especially poor. I wonder if your copies of volumes 1-3 are also of such similarly high resolution - I would be much obliged if you could share those too, so that we can retain the superior scans.
