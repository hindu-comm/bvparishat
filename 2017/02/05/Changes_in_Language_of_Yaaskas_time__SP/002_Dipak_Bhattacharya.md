\<Vedic vocables having **gh**, **bh**, and **dh** sounds have been reduced to **h** sound in the later period.>

Dear Dr. Joshi,

I agree with you excepting on Vedic velars having **gh**, **bh**, and **dh** sounds have been reduced to **h** sound in the later period. The general consensus among historical linguists is that there were two series of velars in the mother language – pure velars and palato velars. The former became palatals when followed by e and the letter became sibilants
