I don't follow the comment about "just requesting". Ideally, projects and data should be open source, obviating even the need to "request". If not, "requesting" should suffice.  
  
Of course, if there is a project of immediate mutual interest, I (or others) would be happy to collaborate. It is perhaps a good idea to advertise such projects on (say) the sanskrit programmers mailing list to see if there are takers.

Sometimes he does, sure. There was talk about making DCS open source ( <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sanskrit-programmers/Zdj80IzI--U/3tvh-F8xCAAJ> ) , and there seemed to be some warm response. Nothing after that - so I wonder if he's made up his mind.
