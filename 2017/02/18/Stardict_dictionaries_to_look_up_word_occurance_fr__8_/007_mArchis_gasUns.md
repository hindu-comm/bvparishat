Hello Madhav,

  

 If only we could have a conference or at least a call on the frequency data with those interested. It's too bad a German linguist is the only person in the world interested in a corpora of Sanskrit texts (as a corpora and not just a bunch of .txt files).

Vishvas, I would suggest we move to <https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/issues> and start working together. It's not just about requesting. Actually, Oliver answers emails as well, so a lot can be done, if there is more than me and him. Millions of Sanskrit related questions arise, proofreading is needed, but, again, nobody is around. Everybody is doing something on his own. I'm interested in frequency because of my dictionary and teaching needs, but that's a rather closed community.
