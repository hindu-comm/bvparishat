I don't have a Mac, but: Assuming that you're using a stardict-compatible dictionary program (such as the one suggested in a previous thread), you might need to "rescan the dictionaries" in some way from your dictionary program.  
  
In any case, if you find a solution, please let us know what it was (with the name and version of the program) for the benefit of other (future?) Mac users.
