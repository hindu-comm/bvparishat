Open source means there is a need. Without a need I prefer to spend time on printed books than on sharing hundreds of files, ideas related to Sanskrit.

The list seems rather dead, even Dhaval's posts which are easy to understand and contribute get no reaction. Let's try a Skype conference?

To makes up his mind I've been emailing him since 2010. Every year. A few times. It's not a matter of one email. Please write again. And one month after. I've been speaking on skype on that with him, asking people who meet him to remind that. It's you who can make warm hot and not he. He has enough of work already and he is all alone.
