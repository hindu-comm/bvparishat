If you say that 'misery is imagined', then it is contradictory to say that misery afflicts really.

Accepted. But, this imagination is not like 'planning the day'(which needs activity on part of person). But, it is superimposition on self due to ignorance of it's nature. I don't see any conscious activity involved here. Ignorance itself is enough for superimposition.

Imagination involves some conscious effort is not acceptable, just test your own dream.

Ignorance of waking stateand saMskAra-s are enough for that, in case of dream.

  

Ignorance is accepted as misery itself. But, that ignorance is again no real, but superimposed. So, this also doesn't make self really miserable.

This doesn't need separate solution since it assumes that conscious effort it needed for imagination, which is not acceptable.

Accepting ignorance superimposed is the solution.

Now, the question is why do we say ignorance superimposed?

For that, you need to start from beginning.

Any philosophy based on shAstra-pramANa, either advaita, vishiShTAdvaita or dvaita, is not some idea which can be know by pratyaxa, anumAna, etc. If you are a person who has yet not appreciated importance of veda-s in this regard, I fear that there is no way to make you understand at this point.

I have to first make you understand the quality of veda-s to generate valid perception. Once you understand that, you will be able to appreciate validity of advaita, dvaita or anything else.

Whatever logic is provided by teachers of those philosophies, was to remove siege caused by other veda-vAkya or pratyaxa or anumAna, etc.

Since all of them are pramANa, we try to find ways to avoid their conflicts.

When we do that in present case, it comes that every thing which is not brahman, is not real - is said by upaniShad(neti-neti). So, whatever it may be, either ignorance or it's effect, is not real.

Now, when we try to compare with other superimposition, we see some dissimilarities, and we try to show that those can't obstruct un-reality of world and ignorance. 

  

I'll suggest to take these queries to some forum which is dedicated to Advaita, since you will find more enthusiasts there.

A few are - Advaita-l, Advaitin Yahoo Group.

I think that these type of common question may be already replied in their archives.
