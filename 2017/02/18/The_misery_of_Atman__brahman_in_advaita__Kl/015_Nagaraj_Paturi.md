Misery or experiencing misery is an observation.

  

Who is the experiencer?

  

Atman.

  

So the observation turns out to be that 'Atman is experiencing misery'.

  

But 'Atman is free from misery' is the derived fact, derived from other evidences.

  

Since observation is contradicting the fact, it is posited that the problem should be with the observation. Observation being in contradiction with the fact is 'explained' as a result of false observation. It is explained that being trained to rightly observe helps in overcoming false observation. Once the training bears fruit, right observation results. Fact is observed. Contradiction between observation and fact gets dissolved.
