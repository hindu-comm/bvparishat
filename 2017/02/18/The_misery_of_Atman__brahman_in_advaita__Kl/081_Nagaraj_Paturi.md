Sri Kalyan K says:

  

These other evidences being Sruti, or more accurately, a particular interpretation of Sruti. It is considered a fact only if one believes in Sruti and also in such a particular interpretation of Sruti. Otherwise, 'Atman is free from misery' is not considered a fact.

  

'These evidences being S'ruti' is your ( hasty ) assumption about my intention behind my words, "other evidences"

  

"Atman is free from misery" is derived logically from the evidences of day to day experiences themselves.

  

When I say, " I am running fever", I mean that I am currently running fever. i know that I was free from fever. I shall be free from fever. I am not defined by fever. Fever is not my defining feature. I am by definition , free from any feature that is not my defining one.

  

Similarly when I say, I am experiencing misery, I mean that I am currently experiencing misery. That implies that I was free from misery and I shall be free from misery. I am not defined by my misery. i.e., I am not defined as misery - experiencer. Misery -experiencing is not my defining feature.

  

Obviously, I am free from any feature that does not define me.

  

Hence, I am free from misery.

  

= Atman is free from misery.  

  

Atman is free from misery is the fact thus derived.
