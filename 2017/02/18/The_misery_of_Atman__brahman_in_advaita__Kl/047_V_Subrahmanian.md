Sir, Late Sri Polagam Rama Sastri in his work 'चतुर्मतसारसङ्ग्रहः’ published by Srimad Appayya Dikshitendra Granthāvali Prakaśana Samiti, Hyderabad (Series - 6) has done some good ground work on this topic. He lists the common features of any two or three or four schools (including Srikantha's Śivādvaita school for which Sri Appayya Dikshita has written the Sivārkamaṇidīpikā) and for the last grouping of all four schools gives 51 items.

  

This list is found on pages 17 - 19 of the book. 

  

The project proposed by you is laudable and may be started in a new thread with an appropriate title. All those who wish to contribute material could do so in that thread.
