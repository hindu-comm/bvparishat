Sri Ajit,  
  
With all due respect, I did not understand your answer. Both #1 and #2 are assumptions of advaita. They are not my personal assumptions. As you have rightly observed, they are contradictory. But that only imples that advaita is contradictory since they are postulates of advaita.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
