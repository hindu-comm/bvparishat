Dr B S Ravindranath posted as follows:

  

Sir,

    Here Sri Kalyan had asked that the atman is misery as well as free at the same time, first one should know what is the matter atman and what are it's properties, so let's keep it simple in a classroom of 30 students and a teacher what is the status of a teacher to keep attention of the students towards him, do you call it a misery or free what one call it, I can call it as responsibility so I can call it as Atman is neither in misery nor free it is responsible for it's existence and that existence is recognized by the body.

  

Regards,

B S Ravindranath

Now we have a definition " Atman is neither in misery nor free it is responsible for its existence and that existence is recognized by the body. Comes very close to Charvakas definition
