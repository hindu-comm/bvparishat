Alright. I see the sense in which you have used the word Atman.

  

//But 'Atmanis free frommisery' is the derived fact, derived from other evidences.//

  

These other evidences being Sruti, or more accurately, a particular interpretation of Sruti. It is considered a fact only if one believes in Sruti and also in such a particular interpretation of Sruti. Otherwise, 'Atman is free from misery' is not considered a fact.

  

//Since observation is contradicting the fact, it is posited that the problem should be with the observation.//

  

But who is the observer? The observer is the Atman. If the Atman is subjected to erroneous observation, then the Atman is coming under ignorance. But Sruti (fact) says that Atman is not ignorant! So, positing that the problem is with the observation, is leading to another contradiction. We just moved from one contradiction to another.

  

//Once the training bears fruit, right observation results. Fact is observed. Contradiction between observation and fact gets dissolved//  

  

Future dissolution of the contradiction does not preclude its current existence. My point, is concerned with the current existence of the contradiction rather than its future dissolution. Further, what guarantees that once the contradiction is dissolved, it wont appear again? In simpler terms, what guarantees that the Atman does not come under ignorance again, after liberation?
