Dear Sri Kalyan,

  

I don't really see what I can add to this debate that has not already been discussed by many stalwarts for a long time now. All the questions you raise about duHkha, avidyA, the locus of avidyA, the object of avidyA, what is meant by mithyAtva, the role and ultimate failure of vAk and manas in apprehending the AtmA, etc etc have been analyzed threadbare over a thousand years or so.

  

All I would like to say at this point is that you must address two crucial points.

  

1\. whether it is acceptable to talk of different levels of reality, whereby only the highest level is really real and other levels necessarily partake of an element of unreality, and

2\. whether there is room for a reliance on anything other than logic (i.e. Sruti and smRti sources) when you discuss any issue in any kind of vedAnta.

  

That said, I'm not sure whether this is the right forum for a protracted debate on this topic, so I'll refrain from writing much more.



Best regards,  

Vidyasankar
