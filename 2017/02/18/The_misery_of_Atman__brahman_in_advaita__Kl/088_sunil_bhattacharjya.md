Dear friends,  
  

Permit me to add that there is another way also for looking at the
miseries. The miseries are related to the body, but we are not the bodies for ever, though we have it during our lifetime and discard one body for another at the end of the life time, and finally we can transcend the body and become videhamukta. Even in any life-time, when we are related to a particular body, the miseries are all in the mind.
In Mahabharata, Lord Krishna tells Bhishma that he should impart his vast knowledge to Yudhisthira and not allow that to be lost with his departure. Then Bhsihma said that he is miserable with his physical pain due to being on the bed of arrows, and he was in no position to do what the Lord wanted him to do. Then the Lord said that his pains will disappear and indeed the pains disappeared and Bhishma started answering all the queries of Yudhisthira.
