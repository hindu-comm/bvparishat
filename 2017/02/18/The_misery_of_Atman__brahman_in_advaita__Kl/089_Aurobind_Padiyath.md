Dear Kalyan K  
Your own statement // it is the Atman alone which can be in samsAra since It is the only conscious entity. To talk of samsAra for non-conscious entities like chairs and tables would make no sense //

1\. Can you please define your terminology of samsAra, Atman (both the free-Atman and misery-Atman)? so that we're on the same page.  
2. Does your above statement mean that samsAra is a conscious entity and chairs and tables are not? I don't get what you imply. (because, it is the Atman alone which can be in samsAra since It is the only conscious entity, is my stand also with a slight modification by replacing "can" with "appear to")

Please clarify before we proceed further.

Aurobind Padiyath
