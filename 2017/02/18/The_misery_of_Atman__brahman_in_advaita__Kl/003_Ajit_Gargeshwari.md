1 and 2 are not assumptions of Advaita. Advaita has no assumptions to start with. There is only one Brahman. The one appears to be many due to ignorance. Appearance is different from imagination. When there is only one from the without any beginnin or end why will advaita vada assume any misery and ignorance. Adavita Vedanta is not based on postulates.  The one Brahman is ever free and ever liberated.  

Atman or second entity is not there when there is no second entity how can a second entity imagine any misery  

Hence what you have proposed as Point 1 & 2 are contradictory and not Advaita.
