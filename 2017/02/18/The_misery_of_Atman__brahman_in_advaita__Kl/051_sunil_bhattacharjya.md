Dear Vidyashankarji,  
  

I think it is not easy to explain the Advaita position to all and it has been so even for many stawarts. One is drawn to arguments. **Adi Shankara, as I understand, believed that Shruti needed and there is no need to go to any dielectics**. However one may consider some similes to show the Advaitic position and the relevance of the Shruti-directions.
I remember a simile of the following type, The reproduction is not exact, but may give a hint. The Atman is the person at home yet unconfined (i.e. spread everywhere). and in a state of bliss. The Atman wants to become many and creates replicas, capable of intelligence and the Atman residing in a cavity inside a cavity inside the creation as well as outside. The intelligent replicas are fitted with coloured glasses (Maya) and see everything coloured and desire to explore and
have to take birth after birth, in different ways to fulfill their desires, and suffer miseries of facing the pleasures and the pains including the disappointments and the physical illnesses, and thus get exasperated .  
  
Some of the replicas find the shruti texts, which say that the life with the coloured glass is not the real existence and that all the miseries are due to coming under the influence of the coloured glass and the best way is to give up the glass with the required sadhanas and to get back to the original housee. Some others read the texts and surmise that their place is not inside the house, but they will be better off if they are near the house in their mind and get the grace of the one inside the house., while some others think that they are from inside but once out of the house they have no right to get back into the house and the only way left is to devote to the one inside the house. There are still others who read the texts and have different interpretations.  
  

As no simile can replicate the actual situation, I am aware this simili too will have inadequacies, but may give a hint to try to understand the Advaita position, where some think they have to go back to the house and the coloured views have been nothing but dreams with disconsolate consequences. May be you will like to refine this simili or may have a better simili to offer.  
  

Regards,
