I agree due to the mass of the literature that has grown around the primary vedantic texts reading one Paksha is often a life time challenge. By reading one Paksha one gets glimpses of the sound and perfect arguments of the other Paksha which is the beauty of Indian Philosophical systems which I feel no system in the philosophical
system in the world can provide. Every word, every sentence and even letter is so closely examined one feels that unless one is specialist one cannot even venture.  
  

The dialectics of Vyasatirtha and others is one of the finest specimens which any philosophical system can have is the opinion of Prof. Surndranth Das Gupta by one who wrote on different philosophical systems. How true his statement is.  
  

In my opinion There are no pakshas at all. All pakshas form a part of the integral whole which these systems of thoughts claim to show and the integral whole is mans eternal quest for knowledge.
