I believe we are deviating from the focus of this thread. On the above point, there are multiple interpretations. In advaita, Atman is both material and instrumental cause. In dvaita, Atman is just the instrumental cause. In most vedAntic schools, including bhedAbheda, dvaita, vishishTha-advaita, the world is real. However, a discussion on the various vedAntic view points, will span another thread.

Please see above. There are multiple senses in which the Atman is treated as a creator. Moreover, even in advaita, the Atman is ultimately denied of any creatorship.

But jIva is nothing but the Atman. All the upAdhis that constitute jIvatva are jaDa. The only conscious entity being Atman. So it should appear only to the Atman, and hence the Atman alone can be deluded. Shankara states in bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya 1.4.10, two points - brahman is not the author of ignorance, but no other conscious entity can be admitted to be the author of the ignorance. (Only God knows what such contradictory statements mean, since only a conscious entity can be an author of ignorance.)
