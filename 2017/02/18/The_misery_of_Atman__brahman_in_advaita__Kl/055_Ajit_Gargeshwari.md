Vidvan Kalyanji Namaste,

  

Before Vidyashankarji responds I have some questions

  

Dialectical method of argument if you are hinting are you prepared for dialectical method. Is this list suitable for such arguments .If you are convinced its fine with me but let me warn that such arguments on a list like this will take you no where. It will not answer your curious questions or will not prove the two contradicting points you posted st the very onset of this thread. Thanks
