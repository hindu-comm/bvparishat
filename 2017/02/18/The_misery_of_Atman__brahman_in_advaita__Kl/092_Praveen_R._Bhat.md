Namaste Siva Senani ji,

Very well said, Mahodaya. The world appears yellow to a jaundiced. There appear to be logical problems due to inherent misunderstanding of Advaita Vedanta. The Atman that is not really ignorant is in a different sattA than the sattA of imagination. The dreamer who is running away from the tiger is not the same waker that is sleeping in his cosy bed, but is not really non-different, else he would not wake up with a scare and sweating and remember the dream. There are no pAramArthikA examples possible, so what is prAtibhAsika dreamer to vyAvahArika waker, so is vyAvahArika jIvAtman to pAramArthika brahmAtman. So even if one stands on his head, one will not be able to prove \*real\* difference between free brahmAtman and bound jIvAtman waker, just as one won't be able to prove that waker and dreamer are \*really\* different. No matter how many times how many people ask across eras as to categorically assert whether one is bound or not bound, the answer will be the same: not really bound, but appears to be bound.
