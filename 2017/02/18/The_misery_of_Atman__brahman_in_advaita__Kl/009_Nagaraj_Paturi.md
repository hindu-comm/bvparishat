\>May I ask if heuristic explanations are allowed to contain contradictions in them? Only logical explanations are excluded from the burden of contradictions?

  

----- I did not say, heuristic explanations. I said heuristic concept. Heuristic concept is part of explanation. Explanation itself is logical. There are no two categories called heuristic and logical.

  

To use heuristic concepts to 'explain' apparent contradictions or to resolve appearanceof contradictions is in itself a logical method.
