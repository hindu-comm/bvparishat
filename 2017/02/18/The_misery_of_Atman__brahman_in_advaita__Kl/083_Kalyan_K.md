Sri Aurobind  
  
Pardon me for not responding to your previous mails. They are in my "to do" list.  
  
//I am giving stress to the words "somehow" which is never the words of Shastra//  
  
And yet, if someone goes by the advaitic interpretation of shastra, it is the Atman alone which can be in samsAra since It is the only conscious entity. To talk of samsAra for non-conscious entities like chairs and tables would make no sense. And yet we are told that Atman is ever free. So I said, being ever free, the Atman still \*somehow\* jumps into samsAra. This is a direct consequence of the advaitic position.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
