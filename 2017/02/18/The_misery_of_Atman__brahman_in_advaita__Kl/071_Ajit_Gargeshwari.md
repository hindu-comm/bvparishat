I don't want to again get back when I said good bye to this thread
though I should clarify.  
  
Two statements were made to show there is contradiction in adaviata.  
  

1\. The Atman is forever free from misery and ignorance

  

2\. The Atman imagines itself to be miserable even though it is in reality free from misery  
  

The contradiction in the above statement has been answered right from the beginning and has been clarified that this is not the position of advaita.  
  

Subsequently quotation from Karika Bhashayas were given to show that the point 2 is said in the karika bhashya. The Karikas and Bhashyas are based on an argument called shruti anukula tarka. Explanation was given that the karika bhashayas don't say so.  
  

When statement 2 was never the position of Advaita then whats there to debate.  
  
The thread initiator further said in a later post I am not unduly worried about whether or not the arguments here lead to a definite conclusion. (but yet I want to debate and argue)  
  
I was not harsh but wanted to say if you have an argument or a debate without seeking to establish ones own potion it is called Vitanda. Vada. In Vitanda Vada there is no learning involved.
