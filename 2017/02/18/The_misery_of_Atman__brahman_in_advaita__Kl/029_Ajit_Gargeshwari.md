I suggest you read the bhashyas without translation That is going to help. Maya is not Avidya. Maya and Avidya are are not equivalent terms or synonyms The bhashyakara doesn't say entire universe is imagined by atman. I don't read translations. Popular translation are useful but often bring in more doubts than clarifying doubts . I don't read the terms in isolation. I read the terms keeping the bhashya on Brahmasutra which will always always clarify doubts.  
  

Let me also add Maya is not the ista of the Bhashyakara unlike Ista Siddhikara for whom Maya is his Ista.  

  

Haven't you not answered your question by your own quotation of a translation The important phrase being 'the false notion of misery superimposed by ignorance' and the phrase 'self being imagine itself as misarable' is an approximate translation and is not be giving accurately the view of the bhashyakara.

  
  
//Objection: If the Supreme Self has no misery, and there is no other entity to be miserable, then it is useless for the scriptures to try to remove misery.  
  
Reply: Not so, for they are meant to remove the false notion of misery superimposed by ignorance. And the Self being admitted to imagine Itself as miserable, the scriptures help to remove that error, as in the case of the failure to count the tenth man, although he was there.\[11\]//  
  

Thanks again for bring out this discussion.
