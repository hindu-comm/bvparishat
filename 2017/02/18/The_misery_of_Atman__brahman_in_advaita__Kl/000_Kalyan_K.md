Namaste to all members here

  

I want to understand advaita better, especially since I seem to find that some of its teachings are contradictory. Hence I want to get the opinions from vidwans here who have a good understanding of advaita.

  

Let me sum up a key teaching of advaita first - In advaita, the Atman/brahman, which is of the nature of Ananda (bliss), and is forever free from all evil, misery and ignorance, and which is forever liberated in the past, present and the future, and which is free from all actions and agitations, somehow jumps into the samsAra (transmigration), by imagining Itself to be miserable and ignorant, even though it is neither miserable nor ignorant in reality. There is no other entity apart from the Atman Itself that can be affected by ignorance and misery, because the One Atman is the only conscious entity in advaita. Unlike sAmkhya, plurality of selves is not admitted in advaita.

  

Assuming that I have correctly summed up the advaitic position, we have two apparently contradicting characteristics of the Atman (which by the way is supposed to be free from all characteristics, Itself being nirvishesha) -

  

1\. The Atman is forever free from misery and ignorance

  

2\. The Atman imagines itself to be miserable even though it is in reality free from misery

  

Here comes the crux of my argument. Now, #2 above implies that the Atman is really affected by misery, since imagination of misery is also a form of misery. Let me illustrate this by an example. Mr. X is very rich, and has everything he needs and is otherwise a very happy person. But he has a little problem. He dreams every night that he is being chased by lions and tigers. Hence in his dreams he imagines himself to be miserable even though in his waking state he is free from all misery. But this very imagination of misery in his dreams naturally makes him miserable, at least during the duration of the dreams. Hence, an imagination of misery and ignorance is itself a form of misery and ignorance.

  

Hence, the Atman, which is free from misery, but only imagines itself to be miserable, is in fact really miserable just due to the fact of imagining itself to be miserable.

  

Thus, the Atman is both free from misery and also miserable at the same time, which is a contradiction.

  

Let us take this one step further. The Atman is free from actions (nishkriya) and tranquil/unagitated (shAntam) by its very nature. Imagination requires actions and agitations in the form of thoughts. How then does the Atman get the capacity to imagine something in the first place? If it is said that this capacity is due to avidya (ignorance), then it is a direct admission that the Atman, which by nature is free from ignorance, is also the biggest ignoramus. This leads us to another contradiction.

  

How are these contradictions resolved by advaita? Please help me understand.

  

Warm regards

Kalyan
