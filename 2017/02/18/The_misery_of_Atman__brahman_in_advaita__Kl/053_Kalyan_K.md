Dear Sri Vidyasankar Sir, the analogy of Mr. X shows that an imagined misery makes one miserable in reality also. Same goes with imagined ignorance. If one imagines oneself to be ignorant when one is not really ignorant, then it means one is \*actually\* ignorant because one does not know that one is not ignorant. So imagined ignorance and imagined misery makes one really ignorant and miserable.

  

Having said this much, I will temporarily not pursue this point further, because I have something else to add. Which brings me to your next statement -

Let us say that the state of experiencing misery is merely a superimposition, as you mention. Who is doing this superimposition? The Atman itself must do this superimposition, for there is no other entity to do this superimposition. And this superimposition is due to the Atman's ignorance alone. Hence, we face the same situation - the Atman is both ignorant and knowledgeable at the same time.

  

Let us take this one step further. Let me temporarily refrain from asking the question "whose ignorance". It is somebody's ignorance and right now we are not interested in who this somebody is. The superimposition, that leads to experiencing misery, must be caused by ignorance (avidya). Let us call this ignorance # 1. Now is ignorance # 1 real? No. If it is real, then there is no advaita as both Atman and ignorance # 1 would be equally real. Hence ignorance # 1 itself must be superimposed by another ignorance # 2. And ignorance # 2 must be superimposed by another ignorance # 3 and so on ad infinity. 

  

Best regards

Kalyan
