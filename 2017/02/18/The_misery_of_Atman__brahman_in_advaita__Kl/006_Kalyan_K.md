#1 is an assumption of advaita, based on Sruti teachings that Atman is forever liberated and it is repeated many times in Shankara bhAshyas. As an example you can see bhAshya of Shankara on brihadAraNyska upanishad 1.4.7.  
  
#2 is an assumption of advaita, as also stated by Shankara himself in his bhAshya on brihadAraNyaka upanishad 1.4.7. I invite you to read this part of his bhAshya. This is also stated in the Gaudapada karika-  
  
  
mAyaiShA tasya devasya yayA sammohitaH svayam \|\|  
  
So both #1 and #2 form part of the siddhAnta of advaita.  
  
You claim that the One brahman appears as many due to ignorance. May I ask \*whose\* ignorance? If brahman is the only conscious entity in advaita, then only brahman can be affected by ignorance.  
  
I request you that in future, you please give references from bhAshyas of Shankara to prove your point. Otherwise, this discussion will not go anywhere.
