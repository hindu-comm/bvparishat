Dear Sri Nagaraj

  

I have seen lot of constructive and destructive debates and as far as this particular debate is concerned, I have tried my best to keep it constructive and impersonal and purely based on logical lines. I have also exercised restraint in the face of personal attacks by Sri Ajit, some of whose posts, the moderators should not have approved in the first place, given that the list policies state that personal attacks are a discouraged form of communication. It is also my past experience that personal attacks happen when the other party runs out of logical arguments. Hence, I asked a rhetorical question to Sri Ajit alone. I did not mean that other members who are party to this debate will not be able to come up with convincing answers. I hope that clarifies my stand.

  

Regards

Kalyan
