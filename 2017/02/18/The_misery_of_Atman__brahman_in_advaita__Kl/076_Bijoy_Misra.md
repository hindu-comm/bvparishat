Friends,

While I appreciate the curiosity and zeal of debate in people, the thread never produced an answer.

This is typical of a classroom discussion in a western university. The "teachers" in such framework

then proceed to explain the terms for the "benefit" of the youth. I suggest that the philosophic terms

on "non-existence" be appreciated internally through sufficient reflection than attempted in "words".

We are entering intoशब्दजाल as the philosopher had warned! Please deal the concept from a

cosmological point of view.

Regards,

BM
