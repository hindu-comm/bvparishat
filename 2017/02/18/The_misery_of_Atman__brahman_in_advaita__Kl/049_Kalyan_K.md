Dear Sri Vidyasankar  
  
I want to make a limited point here, defending my conclusion, since you say it is erroneous.  
  
//The conclusion, "Thus, the Atman is both free from misery and also miserable at the same time, which is a contradiction" is erroneous.  
  
Going back to your analogy, Mr. X is not miserable and free from misery at the same time.//  
  
Yes, I understand that in the analogy, Mr.X is not miserable and free from misery at the same time. The timings are different.  
  
However, the same cannot be said of the Atman. The Atman is \*eternally\* free from misery according to advaita. And the same Atman is miserable when It imagines Itself to be miserable. Hence, for the duration that It imagines Itself to be miserable, my conclusion holds - the Atman is both miserable and free from misery at the same time.  
  
I will read the portions of Shankara bhAshyas that you mentioned. Thanks for the help with the references.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
