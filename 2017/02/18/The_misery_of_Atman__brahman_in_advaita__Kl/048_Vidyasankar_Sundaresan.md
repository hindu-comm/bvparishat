The conclusion, "Thus, the Atman is both free from misery and also miserable at the same time, which is a contradiction" is erroneous.

  

Going back to your analogy, Mr. X is not miserable and free from misery at the same time. He imagines his misery only in the dreaming state, not in the waking state. These are different times, when he is free from misery and when he imagines his own misery. Even in his dreaming state when he dreams of being chased by lions or tigers, the consequent misery is born out of his own imagination, not due to a cause external to himself. It doesn't adversely affect the reality of the waking state, as it is a self-created delusion that ends when he wakes up. As to how and why he dreams thus when he goes to sleep, perchance to dream, only Mr. X can answer, not a Ms Y or Z.

  

Nevertheless, if he somehow manages, within his dream, to set aside his own ignorance and remember that he is free from misery, that these lions and tigers are nothing more than creatures of his own imagination and that he really has no valid reason to be miserable and afraid of them, he could easily stop dreaming and get into restful, deep sleep, or perhaps wake up completely. Or else, he could perhaps simply watch the lions and tigers in his dream, without thereby feeling miserable about it.

  

May I recommend a close reading of SankarAcArya's gItAbhAshya 13.2, where he addresses this question? Read especially the concluding portion of the commentary on this verse, from 

  

अत्रआह—साअविद्याकस्यइति।यस्यदृश्यतेतस्यएव।कस्यदृश्यतेइति।अत्रउच्यते— ‘अविद्याकस्यदृश्यते?’इतिप्रश्नःनिरर्थकः।कथम्?दृश्यतेचेत्अविद्या,तद्वन्तमपिपश्यसि।नचतद्वतिउपलभ्यमाने‘साकस्य? ’इतिप्रश्नोयुक्तः।  
  
This will not necessarily convince you of the correctness of the advaita position, but it will help elucidate why it is not a logical contradiction the way you portray it to be. Another key reading would be SankarAcArya'scommentary on the kartradhikaraNa and the takshAdhikaraNa of the brahmasUtra (2.3.33 to 2.3.40)

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
