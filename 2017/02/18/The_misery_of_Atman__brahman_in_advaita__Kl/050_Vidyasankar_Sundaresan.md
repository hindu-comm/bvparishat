The point is, this misery, being only imagined, is not real. So we do not describe the Atman as being simultaneously the locus of two equally real yet contradictory attributes. As per the advaita interpretation, the experience of an imagined misery does not partake of the same nature of reality as the real lack of misery that is the intrinsic nature of Atman/brahman.

  

Therefore, it is concluded that the state of experiencing the misery is merely a superimposition, and that in the state of experiencing the imagined misery, the real nature of the Atman, as being fundamentally free of duHkha, is only temporarily obscured from itself. Because, ayam AtmA brahma, ekam evAdvitIyam, yatra tvasya sarvam AtmaivAbhUt, ajnAnenAvRtaM jnAnam, kshetrajnaM cApi mAm viddhi, etc. The advaita position is not derived from our usual logic, but is based on what is said in Sruti and smRti about the AtmA. Logic and reasoning are employed to provide a framework to interpret these sources.

Vidyasankar
