Your questions :  
Let me sum up a key teaching of advaita first - In advaita, the Atman/brahman, which is of the nature of Ananda (bliss), and is forever free from all evil, misery and ignorance, and which is forever liberated in the past, present and the future, and which is free from all actions and agitations, somehow jumps into the samsAra (transmigration), by imagining Itself to be miserable and ignorant, even though it is neither miserable nor ignorant in reality. There is no other entity apart from the Atman Itself that can be affected by ignorance and misery, because the One Atman is the only conscious entity in advaita. Unlike sAmkhya, plurality of selves is not admitted in advaita.  
  
Assuming that I have correctly summed up the advaitic position, we have two apparently contradicting characteristics of the Atman (which by the way is supposed to be free from all characteristics, Itself being nirvishesha) -  

  
1. The Atman is forever free from misery and ignorance  
  
2. The Atman imagines itself to be miserable even though it is in reality free from misery  
  

Here comes the crux of my argument. Now, #2 above implies that the Atman is really affected by misery, since imagination of misery is also a form of misery. Let me illustrate this by an example. Mr. X is very rich, and has everything he needs and is otherwise a very happy person. But he has a little problem. He dreams every night that he is being chased by lions and tigers. Hence in his dreams he imagines himself to be miserable even though in his waking state he is free from all misery. But this very imagination of misery in his dreams naturally makes him miserable, at least during the duration of the dreams. Hence, an imagination of misery and ignorance is itself a form of misery and ignorance.  
  
Hence, the Atman, which is free from misery, but only imagines itself to be miserable, is in fact really miserable just due to the fact of imagining itself to be miserable.  

  
Thus, the Atman is both free from misery and also miserable at the same time, which is a contradiction.  
  

My understanding :  
somehow jumps into the samsAra - - - - is a wrong assumption. The Advaita approach is that during the JAGRAT avastha "alone" the Jeeva-Atma is identifying itself as the Samsara inflicted due to the quality of the equipment (upadhi) i. e. Intellect, budhi. The other two avastha like dream and deep sleep the absence of this budhi does not cause concern, but still experiences a separation and identification with the body. Here you have to give importance to the quality of the upadhi. Sun light falls everywhere at all times(relatively - just for example) yet the effects of the light varies depending on the surface it falls. Can you say since it fell on dirty surface it has become dirty and non-reflective and on a clear surface it is reflective? The very nature of the light it has never lost at any point of time, past-present-future. Here the dirty surface represents the AjnAni and reflective surface represents the jnAni. As long as it reflects the quality of the surface will determine the effect.  
  
Your quote of KArika verses refers to JeevAtma which is imagining and not Paramatman. One is the reflected Consciousness (upAdhi grastha) and the other the ParamAtman (AvikAri).  
Then the next question can come, if that being the case is the upAdhi different from the Atma? The answer is no. The same jeevAtma suffered from the jAgrat is enjoying in deep sleep and and a mixture of both in the dreams. Here to know the nature of upAdhi analysis of the experiences of all the states are required. Is there anything else other than "experiencing" in all the three states? If they really existed those objects should also be available in all the three states. But what remains all through is only the JeevAtma who's nature is of pure experience, but when associated with the three different upAdhi, it calls itself as dreamer etc. The Sun never became the dirty pond or the clean mirror or the water or mountain. But what we see are only the Sun in the form of light whatever it is. Similarly whatever we are and whatever we experience is nothing other than the consciousness. Karika says it as Turiya spandanam, meaning that the effects are ripples of the Pure Consciousness. The ripple is not different at any point of time from the consciousness.  
  
You mixed up the word Atma in two separate contexts as the same. The unaffected is paramatman and the deluded is jeevAtma.  
You may next ask why is then these are happening? To answer that the KArika says "devasya esha Swabhavah". Does the water in anyway effected if it fills up during the high tide a small area on the beach which drys up to merge with the same ocean later? As long as it identifies with the limitations of the pond the limitations are superimposed until the merger with the ocean. But even when it is in the pond and "knows" it's real nature is of the Ocean the limitations do not inflict.  
In the case of the jeevAtma one can ask how is this happening? For that there are various approaches (prakriyas) according to various traditions. You can choose what appeals to you.  
Hope, without confusion and usage of the technical terms, I've answered the question. You should be careful with technical words as they are system specific and can misguide if not guided by a proper teacher. That is why the importance of the traditional teaching methods. One can get a broad concept by reading the translations but will not be able to take you to the final state of establishing in clear understanding.
