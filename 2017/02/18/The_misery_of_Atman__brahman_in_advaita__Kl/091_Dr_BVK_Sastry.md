Namaste



On Sri Bijoy Misra ji’s note: \< We are entering intoशब्दजाल as the philosopher had warned! Please deal **the concept from acosmological point of view**. Regards, BM >



Let me draft a question to facilitate such a pursuit, and get the needful clarifications.



I begin with a set of statements, leading to the ‘Question-logic-Articulation’:



**Statement 1 (Experience) **: I ( /We / anyone with a set of sense organs and mind functioning) **observe –perceive -** **experience** a ground on which I /we are standing and the space around this ground where observer are positioned. 



**Statement 2 ( Need ) : **I ( /We) desire to understand the Truth of all these - ‘Cosmologically / Cosmos- logically’, the ‘ Reality of Experience’.





**Statement 3 ( Vocabulary / Shabda – Jaala ) : **TERMS and EXPLNATIONS
inherited from texts : 



- The term for I /We is ‘ Aham / Vayam. The term shifts bring in the issue of individual and group experience analysis challenges.

- The term for sense organs and mind functioning is ‘ Indriya –Manas - Prakriyaa’.

- The term for experience is ‘ anubhava’. The term for perceiving is ‘ darshana’ ( in a limited sense, as ‘ pashyAmi/ pashyAmaH).

- The term for ground is ‘ PruthvI’ ; The term for space around is ‘ aakaasha/ Kham’

- The term for ‘ observer is ‘ draShTA’. 

- The term for Consciousness –Reality is ‘Brahma’ { Satyam,
Sat, Chit,} .



- The texts of Upanishads explaining the relations and experience-processes in statement -1 above hypothesize at some stage of analysis that the observer, the ground on which one is standing, the space surrounding, the process are all ‘ Transformations related to Consciousness’.( Chit- PariNAma). The text specific for the context is Gita 7-4: bhumir *apo* '*nalo vayuh* kham mano buddhir eva ca ahankara itiyam me bhinna prakrtir astadha.



**Question- Logic Articulation : ****When I see these as distinct different entities and processes, at what state and stage, and How, these ‘Cosmological Conscious Entity-Layers and Processes’ are formed and ‘Experienced as My Mind-Processes’ ? In other words, what is the tag to distinguish the layers, phases and processes of Consciousness-Dynamics ? in relation to observer ? **

****

I as an ‘ observer-analyst’ see each entity and process in statement -1 above, namely the ground, the space surrounding, myself and experience of observation –memory-recall as information to be : Discrete, Finite, Bound in Time-Space-Energy dynamics of Cosmos, each belonging to different categorizations’ and using different terms and explanations. Each one carries its unique properties and propensities (GuNa –Dharma / swabhaava / Prakruti).



In modern physics, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is discussed together with another postulate called the observer effect. This postulate notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing something in a system. Heisenberg offered such an observer effect at the quantum level as a physical "explanation" of quantum uncertainty. It has since become clear, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology. It must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.



Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program. These include, for example, tests of number–phase uncertainty relations in superconducting or quantum optics systems. Applications dependent on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low-noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave interferometers.



**Plausible outcomes of further discourse on this Question- Logic:
**

Option 1: One may trash this line of investigation saying Eastern Vedanta and Western Science address different paradigms and use different terms. There is no need to mix them.

Option 2 : Force Traditional terms as ‘Catch All phrases’ to claim (Advaita and all other flavors of ) Vedanta to be a better explanation of ‘Consciousness –Cosmo-Logic’.

Option 3: Engage interactively in to further \< शब्दजाल \> and find ingenious ‘ Vedic Science explanations’ for ‘ Planks Constant, Thermodynamics, Fundamental particles and Entropy.





**I look forward for scholars inputs, as this deliberation may help in unveiling the ‘ Nature of Observer / Experience and Process of Consciousness –Transformation Dynamics’. Whatever emerges as explanation in this case, would also get extended to the classical cases like ‘ rajju –sarpa, Kha- pushpa, vandhyaa-suta, shukti-rajata; dealing with ‘ avidyaa / mAyA’ explanations.**
