Dear Shri Kalyanji,  
  

Shri Ajitji is right. The Maya is not Avidya. Maya is both Vidya and Avidya. With his Maya the Lord Krishna himself appeared to us in Sattvaroopi and gave us the guidance through the Bhagavad Gita, the Uttara Gita and the Uddhave Gits etc. He was the Brahman who wanted to be many and He Himself takes his avataras to guide us from time to time.  
  

We are the many that came form One (Him) and we are led by our desires and we get more and more entangled in the Samsara and take many births to fulfill our desires. Those of us who desire to go back to the pristine state have to get over the attachments and take His guidance. :Lord Krishna very clearly stated that people get Him the way the people desire. The Advaitins want to go back to the state of oneness with Him. The Vishishtadvaitins do not think that the oneness with Him is possible and they desire to devote to him as separate, thinking that though they are part of Him they are destined to stay separate from Him. The Dvaitins think the the Lord is separate and they are dependent on Him for ever.  
  
Shri Gauapadacharya and Adi Shankara appeared more than two thousand years ago and they taught us the Advaitic concept as taught in the Upanishads and which is in line with what the Lord said in His Gita. Other spiritual Stalwarts like Shri Ramanujacharya and Shri Madhvacharya had taught their Vishishtadvaita and the Dvaita views, according to their interpretation of the Veda,Vedanta and Gita. In this modern age Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa said that the Dvaiata, Vishishtadvaita and the Advaita are all correct and there is only their different levels of perception.  
  

Hope this clarifies.  
  

Best
