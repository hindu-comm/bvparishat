There are two aspects here. Language is not adequate to describe Atman / Brahman and every description lands at a seeming contradiction (how is language supposed to operate when the difference of kartaa, karma, kaarana, kaarya, kriyaa etc. is not there?).

  

Second, the world has worked out a way to operate with these limitations, which Bhartrihari's analysis of language shows. It may be pointed out that Bhartrihari has taken a sentence which does not deal with Brahman, so that principle of interpretation stands on general grounds and not only while describing Brahman.

  

And, due to the reasons cited, there is nothing inherently contradictory in the position of Advaita.
