Sri Ajit  
  
Yes, the bhAshya on both the upanishad and karika mean that the Atman imagines itself to be deluded. In the case of the upanishad, if you read the prior bhAshya, Shankara denies that the Atman is affected by misery. The opponent argues that if there is no misery, then scripture, which serves the purpose of removing misery is useless. Shankara replies that the Atman imagines itself to be miserable. Here is the relevant translation by Swami Madhavananda of the portion quoted by me -  
  
<http://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117939.html>  
  
  
//Objection: If the Supreme Self has no misery, and there is no other entity to be miserable, then it is useless for the scriptures to try to remove misery.  
  
Reply: Not so, for they are meant to remove the false notion of misery superimposed by ignorance. And the Self being admitted to imagine Itself as miserable, the scriptures help to remove that error, as in the case of the failure to count the tenth man, although he was there.\[11\]//
