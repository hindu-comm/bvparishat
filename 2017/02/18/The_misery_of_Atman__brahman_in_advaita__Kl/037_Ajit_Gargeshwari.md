Primary position of Advaita needs to be clearly understood. Then one goes in to prakarnas bhashyas and other literature. This is similar to studying any philosophical system may it be Sankhya, Yoga Mimasa Nyaya Bouddha etc Why vedanta all shastras should be studied under a qualified teacher. ( By qualified teacher I don't mean to say a monk or so called practitioners) Why Shastras even science and engineering has to be studied the way it has to be. One can learn the formal, traditional or informal way.  

It best not be preachy ans say learn under a guru etc.....Advaita as a Shastra can be self studied or studied under a knowledgeable person who knows adavita including in this list
