Sri Aurobind. Samsara = transmigration, Atman is that which has been described as "neti neti". Or you can follow the second brahmasUtra and say that Atman is that from which the origin etc. of the world proceed.

No. It means that only conscious entities can be in samsara. It is meaningless to say that chairs and tables can be in samsara because they are not conscious entities.

Appears to whom? To whom does it appear that the Atman alone is in samsara?
