I was almost waiting for this kind of response. Whenever someone asks genuine questions, they are given such gratuitous advice. Such gratuitous advice kills the spirit of enquiry. This is part of the reason why I do not post questions on advaita forums, having tasted such gratuitous advice in the past.
