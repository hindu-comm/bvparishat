//Samsara = transmigration,// is it an independent reality having a सत्ता of it's own? Or is it part and parcel of the world प्रपञ्चम्?  
  
  
//Atman is that which has been described as "neti neti". Or you can follow the second brahmasUtra and say that Atman is that from which the origin etc. of the world proceed.//  
When the origin of the world is from Atman, all that is out of it should necessarily be Atman itself? कार्यकारणतया । वाचारंभणं विकारो नामधेयं।  
  
//It means that only conscious entities can be in samsara. It is meaningless to say that chairs and tables can be in samsara because they are not conscious entities.//  
  
If everything, meaning the प्रपञ्चम्, has come out of the same Atman how can there be different products other than their names and forms. Immaterial what they exhibit or behave. That means every moment of experience, the objects and the subject are not independent realities but of the same Atman called by different names and having different appearance. अनन्यत्वं & अद्वयत्वं  
  
  
//Appears to whom? To whom does it appear that the Atman alone is in samsara?//  
  
To the Jeeva, who has no knowledge of the truth of it's reality that he and what is not him all are essentially from the same source. That includes everything from his intellect to everything conceivable to him. प्रतिबोधम् ।।
