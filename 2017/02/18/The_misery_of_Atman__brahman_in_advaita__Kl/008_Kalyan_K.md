Dear Sri Nagaraj  
  
If I understand you correctly, then none of what I have written in the original post is the true position of advaita, but it just represents a heuristic explanation of our current state. May I ask if heuristic explanations are allowed to contain contradictions in them? Only logical explanations are excluded from the burden of contradictions?  
  
Regards  
  
Kalyan
