It will be a great help to those who are interested in Vedanta and mostly into the initial stage of self-study.

But we will encounter some issues like e.g

The words Indra, PrAna, Manas, and Atma are interchangeably used in Upanishads. These will have to be addressed with the relevant portion of the Shastra in explanatory notes.

To begin with the project there are books which have published these as appendix of the original work for newcomers as references. A compilation of these will be a better place to start.
