'Atman' is the third person form of the first person expression 'aham'.

There is no need to separately observe or infer Atman.

  

'He is experiencingMisery(or anything like that)'is an observation from outside.

  

But 'I am experiencing' is not an observation from outside. It is a self-referring first person expression.

  

Conversion of that into third person turns out to be 'self is experiencing misery (or anything like that)' which when 'self' is replaced by its Sanskrit equivalent 'atman' , it turns out to be 'Atmanis experiencing misery (or anything like that)'

  

Thus 'Atmanis experiencing misery' (= I am experiencing misery) is not an observation from outside, but observation nevertheless.
