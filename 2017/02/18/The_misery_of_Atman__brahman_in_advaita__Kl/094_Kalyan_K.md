As long as there is evidence for the existence of different levels of reality, I see no reason why one cannot talk about them, if one has presented such evidence. Having said that, I have noticed during my readings of Shankara bhAshyas, that Shankara himself seldom talks about various levels of reality with a few exceptions here and there. You can correct me if I am wrong here.

Yes, there is definitely room for Shruti and smRti, but I believe any interpretation of such sources must not contradict logic and perception. There is a well known saying that thousands of Shruti statements cannot make fire as cold.

  

Since I have answered your questions, I request a favor. Please answer one of my questions. When Shankara has employed logic to argue against nyAya, vaisheshika, sAMkhya, mImAmsa, bauddha and other such schools, is it improper to employ logic against advaita? I have noticed that whenever a logical contradiction is brought against the advaita school, people are immediately charged with "not understanding advaita". Is it ok if other schools make similar charges against Shankara and his disciples? For example, can the bauddha charge Shankara with not understanding Buddhism? Or is there anything special about advaita that it is above all scrutiny?

  

Regards

Kalyan
