This is stated by Shankara here:

  

Br.up. Bhashyam 1.4.7:

  

  

प्रत्यक्षानुमानविषययोश्च दुःखात्मनोर्गुणगुणित्वे न अनुमानम् ; *दुःखस्य नित्यमेव प्रत्यक्ष**विषयत्वा**त् ; रूपादिसामानाधिकरण्याच्च* ; मनःसंयोगजत्वेऽप्यात्मनि दुःखस्य, सावयवत्वविक्रियावत्त्वानित्यत्वप्रसङ्गात् ।

  

Swami Madhavananda:

  

...for misery is always an object of perception (being perceived) and abides in the same substance (body) that has form or colour. Even if the misery of the Self is said to be due to Its contact with the mind (as the vaśeṣika-s say), it would make the Self a thing wh!ch has parts, is changeful and transitory, for no attribute is ever seen to come or go without making some change in the substance connected with it. And a thing which has no part' is never seen to change, nor is an eternal entity seen to possess transitory attributes.....Therefore the Self cannot be proved to have transitory

attributes like misery.

  

Objection: If there is no other entity to be miserable, then it is

useless for the scriptures to try to remove misery.

  

Reply*: Not so, for they are meant to remove*

*the false notion of misery superimposed by ignorance.*

And the Self being admitted to imagine Itself as miserable,

the scriptures help to remove that error, as in the

case of the failure to count the tenth man, although  

he was there.

  

  

In the above extract from the bhashya, Shankara says:

  

1.  Misery is an object of experience, the observed, different from the
    experiencer, the observer. 2.  This experiencer is none other than the Self. 3.  It is viṣaya-viṣayi bhāva that is stated here. The observer is
    always distinct from the observed 4.  Granting that misery is of the self, being part of it, then the Self
    can't be an eternal one since that which transforms (due to misery)
    and has parts, is perishable. The Self is not admitted to be of this
    nature in the Vedanta. Thus, on logical grounds Shankara refutes the
    idea that misery is of/belongs to the Self.
5.  Misery is a superimposition in the Self.
6.  That which is a superimposition is not the attribute of the Self.

In fact the very 13th chapter of the Gita has come to make clear this viveka, distinction, between the Self and the not-self. And while stating what the not-self is, the verse 13.6 says:

  

Shankara introduces this verse thus:

  

अथ इदानीम् आत्मगुणा इति यानाचक्षते वैशेषिकाः तेपि क्षेत्रधर्मा एव न तु क्षेत्रज्ञस्य इत्याह भगवान् -

  

In order to show that those attributes that the Vaiśeṣika-s hold as belonging to the Atman, are not so but they belong to the not-self, the Lord says:

इच्छा द्वेषः सुखं दुःखं सङ्घातश्चेतना धृतिः।

एतत्क्षेत्रं समासेनसविकारमुदाहृतम्॥ ६ ॥

  

Desire, hatred, happiness, misery, etc. are all kshetram, not-self, which is a product of transformation.

  

सा इयं इच्छा अन्तःकरणधर्मः ज्ञेयत्वात् क्षेत्रम्। तथा द्वेषः, यज्जातीयमर्थं दुःखहेतुत्वेन अनुभूतवान् , पुनः तज्जातीयमर्थमुपलभमानः तं द्वेष्टि ; सोऽयं द्वेषः ज्ञेयत्वात् क्षेत्रमेव। तथा सुखम् अनुकूलं प्रसन्नसत्त्वात्मकं ज्ञेयत्वात् क्षेत्रमेव। दुःखं प्रतिकूलात्मकम् ; ज्ञेयत्वात् तदपि क्षेत्रम्।  

  

Shankara employs the logic, reasoning, that is most familiar to Vedantins: jñeyatvāt. That which is observed/known/experienced is non-ātman, kshetram. And therefore not of the Self. Misery is one such and hence is not of the Self, the kshetrajna, Ātman, observer/knower/experiencer.  

  

The method Shankara teaches to overcome all afflictions, samsara, is: This samsara is an object of experience, observed, dṛśya, for/by Me, the Atman, who am different from it. Hence it is not My attribute; it is of the not-self, dṛṣyatvāt, mithyā, svapnavat.

  

Shankara says this very clearly in the BGB 2.16 too:

  

नहिशीतोष्णादिसकारणंप्रमाणैर्निरूप्यमाणंवस्तुसद्भवति। विकारोहिसः,विकारश्चव्यभिचरति।  

  

Heat, cold, etc. (dualities) that are endowed with a cause, and are proven by pramāṇa-s, pratyaksha, instruments of knowledge, cannot be real. They are transformations and are bound to change. (And what changes is not real on the authority of the Vācārambhaṇa shruti of the Chandogya). Hence also they are not of the Atman. Here as well Shankara employs the dṛṣyatva hetu (observed) to hold that they do not belong to the Self, which is the draṣṭā, observer.

  

In fact in the very opening sentence of the Sutra bhashya Shankara has laid down this rule: that which are opposed to each other cannot be in one locus: viṣaya-viṣayi, like light and darkness, the chit and achit......If they appear to be together then it is concluded that such a combination is a product of error. ....Atman is chit and misery is achit. Hence in Advaita the two are never admitted to be together. In fact the Atman is satya and misery is anṛta. Satya and anṛta cannot be together. It is only to remove the erroneous thinking that they are together that the śāstra endeavors. 

  

What has been stated above is a sample from the prasthāna traya bhāṣya of Shankara.
