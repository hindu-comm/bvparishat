Dear Sri Kalyan K,

  

Let us take the following example:

  

A Scientist knows that the object in front of him is made up of certain chemical substances, each of which is,at an atomic level made up of atoms of certain elements combined in certain ratios and each of the atoms turn out to be atoms of the respective elements only on account of different configurations of the subatomic entities which themselves are certain configurations of charge and mass. But he does not 'see' all these details every time he sees the object. He employs the two kinds of 'seeing' this object prudently depending on the context. If he considers one of the two 'forms' of the object : the outer , visible/tangible/cognizable form and the inner invisible / noncognizable form as truer than the other, then he needs an heuristic concept to 'explain' why he is seeing the less truer form.

  

Similarly Advaitin who 'knows' (at least as guided by statements such as Ekamevaadvitiiyam Brahma Sarvam khalvidam brahma etc. .) that everything including 'himself', (his self ) has to be one and the only unique entity, needs a heuristic concept to 'explain' why he sees himself as different from the rest. 'imagines' 'dreams' 'illusion' 'magic' etc. are those heuristic concepts used to 'explain'.
