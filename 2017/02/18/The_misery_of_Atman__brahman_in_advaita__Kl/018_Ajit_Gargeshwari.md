Sure the points he raised are very important. Thank you for allowing this discussion.  
  
I would like to know where Kalpanika vada has been proposed or Atman imagines itself to be miserable is proposed?  
  
One finds Abhasa vada, Vivarta Vada, Pratibimba Vada are found in Adavita school. Arambha Vada Parinama Vada are not Advatic views.

  
Adhyasa

Here is a translation by Swamy Gambhirananda  
  
It being an established fact that the object and the subject, that are fit to be the contents of the concepts "you"  
and "we" (respectively), and are by nature as contradictory as light and darkness, cannot logically have any identity, it follows  
that their attributes can have it still less. Accordingly, the superimposition of the object, referable through the concept  
"you", and its attributes on the subject that is conscious bynature3 and is referable through the concept "we" (should be  
impossible), and contrariwise the superimposition of the subject and its attributes on the object should be impossible. Nevertheless, owing to an absence of discrimination between these attributes, as also between substances, which are absolutely disparate,there continues a natural human behaviour based on self-identification in the form of "I am this" or "This is mine" This behaviour has for its material cause an unreal nescience and man resorts to it by mixing up reality with unreality as a result ofsuperimposingthe things themselves or their attributes on each other.
