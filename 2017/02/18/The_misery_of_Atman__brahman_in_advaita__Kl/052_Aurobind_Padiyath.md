Shastra never takes a stand or uses words like  
1. Kalyanji's - somehow jumps into the samsAra (transmigration)  
Or  
2. Vidyasankarji's - As to how and why he dreams thus when he goes to sleep, perchance to dream, only Mr. X can answer, not a Ms Y or Z.  
Nevertheless, if he somehow manages, within his dream......

Shastra is very clear and in a totally unambiguous way explains the cause and effect of the Jeeva.  
अपाणि पादौ जवनो ग्रहीता पश्यत्यचक्षु स श्रुणोत्यकर्ण स वेत्ति वेद्यं न च तस्यास्ति वेत्ता तम्हुरग्र्यम् पुरुषं महान्तं।।  
One need to assimilate the लक्ष्यार्थ and understand the discussion is about the himself (आत्मनिष्ठ) , then only the clarity of what Shastra is indicating can be grasped.  
Even माय will remain अथनिर्वचनीयं only until the truth dawns on oneself.  
Falling of his playstuff and flying of his balloon is like Maya to a child till he learns the science behind it.  
As Sunilji said "Adi Shankara, as I understand, believed that Shruti needed and there is no need to go to any dielectics."

Katopanishad says:  
न एषा तर्केण मतिः आपनेया

प्रोक्ता अन्येन एव सुज्ञानाय प्रेष्ठ ।

यां त्वम् आपः सत्यधृतिः बत असि

तादृक् नो भूयात् नचिकेतः प्रष्टा ॥ ९

From all these it is clear that while it is quite understandable to clarify doubt at the same time one should depend on more into मननं.
