Let me rephrase this statement as under:  
Thus, the Atman is both free from characteristics and also characteristic at the same time, which is a transformation.  
  
Here is a "water-bottle analogy" (a toy model) :  
Hold a water-bottle in the hand, and rotate it randomly. The water-bottle looks different from different angles. And then suddenly we have a specific angle from where the bottle looks symmetric. This symmetry is Atman.  
  
Advaita is a classical system for the discovery of Brahman as one's ishta. Advaita is a true sect of Hinduism, and Brahman is one of the many (by no means the only) truths within Hinduism.
