Namaste,

  

Interestingly, the conclusion arrived at by Bhashyakara that "why bondage and liberation are both mithyA" is arrived at by showing various flaws in the interpretation of Dvaitins, as a group of Purvapakshins, that bondage and liberation are both real, the most severe being that Atman will become anitya, let alone mokSha! The analysis refutes the Dvaitins' interpretation of real bondage and liberation, be it simultaneous or sequential. For those really interested, these are dealt with elaborately under Bhagavadgita 13.2 क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां विद्धि--

  

At the beginning of the discussion itself, Bhashyakara establishes:

  

अविक्रियस्य च व्योमवत् सर्वगतस्य अमूर्तस्य आत्मनः केनचित् संयोगवियोगानुपपत्तेः, सिद्धं क्षेत्रज्ञस्य नित्यमेव ईश्वरत्वम् ; ‘अनादित्वान्निर्गुणत्वात्’ (भ. गी. १३-३१) इत्यादीश्वरवचनाच्च ॥ Specifically note Bhashyakara's usage of the word ईश्वरवचनात् which would be interesting to all Purvapakshins dealt with there.  

  

Then, during the discussion, Bhashyakara resolves a similar doubt as this subject line shows by pointing out that Purvapakshin is using अर्धजरतियन्याय when rejecting the possibility of मिथ्या संसारी status for क्षेत्रज्ञ but accepting जरामृत्यु as मिथ्या for आत्मा! That is, the way जरामृत्यु are accepted as मिथ्या for आत्मा, so to संसारित्व। This is to be applied to each apparent contradiction in Advaita Vedanta, which is either due to using अर्धजरतियन्याय or misunderstanding of what the term मिथ्या means. Due to the latter, there is an effort to categorize everything that cannot be categorized, using one's own logic which itself, in case of आत्मा, should depend on Shruti.

  

If one has to quote that since there is no one other than ब्रह्म to be bound, then one should not conclude there, but as everything being one. Then what misery can be brought about as separate from ब्रह्म?! The misery that is seen from one व्यावहारिका सत्ता cannot be shown as applying in another पारमार्थिका सत्ता, where no one other than ब्रह्म being there is mentioned.
