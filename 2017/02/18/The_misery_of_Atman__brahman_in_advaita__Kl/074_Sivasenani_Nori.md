Sri Kalyan wrote:

  

"If one imagines oneself to be ignorant when one is not really ignorant, then it means one is \*actually\* ignorant because one does not know that one is not ignorant. So imagined ignorance and imagined misery makes one really ignorant and miserable."  

  

- This gives rise to a problem. To extend Sri Kalyan's argument, once he has established that "one is \*actually\* ignorant", his contention that "one does not know that one is not ignorant" is not correct, as Sri Kalyan himself established "\*actual\* ignorance". When I am an Indian, how can I "not know that I am not an Indian"? Of course, we also cannot expect this position because we can start one more round of application of the meaning of "imagines".

  

The issue here highlights the problems of meaning and interpretation. Here Bhartrihari is an useful guide.

  

सर्वं मिथ्या ब्रवीमीति नैतद्वाक्यं विवक्ष्यते ।

तस्य मिथ्याभिधाने हि प्रक्रान्तोऽर्थो न गम्यते ॥3.3.25॥

  

For the statement "all that I speak is false" to be meaningful, the statement itself should be excluded from the domain of the meaning of the sentence. This is lokavyavahara; otherwise there is no way for a man to declare that he shall only speak falsehoods.

  

Similarly in statements such as "if one imagines oneself to be ignorant when one is not really ignorant", the application of meaning should be restricted to one level only.
