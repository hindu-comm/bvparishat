Dear Sri Ajit  
  
//The bhashya on the Upanishad on the karika is also clear here in vaitathya prakarana for verse 16 as you have quoted//  
  
I am not sure I understand your point. Verse 19 is emphatic that Atman itself is deluded - mAyaiShA tasya devasya yayA sammohitaH svayam \|\|  
  
The other quoted verses serve to show that the entire universe is imagined by the Atman. I am not sure how such clear statements can be denied.
