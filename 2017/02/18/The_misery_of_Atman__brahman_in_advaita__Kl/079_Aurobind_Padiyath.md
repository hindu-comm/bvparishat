I am giving stress to the words "somehow" which is never the words of Shastra.

There are only two ways this can be understood and assimilated( स्वांशीकरणं).

1\. Taking the Karika stand of "देवस्य एष स्वभावः where we can understand that the three states are Swabhavah of the Turiya and just as dream events never inflict the other two states. This knowledge makes us free from the effects of dream at the same time give a permanent knowledge of unrealistic nature of dream. Same way on realising that the waking is similar unreality swapnavat, the knowledge wards of the ill-effects of the apparent reality of the waking. ज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते।

  

2\. Or as in the Brhadaranyaka ध्यायतीव लेलायतीव everything is an apparent reality and विज्ञानव्यतिरेकेण नाऽस्ति किंन्चत् । In this case
also the result will be the same.

The whole problem comes when reality is superimposed in all the three states while experiencing them.

Once the knowledge about one's true nature of प्रत्यगात्मन् is established then there is no chance of effects of the three states wrecking that Knowledge. It becomes your Swabhavah, just as you don't have to be reminded of your status of human-hood or your male/female nature.

It will be like seeing wateryness in mirage with the knowledge of the reality of the appearance.
