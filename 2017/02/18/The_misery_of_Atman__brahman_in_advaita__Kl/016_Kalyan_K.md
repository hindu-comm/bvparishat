Sri Nagaraj  
  
You say "imagines" is a heuristic concept. I confess I do not understand your point. So I will rephrase my question - What is the entity that is affected by ignorance in advaita? Only conscious entities can be affected by ignorance. And brahman is the only conscious entity in advaita. So only brahman can be affected by ignorance. That makes brahman as the biggest ignoramus.
