To Dr. Gargeshwariji,

  

That was really harsh. I don't think that was required. He did not claim that he wanted to learn. He seems to intend debating.

  

To Sri Kalyan K,

  

"Is it an implicit admission that these questions have no logical answers?"

  

sounds as though you were waiting for or aiming at such an admission.

  

Dr Gargeshwari is not the sole representative of the respondent side to your debate. Its not prudent to decide the nature of the claims attended to (it looks that 'attempted to be disproved') by you, just on the basis of the outside the debate comments by one of the respondents.
