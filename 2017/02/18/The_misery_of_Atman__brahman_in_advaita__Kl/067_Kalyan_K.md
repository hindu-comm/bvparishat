Atman itself is never observed by perception or inference. Shankara explicitly states this in his introduction to the Brihadaranyaka upanishad bhashya and I completely agree with him on this point. If Atman were an object of observation, then Bauddha and Carvaka schools would not have denied Atman.

  

If Atman itself can never be observed by perception or inference, may I know how 'Atman is experiencing misery' can become an observation? I will respond to the rest of the post once you clarify this. Thanks.
