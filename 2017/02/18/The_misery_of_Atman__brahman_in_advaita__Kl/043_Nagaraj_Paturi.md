I have a project in mind : to enlist all the basic axioms or tenets commonly agreed by all the different schools of Vedanta.

  

These shall be :

  

Common sources from S'ruti, Sutra granthas and other texts accepted as authority by all the different schools of Vedanta and specific to schools of Vedanta only and not for other Vaidika dars'anas.

  

Words/concepts commonly used by all the schools of Vedanta, belong to / central for Vedanta and do not belong to or not central for the other Vaidika Drshanas and other avaidika but Dhaarmika (i.e., Bhaarateeya) Darshanas (such as Bouddha, Jaina etc. )

  

(Statements of ) axioms commonly accepted by all schools of Vedanta.

  

Tenets commonly accepted by all schools of Vedanta.
