With all humility I would like to state that the true significance of this and several such mantras have been explained in my book - The Ritual traditions of India, Somaiya Publications, Mumbai, 2016  
  

During the Upaanayana the father recites - yamaaya tvaa paridadaamyasau - son, I give you to Yama. Yama is the God of death. No father would like to give away his son to death. Giving here should not be taken in the literal sense. It means seeking the blessings.  
  

Similarly marrying a girl to Soma. Gandharva and Agni should not be taken in the literal sense. It means seeking their blessings. In our tradition, we offer all objects to Gods before partaking them or enjoying them. Here again the bride as a precious object is received by the bridegroom as kanya daana. Before receiving it he offers her to Gods or he seeks their blessings.  
  

There is a story prevalent in Tamil Nadu. 'Kani' means fruit. 'Kanni' means a maiden. After the contest at the Draupadi svayamvara, the Pandavas came home with Draupadi, knocked at the door and said 'We have brought a kanni'. Kunti who was inside heard it as 'kani', fruit and said 'fine, share it among yourselves'. The Pandavas adhered to her words strictly and so all the five married her.
