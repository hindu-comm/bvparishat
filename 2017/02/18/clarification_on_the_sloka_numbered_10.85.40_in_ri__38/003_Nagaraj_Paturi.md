Tell your friends that if they move a little down in the same page , the following mantra says, “ (Oh bride, after this marriage ), be the empress having control over your father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law and brothers-in-law”



What greater position can be there for a bride /wife?



sam-rājñī \| śvaśure \| bhava \| sam-rājñī \| śvaśrvām \| bhava \| nanāndari \| sam-rājñī \| bhava \| sam-rājñī \| adhi \| devṛṣu // RV_10,85.46 //  
  

46 Over thy husband's father and thy husband's mother bear full sway.  
Over the sister of thy lord, over his brothers rule supreme.




(Ralph T.H. Griffith)
