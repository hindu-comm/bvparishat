So nicely said. The bond between the parents-in -aw and the daughter-in-law can be very great and thus daughter-in-law can have authority over the parents-in-law.  
  
In fac,t there is an anecdote one comes to hear in Gaya. There, Lord Ram was preparing to perform the Shraddha ceremony of his father. Mother Sita was cooking the food for offering in the Shraddha. Dashartha came to the kitchen and asked Mother Sita to give him food as he was hungry and she gave him food. Later on when Lord Ram asked for the food preparation to offer in the Shraddha, Mother Sita said that she had already given the food to her father-in-law. Lord Ram did not believe her and wanted proof. Mother Sita said the river Falgu was the witness, but Falgu denied and Mother Sita cursed Falgu and from that time Falgu became an almost dried-up river. There was one tree however, which vouched for Mother Sita and people even today worship that tree in Gaya.
