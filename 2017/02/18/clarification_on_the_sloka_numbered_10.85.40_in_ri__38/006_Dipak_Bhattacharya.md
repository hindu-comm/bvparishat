18.2.17

Dear Colleague,

Those are not reference to earthly marriage or the physical state of the bride. The allusion is mythological – the bride is presented as an immortal entity who got married to Soma, Gandharva and Agni -- all
heavenly beings. The allusion underlies the belief that the earthly marriage is an enactment of the divine act.

Many Hindu rituals are conceived as enactment of divine ones performed by gods. The Agny¡dheya, Dar¿a-P**£r¸**am¡sas too are such.

Best
