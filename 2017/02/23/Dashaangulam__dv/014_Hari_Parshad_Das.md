Another extract from the Book — "Pinnacles of India's Past: Selections from the Ṛg-veda" by Walter H. Maurer which explains the term daśāṅgulam on similar lines as the Madhva-commentaries:

The basic idea is that the Puruṣa is simultaneously all pervasive as well as he appears limited in form due to his divine māyā. This happens by his own will and he is never under the control of māyā.  
  

Some more pramanas for simultaneous all-pervasiveness and limitedness:  
  
***asthūlo’naṇur amadhyamo madhyamo’vyāpako vyāpako harir ādir anādir aviśvo viśvaḥ saguṇo nirguṇaḥ*** (Madhva-bhāṣya on Brahma-sūtras)  
  
***turīyam aturīyam, ātmānam anātmānam, ugram anugram, vīram avīraṁ, mahāntam amahāntaṁ, viṣṇum aviṣṇuṁ, jvalantam ajvalantaṁ, sarvato-mukham asarvato-mukham*** (Nṛsiṁha-tāpanī Upaniṣat, 2.3)  
  

There are more pramanas too in this regard.  

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  

hari parshad das.
