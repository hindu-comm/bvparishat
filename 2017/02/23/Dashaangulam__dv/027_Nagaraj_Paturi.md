Though SaayaNa does not go beyond his 'beyond' interpretation, some of the commentaries did take the das'aangulam to indicate the micro (cosmic) aspect which is apart from / over and above the macro (cosmic) form described by Sahasra S'eershaa etc. (aNoraNeeyaan mahatomaheeyaan)

  

The Vaamanaavataara narrative seems to be the vEdaartha upabrimhaNa of this mystic description in this sukta.
