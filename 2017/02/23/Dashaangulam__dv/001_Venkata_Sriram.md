Pujya Pandurangiji,

  

You are good scholar and hope you can understand the following commentaries of Sayana and Sudarshana Suri:

  

Sayana Bhashya

//

  

Sri.Sudarshana Suri Vyakhya (vide page no. 769)

  

//

//

  

Hope you found the interpretation satisfactory. It is upa-lakshaNa to denote the finite aspect as angula is used for counting purpose. Since the puruSa is

infinite, He is described to be beyond the count of 10 anuguLas which denotes His omnipresence.

  

regs,

sriram
