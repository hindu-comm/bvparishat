dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams. please find attached Srimad-bhagavatam 2.6.12 - 15 with commentaries from the Madhva-sampradaya. The Bhāgavata-prakāśikā commentary on the 15th verse by Sri Yadupati Acharya explains the term vitastim according to the term 'daśāṅgulam' given in the puruṣa-sūkta. This edition was published by Shri K.T. Pandurangi.  
  
Alternatively, you can also refer to the commentary of Srila Sridhar Swami on this verse of the Bhagavatam.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
