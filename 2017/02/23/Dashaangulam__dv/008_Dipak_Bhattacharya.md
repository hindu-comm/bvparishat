Dear Professor Pandurangi,

According to some authorities there are certain mythological numbers that do not literally conform to reality but symbolically express general themes -- here the idea of totality or sufficiency by da¿¡ṅgulam. As far as I know it was the French scholar Abel Bergaigne who initially stated the idea in the nineteenth century. Later, Karl Gustav Jung, Psychology and Religion, West and East, 1958:167 clearly enunciated the theory. According to that ten is a convenient number of that type in India and elsewhere. So the da¿a in da¿¡ṅgulam, expresses a theme, that of largeness here, and should not be taken literally.

This is presented with all humility and no intention of sermonizing. Please do not hesitate to give your own ideas on this and criticize, if you feel so. . 

There might be opponents of this theory and you are free to criticise it.

Best wishes

Dipak Bhattacharya
