Namaste



Sri Veernaryana Pandurangi has raised an intricate and primary question in relation to the understanding of the Purusha Sukta. As he has stated, the traditional commentaries are not focused in answering the specific question ‘ Why a specific numeric unit mentioning – दशाङ्गुल ‘ ? which leads to the subset questions: Why Not more or less ?



The ingenious explanations of commentators in traditional framework to explain ‘the numeric part – *dasa*’ and the ‘ measure part – *Angula*’ does not seem to provide a consistent (?- is it an expectation or a necessity ?) explanation for the critical mind.



Professor (late) S K Ramachandra rao in his work on Purusha Sukta seems to have arrived at a balanced presentation of the traditional view on this, seen in the following extract. If the word ‘dasha’, is taken as a figurative expression ( similarly to the word ‘sahasra’ in the first richa), the apparent conflict may be resolved.

Another way of looking at the understanding of the text is to play with the meaning of the word ‘Purusha’ , where the term does not become a pointer to human measure. This way the word ‘Angula’ does not become a numeric measure like ‘ten inches (?)- by finger length measure’. Then if the term ‘dashangualam’ is taken as ‘ some distance between two points, what are the two end points supposed to be ? Here again the traditional commentaries are not uniform in their presentation. See the explanations below:

If we need to find a way to ‘ logically respond to the question related to the vision of Rushi (Darshana’), and explain –‘ Why Only Dasha’ ? –
the choices are :



- To stay with any one of the above explanations ? which are linked and dependent on the way one explains ‘ Purusha’ addressed in the Sukta.

- To find out our own ingenious explanation ? - Like dasha is ‘ Ten Lakaras’ of grammar, ( because the tris-sapta samidhah’ are explained as Three vachanas and Seven vibhaktis in vyakarana )

- Take each of the traditional explanations as ‘ one type of instruction for Rik-Viniyoga ’ following Bruhaddevataa – guidance. 





Whichever way one takes, there will always be a gap left for rising a ‘doubting question’ ! from a human perspective :What was the gap and transcending projection, if ‘ Purusha’ is ‘All that is, was and would be’? What then was the space that remained ‘to be filled through the transcendence’ ?
