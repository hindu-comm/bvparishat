Many have have explained this in their own way.

  

I just noted the use of  दशाङ्गुल according to Sayana is not the exact 10 angula, but it is used as उपलक्षण. In the others alsp सहस्राक्ष etc. also it is not used in the sense of 1000, but to plurality
अनन्तसङ्ख्याक. This is the intention of सहस्र' How do you take उपलक्षण is left to your Nyayatheory. This is taken to concord ईश्वतश्चक्षक्षुरुत विश्वतस्पात्, संबाहुभ्यां संपतत्रै etc.

  

The others take it exactly ten angula extent of ह्त्पद्म as posted in earliter replies. In that case also the extent of Purusha is not limited Ten Angula only, but over and above pervading it to ब्रह्माण्ड or more. अत्यतिष्ठत् explains this pervading over and above.
