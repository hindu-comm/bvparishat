The word ‘ten’ is also said to mean ‘infinity’, as numbers are only up to nine and what is above is regarded as numberless. Dasangula is taken as upalakshaNam of Pursusha He is described to be beyond the count of 10 anugulas. This describes his immeasurable size. Another possible interpretation would be extends beyond in the Ten Directions ( represented by Ten Fingers )  
Enveloping the earth from all sides and transcending it by ten fingers length ( As when one counts with fingers we have only ten fingers to count) or transcending all ten directions. Or He has enveloped this world from all sides and has (even) transcended it by ten angulas or inches (Angula also mean an inch)  
  

'Gets up' is used in the sense He arose from the yajna that was performed.
