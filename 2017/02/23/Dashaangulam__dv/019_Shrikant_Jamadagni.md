Dear all

  

Prof R L Kashyap interprets dashaaangulam as "ten directions". The mantra says that the Purusha is ALL but also beyond ALL i.e. 10 directions. He says angula being measure of space or direction etc.  

  

English word angle can have sense of direction. Here is an extract from [etymology.com](http://etymology.com) just for consideration that angula may mean direction also (though sanskrit dictionaries have not attested so) Sometimes a word loses its meaning in a language but retain it ij its cognates in other languages:

  

[angle (n.)](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=angle&allowed_in_frame=0) [![Look up angle at Dictionary.com](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/rqdP5E12C9u4rSuNxdfOH2M9lSCDhVNxJRyJCVdBOsxxvWVcmGRpEKzNtOM1U4OVr1xk_HJ5q_nRtQ0k_a4IAb2wH2Y=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.etymonline.com/graphics/dictionary.gif "Look up angle at Dictionary.com")](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=angle "Look up angle at Dictionary.com")  
"space or difference in direction between intersecting lines," late 14c., from Old French angle "an angle, a corner" (12c.) and directly from **Latin angulus** "an angle, a corner," a diminutive form from PIE root \*ang-/\*ank- "to bend" (source also of Greek ankylos "bent, crooked," Latin ang(u)ere "to compress in a bend, fold, strangle;" Old Church Slavonic aglu "corner;" Lithuanian anka "loop;" Sanskrit ankah "hook, bent," angam "limb;" Old English ancleo "ankle;" Old High German ango "hook").  
  
Figurative sense "**point or direction** from which one approaches something" is from 1872. Angle-bracket is 1781 in carpentry; 1956 in typography.

thanks.
