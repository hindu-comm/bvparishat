I admire the erudition here. The logic ofगौणशब्द would be very useful in most interpretations.

I observe literal translations in Ramayana and general confusion about quantity and size.

Most can be averted with the logic put forth by Prof. Korada. One does not need to get a

physical explanation, but a conceptual poetic understanding!
