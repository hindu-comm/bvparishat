My free lance discussion:

In the absence of direct meanings, better to go by 'correlation of words, phrases and thoughts' of similar hymns. There is one such hymn in the Tai. Aranyaka: सहस्र शीर्षं देवं .....अधो निष्ट्या वितस्त्यान्ते नाभ्यामुपरि,,, This hymn is clearly about the चिदाकाश but related to the physical distance between the bodily navel and the mystical ह्रदय (not the heart on the left side of the body). Vitasti as a measure is equal to 10-12 angula (details in S'ulva sutras. Some texts equate/designate 1 purusha=10 vitasti). Subject to our limitations in articulating or re-expressing the direct experience of the मन्त्रद्रष्टा the RV hymn relates to what we routinely refer to as the अन्तर्यामिन् . This line of thought is in tune with the commentary of Bhatta Bhaskara cited already by Dr.Ramanujan.

  

with kind regards to Prof.Pandurangi and others
