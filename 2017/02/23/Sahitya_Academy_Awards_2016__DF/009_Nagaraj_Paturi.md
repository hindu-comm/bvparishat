This award honors only one small aspect of the multifaceted genius of Poojya Prof. Rani Sadasivamurty garu. 

  

The award honored itself by adorning such a great personality.

  

I have my special reminiscences associated with the original Telugu book onTari pUla buTTa, Sanskrit translation of which lead to this honor.

  

Dr Rallabandi Kavita Prasad (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallabhandi_Kavitha_Prasad>) , the author of the Telugu book left the mortal world quite untimely ([just recently](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rallabandi-kavitha-prasad-passes-away/article6997744.ece) ) while in service as a high level government official. He was a fine scholar of classical and modern Telugu literature and had a good foundation in Sanskrit and was abreast with contemporary developments in global literary and aesthetic studies. He was a performer of Ashtaavadhaanams and S'ataavadhaanams. (We were mutual pruchchakas in Ashtaavadhaanams and used to regularly enjoy our informal goshThis on literary matters. I still remember his presentation of the poems in this translated book to me.)

  

Prof. Rani's translation into Sanskrit of this book reasserts the modernity or modern LIFE of Sanskrit. It is not just any other translation. It is the translation of a modern poetic work of a poet with sound classical foundation.

  

Namaskarams and congratulations to Prof. Rani Sadasivamurty garu on this occasion!
