Dear colleague,

  

Sahitya Academy announced it's translation awards in 22 Indian languages. It is happy to note that one of our BVP contributors and eminent Sanskrit scholar Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murthy won the translation award in Sanskrit for his work '*vivakta pushpakaranda*' based on Dr Kavita Prasad 's Telugu book - '*ontari poola-butta*.'

  

A Telugu news clip is attached herewith. Announcement has not been made on SA website?

  

Regards,

Prasad
