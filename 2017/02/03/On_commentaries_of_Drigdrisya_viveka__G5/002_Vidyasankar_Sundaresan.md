To my knowledge, there are three commentaries on this text.

  

The earliest one is by brahmAnanda bhAratI, who clearly identifies the author of the text as SrI bhAratItIrtha (14th c.).

  

There is another by one Anandagiri, who attributes it to SankarAcArya. This Anandagiri needs to be distinguished from the Anandagiri who wrote TIkAs on the prasthAnatraya bhAshya of SankarabhagavatpAda, because the TIkAkAra seems to be most probably a pre-14th century author.

  

The third one is by niScaladAsa (18th c?), who identifies the author as vidyAraNya (probably a confusion deriving from the frequent juxtaposition of bhAratI tIrtha and vidyAraNya as joint authors of numerous works). This niScaladAsa also wrote a fairly popular Vedantic text in Hindi called Vichar Sagar, in which he salutes Dadu Dayal, the founder of the dAdUpanthI-s in north India.

  

Best regards,  

Vidyasankar
