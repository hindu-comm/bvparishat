Namaste,  
  

This verse :  
  
अर्जुन उवाच \|  
प्रकृतिं पुरुषं चैव क्षेत्रं क्षेत्रज्ञमेव च \|  
एतद्वेदितुमिच्छामि ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं च केशव \|\| 1\|\|  
  

is omitted in some versions and the number of verses then is 699. With this verse as spoken by Arjuna it makes 700 verses.,but if that verse is not commented on or that verse is not considered to be there, the number of verses will be 699. In the Original Bhagavad Gita thist verse is attributed to Lord Krishna in the Original Bhagavad Gita.  
  

Regards,
