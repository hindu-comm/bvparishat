It gives me immense pleasure to draw the attention of members of this list to the updated website at <http://www.advaitasharada.sringeri.net/> .

This was released at Sringeri in combination with the kumbhAbhisheka ceremonies of the newly repaired and gilded Sikhara of the Saradamba temple at the Sringeri Peetham. New features of the site include a number of additional texts, such as pancapAdikA, along with a rare sub commentary, vaktavyakASikA, and the ratnaprabhA commentary on the brahmasUtrabhAshya of SankarabhagavatpAda, as well as sureSvarAcArya's vArttika on the taittirIya bhAshya and the Anandagiri TIkA on the gItAbhAshya. A few prakaraNa texts have also been included with this release.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
