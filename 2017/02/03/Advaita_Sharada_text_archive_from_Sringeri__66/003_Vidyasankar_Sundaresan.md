I am only the messenger here! The credit for getting the e-texts ready and presenting them all on a functional and visually pleasing interface goes to the small dedicated team at the library and research center at Sringeri and the Mysore based team from Sriranga Digital Software. The first release of this site had happened a little more than two years ago, as part of the annual vidvatsadas held during the vinAyaka caturthI festival in 2014.

The current release includes toTaka's SrutisArasamuddharaNa and the hastAmalakIya as well, bringing texts by SankarabhagavatpAda's four primary disciples into the scope of this digital archive. The vaiyAsika nyAyamAlA of bhAratItIrtha is also available. naishkarmyasiddhi and bRhadAraNyaka bhAshyavArttika of sureSvara and other important sub commentaries by later authors are being worked on, for future updates.

The hyperlinked nature and searchability of the bhAshya texts are maintained and can be accessed via the link that says "anveshaNam." They have also removed the login feature, so the texts are available to all, without having to create a user ID and password to access the site.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
