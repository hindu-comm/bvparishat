Namaste Vidyasankarji,

  

Thanks for the website updates and sharing the wonderful news. Other than the several additional works such as TIkAs and prakaraNagranthas, the split-view of TIkA is an excellent development. The entire effort is extremely commendable.

  

Kind rgds,  
--Praveen R. Bhat
