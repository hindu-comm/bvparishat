There is a Kashmir recension of the Bhagavad Gita. Such a pāṭha has been recognized by Ramanuja's Gita bhashya commentator, Venkatanatha. It is said there are at least five commentaries on this recension. While I have not seen all those five and compared the differences with ref. to Shankara's reading, this Sarvatobhadra commentary is available for download. The edition makes note of such differences then and there.
Here is the difference with reference to the total number of verses in the Shankara edition:

Sarvatobhadra has:

\> 15th ch. at end one verse extra in some mss.  
\>  
\> 11th ch. 4 verses extra.  
\>  
\> 9th ch. 1 verse extra.  
\>  
\> 6th ch. 2 verses extra  
\>  
\> 5th ch. 1 verse less

3rd ch. 5 verses extra

1st ch. 1 verse less

One can perhaps make a survey with the Abhinava Gupta commentary too since this is earlier to Ramanuja.
