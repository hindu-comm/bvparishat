Namaste,

  

Lilavati with Buddhivilasini was published in 2 volumes Anandashram series. It is available online at  

<https://archive.org/details/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series>  

  

Kriyakramakari commentary was edited by KV Sarma and published by Vishveshvaranand Vedic Research Institute (VVRI) in 1975. It seems, this edition is not available online. You can either buy it from VVRI - <http://vvrinstitute.com/> or try to access it from some University or public liraries.



regards  
shankara
