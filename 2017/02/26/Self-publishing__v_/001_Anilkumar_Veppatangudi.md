With reference to Self-publishing, I went through a tough time trying to get Literary Agents and Publishers to read the manuscript of my novel Anveshana The Search. Finally, I set up my own publishing company, Kalpa Publishing.

Now that it is set up, Kalpa Publishing is open to looking at manuscripts for publishing especially with India centric subjects and traditional content in English and other Indian languages.

Since technology has made it possible to print on demand, even small quantities can be printed as and when needed.

You can visit the website, [www.kalpapublishing.com](http://www.kalpapublishing.com) for information

Regards,

  

Dr.V.R.Anil Kumar
