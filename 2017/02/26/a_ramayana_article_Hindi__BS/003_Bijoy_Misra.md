Sunilji,

Valmiki appears to have a good geographic knowledge. He possibly had been to places,

or there could have been legends assuming the story happened before Valmiki composed.

For example, I see in the vedas, there are legends which must have been popular tales while

the hymns were being composed. 

Mine is a subjective interpretation.

Best regards,

BM
