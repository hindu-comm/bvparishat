Many thanks Sriram ji, for the link. I found this pdf to be just the basic text, without any translations. (The DLI link description says that the work is authored by Adi Shankaracharya despite the book itself clearly saying that it is of Swami Vidyaranya. Someone may bring this to the notice of the DLI people.)

  

Those who desire to have the translation and explanation in Hindi can go for the one available in the link. This is a publication of the famous Sri Dakshinamurti Maṭha, Varanasi.

There is a Tamil translation of HH Sri Jnanananda Bharati Swaminah
published by the Rajapalayam Trust, Combatore, 1980 and perhaps republished too by them later. I have this book with me. It must be available in Sringeri book shop and with the publishers.   

  

warm regards
