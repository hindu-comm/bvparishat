Dear Dr. Rajendra, I read your posting on DNA of words Indra, Shakra and Jayanta. I congratulate youfor trying to offer etymology in your way. Etymology (Nirukti and Vyutpatti) is important subject in Sanskrit linguistics. Many books are published on the subject. The important one is Nirukta of Yaaska and commentaries on it. I am interested in this subject from many years. Ifyou would like it, I can send you PDF copies of my papers. Thanks. NRJOSHI.
