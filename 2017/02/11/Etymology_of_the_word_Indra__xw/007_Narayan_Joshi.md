Dear K Tuvji, Thanks for your efforts in explaining the word, "Indra". Although Indra is instantly recognized as the deity from Vedas controlling rain, there are other places where Indra appears, examples--Indradhanus'ya, Indrajaalam, Indratoolakam, Mrigendra, and Indra attached to Indriyas.

I feel that single meaning of Indra (etymology) is correct which explains the meaning in all these words.

We have noticed in order to explain etymology of Sanskrit words scholars have used different devices such as attaching meaning to single syllable, to single sound or phoneme and reach the meaning somehow. I feel uncomfortable with such methods.

We find them being used from very ancient times-in Braahmans granthas like Shatapatha Braahmana. But my New VarNavaada is different. Thanks. NRJOSHI
