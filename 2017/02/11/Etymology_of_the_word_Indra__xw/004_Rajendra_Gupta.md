I am a biologist who is attempting to compare the origin and evolution of words to the origin and evolution of DNA sequences of living organism. I find that the manner in which DNA mutates in living organism is exactly the same as the mutations / changes in spoken words and their evolution into words in different languages. Since I have no training in Sanskrit or linguistics, I apologise to all the scholars in this forum before presenting my unconventional take on the etymology of the word इन्द्र Indra, its synonym शक्रः zakraH and that of indra's son जयन्त Jayant. 

  

राजन्य rAjanya \[Sanskrit\] = royal, royal personage, kingly, princely, man of the regal or military tribe

यन्जरा yanjarA (reversal of the sequence of varNa in the word)

इन्जरा injarA (mutation from y to i)  

इन्दरा indarA (mutation from j to d as in **j**yoti to **d**yuti)

इन्द्र indra

  

Another name for Indra is शक्रः zakraH. I believe that the etymology of शक्रः zakraH is as follows:

  

राजक rAjaka \[Sanskrit\] = king, chief, prince, little king

जकरा jakrA (anagram of rAjaka, change of varNa sequence in rAjaka)

शकरा zakrA (mutation from j to z)

शक्रः zakraH (deletion of vowel and addition of visarga)   

  

Etymology of the name of Indra's son जयन्त Jayant

  

इन्द्रज indraja

जइन्द्र jaindra (sequence change)

जयन्द्र jayandra (i mutates to ya)

जयन्द jayanda (deletion of 'ra' and consequent polishing of rough edge of the word)

जयन्त jayanta (mutation of da to ta)  

OR

इन्द्रज indraja  

यन्द्रज yandraja (i mutates to ya)

यन्दज yandaja (deletion of 'ra' and consequent polishing of rough edge of the word)

जयन्द jayanda (sequence change)

जयन्त jayanta (mutation of da to ta)

  

Best regards

  

Rajendra
