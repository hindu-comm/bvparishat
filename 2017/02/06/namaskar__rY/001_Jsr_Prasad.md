Very happy to know that Prof. K.V. Sarma Research Foundation is organizing this lecture by Padmavibhushan Dr. M.S. Valiathan. His three translated books on Ayurveda are a collector's delight. Interested may visit this [NPTEL](http://nptel.ac.in/courses/121106003/2) link, to watch his video lectures on a course titled 'Ayurvedic Inheritance of India.'  
  

Regards
