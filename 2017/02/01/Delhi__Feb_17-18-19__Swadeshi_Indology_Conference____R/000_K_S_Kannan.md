Dear Scholars of BVP,  
  

Here is the **schedule** of  
the 2nd Conference of Swadeshi Indology, entitled  
GLOBAL PERCEPTIONS OF INDIAN HERITAGE  
to be held at New Delhi, at and **in collaboration with IGNCA** (Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts).  
  

This is for the kind information of all.  
  
Constrained by the capacity of the halls, 50 general registrations  
were allowed - for the benefit of those who wanted to attend though they contributed no papers. The provision has been overbooked already.

  

The proceedings of both the conferences (SI-1 and SI-2) will soon be published.  
  

**Dr. K S Kannan**  

Academic Director,
