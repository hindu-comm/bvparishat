नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

is apourusheya invented to counter Buddhists attacks or had the term need to be the explained outside Buddhist context as has been attempted  

  

                   --- Vidvan Ajit Gargeshwari

  

Whether you take those who accept प्रलय , viz वेदान्त , व्याकरण etc or those who do not accept प्रलय , ie the मीमांसा , same is the case --

  

the tradition has been there since time immemorial . The Buddhists have arrived just recently . We have taken प्रलय(s) .

  

The अपौरुषेयवाद may be used against Buddhists .

  

Also it may be noted that there was / were  मीमांसा /s -

  

काशकृत्सिना प्रोक्ता मीमांसा - काशकृत्स्ना --- महाभाष्यम् ।

  

It is not invented - check my response - महतो भूतस्य निःश्वसितम् .... this is said by वेद itself .

  

When we trust योगिन्s like Panini , Patanjali , Susruta etc and they are proved to be right in terms of शब्दसाधुत्वम्, योग , Plastic Surgery etc
we do trust other things also which are said by them .

  

Just take an example -- even scholars say that योगाभ्यास is useful in improving / maintaining physical health - anybody who questions this is considered as a fool.

Now the fact is that चरकम् and सुश्रुतम् are meant for physical health , whereas योग is meant for 'mental health' - चित्तशुद्धि ।

  

We do not come across any treatment for the शरीरम् (body) in योगानुशासनम् ।

  

Then can anyone brush aside the claim of crores of people that योग is useful for physical health ?

  

No , but the fact is that improvement in physical health is just a minor benefit of योग - the actual benefits of योग are very great and many .

  

So

गतानुगतिको लोको न लोकः पारमार्थिकः ।

गङ्गासैकतलिङ्गेन नष्टं ताम्रभाजनम् ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
