Indeed, Prof. Deshpande. I am of the opinion that even the uttara mImAMsA view of veda prAmANya and apaurusheyatva is a lot more elastic than and not completely indebted to the pUrva SAstra. This is clear from the two different interpretations that Sankara bhagavatpAda gives to the third sUtra, SAstrayonitvAt.

  

महतऋग्वेदादेःशास्त्रस्यअनेकविद्यास्थानोपबृंहितस्यप्रदीपवत्सर्वार्थावद्योतिनःसर्वज्ञकल्पस्ययोनिःकारणंब्रह्म।

  

अथवायथोक्तमृग्वेदादिशास्त्रंयोनिःकारणंप्रमाणमस्यब्रह्मणोयथावत्स्वरूपाधिगमे।  
  
Only the second interpretation, taking SAstrayoni as a bahuvrIhi and prefaced with an athavA, would fit in completely with the mImAMsaka view of apaurusheyatva. Under the first interpretation, SAstrayoni is a tatpurusha and if brahman is to be described as the yoni of RgvedAdi SAstra, that is closer to the nyAya position, albeit coupled with a svataH-pramANya view. advaita vedAntins hold that brahman is nirguNa and not a purusha, so there is a different flavor of apaurusheyatva as compared to pUrva mImAMsA. And this more nyAya like approach to SAstra would be especially strengthened for non-advaita vedAntins who insist that brahman is always necessarily saguNa, i.e. ISvara.
