This is a technical word used by mImAMsaka-s(both pUrva and uttara), and it means that 'veda-s are not pronounced independent of pronunciation of similar word-construction'. Nothing more than that.

BTW,

1\. On what basis could we say that 'veda-s are 'coming' from man'? What is the meaning of 'coming' here? If I destroy all logic used to prove the 'coming from men, it will be enough to say that they are not coming from men. That's what mImAMsaka-s do.

2\. Any difference between first and second options?

3\. Divine origin is accepted by 'tArkika-s and vedantin-s'. How the divine is proved, is another topic.

4\. Divine revelation to some RiShis. Possible, but needs to prove divine source of knowledge and existence of proof to know relation of means and results(in this case - revelation of veda-s). Again, supported by tArkika-s and vedantin-s.

If you try to prove that RShi-s created it, then the question will be\_

1\. Do you think that veda-s are songs of people who were superstitious and feared everything and hence propitiated?

2\. If not, what is the purpose of veda-s? Nothing? Or something apart from propitiating 'imagined GODs'?

  

If by any chance you think that they are useless songs, etc. then the whole talk of apauruSheyatva becomes useless at this stage. First vaidika-s have to spend some time to prove that they are not useless words.

  

Anyway, If you click '[advaita-l apaurusheyatva](https://www.google.co.in/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=advaita-l&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=EPOVWJWZD-_s8Afen7KoCA#newwindow=1&q=advaita-l+apaurusheyatva)' the link and read some threads on Advaita-l, you may have some clear idea about objections and supports of apauruSheyatva.
