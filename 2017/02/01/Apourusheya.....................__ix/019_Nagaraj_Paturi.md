1\. Prof. Deshpande, you agreed that "ideas of impersonal origin of the Vedas are sporadically found in early Vedic texts". Thus "Both of these alternatives (which) are different ways of answering attacks on the Vedas by Buddhists and Jains, who in their arguments highlight the man-made nature of the Vedas (Pali: isayo mantānaṃ kattāro = Skt. ṛṣayaḥ mantrāṇām kartāraḥ), and that these Ṛṣis were ignorant and should not be followed as spiritual guides (cf. Tevijja Sutta, Tripiṭaka)." (word in parantheses added by me), should be seen , not as invented answers by the answering schools but as their invoking of the already available material as answers.

  

  

2\. AadaraNIya Vidyasankarji, can one say that the word(s) mantrakr̥t etc. found in the Veda mantras carry the meaning which is in contrast with the meaning of the mantra drashṭā ?

  

or one needs to do a samanvaya of the expression mantrakr̥t /mantrakartā in consonance with the idea of mantradrashṭā to go with the ēkavākyatā of the different expressions in the s'ruti?

  

I think

  

the main point of concern in using either word mantrakartā or mantradrashṭā is whether we attribute the 'meaning' of the mantra to be 'meant by' = intended by- the mantrakartā / mantradrashṭā or not. Can we see any āchārya of the āstika paramparā , while quoting any s'rutivaakya for praamaaṇya, quoting the name of the r̥ṣi and saying, 'this is the intention of the r̥ṣi of the mantra or this is the upadēśa of the r̥ṣi of the mantra' ? or do they invariably say this IS THERE in śruti and hence is pramāṇa ?
