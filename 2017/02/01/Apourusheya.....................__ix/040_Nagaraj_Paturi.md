I just began to access the net.

  

\>Also, in today's context, for a defender of Sruti against opposing views to mount a sound defense, she will have to substantiate afresh the ēkavākyatā in the first place.

  

It was not and is not as a defender of S'ruti.

  

It was based on the reasoning that a person or a school arguing for vēdaprāmāṇya can not do that without arguing for ēkavākyatā of Veda. Let us take a naiyāyika, mīmāmsaka or vēdāntin. A scholar belonging to any one of these schools believes in vēdaprāmāṇya. That person has to inevitably, imminently believe in ēkavākyatā of Veda, because, otherwise the opponent can counter him saying which of the mutually inconsistent vākyas are you saying is pramāṇa? By the same reasoning he is bound to believe in mantrakartā = mantradraṣṭā . Thus even if I were, hypothetically, not to be an āstika, I have to make a statement that "an āstika believes in mantrakartā = mantradraṣṭā as part of his understanding that there is ēkavākyatā in Veda, which (this understanding) is required for his being an āstika"
