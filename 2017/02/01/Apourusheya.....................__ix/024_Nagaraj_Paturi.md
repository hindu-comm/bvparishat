Let me just take a completely modern approach to the issue here in this post:

  

1. I quoted the modern theory from English literary criticism called The Theory of Impersonality of Poetry. The theorist quoted by me, Prof. Northrop Frye, a highly celebrated literary critic from Princeton University , famous for his book "Anatomy of Criticism", is saying that any poem has to be considered not as a creation by the poet. Poet is just a medium. It is Mother Nature which is giving birth to the poem through the medium of the poet. I am not talking about merits or demerits of the theory. I am just asking if this theorist is ever considered a superstitious person for considering poetry not to be the creation of the poet? This theory is critiqued. But is it not critiqued not on account of its being 'religious' or 'superstitious'? That just is my point. Why do people jump into the attributions of 'religiosity', 'superstition' etc. only when it comes to things that are Indian, particularly ancient Indian, more particularly things like Veda and bring points like 'not suited to 21st century' etc. ?

  

2\. In poetry, 'conscious poet' is a bad word because ideal poetry composition is sought to be an unconscious process. For that matter , all art is considered to be produced (in its best form), only when the artist produces it by being in a trans, by being in an unconscious state. It is this experience of being unconscious or in trans which makes the poet, for that matter, any artist to feel that the art or the poem came out through him/her, not authored by him/her. It is not uncommon to compare this state of bhāvukatva of artists or poets to that of sages, r̥ṣis. Then how is it wrong to consider the r̥śis of the Veda mantras to have been in an extremely deeper state of alaukika experience during the emergence of the mantras through them and how is it weird to have an impersonality view about the relationship between the mantra and its r̥śi?

  

3\. To relate dream to the psychoanalytical entity/idea/state/level of unconscious was done by Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. What is interesting is Bhatrihari brings the analogy of dream to the state of experience of the r̥ṣis during the emergence of the Veda mantras through them.

  

अविभागाद् विवृत्तानाम् अभिख्या स्वप्नवच् छ्रुतौ /

.................................................................वाक्य\_१।१७३ //

  

What is additionally interesting is that Bhartrihari uses the word avibhāga used by him in this context of Veda mantra darśana experience , while discussing dream too.

  

प्रविभागॆ यथा कर्ता तया कार्यॆ प्रवर्ततॆ /

अविभागॆ तथा सैव कार्यत्वॆनावतिष्ठतॆ // वाक्य\_१।१३९ //

  

Language which is kartā in a pravibhāga state (of mind) , turns out to be the kārya in an avibhāga state (of mind)  commentaries translate theavibhāga here as dream state. Thus it can be seen that avibhāga that bhhartrihari uses during the description of Veda mantra darśana too has got to do with an unconscious state of experience but deeper than and above the level of dream or poetry-emerging state of experience.

  

4. View of Impersonality of the Veda thus can be seen to be understandable in terms of the experience of the r̥ṣi during the emergence of the mantra through him.
