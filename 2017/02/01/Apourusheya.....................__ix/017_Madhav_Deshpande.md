Thanks, Vidyasankar, for pointing out that there are alternative views in the tradition that calls the Ṛṣis mantrakṛt. This is not only found in the post Vedic works like Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa (cf. apy agraṇīr mantrakṛtām ṛṣīṇām kuśāgrabuddhe kuśalī gurus te), but one sees this view in the earliest portions of the Ṛgveda. The Ṛṣis are referred to as Kāru "maker, creator", and the process of creating a mantra described using the verb kṛ - (saktum iva titaunā punantoyatra dhīrā manasā vācam akrataI atrā sakhāyaḥ sakhyāni jānate bhadraiṣām lakṣmīr nihitādhi vāci II (RV 10.71.2)). While ideas of impersonal origin of the Vedas are sporadically found in early Vedic texts (cf. Puruṣasūkta: tasmād yajñāt sarvahuta ṛcaḥ sāmāni jajñire / chandāṃsi jajñire tasmād yajus tasmād ajāyata),the particular view of the Vedas as Apauruṣeya is one of the alternative views that develops in Mīmāṃsā, while the Īśvarakartṛkatva is defended by traditions like Nyāya. Both of these alternatives are different ways of answering attacks on the Vedas by Buddhists and Jains, who in their arguments highlight the man-made nature of the Vedas (Pali: isayo mantānaṃ kattāro = Skt. ṛṣayaḥ mantrāṇām kartāraḥ), and that these Ṛṣis were ignorant and should not be followed as spiritual guides (cf. Tevijja Sutta, Tripiṭaka). Simultaneously, the Buddhists attacked the notion of Īśvara. Different Hindu traditions came up with alternative defenses of the Veda against these attacks. The Apauruṣeyatva view of the Mīmāṃsā removes the authorship from the Ṛṣis, but does not defend the Īśvarakartṛkatva of the Vedas. On the other hand, traditions like Nyāya offered a reasoned defense of Īśvara (cf. Udayana's Nyāyakusumāñjali) and argued for Īśvarakartṛkatva of the Vedas. These two traditions followed entirely different ways of justifying the Prāmāṇya of the Vedas. The Mīmāṃsā proposing the svataḥprāmāṇya view, while the Naiyāyikas basing the Prāmāṇya of the Vedas on the Prāmāṇya of Īśvara. I am attaching here a recent dissertation dealing with the history of the Buddhist-Mīmāṃsā debates on this issue. May provide some useful reading and references to literature. With best wishes,
