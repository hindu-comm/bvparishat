तैत्तिरीयारण्यके स्वाध्यायब्राह्मणे

अजान् ह वै पृश्ञीँस्तपस्यमानान् **ब्रह्म स्वयम्भ्वभ्यानर्षत्** त ऋषयोऽभवन् तदृषीणामृषित्वं

इति स्पष्टमुद्घुष्टमस्ति ।

यमेवैष वृणुते तेन लभ्य **स्तस्यैष आत्मा विवृणुते** तनूं स्वामिति च श्रुतिर्जागर्ति ।

अतः पौरुषेयप्रयत्नादिकमन्तरा ब्रह्मप्रेरणया निःसृता वाक् अपौरुषेयवाच्या स्यादिति भाति ।

द्रष्टव्यः - श्रीमद्भागवते ध्रुवस्तुतौ -

योऽन्तः प्रविश्य **मम वाचमिमां प्रसुप्तां सञ्जीवय**त्यखिलशक्तिधरः स्वधाम्ना ।

अन्यांश्च हस्तचरणश्रवणत्वगादीन् प्राणान् नमो भगवते पुरुषाय तुभ्यम् (तस्मै) ॥
