Namaste Prof. Koradaji,  
  

Great explanation on Apaurusheya. Will you kindly permit me to take an example? When Vaishampayana asked his pupil Yajnavalkya to forget what he learnt from the former, Yajnavalkya prayed to Lord Sun and received the knowledge of the Shukla Yajurvada, which is an apaurusheya text. It will be kind of you if you take this example to explain how does the definition of Apaauruheya fit into the calling of the Shukla Yajurveda as Apaurusheya.  
  

Regards,
