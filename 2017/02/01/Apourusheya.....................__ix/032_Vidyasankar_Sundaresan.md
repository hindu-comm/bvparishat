Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

I just wanted to point out that (a) we cannot legitimately say that Rshis are never described as mantra-kartAraH and (b) the vedAnta position on apaurusheyatva is actually different from the pUrvamImAMsA position on it.

  

The exact interpretative strategies on how to understand kartRtva and drashTRtva will depend on various other factors. The nyAya school doesn't set out to interpret Sruti in as much detail and focus as the mImAMsA-s, but I would imagine that a naiyyAyika's understanding of the term mantra-kRt would depend heavily on his view of Sabda and ISvara, and will thus be nuanced differently from how the pUrva-mImAMsaka handles this issue. Also, in today's context, for a defender of Sruti against opposing views to mount a sound defense, she will have to substantiate afresh the ēkavākyatā in the first place.

  

Beyond stating the above, I am stepping into territory where I should not speak much, but listen more to wiser and more experienced vidvAns!

  

Namaskaras,

Vidyasankar
