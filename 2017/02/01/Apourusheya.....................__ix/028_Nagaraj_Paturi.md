Prof. Deshpande,

  

My immediately previous post has no reference to your posts in this thread.

  

I was trying to respond to the learned scholar Dr Rajendra Guptaji by informing him that there are many ways of looking at the concept of impersonality within modern studies too which interestingly match with the ancient Indian approaches like that of Bhartrihari in Vakyapadiyam.

  

Thought some other members too might be interested.

  

Yes, there was a post of me earlier in this thread with mantrakartaa = mantradrashTaa. My point there was that all those who countered the Buddhist arguments were invoking an /the older view from Vedic texts themselves. Dr P. Ramanujanji too provided more evidences for that being an older view. You expressed your awareness of that being an older view already.
