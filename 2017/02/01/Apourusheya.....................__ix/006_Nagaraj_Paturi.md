Dear Dr Rajendra Guptaji,

  

1\. The concept of apourushEyatva of the Vedas is not incompatible with or contradicting to the idea of rishis of the category of brahmarshi 'Saw' / 'Heard' the Vedas.

  

2. The word s'riti here refers to the idea of being 'heard' by the brahmarshi of the Veda mantra, not that it is passed on from generation to generation through hearing. 

  

3\. These words should not be taken in a literal sense or in the meaning that occurs to an uniformed or untrained hearer of them.

  

4\. For example, there are words like 'impersonal' in various modern fields. They can be understood in the intended sense only by the persons trained in the concerned fields.

  

5\. Among them, the one that comes closest to the concept of apourushEyatva of the Vedas is the theory of impersonality in English literary criticism. It has several different versions. Articulating one among them, it has been said that the poet is considered not to be the creator of the poem, but to be the midwife performing the delivery of the poem.

  

6\. You might want to read Prof. Aklujkar's article on Bhartrihari's explanation for the Veda's apourusheyatva.
