We had a meeting on the topic yesterday to understand the neuroscience of creativity.

It seems that we have to think of a "creative memory" separate from the "learning memory"

that we normally utilize. It is the debate between the subjective view and the objective view.

When we say "objective", it is not a "view", it becomes a "vision". The question comes

how the "vision" is created. Can yoga become a tool for it or does it become a pure out-of-body

event? It is possible that the local memory locks out for the period.
We will look for more

analytic literature on the topic. I will report in course of time.
