Rihis were not Mantra Karatas but Mantra Drashatas. What is the difference between creation and spontaneous out pour of poetry. Is revelation same as composition. What is meant by divine. What is meant by non divine. What is the difference between revelation and composition. Is revelation equivalent to belief. What’s verbal testimony. Is it an experience which cannot be communicated but hints about how to experience such experience. Does experience mean one persons subjective belief. Can experience be objectified. Does experience means revelation. If answers to these questions which given by various great scholars of the past and present keeping the Indian thought development in mind be given by scholars then a possible answer can be arrived. Each word is technical in its own way. Answers may lead to further questions which leads to further answers till all questions are resolved is it possible?
