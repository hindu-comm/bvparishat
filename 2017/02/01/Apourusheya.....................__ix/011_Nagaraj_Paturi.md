Exact words of Northrop Frye whose theory of impersonality of a poem, I had in mind are:

  

> 
> > "As with other products of divine activity, the father of a poem is > much more difficult to identify than the mother. That the mother is > always nature, the realm of the objective considered as a field of > communication, no serious criticism can ever deny. But as long as the > father of a poem is assumed to be the poet himself, we have once again > failed to distinguish literature from discursive verbal structures. > The discursive writer writes as an act of conscious will, and that > conscious will, along with the symbolic system he employs for it, is > set over against the body of things he is describing. But the poet, > who writes creatively rather than deliberately, is not the father of > his poem; he is at best a midwife, or, more accurately still, the womb > of Mother Nature herself: her privates he, so to speak. The fact that > revision is possible, that a poet can make changes in a poem not > because he likes them better but because they are better, shows > clearly that the poet has to give birth to the poem as it passes > through his mind. He is responsible for delivering it in as uninjured > a state as possible, and if the poem is alive, it is equally anxious > to be rid of him, and screams to be cut loose from all the > navel-strings and feeding-tubes of his ego." >
