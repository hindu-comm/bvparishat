Yes, Paturi-ji, that is what I have stated. The ideas of impersonal origin of the Vedas occur alongside the Mantrakṛt/kāru characterization of the Ṛṣis in earlier texts. However, the formally argued doctrine of apauruṣeyatva in Mīmāṃsā and the Īśvarakartṛkatva doctrine in Nyāya occur explicitly to counter the attacks by the Buddhists. Most of the Sūtras of the Six Āstika Darshanas contain sections countering the claims of the Buddhists. Further, post-Sūtra authors like Śabara, Kumārila, Udayana and others in these traditions are explicitly engaged in disputation with the Buddhists like Dignāga, Dharmakīrti and Bhāviveka, and the Buddhists are explicitly engaged in countering the arguments offered by Mīmāṃsakas and Naiyāyikas in this regard. It is the mutual en-counters, in Pūrvapakṣa-Uttarapakṣa style, between these traditions that lead to specific formulations and re-formulations by successive generations of defenders on all sides. In the pre-Sūtra literature, we do have scattered ideas that don't always convey the same point of view, but these pre-Sūtra ideas do indeed contribute to the lines of arguments as they develop in the later times. I see these arguments and positions as historically evolving, rather than a fixed continuity of the ancient ideas. With best wishes,
