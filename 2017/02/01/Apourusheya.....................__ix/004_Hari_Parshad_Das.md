In the preface to the Marathi book named "bharatiya jyotish shastra" by Shankar Balkrishna Dixit, there was an opinion of someone named C.P. Vaidya in the preface. I am attaching that opinion to this message of mine.  
  
He says that Surya Siddhanta is not apaurusheya.  
  
This was written on 20 October 1931 in Mumbai.  
  
I have highlighted the relevant section in red. If you have difficulties understanding the Marathi, please let me know and i will translate.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
