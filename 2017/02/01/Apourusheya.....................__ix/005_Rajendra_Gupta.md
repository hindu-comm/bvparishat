Namaste.

I am a retired scientistand science teacher with interestin Sanskrit and Indology. I am grateful to the moderators of this group for being very kind to admit even an outsider like me. I haveonly apreliminary introduction to Sanskrit. Therefore, Ibeg forgiveness of all the vidvAn on this platform beforecommenting on this crucial concept of Hindu philosophy.



In this age of science, no book, howsoeversacred, shoulds be considered as 'apouruSeya' if 'apouruSheya'means 1. not coming from man, 2. authorless, 3. of divine origin, 4. divine revelation. However, if weconsidered the meaning of 'apouruSeya' as1. superhuman work, 2. work of extraordinaryperson(s), 3. not by one person; thenthe Veda,Surya Siddhanta and some other classics are indeed 'apouruSeya', e.g. itis undisputed that the Veda were created by many RSi orextraordinarypersons and have come to us through the Sruti and Vachan parampara.

  

Best regards

  

Rajendra Gupta
