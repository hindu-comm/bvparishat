Gita is a profound text. There are no two thoughts. Traditional, many modern commentators and writers on the Gita text have given different interpretations. Traditional writers have been criticized when a new commentary has been written. If freedom of speech was to spread acceptance of one view then why are there so many commentaries and interpretation of the text. This shows that Gita text is for all and those who have read and have an ability to write might comment and give their views. One may reject or accepts another commentator or interpreters view. Its left to reader. A reader need to cautioned about short comings of a given view. That is what the review did. Just because Gita is scared doesn't mean a new interpretation cannot be given. If one does not accept a new interpretation that is fine. It makes no difference to Gita as the text so profound. More than profound its sacred and too.

  

We are not bound by affiliation to paramapara these days that we all we have to do is justify what our Guru has said and if another view is offered however good or bad it has to criticizedand swear our affiliation to a particular Guru or tradition.  

  

Just as I have the freedom to write so also another person has the freedom to write; why just write even to write but even criticizeme, show my methodological faults, point to errors and ask for explanations. This does not mean I make criticism so personal that I start saying the other writer is stupid crazy out of his mind knows nothing is a joker wants to make quick money and hence he is writing.One should not get emotional loose objectivity and start making rude remarksad-hominem nature is my point.
