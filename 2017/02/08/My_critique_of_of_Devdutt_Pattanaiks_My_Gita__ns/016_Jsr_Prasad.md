Thoughts are no different than an individual. Does not they become the basis of one's character. If I write something deliberately meaningless, I might be questioned or reviewed by the intellectuals. I should be ready to face the consequences. In that case, it is not appropriate to say that I am personally attacked.. I am responsible for anything adverse from my end. Scholars are no politicians, who at times, make scathy remarks and say this is my personal opinion, not my party's etc. Gita is a profound philosophical text, that is part of prasthana-traya. It is our national property. I am no one to distort Gita like serious texts, as per my whims and fancies. Freedom of speech is to spread goodness, positivism rather than to create confusion.

  
Let us move on to discuss the demerits (merits, if any?) of the book review under discussion than to discuss the decency in each others posts.
