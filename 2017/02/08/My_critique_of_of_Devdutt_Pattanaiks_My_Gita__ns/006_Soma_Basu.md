Regards!  
Dr Devdutt Pattanaik is a medical practitioner in real life and has done a Post Graduate Diploma in Mythology from the University of Bombay.  

I was a fellow student in the same year.  

The printing and publication of suchfake books on serious Sanskrit texts should be banned.  

Many thanks to Nityananda Misra ji for his initiative !
