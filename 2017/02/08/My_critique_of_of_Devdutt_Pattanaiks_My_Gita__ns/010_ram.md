This is a brilliant review on a stupid work.

While it is a pleasure to read well-written works, it would be a pain to spend time reading silly works. Thanks to Nityananda Misra for taking pains to carefully go through the work and expose the imbecile.  

It is immaterial whether the author takes lesson or not, but such doltish works shouldn't go unchallenged.

Best wishes,

-ram.
