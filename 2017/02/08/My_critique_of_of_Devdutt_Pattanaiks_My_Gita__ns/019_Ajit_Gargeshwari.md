One take away or a point of agreement with Hari Parsad Das jis post is this

Nityanadaji review is brilliant yes it is.



Mahatma Gandhi who has also written on the Gita says hate the sin and not the sinner. My point is counter and correct the inaccuracies but not hate the person who wrote or made or published his views not to get personal but remain objective. If we stand united only then will we able to counter and face the bigger enemies that Sanskrit scholars have to deal with. Lest keep up to the high standards Sanskrit writers and criticizers have followed from time immemorial.



I read about an incident somewhere. Arjuna forgets what Krishna said some time after the Gita discourse was given. Krishna tell Arjuna he cannot repeat again what he has said but gives him the Anu Gita discourse. When the Gracious Lord himself does not call Arjuna stupid or his enemies, keeps his discourse personal and yet be always impersonal so can we be.
