I agree I appreciated the good review of Sri Nityanandaji but even Sri Nityanandaji has not called the authors work under consideration silly or stupid. Reviewing criticizing,cautioning readers and protesting against an authors view is perfect and is always encouraged but calling any work stupid silly crazy etc and using a language which is considered to be ad-hominem nature, rude language and making personal attacks I don't know. I just expressed my view. I am fine with any opinion If its not ad-hominem nature I stand corrected and withdraw my statement
