Misra has done an excellent job: a veritable model of dignified and responsible review.

  

Today there is a mushroom growth of "interpreters" full of "insights" into every ancient text, especially Hindu texts - a free-for-all arena!

  

There was this devout and confident "scholar" who spoke at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bangalore, who said :

  

The Upanishads are full of stories. One Upanishad, especially. Its name itself indicates that. It is called Kathopanishad !

  

Another gem from the same mouth:

  

India is a chariot of light. Look at its name. Bha means light; and ratha is chariot. So Bharatha is a chariot of light!

  

Of the same ilk is Pattanaik: Make etymology easy - transliterate the Sanskrit word in English; you will get more insights!
