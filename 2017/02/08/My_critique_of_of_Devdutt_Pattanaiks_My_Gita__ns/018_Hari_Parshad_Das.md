my pranams to vidvaj-janas.  
  
The points made in this critique are technically correct. in many places in Mr. Pattnaik's Gita interpretation, there has been a serious deviation from the traditional positions. Thank you Nityanand ji for putting immense hardwork in this. It was certainly the need of the hour.  
  
At the same time, please allow me to say something. I am saying this to all vidvans, not only Nityanand ji.  
  
If many vidvans keep bashing him or hurling curses and abuses at him, i doubt that it will help. Our final aim is to help him understand that he has done a disservice to the traditional interpretations of the Gita.  
  
His modern interpretation may also inspire other authors from the West to write their own Gitas (andha-paramparā-nyāya), which can quickly snowball into a big problem.  
  
Maybe if someone knows him personally (someone whom he listens to), then they can sit down with him and try to calmly explain the points in a non-confrontational way to him.  
  
There is nothing incorrect in being famous. He must have put genuine hardwork in promoting and marketing his books, giving interviews etc., so our aim should ideally be to tackle the problematic areas rather than defame him or make him feel threatened.  
  
I noticed that a day after the first part of the critique was published, he (Devdutt) started abusing brahmins on his Twitter. This was clearly a reaction to the threat that he perceived. This may further isolate him from developing a mindset of acceptance.  
  
This is purely my opinion — if the end result is that he becomes more negative and anti-brahmin, then our purpose will not truly be achieved. Let someone who knows him personally sit down with him and try to make him understand. Online refutations, e-mails etc. are impersonal in nature and may easily cause misunderstandings. We often end up saying things online which we may never say to a person on his face. This causes misunderstandings big time.  
  
His biggest misfortune is that he has not heard the Gita from a traditional guru. Let someone go to him and explain it in a way that he can digest and accept. Otherwise, i doubt if it will be much effective. Our aim is not to make him our enemy, or to put him into an "us versus you" situation, but to help him understand where he has been incorrect and to help him correct his books and perspectives in life. Just my opinion.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,
