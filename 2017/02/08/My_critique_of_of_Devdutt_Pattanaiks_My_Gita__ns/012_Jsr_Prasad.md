Ajit ji,

  

This is no less than a cultural denigration, and a possible distortion. Think, if such books prevail in society and read by an array of laymen, what could they pass on to next generations? I don't sit quitely when my house is burgled and property is bring stolen. No list is a tapovanam, and being torch bearers of our culture, we have no exception here.  
  
Regards
