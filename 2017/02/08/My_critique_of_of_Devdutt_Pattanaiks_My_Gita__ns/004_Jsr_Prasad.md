The review is a scholarly, logical argument to expose the self claimed purana expert, Mr. Pattanaik, who even do not know the clear distinction between common and important words like ज्ञान-विज्ञान, ब्रह्म-ब्राह्मण etc. By demonstrating his ignorance under different headings, the review emphasizes on why Sanskrit knowledge is essential to paraphrase/interpret/translate any profound Sanskrit text. Congrats. Also, you've got appreciative comments in the review page. गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या किमन्यैः शास्त्रविस्तरैः ।
