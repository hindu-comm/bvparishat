How can I help joinig you all in congratulating aadaraNIya Nityanandji for his review with his characteristic excellence?

  

I met Dr Devdutt Pattanaik (medical doctor by training) in April 2013.

  

Used to answer his questions, correcting him when necessary, with a positive opinion that he was helping the modern generation get educated about Puranic stories etc.

  

I remember correcting him about this Brah + manas etymology of Brahman only. But still he seems to have repeated the error in this book too.

  

The objective behind aadaraNIya Nityanandji's review, that the younger generation with whom Dr Pattanaik is popular should not be mislead, is valid and laudable.

  

'My' in the title of the book may indicate that the author wants to say that he is exercising his right to view and present the book from his own perspective.

  

AadaraNIya Nityanandji is not finding fault with his perspective and is not denying him the right to have such a perspective. The errors he pointed out are with regard to elementary issues such as understanding Sanskrit words, their etymologies etc., where there is no scope for perspective.

  

Such geniuses as Sri Nityanandji in the younger generation give great hope for the future of the Sanskrit studies.

  

Hope his endeavor will be received with open mind by Dr Pattanaik too.
