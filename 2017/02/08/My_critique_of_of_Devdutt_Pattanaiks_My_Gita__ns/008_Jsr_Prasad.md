Well said sir!  

Meanings of Katha and Bharata are a revelation to us :) He should definitely listen and translate the मोदकैस्ताडय story.. If such rebuttals are not attempted, Devadatta may metamorphose into devanaam-priyah! We need more young genius (as Prof. Paturi fondly calls him) like Nityananda ji!
