Rajiv Malhotra earlier had communicated me about the doubtful scholarship

of Devdutt, apparently his misappropriation of phrases without acknowledging.

But Nitanandji's observations point to a serious case of illiteracy and an extreme

eagerness to sell books through arbitrary construction. I have communicated to

Sri Devdutt and hopefully he would mend.  I have not read any of his books,

but believe that he has skills in story-telling. I wish he keeps away from the

scriptures. Ignorance is not a bliss! He seems stuck in nineteenth century.
