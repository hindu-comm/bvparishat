Dear fiends,  
  

Namaste,  
  
I have a query. A composition of Aryabhatta is called Aryabhatiya. There is one opinion that the author's name has to be aryabhata and not Aryabhatta, while the opponents say that The word Aryabhatiya is coined as the word Aryabhattiya will not meet the metric requirement.  May be scholars will like to clarify this.  
  

Regards,
