Professor K.V.Sarma firmly believed the name to be ¡ryabha¶a. He was extremely reticent to criticize others but told his view about the name to me. *Bha**¶¶a* is from *bh**¤tya* and *bha**¶a* from *bh**¤ta*; *¡ryabha¶¶a,* then, will mean ‘servant of Arya’ and *¡ryabha¶a* ‘brought up by ¡rya’ ie of noble rearing.

This is more plausible for the astronomer.
