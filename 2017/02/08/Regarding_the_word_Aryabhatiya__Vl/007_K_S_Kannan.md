Thanks for the important traditional explanation.

  

The sense(s) of *bhaṭta* and *bhartṛ* appear, however, to coincide if not coalesce.

  

Just as we have *bhṛta* prākṛtising into *bhaṭa (Cf. kṛta* and *kaṭa)*,

*bhartṛ* might have prākṛtised into *bhaṭṭa (*or even *bhaṭti)*.

  

Some amount of prākṛtisation is available perhaps even in the Vedic. And even in the *Dhātu-pāṭha*, a good many roots seem to be prākṛtisations, or at least phonetic equivalents of one another.
