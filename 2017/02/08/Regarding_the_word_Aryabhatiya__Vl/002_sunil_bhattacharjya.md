Namaste,  
  

It will be kind of you if you can kindly send a pdf of the paper. LIke others I was also thinking that the name Aryabhatta, might have been given to him as his book "Aryabhatiya" was in the Arya meter. I am not aware if the name Aryabhata makes any sense. I am open to correction.  
  

Regards,,
