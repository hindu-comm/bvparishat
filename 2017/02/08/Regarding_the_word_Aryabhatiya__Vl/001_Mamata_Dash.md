The word is Aryabhata. Prof. K.V. Sarma has a long article on this name. I will try to upload this article. The article named "Aryabhata : His name and Provenance" has been published in the book "Facets of Indian Astronomy" published by Rashtriya Saanskrit Sansthan, Tirupati, in 2009 ed. by Prof. Siniruddha Dash.  

If you are not able to get the article. I wil try to upload the soft copy.  

with regards  

Mamata Dash (Mishra)
