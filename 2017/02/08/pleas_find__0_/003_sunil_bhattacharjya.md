No, not at all determined to prove that the name was Aryabhatta. You missed my statement that the name mentioned in a poetic composition has to care for the meter but not so necessarily in a prose composition. I wanted the scholars to opine if had his name been Aryabhatta, it could have been written as Aryabhattiya.  
  

Hope this clarifies my query.
