Dear K.Ramasubramanianji,  
  

Thank you for your comment, though it appears to be quite hasty for two reasons.  
  
Firstly, you have not read the earlier thread, which lead to the present thread. Now my original query has been replied to by Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya very adritly and Prof Kannan and Shri Nityananandaji also added their views.  
  

Secondly I wrote in the beginning itself quite humbly that I am open for ccorrection. Does this show any arrogance or show of scholarship. Anyway you have probably thought it fit to bramd as show of poor scholarship.  
  

May be, you thought that trying look anew at what Prof K.V.Sharma said was blasphemous, as you seem to probably consider him as infallible.  
  

Sincerely,  

skb  

.
