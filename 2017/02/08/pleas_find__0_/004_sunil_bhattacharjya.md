Sorry, there is a rephrasing, to make the query clear  
  
For the sentence :

  

I wanted the scholars to opine if had his name been Aryabhatta, it could have been written as Aryabhattiya.  

  

kindly read as:  

I wanted the scholars to opine in case his name had been Aryabhatta, could it have been written in verse as Aryabhattia. .  

  

Regards,
