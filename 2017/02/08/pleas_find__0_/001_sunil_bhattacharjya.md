Thank you Mamataji for the paper of K.V.Sarma.  
  
There were two Aryabhattas (or Aryabhatas). The one who lived before Varahamihira and the other after Varahamihira. Alberuni also mentions two Aryabhattas. Moreover the verse which says as 3600 of Kali has another version which leads to 1800 of Kali. If my memory serves me right the former has "shashtir yadA' and the latter has "ShashtyArdha". The famous astronomer Prabodh Chandra Sengupta seems to have given the second. Dr. Kosla Vepa quotes another version of the verse, which says 360 of Kali. Probably I cannot go far in this thread. If the friends here wish, another thread can be opened on the two Aryabhattas and their dates.  
  

Continuing the subject of the thread, my query will be "Is there any possibility that people tried to derive the name from Aryabhatiya". I pose this question because, to my knowledge, Aryabhatta himself had not given his name in any prose composition.  
  

Regards,
