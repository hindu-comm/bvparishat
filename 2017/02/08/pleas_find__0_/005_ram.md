Generally a doubt arises under one the circumstances: (i) when there is insufficient information, and (ii) when there is conflicting testimony.  

It is perfectly understandable for a scholar who has not read Aryabhatiya carefully \[case (i)\] to seek clarification on whether the name of the author of this text is Aryabhata or Aryabhatta.  

Dr. Mamta Dash was kind enough to circulate the paper of Prof KV Sarma to help scholars get this doubt clarified. Prof. Sarma in this paper amply clarifies --- by giving almost a dozen references for the original sources starting with the work Aryabhatiya itself --- that the name of the author is only Aryabhata and NOT Aryabhatta. The arguments presented are quite impeccable.  

Notwithstanding this, and in the absence of any inconsistency or incompatibility, still writing Aryabhatta is tantamount to (i) expressing doubts over statements found in scores of ancient texts, or (ii) being puerile (to use the same phrase as Prof. Sarma) and exhibiting poor scholarship.

Best regards,

-ram.
