'Arya-bhata' is a primary derivative and 'Aryabhatiiyam' is a secondary derivative with *a taddhita* suffix. How can you derive a primary word from a secondary derivative? Further, I think, you did not read Prof. K.V. Sarma's paper properly. He clearly states, at three places, in the beginning and ending verses, Aryabhata himself mentions his name as so. About a dozen ancient scholars starting from Brahmagupta mention his name without duplicating 't' in his name. But, you seem to be determined to call him 'Aryabha**tta**' only!
