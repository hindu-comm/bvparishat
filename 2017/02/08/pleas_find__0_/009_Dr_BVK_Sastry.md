Namaste



A slightly deviant mode of thinking on the given word may help to resolve the issue:



**Present thinking** : ‘ Arya-bhata’ Or ‘Arya –bhatta’ is ONE SINGLE WORD and NAME of a PERSON.



**Proposed thinking : **Look at ‘Arya’ and ‘Bhatta’ as TWO well known
Honorific Titles (maryADA vAcahaka) .

****

**Reason:** There are usages like ‘Arya-MishraiH’ ( Two honorific titles in one word, as a heightened respect’ ! where ‘AryaiH’ or
‘MishraiH’ could have been enough. See ‘bhagavat-pAda-AchArya –varyAH’



**Benefit**: No need to fight with Vyakarana or Chandas . Can the author refer to his own work with respect and/ or by his own name ? What is wrong in it ? What prevents it from such a convention ? Except the ‘ wild imaginations of the researcher’ ?



Did the author carry a real name ? I don’t think this question ever bothered many ancient scholars ? Do we have a given name for ‘ Kalidasa’ beyond a legend ? OR does it so much matter to appreciate and use the magnum opus work?
