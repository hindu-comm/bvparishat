Namaste

I request clarification and help in understanding the ‘ question raised in the post’, apparently simple and straight forward, but makes the issue complex due to the explanation on ‘Veda’ I read in other posts and ‘Samskruth language historicity’ in some other posts.

1. IF One uses ‘‘Veda’ as ‘ Ateendriya Darshana’, a ‘Shruti’, this kind of question on \< मन्त्रविषये स्वरस्य> ‘ below does not arise. Swara is a part of ‘mantra darshana’.

 It is not human construction for embellishment, like musical ‘swara prasataara’.

2. IF One is asking about generating an ‘ Accented Samskrutha –Bhashaa conversation (व्याकरणविहितस्वरानुसारं सम्भाषितुं ) ’ where ‘Swara’ is decided using Paninian rules, THEN the question is untenable!

 For the method of applying SWARA –PRAKRIYAA properly for Prakruti, Pratyaya and PRakriyaa is a tradition that has entered coma-state in India, post Sayana Madhava period ! where in ‘ the Shadanga Saanga Veda adhayayana’ suffered splintered model of learning ! So the focus has been manly on ‘ Vedic texts: PADA Shuddhi and Patha-Krama Siddhi through the Ashta vikruti’ with not so much importance given to the guidance provided in Nirukta or even works like Brihad Devataa, Rigartha Deepikaa and the like. The ‘ SWARA -VINIYOGA’ is absent !

 Swara-Rule base quoting is NOT the same as \< व्याकरणविहितस्वरानुसारं सम्भाषितुं \> Conversation setting where in the speaker speaks with total awareness of the ‘Swaras’.

Having said that, there are enough Indian diasporic languages and other languages in the world, where the ‘ accent modulation’ alters the basic communication. Example : Newari, a version of speaking Nepali language. Which has drawn upon the ‘Sa-Swara Conversation’ for Specific Communication. Similarly Chinese language flavors are distinguished with accents. 

The fact remains that these are entering the ‘ endangered /endangered language border’.

3. IF one is speaking of ‘Accented Language usage’ per Classical Samskrit Rule base conformity, it is an exercise of ‘Classical language Speaking’; and there does not seem to be any audience who would grasp the nuances of the ‘Swara’. For today’s audience, the nuance of accent on ‘ Indra-Shatru’ makes no difference. Forget about this subtle nuance of shifts in ‘sa-sha –Sha’ OR ‘a-ha-visarga’, alpa-prana –mahaprana’
critical for Samskrutham.

4. On \< तर्कं विना स्वरानुसारिणमर्थमवगन्तुं \> No language term and sentence can be comprehended for its meaning without a \< Logic>. Unless one is directly visioning the Voice and articulating as a ‘ medium’. The issue needs a further investigation. 

In this backdrop, I would love to be told by knowledgeable persons on how to understand the question made through this post; and my noting above are off the mark, of course , with a \< तर्कं \>.
