Hello All,

  

I came across one list fromSanskrit-Literature-Of-Kerala \[ <http://dli.ernet.in/bitstream/handle/2015/124847/Sanskrit-Literature-Of-Kerala.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y> \] in this page no. 104 gives list of Ramapanivada works and were it is been published. In this journal of kerala university manuscript library, Trivandrum Vol 1 and 2 1945-46 Mukunda Shatakam was published with commentary. Kindly requesting if any one have soft copy please share.

  

Secondly, in the this link \[https://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/मुकुन्दशतकम्\] there are two types ofद्वौ पाठौ वर्तेते**विष्णुविलासः and** मुकुन्दशतकम्. Wanted to know is these both same?

  

Thanks
