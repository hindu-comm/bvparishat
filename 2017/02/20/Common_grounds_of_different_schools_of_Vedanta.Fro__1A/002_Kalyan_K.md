Dear Sri Nagaraj

  

IMO, first we have to define what are the vedAntic schools that we are going to consider. Following come to my mind -

  

1\. bhedAbheda

2\. advaita

3\. vishishTha-advaita

4\. dvaita

5\. achintya bhedAbheda

6\. shuddhAdvaita

7\. dvaitAdvaita

  

Members are free to add other schools. Technically, anybody who has written an independent commentary on the Brahmasutras can be considered to have established a new system of Vedanta.
