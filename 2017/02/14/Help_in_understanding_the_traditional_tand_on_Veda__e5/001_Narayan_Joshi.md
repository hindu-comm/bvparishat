Dear BVK, This debate is very ancient going on from the time of Yaaska or from many centuries before Yaaska. In the book of Bishnupada Bhattacharya (Nirukta of Yaaska) the last chapter is devoted to interpretation of Vedas from two angles--Aitihaasika and Aatmavaadins. Why am I inclined towards Aitihaasika because the connection of legendsfrom Vedas to the whole Asia. I discussed this many times on BVP. Thanks. NRJOSHI
