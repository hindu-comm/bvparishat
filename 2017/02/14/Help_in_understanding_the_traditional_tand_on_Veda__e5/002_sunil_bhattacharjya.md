Namaste,  
  

One can get some chronological information from some of the astronomical data given in the Vedas, but by and large, the itihasa comes under the purview of the fifth Veda, consisting of the Puranas and the the two epics. In short, the puranas have to meet the pancha-lakshanas (five criteria) and one criterion of them being the updating of the genealogies.
