Namaste



I place below an extract from Sri Bannanje Govindacharyas work :



**Question** : What is the stand of current scholars of tradition in connecting the word ‘**Veda**’ and efforts to extract ‘ **itihAsa**’ ? Should one go by Efforts anchored to Trust and Faith : ***Shraddha*** ( as indicated on page 28) or other evidences which are being pulled out in current archeological and other research ? OR are the two teams talking of different models of ‘Veda’ – Itihasa connection ? 



The official stand has a bearing on how Vedas are to be studied in current period .
