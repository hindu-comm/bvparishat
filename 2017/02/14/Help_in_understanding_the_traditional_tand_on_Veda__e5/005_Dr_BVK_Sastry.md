Namaste



Clarifying and amplifying the focus of the initial issue raised:



1. All four sub-interpretations are different perspectives of looking at one core issue: ‘Veda’ – Itihasa connection’.



 This varies within and beyond the frame of Tradition (From early period say as used in vedic documents, Vedanga schools) and carried forward through the three main Vedanta - Acharyas and Six Darshana Shastras and several Dharma Shastras : Which portray a specific understanding of the words Veda- Itihasa and their connection to Native Indian communities till say a cutoff date of 1700 C.E.



So,What is the Core basic understanding ? conveyed in this text, reading : Kastaavat asmat –samayaH? What is our convention and frame of thought at present times, in the Acharya Madhva schools and for study of Upanishads as part of Vedas ? What is the meaning of this contemporary writing and teaching pedagogy in the year of publication ?



2. When the author Sri Bannanje Govindacharya says : ‘ itihaso naama
na nirantaraa sarla-rekha; kintu chakra-bhramanam’ :: itihasa indeed is not an unbroken and always linear straight line; but it is a cyclic in its process, like a rotating wheel . What is to be understood ?
- If itihaasa is Linear and/ or Cyclic ‘ Itihasa’ ( = History), is it a recourse to time cycle periodicity like Yuga-Chakra , where a small stretch of say a ‘ ten millennia ( from 7000 BCE to 21^(st) century) would just be an almost insignificant curve, good to be called as a ‘ linear – model History’? What is the Time-Cycle Linearity Conception and connection in understanding Veda through Itihasa ?
Because, such a model brings in a challenge of understanding the history of Language, Word- Meaning- Interpretation tools ? 



Sri Bannanje quotes a refutation of Sayana’s view by Dayananda Saraswati on interpretation of Vedic legends in the frame of
‘itihasa’. 

The view of Yaska, as interpreted by commentator Durgacharya is given explaining Veda- itihasa realtion. If not for the commentary, the word ‘ upekshitavyah’ would mean ‘ should be ignored as of no value’. But the commentary makes it totally different. According to the commentary, the word ‘ upekshitavyah’ means ‘ it should be taken as accepted, conforming, validated’. (This is page 26 of print text at url: : <https://archive.org/stream/UpanishatChandrikafirstPart_926/UpanishathChandrikaPart1#page/n0/mode/2up> . And Skandaswamy’s view is a balancing act.

Unless the Home-Team is clear on these primaries, there cannot be a confident surge forward in rebuttal or measure of deviation / distortion / dilution and demand for battle: Sanskrit.

Is this question focused on apaurusheyatva vis-a-vis aitihaasikataa (in the sense of history or not in the sense of history) of Veda ?



or



Is it about the possibility of aitihaasika (historical) material available in Veda?



or



Is it about names of different narratives such as itihaasa being mentioned in Veda?



or



Is it about different narratives belonging to various genres such as itihaasa being found in Veda?

I place below an extract from Sri Bannanje Govindacharyas work :



**Question** : What is the stand of current scholars of tradition in connecting the word ‘**Veda**’ and efforts to extract ‘ **itihAsa**’ ? Should one go by Efforts anchored to Trust and Faith : ***Shraddha*** ( as indicated on page 28) or other evidences which are being pulled out in current archeological and other research ? OR are the two teams talking of different models of ‘Veda’ – Itihasa connection ? 

The official stand has a bearing on how Vedas are to be studied in current period .
