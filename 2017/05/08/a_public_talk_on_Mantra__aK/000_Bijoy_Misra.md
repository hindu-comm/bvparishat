Dear friends,  

I was invited by our town for a public lecture in a series called  

Lincoln Academy. I chose to speak on Mantra.  

The video of the lecture is at the town site  
<https://lincolntv.viebit.com/player.php?hash=3NpkMOZQZL5T>  

I am sharing the slides in the attachment.  

Thank you.
