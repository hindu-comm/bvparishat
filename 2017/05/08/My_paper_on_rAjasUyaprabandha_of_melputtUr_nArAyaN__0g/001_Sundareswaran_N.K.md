This is the gist:***Rajasuyaprabandha* is one of the many campukavya-s written by Melputtur Narayana Bhatta. Bhattap¡da narrates the story of Yudhishthira’s performance of Rajasuya, that is told in the *Mahabharata* in his *Rajasuyaprabandha*. The Rajasuya is an elaborate complex of many srauta rituals which spread over almost two year’s time span.  
This paper proposes a conjecture that Bhatta is inspired by a practical manual, meant for practitioners, for easy remembrance of the ritualistic procedure. This manual could probably be from outside Kerala.
