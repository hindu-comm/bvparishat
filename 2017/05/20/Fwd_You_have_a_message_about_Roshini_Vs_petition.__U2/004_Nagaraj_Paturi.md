We rejected a repeat of the forwarding by Sri Krishnadev Shukla-ji of the same petition page from Change.org.

  

If Sri Krishnadev Shukla-ji is reading these mails, we expect him to tell us

  

1\. whether he read my responses

  

2\. If read, why he is repeating the forwarding nuisance.

  

If he does not tell us anything , we may have to assume that he does not read the messages here. If he does not, but just posts, that is not in order. We may have to consider whether continuance of his membership is sensible.
