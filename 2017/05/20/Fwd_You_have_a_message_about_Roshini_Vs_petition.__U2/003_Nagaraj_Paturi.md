The petition says,

  

"It is requested to give a choice of subject (among the 14 subjects) at least in the Paper 3 and the candidates may be given a chance to prove their knowledge in the subject they have studied."

  

But the syllabus paper has already provided what is being requested in the petition. Thus the petition is redundant.

  

The syllabus paper says :

  

Paper III has two parts : A & B.

  

A for 160 marks; B for 40 marks.

  

A has 10 short notes questions (300 words) for 16 marks each. 10 x 16 = 160 marks. Each question has internal choice with one question from each of the 10 units listed with clearly delineated subtopics in each.

  

B has an essay question (800 words) for 40 marks. Here 14 questions from each of the 14 electives is given. Candidate is asked to answer only one of these 14.

  

Probably person drafting the petition did not follow the instructions given in Hindi. (Sanskrit or English might have been more helpful)

  

In paper II, which is of 50 multiple choice questions, there is no choice. To my mind, this part is the problematic one, as there is no choice here.

  

If the petitioner is OK with this part, petition itself is unnecessary.
