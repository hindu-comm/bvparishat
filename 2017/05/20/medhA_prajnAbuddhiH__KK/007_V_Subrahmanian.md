This is very well said. This indeed is the core message of the Upanishads. The Kenopanishat puts it very succinctly:

  

केनेषितंपतति प्रेषितं मनः केन प्राणः प्रथमः प्रैति युक्तः।  

केनेषितां वाचमिमां वदन्ति चक्षुःश्रोत्रं क उ देवो युनक्ति ॥ १ ॥

  

श्रोत्रस्य श्रोत्रं मनसो मनो यद्वाचो ह वाचं स उ प्राणस्य प्राणः।  

चक्षुषश्चक्षुरतिमुच्य धीराः प्रेत्यास्माल्लोकादमृता भवन्ति ॥ २ ॥

  

The entire gamut of activity is covered by these mantras. The Supreme Consciousness that is behind all activity is Brahman and it is necessary for one to realize That in order to attain liberation. That the Gayatri mantra is so intricately connected to the Upanishadic message is its greatness.
