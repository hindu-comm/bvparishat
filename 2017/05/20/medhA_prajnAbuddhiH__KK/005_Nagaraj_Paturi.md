What is used as a dhyana sloka of gayatri during japa is in fact a verse form elaboration /interpretation of the mantra:

  

यो देवस्सवितास्माकं धियो धर्मादि गोचराः \|

प्रेरयेत्तस्य यद्भर्गः तद्वरेण्यमुपास्महे \|\|

  

In this you may notice that dhiyah is followed by its explanation /description 'dharmādigōcarāh'. Sayana Bhashya (below) says that dhiyah means karma-s.

Thus dhiyah refers to all the activities- physical, mental, spiritual etc., that take place in a jeeva , a living entity. savitr̥ dēvatā is being viewed as the inner source that creates/generates and drives/runs all theactivities- physical, mental, spiritual etc. Those activities *are not being asked for.* They are already there, being generated and run all the time. Gayatri Mantra has the statement that we are *focusing our attention on/getting absorbed in (the experience of)*the most choosable /choicest/best (varēṇiyam) radiance of the source that generates and runs these activities.

  

mēdhā is one of the dhiyah. mēdhā eruditeintelligence, clever scholarship, is a kind of prajñā =intellect. buddhih is another kind of prajñā. Rational, logical, discursive, discerning, discriminating, differentiating, reasoning, thinking and decision making aspects of
prajñā come under buddhi as contrasted with hr̥daya , the feeling, emotional, experiencing, sympathizing, relishing, enjoying aspects of prajñā. prajñā is one of the dhiyah = the activities- physical, mental, spiritual etc., that take place in a jeeva , a living entity.
