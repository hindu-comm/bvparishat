1\. Gaayatree Mantra is a Vedaantargata mantra. DakshiNaamurtimantra is not.

  

2\. Gaayatree mantra is in the form a statement " I meditate upon ........ which drives/inspires/generates our dhiyah" but not in the form of "buddhi is desired" (buddhih ishyate) or I seek buddhi.

  

3\. Dhiyah covers many more faculties than just buddhi.

  

4.It is a different matter that DakshiNaamoorti is also viewed as a form of Gaayatree. But that does not mean we should mix up mantras and concepts.

  

5\. Samanvaya of two concepts should be done only after each of the two concepts is understood in its own right.
