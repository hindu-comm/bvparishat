There is a shloka in a vedAnta text called saMxepa-shArIraka (2.63):  
  

आरम्भवाद: कणभक्षपक्ष:; सङ्घातवादस्तु भदन्तपक्ष: \|  

साङ्ख्यादिपक्ष: परिणामवादो; वेदान्त पक्षस्तु विवर्तवाद: \|\|  
  

Arambha vAda belongs to vaisheShika school, samutpAda vAda belongs to Buddhism, pariNAma vAda belongs to schools like sA.nkhya, and vivarta vAda belongs to vedAnta.  
  

(सङ्घातवाद may be replaced by समुत्पादवाद as a more general law of causality in Buddhism in the above verse.)  
  
Vivarta envelops other causalities if "asat" is treated as one of the nyAya categories of absence (abhAva) other than atyntAbhAva (absolute absence or non-existence). Neurologists today will have no problem with the appearance (Vivarta) theory because they know that brain is the decoder of the Reality into appearances. We do not have direct access to the Reality. This decoding cannot be explained because the brain's neural states can be observed only from a third party perspective even when we observe our own neural states. There is an incontrovertible gap between Actuality (appearance) and the underlying Reality (if we have to use Kantian terminology). Thus, science has more to agree than to disagree with vedAnta in this particular respect.  
  

Superimposition (adhyAsa or adhyAropa) as "one reality projected or superimposed on another reality" can be interpreted in various ways. One interesting analogy with Holographic Conjecture is given in my own post in Science-Religion-Philosophy group (linked [here.)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/science-religion-philosophy/onfE4r5puew/RO0YumryjLsJ;context-place=forum/science-religion-philosophy)  

  
The pratItya-samutpAda (PS) may be ideally used as a pedagogical method (prakrIyA) of vedAnta to show that we conceptually need AtmA (acosmic Self) to explain the "empirical self" precisely because PS is reduced to non-Self (anAtmA). The ghatAkAsha-mahAksha analogy is useful here.  
  

PS otherwise can metamorphose into a holistic law of causality on the large scale for physical (non-living) matter. Perhaps this is not the place to show how Mach's principle is an expression of PS, and how it can be used for deriving GR equations; but one thing needs to be registered: PS type interdependent causality works quite well on a very large scale (in fact on universal scale) and gives us tangible results. Vedanta should have no problem with Mach or Buddha in their respective approaches. Theses approaches ultimately will have to yield to vedAnta's acosmic Atman or jIva-sAxin when we come to living and sentient beings.  
  

Science should have no problem with sA.nkhya satkArya-vAda either.. at least as of today. The prakRRiti (avyakta, the seed of jagat in vedAnta) causes mahat or buddhi in the form of intelligence of the physical laws of science and then causes ahaMkAra the tendency to grow and separate into multiple objects. This fits well within so called BB theory to the extent we know today. Atomic combination of vaishShika (AraMbha) also may be reconciled with science in one way or the other (but I am not sure if we really have to do that when we know so much now about particle physics in the form of Standard Model).  
  

I am also not sure how much of all these will be covered in the course. Hopefully, the approach is not of establishing the superiority of vedAnta over science or vice-versa but to appreciate the ingenuity of ancient Indians. They could get following insight through simple observations and contemplation: (a) Consciousness is fundamental, (b) World is an appearance, (c) self=Self (after relational content is removed from self).
