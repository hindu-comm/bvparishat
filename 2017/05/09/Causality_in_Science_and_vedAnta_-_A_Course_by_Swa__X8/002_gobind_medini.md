Salutations to organizers and teachers of this proposed seminar.  
  

One point from YouTube presentation attracted my attention. Yes, Vedanta, like some other Astika and Nastika schools, take a holistic view of the Universe. That is the ancient Indian genius.. but to say that Science view the universe in bits and pieces is not entirely correct. If science explores the quantum level, it also explores the large scale structure in a holistic manner. Gravity forces us to take a holistic view. General Relativity (GR) has already applied this view to the models of the Universe. Even the explicitly holistic Machain view is applied to derive the GR equations. Now what remains is to marry this holistic GR view to the micro view of bits and pieces (Quantum Physics). Can Vedanta give any insight here? Vedanta can treat science as its most exhaustive prakriyA in the realm of vyvahAra in finding the objective truth. This is the kind of delegation where science has full autonomy.  
  

The presentation also briefly talked about pramANa-s. Does Vedanta's approach (it is really mImAMsA approach) of svataH-pramANa, parataH apramANa conforms to epistemology of science? Or Bauddha approach of parataH pramANa decided by the prApakatva (process of verifying evidential results and utility) comes closer to the scientific epistemology? I am sure all this will be discussed in the seminar.
