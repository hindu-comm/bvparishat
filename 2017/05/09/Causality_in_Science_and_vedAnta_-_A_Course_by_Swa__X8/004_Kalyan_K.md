Progress in Science and Technology is unlikely to occur with the world-negating view of advaita-vedAnta. The advaitin would treat everything apart from brahma vidya as apara vidya. Since advaita was the dominant philosophy of India during the medieval period, perhaps that is the reason why India has not seen much innovation in the field of Science during this period and most of the progress in Science had to come from Europe.

  

On the other hand, in my opinion, Dvaita and VishishTha-advaita, which treat the world as real are more conducive to scientific progress, but compared to advaita, their influence has been limited.
