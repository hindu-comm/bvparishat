Dear Sri Kalyan K,

  

The topic here is the comparison between philosophical issue of causality as seen in Science and the same as seen in a philosophical school of Vedanta called Advaita Vedanta.  

  

There is no causality between the prevalent school of Vedanta in a country and progress of Science and Technology in that country, nor is this causality the topic of the course.

  

The course is focused on Science not Technology.

  

Since the causality between the prevalent school of Vedanta in a country and progress of Science and Technology in that country is not the focus of the course which is announced in the thread, this post of you is a misfit in this thread. No further discussion on these lines is allowed in this thread.
