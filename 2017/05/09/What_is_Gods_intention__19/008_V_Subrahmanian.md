Thanks for reminding this Patanjali yoga sutra. Since that matam is not admitted in the Brahma sutra as Vedantic, by the refutation 'etena yogaH pratyuktaH', the Ishwara, purusha visheshaH, according to them, is saguna and therefore does not contradict the (advaita) Vedantic position of avachyatva of Brahman.

  

I am reminded of a Paninian specification for where a shabda can be used: jati, kriya, guna, sambandha. In Shankara's system since the Upanishadic Brahman is bereft of all these, no word can be used to directly denote it.

  

It would be interesting to note a verse from the mahopanishat 4.54 / Laghu Yoga vAsiShTha utpatti prakaraNam 1.12:  

  
ऋतमात्मापरं ब्रह्म सत्यमित्यादिका बुधैः ।  
कल्पिता व्यवहारार्थं तस्य संज्ञा महात्मनः ॥4.54॥  
  
\[In order to facilitate parlance, the wise employ words such as Rtam, AtmA, Param, Brahma, Satyam, etc., to designate that Supreme Self.\]

Subrahmanian. V
