Namaste Sri Venkateshji.

  

\- Do we know that Adi Sankara did not leave the material body neither because of "animals and innocent creatures", nor because of God's intention to act?

\- Is there no one else who was protected by lions even though they did not say "नहि नहि रक्षति डुकृञ् करणे"(Bharatha)  

\- Is there no person who was killed because of "animals and innocent creatures" even though he had all the blessings of God (Parikshita Maharaja)?

  
If any one of these is false, the apparent conclusion being made that "Panini was killed by a lion in order to demonstrate that vyakarana is useless" does not hold.
