नहि नहि रक्षति डुकृञ् करणे is only a illustration. It should be read in context. That when in death bed Grammarwon't help. To get Mukti you have to resort to Bhakti. However for Bhakti one has to have to have proper Knowledge (ज्ञान), which can be had through Vedas. For proper understanding to Vedas One needs the knowledge of Grammar.
