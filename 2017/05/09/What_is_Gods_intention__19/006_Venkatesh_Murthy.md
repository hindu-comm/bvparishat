Namaste Sri Korada sir  
  
Thank you for giving a detailed reply. नहि निन्दा न्याय is a good  
explanation for नहि नहि रक्षति डुकृञ् करणे and शब्दजालं महारण्यं  
चित्तभ्रमणकारणम्. But there is also Upanisadic Vakya यतो वाचो  
निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह it is telling us Brahman cannot be grasped  
by words and thoughts. Both words and mind cannot even reach Brahman.  
Then what are Vedas and Vedanta describing? They are saying things  
like अयमात्मा ब्रह्म, प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म, तत् त्वम् असि, अहं  
ब्र्ह्मास्मि and so on. What is this Brahman they are describing?  
  
The answer is they are describing उपहित ब्रह्म but not शुद्ध ब्रह्म.  
The शुद्ध ब्रह्म cannot be grasped by words and thoughts. There is no  
word in the entire universe with वाच्यार्थ for Brahman. Someone may  
say the word 'Brahman' itself is sufficient to express Brahman. But  
the word cannot directly describe Brahman but only through लक्ष्यार्थ.
