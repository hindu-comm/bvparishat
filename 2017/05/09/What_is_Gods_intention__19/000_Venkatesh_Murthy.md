Namo Vidvadbhyaha

  

It is said God acts through animals and innocent creatures.

  

A. Adi Sankara said नहि नहि रक्षति डुकृञ् करणे and शब्दजालं महारण्यं चित्तभ्रमणकारणम्. He was protected by a lion from Kapalika's evil intention of human sacrifice.

  

B. Panini the Father of Vyakarana Sutras was killed by a lion.

  

Is there a connection between A and B? What is God's intention?

  

Regards

-Venkatesh
