What I meant by what I said is well captured, or rather explicated, by Misra-ji!

  

Also compare how *Chāndogya* starts with a "*rasa*-theory":

the sequence

*bhūta-pṛthivī-ap-oṣadhi-puruṣa-vāc-ṛc-sāman-Udgītha*

presented in an ascending scale of essentiality (*rasa*),

(a veritable "*oct*essentiality" in lieu of the well-known quintessentiality - as per the confession of the text itself, I mean), and none to surpass the last, which Itself is

the *parama parārdhya*, the *summum infinitum.*

*  
*

If it be accosted that the gradation is itself a degradation, so be it - for an equal sin is committed in the *ānanda*-*mīmāṁsā* section of another *upaniṣad*.
