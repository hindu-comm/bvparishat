Dear Venkat Sriram

  

Valmiki describes thought processes many many times - for example, in Sundara Kanda of Hanuman and Sita. Mere thinking various thoughts as they come should not be judged.  

  

शोकध्यानपरायणां, अबलां, दुर्बलां, दुःखसंतप्तां, पतिशोकेनचाविष्टा, सहचर रहिता इव चक्रवाकी, भग्नमानसा, सा वेपमाना पतिता प्रवाते कदळी यथा, दुःखार्ता शोकोपहतचेतना....etc. None of these show weakness; Sita could have been called weak only if she succumbed to Ravana's advances. As you said, Sita, Hanuman etc even though divine display human characteristics. Strength or weakness depends on course of action - not mere thoughts.

  

regards
