Namaste,

  

Like to know if anybody has read the recent book "Sita - the warrior of Mithila" released by Amish Tripathi. The theme seems to be interesting and Mother Sita has been projected as a 'veera-nAri' unlike the meek, gentle, submissive nature in Valmiki Ramayana.

  

Any reviews would be appreciated. The cover page of the book is too attractive.

  

regs,

sriram
