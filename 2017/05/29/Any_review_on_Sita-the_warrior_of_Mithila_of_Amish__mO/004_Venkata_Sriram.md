Yes Subbuji. In Sundara Kanda:  
  
सा शोकतप्ता बहुधा विचिन्त्य सीताथ वेण्युद्ग्रथनं गृहीत्वा \|  
उद्भुध्य वेण्युद्ग्रथनेन श्रीघ्र महं गमिष्यामि यमस्य मूलम् \|\| (5.28.17)  
  
Under grief, Mother Sita thought of committing suicide by tying Her long hair along Her neck and hanging to the tree.  
  
Then, immediately, She felt some good omens. Ramayana is a 'ध्वनि काव्यं' and these indicate the ups & downs of spiritual journey. These suicide attempts should not be taken in literal sense. The rAmAyaNa should be studied traditionally under sampradAya teacher.
