Dear Shrikant Ji,  
  
I am aware of other side of Mother Sita as another name for rAmAyaNa is "सीतायाः चरितं महत्". She was also compared with embers "शान्तां अग्निशिखामिव , संसक्तां धूमजालेन शिखामिव....". However, we cannot ignore the other attributes as:  
  
शोकध्यानपरायणां, अबलां, दुर्बलां, दुःखसंतप्तां, पतिशोकेनचाविष्टा, सहचर रहिता इव चक्रवाकी, भग्नमानसा, सा वेपमाना पतिता प्रवाते कदळी यथा, दुःखार्ता शोकोपहतचेतना....etc.  
  
These aspects need to be studied and analyzed very carefully. There are also human weaknesses associated with नायक and नायिका that needs our attention. After all, my beloved rAmachandra is मायामानुष विग्रहः and मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तमः.  
  
regs,  
sriram
