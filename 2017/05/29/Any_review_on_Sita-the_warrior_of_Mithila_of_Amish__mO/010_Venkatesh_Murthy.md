Namaste

  

Comparing Damayanti and Seeta we can see both Damayanti and Seeta were abandoned by husband for no fault but they behaved in different ways. If a faultless wife is abandoned by husband she should have right to stay in father's house or get married second time. Damayanti exercised this right but Seeta did not. Who is brave and fearless of the two? The answer is clear.
