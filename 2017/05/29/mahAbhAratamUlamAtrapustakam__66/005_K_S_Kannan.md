I erred in saying Nirnayasagara Press,

whereas I actually meant Gita Press -

the same four volumes.

  

The Gita Press used to print thousands of copies of many original texts (Sanskrit original only) in the past, though they used to publish the text along with translations (typically Hindi) too , but they are, in the last few decades, acutely aware of the extremely poor sales of *Sanskritoriginals only.*

  

Has anyone made, by the way, soft/scanned copies of

all/majority of the publications of the Gita Press?
