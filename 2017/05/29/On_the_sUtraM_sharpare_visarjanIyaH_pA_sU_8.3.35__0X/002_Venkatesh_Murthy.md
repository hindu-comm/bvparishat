Namo Vidvadbhyaha  
  
In Max Mueller's grammar book on Page 8 he says - 'The Visarga  
Jihvamuliya and Upadhmaniya are not now articulated audibly'.  
  
In Monier Williams grammar book on Page 8 he says - 'In some parts of  
India Visarga has a slightly reverberating sound very difficult of  
imitation; thus रामः is almost like रामह, अग्निः like अग्निहि, शिवैः  
like शिवैहि'.  
  
I think this is happening mostly in South India. People are saying  
रामः like रामहा. Instead of राम it रामहा becomes killer of राम. If  
they say कृष्णः like कृष्णहा it becomes killer of कृष्ण.
