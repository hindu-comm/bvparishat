Namaste

This thread is a pointer to a serious issue on the following points, which impact the ' STANDARD OF SAMSKRUTHA VARNA UCCHAARANA' and ' SAMSKRUTHA - PADA - PRAKRIYAA NIRNAYA'. I am sure that Panini and
Vedanga - Vyakarana Sampradaya is clear on the clarity in articulation
and comprehension of the two sounds - Yogavaaha and Visarga :: ह
and - ः

This ‘ Varna- uccharana -shift’ is not limited to ‘ South India’ ! It is a universal phenomenon where ever \< आशक्तैः अभिधातृभिः \> is applicable . This distortion is a result of not following the guideline for Samskruth Studies by using \< शिक्षा \> as foundation to introduce and keep clean the realm of \< व्याकरणम् \>. While one may not be able to pin point who is responsible for this ‘ pedagogic shifts in Samskruth teaching, has made Samskrutham to become Sanskrit ! and ‘Daivee Vak’ to become ‘ maanushee and yantra-vak’. ( A Spiritual language built around the basics of Yoga gets diluted and distorted to become a Social street conversation language for modeling machine interface.> The lament of Mahabhashyakara ( and the figure head of Yoga Sampradaya) reading **न** **हि** **दोषाणां** **लक्षणमस्ति** **--** **महाभाष्यम्** **,** **ङ्याप्** **... 4-1-1****** **** **c****an not be** **stated more** **succinctly****.******

So the question that comes up is : What has been done as a course correction in Sanskrit Teaching, after Max Muller and Monier Williams
provided pointers to the ‘ Dushtataa’ in Varna- ucchaarana ? Almost 100 plus years ago ? Has there been any course correction to introduce ‘ Shuddha Ucchaarana’ of ‘Samskrutha Varna- Maalaa’ in any part of India Vedic studies and get aligned to Panini-Patanjali Standards ? Or Are todays Sanskritists ready to write a R.I.P note on the Swaras
\< ऋ- ऌ - ঃ \> and have them substituted with ‘ Simplified Vyanajanas, Add ‘ Nukta, Chandrabindu symbols and align Sanskrit to the symbols of regional language historical scripting as dictated by the Roman alphabet Character set phonemes> ?

The issue has greater ramifications in the ‘ Decoding of Devanagari Digital Lexicons and Texts’ over which many best brains are spending their energy ?

Look for inputs from Sanskrit-Teaching -Scholars and Techno-Sanskrit- Program Scholars.
