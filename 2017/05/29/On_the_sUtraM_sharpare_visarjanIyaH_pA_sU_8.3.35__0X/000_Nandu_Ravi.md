Dear scholars,

  

I was having a listen to chapter 12 of Gita by Swami Brahmananda (on Gita Supersite) and on verse 13, which is:

  

अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्रः करुण एव च।  
निर्ममो निरहङ्कारः समदुःखसुखः क्षमी।।12.13।।

  

on the fourth पादthe reciter doesn't pronouncethe विसर्ग before the word क्षमी - which should be explicitly pronounced as a विसर्ग and not as a जिह्वमूलीय in accordance with सूत्रं शर्परे विसर्जनीयः (पा सू ८.३.३५).

I further had a listen to a bunch of uploads on YouTube and practically everyone seems to pronounce it as a जिह्वामूलीय। Those that did pronounce विसर्ग on the fourth पाद, however, also uttered the जिह्वामूलीय (the one before the word करुण) on the second पाद as a विसर्ग as well!

Are these reciters ignorant to the सुत्र or is there any other rule which allows them to bypass शर्परे?

  

Thanks in advance,

Nandu Ravi
