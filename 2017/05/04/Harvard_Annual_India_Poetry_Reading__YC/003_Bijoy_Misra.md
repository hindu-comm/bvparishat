At the moment, we are in summer time in the East coast of the US.  

We are nine hours and half behind Indian Standard Time.  

The normal time difference is ten hours and half.  

They advance the clock from April through October in order to simulate  

the perception of a longer duration of daylight.  

Our 2 PM here is 11:30 PM in India in the summer.
