Hari Om Blessed Self,

  

Greetings from CIF!

  

\*New Release\*

  
**Śrī Rāmānuja - The Great Integrator**  
  
It was the golden period of the imperial Cholas a thousand years ago in south India. Yet, the society here as elsewhere had many fault-lines which needed the corrective touch of an incarnational personality. As if the Time Spirit had taken note of all this, Śrī Rāmānuja appeared in the land south of the Vindhyas as a guardian of Sanātana-dharma. During his long life of 120 years (1017-1137 A.D), he successfully strove to integrate the society, teach the people forget caste and credal differences and remain united to save the Vedic religion from external challenges.  
  
There was no aspect of life that was not touched by Śrī Rāmānuja. Towards achieving his ideals, he embraced sannyāsa, became a legendary teacher, a venerated scholar, an excellent management expert of temple culture and a path-breaking social reformer.

  

*Śrī Rāmānuja - The Great Integrator* is an attempt to introduce this multi-faceted personality who avoided confrontation and was unflappable in the face of persecution and calumny. A tireless traveller of India's vast spaces, a fosterer of bhakti to bring people together, his only armour was surrender to the Divine; his sole weapon a love for all creation, for all is the Divine: Iśā vāsyam idam sarvam.

  

The book was released on the 1000th birth anniversary of Śrī Rāmānuja.
