Dear Dr Sundaresan,  

I loved your paper. I have much more to say about शोक and श्लोकत्व.  

Some of the online versions type them erroneously. The translations  

kill the implication through lack of analysis.  

There is a larger fundamental issue of speech making involved in this  

innocent-looking line. We are too busy here in May. I will write to you  

privately about the neurological implications later in the summer.  

Congratulations for writing about it.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
