Excellent article Sundareswaran ji. As भवभूति says 'एको रसः करुण एव', this is achieved with the separation of Sita and Ramachandra and hence again they get separated inउत्तरकाण्डः. Thus, there is an underlying string that connects all the 7 kANDAs and that string of connectivity is the "karuNa rasa".
