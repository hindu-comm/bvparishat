The Rashtriya Samskrita Samsthan edition (4 Tiikaa edition) contains govindarAjiiya and maheshvaraiirtha's tattvadiipikaa (both these are exhaustive) with rAmAnujiiya and tanishlokii. It also costs quite less (Rs. 760 for 6 volumes, 7th volume seems to be index and not available). The print is quite good and font size convenient for older people. You can get it from any Rashtriya Samskrita Samsthan counters. I got it recently from the counter in Chinmaya International foundation, Kerala.

  

The above books are in pothi format and depending on your choice, you may find it inconvenient.

  

A costlier edition (but still very cheap \~1200 Rs) is also published by the same organization and contains Tilaka, bhUShaNa (govindarAjiiya) and shiromaNi. The font size in this 8 volume compilation is quite small. But it is better organized than the 4 Tiikaa edition. Again, you will not get the 8th volume (index) through Rashtriya Samskrita Samsthan. This is a normally organized book with wide margins.
