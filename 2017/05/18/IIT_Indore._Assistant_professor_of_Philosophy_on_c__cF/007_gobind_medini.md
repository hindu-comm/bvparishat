I think there is some confusion.  
  

The advertisement of IIT-Indore was for various posts classified in various categories. There was only one category: School of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) where Sanskrit is relevant. In fact, the initial post by Shri Sundar Sharma-ji was for the post of philosophy; and as I can see, only in that category Sanskrit or Indian languages are more relevant simply because there is something like Indian philosophy. In S&T the only area of possible application for Sanskrit is Mathematics. Even here engineering mathematics are very many application areas where Sanskrit cannot be used (such as various transforms, differential equations, matrices etc etc). This is because there are no Sanskrit texts (ancient or otherwise) available in those areas. So the question of teaching of Sanskrit in S&T departments for S&T subjects does not arise.  
  

Coming to the letter by Sushri Smriti Irani-ji. This letter must be directed towards HSS departments of IITs. This much is clear when she said, 'that IITs have been asked to teach Sanskrit to facilitate the study of science and technology as reflected in its literature'. Irani-ji cited the report of a panel that had suggested that IITs may facilitate study of science and technology as reflected in Sanskrit literature along with inter-disciplinary study of Sanskrit and modern subjects. As shri Paturi-ji suggested, the aim could be to provide the missing link between modern S&T expertsand Sanskrit language knowledge.  
  

Although I do not hesitate to declare myself as Indian nationalist, I find this whole exercise of getting vetted by modern S&T experts is a waste of time. If there is a nationalist agenda of teaching S&T as well as HSS in Sanskrit or any other Indian language then there is no need to invent modern S&T or HSS in old Sanskrit texts. Particularly, insofar as S&T is concerned, we have to create new texts which can teach S&T at the university level and even post-graduate level. This in itself is an ambitious project. It needs to be implemented transparently without necessarily establishing any link to the old Sanskrit texts or worst superimposing new texts as/on ancient texts or vice versa. (One example: Viman Shastra or Vaimanik Shastra attributed to sage Bharadvaj: Here is the [Wiki.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaim%C4%81nika_Sh%C4%81stra) Although Wiki is not always reliable, one can refer the sources and appraisal mentioned there including [I.I.Sc](http://I.I.Sc). study report).
