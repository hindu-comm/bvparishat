The letter by Smriti Iraniji was discussed in[this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/CxyeeTpHz3E/uRDWxqy7NQAJ;context-place=forum/bvparishat)on BVP.

In this she is mentioned to have clearly said, 'that IITs have been asked to teach Sanskrit to facilitate the study of science and technology as reflected in its literature'. The report further says, "She cited the report of a panel that had suggested that IITs may facilitate study of science and technology as reflected in Sanskrit literature along with inter-disciplinary study of Sanskrit and modern subjects.

Earlier, the allegations were that Sanskrit scholars devoid of modern S&T knowledge were making claims of S&T useful content in ancient Sanskrit texts. Their claims need to be ratified by modern S&T experts. Only modern S&T experts are qualified to make such claims. Now when that link which was found to be missing between modern S&T expertsand Sanskrit language knowledge is sought to be provided, the same people cry fowl and say this is Hindutva agenda.  

  

Earlier, the allegations were that Sanskrit was not being taught, Sanskrit language learning was denied to people. Now when Sanskrit language knowledge is provided on platter, people arestimulated and persuadedto learn Sanskrit, the same people cry fowl and say, you are forcing Sanskrit down the throats of people.
