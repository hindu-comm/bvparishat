Dear list members,  
  

I would like to bring to your kind attention that Murali Manohar Joshi, former Union minister for human resource development had directed all the IIT campuses to set up a Cell for Indian Science and Technology in Sanskrit, in 2002.  
  

As far as I know IIT-K, IIT-M and IIT-B started the cells, but the only one that survives today is the one at IIT-B.  
  

I would like the members to contemplate on why the other cells could not survive.  
  
During the same time a Advanced Study center at JNU and Department of Sanskrit Studies in Univ of Hyderabad were also started.  

  

Again, recently there were directions from the ministry to the IITs to set up the Sanskrit Cells. And some of the IITs (IIT-Ropar, IIT-Kh) have already started offering courses to their students. There may be many more. I wrote about the IITs about which I have some information.
