Dear Sri Gobind-ji,

  

You seemed to have missed the discussions on BVP on the topic of S & T in Sanskrit literature. For example, Prof. Michel Danino-ji shared the article by Prof. Roddam Narasimha in his 23/2/2016 post. The article is here:

  
<http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/108/04/0471.pdf>

  

His caution not to fall trap into the claims that can not be proved was well taken. In fact, most of the senior scholars on BVP, since they come from rigorous research background, have always been discerning enough in this regard. They found their thoughts resonating in Prof. Narasimha's article.

  

Sanskrit related work happening at various IITs is much older than the recent manufactured debates on the 'imposition' of Sanskrit or 'Jadu tona proposed to be taught as S & T' etc. That Sanskrit related work at IITs happened at informal to formal levels, as Sanskrit teaching classes conducted outside the class hours as an extra-curricular recreation on the campus to formal research projects related to font development or machine translation. During this time, IITs had, at a formal level, Philosophy, History and particularly English departments as part of their Humanities and /or Social Sciences wings.

  

If a formal Sanskrit course is introduced there as part of HSS, it would be just in tune with the timeline of Sanskrit on those campuses.

  

It is part of the strategy or ignorance of the debate-manufacturers to see it or make it look like some new sky-fall.
