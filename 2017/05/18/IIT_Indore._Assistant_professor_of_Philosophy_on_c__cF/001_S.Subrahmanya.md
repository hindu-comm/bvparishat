Why does the ad from IIT Indore ,for positions in the School of Humanities and "Social sciences" ,  
list English as a qualification degree,  
But not Samskritam or any other indian language ?

How come IIT Indore has a PhD program in English, but not in Samskritam ?  
<http://academic.iiti.ac.in/academicprogram.php>

Shouldn't Samskritam scholars be writing a letter to the IIT Indore administration ? If Samskritam scholars don't demand, then why complain ?

Is this a symptom of the deep colonised mindset problem in indian academia ?
