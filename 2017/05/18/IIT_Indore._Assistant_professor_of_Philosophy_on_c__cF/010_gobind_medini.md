Thank you Shri Paturi-ji,  
  

Yes, I had missed the discussion on the S&T; particularly the article by Shri Roddam Narasimhaj-ji in Current Science dated 25 Feb 2015.  
  

I am aware of Shri Michael Danino-ji and his excellent presentation on S&T in ancient India. I have circulated it myself to other groups with which I am associated.  
  

Warm Regards.
