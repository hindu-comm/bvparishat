Yes, that is the tragedy. Indian languages should have been mentioned in the qualification criteria along with English.  
  

At the same time ask this question for any particular Indian language (including Sanskrit). How many new books have been written in that language for past say 100 years in the field of Humanities and Social sciences **which discuss or theorize any new idea or give any new information or offer a fresh perspective?**  
  

Our maxim: "Tradition is Supreme". Every thing that needs to be told is already available in our Shastras. They are eternal and unchanging. We only have to decipher their meaning by textual analysis and exegesis. Unless we change this mind set, mere symbolism is not gong to help. The symbolism may ensure political correctness.. that is also important in its own way.. but nothing more than that.
