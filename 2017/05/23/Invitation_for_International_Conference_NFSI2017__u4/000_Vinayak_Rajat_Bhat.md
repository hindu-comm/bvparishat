Dear Scholars,



Praṇāms.

  

We request you all to circulate thisinvitationamong the scholars, researchers and people interested. Please also find the brochure attached.

  

------------------------------------------------------



Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth invites you to a 3-day International Conference on "*New Frontiers in Sanskrit and Indic Knowledge: Emerging Issues for Teaching, Research, and Applications"*from June 12-14, 2017 at its Chinmaya Eswar Gurukula, Kochi Campus.



This conference, designed to help formulate a new agenda for researchers in the field of Sanskrit and

Ancient IndianStudies by addressing issues related to a few key themes, will provide a platform for the academic community, researchers, and thought leaders to share new knowledge and best practices. We are confident that the Sanskrit and Indic Studies community will stand to benefit from these mutual interactions, which appear to be lacking at the moment, given the globally emerging political trend that devalues the humanities in general, and in particular our field. The conference will provide ample networking opportunities for those engaged in teaching and research in Sanskrit, Indic Knowledge and its Applications.  
  
We would greatly appreciate it if you circulate thisinvitationwidely among your faculty, student, and researcher contacts. Attached you will find a brochure which you can post on your notice boards.  
  
If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email us at*[nfsi...@cvv.ac.in]()*or call us at [+917558897888](tel:+91%2075588%2097888).
