Friends,

  

Congrats for this enlightening account.

  

I happened to be one of the last persons who visited the Nirnaya Sagar Press in 1967 and could get only one copy of the Ashtadhyayi-sootrapatha and some other damaged and soiled books for a paltry sum,as the staff there was busy in winding up and selling whatever books they had.

  

One thing must be said -and appreciated too-to the credit of the Publications of the NSP that there is hardly any printing mistake in any of their publications. It speaks volumes of the sincerity,dedication and scholarship of the staff there-both educated and non-educated,but expert in carrying out their duties to the best of their abilities.

  

Hats off to NSP.

  

Siddharth Y Wakankar
