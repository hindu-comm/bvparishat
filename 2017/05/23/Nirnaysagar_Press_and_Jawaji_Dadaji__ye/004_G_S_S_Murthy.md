Many thanks to Aravindji for this enlightening note on Nirnayasagar Press. During early eighties I visited their office. Except for the Panchang nothing much was being published. I could buy only a few of the less important works published by them.

I have 2 suggestions in this matter.

1\. A book in Sanskrit could be brought out bringing out the contribution of Nairnayasagar press to the preservation and spread of Sanskrit classics.

2\. A critical research based study culminating in the publication of a tome ( English/Sanskrit) that records everything known about the founder, the family, the scholars helping them and their contribution to Sanskrit.

Both of these could be undertaken by one of the plethora of Sanskrit Universities.

Regards,

Murthy
