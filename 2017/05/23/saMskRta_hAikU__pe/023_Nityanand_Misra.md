Dear Prof. Kannan

Which हेतु would this be? The हेतु referred to in the rule हेतौ (२.३.२२) is not the शास्त्रीय हेतु (causal agent) but the लौकिक हेतु. If we take वायु as the शास्त्रीय हेतु, then the usage would be वायुः पत्राणि कम्पयति/ वायुना पत्राणि कम्प्यन्ते.

  

The लौकिक हेतु is of three types:

1) द्रव्यहेतु, as in दण्डेन घटः or धनेन कुलम्. This is not the case here as the द्रव्य here is पत्राणि and वायुना पत्राणि does not make sense.

2) गुणहेतु, as in पुण्येन गौरवर्णः or कन्यया शोकः. As there is no गुण in the sentence, this is also not the case.

3) क्रियाहेतु, as in पुण्येन दृष्टो हरिः. This seems possible, but I wonder if we have a parallel example here. My understanding is that हेतु exists before क्रिया. Dharanand Ghildiyal says this in his commentary on the SK (“जो क्रिया के पूर्व रहता है वह हेतु और जो क्रिया के बाद होता है वह फल होता है”, VSK, MLBD, ISBN 9788120821484, p. 85). In पुण्येन दृष्टो हरिः that is the case, पुण्य existed before the दर्शनक्रिया. I am not sure if that is the case in our example.

  

लौकिक हेतु can also be a फल, as in अध्ययनेन वसति. But that is obviously not the case here.

  

Perhaps the experts on Vakyapadiya (Prof. Aklujkar and Prof. Korada) can clarify ifexistence before क्रिया is a necessary condition for aहेतु.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
