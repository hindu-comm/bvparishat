Here is Rama Nath Sharma on *2.3.23 hetau*(Volume III of *The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini*, ISBN 81-215-0653-0, p. 130):

  

A *karaṇa* is to be designated by an action, and is to be brought to participate by an agent. ... Bhartṛhari also recognizes another distinction between *karaṇa* and *hetu*. He regards *karaṇa* as dependent upon *vyāpāra*, intermediate action. Thus if *paraśu* ‘axe’ is to serve as *karaṇa* for splitting wood (denoted by *bhid* ‘to split’) there must be some intermediate actions; such as raising the axe (*udyamana*), and bringing it down (*nipātana*). Such intermediate actions are not required for *hetu*.
