Since Sri Satish Kumar Dogra-ji is writing this poem from Tamil Nadu, the background of this haiku can be traced to Tamil haikus.

  

The article "Birth of Haiku in Tamil and its Growth" by Ramesh Anand[here](http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=15390), gives the background of Tamil haiku. Though this article traces the history of Tamil haiku back to 1916 and says it got revived in 1966 He gives many instances of haiku being written in Tamil from time to time in 1968, 1974, 1984 and later. But it is in 1990-94 that the present level rise of haiku seems to have occurred. He says,"In 1990, Dr. Leelavadhi published an essay book for haiku, Idhudhaan Haiku." But if you see the title of the book "haiku oru pudhiya arimugam published in 1991" , that seems to be the time when haiku seems to have become the trend of the day.

  

The author says,

  

"Tamil poets were given a base to haiku through Sujatha’s haiku book, haiku oru pudhiya arimugam published in 1991, Nellai Muthu’s research haiku book, tamizhil haiku published in 1994 and poet Nirmala Suresh’s research book, haiku kavidhaigal published in 1997. As a continuation, lots of research articles, researchers, seminars and debates had begun in haiku and operating successfully."

  

My own observation is that haiku, in contemporary poetry of Indian languages, rose as a variety of a small pieces of free verse, after free verse was successful in replacing the maatraachchhandas poems and lyrical poetry that entered during the advent of modern poetry. This turning point occurredin Telugu around 1987 when one of my friends Sri Gali Nasar Reddy who was at that time working for a weekly magazine Andhra Bhoomi , published, first a few Telugu translations of English translations of Japanese haikus and then his own original Telugu haikus. This very quickly inspired a big number of young poets publishing many haikus and Tripuraneni Srinivas coming up with a publication of anthology of selected haikus. By 1990-91 around the same time as in Tamil, this picked up an intense momentum and by 2000-2010 it spread all around. There were many new experiments in such little free verse poems. Now, in Telugu, naa-nee, a nativized version of this Japanese origin genre is the trend of the day.

  

The article cited above says,

  

"In Tamil, other than haiku, its branches like senryu, haibun, haiga and also new forms like Limericku (Limerick + haiku), Limersenryu (Haibun + Senryu), Limerbun (Haibun + Limericku) are being tried out by poets in various journals."

  

Limericks were written in Telugu by the legendary poet SriSri in 1960s.

  

Today similar to Tamil many experiments in writing little free verse poems is continuing.

  

I do not know haikus or any such little free verse poems were attempted in Sanskrit earlier or not.

  

Sorry for the long post. Topic of my teaching field and close to my heart made me pour out.

  

Thanks for your patience.
