In tripada Gayatri there are 3 lines each of 8 words in vedic mantras while in shisht sanskrit Gayatri contains 2 lines with 12 words each or same 3linez like vedic, so Japanese haiku is quite different,. And sir why we should compare mantras with rest literature, we know sanskrit is only having phonetic science and this character is absent with all languages right now which are available on the globe, please correct me if I am wrong.

Regards.
