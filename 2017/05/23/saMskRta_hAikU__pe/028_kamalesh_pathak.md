Nagraj sir! To best of my knowledge originally haiku is a Japanese style of poetry where are three lines only and only middle line having 7 alphabet while the first and third lines have five alphabet, a total of 17 alphabet and a meaningful poem, it's also known as the smallest poem style in world literature, kindly correct my if misleading

Regards
