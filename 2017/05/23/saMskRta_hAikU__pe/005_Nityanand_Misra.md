Dear Sh. Dogra

  

Yes, since the root कपि चलने is अकर्मक (intransitive),पत्राणि कम्पन्ते means "the leaves tremble/move".

  

Here since the intended sense is "the leaves are moved by the wind", we need a transitive root. This can be done by either having passive usage (कर्मणि प्रयोग) likeपत्राणि वायुना कम्प्यन्ते or a causative usage (णिजन्त प्रयोग) वायुः पत्राणि कम्पयति. Note that णिजन्त form of कपि चलने is always in परस्मैपद due to the rule १.३.८७ निगरणचलनार्थेभ्यश्च

  

PS: The roots कपि चलने and चल कम्पने refer to each other in the Dhatupatha. The meaning ofकम्पन is चलन and that of चलन is कम्पन. :)
