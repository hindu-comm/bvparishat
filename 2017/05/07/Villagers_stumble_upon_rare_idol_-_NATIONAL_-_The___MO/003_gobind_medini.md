The article claims the statue to be of Mahavira and it is found in a village in Odiasha. From the various features of the statue, particularly its similarity of form with the famous Sharavanabelagola statue of Jain deity Gomateshwara (Bahubali) in Karnataka, its connection with Jainism is obvious.  
  
Jainism had a good spread in Karnataka and Odisha in ancient as well as medieval period. Particularly in the latter region known by its ancient name Kalinga, the patronage to Jainism goes back at least to the great king Kharavela (1st century BC). The statue is said to be of 9th or 10th century CE. Probably authentic carbon dating has not yet been done. Since Gomateshwara statue is said to be built in the 9th-10th century CE, the same period might have been assigned to the statue.  
  

Jainism is one major Shramana thread which survived from its pre-Buddhist past. Shramanism was prevalent in India - particularly in its Eastern and Southern regions - before the Vedic spread was established in those parts. Its 23rd Tirthankar Parshavanath (8th century BC) is considered to be a historical figure. There is a close fraternal relation between Vedic religion and Jainism though Jainsim is usually considered as heretic from the Vedic point of view;[Here](http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/article/antiquity.htm) is one interesting link for those who are interested in history of Indian religious traditions.
