Namaskaar & kindly accept my apology if anybody does get hurt by the comment.

Propagating a language does need a tenacious and splendid effort with the display of flawless expertise in a particular field. Be it art, culture or science for that matter, if you want to review the planning of making a smart city or clean city in present scenario on the basis of how ancient cities were planned to built in order to promote the Sanskrit language and establish its relevance, you must do that on the basis of canons of Nagara-Vaastu or city architecture described in*Smaraangana-Sootradhaara* or *Aparaajita prichchaa.* Otherwise, only describing the etymology and usages of some words will not only make the mockery of whole exercisebut also predicate that when it comes to the field of art (that's too cinema) or science either the scholar does not have the expertise of that field or the language (or the texts written in that language) has its own certain limitation. And such conclusions are not going to help to promote this great language and the erudite*Shastras* (texts) written in this language.

Take this example, Either the makers of this video do not work on the title which is quite obfuscating or they wrongly presumed that such title will be quite beaconing. In any case the whole so called review is not more than the mere exercise for making an audio of introductory class for informing some Sanskrit words.

With all due respect, I want to say that reviewing a cinema needs certain expertise or knowledge about the subtleties of Cinematography, Screen-play, Background score, Dialogues, Acting skills, Direction, Graphics, Choreography, Costume etc.

Its not necessary that such detailing could be available in *NaatyaShaastra* or such texts since most of the above mentioned attributes of cinema are being introduced in Indian cinema only few years back. But, the attributes of a Nayaka or other elements of Drama that described in ancient texts can also become good ground for a standard review in Natyshaasstra's perspective.

Lastly, thoughts and efforts to promote Sanskrit are always welcomed but we have to live up the standards as *Baahubali* did so that world would change its perception and acknowledge you.
