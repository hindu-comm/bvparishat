Thanks for all Respected professors for their valuable suggestions.  

  

As I am in USA right now, searching for rools of chitra/bandha/goodha chitra kavyas on internet.

  

The book priscribed by Sri Paturi Nagaraju garu served my purpose.

  

Thanks again Sri Paturi Nagaraju garu and other scholors.

  

With Regards

RPSharma
