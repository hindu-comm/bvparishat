Dear Sir/Madam



This is to state with pleasure that Veda Samskruti Samiti (VSS) is a Public Charitable Trust of Hyderabad, striving for the past few years for promotion and propagation of cultural values of India as embedded in Vedas and Samskritam.



Believing in the principle of Integrated approach, VSS and other allied organizations like ESWARA and Shri Veda Bharathi, working in various angles but ultimately with a common goal of vibrant Bharat,
have formed a cohesive Group and conducted a National Seminar at Hyderabad, with the theme of “Preservation and Promotion of Sanskrit & Samskruti” in 2016. We are happy to inform that the programme went off very well and was appreciated by all.



Continuing with the same spirit, it is now proposed to conduct a National Seminar this year also, with the theme of “ Samskritam & Bhaarateeya Kalaa Vaibhavam (Sangeetam, Naatakam and Naatyam-SASANANA-i3)”, to reflect the glory of some selected Indian Arts.under able guidance and leadership of Dr. Remella Avadhanulu Garu, of Shri Veda Bharati.

The seminar is scheduled for 11th and 12^(th) of November, 2017.



The cultural organizations of Hyderabad, which actively participated in our earlier Seminar, have already communicated their consent to take a lead role this year also. They are all going to be included in our Advisory Board of this seminar.



As the objective behind this programme is of high cultural value and assures a promising role for the youth in the deliberations of the Seminar, and also as it was opined that the base of the proposed activity should be as wide as possible, it was decided to invite all
other cultural organizations of Hyderabad also, which could not be contacted earlier. It is hoped that the expanded base will surely contribute for the grand success of the proposed Seminar.



In this context we are happy to hear a lot about your organization and your contributions in the field of Bharatiya culture.



Hence, we are humbly approaching and requesting you to kindly agree to participate in the proposed seminar in general , and in any of its wings of your choice in particular.



***A word of consent from your kind self will enable us to include your name also in the Advisory Board being expanded.***



Requesting you once again to join this group for highlighting the Glory and Splendor of our rich culture with a display of solidarity.



Thanking you,

Yours sincerely,

A H Prabhakara Rao
