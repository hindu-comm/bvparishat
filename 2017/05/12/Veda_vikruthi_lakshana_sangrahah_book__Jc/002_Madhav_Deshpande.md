The Vedavikr̥tilakṣaṇa-Saṃgraha (A Collection of twelve tracts on Vedavikr̥tis and allied topics) was jointly edited by K. V. Abhyankar and G. V. Devasthali. It was published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune in 1978 as "Research Unit Publications, No. 5). It should be available from BORI (Pune 411004). I have a physical copy of the book, but not a pdf.
