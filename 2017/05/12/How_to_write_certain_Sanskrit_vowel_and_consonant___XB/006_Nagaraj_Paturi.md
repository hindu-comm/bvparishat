लृ being pronounced with 'r' mixed in it seems to be a script-guided error. The maatra of ऋ at the bottom of क in कृ and the maatra at the bottom inलृ appear to be the same. In other wordsलृ gives the illusion of being ल with a maatra of ऋ at the bottom. But the pronunciation described/prescribed by S'ikshaa grantha-s forलृ does not have any trace ofऋ or र in it. The illusion created by the script symbolलृ seems to be the source of the impression ofऋ or र in it.

Maatra forऋ in Telugu can be seen in కృ where క is the body for क. The symbol forलृ herebeingdissimilar to maatra forऋ in that language, seems to be the reason forTelugu speakers not having this impression ofऋ or रinलृ.
