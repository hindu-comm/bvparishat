Dear Joshiji,

  

  To complete my note on लृ, let me clarify again that there is no "r" in the vowel लृ. By Pāṇini's rule (कृपो रो ल:) "The r of the root kr̥p is replaced with l," kr̥p becomes kl̥p, and karpate becomes kalpate.
This rule itself makes clear that there is no 'r' in kl̥p. The conventional writing of लृ makes one think that this is ल्+ऋ. But that is not true as far as the phonetics of लृ is concerned. The phonetic texts clearly say: ऋटुरषाणां मूर्धा, लृतुलसानां दन्ता:. So there is no phonetic possibility of लृ containing an 'r' sound. Hope this clarifies the situation.
