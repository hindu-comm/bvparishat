Respected Scholars and Prof M Deshpande, Namaskar!

  

Dear Prof M Deshpande

“The actual use of l̥ (लृ) is found only in the forms of the root kl̥p (क्लृप्)”.

Let us make it clear. The root (क्लृप्) is klŗp. It is not kļp.

Am I right?

I use ļ for vowel I and ḻ for L\< . Is this ok?

Words listed below contain vowel ļ (I).

Is that correct?



1 ***Gamļ***

It means the earth. ..

2 ***Malļ***

It means to hold or to possess. .

3 ***Şadļ***

It means splitting, or rending (to tear asunder). .

4 ***Patļ***

It means to go. This root does not offer any idea about the meaning of the vowel /ļ/.

5 **Veļ**

It means to go. However Velā means Samudra (sea) as well as Kāla (time).

Please give us more words using the vowel ļ (I). For your use PDF file of this posting is attached.Thanks. NRJOSHI
