Dear Joshiji,

  

  In the actual usage of Sanskrit language, the vowel लृ occurs only the forms of the root क्लृप्. Patañjali himself makes this clear in his Mahābhāṣya. The other forms like गम्लृ that you have cited are not from the usage of Sanskrit as such, but technical expressions within Pāṇini's grammar. There is a distinction between Sanskrit usage as "object language" (the language of usage to be studied by grammar) and Sanskrit used by Paṇini to describe this object language. Pāṇini's technical usage can be called the meta-language.
