Dear Madhav,  

You are giving Panini's view point.But tho homogenous and l are not identical. They interchange , as in Chinese and Japanese. That does not negate their independence. The voiced and the unvoiced plosives interchange in the North and the South. But the original sound is not lost.  

Best
