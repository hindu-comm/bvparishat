Have there been linguistic/historical analyses of

why **l** (the first one) is pronounced as **r** in "Co**l**onel"?

  

The interchangeability of r and l is found in such common instances as

r(l)ohita

r(l)oma

par(l)yanka.

  

I think we get instances of this even in the Vedic literature.

  

The typical insensitivity (of some - as with Koreans/Japanese) to the difference between r and l sounds

has given rise to pieces of humour such as

the case of the secretary who got selected on the basis of her **glamour**,

whereas the actual instruction(orally, that is) was to select one on the basis of **grammar**!
