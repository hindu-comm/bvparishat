Hari Om Blessed Self,  
  
  
We are pleased to announce the release of DVD titled 'Devī Māhātmyam - Prathama Caritam (Part-1)'.  
  
  
Devī Māhātmyam, a part of Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa expounds the hitherto hidden aspects of the Ādi Parāśakti. The study of this mystic text helps to embrace all aspects of spiritual life from chanting to meditation and contemplation of the Supreme mother. The rich symbolism of Indian tradition is unveiled through these talks.  
  
Swami Sharadananda Sarasvati explains Divine Mother’s glories and inspires us with his devotional fervour. His deep insight into both Vedic and Tāntrik scriptures is unfolded as we delve into this truly sublime text, Devī Māhātmyam.  
  
Swami Sharadananda Sarasvati, Acharya at CIF, is a polyglot with expertise in Sanskrit, Indian Philosophy (Yoga, Advaita Vedanta and Tantra) with in-depth understanding of Ritual and Cultural Traditions. Swamiji combines the best of Gurukula learning as well as academic excellence with post graduate degree in Advaita Vedānta.   
  
These talks were recorded during the 1st Devī Māhātmyam Camp held at Chinmaya International Foundation (CIF) in April 2017.
