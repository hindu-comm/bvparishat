The particulars of the first edition of this little gem are:Narahari, N.G. (ed.): Dharmacauryarasåyana of Gopålayogîndra. A Poetic Dissertation on the Ethics of Stealing, «Adyar Library Bulletin», 1946, pp. I-X, 1-28.

  

The following may also be helpful to you:

Aklujkar, Ashok. 1996. "Dharma-caurya-rasāyana as a text and as a work of Brahmin fantasy." Amṛta-mandākinī, Dr. G.B. Palsule Felicitation Volume, pp. 239-260. Pune: Dr. Ga. Bā. Paḷasule Satkāra-samiti.

  

Since it may now be difficult to reach any representative of the Satkāra-samiti, I am attaching a pdf to this post.
