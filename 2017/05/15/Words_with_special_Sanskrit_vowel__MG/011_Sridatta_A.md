Yes, Unicode doesn't encode stylistic variants. Some fonts like Noto Sans Devanagari, Mukta an so on provide both normal and Marathi-style (as in Nirnayasagar books) ल श at the same codepoint as language alternates or stylistic sets. There are ways to on/off these advanced opentype features in commonly used applications like Adobe InDesign, xelatex, Word etc but I'm not aware much in these regard.
