Dear Nityanandji,

  

  I see that there is a distinctly coded character forऌ, and one does not have to resort to ल+ऋ>लृ. I was looking for the other Nirnayasagara style version ल, but the unicode does not seem to offer the two styles ofल as two separate codes. I know that fonts like Sanskrit 2003 do offer the Nirnayasagara style typography, but the unicode itself does not offer a choice. Am I correct in this assumption?
