Dear Sh. Joshi

  

I noted that you use the Devanagari character sequence लृ for the vocalic vowel ḷ. This sequence is composed of two characters: the character ल (U+0932) and the matra sign ृ (U+0943). To avoid confusion, it is better to use the character ऌ (U+090C) instead, which is the Unicode encoding of the vocalic vowel. While the two forms look similar, there is a small difference in the way they are rendered by the commonly used Unicode fonts.

  

To summarize

लृ = lṛ = U+0932 followed by U+0943

ऌ = ḷ = U+090C

  

To enter the character ऌ in Microsoft word, you may type 090C and then hit Alt+X.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
