Dear Prof M Deshpande,

Thanks for clearing my confusion. My confusion was due to the difference in writing the grapheme l̥ as (I) or as (लृ). I agree with you that the actual use of l̥ (लृ) is found only in the forms of the root kl̥p (क्लृप्).

Now the vowel l̥ in ***Gamļ ***is an indicatory letter (Anubhanda). Is this true for Malļ, Şadļ, Patļ, and* *Veļ ?

Prof Deshpande or any scholar from BVP knows other words using the vowel ļ (I) ,please let me know. Thanks. PDF file is attached to this email. lNRJOSHI
