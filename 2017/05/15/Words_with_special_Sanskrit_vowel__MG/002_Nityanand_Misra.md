Dear Prof. Deshpande

  

I remember two examples from grammar works where ऌ is involved in sandhi. For the sandhi-s to take place, ऌ must be included in the इक् and अच् pratyahara-s respectively.

  

ऌ + आकृति = लाकृति (इको यणचि)  

तव + ऌकार = तवल्कार (आद्गुणः, उरण् रपरः)

  

I do not know how frequently the examples लाकृति and तवल्कार occur outside grammar works.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
