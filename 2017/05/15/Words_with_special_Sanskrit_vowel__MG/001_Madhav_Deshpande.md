Dear Joshiji,

  

  All these forms that you have cited are from the Pāṇinian Dhātupāṭha, where लृ is attached as an Anubandha "marker". Pāṇinian commentators use the terms kr̥trima and akr̥trima in the sense of "artificial/technical" and "natural, not made-up by the grammarians" to describe Pāṇini's technical vocabulary (cf. Paribhāṣā: कृत्रिमाकृत्रिमयो: कृत्रिमे कार्यसम्प्रत्यय:). The entries of roots in the Dhātupāṭha with attached markers would fall in the category of kr̥trima vocabulary. Even the originally akr̥trima words like Guṇa and Vr̥ddhi are used in the Aṣṭādhyāyī with kr̥trima definitions. So, yes, the vowel लृ does appear in multiple places within the technical vocabulary of Pāṇini. In the natural usage of the Sanskrit language, however, it occurs only in the forms of the root क्लृप्, and Pāṇini handles this root by positing the root कृप् and then prescribing the replacement of "r" by "l" in his rule (कृपो रो ल:). The Prātiśākhyas seem to follow the same strategy as evidenced by the rule (कृपे रेफस्य लकार:) found in the Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā, a Prātiśākhya of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda. Pāṇini's inclusion of लृ in the Śivasūtra ऋलृक् was probably motivated by his desire to facilitate the treatment of Sandhis within his metalinguistic usage. For example, in his rule (पुषादिद्युताद्य्लृदित: परस्मैपदेषु), the vowel "i" at the end of dyutādi changes to "y" before "l̥" of "l̥ditaḥ". For such Sandhis to take place, the vowel "l̥" needs to be included in the scope of rules like इको यणचि. However, such sandhis involving "l̥" do not occur outside of Pāṇinian metalanguage.
