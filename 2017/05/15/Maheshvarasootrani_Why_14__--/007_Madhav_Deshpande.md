Dear Shri Karve,

  

  Since my own books are now almost all boxed up, I don't have access to them. I would suggest that you visit the library of the Bhandarkar Institute to find editions of Kātantra, R̥ktantra, Cāndra-Vyākaraṇa, Jainendra-Vyākaraṇa, Śākaṭāyana-Vyākaraṇa, Sārasvata-Vyākaraṇa and Haima-Śabdānuśāsana. There are a few more, but this should give you a good sample of reformulations of Pāṇini's Śivasūtras. Best,
