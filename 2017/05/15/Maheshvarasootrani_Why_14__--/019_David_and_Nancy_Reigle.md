Your article, "Who Inspired Pāṇini: Reconstructing the Hindu and Buddhist Counter-Claims," clearly shows that the more information we have, the more complex the picture becomes. The Mañjuśrī-vyākaraṇa adds to this complexity. The Vimalaprabhā commentary does not say where it quoted these nine pratyāhāra-sūtras from. This information was given by the early Tibetan Kālacakra master Bu-ston (1290-1364) in an annotation to his edition of the Tibetan translation of the Vimalaprabhā here, saying: 'jam dpal gyi byā ka ra ṇa nas. This translates as “from the Mañjuśrī-vyākaraṇa.” The only vyākaraṇa by Mañjuśrī that is known is the Mañjuśrī-śabda-lakṣaṇa, so I assumed that this is what Bu-ston was referring to. However, when I checked it and its commentary (both in Tibetan translation) for these nine pratyāhāra-sūtras, I saw that it does not begin with these nine, but rather with the following thirteen:

  

1. a-i-u-Ṇ; 2. ṛ-ḷ-K; 3. e-o-Ṅ; 4. ai-au-C; 5. ha-ya-va-ra-la-Ṇ; 6. ña-ma-ṅa-ṇa-na-M; 7. jha-bha-Ñ; 8. gha-ḍha-dha-Ṣ; 9. ja-ba-ga-ḍa-da-Ś; 10. kha-pha-cha-ṭha-tha-ca-ṭa-ta-V; 11. ka-pa-Y; 12. śa-ṣa-sa-R; 13. ha-L.

  

These, of course, are identical with the thirteen pratyāhāra-sūtras that begin the Cāndra-vyākaraṇa by Candragomin. As you wrote, Candragomin merged the fifth and sixth Śiva-sūtras, ha-ya-va-ra-Ṭ and la-Ṇ, into one: ha-ya-va-ra-la-Ṇ. He thus gives thirteen rather than fourteen, keeping the remaining twelve the same. So the Mañjuśrī-śabda-lakṣaṇa follows the Cāndra-vyākaraṇa in its pratyāhāra-sūtras. The nine pratyāhāra-sūtras quoted in the Vimalaprabhā, then, come from a different Mañjuśrī-vyākaraṇa, assuming that Bu-ston’s identification of this as the source is correct.
