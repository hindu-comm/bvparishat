In his History of Sanskrit Grammar in Tibet, Pieter Verhaagen says the following about this Mañjuśrī-Vyākaraṇa, which turns out to be a relatively late grammar (14th century A.D. or a little earlier) based on earlier Cāndra and Kātantra systems.

The Cāndra-Vyākaraṇa keeps अइउण् ऋऌक् of Pāṇini, but reduces हयवरट् लण् of Pāṇini to a single sūtra हयवरलण्. The Mañjuśrī-Vyākaraṇa seems to have done a different version:हयरवलट्, reversing the order of व and र.
These alternative orders are already discussed by Kātyāyana in his Vārttikas. A wide range of different grammars of Sanskrit were experimenting with alternative reformulations of the Pratyāhārasūtras.
