    Dear Scholars and list members,
    I just listened to a very interesting talk by Prof. Ramasubramanian at IIT Rourkee, 
    wherein he mentions something about a German Electrical Engineer figuring out 
    why exactly the number 14 is the most optimal way of doing it, using some Gauge 
    Theory (?). See 01:06:25 onwards - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVEc_wQ4YTM

    Might someone on this list know the reference to that research paper (or any
    related research)?  Would be grateful for any insight on this - whether it comes
    from pure Grammarians and Linguists, or Mathematicians/Physicists interested
    in Paninian Grammar.

    Thanks and best regards,

Mallikarjun Karra
