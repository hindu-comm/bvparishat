If such is the case then possibly from the modern point of view Paninian Grammar itself is the simplification of those grammars existing prior to it. This is quite evident from the fact that Paninian Grammar is said to deal more with spoken Sanskrit than with Vedic sanskrit. Thus it would be safe to say that a more robust grammar did exist prior to Panini which was overshadowed by later socio, politico and economic conditions. In the process of simplification Panini excluded the letter
ळ from the Maheshwar Sutras. As per Deshpande's opinion Patanjali did not feel that the letter  लृ was necessary to be included in the Maheshwar Sutras. The two variations of a consonant which might originally have been considered to be two separate letters were clubbed into one under the sutra झलो झलि . And such more aspects must have fallen victim to the process of simplification that Panini must have adopted. As a lay man am I right in my judgement.

Achyut Karve.



Dear list members,

Shri Achyut Karve's question on post-Paninian formulations, inspires the following question on pre-Paninian formulations:

Traditionally, we have all heard about "nava-vyakaranas" that Hanuman had learned from the Sun. Ravana and more recently, Sri Vedanta Desikar are also said to have been nava-vyakarana vettas. What are these nava-vyakaranas? Surely, Panineeyam cannot be one of the nava-vyakaranas, as one would expect the account from Ramayana to predate Panini (see this list -<https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-amazing-and-lesser-known-facts-about-Ravana/answer/Srinivasan-PS-2>).
Does any scripture mention the names of all these nine Vyakaranas?

Thanks,  
MK
