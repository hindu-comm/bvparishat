I would like to draw attention of scholars to the fact that while the Śivasūtras as constituted in the Pāṇinian grammar have the number 14, and a particular arrangement of sounds and markers (anubandhas), already beginning with Kātyāyana and Patañjali, there was questioning of the details of these Sūtras. The few topics covered by the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali include questioning the necessity of listing लृ, the order of v and r in the Śivasūtra हयवरट्, the repeated use of the marker ण् in अइउण् and लण्. Taking cues from these discussions, several post-Pāṇinian reformulations of the Śivasūtras can be found in grammars like those of Candragomin, Jainendra, Kātantra, Hemacandra etc. In these reformulations, the number 14 may not survive, and new recombinations can be seen. It would be a worthy project to do a comparative and contrastive study of the reformulations of the Śivasūtras of Pāṇini. I have also pointed out in a previous publication that the attribution of these 14 Sūtras to Śiva/Maheśvara is a relatively late development, the first sign of which appears after Bhartr̥hari and the Kāśikāvr̥tti. I am attaching a pdf of this publication for those who may be interested in this topic. With best wishes,
