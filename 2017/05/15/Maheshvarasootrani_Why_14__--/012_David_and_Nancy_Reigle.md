Thank you, Prof. Deshpande, for your very interesting article, "Who Inspired Pāṇini: Reconstructing the Hindu and Buddhist Counter-Claims." A while back I happened across an item that your research reminded me of. The Vimalaprabhā commentary on the Buddhist Kālacakra-tantra gives what is apparently a jñāpaka rule for pratyāhāras from the Mañjuśrī-vyākaraṇa, i.e., the Mañjuśrī-śabda-lakṣaṇa. This text does not seem to have survived in the original Sanskrit, but is preserved in Tibetan translation in the Tengyur. From it, nine pratyāhāra sūtras are given covering the whole Sanskrit alphabet, rather than the fourteen Śiva-sūtras. These are given in the Vimalaprabhā commentary on verse 8 of chapter 1 (volume 1, page 60, lines 27-31). Yet, one of the Śiva-sūtras is referred to only a few pages earlier when the Vimalaprabhā quotes Pāṇini's sūtra 6.1.77 (commentary on chapter 1, verse 5; volume 1, page 56, line 3). I have only very limited familiarity with Sanskrit grammatical writings. I wonder if this group of nine pratyāhāra sūtras is found other Sanskrit grammatical texts from other traditions of Sanskrit grammar. I have posted a scan of the Vimalaprabhā, volume 1, here: <http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Buddhist%20Texts/vimalaprabha_tika_vol_1_1986.pdf>.
