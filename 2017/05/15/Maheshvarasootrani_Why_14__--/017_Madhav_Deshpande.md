Dear Shri Kurumathur,

  

  Take a look at Pāṇini's ruleझलां जश् झशि8-4-53. Here, the pratyāhāra झश् is used to refer to sonant or voiced stops covered by the Śivasūtras: झभञ्, घढधष्, जबगडदश्. It does not include the nasal consonants covered by the Śivasūtra ञमङणनम्. Pāṇini splits the voiced sparśa consonants into two groups ञम् and झश्. Theoretically, one can create a pratyāhāra ञश् to cover all sonant/voiced sprarśa consonants, but evidently Pāṇini did not need such a grouping for any particular rule.
