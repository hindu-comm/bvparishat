Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

Very glad to have your comments on this, pointing out interesting differences from the Śiva-sūtras. As you say, this comparison is very revealing for our understanding of a wide spectrum of theoretical formulations in ancient India. I can add a couple more things to this comparison; so for convenience of reference I will here quote the nine pratyāhāra-sūtras from the Mañjuśrī-vyākaraṇa:

  

1. a-i-ṛ-u-ḷ-K

2. a-e-ar-o-al-C

3. ha-ya-ra-va-la-Ṅ

4. ṅa-ña-ṇa-ma-na-N

5. gha-jha-ḍha-bha-dha-DH

6. ga-ja-ḍa-ba-da-D

7. kha-cha-ṭha-pha-tha-TH

8. ka-ca-ṭa-pa-ta-T

9. ḥka-śa-ṣa-ḥpa-sa-S

  

Regarding the reversing of the order of “va” and “ra”, giving ha-ya-ra-va instead of ha-ya-va-ra, and also placing “la” at the end of this pratyāhāra sūtra, making ha-ya-ra-va-la: This is done in accordance with the pattern shown in all nine of these pratyāhāra-sūtras. Phonetically, all nine give the sequence: guttural, palatal, cerebral (or retroflex), labial, and dental. Then, the reason for reversing the labial and dental from their normal phonetic sequence of where they are produced in the vocal apparatus: This is because of their correspondence to the five elements, the mahābhūtas: gutturals correspond to ākāśa, palatals correspond to air, cerebrals correspond to fire, labials correspond to water, and dentals correspond to earth. This is of central importance in the Kālacakra system. The Kālacakra maṇḍala, a cosmogram, is a very detailed representation of the cosmos based on the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet (because produced from them). So here the correspondence of the Sanskrit letters to the mahābhūtas overrides the phonetic sequence of where they are produced in the vocal apparatus.  

  

Much more compact than the Kālacakra maṇḍala is the fundamental Kālacakra symbol called the daśākāro vaśī, that which possesses power and has ten forms. It is written as a stacked conjunct Sanskrit syllable, showing conjunct forms of ha-kṣa-ma-la-va-ra-ya, from top to bottom. It, too, symbolizes the cosmos. From the bottom, each of the four syllables represents one of the elements, the mahābhūtas, in order: ya corresponding to air, ra corresponding to fire, va corresponding to water, and la corresponding to earth. The cosmos arises within the fifth (or first) mahābhūta, ākāśa, which corresponds to ha (however, the ha at the top of this symbol has other correspondences). Thus, the ha-ya-ra-va-la corresponds to the five mahābhūtas in their proper sequence: ākāśa, air, fire, water, and earth. The Śiva-sūtra ha-ya-va-ra would give fire and water in reverse order: ākāśa, air, water, and fire. Further, the la would have to be added to complete the five.
