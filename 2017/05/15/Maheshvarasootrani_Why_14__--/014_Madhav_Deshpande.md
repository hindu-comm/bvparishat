Dear David,

  

Thanks for this pdf of Vimalaprabhā. I took a quick look at the relevant discussion on p. 60. It is fascinating to see an alternative organization of the Pratyāhārasūtras, different from those found in the Pāṇinian Śivasūtras. Some interesting points that I came away with is that in stead of Pāṇini's अइउण् ऋऌक्, here we have a single sequence अइऋउऌक्, and in stead of Pāṇini's हयवरट् लण्, here we have a single sequence हयरवलट्. While I have no clear understanding yet of why this Tantric text is presenting such an alternative version of these Sūtras, this version eliminates some of the issues relating to the Pāṇinian version, like the double use of the same marker ण्. Also the order हयरवलट्, reminds me of why Kātyāyana is debating the alternative orders -हयवर versus हयरव- in his Vārttikas. He must have some awareness of alternative formulations of these Sūtras in his mind. On p. 56, the Vimalaprabhā says: ऌकारादीनाम् इको यणचीति यणादेश:. This is an excellent observation on the purpose of listing ऌ in the Śivasūtras. On the whole, the comparison of the alternative Pratyāhārasūtras found in the Mañjuśrī-Vyākaraṇa is very revealing for our understanding of a wide spectrum of theoretical formulations in ancient India, of which the Pāṇinian Śivasūtras are only one possible reflection.
