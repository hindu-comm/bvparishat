Dear Deshpande,

Thanks for your reply. I will visit the Bhandarkar institute when I visit Pune next. Had I known that there are reformulations of the Maheshwar Sutras post Panini it would have surely added to my work. Kindly also give me references to pre-Paniniya formulations of letters.

I still do not have any clue as to how the number of letters were added to make the number 64. If you have any clue of how the number 64 was arrived at it will surely illumine me.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
