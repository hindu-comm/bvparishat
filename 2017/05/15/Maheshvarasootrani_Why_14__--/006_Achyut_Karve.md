Dear Deshpande,

It would be very interesting to learn the post Paninian reformulations of the Maheshwar Sutras. I am keen in knowing them. Kindly if you can do forward me the reformulated sutras so that I can work on them in the light of my study of the Maheshwar Sutras.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
