Dear Kamalesh Sir,  
  

Interesting. Will it be possible to be bit clear about what this book is about, is it a discovery?  
  
There is already this monument (I believe a restored one in modern time) in Somnath that clearly mentions about this.  
  
The text reads "THE LIGHT-PATH STRETCHING WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION UPTO THE SOUTH-POLE OVER THE END OF THE OCEAN" same inscription is there in Sanskrit also.  

  

you may check the hi-resolution image [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3b/f5/d7/3bf5d7f2fbac7ada7dd198cf1f6e4ae0.jpg).

Regards,  

Sunil
