Sunil sir! Prabhas is my home town, my childhood playing days have gone in the ground of the somnath temple, at that time the flow of pilgrimage was 1/1000of present day, during the early age I wondered looking trident towards southpole but was not knowing it's value, later days I was lucky to read several books related to religion-vedic and post vedic era later the interest grown and am lucky to talk occasionally with legends of sanskrit and none of them replied me the importance of the unobstructed water path from somnath unto southpole, this thing made me crazy and perhaps if I am not wrong I am among few one who can unveil the secrets to the unparallel water path,

Hope I may bring a small book for this, blessing from the learned group I will expect,

Regards,

Kamlesh pathak
