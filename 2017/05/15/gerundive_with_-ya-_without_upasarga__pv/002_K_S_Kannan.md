Epic Sanskrit is indemnified against violations wrt these pairs:

*ktvā* & *lyap*,

*śatṛ* & *śānac,*

and for that matter,

*parasmai* & *ātmane* in general.

  

The same "living" Sanskrit is betrayed in

*Tantra*-s and *Āgama*-s;

and if we are to go by Charudev Sastri's dicta,

"*vāci śithilāḥ naiyāyikā jyautiṣikāś ca*"!

He could have shown the same concession to

professors of other technical fields too

\- all except grammarians.

  

Nay, he ejaculated, perhaps not in glee :

"*Bhaṭtyādyaiḥ sūribhiś cāpi sampradāyo na rakṣitaḥ*"!!
