Dear Prof Kannan,

I read your valuable posts with keen interest. I also listen to your poems on AIR-Amaravani, Hyd. Many thanks.

  

Your ref to Charudev Sastri, I hope, is wrt to his book "UpasargaChandrika". I believe this book has Hindi commentary. May I know where i can have this book or any other good book on Upasargas with English Commentary. Pl help me.
