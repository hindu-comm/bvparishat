The goal of my interacting with the thread was to help understand the distortion that  

takes place through export and misrepresentation. I see your phrase "contextually adjectivised"  

An. object has an adjective, a concept transforms to another concept.  

Concepts could be more powerful in regional languages when trying abstraction.  

Sanskrit through the Vedas borrows many concepts from the earlier regional languages.  

Here we get into poetic imagination versus historical description.
