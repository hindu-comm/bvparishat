This thread began in discussion of a paper that used the phrase "Buddhist meditation".  

The paper did not explain the phrase nor did it suggest how the teachers deviate from the tradition.  

None of the teachers are authenticated by some one in the tradition.  

So was my problem. I was suggesting to protect the conceptual base of the words in use..
