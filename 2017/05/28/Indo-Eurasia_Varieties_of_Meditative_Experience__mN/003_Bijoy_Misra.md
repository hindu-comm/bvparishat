Ajitji and friends,

  

I just the read the meditation article. I had seen an earlier draft before.

The western clinical view differs diametrically to the Indian view. In the

western view, the mind is a product of the body and sits in the biological

cavity. This gives the prescription of "treating" the mind. In the Indian

metaphysical theory, particularly in the yoga theory, the mind is cosmic

in its origin and effect. We use the "mind", but "mind" is not in our "control."

  

The paper addresses the Buddhistic practices and claims various psychological

states arising due to meditation. Patanjali view is one of discovery and not one

of transformation. It is possible that some practitioners might fall into social

conditions if they are not properly guided. But there is a biological precondition

of simplifying life which is a precondition to meditation. 

  

The experiment as conducted would find that "meditation" can bring in local

instability which would need monitoring and classification. in this process,

mediation possibly becomes an imposition than an intentional exploration. 

I am unfamiliar with various methods stated in the paper.

  

The particular statements that bothered me had to do with the connections of

"meditation" to "religious beliefs". Since Indian scientists copy the western

experimental methods, these statements could cause confusion, in case a

researcher is not well grounded in understanding the cosmological roots of yoga. 

  

This may not be a forum for this discussion. I offered my views because of

the posting. Other scholars may comment if they think through these aspects.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

Boston,MA.
