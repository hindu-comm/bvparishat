Do not mess a written word and the one spoken. What is written is nothing but an abstraction of what is spoken. Thus a word invariably stands for what is spoken. To believe that the written word has a separate existence from that what is spoken is no better than to take a word for the thing it points out to. A concept is well beyond a thing.
It is of the nature of अनुगम. For example force is a concept. It is not of a nature at which we can point a finger. Thus one needs to put both the words abstraction and concept into proper perspective.

With regards,
