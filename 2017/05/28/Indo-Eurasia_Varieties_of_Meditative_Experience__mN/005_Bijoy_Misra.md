Dear Sri Murty,

  

I would think this to be a misrepresentation. Many "new" teachers try

quick money and short cuts. People who have mental and physical

problems would need other herbal therapy before meditation may be

prescribed. Like many other practices, there is an attempt in the west

to bypass the rigor of individualized training. it is rampant. The trouble

as I see from here is that these get imported back to the home country

to challenge the tradition. Such challenges might have happened in

the past. I believe that the tradition would survive, but we need good

soldiers who understand and internalize the merit of the tradition.

The unfortunate part is that some "guru"s show up and endorse the

short-cuts for their promotion and funding. There has to be a massive

revival against the self-promoting "guru"s. 

  

These are personal thoughts as I observe. 

  

Best regards,

  

Bijoy Misra
