We are looking into the neuro-biology of word creation through our group.  

My interest has been how a word carries information. Then we have to understand  

what the information is. i will post the paper when done.  
  

I went to visit a play entitled "unlabeled" in my granddaughter's school last night.  

A king had a labeling ceremony every year where he planted labels on individuals  

as he chose. People eventually rebelled and the king was removed. I heard  

that the children conceived and wrote the script.  
  

Thought to share.  
  

Best regards,
