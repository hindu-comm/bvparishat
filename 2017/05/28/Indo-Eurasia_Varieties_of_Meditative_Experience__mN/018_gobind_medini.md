Dear Sri Bijoy-ji,  

  
Why so? Even though I am not a Sanskrit scholar I know that Bhagavadgita itself uses this word in more than one ways. Even in Yogasutra when we say "अथ योगानुशासनम्" it means a method or a practice - any one of many - by which a spiritual union with the reality underlying the appearances is realized. It may culminate in particular state(s).. अखंडाकार वृत्ति, तदाकार वृत्ति (or whatever); but its polysemy is generally accepted. In any case, Warkaris are mostly Marathi speaking people and follow Marathi texts (ज्ञानेश्वरी, गाथा, एकनाथी भागवत etc). They follow their own terminology in conformance with their tradition.
