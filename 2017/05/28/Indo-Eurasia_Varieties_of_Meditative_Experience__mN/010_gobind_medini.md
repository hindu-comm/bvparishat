While reading a Feb 2009 issue of "Yoga Sudha" a monthly journal of Sw. Vivekananda Yoga Prakashan, Bangaluru, I came across this suggestion by late Dr N Seshagiri basically an electronics and communication engineer, founder director of state-run NIC, and at some point of time associated with IISc, Bangluru:  
  

// We are on the threshold of enabling the injecting of molecule size nanorobots into the heart, lungs, kidney,brain, arteries, and central nervous system and any other internal parts of the human body when it is in any yogic state - be it an Asana, a bandha, prANAyAma, dhyAna, or even Samadhi. The nanorobots inside those body parts can measure various parameters through nanosensors and the measured information is tyhen transmitted via a nano RF transmitters to an external computer outside the body. The computer stores the measurements along with the specific local coordinates of the measured part. You can simultaneously measure a 100 parameters and store a time series of all this. A computer aided simulation of all these parts can then give you the exact physiological status in steps of a fraction of a second. This is almost the technological limit of the yogic experiments on a physical body. This is no science fiction. It is already an operational technology but now the preserves of few dozen institutes and labs like the John Hopkin Institute of Nanobiotechnology.//  
  

Can anybody here comment on the feasibility of such a project? Has such an exploration (which according to Dr. Seshagiri is a part of unification of Yoga and science) has taken place?
