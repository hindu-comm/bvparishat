Ajitji,  

I fail to appreciate. The paper is a part of clinical psychology research.  

Back home, people who are in scientific research do give relevant  

citations. In the areas of yoga, meditation and philosophy, there could  

be some analytic comparison, but not a "he said/she said" argument.  

You have to define what scholarship should be in the context of research  

of the classical texts. Rigor in a work is a function of the discipline.  

In the context of the paper, the sampling is subjective and flawed.  
The rest is a drag.  

Best regards,  

BM
