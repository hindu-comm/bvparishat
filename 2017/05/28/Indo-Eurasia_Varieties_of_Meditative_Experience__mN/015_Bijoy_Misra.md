Dear Sri Gobind,  

Yoga is a technical word, an iconic expression. of a state. Since it is iconic,  

it is not a common noun to accept qualifiers. The technicality lies in the  

appreciation of the "unmanifest" which makes it cosmological. While the  

preceding is a statement, it takes its own framework to be appreciated.  

The failure comes by assuming yoga as a destination. It is the appreciation  

of "non-existence" which is only an unexpressed internal realization.  

Through the courtesy of the uninitiated scholars, distortions do take place.  

There are many other victims. An "object" is probed, a "state" is realized.  

You may analyze further technically.  

Best regards,  

BM
