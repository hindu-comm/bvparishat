Dear Shri Bijoy,  
  

Interesting post! I almost agree with your reading.

yes, chitta vRRitti nirodha.. and yuj etymology.

vRRitti-nirodha is an oxymoron, hence qualifiers are not possible for this undefinable (what you call as iconic) state.

prakRRiti in its original neutral state (guNa-sAmya) is avyakta.. unmanifest. It is cosmological by assumption and not because it is unmanifest (if my reading of sAMkhya on which yoga's ontology is based is correct). puruSha too is unmanifest but it is acosmic.

It is a sAMkhya framework which needs to be understood based on IshvarkRRishna kArikA.

For us (Warkaris) kuNDalini yoga or its pAta.njala framework is the best of paths (GYAneshvarI 6.152, in Marathi) though bahkti yoga is more popular amongst us. The path practically ends here when mind is purified.. knowledge comes by grace of god (because there is a chance element in realization)..but yes final destination is this Realization of... (see next)

We (most of the Warkaris) don't call it non-existence. It is the appreciation or realization of the fullest existence. The final destination. However, for some of my Warkari friends and even for me the word non-existence or emptiness is not an anathema. (We like Buddha and Mahavira as best of Hindus :-)

Classical Yoga is extremely important for all spiritual traditions of India. It is an all-inclusive moral path which is acceptable to both Vedic and non-Vedic traditions (with some variations). Many of us take Upanishads, Bhagavadgita, and Yogasutra (and not Brahmasutra) as the prasthAnatrayI of Hinduism. We Warkaris don't understand Brahmasutra. We stay away from it.
