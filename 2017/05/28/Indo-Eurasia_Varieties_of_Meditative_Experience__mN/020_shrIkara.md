\> Probably the solution lies in quoting each other while writing articles and books. Very sound and rigorous articles are written in many Indian Journals but are not quoted while Indians write articles in Indian Journal. Lets me not talk about regional and vernacular journals where one finds extremely good articles. Time to look inwards first I suppose. We need to consider to have an open sources or paid platforms where all journals present and past issues pertaining to humanities in general and Sanskrit in particular are made available. Its not impossible but are we thinking on these lines?  
  

Is there any sign of such a thing?
