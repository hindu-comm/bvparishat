Just to add..  
  

Word "horse" when written in English script carries sense data and acquires meaning as a linguistic construct (which again is a concept) while it also denotes a concept (abstraction) of horse. Thus, a word can acquire multiple meanings. All such meanings coalesce into the semantic field of that word.
