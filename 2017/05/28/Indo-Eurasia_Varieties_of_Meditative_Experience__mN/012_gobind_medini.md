Dear Sirs,  
  

I have already posted Dr Seshagiri's suggestion vide Feb 2009 issue of Yogasudha of creating a computer database corresponding to various Yogic states - Asana, prAnAyAma, dhyAna, dhAraNA, samAdhi etc. One part of my question is about feasibility of creating such a database.. but other part is how to use such a database even if we are able to create it.  
  

In our Warkari tradition we use and interpret Yoga in a different way. It is for us an instrument of purification of mind - removing greed, avarice, egotism, jealousy, anger, lust etc. Some of us believe that such a purification is possible by leading a simple life, minimizing your needs, and by devotion to god. In short, the focus is on yama-niyama. Other six limbs are there.. even kuNDalini and chakra-s are also there, but they are for concentration and thereby leading the mind away from the impure mind states (greed, lust, egotism etc). Will creation of database and its usage as a part of fusion of Yoga and science will attain this objective of mind purification?
