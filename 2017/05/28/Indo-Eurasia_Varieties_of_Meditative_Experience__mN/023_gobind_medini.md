Shri Bijoy-ji  

  
I appreciate your position; however I was looking for more general questions in respect of workability of meditation, its bilateral impact on body (including brain's neuronal states), implicit role of free will in regulating (or quietening) our mind, and thus in exploring the efficacy of meditation in leading a happy (peaceful) life without forgetting our social responsibility. These questions are being discussed today in contemporary interfaces of science, religion, and philosophy.  
  
This is a multidisciplinary area where language does play role (recall famous vAkyapAdIya of bhartRRhari); so, I am not at all suggesting that your linguistic concerns are out of place. However, for polysemic words - i.e. words with multiple and most of the times interrelated meanings- it is difficult to superimpose or coin a new term in their semantic field. Further these fields themselves are overlapping among themselves. Dharma, Nyaya, Bhagavata, Yoga, Karma etc. are all polysemic words and they are contextually adjectivised to delineate their meaning within the field. (such as saMchit karma, AgAmI karma etc. or rAja-yoga, bhakti-yoga etc,)  
  
Insofar as Warkari sect (more generally known as Bhagavat dharma in its regionalized form) is concerned, they use rAja-yoga as one of the many ways to purify the mind. Please note that they are however, not identified as Raja-Yogi or Bhakti-Yogi but as Warkaris or Bhagvatas. This latter identity is important because that denote a liberal and inclusive spiritual tradition compared to many other traditions which are confined to particular caste, class, or religion. In their regional avatar they are Marathi Warkaris with a particular god (Vithoba) but their theology is all-inclusive and liberal (Pasayadana of Gyaneshwari is the distinguished mark of this theology-philosophy). Their protagonist comes from all castes - particularly from the so called lower castes. Gatha of Tukaram is perhaps the most popular collection of spiritual poems among Warkaris.  
  
(This is a forum mainly for Sanskrit language but we must remember that there is a significant literature - both spiritual and scholarly - in the regional Indian languages)
