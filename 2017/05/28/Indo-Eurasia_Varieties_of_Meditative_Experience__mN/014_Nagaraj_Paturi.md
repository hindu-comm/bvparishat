Dear Sri Gobind-ji,

  

1\. Subjective experience level effects and their consequences to 'psychological' and related deeper effects , not the physiological effects of Yoga are the main focus in Yogaabhyaasa. So the study suggested by Dr Seshagiri is not suitable to th field of Yoga, either its theory or practice.

  

2\. Suitability not feasibility is the issue.

  

3\. You brought the beautiful point that Bhakti traditions like Warkari also can lead to effects similar to those of Yoga. I use the analogy of Operating Systems. Different paths of spiritual practice, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga or Paatanjala Yoga etc., all are like different OS' the ultimate effects of all of them being at the same level. Bhakta Kumbhaara accesses the effects created in him through Paatanjala Yoga type method when the great Yogis Eknath and Namdev visit his house.
