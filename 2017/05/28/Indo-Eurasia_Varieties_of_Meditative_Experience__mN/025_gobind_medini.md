An adjective is also a concept which delineates another concept what you call as object. I don't see (or rather accept) Fregean concept-object duality. Every word for me is a concept. Even a horse is a concept. Only shape, color, texture etc. (sense data) will not give you the meaning of the object "horse" unless you abstract it as an entity by conceptualizing it as a "horse". Object "horse" otherwise has no meaning. Now, how we (in our brain) assign "meaning" to sense data is a general question (whether you name these data as horse or as a table or a tree etc is only post-abstraction). I don't think Science understands this semanticization.  
  
I hold that Brahman semaniticizes the "so called" object; Brahman (whether you call it जीव साक्षि or सर्व साक्षि) is the great semanticizer! Without Brahman objectification-conceptualization is not possible. Now if you want to know (objectify, semanticize) Brahman itself how is it possible? Hence Upanishads say.. येनेदं सर्वं विजानाति तं केन विजानियात्? विज्ञातारमरे केन विजानियादिति (बृ २.४. १४); and hence, as you have rightly observed in one of your previous posts, this is an iconic state. This state cannot be described or defined (assuming it can be realized at the subjective level).  
  

Now coming back to our respective concerns. Your goal in interacting with the thread was to help understand the distortion that  
takes place through export and misrepresentation. As I said, I appreciate your concern. However, my concern was different as mentioned by me in my previous post. We have certain overlapping areas and I believe, we have discussed this intersection.
