Dear Shri Achyut-ji,  
  

Why should a written word is nothing but an abstraction (conceptualization) of spoken word? It is only an alternative representation. For example, if I write "covfefe" and pronounce it in some way (and vice versa), will written and spoken "covfefe-s" abstract each other? They will not make any meaning unless either of them denote some concept. Probably, you are confusing between representation and conceptualization.  
  

I suggest, open a new thread with proper title and and articulate what you want to say properly so that we can discuss meaningfully.
