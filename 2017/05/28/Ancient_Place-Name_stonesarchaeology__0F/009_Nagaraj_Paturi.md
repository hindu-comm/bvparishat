It is my mistake not to have noticed that the post is sent as part of an irrelevant thread.

  

Even the content has no Sanskrit connection.

  

Let us ignore the post.

  

The member may start a new thread if there is any Sanskrit connection. UGC Net exam help etc. do not look good for the group. Any specific question on Sanskrit even if it is from NET exam but the books did not help the student get an answer may be presented to seek the help of the scholars.
