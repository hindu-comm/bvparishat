Dear Sri G S S Murty place name studies in general during modern period is a well established research area. There are a good number of professionally written research works /research dissertations on this topic in various Indian languages.

  

Prof. Iyengar's question is highly specific. It concerns place name board like inscriptions.

  

The places he mentioned are specific.

  

His statement was:

  

To make the query still more pointed, is there evidence for names Pataliputra/Kusumapura, Takshashila, Ayodhya, Avanti, Ujjayini,
Dvaraka, Amaravati, Kanchi, Banavasi, Sthaneshwar, ... (or any other place) being shown in relief at the gateways or nearby locations.
