Dear Sri G S S Murty-ji,

  

There is a possibility that a place name board like inscription of Banavasi , if found, could have been mentioned in the book.

  

The books that I have read first hand are about Telugu place names. I know the other Indian language place name studies through reports and reviews about them.

  

I would certainly be pleasantly surprised if I come to know that if any of these books referring to such an inscription, since I don't remember such a mention.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
