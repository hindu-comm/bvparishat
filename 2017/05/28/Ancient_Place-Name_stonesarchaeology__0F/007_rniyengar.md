I like to add a few further points to better explain my search. In my student days I remember to have seen a stone at the foot of the Tirumala hills with the name of the locality "Alipiri" ಅಲಿಪಿರಿ in Old Telugu very similar to Kannada characters. It is most likely to have been erected there during the Vijayanagar period (I may be wrong). I am looking for some such sign, but more ancient. 

  

Thanks
