Dear Prof.Iyengar,

It is not that you would not already know. But in case you have forgotten, "smaaraye".

Prof Sham Baa Joshi, well known historian and Kannada literary figure of
20th century has written a scholarly book in Kannada on Karnataka village names. I cannot recollect the name of the book- I read it in the fifties during my college days. I googled and wikipedia lists, "YeDagaLu heluva kannada kathe" as one of his books. Perhaps this is the book I read. This book may be of some relevance in your research.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
