I think what Sri Ujjval-ji is doing is a historcal explanation.

  

Kriyaa forms of Hindi being derived from krdanta expressions of Sanskrit is interesting. That makes sense and comes in handy as an explanation for the anomaly being discussed .

  

But that does not imply that the Sanskrit krdanta forms from which the Hindi kriyaa forms can be derived are also kriyaa forms only.
