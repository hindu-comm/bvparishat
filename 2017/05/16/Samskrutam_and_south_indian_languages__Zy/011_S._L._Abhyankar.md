The basic question is about verb form being influenced OR it being NOT influenced by the gender of the subject-word. By my observation, verb form not being influenced makes Sanskrit different from ALL OTHER INDIAN Languages =>

  

**English** He (/she) goes **Sanskrit** सः (/सा) गच्छति **गुजराती**examples ??**हिन्दी** वह जाता है / वह जाती है **मराठी** तो जातो / ती जाते **कन्नड** अवनु होगुत्ताने / अवळु होगुत्ताळे **तमिळ्** examples?? **मल्याळम्** examples?? **पंजाबी** examples?? **बांगला** examples?? **उदिषी** examples??

  

Looks like all languages generally called as "vernacular" have verb-forms influenced by gender of subject-word, In Marathi this influence is seen primarily in sigular, not in the plural in present tense (ते/ताः गच्छन्ति = ते/त्या जातात). But in past tense there is influence both in singular and plural. (सः/सा अगच्छत् = तो गेला / ती गेली; ते/ताः अगच्छन् = ते गेले / त्या गेल्या).

  

Study of such examples brings forth that it is difficult to derive any rule of how the influence of gender of subject word works in vernacular languages. Take the vernacular languages as they are and take Sanskrit as it is. Rather, take every language as it is.

  

In another context also I had shown that it does not become a fruitful exercise to find whether every rule of Sanskrit grammar can be found valid in other Indian languages. In that instance the language was Hindi.
