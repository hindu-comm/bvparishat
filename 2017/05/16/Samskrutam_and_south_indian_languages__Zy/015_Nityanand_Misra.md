What is meant by "cannot tolerate"? If you mean "cannot stand", I do not want to comment on it.

  

If the meaning is "cannot understand", then it is true to quite an extent. However, generally speaking, urban population in south India understands Hindi well enough to carry out a normal day-to-day conversation. This I speak from personal experience, having lived in Thiruvananthapuram (2 months) and Bengaluru (five years) and having visited Mangalore, Mysore, Hyderabad, and Chennai. Even in non-urban tourist places like Shravanbelagola and Hampi, I found that tourist guides and vendors can understand Hindi well and even speak a little.
