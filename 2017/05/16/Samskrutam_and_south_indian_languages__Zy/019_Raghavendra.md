Dear scholars,  
  
DR. BNK Sharma has written a small booklet, several decades ago, on how the Sangam Tamil closely follows Panini. this booklet was published from the Indian Institute of World Culture, Basavangudi, Bangalore. I have a copy of it and will share PDF by this weekend,  
  
thank you and best regards,  
Raghavendra Bheemasena Rao.

\>Dear Sri Nandakumar Menon-ji,  
  
South Indian languages, at least in the established academic circles, are not considered to be derived from Samskrutam. One of the reasons for such consideration is the kind of differences in the grammatical structures, which are bigger in number than the one you point out here.

In most south Indian languages the verb form shows the gender of the karta. Eg. In Tamil "chakotharar ullaar." Has brother. "Chaakothari ullaal" has sister. In Kannada they add thane for male and thale for female. "Thinnuthaane" and "thinnuthaale". Etc. This is not applicable in samskrutam. Since verb is very important in all languages, what do you think caused this shift despite having richly derived from samskrutam ?
