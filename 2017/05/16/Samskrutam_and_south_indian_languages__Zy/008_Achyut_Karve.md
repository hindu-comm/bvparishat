As said by Patanjali words are spoken to convey meaning. The same should be said of sentences. A language evolves for reasons of communication with available resources at hand. There is no previous plan for its structuring. What I mean is the evolution of languages is pragmatic not esoteric. By fitting a jacket on to an enquiry the enquiry does not go an inch further. The special place that Sanskrit occupies in world languages is on account of its esoteric nature and hence we see that the characteristics associated with the noun are codified into the noun as number, gender and case. Tense, person, number and moods are associated with verbs and hence are codified into the verb. This is not the case with spoken languages.

Achyut Karve.
