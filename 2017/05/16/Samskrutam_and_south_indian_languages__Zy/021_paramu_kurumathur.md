In Malayalam, like Sanskrit, there is no distinction of gender in conjugation. avan pokunnu (he goes) avaL pokunnu (she goes); avan poyi (he went) avaL poyi (she went); avan pokum (he will go) avaL pokum (she will go). Malayalam may have lost this gender distinction as it evolved from the then Tamil.

  

The real surprise is how Hindi (and some north Indian languages) developed this distinction when Sanskrit does not have it.
