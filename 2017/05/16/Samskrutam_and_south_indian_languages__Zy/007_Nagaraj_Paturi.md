Historically speaking, the example cited by the thread initiator, is the result of perphrastic construction of the verb resulting from an older equational i.e. NP -NP sentence structure which means a sentence structure where both subject and predicate of the sentence are noun-phrases only.

  

The predicate noun- phrase was in its earliest stages , in south Indian languages, in the cited cases, was a noun phrase made up of participle + pronoun, pronoun encoding person , number, gender in it. e.g., tindaan(a/e) was originally tinda + avan, tindaaL(a/e) was originally tinda + avaL.
