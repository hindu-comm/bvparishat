Prof. Kannan's points are advanced understanding and come under cognitive linguistics. Grammatical structure etc. of each language encodes the cognitive system of the speakers of the language. The worldview, culture etc. of the speakers get encoded in it. That is the basis on which VaiyaakaraNas consider speech of the s'ishTas to be encoding the dharma of the s'ishTas. That is the basis on which vaiyaakaraNas consider that introvert ,introspective study of one's own speech is a spiritual practice.
