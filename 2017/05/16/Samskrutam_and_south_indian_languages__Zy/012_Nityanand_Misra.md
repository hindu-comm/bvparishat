Gujarati is slightly different in this regard.

  

1\) In present tense, both "he goes" and "she goes" are તે જાએ છે (ते जाए छे)

2\) In future tense also, both "he will go" and "she will go" are તે જશે (ते जशे)  

3\) However, in past tense, there is a distinction. "He went" is તે ગયો (ते गयो) and "she went" is તે ગઈ (ते गई).   

One may refer <http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/plc/gujarati/gujaratiwords.pdf> for a summary of parts of speech in Gujarati.  



Surprisingly, these features of Gujarati are similar to Awadhi, where we have

  

1\) In present tense, both "he goes" and "she goes" are सो/वह जावत \[है\]

2\) In future tense also, both "he will go" and "she will go" are सो/वह जाइब. Another style is सो/वह जाइहै for both "he will go" and "she will go"  

3\) However, in past tense, there is a distinction. "He went" is सो/वह गयऊ and "she went" is सो/वह गयी.

  

A good reference for Awadhi is Baburam Saxena's Evolution of Awadhi (1937) which can be had from<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.238311>. Another good reference is Ramchandra Shukla's Jayasi Ki Bhasha which can be read in its entirety here: <http://hindisamay.com/contentDetail.aspx?id=993&pageno=24>

  

I must add that it is unfortunate that Awadhi with nearly 40 million speakers is not included in the list of scheduled languages in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.On the other hand we have languages like Bodo, Manipuri, Konkani, Sindhi included where the number of speakers is much smaller.
