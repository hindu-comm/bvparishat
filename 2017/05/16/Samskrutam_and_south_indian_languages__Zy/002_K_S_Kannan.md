This may have something to do with the philosophical approach.

  

The focus is always on the action (*kriyā/karman*), rather than the actor (*kartṛ*). The prevalence of the *karma-vācya-prayoga*(Passive Voice) is, too, another indicator for the same. Even in *kartṛ-vācya* usages, many times "*ity āhuḥ*" without actually mentioning the agent of *brū*, but only hinting at it if need be - constitutes the general pattern.
