In most south Indian languages the verb form shows the gender of the karta. Eg. In Tamil "chakotharar ullaar." Has brother. "Chaakothari ullaal" has sister. In Kannada they add thane for male and thale for female. "Thinnuthaane" and "thinnuthaale". Etc. This is not applicable in samskrutam. Since verb is very important in all languages, what do you think caused this shift despite having richly derived from samskrutam ?
