The difference in the phonetic structure of North Indian and south Indian languages has not been sufficiently addressed by Sanskrit scholars. Their Sanskrit tongues of North Indian and south Indian speakers is also different. The nature being that of the sutra झलो झलि.
The two झ's in Sanskrit have been classed into into one झ and have not been distinguished in the alphabet and hence the difficulty in appreciating the north and south Indian vernacular languages.
