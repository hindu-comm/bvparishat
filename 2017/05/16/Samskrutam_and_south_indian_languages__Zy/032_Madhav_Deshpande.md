An extensive discussion of the change in the verb system from Sanskrit to Prakrit and then to Modern Indo-Aryans is found in the classic book.

  

Bloch-Jules, (translated from French by) Alfred_Master-

Indo-Aryan from the Vedas to Modern Time  

  

The general consensus is along the lines suggested by Ujjval Rajput, that the systems of later Indo-Aryan are largely based on participles of the earlier Indo-Aryan, and the finite verbs of the old Indo-Aryan diminish in their frequency over time. This is the reason why the gender begins to show up in the verb forms of Hindi, Marathi etc.

  

I have attached the pdf of Jules Bloch's book.
