Dear Colleagues,

  

  I am wondering if anyone has an editable file for the Devanagari QWERTY keyboard for Mac. It comes with the Mac OSX as part of a bundle, and not as a separate keyboard file. I want to be able to edit it with Ukelely to fit it to my own needs. 

  I would appreciate any help in this regard. Thanks.
