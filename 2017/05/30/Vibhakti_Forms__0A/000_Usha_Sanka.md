Namaste

Happy to share some thing just completed first draft my side. (Attached-- Sharing in Telugu and Devanagari scripts)

Here is the excel sheet with all general शब्दरूपs, in three लिङ्गs, three वचनs.. arranged in vibhakti order.

It is expected and guessed that learning the forms will be easier with this outlook.

I do realize that some more work is pending.. but just wanted to take opinions before I proceed, if any.

Please note if anything worthy noting is found. (Errors will be sure dealt again my side as well.)

Comments/Suggestions for improvement are welcome.

धन्यास्मि
