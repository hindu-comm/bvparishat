The attempt by Ushaji is indeed very laudable. Actually the data structure associated with Sabda roopas is 4-dimensional as follows: 1.\_\_kaaraanta 2. vacana 3. vibhakti and 4.linga. It would be ideal to input the data into a Relational Database System in the form of 2-dimensional tables and reading the database in any 2-dimensional plane. While I know what could be done, I do not have the necessary software tools to accomplish it. There are certainly competent software professionals in this group who could build such a system. Even dhaatu roopas are similarly multi-dimensional.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
