नमस्ते,

  

RV 1.161.10

श्रो॒णाम्। एकः॑। उ॒द॒कम्। गाम्। अव॑। अ॒ज॒ति॒। मां॒सम्। एकः॑। पिं॒श॒ति॒। सू॒नया॑। आऽभृ॑तम्।

आ। नि॒ऽम्रुचः॑। शकृ॒त्। एकः॑। अप॑। अ॒भ॒र॒त्। किम्। स्वि॒त्। पु॒त्रेभ्यः॑। पि॒तरौ॑। उप॑। आ॒व॒तुः॒॥

  

Rbhu-s in this mantra are busy creating their systems (वर्ण in main) having द्यावापृथिवी as prototype (also understood as cow).

  

धे॒नुः। कर्त्वा॑ । (to create the cow) and यु॒व॒शा। कर्त्वा॑ । (to make द्यावापृथिवी young again) – mentioned in RV 1.161.03 underscore this point.

  

श्रो॒णाम् उ॒द॒कम् गाम् = the “watery”, but also worn out, cow. This cow needs to be made whole again.

मां॒सम् पिं॒श॒ति॒ सू॒नया॑ आऽभृ॑तम् = the flesh is fashioned (moulded; पिश् used in the same sense as in RV 1.161.9) and created via the sunA (the productive power, Zero).

आ। नि॒ऽम्रुचः॑। शकृ॒त्। अप॑। अ॒भ॒र॒त् = at the end of the creation, the cow-dung (of the cow now restored to health) is carried downwards (to Earth).

पु॒त्रेभ्यः॑। पि॒तरौ॑। उप॑। आ॒व॒तुः॒ = in this deed the parents (Sudhanvana etc/ द्यावापृथिवी deities and ancestors) helped the illustrious children (the Rbhu-s).

  

This is the literal meaning; an in-depth understanding will obviously need a lot of framework/ spadework. Veda is an extremely information dense text.
