Namaste

  

Nice to see the Technology institute taking a shot at ' Traditional Knowledge Systems' and address the dimensions of dilutions and indology centric distortions. Here below are my notes shared.

  

I am open to be a member of the team in this engagement and stretch this debate to the human space across globe . The reframing would be why Indology beyond India? But the framework of dialogue needs to be clearly identified and demarcated for deliverables, audience and further connections to answer w- and why- how- questions.

Here are some concept options to explore:

  

***Option A***:  The exercise to address \<right understandingof our shastras to the average reader> is a loaded statement.

  

Traditionally and conceptually \<Shaastra> is \< Application of Darshana , contextually and purposively through Yoga>. Traditional method and pedagogy to address this issue was grooming the child through family and community models - living tradition and samskaras. Having got this segment disturbed due to globalization and urbanization , what will be the goal aimed in this Open Architecture?

  

***Option B***: The exercise to address \<common problem ... interpretation of certain Indic concepts in the translationdone by Indologists.\> 

  

This is an academic dialogue demanding participation of Scholars and Stake holders in Tradition by Practice- Identity-Pride and Prejudice mixed together.

  

This is not the audience of \<average reader> who needs a satisfying faith -logic blended explanation to stick on to practice. All those who subscribe to Gita philosophy and guidance may not get a scientific explanation of How Sri Krishna presented Viswaroopa , how remote live narration of mahbharata war was delivered to the blind king in palace. There is an unspecified blend of philosophy, mysticism and continuing threads of belief.

So what is to be filtered and graded in re- feeding Gita to the average reader and beat the Gita presentations through media- entertainment channels?

  

***Option C***: on \<English Translation:>

If only one has time to review the reverse process- Sanskrit translation of Holy Bible - available now for 150 plus years; and motivations behind it; the pathetic output , the need to revisit the lexicography related to Sanskrit vocabulary before getting on to more complex issue of ' Indic Language Translation' would be understood.

  

To address challenges of lexicography , one needs to work with Samskruth Language Grammar traditions as Vedanga sysrem. To learn what is veda-anga, one must have a clarity on what ' vedas' are.

To have clarity on what vedas are, one needs to look at Dharma-Shaastras ( and not social history).

  

In the current scenario, i am yet to meet with teams who have clarity and transparent connectivity on these issues ( except some old school traditionalists; who are not welcome to any of modern deliberations. Many are happy and prefer to get more ' likes' on social media and feel happy in reposting and tweeting beaten issues?!)

  

This challenge of Translation across the languages is a bigger issue in Machine Translation projects and Computational Linguistics. This demands a clarity on Language Modeling concepts and what constitutes a \< Sacred Spiritual Language:: Daivee bhashaa> standards . It may not be out of context to draw attention to the Language- memory and understanding- Consciousness models studied by advanced schools in Physics; to see potentials of building a universal programming language for Robotics.
This is where Sanskrit as language of indic traditions are engaged in technology institutes; and not for a social transformation deliverables.

  

This area carries only select group special interest engagements and falls outside the reach of ordinary reader.

  

It would help many like me, if the clarity on these points are provided, so that the teamed exercise can stay focussed and deliver purposefully.
It is a call to be clear on VINIYOGA - Application benefit for target audience ( - as told by Dr, Yadu Moharir; an answer to the question: kasmai devaaya havishaa vidhema - as Rigveda asks).

  

  

If more detailing needed, please contract me off line.
