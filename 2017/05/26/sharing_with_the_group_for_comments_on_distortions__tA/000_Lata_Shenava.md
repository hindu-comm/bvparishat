We are working on an open architecture of knowledge systems at IIT
Bombay (some faculty members at IITB are cced) . A common problem that I find is the interpretation of certain Indic concepts in the translationdone by Indologists. Not being a sanskrit or Vedic Scholar,
we are looking to the group for assistance in placing the right understandingof our shastras to the average reader. While distortion and deliberate misinterpretation is common across all our texts and literature, I will mention herecertain translations that use words that are meant to create newer understanding or associations that fulfill a certain agenda of the translator.

  

Apart from the introduction of Christian concepts like forgiveness and Sins and**fulfillment of wishes (accompanied by a list of desirables,**which are primarily necessary appurtenances for Vedic sacrifices) into the Dharmic narrative, below is the translationof a few verses. I have highlightedthe phrases below that seem distorted.

**"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and famous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in all of us. And when we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."......Marianne Williamson**
