Dr. Lata Shenava

  

You are in an interesting space. As Prof. Paturi suggested, a rich discussion might ensue if the issue is clearly delimited and framed.

  

There are a few words / sentences in red, which pertain to paurusheyatva of the particular text. W.r.t. Veda including the "principal Upanishads", this issue has been well discussed - both in ancient literature and modern academic writing. The non-principal Upanishads are trickier to deal with. For instance the famous chant " Hare Rama Hare Krishna" is from the KalisantaaraNopanishad, which is viewed very favourably in most traditions. Is it considered as Sruti? I have not particularly heard the asertion but would expect it to be treated as such. On the other hand, there is an Allopanishad, which would not be considered as Sruti by most Aryas (respected people - there is no word "Aryan" in Sanskrit). So one issue would be whether Sitopanishad is Sruti or not.

  

The three-fold division of Sakti in the other highlighted portion is interesting. In Tantra the three Saktis are icchaa, kriyaa and jnaana. In Statecraft, one comes across prabhuSakti, mantraSakti and utsAhaSakti. The translation itself is alright. I am not sure as to what you intend to discuss here.

  

Regarding the translation of Rudram, the bias is obvious. If you want the traditional interpretations, etymologies from Niruktam, Sayanacarya etc. could be discussed.

  

Also there is one convention of using "hymn" for a Sukta and "verse" for a Rk, but hymn as such is not usually objected to. Some prefer to use the Sanskrit words as they are, it must be said.
