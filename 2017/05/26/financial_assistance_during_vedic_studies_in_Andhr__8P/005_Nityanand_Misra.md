Thank you Venkata Sriram Ji. Is the report of the survey available? Would be interesting to see what all factors were included in the survey. Other states can learn from Andhra Pradesh's example. While the move may be motivated by vote-bank politics, it is welcome. After all Vedic chanting is in UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The culture of chanting needs to be preserved for this reason also.
