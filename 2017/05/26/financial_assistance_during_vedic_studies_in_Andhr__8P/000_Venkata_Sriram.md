Namaste,

  

Govt. of Andhra Pradesh has initiated several welfare schemes to unemployed brahmin youth and vedic scholars. Here is the website:

It has also introduced several scholarships to poor brahmin students and vedic scholars. Interested may refer to the GOs / Schemes that are being notified in the site periodically.

  

Interestingly, a recent scheme called 'Veda Vyasa Scheme" has been introduced and financial assistance is being provided to vaTus who are undergoing veda adhyayana. Interested may visit the scheme here:

This may be passed to those needy vedic scholars of Andhra who are badly in need of money.

sriram
