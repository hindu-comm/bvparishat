AP has started has started a Brahmin Welfare Corporation a couple of years back. Though the move itself is a result of vote-bank politics, the people running the Corporation are genuine and will ensure that money is not siphoned off or wasted. The CEO, Mr. Venkat (alumnus of IIMA) was earlier the CEO of EMRI which successfully ran ambulances (108) to serve the needy across the country.
