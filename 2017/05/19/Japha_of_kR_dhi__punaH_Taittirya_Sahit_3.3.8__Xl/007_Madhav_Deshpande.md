Dear Deepro,

  

  There is so much food for thought here. It is not easy to explain "why there is this different opinion". Taking a few steps back, the evidence cited by you suggests that there were two different traditions for Jaṭāpāṭha of कृधि पुन:, one producing the version कृधि पुन: पुनस्कृधि कृधि पुन:, while the other producing कृधि पुन: पुन: कृधि कृधि पुन:. One reason for this difference of opinion, is precisely a doubt about what to do about the sandhi in a Vyutkrama segment पुन: + कृधि.
For instance, this segment occurs in the Saṃhitā of Mādhyandina Śukla Yajurveda as पुनस्कृधि, but this is in the Saṃhitā itself, and not in a Vyutkrama segment. If we assume that this represent the Saṃhitā form of Sandhi, the Vyutkrama version in the Jaṭāpāṭha should show a form of anārṣa sandhi, which would yield पुन: कृधि. In the case of the Taittirīya tradition, the Śikṣās and the commentaries are seeking guidance from the rules of the Taittirīya Prātiśākhya, the rules that are not specifically designed for Jaṭāpāṭha, and so the guidance for what happens in the Vyutkrama segments is not entirely clear. It appears that there were two different traditions of recitation, and then the commentaries are seeking to justify one or the other version using the rules of the Taittirīya Prātiśākhya, that are not specifically designed to apply to the Jaṭāpāṭha. I infer that there is some such background to this difference of opinion among the commentators. This is the best I can think of at the moment.
