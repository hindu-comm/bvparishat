Dear Sri Achyut Karve,

  

Before suggesting to highly accomplished stalwarts like Prof. Deshpande saying,

  

"I feel that scholars like you need to take these aspects up and try to address the irregularities from a standard phonetic perspective presented in the Maheshwar Sutras.",

  

did you study his very big number of publications on issues such as the ones pointed out by you as "the issues related to discordance among various grammarians of yester years which might be on account of changing phonetic structures in the course of history." ?

  

Please start with first taking just a list of publications. Then before making suggestions to him, check if he already covered these issues or not.

  

I am saying this because many members of the list know that he published a lot already on ""the issues related to discordance among various grammarians of yester years which might be on account of changing phonetic structures in the course of history"

  

When you suggest to him all these , such members may look at you smilingly or may get annoyed.

  

Please remember that this list has a very big number of highly accomplished scholars in the area of SamskrutavyaakaraNa and modern studies on it and so on.

  

That great figures like Prof, Deshpande are showing their magnanimity in patiently explaining things to non-professionals too should not be taken advantage of.

  

Please enrich the list with the areas of your expertise.

  

Since you say that your expertise lies in the area of Tabla, please educate us in that area which is one of the less discussed areas in the list.
