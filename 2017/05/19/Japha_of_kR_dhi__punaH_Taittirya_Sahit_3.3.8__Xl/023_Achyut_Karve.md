Dear Vidyashankar,  
It did occur to me that there was no need to have a sandhi. However I thought that if a sandhi is necessitated as a marker for counting the jatpatha patha the स् distorts the following pada and hence र् should be used instead. However as a matter of fact what you have said is more correct the jivhamuliya would do the job.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
