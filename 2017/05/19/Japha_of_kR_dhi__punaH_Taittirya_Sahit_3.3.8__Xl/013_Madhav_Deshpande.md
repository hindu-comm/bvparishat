Dear Shri Karve,

  

  The grammarians and the authors of the Lakṣaṇa granthas are simply trying to account for what actually happens in the usage of language, and they are not creating anything new that contradicts the known usage of language. As I have pointed out with textual references, the usage of the combination पुनस्कृधि is well established in multiple Śākhās of the Yajurveda:

  

(Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance):

Considering the variation of पुनस्कृधि and पुरस्कृधि among the different Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda noted by Bloomfield, one can speculate about which of these readings is phonetically more natural. Under such a consideration, पुरस्कृधि appears to be phonetically more normal, as compared to पुनस्कृधि. However, that does not make one reading more or less authentic. Once the different Śākhās of the YV get historically established and attain a stable form, the grammarians and the authors of the Lakṣaṇagranthas have to account for the readings as they have received. The grammarians occasionally note certain exceptional facts about different Vedic Śākhās. For instance, in his Mahābhāṣyadīpikā, Bhartr̥hari notes that occasionally the Taittirīyas pronounce the word अग्नि as अग्णि (तैत्तिरीया: कृतणत्वमग्निशब्दमुच्चारयन्ति). He is simply pointing to a fact of the Taittirīya recitation as he heard it. This is phonetically irregular, and yet Bhartr̥hari is not questioning its authenticity. All languages have instances that violate the general rules that apply to the bulk of their usages. This is what forces grammarians to come up with exceptions to general rules.
