Dear friends and the moderators,  

Good morning from a far away land. I just have a suggestion that has come to my mind for some time.  

Should we have a protocol for people to introduce themselves and their interests before engaging in open discussion?  

While the forum should be open, some professional protocol could help in creating a more productive exchange.  

Or the new person might be requested to post any article that supports his or her viewpoint. It could help in maintaining  
a level of necessary scholarship in argumentation and participation.  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
