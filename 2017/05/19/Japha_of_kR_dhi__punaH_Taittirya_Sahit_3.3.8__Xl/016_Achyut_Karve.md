Dear Deshpande,  
I am a Marxist. Yet my studies over the last forty odd years of the classical Tabla as rendered by the great maestro Ahmedjan Thirakwa that have made me come to the conclusion that a unique phonetic structure in an evolving language is possible. This is also true of the music of Balgandharv. They are those phonetic conclusion that I have presented in the book I have written. Further I am also seeing the dissolution of this structure happen in the modern tabla in just a matter of a generation which is also true of Hindustani Indian classical music. All this put together makes me argue with you the way I am arguing. I am presently writing an article on the relationship between the Classical Tabla and the Maheshwar Sutras on completion of which I will send you a copy.

Had it not been for this study which is contemporary and in line with phonetic structure of the Maheshwar Sutras I would not have dared arguing.

Once again though your view points are founded on sound available scientific literature yet I feel that we need to revisit the issues related to discordance among various grammarians of yester years which might be on account of changing phonetic structures in the course of history.

I am no Sanskrit scholar. I feel that scholars like you need to take these aspects up and try to address the irregularities from a standard phonetic perspective presented in the Maheshwar Sutras.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
