Dear Shri Karve,

  

Patañjali says: "शब्दप्रमाणका वयम्। यच्छब्द आह तदस्माकं प्रमाणम्। शब्दश्च शब्दज्ञाने धर्ममाह।" The grammarians had no intension of creating a new language form to fit dharma. It is just the proper understanding of language by means of grammar that leads to dharma according to Patañjali. Sanskrit grammar is different from the grammars of other languages only to the extent that the traditional Sanskrit grammars, produced within the framework of Vedāṅga, had a necessary religious context, and therefore, Patañjali uses dharma as the purpose (prayojana) for the study of Sanskrit grammar. Modern grammars are not written in the context of religion, and so they may not use the terminology of dharma. Yet describing the facts of a language as they are remains the main function of a grammar. Grammarians cannot alter the facts of a language, whether that language is Sanskrit or some other language. Every language contains regularities and irregularities.
Grammarians are then required to describe the facts of a language by using general rules that have a wide application, and exceptions to those general rules which deal with irregularities. Neither Sanskrit nor Sanskrit grammars are exceptions to this general pattern.
