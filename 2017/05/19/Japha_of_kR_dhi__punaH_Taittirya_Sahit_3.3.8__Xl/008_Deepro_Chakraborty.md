Dear Prof. Deshpande,

I have somehow understood the reason behind these differences through a broader perspective provided by you. The practitioners can tell us what they actually utter during recitation. From the literature it seems that the form पुनस्कृधि is more common. I would like to draw your attention to one surprising fact that both the texts जटामणि and जटावल्ली contain these two opposite verses. Moreover, the prohibitive verse keeps the form पुनस्कृधि (यथा पुनस्कृधिबलान्न सत्वविधिरिष्यते).  
Regards,

Deepro.
