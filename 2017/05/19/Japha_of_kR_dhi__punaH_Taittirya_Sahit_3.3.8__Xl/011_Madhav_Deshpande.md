Dear Vidyasankar,

  

That is interesting to know that the Viloma segment does not follow the anārṣa sandhi rules as stipulated in the Lakṣaṇagranthas. I wonder whether this Jaṭā recitation follows some specific Lakṣaṇagrantha for the Taittirīya tradition, or this is a local practice following the analogy of expressions like br̥haspati, vācaspati etc. My study of the manuscripts of the Kramapāṭha and Jaṭāpāṭha for the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda reveals local variations in the practice of these modes of recitation.
