Dear Achyut,

  

I believe in the thread of responses to your original query, one crucial point got left out. In the natural course of sandhi as per typical grammar, there would be no occurrence ofर् while joining पुन: with कृद्धि. The visarga would be pronounced as a जिह्वामूलीयinstead. The question of "instead of र्" doesn't arise.  
  
The question should be, "why is there स्instead of जिह्वामूलीय?" And the short answer, to summarize the detailed explanations provided by the scholars here, is that numerous vaidika usages continue to remain exceptions to one's expectation as per usual grammar rules, sometimes even in theविकृति recitations.

  

Best regards,  

Vidyasankar

  

ps. Note that there is another sandhi,मयः + कृधि = मयस्कृधि, which would be familiar to those who know the rudra chant from YV.
