Dear Deshpande,

Very nicely put forth. However the question remains what is natural.
Patanjali writes that Grammar helps in removing doubts as well stating rules guided by dharma. However here it appears that Grammar states what is in vogue. Going by this it would make very little difference between Sanskrit grammar and the grammar of any other language.

Achyut Karve.
