Not to beat a dead horse, but would you describe the स् in namas-kAra/kRta/karomi/kurmaH as distorting the pada that follows namaH?  
  
The reason I ask is that you are approaching this from a perspective of how the resultant word sounds to the ear. And I believe that throughout the history of the spoken language, visarga changing to -s, when followed by kakAra, is well attested. It doesn't at all seem go against phonetic expectations. If anything, it is the jihvAmUlIya and upadhmAnIya with which people seem to have greater difficulty, as far as euphonics are concerned.

  

Best regards,
