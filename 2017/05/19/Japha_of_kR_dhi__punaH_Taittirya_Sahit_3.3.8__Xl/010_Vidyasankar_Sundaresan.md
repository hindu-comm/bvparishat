The namaH pada takes the -s ending when followed by pakAra in the viloma phrasing of YV vikRti pAThas. Thus, it is pataye namo namaspataye pataye namaH, for jaTApATha of the rudra namaka, unlike how the visarga sandhi happens in regular usage, as in namaH pArvatI pataye.

I wonder if there is a list of pada-s such as these as well as the contexts where the anArsha regular sandhi rules do not apply. Or is it dependent on the kR root appearing after the visarga, e.g. as in namaskAra/namaskaromi?
