Dear Deepro,

  

  I am glad to see that you are going deeper into this subject, which very few people study and understand. For the occurrence ofपुनस्कृधि in the various Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda, check the references in Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance:

  If this is the Saṃhitā form of the sandhi in पुनस्कृधि in all these various Śākhās of the YV, there is a genuine question about what would happen in the same sounding segment appearing as a Vyutkrama segment in the Jaṭāpāṭha. The reading पुनस्कृधि in the Jaṭā is perhaps influenced by the occurrence of पुनस्कृधि in the Saṃhitās of the YV, while the normal expectation for the Vyutkrama segments is to apply anārṣa or normal rules of Sanskrit sandhis, which would give पुन: कृधि. With best wishes for your research in this difficult field,
