Dear Deshpande,

To my belief even when we phonate the word क्लृप्ति in Marathi the लृ is phonated retroflex thus ऋ,लृ can become Savarnas on account of they both being retroflex or murdhanya vowels. Thus those who doubt लृ to be retroflex is on account of their mother tongues being of a different genere. The fact that Panini has clubbed them into the same maheshwar sutra itself proves that he considered ऋ and लृ to have the same आस्य.

Is it not a matter of astonishment that the word ऋषि is phonated dental and लृ is phonated retroflex in Marathi.

The reverse might be the case in other Indian languages and hence the differences in interpretation.
