Dear scholars,

Can anyone throw light on the below mentioned query?

If ऋ and लृ are Savarnas how can ऋ be murdhanya and लृ dental. And further in the same way how can र and ल be Savarnas if र is murdhanya and ल is dental. From my point of view if they both are to be Savarnas both should be either murdhanya or both should be dental.

Please comment.
