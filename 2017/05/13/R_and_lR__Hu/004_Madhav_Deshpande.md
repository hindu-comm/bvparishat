Dear Shri Karve,

  

This is achieved by Pāṇini's rule कृपो रो ल:, which does not require sāvarṇya of r̥ and l̥. This is precisely why Patañjali questions the necessity of listing l̥ separately in the Śivasūtras. Later grammarians begin offering examples like the sandhi of मम+लृकार: \> ममल्कार:, suggesting the need for a separate sandhi treatment for लृ. In my view, Pāṇini was more in line with the Prātiśākhyas, which state that all vowels, except लृ can occur in the beginning of words (consider rules of Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā 1.1.5-6: पदान्त्य: पद्य:, अन्लृकार: स्वर: पद्य:). This is the case, because in Sanskrit usage (not technical terms in grammar) as known to the ancient grammarians, the sound लृ occurred only in the forms of the root क्लृप्, and this was taken care by Pāṇini and the Prātiśākhyas by providing rules to change the 'r' to 'l' in the root given as कृप् (Pāṇini: कृपो रो ल:, Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā: कृपे रेफस्य लकार:). So Pāṇini and the Prātiśākhyas are of the same view, while it is Kātyāyana who offers a changed stipulation of the sāvarṇya of r̥ and l̥. Grammatical theory changes from Pāṇini to Kātyāyana in some respects, and these changes are not often easily recognized. The best extensive treatment of this question is to be found in an article by the late Professor Paul Thieme. The article is in German, and if you are interested, I can forward it to you.
