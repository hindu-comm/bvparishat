Dear Shri Karve,

  

These two vowelsऋ and लृ are not savarṇas due to their phonetic features (Pāṇini: तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्). Their sāvarṇya is stipulated through a Vārttika of Kātyāyana (ऋलृवर्णयोर्मिथ: सावर्ण्यं वाच्यम्) in spite of the phonetic differences, because Kātyāyana would like to extend certain treatments for ऋ to also apply to लृ. There is a long history of dispute regarding the necessity of this Vārttika, and in the Paspaśāhnika, Patañjali even seems to question the need to list लृ in the Śivasūtras. The versions of Śivasūtras in some other non-Pāṇinian grammars seem to take a hint from this and omit लृ all together. The sāvarṇya of r̥ and l̥ stipulated by Kātyāyana eventually leads to the proposal to consider "ra" in (उरण् रपर:) to be a pratyāhāra of r in "hayavarṭ" with "a" in "laṇ", so that "ra" in this sūtra could also include "l". This idea of ra-pratyāhāra has been widely disputed in the tradition, leading to several works titled र-प्रत्याहार-खण्डन.
Therefore, while it is commonplace to assume the sāvarṇya of r̥ and l̥, following commentaries like the Siddhānta-Kaumudī, this is not something that we can be certain to hold true for Pāṇini's original system. There is a good deal of research on this topic, and if you are interested, I can forward it to you.
