Dear scholars,  
As a non academician it could put my hands on the statement in the Paniniya shiksha that the total number of letters or more particularly Aksharas are 64. Has this view regarding the number of letters been contested by other shikshas? What is the most ancient source of this statement? Who first counted these 64 letters?

Achyut Karve.
