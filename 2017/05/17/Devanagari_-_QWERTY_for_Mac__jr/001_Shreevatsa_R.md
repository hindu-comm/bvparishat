Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

I'm afraid that most matters of appearance, such as the position of the anudātta marking relative to the vowel sign, are a function of the font, rather than the key layout. The input method (key layout) controls only (Unicode's idea of) the content. You can experiment by trying rendering the same text indifferent fonts. Below is a gif "video" of my trying this out at<https://r12a.github.io/pickers/devanagari/> -- you can see that some fonts do this worse than others.

So changing the font will probably solve the problem completely in your case, as you've already got very far.

Regards,
