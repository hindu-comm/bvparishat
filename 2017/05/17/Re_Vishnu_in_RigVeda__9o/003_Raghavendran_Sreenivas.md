Dear Dmitry Ji/Venkata Sriram Ji

  

The same asura link opens again as said by Venkata Sriram

  

But having said that - I have a work around:

  

Manually remove the "asura" part in the link and type in the text "Vishnu" and the right document has opened without any problem.

  

Namaste,

  

With Regards,

  

Sreenivas
