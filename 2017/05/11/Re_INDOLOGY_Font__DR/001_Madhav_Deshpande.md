Hello Friends,

  

  I have now added R̥, L̥ and Ḷ (besides r̥, r̥̄, l̥, and ḷ) to my MMDUnicode.keylayout for Mac. I have attached the changed version.
Have not been able to add long versions of R̥ and L̥, but they don't occur in the initial position anyway, and so that should not be an issue. Try it out and see if it works for you.

  

Madhav
