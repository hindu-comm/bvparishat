Namaste Madhva Raj,

  

Do look up<https://archive.org/details/sandhybhshyasamu00sand> for a collection of bhAShya on Sandhyaavandana. It includes two maadhva bhaashyas. See page 72 in the PDF for pramANa and details on the sequence and points for 'upasparshana'.

  

As suggested by other members, there are numerous websites / pages, related to vaishnava sampradaya, which give the images you are looking for. (<https://vicharavedike.wordpress.com/tag/urdvapundhra/> for example). It is easier to consult a local maTha's acharya for getting this information.

  

Regards,

Krishna
