Is it linked to Shukla and krishna paksha and the 12 namas change accordingly ?.

  

Does anybody have the image or list where to touch 24 places during keshava nama recitation.

  

Are there any methods to remember 24 keshava roopas easily.

  

Whats the significane of Shanka,Chakra,Gad and Padma which vishnu holds in his hands.
