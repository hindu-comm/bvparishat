Dear Shrivatsaji,

  

  Thanks for your detailed response. I have been using the "EasyUnicode" keyboard for Mac, but as you say, it does not include "r̥ r̥̄ l̥ l̥̄". Will see if I can produce an edited version of "EasyUnicode" that will allow me to produce these combinations. I have done keyboard editing previously using Ukelele. Will try this again. Best,
