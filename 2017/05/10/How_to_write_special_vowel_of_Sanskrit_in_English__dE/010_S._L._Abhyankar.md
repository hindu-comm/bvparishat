I guess Google Input Tools are Unicode. And when using Google I get लृ as the topmost option when typing "lR".

Also at <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/>I get क्लृप्तिः as Devanagari Unicode output on typing "klRptiH" which is taken to be Harvard-Kyoto Input.

It seems Harvard-Kyoto is fairly free from diacritics and hence as much simple and straightforward, yet gives good Devanagari Unicode Output.
