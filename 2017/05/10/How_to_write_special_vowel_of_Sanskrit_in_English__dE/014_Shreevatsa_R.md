Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

To produce those characters, what one needs is not precisely a font per se, but an "input method". Once the characters are entered into wherever they should be (such as the body of an email or text file), they will be displayed/rendered using whatever fonts the reader has available on their system. (For example, you may see the characters in a different font than I do, and yet both should see the same characters "r with ring below", "r with ring below and macron above", etc. -- and it is even possible that someone who doesn't have a suitable font installed will see boxes, though that is thankfully becoming rarer these days.) In this case, if you were able to see the characters, it means you already have whatever fonts are needed.  

  

To actually produce the characters: one could produce them by  

\(1\) copy-pasting from some document where they are already present, (plain text files or web pages in your browser are best, such as the Wikipedia page I linked earlier),

\(2\) using a transliteration tool, (many years ago I wrote a couple of transliteration tools for myself:<http://shreevatsa.appspot.com/sanskrit/transliterate.html> /<http://shreevatsa.appspot.com/transliteration/version2.html> -- and in this case I copied from the second one of them),

\(3\) using a particular input method: this will vary by operating system; for example on Windows one can hold down Alt and type +0325 to input the "combining ring below" (<http://www.fileformat.info/tip/microsoft/enter_unicode.htm>). Thus to producer̥̄ one would type r, then hold down Alt and type +0325 on the numeric keypad (and release Alt), then hold down Alt and type +0304 (and release Alt).

  

Needless to say, none of the above methods may be convenient if one needs to use these characters frequently. For this, one installs an "Input Method Editor" (by any other name) that is specially designed for the input one usually needs. (E.g. on Mac OS X I use a modification of "EasyUnicode" from<http://www.tipitaka.org/keyboard/> to input IAST characters, but those don't includer̥ r̥̄ l̥ l̥̄ — as I need those characters only very rarely, I use one of the other methods. But it could be made more convenient if necessary...)
