Dear Shri Joshi,

  

  The common Roman transcription for लृ is "ḷ", namely the character for L with a dot underneath. However, in some older works of Indo-European linguistics, all vocalic consonants are written with a small circle underneath the character. This is not a common practice any longer. The transcription "lṛ" for लृ is a mistaken transcription, as there is no "r" in लृ, but it is simply a vocalic form of ल. The actual phonetic composition of ऋ लृ has been discussed in works of Sanskrit grammarians and phoneticians, with some differences of opinion recorded.
