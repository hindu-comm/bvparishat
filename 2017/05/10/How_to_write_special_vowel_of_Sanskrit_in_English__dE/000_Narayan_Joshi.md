Respected scholars, Namaste!

Referring to the book, “Sanskrit Grammar” by R.G.Bhandarkar

(Bharatiya Kala Prakashan,Delhi, revised edition 2007), the special Sanskrit vowel I is transliterated as ( ļŗ ) (No.1) while in other books it is simply ļ (No.2) Then which one is correct No.1 or No.2? I also attached PDF of this posting.

Please help. Thanks. NRJOSHI
