Dear Professor Kannan,

  

  If I understand your question correctly, it has two dimensions.
First, are the consonants r and l involved in the constitution of the vowels r̥ and l̥. According to Patañjali, the vowel r̥ is made up of two aj-bhaktis "small or extra short vowels on both sides of a consonantal r. This is often represented as ƏrƏ. This representation is evidently similar to how the vocalic r is represented in the old writing of Avesta (but I don't have first hand knowledge of Avestan writing). The constitution of vocalic l̥ would be something similar, with a consonant L flanked by two aj-bhaktis. The commentaries on Pāṇinian grammar sometimes also talk about varieties of r̥ and l̥, with two r-s and l-s inside. So there is some variation in the conceptions about the constitution of these sounds. 

  The second question, if I understand correctly, is if the consonantal r can be combined with a vocalic r̥. Such a combination does occur in the word निर्ऋति, and that is a rare combination. The actual use of l̥ (लृ) is found only in the forms of the root kl̥p (क्लृप्). 

  That is the best that I can say in response to your questions. With best wishes,
