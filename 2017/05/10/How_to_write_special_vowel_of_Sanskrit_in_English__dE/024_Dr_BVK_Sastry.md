Namaste





In this thread of discussion, several related yet complexly intertwined issues are surfacing : The complex intertwining is on (a)
Identifying the Script and Scripting Logic of Primary, Combines and Conjuncts Sounds of Samskrutham, used in Bhashaa and Chandas
documents by Voice First and then in several indic languages and later in to Latin scripts and even later in to IPA notation / Fonts/ Latin conventions hybrids of Roman Alphabets , called IPA notations. This will help to understand the PRINT TEXT, transmit the Voice-Visuals in a language convention by which the devices and communications operate in the digital world. Will this help to give True reading and accurate pronunciation of the ‘ Human Voice behind the Scripted document’ ? – This is a major challenge. Some of the team members do know of my initiatives since 2011 and my research inputs in this direction to progress from ‘ Unicode’ to ‘ UNI-VOICE-Code ( =Universal Voice Code), an initiative to journey in implementing the statement of previous century :Sanskrit is best suited language for computers’: HOW ?




Please write to me off -line if any one desires to be a part of this project. 



Here below are the focused issues pointing to the ‘ Sthiti’ for which some ‘Sad-gati’ seems to be shown, using the ‘ Samskrutham Shikshaa Shaastra’ and ‘ Lipi-Shaastra’. 



Mail quote-excerpts:

 \<Nagaraj Paturi : स्थितस्य गतिश्चिन्तनीया ,..>



 and \< KS Kannan : My question has remained unanswered - regarding the combinations ofthe particular consonants with particular vowels …. And the plutations where valid ….. Has anybody contemplated on the addition - and the consequent pronunciation/representation/ transliteration - of the vowels ṛ, Ṛ (ie. the long ṛ), and lṛto the consonants r, l, and ḷ ? \> 



 and \< Prof. Deshpande: \< I have been using the "EasyUnicode" keyboard for Mac, …. I have done keyboard editing previously using Ukelele. Will try this again .. To produce those characters, what one needs is not precisely a font per se, but an "input method". … But most Sanskritists are not concerned with representing ळ, and therefore represent लृ with "ḷ". \> 



 and \< SReevatsa : IAST (the International Alphabet for Sanskrit Transliteration… .ISO 15919 (Transliteration of Devanagari and related Indic scripts into Latin characters): >



 and \< Narayan Joshi : \< special Sanskrit vowel I is transliterated as ( ļŗ ) (No.1) while in other books it is simply ļ (No.2) Then which one is correct No.1 or No.2? I \>
