Dear Shri Kannan,

  

  You have raised a good question. If one uses "ḷ" for ळ, then how should one represent लृ? One way I have done this in some of my publications is to represent लृ with "l" with a small circle underneath it, rather than a simple dot. This is what one finds in old work's like Wackernagel's Altindische Grammatik. But most Sanskritists are not concerned with representing ळ, and therefore represent लृ with "ḷ". The special diacritic fonts that I had designed myself had the provision to represent "r" and "l" with a small circle underneath, but those fonts were not unicode fonts, and therefore I can no longer use them.
Ideally, we need to distinguish between ळ and लृ in Roman transcription. In any case, the transcription "lṛ" is phonetically quite misleading in my view, since there is no "r" in लृ.
