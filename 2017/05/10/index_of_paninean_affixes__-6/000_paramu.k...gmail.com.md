Does anyone know if there is a comprehensive index of Paninean affixes (and their behaviours) and other affixes used to create words?



I was looking at the word **sótu** from ví hí sótor ásr̥kṣata néndraṃ devám amaṃsata (RV 10.86.1).



How is the word derived from ? What is the affix added to it to get **sótu**? Is it tosun?
