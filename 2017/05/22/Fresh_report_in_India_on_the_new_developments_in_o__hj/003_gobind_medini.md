// Before we worry how California schools are portraying Hinduism is it

  
not urgent to worry how Indian schools are portraying Hinduism and  

history?//  
  

Any specific points and suggestions as to what is worrying and how it is to be set right in the portrayal of Hinduism in India?  
  
//Why should good ideas always come from the West?//  
  
आ नो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः is the Rigvedic maxim (RV 1.89.1).  

So even if the good ideas and thoughts come from the West, there is no problem, though I do not know how its applicability here.  
  
Yes, if the source of ideas is ALWAYS (the so called) West, then possibility of colonial and servile mind-set cannot be ruled out.. but the true spirit of RV 1.89.1 will remain intact to guide us.
