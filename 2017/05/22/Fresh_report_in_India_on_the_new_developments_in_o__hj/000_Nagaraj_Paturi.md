May it be remembered that many of the present hot developments in the area of Indological studies have their origin in the response of the Indian origin parents to the problem faced by them in answering the questions from their children based on what they heard in their classroomsand read in their text books about India and Hinduism. Parents who disagreed with what they heard from their children reacted in several different ways ranging from stopping at helping their children get the perspective through critical reception of the class room teaching - through the parents themselves trying to encourage through funding research with a better perspective on India in American universities - to parents themselves plunging into research with a better perspective on India and producing counter narratives to the then prevalent ones. Some of the present conference series in India on Indological topics too have their origin in this class room born parent children discussions and the responses of the parents. The California text book issue is one such development resulting from such families having got to handle the children's learning at school.
