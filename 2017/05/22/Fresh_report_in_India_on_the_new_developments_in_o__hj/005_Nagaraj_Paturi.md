Dear Sri Gobind-ji,

  

In this case, 'the west' does not mean the European origin Americans. It is the Indian origin Americans who reacted to the text books there.

  

Since Sri Venkatesh Murthy-ji's response was to the post reporting the reaction of the NRIs, and since he says "Why should good ideas always come from the West?' the 'west' here should mean NRis and 'good things' here should mean their reaction.

  

You were asking for specific instances of Indian situation.

  

The most well known comparable debates in India are the NCERT text book debates. I already posted the Wikipedia article on that issue and pointed out that the Indians did not wait for the 'west' (NRIs) to guide them. The protests to the content of the NCERT books have been there right from 1961. The article mentions the topics on which the controversies were centered and the ideologies that clashed etc.

  

There could have been similar controversies around ICSE or state board books of various states too.

  

The point is that Indians staying in India did not wait for the NRIs to guide them in this regard.

  

What I did while posting the news was to explain the significance of this for us in India by pointing out things like 'Some of the present conference series in India on Indological topics too have their origin in this class room born parent children discussions and the responses of the parents.' in US.
