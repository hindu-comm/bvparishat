Dear Shri Venkatesh Murthy,  
  

The spirit of RV 1.89.1 is applicable in respect of American or European Indians as well. Native (resident) Indians will be happy to take ideas and learn from them if necessary. At the same time Indians (Hindus) will worry wherever the Hinduism is distorted - whether in the text-books, on the Internet, or any other public forum.  
  

Yes, earlier NCERT textbooks had a Marxist bias. Hopefully, the things will fall in place without going into other extreme (like claiming the invention of airplanes and missiles in ancient India etc.). Even within history, the objective presentation of ancient and early medieval period is possible without causing political furor. Upinder Singh's book is the evidence of this possibility, though she had to skip invasions of Muhammad bin Qasim, Mahmud Ghazni, and Muhammad Ghori; while, the period she was supposed to cover was from the stone age to the 12th Century. In the Indian subcontinent this problem of objectivity in history is more evident in Pakistani text books (see, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_textbooks_controversy)). The magnitude and effect of this problem in Pakistan is destabilizing the region. This will also caution the Indian counterpart about how not to construct the text-books.  
  

I believe, a new paradigm of liberal nationalism is in the making in India. The days of belittling Indian nationalism and Hinduism are over, particularly at the official level - at the center and in most of the states. This nationalism will be confident enough to acknowledge past weaknesses and fault-lines, and learn from the history without being captive to it.
