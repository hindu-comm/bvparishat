Dear Sri Ashok Gudsoorkar-ji,

  

The professor-poet while sending the poem to me wrote the following:

  

I am very happy to share myखण्डकाव्य titled चायोपाख्यानम्. It is composed in the Rathoddhataa metre and got published recently in Samskrita Pratibha. I am looking forward for your comments and guidance.

  

Sharing it with BVP list members was my idea. With the poet's permission, I shared it here.

  

You may see that the metre is mentioned as Rathoddhataa.

  

Rathoddhataa is one of the eleven syllable vritta metres.

  

The gaNa-s are : ra, na, ra, va ( \_ U)

  

It runs asनानना ननन नानना नना

  

You may sing it asनाननान नननान नानना also.

  

It has four lines in this rhythm. 1- ārōhaṇa 2-avarōhaṇa 3- ārōhaṇa 4-avarōhaṇa At the end of the 2-ava2-avarōhaṇa there is a pause leaving expectation for continuation. At the end of4-avarōhaṇa, there is a concluding fall.

  

It is a humorous narrative titled as cāyamāhātmyam or cāyōpākhyānam. upākhyānam, in fact, makes it lōk like a sub-narrative of a bigger one, say a purāṇa or something like that. To make it look that way is , again, for humor only. The humor in the word māhātmyam does not need explanation.

  

The story is beyond the scope of this mail.
