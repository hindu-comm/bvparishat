I had sent the pdf of Cāyopākhyāna to my sister (Dr. Manik Thakar) in Pune. She is also a Sanskritist who used to teach at the Pune University. She enjoyed the Cāyopākhyāna, and remembered that one of our Sanskrit teachers in Pune used to say: चहापानं मनुष्याणां केवलं सुखवर्धनम्. The standard signs in Marathi on tea-shops describe their tea as being अमृततुल्य.
