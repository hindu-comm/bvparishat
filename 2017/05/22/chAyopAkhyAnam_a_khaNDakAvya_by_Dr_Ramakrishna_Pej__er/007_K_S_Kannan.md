Excellent composition by Dr Ramakrishna Pejathaya.

  

Need a small clarification:

  

Verse 10 has

*durvidhir bahuguṇam balīyasī.*

  

I guess *(dur-)vidhi* is masculine;

in which case *balīyasī ,* feminine*,*may not accord with it.

  

Does it need some replacement, then,

or have I misunderstood something?
