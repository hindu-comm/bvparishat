I thank Dr Ramakrishna Pejathaya for the simplicity and generosity he evinced in easily admitting the mistake I pointed to in his composition, even though it is a minor one:

*eko hi doṣo guṇa-saṁnipāte!*

  

After all, who errs not? *vidvāṁso'pi vimuhyanti!*

  

Rare are people, however, who can admit thus plainly, taking no offence whatsoever; even scholars tend to cover up their errors via circumlocutory expressions and scholastic explanations.

  

May Dr. Pejathaya, a poet as well as a scholar, be blessed by Muse even more! And may he pen longer poems on noble themes that would be cherished for long!
