Dear Paturiji,

I am extremely thankful to you for the detailed explanation about the metre which served my purpose. Reading/reciting the poem two times could help me comprehend. My respects to the poet Dr Ramakrishna and yourself.

  

My sincere thanks to Prof Madhav Deshpande also whose post helped me recollect the poem "कषायपेय-पात्र-पतित-मक्षिकेप्रत" by PKAtre and understand this poem also. The first stanza in it, is, interestingly in Sanskrit:

  

"हा हन्त हन्त नलिनीं गजमुज्जहार !

अयि नरांगमलशोणित भक्षिके

जनुविनाशकजन्तुसुरक्षिके

अपरिक्षितहारक  तक्षिके

क्या हुआ अफ़सोस मक्षिके !"

Prof Deshpande may correct me for any error. Thanks again.
