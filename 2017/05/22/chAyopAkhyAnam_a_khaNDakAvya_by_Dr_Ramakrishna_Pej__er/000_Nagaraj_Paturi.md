I received a juicy Sanskrit poem by Dr Ramakrishna Pejathaya of Chinmaya Vishwa Vidyapeeth from the poet himself.He is an avadhaani in Sanskrit, with a sweet flow of mellifluous poetic composition in Sanskrit. For me all these are examples of vibrant modern day LIFE of Sanskrit: (Hope emphasis on LIFE is self-explanatory to at least those who are aware of the contemporary discussions.

  

Sharing it for the relish of the sahridayas.
