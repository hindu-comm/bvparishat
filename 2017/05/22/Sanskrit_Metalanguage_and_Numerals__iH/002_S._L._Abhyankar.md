Indian sages have been smart to also use names of entities to denote numerals or to codify the numerals. One example is of the भास्कराचार्य-'s introductory verse to his सिद्धान्तशिरोमणी

  

The verse declares his date of birth and his age when he composed सिद्धान्तशिरोमणी

रसगुणपूर्णमहीसम-शकनृपसमयेऽभवन्ममोत्पत्तिः \|

रसगुणवर्षेण मया सिद्धान्तशिरोमणी रचितः \|\|

Note, here रस = 6 (कटु, आम्ल, तिख्त, लवण, मधु,कषाय) गुण = 3 (सत्त्व, रजस्, तमस्) पूर्ण = 0 मही = 1, Note also अङ्कानां वामतो गतिः He was born in the year 1036 of Shalivahan Shaka (i.e. AD 1114) and composedसिद्धान्तशिरोमणी when he was 36 (in AD 1150).
