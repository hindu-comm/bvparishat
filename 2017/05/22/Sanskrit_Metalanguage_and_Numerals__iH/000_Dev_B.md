Dear Dr. Deshpande ji, Mishra-ji, Korada-ji and reverend scholars  

  

I have been curious about numerals in Sanskrit. I believe numerals did exist in the original spoken language, but in what form? In the latter Prakrits like Devanagri, it would have manifested as true numerals, but numbers is a high level of abstraction that the original spoken Sanskrit may not have needed, (though some suggest they just used consonants as numerals but I think that is highly unlikely). Without vowels and numerals, the metalanguage should have been very simple and straightforward. Is that the reason we still struggling with inscriptions on Mohenjodaro, even Pali Scripts as with Ashoka? Aryabhata in Aryabhatia writes that his book was published 3600 years after the start of Kali Yuga – that’s a decimal number system. But decimals were just beginning to be used by Aryabhata (or rather Brahmagupta, who actually introduced it), how did Aryabhata arrive at the 3600 years number, rather what defined ‘the year’ prior to a decimal system – 370 odd lunar days or 360 solar-lunar days? These numbers are still ‘countable’, but 3600 is rather big representation in a non decimal system. Afraid, it is a rather long email, but just curious. I would love to know what your thoughts are on this? I have never been able to figure this out.

  

  

Best regards,

  

Dev
