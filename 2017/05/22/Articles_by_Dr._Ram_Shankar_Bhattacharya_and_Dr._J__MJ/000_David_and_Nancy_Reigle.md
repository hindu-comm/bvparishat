Dear Scholars,  
  

After this topic came up in a thread started by Prof. Kannan, I have had several requests for these articles. So I sought Prof. Paturi's advice, and he has allowed me to start a new thread here regarding them. Here is a link to scans of all of the articles I have collected by Dr. Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, including four by his wife Dr. Jyotirmoyee Bhattacharya on similar topics. All 67 of them can be downloaded with a single click of the top link at the following page, or they can be downloaded individually:

I am not aware of a published bibliography of Dr. Ram Shankar Bhattacharya's writings. He edited a number of Sanskrit texts, and he wrote many valuable articles. Here follows a bibliographic listing of only the articles by him and his wife that I have scanned.

  

Best regards,
