Generally instances of inadequacy, failure or general suffering are all explained as due to past sins - svayamkritam. In the case of heroes or other mahaapurushas, they are a test (like hariScandra). In either case, it seems that self-compassion is not compatible with Karma siddhanta; then, all self-compassion has to be superficial or rhetorical, if Karma theory is held to be valid.
