No doubt, there are many rituals mentioned in ancient texts that are hard and even harsh. But bye and large in Bhakti literature I find plenty of instances where the concept of 'self-compassion' is present directly or indirectly. This is a quality and not just an action such as भगवति निवेदनम् or even नैच्यानुसन्धानम् \|\| I do not know whether Bhakti sutras discuss this quality of a bhakta directly as स्वानुकम्पा but when Acharya Yaamuna prays, he is patiently expecting the grace to descend notwithstanding his limitations which he has already stated. Texts may not academically describe this but when in the Bhagavadgita I read  

  

*maatraasparshaastu kaunteya sheetoshnasukhaduhkadaaha \|*  
*aagamaapaayinoonityaastaanstitikshasva bhaarata \|\| 14 \|\|*

*  
*

*Krishna is advising one to develop titikshaa,... In my personal opinion it is very near to what you wrote:*इदं दोषाचरणं स्वाभाविकं अतः चिन्ता न कार्या,but of course all efforts are to be done so that अग्रे इत्थं न कर्तव्यम्.... ..as in the beautiful Nyaasadas'akam: ...न प्रवर्तय पापानि प्रवृत्तानि निवर्तय ......अनुचितचरितेषु अद्यशान्ताभिसन्धिः .....etc

शरणागतिः स्वानुकम्पासहिताइति मे मतिः\| किन्तु शास्त्ररीत्या मम अभिप्रायःस्वीक्रियतेवा नवाइति न जाने\|\|

Scholars of Srivashnavism with in depth knowledge of the texts may be able to comment. I am just a free lancer.

In many of the songs of saints (naturally in their lives) self-compassion is present in abundance. Kanakadaasa has a song which runs like

tallaNisadiru kaNDya taaLu manave...(ತಲ್ಲಣಿಸದಿರು ಕಂಡ್ಯ ತಾಳು ಮನವೇ ...)

He is soothing his own self by referring to other difficult situations..... how even birds and animals are protected..even the frog in the crevice gets its food....(he is not worse than others) ....his mind should not get perturbed.

Thanks
