Karma 'Siddhaanta' seems to be a neologism.

  

Is there an ancient/premodern traditional usage of the compound karmasiddhaanta?

  

The word and the concept 'karma' is nevertheless significant in Vedic and Dharmic traditions. But karmasiddhaanta seems to be a modern coinage to translate the English word 'Karma theory' floating during modern times.

  

karma concept when used in the sense of all beings are bound by the karmaphalas, they can not escape from it, appears to be fatalistic, biased towards daiva, not purushakaara.

  

When used to 'explain' the present misery or prosperity of a being, it appears to be statusquoist and an obstacle to progress and change.

  

These are the reasons for the notoriety of the so called karmasiddhaanta.

  

When viewed as a concept of discouraging beings from the present paapakarmas and encouraging them for present puNyakarmas , it appears to be an action-inspiring concept, pro-progress, pro-change concept.

  

Present puNyakarmas require compassion.

  

Thus compassion is compatible with karmasiddhaanta when viewed as a concept of discouraging beings from the present paapakarmas and encouraging them for present puNyakarmas.
