Sri Kalyan

  

The compassion of ISvara towards bhaktas, guru towards students etc. is not rhetorical or superficial. Even amongst equals, helping some other person or creature in difficulties is out of compassion - such compassion, then, is not rhetorical.

  

I cannot ignore my studies and then feel sorry for myself for failing in an exam. Thus it is only self-compassion which is not compatible with Indian thought systems - with the exception of lokaayata and such.
