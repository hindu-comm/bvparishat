Shri Prasad varya!

  

Dhanyavaadah.

  

Here again in the case of Hanuman we see - one should not allow his enthusiasm and hope to drain away. this seems to be the take away from the verses. What I am looking for is - in the face of failure or a mistake - forgiving oneself and not punishing oneself as a first step towards gradual correction or coming to terms with failure etc.
