Respected Members

  

I was wondering whether Vedic and Sanskrit texts have ideas on Self-compassion.

  

Self Compassion is described as -extending[compassion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion "Compassion")to one's self in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general[suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering "Suffering").

  

Most western talks on various stress related issues present self-compassion as an important factor to soothe oneself.

  

Do we have instances of self-compassion in Vedic and Sanskrit texts? Is it not true that mostly in Vedic and Sanskrit texts we find more of Self-mortification - punishing oneself - purifying oneself, disciplining oneself etc - Eg. Yama, Niyama etc of yoga and such other practices rather than Self-compassion.(I may be corrected if I am wrong on this)

  

I request the enlightened members to share references and instances, if any, from Sanskrit and Vedic sources with regard to Self-compassion.

  

  

regards

Jayaraman
