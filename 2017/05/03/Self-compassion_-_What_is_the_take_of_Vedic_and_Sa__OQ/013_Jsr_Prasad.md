Sri Jayarama mahodaya,  
  

I understand your views!  
  
(*anirveda* is the forgiving criteria devised by Hanuman ji having dejected due to his failure in finding Sita maa. Before, even he wanted to commit aatma-tyaaga for such a failure. Because, revealing his failure eventually may lead to the destruction of Raghu dynasty. So, his words may not convey directly what you are looking for, but still have a significance for gradual correction to achieve success.)  
  

In that case you may also look for some sort of the following?  
  

उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत् ।  

अात्मैवह्यात्मनो बन्धुः आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो रिपुः ।।B.G. 5.6  
  

One may have to look at the inspiring characters of purANas too, for instances of स्वामुकम्पा, स्वात्मोद्धार etc.  
  

Prasad
