Vidvā́ṃsas,  
  
Here is my confusion:  
  
the word yāsīṣṭa ( RV 1.165.15c éṣā́ yāsīṣṭa tanvè vayā́ṃ) looks like  
  
aorist active (luṅ parasmaipade) injunctive 2nd plural form of dhātu yā  
  
but all translations I've seen treat it as 3rd sing.  
  
Could it be, without going against grammar, 3rd. singular ātmanepade ?  
  
Thanks in advance,  
 Dmitri.
