In practice, the letters related to the stars are given in pancanga used and these are the natal star letters in naming the child to be contained in the names. This was the practice in our region. I did not know the authentic source nor yoga or Sanskrit at that time. I don't know whether the practice was unbased, but the practice was there during namakarana rituals.
