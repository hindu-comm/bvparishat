Namaste

  

\< my name> - reg:

The given name (= vyavahara naama) on records does not/ need not match any requirement here. Certainly not the signature line or mail ID!

  

The secret names are personal for meditation use and not disclosed ; it does carry a compliance.

  

This rule base for naming in accordance with the nakshatra- guidance is a family tradition; observed in some families in the current period. Media hype is too much on a fringe issue.

  

Where actually this guidance is to be strictly complied with is, mantra initiation for worship. There is no clarity on this topic related in current yoga-meditation practices: either in home land Bharath or beyond! Whether a guru uses it or a learner provides necessary detail!
