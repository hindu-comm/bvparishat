My personal understanding of the Naama-nakshatra as I have heard from astrologers of the previous generation (100 years BP) is as follows: Naama-nakshatra is a notional (perhaps based on data) approach for identifying the probable natal star from the given name, for people who do not know their date of birth and hence can not tell the astrologer their janma-nakshatra. This was used by some astrologers in mind reading, for guessing the question of the client. Now, the converse of naming based on the tables given in the traditional almanacs is followed by some. The curious feature of the table is the vowels are concentrated near Krttika and not Ashwini.

Thanks
