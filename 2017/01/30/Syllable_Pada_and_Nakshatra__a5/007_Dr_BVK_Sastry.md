Namaste

From vedanga-jyotisha perspective linked to brihaddevataa which advocates how to use veda-mantra/ pada/ varna in yajna:



1. Every nakshatra has a devataa.

2. Every devataa has a vedic term with an associated varna-aksara ( called Praa-akshara: aksha is the axis around which the ra- the light, the fire, the energy revolves.

3. Every given name in Jaataka related has a janma-nakshatra:: birth star which is used to make a reckoning of ' nakshatra-vyooha mandala' on shareera. This is one of the jyotisha techniques where the body parts and nakshatras are mapped uniquely for each person.



In this context, the nakshatra related first sound( varna) is significant from mantrashaastra point. It may not be so much used in vyavahara(- worldly use) or even abused.

One needs to focus in such cases on design of system and find the utility.



These are simple corollaries of yoga way of learning- using Samskrutham; to consider that as mumbo jumbo and pushing it to tribal thought - practice and mind- reading is not fair.

Cosmic laws behind the practices such as this should not be trivialized.
