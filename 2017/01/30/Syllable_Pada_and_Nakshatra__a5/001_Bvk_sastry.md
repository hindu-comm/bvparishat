Namaste

  

Given the tradition of Five names for a child coming as a part of the ' nAma-karaNa'- samskara ;

  

Given the importance of individuals name to resonate with individuals body constitution ( i.e naama-pada prakruti to resonate with Shareera- prakruti ( for Ayurveda and Mantra shaastra needs, with Universal cosmic sounds - vishwa Prakruti);

  

The ' vaidika Dharma Shaastra/ vedanga jyotisha sampradaya recommends the. Ame be resonant with the sounds related to Nakshatra- varna-Akshara.;

  

  

This much for reason part.

  

How the rushis discovered/ visioned it - is the Yoga part. This is First known source, as visioned through vedas. The knowledge acquisition mode is Yoga. The practical utility is called vyakti-samjnA- karana:: giving a name proper to the child, which brings out tbe full inner potential and help achieve the goals set as ' become and be a yogi / a rushi'.

  

How this knowledge has deteriorated in practice to become a mechanized model for name selection by fancy / name change at will through a sworn affidavit / a ploy of some gurus to use as mantra-deeksha- initiation with premium charges and mystic benefit promised- is a derailed history of a knowledge discipline ( called Yoga- Samskrutham / vak- yoga).

  

When Samskrutham was remodeled for study as a historic tribal language
in colonial frame work and / language of God who gave scripture to chosen people - using Latin/ Greek / Araimic/ hebrew / Arabic language models, the vedic science of language- sounds from Nirukta (- applied through Jyotisha) went out of circulation!

  

Can this knowledge be revived for current society benefit? Surely!

It calls for a revisit of Samskruth language modeling used in current period and bring in course corrections.
