I express the following curiosity just as one of the list members of BVP:



Prof. Kannan says in his post that



"It gives me pleasure to draw your kind attention toSwadeshi Indology Conference - 2,being held on**February 17****, 18 and 19**at New Delhi 

in collaboration with, IGNCA."



But



at<http://swadeshiindology.com/category/si-2/>



it is mentioned that : The Swadeshi Indology Conference – 2 will be held *at IGNCA* , New Delhi. Fri-Sun, 17-19 Feb 2017.



Seminars and conferences announcement page of IGNCA<http://ignca.nic.in/csw_body.htm>



does not mention this conference.Is IGNCA providing venue or is it collaborating with the organizers of the conference? I am just curious.



Thank you for clarifying

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
