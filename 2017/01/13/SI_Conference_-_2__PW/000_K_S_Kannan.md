Dear All,  
  

It gives me pleasure to draw your kind attention to

Swadeshi Indology Conference - 2,

being held on **February 17, 18 and 19** at New Delhi 

in collaboration with, IGNCA.

  

Among the leading participants are  
Dr.Lokesh Chandra  

Dr.Nagaswamy

Dr.KAravinda Rao

Dr.Pappu Venugopala Rao

Dr.RGanesh and

Dr.Subrahmanya Korada

  

The full schedule will be ready in about a week and will be put up on the website.  

  

As there is a very high demand from people all over the country to attend the conference, 50 seats have been reserved (on grounds of the capacity of the auditorium) for interested parties to attend - on a first-come-first-served basis (and half are already filled).

  

Those who are interested to attend have to fill the forms available at the SI Website and register:
