The last two sentences, forming the kernel of the charming and vital passage so well selected by Dr Bhat, may be rendered \[explanatorily\] thus:  
  
That \[faculty\] is *ahaṅkāra* (ego ) where, the Internal Instrument (*antaḥ*-*karaṇa*), styling itself as I, lets the objects \[of the sense organs\] be known.  
\[And in contrast,\] that is *asmitā* (being the \[true\] I) where, \[little else than\] just Being (*sattā*-*mātra*) looms when the mind \[itself\] dissolves into *prakṛti* (Primordial Nature) owing to the \[involutory\] modification, as a consequence of its (= mind's)being turned inwards.
