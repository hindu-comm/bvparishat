Respected Shri Dogra ji,

  

Thank you very much for your kind feedback. However, my attempt is to understand and make sense of the position taken by the traditional exegetes of the text.

  

The emotional attachment to the sense of being is known as अभिनिवेश. अहंकार is simply the feeling of “I am”. It is at this stage that notions of ego and individuality come into play. This is the inner tool which creates the sense of “I” in the body-sense-mind apparatus and provides an inner center, inner reference point, even if illusionary, to all thoughts, words and deeds – कार्यकरणसंघात आत्मप्रत्ययोऽहंकारः (गीता शांकर भाष्य ३.२७). It is originally a सांख्य concept while the अस्मिता is a योग concept.

  

I appreciate your comment on अस्मिता being or not being a क्लेश depending on whether it facilitates or hinders ध्यान. However, if one follows the traditional explanation, the difference is far greater than that. The अस्मिता of 1.17 is a form of knowledge or realization (संवित्) while that of the 2.3,6 is a form of misconception (विपर्यय) or an evolute of ignorance (अविद्या). I can’t see how they can be the same in any possible way.

  

Also, the explanation of the first two objects of संप्रज्ञात समाधि doesn’t match that of the traditional commentators according to which वितर्क simply stands for the realization based on a gross object (स्थूल विषय) while विचार that on a subtle object (सूक्ष्म विषय).

  

Please enlighten me if you think otherwise. Thank you.****
