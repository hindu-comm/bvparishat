Most revered scholars,

In the Yoga Sutras, Sage Patanjali, speaks of अस्मिता, I-am-ness, which he explains as the apparent unification (एकात्मता/संयोग) of the seer (दृक्शक्ति/द्रष्टृ) and the seen (दृश्य) – दृग्दर्शनशक्त्योरेकात्मतेवास्मिता (YS 2.6). On the other hand, अहंकार, the sense of I, also one among the 25 Tattvas accepted in Yoga, is an इन्द्रिय/अन्तःकरण and hence part of the seen (दृश्य), as explained in the Bhashya and Vartika of YS 2.18. Therefore, so it clearly seems that अहंकार and अस्मिता are separate entities.

  

But then why do some scholars think that both are one and the same? This seems to be implied by statements such as अस्मिताप्रभवाणीन्द्रियाणि (तत्त्ववैशारदी YS 1.17).

  

Also the yogic idea of अस्मिता becomes more confusing because while the Sage mentions अस्मिता in the 2^(nd) पाद as the second of the five क्लेशs (fundamental causes of suffering), he also mentions it as a component of the fourth, and therefore the most advanced, state of संप्रज्ञात समाधि (see YS 1.17). In the context of संप्रज्ञात समाधि, अस्मिता is explained in the Bhashya as “realization which has only आत्मन् as its object” (एकात्मिका संवित्). How can this be the same as the अस्मिता of the क्लेशs?

  

Therefore, is it correct to conclude that अहंकार and अस्मिता are separate entities and that there are two mutually exclusive types of अस्मिताs mentioned in the Yoga Sutras? What are the thoughts of revered scholars in this forum? Thank you.

Humble pranams,  

Siddhartha
