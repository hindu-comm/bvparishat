Dear scholars,

  

Lately I am studying the Vedas with a group here. My understanding ofअस्मिता is coming through the Vedic thinking.

i am sharing as a student. 

अस्मिता isअसत् , it is non-existent. When the individual feels his/her existence, that state is labeled अस्मिता. But the

state has no reality. 

अहंकार on the other hand is real and is a manifested state. It is a function of the जात. It is an object identity, it separates

the object from other objects.

The first step of achievingयोग is the elimination ofअहंकार. This is the assertion thatयोग is possible and that one can

try to achieve. But the thinking that one is trying isअस्मिता, since the object itself does not exist. चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः

restrains the mind, but mind would remain सबीजः. सबीजः is attained with the elimination ofअहंकार.

But then the statementतुछ्येनाभ्यपीहितं would be a state. I don't think the state has any realizable experience,

since there is no instrument to experience. Hence it is a poetic inference. 

  

This is an interpretation mapping the योगसूत्रम् toनासदीयसूक्तम् .

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
