Siddhartha Ji,  

 While, as I said above, I would like to go deeper into the texts and the commentaries in the weeks and months to come and would like to have a discussion with you on a more scholarly level, let me share with you my present understanding of the Yog Sutras.  
  

I believe that the practices in the Yog Sutras are akin to hypnosis, with the difference that the focus of consciousness in the Sutras has to be on specific bundles of neurons called chakras. This is what the Maharishi calls देशबन्धः  
  

Other than this, the four elements for focusing, in my understanding of things, namely वितर्कविचारानन्दास्मिता are the same in samadhi as well in hypnosis.  
  

I believe that the hypnotherapy of the present day employs the same techniques that are given in the Yog Sutras. I also believe that hypnotherapy can be further fine-tuned by attaining a deeper use of the techniques given in the Yog Sutras. This is what I have been trying these days with some people in the company for which I now work as a Security and HR Advisor after my retirement from police.  
  

I say all this to make my association with scholars like you more fruitful so that we might all work together to bring out the full knowledge of our ancient texts.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
