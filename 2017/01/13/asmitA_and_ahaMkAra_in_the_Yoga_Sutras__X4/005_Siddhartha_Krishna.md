My understanding of hypnosis and hypnotherapy is presently too limited to draw any significant comparisons between those fields of psychology and Yoga Darshana. I had read about hypnosis a while ago as part of my interest in Psychology. However, the only interesting idea that I remember to have come across then was that of the Hidden Observer, presented as a theory by the US Psychologist Ernest Hilgard. I see Yoga as a disciplineof personality development and as a method to explore the inner world of consciousness, culminating in the awareness of the witnessing essence, the mystery of all mysteries. In any case, this is something separate from our main subject of discussion. But thank you very much for your time and effort to respond to my quarry. Humble pranams.
