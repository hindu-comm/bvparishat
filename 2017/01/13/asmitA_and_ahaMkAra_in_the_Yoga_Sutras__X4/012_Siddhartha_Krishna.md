Thank you. This statement of Bhojara is in the context of the Asmita as stated in the contexts of Samadhi in YS 1.17. It is very clear how this Asmita is very different from Ahamkara, as stated by me in the earlier posts also. However, my original question was in regard to the Asmita which has been mentioned as part of the Kleshas in YS 2.3 and 6. I am confused as to whether that Asmita and Ahamkara are the same or different. Vacaspati Mishra seems to imply that they are same, but the problem in accepting his position lies in the fact that Ahamkara has been treated as Drishya and Asmita has been defined as the supposed union of the Drik and the Drishya. Obvious, the imagined unification of the seer and seen cannot be the same as the seen? How to resolve this issue?
