Siddhartha ji,  

 I must confess that I am more a practitioner of samadhi than a scholar. Long ago, when I began to get confused while trying to understand various concepts, I struggled and finally related the teachings in the Yog Sutras to neural activity of the brain. The pieces fitted together and gave me practices that have benefited me tremendously.  
  

I admire your great scholarship and your minute study of the texts for which I am no match. But your great command, your sincerity and your dedication inspires me to go deeper. into the subject So, I would hopefully take a few months to go deeper into these definitions and try to understand them with the subtleties with which you are making an attempt to understand them.  
  

So, let me hope that I resume from here after six months.  
  

Hopefully.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
