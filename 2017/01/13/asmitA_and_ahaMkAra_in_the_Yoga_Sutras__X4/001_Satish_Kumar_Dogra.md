Shri Siddhartha,  

 Let me share my views:  
  

The purpose of samadhi is चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः where we may roughly equate
  
चित्तवृत्ति with the stream of consciousness.  
  

In संप्रज्ञात समाधि you achieve this halting of the stream of consciouness by focusing your attention on something, so that your focus on that something bringts the stream of consciousness to a halt.  
  

The question is what should you focus on?  
  

You can focus on any of these four:  
  
वितर्कविचारानन्दास्मिता  
  

That is to say,  
  

1. Some sequence of logic  

2. An idea  

3. A feeling of joy  

4. One's sense of being.  
  

In my opinion, अस्मिता would be just the sense of being oneself, while अहंकार is the emotional attachment to that sense of being.  
  

Whether अस्मिता is a क्लेशः would depend upon whether it facilitates your stopping your stream of consciousness or hinders it. The difference would lie in your use of it rather than in the thing itself.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai
