I see Yoga as a disciplineof personality development and as a method to explore the inner world of consciousness, culminating in the awareness of the witnessing essence, the mystery of all mysteries.  
  

Siddhartha Ji,  

 I believe that the Yog Sutras straddles across psychology and spirituality. It connects the mind and the soul. It provides the link between the world of senses and the world that lies beyond the senses.  
  

If we could some day understand the Yog Sutras in its entirety, we would know much beyond what science has revealed so far. One finds modern science moving closer to Vedanta. Which encourages one to believe that the rediscovery of the meaning of our ancient texts might reveal truths unknown to science.  
  

People like you and me and others on this Forum must strive in that direction.  
  

Thanks for the interaction. I must repeat that I feel deeply impressed by your scholarship.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
