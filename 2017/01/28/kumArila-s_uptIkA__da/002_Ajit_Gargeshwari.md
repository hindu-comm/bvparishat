To my knowledge GOS have published Ganganath Jha's translations of
Kumārila's Ślokavārttika and Tantravārttika and not Kumārila's Ṭupṭīkā

Dear Madhav,  
I got a copy of the same, but I cannot use it. The GOS publications were made with brittle papers that cannot be used for long

Dear Colleagues,



  I have access to Ganganath Jha's translations of Kumārila's Ślokavārttika and Tantravārttika. Kumārila's Ṭupṭīkā comments on Jaimini's Mīmāṃsāsūtras beginning with the 4th Adhyāya to the end, but I have not seen Jha's translation of this commentary. Was such a translation ever published by Jha? Any info would be useful to me.
Thanks.
