Dear Colleagues,

  

  I have access to Ganganath Jha's translations of Kumārila's Ślokavārttika and Tantravārttika. Kumārila's Ṭupṭīkā comments on Jaimini's Mīmāṃsāsūtras beginning with the 4th Adhyāya to the end, but I have not seen Jha's translation of this commentary. Was such a translation ever published by Jha? Any info would be useful to me.
Thanks.
