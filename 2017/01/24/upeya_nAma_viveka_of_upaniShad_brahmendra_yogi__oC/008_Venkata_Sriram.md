Vidyaji,

  

I made a cursory glance. Tears of joys rolled down my eyes. Such a wonderful work on nAma-siddhAnta by Upanishad Yogi. I think the great musician and vaaggeyakara Tyagabrahman too was influenced by this work and composed kritis like "raama bhakti saamraajyam....", "telisi raama chintana..." etc. The bija "ra" of ashtakshari mantra and the bija "ma" of panchakshari mantra, which form the life force of two - when both combined together becomes 'raama". The explanation was beautifully brought up by Upanishad Brahmendra Yogi and this aspect was taken by Satguru Tyagaraja in his kirtana while extolling the raama naama. 

  

One should visit the mutt which is in kanchipuram called "upanishad brahmendra mutt". The upAsya murties (raamachandra and sita) once worshipped by Upanishad Yogi are still intact in the mutt. The speciality is that bhagavan ramachandra sports with shikha & yajnopavita and shines like a rAja-rishi. There is also a rAma-yantra inscribed on a shaalagraama shila. 

  

Once again my pranaams to you for sharing a beautiful work.

  

regs,

sriram
