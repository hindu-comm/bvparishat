**THREE DAY INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN CHENNAI,** **23 -25 February 2017**

**First Announcement**

**Theme of the Conference - Celebrating Diversity--Actionable Values for Management and Leadership in India**

Theme note:



**DAY 1--Dharma based management and Leadership for Emerging India:** Lessons from Mahabharata, Panchatantra and Arthasastra. The three pillars of Dharma are collective well being ( prabhava), Sustainability ( dharana) and inclusion ( ahimsa). The first day session will explore the value and relevance of these three values in the creation of an authentic management narrative for India.



***DAY 2***--**Management and Leadership challenges of Modern India**: India is struggling to become a middle income superpower and a welfare state. Our challenge is not lack of resources or ideas, but is that of imaginary leadership and committed management. This session will explore the ideal of an Indian management theory and practice based on democratic values, individual freedom , public-private-community partnership and market competition.Quality circles, zero defect products, Kaishan -- all Japanese ideas; The hire and fire practices of American business; and the welfare economics of Europe can be highlighted and compared with practices in India





***DAY 3***—**DIVERSITY AN ASSET AND A RESOURCE :**India is a country of unbelievable diversity. Even families and communities, let alone multinational corporations, are becoming increasingly diverse and multicultural. This could be an asset or a defect dependinghow we leverage on it. Diversity could be a great asset and resource for building effective teams for management and leadership excellence. In this aspect India can lead the world by creating an effective leadership and management narrative. **Leaders of different religions and differing philosophies and ideologies can address this challenge of diversity for leadership** excellence. This session becomes supremely important at a time of irreconcilable communal and linguistic and ideological divide in India.
