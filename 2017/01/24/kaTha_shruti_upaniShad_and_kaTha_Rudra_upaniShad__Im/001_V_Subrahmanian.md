Olivelle in his book 'Samnyāsa Upaniṣads: Hindu scriptures on Renunciation....' says on p.8:

  

//Some of the later Upaniṣads appear to be expansions of older ones. Others, such as the Laghu-Samnyāsa and the Kuṇḍikā, as well as the Kaṭhaśruti and the Kaṭharudra (which occurs only in SR - Southern Recension), appear to be different recensions of the same text.//

  

The text of the Kaṭharudropaniṣat is available as part of 108 Upanishads.

  

The translation of the Kathaśrutyupaniṣat is available as part of the above mentioned book of Olivelle.

  

There is a 'Kaṇṭhaśrutyupaniṣad' which is available with a 'dīpikā' of 'Nārāyaṇa in a book:

  

  
[Atharvana Upanishads with Commentary of Narayana – Ramamaya Tarkaratna 1872](https://archive.org/download/Bibliotheca_Indica_Series/AtharvanaUpanishadsWithCommentaryOfNarayana-RamamayaTarkaratna1872bis.pdf)  
  

Upanishad No #19 (upanishad list on page 7)  

Page no 289.  

  

The text of the above upaniṣad closely tallies with the translation by Peter Olivelle. However, the text appears to abruptly terminate. On comparison, the Kaṭharudropaniṣat is longer.
