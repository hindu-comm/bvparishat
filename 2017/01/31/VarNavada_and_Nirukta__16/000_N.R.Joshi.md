Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Now it is clear that there is no VarNavaada or Sphotavaada in Nirukta of Yaaska. One cansay Shabda-nityatva may have seeds of this debate. That is OK with me.



I am puzzled. Why so many ancient aachaaryas supported VarNavaada?



In the book of Prof Korada (Theory of Languages) from p 82 to 85, there is good review of who were supporters of VarNavada and who were for Sphotavaada?



I am thinking that there might be second stream of VarNavaada flowing in the etymology of Sanskrit words in the ancient time before Panini and Yaaska. But I have no proof. Thanks. NRJOSHI
