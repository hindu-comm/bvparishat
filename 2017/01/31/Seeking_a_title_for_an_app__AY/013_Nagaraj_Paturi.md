                =========================Moderator's note ================================

  

I thank the member who alerted me about this oversight of mine in not checking whether the app being discussed in this thread was a commercial one or not.

  

The alerting member reminded me that on a similar previous occasion Prof. Aklujkar suggested that the members seeking such help must make it clear whether the request to the scholars is being made in behalf of a commercial venture or non-commercial venture.

  

Aayushmatee Anupama may clarify the same regarding the request initiating the present thread.

  

In future such requests shall be monitored more carefully.

  

All members making such requests may, in the beginning itself may clarify regarding commercial or non-commercial nature of the activity in behalf of which the request is being made.

  

Requests made with the intention of getting free help from the members of the list for a commercial venture shall be considered in violation of the norms of the list.

  

Thanks for your understanding.
