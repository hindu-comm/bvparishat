Namaste,  
  

All highlighted words in red, are of a great concern. Surprised to see article categories, uder 'key topics' attributed to the review. I agree Prof. Sastry ji, discovery of new texts does not mean new vocabulary is created, all of a sudden. You tried to to vocalize these responses on several other occasions, exclusively wrt lexicons. Yes, scope of digital media need not be elevated to the प्रभुसम्मिता status.
