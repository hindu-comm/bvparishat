Namaste



On the observation \< shallow review \> appearing in
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/595270> ; it is a ‘ mild note’.



The real force of the review is in listing that appears in the
‘Additional and Specific Terms’ coming as a part of the review ! 

I am attaching the article along with my observations on side-notes (as a pdf) . I do not know how the ‘upload’ of attachment works in the Google groups here. And I request the concerned to do the needful. (The observations below will be meaningful only in relation to the attachment).



Here are some things that need a detailed and specific review investigation on the ‘ Lexicon Enhancement’ of Apte made in the fourth edition !



And my pointers for the scholars to review, very specifically using the lens of ‘ Lexicographers Privilege and Errors’:



A) The first edition of Apte’s practical dictionary listing and later ‘ discovery / surfacing of manuscripts’ does not mean that the society was unaware of these additional word-listings and usage. In fact, as most of the ‘ home- team scholars, educated in the native mode, even when they did not have any ‘ awareness – access =teaching of several of these texts’ ! Example: The non availability of ‘Artha Shastra’ text ( as a manuscript / printed book till 1915.. ) did not mean that Samskruth scholars were totally, blissfully, oblivious and ignorant of the Kautilya niti, the arthashastra-technical vocabulary and absolutely failed to enjoy Bana’s literature or Panchatantra or Ramayana /Mahabharaa where the artha shastra terms are frequently used . Nor does it mean that ‘ manuscript based shastra studies was not there’ !



B) The multivalent and technical domain specific meaning of the Samskruth terms was well known to the text users and practitioners ! The meaning of the terms in ‘Tantra’ works were not ported in any literal sense from the ‘ Kama-Shaastra’ or the ‘ Kavya Shastra’ by any sensible writer; nor the meanings were pooled and listed in any ‘ one book- as a common resource’ . Example : the word ‘ mano-hari’ ( listed on page 63 of the review), does not communicate the meaning of ‘ unfaithful woman, prostitute’ to any ‘ common reader of Samskruth Kavya’ or a ‘Sahrudaya’ ! Such meaning presentation would surely need the lexicographer to catch the meaning resonance of N-th order from the primary term(‘ anuranita dhvani’) and list it in a ‘ Practical Dictionary’ ?! Is there any Samskruth school anywhere in India where the word ‘ maa-tRu’ is taught to mean ‘ mother of a prostitute, a procures’ ? The technical Tantra term ‘ mAtrukA’ to mean ‘ ‘ mother of a prostitute, a procures’ ?



It is in this context, there is a need not only to review the ‘ lexicon, the subsequent revised and enhanced editions of the lexicon’, but also the ‘ reviews of the lexicons for their accuracy and alignment with the language standards, tradition and usage.



True Samskruth vocabulary has expanded, but the ‘ pedagogy of decoding the Samskruth term has not deviated from the guidelines given by Panini ! And the ‘ paribhashaa’ convention in each discipline.



If the trend of Samskruth term interpretation remains ‘ un-reviewed, unattended, allowed to proliferate in digital media for its inaccuracies’ for decades, if not centuries , the outcome certainly is disastrous: The disconnect, distortion and derogatory understanding of texts ; and then one starts a call for Battle :Sanskrit –

Have we to recall the subhahsita : ‘ na koopa-khananam yuktam ..’



Look forward for scholars response-review on the above points pl.

BVK Sastry
