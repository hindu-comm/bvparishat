1\. S'vetaas'vatara Upanishad's use of Bhagavat /bhagavaan (3.11) can not be said to be influenced/inspired by Buddhism (Date given 5th Century BC., by which time references to Buddha as Bhagavaan had not acquired prominence. )

  

2\. S'vetaas'vatara Upanishad in most of the early mantras and the mantras previous to this one discusses Brahman only.

  

3\. Buddhist usage of Bhagavaan in reference to Buddha, to begin with could have been just a respectful word in reference to a venerable personality as in the plays of Bhaasa.
