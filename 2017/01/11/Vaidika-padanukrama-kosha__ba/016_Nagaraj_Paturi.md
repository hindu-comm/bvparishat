The RG Bhandarkar article suggests that the term Bhaagavata itself as a description of the spiritual affiliation of a person, particularly in reference to a Vaishnava affiliation,as found in inscriptions, involving even Greeks, is as old as 300 BC. The term Bhagavat as a root of this in this sense, should be much older.
