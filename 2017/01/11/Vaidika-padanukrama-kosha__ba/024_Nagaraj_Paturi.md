Thanks Prof. Dehpande, for seconding my line of thinking in this regard. More technically, 'bhagavat' that can lead and did lead to 'bhaagavata' must be considered to be belonging to a different cultural and semantic complex than the 'bhagavat' that did not lead to bhaagavata because of its cultural convention does not allow such a formation.
