It just occured to me.

  

Bhagavat>Bhaagavata is typically Vedic/Pauranic/Aagamic and not Buddhist isn't it?

  

Bhagavat remains just as Bhagavaan Buddha or Bhagavaan Mahavira and in neither of these two traditions, there is the word/concept Bhaagavata.

  

Doesn't it show a distinct trajectory for the development of the word/concept of Bhaagavata in Vedic/Pauranic/Aagamic, independent of the Buddhist /Jain traditions?
