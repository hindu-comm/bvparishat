If by the principle Upanishads, we understand the 10 Principle Upanishads, then I could not trace a single usage of Bhagavat in the sense of Ishvara or Brahman in them. It is always used as a respectful way of addressing one’s master or other scholars. I would love to be corrected by the esteemed scholars of this forum.

  

Shvetasvtara Upanishad 3.11 and 5.4 are most probably the first ever usage of Bhagavat in the sense of Ishvara. Gaudapadacarya’s Mandukya Karikas 4.82 and 84 seem to be using Bhagavat in the sense of Brahman. One can of course find many more similar examples in other later Upanishads.

  

Personally, I suspect that the usage of Bhagavat for a higher principle than one's master was started by the Samkhyas, the followers of Kapila, who originally might have referred to Kapila as Bhagavan only as a master, like in the Upanishads, but then later started holding him in greater esteem as the primordial supreme master (some passages quoted by Vyasa in his commentary on Yoga Darshana suggest that Ishvara was indeed identical to Kapila at least for some Samkhya tradition). Later on, the adjective was further popularized by the followers of the Buddha (who by the way was also a follower of Kapila originally). They too referred to him as Bhagavan. Finally, as someone who is certainly very much familiar with the Mahayana concept of the Dharmakaya of "Bhagavan Buddha", it was easy for Gaudapadacharya to use the word "bhagavan" for Brahman also. In the Trikaya doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, Sambhoga-kaya is more or less identical to our Ishvara and the Nirmana-Kaya to our Avataras. Due to being post-Buddhistic and heavily influenced by Samkhya, the Puranas too took up the idea finally and further popularized it to the level of popularity which it enjoys today.Please keep in mind that these are my personal hurried assumptions based on the evidence stated above which certainly requires further research before it can be established to be conclusive. But this is certainly where the evidence seems to be pointing to.
