We can also keep in mind that the term Bhagavat is routinely used
thousands of times to refer to the Buddha and Mahavira in Buddhist and Jain Canonical texts in Pali, Ardhamagadhi and Sanskrit, and it appears in Ashoka's famous Lumbini inscription "idha bhagavam jātam" (Here the Lord (Buddha) was born). Going farther back, a related address term "bhagavaḥ" is found in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad (adhīhi bhagavo brahmeti), and this is possibly cognate with an address form "bhagoḥ" listed by Pāṇini along with bhoḥ. Not found in the verses of the Bhagavadgītā, the term Bhagavat is found in Mahābhārata texts like the Viṣṇusahasranāma (imaṃ stavaṃ bhagavato viṣṇor vyāsena kīrtitam), and so we can surmise that the term entered the epic/puranic usage before the development of the Mahābhārata was complete.
