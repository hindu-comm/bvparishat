Dear Nagarajji,

  

  Your observation is correct. While the word bhagavat as an appelation of the Buddha and Mahavira is very common in those traditions, neither of these traditions labeled themselves with the term bhāgavata, as the Pāñcarātra Vaiṣṇava tradition did. Particular developments of old terms occur in specific traditions and not in others. A good example of this is the term Jina, which is used with high frequency in the older Buddhist tradition to refer to the Buddha, and continues to survive in the late Pali works produced in Sri Lanka, and yet the Buddhist tradition is not called a Jaina tradition.
