Namaste All,

  

I would like to get a reference for Swapna and it's phala description (good & bad) available in Veda & Smritis.

  

I am aware of few references which are found in Ramayana ( like trijata swapna), Mahabharatha and few nibhanda granthas like Dharma sindhu/Nirnaya Sindhu providing description on Swapna phala.

However , would like to know if the same swapna and it's phala description is explained anywhere in Veda & Smritis,heard ,Aitereya aranyaka has some reference on the same, but, could not find.

  

Would kindly request scholars to help me on the above references.

  

Regards

Ramachandra
