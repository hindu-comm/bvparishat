Dear Nityanandji,

  

  Thanks for reading the verses so carefully. Clearly the word जटी in that verse \[यो निष्काञ्चनतां गतो जटी वनचरो शुष्कं तृणं खादति ।\]is out of place as far as the meter is concerned. Should have checked each line before posting. I have read the Sītārāvaṇasaṃvādajharī some decades ago. The idea of such a banter between Ravana and Sita in part goes back to a verse that my teacher, Pt. N.N. Bhide taught us during my school days:

  

भवित्री रम्भोरु त्रिदशवदनग्लानिरधुना

स ते राम: स्थाता न मम पुरतो लक्ष्मणसख: ।

इयं यास्यत्युच्चैर्विपदमधुना वानरचमू :

लघिष्ठेदं षष्ठाक्षरपरविलोपात् पठ पुन: ।।

  

Sita is asking Ravana to repeat his words after dropping the seventh syllable \[ṣaṣṭhākṣaraparavilopa\]. Then Ravana's words change to:

  

भवित्री रम्भोरु दशवदनग्लानिरधुना

स ते राम: स्थाता मम पुरतो लक्ष्मणसख: ।

इयं यास्यत्युच्चै: पदमधुना वानरचमू :

  

This way Sita turns the tables on Ravana using his own words. I don't know the source of this verse. It could be from Sītārāvaṇasaṃvādajharī or some other similar work.
