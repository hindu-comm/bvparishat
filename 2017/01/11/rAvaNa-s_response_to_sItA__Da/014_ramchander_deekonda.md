Prof. Deshpande ji,

  

These verses are beautiful. My wife always poses similar questions regarding the valour and divinity of Sri Rama, especially about his conduct towards Sita as depicted in uttara kanda. We expect a befitting reply of Sita, through youself. I am reminded of the famous works of Urdu poet, Iqbal. He first published his "Shikwa" (complaint), later he himself provided "jawab" (answer).

  

Regards,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
