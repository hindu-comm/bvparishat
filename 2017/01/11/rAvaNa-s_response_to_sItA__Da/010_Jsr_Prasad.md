Respected Sir,  
  

Thanks for continuing the wonderful conversation between Sita and Ravana. The smarana-alankara example is simply superb, thanks to your Guru Ji! Thanks to other scholars for enlightening comments.  
  

The backdrop of the Sita-Ravana dialog presumes that Ravana was updated everything on anterior and posterior episodes of Rama's exile. For instance, you said - राज्यं यस्य गतं कुमातृवचनान्निष्कासित: स्वात्पुरात्... and यो वृक्षान्तरितो जघान बलिनं कुच्छद्मना वालिनम् etc. Can we presume that (in your imagination), mighty Hanuman is listening this conversation in disguise from the branch of Asoka.  
  

With regards,  

Prasad
