Dear Prof. Deshpade Ji  
  
Very nice, now waiting for the response to these verses. I am reminded of the work*Sītārāvaṇasaṃvādajharī*, perhaps your verses can be compiled into a similar work and published.

  

I guess जटी has been copy-pasted by mistake in यो निष्काञ्चनतां गतो वनचरो शुष्कं तृणं खादति. The reading appears to be यो निष्काञ्चनतां गतो वनचरो शुष्कं तृणं खादति to follow the metre.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
