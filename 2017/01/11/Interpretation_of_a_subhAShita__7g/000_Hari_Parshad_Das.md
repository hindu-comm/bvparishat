dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams.  
  
i wish to know if the interpretation that i've made of the following subhāṣita is correct or not. I agree there may be other interpretations, but i am seeking to validate the specific interpretation that i've made here:  
  

**Title**: Dust Dominates the Dominators

**Verse**:  
  
ये जात्या लघवः सदैव गणनां याता न ये कुत्रचित्  
पद्भ्यामेव विमर्दिताः प्रतिदिनं भूमौ निलीनाश्चिरम्  
उत्क्ष्पिताश्चपलाशयेन मरुता पश्यान्तरिक्षे सखे  
तुङ्गानामुपरिस्थितिं क्षितिभृतां कुर्वन्त्यमी पांसवः  
  
***ye jātyā laghavaḥ sadaiva gaṇanāṁ yātā na ye kutracit***  
***padbhyām eva vimarditāḥ prati-dinaṁ bhūmau nilīnāś ciram***  
***utkṣpitāś capalāśayena marutā paśyāntarikṣe sakhe***  
***tuṅgānām upari sthitiṁ kṣiti-bhṛtāṁ kurvanty amī pāṁsavaḥ***  

  
**Translation**: They're considered to be lowly; they're never counted as important anywhere in the world. Moreover, they're regularly crushed under the feet of everyone and are constantly pushed down towards the earth.  
  
Still my friend, just see how these particles of dust are carried upward by the unsteady wind. Finally these particles of dust acquire their rightful position over \[the tombs and memorials of\] the kings and rulers of the past.
