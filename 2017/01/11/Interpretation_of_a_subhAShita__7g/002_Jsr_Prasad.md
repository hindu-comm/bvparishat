Namaste Hari Parshad Das ji,  
  

It is a nice verse, indeed! Thanks for bringing it to the attention of Parishat. Your interpretation reflected through the inserted image is well appreciated. It is also refreshing to see a scholar like Prof. Surendra Mohan Mishra Ji refining the translation and expressing his comment in verse form.  

  

Best regards,

Prasad
