Dear Sri Hariprasad Dasji,

  

Namo namah ! The verse is very good. a typo has occured at " utkspitaaH " which should read "utksiptaaH ".

  

Let me translate as under:

***  
***

***" Those that are born low, those that are never ever counted anywhere,***

***       Underfeet everyday those who are crushed on the ground, thus for long lost !***

*** Thrust upward by an unsteady wind, my friend ! in the sky o look there ,***

***       Assuming position on high-rise earth-sustaining hills, the particles of dust. "***

***  
***

**रामो रामानुजो रामानन्दः स्मृतिपथागताः।**

**समुद्धरन्ति ये सद्यः कालक्लेशितमानुषान्।।**

**भल्लटः सत्कविः सत्यं समाजस्य यदृच्छति।**

**तद्धीरैर्धारणीयं नः साम्प्रतं यदसाम्प्रतम्।।**

**  
**

**सादरं**

**सुरेन्द्रमोहनमिश्र:**

***
