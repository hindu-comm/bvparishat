Namaste

  

Sorry for the loss of Professor Devanathan. But I noticed couple of members saying 'May his Soul rest in peace'. But it is not correct for us in Sanatana Dharma to say this like the Christians and Yavanas.

  

In our Dharma the Soul will travel to Para Loka and enjoy the fruits of actions or if it is Mukta it will join God in Vaikuntha or Kailasa or it will get Videha Mukti. The 10 day death ceremony is for making the Soul's travel easy and comfortable. There is no meaning for resting in peace for a travelling Soul. One scholar Sri Prakash Rao Pavagada on open TV programme pointed this and said it is wrong for us to say Soul resting in peace.
