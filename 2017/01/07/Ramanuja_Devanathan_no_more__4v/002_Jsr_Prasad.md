Prof. Ramanujan Devanathan Ji was a great Vaiyakarana, a polyglot, an able administrator and beyond all these, an affectionate human being.

  

In 1996, as research scholars at Tirupati Vidyapeetha, we requested his services, alongside other scholars, for coaching program to the shiksha-shastry students. Needless to say it was a grand success. The dynamism in him was, indeed, inspiring and motivating. I believe, he has published a couple of scholarly books, but details are not available right now.

  

तन्नारायणसायुज्यप्राप्तिरस्त्विति सविनयं सर्वशक्तिमन्तं प्रार्थयामहे ।

  

Sincerely,

Prasad
