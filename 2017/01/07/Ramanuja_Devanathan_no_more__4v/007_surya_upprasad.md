our beloved Guruji, Sriman Prof. R Devanathan, was the living encyclopedia of Vyakarana and Shiksha Sastra. i was blessed two times with His teaching as i studied B.Ed and M.Ed under Him in RSVP tirupati. there are no words to explain His love and affection towards students. His sudden demise is a great loss to Sanskrit fraternity. May His Soul rest in peace.

  

I came to know that our Guruji, Prof R Devanathanji, is being brought to Chennai from mumbai and final rights will be performed there tomorrow.

(Plot no.57, Rajaji nagar, Madipakam,  

Chennai.)
