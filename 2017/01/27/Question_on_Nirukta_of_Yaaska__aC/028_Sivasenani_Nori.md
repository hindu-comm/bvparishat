Sir

  

I am not yet a Doctor of Philosophy. I hope your sambodhana portends good tidings.

  

Regarding the usage of labels, I submit that idealism has more than one flavour. Further, while it is true that there cannot be 100% mapping between a relatively modern school like Idealism and a classical one like Sphotavaada, within the limits within which such characterisations are done, it seems that it is reasonable to describe Bhartrihari as an idealist.

  

For support I would like to quote from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (

<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/idealism/>):  

  

"Although the existence of something independent of the mind is conceded, everything we can know about this mind-independent "reality" is held to be so permeated by the creative, formative or constructive activities of the mind (of some kind or the other) that all claims to knowledge must be considered, in some sense, to be a form of self-knowledge."

  

While epistemological idealism (described above) usually leads to ontological idealism (described by Prof. Paturi - that there is no reality beyond mental constructs) in western philosophy, the situation in India is different: Bhartrihari etc. believe in Veda and Veda says there is an entity called Brahman. So for the Astikas epistemological idealism is independent of ontological idealism.

Senani
