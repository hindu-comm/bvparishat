Matter from idea (Hegel) and Idea from Matter (Marx) debate in the 19th century German philosophy can roughly be translated as

  

chit from jaḍa and jaḍa from chit debate

  

or puruṣa from prakr̥ti and prakr̥ti from puruṣa debate

  

or kṣara puruṣa from akṣara puruṣa and akṣara puruṣa from kṣara puruṣa debate.

  

Do we have any such debate in the entire Indian philosophical thought?

  

That is why I said materialism -idealism categorization does not suit while talking about Indian philosophical thought.
