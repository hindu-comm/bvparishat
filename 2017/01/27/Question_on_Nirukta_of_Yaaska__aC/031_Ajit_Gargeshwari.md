Even Radhakrishna S. and many big names who have written text books on Indian philosophical systems often compare Shankaracharyas philosophy with Idealism and given an impression that Shankaras Advaita is close to Idealism or is idealism. Many texts of Advaita Vedanta use western philosophical terms rather loosely for Indian philosophical technical terms. Many Indian Technical terms used in philosophy are untranslatable so are many western philosophical terms untranslatable to Sanskrit. One can compare and get similar currents of thoughts but not exact thoughts which the texts say for there are always minute differences which becomes major as they both stem up from different traditions and purposes.
