\>It appeared to me that elements of divine being came into the early medieval concept of speech. That was the reason behind my stand.

  

-----देवीं वाचमजनयन्त देवाः -- ऋग्वेदः 8-100-11 ; तै ब्रा 2-4-6-10 ; निरु 11-29

  

"दैवीं वाचं इच्छामि"." etc. prove thatDaivee view of vAk (speech) is not a new development during medieval times.
