That exactly is the point, Dr(soon to be) Noriji.

  

Bhartrihari etc. believe in Veda and Veda says there is an entity called Brahman.

  

That is the point.

  

As quoted by you from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,

  

Epistemological idealism 'concedes' a mind-independent entity. This suits Brahman. Brahman is obviously a mind-independent entity as per the Vedic texts.

  

But the problem comes with the next part:

>

Brahman for the aastika, the Vedic person, as per the Vedic texts is avāṅmānasagōcara.

  

Self-knowledge in the western literature is not the same as ātmajñāna of Vedanta.

  

Self-knowledge in the quoted paragraph is described there as 'the creative, formative or constructive activities of the mind (of some kind or the other)'.

  

ātmajñāna of Vedanta is not an activity of mind.

  

Whetherātmajñāna is the same asbrahmajñāna or not depends on the school of Vedanta to which one subscribes.
