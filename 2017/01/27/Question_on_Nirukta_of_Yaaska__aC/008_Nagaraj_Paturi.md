Dear Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya,

  

The terms used by you, namely, 'idealistic' and 'secular' are both problematic.

  

1\. I do not know in which sense you used the word 'idealistic'. Since this is a context of philosophy, I would assume that you used it in a philosophical parlance only where it is used in contrast with the word 'materialist'. The matter-idea dichotomy in the views of reality and materialism and idealism as classification of worldviews are all products of 19th century German philosophical discourse which may not fit every context that you come across and turn out to be completely a misfit for understanding ancient Indian knowledge systems.

  

2\. 'Secular' is another misfit. In a society where the demarcation between the worldly and other worldly itself is blurring, to be more precise, not an insider's approach, to look for and identify 'secular' works itself is a vain attempt.

  

3. Contradicting Bhartrihari's own view (or even if the verses in vAkyapadIyam to this effect are considered to be those of his disciples, contradicting the views of those so close in time and perspective to him) that the thought in the book was a preservation of ideas in Sangraha and Mahabhashya described as Sangrahapratikanchuka, to consider the ideas in vAkyapadIyam as completely innovations of Bhartrihari is typically western and unjustifiable.
