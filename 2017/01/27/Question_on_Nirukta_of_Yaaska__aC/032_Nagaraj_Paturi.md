Most of these turn out to be problems of 1.learning 2. translation 3. comparison.

  

1\. Learning: Learner tries to learn the unknown in terms of known. Western learners of Indian word-concept worlds tried to understand the Indian stuff in terms of the word-concept worlds known to them. The vice-versa too happened. The result is these application of misfit word-concepts to describe the Indian things.

  

2\. Translation: Indian scholars had a need to explain Indian stuff in European languages, mostly English. They worked hard to learn the European word-concept worlds to be successful in their endeavor (of
explaining Indian stuff in European languages ) . They were not enough careful or critical in carrying out this job.

  

3\. Comparison: Most of the early modern studies in the fields (such as philology, ethnology, comparative mythology) which lead to different contemporary fields of Social Sciences and Humanities were comparative in nature and were trying to arrive at human universals. They were excited by the outward similarities and were not equipped enough to grasp the deeper dissimilarities.

  

People like Prof. S. Radhakrishnan were under pressure to prove 'philosophicality' of Indian 'dars'anas' etc. which were being brushed aside as not worthy of being talked about in a University philosophy class room on account of being religious or at the most metaphysical or theological. They were proud of themselves and were patting their own backs for being successful in persuading the western University circles to take dars'anas etc. as worthy of an entry into a philosophy class room.

  

But today, we can review all such mistranslations, correct them and help ourselves and our audience grasp things in a way they deserve to be grasped.
