Thanks to many scholars who contributed to my understanding. My original question was simply--Is there mention of Sphotavada or Varnavada in Nirukta of Yaaska. When I use the word VarNavada, it is the one originally proposed by Upavars'acharya. I received my answer. Thanks to all.

Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



Is there mention of Sphotavaada or VarNavaada in the Nirukta of Yaaska?



(Time of Yaaska around 700 BC and that of PaaNini around 500 BC.)



Or this debate on Sphotavaada and VarNavaada is post Yaaska (even post PaaNini) development in semantics of Sanskrit words? Thanks in advance, NRJOSHI
