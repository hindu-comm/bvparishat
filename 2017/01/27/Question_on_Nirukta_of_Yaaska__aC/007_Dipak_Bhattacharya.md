When the question involves divine language it cannot be secular. But Panini had the current language as his object. He took also the language of the Chhandas as object, but he does not call that divine. Daivi Vaak, Devabhasha etc are later concepts. I admit, of course, that there are glimpses of the shape of thngs to come in future in 1.164.
