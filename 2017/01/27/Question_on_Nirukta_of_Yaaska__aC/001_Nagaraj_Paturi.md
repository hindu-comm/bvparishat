Two questions:

  

1\. We know from your older posts that you have your varNavAda . Are you asking, "when did the ideas in my varNavAda find their first articulation? " If yes, for the members who did not follow your older mails on the topic, can you please provide a one sentence brief of the same so that they can help you to know when those ideas found their first articulation?

  

2\. Or , Do you know a varNavAda already mentioned in some text and you are asking, "When did this varNavAda that I found in this text find its first mention , description or articulation? " If yes, can you please mention /remind (from your older posts) the source where you found the varNavAda you are focusing here in the present post?
