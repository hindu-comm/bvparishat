\>Bhartrhari calls sabdatattva anaadinidhanam brahma and akshara.

  

------ śabdatattvam is not the subject उद्देश्य part of the sentence here. It is in the predicate विधेय part of the sentence. In other words, śabdatattva is not what is being described here. It is brahman that is being described here. 'Brahman which is anādinidhanam and akṣaram is of the nature of śabda'. is what is being stated here.

  

Brahman being described , rather being defined asanādinidhanam and akṣaram is not new. It is already there in Upanishads.

  

What Bhartrihari is specifically declaring for the purpose of his book is that that Brahman which is already described asanādinidhanam and akṣaram is in fact, śabdatattvam, i.e. of the nature of śabda.

  

Upanishads have several views of Brahman. They have आनंदो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात् at one place and ॐ इत्येकाक्षरम् ब्रह्म at another.

  

Bhartrihari's statement comes close toॐ इत्येकाक्षरम् ब्रह्म. Again, in such statements of Upanishads too, we should not say,ॐ is being described here and it is being called Brahman. Brahman is being described here and it is being said that it is in the form of a single syllableॐ.

  

Thus we can see that even Bhartrihari's proclamation that'Brahman which is anādinidhanam and akṣaram is of the nature of śabda' already has its roots in the Upanishads and is not a new innovation or invention by him.
