Thanks Dr Nori, for providing examples for the continuity of ideas between Mahabhashya and Vakyapadiyamby citing the Kamsa etc. being seen as mental constructs by both.

  

But can this be taken as idealism?

  

Unless it is proved that Bhartrihari considers that there is no reality independent of its mental construct, Bhartrihari can not be called an idealist.

  

For Bhartrihari, there is no reality apart from śabda. There is no reality apart from bauddhārtha or sampratyayārtha is not his view. Hence his view is not idealist.
