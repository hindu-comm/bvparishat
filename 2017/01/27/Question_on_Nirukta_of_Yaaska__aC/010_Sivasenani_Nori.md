To the extent that artha is primarily bauddhArtha in vyAkaraNa, "idealistic" is appropriate.

The above point thatBhartrihari only expanded the traditional position of Vyakaranacan be established with respect to the "idealism" of  Grammarians through the following kaarikas of saadhanasamuddeSa (in padakANDa of vAkyapadIyam)

  



*sādhanavyavahāraśca buddyavasthānibandhanaḥ \| *

*sannasanvā’rtharūpeṣu bhedo buddhyā prakalpyate \|\| 3 \|\|*

Sādhana, here, means the instrumentality through which grammar operates, that is division of things into subject, object, instrument etc. so that an appropriate case (*vibhakti*) can be assigned to each *sādhana*, that is each thing divided into subject, object etc. Such a system of treating things like agent, object etc. (or division into subject and predicate) is called *sādhanavyavahāra*. This *sādhanavyavahāra* is tied to the things situated in the mind; whether they be actually present or not in the real world, their analysis into subject, object etc. is mentally fashioned. (The next *kārikā,*No.4 not reproduced here,gives an example of the usage “the people of Pāñcāla are more beautiful than the Kurus” in which construct, first the two peoples are imagined to be together, and are then divided on the basis of beauty by using the ablative case \[than\]).



*śabdopahitarūpāṃśca buddherviśayatāṃ gatān \|*

*pratyakṣamiva kaṃsādīn sādhanatvena manyate \|\| 5 \|\|*

The Bhāśyakāra \[Patanjali\] considers Kamsa and others, who are actually mental constructs given form by words, as if they were directly perceived, as *sādhana*. \[This has reference to the Pāṇinian aphorism *hetumati ca 3-1-26* which describes the application of causative affix *ṇic*. There, Kātyāyana, the vārttikakāra, adds the instance of story telling, such as the one about Krishna killing Kamsa, as a situation where *ṇic* is to be applied as Kamsa and others are not present as *sādhana* for *ṇic* affix to be applied. The bhāṣyakāra Patanjali differs with Kātyāyana, and Bhartṛhari gives the justification: for Patanjali, Kamsa and others, though mental constructs, are to be treated as if they were directly perceived.\] The larger idea here is that language operates with reference to mental constructs, not actual things.



*buddhipravṛttirūpañca samāropyābhidhātṛbhiḥ \|*

*artheṣu śaktibhedānāṃ kriyate parikalpanā \|\| 6 \|\|*

Further, the mental construct is imposed upon external objects by the speakers, and the conceptual differentiation of potentials (to be subject, object etc.) is being done.
