Namaste.  

  

There is no mention of Sphotavaada or Varnavada directly in Niruktam. There is one sentence on nityatva of Sabdas ( इन्द्रियनित्यमौदुम्बरायणः) on which Yaska's views could be interpreted in two ways. The commentator Durgacharya shows that in either case (whether Sabda be nitya or not), there is no baadha to Nirukta's subject matter.

  

This shows that the debate about whether Sabdas are nitya or not is older than Yaska. Varnavaada and Sphotavaada are closely related to the question of Sabdanityataa.
