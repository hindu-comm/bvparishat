Sir

  

I agree that there is a huge gap between the aatmajnaana of Vedanta and self-knowledge of Idealism This - insight of epistemological idealism about what can be known - blossomed later, when western philosophy took a linguistic turn, into the position that knowledge is limited by language, but if one is still left wondering about the noumenon.

  

For me, these weak formulations only reinforce the fact reasoning cannot positively establish the entity which is the subject-matter of Saastra.

  

Regarding the idea of labelling Bhartrihari or Sankaracharya as an Idealist, going forward I will be more careful and will try to use the proper avacchedaka as a qualifier.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
