Thanks Prof. Deshpande, for adding one more reference that confirms the point that viewing speech as daivī is not a new development of medieval times.

  

दैवीं वाचमिच्छामि was a quote by Aayushmaan Venkata Sriram, not from a Vedic text, but from his oral information /participating observation of s'routa prayoga. There could be a mistake in his hearing or observation. But the point that vāk was viewed as daivī doesn't alter with the change in that part of the sentence.
