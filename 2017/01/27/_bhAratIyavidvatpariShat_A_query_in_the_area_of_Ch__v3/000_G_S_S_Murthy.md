Dear Scholars,

Sri. Vedantadesika has composed 15th canto of Yadavabhyudaya in a Chandas which appears to me to be less used in literature. The first stanza runs as follows;

अथ पद्मभुवः पितुस्सकाशात् अभिगच्छन् यदुपुङ्गवं दिद्क्षुृः ।

मुनिरध्चनि वल्लकीसहायः प्रजगौ लास्यतरङ्गितप्रचारः ॥

Sri. Appayyadikshita, the commentator, has correctly identified the vrutta as औपच्छन्दसिक and quotes वृत्तरत्नाकर: "पर्यन्ते र्यौ तथैव शेषं औपच्छन्दसिकं सुधीभिरुक्तम्" (verse 35 ). AS per this, the odd पादs have 8 मात्राs followed by र गण and य गण, where as even पादs have 6 मात्राs followed by र गण and य गण. The verse indeed meets this definition. But the point is that Sri Desika employs a particular sequence namely स गण and स गण to add up to 8 मात्राs in odd पादs and the sequence स गण followed by 2 लघुs in even पादs. This structuring makes the verse rhythmical. It is possible that this structured metre has been discussed in some Chandas text other than वृत्तरत्नाकर. I would be obliged if some light is thrown in this matter.

Warm regards,

Murthy
