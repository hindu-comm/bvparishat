The *Avacchedakatānirukti*, a supplement by Gadādhara Bhaṭṭācārya (circa 1604–1709) to the commentary *Dīdhiti* on the *Tattva Cintāmaṇi* written by the great philosopher Raghunātha Śiromaṇi (circa 1477–1547), deals with the interpretation of *avacchedakatva*, the individuality of invariable concomitance in inference (*vyāpti*), elaborating upon Raghunātha Śiromaṇi’s treatment of the topic. In his own commentary, the *Subodhā*, Prof. N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya clarifies the most difficult portion of this śāstric text, and renders it accessible by presenting it in simple and lucid language.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
