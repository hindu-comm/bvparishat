The moderator did not post the email of the group member. If members give out their Emails their on a public list what can be done. Thanks for raising your concerns on an important issue. We must also understand moderator of any group do have a certain amount of time in hand and cannot have flood of email into their in box

In this case member could have unsubscribed from the his old email and could have requested for fresh admission with his new Email ID That was not done. Members needs to know to use the tools available to them to handle their accounts

Regards
