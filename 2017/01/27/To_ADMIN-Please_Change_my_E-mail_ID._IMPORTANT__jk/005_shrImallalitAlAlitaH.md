Yes, that's why we need to educate them, either by providing link of some website(preferably made by us) with videos and screen-shots.

  

I didn't see post of Bipin directly. It was only Nagraj's post which appeared in my inbox. So, I think that at least moderator should not quote the same thing and post to group.

Even if someone, who doesn't know things, posts to group, we may choose to not publish it(provided that all posts are moderated) or quote it. Moderators may reply those people directly.
