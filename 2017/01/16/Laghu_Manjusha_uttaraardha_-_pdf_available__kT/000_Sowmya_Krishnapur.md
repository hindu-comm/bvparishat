Namaste,  
  

Is a scanned pdf of the uttaraardha of Siddhaanta-Laghu-Manjusha of Nagesha Bhatta available anywhere?  
  

With my search, I could find the Poorvaardha (Taatparyaanta) portion, and the Dhaatvartha-Tinartha sections, but could not find the later portions. I specifically need to consult the portion on Vrttis and Samaasa.  
  

Thanks in advance,
