Dear BVP friends,

  

  I am so thankful to this community of Sanskrit lovers who can appreciate Sanskrit poetry and give encouragement and advice. I used to write a lot of Sanskrit poems, and translate into Sanskrit poetry from Marathi, Hindi and English, during my college days in Pune, and then after coming to the USA, this poetic instinct pretty much went dormant for the past fifty years, for lack of an audience here in Ann Arbor.
The BVP has provided a lively audience, and my poetic instinct has returned, and I am so happy. My poems on Pune was a first poetic creation after fifty years, but that was more in the nature of fun. The Sita-Ravana conversation provided a more genuine poetic theme, and a serious test of poetic expression. In using the word लघुवंश in Ravana's speech, I simply was attempting to see how Ravana would use a demeaning expression by calling Rama लघुवंशज, rather than रघुवंशज. Thanks, once again.
