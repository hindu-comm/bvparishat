Dear Sir.  
  
Alas, it came to an end. What is interesting is Ravana's agony towards his brother's refuge in Srirama! In your previous mail, at रामं तं लघुवंशजं जनकजे कस्मात् स्तुषे सन्ततम्.. is there a typo? The conclusion brought relief in one verse - पायान्न: स रघोरयं कुलमणि: कुर्यात् सदा मङ्गलम्, which has a मङ्लम् and has सुखान्त । As other friends opined, you may please publish this kavya with English translation.  

  

Warm regards,  

Prasad
