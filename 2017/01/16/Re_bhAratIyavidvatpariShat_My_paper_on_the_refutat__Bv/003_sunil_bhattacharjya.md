Namaste,.  
  

Yes, Prof. Sacchidanand Mishraji had written a very good paper and congratulations to him on that. Had any translation of that been made in English, it would have reached a wider circle of scholars.  

  

The first paper, where Prof. Badrinath Shukla proposed Dehatmavada in Nyaya, appeared as \<**Dehatmavada or the Body as Soul: Exploration of a Possibility Within Nyaya Thought, Journal of the Indian Council of Philosophical Research 5 \[1988\]. \>** He is also said to have written a refutation of the first paper at a later stage, but I don't have any reference details on that. I would request the scholar, who may have the pdf of these two papers of Prof badrinath Shukla, to be kind to send that to us.**  
  
**Regards,  

Sunil KB**
