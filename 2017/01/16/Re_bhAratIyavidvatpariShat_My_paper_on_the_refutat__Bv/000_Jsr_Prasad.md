Namaskar Prof. Sacchidanand Ji,  
  

Thanks for sharing your paper. It took some time for me to read along as it was written in chaste Hindi. I am really surprised by looking at the arguments of the two Nyaya stalwarts - Prof. Badri Nath Shukla Ji and Prof. Biswambar Pahi Ji. Being a *mandamati,* I was just wondering, what motivated these great scholars to deviate from the tradition to propose देहात्मवाद wherein one argues for mind to be the locus of saamaanya-gunas like buddhi etc., and the other proposing the सन्तानस्वरूप of आत्मा । The four points against dehaatma-vaada, that you raised from Nyaya tradition are the cream of argument and Prof. Shukla Ji's responses to those are still amazing, but follows week argument? But keeping in line with orthodox Nyaya system, putting parallel his arguments to the कृतप्रणाश-अकृताभ्यागम shows his not too deviated approach. Whereas Prof. Pahi's approach, as you said, looks like a Carvakan's since he refutes the punarjanma.  
  

Thanks for this nice analysis and thanks to the member, who initially requested you to post the paper.  
  

Best regards,  

Prasad
