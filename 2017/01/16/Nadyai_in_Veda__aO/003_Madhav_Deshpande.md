Dear Shri Sundareswaran,

  

  If I remember, the original discussion was not about the form नद्यै, but about नद्यै: with a Visarga, a form that the Kāśikāvṛtti cites as a chāndasa form, and tries to derive using छन्दसि बहुलम्. The form नद्यै: with a Visarga has not been attested in any known Vedic text, but was presumably known to the authors of the Kāśikāvṛtti. Best,
