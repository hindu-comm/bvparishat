Ushaji,

  

Ramayana Bibliography by N.A. Gore mentions the following. This edition is not available online.  

Krishnacharya T. R. Srimad Valmiki Ramayana according to Southern readings 2nd edition with foot-notes in 2 volumes. Kumbhakonam, 1919. (This edition contains a useful index of Subjects and Proper Names, pp. 555-590)  

  

There is another edition of Valmiki Ramayana with Tika of Govindaraja in 7 volumes edited by TR Krishnacharya. It is available online. But, it doesn't mention anywhere that it is based on Southern recension of VR.
