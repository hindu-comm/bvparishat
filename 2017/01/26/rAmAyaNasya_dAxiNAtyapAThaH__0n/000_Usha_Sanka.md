Namaste

Happy to write back after long. Happy Republic Day to you all.

I have one query. I request the scholars to help me.

Is there a Southern recension of Valmiki Ramayana separately available anywhere online?

What is essentially different in Northern and Southern editions?

Thanks a lot in advance.
