Prof. B.N.K.Sharma in his book History of the Dvaita School of Vedanta and its literature lists 292 works as list of works cited Madhvacharya.



In appendix III of the same book he lists insufficiently known or undatable authors and works in Dvaita literature.



Apart from the papers cited in these two threads are there books or papers written on the subject. Are the 292 plus works completely traced is question that has been often asked in connection to what works Madhvacharya knew and which among them were known only to him and which among them are known to him and are available today.



One can view or read Prof B.N.K. Sharmas book here

Testimonies from hagiographical accounts like from Shankar Vijayas or from biographer Narayanapanditacharya in Madhvavijaya may need to be further researched upon as they contain many fanciful details along with history is the opinion expressed by both Indian and foreign scholars.



I totally agreed one should avoid hurried judgements in any research endeavour.
