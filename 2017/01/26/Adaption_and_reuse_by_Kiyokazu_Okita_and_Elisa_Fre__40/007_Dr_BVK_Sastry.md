Namaste





1. *eṣa śloko bhavati *- This is a Upanishadic statement, a summary position, an authority position. If nothing else, the authority of the spokesperson is not questioned here.   
  

*2. api ślokāḥ pramāṇam?* - This is a tantrum in discourse. Patanjali effectively answers it by invoking a source ‘bhrAjAh nama slokAH’.





The current issue under debate is of a different order, where ‘ within a historic time window’, a source quoted as a reference’ is not traced to ‘ some known source’ PLUS the stress is on accepting the authority as ‘ Achrya Proktam’ as authority ! I have no problem in accepting Acharya, just because of his position and statement. That is called
‘Faith- belief Trust position’. This is taken by almost all schools. Example : Mahakavi –prayoga, Arsha prayoga’… The difficulty is with the academic historical footprint tracing.



The elephant has marched. The researcher is trying to find out the left and right foot prints ! and say I see two right foot prints for one left print ! Did the elephant fly ?
