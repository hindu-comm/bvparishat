Namaste

A supplemental question here:

1\. What is the first known occurrence of this - ' i have heard, but source not known',

( - iti shushruma poorveshaam ye Nah tat vyaachachakshire)

2\. Do we know of any other earlier writer like Panini, Patanjali, Yaska - ( or Nagarjuna from Buddhism), bhartruhari, Abhinavagupta.. use this **strategy** at any place?

Regards.
