I have another question. There are untraceable quotations in numerous other commentaries, for example in Kashika, Balamanorama, etc. Even as late as the works of Dayananda Sarasvati edited by Yudhishthira Mimamsaka, we find footnotes like "mulamasmabhirnopalabdham", "mulam mrgyam" etc. Has there been a study on untraceable quotationsin general? What are the yardsticks applied to judge with conviction that an untraceable quotation was invented by the author who quoted it?
