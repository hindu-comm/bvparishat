Dear Prof. Pandurangi,

  

Recent academic papers aside, I would like to ask a different question.

  

Is B N K Sharma the first writer to attribute Madhva's quotations to his Yogic ability to recapture lost Shakhas and other texts? Has this line of reasoning been given by any earlier, traditional dvaita-vedAnta authors, writing in the saMskRta language, as a defense against appayyadIkshita's criticism of these texts?

  

The reason I ask is that dvaita writers have written much about pramANa-s and their operation. If any of them had appealed to Madhvacharya's yoga-siddhi abilities as a defense against one of their biggest scholarly critics, I expect that they are likely to have presented a much more sophisticated philosophical discussion about it than a quick reference to what is generally described as yogI-pratyaksha.

  

I am asking this for the sake of information, to educate myself, not to start a debate on dvaita vs advaita nor a debate about Madhvacharya's citations.

  

Best regards and namaskaras,

Vidyasankar
