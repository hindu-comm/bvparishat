Dear All

  

I went through the link given by Sreekarsaha which (again given at the end of this post) led me to

  

"Quotation, Quarrel, and Controversy in Early Modern South Asia: Appayya Dīkṣita and Jīva Gosvāmī on Madhva's Untraceable Citations"by 

Kiyokazu Okita and one more paper

"Reusing, Adapting, Distorting. Veṅkaṭanātha's reuse of Rāmānuja's commentary ad BS 1.1.1" by Elisa Freschiin the same volume "Adaptive Reuse" edited by Elisa Freschi and Philip Mass.

  

But **I am afraid to say both are appallingand failing to understanding what is written by the Either Appayya dikshita or Venkatanatha. This is one of the numerous results of western researcher's over enthusiasm to become experts in a particular field but without enough study. These authors Even failed to refer to many new publications. that they based their studies on earlier english writings makes them अन्धेनैव नीयमाना यथान्धाः.**

**  
**

**I do not know about the papers in the volume. since they are not areas of interest. **

**

Coming to Paper no. one. Okita is writing this paper on untraceable quotations of Madhvacharya. However Okita starts with Appayya Dikshita's criticism of Dvaita interpretation and him accepting Saguna Brahna etc.If Okita has anything to support Appayya Dikshita then he should read full series of refutations that followed Appayya Dikshita's controversical book. He should read what Appayya Dikshita has written in other works like Shivarkamanidipika etc. to understandAppayya Dikshita fully. I am not denying Okita the right to criticise Mahva, but Okita should be well read to get that right by studying all the texts in a way like one prepares for tenali exam in advaita vedanta.

  

Here are some examples

Okita

  

"For example, Sharma writes:The Gita says God descends on earth in all Yugas and surely some ofthe gods too do so with Him \[…\] \[W\]hy disbelieve the ability of agreat thinker like M \[i.e., Madhva\] to be able to recapture lost sakhasby his Yogic spiritual power, centuries ago, for the benefit of poster-ity? (Sharma 2001: 21, quoted in Mesquita 2007: 27)This passage shows that Sharma bases his academic arguments on religiousbeliefs.

  

Regardless of whether one believes in Madhva’s supernatural power,the very fact that Madhva quotes thousands of verses supporting his uniqueteachings, verses that occur only in his own works, appears to indicate thatMadhva authored these verses himself."  

  

**Here again Okita fails to understand the very purpose of Vedantic study of Madhva people. They are not simply studying Dvaitavedanta because they have no other work. They are studying these texts for Brahmajnana which leads to Moksha. Should we believe the Western Philologists who study BS for the sake of Study, the whole BS itself is nonsense text based on the religious belief, hence all this is imagination of rshis. Hence has no value. Then whole study of BS will be absurd. Hence our beliefs are deeply religious and we are right in believing that Madhvacharya was able to**recapture lost sakhasby his Yogic spiritual power/**brought these texts from Himalaya. **

**  
**

**Okita can not disprove the theory that Madhvacharya****was able to**recapture lost sakhasby his Yogic spiritual power/**brought these texts from Himalaya. to do so he has either to negate concept of yogic power itself or to prove Madhvacharya had no such power, both being impossible.  
** ****

**  
**

**Again Okita, though aware of difficulty of judgement (he quotes the instances of Dharmashastra quotations which are not available in vulgate editions, but being available in new critical editions) makes a somewhat unjustifiable judgement that Madhvacharya quotations are his own creations.**  

  

  

Okita

"Although Mesquita (2000: 27–29) claims that in the 13 th century Varadaguru and Vedānta Deśika already criticized Madhva’s quotes, it is not clear whethertheir criticism was indeed directed against Madhva. The two authors criti-cized the practice of fabricating citations for one’s own purposes, but they didnot specify, as Jan Willem de Jong (1999: 63–64) and Rocher (2008: 603)point out, to whom their criticism was directed."****

**  
**

**Here Okita has failed to understand Vedantadeshika or not read him at all but simply wants to walkof. He has not read Sharma's point here.**

**  
**

**Okita**

"Although Appayya apparently holds the first passage (प्रथमो हनूमान्नाम द्वितीयो भीम एवच। पूर्णप्रज्ञस्तृतीयस्तु भगवत्कार्यसाधकः।।2.118) to be a *Sm*ṛ*ti*text, it is actually Madhva’s own composition that can be found in his *Mah*ā*bh*ā*rata-t*ā*tparyanir*ṇ*aya *2.118 (Madhva 1971: 24)."**  
**

  

**HereOkita failed to this sloka in the mid of a long quotation from Bhavisyatparva starting from verse 112.**

  

Okita

"At the same time,Appayya’s fundamental problem with Madhva is not his ontology as such.Appayya acknowledges that there are valid Vedāntic views that are notAdvaita. He even praises thebenefit of worshipping *sagu*ṇ*a* Brahman.However, what Appayya finds problematic and unacceptable is the way inwhich Madhva builds his ontology. From Appayya’s perspective, Madhva’steaching is unacceptable, because he does not follow the rules of the game."  

  

**Okita failed to see the later portions of book he is referring to. Appayya Dikshita has devoted full book to refute ontology of Madhva and his interpretations of BS. He has also failed to see following invocative verses of Appayya Dikshita**तथाप्यनुग्रहादेव तरुणेन्दुशिखामणेः। अद्वैतवासना पुंसामाविर्भवति नान्यथा।।7।। अनुग्रहश्च देवस्य शक्त्या चिद्रूपया सह। यथावत्तं परिज्ञाय ध्यायद्भिस्समवाप्यते।।8।। इति भवगवता वेदव्यासेन सूत्रयता परं सगुणमपि तत्साम्बं ब्रह्म न्यरूपि शिवाभिधम्। यदनुकरणादर्थानन्येपि संजगृहुर्बहून्पणिनजमुखाः सूत्रैर्विष्वङ्मुखत्वविभूषणैः।9।।.... भाष्यमेतदनघं विवृण्विति स्वप्नजागरणयोस्समं प्रभुः। चिन्नबोम्मनृपरूपभृत्स्वयं मां न्ययुङ्क्त महिलार्धविग्रहः।। 12।। (शिवार्कमणिदीपिका)

  

  

Okita

"As Alexis Sanderson (2005: 89) and Christopher Minkowski (2008:1)havepointed out, the *ma*ṅ*gala* or the opening verses are the “face” of thework, where the author’s personal affiliation can be observed. Therefore, the opening verses of the*Tattvasandarbha* indicate that Jīva does not see his Gauḍīya tradition as a part of the Mādhva school.Moreover, Jīva mentions that his *Sandarbha*s are based on Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī’s composition, which Gopāla Bhaṭṭa himself wrote following what was written by great Vaiṣṇavas."

  

**Okita has ingnored the fact Jiva refers to Madhvacharya as**श्रीमध्वाचार्यचरण because Madhvacharya was the founder of the school. This is clear in Baladeva's commentary.

यदेव किल दृष्ट्वा श्रीमध्वाचार्यचरणैर्वैष्णवान्तराणां तच्छिष्यान्तरपुण्यारण्यादिरीतिकव्याख्याप्रवेशशङ्कया तत्र तात्पर्यान्तरं लिखद्भिर्वर्त्मोपदेशः कृत इति च सात्त्वता वर्णयन्ति।

वराणां श्रीमध्वाचार्यचरणानां भागवततात्पर्यभारततात्पर्य

ब्रह्मसूत्रभाष्यादिभ्यः सङ्गृहीतानि

  

Okita

"Thus, the reuse of Madhva’s un-traceable quotes in the Gauḍīya tradition presents an intriguing phenomenonof reuse in which an influential writer enhanced the authority of (alleged) ci-tations simply by citing them again."

  

**This again is reverse. later authors like Baladeva etc. reused these quotations not because Jiva used them, but because Madhvacharya used them. this is clear from Baladeva's devotion to Madhvacharya.**

**  
**

**thus Okita's paper suffers from both Ignoring and ignorance of facts. this is called दुराग्रह by Madhvacharya. This kind of research papers mislead an uninformed reader.**

**  
**

**Second paper. it is too harsh to accuse the Vedanta Deshika to be distorting Yamuna for his own purpose. That is not the case. Vedantadeshika simply wrote some sentences that bear similarities with Yamuna or Ramanujacharya. But that does not mean distortion. this is a case of failing to understand facts as they are.**

**  
**

**Again Elisa Freschi failed to understand the position of Sankarsha kanda and reiterates what is written in earlier papers. this is both ignoring and ignorance.**
