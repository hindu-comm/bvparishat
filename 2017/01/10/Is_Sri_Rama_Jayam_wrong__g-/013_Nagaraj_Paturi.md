1\. sAdhutva (grammatical correctness) of a certain expression is decided based on where, as part of which language, the expression is used. An expression may be grammatically correct in a certain language. The same phonetic/phonemic sequence may be asAdhu, grammatically incorrect when used as part of another language.

  

2\. Purpose of ashTAdhyAyI is to advise about which expression is correct when used as part of bhAshA (Sanskrit) or chhandas (Veda). To separately advise bhAshAyAm and chhandasi itself means that a phonetic/phonemic sequence which as sAdhu in bhAshA may be asAdhu when used as part of chhandas, if it does not conform to the rules of (lakshaNa found as a common feature of the lakshyas in) Veda.

  

3\. The same applies to Sanskrita - Prakrita situation also. A phonetic/phonemic sequence that is sAdhu for Sanskrit can be asAdhu for Prakrit and vice versa.

  

The verses from vAkyapadIyam

  

ऎवं साधौ प्रयॊक्तव्यॆ यॊ ऽपभ्रंशः प्रयुज्यतॆ /

तॆन साधुव्यवहितः कश् चिद् अर्थॊ ऽभिधीयतॆ // वाक्य\_१।१८० //

पारंपर्याद् अपभ्रंशा विगुणॆष्व् अभिधातृषु /

प्रसिद्धिम् आगता यॆन तॆषां साधुर् अवाचकः // वाक्य\_१।१८१ //

  

were discussed in another thread.

  

4\. The same logic applies here. Sanskrit expressions ( phonetic/phonemic sequences) i.e. Sanskrit borrowings (tatsamas and tadbhavas) in south Indian languages such as Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada are called grammatically incorrect only when used as part of Sanskrit, not when used as part of the respective languages.

  

5\. Another distinction that needs to be carefully discerned is between words and sentences. tatsamas and tadbhavas are categories of words. When a Sanskrit expression makes a full sentence, then its grammatical correctness needs to be decided on the basis of Sanskrit lakshaNa only. मूलरामो विजयते is an example.

  

6\. श्रीरामजयः is a compound. This compound when used in the same form as part of a Telugu, Tamil, Kannada or Malayalam sentence for example as śrīrāmajayah agunu in Telugu, it is a wrong expression in Telugu. śrīrāmajayamu agunu is correct. In śrīrāmajayah bhavati, śrīrāmajayah is a correct expression. In śrīrāmajayam(u) bhavēt, śrīrāmajayam(u) is wrong.

  

7\. As an independent expression, śrīrāmajayam(u) is perfectly correct as long as it is taken as a Telugu/Tamil expression, a Sanskrit-borrowing into Telugu/Tamil and the full sentence implied is taken as śrīrāmajayam(u) kōredanu /vēṇḍēn. If śrīrāmajayam(u) is taken as a Sanskrit expression and the full implied sentence is taken as śrīrāmajayam(u) ichchhāmi, then only śrīrāmajayam(u) is taken as wrong unless the sentence śrīrāmajayam(u) ichchhāmi is considered to be maṇipravāl̥am.

  

8\. Study of sound changes Sanskrit expressions undergo after being borrowed into various south Indian languages is already available in traditional grammars of these languages and modern linguistic studies of the same.
