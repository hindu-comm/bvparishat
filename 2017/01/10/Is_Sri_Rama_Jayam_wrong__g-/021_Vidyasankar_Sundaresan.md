Indeed there is, but to date, I've never heard anyone singing that second line as part of their bhajan rendition. The entire rendition gets done with just the first half used as a refrain.

This song is attributed to Purandaradasa and has the mudra, purandara viTThalam, in the end.

  

Even a musician-composer like Muthuswami Dikshita, an acknowledged scholar of Sanskrit, has at least one Kriti to his credit, kaumAri gaurIvelAvali, which is basically a nAmAvalI, all in sambodhana, with no verb to finish a grammatical sentence. The composition is included in the sangIta sampradAya pradarSini of Subbarama Dikshita, so it has to be taken as genuine as it is.

  

Best regards, and happy Pongal / Sankranti wishes,

Vidyasankar
