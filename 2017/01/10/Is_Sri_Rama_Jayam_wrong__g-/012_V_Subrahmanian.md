It is common in Telugu to have names 'narasimhudu, narasimhulu, ramudu, ramulu, etc.' jnārd(h)anam, jagannādham, etc. are also common. In Sanskrit WhatsApp groups one can see this diversity when voice messages come from Tamil, Telugu and Hindi speaking belts. The 'śa' is mostly simply 'sa' when Telugu people and even Hindi people pronounce Sanskrit words. In Kannada literature too 'śrī' becomes 'siri'.
