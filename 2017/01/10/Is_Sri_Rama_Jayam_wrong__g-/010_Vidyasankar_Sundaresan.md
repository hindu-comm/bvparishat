Getting back to the original question, I think we should be sensitive to the local cultural context of such expressions too. I have never seen the "Sri Ramajeyam(u)" benediction used by anybody except dAkshiNAtyas. It is typically written with rice flour at the home pUjA altar, along with a kolam, or is printed at the top of invitations for weddings or upanayana events, along with expressions like "venkateSvara prasanna," "umAmaheswarar tuNai" etc. I am glad to be corrected, if there is evidence of rAmajayam being used in Maharashtra, Orissa and regions further north. I would think that in those areas it would be more typical to encounter expressions like "jaya jaya rAma rAma" or "jai siyArAm."

  

Historically, Sanskrit no longer quite remains Paninian once it enters the local lingua and both influences and is influenced by the regional speech. As such, I would also argue that south Indians have not thought of rAmajeyam ending in an anusvAra, but only as a full fledged -m sound and that is how it is written in the local script too. My view is that it is rather unnecessary to hyper-correct the usage to an ending visarga, just to conform to proper saMskRta vyAkaraNa. If we want to be very strict about these things, we might as well say that the addition of ending na-kAra or ma-kAra by Tamil and Telugu speakers when naming their boys is wrong.

  

The transformation of ja to je in the written Tamil attempts to capture the south Indian pronunciation characteristic. The i-nature of the subsequent yakAra leaks into the preceding jakAra in quick speech. In Tamil script, the name of TN's recently departed CM is typicallywritten as Jeyalalitaa. Even otherwise, Tamilians have a tendency to make the word initial hrasva a-kAra into an e- sound in many places (e.g. MS Subbulakshmi sings it as gengA jala lava kaNikA pItA).

  

In one of the issues of the Adyar Library Bulletin (I don't have the full reference details handy) Prof Kunjunni Raja had written a paper about pronunciation peculiarities of Malayalam speakers, where he pointed out that the word Ramachandran becomes Ramendran in Kerala. The cha becomes ya, which then collapses into the vowel sound in the preceding ma-, eventually ending up as an e-kAra. It would be incorrect to then give a supposedly Paninian vigraha of rAma + indra to this uniquely Keralite feature of a Sanskrit name.

  

The point I'm making is that correcting these kinds of usages to agree with grammar runs the risk of putting our charming regional diversity at an unnecessary cultural disadvantage.

  

Best regards,
