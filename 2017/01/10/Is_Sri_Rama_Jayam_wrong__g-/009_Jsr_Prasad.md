Dear Bhat Sir,  
  

Thank you, it's correct as per construction. It is *tatpurusha,* as I said before. But mostly we seek his blessings, as said by Prof. Nagaraj ji. I guess, we do अध्याहार of the verbal form (bhavatu/astu) to derive that meaning. If not, we may minimise the अध्याहार to vernaculars only.  
  

Regards
