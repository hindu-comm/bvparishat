Indeed, Prof. Paturiji, I'm not saying the usage is not erroneous. However, caturthI + dhImahi is seen in mantras like,

  

tatpurushAya vidmahe mahAdevAya dhImahi \| tanno rudraH pracodayAt \|\|,

  

which are found in the ending mahAnArayaNa upanishat of the taittirIya SAkhA. There are mantras with vakratuNDAya, mahAsenAya, suvarNapakshAya, hiraNyagarbhAya, vAsudevAya, tIkshNadaMshTrAya, mahadyutikarAya and lAlIlAya before dhImahi, as well. I'm told that what is called the drAviDa pATha only has some of these mantras, but the version that is called the Andhra pATha has them all. (As an aside, my own adhyayana is as per the Andhra pATha, although I am from a drAviDa desha family!)  
  
Of course, recently composed lyrics like "gaNanAyakAya ... .. dhImahi" are not Arsha, but I think they borrow the idea from having heard such mantras.

  

The other issue is about the age of specific usages. I expect lyrics of 20th century compositions that have been popularized in recent times to have more errors than otherwise. Perhaps people who compose such things can get better educated and vyAkaraNa vidvAns can help there.

  

However, with a term like SrIrAmajayam (typically written as jeyam), which has no known author and which has been in use for much longer, should we necessarily emend it to have a visarga at the end, in order to make it into a samAsa that is grammatically proper? Yes, as it stands, the construction is unsound, as per Sanskrit grammar, but is it necessarily wrong, within the cultural context (presumably south Indian) in which it was born and has been used?

  

I'm raising a socio-cultural point built into the title of this thread, one which stands outside of the rules of grammar, obviously, so I seek kshamA from the Paninian scholars on this list for it!

  

Namaskaras,

Vidyasankar
