There is a second hemistich for the sloka ' acyutam ....' It is ' sreedharam mAdhavam gopikAvallabham jAnakeenAyakam rAmacandram bhaje ' . The verb is at the end. Another song is Sri. Annamacharya's 'venkatAcala nilayam vaikuntha puravAsam... Through out it is in accusative singular.. Perhaps a stanza of this yet to be traced for the completion with a verb.

Wishing all members a happy Pongal / Makara Sankranthi
