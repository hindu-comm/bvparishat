If one wants to retain the reading with the spelling 'jeyam', nothing can be done about it since it is the way it is written in Tamil, etc. There is a place in TN 'jeyamkonḍān' written ஜெயம்கொண்டான்.   
Ignoring that spelling, the whole sentence, with 'm' ending can be justified by adding 'icchāmi' at the endश्रीरामजयम् इच्छामि, when the first word will become dvitīyā.
