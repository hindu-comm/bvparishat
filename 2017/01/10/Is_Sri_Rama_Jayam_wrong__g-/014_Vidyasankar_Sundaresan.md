Dear Prof. Paturi,  
  
My doubt is whether श्रीरामजयः has ever been used by anybody as a matter of course. I have only seen the term with an ending ma-kAra used by south Indians. Perhaps it would be more accurate to view it as part of Sanskritized Tamil/Telugu, rather than as saMskRta per se.  
  
There are many such irregular usages gaining ground today. One such example- there is a Hindi bhajan popular among North Indians here in Philadelphia - Jo kehte hain bhagvAn khAte nahIn wo shabari jaise khilaate nahIn, etc. Typically, the singers intersperse the lines in Hindi with acyutaM keSavaM rAmanArAyaNaM kRshNadAmodaraM vAsudevaM hariM. That sounds like it should be saMskRta, but they never supply a saMskRta verb to finish a sentence. So, we should take it as Hindi, maybe? But then, Hindi speakers aren't known to end names routinely with an M sound. If anything, I'd expect them to swallow the end vowel too. The nAma-s then just stand by themselves, apparently in saMskRta dvitIyA vibhakti, but without a verb to complete a syntactic connection. Two weeks ago, I heard the same bhajan being sung by someone at Sringeri. If anybody among the hundred odd people there during that night's pUjA thought about the language and grammar issues, they kept it to themselves, starting from the scholarly Acharya. Nobody thought of correcting the lady who sang.  
  
I think bhakti trumps vibhakti and the vigraha in the pUjA is more important than sandhi/samAsa vigraha for the users of such expressions. Various constructions, regular and irregular, capture their imaginations and vyAkaraNa has to step back! There is an avyAkRta groundswell from which the nAma and rUpa of such usages spring. Perhaps they should just stay as they are, to preserve their original flavor, without being corrected for classical grammar?!!  
  
Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
