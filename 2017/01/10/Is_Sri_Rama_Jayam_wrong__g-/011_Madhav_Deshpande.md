Dear Vidyasankar,

  

  Thank you for your posting. It has been my feeling for many years that the regional variation of Sanskrit has not been paid sufficient attention to. We learn Sanskrit in reference to classical grammars and Shikshas etc., while the actual pronunciation of Sanskrit in each region is definitely not critically studied, and its origin and its connection with local languages is not fully explored. I hope the future scholars of Sanskrit will take up such studies.
