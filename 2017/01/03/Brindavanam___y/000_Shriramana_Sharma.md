Dear list members,  
  
A friend who is in a botany-related profession and very much full of respect for our tradition has the following enquiry:  
  
I have heard of a Sanskrit text called Brindavanam which has a description of the vanam. Can anyone give pointers on where this may be located?  
  
Thanks!
