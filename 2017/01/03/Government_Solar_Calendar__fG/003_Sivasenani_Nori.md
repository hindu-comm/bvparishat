The "scientific basis" is that if the year is to begin with Spring, the spring equinox is the "correct" date and hence an attempt was made to ensure that the year begins on spring equinox. The Iranian or Persian calendar is based on such a rule.

  

In comparison, though uttaraayaNa is supposed to begin on winter solstice, it occurs much later on Jan 14th in the present calendar. This is supposed to be the "unscientific" part of the traditional, religious calendar.

  

The other aspect is about division of months.

  

By the way, there are other unscientific parts which were not touched. For instance, weekdays. If they are to be based on planets, there ought not to be a Sunday and there need to be more days; if they were to be based on heavenly bodies, we have millions of heavenly bodies now catalogued. If it were a simple arbitrary number, 7 is not quite right. 10 would be very convenient.

  

It is not only calendars which are unscientific. Keyboards are a prime example. There is no rhyme or reason to the placement of the keys; actually, there is; but it is a perverted logic. The most common letters in English - vowels, s, r, t were all banished to inconvenient places to slow down the pace of typing as fast typing used to jam the keys of early typewriters.

  

As the above examples show, the comment about a new calendar being "scientific" is a combination of ignorance and arrogance. Ignorance: that man is not always rational, of network effects etc. Arrogance: that a few individuals would know better than the followers of a calendar and those seen as leaders by the followers of calendars. As a result, the Indian National Calendar is restricted to Gazette Bulletins and Govt. diaries. Its months named Caitra, Vaisakha etc. puts off the "scientific" types, and its arbitrariness puts off those who actually follow the traditional calendar sometime or the other. So, basically nobody follows it.
