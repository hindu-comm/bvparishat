Namaste,

In comparison, though uttaraayaNa is supposed to begin on winter solstice, it occurs much later on Jan 14th in the present calendar. This is supposed to be the "unscientific" part of the traditional, religious calendar.

  

The other aspect is about division of months.

  

By the way, there are other unscientific parts which were not touched. For instance, weekdays. If they are to be based on planets, there ought not to be a Sunday and there need to be more days; if they were to be based on heavenly bodies, we have millions of heavenly bodies now catalogued. If it were a simple arbitrary number, 7 is not quite right. 10 would be very convenient.

Yes, the "Uttarayana- Arambha" does not occur any more on the Makara-sankranti day. That occurred till about the end of the 3rd century, if we go by the Lahiri ayanamsha. This astronomical change
is due to the precession of the Earth. The Vedanga Jyotisha (the Suryasiddhanta claims itself to be the text of Vedanga jyitsha) mentions that Makara sankranti and the Uttarana-armbha coincides, and that means the text has not been corrected since the late third century CE. So also the puranas, which are supposed to be updated regarding the raja-vamshavali also stopped that work about third century CE. Possibly the political and social conditions, about two millennium ago were responsible for this.  
  

As regards the weekdays, the Atharva-Veda-parishishta gives the names of the weekdays, including the Sunday. That is due to the adoption of the geocentric representation, in which the Sun is considered a graha and that the Sun also revolves round the Earth.
