Dear Prof. Akluikar,

If I understood you correctly you are asking about the earliest sage of the family whom one rarely refers to as the original ancestor, and instead the family bears the name of some well-known ancestor descending from the pravartaka sage creating a secondary gotras.

Though that has been the practice, the name of the gotra-pravartaka sage is remembered through the pravara relating to the gotra. Baudhāyana mentions eight pravartaka sages. Six of them are the ¤ṣis of the ¡rṣeyama**¸**ḍalas ie of the family books. The pravara does not change while the gotra does.

My views may be commented upon. I wrote from my understanding of the Gotra-Pravara chapter of the Baudhāyana ¿.s£tra, but I do not have the book with me at present. Regret the long lecture  

Best
