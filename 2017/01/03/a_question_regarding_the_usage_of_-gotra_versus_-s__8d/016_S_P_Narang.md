It is well-known that the consideration of sagotra is important in forming relationships through marriage. Secondly, it is possible but unlikely that in a culture like that of the Brahmins gotra and sagotra will be used indiscriminately — as if they were perfect synonyms or as if the use of a longer word when a shorter word was available did not matter. Should any effort not be made to study more closely the contexts in which the two words occur? Should questions such as the following, for example, not be asked: Does sagotra occur more frequently in those contexts in which sharing or not sharing of a gotra has dharma-śāstric importance/implications/relevance? Are there indications of loose usage becoming more common as we come ahead in time? I hope someone will undertake such a study. It may reveal or clarify some aspects of Indian history.
