What I have heard (yet to locate textual evidence if any): When some teachers accepted students who had forgotten their gotra or those without confirmed gotra affiliation, they were treated as belonging to the Guru's gotra that is Sagotra, and could not marry guru's daughter. Such persons in their abhivaadanam had to say ..... sagotrah, etc. 

  

Thanks to Prof.Korada for the references. But (to the extent I have observed)not all vaidikas add the prefix 'sa' in their Vedic s'raadha rites . Over years due to proximity of two words mostly used in private and in temple worship, the sound 'sa' might have been treated as a suffix. Some purohits of course add 'sa' for all. May be that is based on the references cited by Prof. Korada. It is also possible there are family and regional differences in this practice.
