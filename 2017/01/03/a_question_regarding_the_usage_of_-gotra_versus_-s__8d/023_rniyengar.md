Something related to this question appears in the Principles of Pravara & Gotra by Chentsala Rao. Please see the attached English Introduction of the book.The scan quality is poor but you would be able to read by zooming. It seems the penalty for sagotra-vivaaha is thatthe children would belong to Kashyapa Gotra.
