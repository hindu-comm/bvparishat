Namaste



Seeking a clarification on a related yet important question about Gotra-Identity declaration, as it does call for a ‘ Dharma-Shaastra –Research and understanding of History ; and Sanskrit-language ’ .

Just as ‘ Varna’ classification method got diluted and distorted to ‘ Jati-Mata- Kula’ patterns to expand the original 4 Varnas to explode to 6000 plus Jana-jatis in India, the limited ‘Vedic Gotra systems have exploded and diluted to some three hundred plus tags, unlisted so far to their completeness and complexity. 



Do we have to pick a meaning of convenience for this word ‘Gotra’ from the Vachaspatyam list entry \[L=18038\] OR MW entry on page 364, where
one of the listed meaning of ‘Gotra’ is ‘protection for shelter of cows , cow-pen, cow-shed...' ?? as pointed by Prof. Deshpande \< It would then be left to the researcher to infer the reason based on the found pattern \> When I hear a ‘Hindu Priest’ doing a temple archana in the name of ‘Shiva –Gotrodbhavasya… ’ , I get confused on the ‘Gotra issue ’ and ‘ Gotrodbhava lineage’!



**Question**: What is the scope (=extent, nature and purpose ) of
‘Gotra’ identity? Why ‘Gotra’ ? Is Gotra linked to Varna , Jati Or Samskara ?



 *Is it a ‘ Human –Universal ( inherited / installed or contextually given) OR a disposable –language –memory- dynamic tag of convenience? *

* Is ‘Gotra identity limited by Gender and Nationality factors ? *

* Why is ‘ Gotra’ critically to be inherited by family lineage or ‘ Guru’ OR change in ‘ Marriage’ for only one gender ? What about people who do not recognize ‘Gotra’ issue at all ? (Eg. Tantra schools) ?*



**Reasoning behind the question**: (1) The discussions in the thread, have touched in one way or another, on all the above aspects , starting with the ‘ way Gotra identity is declared, with the ‘sa-‘ inclusion or other wise.



The issue then lands on grammarians lap ! Panini rules deal with ‘Gotra, Gotraapatya, Gotra-Vruddha..’ et al. Listed names apart, what provoked a ‘Samskruth grammarian to invest such an intense entanglement on ‘Gotra defining names’, unless they have Human relevance beyond a Historic identity of a proud ( or not so proud ?!) community repeating ( One, Three or Five) names of the Gotra-pravartaka Rishi’s? 



Is there a reason to stretch this deliberation to vast mixed basket of
Hindu/ Humans Globally ( OR within India, beyond a narrow segment of practicing Brahmanas, still with an unshaken shraddhaa? As a public National Identity debate?



For the limited ‘Brahmanas also,’ Gotra identity seems to have been so narrowly limited by the defining ‘Samskara’ of ‘ upanayana’ and optionally there by Father or the Acharya ?? 



Is there any Dharma-Shaastra prayaschitta rule which addresses ‘Gotra –Bhrashtataa’ any where like the issue of ‘ barring Sa-Gotra Vivaha / then prescribing a ‘ prayaschitaa’ ? 



(2) How does one explain ‘Gotra-debate related’ and critical issue of ‘Sa-Pindataa’, used as a criterion in associating ‘aashaucha’ ( inaccurately transalted as religious impurity ? and thus a prohibitory for undertaking certain auspicious works )



(3 ) When the recent studies of ‘Culture Genealogy’, were published, this theme surfaced prominently and caused heated debates across academicians, traditionalists and linguists ! The following links may be some interesting reads in this connection of my question:

One cannot be qualified as, say, Atri-gotra. He is an Ātreya or Ātreya-sagotra that is a descendant of Atri or 'of the same faily as the descendants of Atri have'
