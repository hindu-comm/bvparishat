His question has a small amount of grammatical aspect also in mind, though he could not carry it till the end of his question.

  

That is about the taddhita forms ātrēya , kāśyapa etc. If he continued the question till the end he would have asked why only viśvāmitra;why notvaiśvāmitra ?

  

It should be either atri gōtra, kaśyapa gōtra etc. to be in linewith viśvāmitra gōtra or it should be vaiśvāmitra gōtra to be in line withātrēya gōtra, kāśyapa gōtra ;why is it not so, why no taddhita in the case of viśvāmitra , why only in the case of atri andkaśyapa? would have been his question.

  

But additionally, there is the issue of -sa.

  

That makes the question why not vaiśvāmitrasa,when it isātrēyasa, kāśyapasa etc. in other cases.


--------------------------------------

  

Since Prof. Aklujkar suggested the study of context of use, let us divide the contexts into two kinds: written documented textual contexts from the past and the contemporary oral contexts.

  

I think the original questioner was keeping oral contexts in the contemporary ritual performances that he witnessed in mind.

  

To study the oral contexts , fieldwork based ethnographic survey/observation needs to be done if there is difference in usages based on context. If a difference is observed it should be surveyed if the speakers are conscious of it. If it is found that they are conscious, then it should be if they know the reason for the difference.

My hypothesis is that even if a context-based difference in usage is found, the users are either not conscious or do not know the reason. It would then be left to the researcher to infer the reason based on the found pattern.

  


-------------------------------------

Since now it has been shown by Prof. Korada that -sa has been instructed to be a norm by scriptures, not using -sa should be seen as deviation from the norm, wherever it is found.

  


----------------------------------------

If the difference is found to be not based on the context, but on the name of ther̥ṣi , then the reason must be identified on that basis only.

  

Is viśvāmitra treated differently than other r̥ṣis? Is that the difference in the usage?

  

If attitude towards different r̥ṣis is identified not to be the reason, then other reasons (like the length of the word ) could be looked into.
