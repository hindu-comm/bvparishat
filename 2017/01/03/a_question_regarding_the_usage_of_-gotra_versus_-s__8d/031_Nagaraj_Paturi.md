\>Nowadays marriages are taking place within Brahmin subcastes-like Yajurvedi marrying Rigvedi, or Yajurvedi marrying CKP or Sarasvata Brahmin. Also I know a case where a Kokanastha doctor lady married Veershaive Lingayata doctor. Under such marriages what will be gotra of their children? Thanks. N.R.joshi.  

  

\> "within Brahmin subcastes-like Yajurvedi marrying Rigvedi, or Yajurvedi marrying CKP or Sarasvata Brahmin"

  

'within'? Probably, you mean inter-subcaste marriages are taking place. Yajurvedi, Rigvedi etc. are not subcastes, nor are they endogamous groups. 

  

Of course, it is true that among those sub-groups of Brahmins which in course of history turned into almost endogamous subgroups within the caste called Brahmins, nowadays, endogamy at that level is gradually disappearing. i.e. the Brahmin sub-group which used to have marriages within that sub-group only is nowadays accepting marriages with another endogamous Brahmin subgroup. This does not lead to any intrigue with regard to Gatra because the patrilineal gotra inheritence of the offsprings i.e., that- the offsprings getting the gotra of the father applies here- is a common knowledge and a simple, well established, well known norm.

is a different issue. It is an inter-caste marriage.

  

If inter-caste marriages take place on account of the people involved not believing in caste, gotra etc., then there is no question of such families bothering about which gotra to the offsprings ? etc. If they believe in gotra but not in the endogamy rule of the caste, then only the question ofwhich gotra to the offsprings ? etc. comes. This issue is arising at the time of the offspring performing pujas, marriages etc. They are mentioning the gotra of the father.

  

( Non-dvija castes have a non-rishi name gotra system. If the father belongs to such a non-dvija caste, offspringmention such a non-rishi name gotra as their gotra)
