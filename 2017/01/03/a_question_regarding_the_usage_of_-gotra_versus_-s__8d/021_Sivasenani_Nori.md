Sir

  

I am not aware of any historical usage except the living tradition where people describe themselves as harita.sagotraH ApastambasUtraH. In order to explain this usage, the above explanation was offered. In my view, it need not necessarily involve lakshaNA - though there is no problem in resorting to it if mukhyArthabAdha is established - as the first progenitor can have a gotra, expressed in terms such as "the gotra which was started with him" (just like we could say that the sAkyamuni Buddha believed in "the teachings of the Buddha") though he cannot take the patronymic name (as the gotrApatyam rules are clear).



 Am I missing something here?
