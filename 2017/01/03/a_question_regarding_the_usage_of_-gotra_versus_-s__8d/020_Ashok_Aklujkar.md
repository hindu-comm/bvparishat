If Harita has a gotra, he would not be a progenitor of the first order. There would be an ancestor of his whose name would serve as his gotra designation. Do we have any information in that regard? Alternatively, is there any textual evidence enabling us to take Harita in a secondary sense? (Compare: a Buddha can be a Buddhist only in a secondary sense.)
