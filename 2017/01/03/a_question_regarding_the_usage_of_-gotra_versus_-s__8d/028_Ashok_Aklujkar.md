Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,

  

My question/comment should be understood on the background of the earlier general discussion, not on the background of any specific text talking about gotras and pravaras. A proposal was made that the use of “sagotra” might have become indistinguishable from that of “gotra” in those compositions or compounds in which “sagotra” appeared after the name of a sage/seer whom we take as the starting point of a gotra line. I had pointed out why synonymity, at least in the early usage, was unlikely. On that background I further pointed out that there was also a logical difficulty in taking uses such as harita-sagotra as virtually the same as harita-gotra in that, under the former — under ‘one having the same gotra as Harita’, the (unwanted) implication would be that Harita is not a gotra-starter — that Harita would come across as having a gotra already (that was now shared by the person being described as harita-sagotra.
