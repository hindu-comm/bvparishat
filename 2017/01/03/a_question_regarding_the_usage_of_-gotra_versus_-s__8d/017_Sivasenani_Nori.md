Sir

  

For the same gotra both usages are also visible in some cases. For example many people are haritasagotras - i.e. those who belong to the same gotra as sage Harita. This is so common that I am not giving examples. The same set of people (belonging to the gotra of sage Harita) are also referred to as haarIta. One example is from the beginning poems of Andhramahaabhaaratamu where Narayana Bhatta, the inspiration to Nannaya is described as a "haarIta". The reference to ka\~ncukI etc. is mostly in a similar manner in Sanskrit plays; yet, in pravara the -sagotra form is used.

Senani
