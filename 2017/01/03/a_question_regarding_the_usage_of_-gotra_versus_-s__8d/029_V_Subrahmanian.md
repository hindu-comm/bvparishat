//**Angirasa Maharshi**

Angirasa Maharishi was the most renowned and highest rankedRishi who lived during the Vedic period in Sanatana Hindu Bharata. He was one of the seven Saptharishis of the first Manvantara. And the seven Rishis of the 1^(st)Manvantara were Angirasa, Atri, Kratu, Marichi, Pulaha, Pulasthya and Vashista.

Many verses in the Vedas are attributed to Angirasa Rishi. The Sixth Mandala of the Rigveda was formulated by Angirasa Rishi and his descendants. Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda were in use during his time. Vedic gods were appeased and various animals were sacrificed in the Yagnas. Everybody during the Vedic period ate both plant and animal food. In that environment, Angirasa Rishi teamed up with his fellow Vedic Rishi Atharvana Rishi to formulate Atharvana Veda, the fourth Veda among the Rig, Yajur, Sama and Athravana Vedas.//

In our (smƒÅrta) Sandhya worship, before Japa, we invoke sapta rishis: atri, bhrugu,....angirasa...

If his name itself is Angirasa, how is it possible to have the 'sagotra' suffix to this name? Is it Angirasa sagotra?

//The name Angirasa occurs in the Veda in two different forms, Angira and Angirasa, although the latter is the more common; we have also the patronymic Angirasa applied more than once to the god Brihaspati.//
