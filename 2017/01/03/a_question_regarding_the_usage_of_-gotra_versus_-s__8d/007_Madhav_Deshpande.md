To add more of a grammatical note, a term like viśvāmitra-gotra in Sanskrit can have two possible meanings: a) the gotra of viśvāmitra (a Tatpuruṣa compound), and b) one whose gotra is viśvāmitra (a Bahuvrīhi compound). On the other hand, the term viśvāmitra-sagotra is more clear in having only one meaning: "one who has the same gotra as viśvāmitra."
This may be the reason why the passages quoted by Professor Korada prescribe the use of -sagotra expression. In my family rituals, the declaration included something like aham bhāradvāja-gotrotpannaḥ ... "I, born in the bhāradvāja-gotra." In this usage, the term bhāradvāja-gotra is used just to refer to the gotra of bhāradvāja, and not in the sense of "one with the bhāradvāja-gotra."  I don't remember the usage of bhāradvāja-sagotra in my family. In any case, thanks for all the suggestions, and I have communicated these to my friend, who posed the original question to me.
