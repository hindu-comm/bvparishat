This question is to all scholars including Prof Korada.

Nowadays marriages are taking place within Brahmin subcastes-like Yajurvedi marrying Rigvedi, or Yajurvedi marrying CKP or Sarasvata Brahmin. Also I know a case where a Kokanastha doctor lady married Veershaive Lingayata doctor. Under such marriages what will be gotra of their children? Thanks. N.R.joshi.
