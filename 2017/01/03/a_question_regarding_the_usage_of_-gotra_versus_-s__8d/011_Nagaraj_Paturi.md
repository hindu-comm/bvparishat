Just a point to ponder:

  

All other Gotra names with -sa added are three syllable words and vis'vamitra is a four syllable word. -sa added to vis'vAmitra makes it five syllables. Probablyin comparisonto all other four syllable- - - +sa words vis'vAmitra + sa might sound longer and the reason for avoiding =sa only in that word could belooking forshorter word length.
