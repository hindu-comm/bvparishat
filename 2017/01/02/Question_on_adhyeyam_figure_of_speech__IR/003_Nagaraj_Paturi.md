The following is directly in response to SH. Satyanarayana Hegdeji's message forwarded by AadaraNIya Nityanandji:

  

1\. सौंदर्यमलंकारः, Alankaara is an aesthetic device and needs to be treated only as such. If someone like Bhoja identified Adhyeyam as alankaara, an aesthetic device he must have had the aesthetic value of the type of expressions he designated as Ahyeyam as the basic criterion of his categorization and identification. His lakshaNa must be based on his observation of the lakshyas that existed by his time.

  

2\. From the word Adhyeyam and on the basis that it is being called alankaara, it can besaid that Bhoja considered that an expression occurring in course of along poem, a Kaavya ,providesaestheticexperience to the audience (viewer/listener/reader) on account of its adhyEyatva. Is adhyEyatvaof an expression enjoyable? What is adhyEyatva then as an enjoyable/aesthetic quality?

  

3\. Among English words, words like'ponder' 'contemplate' etc. seem to be close to the adhyayana in adhyEyam. So a better translation of adhyEyam seems to be 'contemplatable'. Is contemplatability aesthetic ? If an expression in a long poem makes you stop for a moment, pause and ponder over /contemplate about it and makes you feel "Ah, yes,what a wonderful point to feel /think about!" that definitely is enjoyable/aesthetic. If that effect of the expression is based on its technique of expressing 'ukti' itself, then it is a Kaavya type AdhyEyam.That is what is exemplified through the example given.

  

4\. If the same wonder / aesthetic effect /enjoyability is created through the contemplatability rooted in thelegendary features / quality (aitihAsikatA ) of the expression such an expression belongs to the adhyEyam of itihAsa type. In the same way, if the wonder / aesthetic effect /enjoyability is created through the contemplatability rooted in thelogical/academic disciplinary features /quality of the expression, that is the adhyEyam of the s'Astra type.Typical of the ancient IndianAlankArikAs , who try to exhaust the possibilities, in their analysis,Bhoja provides for the combinations of these types in the same expression.

  

5\. Leading to vyutpatti, erudition,is only the secondary feature /bi-product of the alankAra, not its defining feature.

  

6\. Prof. Pollock misses the point that Bhoja whilegiving the example of that expression is focussing only on the feature of a kAvya, namely uktivis'Eshatva and notthe other features of a long poem like upadEs'a.
