Namaste



1. Thanks Shree Krishna Prasad for considering that my response on a Technical question on ‘Alankara Shaastra’ / Bhojas views , where eminent personalities like Dr. V.Raghavan and Professor Sheldon Pollock have put their mighty minds. I would be highly obliged to learn from their intellectual vigor and creative poetic perspective.



2. This issue is a super-specialist advanced debate in Alankara Shaastra. BVP group has eminent Poeticians like Dr.Shataavadhani Ganesh, Rani Sadashivamurthy, and the like who may be able to address this issue in all its glory and merit it deserves.



 If I may draw quote relevant for this issue from another forum, it reads : “ This is called the " limited hangout " method of deception. Running with the hares and hunting with the hounds is another name for it." History has taught that people like him wear a mask to butter up Hindus and make them feel comfortable, and thus get a good standing in pop-culture by doling out a few praises every now and then etc. The real face is reserved for Academia, where their vicious intentions lay bare, in their writings and adharmika coalitions they form with other indologists to control our narrative".



3. In the mail thread, as the entirety of text needs to be seen in a perspective, I am placing it with sections that need careful reading to get the clue to unlock the issue. 



 The portions are highlighted –bold. The entire debated point is a ‘Theoritical issue’ :: like studying the flower, by ripping open the ‘petals’ to see where the ‘concentration of beauty’ rests. 



 This path is taken by the ‘shaasta-karas for saundarya –meemaamsaa’ and NOT for ‘Saundraya –Rasa –Anubhava /Anubhaava’. This is the key towards which Bhojas theory points to in the key postulate of
explaining ‘Shrungara as Paramo Rasah / Shrungam arah –where the peak is ‘Ahamtaa’. 



 That postulate leads to the next point of ‘Rasebhyo Bhaavah, bhavebhyo rasaah’ which is a Experience when taken as ‘ anubhava’; and ‘ Vishaya for adhyeyam – vishleshana’. On the top of this comes ‘ Rasa-Bhaava- Nirantaram’- the multiply twined, mutually reciprocating and regenerating rasa-bhaava / bhava to rasa transformations. This is the special section of Bhoajs Shrungara –prakasha, which makes a detailed investigation of ‘Bharatas Rasa Sutra . beyond the simple formula – mono lane explanation of ‘ Bhaava to Rasa’. The details are in Natya Shaastra beyond sixth chapter ! This is also the ground for analysis used in ‘Alamkaara Dhvani’ – Resonating Resplendent Continuum of Alamkara Dhvani in Ananda vardhana. This can only be done in Samskruth language. English is a poor vehicle for this analysis.



 Bhoja is a gene-blend of poetician and the linguist who is using the Vedanta glue in presenting his magnum opus. His writing follows the ‘Shaastra-kaara’ style on ‘Alamkaara – Vishleshanam’ . So the definition is ‘Tat – Adhyeyam’ – That which is to be Explored and Analyzed logically . 



 Here is the key to un-entangle the issue : Is Rasa –Bhaava a subject for logical entanglement and vishleshana ? If done so how would it look like ? How will one teach that and document ? The hairsplitting analysis of Alamkaras to show what name distinguishes what shade of ‘experiential aesthetic savor’? Whether this is to be called ‘ upamaana or rupaka’, rasa- dhvani of Vastu or Alamkaara ? What is the kavya type in ‘ nishesha chyuta chandanam..’ ?? 



 This ‘ alamkaara-shaastra-charchaa’ is Exactly like the mindset of a ‘ postmortem specialist surgeon-physician’ thinking of body-composition and blood type of beloved, while in the intimate embrace of amour. This is Body – Mind isolation which is detrimental to the ‘ rasa –anabhava’. The logician taking over the ‘ poet’. The moment Kavya has become the subject of ‘Shaastra and in to the table of ‘adhyeyam’, the live body is bereft of life and is set for a post-mortem.



 This is what is being done here in the hairsplitting analysis, forgetting why Bhoja has said ‘Adhyeyam to be constrained to ‘ Shabdaalankara’ and the bounds of ‘ Vidhi and Nishedha’ where the ‘cause is vyutpatti’ ; and this is to be followed in a ‘vidushta’ = defect free mode. Then only Poetry will remain Poetry. The shoka of sloka will not there through the language factor. The Ramayana sloka ‘ maa nishaada pratishthaam tvam agamah..’ will be elevating poetry; and not a debate on the grammar rule ‘ maangi lung’.



In other words the statement \< No other poetician or rhetorician mentions a śabdālaṅkāra called Adhyeyam. > is misreading the intention of the text as defined by Bhoja. And what could be the source of this error in later teaching and translation ? It is loosing the technicality of the word ‘ **adhyetavyam**’ used in the same sense as
‘ Kimartham **Adhyeyam**’ in Vyakarana . The fine shades of meaning enhancement from –tavyat pratyaya, between Bhojas expression and the Patanjali expression may be contemplated by the scholars. 



 Then how to explain the Tenth pariccheda ? Again, the key is in the word ‘Adhyeyam’ – It should be studied like this, setting up the model.



Should this discussion be pushed to ‘Veda- model’ ? I think this is based on the implicit hypothesis ‘ Veda (=Darshana) is worth studying as a Kavya (= literature) / Shaastra (= Intellectual analysis, opinion, philosophy, logical reasoning Tarka)’. Bhoja is very clear on this issue and brings up how rasaanubhava is same as ‘Brahmaananda sahodra’ which comples him to give the unique explanation of ‘Shrunga-Ara’. I hope this provides the alternate perspective in understanding the inaccurate statement in the post : \< **Bhoja’s stated aim in defining Adhyeyam as “that which brings about knowledge of prescription and proscription” and which functions as a “guide in life’s journey” seems prima facie completely inapplicable to the kāvya exemplum adduced.**\> and Pollocks Derivation statement \<summed up in Pollock’s opinion that “it does not expressly enjoin or define appropriate action, nor adduce an actual account of such action from the past as authority. \>





I hope with this, one can understand How ADHYEYAM approach is useful
\< as possessing an educative function of bringing about “knowledge of prescription and proscription” that will “guide” the addressee through “life’s journey”? > as represented by the technical word ‘ Rasa –Meemaamsaa’ / Rasaanubhava – Meemaamsaa’ after ‘ Rasa-Darshana’ from Kavya.



This is what the ‘ Tarka-karkasha, praakrutha –mati’ misses from the stand point of ‘Sa-Hrudaya’.



With all this, I still look forward for enlightening explanation from Dr. Shataavadhani Ganesh and Rani Sadahsiva murthy, as they are specialists in this areas.
