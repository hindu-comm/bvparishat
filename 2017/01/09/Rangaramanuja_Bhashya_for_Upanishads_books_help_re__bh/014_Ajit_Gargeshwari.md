The books are from the pen of a profound scholar and the translations are good, unfortunately, they don’t have the translations of Sri Raṅgarāmānuja Else Sri Narasimhan would have written about those books.

I am not aware of English translations of Raṅgarāmānuja's commentaries on the Upaniṣads, but would be happy to know if such translations exist. Best,

Are English translations of**Rangaramanuja Bhashya for Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka and Mundaka Upanishads** available? It seems the research scholar is looking for those.
