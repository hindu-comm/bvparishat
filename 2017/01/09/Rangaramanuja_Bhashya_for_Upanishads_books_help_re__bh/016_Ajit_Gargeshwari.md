Thank you Sheryas ji for the covers of the book. The respected author or translator says these books have the translations and brief Notes in English as per the commentaries of Rangaramanuja & Venata Desika and I am glad if it has the translations of Sri Rangaramanuja completely word to word.

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari

The books are from the pen of a profound scholar and the translations are good, unfortunately, they don’t have the translations of Sri Raṅgarāmānuja Else Sri Narasimhan would have written about those books.
