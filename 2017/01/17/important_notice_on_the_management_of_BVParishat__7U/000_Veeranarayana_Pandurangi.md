सर्वेभ्यो नमः। मकरसंक्रान्तेः शुभकामनाः।

  

it is on the same makarasankranti day of 2009 BVP was created. it is time to celebrate the janmadina.

  

I want to inform you all that there is a change/addition in the moderators of the list.

Henceforth Prof Nagaraj Paturi andProf JSRA Prasad will be the moderators of the list. I hope BVP will grow further in the hands of Profs. Paturi and Prasad. 

  

All the advisory commitee members and others will be the same.

  

I sincerely thanks Shri Ajit Gargeshvari for the exceptional service he did for BVP in the past several years.

  

Only aim of this list is to lift the standards of Research and Education of Sanskrit studies in India. I hope we will be able to achieve that goal.  

  

I also request all the esteemed members of this group to launch a membership campaign so more genuine scholars and serious students will join this group. At present there are around 1600 members. But I expect it to reach to at least five thousand in near future.

  

I once again reiterate that this list is dedicated for the studies and research in Samskrit language and Shastras and nothing else. all the things that happen in the list are subsidiary of this goal. Hence we have to strive hard for this goal.

  

If we use English, it is not for the love of that language.

it is convenience,convenience,convenience and nothing else.

  

If members prefer to use Samskrit or Hindi they are most welcome,welcome,welcome.

  

Pl. dont hesitate to use Samskrit or Hindi. there is a very high preference for shastracharcha of nanu and na ca kind. please continue that too in this list. if that is not happening here, that is because scholars like Mani Dravid or Haridasa Bhatta or anybody else will prefer delivering lectures rather than writing on computers or Ipads. that is easier for them. Even I am in difficulty to find time to write something in bvp. So, pl. beware, even if you start a separate shastra group nobody of this kind will write there too. Hence It is wiser to be in this group.

Dear Members, pl. remember again and again, We 1600 members of BVP are sitting together for the first time in one thousand years. one has to get the use of such a vidvat samudaya. Hence I request all the members again that they should contribute to the cause of Samskrit and should not leave this group because somebody has snubbed him or her. it happens. But I hope that as list grows many members become kind to others. Netiquettewould be followed by one and all.
