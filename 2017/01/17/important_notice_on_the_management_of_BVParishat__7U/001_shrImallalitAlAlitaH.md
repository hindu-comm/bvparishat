That appears a big change, allowing Hindi... Good.

There are more things which stop others from writing in that manner which were pointed earlier.

If you don't recognise them, it's difficult to eradicate them. Best wishes though.

I don't think that old generation of scholars, or those of them who are less in typing business are going to be active members of any group. So, I don't count them. Some of them are just waiting for discussion through voice-recording, we may try to provide them this facility, as was requested by V Subrahmanian.

I am hoping that Sanskrit scholars, young and old, who are not very good at English but are practicing Sanskrit, can take part in a dedicated group. Having a dedicated group is always better than being overwhelmed by a community which is too much relying on convenience.

Other group may start slow, as any other group, and will be elite-only(apparently); but it will benefit all members. Eventually, other people will be benefited.

So, nothing here to be discouraged for those who started a new group, or who became members of the same.

I know that there are not many posts from many of them. But, I hope that they will start posting whatever they tag as important.

Bringing people, who think in opposing ways, under same roof is always difficult. It creates hurdles for both type of people, since others always oppose them. Give both of them a separate space, and they will flourish.

I hope 'other group' was not being discouraged here.

I'm still a part of this group. I'm writing here. But, I'll definitely like to engage in some serious discussion, which is based on pada-vAkya-pramANa-shAstra, with my friends who are willing to share their knowledge and understanding of shAstra-s, either here or in the 'other group - शास्त्रम्'.
