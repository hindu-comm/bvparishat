SanDic is available on Mac OSX now.

  

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/sandic-new/files/sandic.dmg/download>  

  

Download the sandic.dmg and click it, it will run the app. Tested on Sierra. Would work on High Sierra. The package itself contains sandic.db file as well.

  

You can move [sandic.app](http://sandic.app) to /Applications as well.

  

Linux users can download this. Of course, install dependencies like sqlite, Qtcore, Qtgui, etc. Run the command "ldd sandic.linux.x86_64" and shows the missing dependencies. Download the dependencies using yum/apt.
