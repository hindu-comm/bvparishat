**Three day National Conference**  
on  
***‘Global Perceptions of Indian Heritage’**  
*in collaboration with Infinity Foundation India (IFI).  
  
Swadeshi Indology Conference Series  
February 17th to 19th, IGNCA, New Delhi  
  
**Concept**  
  
Since the past two centuries, the study of India (or Indology) as well as the discourse on India has largely been guided either by Western scholars or by institutions that have applied Western methods of studying Indian civilization. While this has brought several benefits, it has also suppressed our own perception and understanding towards interpreting our culture and civilization. After independence, rather than disrupting this structure and replacing it with indigenous approaches, in many ways things became worse. Most Indian scholars have become trained to think like the Western Indologists. As a result, a large part of our intellectual apparatus has remained ‘colonized’. In the arena of education one can clearly discern that right from the primary levels of schooling, to many of the advanced intellectual institutions of India including higher education, media, administrative services, etc.; there is a vast expanse of spreading ‘ideas of India’ that are biased and tilted towards the premises of Western Indology. In fact, the dominant discourse is not promoting India; it is in many ways subverting it from the roots.  
  
IGNCA has initiated a long term programme titled Bharat Vidya Prayojana, to provide a platform to newer paradigms of viewing Indian traditional thought. The Infinity Foundation India (IFI) is also committed to disrupt the Western Indology models and construct Indian traditional interpretations. Given the close resonance between the mandate of IGNCA and philosophy of IFI, it is proposed that a three day collaborative Conference may be organized, under the aegis of the Bharat Vidya Prayojana of IGNCA at Delhi. The primary goal of this conference is to produce a targeted and focused impact in a specific topic where our civilization is being undermined in a serious manner. The topics are chosen carefully so as to bring maximum impact where it is needed the most.  
  
The Conference will have three parallel tracks and about 40 well-grounded scholars are expected to participate in the Conference and make their presentations. The themes pertaining to views and interpretations regarding ‘Rasa’, ‘Philology’, ‘Chronology of Sanskrit texts’, ‘Mīmāṁsā’, ‘Buddhism and its relationship with Vedic traditions’, ‘De-sacralization of Sanskrit’ will be discussed through these presentations. Also papers pertaining to themes on ‘Śāstra’, ‘Sanskrit and Nazi ideology’, “Death” of Sanskrit’, ‘Rāmāyaṇa as a political device’ etc, will also be presented during the Conference.  
  
Special sessions like the ***Vakyartha Sadas*** (assembly of traditional scholars to highlight and revive the traditional oral method of rigorous debate), and a special panel on the Contribution of Indian Indologists (Indian scholars who have contributed profoundly to the study and researches on Indology, but whose offerings remain least acknowledged) will be the added attractions of the Conference.  
  
Hope this Conference goes a long way in redefining the perspectives towards Indic studies.
