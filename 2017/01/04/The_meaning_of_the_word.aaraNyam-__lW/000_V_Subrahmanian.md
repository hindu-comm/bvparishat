Namaste

  

At the beginning of the bhāṣya to the Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat, Shankaracharya says:सेयं षडध्यायी अरण्येऽनूच्यमानत्वादारण्यकम् .

  

What is the meaning of the word 'aranya' here? It is a forest? Was/is there any tradition of reciting/studying this upaniṣad (or any āraṇyaka part of any veda) seated in a forest?

  

Anandagiri says: अथारण्यानुवचनादिनियमधीतवेदान्तानामपि....

  

In the foot note, the editor Vidvan S.Subrahmanya Śastri says: अरण्यं प्राकृतजनासङ्कीर्णो देश: ।

  

Swami Brahmananda, translating it says: 'The Upaniṣad consisting of six chapters is called 'Aranyaka' as it was taught in the forest (aranya).

  

I request scholars here to express their thoughts on the above observations. Is there any story that says this upanishad was taught (for the first time) in a forest ambiance?

  

This question was triggered by a recent thread in this forum on the Mahabharata not to be kept or studied at home.

  

  

warm regards
