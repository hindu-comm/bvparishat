\>I request the scholars of this Parishat to throw light on how different schools of Buddhism are mapped to the different schools of western philosophy. I also seek their indulgence for any pointers to books or articles with a critical approach (critical as in vicaara-pUrvaka, not in the sense of negative) to these characterisations.

  

------ You might want to start with something like[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_Western_philosophy)which covers a very big amount of bibliography that you are looking for.

  

But from the point of view of Indian academic studies, let me tell you that many hasty similarities were drawn between Buddhism and western philosophy. In the days when every philosophy had to be either idealist or materialist, Buddhism was characterized as materialist since it was opposed or countered by S'ankara, the 'idealist'. Marxists found solace in this view as they saw in what they thought Buddha's 'anti-Brahminism' , a pre-cursor to their own project or an past evidence from India for the Marxist historical deterministictheorization that there were class-war like situations from time to time in the past; there would have been revolution in the past itself, but for the conspiracies of the priestly class to divert the revolutionary forces through the manipulation of 'false consciousness' (misunderstanding of one's own economic class identity as a religiousidentity). But unfortunately for them, Dr Ambedkar, the modern Indian Buddhist himself, through his famous lecture in Nepal known as Marxism and Buddhism showed how asceticism-emphasizing Buddhism is different from the economics-centric Marxism. (Economics-centric nature of Marxism stems from or rooted in its 'materialism'.)

  

Even today, when post-modernism has become the fashion of the day in the Indian universities, particularly in their Social Sciences and Humanities departments, the skepticist roots and skepticist core of post-modernism, often traced to Nietzsche, find solace in understanding Buddha as an ancient Nietzsche.

  

Casualtyin the whole process is the understanding of greater affinity of Buddhism and Jainism to the Vedic thought than to the western philosophy.

  

The previous erudite posts by Prof. Deshpande also on the lines of removing the apprehensions of dissimilarities between Buddhism and Vedic thought. The other post too is a sample of widespread Indian sentiment to highlight the shared Indian roots and continuities between Buddhism and Vedic thought.
