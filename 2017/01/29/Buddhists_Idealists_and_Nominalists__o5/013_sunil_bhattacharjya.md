Dear Paturiji,  
  

I have made a general statement and not attacked any person in particular, I was taken aback when I saw that this particular writer was taking Shantideva and Adi Sjhankara to be contemporary. I have not blamed the writer, as it is not his fault but I was pointing at the inability of our historians to rectify the situation. The correct chronology is not for my personal benefit, but it is for the good of us all Indians that we should have the correct chronology. I don't think anybody with the prick of conscience will be happy at the instance I have shown about the muddle in the case of the date of Adi Shankara.  
  

As regards the membership of the BVP, I shall have no regret if I am removed under pressure from people who want status quo in the chronological matters. . Many of my mails are not approved by the moderators and you are always in a position to disapprove my mails, which do not meet the standard of the BVP.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
