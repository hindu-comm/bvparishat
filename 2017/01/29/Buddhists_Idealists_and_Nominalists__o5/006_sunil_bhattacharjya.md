Namaste,  
  

Lord Buddha said in Mahayana teaching, that the Bodhisattva, finds the five sheaths becoming empty or disappearing and attains Buddhahood, just as the Jivanmukta too finds the five sheaths (koshas) disappearing and the jivanmukta becoming Videhamukta and attains the Brahman. This is very similsr to the objective of the Advaita vedanta.  
  
However, the Vijnanavada and the other sects do not believe in the disappearance of all the koshas. For the Vijnanavadis, the vijnanamaya kosha does remain. Thus the Vyavaharika existence does continue for all the sects, other than the Mahayana sect.
