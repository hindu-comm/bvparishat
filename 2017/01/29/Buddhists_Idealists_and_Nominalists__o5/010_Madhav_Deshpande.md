I would like to caution scholars on using a work like the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha to form ideas about Buddhism or any other non-Advaita system of thought. This text's presentation of Buddhism came a few centuries after Buddhism disappeared from India, and the author is presenting a caricature of the opposing systems in the form of skeletal pūrvapakṣas, to be ultimately shot down. It is always best to read Buddhist texts to form our view of Buddhism, rather than base it on the presentations of their opponents. This caution applies across the board. Must read Jain texts to form our view of Jainism. Should not form our idea of Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā based on our reading of Uttara-Mimāṃsā critique of Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā, and so on and so forth. Similarities in vocabulary can be deceptive in identifying the goals of Buddhism with Upanishads. Here is how the Buddhist Āryadeva describes Buddha's teachings:

  

साहंकारे मनसि न शमं याति जन्मप्रपञ्चो

नाहंकारश्चलति हृदयादात्मदृष्टौ च सत्याम् ।

अन्य: शास्ता जगति च यतो नास्ति नैरात्म्यवादी

नान्यस्तस्मादुपशमविधेस्त्वन्मतादस्ति मार्ग: ।।

  

The Buddhists will not agree that their views are identical with those of the Upaniṣads. Perhaps, echoing this sentiment, Gauḍapāda in his Kārika (4.99) says: नैतद् बुद्धेन भाषितम्. I have attached a recent dissertation that distinguishes the views of Buddhism from those of Śaṅkara as a useful reading.
