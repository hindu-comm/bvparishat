AadaraNIya Bhattacharyaji,

  

1\. Do you agree that your chronology of Adi Shankara etc. are not the widely accepted or the ones established in academic circles? Then is it not improper to find fault with every researcher who does not follow your ideas? Are you saying the researcher Dr Warren Lee Todd did not follow the chronology so well established, which is there all over for everyone to see ? You can not say that because it is not so well established, why, not at all established, why, not even considered and it is not so widely accessible to refer to and so on. Then is it sensible to say that he is wrong because he did not follow this which is lurking in some corner ?

  

2\. Please get your chronology established and then it will form part of widely publicized stuff and then only start blaming people for not following it.

  

3\. If you think that this kind of obstinate repetition of your claims in a list of this kind is the method to get it established, I would say that you are mistaken.

  

4\. We may , in future, have to concede the requests to avoid such material from the list.
