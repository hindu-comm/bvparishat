पार्षदान्विदुषः नत्वा निवेद्यते

  

I often read characterizations of Advaitins as Idealists and Buddhists as Nominalists (and have, on occasion, used these myself). In my experience, these are not much contested in academia. The beauty of this Parishat lies in the first preference given to the instinct of viewing the world through the lens of Saastra.

  

In light of the recent discussion wherein Prof. Paturi garu pointed out the limitation of these labels, it looks more appropriate to apply these labels to Buddhists of different schools. There are some ready similarities: reliance on tarka, rejection of SabdapramaaNa and rejection of ontological reality.

  

I request the scholars of this Parishat to throw light on how different schools of Buddhism are mapped to the different schools of western philosophy. I also seek their indulgence for any pointers to books or articles with a critical approach (critical as in vicaara-pUrvaka, not in the sense of negative) to these characterisations.
