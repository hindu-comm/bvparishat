This second verse above has a very good similarity with the Māṇḍukyopaniṣat 7th mantra where the Turiya (Chaturtham) that is Brahman which transcends all phenomenon, is taught as:

  

नान्तःप्रज्ञं नबहिःप्रज्ञं नोभयतःप्रज्ञं नप्रज्ञानघनं नप्रज्ञं नाप्रज्ञम् । अदृश्यमव्यवहार्यमग्राह्यमलक्षणमचिन्त्यमव्यपदेश्यमेकात्मप्रत्ययसारं *प्रपञ्चोपशमं शान्तं शिवमद्वैतं चतुर्थं* मन्यन्ते स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः ॥ ७ ॥

  

While the above is the teaching of the Supreme Brahman of the Vedanta, Nagarujuna too characterizes the supreme truth of his school in very similar terms. Will this give rise to the theory 'The Mandukya Upanishat is actually only a rephrasing of the Bauddha doctrine'? This is because there are claims and counter-claims as to who copied whom:

  

’मत्तविलासप्रहसनम्’ –  
वेदान्तेभ्यो गृहीत्वार्थान् यो महाभारतादपि ।  
विप्राणां मिषतामेव कृतवान् कोशसञ्चयम् ॥

Mahendravarman in his work ‘mattavilAsaprahasanam’ says this about the coming into being of the Buddhistic system:

//Taking material from the UpaniShads and also from the MahAbhArata (which includes the BhagavadgItA), Buddha, even as the brAhmaNa-s (vaidika-s) were wide awake, accomplished a great fortune – literally filled up his treasury – (of establishing a vibrant system).//

  

Of course the first verse of Nagarjuna cited above bears close similarity to the Gaudapada kārikā:

  

``` न निरोधो न चोत्पत्तिर्न बद्धो न च साधकः । न मुमुक्षुर्न वै मुक्त इत्येषा परमार्थता ॥ ८॥ ```

  
which is also found in the 'avadhūtopaniṣat':
