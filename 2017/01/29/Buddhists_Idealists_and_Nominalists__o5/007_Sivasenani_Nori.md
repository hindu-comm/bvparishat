Thank you Sirs, for taking out the time to respond.

  

Regarding the specific suggestions, I am thankful to Prof. Deshpande ji for looking critically at SabdapramANatA in Buddhism and its view about ontological reality. My understanding is that while Buddha is a pramANa for ethics, Iam not sure that they took Buddha's word as the basis for their view about the ultimate entity. It looks likescholars starting fromNagarjuna have "proved"concepts such as SUnyatA, rather than state that"SUnyatA is, because sarvaj\~nabuddha says so".This is akin toSankhya's attitude towards Sruti. Pradhana isinferred based on reasoning, not on the strength of Sruti. This- non-appearance of the conceptin Sruti - then becomes the basis for rejection ofSankhya in Vedanta.So, the centrality of Sruti to Sankhyais moot. Nothing significant in Sankhya changes if Sruti were notto be accepted as a pramANa.This might be the reason why a scholar like Madhavacarya states that Buddhists do not accept the SabdapramANa.

  

These are my preliminary thoughts;since a scholar like Prof. Deshpande suggests that the characterizations need to be revisited, I would look at how this can be stated better. Regarding Buddhists' view on ontological reality, the sarvadarSanasngraha indeed covers the different viewpoints within Buddhism, but they seem to fit in with a "concession" to ontological reality and hence the characterization.

  

I am most thankful to Prof. Nagaraj Paturi garu for the brief on development of comparative studies and for endorsing the Wikipedia page on Buddhism andModernism.
