As per[(Vimal, 2016a)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2016-Vimal-Death-eDAM-LVCR-8-3.pdf), "It is interesting that different metaphysics interprets the experiences of Samādhi/Nirvāṇa state differently, and also the experiences of this state are different for different systems. For example:

\(i\) In the no-self/*Anātman*-based Buddhism, an enlightened yogi experiences the ultimate undifferentiated state of *Śunyatā*/nothingness as ‘darkness within darkness’ as per (Kowall & Deshpande, 2016). They propose ‘ego death’ (external to the mind-brain-body system) after ‘body death’ to experience this Nirvāṇa state. Their framework is based on the bottom-up approach: from potential/undifferentiated pre-Big Bang state to realized/differentiated current mind-brain state. After ego-death, the latter (illusion of life) returns to the former (the fundamental real truth).

\(ii\) In the theist/*Ātman*-based *Sāṅkhya* (OOO-God theory), an enlightened yogi experiences everything (just opposite to no-self-based Buddhism), i.e., full lightness and the whole universe, i.e., what everybody is thinking and doing all over the world as per Vinod Sehgal. He has full conviction in astral and causal bodies and manifested consciousness (external to amind-brain-body system) from the beginning; this is the top-down approach (manifested conscious OOO-God creates everything).

\(iii\) The extended dual-aspect monism (eDAM: *Dvi-Pakṣa Advaita*) proposes that the experiences of Samādhi/Nirvāṇa states are within the realm of yogi’s mind-brain-body system and have their respective neural basis, as all experiences (including out-of-body experiences/OBEs and Bliss) have. Since there is no scientific reproducible evidence of life-after-death, the dead body returns to its constituents after death; each of them is a dual-aspect entity that has ‘latent’ mental aspect and fully manifested physical aspect. This is further elaborated in
[(Vimal, 2016b)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2016-Vimal-eDAM-DPA-LVCR-8-4.pdf). \[...\]

  

From Section 3.8.13.5 of[(Vimal, 2016b)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2016-Vimal-eDAM-DPA-LVCR-8-4.pdf), the working hypothesis and the three experiments on OOO-God theory are as follows:



My working hypothesis is as follows:



No mental entity (such as astral body, causal body, soul/Self, or God) is beyond our mind-brain-body system. It appears beyond only through the ***incompleteness*** of our knowledge such as related to the out-of-body experience (OBE). A complete knowledge must include the fact that an OBE has a neural basis. Thus, enlightened yogis, mystics, and people who propose life-after-death appear to disregard the knowledge related to neuroscience that all experiences, including OBEs at *Nirvikalpa Samādhi* (NS) state, have their respective neural bases and all mental entities are within the scope of mind-brain systems.



Experiences are subjective data; data are data; therefore, they cannot be rejected. Therefore, whatever yogis experienced cannot be rejected.Only its interpretation can be questioned. Their interpretation is based on incomplete knowledge. \[...\]  

  

The above hypothesis can be tested as discussed before. For example, three experiments are proposed:



**(I) Expt.1**: Ask yogis to tell us what events are happening on specificdays with randomly selected 100 people in 100 different countries.

**(II) Expt.2**: Inject anesthetics to yogis during NS-state and then, later on, ask yogis if they still experienced OBEs under deep anesthesia and/or

**(III) Expt.3**: Measure the neural correlates of OBEs by using fMRI/EEG or more sensitive techniques that can measure the neural basis of such very strong OBEs.



If results are positive in Expts. 1 and 2, then only we can claim that the*Sāṅkhya*-based OOO-God theory and the theist version of the eDAM are tenable. In other words, the eDAM can still interpret the data as follows: the degree of manifestation of the mental aspect of a state of soul, God, astral body, or causal body is very high and that of its*inseparable*physical aspect is latent. Thus, even in that case, the theist version of the eDAM cannot be rejected. However, the atheist version of the eDAM can be rejected.



If results are negative in Expts. 1 and 2, then the*Sāṅkhya*-based OOO-God theory and the theist version of the eDAM are rejected. However, the atheist version of the eDAM will hold.



If we are able to find aneural basis in Expt.3, then the*Sāṅkhya*-based OOO-God theory and the theist version of the eDAM are rejected. Otherwise, one can argue that techniques used were not sensitive enough to measure the neural basis and more sensitive technology needs to be developed. \[....\]

  

### **A possibility of sixth sense**

A working hypothesis for explaining the most difficult but reproducible *Nirvikalpa* *Samādhi* (NS)-state empirical data, we can hypothesize that our mind-brain system has a sixth sense (if it exists and needs empirical verification such as high-resolution fMRI/EEG!). This sense is able to receive information from any place outside of brain by focusing method. If a yogi at thoughtless NS-state focuses at a distant place (say 10,000 miles), s/he should be able to receive information from that place whatever people are doing or thinking. In that way, s/he has OBEs and able to ‘see’ what those people are doing and able to ‘know’ what they are thinking, i.e., it is a sort of feeling omnipresent or nonlocal in space-time. This phenomenon misled yogis to claim souls, God, astral and causal worlds. However, the ‘self’ is within the realm of her/his mind-brain system because all subjective experiences including near-death experiences (NDEs) and OBEs have their respective neural basis. In other words, at the NS-state, the 6^(th) sense might exist in our mind-brain system, which might be activated. If this is true, then we can measure OBEs/NDEs’ respective neural correlates using high-resolution fMRI/EEG and or more sensitive techniques. Thus we can investigate what this 6^(th) sense is, where it is located in the brain, and how it works. If true, then it would be a ground-breaking project."

  

Note:I have experienced very low-intensity OBEs (a feeling of out of body but very close to body) 2-3 times during my intense [Soham Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKNzaWGm0o8) (3 hours or more) with fewer thoughts. A stronger OBE may be like a feeling of being in a next room. Please join me if you are interested in. If we are ableto minimize our thoughts to attain a stronger OBE, we may be able to measure its neural basis.
