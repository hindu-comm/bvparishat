I agree.

  

As per (Vimal, 2016), "In *Samādhi* state, enlightened yogis (such as Buddha) can experience the undifferentiated/unmanifested dual-aspect state of theprimal entity (*Brahman*) with Universal Potential Consciousness as 1pp-mental aspect, which is the experience of nothingness/*Śunyatā*. The physical aspect of the undifferentiated/unmanifested dual-aspect state of theprimal entity (*Brahman*) is quantum vacuum/ZPF(zero-point field) with quantum fluctuations, which led to Big Bang. However, this experience must have a neural basis (inseparable 3pp-physical aspect) even if yogis experience strong OBEs (out-of-body experience) (1pp: 1^(st) person perspective, 3pp: 3^(rd) pp). In other words, the *Samādhi* state is thehighest manifestation of *Brahman*, which is a godly state where yogis experience bliss and attain godly virtues such as compassion and love for all."
