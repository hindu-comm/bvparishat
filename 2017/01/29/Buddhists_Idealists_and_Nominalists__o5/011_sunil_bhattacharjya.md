Dear Madhavji,  
  

Thank you for attaching the copy of the dissertation of Warren Lee Todd. Todd assumes that Adi Shankara was living in the 8th century, which itself is based on the dicey claim through partial quoting from a supposedly found document by one Pathak and endorsed by Prof. Max Muller, towards the end of the 18th century CE. Atll the Shankara mathas, except the Sringeri matha, stand by the 6th century BCE birth of Adi Shankara, while the Sringeri matha is yet to take an official stand on the issue, according to the biography of Adi Shankara by Swamy Tapasyananda, where the author quotes a letter from the Sringeri Matha to that effect. However the Sringeri matha stated in the beginning of the 20th century that according to their record, Adi Shankara was born in the 14th year of reign of king Vikramaditya. Assuming this king to be the Vikramaditya, who reigned from 57 BCE, the date of Adi Shankara was earlier shown as (57-13 )= 44 BCE, but there was indeed another Vikramaditya a few centuries earlier, which seems to support the 6th century BCE date of Adi Shankara.  
  
Any further discussion on the date of Adi Shankara may be discussed in a separate thread, but the purport of this instance here is only to show that because of lack of historical knowledge many a times scholars consider the Purvapaksha as the Uttara-paksha and try to weave their arguments, and that sort of debate can only be a joke.  
  

Regards,
