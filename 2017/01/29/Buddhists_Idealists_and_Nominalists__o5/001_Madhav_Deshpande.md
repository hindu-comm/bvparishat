There is a need to modify the characterization of Buddhism as "reliance on tarka, rejection of SabdapramaaNa and rejection of ontological reality". Yes, Buddhism relies on Tarka, but the ultimate experience of bodhi or enlightenment is not tarka, but something like a sākṣātkāra of the truth. The Buddhists of course reject the prāmāṇya of the Veda, but do indeed accept the prāmāṇya of the words of the Buddha, who is called Pramāṇabhūta in the very first verse of Dharmakīrti's Pramāṇavārttika.

  

प्रमाणभूताय जगद्धितैषिणेप्रणम्य शास्त्रे सुगताय तायिने ।

कुतर्कसम्भ्रान्तजनानुकम्पया प्रमाणसिद्धिर्विधिवद् विधीयते ।। १ ।।  

  

There are important articles on the Buddhist notion of the Buddha as Pramāṇa, if anyone is interested. Do the Buddhists categorically reject the ontological reality? The Theravādins and Sarvāstivādins accept ontological reality momentarily existent psychic and physical elements.
The Vijñānavādins accept ontological reality of momentarily existent psychic elements, while rejecting the reality of the material world.
Even the Śūnyavādin Mādhyamika notion of Śūnya or emptiness does mean that there is a universe with zero content. Their emptiness refers to emptiness of a self-sustaining continuous reality, but Nāgārjuna explicitly says that by the word Śūnyatā is equivalent to Pratītyasamutpāda "causally conditioned origin" of everything", and that this view of Śūnyatā for him is the same as Buddha's madhyamā pratipad "Middle Way" between the extremes of some permanently existing reality and total nothingness. Here are Nāgārjuna's words:

  

य: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद: शून्यतां तां प्रचक्ष्महे ।

सा प्रज्ञप्तिरुपादाय प्रतिपत् सैव मध्यमा ।।

  

Here are the beginning verses of Nāgārjuna's Madhyamakakārikā that explain his understanding of the doctrine of Pratītyasamutpāda.

  

अनिरोधमनुत्पादमनुच्छेदमशाश्वतम्।

अनेकार्थमनानार्थमनागममनिर्गमम्॥१॥

यः प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादं प्रपञ्चोपशमं शिवम्।

देशयामास संबुद्धस्तं वन्दे वदतां वरम्॥२॥  

  

Hope this clarifies some of the characterizations of Buddhist views.
