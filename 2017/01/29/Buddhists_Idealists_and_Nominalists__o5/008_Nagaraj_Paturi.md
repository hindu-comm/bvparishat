\>I am most thankful to Prof. Nagaraj Paturi garu for the brief on development of comparative studies and for endorsing the Wikipedia page on Buddhism andModernism.

  

----- May I clarify the following three:

  

1. for the brief on development of comparative studies :  

  

It was tracing the origins of reading western philosophical concepts into the Indian ones wrongly, comparative approach being one of them

  

2.for *endorsing* the Wikipedia page (highlighting mine)

  

It was directing to the Wikipedia page as a quick access point for the bibliography sought

  

3.on Buddhism andModernism.

  

Modernism is different from Modernity which is again different from Western Philosophy. It was a page on Buddhism and Western Philosophy.

  

May forgive me for my pedantry.
