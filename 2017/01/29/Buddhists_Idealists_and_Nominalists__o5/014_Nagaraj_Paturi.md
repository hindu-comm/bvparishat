1\. I did not say, you will be removed from the list. We do not intend to do that too.

  

2\. You are right, moderators are always in a position to disallow mails which do not deserve to be allowed. That is what I said when I said, "We may , in future, have to concede the requests to avoid such material from the list." . 'Avoiding such material' means disallowing such mails only.

  

3\. I was, apart from my moderator's message, was trying to affectionately tell you to avoid creating an image that you might be creating about your approach.

  

4\. I am able to see how much you are emotionally attached to changing the existing chronology in Indian history. I am one of those who , in principle, agree that such a thing should happen.

  

5\. But I think it does not give you a good feeling to be repeatedly told by the majority of your audience that " please don't bring the points that you could not sufficiently substantiate"

  

If you want moderators to take the responsibility of not allowing such messages from repeatedly reaching the audience and help you not to get a feeling of repeated rejection, yes, we will certainly carry out that responsibility.

  

Continuing or not as a member of BVP is always in your hand. We shall not remove you from our side as long as your membership is not harmful to the list. Currently it is not. I am sure, it will not be in future. 

  

Respectfully yours,
