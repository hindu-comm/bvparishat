Correction;

  

Even today, when post-modernism has become the fashion of the day in the Indian universities, particularly in their Social Sciences and Humanities departments, the skepticist roots and skepticist core of post-modernism, often traced to Nietzsche, *post-modernist or post-modernism-loving Indian university academecians* find solace in understanding Buddha as an ancient Nietzsche.

  

*post-modernist or post-modernism-loving Indian university academecians*was missing.
