Dear Sunil ji,

  

As you can see from the PDF file of Prof Kunjunni Raja's paper attached earlier in this thread, Vedanta Desika, one of the greatest scholars of the Srivaishnava tradition, has explicitly said, "na ca gItAshAstrasya shlokasankhyA vyAsAdibhir uktA. arvAcInat tv-avishvasanIyA." (The number of verses in the Gita shastra has not been given by Vyasa and others. It cannot be trusted, because it is a new development.)

  

The absence of additional verses in the text that was taught, learned and memorized (adhyayana-prasiddhy-abhAva, according to Vedanta Desika) and the corresponding divergence in the written manuscripts is therefore a very old issue. You must acknowledge that your perspective on it is obviously diametrically opposite. That remains an issue, even though you set aside the critical edition of the Mahabharata, citing Prof. Sukthankar's alleged change of mind about it the day before he died.

  

Therefore, it would help the discussion on this list if you can briefly explain the criteria you adopted to identify 45 additional verses in your own publication and where they occur, in relation to the well-established vulgate text. The numbers should not only conform to those given in the gItAmAna verse (even if it is of doubtful provenance), but scholars should have convincing reasons to believe that they are based on sound research methodology, including manuscript evidence and primary/secondary citations and a critical study of these different pieces of evidence.  
  
Best regards,

VIdyasankar
