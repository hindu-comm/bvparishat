Dear Ajitiji,  
  

I have followed the Gitamana verse as I don't find any reason as to why I should consider it to be spurious. If you or any other scholars have ***convincing reasons*** to believe that the Critical edition of the Mahabharata is only correct, I will like to be educated on that  
  
I have already shared, with the BVP group, some time ago, the views of the editor of the booklet brought by the Asiatic Society of Bombay which contains the material of the four lectures delivered by Dr. Sukhtankar, just before his death. The Editor of tha booklet does tell us that Dr, Sukhtankar himself negated the the very methodolgy of the critical edition. Dr. Sukhtankar was the Chief Editor of the Critical edition and he laid down the guidelines for making the critical edition.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
