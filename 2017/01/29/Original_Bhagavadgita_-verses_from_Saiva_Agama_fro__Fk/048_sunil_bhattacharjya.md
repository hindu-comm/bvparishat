Dear paturiji,  
  

I have replied to your first question in the two previous mails and one for correction of typo., sent about an hour ago, but they are yet to be approved The question had to be in somewhat details,  
  

Sorry, i missed your second question, which is  

  
\<2. Can you please substantiate your statement "Very few people know that more than twenty verses of the Bhagavad Gita are from Saivagama" pointing us to the more than twenty verses of the Bagavadgita that you had in mind while making this statement? \>  
  

As regards the second question. for several years I have been asking many people as to whether they know that there are agama verses in the Bhagavad gita, but none appeared to know that. BTW, did you find everybody knew that. If so I apologige I was wrong.  
  

Sincerely,  

Sunil KB
