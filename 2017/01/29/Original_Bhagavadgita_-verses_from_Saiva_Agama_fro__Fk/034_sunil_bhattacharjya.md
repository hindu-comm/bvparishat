Dear friends,  

  
The title of the book,,written by me is as follows:  

  

**THE ORIGINAL BHAGAVAD GITA**  
Complete with 747 verses  
(including all the rare verses)  
  

  

*Translation and commentary*  
by  
**Sunil Kumar Bhattacharjya**

I was waiting for Ajitji to read my book as he wrote that he will try to find a copy in the library or get it from someone who has got a copy of that. But it seems that he has changed his mind and he desperately wants me to tell him where I got the 745 verses. **  
**

  
Anybody, who has purchased my book and read it, will clearly see that I have made it specifically clear in the book that all the 700 verses of the commonly available version of the Bhagavad Gita are genuine and they are integral part of the Original Bhagavad Gita.  
  
In the book I have also showed, with the help of columns and rows, that L presented the book as per the Gitamana verse, after restoring the missing verses of Lord krishna, and I marked the missing verses as "rare verses".  
  
The restored verses are common to all the other books claiming to be original Bhagavad Gita, except that their authors were confused and they could not identify and remove the spurious verses in their versions, which made their vesions end up with more than 750 verses, which made their readers also confused as to which are the original 745 verses  
  

I also want to make it clear that the Bhagavad Gita teachings were given by Lord Krishna and Maharshi Krishnadvaipayana Vedavyasa versified that more than five thousand years ago pand I don't think I am as competent as any of them to create any verse of the Bhagavad Gita. I tried to contribute with my translation and commentary.  
  
With great sadness i have to tell you I contacted several Indian scholars within India and abroad to review my book but I did not get any response. Then I contacted a German Indologist and he gladly reviewed the book and permitted me include his foreword in the book.  
  

Regards,
