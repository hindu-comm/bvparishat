I was not desperate and will never be desperate wanted to better understand your claims which you keeping making on every other BVP thread

Thank you for your response and having given your methodology. When I said I don't have or access to your book the question of reading your book doesn't arise. Good to know your views about Gita .As with a view its left to people who have made critical reading on your book to comment if what you say can have acceptability or not.
