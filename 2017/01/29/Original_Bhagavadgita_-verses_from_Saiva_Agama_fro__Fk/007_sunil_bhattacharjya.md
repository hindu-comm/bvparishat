In the Mahabharata, Vaishampayana says in the Bhishma parva as follows:  
  

shat-shatAni savimsAni shlokAnAm prAha keshavah  

arjunah sapta panchashat saptashatim ca sanjayah  

dhritarashtrah slokam ekam GitAyA mAnam ucyate.  

  
The commonly available version does not meet that requirement. Not only that, there are clear indication of gaps in the commonly available version, which shows that certain verses were removed from the Original Bhagavad Gita to make the common version.  
  
The book brought out by me has 336 pages and out of that the preface and the Introduction are covered in 34 pages, which covers the questions such as yours. As the book is out of print I am not in a position tot send you a copy of that now. I have my personal copy with me and I carry it with me wherever I go. Six months ago when I was in Bangaluru the book was with me, but not at time when we met. Hopefully during my next trip to Bangalauru, I should be able to show you the book. It could be that some of the members of BVP from Bangaluru may already be having copy of the book.
