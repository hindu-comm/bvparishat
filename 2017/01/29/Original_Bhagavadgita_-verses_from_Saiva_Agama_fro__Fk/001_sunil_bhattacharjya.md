Thank you Prof. Paturiji,  
  

The Original Bhagavad Gita has the following verse:  
  
संजय उवाच  
राजन्भगवतो वाक्यं निगमागमगर्भितम् ।  
निशम्य स्वस्थमनसा प्रह्वोऽवोचदथार्जुनः ॥१८.७३॥

In this verse, Sanjaya tells king (Dhritarashtra) that hearing with a steady mind, the words of the Lord, full of the essence of the Nigamas and the Agamas, the humble Arjuna said like this.Then follows the nest verse.  

One scholar late E. Vedavyas, in the early nineteen eighties, reported
that indeed as many as twenty one verses of the Bhagavad Gita have been found to correspond to the verses from the Paramesvara Agama and the Sukshma Agama. These two Agamas belong to the list of the early 28 Shaivagamas.  

To my knowledge, the way Vedanta is considered para-vidya as compared to the apara-vidya of the Vedas, that Agamas too are considered as Para-vidya. as compared to the apara-vidya of the Vedas. The Agamas consider the four Vedas to be authentic, but at the same time, to my understanding, they also consider the Vedas to be difficult to understand, whereas the Aganas are direct to understand and easy to follow.

May be we have Agama scholars in this forum, who may like to add more on this.  

Regards,

Sunil KB
