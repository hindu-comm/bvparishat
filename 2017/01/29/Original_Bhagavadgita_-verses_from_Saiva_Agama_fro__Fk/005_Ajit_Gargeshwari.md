I have further question. What is meant by ‘Original Bhagavad Gita’ what is the criteria of including or excluding verses to the proposed ‘Original Bhagavad Gita’. What are the texts manuscripts and printed editions that were consulted in preparing the Original Bhagavad Gita”

Can the report of E. Vedavyas be shared. These details would be helpful to me.



Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
