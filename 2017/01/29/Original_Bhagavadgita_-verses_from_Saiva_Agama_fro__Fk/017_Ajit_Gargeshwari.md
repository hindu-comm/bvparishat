I agree with scholars unless one reads the introductory pages of Sunilji’s edition and understand the methodology he has used and why he has not accepted the critical edition it will be very difficult to pursue this matter further. If Sunilji has difficulty in sharing the introductory part may I request if any other scholars on the list have access to Sunilj’s edition to please share the introduction.
