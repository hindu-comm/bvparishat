Namaste,  
  

The book entitled "The Original Bhagavad Gita, Complete with 745 verses (including all the Rare Verses)", was released in Delhi in May 2014,
under the aegis of the World Association for Vedic Studies (WAVES). It took me almost two and a half decades to complete that book. The book was sold in India and people from Europe and America also ordered it. I have announced about the book-release in the BVP at that time.  
  
The book was sold at Rupees 350/- and if I remember right Shri
Nityananad Misraji expressed in this forum that the price of the book was moderate. In fact I have incurred financial loss in publishing the book, the only happiness I have is that I could bring out the book. The book went out of print about a year ago. I have plan to bring out the next edition with addition of certain allied topics, but it may take some time.  
  

Regards,
