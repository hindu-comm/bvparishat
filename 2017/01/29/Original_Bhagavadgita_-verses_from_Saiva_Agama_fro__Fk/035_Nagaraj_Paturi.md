Can we assume that your version is Dr.E. Vedavyas's and Gondal pith( Gujarat.)'s version minus the verses considered by you to be 'spurious'?

  

Does your book orDr.E. Vedavyas's and Gondal pith( Gujarat.)'s book contain the information on the source of the additional verses than the 700 verses in vogue ?
