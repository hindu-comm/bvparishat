Dear Mamata Dashji,  
  

You are very right. I also wonder why scholars like Abhinava Gupta and other scholars failed to identify the verses which correspond to the Shaivagamas. The Shaivagama verses are present in both the Original Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses and the common version of Bhagavad Gita of 700 verses, but it is the Original Bhgavad Gita of 745 verses, which points that out. That is why it is all the more necessary that scholars need to read the Original Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses.  
  

Regards,
