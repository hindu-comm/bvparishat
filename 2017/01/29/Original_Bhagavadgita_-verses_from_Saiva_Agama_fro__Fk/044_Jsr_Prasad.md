Prof. Bedekar says - "*It must be however, pointed out that the claim of the Editor to have been able to discover and present the authentic BG of 745 verses rests on dubious foundations.*" He has totally rejected the claim referring to Schrader and authenticity of Kashmir recension - as already mentioned by Prof. Kannan. Strangely, Schrader (1930) opined that 14 additional verses were known to Sankara! Prof. Bedekar even refers to Prof.S.K. Belwalkar's article of 1940.
