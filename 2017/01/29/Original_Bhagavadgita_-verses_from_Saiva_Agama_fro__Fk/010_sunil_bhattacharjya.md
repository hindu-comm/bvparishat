Namaste,  
  

Yes, Dr.E. Vedavyas did publish his work and that was preceded by
another work on the the Bhagavad Gita of 745 from Gondal pith in Gujarat. Prof Kulkarni, who,was a Sanskrit professor in Osmania university, commented that Vedavyasa's book was a copy of the Gondal pith version. Both Vedavyasa's and Gondal pith versions have more than 750 verses and cannot be called the version as was told in the Mahabharata. There was another book in Hindi published from Varanasi, and that too was not exactly as per the Mahabharata statement.
