Dear Sunil ji,

  

For the benefit of list members, please specify which text you intend, when you use the term "Original Bhagavad Gita." The verse you cite below, numbered 18.73, will not be found in any of the generally available publications of the Gita and that will lead to confusion for readers about your textual reference.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
