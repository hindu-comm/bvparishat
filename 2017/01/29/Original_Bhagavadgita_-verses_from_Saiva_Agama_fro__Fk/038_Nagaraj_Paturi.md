From the link provided by Prof. Prasad, the book "Ancient Bhagavadgita" by Dr Ekkirala Vedavyas, IAS the following sentences could be seen:

  

> 
> > Original Text of 745-verses with Critical Introduction. A miracle in > history is the rediscovery of the complete text of the Original > Bhagavad-Gita with all its 745 slokas,of which 45 were lost for over > 2000 years from popular circulation. Thus the common man loosing the > complete "The sermon of God".
> > 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > This is now printed with the rediscovered slokas demarked for a > comparative study and for the first time made available to the general > public beyond the learned and the Research Scholar's desk. >
> 
> > 
> >   
> > 

It does not provide information about how the 'rediscovery' happened.

  

May be the book has it, may be it does not have.

  

I am looking for the info on Sri Gondal Pith's publication.
