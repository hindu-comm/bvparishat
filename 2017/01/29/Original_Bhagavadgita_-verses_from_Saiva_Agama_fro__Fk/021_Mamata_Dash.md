With regards to the Vidvans, there are more than one hundred commentaries available on Bhagavadgita. The commentaries have been arranged school wise in the New Catalogus Catalogorum. may be the Sivadvaita Com.(Arthasangraha) Abhinava Gupta would have focused on the verses related to Saiva. And the Com. of Nilakantha on the whole Mahabharata can also be taken into consideration, as he declares that he collected the reading for diff. parts of the country. We need to have critical edition of the text.
