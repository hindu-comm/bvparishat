==============================Moderator's note=========================

  

This thread is being closed with this concluding note.

  

Sri Sunil Bhattacharyaji was given a full hearing.

  

All that he is able to say is that the number of verses in his book correspond to the number mentioned in Gitamana verses.  

  

He did not tell the forum his source, methodology and the validity of either of them.

  

He did not substantiate the claim that lead to the present thread by pointing the forum to any Saiva agama verses in Bhagavad Gita of any version or edition.

  

He thinks that because people do not know that there are agama verses in Bh G, his statement "Very few people know that more than twenty verses of the Bhagavad Gita are from Saivagama' is valid.

  

When I say "very few people know that there are flowers in the sky or hare has horns" , I can not say that since people do not know these , my statement is valid. My statement can not be valid unless and until I show or prove that there are flowers in the sky or hare has horns.

  

Sri Sunilji already said he has nothing more to say.

  

Sorry for keeping you all waiting, with the hope that the reward for which all scholars wait, a new learning might result, all in vain.
