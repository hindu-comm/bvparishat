All this curiosity and my questions could have been answered at the outset if you had said my edition of Bhagvad Gita covers the points I have raised. You could have simply attached the introduction pages as the book is out of print I am not asking you for the entire book. It’s your book and your painfully carried out research and you have the right to share or not as it is your material. I will look for the book either from you directly or from libraries if they do have a copy. Even now I don’t know anything about the report of report of E. Vedavyas. Thank you

In the Mahabharata, Vaishampayana says in the Bhishma parva as follows:

shat-shatAni savimsAni shlokAnAm prAha keshavah

arjunah sapta panchashat saptashatim ca sanjayah

dhritarashtrah slokam ekam GitAyA mAnam ucyate.

  
The commonly available version does not meet that requirement. Not only that, there are clear indication of gaps in the commonly available version, which shows that certain verses were removed from the Original Bhagavad Gita to make the common version.  
  
The book brought out by me has 336 pages and out of that the preface and the Introduction are covered in 34 pages, which covers the questions such as yours. As the book is out of print I am not in a position tot send you a copy of that now. I have my personal copy with me and I carry it with me wherever I go. Six months ago when I was in Bangaluru the book was with me, but not at time when we met. Hopefully during my next trip to Bangalauru, I should be able to show you the book. It could be that some of the members of BVP from Bangaluru may already be having copy of the book.

I have further question. What is meant by ‘Original Bhagavad Gita’ what is the criteria of including or excluding verses to the proposed ‘Original Bhagavad Gita’. What are the texts manuscripts and printed editions that were consulted in preparing the Original Bhagavad Gita”

Can the report of E. Vedavyas be shared. These details would be helpful to me.
