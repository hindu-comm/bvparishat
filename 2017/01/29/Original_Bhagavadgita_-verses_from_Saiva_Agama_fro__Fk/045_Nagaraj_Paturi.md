Now to Sri Sunilji,

  

Can you kindly directly answer the following?  

  

1\. Is your edition based on this Gondal Pith edition or you had access to a source independent of and different from the one used or claimed to have been used by the compiler of the Gondal Pith book ?

  

2\. Can you please substantiate your statement "Very few people know that more than twenty verses of the Bhagavad Gita are from Saivagama" pointing us to the more than twenty verses of the Bagavadgita that you had in mind while making this statement?
