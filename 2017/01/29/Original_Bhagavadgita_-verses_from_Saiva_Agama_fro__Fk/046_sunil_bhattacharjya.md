No you cannot ssume that. Vedavyasa had mutilated the very first verse in his book and he selected most of the rest of the verses from the Gondal pith. papers. However Vedavyas checked whether any of the verses of the Bhagavad Gita correspond to the Agamas ,  
  

Real good work was done by one of the past Swamijis of the Gondal pith, who brought out the original Bhagavad Gita from an old manuscript found in Varanasi. Gondal pith published the details of that in some of the journals produced from the pith and then brought out their book. The verse mentioning the Agamas was very much there in their journals, but they did not include that in their version, probably thinking that there cannot be verses from the agamas.  

  

Both Vedavyas and Gondal pith-swami were not sure whether all the verses in the common edition of the Bhagavad Gita are genuine or not, but on my part I did not think anybody would have presented any fake verse in the common edition. My feeling is that Bhaskaracharya has most probably dropped the verses from the original Bhagavad Gita, which is non-sectarian, and by dropping the verses he could try to bring a vaishnavite bias in it. Earlier I was thinking of the possibility that both the vulgate and the original versions could have existed for long time before that.  
  

I am glad that like Ajitji, you are also very keen to know how the original Bhagavad gita. corresponding to the Gitamana verse has been presented for the first time. Nobody wants to do this type of thankless job.
