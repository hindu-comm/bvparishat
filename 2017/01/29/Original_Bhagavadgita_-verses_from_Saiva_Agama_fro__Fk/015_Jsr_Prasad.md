Prof. Mamata ji raised an important question in connection with the claim on original Bhagavad-Gita. Until the underlying methodology is detailed, debate can't proceed further.

  

The verse from Bhishma-parvan describing verses beyond 700 is interesting. I would suggest Sunil ji to verify the same with BORI's research on 27,000 interpolated verses in Mahabharata. Do not know whether this is in or out of that purview.  
  
Scanned preface or introduction of the book may help scholars here to to better understand the perspective.
