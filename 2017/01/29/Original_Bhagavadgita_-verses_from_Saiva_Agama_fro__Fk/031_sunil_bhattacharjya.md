Dear Vidyashankarji,  
  

Unfortunately for Vedantadeshika, he did not know that the north-Indian editions of the Mahabharata, have that Gitamana verse. More than a century ago, Wsternitz was one, who initated the move about the need to prepare the critical edition as the south-Indian edition and the north -indian editions of the Mahabharata do not match. That to my mind was the beginning of the movement, which culminated in the critical edition, which however seems to have been negated later by Dr.Sukhtankar himself, if the editor of Asiatic Society of (Bombay) book on his lectures, is to be believed.  
  

In another forum, I expressed my apprehension that Adi Shankara might not have written a bhashya on the Bhagavad Gita, as Prof. Karmarkar seems to have opined from linguisic study on the Shankarabhshya. He said that the Shanakara bhashyas, other that the Bbhashya on the Bhagavad gita, appeared to have come from a mature person. If that is the case, the first Bhagavad gita bashya could have been written by Bhaskaracharya, and Abhinava Shankara could have refuted it verse by verse.
