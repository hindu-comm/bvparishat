Dear friends,  
  

I have a request. I have written the book "Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses". Please count that in case any of you have the book, and check whether it corresponds to the Gitamana verse of the Mahabharata or not. I am surprised that nobody seems have counted the verses in the Vedavyasa's edition and the Gondalpith edition to check whether they really correspond to the Gitamana verse or not. Also if you have time and inclination, you may also check the number of verses in all the editions (available to you) of the vulgate bversion of the Bhagavad Gita, to see whether all the editions have exactly 700 verses or not.  
  

Secondly, when the next edition comes out with additional materials, and of course the publisher will not agree to sell at the same old price, you may if you think necessary, browse through the book and satisfy yourself, before purchase.  
  

Dr. Belvalkar could have been a Sanskrit scholar, as he was professor of Sanskrit in Banares Hindu University, and to me knowledge he edited the Bhshma parve, but I don't think that one should think thatDr. Belvalkar could not have been wrong, now that very guidelines of the critical edition appears to be have been negated by the chief editor, Dr. Sukhtankar.exact Somewhere (I do not recollect the work of Prof. Belvalkar) I found him saying that he was born on the Gita Jayanti day, and seemed to have felt blessed with that and I wonder if he really checked the tithi of his birthday. If anybody knows the tithi and that birthday of that great personality, he or she may kindly let me know that.  
  

Regards,
