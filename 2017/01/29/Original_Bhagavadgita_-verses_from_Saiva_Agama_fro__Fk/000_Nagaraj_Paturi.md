Namaste,  
  
Congratulations for organizing national seminar on Saivagama. Due to logistical obstacles I would not be able to attend that, but hope that the proceedings will be published.  
  

Very few people know that more than twenty verses of the Bhagavad Gita are from Saivagama and that is why in the original Bhagavad Gita there is a verse, where Sanjaya says that Lord Krishna has given teacings from both Agana and Nigama. Somebody at some stage deleted that verse as well as quite some more verses from the Original Bhagavad Gita and one would not find that verse of Sanjaya in the vulgate version of the Bhagavad Gita.  

  

Sri Bhattacharyaji shall provide evidence for his claims here in this thread.
