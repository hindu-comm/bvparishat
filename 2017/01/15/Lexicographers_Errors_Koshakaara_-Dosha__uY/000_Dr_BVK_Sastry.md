Namaste



Wishing a Shubha ‘Makara Sankranti’, when the Sun Changes the directions of travel.



I am taking this as an inspiration to initiate this thread, as more and more posts are bringing focus on terms and take online resources as infallible authority. I do not want to make any allusion to the famous narrative of Yajnavalkya and the ‘ shift in the received accents for the Shukla- Yajur-Veda’ making it a special study in Yajur-veda. I am restricting to the mundane ‘**lexicographers errors’** which are different from the ‘Scribe –errors’ who is under the oath to copy faithfully the dead fly on the original in to the copy !



**Question**: **When can we as a team of Samskruth Lovers start a study like this ?** ( Interested ones, please contact me off line).



The purpose is to reemphasize the need often repeated by me to the point of boring : There is a Critical need for thorough review of almost every conceivable online Samskruth Lexicon resource ; and the reference line to begin with could be the documents available at url : <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/>

Here seems to be a cutout work of contemporary relevance for all Samskruth lovers, Scholars , Swadesi- Indology Seekers and Battle : Sanskrit enthusiasts.



What triggered my sense of humor and curiosity is the Devanagari entry in Vachaspatyam – Online resource, related to a Buddhist term. The ten vows of Buddhists drawn from Sarvadarshana Sangraha was ported in to Shabda kalpa druma; and the printed text-word in original ‘ cheeram’ was key-intranscribed as ‘ Choram’; The term ‘Sutrantika’ was key-in-transcribed as ‘ Mootrantika’.



The curios investigation took me to take a look at the Digital library scanned copy , where the original paper manuscript in old Sanskrit typography (Bengal types in the paper of poor quality) was fuzzy; and could be read only at high magnification .



The Text –Key in scribe may have mistaken the word or misread the word. The outcome ends in disastrous and hilarious !



I place the suggested initial reading for this deliberation as the the WIKI page entry : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_error> , The Google Book: <https://books.google.com/books?id=ZV5iAAAAcAAJ&pg=PR3&lpg=PR3&dq=lexicographers+errors&source=bl&ots=lkDLwaeIpt&sig=vpAdUUfqvuNqwkbMl9lOxomQRqc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1tMK7tMLRAhVmjVQKHWI1AAEQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=lexicographers%20errors&f=false> - The Grammatical Art Improved: in which the Errors of Grammarians and lexicographers
