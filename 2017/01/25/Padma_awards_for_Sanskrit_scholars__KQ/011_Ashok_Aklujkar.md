Dear Dr. Prasad,  
  
I did not notice the typo until you pointed it out. Even if I had noticed it earlier, my reaction to it, in view of the elation you gave rise to through your appreciation of Pt. Ca. Mū. Krishna Sastry’s work, would have been similar to the reaction I expressed in a 1963/1964 verse:  
  
काव्यामृतेन तृप्तानां किं नो व्याकृति-चिन्तया ।  
बिम्बोष्ठी यदि बिम्बौष्ठी न प्रतीमो रसे भिदाम् ।।  
  
a.a.
