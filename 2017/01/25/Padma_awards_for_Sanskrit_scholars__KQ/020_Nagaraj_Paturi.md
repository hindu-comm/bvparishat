Prof. Ashok Aklujkar made all the relevant points.

  

Sri Chaa. Mu. Krishna Shastryji deserves greater honor and let us wait for that to come.

  

As a fan of Prof. Michel Danino and his writings I am ecstatic about the honor to him.

  

I join all other list members in congratulating all the awardees.

  

We will all be glad to know about other awardees from the list members who know.
