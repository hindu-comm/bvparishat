I profusely congratulate the padma- awardees emerging from the world of Sanskrit. My special greetings are with Sri cha. Muu. Krishna shaastriy ji, synonymous of spoken Sanskrit, who is an inspiring elderly friend of mine since thirty five years. I also greet Sri Danino ji who is an embodiment of dedicated research and whom I know since a decade.
