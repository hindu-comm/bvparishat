I would be delighted to receive information about and evaluation of the contributions of Deviprasad Dwivedi (UP) and Harihar Kripalu Tripathi (UP) — information beyond what one gets through googling or Wikipedia and evaluation from qualified specialists.

  

I think a more appropriate honour for Chamu \[-Krishna Shastry (Delhi) would have been Padma Bhushan. The magnitude of the network he has built, the vision he has shown and the steadfastness with which he has pursued his objective deserve a higher recognition. Anyway, hearty congratulations to him and to Dr Michel Danino (Tamil Nadu), from whose way of dealing with history the young Sanskritists of India have much to learn.
