Namaste

Congratulations to all the awardees.

  

The Spoken Sanskrit movement - which started around '70's with a statement like ' अयं दीप:'- has achieved the mission- prajvaalito jnanamayah pradeepaH' !

  

Michel Daninos writings have provided the right footing to review the need for ground archaeology research and native studies initiative to rewrite the itihaasa of Bhaarateeyas. Congradulations Danino. There are many more Dholaviras to explore!
