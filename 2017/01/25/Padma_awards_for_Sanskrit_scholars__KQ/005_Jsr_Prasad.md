It is heartening to see five Sanskrit scholars are being honored with the Padma Awards. The DNA report rightly said - *The focus of this year's Padma awards, according to the officials in the Home Ministry, was on recognising talent of unknown and unsung heroes of the country.* Kudos to the nominating team which nominated them. The awardees' list looks elegant, embellished by our dear Sanskrit scholars. Movie artists, rather the 'stars/celebrities,' did not appear in the list! What a beauty after several years.  
  

Sri Chamu Krishna Shastry Ji richly deserves this award for making spoken Sanskrit his life mission. Under his inspiring guidance, Samskrita Bharati, anchored firmly the cherished Indian values of Sanskrit into the lifestyle of masses and elite circle as well. This is a befitting honor to the dedicated, passionate scholars at Aksharam and thousands of SB volunteers in India and abroad. What could be a better occasion than this? Hope, the list may continue further with many such unsung heroes contributing in different fields.  
  

Prof. Michel Danino equally deserves this award as his contributions in ancient Indian archeology and history, ancient Indian S&T besides his ongoing contributions to ICHR, did not go unnoticed.  

  

My pranams to the respected senior scholars honored with Padmavibhushan. Thanks Nityananda ji for posting in the forum.  
  

Dhanyosmi,  

Prasad
