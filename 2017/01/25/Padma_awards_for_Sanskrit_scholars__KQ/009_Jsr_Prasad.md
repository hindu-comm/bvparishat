Respected Prof. Akulujkar sir,  
  

You just articulated what many of us have in our minds. Thanks for that! I just got a message forwarded in a whats app group; with utmost modesty, Sri Shastry Ji responded as follows:  
  

*पद्मश्रीः इति अलङ्करणं यद् अद्य घोषितं तद् वस्तुतः संस्कृतभारत्यै, तस्याः 35 वर्षाणां तपस्यायै तथा च विद्यमानेभ्यः संस्कृतभारत्याः समर्पणशीलेभ्यः कार्यकर्तृभ्यः प्रदीयमानं गौरवम् । अहं तु संस्कृतभारत्याः प्रतिनिधिमात्रम् ।*

We pray for the conferment of Padmavibhushan on him, very soon.
