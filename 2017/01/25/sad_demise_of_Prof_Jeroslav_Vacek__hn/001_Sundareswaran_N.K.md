We the faculty and students of the Department of Sanskrit, University of Calicut deeply mourn the sad demise of Prof. Jeroslav Vacek. He had a long and close association with our Department. He was a renowned scholar and ardent lover of Sanskrit and India. More than that, he was a good human being who loved all fellow-beings.

We feel contented that we could do our best to take care of Prof. Vacek when he was hospitalized, all of a sudden, in a private hospital in Calicut. He had to undergo a major surgery. He was all alone here. His son could arrive only after one week. And it took nearly one month's time to make necessary arrangements to airlift Prof. Vacek to Czech.

Prof. Vacek loved India and two classical Indian languages - संस्कृतम् and தமிழ்.
