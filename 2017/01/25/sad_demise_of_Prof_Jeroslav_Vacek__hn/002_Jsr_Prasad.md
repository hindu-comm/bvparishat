It is very sad to know that Prof. Vacek is no more. As expressed by Prof. NKS ji, he was a good human being and decent mannered. With the collaboration of a professor in life sciences, in our University, we interacted with Prof. [Vacek](http://ujca.ff.cuni.cz/UJCA-353.html) more than once. He was the chief editor of the esteemed international journal '[Pandanus](http://iu.ff.cuni.cz/pandanus/publications/)' in which, many scholarly papers published. His work on Indian plant database and Sanskrit e-texts is highly acknowledged. We deeply mourn his demise and pray for his *svarloka-praapti.*
