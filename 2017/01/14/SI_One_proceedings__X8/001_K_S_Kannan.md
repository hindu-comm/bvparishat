Dear Nityananda Misra,  
  

The volume has not been published yet.  
  

As there was much of purva-paksha in many papers, we thought the uttara-paksha (being presented in SI-2) too should come along together. There are also a few other issues, and some new ideas regarding the logistics of publication.  
  

The books will be out before this June. The book is meant for the public, and its publication will immediately be announced on BVP. And as a participant, you will receive your copy, too.  
  

Regards  

KSKannan
