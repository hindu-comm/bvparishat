Namaste,  
  

There is a story (which I heard in the childhood). that Ravana, in fact, was a Vishnu-bhakta and that he wanted to die in the hands of Lord Ram at the earliest, and thus get liberated. That is why he kidnapped Mother Sita. Any member knowing the source of the story, may kindly let us know.  
  

Regards,
