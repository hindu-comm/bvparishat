कृत्तिवासा means covered with a skin

  

Remember Mahaperiyavaa giving the meaning as covered with elephant skin

  

And here in page 79 it is depicted as tiger skin.. ( parame vruksha aayudham nidhaaya...)

<http://sanskritdocuments.org/articles/ShriRudramChamakam_PRKannan.pdf>  

  

  

  

Which is correct?
