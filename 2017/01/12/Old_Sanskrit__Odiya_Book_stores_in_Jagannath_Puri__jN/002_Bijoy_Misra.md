It is best to contact a local Matha. The Govadhnana Matha (Sanksracharya) is

the oldest. There is a Gaudiya Matha also, who could be helpful.

The Temple has a book store.

Much of the material is in manuscript form. There is a manuscript depository

in the Museum at Bhubaneswar. Quite a bit material is believed to be still in

remote locations in the villages.
