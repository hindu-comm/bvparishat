\>Pratyuttaram: Indian Textual Criticism= bhAratIya-kAvya-vimarsha- paddhatiH.

  

These two are absolutely two different arts and/or sciences.

  

Both the scholars in the previous posts have been using the word Textual Criticism in its specific correct sense which is different from the meaning ofbhAratIya-kAvya-vimarsha- paddhatiH.

  

Textual Criticism is the science and art of analyzingvarious (mostly manuscript) versions of a text, not necessarily a kAvya, and deciding the most 'authentic' or 'original' version for the purpose of printing /publishing the'authentic' or 'original' version along with the different pAThabhEdAh for specific minute portions of the text, usually provided as foot notes.

  

kAvya vimars'a is literary criticism of poetry.

  

kAvya vimars'a in Sanskrit is an age-old activity reflected mostly in alankAra works, sometimes in the commentaries of poetic works, sometimes in the metapoetic portions within the poetic texts themselves, whereas textual criticism of Sanskrit manuscripts is a modern activity.

  

The thread initiating post was seeking information about a Sanskrit medium book on this modern field. The responding post provided that information. Sanskrit medium books on such modern fields are a proof of modern living /life of Sanskrit.

  

Many scholars are aware of and are often good at the art of textual criticism but may not be aware that it has the specific name of textual criticism.
