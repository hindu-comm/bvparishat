Not related to your question directly but all DLI has scanned are getting uploaded to archives without their meta information not getting corrected here

<https://archive.org/details/digitallibraryindia>

I simply don’t know how to search in this collection. This collection will have some very rare and hard to find Sanskrit and Historical books
