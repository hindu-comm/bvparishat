Dear Shri Vishvasji,

  

  Thanks for posting this informative document introducing Dr. Pushpa Dikshit's new Kaumudi. Can you please provide publication details for this work. I am looking forward to seeing this work. I don't see this publication in the catalogue of the University of Michigan Library.
With best wishes,
