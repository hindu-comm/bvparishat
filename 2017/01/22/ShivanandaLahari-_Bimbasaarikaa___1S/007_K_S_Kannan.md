An even more charming example obtains in *  
Campū* *Rāmāyaṇa* (in the **prose** immediately preceding 1.6), where poetry ejaculates from the mouth of Vālmīki (the *ādi*-*kavi*) - at the piteous sight of the maimed and wriggling blood-stained Krauñca bird:  

***"chandomayī kācid evam nissasāra sarasvatī,"***  

which is a veritable half of a *śloka (*i.e*. anuṣṭubh),  
*

very well exemplifying the transformation of  
*śoka* into *śloka*!
