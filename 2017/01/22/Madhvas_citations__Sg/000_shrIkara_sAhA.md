Apart from BNK Sharma,who else criticized Mesquita's work on the citations of Madhva that are not traceable?  
  

Kiyokazu Okita briefly mentions that Madhva's skAnda purANa quotes may not be fictitious as they could have been coming from an older recension of the purANa that is edited by Andriaensen, Bakker and Issacson in the Netherlands. Apart from that,are there any other articles on this issue raised by Mesquita by Madhva scholars or anyone else?  
  

(If anyone is curious about that article of Okita I mentioned,here is the link to it <https://www.academia.edu/31018257/Quotation_Quarrel_and_Controversy_in_Early_Modern_South_Asia_Appayya_D%C4%ABk%E1%B9%A3ita_and_J%C4%ABva_Gosv%C4%81m%C4%AB_on_Madhvas_Untraceable_Citations> )  
  

Thanking in advance.
