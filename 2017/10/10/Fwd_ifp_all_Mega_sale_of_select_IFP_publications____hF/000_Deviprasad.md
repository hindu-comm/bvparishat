Dear all,

In order to reduce the stock of some of our old publications, we are planning a mega sale of these publications with discounts ranging from 50% to 80%. These discounts will be applicable only on select publications (see Excel file attached containing 3 sheets, one each for Indology, Ecology and Social Sciences), for a limited period, i.e. 16th October to 15th November 2017, and till stocks last.

Some more details:  
- The discounts will be applied on all orders received directly by us, whether by post or on spot.  
- The discounts will be valid only between 16th Oct and 15th Nov 2017.  
- The discount will be on rupee rates within India and on Euro rates outside India.  
- The discounts will be applied subject to a minimum order of 500 RS / 10 EUR (net total)  
- Packing and postage charges will be extra.  
- Discounts will be given only to those who make the full payment in advance.  

We request you to profit from this exceptional sale -- being held for the first time -- to purchase some of the titles that may be of interest to you, and also to inform all those around you, friends, colleagues, who are likely to be interested.

Thank you,  
With best wishes,
