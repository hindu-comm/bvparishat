नमस्ते श्रीमन् देवीप्रसाद-महोदय !

Thanks for a very inviting message !

Please clarify how one would send the money in advance.  

I guess that

people will inform you the books of their interest.

You will send them a Proforma Invoice inclusive of postage and also inform them

1.  your Bank-Branch Name and Account No.

People will remit the amount to your account and you will send the books.  

Actually you could have mentioned this procedure and the relevant Bank-details in your message itself. You may do it even now by a supplementary message.
