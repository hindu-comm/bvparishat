Here is a request. I am looking for a verse of Sri Nilakantha Dikshita which translates to this:  
  
//Always keeping the rosary in the hand, occasionally opening oneâ€™s eyes and declaring that everything is Brahman are sure ways of creating a good impression.//  
  
In case you are able to locate the original verse, please share the reference, that is, the name of the book and the number of the verse therein.  
  
Thanking you,
