Have you seen any edition of *Roget's Thesaurus* in recent years, or even decades,

where the Introduction/Preface mentions even casually his knowledge of Amera Cosha, as he calls it?

  

Here are hypocrites clamouring for Intellectual Property Rights!

Conmen in academic outfits crying foul at plagiarism!

  

That sums up a good many of the "intellectually honest" West.

(exceptions exempted)
