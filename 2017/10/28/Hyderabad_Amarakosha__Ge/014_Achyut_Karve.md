Dear Scholars,

It is my feeling that this is not a forum to score points.

Sanskrit is a generative language. To look at it as a language of the day is doing disservice to Sanskrit because today languages create a vast vocabulary by importing words from other languages as they do not have a mechanism of generating new words. But to be capable of generating new words in Sanskrit one not only needs to have a good grip over Sanskrit grammar but also an aesthetic ear so that one is capable of distinguishing between a word (शब्द) and a non word (अपशब्द).

The question is not whether गणेश appears in the Amarkosha or not but whether it is a well formed word or not and whether it conveys the intended sense or not.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
