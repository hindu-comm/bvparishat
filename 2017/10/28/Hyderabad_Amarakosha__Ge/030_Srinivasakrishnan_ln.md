Well, let me tell you a story. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams published a 'History of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams' in 1953. The first edition had a Foreword by the then Chief Minister of Madras Presidency, the late Rajaji who was the prime mover behind the history project. Post 1953, Madras Presidency was partitioned into Telugu and Tamil speaking provinces. The Tirupati area fell in the Telugu speaking province so the temple and its admin body, the TT Devasthanam, from then on came under the purview of the then Andhra Pradesh. The 'History' which till date is in print has never had Rajaji's Foreword after the first edition.

  

This happened in our time and in our geography. It's not anything abstract like Sanskrit or some 6th century author or some Victorian era book. It's a work on a temple which millions of people visit today. So what can this anomaly be attributed to? Some due diligence is called for before one attributes hypocrisy, foul play, intellectual dishonesty, linguistic chauvinism or something else. Meanwhile, I find the 'History' rather useful. The TTD have been faithfully printing the original work of the author, Sri TKT Viraraghavacharya, edition after edition without any addition or modification but without the Foreword to the first edition. This too happens.

  

I was merely pointing out that 'thesaurus' may be a better translation for 'kośa' and also that the Preface to the First Edition of Roget's work that you alluded to in your subsequent mail is available in Google Books for anyone to see. That's all.
