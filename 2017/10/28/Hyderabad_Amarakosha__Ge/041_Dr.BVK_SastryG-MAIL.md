Namaste



If this ‘ Kosha’ Thesaurus model reference existed as early as 1883, what made the Indian Oriental scholars overlook the mapping of the word ‘ Kosha’ as ‘Dictionary’ ? And did not press to include the true sense of ‘- 'nāma-liṅgānuśāsanam ‘ as the communication from the term ‘Amara- Kosha’ ?



See the images attached.



Why did different lexicon makers use different ‘Word- Meaning Map’ to build the ‘ Sanskrit -Dictionary’ ? For whose benefit ?



MW dictionary came in 1872. ( and many other dictionaries of Sanskrit came since 1832 ! - <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/> ) . Apte’s dictionary came in 1890.



Wilson (1832) lists the meaning of this word as 17 A dictionary or vocabulary. f. (-षी)
(<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/WILScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php>
)



See link entry :
<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MW72Scan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=0256>



And why attribute ‘hypocrisy’ only one section of scholars for the failure of the native scholars to take care of the ‘ Home Tradition and Guard it’ ? 

Nay promote the inaccurate model and tools of Sanskrit studies ?? So what is Battle: Sanskrit for ??



**So on whom should one place the burden of ‘ diluting, distorting
Samskrutham to Sanskrit ? Tolerating the same ? Proliferating the inappropriate model’ please ? Translators or Traditionalists ? The damage is not only in understanding ‘Samskrutham of Vedas’ ; but also the ‘ Darshana –Shaastra and Veda –Vijnana’. **
