नमस्ते श्री अभ्यङ्करवर्याः,

  

Nice to see your elaborations. Even, I thought of the same. That is why I said, 'He did something highly innovative in the Kosha tradition.' Because, Yaska Rishi was the क्रान्तदर्शी who says - समाम्नायः समाम्नातः... छन्दोभ्यः समाहृत्य समाहृत्य समाम्नातः । A kind of ontological approach invented by him, must have inspired the Buddhist scholar, Amara. As you put it right about the structure of the Kosha, other senior scholars also expressed the same.  

  

One may be interested to read a relevant paper, related to Amara and Roget, from here - <http://www.languageinindia.com/june2004/amarkosh.html>
