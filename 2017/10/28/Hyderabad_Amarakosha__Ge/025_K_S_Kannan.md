It is a fact that Roget's Thesaurus was modelled after Amara-kos'a.

He chose the word Thesaurus as it also means kos'a in the sense of a treasury.

He has tried to criticise the arrangement of Amara,

It is another matter that subsequent editions of Roget's Thesaurus

have hushed up his indebtedness to Amara-kos'a.

  

He had seen Colebrooke's translation of Amara-kos'a into English
