Namaste Prof. Abhyankar

  

There is one more important etymology from puraaNaa's that cannot be ignored.  

  

nāyakena vinā devi tava bhūtopi putrakaḥ ॥  
yasmāja jātasa tato nāmnā bhaviṣyati vināyakaḥ ॥vamana purāṇ 28.71-72  
  
vinā kṛtā nāyakena yat tvaṃ devi mayā śubhe ।  
eṣa tatra samutpannas tava putro rkasamnibhaḥ ॥  
nāyakena vinā jāto yasmād eva gajānanaḥ ।  
tammad vināyako nāmanā bhaviṣyati sureśvari ॥ skanda purāṇa  

  

Above etymology also conforms the the Gaṇeśā's name from aṣṭottaraśata nāmāvali "dvayamāturāya" (having TWO MOTHERS), because he is "ayonijaka" .
