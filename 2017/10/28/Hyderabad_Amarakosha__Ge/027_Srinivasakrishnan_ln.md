\> It is another matter that subsequent editions of Roget's Thesaurus  

\> have hushed up his indebtedness to Amara-kos'a.

  

The 1883 edition of Roget's Thesaurus is available for download as a PDF in Google Books. It does have the Preface to the First Edition (1852). The reference to the Amarakośa and its translation by HT Colebrooke (1808) can be seen on page xxviii of the PDF. Note however that the displayed google book appears to be a different edition, so the pagination varies from that of the PDF.

  

Hope this helps,
