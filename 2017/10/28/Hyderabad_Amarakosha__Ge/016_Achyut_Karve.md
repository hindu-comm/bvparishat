Dear Marcis Gasuns,

The following para I had drafted in response to your previous mail. The system of interpreting one language by means of another is a flawed one. One will only appreciate the nicities of a language in terms of another when one is proficient in both of them.

"The attempt to interpret words without the context ie. that of the sentence, through a dictionary is primarily the work of the West and is the main cause for all the doubts. The West designed this practice in the colonial era for the sake of administration and extended it for literary works. Thus the system of appreciating Sanskrit in the West is basically flawed. Patanjali in his first Anhik of the Mahabhashya has explained the purpose of the Ashtadhyayi in detail."

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.

Dear Scholars,

It is my feeling that this is not a forum to score points.

Sanskrit is a generative language. To look at it as a language of the day is doing disservice to Sanskrit because today languages create a vast vocabulary by importing words from other languages as they do not have a mechanism of generating new words. But to be capable of generating new words in Sanskrit one not only needs to have a good grip over Sanskrit grammar but also an aesthetic ear so that one is capable of distinguishing between a word (शब्द) and a non word (अपशब्द).

The question is not whether गणेश appears in the Amarkosha or not but whether it is a well formed word or not and whether it conveys the intended sense or not.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.

Not exactly, but sure a lot I understood. The links on thepage to .pdfs are not working.  
So there is no additional markup as of who is the object of description, right? Thanks.  
And last thing, a possible improvementin the search UI<https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/Cologne/issues/156>
