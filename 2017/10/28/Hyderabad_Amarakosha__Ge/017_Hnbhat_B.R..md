This discussion seems go fancifully beyond the subject matter of this thread: the omission of the word "ganesa" in the Hyderabad Edn. of Amarakosa which is a fact that the word गणेश the synonym of the the son of the gods शम्भु is missing in the text according to the scheme of Amarasimha and it could not be found on searching in the edition. The answer is clear.

And explained by many.

  

Then the question to be asked how he found in the annotated text Marcis had used and how the name गणेश was added of his own in the text of Amara as the synonym? Instead the discussion goes on etymologies of other words as they occur and the discussing continues. Karve has already given a answer thatAmarkosha is not a dictionary and explained its nature.  
Hence it cannot be expected to contain each and every word like the dictionary.

  

Sorry I interference among the discussion.
