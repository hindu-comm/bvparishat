Dear Scholars,

Patanjali in his Mahabhashya says that as it is not possible to list all the words (chaste) of a language therefore as a remedy this can be achieved by the rules of grammar.

We should also remember that Amarkosha is not a dictionary. It was a first attempt at a Thesaurus and that too poetic, so that it can be easily committed to memory.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
