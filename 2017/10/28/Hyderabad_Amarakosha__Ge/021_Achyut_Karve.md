Dear Abhyankarji,

So by no means it can be called a Sanskrit Dictionary because as the name suggests it is Amarsingh's Dictionary.

"diction (n.)  
1540s, "a word;" 1580s, "expression of ideas in words," from Late Latin dictionem (nominative dictio) "a saying, expression, word," noun of action from dic-, past participle stem of Latin dicere "speak, tell, say" (source of French dire "to say"), related to dicare "proclaim, dedicate," from PIE root \*deik- "to show," also "pronounce solemnly."

In the above sense the Amarkosha is a dictionary par excellence. Thus the intention of a dictionary need not be to tell the meaning. In this sense is not the modern usage of the word dictionary itself misplaced.

One can now if he wishes say that Amarsingh either did know the word गणपति or that he did not find it necessary to include it in his कोष.

With regards,  
Achyut Karve.
