Dear Mr. Marcis,

  

The link given by you to "amara101"-html page seems to be a German interpretation of the अमरकोश. An interpretation will always have the bias of the interpreter. Hence we need to be cautious about treating any interpretation to be the only interpretation or the final word. Your query about the word गणेश being in the original text of अमरकोश itself is good. So one needs to search the original text of अमरकोश only, not in any interpretation of अमरकोश.

  

The problem with अमरकोश would be that it cannot be expected to list all the names of all deities. For example, there is विष्णुसहस्रनामस्तोत्रम् where one gets 1000 names of Lord Vishnu. Can one expect अमरकोश to give all those 1000 names ? Likewise there is महागणपतिस्तोत्रम् excerpted from नारदपुराणम्, wherein we have at least twelve names of Lord Ganesh.

  

The fact of the matter also is that most of the names of deities are adjectival. Adjectives tend to become names by ardent association. गणेश has become name of गणपति the elephant-headed deity. As such there is no difference in the meanings of the two words गणेशand गणपति also. Even the other well-known name विनायक is also adjectival only (विशेषः नायकः इति विनायकः) one, who is special among leaders. Can we not grant that Alexander the Great was also विनायकः ?

  

My humble submission would be that let us take अमरकोश to be what it is, not attaching too much of expectations, which may often prove to be extraneous.
