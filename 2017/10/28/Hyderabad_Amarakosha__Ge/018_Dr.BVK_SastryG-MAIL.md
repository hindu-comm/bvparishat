Namaste



1. Nirukti using Prakriyaa is the way to decode and extract meaning from ‘Samskrutham –Padam’ which is defined as ‘Sup-ting antam’ by Panini.



2. This is different from the Dictionary usage listing and Thesaurus model of ‘ Dictionary’; In short, Kosha does not translate to ‘ Dictionary or Thesaurus’!



This what Dr. Yadu and Abhyankar , Karve, Joshi and many others are pointing out in this discussion.



3. It would be a worth while question to ponder :



Do we have / Did WE have any time in the history of SAMSKRUTH STUDIES and USAGE at India, a concept, Design frame work comparable to a ‘
(English language) DICTIONARY FOR SANSKRIT’, if it is not/ can not be
backed by the authority of :

- VYAKARANA (Pada Shaastra)-

- NIRUKTA ( PRAKRIYAA VYUTPATTI – NIRVACHANA)

- ANVAYA- SAMANVAYA Shaastra ( As KAAVYA – Shaastra / Meemaamsaa – Nyaya Paddhati )?

- NYAYA as PRAMANA Shaastra ?



Without this ‘ Shaastreeyataa’ bearing, What is the pedagogy of ‘ SANSKRIT TEACHING and RESEARCH / TRANSLATION’ ? Beyond a ‘ Opinionating’ (= matam) which does not truly bring out the
‘VIVAKSHITAARTHA – through VYUTPATTI’ ?



Thanks in advance for helping me to get this clarity in the Sanskrit studies.
