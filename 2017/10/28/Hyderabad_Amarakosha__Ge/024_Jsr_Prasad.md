Sri Achyut ji, you may be aware, the work is primarily called - 'nāma-liṅgānuśāsanam.' The title 'Amarakosha' is more popular than the primary/given title because Amarasimha had created something highly innovative, in kosha tradition. This instance is akin to the case of śiśupālavadham, popularly known as māgham.
