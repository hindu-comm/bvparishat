The Amarakośa is rightfully better represented in English as a 'thesaurus' than as a lexicon. A 'thesaurus' per the Latin dictionary is a storehouse, repository etc.

  

<http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/thesaurus>

  

In this sense, the word 'thesaurus' accords well with the received meaning of 'kośa'. See, for example, Monier Williams which gives among various meanings:  

  

a treasury , apartment where money or plate is kept , treasure , accumulated wealth (gold or silver , wrought or unwrought , as plate , jewellery , &c.) ib. ; (in surg.) a kind of bandage Sus3r. ; a dictionary , lexicon or vocabulary ; a poetical collection , collection of sentences &c.

  

In practical terms too, thesaurus works appropriately for 'kośa' as the so called Roget's Thesaurus published in 1805 is similar to Amarakośa. It has topics arranged in thematic fashion in terms of classes, sub divisions and sections, with word lists occurring therein. Its formal name is *Roget’s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases Classified and Arranged so to Assist in Literary Composition.* In this sense, it purpose seems to have been similar to that of the Amarakosha.

  

In the 18th-19th centuries, Europe went thru what I like to think of as their *Samkhya* phase when they rolled up their sleeves and started classifying the world. Thus we had Linnaeus' taxonomy i.e., classification of plants and animals, Mendeleyev's Periodic Table which classified naturally occurring elements and Roget's thesaurus, a work that classified words which is said to have been influenced by Linnaeus' taxonomy. Then we had Darwin who organized species in a hierarchy, so to speak. Parallelly in the same age while the classificatory zeal was getting to its acme, a physician named Blumenbach in Göttingen, wrote his thesis in which he classified human beings into 5 races, 'Aryan' being one of them 😊

  

  

Hope this helps,
