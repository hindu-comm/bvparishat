Dear Sir,

  

I would recommend to personally visit websites of various hrdc across India. Apart from this, there is a rule that atleast 30 participants must be present or else the course will be post poned.

  

If there are strict deadlines, you may attend any other inter disciplinary course for the sake of promotions.

  

Best Regards,

  

Hardik Joshi
