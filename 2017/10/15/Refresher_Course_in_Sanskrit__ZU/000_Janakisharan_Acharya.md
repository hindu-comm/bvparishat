Respected Scholars of Bharatiya Vidwat Parishad,  
  
Once again I am posting this thread for seeking information regarding Refresher Course in Sanskrit. Earlier I have posted this thread but did not get required information.  
I am seeking your valuable help with regard to the information on the **Refresher Course** in the subject Sanskrit or Interdisciplinary Language before March, 2018. If any of you can convey the correct information, a few of people will be benefited.  
An electronic link in this regard as if any is highly appreciated.  
  
With sincere regards  
  
**Dr. Janakisharan Acharya**  
Asst. Prof. in Darshana  
Shree Somnath Sanskrit University, Veraval
