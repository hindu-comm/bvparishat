Respected Members,

I am looking for a FREE IME which converts phonetic Roman input to Devanagari on a Windows 10. I have tried Google Input Tools.I think it works on the basis of learning as we keep training it and I am no good in training it. I would be thankful for any help/guidance in identifying a suitable IME app.

Thanks and Regards,

Murthy
