Google input tools works great.

Two things to keep in mind.

  

If you input in ITRANS format, chances are better to get the right word.

  

It gives you options for any typing, and mostly the right one is found in the initial list.

  

Only rarely do I have to use the keyboard and select the specific letters.

  

It also has a huge dictionary of sanskrit words used in actual works.

E.g. if you type कर्मण् it gives the full कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते as a choice. Even on smartphones.

  

And google products don't need to be trained explicitly. Every time there are multiple options, you pick the one you like, and it learns your choices and gets better next time.

  

  
Thanks,
