I dont think there's such a thing. His career spanned 7 decades - many of his works maybe out of print. His web site is now not accessible but it did have a cell number, I think, of his grand daughter. That maybe the way to pursue further. btw, the CD may not be corrupt. It may be non Unicode.  

  

One thing's for sure - soft copies of his works dont exist generally speaking. He specialized in translating difficult and ancient Tamil poems into Sanskrit like the Kalittokai, Paripāṭal, kamparāmāyaṇam etc. His tirukkuṛaḷ translation, published in 1961, should be easily available. Some years ago, a tirukkural enthusiast and official of the Wildlife Trust of India, Mr NVK Ashraf, took his wife's help and typed the entire sanskrit text in Unicode and posted it on one of his web pages. It may still be available. You may want to ask the ever helpful Sri Shankara who's on this forum about a soft copy.  

  

I have read Sri SNS's tirukkural translation a while ago. It reads very well in Sanskrit and is arguably better than any English or Hindi translation I have ever read. Samskrtasri, a quality Sanskrit monthly from Kanchipuram, has been running a Sanskrit translation of the tirukkuṛaḷ, by another scholar and ascetic, for a few years now. The Samskrtasri runs one decade i.e., 10 verses, every issue. The tirukkuṛaḷ has 1,330 verses in all.  

  

SNS's translation of the tirukkuṛaḷ deserves similar air time. His other translations too deserve preservation in digital media.  

  

Hope this helps,
