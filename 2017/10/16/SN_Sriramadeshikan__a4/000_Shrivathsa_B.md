hariH OM,

  

 I came across this interesting post about shrii SN Sriramadeshikan.

<https://satyavijayi.com/quest-meet-sanskrit-scholar-shri-s-n-sriramadesikan/>  

  

 Does anyone in the group have the CD of his complete works? It seems that the author of the article got a CD but except for a few files all others are corrupt. It will be a great service if those books are uploaded online.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
