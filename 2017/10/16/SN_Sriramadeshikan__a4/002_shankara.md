Namaste,

  

A few works of SN Sriramadesikan were available at DLI and they must now be there at [archive.org](http://archive.org) in different pages. I have compiled them to a single page at

<https://archive.org/details/Sanskrit_Works_of_SN_Srirama_Desikan>  

  

The works uploaded are:

1\. Kamba Ramayanam - Balakandam in Sanskrit - SN Srirama Desikan 1964 (LR)  
2. Nupura Kavyam (Silappadhikaram Pukarkandam) - Sri Rama Desikan 1968  
3. Pathuppattu in Sanskrit - SN Sriramadesikan 1972  
4. Shri Andal's Tiruppavai - SN Sriramadesikan 1961  
5. Tirukkural Sanskrit Translation - SN Sriramadesikan (Courtesy: NK Ashraff's site)  

6\. Vemana Padyamulu In Sanskrit Slokas - S N Srirama Desikan 1962

  

The above collection contains only Vemana Padyamulu from the CD. So, if anyone has a copy of the CD of SNS's works, please share the contents via Google drive or [archive.org](http://archive.org).  

  

regards  
shankara
