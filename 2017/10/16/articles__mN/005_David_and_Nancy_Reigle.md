A few years ago I downloaded Jan Gonda's book, Four Studies in the Language of the Veda, from the Digital Library of India. At present, I cannot access the DLI, and I cannot find this book on the mirrored DLI site at Archive.org. So I am attaching the copy that I downloaded earlier.  
  

Best regards,
