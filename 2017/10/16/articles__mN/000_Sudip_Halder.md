Respected Scholars  

In my research on Ajnana topic,I am looking for this article:  

-   "The original sense and the etymology of Sanskrit Maya",in *Four
    studies in the language of the veda.*The Hague:Mouton,1959. by Jan
    Gonda

If someone can provide some references it will be very helpful for me.

  

Thanking you

Sudip Haldar
