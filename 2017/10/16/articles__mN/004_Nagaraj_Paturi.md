\>First one is by taking the sense of karma and the second one by taking the sense of jñāna to the dhātu māṅ mānē.

  

My father mentions nirmāṇa , nirmiti as examples for use ofmāṅ mānē in the sense of karma and pramāṇa, pramiti as examples for use ofmāṅ mānē in the sense of jñāna.

  

In my comments on this quote, I said that these quotes from S'ankara, focus on the meaning of māyā

  

1. from the side of jīva

  

2. as useful for a sādhaka in sādhana.
