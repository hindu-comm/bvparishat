 Recently Swami Paramananda Bharati delivered more than 30hrs of lectures to graduate students at IISc on Causality in Science and Vedanta.

  
1. I believe that Swamijis work is path-breaking, as he brings a high level of modern physics and maths and applies vedantic models

  to build a theory in physics. This is no longer -general ideas - but getting into making predictive-mathematical models using Vedanta!.

2\. Swamiji has been very influential in clarifying Advaita for the present day - with reliance totally on the Shankara bhashya.

  The Sringeri Acharya has himself very kindly referred to Swamiji as 'Paramahamsa Paramananda Bharati'.

  

  I hope that this starts a conversation in how Vedanta is taught and new additional material is developed for the current times.  

  Please feel free to provide feedback on the lectures and it can be conveyed to Swamiji.
