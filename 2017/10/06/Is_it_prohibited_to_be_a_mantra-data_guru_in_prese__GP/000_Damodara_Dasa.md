Hare Krishna.  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
  
I have heard that it is a vedic etiquette that a disciple doesn't  
start initiating in presence of one's guru. I wanted some references  
in this regard if someone knows.  
  
In Smrtis we find in section of guru-sevana that a gurukuli should act  
with guru's guru in a manner that he acts towards his own guru. This  
may mean that guru has become guru in his guru's presence.  
  
What is the etiquette in case of upanayana samskara? Is it that a son  
(of a brahmana guru) doesn't start giving upanayana samskara till his  
father retires?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara das
