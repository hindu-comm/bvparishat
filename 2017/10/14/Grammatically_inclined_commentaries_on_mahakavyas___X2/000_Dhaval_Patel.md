Respected scholars,

  

I would be obliged if the list members can draw my attention to publication details of some commentaries on five mahakavyas and meghadutam with some emphasis on grammar.

  

Currently I am editing a work 'durghatasangraha' which deals with grammatically difficult parts of these works. Hence the need.

  

With Regards,
