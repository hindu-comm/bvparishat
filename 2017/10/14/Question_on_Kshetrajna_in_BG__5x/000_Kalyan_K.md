Namaste

  

My question is addressed to the Sanskrit experts in this forum. This is regarding translation of Bhagavad Gita verse 13.3a

  

क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां विद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रेषु भारत।  

  

I have multiple translations. I will present two - one given by Swami Gambhirananda (SG) and the other byvan Buitenen (VB).

  

SG translation: And, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, under-stand Me to be the 'Knower of the field' (Kshetrajna) in all the fields.

  

VB translation: Know, BhArata, that I too am such a guide (Kshetrajna), but to all fields.

  

(I am not interested in knowing whether Kshetrajna can be translated as "guide" or not.)

  

If one adopts the first translation, then there is only one Kshetrajna for one Kshetra. If one adopts the second translation, there is a possibility of multiple Kshetrajnas for each Kshetra, with Krishna being the common Kshetrajna for all Kshetras. To me it looks like VB is more correct in his translation, but I could be wrong.

  

I would like to know which translation is closer to the original Sanskrit verse. Please help me.

  

Thanks

Kalyan
