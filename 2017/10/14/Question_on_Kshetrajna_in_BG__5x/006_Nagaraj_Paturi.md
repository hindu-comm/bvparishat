Choice one:

  

1\. Know me as the kshetrajna existing as multiple kshetrajnas in all the kshetras

  

2. Know me as the kshetrajna (existing) in all the kshetras

  

Choice #1 requires "as multiple kshetrajnas" to be added from outside.

  

cha + api refers to the other maam viddhi (type) expressions in the previous chapters. Has nothing to do with the issue of single or multiple kshetrajnas.
