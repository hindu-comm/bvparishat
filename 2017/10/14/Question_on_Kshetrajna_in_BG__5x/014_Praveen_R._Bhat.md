It talks of only a single क्षेत्रज्ञ due to the following: 

क्षेत्र

 has been stated with the plural declension in सर्वक्षेत्रेषु। क्षेत्रज्ञ does not have a plural declension at all; it is only in singular in all verses. The only indication of the plural given is in verse 13.1 where it is said that the तद्विदs (knowers of those two) call such a knower as क्षेत्रज्ञ। That knower of क्षेत्र from 13.1 and क्षेत्रज्ञ from 13.2 (चकार and अपि bring in all that has been talked about Bhagavan with discrimination) will himself become क्षेत्रज्ञ, that Bhagavan is (not real becoming but will know as already being so), since there is only one definition of क्षेत्रज्ञ। Whichever way anyone agrees it translates as, it should apply to both Bhagavan and knowers equally. ब्रह्म वेद ब्रह्मैव भवति is what is stated in these verses.

  

As for the plural indicated by those who call this person as क्षेत्रज्ञ have themselves become knowers in this aforesaid way. (Else, they are परोक्षज्ञानीs who just know that scriptures say so and tag him like that without themselves not having अपरोक्षज्ञान)।
