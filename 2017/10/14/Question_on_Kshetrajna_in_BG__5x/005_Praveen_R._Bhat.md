Leaving the issue about translation of क्षेत्रज्ञ as guide aside, since you prefer not to delve on it, I'd question the translation of the सप्तम्यान्तं पदं सर्वक्षेत्रेषु as "\*to\* all fields" as well. Put together, VB's translation does not appear right to me, let alone closer! And as Dr. H. N. Bhat pointed out, this is nowhere inline with the definition of क्षेत्रज्ञ as given to be derived from the definition of क्षेत्र stated earlier!

  





Kind rgds,
