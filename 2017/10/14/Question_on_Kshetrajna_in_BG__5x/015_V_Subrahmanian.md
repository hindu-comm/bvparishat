Dear Kalyan ji,

  

Actually both the translations are not depicting the correct meaning of the verse. The cha and api in this verse are to be seen as the words connecting the teaching of this verse to the teaching given out in the previous verse. After saying what is kshetram and who the kshetrajna is, the Lord is not concluding the teaching there. He wants to further say something without which the statement made in the first verse is not complete. So, cha api serve to mean this: know also (api cha) the kshetrajna, knower-consciousness in every body-mind complex, to be Me.


  

Shankara puts the context thus:

  

एवंक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञौउक्तौ।किम्एतावन्मात्रेणज्ञानेनज्ञातव्यौइति?नइतिउच्यते—

  

.....What with this much knowledge the two, field (body-mind complex) and the knower, are taught to be known? not so.

क्षेत्रज्ञंचापिमांविद्धिसर्वक्षेत्रेषुभारत।  

क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्ज्ञानंयत्तज्ज्ञानंमतंमम॥ २ ॥

[भाष्यम्](http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Gita?page=13&id=BG_C13_V01&hlBhashya=%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0#bhashya-BG_C13_V02)

क्षेत्रज्ञंयथोक्तलक्षणंचापिमांपरमेश्वरम्असंसारिणंविद्धिजानीहि।सर्वक्षेत्रेषुयःक्षेत्रज्ञःब्रह्मादिस्तम्बपर्यन्तानेकक्षेत्रोपाधिप्रविभक्तः,तंनिरस्तसर्वोपाधिभेदंसदसदादिशब्दप्रत्ययागोचरंविद्धिइतिअभिप्रायः।

Anandagiri, in his gloss to the commentary says:

च, अपि इति निपातौ जीवस्य अक्षरत्वज्ञानस्य, देहात् अन्यत्वज्ञानेन, समुच्चयार्थौ भिन्नक्रमौ ; न क्षेत्रज्ञं साङ्ख्यवत् दृश्यात् अन्यमेव विद्धि ; किन्तु मां चापि विद्धि इति सम्बध्यते। Cha and api are two particles that serve the purpose of connecting the statement made in the first verse 'the jīva is distinct from the body-mind' with the teaching in this current verse: the jīva is the Akṣara (the Imperishable that is the subject matter of the previous chapter: ye tvakṣaramanirdeśyam.....). The particles are in a different order than what they have to be - api cha. The knower of the body-mind complex is not merely distinct from the known, just as the Sānkhya-s hold, but also know (the knower to be) Me as well.
