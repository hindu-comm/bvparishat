Happy Dipawali.

  

When you send mail with

Reply to: list or group

Cc: 500 people

  

When each one of these people reply, it will send to list, in this case bvparishat. And if they are not members ir will bounce for them.

  

I would suggest please don't mix lists (google groups) and other recipients in same mail.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
