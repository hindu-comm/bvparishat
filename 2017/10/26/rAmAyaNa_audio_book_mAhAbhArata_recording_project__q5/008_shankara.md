Namaste,

  

You can batch download all the files on a page i.e. 20 files at a time using a batch-download software like J-Downlaoder. Hope someone else would come up with a better solution.  

  

regards  
shankara

The full Ramayana recitation by Sri Sriram Ghanapathi on [pravachanam.com](http://pravachanam.com) is a treat to the ears. Finally a good recitation that is also recorded well! Unfortunately, a file has to be downloaded separately for each Sarga. Does anyone have a workaround for this? I also fear that the website will go down and all will be lost. Atleast the most important recordings need to reach [archive.org](http://archive.org).
