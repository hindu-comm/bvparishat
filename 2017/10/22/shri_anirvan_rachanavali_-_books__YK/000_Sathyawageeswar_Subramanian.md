namaste,

  

I wish to humbly bring to the notice of the list members the precious works of shri anirvan, which searches through google groups revealed few appear to be aware of:

  

<http://www.haimavati-anirvan.org/Rachanavali/Books.html>  

  

A dear friend and respected mentor, gautama, holds shri anirvan's teachings in the highest regard. These works, especially on the gayatri mandala and the veda mimamsa, are exegetic works of the highest order, giving deep insights into the most mysterious and elevated vedic symbols.

  

Most of these are in Bengali. It is a dream of shri gautama to have these works translated and to help them spread widely among any and all jijnasus. So far, only 6 volumes of veda mimamsa even have a hindi manuscript - and these are great treasures for aspirants. Translations into various indian vernaculars of the highest priority, to make them accessible to vedic students from all parts of the country.

  

If there are scholars on this forum learned in bengali and other indian languages, begali-tamil, bengali-kannada, bengali-marathi etc. bilinguals, I humbly place at your feet a request to look at these works and consider plans for translating them.

  

I am personally not competent to relate much about shri anirvan's life or works, but shri gautama (he is in ill health at present) will hopefully be able to add further details to this post soon.

  

shri gurubhyo namaH,

daaso'smi, dhanyo'smi,

सत्यवागीश्वर:
