The forms given in Bucknell are

*vakti*, *vakS"yati* etc.

(Further *vAcayati* is shown as the Causative).

Even if we leave out the last item mentioned here

\- as Causals of the Tenth Conjugation can have the same form

in the Causative as has the original/"pure" root),

it is obvious that Bucknell is not speaking of the root of the Tenth Conjugation.

Hence *vacanIya* is the valid form there.

  

Nor is it proper to import forms of the same root in a different Conjugation.

Roots like *yuj* (and *puS*" and *klis*' etc.) belong to multiple Conjugations.

Mixing up their forms is not commendable.

  

As Bucknell is not treating of *vac* with *svArthika Nic*,

*vacanIya* is the valid form here.
