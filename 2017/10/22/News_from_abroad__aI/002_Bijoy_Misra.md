Deasr Nageshji,

Local topical events do happen, though I don't keep track.

Our goal is to define "India" for the future youth of Indian descent

who are likely to have less contact with with their original homeland.

We do a survey every six months. Hopefully we have

an understanding when we complete the process in 2020.

We need good researchers and writers. You can contact me

privately if you have interest in our project.

Best regards,

BM
