Dea friends,

Happy Diwali.

I have been busy in organizing our third seminar of the India Discovery Center

that is scheduled next Saturday, Oct 28. This would be an analysis of the period

700BC-200BC, which we have labeled as the Classical Period. I am attaching the

announcement. I invite you to join as our guests if you happen to be in the area.

Out of six tracks, I will survey the track of Science and Technology.

Please write to me privately if you would like to review my slides. .

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
