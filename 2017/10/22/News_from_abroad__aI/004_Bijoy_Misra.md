Dear Dr Dash,

As we stay abroad, a question does crop up about how a person of Indian origin

distinguishes himself/herself or does he? We are calling the 700BC-200BC period

as "Enlightenment Period". The material created during this time has no rival in

the world or India itself. We will continue to study the transformation until the

present day. Is a person of Indian descent a poet, an artist, a scholar, a mathematician,

a farmer, an artisan or a religious man holding reflecting on life?
Massive scholarship

of the period is baffling. Our next period is 200BC to 500AD with the seminar in April, 2018.

Best regards,

BM
