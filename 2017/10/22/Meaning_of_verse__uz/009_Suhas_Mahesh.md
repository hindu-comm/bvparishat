अार्य श्रीपाद,

  

You overlook मा = लक्ष्मीः. This is the source of confusion. The anvaya in this verse is perfect.

Setting: The gods have arrived to see Vishnu, who is asleep and dreaming of Lakshmi. Garuda introduces them and wakes Vishnu up with a start.  

  

दृक्पातः कमलासनेऽस्तु

"May your gaze fall on Kamalāsana \[Brahma\]

भवतु ज्ञानं मनाङ्मारुते  

Some attention here to Māruta  

श्रीकण्ठोऽयमितः  

Here is Shrikantha \[Shiva\]"  

  

इति तार्क्ष्येण नतान् सुरान् विज्ञापितः  

Thus informed of the bowing Gods by Garuda,

हरिः सुप्तप्रबुद्धो उल्लसत्-लक्ष्मी-अावासित-मानसः  

just-awakened Hari, his delighted mind \[still\] occupied by Lakshmi, \[says\]:

"प्रेयस्याः क्व तदासनं? क्व च रुतं? कण्ठः क्व च?" इति  

"Where is my beloved's seat \[कमला-अासनम्\] ? And where her voice \[मा-रुतम्\] ? And where her throat? \[श्री-कण्ठः\]?"

विजयते  

He is victorious!
