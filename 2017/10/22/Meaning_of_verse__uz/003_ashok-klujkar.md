Dr. R. Ganesh has finely laid out the cleverness of a remarkable verse. I would only add that the adjective natān is significant. Because the three gods had bowed down, they could not be immediately recognized by Hari who would otherwise be looking at them from the other side of the bed. This creates the scope for the wit of the verse.

  

I feel, however, that the original wording of the verse could have had dhyānaṁ ‘attention’ in the place of jñānaṁ ‘cognition’ and I wonder if itaḥ fully fits.
