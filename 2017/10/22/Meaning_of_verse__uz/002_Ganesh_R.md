The verse explicitly says that as naraayana's mind is completely engrossed by the beloved wife Lakshmi, he is willfully compelled to comprehend everything through her and in her and that's why immediately after opening his eyes, he is responding to her in this manner. By saying so, the verse beautifully suggests that even during his yoganidraa, he was deeply engrossed by her love.
