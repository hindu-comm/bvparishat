My guess is *dhyAnam* **in the sense of attention** is more a Hindi-ism (or Marathi-ism), as in "*dhyAn do*". At least I have not have across such a usage.  

(Paraphrasing, *jAnIhi* is more natural here than *dhyAya*.)  

  

And *itah* actually fits very well, I suppose.  
Garuda is drawing the attention of Vis"Nu:  

Hello! \[Wake up Sir! Your kind attention please! Here have already assembled your comrades, the honourable ones:\]... And this is
So-and-So, **hither** (*itaH*)! etc.  

Cf. *ito darI, tato vyAghraH ( Hither is this..., thither is that...)  
*

or *ito nis"Ida (Sit here)  
  
*

Your explanation of the significance of *natAn* is superb.  

Just waking up from a state of deep sleep,  
one figures out the surroundings but slowly,  
or rather gradually - one by one:  

so here, well reflected in the multiple *kva*-s.  

  

Dr. Ganesh provided the key to the verse, indeed.  
Yet, I am not fully convinced of his *sambhAvanA* of ***yoga***-*nidrA* here*;  
*

at least the verse embodies no clue towards that end*.  
*

Or else, we must concede :  
seldom does Vis"Nu sleep an ordinary sleep, after all!*  
*

*  
*

On the other hand, *  
-lakshmyA**vAsita**-mAnaso*...  
is not a very happy construction*,* I feel: *  
lakshmyA* is in the Instrumental, and so cannot enter into the compound.  
  
We can defend it all the same, splitting the compound word differently as  
*-lakshmI-**AvAsita**-mAnaso...,*  
though it can look a bit belaboured*.
