NamaskaaraH,

  

This is a beautiful punning verse entirely depending on the three chosen synonyms for the names of Brahma, Vaayu and Shiva.

  

Here Lakshmi, the consort of naraayana is gently suggesting the anxious presence of the great gods such as the creator (padmaasana), Lord of the winds (maaruta) and the master of withdrawal (shreekaNTha)by names to her beloved husband and requesting him to cast his divine glances on them. ViShNu having got up, cleverly questions her as to show her seat (aasana), voice (ruta) and neck (kaNTha) as the words padmaa, maa and shree in the names of those gods are all the synonyms of Lakshmi! It means, Hari is taking a romantically mischievous row with her beloved immediately after he being wakedup by chiding her as to look at which aspect of her when she herself is present in front of him!

  

Hope this would make the things clear.

  

Regards

  

Ganesh
