A probably earlier source than the शार्ङ्गधरपद्धति for this beautiful verse is Jalhaṇa's Sūktimuktāvalī (verse 32 in the Namaskārapaddhati; the anthologist apparently did not know the name of its author, writing simply kasyacit).

A reading dhyānaṁ might indeed be attractive. As for itaḥ, it seems to me not problematic; surely it is quite natural to take श्रीकण्ठोऽयमितः to mean more or less '\[And\] this is Śrīkaṇṭha here/over here.'
