Respected scholars,

  

Is it possible to get a scanned copy of theआरण्यकाण्डम् of theधर्माकूतम् authored by Tryambakarayamakhin?

  

This book has been published by Saraswati mahal library, Tanjore and they have a copy in their library but there seem to be no other copies of this particular काण्डम् in the web.

  

Would be grateful for any leads .

  

Regards

Srivalli Anand
