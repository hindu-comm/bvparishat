Namaste

  

Here is a verse related to upanayanam:

  

आचार्यस्तस्य यां जातिं विद्धयाद्वेदपारगः।

तत्रास्य माता सावित्रि पिता त्वाचार्य उच्यते ॥  

  

Upon searching, I could not find this verse in the above form. The first half, with some variation is seen in the Bhavisya puranam.

  

The second half is seen in Vishnu smriti and Mahabharata, though with variation. In one site, it says that the line is an interpolation in the Manu smriti.  

  

I request help in the reference of the above verse.

  

Thanks and regards
