This is a request to all the great Advaita scholars n this group. I am reading the Siddhāntaleśasaṅgraha of Appayya Dīkṣitar and the first paricchedaḥ discussing whether śrotavyaḥ etc is a niyamavidhi or not. I am following the text along with the commentary of Acyutakr̥ṣṇānanda-Tīrtha edited by S.R.Krishnamurti Sastri and N.Veezhinathan (first edition 1973). On page 33 of this edition starting withविचारविध्यभावे'पि विञानार्थतया etc and ending with 
अध्यनविध्यभावे तु उपगमनम् विधीयमानम्।सफलो'ध्ययननियमविधिः

I am not sure how to understand the second argument of 'even when there is no vidhi of approaching a guru then how does it become a niyamavidhi'.

Will be grateful if this point is made clear by any one of the learned scholars.
