Ujjvala Ji

  

My feedback: excellent initiative. Both the audio content and the editing (lip sync) are very well done. It is rare to find people who are deep into two very different fields. You seem to be a fan of Harry Potter novels and movies in addition to being proficient in Sanskrit.

It is comprehensible to advanced Sanskrit learners and scholars. However, it may be difficult for those who are beginners Sanskrit. May I make some suggestions for your work to be beneficial to even more people:

  

1\) Add subtitles in Devanagari. If possible, add subtitles in both Devanagari and IAST. The YouTube video editor allows you to do that easily. As you have done excellent lip sync with the audio timing clearly matching lip movements in the video, it should be easy for you to time your subtitles to match the video.

  

2\) Share this widely on Facebook and Twitter. As you would know, BVP with its nearly 2000 members is largely made of academics and serious students. On Facebook and Twitter you can reach many more people, especially young audiences who are interested in learning Sanskrit to whom this kind of content will be very appealing.

  

3\) Kindly speak with Vartavali team of DD News to see if your work can be featured on Vartavali. They carry old Hindi movie songs dubbed into Sanskrit. These kind of videos from popular movies with Sanskrit dialogues can be a new trend.

  

Finally, keep up the good work!
