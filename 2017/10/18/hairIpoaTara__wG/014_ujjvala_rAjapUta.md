Thank you Nityanand Misra ji for the feedback and the suggestions.  
  
On your suggestion, I have added subtitles, in Devanagari, for now, and also sent a mail to the Vaartavali team.  
  
But I don't have Facebook or Twitter accounts. Starting a new account and gathering a following will take time. So it will be really helpful if people like you who already have a huge following share the video.  
  
Thanks again.
