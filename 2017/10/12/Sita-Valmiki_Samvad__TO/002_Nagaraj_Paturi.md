In Uttara RaamaayaaNa narrative poems, both folk and classical , there are samvaada portions with a samvaada between Sita and Valmiki.

  

Longest of them has for its content Valimiki comforting Sita assuring her about Rama's undeterred love for her .

  

Whether this is the theme in the samvaada being discussed or not is not clear.
