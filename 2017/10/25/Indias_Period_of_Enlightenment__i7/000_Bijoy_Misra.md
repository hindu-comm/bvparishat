Friends,

Good morning.

Though the dates are uncertain, our studies and analysis here lead us to assert that

the post-Vedic India, possibly a period spanning a thousand years spanning from

1000BC onward, should be considered as a India's "Period of Enlightenment". The

amount of objective analysis and knowledge discovery seems to have no rival in the

world literature. Massive contributions in health sciences, nutrition, language,

grammar, performing arts, statecraft, economics, philosophy, conduct and human

as an object are baffling to comprehend. More we study, more we get stunned with

the objectivity of the analysis. Though many of the current texts are reproductions or

commentaries done at a later time, we have reason to believe that the material had

developed before. It also leads us to assume that there existed a culture of record

keeping through memory or oral literature. Such material eventually was codified

because of a call for public education and knowledge dissemination.
This latter

is a speculation on our part and we need much more analysis. I wanted to share the

thrill we have here while going to our seminar coming Saturday. I feel ashamed that

I did not take the time to start the journey earlier. It possibly needed my own scientific

development and insight into view life.

With best regards,

Bijoy Misra
