Namaste  
  
There are many aspects which do not seem factual in the above write up on Maxmuller.  
  
Moncure convey was a literary critic. He wrote an article "Memoirs of Maxmuller" in North America Review in the year 1900, after the passing away of Prof.Maxmuller. This incident is mentioned in pg.888 .  
It can be accessed here - <https://archive.org/details/jstor-25105098>  
  
Seeing a lot of various versions circulating then, I had rendered
this incident in Sanskrit in my blog in the year 2014 which can be seen here -
