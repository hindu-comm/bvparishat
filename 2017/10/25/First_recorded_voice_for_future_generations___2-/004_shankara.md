Namaste,

  

This topic was discussed at least twice in this group. Dr. HN Bhat had provided link to a biography of Max Muller which mentioned the actual incident.  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/NtienY8uk7U>  

  

Link to 'Memoirs of Max Muller' by Moncure D Convey, which describes the incident on page 888 - <https://archive.org/details/jstor-25105098>

  

regards  
shankara
