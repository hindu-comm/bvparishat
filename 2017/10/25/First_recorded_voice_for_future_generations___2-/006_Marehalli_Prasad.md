Namaste. I have also heard the recording which is supposed to be audio recording of the famous speech of Swami Vivekananda in the Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. I tried to verify the possibility but could not sure about it.

Please let me know if anyone else have heard this recording and able to verify.

Regards
