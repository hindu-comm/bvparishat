Respected Sir,

  

While googling, I found the following. May be useful.

  

na tatgyanamna tatshilpamnasa vidyanasa kala.

nasa yogona tatkarman natyesmin yanna drishyate  

  

"There is no art, no science, no craft and no skill that does not fall within the purview of drama" -- from Natya Shastra  

  

Some scholars have an opinion the word Nataya is used in the terms of dance only but some others reveals that Nataya as is a performing art so it can be used for other performing arts also. Nataya includes music in form of tala and swaras which further introduce a rhythm. So we can use this word Nataya for other Performing arts also.
