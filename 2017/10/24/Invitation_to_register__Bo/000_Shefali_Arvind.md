Hari Om!

  

Chinmaya International Foundation Shodha Sansthan brings you a two-part workshop on Siddhāntaleśasaṅgraha, a textual study guided by Prof. V. Kutumba Sastri in Sanskrit.  

  

Appayya Dīkṣita had collected gems of wisdom from the vast Vedantic literature and compiled them to form the treatise called Sidhhāntaleśasaṅgraha, so named as if to testify its content.

  

Siddhāntaleśasaṅgraha elucidates the opinions of Vācaspatimiśra, Vivaraṇācārya, Ānandabodhācārya, Citsukhācārya, Vidyāraṇya, Sureśvarācārya, Nṛsimhabhaṭṭopādhyāya, Kaumudīkāra, Vedāntasiddhāntamuktāvalīkāra etc. in such a way so as to be brief but complete and presented in the order in which these texts advance further from the previous view.

  

The two-part camp will he conducted at Adi Sankara Nilayam from December 1-14, 2017 and January 20, 2018 to February 04, 2018.
