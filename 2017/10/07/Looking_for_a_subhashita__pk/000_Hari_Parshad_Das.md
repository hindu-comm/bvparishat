dear vidvaj-janas,

  

my pranams.

  

i am looking for a subhashita which says something on the lines of — "Misdeeds committed by a person are washed away by the tears of repentance."

  

If anyone has an idea of where such a verse is located, please let me know and I will be grateful.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,

  

hari parshad das.
