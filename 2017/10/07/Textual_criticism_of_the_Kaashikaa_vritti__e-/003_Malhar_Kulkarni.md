Respected Professor Bhatt ji,

  

At the moment, Dr. Eivind Kahrs, University of Cambridge and myself, we are in the process of editing the text of the Kasikavrtti critically.

  

In this regard, I request you to bring to our notice any such cases where you find it difficult to make sense of the text of the KV as printed in the edition/s you are using. For example- On A. 2.2.6, two printed editions of the KV have two different texts, one has a varttika and one doesn't. I found it difficult to make the sense of this variation until the critical edition of the KV on A. 2.2.6, that I prepared and published, showed to me that the absence of the varttika on A. 2.2.6, is historically justified.

  

I would also like to request all colleagues to help by reporting any piece of information related to:

(i)Tantrapradipa (other than D.Kanjilal's work), a commentary on the Nyasa (a commentary on the KV) and

(ii)Udyotanaprabha a commentary on Tantrapradipa.

  

with salutations.
