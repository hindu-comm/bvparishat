Respected Prof. Kulkarniji, Prof. Bhattji

  

I am sure you know of the below but I take here the liberty of mentioning a reference that points out to errors in the text of the K.

In the “Nyāsa-Paryālocana” by BhimsenShastri, his fourth chapter is titled, “Nyāsa ki sahaayatā se Kāśikā kā pāṭhasaṃśodhana”. There are more than 54 corrections mentioned therein.

  

For instance under ‘suptiṅanataṃ padam’ 1.4.14, the K. writes ‘bhrāmaṇāḥ pacanti’. BhimsenShastriji writes (in Hindi), “parantu Nyāsa ko dekhane se pratīta hota hai ki yahaṃ par ‘bhrāmaṇāḥ **paṭhanti**’ pātha hai. prakriyā mein yadyapi kucha antar nahiṇ ātā tathāpi ‘bhrāmaṇāḥ pacanti’ kI apekṣā ‘bhrāmaṇāḥ **paṭhanti**’ udāharaṇa hī ucita hai”.

Another instance is with reference to the example which is listed in the K. as ‘jaghāna’ under ‘kuhoścuḥ’ 7.4.32. BhimsenShastriji writes (in Hindi), “parantu nyāsa ko dekhane se yaha spaṣṭa ho jātā hai ki yahaṃ “**jaghāsa**” pāṭha thā…”.

  

Ofcourse he mentions various references and reasons for his corrections which I have not mentioned here.

Respectfully,

  

Rishit Desai
