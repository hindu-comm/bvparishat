Dear friends,

  

Help! Is there a simple table that gives**bahuvrīhi बहुव्रीहि** endings?

  

For example if I take the dependent compoundgirau nadī --> girinadī गिरौ नदी --> गिरिनदी and want to use it as a possessive adjective, what would the masculine, feminine and neuter endings be?

  

There seem to be some many complicated rules when you look at Kale and other grammar books.

  

Your inputs will be appreciated.

  

Regards
