Dear MBBS Agni

No fees

They provide accommodation food to all participants

And pay three tyre AC train fare

You can attend this work shop

But this is 4th work shop on the above subject

This time Prof Rastogi Sir is going to teach Jnanadhikara of Eswarapratyabhijna

Very very good topic

You can learn many things regarding Kashmir sai saivism

Regards

Asmk. Sri maha lakshmi
