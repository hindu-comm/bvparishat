Dear Sir/Madam,

  

As the call of participation clearly mentions that they have certain criteria to select the participants. This decision will be taken by the committee in the ICPR. However, I think you should still apply, but I would not know if you get selected for participation or not. As I said only the ICPR committee should decide that. I think the event is funded by ICPR so there are no major fees or charges involved. If one is selected the expenses of the participant are borne by the ICPR. The deadline for making an application is 31 October 2018. I hope this helps.

  

Best wishes.

  

Mrinal
