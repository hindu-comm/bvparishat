Namaste,

  

Giving below the same verse with translation as found in Mahasubhashitasamgraha. This version of the subhashita comes nearest to the one quoted by Abhyankarji.  

  

गिरौ कलापी गगने पयोदा लक्षान्तरेऽर्कश्च जलेषु पद्माः।  
इन्दुर्द्विलक्षे कुमुदस्य बन्धुर्यो यस्य हृद्यो नहि तस्य दूरः॥ Maha Subhashita Samgraha Vol. 7  
  
Translation: The peacock is on the mountain and the clouds, (the friends of peacock), are (far away) in the sky; the sun, (the friend of lotuses), is a hundred thousand yojana-s away and the lotuses are in the ponds; the moon, the friend of lilies, is two hundred thousand yojana's away (from lilies); if one is dear to another, distance never exists for him.
