``` गिरौ कलापि गगने पयोधौ / लक्ष्यान्तरेऽर्कश्च जलेषु पद्मम् । इन्दुर्द्विलक्षे कुमुदस्य बन्धुर्- / यो यस्य हृद्यो न हि तस्य दूरः ॥

The peacock is in the mountain and the clouds in the sky, the sun is at the distance of a thousand thousand yojanas and the lotus is in the water, the moon is two hundred thousand yojanas away from its friend, the lily. what is dear to one.s heart is not far away. ```

``` See  at almost the bottom of the page https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_general/shloka3.html?lang=sa 
```

  

I got it by searching in DevanagarI.That kind of searching often yields good results, readily also.

  

I got it, but, I am not sure whether the scripting is grammatically correct. The wordपयोधौseems to be certainly faulty.. The English translation also does not seem to be good. How can moon be farther away than sun ? Maybe, the word द्विलक्षे has a different interpretation.
