There is a searchable file of Bharata's Nāṭyaśāstra at the GRETIL website here: <http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/5_poetry/1_natya/bharnatu.htm>. It includes all but four chapters, chapters 17, 31, 32, 34. However, I did not find in it the phrase that you are looking for. Perhaps this phrase is in one of the four chapters that are missing.  
  

Best regards,
