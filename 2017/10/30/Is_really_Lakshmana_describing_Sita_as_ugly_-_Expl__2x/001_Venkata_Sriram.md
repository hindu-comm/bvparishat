Nice presentation Ramesh Ji. This ध्वनि काव्य has to be understood from a sampradAya AchArya and moreover that AchArya should be a rAma-bhakta & upAsaka. Otherwise, self interpretations would lead to perversions.

  

I can recollect two such great traditional scholars who were great rAma-bhaktas as well as possessed great erudition in veda-s and shAstras namely 1) Brahmasri Sengalipuram Anantharama Dikshtar 2) Mahamahopadhyaya Sribhashyam Appalacharya Garu.

  

Currently, I can only say Jagatguru Ramabhadracharya of Tulasi Peeta who has imbibed the rAma-rasa and putting His Holiness's own words here:

  

"वाल्मीकि रामायण समझने के लिए एक लाख राम नाम का प्रतिदिन जाप आवश्यक है"

  

rgs,
