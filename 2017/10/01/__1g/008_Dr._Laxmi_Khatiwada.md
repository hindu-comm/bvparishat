Dear ashutoshjee  

Thank you for your quick response. I am a student of Nepali language and linguistics. I pursued my PHD in computational linguistics, i.e. example based machine translation on English-Nepali language pair. I am also interested in South Asian Nomenclature(not Indian Nomenclature, I prefer South Asian Nomenclaturedue to some political matter, Sorry for this view). Sanskrit is our base language of eastern knowledge. Sanskrit is not a language but it is the history of knowledge tradition. And Sanatana Dharma is not only a religion but is a natural science of thinking. So it is the time of our responsibility to prove SANATANA Dharma is not a specific dharma but is continuous dharma (not religion) of humankind from endless past to endless future. This is my declarative view on this area.
