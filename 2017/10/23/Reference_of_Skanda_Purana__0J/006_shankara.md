Namaste,

  

It seems this stotra is not from Skanda Purana. If you know this from a reliable source, please provide reference of the same.  

  

Most online sources (such as <https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_subrahmanya/skanda.html?lang=sa>) ascribe this stotra to Rudrayamala Tantra, while [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQnLZGHrttg) ascribe it to Sivarahasya Purana. I could not find this stotra in the searchable e-text of Rudrayamala Tantra available at the Muktabodha site (login required).

regards  
shankara
