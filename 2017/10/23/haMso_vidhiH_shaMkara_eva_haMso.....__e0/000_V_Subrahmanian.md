Namaste

  

In the commentary of Gaudapadacharya for the Uttaragītā, there is a smṛti cited that reads:हंसो विधिः शंकर एव हंसो हंसश्च विष्णुर्गुरुरेव हंसः’ .

  

I could not locate this smriti's reference after a search. I request members here to help me trace the source of the smriti.

  

Thanks and warm regards
