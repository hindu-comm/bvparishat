Dear Anandji,

Thank you for the post and the prompt reply.While I understand the general drift of the meaning that approaching a guru for instruction is a niyamavidhi I am looking for the exact way in which the text explains why even if "one does not accept approaching a guru as a vidhi it still is a niyamavidhi". Will be grateful for any help.
