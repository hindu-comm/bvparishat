Dear Rukmaniji,

  

The summary of the text that you quoted earlier is this. The Guru-upasadana vidhi (tadvijnAnArthaM sa gurumevAbhigacchet) is meant for jnAna-prApti through an intermediate cause, Vedanta vichAra. Now, there need not be another vidhi for this Vedanta vichAra, since it is already established as the cause for jnAna-prApti. However, there could be an objection. If jnAna-prApti happens through Guru-upasadana and Vedanta vichAra, what is the use of the adhyayana vidhi (svAdhyAyo adhyetavyaH)? The reply is: the adhyayana vidhi is meant for akShara grahaNa, (learning the vedas) and is necessary. Without the adhyayana vidhi, there could be a possibility of learning Vedas through likhita-pATha. To rule out such possibilities, adhyayana vidhi is required. I hope this clarifies the position.

  

Anand
