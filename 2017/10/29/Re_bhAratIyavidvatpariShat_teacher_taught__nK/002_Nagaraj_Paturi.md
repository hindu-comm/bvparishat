I guess the most popular s'aanti mantra saha naa vavavatu would not have missed your attention. Its a duet sung by the teacher and the taught, deserving to be a daily song at all the learning places all over the world.

  

Its interesting to note that the word 'saha' repeated with an intense significance in the mantra is part of the vibhakti (kaarakabodhaka - case marker), chaturthee + saha, used for mentioning the teacher.

  

You study along with / together with a teacher, not under the teacher or something like that. That is part of Sanskrit idiom, not just expressed in an ancient mantra and left it at that.

  

Which country that claims to have dissolved hierarchies , students calling their teachers by name, has this idiom in its language.

  

My mother used to reminisce how friendly was the guru of my polymath sakalas'aastrapaarangata father, with my father, how affectionately they used to converse in Sanskrit, how in contrast, her 'teachers' of the modern British government school were horrifying.
