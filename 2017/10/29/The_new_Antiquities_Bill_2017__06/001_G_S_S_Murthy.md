I glanced through the Swarajya mag article. My impression is that it is poorly written. I tried to wade through the proposed Bill too. As a layman I would like to be informed what the present status of Law is, what changes are proposed by the bill and what is wrong with the proposed changes.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
