Perhaps somebody has pointed out already. The shikshavalli portion of the Taittiriya Upanishad is an excellent account of the teacher-student relationship, particularly the 11th Anuvaka beginning with *vedamanūcyācāryo'ntevāsinamanuśāsti.* Then the mantras of the *āvahantī homa* are also relevant.  
  

As for the synopsis on teacher - student relationship from my book *The Ritual Traditions of India,* please give me some more time.
