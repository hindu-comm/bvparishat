Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
  
In my research on varnasrama topics, I am currently working on dress  
(attire) for dvijas, especially brahmanas. It is known in tradition  
and from many traditional scholars and brahmanas that adhah-vastra for  
a dvija brahmana grihastha was pancha kaccha dhoti. This is found all  
over India and in all sampradayas--either vaisnava or sankara.  
  
But I am unable to find references to panca kaccha and details in any  
of the literatures like puranas, smrtis, etc. If someone can provide  
some references it will be very helpful for me and save my much time.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara das
