\> Abstract:  
\>  
\> We shall present a brief outline the development of mathematics and  
\> astronomy in India from the Vedic period to early nineteenth century.  
\> The Vedic corpus itself indicates a basic knowledge of both astronomy  
\> and mathematics. Their further development in the ancient period may  
\> be seen in the texts Parāśaratantra, Vedāṅgajyotiṣa and  
\> Vṛddhagārgīya-jyotiṣa (in the case of astronomy), and in the  
\> Śulbasūtras and the canonical works on grammar and prosody due to  
\> Pāṇini and Piṅgala (in the case of mathematics).Then there were the  
\> various Astronomical Siddhāntas, some of which were summarised by  
\> Varāhamihira (c.550 CE). By the time of Āryabhaṭa (c.499 CE),  
\> Bhāskara I (c.629) and Brahmagupta (c.628), Indians had developed much  
\> of the mathematics that is currently taught in schools and many topics  
\> such as the computation of sines, combinatorial techniques and  
\> solution of linear and quadratic indeterminate equations, that are not  
\> taught in schools. They had also developed the basic models for the  
\> computation of planetary motion and eclipses, along with techniques of  
\> spherical astronomy. The further developments in astronomy and  
\> mathematics that are found in the works of Lalla (c.750), Mahāvīra  
\> (c.850), Śrīdhara (c.900), Muñjāla (c.932) and Śrīpati (c.1039), are  
\> summarised in the canonical works Līlāvatī, Bījagaṇita and  
\> Siddhāntaśiromaṇi of Bhāskara II (c.1150). Bhāskara also gave an  
\> erudite exposition of the methodology of Indian astronomy and  
\> mathematics in his expository commentaries. In this period, we also  
\> see several works on mathematics in different regional languages, and  
\> applications of mathematics in texts of prosody, music and  
\> architecture.  
\>  
\> During the period 1300-1800, we see further efflorescence of  
\> mathematics in the works of Nārayaṇa Paṇḍita (c.1350) and in the great  
\> commentaries and independent works written by Gaṇeśa Daivajña (c.1540)  
\> and Kṛṣṇa Daivajña (c.1600) and others. The tradition of astronomy was  
\> carried forward well into the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by  
\> Munīśvara (c.1646), Kamalākara (c.1658) and the monumental efforts of  
\> Rāja Jayasiṃha (c.1720-1740), and his mentor Sāmrāṭ Jagannātha, in  
\> order to update Indian astronomical theories and observational  
\> techniques. In South India, a great school of astronomy and  
\> mathematics flourished in Kerala, which was founded by Mādhava  
\> (c.1380) and carried forward by Parameśvara (c.1420), Nīlakaṇṭha  
\> (c.1500), Jyeṣṭhadeva (c.1530), and their disciples. This school is  
\> credited with two remarkable discoveries, viz., the mathematics of  
\> infinites series and the introduction of non-geocentric planetary  
\> models— which are hailed as the hallmarks of the genesis of modern  
\> science in Europe two centuries later, in the seventeenth century. The  
\> last important work of the Kerala School was Sadratnamālā (c.1819) of  
\> Śaṅkaravarman.  
\>  
\> While presenting the above outline we shall also indicate how a large  
\> part of the modern knowledge on the development of Indian astronomy  
\> and mathematics has indeed been the result of the dedicated work of  
\> many great Indian scholars in the last hundred years. Much of their  
\> painstaking work was largely carried out voluntarily, as there has  
\> been little support for the study of Indian knowledge systems in our  
\> institutions of higher learning. It is no wonder that, currently, we  
\> are indeed far from achieving a comprehensive understanding of the  
\> fundamental concepts and techniques, theories and methodologies and  
\> even the historical development of Indian astronomy and mathematics.  
\> Unlike in the case of other classical sciences of India, the vast  
\> corpus of manuscripts in Indian astronomy and mathematics has been  
\> extensively surveyed and documented during the last fifty years,  
\> mainly due to the pioneering efforts of David Pingree and K. V. Sarma.  
\> We find that of the estimated 9,000 source-works of Indian Astronomy  
\> and Mathematics (which are preserved in around 30,000 manuscripts),  
\> only about 150 texts were edited, and just 30 texts translated during  
\> 1800-1947. In the 75 years after Independence, there has been  
\> significant progress and another 300 texts have been edited and 65  
\> texts translated, many of them with detailed explanatory notes. Thus,  
\> only about 450 (or 5% of the estimated total) source-texts in Indian  
\> astronomy and mathematics have been edited and published so far; even  
\> among the published works, only about 95 texts have been seriously  
\> studied via translations and explanations with a view to bring out  
\> their technical (mathematical-astronomical) content. As regards the  
\> other classical sciences and knowledge systems of India, the fraction  
\> of available source-texts which have been edited/studied would perhaps  
\> be even smaller.  
\>  
\> There is an urgent need to review our national priorities and give due  
\> importance to the preservation, digitization, listing and cataloguing,  
\> editing & publishing, and promoting systematic studies of the large  
\> corpus of sources—including manuscripts, inscriptions, and other  
\> archival records, as also the surviving material artefacts and  
\> practices—of the great tradition of sciences and technologies and  
\> knowledge systems of India. Training young scholars for undertaking  
\> all these tasks should indeed form an integral part of the courses and  
\> research conducted in our institutions of higher learning.
