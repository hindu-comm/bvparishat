It appears from the MSS used in the publication of this book that it does not contain more than 9 paadas (out of 32). The manuscript of the Varendra Research Society, Rajshahi (Bangladesh) has not been used. The editor ofधातुप्रदीप (1919), Srish Chandra Chakravarti, says in his INTRODUCTION, p.1:

"We have not yet obtained a complete MS. of Tantra-Pradeepa. Out of its 32 padas or sections, only 16 are with us."

  

Is it that the MS. available at Varendra Research Society still inaccessible?

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
