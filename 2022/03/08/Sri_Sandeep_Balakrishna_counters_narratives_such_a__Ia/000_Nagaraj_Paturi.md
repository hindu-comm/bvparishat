There was a thread on Sri Srinivas Reddy's book Raya on this list.

  

He very clearly said [here](https://www.thehindu.com/books/srinivas-reddys-biography-of-krishnadevaraya-is-a-throwback-to-the-glorious-vijayanagara-empire/article31639683.ece):

  

"Another critical aspect that I examine is the persistent notion that Vijayanagara was a staunchly Hindu state in valiant opposition to the onslaught of Islam. This oversimplified narrative is something I wanted to re-evaluate and contextualise, especially in regard to Rayaâ€™s promotion of religious tolerance and multiculturalism."
