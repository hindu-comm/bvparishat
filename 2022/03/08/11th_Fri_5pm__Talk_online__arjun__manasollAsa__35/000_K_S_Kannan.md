Abstract:  
  
The talk introduces a part of the section on the *vinoda*-s, i.e., the past-times that occur in the fourth prakaraṇa of *Mānasollāsa*. Past-times connected with sheep, buffaloes, pigeons, dogs and fish will be covered along with aspects related to hunting. A brief mention of some important features related to music, musical instruments and dance will be made. The fifth *prakaraṇa* of the treatise connected with *krīḍā* – games and sports will be spoken about in detail. These include sports in the forests, water bodies, under moonlight, in darkness and with plants. There are also sports connected with extreme courage and deep love which will be delineated. The spectrum of past-times, games and sports discussed in the *Mānasollāsa* throw light on the creative minds of the Indians and the manner in which, any routine activity could be converted into a thing of joy and celebration. The detailed documentation by the author, Someśvara reveals the keen eye the author had both at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. The *Mānasollāsa* serves as a cultural encyclopaedia of classical India.
