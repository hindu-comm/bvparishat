Dear Dr. Sagar,

  

Completely agree with you.

Nahusha's Fall is allegorical reference to the slowing down of the solstitial limit which will come to a standstill soon, may be in a century (page 409 in my book). This movement is continuously measured only for a decade now. It may take one or two decades more to detect the change in the rate of movement - which is when the scientific community will get into action to probe why it happens so. That is when Vedic / Siddhantic version of equinoxes will get attention. Meanwhile the related tectonic disturbances have already started. Evidence found off Seattle and Vancouver. Collecting / sharing / analysing information with interest- groups as of now and will present them at a suitable forum.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
