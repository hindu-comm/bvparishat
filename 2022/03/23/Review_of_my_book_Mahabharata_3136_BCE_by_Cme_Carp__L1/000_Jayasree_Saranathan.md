Sharing the info on the review of my book "Mahabharata3136 BCE" by Come Carpentier de Gourdon [Book Review: Mahabharata 3136 BCE: Validation of the Traditional Date - Chintan (indiafoundation.in)](https://chintan.indiafoundation.in/articles/mahabharata-3136-bce-validation-of-the-traditional-date/)

On Deciphering the Year of the Mahabharata war and how it holds key to Harappan Culture in Firstpost[Deciphering the year of Mahabharata war and how it holds key to Harappan culture (firstpost.com)](https://www.firstpost.com/india/deciphering-the-year-of-mahabharata-war-and-how-it-holds-key-to-harappan-culture-10290131.html)

  

On how the conflict between Archaeoastronomy and astronomyshows that the earth's axis doesn't precess as proposed by the astronomytheory of precession of the equinoxes, published in Firstpost[Conflict between Archaeo-astronomy and Astronomy reveals new understanding of the Equinoxes-World News , Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/world/conflict-between-archaeo-astronomy-and-astronomy-reveals-new-understanding-of-the-equinoxes-10476301.html)

This revelationfrom archaeoastronomy and other documented dates of the equinox of the past forms a compelling reason for any future re-work on the precession theory. This revelation also raises a question on the tenability of using astronomy simulators for dating ancient Indic events.
