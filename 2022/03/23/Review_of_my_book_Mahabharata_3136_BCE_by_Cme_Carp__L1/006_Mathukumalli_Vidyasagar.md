Dear Dr. Jayasree,

  

As a scientist, I do believe that phenomena such as processionsshould be capable of being explained "scientifically." However, often this phrase is used to hide rather dogmatic views. So it would be worthwhile for some astronomers and "astrologers" (meaning those who are interested in the study of planetary motion and not fortune-tellers) to study the topic. I am not in the least competent to comment, but would be happy to be educated. As and when time permits, I will read up on the topic.

  

Your example of the lunar eclipse that could not be predicted using astronomy simulatorwas quite an eye-opener for me.

  

Best wishes.

  

Sagar
