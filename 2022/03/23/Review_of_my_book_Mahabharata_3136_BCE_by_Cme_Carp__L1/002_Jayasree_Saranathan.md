Thanks Dr. Sagar for sharing your views. Already my 5-part paper on the topic of precession published in the The Astrological eMagazine about a year ago is receiving good response from archaeo-astronomers from around the world. Some of them have taken my permission to use it and work upon it. Attached part of a recent interaction.

The paper can be read at <https://www.academia.edu/47853142/Siddhantic_Concept_of_Precession_of_Equinoxes_New_Revelations>

Nahusha's Fall given in the last few pages of my Mahabharata book has to be waited upon to generate mathematically computable model of the new concept of precession.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
