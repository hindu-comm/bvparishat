Dear scholars,

Rajasekhara in his Kāvyamīmāmsā quotes a passage from Yajurveda with the introductory remark तत्र याजुषः .

The passage is :योनिरुलूखलं शिश्नं मुसलं मिथुनमेवैतत्प्रजननं क्रियते ।

It seems that it is from the शतपथ ब्राह्मण.

Could anybody help me in locatingit?

Thankingyou in advance,

nks
