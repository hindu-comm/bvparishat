What can be helpful for enabling/enhancing Sanskrit research ? :  

Works like Prof. Cardona's *Pāṇini: A Survey of Research*

are required for *every discipline* in Sanskrit

(and with periodic updating/upgrading).

  

Of course, Potter's multi-volume encyclopedia plays some comparable role.

Yet specialised works are indeed required.

Importantly, there should be outlinings of what the major issues are,

and what the minor ones are.  

  

There is one of course for Alaṁkāra,

one for Yoga ( both mostly confined to bibliography).

  

Prof. Jha while at CASS, Pune, did produce a series of small bibliographies,

which is still better than nothing on the one hand,

and, on the other, indeed helpful for a beginner  

where a too exhaustive one can be somewhat overwhelming.

  

Such works are required for the Veda-s,  

for the Upaniṣad-s, for the Vedāṅga-s etc. etc.  

  

Indic Academy (or any kindred organisation) would do well to take up projects like this:  

they can divide (and subdivide) tasks in each field if necessary, make it a collective work even,

but produce material periodically - having short-term and long-term goals as would suit them.

  

Just a suggestion for what it is worth.

  

Many might have indeed felt this need,  

but the thought that articulating the same may trigger something

impelled me.
