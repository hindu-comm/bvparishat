The original is by Dayananda Saraswati (19th century)..

The elibrary version is an electronic compilation, which

I think carries all the information.

What we notice is that the the suukta is prescribed to have a svara or multiple swararas.

Different stanzas may have one chhanda or different chhanda variations.  

I am looking for any practitioners of this art.
