Friends,

  

Good morning.

A week ago, I had written for possible help with any insight to

the prosodic recitation of the vedas. I didn't hear much. I thought

to again remind the scholars towards this aspect of the vedas.

  

My reference is ऋग्वेद संहिता compiled by Swami Dayanada Saraswati

of Arya Samaja. This is the fifth edition of the collection published by  

a group called परोपकारिणी सभा from Ajmer, Rajasthan. The book lists  

the date as विक्रम संवत् 2010. The book was presented to me by a  

gentleman who had left India possibly at his old age and he left his  

books with me. I came in contact with such families forty years ago  

because of the need of priestly services since professional services  

did not exist. The perceived need pushed us to help establish the  

local SriLakshmi Temple that was inaugurated in 1989.

  

In this book, each सूक्त is indexed with four parameters -ऋषि, देवता, छन्द,

and स्वर. While ऋषि and देवता can be unique, छन्द and स्वर can change  

with the stanzas. Last Tuesday, we studied the सूक्त 86. It has ten stanzas.  

ऋषिः-गोतमो राहूगणः ; देवता - मरुतः; छन्दः - 1, 4, 8, 9 गायत्री, 2, 3, 7 पिपीलिकामध्यानिवृद्गायत्री, 5, 6, 10 निवृद्गायत्री; स्वरः - षड्जः Each stanza is  

printed with the diacritical marks of intonation.  

  

What I am looking for towards any recording or live tradition that might

be following these prescriptions for simulating the expression. I will

appreciate any pointer.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
