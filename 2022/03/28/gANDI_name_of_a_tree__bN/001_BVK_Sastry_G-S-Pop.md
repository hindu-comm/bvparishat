Namaste



On \< <https://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/5/2/110> **what kind of tree? is it known?** \>



Agreeing upfront that \< Samskrutham in Digital Devanagari script Online- Screen read \> is a ‘ tricky’ thing, And proof reading of online text is volunteer work based / and with interventions of mechanized - ‘ programmed -transliterations’.



Question: What is the ‘base form ( pada-prakruti) of the term that goes in to sutra and vyakhyana ?

Is there a typo for Kashikaa entry ? (snippets placed below with highlight).

Is there a shifted perspective interpretation in ‘ Language- rule commenting’ having a disconnect with ‘ 

Ayurveda- Practicing systems’?



‘Bilva and Nirgundi’ are part of shiva-worship, even to this day. Other names associated with ‘ nirgundi’ have allusions that can be connected meaningfully and significantly to the narratives associated with Arjuna’s story in Mahabharata.

I submit my suggestions below on the proximate sounding ‘Ayurvedic herbs’- ‘ Nirgundi’- and its medicinal properties listed as ‘Analgesic: (Acting to relieve pain) - Anti-asthmatic: (Treat or prevent asthma attacks) -

Anticatarrhal: (Remove excess mucus from the body).- Anti-inflammatory: (Reducing inflammation by acting on body mechanisms).-Antimicrobial: Active against microbes.- Carminative: Preventing the formation or causing the expulsion of flatulence.- Hepatoprotective: Prevent damage to the liver. Muscle relaxant: Relax or reduce tension in muscle.

Resource: [Nirgundi (Vitex negundo) Information, Benefits, Uses and Warnings - bimbima](https://www.bimbima.com/ayurveda/medicinal-use-of-nirgundi-vitex-negundo/1452/?msclkid=5534eab2af1c11ec956278b2cdc71de5#common_names_of_nirgundi) <https://www.bimbima.com/ayurveda/medicinal-use-of-nirgundi-vitex-negundo/1452/?msclkid=5534eab2af1c11ec956278b2cdc71de5#common_names_of_nirgundi>



Did the ancient bow men carry the seeds of ‘Nirgundi’ ( construed in commentary as ‘bow made out of ‘gaandi / gandi’- which is ‘softwood’
and unsuitable for weaponized hard applications in war ? ) ‘ganDa’ is another term to explore here meaning ‘a boil, an impediment’.



**If the ‘bow – warrior’ carried quick medicine on his bow,** **it sounds logically right to explore this line of semantic interpretation, taking recognition of ‘ Ayurveda- practices’ to understand ‘Panini- Samskruth Rules’**.

**The deeper question being : When and where the Samskruth (Vedanga- Bhashaa- Shikshana –sampradaya) got a disconnect from ‘ Ayurveda / Ayur-Yoga - Upaveda- Paribhashaa- shikshana- sampradaya ?)**



The term ‘Arjuna’ itself is referred to a ‘Tree’ in Ayurveda. Did the ‘grammar-commentators’ make a curved connection of ‘Ayurveda- Yoga in Panini sutra’ to the ‘ quasi-mystic names’ in Mahabharata characters and Purana’s , by popular convention ? Something to think over, in a situation where ‘Ayurveda - Pharmacopeia’ studies and technical terms are mapped to a ‘non-native cultural model and ‘ Non-Paninian Language semantic’ of ‘Pharmacopeia from Latin-Greek Language framework.
