Respected Scholars,

  

Pranam.

  

There is mention of a book named: '***Sannyas-Grahan Paddhati***' (Benares, 1998 Vikram Samvat) by Paramhansa Gopalanand on page 66 of '***A-History-Of-Dasnami-Naga-Sanyasis-by-Jadunath-Sarkar***'. (Please find the attachment)

  

A book bearing the same name was published by Chaukhamba Sanskrit Bhawan Granthamala No. 103, but it is not of Paramhansa Gopalanand.

  

Therefore, if anyone has any information regarding the book, then I earnestly request to kindly enlighten me regarding the same and help me finding it.

  

Regards,

Harshit.
