As the six-spoked wheel of the seasons turns, I see signs of an imminent spring here. ðŸ™‚.

  

I have always wondered why ancient Indian literature mentions six seasons (á¹›tu-s). Even here in the middle of the temperate zone, we experience only four seasons namely spring, summer, autumn and winter. In tropical Kerala, there is practically only one season - an eternal summer interspersed with monsoon rains, that arrive not necessarily during only monsoon. In the plains of India, there could be two seasons, a mild winter and a hot summer. Spring and autumn, if they exist, are too short to be of significance. In such a climatic zone, where are the six seasons? Are they there even in the Himalayan valleys like Kashmir?
