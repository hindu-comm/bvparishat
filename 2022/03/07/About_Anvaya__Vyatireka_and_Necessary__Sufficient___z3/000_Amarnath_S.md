नमो विद्वद्भ्यः,

  

  I have a question about Sanskrit Logic, versus Modern Mathematics.

  

 Is the Anvaya / Vyatireka concept in Sanskrit logic related to the concepts of Necessary and Sufficient Conditions in Mathematics? If so, request you to kindly show it with an example.

  

Thanks and Regards
