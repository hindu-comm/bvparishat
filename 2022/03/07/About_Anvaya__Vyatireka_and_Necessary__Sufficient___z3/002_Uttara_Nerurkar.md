Dear Shri Amarnath,

  

Yes, indeed they are related. You may like to read my paper in this regard here -https://www.indianvedas.net/article/darshan-shastras/पाश्चात्य-न्याय-में-अनुम/. I have shown other similarities of Anumana Pramana with Western methods, too. The paper is in Hindi though.

  

Regards,

  

Uttara
