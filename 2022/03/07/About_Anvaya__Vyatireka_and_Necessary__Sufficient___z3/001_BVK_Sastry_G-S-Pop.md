On \< Sanskrit Logic, versus Modern Mathematics …. Anvaya / Vyatireka logic related to Necessary and Sufficient Conditions in Mathematics? >



1. Related. Yes. Partially overlapping.

2. Related to \< Necessary and sufficient conditions> - No. Technicalities are different.

Context matters. [Numeracy, Maths and Statistics - Academic Skills Kit (ncl.ac.uk)](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/economics/sets-and-logic/necessity-and-sufficiency.html)



3. Example: 



-----------------------------------

See: [If X, then Y \| Sufficiency and necessity (article) \| Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/lsat/lsat-lessons/logic-toolbox-new/a/logic-toolbox--article--if-x-then-y--sufficiency-and-necessity)

<https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/lsat/lsat-lessons/logic-toolbox-new/a/logic-toolbox--article--if-x-then-y--sufficiency-and-necessity>

We use the concept of necessary and sufficient conditions to help us describe relationships between statements.

Necessary Condition

Suppose thatAAandBBare statements. We say that the statementAAisnecessaryfor the statementBBifBBcannot be true unlessAAis also true. In other words,BBrequiresAA. However it is possible forAAto be true even ifBBis not true. We write

A⇐BA⇐BFor example, supposeAAis the statement “you sit the exam” andBBis the statement “you pass the exam”. You cannot pass the exam without sitting the exam: sitting the exam is anecessarycondition for passing the exam. However sitting the exam does not mean that you will necessarily pass the exam.

Sufficient Condition

The statementAAis said to be asufficientcondition for the statementBBif knowing thatAAis trueguaranteesthatBBis also true. However knowing thatBBis true doesnotguarantee thatAAis true. That is,BBneedn't be a sufficient condition forAA. We writeA⇒BA⇒BFor example, supposeAAis the statement “you achieve an overall grade of over70%70%in all of the modules that you have studied as part of your economics degree” andBBis the statement “you get a first class degree in economics”. Achieving an overall grade of over70%70%in all of the modules that you have studied as part of your economics degree means that youwillget a first class in economics economics. However, getting a first class degree in economics doesnotnecessarily mean that you achieved a first in all of your economics modules.

Necessary and Sufficient Condition

We say that the statementAAis anecessary and sufficientcondition for the statementBBwhenBBis trueif and only ifAAis also true. That is, eitherAAandBBare both true, or they are both false. Note that ifAAis necessary and sufficient forBB, thenBBis necessary and sufficient forAA. We writeA⇔B.A⇔B.For example, the statement “I am a male sibling” is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the statement “I am a brother”.

Some ‘Naiyayika’ scholar may try to explain the ‘Anvaya –Vyapti-
Vyatireka’ in the modern example and see why the two concepts are related yet different.
