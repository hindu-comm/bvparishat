**Abstract**  
The encyclopedicwork *'Mānasollāsa'* is also known as *'Rāja-mānasollāsa*' - that which entertains rulers. However, its scope and vision are far greater, and they can enrich any person of taste and sensitivity. The third section of this great work is titled as Bhoga-viṁśati or 'Upabhoga-viṁśati' (“Twenty items of Comfort”) deals with various comforts that a king or a person of taste can enjoy. These comforts include those of residence, bath, footwear, betel chewing, perfumes, dressware, garlands, jewellery, furniture, fan, assembly and gathering, interaction with children, food, beverages, pedicure and massage, vehicle, umbrella, bed, fumigation by using incense as also the company of the spouse.  
  
The Vinoda-viṁśati (“Twenty items of Entertainment”) deals with various forms of entertainment that a king or men of taste can enjoy. These entertainments include poetry, poetics, dramaturgy and aesthetics, martial arts, horse-riding, elephant-riding, wrestling, fighting till death, cock-fight and the like. Just the list itself is highly inspiring and equally thrilling. The author Someśvara gives a detailed description ofevery item. As the author is giving these details from his first-hand experience, or at least from his vast learning that spans numerous sciences, arts, customs, cultural practices and the like, every observation is absorbing, unique and educative. But for such very few works, we cannot understand the rich lifestyle of classical and medieval India in its entirety. Here we can also know about the truly secular side of India in the positive sense and gain valuable information about its cultural heritage. This great work dispels all wrong notions about the so-called rift or cleavage between the *mārga* and the *deśī* and proves beyond doubt that our ancient society was not a divided house.

**About the Speaker:**  
Shatavadhani R Ganesh (b. 1962, Bangalore) is one of India’s foremost Sanskrit poets and scholars. He writes and lectures extensively on various subjects pertaining to India and Indian cultural heritage. He is a master of the ancient art of *avadhāna*, where he faces a group of eight (in *a**ṣṭāvadhāna*) or hundred (in *śatāvadhāna*) questioners and in response to their many queries, composes extempore poems set to meter; solves poetic challenges; solves a magic square; keeps track of the count of a randomly rung bell; and so forth. Dr. Ganesh performs *avadhāna* in Sanskrit, Telugu, and Kannada (he is credited with reviving the art of *avadhāna* in Kannada.) He is fluent in several languages including Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, Latin, Greek, Italian, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Hindi, and Marathi. He is well-versed in the Veda-s, Upaniṣad-s, the later smr̥ti texts, other systems of learning in the Indian spiritual and cultural canon like the Vedāṅga-s, the various classical texts on the arts like the Nāṭyaśāstra, and literature in Classical Sanskrit.  
  
He holds a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a master’s degree in Metallurgy as well as in Sanskrit. Hampi University awarded him a D. Litt. for his thesis, ‘The Art of Avadhāna in Kannada.’ Tumkur University awarded him an honorary doctorate (D.Litt.). He is a recipient of several awards and recognitions including the Badarayana-Vyasa Puraskar from the President of India for his contribution to the Sanskrit language.
