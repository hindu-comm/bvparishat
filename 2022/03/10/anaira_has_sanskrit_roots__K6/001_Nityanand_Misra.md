Dear Lokesh Johri Ji

  

Are you the same Lokesh Johri who asked this question on bvparishat three years ago? There was a discussion on that thread and several scholars had responded. I do not think Sanskrit has changed much since 2019, so let me redirect you to the thread in 2019.

If you are not the same Lokesh Johri, then this is surely a divine coincidence.
