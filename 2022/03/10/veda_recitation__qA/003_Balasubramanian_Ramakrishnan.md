Dear Misra-ji

  

Those are not instructions. An instruction would be a command or injunction to do something. The RShi, Chandas and devatA have to remembered for every Rg veda sUktam and explicitly brought into the conscious mind to get the benefit of chanting as per the orthodox reciters. So traditional reciters will just say those before every sUktam or mantra if it’s is extracted from a sUktam. In recordings this is usually skipped, possibly to conserve recording time.
