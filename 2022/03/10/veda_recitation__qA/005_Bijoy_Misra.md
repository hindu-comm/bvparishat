I should also add that the सूक्त was most likely taught one on one

by the composer. The composer himself is the reciter. So the person

who learns might have a selection process or be groomed through the

family. I have not studied when it might have gone public to be recited

without the help of the original clan. Then they have become printed text  

where the recitation is fairly flat with threepitches. स्वर identification

is different than pitch.
