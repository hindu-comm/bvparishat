Dear Sri Ramakrishnan,  

On every सूक्त there are several lines of introduction (instruction) , ऋषि, देवता, छन्द, स्वर.  

Different variations of  छन्द are instructed for different stanzas. It appears that

the छन्द is built into the composition, which it should be. I want to find out if any  

one here tried to explore or if any old recording that one might know of.

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
