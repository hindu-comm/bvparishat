The 1929 edition is also there:

<https://archive.org/details/NDTv_amar-shatak-of-amaruka-with-commentary-of-arjunavarmadev-by-durga-prasad-1929-nirnay-sagar-pres/page/n3/mode/2up> .  

  

If the 1954 edition is still absolutely needed, and if there are no copyright issues, I can send a PDF of it.
