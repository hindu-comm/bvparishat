“Kāṟṟinilē varum gītam …” (காற்றினிலே வரும் கீதம் …). Beautiful song in the sweet voice of M.S. Subbalakshmi.

  

If you listen carefully, you can hear that she pronounces the ṟṟ as a ṯṟ (where ṯ is an alveolar sound) unlike some hyper correct modern people pronouncing it as ṭṟ with a retroflex ṭ. 

  

In spoken Tamil ṟṟ went out of use a long time ago, perhaps more than a thousand or thousand five hundred years ago, to be replaced by the dental tt. So, kāṟṟŭ (wind) became kāttŭ with dental tt in spoken Tamil. It remains kāṯṯŭ with alveolar ṯṯ in Malayalam.

  

I suspect the ancient pronunciation of ṟ was indeed an alveolar ṯ. And obeying South Dravidian pronunciation peculiarities, it becomes a voiced alveolar ḏ in intervocalic positions or when preceded by a nasal. Thus, ṉṟ might have been pronounced as ṉḏ and not as ṉḏṟ or ṉḍṟ.
