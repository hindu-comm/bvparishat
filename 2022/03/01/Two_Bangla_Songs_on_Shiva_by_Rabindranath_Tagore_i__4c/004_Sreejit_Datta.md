Namaskar:

Dear Dr Paturi, Prof Mahulikar, Kushagra Ji,

  

Thank you very much for your comments, suggestions, and words of appreciation. Your kind words encourage me to continue bringing more material from Rabindra-Sahitya to those who do not read Bangla.

  

I am consciously using archaism for translating certain songs, not all, in the hope of conveying some of the solemn grandeur of the literary 'Sadhu Bangla' wherever Tagore has deployed it, as opposed to the more colloquial 'Chalit Bangla' which too has been used elsewhere by him. With regard to transliteration, publishing in a web portal has challenges of its own, and some kind readers have asked for transliteration earlier as well. God willing, I intend to publish these translations in a volume where I hope to make use of the page layout to provide the original, the Roman transliterated song, and my translation - all three in an easily accessible manner. Once again, thanks for your kind comments and suggestions.

  

Pranam-s,

S Datta
