Professor Datta-Ji,

  

The translations, especially the first one, are very Shelley-esque. Congratulations on making more of Rabindra-Sahitya accessible to non-Bangla speakers.

  

Many years ago, I picked up Bangla from an acquaintance and used to be able to read Bangla newspapers. However, I have now forgotten the script. So, if you could also provide a link to transliterations of the original in your posts, it would be much appreciated by readers with a similar level of familiarity.  

  

Sincerely,

Kushagra
