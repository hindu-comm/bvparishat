Dear Sri. Kushagra,

  

It is nice to see that you have composed so lucid mandaakraantaa-s on Shiva for this great occasion. Your style is simple, direct, pleasant and yet sublime at places. This much of grasp over the language, metre and diction are certainly laudable. May your talent see grater heights soon. Others too shall get inspired by such stading examples.

  

With warm regards

  

  

Ganesh
