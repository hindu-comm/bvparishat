***About the Topic***

*Citrādhyāya* and *Nr̥tyādhyāya* in *Mānasollāsa*  
Exclusive Chapters on Painting, Sculpture and Dance

  

The encyclopaediac Sanskrit work *Mānasollāsa* is a great contribution from the land of  
Karnataka to Indian history, literature and culture. It appears that Someśvara, the author,  

was the first from the region of Karnataka to write about dance and dance-techniques.  

The great work gives a fairly good account of the methods and techniques of painting,  

and may be the only text from Karnataka dealing with the subject.  

  

While discussing the decoration of the interior of palaces, sites and buildings,  

Someśvara states that the walls of the palaces can be made beautiful by covering them  

with crystals or with graceful pictures. The art of painting is considered the best among  

the various fine arts. The chapter on visual arts, painting and sculpture is part of the  

third *prakaraṇa* known as Gr̥hopabhoga, and contains 905 *śloka*-s. This is the longest  
*adhyāya* (Chapter) in *Mānasollāsa*. He explains here the methods of preparing *vajralepa*  
(adamantine paste), painting brushes, and pure and mixed colours. The study of this  

vast material is of great importance for an understanding of the history and culture  

of our great heritage.
