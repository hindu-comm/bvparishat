"The month of Maha Shivaratri is the penultimate month of the year,
the tithi of Maha Shivaratri is the penultimate day of the dark fortnight.  

  

maagha is the penultimate month of the year. bahula chaturdashi is the
the penultimate day of the dark fortnight.

  

It is part of S'is'raritu.

  

Cyclic time of Indian traditions is exemplified in Day-Night cycle, Moon's waxing and waning cycles, cycles of six seasons in a year etc.



Night is Shiva's, Day is Vishnu's. That is why Shiva Ratri is a Ratri festival.

  

Waxing is Vishnu's Waning is Shiva's. That is why moon's waning fortnight , bahula paksha is Shiva's. That is why Shiva Ratri is in Bahula Paksha.

  

S'is'ra ritu is Shiva's.



In fact Maasa shiva ratri occurs in every month Chaitram, Vaishaakham etc. Monthly Shiva Ratris are also the penultimate days of the dark fortnight only.



The same in the penultimate month of the year is the 'Maha' Shivaratri.



By the by, the penultimate part of the night is the core time of Maha Shivaratri. It is called lingodbhava kaala.
