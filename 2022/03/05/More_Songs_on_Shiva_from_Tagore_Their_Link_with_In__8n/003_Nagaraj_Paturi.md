Thanks Sri Sreejit for that nuance.

  

But Tagore's Gitanjali has a clear avoidance of Hindu Vedic or Puranic Devata names and other Vedic and Puranic motifs.

  

For those who know Tagore through such poems, the poems that you are bringing out certainly come as a revelation.

  

This shows that a more nuanced holistic picture of Tagore's worldview vis-a-vis Hindu traditions is yet to be brought out.
