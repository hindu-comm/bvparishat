Namaste Sir,

  

I fully agree with the last line. However, I'd like to draw your kind attention to words used in just a few song lyrics from Tagore's *Gitanjali* - the English version of the anthology:

  

1\. Entry No. LIII (Vishnu, Garuda)

2\. LXXVI (Bhuvaneshvara)

3\. LXXII (Maya)

  

Please also consider a few song lyrics from the Bengali Version (which is not identical to the English version of the *Gitanjali* in terms of songs included in the anthology) which I have recently translated:

  

1\. *Amar Nayono Bhulano Ele*:[Two Songs of Tagore VIII - Swatantra Mag](https://swatantramag.com/two-songs-of-tagore-viii/)

2\. *Nibhrito Pranero Debota*:[Two Songs of Tagore – VII - Swatantra Mag](https://swatantramag.com/two-songs-of-tagore-vii/)

3\. *Amar Matha Nato Kore Dao*:[Two Songs of Tagore – XIII - Swatantra Mag](https://swatantramag.com/two-songs-of-tagore-xiii/)

  

There are many more such examples throughout both versions of Tagore's *Gitanjali.*

  

Pranam-s,
