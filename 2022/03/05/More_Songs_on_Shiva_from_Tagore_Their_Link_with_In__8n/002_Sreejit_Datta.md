Namaste Sir.

  

Thanks for your kind appreciation.

  

I am not sure if such work has been carried out by Tagore scholars. Having said that, I feel that it is difficult to maintain tenable categorisation of his works on this line (Brahmo/Non-Brahmo). Tagore, following in the footsteps of his father Maharshi Debendranath, has consistently laid claim upon their Hindu identity while solemnly observing the aachara-s of their Varna, a hallmark of the Adi Brahmo Samaj leadership from which newer factions like Nava-Vidhan or Sadharan Brahmo Samaj split off. And for this reason, Tagore spontaneously drew from traditional Hindu terms, concepts, imageries, tales, and symbols while composing his poetry and songs, including those belonging to the genre of "Brahmasangeet" - a body of religious songs to which authors from Rammohan to Swami Vivekananda to Tagore and subsequent generations have made significant contributions.   
  

Pranam-s,

Sreejit
