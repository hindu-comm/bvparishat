*Notes on the second of the two songs translated here:  
*  
Set in the refreshing melodic scale of Raga Desh, which evokes the first shower of the Indian monsoons and the petrichor emanating from the rapidly drying grass watered by it, the song "*Haye Ke Dibe Aar Shantona*" expresses an earnest and powerful appeal of a yearning heart to its *Ishta Devata*. And yet, it is not a plaintive cry of the devotee in agony, but the exuberant plea of one whose heart, though it is scarred by many desertions, is still full of hope and longing for a true friend. Had it not been so, Tagore wouldn't have set it in Raga Desh. Many of his apparently plaintive numbers are set in more sombre tunes, often with the goal of directing the mind inward rather than drowning it in a hopeless despair. The emotion that Tagore evokes through this song is not melancholy but the resolution required of a devotee attuned to God in the purest Bhakti Yoga.  
  
P.S. Do listen to the original songs using the link provided under the title. Each of the translated songs are accompanied by such links.
