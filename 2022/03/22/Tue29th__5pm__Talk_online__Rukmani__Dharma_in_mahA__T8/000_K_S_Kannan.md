***ABSTRACT***  

  

****The Mahābhārata is primarily a cultural text with emphasis on the practice of Dharma.  

When Duryodhana asked for the blessings of his mother Gandhari before going to the battle  

her words were ‘Dharmo Rakṣati Rakṣataḥ’ which reinforce the fact that the Mbh gives  

paramount importance to Dharma. Composed during a long period of 1000 years (c. 500BCE-500CE),  

the Mbh reflects the many changes that had come into the notion of Dharma by its time.  

The Varṇāśrama dharma was not the only dharma that held sway in society now.  

The common dharmas (sādhāraṇa darmas) such as ahimsā, satya, asteya, brahmacarya and aparigraha  

had also come to stay as a result of religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, etc present in society.  

  

This talk will illustrate with examples how there was an adjustment process taking place  

amongst the different dharmas. When Arjuna hesitates to fight his elders standing opposite the Pandavas  

on the battlefield, it was not only his facing his gurus like Droṇa, Bhīṣma and others that troubled him;  

it was also its going against the principle of ahimsā that bothered him.   

  

The position of women was also undergoing some changes which is reflected when Draupadī  

questioned Yudhiṣṭhira in the assembly whether he had pawned her after losing himself first or afterwards.   

Her courage to question the ācāryas asking for justice in the court also points out that women had  

the courage to question the injustices in society against them. Characters like Sulabhā, Damayantī,  

Sāvitrī and others point out to the fact that women were taking decisions on their own and  

were becoming increasingly independent.  

  

This talk will historically situate the Mbh in the context of the many changes that have taken place,  

and using various examples will substantiate the claims made above.
