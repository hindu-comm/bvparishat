Dear Ramanujachar-ji

  

As per taittirIya-prAtishAkhyA 14.1, svarapUrvaM vya\~janaM dvivarNaM vya\~njanaparam, examples 3 and 4 should not have an alpa-prANa dakAra in the beginning of a sentence. It is not present in the grantha texts of vaidikavardhini press or the devanAgarI publication of Krishnamurti SasatrigaL and Sri Ganesha Dravid.

  

In all other places where there is a mahAprANa dhakAra followed by a consonant or preceded by a repha, the alpa-prANa dakAra is faithfully inserted, example shundhadhvam -> shundhaddhvam samhitA 1.3.

  

I have also been taught that way by sampradAyavits. Is this some other variant tradition?

  

Thank you

  

Ramakrishnan
