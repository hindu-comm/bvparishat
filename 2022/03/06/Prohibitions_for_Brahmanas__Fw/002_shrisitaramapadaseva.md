Namaskar Sriman,

  

Factually, in older times, when the Varnasrama system was intact, the Brahmana was never worried about maintenance. The society as such provided it. But in today's society, some of us have to engage in professions other than our forefathers to make do.

  

My attempt is find out things that are expressly forbidden.

  

Thank you.
