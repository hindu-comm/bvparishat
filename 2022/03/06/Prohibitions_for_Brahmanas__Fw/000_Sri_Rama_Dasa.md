Namaskar to all,

  

I have been researching the matter of prohibitions for sale of items by brahmanas.

  

One quote from Sri Vidura from Mahabharata is currently serving as the chief source.

  

"Brahmana should never be a seller of salt, of cooked food, curds, milk, honey, oil, clarified butter, sesame, meat, fruits, roots, potherbs, dyed clothes, all kinds of perfumery, and treacle.

  

avikreyaṃ lavaṇaṃ pakvamannaṃ dadhi kṣīraṃ madhu tailaṃ ghṛtaṃ ca \|

tilā māṃsaṃ mūlaphalāni śākaṃ raktaṃ vāsaḥ sarvagandhā guḍaśca \|\| 5 \|\|"

  

MB udyoga parva section XXXVIII  

  

  

  

I have come across another but not able to trace the source.

  

"मासेन भवति शूद्रः, ब्राह्मणो रसा विक्रियात्।"

  

My questions are as follows:

1\. Are there similar prohibitions mentioned elsewhere?

2\. Is there any book / article / research paper which details these?

3\. Any lectures / talks on the matter are also welcome.

  

Thank you.

  

Jaya Shri Ram
