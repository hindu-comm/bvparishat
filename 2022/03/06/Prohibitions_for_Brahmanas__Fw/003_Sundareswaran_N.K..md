Gautama in his Dharmasūtra, states that a brāhmaņa can be vaiśyavrtti as आपद्धर्म.

However he is prohibited from selling some items.

In the seventh chapter of the first praśna he enumerates such items.

  

तदलाभे वैश्यवृत्तिः I

तस्यापण्यम् ।

गन्धरसकृतान्नतिलशाणक्षौमाजिनानि।

There're eight sūtra-s.

And some items he (the vaiśyavrtti brāhmaņa) is allowed to sell on a barter basis.
