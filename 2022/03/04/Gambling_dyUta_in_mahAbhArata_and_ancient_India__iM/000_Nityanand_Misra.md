*namo vaḥ*

  

I recently had a detailed conversation in Hindi ongambling (‘dyūta’) in Mahābhārata and ancient India with Sh. Arihant Pawaria on the Vaad YouTube channel.

Your comments and feedback are welcome, as always.

  

I plan to write a book on the topic some day.

  

Thanks,Nityānanda Miśra
