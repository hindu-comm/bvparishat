Correcting a coupe of typos. Please read the above as follows

  

Yes, the word चराचर (and similarly **चलाचल**) can also be derived from the compound of चर and अचर (चल and अचल). When derived this way, the meaning is different. Also, in this derivation, when the compound is a समाहारद्वन्द्व, this word is neuter by the rule 2.4.17 स नपुंसकम् (**चराचरयोः समाहारः** चराचरम्, as in व्याप्तं येन चराचरम्. When the compound isan इतरेतरद्वन्द्व, it an be in all genders but usually masculine plural (चराचराः).
