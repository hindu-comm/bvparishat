The repetition is usually of the first varNa only, right? Or of the whole word?

ya\~N-anta dhAtu like nenIyate, tAtapyate, pApachyate etc see only one varNa duplication.

  

In case ofचराचरwould it mean chara+ achara = moving and non-moving?  
Or just that which is moving too much? Which is exactly opposite in meaning of the word, as well as in context.

  

*akhila **charAchara** jagat* = entire ***living and non-living*** 'world'

but if it is to mean moving too much, then it would be entire extremely-moving world (excluding the non-living parts, matter of all kinds)

  

  

  

Thanks,
