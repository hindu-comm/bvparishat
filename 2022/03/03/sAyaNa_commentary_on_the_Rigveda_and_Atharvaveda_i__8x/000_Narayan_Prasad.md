Dear Scholars,  

   A Russian friend has asked me:

"Could you tell me where I can find Sāyaṇa's commentary on the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda with English translation? I am writing a work on the astronomical interpretation of hymn 164 from the first mandala of the Rigveda and am studying various materials about it."

  

  Since I am not a Vedic scholar, could anybody reply to this query?

  

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
