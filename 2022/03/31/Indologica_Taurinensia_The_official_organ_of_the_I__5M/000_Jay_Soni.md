Dear Colleagues,  
You might be interested to know about the bad and good news concerning the IT, The Journal of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies, edited chiefly by Professor Irma Piovano.  
She has allowed me to quote her email to the Members of the Scientific Committee of the IT:  
“Dear Professors, I’m deeply sorry to inform you that the AIT-Asia Institute Torino was obliged to stop the publication of the renowned journal Indologica Taurinensia founded by Prof.Oscar Botto in 1973. Indologica Taurinensia has been acknowledged as a “Journal of High Cultural Value” by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage ad Activities and was the official organ of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies -IASS. The 45 volumes published are available on line. Here are the relevant links:  

ASIA INSTITUTE TORINO : <http://www.asiainstitutetorino.it/>  

INDOLOGICA TAURINENSIA (voll. 1-45) : <http://www.asiainstitutetorino.it/indologica.html>  

CORPUS IURIS SANSCRITICUM (voll. 1-9) : <http://www.asiainstitutetorino.it/corpusiuris.html>  

DIZIONARIO SANSCRITO ITALIANO : <http://www.asiainstitutetorino.it/dizionario_sanscrito_italiano.html>  

The financial difficulties and the consequent organisational problems have led to this sad end. The negative influences on cultural activities resulting from the spread of the pandemic in the last two years must also be added.  

Also on behalf of the collaborators of the editorial staff I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Scientific Committee for the generous collaboration always offered to the Journal for so many years, guaranteeing its prestige and international reputation.”  

The IASS thanks Professor Piovano for trying hard to save the IT (albeit in vain) and expresses our deep gratitude for her commitment to the journal throughout the many decades.  
The websites will soon be completed with the last volume 45.  
With best wishes,  
J. Soni, Secretary General of the IASS
