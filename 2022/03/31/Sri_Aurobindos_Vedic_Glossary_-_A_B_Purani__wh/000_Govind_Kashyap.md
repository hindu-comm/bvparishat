Namaste to all vidwans,

  

Scanned copies of the Vedic glossary compiled by Shri A B Purani on Aurobindan lines are available in digital libraries and repositories online.

  

I need a physical copy of this book for reference purposes, preferably hardbound edition. I have tried to find out on the internet but have drawn a blank.

  

May I ask if this book is still in print? If you happen to know, could you please share the publisher's or the retailer's contacts?

  

with thanks

G Kashyap
