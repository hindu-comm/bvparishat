#####  

##### Just wanted to share some feedback regarding the course I taught this Quarter.

##### This course just ended (Winter Quarter - HUA)

##### Feedback from students who took the current course on*Advaita, Viśiśtādvaita, and Dvaita – The three flavors ofVēdāntaśāstra (the Hindu University of America - HUA)* 

##### 

-   What stood out for me was the volume of content and your expert
    weaving of the content. I was privileged to learn under your
    tutorship. Aum ---- Inderani Ramprasad -   Echo the same. Imagine how voluminous the actual texts are, the
    Upanishads, the Brahma Sutra, and the Bhashyas (commentaries)
    themselves. Imagine crystalizing an introduction and that too
    without needing any prior knowledge of Sanskrit and making it a
    meaningful learning experience for all of us. Great!

\- Raghav Raghunathan Ph.D. student, UC, Berkeley

-   Krishnaji, To add to this, the passion and dedication with which
    you taught the subject and the time you took to clear our doubts are
    remarkable. Thanks 🙏 - Anuradha Rao -   Krishnaji - it was a great task you took to teach the course to
    beginners who don’t have as much background/exposure to reading many
    texts. Yet you were able to convey so much valuable information in
    such a short time - so much so that I’m still having to go back and
    listen again and again. I get a new understanding each time with the
    learning from later lessons making many things clear from the
    earlier lessons. Thanks for not restricting class only to advanced
    students 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 - Manjula Ranganath
