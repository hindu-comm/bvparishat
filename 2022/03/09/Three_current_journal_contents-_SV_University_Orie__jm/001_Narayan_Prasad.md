Thank you sir for the information.

"Discontinuous Reduplication" (IJDL) is new for me. I have read many articles on reduplication and I myself have written article on it. But I was unaware of "Discontinuous Reduplication".

It appears strange that an article related to Bangla (Bengali) finds a place in IJDL.

Regards

Narayan Prasad
