Namaste, I had heard a few years back that a day in ancient India was divided into yaamas or pahars allocated for various categories of activities.

  

As in x number of pahars/yaamas for self , for artha, for leisure, etc.

  

Do we have any such reference in any text ? If yes, please share the same.

  

Thanks,

Vishal
