**Abstract:**

  

D.V.Gundappa popularly and fondly known as DVG remains one of India's greatest savants  

who upheld her ancient and timeless values, culture and philosophy. His entire corpus of writing  

spans over 20,000 pages and excluding the hard sciences, there is no subject that he has not touched  

and turned to gold. The volume of his writings on culture alone exceeds two thousand pages.  

These include the philosophical and the scholarly as also writings for the proverbial lay person.  

Among these, two monographs are rather exceptional and both of them in their own way,  

provide profound guidance for inner refinement and are akin to manuals for leading the cultured life  

in the truest sense of the term. These are*Baaligondu Nambike* (Conviction for Life)**and *Samskruti* (Culture)*.*  

Over the last five decades, the former work has seen multiple reprints and occupies a fond place  

in the hearts of the Kannada people. It is in reality a sublime and practical treatise of life  

viewed from the timeless Indian ideal of Purusharthas.

  

The present lecture will attempt to bring out both the essence and hopefully,  

some nuances of the two works.
