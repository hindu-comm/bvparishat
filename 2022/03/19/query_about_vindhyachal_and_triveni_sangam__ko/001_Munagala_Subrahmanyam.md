Sir please check the 71 verse again . Please see the attachments. Triveni is mentioned in moola shankara vijaya also.

  

Pardon me sir . That agasthya - vindhya issue seems to be upama alankara prayoga .

  

According to puranam VINDHYACHALA GARVA BHANGA was Agasthya's contribution . Now it's used in Shankara . It's upama alankara prayogam .

  

The vindhyachala we are discussing here is just used for the sake of alankara prayoga not of geographical location .

  

If any errors in my opinion scholars were requested to correct me .

  

Sorry for inconvenience .

  

Thanking you sir .
