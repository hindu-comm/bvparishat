Dear scholars, namaskars,

  

1\. As I read the ''Madhaviya Shankara vijayam'' there is a description of the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna in Prayag. This is in chapter 7 (verses 61 to 70). Thereis no mention of Saraswati and what we now call triveni sangamam. Commentator Dhanapati surimentioned the name Triveni (इत्येवं त्रिवेणीं स्तुवन्) in his note on verse 71 but there is no such indication in the text. How has the name come about?

2\. In the same description, it is said that Shankaracharya moved southward, it is said, but it is south with reference to Kaasi. There is the name of Vindhyachal which is between Kaasi and Prayag, which is about 60 kms from Kaasi. Thetext also mentions Agastya who is saidto have crossed it and went southward. We normally have an impression that Agastya crossed the Vindhya mountains which gave access to the south of India as we know now. The Vindhya range of MP does not seem to extend up to Kaasi. Which was the Vindhya crossed by Agastya?
