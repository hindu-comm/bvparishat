Prof Iyengar has been recognized for his earlier professional work

which is a commendable skill recognition. It is a blessing that he has chosen

to look into Indian scriptures analytically to discover the motivation  

behind the statements. Let us wish him continued life such that he may

continue to apply his insight into the mysteries of empirical literature.  

I express my gratitude to his help and scholarship.
