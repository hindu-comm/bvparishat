CVS, a non- profit organization**(first of its kind in the country exclusively on Vibration)**has been formed by few expert professionals dedicated in Vibration Science and Engineering, both from academia and industry in order to scale up the reach of this inter-disciplinary specialization. There could be need to address design-reviews/ reengineering in systems/components from the site-experiences of vibration-induced flaws, to bring an awareness in every industry on huge energy-savings possibilities from machines with undesired high vibration and to speed up the vibration diagnostics and prognostics mechanism to a higher level of accuracy through the effective management of vibration knowledge empowering the engineers with necessary world-class skills and theoretical inputs along with specialized certifications on Vibration.
