Dear Nityansnda ji,

  

I have collected a lot of material- Marathi books,articles etc.- on the famous Ramarakshastotra, including the ones you require.

  

The entire bunch,however,is in Vadodara and at present,i am out of Vadodara for a couple of months.I can send the same to you after I reach Vadodara,provided you are ready to be patient with me.

  

Am very happy that you intend to work on the Ramarakshastotra. I do hope that you know that Dr. Gudrun Butteman or some such scholar has written - some 25-30 years back- a very good and scholarly book in English on this subject.Its Marathi translation is also with me.

  

All this could be sent to your good self after a couple of months or even earlier if I reach Vadodara in very near future.

  

Best of luck in your studies on this very famous and efficacious stotra much prevalent in Maharashtra.

  

Warm regards,

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar

Vadodara.9427339942.
