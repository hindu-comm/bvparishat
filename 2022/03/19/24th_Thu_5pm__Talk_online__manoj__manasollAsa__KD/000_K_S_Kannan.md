**ABSTRACT** *  
*

*Mānasollāsa* or *‘Abhilaṣitārthacintāmaṇi’* is an encyclopedic composition   
by the later Chalukyan emperor Someśvara. This work furnishes information,  

in the chapter titled ‘*Gr̥hopabhoga’*, with regards to architecture and iconography.  

This is a very comprehensive chapter containing 925 verses. Information about ‘*citralekha’*  

i.e. about painting is also quite elaborate, mentioning even minor details meticulously.  

Though no direct reference to temple building or making of sculptures is discernible,  

information found in this work can be compared with other *vāstugranthas* and  

their application can be understood. It would be more beneficial if this chapter  

is compared with the texts ‘*Manuṣyālayacandrikā’* and *‘Nāradasaṁhitā’*  

which mainly concentrate on civil constructions.
