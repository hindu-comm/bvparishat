In fact, just as an information for the members of this list - it is possible to edit the forms (also sutra commentaries etc) on your end as well - Just click the pencilicon(please see the attached image) and you can make the necessary fixes. The changes will get approved in a day and then they will appear on the website.

  

The pencil icon is available when one visits the website using a computer, but not using a mobile phoneas editing may not be practicalusing a mobile phone.  

  

Thanks

Neelesh
