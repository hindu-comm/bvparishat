In theDhāturatnākara ofMuni Lāvaṇya-Vijaya-Sūri, the form given for दिश्+यक्+लृट् प्र.पु. ए.व. is देक्ष्यते. What do other *dhātu* concordances give as the form for दिश्+यक्+लृट् प्र.पु. ए.व.? On [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com) (which I often refer), the form given for दिश्+यक्+लृट् प्र.पु. ए.व. is देशिष्यते, under this link (<https://ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/06.0003?type=yak>). The source is not given for the form. Request Neelesh Bodas Ji to check and confirm the source.

  

I have not had the time to check the *prakriyā*, but what is the correct Pāṇinian form? I have a feeling it should be देक्ष्यते. I have come across the usage उपदेक्ष्यते (in the sense ofज्ञापयिष्यते) in यक्, and a Google Books search shows many published books with this usage. In contrast, I could not find an attested usage of उपदेशिष्यते.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
