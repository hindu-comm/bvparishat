Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

   In support of the statement "Each edition of any book is important for researchers", I presenthere only two examples - one from Sanskrit grammar and the other from a research work on the Bhagavad Gita.

   (1) Consider the suutra रो रि (P.8.3.14) and itsnyAsa commentary (A) edited by Swami Dwarika Das Shastri, Vol.6, 1985, p.495 (B) जयशङ्कर लाल त्रिपाठी, Vol,10, 2000, p.284 -- and compare the passage "इह यदि पदस्येति स्थानषष्ठी स्यात् ... तेनापदान्तस्यापि भवति।" with the one published from Rajshahi in 1925, p.1040,

  

<https://archive.org/details/UpYR_kashika-vritti-with-nyasa-commentary-by-acharya-jinendra-buddhipada-and-padamanj/page/n513/mode/2up>  

  

   In both the later editions one line has been inadvertently omitted !

   Please refer to pp.400-401 from"न्यास पर्यालोचन"(1979) (scans of the relevant portions attached for ready reference).

  

  (2) Consider "Quest for the Original GITA" by Dr G.S. Khair, 1969, p.25 and its second edition, both published by Somaiya Publications Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, p.29.

     There are many passages in the second edition in which certain lines have been inadvertently omitted. Although it is supposed to be a revised edition. But nothing has been revised, except the pagination. I purchased the 2nd edition and felt problems in understanding certain statements. So I borrowed from the library the first edition of the book and compared the required passages and the matter was clear.

  

    Regards

    Narayan Prasad
