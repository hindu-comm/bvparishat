Dear all,  

We are profoundly shocked to learn that Professor Ujjvala Panse Jha, a distinguished scholar in the field of Indian Philosophy and other disciplines is no more. May her departed soul attain the divine bliss and *sadgati*. I fondly remember many sweet memories associated with her. I express along with so many my heart-felt condolences to Professor V.N. Jha and other members of the family.

Best

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
