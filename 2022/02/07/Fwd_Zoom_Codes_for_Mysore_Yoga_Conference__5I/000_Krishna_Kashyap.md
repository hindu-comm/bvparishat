Namaste everyone,

Welcome to Mysore Yoga Conference 20022! Thank you all very much for your support and participation in our conference. We have an excellent lineup thisyear. Special thanks to our organiser in Mysore, Dr. M. A. Alwar for getting outstanding speakers once again! When you hear what these speakers have to say youwill understand thegreat gift we have been given. We also want to thank the excellent Yoga Teachers from various countries who will be sharing their asana techniques and perspectives on yoga with us. We look forward to sharing this wonderful experience with you! Please contact me if youhave any questions or difficulties joining the sessions. Recordings will be sent via Google Drive after the conference.

  

We believe very strongly in the quality and nature of the education that Mysore Yoga Conference provides. If you feel inclined to tell your friends and yoga students about our conference or make posts in social media it is always appreciated. I will attach the poster of the conference as well as a few social media posts in case they are useful to you.

  

All the best, Andrew
