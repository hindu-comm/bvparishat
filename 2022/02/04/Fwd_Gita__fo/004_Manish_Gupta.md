Thanks. Valid points!

How do you see this in today's context?

Many people today with Brahmin surnames are much involved in business activities, in fact they are good businessman. In what varna would you put them today - Brahmin or Baniya? Question can be put otherwise also.

  

Thank you!

  

Kind regards

MG
