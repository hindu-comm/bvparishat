Dhanyavada, Nagaraj ji for posting the link to Sahishnu's article on the saptapadi on this forum. His article follows the original piece he wrote for India Facts last November:

  

<https://www.indiafacts.org.in/to-give-or-not-to-give-kanyadana-in-an-age-of-idiocy-and-instantaneity/>

  

I do hope that the learned ones here will read and comment, and let Sahishnu know if they have any questions for him.

  

With regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
