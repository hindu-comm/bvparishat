Namaste to vidwans,

  

There are several institutions and universities offering courses on Jyotish. But the information available on the internet regarding good institutions offering MA or other courses in Jyotish (Vedic Astrology) is rather sketchy/incomplete. The internet is awash with unnecessary material, and this is frustrating for a student wishing to find about good institutions or courses in Jyotish.

  

I have found out about a few basic things about -

-   BVB Mumbai, Delhi (KN Rao's curriculum, only physical classes, but
    am not clear if they offer in online mode also),
-   ICAS (India-wide chapters, but not a university),
-   Potti Sreeramulu University in Hyd (but am unsure about course
    mode - regular or distance? or the medium of instruction - Telugu or
    English?), and
-   IGNOU (new MA Jyotish course, only Hindi medium).

I would request knowledgeable members, if they get the time, to pls let me know of any their experiences with these above-mentioned institutions or courses, and consider letting me know other well-regarded institutions/courses reg Jyotish that they are aware of, as I am sure there are other well-regarded institutions and courses that I don't know about.  

  

with thanks,

G Kashyap
