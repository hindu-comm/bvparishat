Thanks a ton. Yes, most of the time in Telugu and Sanskrit the names are same. But sometimes they are different. Champakamaala in Telugu is paMchakAvali or sarasI or DhR^itashrI in Sanskrit.Similarly taralam in Telugu is saralam in Sanskrit. (na, bha, ra, sa, ja, ja ,ga - but this does not parse in the above appspot link).

  

Thanks and regards,
