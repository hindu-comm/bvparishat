*ABSTRACT of the Talk* :



Costumes of a civilization are studied as a means of understanding people, their thinking, tastes and culture.  

Studies have tried to characterize the dominant style of different periods, civilizations and geographies.  

These dominant styles are known to evolve over time, some trends persist, some others are conjectured to be loaned or borrowed.  

Much of these analyses are descriptive in nature and numerical analysis of the same are rare.  

Numerical analysis requires an objective description and a comprehensive set of features that is culture agnostic.  

  

We propose that the subjective ‘feel’ of a costume due to their interaction with the human body is an importantpersonal aspect of costumes.  

We also believe that costume-anatomyinteraction can serve as the basis for an objective feature set.  

We hypothesize that a numerical encoding based on the costume-anatomy interaction and  

consequent numerical analysis can throw light on features of costumes that change or remain immutable over time or geography.



In this talk we describe such a novel numerical encoding of costumes based on the interaction of costumes with human anatomy.  

Using numerical data analysis methods on a set of costumes from ancient to contemporary periods, we show that  

costumes of different epochs and cultures from India and abroad are separable in the two dimensional principal component space.  

We use the Eigen costumes to analyze the immutable similarity in Indic costumes through the ages and the contrasting features  

between Indic and non-Indic. We further dwell into primary sources to demonstrate that these characteristic features of Indic costumes  

were very likely considered and deliberate choices motivated by Yoga in order to induce beneficial effects on prāṇa.  

We hope that this work will be a small first step for an alternate way of deriving insights into sartorial trends  

in various archeological specimen using methods from life-sciences and computation.

Mohan Raghavan researches and teaches at the Department of Biomedical Engineering  

in the broad area of computational neuroscience and motor systems in particular.  

His lab is focused on building 3D multiscale multidisciplinary computational models of  

human movement machinery spread across the spinal cord and its integration it with musculoskeletal systems.

He was founder and Co-Head of the Center for Healthcare Entrepreneurship at IIT Hyderabad from 2015-18  

where his work centred around bringing together academic research, design thinking methodologies and healthcare technology  

for benefit of society at large. He has mentored several startups in the area of healthcare.

He has been a post-doctoral fellow at National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore  

and holds a PhD in the area of computational neuroscience from IISc, Bangalore.  

Prior to entering academics, he spent 7 years at Motorola, where he was part of the team  

that developed the world’s first 3G mobile phone.

Mohan is passionate about Indology and researches on Indic concepts using scientific methodologies.  

Over the last 20 years, he has given numerous lectures in English and Kannada and  

conducted workshops on the scientific basis of Indic culture. He has contributed  

numerous articles to web journals and writes regularly in regional newspapers (Kannada).  

He writes short fiction that deal with cultural themes embedded in a contemporary context.  

One of his short stories titled ‘One night stand in Hariharapuram’ was published by Penguin  

as part of the anthology ‘Love stories that touched my heart’.
