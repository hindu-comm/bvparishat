Namaskar,

  

I am looking for Narad puran which has 38 or so adhyayas... it seems there are two Narad puran.. one has 2 parts.... where as the one I m looking has 1 part with less( 38 or so) adhyayas... I m looking for original Sanskrit text

  

Can anyone please guide me to online version or book?

  

Regards to all
