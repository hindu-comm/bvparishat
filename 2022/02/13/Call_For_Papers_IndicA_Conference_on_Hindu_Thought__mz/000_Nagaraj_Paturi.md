Indica plans to organize a*Hindu Thought on Ethics, Law and Justice*conference at Hyderabad on May 27-28 (Fri-Sat), 2022. The primary objective of this conference is to foreground new insights related to ethics, law, and justice from  

1\) Hindu primary sources in languages indigenous to the Indian subcontinent (like Sanskrit and Tamil, amongst others) or

2\) published secondary sources in English that have engaged with primary sources of Hinduism.

Respondents are encouraged to articulate clearly, in the course of their paper, what research questions the essay is looking to address, why those questions merit attention, and what, in their view, is new in their submission.

At the outset, we would like to clarify that this conference is not on Hindu Law, any component of it, or any existing law related to Hindus or Hinduism. Neither is this a conference on*Smṛti*-s, presented in modern times, often wrongly, as ancient Indian books of the law of Hindus.*Smṛti*-s and other texts may be used as sources of discussion on the conference’s theme, as explained hereafter.

This conference will focus on what, in contemporary parlance, is called jurisprudence in the academics of law. It covers legal theory and legal methodology, dispute settlement processes, and the resolution of ethical, legal, and justice issues as available in traditional Hindu textual sources. The conference also focuses on justice and concepts such as fact, evidence, truth, and natural law, which are fundamental to understanding ethics, law, and justice issues found in traditional Hindu sources. The methods of proof, argument, argumentation, reasoning, debate, and conclusion as available in the traditional Hindu practices of studies used in the legal and judicial practice will also be an essential focal point.

Most jurisprudence studies across the globe acknowledge ‘modern’ developments in western societies as the origins of contemporary jurisprudence and legal theories and as responses to religious dominance in legal ideas of premodern times, secularisation, and bringing reason into a faith-based system. Amongst what is problematic in this view of contemporary jurisprudence and legal theory is the underlying assumption that ‘premodern’ cultural traditions worldwide have the same ‘religious’ aspects as those of the Abrahamic religions to which the ‘modern’ jurisprudence was a countering reaction. The conference intends to bring out the problems with such assumptions, particularly in the context of the ideas in the traditional Hindu sources, particularly from the point of view that many of those countering responses would not have been necessary if they were in response to ideas in the traditional Hindu studies.

Another fundamental notion to which contemporary jurisprudence traces itself is the Natural Law of classical Greece. Whether or not the ‘classical’ Natural Law of the Greeks is the only ancient idea comparable to the contemporary ideas of jurisprudence is another focus of this conference, particularly from the point of view of philosophy in the traditional Hindu sources comparable to the ideas such as Natural Law.

Contemporary jurisprudence claims to be a theory of Positive law in contrast to or even in opposition to the Divine Law of the Abrahamic religions and Natural Law of classical Greece. Are Positive, Divine, and Natural the only three categories to view ‘law,’ or are there others? Are there other ways of viewing codes followed by or described/stipulated to be followed by human beings? How do the traditional Hindu theoretical sources deal with the issues that fall under the purview of this three-way debate?

How are the purposes claimed to be those of Positive law, namely protecting the rights of the individuals, the governed, resolving civil disputes, and maintaining order and safety in the society, achieved or proposed in theory to be achieved by the traditional Hindu philosophical sources?

While contemporary legal theories claim to separate legality and morality as one of their main achievements, they are still bound to ‘modern’ western philosophical notions of ethics such as realism, utilitarianism, and skepticism. What are the theoretical approaches available to analyze moral and ethical codes in the traditional Hindu philosophical sources, and how do these sources view the separation between morality/ethics and law?

A significant development during contemporary times is the reevaluation of the cultural background, worldviews, motives, and motivations behind the terms and terminology, the concepts and categories that these terms signify in various theoretical and practical fields. The conference will encourage such questioning concerning the fundamental concepts and categories in law and ethics from the perspective of Hindu thought as available in the traditional Hindu textual sources.

Abstracts (between 300 -500 words)are invited by 25th April,2022at [nam...@indica.org](). An online meeting of the scholars whose abstracts have been selected will be held on 30th April for a briefing on the conference protocols, following which the full papers are expected to be submitted by the 20th of May.

Indica will provide shared accommodation, arrange for local transfers in Hyderabad for participants not living in Hyderabad and reimburse domestic air tickets (economy class) for authors of selected articles. The option to present online will be available for scholars of selected papers who cannot travel. The conference will be conducted according to the prevailing COVID protocols and may be shifted to an online mode if required.

Dr. Nagaraj Paturi, Senior Director of INDICA, and Megh Kalyanasundaram, Director Special Projects at INDICA are the curators for this conference. Invited talks by experienced scholars and related expert practitioners are expected in addition to selected papers.
