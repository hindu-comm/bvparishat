Namaste,

  

Copying from character map is very cumbersome & time consuming, you dont have to do it at all.  

  

I use Bhasha IME -- <https://sites.google.com/site/bhashaime/>to directly enter texts in IAST or Devanagari.

  

and I find it one of the easiest methods to switch between Indic & Roman scripts.

  

Alternatively you can type in Devanagari & transliterate to IAST using Aksharamukha --

<https://aksharamukha.appspot.com/converter>

  

But I am sure this question has been asked by others so pls search the list archives for other suggestions.  

  

Regards,

Ramakrishnan
