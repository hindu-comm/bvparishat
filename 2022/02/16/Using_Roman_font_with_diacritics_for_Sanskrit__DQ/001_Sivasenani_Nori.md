Namaste

  

I have created shortcuts for various letters with diacritical marks. Example Alt+Shift+a = ã and so on. Then, I got used to these shortcuts.  

  

If you want to copy paste the letters, you can copy them from<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration#:~:text=Some%20letters%20are%20modified%20with,%C5%9B%20(%2F%CA%83%2F)>.

  

Regards

Senani
