This is a small software for windows platform that give a very easy  
way to type in diacritics for both, Unicode and non-Unicode formats.  
  
You can try it and see. Almost all Windows users in ISKCON use this to  
type their books and articles.  
  
NOTE: if it doesn't work properly then try changing the compatibility  
in properties of the exe file.  
  
Thank you,
