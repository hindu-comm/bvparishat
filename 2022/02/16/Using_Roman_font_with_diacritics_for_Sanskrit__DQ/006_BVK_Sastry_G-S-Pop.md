Namaskar all,



I am totally opposed to using any other script for Sanskrit or any other languages of Bharat. I consider thatan attack on our languages, with the ultimate aim of destroying them, and our surrendering to the attackers. Already you may have noticed the proliferation of the use of English words and numerals in our languages, particularly in Hindi and Marathi. Please help stop this trend and save our languages, our scripts and our cultural and religious heritage.



Those who want to learn the language should learn the script also. The Sanskrit alphabet is the most logically organized alphabet and does not require strange marking on the letters like the transliteration attempt does. The pronunciation does not requirea key.



Does anyone learn English or French in Devanagari or Tamil script? I don't think so. Why shouldwe allow the west to dictate how our languages are to be written?



Thank you.



Pradip Sagdeo
