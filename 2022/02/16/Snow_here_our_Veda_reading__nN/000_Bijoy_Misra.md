Dear friends,

Good morning from a snow-clad town in New England, USA.  

Yesterday, the floppy snow from the tall pine trees was blowing with

the air.  I have never understood what the phrase पुष्पवृष्टि meant

as a physical event. Back home I have seen the ground covered with  

the falling flowers, but the concept of a shower needs a height. I would

like to hear interpretations in literature as they might exist.

Also I wanted to report that our Veda reading sessions are continuing

regularly. A scholar from Chennai wanted to join and we have moved  

the session to Friday 8 PM our time, Saturday 6:30 AM in India. Also  

we have added aTuesday 8 PM session (Wednesday 6:30 PM in India).

We are now in सूक्त 80. We cover about a dozen stanzas per day  

(one to one half सूक्त ) depending on the complexity. Our goal is to map

the physical image of the phenomena as expressed through the stanzas.  

We try to create a local vocabulary by applying the basic Paninian grammar

in reconstruction. It is an analytic study limited by our local knowledge of  

brain and neurology. . We do take the help of Sayana to get hints and use Yaska for new words. The naming and classification of objects points to

a much richer past of language in cultural history. Our scientific goal is to understand the delivery of sound through voice with the broad topic in

understanding the origin and production of speech.

Ours is an academic study. Please feel free to join us if you wish to be  

in the open-ended scienti journey. I wish to express my gratitude to many

in the list particularly to Professor Korada with whom I had many fruitful discussions.   

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
