Seminar Series Indic Studies  
Mahavidyas - The Feminine Universe of Divinity and Wisdom  
  
The group of Mahavidyas is a curious collection of fierce, independent Goddesses (Kali, Tara, Tripura Sundari, Bhuvneshwari, Dhumavati, Baglamukhi, Bhairavi, Chhinmasta, Matangi, Kamala) where one is worshipped in cremation grounds, another cuts off her head, and another is a cranky widow and a smokey swallower of the universe. These 10 Wisdom Goddesses represent a specific cosmic function, and challenge the predictable fantasies in this world.
