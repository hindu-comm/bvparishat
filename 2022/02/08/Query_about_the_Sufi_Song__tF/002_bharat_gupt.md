Briefly:

Kaul कौल in Persian means poetry/ vachanam. One who sings a kaul is called kawaalla.

The music he sings is called

Kawaalii.

  

It is called classical if done in

complicated ragas. Or if done in popular tunes it is folk.

Since 18th century a particular

ornamentation useful to loud singing with kawaalii taan and kawalli gamak in tala tappa makes the peculiar style called Kawali.

  

In the last thirty years American and European musicologists have renamed kawali into "Sufi music".

  

Singing poems about the character or charitra of Muhammad, Ali, Hussain, or

a Sufi saint such as Nizamuddin Aulia, is singing kaul.

  

Very early, this was done by Muslims in imitation of Hindus singing to their devatas.

  

Sunnis have usually regarded music as haram, so mostly the Shias have patronized music as devotional road or profession.

The musical genre was evolved in India for khankaas. Now it is touted as an Islamic contribution Pakistan.
