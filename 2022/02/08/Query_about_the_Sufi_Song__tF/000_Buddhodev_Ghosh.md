Can anyone answer that- can Sufi and Kawali be counted as the indigenous songs category?

If yes in which sub-category does it fall- Classical or the Folk?

Please clarify also if the answer is NO.

  

I have some of the articles about it but I am not getting the clearcut answer. So, please help.

  

Thanks and Stay Safe.
