First, it isदीर्घ not धीर्घ (omitting the visarga for simplicity).

  

Most Indo-Aryan languages, including Sanskrit do not differentiate long 'e' and short 'e', as also long 'o' and short 'o'. Hence these languages do not need to show the difference in writing. And so, the scripts do not show the difference. On the other hand, south Indian languages have these distinctions. Meanings of words can change if a short e or short o is substituted for their respective long versions.
Hence Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil maintain this distinction in their scripts.
