विद्वद्वर्याः, प्रणामाः

  

Pardon if this seems a weird question, but this has been one of my "always wanted to ask, but afraid to ask" questions.

  

Qn: In the written देवनागरी script, I am puzzled by the missingधीर्घ-s in some of the vowels. This is what I recall having learn and used - अ आ इ इ उ ऊ ऋ*ऋू*ए ऐ ओ अं अः. I am missing the धीर्घ-s for ए and ओ. In comparison, as an example, in ಕನ್ನಡ, I learnt and used ಅ ಆ ಇ ಈ ಉ ಊ ಋ ಋೂ ಎ ಏ ಐ ಒ ಓ... I am sure some of the other Indian scripts have these two धीर्घ-s.

  

My question is : How do I recognize if ए and ओ notated in a document is aह्रस्व or a धीर्घ? Assuming that I am not familiar with the words that I am reading in that document?

  

Thank you.
