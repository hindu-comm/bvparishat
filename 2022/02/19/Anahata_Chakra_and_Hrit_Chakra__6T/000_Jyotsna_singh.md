Respected Scholars!

Namaste!

  

I would like to understand the meaning of 'Beej-mantras' written on twelve petals of 'Anahata- Chakra' and I also want to know about the difference between hrit and Anahata chakra. Kindly suggest any authentic reference text(s) as well as an online source.

Thank you
