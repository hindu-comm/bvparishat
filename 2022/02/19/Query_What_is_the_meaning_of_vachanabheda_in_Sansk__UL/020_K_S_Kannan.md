The first word is of course Itaretara-dvandva, indicated by its *dvivacana*.

For Samāhāra-dvandva to have taken place, we need the second word to be *ekavacana*.

Only then can there be the break of symmetry, the obviating of *yathāsaṅkhya*.  

(The first commentary seems misleading).

This is my guess.
