I suspected it at first to be something akin to *vākya-bheda* of Mīmāṁsā.

But there was no scope for that, apparently.  

After I went through the commentary, there appeared some clarity.

*Vacana-bheda* could perhaps be translated as "Variation in the mode of expression".

  

And the expression

*na hyasati prayojane vacanabhedo yuktaḥ*

is so remarkable and powerful.  

It sets forth a beautiful norm of interpretation

(and surely can have multiple applications

\- as it is, or in some alternate modes applicable elsewhere

= *parito vyāpr̥ta*).

  

It also speaks volumes for the utter care of the Sūtrakāra

in his sense of the rare twinning (rather common though,  

in Sanskrit grammar in general) of precision and compaction : what a master-stroke that  

by a mere variation in the (sub-)pattern of compounding, not apparent at first sight though,  

economy has been achieved without sacrificing accuracy!

  

Brilliant minds - the Sūtrakāra as well as the Bhāṣyakāra!

  

Many Westerners have admired the high economy of words

that is in general a great genius of the Sanskrit language itself.

  

*mitaṁ ca sāraṁ ca vaco hi vāggmitā* !

So true!

  

Thank you for raising the query:

it helped explore something new.
