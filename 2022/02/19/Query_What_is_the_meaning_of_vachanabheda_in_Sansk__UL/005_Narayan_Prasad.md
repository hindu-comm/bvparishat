Purposely I included the auto-commentary calledशब्दमहार्णवन्यास (बृहन्न्यास) of Hemacandra, along with the auto-commentary calledतत्त्वप्रकाशिका (popularly known as बृहद्वृत्ति).

शब्दमहार्णवन्यास commentary makes the point clear.  

I consulted K V Abhyankar's Dictionary of Sanskrit grammar for the termवचनभेद. But there is no entry for it.

Regards

Narayan Prasad
