Thank you so much for the nice explanation.

  
\<\<Sorry for the inadvertence.>\>

  

For me there was no problem in understanding due to this inadvertence.

  

\<\<And sorry for being too algebraic.>\>

  

But this mathematical (algebraic) way of explanation was much better than what would have been in simply words.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
