Thank you for bringing up this topic of mode of expression for discussion.

What we are noticing is that the conomization happens right at the speech production level

that is when the sound stream is created from the neural stream. It appears as an optimization

problem because of the basic processing time in the brain. It is not that the brain is looking for

words to express, but it utters sounds that are later taken as cognitive translators. We have to  

unravel the internal neural grammar in constructing compounds.  

We are seeing such mightily in the Vedas. We are slow, it takes time to experiment.
