Sheer guess-work:

  

1\. The *sūtra* can be stated structurally as:  

"If a and b are followed by c and d,  

then the latter are replaced by e".

  

2\. Now, we have here two pairs of Dvandva words in the *sūtra*:  

\(i\) (a-and-b) is a Dvandva .

\(ii\) (c-and-d) is also a Dvandva .

  

3\. Now, Dvandva itself is of 2 types (sub-categories):  

\(A\) Samāhara, and (B) Itaretara.

  

4\. If the Sūtrakāra wanted one-is-to-one correspondence,

then he should have made both a-and-b and c-and-d as the same type of *dvandva*.

That is to say,  

either both could be Samāhara ,

or both could be Itaretara

(not one of this and the other of other) .

  

5\. But he has broken the symmetry.

He has made one a "A type of Dvandva" *,*

and the other the "B type of Dvandva*"* .

  

*6. vacana* is expression;

*vacana-bheda* is "a different type/way of expression".

There would have been no *vacana-bheda  
*

if both the compounds were of the subcategory.  

What did he achieve by this?

  

7\. Had both been of the same type,

*yathāsaṅkhya* would have been the most natural thing.

Which is to say, it would mean

"if a is followed by c", and

"if b is followed by d",

then this substitution takes place.

  

8\. But this will thwart  

"if a is followed by d", and

"if b is followed by c".

  

9\. By breaking the symmetry, he has made the substitutions more versatile.

Which is to say, the substitutions can take place

when a is followed by c or d, and again,

when b is followed by c or .

  

10\. Had there been *yathāsaṅkhya*,  

there would have been only 2 possibilities.

Now there can be 4.

  

11\. In the formulation of a sūtra,  

**rather than be prolix, be brief**  

\- is the metarule.

  

12\. Hence, though he has employed Dvandva only in both sets,

they are of different categories.

  

This is my understanding - arrived at by mere guesswork.

More knowledgeable people could perhaps offer a better explanation.
