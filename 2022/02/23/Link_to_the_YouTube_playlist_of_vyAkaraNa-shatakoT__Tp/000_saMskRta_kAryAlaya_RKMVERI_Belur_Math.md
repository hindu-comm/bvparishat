Respected Sir/Madam

Namaskars and greetings to you.

We are glad to share with you the link to the YouTube playlist of "Vyākaraṇa-śatakoṭiḥ" workshop videos.

You might remember that we had organised a unique International workshop*Vyākaraṇa-śatakoṭiḥ* in the *Pāṇini’s sūtra Arthavadadhātur-apratyayaḥ prātipadikam* (*Aṣṭādhyāyī*, 1.2.45), from 30 Dec 2021 to 13 Jan 2022.

Dr.Ganeshwar Nath Jha (Assistant Professor, HoD, Department of Vyakarana, Central Sanskrit University, Ekalavya Campus, Agartala, Tripura) well versed in Pāṇini’s grammar, and Indian logic explored, and excellently discussed 100 aspects of the*sūtra.*

Please find the link below to the video recordings of the workshop, the first of its kind organised by RKMVERI, Belur Math.
