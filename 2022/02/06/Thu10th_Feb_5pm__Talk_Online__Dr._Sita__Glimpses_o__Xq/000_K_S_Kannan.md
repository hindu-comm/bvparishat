ABSTRACT  

"Early Indian civilization was known for its scientific achievements in many fields and seekers of knowledge from all over the world came to India to learn and carried back with them the philosophical and scientific wisdom of India. While the splendor and beauty of Sanskrit produced beautiful poetry and the highest philosophical thoughts, its precision made it the best vehicle for the conveyance of scientific ideas. Thus one sees many sciences including mathematics, astronomy, metallurgy, medicine, shipbuilding, engineering, military science and veterinary science, all being expounded in Sanskrit.

  
Mathematics as everyone is aware has a long tradition in ancient and medieval India. The *Rg veda*, the earliest known text, mentions numbers in many places — *ekachame, tisracame, pancacame* says the well known *camaka* portion of *Sri Rudra*. It is thus evident that from the time of the Vedas the evolution of Mathematics is seen uninterrupted up to modern times.

  
This lecture traces the history of mathematics from Vedas to present times. Texts in Sanskrit and Tamil have been researched for this purpose .There are two Tamil texts on mathematics available with us. A few examples are taken from the text *Asthanakolakalam*."
