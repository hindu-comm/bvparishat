Dear Scholars,

    Namaste.

    In case of Panini Unadi-sutras, a very controversial sutra appears to beअदेस्त्रिनिच्च or अदेस्त्रिन् निच्च for the derivation of अत्री अत्रिर्वा ऋषिः. The explanation regarding the accent part is not satisfactory.

  

    Consider now the corresponding sutras in Haima grammar, in which there is no place for accent. The two sutras are 696 and 929. In the case of the sutra 929, the editor appears to be confused. In place of अत्रिः ऋषिः, the correct reading would be अत्री ऋषिः. Kindly correct me if I am wrong.
