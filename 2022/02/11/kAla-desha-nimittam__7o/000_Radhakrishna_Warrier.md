I have often come across the phrase "Kāla-Deśa-Nimittam" quoted as being mentioned in the ancient philosophical discourses as the time-space-causality constraint that impedes the realization of the Ultimate Reality.

  

In which ancient works is this term mentioned? What are the exact wordings? And what is the context?

  

Regards,
