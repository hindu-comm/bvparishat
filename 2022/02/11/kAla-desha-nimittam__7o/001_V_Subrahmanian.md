I found this expressionदेशकालनिमित्तानि used very extensively in Shankaracharya's Bhashyam. The purport is: Any action done by a jiva will bear fruit at a future date. For the karma phala to manifest these three - appropriate desa, kaala and there has to be a nimitta are essential. In simple terms, if I have to reap a past punya karma's fruit in the form of a sumptuous meal, it happens on a particular day, in a particular place and the nimittam being a relative hosts a grand lunch on his 60th birthday. Things like I should not be suffering from a bad belly, etc. are also taken care of. Unless all these three conditions come together, the karma phala will not be experienced by me. So, prakriti will arrange things in such a way that every jiva's karma phala, papa or punya, will manifest in the infrastructure consisting of the triad.
