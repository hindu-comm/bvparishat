**Title:**A Scholar-Traveller of the Twentieth Century: Halide Edib in the Indian Subcontinent

**Abstract:**

Halide Edib (1884-1964), an important figure in the history and politics of twentieth-century Turkey, was invited to tour the Indian subcontinent in 1935 and deliver Extension Lectures for the year at New Delhi’s prestigious Jamia Millia Islamia University. These lectures, focusing on Turkish history as a blueprint for India’s postcolonial future, were published by the Jamia Press with the title*Conflict of East and West in Turkey*(1935). The trip itself had a deep and abiding impact on Edib, inspiring her to write the travelogue*Inside India*(1937). This talk examines Edib’s visit to the subcontinent as continuing a tradition of peripatetic scholarship that had been in existence for centuries and argues that her status as a Muslim woman lends the tradition a renewed relevance in the early twentieth century. Identifying Edib as a scholar-traveller, it locates her within a continuum of figures identified as such within the field of intellectual history and explores how she both embodies and reconfigures fundamental theoretical and conceptual frameworks of the field in terms of her immediate reception context, as well as her legacy in recent research on pan-Asian intellectual networks.

**About the speaker:**

Sreejata Paul is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology (Bombay). She has been awarded a dual-badged Ph.D. degree by IIT Bombay and Monash University in 2021. Her research focuses on the intellectual lifeworlds, trajectories, and networks of Muslim women in the late colonial era.
