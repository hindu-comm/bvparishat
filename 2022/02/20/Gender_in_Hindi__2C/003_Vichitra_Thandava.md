I took the liberty of sending your note around and I got this back:

  

"The assignment of gender in Hindustani is not arbitrary. It is based on phonemes. There is pattern to it, thats why native speakers are easily able to assign gender to neologism."

  

"Give me a list of English words. And, after looking at them, I might to be able to make the rules explicit. Right now, the phoneme pattern is abstruse even to me."  

  

  

So Mr Warrier, please send a list iof words that you can come up with and let's see if my friend can sort out the rule. Will be helpful for all, unless there are more learned in this forum who can educate.
