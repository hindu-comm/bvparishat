Most words in Hindi are from Sanskrit and Prakrit. Over the centuries, words evolved from Prakrit to their modern Hindi form. Words came to Hindi from Sanskrit as tatsama and as tadbhava. How is gender assigned to all these words that have either evolved from Prakrit or have come from Sanskrit in the tatsama or tadbhava forms? Is the modern Hindi gender for a word same as in the original Sanskrit or Prakrit? If same, what happens to neuter gender words of Sanskrit and Prakrit, as Hindi does not have a neuter gender? (Gujarati and Marathi have neuter gender.)

How did Hindi gender get assigned to non-Indic loan words? For example, in the sentence “āp kī nazaroṃ ne samjhā pyār ke qābil mujhe (आप की नज़रों ने समझा प्यार के क़ाबिल मुझे)” the word nazar is used as feminine (hence the preposition used is “kī”) and qābil is treated as masculine (hence the preposition “ke”). These words are originally from Arabic and entered Hindi/Urdu through Persian. Arabic does not assign gender to words that denote genderless objects or concepts. Although Persian is an Indo-European language like Sanskrit and many of the present day north Indian languages, it (Persian) does not assign gender to words that denote genderless objects or concepts. (Persian, English, and Bengali are among a minority of Indo-European languages that do not assign gender to words for genderless objects or concepts.) So, the question is how did words of Arabic, Persian or Turkic origin get their gender in Hindi/Urdu?

Coming to modern times, how is gender assigned in Hindi to recent loan words from English? What is the gender of “kaṃpyūṭar”, the Hindi tatsama from English “computer”? And how did this gender get assigned to this word?
