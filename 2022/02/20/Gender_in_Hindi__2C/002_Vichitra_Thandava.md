I was taught in school that only 50% of Hindi words can be attributed to Sanskrit. That the other half comes from Persian, Arabic, Turkish, English....

  

Also, there is extensive evidence apparently that Urdu is also very much an Indian language like Hindi is and was not a Mughal camp language as is putatively understood.

  

As far as I can tell, no one in India has Hindi or Urdu as the mother tongue or native vernacular though they may put that on official forms.

  

But yes, gender in Hindi can be very confusing
