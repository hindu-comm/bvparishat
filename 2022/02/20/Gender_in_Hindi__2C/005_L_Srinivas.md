\> Coming to modern times, how is gender assigned in Hindi to recent loan words from English?  

  

This is a very good question. For example, 'गाडी' and 'बस' (i.e., bus) are feminine but 'ट्रैक्टर' (i.e., tractor) is masculine. Decades ago, I used to travel extensively in Punjab and Haryana - I never once heard a native speaker assign the wrong gender to these nouns!

  

There's some method to it but it's a mystery to me.
