The word "computer" is masculine in Hindi.

  

There are some common factors like comparative size, word ending, etc. which contribute to selecting the gender for a borrowed word. These factors may be overlapping and non-deterministic. Thus, the gender of a borrowed word initially varies from place to place and even person to person. For new borrowings, even a person may use different genders for the same word depending on the state of mind.

  

As an example, consider the word "[command line (interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)". For my mind, sometimes it can be a "line", and on other times, it can be an "interface". When it seems to be an "interface", then it is masculine for me. When it is a "line", it is feminine. The word "line" is feminine in my native place, probably because one of its meaning is "पङ्क्ति", which is feminine.

  

As the word becomes popular, one gender for that word becomes dominant over the other and becomes the standard.
