***About **Mānasollāsa*****

*****  
*****

The ***Mānasollāsa*** (also known as *Abhilaṣitārtha Cintāmaṇi*), is an early 12th-century Sanskrit text  
composed by the Karnataka king Kalyana Chalukya king Someshvara III.  

  

**It is an encyclopedic work** covering topics such as polity, governance, ethics, economics, astronomy, astrology,  
rhetoric, veterinary medicine, horticulture, perfumes, food, architecture, games, painting, poetry and music.  
The text is a valuable source of socio-cultural information on 11th- and 12th-century India.  
The encyclopedic treatise is structured as five sub-books with a cumulative total of **100 chapters**.  
It is notable for its extensive discussion of arts, particularly music and dance. It is also notable  
for including chapters on food recipes and festivals, many of which are a part of modern Indian culture.
