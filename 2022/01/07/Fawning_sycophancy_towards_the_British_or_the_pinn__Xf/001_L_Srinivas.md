For someone who does not know Bangla, it's rather hard to know one way or the other. But 1911 was the occasion of the Delhi Durbar so one can understand there was a deafening drumbeat of Raj sycophancy at that time.  

  

Tagore came from a family of Anglophiles, he himself arguably was an Anglophile. 'The Home and the World' aka 'Ghare Baire' contained a subtle anti Swadeshi message. In hindsight, espousal of internationalism during the high noon of Colonialism maybe questionable, to say the least. Even his poetry, to an Indian traditionalist, sounds like
English romantic poetry written in an Indian language.  

  

But all this proves nothing. Only Bangla scholars can unravel the mystery.
