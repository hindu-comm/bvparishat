Respected Scholars,

Namaste.

  

Greetings from the Centre for Avadhanam, a joint initiative of Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth and Indic Academy. We are immensely happy to announce the first ever Conference on Avadhanam, which will be held from 17th-19th of June, 2022. It is conceptualized as a Three Day International Conference on 'The Extempore Art of Avadhanam: Human Intelligence Expressed at its Best'.  

We hope to present interesting academic discussions and research work that would unearth hitherto untouched aspects of the magnificent art and science of Avadhanam. The sessions will be conducted both online and offline.  

  

**Call for Papers:**  

This is a wonderful opportunity for researchers as well as performers of this rare art-form to showcase its untapped potential - from both academic and performance perspectives. We invite papers in English and Sanskrit (to the mail ID [avad...@cvv.ac.in]()), and all selected papers will receive an incentive of Rs 1000/-, apart from Best Paper Awards (Rs 3000/-) in all the sub-themes.  

Scholars may send proposals for panels to the mail ID - [avad...@cvv.ac.in]()  

Ideas for collaborative projects are also welcome in this context.
