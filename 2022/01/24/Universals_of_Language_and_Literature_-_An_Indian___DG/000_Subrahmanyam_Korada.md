नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Invited to present a Paper at a Webinar by the Department of English , English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad , 20-21 Jan2022 . Some old friends like Vid Kpil Kapur also attended .

I herewith attach the Paper with a small change in Title .

  

Fifteen items that are universal , i e applicable to any Language and Literature to teach / analyze / interpret / translate are selected . There is chancefor elaboration .

Since it was a Dept of English I offered examples for English . One may try any Indianvernacular , viz Tamil, Telugu , Hindi etc. or foreign Language .

Although our ऋषिs kept Sanskritin mind , while compiling the सूत्रs , सिद्धान्तs and concepts , they are applicable to other Languages
and Literatures as well .

  

लौकिकानां हि साधूनाम्अर्थंवागनुवर्तते।

ऋषीणां पुनराद्यानां वाचमर्थो’नुधावति ॥ **उत्तररामचरितम्**  

  

It is rather my hope that the same may be prescribed as a Course at Master's level so that it would be useful for the students when they tackle a Language or Literature of their choice .

  

Feel free for clarifications and to suggest .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
