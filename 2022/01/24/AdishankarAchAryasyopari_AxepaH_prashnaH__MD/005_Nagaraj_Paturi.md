There were older threads on BVP discussing this topic.

  

Swami Vivekananda's views in this matter are very much in line with his views on many social matters. He was influenced by the 'liberal' views of his 19th century times.

  

Similarly Shankara Bhagavatpada'sviews discussed by Swami Vivekananda reflect the milieu of his times.

  

The book Brahma Sutras has many adhikaranas. This is one of them.

  

Swami Shivananda considers this adhikarana to be an interpolation. Swami Shivananda like Swami Vivekananda is from a modern background. While Swami Vivekananda who in many many aspects adored Shankara, and was in fact heavily influenced by him and for that matter became a 19th century ambassador to the western and westernized Indian world for Shankara, chose to distance himself from this miniscule part of Shankara's works, to keep his modern liberality intact, Swami Shivananda who too was a great follower of Shankara in manyways, chose to consider the adhikarana itself as an interpolation.

  

These examples show modern liberal 19th century /20th century ways of reception of a medieval commentarycoming from a Vedic varna-following
commentator.of an ancient work coming from a Vedic varna-following author.

  

What are the implications of these textual expressions for the actual reality ? What is the actual reality documented/reflected in oral and written resources ?

  

Shankara-advaita has a deep and wide following in terms of inward spiritual practices across individuals and groups from castes/jaatis/kula(mu)s including those which, in contemporary governmental parlance, are called scheduled castes. The thought , knowledge, techniques of practices are found documented/reflected in oral and written resources such as mystic Yogic and Bhakti folk songs and other texts.

  

( Dvaita, Visishtaadvaitaand other Vedanta traditions which are seen to have given a Shankara like commentary to the adhikarana in question too have deep and wide impact across individuals and groups castes/jaatis/kula(mu)s including those which, in contemporary governmental parlance, are called scheduled castes.The thought , knowledge, techniques of practices of these Vedantic traditions too are found documented/reflected in oral and written resources such as Bhakti folk songs and other texts)
