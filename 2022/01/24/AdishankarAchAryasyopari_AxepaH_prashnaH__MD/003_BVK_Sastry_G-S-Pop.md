Namaste



On \< strict orthodox times of Adi Shankara \> and \< Swamiji: Shankara's ..had no great liberality; his heart too seems to have been like that. Besides, he used to take great pride in his Brahmanism -- much like a southern Brahmin of the priest class, you may say. How he has defended in his commentary on the Vedanta - sutras that the non - brahmin castes will not attain to a supreme knowledge of Brahman! And what specious arguments! >



 Classic illustration of misconstruction of ‘Audience, Purpose, Time, Language’ –factors, playing to gallery is different from

‘Shaastra –Sutra – vyakhyana’. 



misconstruction of Audience – factor:

All three acharyas were addressing audience who are ‘ Advnaced Sadhakas and Yogi’s at ‘Bharath’ in ‘Prasthana-Traya’

framework. All three Acharyas in their commentary were not addressing ‘Religion audience –Social presenters’.



misconstruction of Purpose – factor: ‘Shaastra-Drushti’ is seen in Vyakhyanas. Social/Samaaja –drushit is seen in slokas.

 Same Acharya Shankara commenting on ‘apashudra adhikarana’ also said ‘ maneeshaa –panchakam’. 



misconstruction of Time –factor: The India of colonial period is not the same as ‘ Bharatam Punya-Bhoomih – Ramakshetra/ Parashurama kshetra’ of Acharyas.



misconstruction of Language –factor: The ‘rough- translation’ of Samskruth source works for social audience in English miscarries the true message and compassion of ‘Acharyas’. Errors in social practice are contextual and historical. The ‘practical culture of ‘religion’ community is not the same as ‘Sanatana Varna-Ashrama- Dharma Yoga practitioners’ as ‘Yoga –practitioners for Moksha, Brahma Jnana, SrimaNarayana preetyartham and ending with ‘Sri Krishnarpanam Astu’.





Is there a need for social scholarly debate on such disconnected issues carrying errors of construction and translation, for 

Defending or discrediting or whitewashing ? as a social debate ?

How is this going to heighten the stature of either Acharyas or Swamy ji’s ?
