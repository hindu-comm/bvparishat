Namaste,

  

From where Tripathiji started this discussion, the text is not the directand utmost view of Swamiji. Śiṣya (Śaraccandra Cakravartī) wrote down the talks of Swamiji with him. Meetings were not meant to establish specificobjectives, though very much enthusiastic according to the bold personality of Swamiji.

  

Without any doubt, there are works like --- books of 4 Yogas (he read theproofs), his letters, his self written 4 Bengali readers, and his lectures (especially "From Colombo to Almora"). These are the most authentic source of Swamiji's ideas.

  

If we took all utterings of him belonging to the contextual text as these are, there would be so much conflict. Such asSmṛtis like Manu, etc., most of the Purāṇas and many of the Mahābhārata scriptures are of that day. Lord Buddha was before these all (মন্বাদি সংহিতা, পুরাণসকলের অধিকাংশ এবং মহাভারতের অনেকটাও সেদিনকার শাস্ত্র। ভগবান্ বুদ্ধ তার ঢের আগে). I could not find this part in English. However, the conflict may arise in a quest of understanding the purposeof saying such. Further, this is a request that this contextual book is good to go with some preciousmemories of Sharat-babu (śiṣya) and a friendly and conversational Swamiji. Of course,this book does not fulfil the demand for an intellectual appetite.

  

Best regards,

Abirlal Gangopadhyay
