Namaskar Vidwans,

There is a story about Sri Krishna winning the hand of Niladevi, also known as Nappinnai in Tamizh by taming 7 bulls simultaneously, which was the condition put by her father.

  

I would like to know, which Purana/other works mentions this story.
Also, does this event happen after Krishna went to Mathura or while he was still in Vrindavan?

  

Pranaams

Aditya
