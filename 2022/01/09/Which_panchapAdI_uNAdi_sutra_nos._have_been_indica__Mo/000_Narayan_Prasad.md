Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

   This has reference to theदशपादी उणादिवृत्ति (1943) edited by Pt. Yudhisthir Mimansak.

In this उणादिवृत्ति, he has quoted the parallel sutra no. from theपञ्चपादी उणादिवृत्ति. But it is not clear which edition of the पञ्चपादी उणादिवृत्ति he has used to indicate the parallel sutra. All the editions of पञ्चपादी उणादिवृत्ति have different sutra numbers.

    Regards

    Narayan Prasad
