Dear Scholars,

   Namaste.

   I prepared a concordance (in excel) of दशपादी उणादि and
पञ्चपादी उणादि sutras as given by Pt Yudhisthir Mimansak.

   When I sorted out the concordance in the reverse way, i.e. taking the पञ्चपादी उणादि as the first and दशपादी उणादि as the second, I found that he has given parallel sutras for the पञ्चपादी उणादि for the five paadas as follows:

   146 sutras for the 1st paada;

   125 sutras for the 2nd paada;

   155 sutras for the 3rd paada;

   243 sutras for the 4th paada;

    81 sutras for the 5th paada.

   

So it is clear that he has used theपञ्चपादी उणादिसूत्रवृत्ति ofश्वेतवनवासिन्.
