I had a question related to the chapter that tells the story of Shantanu and Ganga.

When Shantanu revisits the forest many years after Ganga leaves with her 8th son, and finds his son but is not sure. He prays to Ganga to invoke her

Apparently there is a Stuti or stotram he chants to invoke Ganga, wanted to know what it is please. ![üôè](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/44a_-FLO2kvxoR7uwxRsG4NGXlx6lqjfzs42A-_6oSfMBbgn8rZUCgk_Zq21c-GctXzo7VTwHL0LLbwb1G0kz11rZF3DSMMYrut4FP-s5MWsgg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v9/t1f/2/16/1f64f.png)
