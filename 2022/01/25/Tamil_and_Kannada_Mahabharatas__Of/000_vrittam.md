Dear friends,

I am looking for English or Hindi translations of Peruntevanar's Mahabharata, as well as the first chapter of the Adiparva, and the gambling episode as described in the Mahabharatas of Villiputtur (Tamil) and Pampa (Kannada).

I will greatly appreciate help in this matter.

Thank you,

Sanjay
