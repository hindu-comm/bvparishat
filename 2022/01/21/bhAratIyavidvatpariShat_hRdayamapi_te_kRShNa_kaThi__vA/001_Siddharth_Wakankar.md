Excellent concluding verses,keeping the same tone.

  

Hearty congrats for this novel type of poetry.

  

I have come across some rare Sanskrit works by great grammarians denouncing the study of Vyakarana,with the help of their grammatical acumen .

  

Best of luck for further poetic compositions like this.
