It has been known for some time that Brahmi lipi has been found in Sri Lanka from early 4th Cent BCE ( the original claim seems to have been even older )

This is good. In academic publications there must be focus only on analytical rebuttal - but in less formal forums, it must be that we tell the truth and point out the mendacity more directly.

This is needed so that many Indians get out of the hangover of being needlessly obsequious to these colonialist forces.
