Glad to read that you found it useful :) Thank you for letting me know.

Interesting to know about your path to this point. Pointers to those specific lectures, if accessible online, or if it can be shared in some form, wouldbe welcome but understand if it can't be done for whateverreason.

  

Pre-250 BCE, pre-500 BCE evidence of writing from the Indian subcontinent will be, imho, terribly inconvenient evidence (to put it mildly) for some grand theories about the global history of writing (and therefore, some notions of 'history'). Amongst others, Bhagwan Singh ji's arguments forwhat he sees as '*Evidence of writing inṚ**gveda*' (pp. 396-400), in his 1995 tome*[The Vedic Harappans](https://www.amazon.in/Vedic-Harappans-Bhagwan-Singh/dp/8186471049),* deserves, imho, at the very least, at least an academic engagement. In'*Evidence of writing inṚ**gveda*' (pp. 396-400),he has classified his evidence in the above-mentioned section as *Circumstantial Evidence*, *Implied Evidence* and *Decisive Evidence*. Instead, one gets to see what Dr. Fosse has written (see<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/kKxASUdOir4/m/BxFd0dJWBAAJ>).

Thank you for pointing me to this, S. It so happens that I have actually read it but I can imagine at least a couple of reasons why you shared the same.

  

Unfortunately, {or at least I see it that way for now (until why anyone can show me why it should be otherwise)}, Bronkhorst'sviews on the epoch ofYāska*Nirukta*has, as I have shown in [Table 1 of my paper](http://t.ly/VL8H), has already been cited by scholars like Dr. Vissigali.

  

[Dr. Bronkhorst'sviews pertaining to *Karma*](https://www.amazon.in/Karma-Dimensions-Spirituality-Johannes-Bronkhorst/dp/0824835913)have, likewise, found space in Adamson and Ganeri's[Classical Indian Philosophy: A history of philosophy without any gaps, Volume 5](https://www.amazon.in/Classical-Indian-Philosophy-history-philosophy/dp/0198851766).['Karma in and after Greater Magadha' and 'Karma in Brahmanism': An Indic analysis and response](http://academia.edu/53471697/Karma_in_and_after_Greater_Magadha_and_Karma_in_Brahmanism_An_Indic_analysis_and_response)(2021), I have analyzed some of Dr. Bronkhorst'sviews pertaining to the origins of Karma theory and responded to the same.

  

[Origins of Dhyāna and a survey of its occurrences in the Upaniṣad-s: an analysis in 2021](https://www.academia.edu/63931350/Origins_of_Dhy%C4%81na_and_a_survey_of_its_occurrences_in_the_Upani%E1%B9%A3ad_s_an_analysis_in_2021)might make for some complementary reading as it tackles, amongst views from other books, views from Dr. Bronkhorst's book*[The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India](https://www.amazon.in/Two-Traditions-Meditation-Ancient-India/dp/8120816439/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2RZNYR3071E2K&keywords=ancient+meditation+bronkhorst&qid=1641266745&s=books&sprefix=ancient+meditation+bronkhors%2Cstripbooks%2C357&sr=1-1)*.

  

In all the papers above, an attempt has been made to stay wholly clear of ad-hominems and simply engage analytically and critically with (amongst others) Dr. Bronkhorst'sviews.
