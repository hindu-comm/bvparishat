Namaste सुब्रह्मण्य ji,

  

Thank you very much for this post.

  

Given your line of inquiry, a paper I posted in BVP on Aug 3, 2020 ([Reading Yāska's Nirukta in 2020: jottings of consequence to the Global history of astronomy, Yāska's chronological epoch and the Indic history of writing and knowledge systems](https://www.academia.edu/43694407/Reading_Y%C4%81skas_Nirukta_in_2020_jottings_of_consequence_to_the_Global_history_of_astronomy_Y%C4%81skas_chronological_epoch_and_the_Indic_history_of_writing_and_knowledge_systems)),might be of interest to you if you have not seen it already. Why do I say so?

1.  On pp. 10-19 of that paper, you will find an engagement with various
    positions on the chronological epoch of आचार्य यास्क's निरुक्त 2.  *'Table 1: Mapping some post-1976 published positions to the ten
    groups listed above*'in pp. 12-15 might perhaps be of particular
    interest 3.  On pp. 15-19, you will find an engagement with, and a critical
    analysis of, the reasons given by Dr. Bronkhorst to revise downwards
    the chronological epoch of यास्क's निरुक्त. Insofar as I had seen
    until then (early 2020 that is), Dr. Bronkhorst's reasons for the
    downward revision, which has been cited subsequently by scholars
    like Visigalli, had not been critically engaged with and published 4.  On p. 20, I had, as you have done in your post, invoked *निरुक्तम्
    1.20.*
