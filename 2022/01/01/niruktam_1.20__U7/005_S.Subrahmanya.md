Raghavendra mahodaya,

  

upakrutah asmi \|

The reference from the Ramayana where grantha is not a generic word for shaastram is useful.

Also, in the nirukta statement, the word upadesha comes first, then upadeshaaya glaayantah ... grantham samaamnaasiShuh ...

so atleast my thinking is that we should not just genericize grantha as a shaastram (using amarakosha). Also, amarakosha is after all not a

list of synonyms.

  

regards

S.
