Dear Megh,

  

Thank you!. Your paper is extremely useful.

  

1\) I got the info about "grantha" referring to writing from the work of BB.Chaubey (lectures on manuscriptology) Indeed, the sentence taken as a whole does seem to indicate grantha

  refers to written documents, and not just a generic term for shaastra.

  

2\) Also, Thanks for looking into the writings of Bronkhorst. His ( i.e. Bronkhorst's ) are are at another level when it comes to imagination.

  He tells us that the original Buddhists were fools and he is the modern savior. I think the field of Indology has the greatest remaining collection of 19th century intellectual

  luddites even in the 21st century. please see this:
