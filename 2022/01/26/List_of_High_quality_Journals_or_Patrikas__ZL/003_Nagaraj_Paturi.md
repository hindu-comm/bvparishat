As Sri Suresh mentioned, this is a euphemism.

  

In Telugu, in the case of rice and other food grains and auspices things like kumkum, euphemism for 'exhausted' is 'full' or 'became/filled full'

  

'Poornam'in Sanskrit is considered to be standing for zero.

  

Pujyam for zero /s'unyamseems to be on the same lines.
