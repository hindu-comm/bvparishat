Very interesting observation, Sir. Though I am familiar with this usage, never thought about it.

  

Initially when Buddhism was rampant, SUnya must have been pUjya and then after Buddhism waned, this usage must have remained. Just like we (Telugu speakers) still start practice of writing with ओं नमः शिनायः, सिद्धं नमः on the day of aksharAbhyAsa,

Senani
