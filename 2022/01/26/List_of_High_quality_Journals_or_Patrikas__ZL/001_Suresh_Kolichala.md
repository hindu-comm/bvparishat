In the South Indian languages (including Marathi), the wordपूज्य(pūjya) is used to mean zero, nothingness. Is there any evidence of such usage in Sanskrit texts?

  

I notice that Marathi dictionaries also give a similar meaning:  

  

पूज्य**pūjya**—न. १ शून्य; टिंब.'विद्येच्या नांवानें पूज्य.' \[सं.\]

(Date, Yasavanta Ramakrshna. Maharashtra śabdakosa)

  

My question is whether such usage is limited only to the South Indian languages or is it found in other languages too. It would be interesting if there are Sanskrit, Prakrit or Pali texts with such usage.

  

Thanks,

Suresh.
