The word acca kannada is similar to the word acca tenugu well established as a grammatical term in Telugu literary discourse.

  

ācchika is an established grammatical term in traditional grammars of classical Telugu.

ācchika is derived from acchā , a word used in older grammars.  

This group of Telugu words includes dēśya and tadbhava words .

In the 18th and the 19th centuries, there was almost a 'movement ' of writingacca tenugu kavyas , probably as part of demonstrating /exhibitioning poetry composition skill with difficult restrictions such as nirōśṭhya etc.

There emerged Amara kosha style synonyms listing verse dictionaries foracca tenugu vocabulary during the same period.

But an interesting fact is that these kavyas did not gain the popularity that the kavyas that freely included tatsama words.

This must have to do withwhat they call the 'genius of language'. Each language has its own specific nature.

I think Kannada's 'genius of language' is similar to that of Telugu.
