Dear All

  

This reminds me of the advocacy of some native English speakers for pure English i.e, English that is free of Greek and Latin!. It turns out that it is indeed possible to speak such English. All of this i had read in an article in which there were examples of passages (i believe in scientific context no less!) written in pure English. I will try to find it again. Meanwhile if some knows this may I request to share. I found it quite interesting.

  

regards
