Respected Sri Roy ji,

  

सङ्ख्यानां वामतो गतिः, so शराग्नि is 35 indeed, and it is an example to show that अग्नि represents 5 and शर represents 3 ( The words representing the numbers seem to be chosen as per their famous counts - पञ्चाग्नयः, त्रिशराः etc)

  

But here अद्र्यग्नि is used when the intended number is 57, instead of using अग्न्यद्रि, which is what I don't understand.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
