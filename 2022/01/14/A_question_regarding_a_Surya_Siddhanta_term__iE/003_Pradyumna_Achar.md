Respected Sri Roy ji,

  

I apologize. I was not paying proper attention.

  

Yes, as you said, शराग्नि is 35. So, शर represents 5 and अग्नि represents 3.

  

Also, for the apparent discrepancy that I mentioned, the contention is whether 53 should be written as अग्निशर as given or as शराग्नि , and with this, my doubt is clarified.

  

As to why so, I believe it may be because of गार्हपत्य, आहवनीय, and दक्षिणाग्नि being the 3 अग्नयः and मन्मथबाणाः being the 5 शराः .

  

Thank you very much.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
