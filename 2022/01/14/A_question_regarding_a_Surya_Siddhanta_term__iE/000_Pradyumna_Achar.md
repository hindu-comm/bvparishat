Respected list members,

  

In Madhyamadhikara Shloka 47 of Surya Siddhanta, this term is present:

खचतुष्कयमाद्र्यग्निशररन्ध्रनिशाकराः

  

Based on the calculations in that context, this value comes to1953720000.

  

But based on the literal word meaning, it should appears that it should have been 1935720000. (खचतुष्काः - 0000, यम - 2, अद्रि - 7, अग्नि - 5, शर - 3, रन्ध्र - 9, निशाकरः - 1)

  

Request you to kindly enlighten me on this apparent discrepancy.

  

Thank you.

Regards

Pradyumna
