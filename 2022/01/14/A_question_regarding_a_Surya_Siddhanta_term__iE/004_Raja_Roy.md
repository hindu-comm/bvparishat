Dear Pradyumna ji,

I was also confused after your lastemail. The use of words for numbers is obvious in some cases, like sky synonyms for zero, Vedas for four and rasa for six. It will be good to have a compilation of words used to denote numbers. Agni is represented as of three types in Vedic literature as you mentioned, so that may be the basis for it being used for number 3. I would love to know the five types of Shara.

Regards,

Raja
