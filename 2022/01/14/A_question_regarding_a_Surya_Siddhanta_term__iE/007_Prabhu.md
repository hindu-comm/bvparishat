Shri Roy-ji

I am not sure in what way the two lists are equivalent, if ever...

The first one is a list (kAmasya pan\~chabANAH) of mental/emotional states

and the other is the list (pan\~chabANAsya sAyakAH) of "flowers", I imagine the 5 arrows are made up of.

sAyaka : Arrow  

  

May be someone on this list could correct/clarify...

  

Regards

Prabhu
