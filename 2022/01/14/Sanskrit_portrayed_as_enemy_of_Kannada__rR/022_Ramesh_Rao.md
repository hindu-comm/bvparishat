Here is something that I received backchannel, and I am posting it verbatim. None of the links below and the concerns expressed are mine, but I thought I will forward this for the sake of ensuring full discussion about the matter.

  

Regards,

I see Hindi and Urdu in this link but not any regional languages. Why?
Very few states may have Urdu as majority speaking language. Do all regional states follow this NCERT curriculum ?

Sanskrit is taught here via Hindi but not via regional languages. Will states teach Sanskrit via regional languages?

Devanaagari Lipi Parishad prefers a single Devanaagari script for all Indian languages to slowly eliminate vernacular scripts the way they did with Maharashtra's MODI script. Will non-Devanaagari scripted languages adopt Devanaagari script? Most Westerners get Sanskrit knowledge in English via translation and transliteration but Indians are not allowed to learn Sanskrit the same way in vernacular languages.Why not make the same efforts in teaching mother language as you do for Sanskrit? How modern Sanskrit is going to be better than Vedic Sanskrit in providing knowledge? Does the government spend an equal amount of money on the promotion of all state languages.

Also, why can't we have a pronunciation key for Indian English based on Indic scripts /Romanaagari instead of IPA?

Will Hindi propagators allow this?
