Namaste  

  

Caste based politics is the reality in Karnataka. The idea of all Hindus to have unity is completely missing. Some years ago Lingayat leaders asked followers to not call themselves Hindus. For them Caste is important and not religion. Elections are won or lostbecause of caste. Anti brahmin sentiments are strong. Ill informed leaders keep associating Sanskrit with Brahmins only. Unfortunate situation.
