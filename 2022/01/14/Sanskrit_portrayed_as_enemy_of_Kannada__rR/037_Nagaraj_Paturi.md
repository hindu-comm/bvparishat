This 1982 article has important observations useful for understanding the Sanskrit-Kannada competition, the same aspects that I mentioned in the Sanskrit-Telugu competition, liberal evaluation, easy marks in Sanskrit :

  

> 
> > **Old Dispute**: The present agitation for Kannada has its roots in a > controversy that began seven years ago during the chief ministership > of Devraj Urs. Urs had issued an order demoting Sanskrit from its > first language status and making Kannada compulsory for all students. > Many students had preferred to offer Sanskrit as a first language in > high school exams because Sanskrit was taught only in high schools. > Hence its syllabus was elementary and it was possible to score higher > marks in Sanskrit than in other languages. >

While this is the actual reason and Sri Gundu rao thoughtthat it was populist to reviveSanskrit as a first language that gives easy marks, his being Brahmin was used by his political opponents :  

  

> 
> > When Rao assumed office he restored Sanskrit as a first language which > gave his opponents the chance to accuse him of "Brahmanical bias". The > charge drew blood as Rao is the state's first Brahmin chief minister. >
