This sentence, selected from the pasted portion of NEP text, seems to be the saving grace of NEP,

which must have been missed while the State Govt. passed the Order:

  

Sanskrit will be mainstreamed with strong offerings in school  

- including as one of the language options in the three-language formula -  

*as well as in higher education.*

  

It is surely better if legal luminaries, rather than commoners (like me),  

look into it and decide the Policy's provisions and limits,  

and possible, useful, interpretations.
