Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

I have sent the link to today's *Viswavani* newspaper.

Actually, there is some stuff in the opening page also.

Some material appeared in yesterday's issue too of the same paper.

The Kannada newspaper is available online *free*.

It should be easy to check for anybody.  

  

(I guess Dr. Janardana Hegde may be able to procure  

the quick appreciative response sent by Prof. Baraguru Ramachandrappa to the CM.

One can only admire the alacrity with which the Leftist camp responds).  

  

(In one of his enlightening lectures, BR asserted that India got a sense of unity

*only subsequent to* the introduction of the railways and the postal dept.  

by the British.)

  

Accusations against SB and VL made news in the front page, and continued in an inner page

yesterday also - for their having gone to Court. Unfortunately, Sanskritists are yet to get to know the full facts.

Are we to always hear distorted news from the scaremongering enemy camp first?

  

I am not sure whether SB and VL have indeed given their response,

not published by the Press as yet, or what it is. But once a negative image

gathers momentum, it may be difficult to gain public sympathy

\- which is also needed in addition to succour from Courts of Law.

  

It is a national policy issue, and the ailment may easily spread to other states too.
