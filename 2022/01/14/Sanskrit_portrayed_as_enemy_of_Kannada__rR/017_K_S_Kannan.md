Please correct me if I am wrong.

  

The NEP does not make English compulsory.

And that is the beauty of this sabotage of Sanskrit,

which cannot even be suspected or seen through.

  

People are bound to opt for English, completely voluntarily.

And the framers of NEP knew this very well.

It does not require a genius to figure it out.  

After all, today's job market sets a high premium on good articulation in English.

  

If there is no provision for three languages in some fashion or the other,

Sanskrit can in no wise survive - being unable to compete with

either the regional language, or, much less, English.

  

The easy way to kill Sanskrit is to pit it against the regional language;

the easier way to kill it is to pit it against English. NEP chose the second one.  

  

Earlier, those who came from other States, would take up Sanskrit or Hindi,

if they could not handle the regional language with ease.

  

Now, NEP is in effect strengthening raw regionalism with an official stamp,

the stamp of the Central Government - the very Government that ought to  

ensure that national integration is never lost sight of, and is, on the other hand,  

continually strengthened, though ensuring all the same that

the growth of regional languages is in no manner hurt.

It requires no great brilliance to know that Sanskrit is one of the  

strongest cementing bonds for national integration.  

  

There could be no greater tool for Breaking India forces than destroying Sanskrit -  

as has been done now - ie. covertly, not overtly.

Without insisting on the removal of Sanskrit formally,

it is as though the NEP has accomplished it, serving thereby  

a veritable death warrant for Sanskrit, by slow poisoning apparently.

  

Why "apparently" ? : The Karnataka Govt. is in a supreme hurry

to implement NEP; to be the first among all States to make a show of

"We are the FIRST (whatever be the consequences)"! - to put an end to Sanskrit.  

  

Elections are not too far off in Karnataka; and should a different government come

(God forbid!), it will seal the fate of Sanskrit with even severer blows!
