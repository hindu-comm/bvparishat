Apparently, Karnataka is the only state outside of UP and Bihar where Brahmins are a political constituency with 5% of the population. Even Gavaskar, Tendulkar, Kumble, Bhimsen Joshi, Guru Dutt, and like are from the state even if nominally based elsewhere. Goa too would have belonged in the state minus the Portuguese influence, in a manner of Pondicherry that would have belonged in Tamil Nadu without thr French effect.

  

But Nehru too called himself a Brahmin, complete with the prefix Pandit. Does not Rahul Gandhi claim to be one too?

  

As someone pointed out, there are four different demographics and geographies in Karnataka - one of the states in India with the least population density.
