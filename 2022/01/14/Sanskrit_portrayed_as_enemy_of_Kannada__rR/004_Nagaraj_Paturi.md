Crux of the whole article is this paragraph. The writer of this article is responding to the decision of the Karnataka government to establish a Sanskrit University in Magadi Taluk<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magadi>. of Karnataka.

  

He mentions allocation of 350 crores for the purpose of founding the university. He is saying that the only university of 6.5 crore Kanndigas(which ?) is not getting 2 crores per annum grant.

  

The comparison between a founding grant and an annual maintenance grant itself is mischievous.

  

Attempt here is clearly to stall the founding of a new Sanskrit University.
