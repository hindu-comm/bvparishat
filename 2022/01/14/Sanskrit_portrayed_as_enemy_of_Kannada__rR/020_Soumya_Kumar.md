Today's Prajavani carries a news article which says that Kannada "activists" will start a Twitter abhiyana from today against giving grants to Samskrita University in Karnataka.

In their haste to implement NEP 2020 in Karnataka, Kannada was made compulsory for all UG degree students - whether they prefer it or not and not considering its effect on non-Karnataka students. Samskrita is being targeted because few Samskrita teachers and lovers of Samskrita went to the court of law questioning this decision. Furthermore, Samskrita is conflated with oppression by some weird logic and provides an easy and soft target.

Threat to Kannada is not from Samskrita is something people do not want to accept. Kannada TV channels - both news and entertainment, movies and conversation is liberally peppered with English words even when popular Kannada words are available. Kanglish is more a norm than an exception even among rural people. One of my colleagues from the Kannada department was remarking that an ordinary village woman uses at least 25-30 English words within the span of two and half hours in the morning. However, as Prof Kannan observed in an earlier post, English is considered as a food-providing language and this makes things complicated.

  

As a teacher in college, I do wish to note few positive points that can be easily followed by Samskrita teachers which can help the cause of Samskrita:

  

1\. As per NEP 2020, students can study at least 4 different languages in the first four semesters of their UG course (I am assuming that Kannada has to be studied mandatorily for all the four semesters). There is no bar on changing one's language paper from one semester to another. This fact needs wide dissemination among both students and teachers.

  

2\. Samskrita language papers should focus on language rather than literature. The NEP subject committee on Samskrita assumes that students have prior knowledge of Samskrita when they enter a first year degree course like BA, BCom etc. Unfortunately it is not so and most of the students have to be coaxed to take Samskrita by their teachers. This is not a comment on Samskrita teachers but on the sad state of affairs wrt all languages. How can a totally new student to Samskrita cope with a paper like Classical poetry in their first semester? Language as a medium of communication should get equal importance if not more than language as an appreciation of aesthetics.

  

Link for Samskrita syllabus under NEP is given:<https://kshec.karnataka.gov.in/storage/pdf-files/Subjects/Samskrit.pdf>

  

When students are not able to communicate properly in Kannada, their mother tongue, how can we expect them to have proficiency in other languages? Fact is, a very high percentage of students fail the English language paper too, which is just brushed under the carpet.

As a teacher at both UG and PG level, I have seen many English major and English MA students writing their Open Elective papers in Kannada!

  

So this argument on Samskrita as enemy of Kannada is nothing but a bogey. Languages are facing a crisis and by extension other subjects also as we fail to communicate properly in both oral and written forms. This crisis is all the more severe for social sciences and humanities. Added to that only few people communicate in local languages and this adds to prejudice, but this is a matter which merits different thread.

  

with regards
