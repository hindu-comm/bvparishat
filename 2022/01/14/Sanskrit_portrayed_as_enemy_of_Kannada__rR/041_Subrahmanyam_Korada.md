नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

There had been a long drawn war between Junior Lecturers of Sanskrit and Telugu . Many students were respecting Sanskrit because they can answer in English and can score 90% . So without even knowing Ramasabda
one can get a high score which will be promising at a higher level . Students of French, Arabic , Urdu etc have to answer in the respectivelanguage .As a result Telugu

was relegated to the back seat . Telugu lovers considered Sanskrit as an enemy of Telugu . Initially it was at the political level .

I was asked to chair the Intermediate Sanskrit Syllabus Committee by the Board and look into the matter . I could not prevent some Sanskrit Lecturers from going to the High Court . In the counter

I submitted that the Courtcannot tackle the academic issue of
prescribing syllabus ( whether lines like **रम्भोरु** कच्चिन् मनसो रुचिस्ते -- रघु - 6 can be there or not - it is just for litigation ) and the committee is sieged of the matter . The case was dismissed..

Answering Sanskrit paper in English is अन्याय्य - no one can / should defend . I / we will be above राग and द्वेष - why should anybody
preach to us ? I addressed groups of JLs also and convinced them.

Finally it wasrecommended that 60% of thepaper has to be answered in Sanskrit medium and the rest would consist of matching , translation both sides etc . .

  

Junior Lecturers also haveto improve theirstandards . They should learn Samskrtam rather than Sanskrit . This applies at higherlevels also . How many students of MA can draft theirTheses

in Samskrtam?

  

We should strive to protect such a great language and train ournext generation .
