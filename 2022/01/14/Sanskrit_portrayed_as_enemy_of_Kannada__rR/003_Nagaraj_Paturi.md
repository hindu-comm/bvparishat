Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

Can you please share more details with regard to

  

the reasoning /argument of those who are saying that Samskrita Bharati and / or Vyoma Labs are blocking Kannada ?

  

the specific post NEP 2020 policy of CM Yedyurappa that the leftist is thanking him for ?

  

It is agreed by even those called Sanskrit toxic and proclaimed Death of Sanskrit that Sanskrit gives unity to India , Bhaarat.

  

So those who want to break this unity have always been opposing Sanskrit and have been showing Sanskrit as the enemy of regional languages of Bhaarat for more than a century. This is more in south India than in the other parts of Bhaarat.

  

This has more impact in Tamil Nadu than in other south Indian states .
