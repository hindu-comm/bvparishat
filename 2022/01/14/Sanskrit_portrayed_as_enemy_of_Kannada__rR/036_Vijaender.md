Sanskrit most likely did not have a script originally. It took on whatever script it was penned down from time to time.

  

However the fact of the matter is, nearly all Indian languages are based on the Brahmi script today, a fact that often surprises both Hindi and Tamil scholars alike when pointed out. It is easy to see however, when you lay out the letters side by side.

  

Kannada, Telegu, Oriya, Burmese, Thai, Cambodian, and Sinhalese look similar and a little different from other Indic but are also based on Brahmi.

  

Therefore, it is easy to make a case for learning and writing Sanskrit in localized scripts. In fact, on a recent trip to Orrisa, I found both Bhagavat Gita and Bhagavatam being read out in the Odia script.
