I guess we are still missing the central issue.

  

If NEP allows study of but two languages,

one of the two compulsorily being the regional language,

all students are bound to take English as the other language,

and certainly not Sanskrit.  

  

In a way, the fight is pushed to be between English and Sanskrit,

and the son/daughter of even the most orthodox Brahmin, or (perhaps) top BJP functionary,

would not choose Sanskrit *in lieu of English.*

  

Even in the past, the stipulation was

"any two languages, one of them being Indian",

with English shown as an Indian language in the schedule.

  

Members here may not be aware, that

thousands, perhaps lakhs, perhaps crores of parents,

have given a declaration - that their mother-tongue is English,

or else, they cannot admit their ward to an English-medium school!

  

Today, Sanskrit can put up no fight with English.

So the best way to kill it is to pit the two against each other.

  

For survival, people need English.

For survival, Sanskrit needs accommodation.  

  

Rather than allow Sanskrit to coexist with the regional language,

a devious way has been devised to allow it to die a quick and "natural" death.

At the present rate, can Sanskrit ever dream of usurping the place of English?
