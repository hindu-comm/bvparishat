Yes, as Prof. Kannan rightly asked, what is the aspect, in this order, that is worrying the petitioners, the Sanskrit organizations ?

  

My observation in the Telugu states is that there is a tussle among language teachers at+2 and undergraduate levels to attract more students to their own teaching language.

  

All this started with a ridiculously, obnoxiously and Sanskrit-harmingly liberal evaluation of Sanskrit students in the examinations by the Sanskrit teachers. This made a balance-tiltingly huge exodus of students to Sanskrit and reducing the takers for the local language of the state Telugu itself to an abysmal level.

  

The Telugu teachers associations passed resolutions to be more liberal in their evaluation.

  

French is one such option chosen for liberal evaluation.

  

But it is not to the extent of threatening Telugu.

  

If Telugu is made compulsory, all the Sanskrit teachers at the+2 and UG levels may feel threatened.

  

Sanskrit teachers at+2 and UG levels, understandable.

  

But why Sanskrit organizations ?
