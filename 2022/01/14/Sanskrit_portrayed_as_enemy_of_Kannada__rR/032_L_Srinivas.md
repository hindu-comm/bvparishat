Re NCERT, it started producing curriculum books in a big way starting 1975 under the then minister of education S Nurul Hasan whose wikipedia bio describes him as a 'secularist with an abiding faith in leftism'. I myself had NCERT books for my Sanskrit curriculum (via Hindi) prior to 1970, the textbook committee having been headed by the late Prof V Raghavan, then HOD Sanskrit, U of Madras. Most lessons were extracts from classical prose and poetry. But there were several lessons we had bearing on contemporary matters which V Raghavan himself wrote for our books, e.g., Nehru's will (जवाहरलालस्येच्छापत्रम्). These mostly reflected the dominant worldview prevailing then among the Indian professional classes ('intelligentsia').  

  

Since education is a state subject, there may not have been an attempt by NCERT to produce books in regional languages. That was something the curriculum committees in the states took care of.  

  

I'm not sure there is general recognition in India that there are parallels between Israel and India in the matter of national or official language, no matter how many times Sanskrit enthusiasts would make that argument.  

  

It is hard to understand the issue 'Kannada vs Sanskrit', as is being played out today, for non Kannadigas. That said, as a student in a science institution, I was an eyewitness to the Gokak agitation during the Gundu Rao Chief Ministership which too had a Kannada vs Sanskrit flavor. At that time, it was a decision made by Gundu Rao (Congress I) reversing one made by a prior Congress I Chief Minister, Devaraj Urs. Given the peculiar history of Karnataka state ( 3 distinct regions plus S Kanara dt came together to form the State), prior conflicts on the language issue with Marathi, the predisposition of middle and upper classes and their stated anxiety about the status of English alone during the Gokak agitation, what has actually changed now?  

  

I understand there is a non trivial amount of approved budget that's at stake here. That makes sense from the point of view of this group. But what are the larger issues at play here?
