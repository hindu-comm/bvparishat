This is the standard 'toolkit' (if I may use a cliche) of our LW scholars to demonize Sanskrit as the instrument of oppression of masses.

This has been going on in the Telugu states for a long time. The textbook committees are somehow infiltrated by the LW persons who

orchestrate this propaganda. The textbooks cannot have any passages from the Ramayana, Mahabharata etc., as they are supposed to promote one religion. The language too becomes an enemy. The Sanskrit scholars become defensive.
