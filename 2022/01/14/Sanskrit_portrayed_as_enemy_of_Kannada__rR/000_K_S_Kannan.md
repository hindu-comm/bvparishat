Newspapers in Karnataka are showing accusations against Sanskrit institutions

like Samskrita Bharati and Vyoma Linguistic Labs  

\- the gist of which is that they are treacherous -  

claiming that, Karnataka has given them land and support,

and these organisations are all out blocking Kannada.

  

Gokak Committee Report drama is being reenacted as it were.

  

I had drawn attention here, earlier, as to how with the post-haste and unthinking implementation of NEP 2020,

scores of Sanskrit teachers are shortly to lose their jobs in Karnataka.

Infact, Baraguru Ramachandrappa, a professed leftist, had thanked the BJP CM Yeddurappa

for this implementation ; you can figure out what such praise would mean.  

  

And now this.

  

Will Samskrita Bharati and Vyoma etc. give full clarification both to BVP and the general public esp. in Karnataka  

reg. the situation - much before the opposite camp (which includes many officials appointed by BJP)  

quickly whips up large-scale anti-Sanskrit sentiments with a good deal of emotional blackmail,

freely interspersed with half-truths, untruths, and innuendos?

  

Caveat: What happens in Karnataka may repeat shortly in other states also.

Question : Have there been some lapse in this regard in the framing of the NEP 2020 itself?

Or has it been misinterpreted/misapplied? Can changes be made even now wrt the Policy

if it is indeed in need of it?
