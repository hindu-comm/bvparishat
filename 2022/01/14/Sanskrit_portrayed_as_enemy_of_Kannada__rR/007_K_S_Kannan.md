While the NIE clipping kindly sent by Prof. Paturi is quite helpful,

it is not clear what is in stake for the *Sanskrit* organisations?

More importantly, why are Sanskrit organisations *alone* fighting?

How about other languages?

  

Is NEP itself myopic, or is the interpretation/implementation myopic?

What would be the best way out now, now that the order has been passed?

  

While/before NEP was announced,  

could none perceive the sinister possibilities it may lead to?

  

Time perhaps that SB should think of having a legal wing too (if not already there)  

in order to study legal implications, or to stall unwelcome moves.

"A stitch in time" is required.  

  

To rescind orders, or to somehow wriggle out of embarrassing situations

may be difficult for the govt. too.
