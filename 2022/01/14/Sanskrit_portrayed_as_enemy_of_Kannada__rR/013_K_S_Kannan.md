Caste issue, high-marks-given-in-Sanskrit-issue etc. are all there,

and are no wrong diagnoses.

  

Yet the problem presently is a bit different; it is that of  

the choice of "only two languages" in Degree classes,

with the regional language made compulsory.

  

Either they make it three languages with the compulsory regional language,

or two languages of the student's choice.  

100 for English, 50 for Sanskrit, 50 for Kannada could serve, perhaps.

There could be different/better solutions also.  

  

Have SB and VL sought the cooperation of  

organisations of other languages such as Hindi?
