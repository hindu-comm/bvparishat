Perfect !

  

Yes, English being compulsory, choice being among Indian languages including Sanskrit and in some places languages like Persian and French is the crux of the issue.

  

Does NEP 2020 make /retain English as compulsory ?

  

I didn't find any such stipulation or recommendation.

  

Yes, continuing three languages at Higher Education level or within the two language system at Higher Education level, not perceiving English as compulsory is a solution. Then Sanskrit, Kannada /Telugu can be the two languages if the student /parent so chooses.
