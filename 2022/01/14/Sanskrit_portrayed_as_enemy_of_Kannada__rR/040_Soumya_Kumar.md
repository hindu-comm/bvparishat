Namaskaras.

  

I was a student in high school at the time of the controversy and wish to share a funny fact. Content of first language Sanskrit at the high school level was "elementary" because,technically we studied Samskrita but we answered the majority of questions in either Kannada or English! Due to this we were able to score quite high.

  

Furthermore, at that time, securing a rank at the state level exams of 10th standard or SSLC as it is known in Karnataka state board exams was considered as a highmark in students' life. Invariably, the first few ranks were secured by students who opted for Samskrita as the first language and this also caused a lot of heartburn.

  

Mr Gundu Rao's caste was the usual red herring. Today Karnataka has moved far away from making Kannada mandatory for all students at the school level. The Government of Karnataka itself runs English medium schools and those schools are quite successful in attracting students. Covid-19 helped those schools along with many other schools as far as enrollment of students is concerned.

  

In this background, making Kannada compulsory at UG degree level makes no sense. Government is also playing along with activists so that NEP 2020 can continue.

  

with regards
