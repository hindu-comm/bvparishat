Namaskar,

  

Please find the link to the Call for Papersfor the forthcoming issue (Vol II Issue 2 - May 2022) of the*International Journal of Studies in Public Leadership,*and do spread the word:[Call For Papers - IJSPL (rashtram.org)](https://journal.rashtram.org/call-for-papers/)

  

The key themes of this CFP are:

  

1\. Statecraft, administration, diplomacy, strategy, rights and duties, which bring forth non-modern outlook or even the recessive or marginal political perspectives of todayâ€™s times.  
  

2\. The role of language and rhetoric in the construction of power and authority, especially in the roles of bards, poets, chroniclers, court jesters/fools and their counterparts in our contemporary times.  
  
3. The cross-cultural idea of the state in the popular imagination and the changing dynamics of the relationships between the state and its subjects.

  

Thanks and regards,
