Friends,

  

Greetings from abroad. Happy New Year. While spring is blossoming

in India, we are in deep freeze, currently Boston is in snow. In general  

however the climate appears warmer than usual, there continues the  

debate about the man-made causes of fossil fuel combustion. On the  

positive side, the James Webb telescope did lift off without problem and  

now is moving forward beyond the moon. We will get pictures next month.  

  

I am attaching the next article of the Ramayana series from Valmiki.  

We are in the preparation of the war.

The previous articles are archived at the same site.

  

A Hindi translation also came out last week. I am attaching the PDF file.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

Boston, US
