sabhAyai nama:

  

I came across some versions of Sakuntalam, in which the vidhushaka uses abusive words.. For example in second chapter, Raja Dushyant, Vidhushaka and Senapathi have a conversation. The vidhushaka wants to take rest while the Senapathi urges the king to go on hunting..

  

The vidhushaka, although funny, calls the senapathi as Daasyaa: putra.
Is it acceptable that before the king, the vidhushaka, although being friend of the king, call the Senapathi as born from illegal birth etc.

  

Some versions of Shakuntalam skip this word usage specifically. I have attached screenshots of both versions. Please do throw some light on, how the Vidhushaka in general behaves and whether he is always excused
of profanities.... Granted, the vidhusaka is to entertain all sorts of audiences, the verbal abuse of a military general seems out of place.

  

namo nama:

Srikanth.
