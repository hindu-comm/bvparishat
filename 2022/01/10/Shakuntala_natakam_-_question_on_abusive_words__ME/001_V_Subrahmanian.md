Namaste

  

Thanks for pointing out the difference in various editions. If Mallinatha or any other has commented on this 'abusive' word, maybe that could settle the issue.

  

By the way, are there any other instances in famous texts such as the Kavyas where such 'abusive' expressions refer to someone who is indeed not a subject of that abuse?

  

warm regards
