All

  

In this connection, I remeber Shri Kaul quoting verses from Srimad Bhagavatam like scriptures stating that Uttarayana refers to the movement of the Sun towards North.

  

And in those references, we come across that "Vishu" refers to the day when day- duration and night-duration are equal.

  

My question,please

  

Is there any such reference in any vedic literature ( samhita or brahmana) that vishu refers to the day when both day & night durations are equal??

  

Thanks
