Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

   Could anybody help me get a copy (soft or hard) of the following?

# Uṇādi suffixes and words derived with such suffixes : a concordance based on the works of Śākaṭāyana, Bhoja and Hemacandra

Dr Kanshi Ram (2001): "Unadi-Sutras in the Sanskrit Grammatical Tradition" mentions under bibliography (p.167):

 Gupta, S. Sen: "Uṇādi suffixes and words derived with such suffixes", Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. VI, 1964.

  

   The following link says, it was reprinted from the above Vol.VI.
