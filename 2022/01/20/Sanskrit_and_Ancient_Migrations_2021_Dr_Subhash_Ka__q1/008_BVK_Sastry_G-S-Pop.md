Namaste



On \< L Srinivas : Kak clearly has no sense of historical linguistics. How does he include 'palli', 'nira (water) etc into Sanskrit vocabulary of 2000 BC or before? This is pseudoscience.\>



Prof. Bijoy Misra has provided an important and right pointer to study ‘Samskrutham’ using ‘Panini's संज्ञा theory – connecting to Yaska's निरुक्त ’ to understand Dr.Subhash Kak’s presentation. There is a critical need to bring out ‘Samskruth studies’ from the shadow model of ‘ Babel Tower linguistics’.



Misra ji’s pointer resonates to current neuroscience approach in understanding ‘what is human language’. Misra ji’s pointer connects to wisdom in the traditional encrypted ‘sutra-like-statement’: ‘Study Samskrutham as language-grammar of ‘Unified Vedanga Tradition’.



This native tradition uses a ‘different model’ of ‘History –Time line – Linguistics’ in comparison to religion-theology locked language view built on ‘Flat earth - God created human societies migrating and carrying a branched out language stream to Bharath’.
