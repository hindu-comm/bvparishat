Dear scholar friends,

I just read Dr Kak's article. It appears to me Dr Srinivas's charge is impulsive.

Dr Kak is contesting the basis of PIE and so he is contesting the basis  

of PIE etc. Many others have done. Mostly the PIE theory is unconvincing

to trace the language development in India.  

Talking about the origin of words and their use in language, I have long

believed in Panini's संज्ञा theory. We are studying ऋग्वेद lately in a weekly

session to track words. (we are slow, we are in सूक्त 72 this week). We do

notice the large influx of "labels" in various ways. Yaska's निरुक्त becomes

a reference for us. Most verbs are made out of the objects than the objects  

made out of Paninian धातु. Many धातु themselves appear as single letter  

"objects" and then get transformed into verbs.  

It looks to me that scientific linguistics should be aimed to determine the  

association of sound to a meaning (cognitive perception) instead of focusing

on engineering assessment of mileage of migration. I will write more later  

after we put together our analysis.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
