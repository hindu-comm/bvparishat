The section '*Dimension 3: Towards a pūrva-pakśa of Indo-European (IE) linguistics*'in the paper[The A of ABC of Indian chronology\*: Dimensions of the Aryan problem revisited in 2017](https://www.academia.edu/38556391/The_A_of_ABC_of_Indian_chronology_Dimensions_of_the_Aryan_problem_revisited_in_2017), presented at a conference in IIT Madras, might be of related interest.
