Namaste Dr. Misra,

  

Thank you for your interest.

I have emailed pdfs to you separately, as requested.

I leave this thread (initiated in July 2020) here (<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/N1hSyzwsfm0/m/D413w8aGCAAJ>) in which I have added content related to the Nirukta, that I have come across, after July 2020 (which includes talks by Dr. Gauri Mahulikar ji and Dr. Vasantkumar Bhatt ji).

  

Best,

Megh
