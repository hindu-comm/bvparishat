Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

  

   I could trace only one link forPrakriyasarvasva (Unadikhanda) on the internet.

I downloaded it. But sutra numbers 350 and 351 (3.77 & 3.78) are missing in it.

Please see here:

   On p.67

<https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.383725/page/n77/mode/2up>  

  

   On p.68

<https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.383725/page/n79/mode/2up>  

  

   If anybody has access to a printed book, or has access to some other soft copy, kindly help me sort out this problem.

  

   In the alphabetical list in the appendix, one can find sutra no.350 as

भञ्जेर्गश्च 350 (p.8 in the appendix):

But I could not trace sutra no.351.

  

 Regards

 Narayan Prasad.
