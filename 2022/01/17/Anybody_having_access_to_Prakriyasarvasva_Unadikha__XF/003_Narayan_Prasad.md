Since T.R. Chintamani has supplied in the list of wordsभगालम् III-77 and सृगालः III-78, there is no doubt that he considered"भञ्जेर्गश्च"
and "सर्तेर्गुक् च" as sutra no. III-77 and III-78 (cumulative sutra numbers 350 and 351) respectively. But these two have appeared as part of commentary under sutra III-76.

  

BTW, theसरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव has these two sutras under 2.3.102 and 2.3.103.
