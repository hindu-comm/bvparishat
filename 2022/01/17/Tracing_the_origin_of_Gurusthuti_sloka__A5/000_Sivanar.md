SAdara praNAm,

It is our tradition to invoke blessingsof our guruparampara before starting swAdhyAya and pravachana.

The slokas starting "NArAyanam padmabhuvamvasishtam.." or "SadAsiva samArambhAm.." are the most common invocations.

Those knowledgeable vidwat varishtas may please be kind enough to enlighten about the origin and tradition of these slokas.

namovAkam.

*Prof. Sivakumar*
