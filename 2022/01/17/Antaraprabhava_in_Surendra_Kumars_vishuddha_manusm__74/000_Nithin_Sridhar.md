Namaste,  
  

In the last few decades, there have been a number of attempts to provide a revisionist interpretation of Manusmriti. Most well-known of such attempts is offered by Dr. Surendra Kumar of Arya Samaj through his work 'Vishuddha Manusmriti' which among other things claims that only 1200+ of 2600+ verses of Manusmriti are authentic.  
  

In this latest essay, I critique the revisionist interpretations provided by Dr. Kumar by a careful examination of just one instance: *his interpretation of the term 'Antarprabhava' as a reference to Ashramas* (rather than mixed-varna groups as held by Sanskrit commentators) and showing how his interpretation is untenable and rooted in preconceived bias.
