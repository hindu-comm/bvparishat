Sometime in the 1500’s CE, the Portuguese brought to India the green chili (हरी मिर्च, പച്ച മുളക്, લીલા મરી, பச்சை மிளகு, ఆకుపచ్చ మిరియాలు, ಹಸಿರು ಮೆಣಸು.) Since then, it and its different forms such as its dried powder have become unavoidable ingredients of the Indian curries. What was used in place of the green chili in India before the 1500’s? 

In Kerala, I think it was black pepper (काली मिर्च, കുരു മുളക്, મરી, மிளகு, మిరియాలు, ಮೆಣಸು.) I say this because the meals prepared during the śrāddha ceremony avoid the green chili together with many other vegetables considered paradēśi (foreign) such as tomatoes, cabbage, carrot, potato, etc. Instead, these curries use black pepper. I find these curries prepared using black pepper very tasty. In the olden days, black pepper might not have been easily available in other parts of India (there were no trucks or trains to bring the pepper from Kerala to other parts of India in that not-so-distant past.) So, what was used in the rest of India in place of the green chili before the Portuguese brought it to India?
