Namaskar,

  

Sharing with you a talk on (link:)[Ram Swarup’s ‘Hindu Sikh Relationship’ \| Sreejit Datta \| #SangamTalks - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGaKZWnJFNY)

  

This talk offers an outline of Sikh history as delineated in Sri Ram Swarup’s 1985 pamphlet, titled*Hindu-Sikh Relationship*. It identifies the socio-historical, cultural, and religious moorings of the Sikh community within a larger Indic tradition, the role of the British in creating a fault-line between the Sikhs and the Hindus, post-independence politics, and provides an honest exploration into the common civilisational destiny of the two communities.  

  

Thanks and regards,
