Respected scholars,

I am looking for papers / books which explain the Vaiśeṣika concept of samavāya relation.

I am aware about the following works.

1\. Padārthadharmasaṃgraha of Praśastapāda

2\. Vyomavatī of Vyomaśivācārya

3\. Nyāyakandalī of Śrīdharācārya

4\. Vaiśeṣikasūtra of Kaṇāda

5\. Upaskāra, Vivṛti and Bhāṣya on Vaiśeṣikasūtras.

  

Kiraṇāvali does not deal with samavāya in much detail, as it does not extend to that section.

  

I would be obliged if scholars can guide me to other papers / books which throw light on samavāya relation.

  

I am interested in particular to know what all kind of relations are encompassed in samavāya e.g. अवयवावयविनोः, गुणगुणिनोः, क्रियाक्रियावतोः, etc.
