Angus Maddison is the only acknowledged data analyst on the subject though his numbers are pie in the sky, albeit educated.

  

I went through his spreadsheets in detail in 2028 during the lockdown.
It has centuries of gaps, but on India, there was something intriguing :

  

1. India's assumed population was flat from 1AD to 1000AD. In other anecdotal information, apparently 30% of the population had become monks during the period, largely of the Buddhist and Jain variety. The last three centuries of this period also saw the rise of the Arabs who effectively disintermediated direct Indian trade with Europe.

  

2. GDP grew but took a dip between 1000AD and 1400AD. Perhaps the early Islamic invasions were indeed very brutal, and the effect of that perhaps made the later ones realize that India's greatest wealth was her skilled labor. However, thet plundered and destroyed temple whose other core function was operating as banks for industry and trade. Therefore you have an usurious taxation system under the mughals later but with firmans both from Babar and Aurangzeb banning cow slaughter - it's all round value in agriculture and local transportation of goods was recognized. But population grew strongly during this period according Angus Maddison... Not sure why or how.

  

3. Sashi Tharoor and others may be referring to per capita income not GDP during Mughal rule. Perhaps the usurious taxation during the time dampened population growth, thus impacting per capita income positively. There was also a mini cold wave for a few hundred years during the time.

  

4. The British marveled at the Indian's ability to bear the usurious Mughal taxation system. They loaded more tax on, took capital out of the country enormously unlike the Mughals who made relatively minor contributions to Mecca and Medina and the Ottomans. Furthermore, their policy around the industrial revolution deliberately destroyed Indian industry from textiles to salt in favor of British imports - capital not taken out was thus also taken out through forced British imports into India. The situation become dire leading to the 1857 revolt, whose failure made it far worse, culminating in the partition Holocaust that also took away India's bread baskets both in the west and east. So British rule completely trashed the economy.

  

5\. Nehru was suspicious of capitalism based on India's experience with the world's first listed multinational company with an army (US armed forces has provided such security to MNCs irrespective of country of origin since India's Independence, but now withdrawing). While Nehru borrowed ideas from the Soviet Union and was friends with the Arab Muslims, most of his ideas were uniformly against the Indian ethos and culture, except perhaps in technical education and capital intensive heavy industry. Only his son in law Feroze Gandhy could keep him somewhat in check in parliament, especially against corruption.

  

6\. Konrad Elst is right. Narasimha Rao remains the only great and national ethos synchronized prime minister since Independence. Yet, there is nothing named after him. Dogs were allowed to feed on his remains upon cremation in Hyderabad. To this day India is coasting on his laurels.

  

7\. India and the US are the only two major countries in the world that are not meaningfully dependent on trade. While the US became self sufficient for energy since 2014 and expected to remain so for a century, India is not. But the nearest large economy market for all major gulf oil producers is India. That coupled with Modi's engagement is the reason they have warmed up, out of necessity, to India recently, even against Pakistan.

  

The future can be very bright for India if it becomes self sufficient at the local district economy level, as Rajaji and MK Gandhi wanted and Nehru disagreed, like it always was before the British. But it all remains to be seen.
