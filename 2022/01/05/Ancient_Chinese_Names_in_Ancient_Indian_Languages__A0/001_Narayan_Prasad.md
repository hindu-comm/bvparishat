Since Chinese does not have any alphabet, the proper nouns (names of persons and places) cannot be expressed properly in Chinese.

For this purpose, all they can do is to use the approximate syllables in Chinese (e.g. A, wang, chang, bie, ling, jio, jing, cao, shang, hai, thai, yuan etc).

Take for example my name - NARAYAN PRASAD.

When I was at Oxford in 1988, I asked one student from Beijing, how to write my name in Chinese. He asked me how I write it in Roman. When I told him, he suggested the following:

NA-LA-YAN PO-LO-SA-DE

  

Another technique is to break the proper noun into parts and if they are such that they can be translated into Chinese, they express it in translation.

Take, for example, OXFORD. Break it as: OX-FORD. Both parts make sense. They translate OX and FORD into Chinese for this name.

  

Two pages from the book "On Yuan Chwang's Travel in India" are attached for an idea how proper nouns were translated in those days.
