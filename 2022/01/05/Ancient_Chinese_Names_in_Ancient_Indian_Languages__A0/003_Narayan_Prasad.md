I suggest the following -

Please refer to the Table of the Speech Sounds of the Beijing Dialect.

Break your name in the following manner.

LA-DA-GUI-RI-SHE-NA

  

In Chinese, there is no direct "R" sound. So, convert it to "L". Although "R" is used, it is pronounced sth like "ZH" (ഴ) in Malayalam.

The "G" in Chinese is pronounced as Indian "K", e.g. "GUO" is pronounced asक्वो.

"SHE" is pronounced as श.  

  

Alternatively, you may select from the table any other combinations and I will tell you how to write your name in Chinese.

  

"LA-DA" in Chinese is pronounced as ला-ता.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
