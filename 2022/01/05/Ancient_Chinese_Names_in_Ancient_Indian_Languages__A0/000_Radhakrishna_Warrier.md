How were the names of Xuan Chang and other Chinese Buddhist monks who came to India in the ancient times transcribed in Sanskrit, Pali, any of the Prakrits, the different Apabhramśas or in any other ancient Indian language, if at all these names were written in ancient Indian languages? Like the name of the Greek Buddhist king Menander (Μένανδρος Menandros in ancient Greek) which became Milinda in the Indian languages.
