Information about Indo Scripts Raksha Trust (ISRT).

  

Indo Scripts Raksha trust is a Non-Profit or a Public Charitable Trust registered under Indian trusteeship act. We are in pursuit of digitizing paper manuscripts, palm leaf writings and rare printed books. Our focus is mainly in the areas of Sanskrit and Indic languages and studies. The purpose is to preserve the rich heritage and knowledge available in them.  
  
Our Trust has been formed and is being run by a group of committed and dedicated professionals who want to preserve knowledge in printed books and manuscripts. The objectives are to prevent the loss of knowledge stored in old books and manuscripts, to preserve them for posterity, to provide access to the same in a digitized form and to create awareness about the availability of this material in the public domain.  
  
The Trust does not charge any fee for the digitization. The Trust obtains permission for digitization from the custodians of the material and makes them available in a digitized form.  
  
It is our constant endeavor to help organizations to provide access to the same online on a continued basis. There is a huge amount of old, valuable, and often fragile material that needs preservation. and it is our continuous pursuit to prevent loss of the knowledge stored in them.
