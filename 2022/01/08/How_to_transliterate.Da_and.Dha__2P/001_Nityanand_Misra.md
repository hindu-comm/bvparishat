I am not sure which standards support them, but I used ḏa for ड़ and ḏha for ढ़ in my book*Mahāvīrī: Hanumān-Cālīsā Demystified*. For example,

  

**raghupati kīnhī bahuta baḏāī  
tuma mama priya bharatahi̐ sama bhāī  
**  
**jo yaha paḏhai hanumāna-calīsā  
hoya siddhi sākhī gaurīsā  
**  
The code point for the character ḏ in Unicode is U+1E0F (<https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1E0F>). Should you wish to use the corresponding upper case character Ḏ, the code point is U+1E0E (<https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1E0E>)

  

The Unicode Devanagari Standard (<https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0900.pdf>) usesDDDHA for ड़ and RHA for ढ़. No sane author or publisher would use DDDHA/dddha, though RHA/rha is still okay as some place names with ढ़ are indeed transcribed with rh, e.g. Chandigarh. An option, if you are using Hunterian style transliteration, is to use rra for ड़ and rha for ढ़, which is what the Bengali Unicode Standard (<https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0980.pdf>) uses for ড় and ঢ় respectively. Still there is room for confusion as rra could stand for either र्र or ड़ and similarly rha for both र्ह and ढ़.

  

If there is no standard which addresses this issue, the best option would be to use your own special characters, like I used ḏa and ḏha, and clarify them in the transliteration key. I am attaching the transliteration key from my book for your reference. I used the IAST with one modification and two additions, which was sufficient for my use.

  

Hope this helps, Nityananda
