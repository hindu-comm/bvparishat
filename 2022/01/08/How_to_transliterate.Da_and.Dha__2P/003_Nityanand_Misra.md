Thank you, Suresh Garu. The *convention* you mention is not a general convention (across transliteration schemes). For example, IAST uses the dot below r for the vowel sounds ऋ (IAST: ṛ) and ॠ (IAST: ṝ). I personally dislike ISO 15919for there use of a ring below r for ऋ (ISO r̥) and ॠ (ISO r̥̄). This requires the use of two (U+0072 U+0325) and three (U+0072 U+0325 U+0304) code points, respectively. It is a pain for typesetters, though not a major one.In contrast, the IAST representations for both these are one code point each: U+1E5B (<https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1E5B>) and U+1E5D (<https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+0157>). I have never used ISO 15919 in any book of mine, for the reason that I believe far more readers are used to IAST than to ISO 15919. Most prominent Indic publishers whose books I own (Gita Press,Motilal Banarsidass, Chaukhambha, BBT, etc.)mostly use IAST. The IAST-ISO 15919 differences are confusing at times. Nevertheless, a work which needs to have both voiced alveolar stop and retroflex flap may benefit from ISO 15919.
