Namaste,

  

I am not able to find the roman characters for ड़ and ढ़. I have checked for IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration) and ISO 15919.

  

Are these characters not supported for transliteration? If so, how can we get them included for transliteration?

  

If ड़ and ढ़ are supported, what the roman characters of them?  

  

Thank you.

  

Regards,

Gaurav Goel
