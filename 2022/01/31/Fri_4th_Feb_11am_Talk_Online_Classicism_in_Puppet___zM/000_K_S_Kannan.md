ABSTRACT  

Indian performing Arts is dynamic in nature. It continuously modifies itself with time and  

survives keeping its intrinsic nature together. It is interestingto see how the puppet theater of India  

has done this over thousands of years, keeping the form and content intact.  

The study of the role of story-telling and design aspects of the Bombeyata of Karnataka led Anupama Hoskere  

to discover its relationship with the text of complete theater, Natyashastra. With access to the first principles,  

which is indeed the science of the Arts, Dhaatu Puppet Theater productions were designed answering the question - Why.  

The puppet shows have travelled many corners of the world and gained the appreciation of people at large  

with no language or culture barrier. The talk is a window into her fascinating journey of discovery of  

this extraordinaryart form of Indian puppetry.

highest Indian recognition given to practicing artists. She has wide experience in every facet of the

lighting and sound effects in puppet theater. She has created, to date, 14 one-hour long puppet  
productions and 8 short puppet performances including several productions which include dance  
and puppetry combined in absolutely endearing proportions. A careful and detailed **study of the  
Natyashastra** provided Anupama much impetus to expand the intricacies and intellectual merit of  
her productions.

  

Anupama received the **Senior Research Fellowship from the Ministry of Culture** which gave her  

an opportunity to redesign the old puppet theater into a more complex layered theater - combining  
dance, theater and puppetry into one Broadway scale performance of about 80 minutes. She is the  
recipient of the **Erasmus Mundus scholarship given by the UN** to teach Indian puppetry in Europe.
