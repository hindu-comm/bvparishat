Namaste KSK



1. I agree with you on this. \< Yes, both should happen.> . What can we do ‘together as a Home Team of Linguists and Techno-Linguists’ ?



2. Question/Expectation : Would it happen in our life time, with Panini Team lead? Deliver Panini-Computer ? 



3. On \< It is when you are able to "teach" something to the computer, the giant idiot, that you have the guarantee that you have clearly and fully understood the problem, and given the solution.



 The ‘in-house question’ I have raised is the following: ‘One can teach only what one knows.

Have we a clear understanding of the model to teach the ‘Sacred language: Panini Samskrutham, the

Brahmi- Bharati’ in the framework as provided by Panini- Patanjali –Yaska :: The framework which covers the entire range of semantic web design and A.I - starting with ‘Word Generation (Vyakarana Sutra- Panini) – Validation (Patanjali –Bhashya)- semantic Extraction of semantic communication in a context sensitive way (Yaska – Nirukta – Adhivachi / Vak-yoga sampradaya) – in short called ‘ Muni-traya , vedanga paddhati’.

This is the road map and traditional answer to the question on ‘How to teach Samskrutham’ to Computer.



If the current Techno-Sanskrit-linguists approach is to design and use ‘Romanized representation of Brahmi Varna-Maalaa and adapt ‘English like language- semantic processing model’ on the given technology constraints
from corporate, to ‘TEACH-PROCESS SANSKRIT FOR COMPUTER’, what could be the outcome ? Should we call it as ‘Sri Rama’ is same whether presented in the cultural dress code of India’ or the ‘Jeans and shorts’ of current west ? After all ‘computer god processes all languages same way using ‘numeric representation’ ?? 



4. On \< AI technology may have much to receive from, and much to give as service to, Indian heritage.

Why not? No mesmerism; it is just a question of pragmatic mutual give-and-take - designed for mutual benefit. \>. Sure. Technology
accepted. But Panini- ‘ Sutra -giving’ should not end up in ‘Patanjali – Bhashya- surrender and slavery’ . The ‘Yaska’ would go completely
haywire and lost ! 



Can we have an effort to keep Panini- Patanjali –Yaska aligned to ‘Vedanga sampradaya’ to serve Indian Brahmi Linguistic heritage in its native format pl?

‘Pangu-andha- nyaya model of cooperation is O.K. But not ‘ blind leading the blind’- the caution note from Katha 1-28- ‘.. andhenaiva nīyamānā yathāndhāḥ ..>
