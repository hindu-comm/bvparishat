Doesn't look like a breakthrough in the use of technology for academics/learning.

I do recallsome Python learning programs using such customized learner specific data. If I remember it correctly, it was one of MOOC from MIT, and it used to identify the user based on the typing style!

To me it looks like a differently branded BYJU'S or WhiteHatJr of Japan. No doubt, a great deal of effort must be involved in developing it.

They claim it to be customizable to any native language.
