Namaste



On \< When will this happen to Sanskrit>- The way things are going on, not in ‘our life time, at least !



1. One thing for Sure that could happen, rapidly, is ‘AI-based SANSKRIT Teaching - a personalised coaching by Harvard- Oxford- Standards, for ‘Sanskrit Conversation’ (limited edition)’. These are not new. This model of digital solutions for multilingual users have been there ever since 1980’s . The innovation is the new language of explanation bringing in neuroscience and brain zonal images.



2. One thing for Sure that will NOT happen with the given current level and models of TECHNOLOGY is

‘AI-based PANINI SAMSKRUTHAM’ Teaching -Analytics - by ‘Muni-Traya’ Vedanga Vyakarana Standards’.



3. **If** current Sanskrit scholars get amusingly attracted with the power of current ‘A.I . Technology’ and expect it coming close to ‘ Natural Language Learning’ due to the ‘Science Visuals of brain- language – memory – neuro centers shown’, and hope to see ‘AI – algorithm based Sanskrit Natural Language Processing’ 

**there need be no fear for at least next five decades**. It does not mean rest and nice sleep. It is a clear sign that the warning note of technology speed to capture human heritage language is that close.



Current technology of neuro-sciences is still very very far from what it takes to ‘advance from ‘A.I (Artificial Intelligence of 20^(th) century talk) to Artificial General Intelligence ( Talk of year 2021) where the gap between Industry model of learning- programming ‘silicon chip’ and Natures model of ‘brain chip’ to program –use language as ‘cognitive linguistics’ explained by Panini –Patanjali tradition would become clear. When the global corporate are digging deep in to Panini, the tradition-insiders are mesmerized by the ‘ projected indra-jaal / indras net of projected future’.



Anyway, still looking for a time when native techno-scholars of ‘Romanized models of studying Panini tradition’ would come to open discussion on Cognitive linguistic framework at the core of ‘Ashtadhyayi’ as ‘Vedanga Vyakarana’.
