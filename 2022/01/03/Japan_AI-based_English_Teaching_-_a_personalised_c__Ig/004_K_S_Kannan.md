BVK: "When the global corporate are digging deep in to Panini,  

the tradition-insiders are mesmerized by the ‘ projected indra-jaal / indras net of projected future’."

  

Yes, both should happen.

  

It is when you are able to "teach" something to the computer, the giant idiot,

that you have the guarantee that you have clearly and fully understood the problem,  

and given the solution.

  

AI technology may have much to receive from,  

and much to give as service to, Indian heritage.  

Why not?

  

No mesmerism;

it is just a question of pragmatic mutual give-and-take  

- designed for mutual benefit.
