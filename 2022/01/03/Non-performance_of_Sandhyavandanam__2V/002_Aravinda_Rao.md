Namaskars,

I have not followed the discussion in this thread. Should we not think about the need to revise the dharma-shastras? They are not eternal.

They have to change according to technological and sociological change. Religions all around are coping with globalization and its resultant

change in social values.

We are aware that we are not following the dharma-shastras in toto. For instance, if I have to follow Manusmriti I have to offer meat during sraaddha

ceremonies for my parents. I can eat five types of animals. No one is doing this. For this, we quote another dharma shastra.

The very existence of around forty dharma shastras shows that there were changes frequently.

Unless we cope with the changed environment, our children would not bother to implement theantiquatedrules. The girls are already

showing their defiance, as we see in the USA, by marrying outside Hinduism and the orthodox youth are remaining as bachelors.

The most important aspect of Vedanta is that every human being is entitled for the knowledge of Brahman. This should further encourage us to seek

revised dharma shastras.

The question would be as to who would revise them. The pontiffs of important peethams have to come together and do this. If they do not do so, we are forced

to modify the rules for ourselves while thoroughly staying in the vision of the Upanishads which are universal - above caste, creed, varna or religion. This alone

will keep our children within the fold of religion.
