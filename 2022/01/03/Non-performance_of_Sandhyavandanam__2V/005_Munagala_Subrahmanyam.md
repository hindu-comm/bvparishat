Respected sir

  

Vedic Scholars like korada sir were suitable to answer this. Even it happened to me also.

  

I haven't performed sandhya vandana for 8 years atleast but after my sringeri visit i started performing sandhyavandanam continuously .

  

I performed पाहित्रयोदश होम , विरजा होम and other homas as प्रायश्चित्त होम । Being my father studied vedam I don't know what he performed as प्रायश्चित्त होम । I sat and have done what he told me to do . So pardon me for not locating the exact answer for you sir. But after that प्रायश्चित्त होम iam performing nitya karma.

  

So I feel vedic scholars like korada sir were suitable to answer this query .

  

Thanking you sir .
