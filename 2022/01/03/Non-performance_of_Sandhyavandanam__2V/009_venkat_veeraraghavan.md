*I have not followed the discussion in this thread.*

--->If you have not bothered to read the thread, why are you posting here?

Why not make a new post?

  

Should we not think about the need to revise the dharma-shastras? They are not eternal.

---> There is this irritating concept of "adhikara" in sanatana dharma for everything. So by that count, most of the "twice born" who wear a cotton thread for the exclusive purpose of scratching their back and as a secure anchor for their house keys are disqualified.

Maybe as kaliyuga progresses and such brahmana-bandhus become the holy cows of society by dint of their pontification on "vedanta" they might become the new "adhikaris" of dharmic society.

  

And why do "our children" need to be kept within the fold of "religion", when the parents do not have the will or wit to follow svadharma?

  

There is much for introspection here.
