Respected Vidwans,

  

If after formal upanayanam, a brahmin does not perform sandhyavandam at all or does not perform sandhyavandanam for many years, but resolves to start doing sandhyavandanam properly, what does he need to do per shastra-s (dharmashastra-s etc) and shistachar ( the conduct of learned men or peers) to (re)gain the eligibility to perform sandhya?

  

Is it required that a prayaschitta vrata (vow of atonement or expiation) be undertaken by that brahmin? If so, what vow is prescribed or recommended in this regard for the current age?

  

Or is it assumed that the previous upanayana samskar is considered ineffective/soiled and a new upanayana samskar needs to be performed for that brahmin, afresh?

  

Or is he required to start doing sandhyavandanam (considering it is a nitya-karma) but further have to additionally do a specified number of japa of the savitri/gayatri mantra as penance?

  

Or is sincere repentance sufficient and the brahmin can start doing sandhya immediately?

  

In the current time and circumstances (desa, kala, paristhiti) what would be the appropriate course of action?

  

Pls advise.

  

with kind regards

G Kashyap
