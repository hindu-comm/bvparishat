Namaste

  

I present my humble opinion here which is more based on my experience

  

Sandhyavandana, especially the Gayatri japa is the key to unlock the entire mystery of the Upanishads. Constant chanting of Gayatri by meditating on its meaning will over course of time reveal itself and lead one on the path of Brahma jnana.

  

If one has developed an earnest interest to restart the Sandhyavandana, it's good news. The person has to be encouraged to do so rather than dissuading / discouraging by mentioning so many prayashchitta karma etc. The biggest prayashchitta is that the person is guilty of not doing sandhyavandana for so long.

  

My suggestion would be to ask the person to take sankalpa that now on he will not give up the sandhyavandana under any circumstance. That I guess is enough. We have many anecdotes in the lives of Acharyas of Kanchi and Sringeri peetham where they have done this.
