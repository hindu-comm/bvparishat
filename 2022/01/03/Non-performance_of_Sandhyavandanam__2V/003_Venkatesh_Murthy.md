Sir

  

On the other hand the Abrahamization of Hindu Dharma is also dangerous. We see the Hindus celebrate white Christmas and the New Year like the Christians especially in cities. In Dharma Sastra there are plenty of Prayascittasfor committing blunders. Where is the need to further water down the rules? The Mathadhipatisshould bury philosophical and sectarian differences and solve hard problems but will it happen?
