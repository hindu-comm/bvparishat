Dear Student,

  

To know anything about any work in manuscript-whether published of not- first thing is refer to the volumes of the New Catalogus Catalagorum of the Sanskrit Dept.of Madras University,Chennai.

  

Then discuss that with your Guide.

  

How do you expect others to suggest to you any topic for doing research without knowing your academic background and interest.

  

Best of luck in your search and research.
