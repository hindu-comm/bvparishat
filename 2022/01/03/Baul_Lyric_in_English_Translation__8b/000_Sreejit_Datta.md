Namaskar,

  

"I am a shoreless boat, a hapless one -  
Take me across, O Merciful One!"  
  
Sharing my English translation of Lalon Sain's timeless Baul lyric "*Pāre Loye Jāo Ᾱmāye*", a Bangla song which enunciates the soul-stirring yearning of the Bhakta seeker for union with the Divine.  
  
Read, discuss, share: [Pāre Loye Jāo Ᾱmāye: A Yearning in Lyric by Lalon Fakir - Swatantra Mag](https://swatantramag.com/pare-loye-jao-%e1%be%b1maye-a-yearning-in-lyric-by-lalon-fakir/)

Thanks and regards,
