Dear Prof Wakankar

  

I found this shloka in one of the set of books from a Sanskrit learning/teaching course material created by Prof Ashok Aklujkar who was then at Univ of British Columbia , Canada. The title of the course "Sanskrit - An Easy Introduction to an Enchanting Language". I had purchased these set of books and casettes from him long ago (about 1998/99) when I had just begun learning Sanskrit.

  

regards
