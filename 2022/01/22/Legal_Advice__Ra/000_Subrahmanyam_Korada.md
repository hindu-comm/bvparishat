नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Here is a request .

  

May be some of us have been facing the same problem .

  

There are two Book Publishers - signed withme for 500 copies only - Copyright with me . 25 copies were given as royalty in both the cases .

  

One has been selling my book for the last 25 years and another for the last 13 years - both without any further agreement .

  

What kind of action can be taken in such cases and what is others' experience .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
