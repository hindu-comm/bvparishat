Wakankar ji,

  

I am surprised by your phenomenal memory. Based on your hint, when I searched at [jstor.org](http://jstor.org), I could locate the article. It is titled 'Kinds of Expositions in Sanskrit Literature' by Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, published in ABORI vol 36, in 1955. As you wrote this article discusses the terms vyakhya, tika, panchika, vartika, bhashya, etc. in detail.  

  

Please find attached a PDF of the article.  

  

regards  
shankara
