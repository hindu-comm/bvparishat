Dear Shri Abhyankar,

  

Your idea is good.pl.proceed very carefully.

  

Pl.read the Kavyamimamsa chapters,mentioned by Dr Bhattacharya for some general guidance.That was our First Publication in the GOS, Gaekwad Oriental Series of the Oriental Institute,Baroda.1916.

  

There are other books also in Marathi on KM,like by Prof.Dr.
Sau.Kamaltai Abhyankar,wife of Shri Shankarbhau Abhyankar,a great musician from Mumbai.

  

If time permits,I can also help you a bit in your commendable efforts.

  

Best luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
