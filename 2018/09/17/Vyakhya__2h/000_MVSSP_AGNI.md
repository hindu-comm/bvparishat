1\. What is the meaning of vyakhya 2. What are it's characteristics 3. Where it defined. 4. What is the difference between vyakhya ,tika ,tatparya. I tried in vachaspatyam and sabda kalpadruma but unsatisfied with those explanation. We know that sutra,vartika,bhashya (defined in vyakaran) differences but not vyakhya,tika,tatparya. At somewhere I saw what is a vyakhyan but I failed to locate it again. Hence iam asking the vidvat parishad for the answers. Thank you.
