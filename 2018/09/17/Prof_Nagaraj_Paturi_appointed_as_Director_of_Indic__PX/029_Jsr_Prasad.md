What can not be done in Universities can be done by institutions like Indic Academy. Today, contributions that instigate and promote interest in indic studies are from the best part of NGO's, Universities, Mathas, Gurukulas and individual scholars. Hence, it is a collective contribution to revive the glorious past. Indic Academy, Advaita Academy are few examples in this connection.

  

It is very heartening to note that the Indic Academy started this centre and one of the most competent scholars, Prof. Nagaraj ji has been appointed as its first Director. This news is quite refreshing. My heartiest congratulations to our beloved Professor from Hyderabad! Also, congratulations to the authorities in Indic Academy for all of their constructive, nation building projects.

  

Best regards,

Prasad
