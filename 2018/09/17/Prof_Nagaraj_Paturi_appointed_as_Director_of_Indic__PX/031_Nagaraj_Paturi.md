Thanks, Prof. Prasad for your kind words and a detailed appreciation of Indic Academy's work. Sri Hari Kiran Vadlamani-ji, the social entrepreneur behind it is a visionary and intellectual himself.

  

This Inter-University Centre connects not only universities but even Vaidika gurukulas among themselves and with the Universities.

  

You are already giving contemporaneity to your Department of Sanskrit. The mission at this Inter-university Centre, among other things, is to take such approach forward through shared effort among universities and guruklas.

  

I seek your active participation and help.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
