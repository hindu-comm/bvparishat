Dear friends,

Through our interest in language and speech, we dabble into oral expressions

and poetry. Last month we convened a South Asian Folk Poetry Festival

with our limited resources here in Boston. Ruth Hill, the Oral Historian

at Harvard joined as the Guest. A friend made a video of the afternoon

event.,It is two hours and includes Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada,

Odia, and Punjabi contributions. Poets from Bangladesh and Pakistan joined

among others. Mrs Lynn Carmen Chandra, the wife of late professor Pramod

Chandra of Varanasi also attended. I am sharing the video

A modest effort in this far-away land.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
