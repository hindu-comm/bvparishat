Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu of Rupa Gosvamin, 1.1.12, he quotes this  
sloka mentioning that it is from Narada-pancaratra:  
  
sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam \|  
hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate \|\|  
  
Does anyone have the source of this verse?  
  
I tried locating it in Jnanamrta-sara Samhita (famous known as Narada  
Pancaratra) but could not locate there.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
