Dear Shri Koradaji : Thanks for your extensive clarifications.

  

Shri Gowtham ji-Thanks for the photos of what a deva pavitra looks like.

Are you sure a hema pavitram needs to be worn on both hands? I did not know that.

  

My question to vidvans is- Is there any shastra that prescribes how any pavitram whether hemapavitam or darbhapavitram is knotted, or is this purely done as per tradition (presumably unbroken?) and passed on orally from father craftsman to son?
