Pavitram knotted with ब्रह्मग्रन्थि is prescribed for most purposes. Below attached description found in संस्काररत्नमाला of Shri भट्टगोपीनाथदीक्षित may be helpful. (I could not understand the method clearly.)

Someone has also uploaded a video showing method of knotting ब्रह्मग्रन्थि :

The method shown in the video, however, appears to be different from the one mentioned in संस्काररत्नमाला.
