Our family priest (kula purohita) used to deva-pavitra made of gold. In telugu we call it as "darbha muDi ungaraM". Even, the great srividyopasaka from Tenali who is known as "Chandavolu Maharishi" (actual name is Brahmasri Tadepalli Raghavanarayana Sastry Garu of Chandolu) used to wear this always.

  

I am told that those whose father is not alive, are eligible to wear this darbha muDi ungaraM (though not sure from where this niSEdha has come). Our family priest used to do tarpaNas with this ring donned in finger. And this is not to be disposed off ....obviously because of Gold :))
