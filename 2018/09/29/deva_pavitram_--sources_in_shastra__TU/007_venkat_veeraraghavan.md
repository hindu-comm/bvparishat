Dear Shri Koradaji,

  

Thanks for your explanation.

  

Katyayana's prescription was for Shukla Yajurveda I presume?

  

How would you interpret the reference to hemapavitram given in the attachment of the first post where it is mentioned in the section of Kushagrahanam for Bodhayana Brahmakarma that deals with KYV?
