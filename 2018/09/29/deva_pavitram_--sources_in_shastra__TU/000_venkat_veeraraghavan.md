Dear Vidvans,

  

I am told that deva pavitram or a pavitra ring made of gold is equivalent to one made of darbha and harvested with the appropriate mantras.

  

The advantage of a deva pavitram is that it does not have to be discarded after the ritual.

  

Can the learned ones share the source for advocacy of a deva pavitra withing shastras?

  

And are there shastras that give specifications about what its composition should be, what its structure should be like etc?

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
