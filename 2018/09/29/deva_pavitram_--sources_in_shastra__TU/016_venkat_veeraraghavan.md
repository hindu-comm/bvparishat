Dear Shri Arjun ji-

  

Thanks for the references. I did not know about mantra for wearing pavitra. I am learning new things every day!

  

Is there any mention in any shastra about how exactly to knot a pavitra? Or is this mainly done as per tradition wrt desha kala passed on from one generation to the next?

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
