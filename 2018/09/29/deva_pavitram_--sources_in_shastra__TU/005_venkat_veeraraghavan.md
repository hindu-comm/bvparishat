Dear Sriram garu:

  

There is a different version of the same nishedha in Tamilnadu. My mum was of the opinion that those whose mother is alive should not wear it. Apparently she got this from her mother in law.

  

But no nishedhas ar ementioned in the kushagrahanam section where only the efficacy of hemapavitra is mentioned.

The usefulness of a hema pavitra comes from 2 factors:

1\. Darbha has to be harvested by oneself (or one's disciples/sons) with proper mantras for it to be useful in vedic karma

2\. Darbha pavitras unlike hema pavitras have to be discarded after use.

  

Hemapavitras are a convenience considering that the Brahmakarmas and Grihyasutras make wearing pavitra for all nityakarmas compulsory.

  

Venkat
