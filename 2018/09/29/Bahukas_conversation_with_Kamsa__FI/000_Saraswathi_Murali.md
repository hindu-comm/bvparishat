नमस्ते ॥

  

Bahuka's conversation with Kamsa has been quoted in some of the recent speeches on economics. (e.g.<https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/economics-of-bahuka-and-greenspan/article22996129.ece> -"Bahuka figures in the Bhagawata Purana, and was the advisor of Jarasandha, who was Kamsa's father-in-law. Kamsa, who regarded Sri Krishna as his enemy, asked Bahuka's advice on how to make his subjects state-dependent. Bahuka told him: “Open your treasury to the people. Make the people eat, drink and enjoy themselves. Bring up children to look upon parents as old and useless. That will make them laugh at those who talk of duty, love and compassion. Like well-fed cattle at the mercy of the cowherd, the people will be completely dependent on you.”)

  

I'll be thankful if any member of the group can help me with the reference in Bhagawata Purana or other Sanskrit commentary which speaks about the dialogue between Kamsa and Bahuka. (The only reference I could find was in K. M. Munshi's Krishnavatara, volume 1, published by Bhavan, p. 50<https://archive.org/details/KrishnavataraVolume1TheMagicFluteKMMunshi1990BVB/page/n13>)

  

Thanks
