this is just my view on this.

  

hrishIkEna (sarvOpAdhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam **hrisIkesa-sevanam**) bhaktih (iti) uchyate

  

that means bhakti: hrishIkena hrisIkesa sevanam uchyate.

  

sarvOpAdhi vinirmuktam and tat-paratvena nirmalam are adjectives of hrisIkesa-sevanam

  

ie. the focus or devotion (sevanam) on hrisIkEsa is *without any strings attached* and *pure* since it is one-pointed ( or because it is pointed towards hrisIkesa, the lord of senses and it is not selfish)

  

Such a devotion by sense is bhakti. I dont know why singular hrishIkEna is used! or it can be justified that even using one indriyalike the eyes, or ears one can focus on the Lord HrishIkEsa.

  

This is kAshyapIya vyAkhyAna and does not conform to any system of thought!üòÅ

Is there any problemwith this?  

  

(note if senses are outbound there is a problem, if senses are inward bound, it leads to amrtatva).

paranchikAni vyatrnatsvayambhu..... verse and the kashchit dheerahpratyagAtmAnam Aikshat verse support this view.
