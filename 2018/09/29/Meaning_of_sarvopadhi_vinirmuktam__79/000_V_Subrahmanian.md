Namaste

  

This termsarvopadhi vinirmuktam is a very common adjective in relation to many deities. A google search yields many results. I would like to know what this term means. A member had posted this verse:

  

In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu of Rupa Gosvamin, 1.1.12, he quotes this  
sloka mentioning that it is from Narada-pancaratra:  
  
sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam \|  
hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate \|\|  

  

What is the meaning the school of Rupa Goswamin would give to that term? In Advaita, this term with some variants, only in the place of vinirmuktam, vidhvasta, vivarjita, apaasta, etc. is used very frequently and has several instances and they all mean that the visheshya of that visheshana is Nirguna chaitanyam. In the light of this, I would like to know what other schools that approve of this term mean by that.

  

Thanks
