Thank you Krishna Kashyap ji for the several links to this verse and its meaning. In one link, the first line of the shloka is explained as a result of the worship while the other links show the first line of the
shloka as a prerequisite for the ideal worship. In any case I would like to know the anvaya of the shloka as it evades my understanding:

  

sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam \|  
hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate \|\|

  

It looks like the first line is a visheshana, adjective, for the
hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ. Alternatively, the first line seems to be the preparation, refinement, of the indriyas (hrshIka) and with thus purified indriyas one should worship the Lord.

  

Would anyone please clarify the sense of the shloka, with the anvaya?

  

Thanks

warm regards
