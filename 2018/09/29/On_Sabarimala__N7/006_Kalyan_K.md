//In this Video talk, in Tamil, by someone who has done a deep study of the 'Shaastaa' idea, it is stated that with regard to the Sabarimala temple not much can be said because all we have is 'new' structures/shrines as this was installed after a fire some decades ago. I haven't listened to the entire talk yet.//  
  
  
The talk is in Tamil so I cannot understand it. When I searched the net I found a report of Mr. Kesava Menon, Deputy Inspector General of police, which talks about an arson incident in the temple in 1950, where the idol has also been damaged. Has a new idol been installed in 1950 then?
