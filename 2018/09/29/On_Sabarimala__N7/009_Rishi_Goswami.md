Respected Nagarajji, I have a doubt regarding the entry of women.

It is evident that menstrual women should not enter temples in Shastras, but was the entry of women in this reproductive age banned because of the nature of the diety, as Naishthika Brahmachari, or it was prohibited fearing that menstrual women may enter secretly and that would lead to the Tirobhava of the diety from the idol?

I want to know which Tantra or Aagama scripture does this temple follow and is there any mention of such rule in it? Before the HC judgement, is there any case of women entering the temple? Is it true that Maharani Karthika Thurunal had entered this temple?  
  
Does this temple work according to the Tantra Samucchayam?

Is this rule ancient or it's been made to prevent by-chance entry of menstrual women?

I just want to know the exact position of Shastras in this case.

Thank you Sir. \_/\\\_

Regards  
Rishi.
