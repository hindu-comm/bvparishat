Someone has posted a Tamil article in FB that has reference to //Memoir of the Survey of the Travancore and Cochin States, Period of study 1816 [A.D.to](http://A.D.to) 1820 A.D., Vol.1, 2 and 3 // according to which this text contains evidence that the British Govt. had accepted that the rituals/practices of Sabarimala have been in vogue from very early times, 12th Century CE. This 'Memoir' that was printed by the British Govt. in 1920 was accepted as evidence by the Kerala Govt. in 1994. It is stated in the Tamil article that these 'facts' are slated to be placed before the Supreme Court in the review petition discussion.

  

If the 'Memoir' book can be accessed from Archive or any other source, one can read the contents.
