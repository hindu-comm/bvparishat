> > When Marthanda Varma, the ruler of Venad established the kingdom of > Travancore in 925ME(1749AD), Pandalam was not annexed but allowed to > continue independent. This can be due to two reasons:

1.  the cordial relation that existed between the two families even
    from the time of inception of Pandalam kingdom 2.  To quote from the Travancore State Manual, the co-operation of the
    Rajas of Pandalam "was of great advantage to Marthanda Varma for the
    subjection of Kayamkulam.”

> After Tippu's invasion of the Malabar coast in 965ME(1789AD), Pandalam > was asked to pay an amount Rs. 2,20,001 to the Travancore govt. > towards the cost of the war. The amount was to be paid in installments > from various sources. Once in 969ME (1794AD), the income from > Sabarimala temple was hypothecated by the then ruler of Pandalam for > the above purpose. In 995 M.E (1820AD), the then Ruler of Travancore > suggested that the Travancore government would support every member of > Pandalam royal family and the future progenies thereof in a manner > befitting their status for all time to come provided the Raja of > Pandalam entered into a ***written agreement*** with the Travancore > government consenting to have the revenues in Pandalam collected by > the officers of the Travancore government.Upon the Raja of Pandalam > accepting the above proposals, the Pandalam kingdom was merged with > Travancore. Since then, a monthly pension is being paid to the > Pandalam family. Administration of the temples, including Sabarimala > within the Pandalam kingdom was also transferred to Travancore > government and subsequently to Travancore Devaswom Board. > (highlighting mine)
