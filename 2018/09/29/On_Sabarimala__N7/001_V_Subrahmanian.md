

In this Video talk, in Tamil, by someone who has done a deep study of the 'Shaastaa' idea, it is stated that with regard to the Sabarimala temple not much can be said because all we have is 'new' structures/shrines as this was installed after a fire some decades ago. I haven't listened to the entire talk yet.
