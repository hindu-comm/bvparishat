Dear Sri Rishi Goswami-ji,

  

1\. Do the regulations of life style during the menstruation have any roots in the Vedic texts /Vedic worldview ? Yes, in the Vedas/Puranas, there is the story of The brahmahatyaadosha acquired by Indra for killing Vritra was distributed among The Earth, Oceans, Trees and Women in the form of Cracks on the Earth, Waves of ocean, Milk oozing from the trees, Menstrual cycle of women.

Obviously, the narratives such as this communicate some natural phenomena in the form of these narratives. Since it is well established that Indra is a nature force and Vritra obviously is another nature force destroyed by this nature force. Thus the remaining part of the story must be communicating some natural phenomena in a narrative language. As such the words curse, dosha etc. in these narratives do not actually carry their literal meanings.

and then you might want to understand the Vedic narratives in the light of these understandings.
