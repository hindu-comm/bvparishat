Namaste  
  
  
When the recent Supreme Court verdict came on the issue of menstruating women entry into Sabarimala temple, I became curious about how old was the practice of excluding such women into the temple. An argument often put in favor of excluding women is that the idol is naishthika brahmachari. (Is this correct?) But when I looked at wikipedia, it says that the idol was installed only in 1910.  
  
  
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabarimala>  
  
  
I am not sure whether the reference given in wiki is reliable or not.  
  
  
So I want to know with proper references (no speculations please)-  
  
1. Whether the idol was really installed only in 1910.  
  
2. How old is the practice of excluding menstruating women from the temple?  
  
3. Are there any inscriptions or literary evidences (not legends) that can give us an idea of how old the temple could have been?
