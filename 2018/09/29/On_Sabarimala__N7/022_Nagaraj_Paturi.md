The source from which this story comes itself shows the intentions. The intention is to show that the whole issue is centred around "Brahmanical".

  

That apart, a few points of academic interest:

  

1. "Mala Araya means King of the Hills."

  

The local word or self description of most of the tribes in India in the language of the respective tribes means " King" or " King of the Hills" .

  

2\. Many famous elaborately constructed hill shrine temples having connection with tribes of the temple neighbourhood is also a pattern found in many parts of India. The elaborate architecture and the architectural style of the temples show that the the involvement of the non-tribals in the temples is not recent. The antiquity of the non-tribal participation , historical information such as dates, dynasties, donations etc. in most places is well recorded and well researchable. Involvement of tribes in the form of

  

-   offering their own worship at the shrine -   offering security to the pilgrims in the wild forest region -   tribal characters being part of the narratives of local legends of
    the temple shrine, sometimes one of the deities at the shrine itself
    being a tribal character in such narratives

is also a pattern common in many of such hill shrine temples.

  

All such facts prove a harmonious relation among the kings, non-tribal pilgrims and the tribals believing in the deity of the temple.

  

3\. Anyone who is aware of the history of tribes-state relationship in India know that the most draconian anti-tribal laws got introduces only during the British colonial rule.

  

4\. Artha s'aastra instructs harmonious relationship between the state and the tribes /tribal kingdoms. The documented historical facts show that most kings followed such instructions or their behaviour was not in contradiction with such ideas.

  

5\. Marxism, an essentially anti-religious thought can never claim to be a protector of any religion including that of the tribes. If at all they make such claims it can only be strategic and politically motivated.

  

6\. Independent Indian government(s) inherited most of the British mindset is a well known fact. One of the consequences is the Devaswom boards tilting the balance in the co-operative and harmonious relation among the tribal , royal and brahmin participants in favour of brahmin and royal participants with the (mis)understanding that the crowd-pulling will get adversely affected if it is done otherwise.

  

7\. Solution in such circumstances is to bring back the pre-modern balance amongthe tribal , royal and brahmin participants, but not the extreme of 'handing over' to tribes.

  

8\. But the entire nexus among the capitalist west, Indian Marxist and the anti-Indic anti-grassroots groups in the mask of 'liberal' do not allow such a harmonious settlement.
