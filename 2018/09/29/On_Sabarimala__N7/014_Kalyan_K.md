//1. The present idol was installed in 1952//  
  
Yes, this is due to the unfortunate desecration of the temple. But on the internet, I have seen claims that the previous idol was installed in 1910. Is this claim correct?  
  
  
//3. Boothanatha upakhyana of brahmanda purana Talks about this temple//  
  
  
Can you please ask him to give the references from any of the published versions of this purana?
