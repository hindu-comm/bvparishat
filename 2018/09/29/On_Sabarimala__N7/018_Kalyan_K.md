From one of the links that Sri Paturiji has given -  
  
  
//Tribals living in the hills around Sabarimala alleged that the government and the Travancore Devaswom Board were trying to demolish centuries-old customs by allowing entry of women in the 10-50 age group into the famous Sabarimala temple.//  
  
  
//He claimed access for general public to the Sabarimala temple started only in the beginning of the 20th century and earlier only royals and priests used to trek once in a year during Mandala-Makaravilakku season to the hills for performing poojas.  
  
"Lighting of lamps in the temple used to be done by our forefathers because no others dared to enter the shrine in the deep forests more than a century ago. Our people survived in this forest which had wild animals including tigers and leopards as we are protected by Lord Ayyappa," he said.//  
  
  
I am not sure I understand the following two claims put together -  
  
1. Women were prohibited from entering the temple from many centuries.  
  
2. General public had access to the temple only from the start of 20th century.
