One can assume the wider definition from the verse of Manu itself. एकदेश of वेद - a portion of Vedas, वेदाङ्गs - Vedangas+subsidiary sciences and वृत्त्यर्थं - for aajeevikaa. One who performs as mentioned is called an Upadhyaya.  

  

The usage of word in SB 10.42.36 mean 'instructors/coach' (to the wrestlers). So, Upadhyaya possibly could teach 64 kalaas. Wrestling is one of them. In SB, the term is used in the sense of priest/teacher/instructor/spiritual master (4.29.56, 6.7.32,
10.66.27-28, 10.71.23, 10.83.20)  

  

At Manusmrti 2.145, neither Methatithi nor Kullukabhatta did not elaborate upon this term. It is the same case with verse 5.90.
