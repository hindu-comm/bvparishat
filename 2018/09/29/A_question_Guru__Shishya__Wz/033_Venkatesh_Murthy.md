Namaste

  

In Mahabharata there is one episode of Pandavas and Kauravas playing a ball and the ball falls into a well. They cannot get it out. Drona throws arrows at the ball and makes a chain of arrows and pulls out the ball. Bhishma is impressed and makes him Guru for the boys. This is showing a Guru cannot be directly tested but some time or other the Sishyas will get opportunity to test him and his knowledge. The opportunity will come. A fake Guru will fail in the test. A real Guru will pass.
