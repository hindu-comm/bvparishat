Seriously, Dear Prof Deshpande,

  

Is this verse quoted is by a Poet or a Writer named mAdhava ( is that you? )That means this verse is not in any purAna or any 14 main sources of knowledge of Hindu system such as vedanga, dharma shastra or vedas etc. right? I am just trying to understand the source. Can we say a Kalidasa or a yAjnavAlkya or some rishi said this? (may be in a different format).

  

Speaking practically, this verse has a valuable meaning. Someone can be mislead by a teacher and waste all the time. Similarly a student that studies under a bad teacher can end up wasting all the time and go astray from the truth. We are talking serious stuff such as Brahmha vidya here.

  

The reason I am asking this question is on a serious note. Someone asked this question to me. There are so many Swamijis and Godmen around. How can I find the right Guru? One person answered to such a question that there is a verse somewhere which states "A guru who does not test his student or a student who does not test his teacher will go to hell". I just want to find the nature of source of this verse.

  

Thanks.
