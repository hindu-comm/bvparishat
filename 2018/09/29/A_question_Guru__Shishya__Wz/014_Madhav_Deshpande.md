There is an interesting passage in the Gaṇeśa-Atharvaśīrṣa: इदमथर्वशीर्षम् अशिष्याय न देयम् । यो वै मोहाद् दास्यति, स पापीयान् भवति । This suggests that a Guru has to somehow make a distinction between śiṣya and aśiṣya, before accepting someone as a disciple. Testing a Guru seems to be a rather difficult proposition. If one has the ability to test a Guru, one would not need a Guru in the first place. American universities require an evaluation of the teacher by the students at the end of a course, and this process if filled with dilemmas. Students who are not getting a low grade or are failing in the class are likely to give a bad grade to the teacher, and the teachers are likely to be unduly generous in grading in the expectation of a better grading from the students. There is no satisfactory solution to this dilemma as yet to my knowledge.
