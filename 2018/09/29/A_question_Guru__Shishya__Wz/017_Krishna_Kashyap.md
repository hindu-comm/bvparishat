Ganeshaatharvasirsa relates to adhyatma vishaya. University teacher student relation and that too in America is totally different.

  

I am wondering how a shishya can evaluate a guru regarding adhyATma? I think this is impossible. Agreed.

  

This may deal with some ApATatah evaluation. Or superficial assessment to make sure Guru has some qualities like shrotriam bramhanishtam etc as stated in upanishads.
