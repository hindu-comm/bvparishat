\>The reason I am asking this question is on a serious note. Someone asked this question to me. There are so many Swamijis and Godmen around. How can I find the right Guru?  

  

------ The question seems to be centred around the proliferation of the self-styled god-men.

  

Their misdeeds are doing disservice to India is true. But how to stop people from believing blindly in false gurus is a tricky issue. There seems to be no solution.
