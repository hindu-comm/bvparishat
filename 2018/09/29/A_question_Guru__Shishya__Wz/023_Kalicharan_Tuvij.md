A guru-  
1) should be an unpopular - if not unknown altogether - person. Example, if in a room filled with people, there ought to be distinctly lesser people near the Guru.  
One has to swim against his own nature (curb tendencies) in order to be able to move near a guru.  
2) should have been - at least in some past - in a skill based profession rather than in a knowledge based.  
3) transfers most of intelligence to sishya in nonverbal ways.  
More often is the case when a guru simply transfers knowledge (non verbally) to someone without the someone ever knowing who that person was. But ofcourse not everyone is that lucky.
