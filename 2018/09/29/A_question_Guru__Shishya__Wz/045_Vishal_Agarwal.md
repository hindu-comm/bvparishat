For who is a good student, please refer to chapters 5, 6 and 11 of my online book on Hindu values at the link below (freely downloadable). We use this book in our Temple School for 6th or 7th standard students.

In 2017, I co-wrote the following booklet ('Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teenagers') for our annual summer camp. You will find some relevant stories, quotes and concepts in this link as well.

Some other relevant scriptural statements:

Knowledge went to the Brahmana and said, ‘I belong to you…. Samhitopanishad Brāhmaṇa 3.9

It is better to die without passing one’s knowledge to anyone, than to impart it to an unfit person. Samhitopanishad Brāhmaṇa 3.10

To be deserving of receiving knowledge, the student must have six qualities – celibacy, benevolence, power of retention, learned, lover of knowledge, and he who upon getting the knowledge teaches it to another. Samhitopanishad Brāhmaṇa 3.11

To be a very successful person the celibate student must in addition have eight more qualities - intelligence, appreciation of teacher, self-discipline, faith, critical approach to the subject, not disclosing the knowledge to an undeserving person, retention power and serving the teacher. Samhitopanishad Brāhmaṇa 3.20

They call those men Acharyas who are devoid of greed, who are self-possessed and devoid of arrogance, straight forward and who are educated and self disciplined. Brahmaanda Purana 1.2.32.31

  

"An Acharya is one who fully understands the conclusions of the revealed scriptures. His own behavior reflects his deep realization, and thus he is a living example of divine precept. He is therefore known as an Acharya, or one who teaches the meaning of the scriptures both by word and deed." Brahmaanda Purana 1.2.32.32

  

Only students with the following qualities deserve to be taught according to scriptures – grateful, free from enmity, intelligent, pure, free of mental and physical diseases, not in the habit of fault-finding, virtuous, strong and capable (of serving), family member, giver of knowledge (in return for knowledge), and giver of wealth (in return for knowledge). Yajnavalkya Smriti 1.28

  

“A good student must have a good intellect, be respectful towards holy people, be of good conduct, desirous to learn about the true nature of things and men, render faithful service to the master, must not feel self-important, respect the master, await the proper time and opportunity to place his questions and doubts before the master, keep his senses under control, control his mind, be not jealous, have faith in the traditional teaching, be tested by the master and be grateful…Vedanta Deshika, Nyasa Vimshati 4.”
