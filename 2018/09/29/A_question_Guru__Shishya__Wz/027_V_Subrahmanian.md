Sri Vedanta Desika's verse on the ideal Guru:

  

सिद्धं सत्संप्रदाये स्थिरधियमनघं श्रॊत्रियं ब्रह्मनिष्ठं

सत्वस्थं सत्यवाचं समयनियतया साधुवृत्त्या समेतम् \|

दम्भासूयादिमुक्तं जितविषयगणं दीर्घबन्धुं दयालुं

स्खालित्येशासितारं स्वपरहितपरं देशिकं भूष्णुरीप्सेत् \|\| (7.2) (*Nyasa-vimsathi*1)



(The seeker of Ultimate Treasure, the Knowledge of the Supreme, must aspire for a preceptor who is steadfast in excellent tradition, is of firm mind, is sinless, is adept in the*sastra*, is decidedly established in*Brahman*, is of predominantly*sattvik*nature, speaks the truth always, is of exquisitely time-regulated conduct, is free from vanity, jealousy and the like, has won over attachment towards all external worldly objects, is a long standing kin, is compassionate, corrects him if he were to lapse and is ever intent on the well being of those around Him and others.)
