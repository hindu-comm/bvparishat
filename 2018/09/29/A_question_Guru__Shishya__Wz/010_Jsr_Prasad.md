I think, your question pertains to Guru-Sishya in context of Adhaytma-vidya because, a teacher is not a Guru and and student is not equal to a Sishya. Also, it is easy for a Guru to act as a 'teacher' but it's difficult for a teacher to act as a 'Guru,' in context of Aatma-vidya. Hope, I am not confusing!

  

I could see an instance in Upanishads: An ideal Guru is like Yamarat and an ideal Sishya is like young Naciketas, as we see in Kathopanishad. Caraka in Vimanasthana speaks of qualities of Guru and Sishya for Adhyaapana and Adhyayana, respectively. You might be interested to look into the attached compilation, that I published six years back. Please excuse any mistakes.

  

Regards
