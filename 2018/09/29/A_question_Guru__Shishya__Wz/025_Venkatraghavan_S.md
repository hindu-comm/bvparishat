Namo vidvadbhyah,

You all know this already, but I am mentioning it as the context was addressing the proliferation of fake gurus, and how to find the genuine guru in the forest of fakes.

  

The muNDakopaniShad mentions two qualities required in the guru who teaches brahma vidyA

तद्विज्ञानार्थं स गुरुमेवाभिगच्छेत्समित्पाणिः श्रोत्रियं ब्रह्मनिष्ठम्  

- that he is a shrotriya, someone who had studied the shAstras under a competent guru under a pre-existent tradition (अध्ययनश्रुतार्थसम्पन्नं says shankarAchArya), and that he is a brahmaniShTha, one who knows Brahman and abides in Brahman (सर्वकर्माणि केवलेऽद्वये ब्रह्मणि निष्ठा यस्य सोऽयं ब्रह्मनिष्ठः, as commented upon by shankarAchArya).

  

Thus one can use these two yardsticks as a way of identifying the real guru among the charlatans.

  

Now, it is quite difficult to know if someone else is a brahmaniShTha or not, but we can be sure of one thing. If someone claims to know Brahman, they surely do not know. As the kenopaniShad says, यस्यामतं तस्य मतं मतं यस्य न वेद सः। अविज्ञातं विजानतां विज्ञातमविजानताम् ॥ It is more of a negative test than a positive one.

  

Similarly, if someone has not studied the Veda under a sampradAya, but claims to be a guru, then one can safely steer away from them. As said by shankarAchArya, आत्महा स्वयं मूढः अन्यांश्च व्यामोहयति शास्त्रार्थसम्प्रदायरहितत्वात् , श्रुतहानिम् अश्रुतकल्पनां च कुर्वन्। तस्मात् असम्प्रदायवित् सर्वशास्त्रविदपिमूर्खवदेवउपेक्षणीयः ॥

  

Kind regards,

Venkatraghavan
