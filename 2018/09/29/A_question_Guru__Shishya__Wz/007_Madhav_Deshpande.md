Sadly, this happens even in American universities. At Michigan, Engineering students were required to take two humanities courses, but these were counted only as pass/fail by the Engineering College. So these students had no motivation to study more than just getting a passing grade in humanities courses. The only time these students were worried was when they were going to fail. One of such students wrote a paper on "The Philosophy of the Punishers." It turned out that he had just used the word "Punishers", rather than "Upanishads", throughout his rambling ten pages. Didn't matter to him. Only when he received a failing grade in my class, he came back to complain, rather too late.
