Arjuna does not hesitate to interrupt to remark

(though toning it down - through his *iva*-s):

*vyAmis'reNeva vAkyena*

*buddhim mohayasIva me.*

He states at the end, however,

*nas"To mohah smRtir labdhA ...*

*sthito'smi gata-saMdehaH*

*karis"ye vacanaM tava*

*(*andnot

*gato'smi sthita-saMdehaH)*
