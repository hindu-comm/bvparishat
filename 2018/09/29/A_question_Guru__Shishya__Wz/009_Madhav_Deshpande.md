Dear Krishna Kashyap Ji,

  

  This is my own verse. Please do not quote it as a citation from a classical source. The only verse about examining the words of the teacher that comes to my mind from a classical source is:

  

तापाच्छेदाच्च निकषात् सुवर्णमिव पण्डिता:।परीक्ष्य भिक्षवो ग्राह्यंमद्वचो न तु गौरवात्।।

  

This is what the Buddha says to his disciples. This is a citation from Śāntarakṣita's Tattvasaṅgraha \[verse 3588\]. With best wishes,

  

Madhav M. Deshpande
