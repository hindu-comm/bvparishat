There is no new noun word needed . samaahita itself is a noun word.

  

Sanskrit has naama (subanta) , aakhyaata (tinganta) and avyaya as categories of words.

  

sammaahita itself is a naama (subanta) stem.

  

It is a verbal noun but noun nevertheless.

  

It can function as adjective too as most nouns in Sanskrit can.
