Namaste,

  

I have not come across a complete English translation of Drishtantakalikasataka, also known as Drishtantasataka.

  

There are 2 Hindi translations.

1\. Drishtanta Sataka with Hindi translation by Nandalal Sastri 1932 Venkatesvara Steam Press.

2\. Drishtanta Sataka Ek Samikshatmak Anusilan - A Study, with text and Hindi translation by Krishna Sarma 1992 Anila Prakashan, Lucknow.

  

There is also a Sanskrit tika on Drishtanta Sataka by Jivananda Vidyasagara in 'Kavyasangraha' part 2, page 96 onwards. This is available online at the link given below.

Several verses from DS are there with English translation in the volumes of Mahasubha Subhashita Sangraha of which volumes 1 to 8 are available online. The list of verses of Kusumadeva can be found in the appendices of these volumes.

regards  
shankara
