Respected Scholars,

  

Pranam.

  

I need a little help and I request you all for the same. I want to do parayana of SriRajaShyamalaSahasranama, but the portion where details regarding shadanga mantras and shapotkilana are written, I am unable to understand. Please have a look at the attachment. If anyone can please help me, then I will be greatly thankful to him/her.

  

Regards,

Harshit Shrivastava.
