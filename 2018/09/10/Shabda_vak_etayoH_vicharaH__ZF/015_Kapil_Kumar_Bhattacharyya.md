Revered Sirs,  
  
My apologies for the delayed correspondence.  
  
Revered Sir (Bijoy Ji),  
  
I would very much like to read your paper.  
  
Revered Sir (Dr. Korada Subrahmanyam Ji),  
  
I will be grateful if you could tell me the text where we find the verses: परावाङ्मूलचक्रस्था पश्यन्ती नाभिसंस्थिता ।  

ह्रुदिस्था मध्यमा ज्ञेया वैखरी कण्ठदेशगा ॥  
  

I feel that these verses can help us in explaining human communication from the biological point of view.  
  
I would also like to read the Brahmakanda translation by you.  
  
Revered Sir (Kalicharan Tuvij Ji),  
  
I will be grateful if you could tell me the source text of your observations.  
  
With thanks and warm regards to all.
