नमस्ते,  
  
1st order argument is when someone quotes authority. 2nd order argument is when someone argues what he thinks the authorities imply.  
Here let me make a 2nd order statement:  
Technically,  
शब्द = मध्यमावाक्  
Similarly,  
वर्ण = पश्यन्तिवाक्  
वाक्य = वैखरीवाक्  
  
The true equivalent - or the mirror - of the word वाक् is -- गो
