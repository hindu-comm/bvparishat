Revered Sirs,  
  
I am a researcher seeking to explore "Ancient Indian Communication Thought". In the context of the present discussion, I have a query.  
  
In the Rig Veda, it is said that speech is known to be developed in four stages, of which only the last stage (vaikhari) is known to ordinary mortals.  
  
So can we say that the difference between vak and sabda is implicit here because to my mind, sabda refers to the articulated form of speech which then would fall under the purview of vaikhari whereas vak as a communication activity would refer to the sum total of all the four stages of speech construction.  
  
In other words, can it be said that sabda is a subset of vak/vac?  
  
Please let me know your views on the same and kindly forgive me if I have made any erroneous observation.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Yours sincerely,  
  
Kapil Kumar Bhattacharyya
