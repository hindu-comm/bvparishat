नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

differences among sound, voice and speech may be of some help in this discussion

                            

                             ---- Vid. Prakash Pandey  

  

I rather think that there is not much to say for me in this regard --

  

sound includes any ध्वनि that is audible and if meaningful then it is called speech .

  

Some people argue that birds and animals do not have a language but make sounds -

but according to योगानुशासनम् (3-17) they too have their languages and one should try

to understand the same by following the devices offered therein .

  

Voice is the the गुण of sound although sometimes the term is used to denote sound itself.

  

Low voice - loud voice etc.

  

The degree of intensity ( गांभीर्यम् ) of sound may be expressed as - deep voice / raised voice etc.

  

In गान्धर्ववेद you have श्रुति -- high pitch / low pitch and so on .

  

It may be difficult , if not impossible , to explain in clear-cut terms as to what such English terms

do mean exactly because of their usage and diversity as British / American / Indian etc. .

  

As you have seen the scenario in Indian tradition is absolutely different .

  

धन्यो'स्मि
