I already said that my observations couldn't be directly sourced to a particular set of texts:

-since those are based on a 2nd order understanding of many authoritative texts.

  

However, as formidable Dr Korada has explained in the last post, shabda doesn't have its origins in the material realm; tracing shabda would otherwise be a rabbit hole. In Panini's shabda-shastra, for example, we have many vestiges from the past - older than Panini - that reveal surprisingly deep structures and no doubt will continue to engage researchers for centuries to come.

  

Yet on the other hand we have an overall idea that at vaikhari-vak level vaakya is the only semantic unit.

  

This results in the in conclusion that both varna-vak (varna vaada) and shabda-vak (shabda/dhaatu roopa + varna projection) -- though prexisting in all glory in their respective realms -- only work via projection in the domain of vaakya-vaak.

  

This conclusion atleast avoids the suggestion that our traditions are otherworldly and impractical.
