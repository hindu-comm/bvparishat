Namaste

1\. Professor Korada has explained clearly the difference between ' Shabda' and 'Vak'.; and also clarified the connection of ' Shabda- Tanmaatraa' as ' Guna of Aakaasha -panchabhoota - Tattva'. Indeed the discussion is technical and borders on the mystic nature of ' Vak-Devataa'

  

2\. ***A follow up request for clarification:***

  

Following the above logic, the  description of 'Samskrutham: The language of the Vedic documents' -  using technical Vedic term ' Vak- Yoga' for discipline describing as 'Vedanga Vyakarana'  can not be equated with the description of Vyakarana as ' Pada -Shaastra / pada- Yoga - Shaastra'. Would this be a correct positional statement? If yes, how, IF not, What is the correction needed ?

  

***Reasoning for the above question***:

  

Gita uses the term -' Vangmayama Tapah' ( 17-15) to detail how to use 'Vak' as Yoga in the format of Tapas. This is the direction of ' Mantra' usage of ' Vak' .

In this backdrop, the Vedic linguistics of ' Vang me manasi Pratishthitaa' … and ' Agnirme vaachi shritah' and ' Vak yajenna kalpataam' need to be understood in a much deeper sense than what it has been dealt so far. And this is critical to understand the ' Samskruth Linguistics : its History- Vision and Mission in Bharateeya Sampradaya'. 

  

It would be clear even for a novice that the' Bharateeya Sampradaya' of ' Vak: related linguistics' is totally different from the socio-historical model of 'Sanskrit linguistic studies' that is ruling over in the academics for over three centuries, with many champions holding this forte, even within Traditional schools and circles. The error is in proliferating and perpetuating the mistaken notion of 
'Vak-Yoga -Vednaga Vyakarana' to be a ' pada- nirmiti- vidhi shastra =
Word generating grammar rule book for a historical liturgical language which came to India from outside !  or got derived from one of the Dravidian languages or the ' Prakrits'. ??!!

  

***Fall out for failing to address this issue***:



When Sanskrit linguistics studies have gone south in its model and exploration, the same error has percolated the study of history and understanding Prakrit- Pali- Dramidams in connection with Bharateeya itihasa.

  

What would be the course correction path for Battle :Sanskrit callers and ' defenders of Vedic language education using conversation frame work' ??
