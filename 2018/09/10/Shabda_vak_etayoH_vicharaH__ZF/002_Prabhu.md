Very erudite response by shrinking Koroda-Ji. Thank you!

  

I had a question:

For this topic should we view shabda as a tanmAtra (shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa, gandha)  or as something different?

Can we view shabda as an over-arching term and vAk is a type of shabda?  

For eg: vAk is what is produced by a human for language based verbal communication, 

where as shaba is in general a viShaya for the shrOtRu indriya?
