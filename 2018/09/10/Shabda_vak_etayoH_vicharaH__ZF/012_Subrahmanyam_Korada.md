नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

sabda refers to the articulated form of speech which then would fall under the purview of vaikhari whereas vak as a communication activity would refer to the sum total of all the four stages of speech construction.  
  
In other words, can it be said that sabda is a subset of vak/vac?  

                                   
                

                        --- Vid. Kapil Kumar Bhattacharya

  

In a separate discussion you may , to make it easier to understand the concept of वाक् / शब्द , say

that --

  

चत्वारि वाक्परिमिता पदानि ... तुरीयं वाचो मनुष्या वदन्ति -- **ऋग्वेदः**

  

Generally the usage is - परावाक् , पश्यन्तीवाक् , मध्यमावाक् and वैखरीवाक् - this is purely at

philosophical level .

  

परावाङ्मूलचक्रस्था पश्यन्ती नाभिसंस्थिता ।

ह्रुदिस्था मध्यमा ज्ञेया वैखरी कण्ठदेशगा ॥

  

विखरम् = शरीरम् , तत्र भवा वैखरी ( अण् , ङीप् )

  

But at operational level , i e subject matter of व्याकरणम् , -- it is स्फोटशब्द (मध्यमावाक्) and वैखरीशब्द ।

  

वैखरीशब्द is the cause of मध्यमाशब्द --

the former does not have meaning and आशुविनाशी ( disappears as soon as it is pronounced ) / अनित्य as it is born and can be heard .

\- the latter is नित्य (immutable ) as it is not born and cannot be heard .

  

Panini and others took **both the शब्द्s which are essential for communication .**

  

**So if you wish to explain the process of communication from the point of view of व्याकरणम् then you**

**have to take both the शब्दs . And this is not said anywhere else - your's will be a unique contribution.**

  

For a detailed study of the subject go thru **ब्रह्मकाण्ड of वाक्यपदीयम्** ( my English tra. is available online .

  

I am not quoting the relevant verses for temporal and spacial considerations .

  

Also just wait for a vivid discussion - I am preparing full throttle to tackle the question of Vid Sastry

and after going thru that you may ask more questions - if any .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
