Revered Sirs,



My apologiesfor the delayed correspondence.



Revered Sir (Bijoy Ji),



I would very much like to read your paper.



Revered Sir (Dr. Korada Subrahmanyam Ji),



I would be very grateful if you may tell me the source text of the verses: परावाङ्मूलचक्रस्था पश्यन्ती नाभिसंस्थिता । ह्रुदिस्था मध्यमा ज्ञेया वैखरी कण्ठदेशगा ॥

I feel that these verses can help us in a better understanding of human communication functioning from the biological/physiological point of view. For that, I shall have to refer to the original text.



I would also like to read your translation of the Vākyapadīya (Brahmakāṇḍam).



Revered Sir (Kalicharan Tuvij Ji),



I would be very grateful if you may tell me the source text of your observations.



With thanks and warm regards to all.



Wishing you all greetings on the advent of Devi Paksha.



Yours sincerely,



Kapil Kumar Bhattacharyya
