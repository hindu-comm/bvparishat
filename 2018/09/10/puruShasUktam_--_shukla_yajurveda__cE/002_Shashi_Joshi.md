Interestingly this same ष ---> ख pronunciation transition is seen in Rajasthan. My grandfather would say words like

खडयन्त्र (षड्यन्त्र )

पुख्य (पुष्य नक्षत्र)

सुखेण (सुषेण in Hanuman Chalisa)

  

Common word बरखा comes from वर्षा

  

Does all ष become ख ? No. विष्णु remains as is.

What are the rules governing it? Not sure.

But it does give me an inkling that Vedic civilization may have been the same as the Sindhu Saraswati sabhyatā. Very mundane words seem to have Sanskrit roots.

E.g. the latch to the main gate that can be opened from outside by rotating the metal ring like knob, is called अर्गळा from (or to) Sanskrit अर्गल

  

  

Thanks,

Shashi
