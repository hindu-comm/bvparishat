नमस्ते

  

I believe the use of ख instead of ष in शुक्लयजुर्वेद is similar to the use of ळ interchangeably for ड in ऋग्वेद. I guess referring to the प्रातिशाख्य should help.

  

On a note similarto that of Sri V Subrahmanian, लक्ष्मीः (లక్ష్మి) becomes लच्चिमि (లచ్చిమి) --> लच्चि (లచ్చి) in Telugu. People use these forms interchangeably.

  

धन्योऽस्मि
