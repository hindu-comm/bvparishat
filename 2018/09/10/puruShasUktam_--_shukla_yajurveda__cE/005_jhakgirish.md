Dear colleagues

There is a sutra in Shukla yajuh praatishaakhya i.e." shah khah
tumrite" It means retroflex sha is pronounced as kha

except combined with the group t(tavarga).

Hence in Shuklayajurveda it is pronounced

as kha. But in kashta,vishnu,etc. It is pronounced as sha.Almost all over India it is pronounced as kha in Shuklayajusha.

I would like to mention that in our Mithila

(North Bihar) retroflex sha is not only pronounced in Shuklayajusha but in Classical

Sanskrit too pronounced as kha and also in

Maithili Language( a modern Indo-Aryan).

It would not be out of the context what I

would say.It has been coming from the Indo-European period.There is a Russian parallel "snokhaa" which resembles Sanskrit "snushaa" but both have the same meaning i.e.grand daughter.
