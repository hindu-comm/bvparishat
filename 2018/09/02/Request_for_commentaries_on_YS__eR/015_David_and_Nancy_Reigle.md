Dear Vidvans,

  

On the good question raised by Prof. Upender Rao regarding *ṭippaṇa* or *ṭippaṇī*, I also wondered if James Haughton Woods actually meant *ṭippaṇī* when he wrote *ṭippaṇa*. But it did not appear to be a typographical error. Thank you to Prof. Deshpande for quickly showing that the usage of *ṭippaṇa* can be seen in other texts. Thanks also to Prof. Girish K. Jha for writing that both forms are grammatically correct.

  

Apparently James Woods had seen *ṭippaṇa* used elsewhere and adopted it here. The original title page on the 1908 copy that he used is missing, as may be seen in the posted scan. Later I was able to purchase a copy of the 1911 Benares reprint from a book dealer in India, and it has *ṭippaṇī* on the title page. So, apparently unknown to Woods because of the missing title page, Svāmi Bālarāma had used *ṭippaṇī*.

  

Thank you to Prof. Harunaga Isaacson for pointing out that Vimala Karnatak's critical edition of the Yogasiddhāntacandrika commentary by Nārāyaṇatīrtha, published in 2000, is available online, and for providing links to it. I did not know about this, not expecting a book that recent to be available on the internet.  

  

Thank you to the always helpful Shankara ji for finding and providing a link to the 1922 edition of Yaśovijaya's commentary, which I had never seen before. Thanks also for the information from Sukhlalji's Hindi preface, which I am unable to read. I wonder if Pandit Sukhlalji purposely only gave extracts from Yaśovijaya's commentary, showing where it agreed or disagreed with Vyāsa's commentary. That would explain why it covers only 27 of 195 sūtras. The 2001 edition of Yaśovijaya's commentary by Muni Vairāgyarativijaya, titled *Pātañjalayogasūtr*ā*ṇi* and published by Pravachan Prakashan, is much longer and has Yaśovijaya's commentary on almost every verse. This edition, by the way, also includes the commentary by Bhojadeva or Bhojarāja. If anyone has more information about Yaśovijaya's commentary, I would be glad to have it. Thanks.
