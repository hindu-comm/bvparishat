Thank you very much, Shankara ji, for converting and translating from Hindi the relevant part of the Gujarati prakāśakīya.  

Thank you very much, Hemant Dave ji, for reading the Gujarati prakāśakīya directly and reporting on its content.  

It seems, then, that we do not know for sure whether this Prakriyā-vṛtti was written as such by Yaśovijaya, or whether it was compiled from his writings by Muni Vairāgyarativijaya. I suppose now the only way to know is to try to contact the editor or publisher.

  

Best regards,
