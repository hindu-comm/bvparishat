Namaste,

  

Thank you very much for the valuable information regarding the Yogasutra commentaries and their editions. 1922 edition of Yasovijayagani's Yogasutravritti is available online at Jainelibrary.  

  

<https://jainelibrary.org/book-detail/?srno=007442>

  

It is noteworthy that this vritti covers only 27 out of 195 sutras of PYS. Sukhlalji Sanghvi who edited the book says in his preface that vrittikara's intention was to show on which points Jaina Siddhanta agreed or disagreed with Vyasabhashya.  

  

regards  
shankara
