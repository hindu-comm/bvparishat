Dear Sri Amit Upadhye ji,

  

Many thanks for getting the answer directly from Pujya Ganivar Vairagyarativijayaji and posting it here. Now we know for sure. The sentence from the prakāśakīya that Shankara ji posted implied this, but did not seem to state this unambiguously.

  

Pujya Ganivar Vairagyarativijayaji did a fine job in putting together this commentary. I thought the references given in the footnotes to the commentaries on each sutra might be to parallel passages, rather than to the sources. Sorry that I misunderstood this.  

  

You getting and posting the definitive answer about this commentary is much appreciated by me.

  

Best regards,
