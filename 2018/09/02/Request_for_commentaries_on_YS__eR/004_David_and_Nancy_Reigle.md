Yes, many thanks indeed to Shankara-ji for the wonderful list of links to Yogasūtra commentaries available on the internet.

  

The Yogapradīpikā commentary by Baladevamiśra was published in the Kashi Sanskrit Series, vol. 85, in 1931 (reprinted in 1984). I do not know if it is available on the internet.

  

Best regards,
