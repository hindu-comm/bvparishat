Namaste Shankara ji,

  

I now see that Muni Vairāgyarativijaya has included the commentary that is only on 27 sūtras in appendix one of this 2001 book, calling it the Leśa-vyākhyā. The full commentary is called the Prakriyā-vṛtti. I have attached a file that has scans of the title page, copyright page, table of contents, p. 1, pp. 8-9 showing examples of the Prakriyā-vṛtti, the last page with colophons, and the first page of the first appendix having the commentary that is only on 27 sūtras. The colophon of the Prakriyā-vṛtti looks like a normal colophon. However, I did not see anywhere in the editor's Sanskrit introduction any mention of what manuscript(s) he used. The opening lines of the editor's colophon make me wonder if he put this commentary together himself from various sources written by Yaśovijaya. I was not able to read the publisher's statement that is in Gujarati.  

  

Best regards,
