DearDavid Reigle, Deshpande ji and other scholars,

  

Thanks for your views, as I already wrote in skt. Many unused words almost disappeared in present times. In fact in Hindi and also in some other Indian languages we never use many common words for glass, bus, class, car, etc many.

  

Cambodians are better than Indians because they use many Sanskrit based words. They say Lukru for teacher. It means loka guru. Whereas we say here-sir. No one calls us here with guru word in Hindi. All this some times appears to be Strange. Thanks
