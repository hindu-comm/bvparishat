Dear scholars,

  

I am looking for published commentaries on Yogasutra. The attached work mentioned 21 such published Sanskrit commentaries in bibliography from page 55-57.

  

I have been able to locate book 3 in this list.

I would appreciate if any scholar can point to pdf or purchasable copy of any of the above work.

Also any other Sanskrit commentaries on Yoga works would be welcome.

  

Best wishes
