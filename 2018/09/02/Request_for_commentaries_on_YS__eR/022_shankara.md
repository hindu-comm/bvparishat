David ji,

  

You are right in saying that the 'pravesika' doesn't mention anything about the authorship of the commentary.

  

I converted the publisher's note (prakasakiyam) into Hindi using Google OCR & translator. Google's translation from Gujarati to English was very poor compared to Hindi. So, I myself translated the relevant part into English based on Google's Hindi translation. The publisher has this to say about the commentary in the last sentence on the first page of prakasakiyam.   

  

'The revered editor has compiled / edited this book (must be the commentary) after accumulating the scattered pearls from various books (may be the Yoga works of Yasovijaya Gani or Jaina texts on Yogasastra in general, it is not clear).'  

  

regards  
shankara
