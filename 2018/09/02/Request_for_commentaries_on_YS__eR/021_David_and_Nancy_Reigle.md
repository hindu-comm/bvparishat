Namaste Shankara ji,

  

The table of contents is not quite correct. The sampādakīyam is actually the prakāśakīya in Gujarati that starts two pages before the table of contents, on page number 3. The table of contents (anukrama) is on page number 5. Immediately after it on p. 6 is the samarpaṇam, and then on p. 7 is the ṛṇa-smaraṇam. Here the page numbers begin to match the ones stated in the table of contents. So the editor's yogasūtrapraveśikā (that I have called his introduction) does start on p. 8. I have scanned pp. 8-11, showing that he begins by describing the Yoga-darśana and the Sāṃkhya-darśana. This continues through p. 30, where he switches to the Jaina-yoga. I have scanned p. 30 through p. 39, where his introduction ends. Unless I have missed something here, which is entirely possible, he does not explain about his edition. If this is so, then our remaining hope is in the publisher's prakāśakīya in Gujarati.  

  

I request any BVP member who knows Gujarati to see if there is anything about the edition there in the prakāśakīya. These two pages are near the beginning of the scan that I sent yesterday. Thanks.

  

Best regards,
