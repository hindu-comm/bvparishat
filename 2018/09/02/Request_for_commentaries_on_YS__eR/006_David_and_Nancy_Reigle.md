Dear Dhaval Patel,

  

I just noticed that a commentary of some importance is missing in the list of 21 that you posted. It is of some importance because it is written by a Jaina commentator: Yaśovijaya. It was first edited by Sukhlalji, *Yogadarśana of Patañjali with Vṛtti by Yaśovijaya and Haribhadra's *Yogaviṃśikā**, Agra 1922. I have not seen this edition, so the bibliographic data is uncertain. I have only a 1991 reprint titled *Pātañjala Yogadarśana tathā Hāribhadrī Yogaviṃśikā.* I also have a 2001 edition of it by Vairāgyarativijaya simply titled *Pātañjalayogasūtr*ā*ṇi*, published by Pravachan Prakashan.  

  

Best regards,
