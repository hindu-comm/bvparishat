David ji,

  

Thanks for sharing the sample pages of 2001 edn. As you said, the editor's colophone makes use of the word 'sankalitaa'. So, there is a chance that he compiled it from Yasovijayagani's writings on Yogasastra.  

  

I am sure the editor would have clarified this in his 'sampadakiyam'. Is it in Gujarati? If you could share the 'sampadakiya' (might be immediately after the TOC), Gujarati knowing BVP members might help in understanding it.  

  

regards  
shankara
