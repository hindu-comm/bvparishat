David ji,  

  

Sukhlalji is very clear. He says that the Vritti of Yasovijayagani is only on 27 sutras. As I wrote earlier, he explains (page 1 of the preface) that the Vrittikara's intention was to show on which points Jain sastra disagrees with Sankhya darsana.

  

For instance, he comments only on 10 sutras in the first pada.

They are 2, 11, 16, 18, 19, 26, 33, 34, 46 & 49.

  

Could you please verify this with the 2001 edn?  

  

regards  
shankara
