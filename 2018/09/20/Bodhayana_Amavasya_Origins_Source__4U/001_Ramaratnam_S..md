Another question which is a corollary to the previous one. The ideal time for the Amavasya tarpana is between 11 a.m. and 12 noon. But in no Bodhayana amavasya day the amavasya tithi begins around this time. If at all it may begin around 5 p.m. When such is the case what is the rationale behind having Bodhayana amavasya at all?
