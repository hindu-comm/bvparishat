Dear Vidvans,

  

There is a version of the story behind the origin of Bodhayana amavasya in the Mahabharat where Sahadev gives Duryodhana the day of amavasya as the right muhurta for aja bali before starting the war.

  

Krishna plays a trick by forcing the deities of the Sun and Moon to come together one day before the date of actual amavasya.

  

Is there any reliable textual source in the Mahabharata that actually mentions this episode?

  

If so, please do share the textual source along with reference.

  

Thanks.

  

Venkat
