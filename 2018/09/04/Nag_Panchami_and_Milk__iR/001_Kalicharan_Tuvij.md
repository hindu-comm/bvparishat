Namaste.

Shastra-s contain the awareness that a near totality of its recipients - even while broadly aligned to sraddha - are not necessarily sharp with their intellects.  
OTOH, highly intelligent people are necessarily highly moral - since both morality and intelligence mean the same thing : the ability to take right decisions.  
So, do Shastra-s see all beings as equal?  
No. They prefer intelligence.  
And, for the rest - those aligned to Shraddha - they provide a path towards intelligence (euphemism: "awareness"). Now, this is unique to Indian traditions.  
Shabda has different levels of meanings integral to it. So- a majority of masses torture snakes in the context of nAga-pancamI - so what? Tradition has allowed this for the greater good. What it has not allowed is for the average minded - those "in the middle of nowhere" - to jump at the judgement on this tradition in its lowest common denominator.
