Namaste All,

  

I wanted to know if there are any shastric references to giving milk to termite mounds on Nag Panchami day.  

Modern science does not accept this. Snake charmers usually do not allow snakes to drink water for almost 2 months prior to Nag Panchami, then they are let out on Panchmi from their box . So anything watery they try to drink.

  

Any pointers on this are welcome . I have no answer to give to my students on this . It is quite paradoxical that people pour milk on termnte mounds and naga pratime but kill actual snakes at the first sight  

  

Regards  
Raghuram
