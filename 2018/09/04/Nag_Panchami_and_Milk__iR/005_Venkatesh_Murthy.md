Myth- Snakes drink milk.

Fact- Snakes cannot digest milk. They are lactose intolerant.

'In fact, reptiles can’t digest dairy products and even if they could, it’s unlikely cows would stand idly by whilst being milked. If dehydrated enough, snakes will drink milk, but if thirsty enough they will drink just about anything.'
