Dear list members

  

I am looking for the following book

  

J. S. Mishra (2004). Mahakumbh, the Greatest Show on Earth. Har-Anand Publications. ISBN 9788124109939.

  

The book is out of stock on Amazon India and Sapna Online. Searches on the website of Har-Anand Publications using ISBN and the title Mahakumbh returned no results. Perhaps the book is out of print.

  

I am happy to buy a copy if somebody knows where it is available or pay for a photocopy to be mailed to me if somebody owns it or has access to a library copy. If somebody has a digital copy, they may please share it off the list (the book is not out of copyright).

  

Thanks, Nityanand
