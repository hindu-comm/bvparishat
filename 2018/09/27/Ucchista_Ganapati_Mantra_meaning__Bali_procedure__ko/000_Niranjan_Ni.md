Dear List members:

  

I am positive I posted this yesterday, but for some reason it has not appeared yet.

  

Kindly forgive if a double posting appears.

  

Can the scholars give the meaning of the mantra of Ucchista Ganapati-:

  

हस्ति पिशाची लिखे स्वाहा  

  

I would appreciate comments from both scholars and practitioners.

  

Also books like Mantra Mahodadhi recommend a bali for this mantra after japa.

  

However, the process of Bali has not been explained.

Can some one also throw light on this?

  

Thanks,

  

Niranjan
