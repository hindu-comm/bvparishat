Prof. S Korada, Saadar PraNaam!

Many thanks on explanation of meanings of Vaak and Shabda. Here is my thinking. We have (1) Dvanyaatmaka Shabda and (2)VarNaatmaka Shabda.

Example of (1), sound of dripping water-tip.tip. Also door-bell ringing. It is sanketa.

Example of (2), any shabda of human language.

Here is my understanding. Shabda means sound pulse. Vaak means speech.

VarNaatmaka shabda may carry meaning and Dvanyaatmaka shabda may have Sanketa or may not have. It is noise.

Please note that VarNavaada has place in Sanskrit linguistics along with Sphotavaada. Internal beauty of Sanskrit resides in meanings of VarNaas and hence in shabdas. VyaakaraNa is external ornament. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
