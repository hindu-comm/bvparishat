Namaste,

  

Shri P. K. Gode was one of the most dedicated scholars that India has produced in the recent past. A volume of papers was published in his commemoration in 1960 (GoogleBooks link [here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zegvAAAAIAAJ&q=p+k+gode&dq=p+k+gode&hl=en&sa=X&ei=paqkUduqBYza8wSP7YG4AQ&redir_esc=y)). I request group members to share a pdf copy of the said volume if possible.

  

Thank you.
