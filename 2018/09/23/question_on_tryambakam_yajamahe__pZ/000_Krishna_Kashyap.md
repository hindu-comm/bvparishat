Namo vidvadbhyah:

  

I have a question on this mantra tryambakam yajamahe

  

I have seen this version posted by Prof Paturi:

**ॐ त्र्यं॑बकं यजामहे सु॒गन्धिं॑ पुष्टि॒वर्ध॑नम् ।****उ॒र्वा॒रु॒कमि॑व॒ बन्ध॑नान् मृ॒त्योर् मु॑क्षीय॒ माऽमृता॑त् ।**(RV 7.59.12)

  

However, I have heard that many people who chant, say it as  

  

मे मृ तात्

Which version is correct? or is it a yajurveda and rig veda difference?

  

Please clarify.
