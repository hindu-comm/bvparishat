Namaste,

  

I would like to make a humble suggestion here. It is not related to this particular post, but to all posts of this genre. The owners and moderators of BVP may ignore or consider this suggestion based on its merits.  

  

I feel that we need to show more respect towards copyright laws that protect the rights of authors and publishers. So, those who request for digital copies of copyrighted books, though they are not easily available in the market or even in their public libraries, should provide at least some background details.

  

1\. Whether they have looked for the book in book-shops and online book-selling sites.

2\. Whether they have looked in their University or public libraries for a copy of the book.

3\. If they have tried both the above options and failed, they may kindly explain for what purpose they need the book, whether it is for their academic research, or for personal study, etc.

  

Otherwise, it might create an impression that BVP doesn't take sufficient care to protect copyright laws of Sanskrit/Indology publishers and authors.  

  

regards  
shankara
