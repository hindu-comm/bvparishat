Thank you.

युगक्षय is an excellent and unique concept.

It is the next partसूर्य इवाभिवर्धतthat caught my attention.

अनावृष्टि could be linked to sun, but a direct reference to sun would exist.  

Please check the next page of the book if it proceeds.

  

The comparison is Hanuman shaping himself in size to withstand the weapons.

Hence I would think अभिवर्धत connects to size and not brightness or color.

  

It may be a difficult inquiry. Please check through your resources.

To me the statement is powerful and pithy.
