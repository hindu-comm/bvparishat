Dear Scholars,

Please enlightenme about the word "शतावरी". As I went through one scholar article where the meaning of "शतावरी" mentioned as possessing100 husbands. Is It True?

according to my knowledge, "शतावरी" means possessing 100 roots. Please guide me aboutसंधिविग्रह, a formation of a word "शतावरी" and its correct meaning.
