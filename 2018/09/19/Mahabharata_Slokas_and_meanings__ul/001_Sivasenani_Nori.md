English translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguly is available online (.<https://www.mahabharataonline.com/translation/>). It does not have the Sanskrit text, but it corresponds fairly closely with the edition commented by Nilakantha (also available online -<http://www.mahabharata-resources.org/>). Locating the exact chapter takes a bit of effort but once you do that, Ganguly's translation corresponds to the original sloka by sloka.

  

I use Ganguly's translation to search for a keyword (say Dharmavyadha) and then, getting the approximate location, go to Nilakantha's text and locate the desired verses fairly quickly.
