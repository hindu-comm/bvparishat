Namaste,

  

Rayamukuta's commentary on Amarakosa has been published from Calcutta Sanskrit college. I have not come across its digital copy on the internet. You may have to access it from University library or through inter-library loan.  

  

Of the other kosas in your list, only the Ajayakosa seems to have been published so far. Utpala & Rudra kosas are not even available in manuscript form, as per NCC.  

  

Ajayakosa is the same as Nanarthasangraha of Ajayapala and is available at

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.491316>

  

Rabahsakosa was reconstructed based on citations as part of Ph.D. thesis by R. Mahadevan. The whole thesis including the reconstructed text of Rabhasakosa is available at <http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/145373>

  

regards  
shankara
