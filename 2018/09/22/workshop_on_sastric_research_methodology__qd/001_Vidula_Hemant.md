Namaste Shri.Paturi ji

Myself Vidula from Pune. Currently I am pursuing PhD as well as working on my Fellowship research project. I have done my Masters in Indology and I am a Classical dancer as well.  
I genuinely feel that I should attend this course though I am not trained in Sanskrit. My core area of working is Art History also includes performing arts. Of course the research extensively refers Sanskrit sources. I would like to know whether my limited knowledge of Sanskrit will become a hurdle in understanding of the lectures mentioned in the course.

Your reply will be appreciated.

Thank you.
