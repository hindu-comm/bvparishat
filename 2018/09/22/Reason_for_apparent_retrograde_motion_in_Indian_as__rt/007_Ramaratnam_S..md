I raised a point regarding the Bodhayana amavasya. On reflecting for a while I thought of a possible answer myself. The tarpana is to be performed during the day between 11 a.m. and 12 noon. There is no question about it. But on which day? The answer is - on the day when the amavasya tithi is present sometime during the day time ( at least in the evening) and also in the night. After all amavasya is concerned with night. This is the concept behind Bodhayana amavasya and Bodhayana is correct. On the other amavasya day succeeding the bodhayana amavasya, there is amavasya tithi during the tarpana time (and therefore, this is also correct and justified) but not in the night. It will expire by evening itself.
