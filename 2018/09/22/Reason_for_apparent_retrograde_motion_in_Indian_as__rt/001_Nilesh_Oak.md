Dear Nityananda ji

  

A possible tangent (so be aware)

  

Mahabharata text uses the word 'vakra' however it appears (based on my 20+ years of work) that MBH does not refer to the phenomenon in the sense of 'retrograde' at all but rather oblique crossing of the planet across the ecliptic (at the points of nodes - nodeof that specific planet - i.e. the intersections of its orbit and the ecliptic).

  

On the other hand, the 'retrograde' motions themselves are defined in various ways. e.g. (1) In case of saturn/Jupiter as "the planets became stationary around a certain nakshatras space, while shining brightly (as are expected during retrograde) (2) Mars - becoming steady, traveling in non-normal direction (backwards) and shining brightly (as is expected during retrograde) (3) Venus - Making a parikrama (forming a loop) near a certain nakshatra.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nilesh Oak
