Dear list members  

  

Does any Indianastronomical texts explain the reason (as was understood then) behind apparent retrograde motion (वक्रगति) of planets? The Greeks (Apollonius, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy) used epicycles to explain the retrograde motion, did we have something similar?

  

Please note that I am not looking for the *astrological**implications* of retrograde motion (वक्रगति) but the *astronomical model* Indians had (if any) to explain it.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
