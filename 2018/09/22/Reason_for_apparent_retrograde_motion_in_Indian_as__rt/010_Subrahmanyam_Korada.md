नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Would not that be a pure illusion from the ground?

Since only relative distances between luminous objects

in the spherical sky dome is measured, there is no distance

factor.. Am I missing something?

                                 
----- Vidvan Bijoy Misra

  

Please try to understand one thing - just like any other शास्त्र , ज्योतिषम् is also a शास्त्रम् , i e compiled by

sages / ऋषिs , who , with their capacity called योगिप्रत्यक्षम् ।

  

You are right when you said - pure illusion from the ground - because it is not possible to find with

naked eyes .

If you believe in व्याकरणम् , योगानुशासनम् , आयुर्वेद etc. you believe in ज्योतिषम् also.

  

It is not possible to check the शब्दs that are there in 1130 branches of Veda (all are not available) and the

vast secular literature - but Panini compiled a व्याकरणम् for both वैदिक and लौकिक शब्दs . How did he do

such a marvelous deed which is not possible with naked eyes . Today one may not have such a

capacity but one cannot refuse to accept when others have exhibited the same some time ago and

the proof is available today.

  

There is सिद्धान्तस्कन्ध in ज्योतिषम् that deals with such aspects and one has to follow the procedure

prescribed therein .

  

Hari discusses this issue elaborately in ब्रह्मकाण्ड of वाक्यपदीयम् ।

  

The tradition sustained very high level criticism that has been there since time immemorial and so many people cannot be blind for so long .

  

Hope this will clarify your doubt .
