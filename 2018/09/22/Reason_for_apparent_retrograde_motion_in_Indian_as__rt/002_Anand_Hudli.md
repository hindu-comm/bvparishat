Dear Scholars,

  

Two corrections, due toमन्दोच्च and शीघ्रोच्च, are applied to arrive at the true celestial longitude of a planet. It was recognized that a planet slows down as it approaches a point calledमन्दोच्च (apogee) and that a planet speeds up as it approaches a point calledशीघ्रोच्च, a point where the planet is on the other side of the Sun or in conjunction with the Sun. Theसूर्यसिद्धन्त, in the second chapter, explains retrograde motion, वक्रगति as being effected by two divinities stationed at मन्दोच्च andशीघ्रोच्च, who pull the planet backward and forward. However, it was also recognized that as a planet's motion turns retrograde once its celestial longitude has considerably increased with respect to its conjunction point. In fact, theसूर्यसिद्धन्त mentions the start of retrograde motion when this difference in longitude, calledशीघ्रकेन्द्र, is 144 degrees for Budha (Mercury), 163 degrees for Shukra (Venus), 164 degrees for Kuja (Mars), etc.

  

It appears that the Aryabhatiya has settled for an epicycle based explanation, rather than that of divine beings pulling a planet.

  

Anand
