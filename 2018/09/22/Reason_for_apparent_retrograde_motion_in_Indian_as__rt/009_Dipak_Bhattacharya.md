Late Professor Vibhutibhushan Nyayacharya (1911-1988) of the Varanaseya Samskrita Visvavidyalaya had a paper on Kepler’s theory of planetary motion as viewed from the Indian astronomical and Navyanyaya point of view published around 1960 in the Our Heritage, Department of Post-Graduate Training and Research, Government Sans krit College, Calcutta. Professor Satyen Bose read it and gently questioned the applicability of Navyanyaya or Aristotlean logic in astronomy. Professor Gaurinath Sastri was present at the meeting. He asked if a logic became invalid because of its origin.
