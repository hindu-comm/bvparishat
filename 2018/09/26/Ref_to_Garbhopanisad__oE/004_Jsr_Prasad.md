When I was trying to look into the science of genetics in Ayurveda, I encountered this great text. It is realized that the text is full of philosophy and medical science. Most of the Ayurveda fundamentals, such as dhatus, panca-mahabhutas, rasas etc are seen, besides a major discussion on Embryology & Obstetrics. Emotions of embryo explained, could not be seen in biomedical literature. For instance , the following verse -

  

कललं त्वेकरात्रेण दशरात्रेण बुद्बुदम् ।

दशाहेन तु कर्कन्धूः पेश्यण्डं वा ततः परम् ।।

  

It explains the gradual development of *chetanaa-dhaatu*after entering the mother's womb. So, zygote --> bubble --> karkandhu (may be in the size of a jujube fruit) --> egg were the stages similar to the modern process considers. Bharadwaja's Vrikshayurveda refers to genesis of a seed in similar lines -  

  

आपो हि *कललं* भूत्वा य*त्पिण्ड*स्थनुकं भवेत् ।

तदेव व्यूहमानत्वात् *बीजत्व*मधिगच्छति ।।

  

*'यथा पिण्डे तथा ब्रह्माण्डे ।'*
