1\. After the ovulation, when copulated on odd days it the male baby born. If it is on even days, the female baby.

2\. शुक्रातिरेकेण पुमान्, शोणितातिरेकेण स्त्री ।

3\. When both Sukra and Sonita are in equal proportions, it is the eunuch that the embryo transforms to.

Hence, there are these three parameters in embryo acquiring biological gender.

  

Beyond all this, there is this profound concept 'karma,' exclusive to Indian philosophy, that governs anything; since Ayurveda centralizes about 'karma-purusha.' Purusha = kshetriya (male/female) so no confusion with regard to the Sanskrit term.
