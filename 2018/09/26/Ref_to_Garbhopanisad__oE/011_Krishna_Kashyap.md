Thanks a lot for this reference and bhashyas.

Can anyone tell me the english meanings for

घनः पेशी वर्तुल

  

Are they shapes which can be better explained. The sanskritterms are confusing.

  

Further, as per the Garbhopanishat and other texts, does it mean that depending on the portion of maternal and paternal genetic stuff, male, female and homosexual are born?

is homosexuality determined at birth by some genetic materials? As you know that nature versus nurture is a debate which is happening forever in this area. I would like to know the true textual view from Garbhopanishat. This is a separate thread in a way but very related to this same Upanishad.

  

Thanks.
