The सूत्रप्रणाली in Ayurveda samhitas is fourfold - 1. गुरुसूत्रम् 2. शिष्यसूत्रम् 3. प्रतिसंस्कर्तुसूत्रम् 4. एकीयसूत्रम् । Saarngadhara quotes: "कुमारस्य शिरः पूर्वम् अभिनिर्वर्तत इति कुमारशिराभरद्वाजः" (1.6). This statement belongs to the fourth type of Suutram. Probably, Prof. Kannan ji might want to refer to this. As we see from its description, it is the opinion of Bharadwaja, hence 'एकीय' only.
