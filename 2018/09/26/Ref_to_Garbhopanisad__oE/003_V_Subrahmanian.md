Namaste

  

There two 13th Century AD commentaries (in Sanskrit) for the Garbhopanishad by Shankarananda and Narayanashrama. They are available in a collection called 'Upanishadaam SamucchayaH' and can be downloaded. The commentators have cited a number of texts which might be useful for a researcher.
