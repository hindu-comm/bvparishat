Dear Prof. Bijoy ji,

  

Yes, Srimadbhagavatam 3rd Canto has quite interesting information, indeed, the sloka referred earlier, appears there. Unfortunately I could not find the text that I downloaded a couple of years back. May be श्री 'शङ्करः' (Shankara) शरणम् ।

  

Carakaacaarya speaks of this science in chapter महतीगर्भावक्रान्ति in शारीरस्थानम् and Susrtaacaarya 1,2,3,10 chapters in शारीरस्थानम् ।

May be Prof. Savita ji and other Ayurveda experts can add more to this.

  

Regards
