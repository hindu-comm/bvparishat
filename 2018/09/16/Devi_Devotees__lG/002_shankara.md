Namaste,

  

I have also been looking for such a book, but could not found any single books that fulfils the requirement.

  

'Bharat Ke Mahan Sadhak' by Pramathanath Bhattacharya in 11 parts translated into Hindi from Bengali, is similar to Bhaktavijaya. All the 66 saints whose stories are narrated in the book are not devotees of Devi, but there are many like Vamakshepa, Sriramakrishna, Lokanath Brahmachari, sadhak kamalakant, Ramaprasad and Swami Nigamanand.
