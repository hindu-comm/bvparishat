A few names that come to my mind:

  

1.Shankaracharya - Soundarya Lahari - His devotion to the Goddess finds sublime expression in the verses. The SL has several commentaries. There are many other works too address to Devi.

  

2\. Bhaskararaya Makhin - who wrote a commentary to the Lalita Sahasra Nama and authored some other works on Devi.

  

3\. Shyama Sastrigal - one of the 'composer trinity' consisting of Thyagaraja, Muthuswamy Dikshitar and Shyama Shastri. He was a great Devi Upasaka. His compositions have the stamp: shyamakrishnasodari gauri...

  

4\. Narayana Bhattatiri who authored the Narayaneeyam. He is said to have become a great Devi devotee and authored 'sripaada saptatih', a seventy verse outpouring on the greatness/beauty of Devi.
