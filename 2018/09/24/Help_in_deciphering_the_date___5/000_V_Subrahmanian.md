Namaste

  

Here is an image with a few verses. The last one speaks of a time when a particular author thrived:

  

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/ab4362afa57a6/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

I would like to know the period mentioned above in terms of the CE (Common Era).

  

There is yet another reference:

What is the 'kolamba-abda'? What period in CE does the above reference 602 kolamba-abda......aShTama kolamba shataabdi correspond to?

  

Help from scholars here is respectfully solicited.

  

Thanks and warm regards
