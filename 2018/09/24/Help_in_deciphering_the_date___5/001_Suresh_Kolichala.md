In South India, many Tamil-Malayalam inscriptions used kallm-andu or kolamba varsa, which is fixed to have started at 824 CE.

  

Here is an excerpt fromIndian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages, by Richard Salomon

Oxford University Press, 1998 (p. 190).
