Many thanks Sri Anand Viswanathan ji and Sundareswaran ji. My question stands answered by your clarifications.

  

The commentator of Sphotasiiddhi (of Mandana Misra), Sri Rishiputra Parameswaran (of Kerala) must have thrived between the 13 and 14 CE.
The second image that I had shared in my first post is about the period of Narayana Bhattathiri and that, as per Sri Sundareswaran's calculation corresponds to his correct, admitted, period: early 16 CE.
