Thanks for the image you have shared. I could make out that the Kollam 603, gives the AD 1400+ by adding 824 as suggested in the note.
However, I am unable to apply this formula to the other reference I shared, in the first image, last line. पञ्चम्यां च सहस्राब्द्यां पञ्चमे शतके कलौ \| Could you please help me arrive at the AD year from this specification?
