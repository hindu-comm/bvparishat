Namaste,

  

I have a great respect for Prof.SK Ramachandra Rao (usually addressed as SKR Ji). He is a great scholar, thinker, historian, painter, indologist

and what not !

  

There is a kannada book by him called "Tirupati Thimmappa" which was translated into Telugu.

  

However, got translated into english and can be purchased online. Here is the link:

I have studied the telugu book which is presented in a balanced way.

  

rgs,

sriram
