Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
At our gurukula we are planning to perform a drama on Tirupati  
Balaji's history lila. Thus I am looking for an authentic source  
describing this lila in such detail as to be able to perform a drama.  
  
I tried to search on internet, but surprisingly could not locate. I  
have already gone through Venkatachala-itihasa-mala and  
Venkatachala-mahatmyam. I did get something in Skanda Puran.  
  
Note: By authentic I mean even from recognized brahmanas or TTD temple itself.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
