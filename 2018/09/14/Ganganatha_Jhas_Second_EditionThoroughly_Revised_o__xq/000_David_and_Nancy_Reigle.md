To honor the intention of one of the greatest translators of darśana texts in modern times, Gangānātha Jhā, in a world where digital books have now come to be expected, I make the following inquiry. I am wondering if the “Second Edition—Thoroughly Revised” of Gangānātha Jhā’s translation, *The Yoga-Darshana, Comprising the Sūtras of Patañjali—with the Bhāṣya of Vyāsa*, published in 1934, is available digitally. The 1907 first edition is widely available, both digitally and in various reprints, but this does a disservice to Gangānātha Jhā. He regarded the first edition, translated by him in 1895, as the work of a mere neophyte, while his second thoroughly revised edition is the fruit of his mature scholarship.



He wrote in his 1907 Preface: “The translation now placed before the public was prepared so long ago as 1895; and the vicissitudes through which the manuscript has passed has made it absolutely impossible for it to undergo any revision. So what is presented here is the work of a mere neophyte in the mysteries of Sanskrit Philosophical translation; and the translator would therefore, at the very outset, offer his apologies to the reader, for his providing for him what he himself considers a rather poor fare.”



He wrote in his 1934 Preface: “This revised and entirely re-written translation is presented before the world of scholars, in liquidation of the fourth, and I hope, the last debt due from me. This is the last of my works which I myself regarded as imperfect; and it was therefore due to the scholarly world that it should be revised. . . . In this revised edition, I have made the work as good as it lay in my power to make it.”



I have already provided the second edition to Asian Humanities Press/Jain Publishing Company for a photographic reprint in 2002, still available, but am making this query for the sake of those who require digital books.

  

Best regards,
