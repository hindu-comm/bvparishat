Sri Reigle ji,

  

This information is quite significant to the Yoga field. Many, including me, didn't know that Ganganath Jha revised his yogasutra +vyasabhashya translation in 1934. Here, let me confess that I always found Jha's (earlier) translation rather inadequate.

  

The publisher Jain/Asian Humanities that you refer to has listed the book on Amazon India, but is retailing it at upwards of Rs 2000/-. Is there any other publisher who may perhaps use your material to bring out a more affordable edition? Or perhaps you could consider uploading your material on [archive.org](http://archive.org)?

  

Dr Gerald James Larson has brought out his own translation of the Yogasutra with Vyasa bhashya (Classical Samkhya and the Legacy of Yoga) this year. Brill's Indological published it first. MLBD is selling the 1000 page hardcover Indian version at Rs 3000/-. This is again high for Indians.I wrote to Larson and MLBD asking them to consider bringing out an affordable paperback. Dr Larson agreed with me. I hope MLBD will consider.  

  

While we are on the topic, an ancillary request for advice. It is known that many scholars have translated the yoga sutras and the vyasabhashya till date. Which one, in your opinion, is the best/most useful?  

  

best

Harsha
