Thanks to Prof. K.S. Kannan, Prof. Amba Kulkarni and Prof. Siva for your insightful responses.  

  

I have another question on similar lines:

  

Is there any technical definition of dharma-dharmi bhaava and guNa-guNii bhaava?

Are they distinct or synonymous? Could you cite an example to illustrate?

  

My underlying question is, should we have both as possible inter-concept relations or one of them is enough?

Thanks,

\- Sai.
