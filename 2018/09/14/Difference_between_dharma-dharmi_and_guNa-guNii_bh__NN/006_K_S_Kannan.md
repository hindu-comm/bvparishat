The issue needs to be resolved taking into account more factors

\- of how these "features" fare broadly,

in terms of actions (and reactions/interactions) they involve in.

  

To foresee issues is to forestall problems.

  

Issues of coplanarity/hierarchy (for handling inheritance properties)/

one is to one (or -many) mappings/set theoretical concepts of subsets/supersets/intersections etc.

may all arise sooner or later. The more the actual issues we come face to face with by and by,

the greater the clarity to label them in one way or the other arises.

  

Simple approaches that prove sufficient in early stages

betray their inadequacy as complexities and intricacies surface and burgeon;

retractions and reformulations perhaps become inevitable

in any budding scientific/mathematical treatment.

  

Seeing things may be easy,

but perceiving relationships among them requires insight.

  

Well was it asserted, in a different context, though, viz.

*yoginAm tu vis'es"o'yam*

***sambandhe sAvadhAnatA.***

Search for/coinage of, terms for the possible varied relationships should also help.

  

Sorry for being somewhat theoretical. But the conceptual treatment has perforce to evolve

via practical difficulties that one comes across or passes through.

Theory and practice have thus to go hand in hand.

In a way, you cannot cross the bridge till you actually have arrived at.
