Dear Sir,

  

When I refer dictionary, I come across roots , not having the class mentioned to which they belong. For instance the rootऋत्.

  

If I do not know the class (gana), then

1\. How can I form stem?

2\. How are the various tenses and moods formed?

  

Here is root from MW dictionary.
