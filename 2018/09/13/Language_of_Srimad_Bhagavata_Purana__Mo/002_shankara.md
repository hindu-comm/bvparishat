Bhattacharyaji,

  

The question is not merely about the single authorship of Puranas. When Charudeva Sastry compared the language & style of Bhagavata with other Puranas, he might have also had Mahabharata in his mind. He would have felt that the Bhagavata is not the composition of the sage Vyasa who authored Mahabharata.  

  

Is there any philological or similar other tool using which we can ascertain whether the same person wrote two kavya/puranas?

  

Bhagavata Bhasha Parichcheda is available at the link given below. Though Sastry mentions the authorship of Bhagavata in the preface, it is not the main theme of the book. It is a critique of the language of the Bhagavata.
