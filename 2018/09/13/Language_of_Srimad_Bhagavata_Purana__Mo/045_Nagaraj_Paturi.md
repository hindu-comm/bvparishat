Once, one Tamilian friend asked me my opinion on a theory that AtharvaNa Veda among the four Vedas was a contribution of Tamils. I said, " why atharvaNa Veda alone, all the four Vedas should be theorised to be composed by Tamils. This solves this whole Aryan-Dravidian problem."

  

The south Indian author of Bhaagavata puraaNa describes Yamuna river etc. as the backdrop of Krishna activities. Bhakti cults centred around Bhaagavata puraaNa are widespread in north India where the book composed by the south Indian Tamil author is held as sirOdhaarya by the pundit and the public alike. Thus bhaagavata puraaNa can be seen to be one of the prime contributors to national integration.
