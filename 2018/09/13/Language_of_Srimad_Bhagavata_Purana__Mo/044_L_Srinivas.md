I've heard of judging a book by its cover. But by the price of the used book - that too in the American market? I got my copy from OUP India for Rs 495/- just a few years back.

  

There's much data in his book which he worked over 16 years. He seems to be nearly the only person in recent times who has studied both the Divyaprabandham and the Bhagavata Purana, which is something that can not be said for any of the other dozen or so authors who have been cited in this thread. Unlike some people, he didnt seem to have seen red or felt it 'aśauca' to hear a non Sanskrit work being mentioned. He visited Chennai and studied it and commentaries thereof with traditional pundits, and worked on it for those long years. Evidently, he seems to have respected the Indian adage that 'vidvāneva vijanāti' etc.



  

Cheers,
