Pranams to all,

  

In the preface to 'Bhagavata Bhasha Pariccheda', Charudeva Sastry observes that 'the language of the Bhagavata differs widely from the other 17 Puranas which betray a community of language. The style too is markedly dissimilar. This is a stern reality which none dare deny'.

  

He also says, "Admittedly this Purana is not the composition of the sage Vyasa. Yet, it is the work of a scholar steeped in traditional learning and gifted with a high intellectual stamina..."

  

Is it possible for a poet write a kavya in a style totally different from all his other works?  

  

regards  
shankara
