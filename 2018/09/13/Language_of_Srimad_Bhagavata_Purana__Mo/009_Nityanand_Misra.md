Some context around this. I believe Charudeva Shastri was influenced by the Arya Samaja, whose position on *Shrimadbhagavata Purana* is well-known. Its founder Dayananda Sarasvati was known to attack the language and matter of the*Shrimadbhagavata Purana.* In the*Satyartha Prakasha*, he**ridicules the author of*Shrimadbhagavata Purana* (and other *Purana*-s also). I recall reading somewhere that he belaboured the point that कथितो वंशविस्तारो (10.1.1) is non-Paninian and shows the ignorance of the author of the work. I have not read Charudeva Shastri’s work, but the language seems to be polemic (e.g. सर्वथा स्तनन्धय इव लोहलः कविः).

  

Can the same poet or author write in two different styles? Definitely. One finds many stanzas with*dandaka*-style long *samasa*-s and highly Sanskritized language in the Vinayapatrika of Tulasidasa whose language and style are very different from those in the the Ramacharitamanasa. Are there similar usages in other Purana-s as Bhagavata? Possibly yes (I am not sure if Charudeva Shastri has compared Bhagavata with other Purana-s in this work). The traditional view is that Vyasa wrote the*Shrimadbhagavata Mahapurana* after writing all others.
