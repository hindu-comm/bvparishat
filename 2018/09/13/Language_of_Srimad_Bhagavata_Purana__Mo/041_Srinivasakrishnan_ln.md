Shankara

  

Since you started with Charudeva Shastri, you may want to look at yet another chapter by chapter linguistic study. Such a study is available.

  

Biswas, A S. Bhagavata Purana - A Linguistic Study*.*Dibrugarh, 1968. I remember seeing it sometime back on DLI or [archive.org](http://archive.org). I dont remember which.

  

The author does not seem to know Tamil so he cites linguistic sources and lexicons when he comments on some usage peculiarities. Hardy however explains some of Biswas' entries citing Tamil usage or by citing the Divya Prabandham itself.

  

Hope this helps,

  

Srini
