Sriniji,

  

I had also seen Biswas's book at [archive.org](http://archive.org). His work resembles that of Charudeva Sastry. I think both the scholars worked simultaneously, without being aware of the other's work.  

  

Biswas doesn't make any remarks regarding the authorship or the date of SB except in the preface, where he simply makes one statement about the probable date of SB - 'I venture to suggest that the composition of the Purana should be considerably antedated than the twelfth century AD usually assigned to it.'

  

As you wrote he is silent on the Tamil influences on the Bhagavata language.  

  

regards  
shankara
