SAdar praNAmamm,

I remember attending a discussion on the language of Srimad Bhagavatha.My sanskrit master quoted from Some works of Sri Ramanujacharya that the language was described as "saMAdhi bhAsha"by Acharya. That itself is the greatness of it and only those with "athyantha sradha" and "Asthikya budhi" could only get the purport of it becuase in the state of samAdhi the vaighari that comes out could be understood only by another in the same state and need not comply with the "primitive logic " of ordinary human beings.

How far this is acceptable is another aspect.

  

With praNAms

*Prof. Sivakumar*
