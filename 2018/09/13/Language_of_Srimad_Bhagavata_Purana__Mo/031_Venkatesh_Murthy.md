Namaste

  

We have heard two points here. One there are many grammatical mistakes in Bhagavata and Two it was composed by a grammarian Vopadeva. Both cannot be true. Why will a grammarian compose with so many mistakes? It may be realistic to think there was some ancient manuscript of Bhagavata and then some others from South India added text to it.

  

Moreover Amar Nath Ray thinks South Indians except Adi Sankara cannot write graceful Sanskrit. He is not correct. Appayya Dikshita wrote beautiful Sanskrit. Then Ray may say there are exceptions. It is not a convincing argument.
