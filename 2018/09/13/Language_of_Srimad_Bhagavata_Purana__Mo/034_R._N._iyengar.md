Dear Sri Shankara,

  

My two Paise of discussion:

  

Bhagavata basic version might have been very ancient. But is it necessary for us to contend that all 18 puraNas have been maintained
exactly in their original form very similar to the Vedic texts? After careful comparison of astronomical and geographical contents of some of the Purana texts concerning Krishna, I feel additions (perhaps deletions also) in the available versions can not be ruled out. Here I restrict my attention to the Bhagavata as compared with MB. Balarama in MB goes out during the war for 42 days only. In the Bahagavata he is said to have toured south India also crossing Vindhya, for one year. Pl see extracts from 10th book, Ch 78. One can certainly write in different styles, but why would the same author make contradictory statements? Is there any logical explanation (other than as later interpolation) for such dramatic changes?

kind regards

RN Iyengar
