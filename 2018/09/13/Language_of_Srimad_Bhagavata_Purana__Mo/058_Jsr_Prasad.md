Namaste.

  

While there are debates on which Bhagavatam is first, the Bhakti maarga seems to have no clash with the Jnana maarga. One of the most accomplished vaaggeyakaaras of South India, Sri Narayana Tirtha sings -

  

jaya jaya durge jita vairi varge viyadanilādi vicitra sarge

suṃdara tara caraṇāraviṃde sukhaparipālita lokabṛṃde

naṃda sunaṃdādi yogi vaṃdye *nārāyaṇa sodari* parānaṃde
