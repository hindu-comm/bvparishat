Murthy ji,

  

It is true that both theories cannot be true. Charudeva Sastri who wrote on the apaniniya prayogas and other grammatical defects in Bhagavata, did not say that Bhagavata was a composition of Bopadeva. So, there is no surpise there.  

  

Theory of Bopadeva's authorship of the Bhagavata is rejected by most scholars. In an article on the 'Date of Bhagavata', published in ABORI in 1933, BNK Sharma clearly states that 'the theory of Bopadeva's authorship doesn't need elaborate refutation since no scholar with any reputation to lose would now think of upholding such a view.'  

  

Regarding Amar Nath Ray's article, I can understand if you disagree with his connecting the stiffness of Sanskrit poetry with South India. But, that doesn't make his other points invalid.  

  

regards  
shankara
