Sri Shankara-ji,

  

Charudeva Sastri-ji is not alone in making such claims.

  

For the general and common features of modern accounts you might want to see

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#Modern_scholarship>

  

Modern scholarship dates its composition to between 500 CE to 1000 CE, but most likely between 800 and 1000 CE.^([\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-sheridanp6-17))A version of the text existed no later than 1030 CE, when it is mentioned by[al Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Rayhan_Biruni "Abu Rayhan Biruni")^([\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-sheridanp6-17))and quoted by[Abhinavagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinavagupta "Abhinavagupta"). The Bhagavata Purana abounds in references to verses of the[Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas"), the primary[Upanishads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads "Upanishads"), the[Brahma Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma_Sutra "Brahma Sutra")of[Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta "Vedanta")school of Hindu philosophy, and the Bhagavad Gita, suggesting that it was composed after these texts.^([\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Sheridan_10-49))The text contains more details of Krishna's biography than the 3rd- 4th-century*Harivamsha*and*Vishnu Purana*, and is therefore likely to have been composed after these texts, suggesting a chronological range of 500–1000 CE.^([\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-sheridanp6-17)[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Archaism-50))Within this range, scholars such as R. C. Hazra date it to the first half of the 6th century CE, Bryant as well as Gupta and Valpey citing epigraphical and archaeological evidence suggest much of the text could be from the 4th to 7th century,^([\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-51)[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-52))while most others place it in the post-[Alvar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvars "Alvars")period around the 9th century.^([\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-sheridanp6-17)[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Blackwell-53)[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-54))Parts of the text use an archaic[Vedic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_Sanskrit "Vedic Sanskrit")flavour of Sanskrit, which may either suggest that its authors sought to preserve or express reverence for the Vedic tradition, or that some text has an earlier origin.^([\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Sheridan_10-49))There are two flavors of Krishna stories, one of warrior prince and another of romantic lover, the former composed in more archaic Sanskrit and the later in a different linguistic style, suggesting that the texts may not have been composed by one author or over a short period, but rather grew over time as a compilation of accretions from different hands.^([\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Rocher_141-144-10)[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-55))

The Bhagavata Purana contains apparent references to the South Indian[Alvar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvars "Alvars")saints and it makes a*post factum*prophecy of the spread of Vishnu worship in[Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu "Tamil Nadu")country (BP XI.5.38–40);^([\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Sheridan_Intro-27)[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Archaism-50))these facts, along with its emphasis on "emotional Bhakti to Krishna" and the "[Advaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita "Advaita")philosophy of[Sankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara")", lead many scholars to trace its origins to South India.^([\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Kumar_Das_172-5))However,[J. A. B. van Buitenen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._B._van_Buitenen "J. A. B. van Buitenen")points out that 10th–11th CE South Indian Vaishnava theologians[Yamuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamunacharya "Yamunacharya")and[Ramanuja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanuja "Ramanuja")do not refer to Bhagavata Purana in their writings, and this anomaly needs to be explained before the geographical origins and dating are regarded as definitive.^([\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Sheridan_Intro-27)[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Archaism-50))

Since the 19th-century, most scholars believe that the Bhagavata Purana was written by a group of learned Brahmin ascetics, probably in South India, who were well versed in Vedic and ancient Indian literature and influenced by the[Alvars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvars "Alvars").^([\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-Sheridan11-56))Postmodern scholars have suggested alternate theories.^([\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana#cite_note-57))
