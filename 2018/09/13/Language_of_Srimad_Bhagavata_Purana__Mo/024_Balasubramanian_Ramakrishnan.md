Shankara-ji,

  

A long time back, when there was not even the mosaic browser in the scene yet, someone interviewed the now retired Professor George Hart of Berkeley by email and posted this (among other things) in the news-group soc.culture.tamil:

  

One of the most intriguing contributions of the Tamil area to Sanskrit  
is the Bhagavatapurana. It is pretty universally agreed that it was  
written by a Tamilian and that it is filled with motifs and themes from  
the Divyaprabandha and other Tamil literature. Its author also uses  
"Vedic" forms -- sometimes incorrectly! -- to try to make it sound old  
and hoary. This work has catalyzed Bhakti movements all over India and  
is, arguably, one of the most important works in the Sanskrit language.
  
An example of a Tamilism is the word avamocana, "inn." This occurs  
nowhere else in Sanskrit -- it is clearly a translation of Tamil viTuti.


  

For whatever that's worth, I am just presenting something I heard a long time back. I don't know if there is any detailed study of alleged Tamilisms.

  

There is also a tradition of arguments within the Indian scholastic tradition itself on which was the "original" bhAgavatam - the devI-bhAgavatam or the vaiShNava one. A book called durjana-mukha-chapeTikA apparently alleges that the devI is the original one and the vaiShNava one is a forgery and a work of the grammarian vopadeva. An answer to this was supposedly provided by the work durjana-mukha-padma-pAdukA, which was supposedly refuted again by durjana-mukha-mahAchapeTikA. This controversy is summarized quite well by Ludo Rocher in his book "The Puranas" in the History of Indian Literature Series. I have not read any of these polemical works myself.
