Bhatt ji,

  

Thanks for sharing your paper on Markandeya Purana. It is easy to understand when a scholar identifies certain part of a Purana as interpolation.  

  

In Charudeva Sastri's preface, the authorship of a Purana is questioned based on linguistic study pointing out the difference in language and style. This prompted me to post the query at BVP.  

  

regards  

shankara
