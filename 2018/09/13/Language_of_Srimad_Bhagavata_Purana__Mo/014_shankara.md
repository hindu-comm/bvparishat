Misraji,

  

Thank you for the kind response.  

  

It seems you are right. Charudeva Sastri's goal seems to be to prove that the Bhagavata is not the work of a Rishi. In twelve chapters of Bhagavata Bhasha Parichcheda, he examines more than 2500 verses from the Bhagavata and points out various flaws in them such as 'aprasiddha artha, klishtanvaya, apaaniniyaprayoga, durghata-samasa, chandobhangabhayad sabdavairupyam, anauchityam' etc.  

  

What could be the reason(s) for Vyasa's composition of Bhagavata in a different style and language?  

  

I would also like to know if someone has made a comparative study of the languages of the Bhagavata and other Puranas and Mahabharata.

  

  

regards  
shankara
