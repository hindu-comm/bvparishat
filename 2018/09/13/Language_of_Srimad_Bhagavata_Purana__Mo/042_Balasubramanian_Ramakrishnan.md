Shankara-ji,

  

Thanks. While I am not up to the mark in historical topics, quite frankly many studies on "place of origin" that I have seen are guess-work on top of other very shaky guess-work. I saw the other reference to Friedhelm Hardy's*Viraha Bhakti* which seemed to address the topic directly*.*An internet search tells me that this book is sold second hand for for a cool $350 or something. Another internet search led me to his wikepedia page where the results of one of Hardy's "research breakthroughs" is described as

  

After long studies in India, Fred Hardy came up with a theory as to the meaning of erotic sculptures, such as for example visible on the temples of[Khajuraho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khajuraho "Khajuraho"). The erotic sculptures are visible on may temple of the[South India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India "South India"), the main area of expertise of Hardy. This theory was first expressed to him by people in a temple's environs. Fred Hardy theorised that the erotic[sculptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculptures "Sculptures")on the outer walls of[Hindu temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temples "Hindu temples")are intended to keep away[demons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura "Asura")from the pure sanctuary of the shrines.

  

Hopefully his book is no where in the same level of Mount Kilimanjaro level "I pulled it from where the sun don't shine" garbage, but I think I am not going to be buying any book whose author has produced gems of wisdom like these, without going through it first :-).  

  

Ramakrishnan
