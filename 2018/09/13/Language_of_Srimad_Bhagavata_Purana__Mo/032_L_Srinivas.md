There are two other general studies you may want to look at:

  

1\. J A B Van Buitenen, *On the Archaism of the Bhagavata Purana*, available in SInger, Milton (ed.) *Krishna: Myths, Rites and Attitudes*. Honolulu, East-West Center Press. 1966. This article poses and seeks to answer the question: Why did the author or authors responsible for the final version of the Bhagavata want the book to sound Vedic?

2\. Also Appendix XII of Friedhelm Hardy's *Viraha Bhakti, The Early History of Krsna Devotion in South India,* contains a listing of parallel passages in the Bhagavata Purana and the Divya Prabandham. The book's divided into 6 parts, with the first 4 parts devoted to a study of the Divya Prabandham, the fifth to the Bhagavata Purana and the 6th to an evaluation. The thesis is that the Divya Prabandham reflects an emotional Krishna bhakti which seems to have inspired the Bhagavata Purana.

  

Hope this helps,
