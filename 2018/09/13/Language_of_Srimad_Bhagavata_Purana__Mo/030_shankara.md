Ramakrishnan ji,

  

I was at first surprised by George Hart's comment on Bhagavata's South Indian origin. But, when I started looking at journal articles on this subjects I found that several scholars had pointed to this possibility, starting with CV Vaidya in 1925. Most interesting is an article by Amar Nath Ray titled 'Domicile of the Author of the Bhagavata Purana' published in IHQ in 1932 in which he concludes that the author of the Bhagavata was from South India, Dravida Desa in particular. I am not aware if some scholar has challenged this view.  

  

PDF of the article by Amar Nath Ray is attached.
