Iyengar ji,

  

Thanks for your the reference regarding Balarama's pilgrimage. There is no doubt that all Puranas might contain interpolated passages and chapters. The author of 'Domicile of the author of the Bhagavata Purana' also cites this discrepancy in the description of Balarama's pilgrimage in the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata.  

  

regards  
shankara
