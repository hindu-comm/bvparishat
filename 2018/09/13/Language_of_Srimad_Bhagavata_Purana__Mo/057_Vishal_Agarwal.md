In fact the very first work of Swami Dayanand Saraswati was the tract 'Bhagavata khandanam' which is now available in a print form. In those days, the Swami was a Shivabhakta and accordingly in this work,he repudiates the Bhagavatam showing how it is opposed to the Mahabharata and other Puranas, and that the true Bhagavata is actually Devi Bhagavata. He distributed several copies of his tract at a Kumbh Mela in Haridwar; and represented the Shaivite group in a debate with the Vaishnavas in Jaipur (the Maharaja at that time became a Shivabhakta and paintings of him in the Jaipur City Palace show him wearing a lot of Rudraksha maalas). Subsequently of course, the Swami repudiated all the Puranas.

Misraji,

  

Thank you for the kind response.  

  

It seems you are right. Charudeva Sastri's goal seems to be to prove that the Bhagavata is not the work of a Rishi. In twelve chapters of Bhagavata Bhasha Parichcheda, he examines more than 2500 verses from the Bhagavata and points out various flaws in them such as 'aprasiddha artha, klishtanvaya, apaaniniyaprayoga, durghata-samasa, chandobhangabhayad sabdavairupyam, anauchityam' etc.  

  

What could be the reason(s) for Vyasa's composition of Bhagavata in a different style and language?  

  

I would also like to know if someone has made a comparative study of the languages of the Bhagavata and other Puranas and Mahabharata.

  

  

regards  
shankara

Some context around this. I believe Charudeva Shastri was influenced by the Arya Samaja, whose position on *Shrimadbhagavata Purana* is well-known. Its founder Dayananda Sarasvati was known to attack the language and matter of the*Shrimadbhagavata Purana.* In the*Satyartha Prakasha*, he**ridicules the author of*Shrimadbhagavata Purana* (and other *Purana*-s also). I recall reading somewhere that he belaboured the point that कथितो वंशविस्तारो (10.1.1) is non-Paninian and shows the ignorance of the author of the work. I have not read Charudeva Shastri’s work, but the language seems to be polemic (e.g. सर्वथा स्तनन्धय इव लोहलः कविः).

  

Can the same poet or author write in two different styles? Definitely. One finds many stanzas with*dandaka*-style long *samasa*-s and highly Sanskritized language in the Vinayapatrika of Tulasidasa whose language and style are very different from those in the the Ramacharitamanasa. Are there similar usages in other Purana-s as Bhagavata? Possibly yes (I am not sure if Charudeva Shastri has compared Bhagavata with other Purana-s in this work). The traditional view is that Vyasa wrote the*Shrimadbhagavata Mahapurana* after writing all others.
