A little late, but apropos of books and covers, perhaps you should the whole mail and also read the quote I provided from Wikipedia. Of course one quote does not a man make, but judging by the complete and utter stupidity in that quote, I expressed my fear of buying this book without at least flipping through it. Nothing to do with the price itself per se.

  

Again if he did come to these supremely dumb conclusions as described about temple architectures and these being lauded as one of his key works, I fear his other work is likely equally silly. Just my daytime job of being a probability theory using man coming into play here, when I consider my other such experiences with these kinds of scholars. White man goes to India, eats dosas and rice with his hand, perhaps wears a dhoti once in a while and is immediately lauded as an “expert”. I fear I have seen too many of these cases and am quite skeptical in my older age. Perhaps the editors in “The Mount road Mahavisnu” and other such organs will find these and professorships in western universities convincing, but not me. But I’ll certainly try to go through this book at some point of time, given that it is available inexpensive.
