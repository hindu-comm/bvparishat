Shankara ji

  

There are two views. Vyasa is verily the Avatara of Vishnu and what is not possible for him? So any difference in style is easily explicable.

  

Another view is that everything has to happen exactly as we know, the underlying assumption being that the only paradigm which is ever possible is that which can be explained by our current stage of knowledge. And often, in order to fit our theories. So notwithstanding the great variety in the language used by authors in our own lifetime (my grandfather wrote a variety of genres in a variety of registers, for instance), we have to force fit an interpretation on the past, evidence not being mandatory.
