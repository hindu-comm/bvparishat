Even the authorship of Shrimad-bhagavad-geeta ( a portion of Bhishma-parvan, the Mahabharatam ) is in dispute !!! Scholars have found out multipal authorship there even !!!!!

 Epics and Puranas are full of various interpolations. So, We have to find out linguistically different portions of the same. This is the real point of research / textual criticism.
