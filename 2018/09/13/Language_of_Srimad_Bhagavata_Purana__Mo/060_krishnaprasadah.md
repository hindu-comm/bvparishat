There are too many replies in this post. Nityananda Misrajis view is almost correct.  
  
The whole post is misleading. That's why  
I wanted to write here.  
  
A scholar wrote like this  

  
  
विद्वान् चारुदेवशास्त्री thinks that since he or people known to him (may be some from West) did not have the capacity to compile a text like that it is the same case with others also .  
  

Before commenting on this I want to write few points which should be known.  
  
Firstly the book is all about , to show the Bhagavatam is full of mistakes, written carelessly, and the mistake listed in the book is just a sample and author doesn't even know(sometime) the basic language vaagvyvaharad and Grammar. This is what CS does his Pratijnaa Vaak and shown in complete book.  
Secondly  
The thing is , Charudeva Sastry is a very humble scholar. He is highly fascinated about Grammar. He is highly amazed by earlier writers and had huge respect on each and every one. For instance he even crticise Deeksita but had great respect on him. This I have confirmed not only by reading his all books, but with his son whom Ive personally met 2 years back.  
  
The way CS adopted to criticize the Bhagavatam , is same as the one which is used by earlier writers. Also in his sabdapasabda viveka he says, he is least interested in personal attack.  
  
Keeping all this in mind,  
  
Bhaimi Vyaakya Kartr insisted Charudeva to write this book , which is to show the mistake in Bhagavatam after his research article has been published as a trailer in Visvesaranada Journal. In similar he shown that Kafvi Bhatti has misunderstood few of Panini Sutras.  
  
Having said that,  
  
There are 2 kinds of research one is a method used by Western Indologist as about date and author. CS is parama Sanatan , he is least interested or lost interest later in such a research.  
  
The secondr is Ours Traditional research as commentators were used. The same followed by CS.  
  
Then why did he speak about Author ?  
  
It is usual practice of a highly learned that , when he finds a fault in a book which is highly admired, he, with a humbleness , says, it is a prakshipta or a work written by some one else. (As we have seen in Kavyas like Megha etc, that the commentators say some times the verse is prakshipta etc)  
  
Among the 2 above option, the later, that is, choosing as ," written by some one else" is more convenient for CS.  
How do I know?  
This is known by any one who reads the book, by reading the adjectives given to Vyasa. He needed some independence to make fun out of Vyasa.  
  
Another possibility is CS words to be taken figuratively.  
  
His main intension here is that  
not to discuss about the author. Any learned scholar can understand his heart only by reading his complete book and not up to the preface.(But this book can be understood only by a real Scholar not by index panditaas or ctrl F Scholars) This is a mere expression of figurative sense or to show his scholarship as Cs himself says that to remain his name in scholarly world for so long. The main objective was to show the world that he felt Bhagavatam easy in opposing to h Vidyavataam Bhagavate pariksa.  
  
If he would have not spoken about the author, then he could have not make fun about the author, so he chose to say that is not Vyasa the author of Bhagavatakm , otherwise the whole joy of reader will be diminished.  
  
A scholar like Subramanya K should show that, the Bhagavatam is all correct with the language, and writing khanadana on above book, instead of commenting about Charudeva as he is incapable of writing such work. as this is to be taken to be academically and not personally.  
  
Who ever created this post should clearly understand that the intension here is figurative. If not, he would have proved in his book the author is not Vyasa.  
  
Any way why did he do such a saahasa on bhaglavan Vyasa?  
Already answered by N misra  
  
Last but not least  
Some of his critics in the book are , on ground that he doesn't accept other Kosas like Medini etc is just a nonsense. Other points are really challenging.
