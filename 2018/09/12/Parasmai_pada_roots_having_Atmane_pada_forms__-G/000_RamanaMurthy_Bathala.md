Dear Sir,

  

I have been going through grammar books for learning the basic.

I found Parasmai pada roots are given Atmane pada forms in the chapter on verbs.

My understanding is thatParasmai padaare not supposed to haveAtmane padaforms and vice versa.

  

For example the root जि ji, cl. 1, 'to conquer,' is mentioned as Parasmai pada.

The following is from MW grammar: it gives Atmanepada forms.

Can you please correct my understanding?
