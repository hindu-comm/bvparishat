Namaste,

The answer to the question of duplication of same root *ji* in same class have no relevance to its meaning. Let the meaning be post paninian, but that is also based on some path, which may be original or non-original.

Answer is simple. One is transitive and other is intransitive. With one 'path' both wouldn't be possible.
