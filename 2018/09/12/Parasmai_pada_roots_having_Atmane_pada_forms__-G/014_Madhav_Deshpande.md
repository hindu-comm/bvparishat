Dear BVK Sastry,

  

  Thanks for your thoughts regarding these questions. While you are quoting Max Muller's comments from 1899, more recent comprehensive comparisons of various transmissions of Dhātupāṭha by Palsule and Gaṇapāṭha by Kapil Dev Shastri give objective data on this question.
While multiple versions of these Pāṭhas have come down to us, we cannot be sure as to which of these versions historically goes back to Pāṇini himself. I hope you will take a look at these studies. With best regards,
