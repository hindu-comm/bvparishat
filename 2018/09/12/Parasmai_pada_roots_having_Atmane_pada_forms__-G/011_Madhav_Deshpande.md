Here we are hitting the ultimate gaps in our knowledge of the original dhātupāṭha of Pāṇini. As Palsule's work on comparison of multiple transmissions of dhātupāṭha shows, there is no complete unanimity among various recensions of the dhātupāṭha \[or of the gaṇapāṭha for that matter\]. Secondly, the question of whether Pāṇini's original dhātupāṭha had meaning entries, or the available meaning entries are authored by someone named Bhīmasena is also not entirely resolved. So all one can say is that according to a particular version of dhātupāṭha, there are two separate roots ji jaye and ji abhibhave, but, to my knowledge, we have no proof that such a distinction goes back to Pāṇini himself. This takes us back to Professor Saroja Bhate's question. If the meaning entries in the dhātupāṭha are post-Pāṇinian, how do we find out what Pāṇini intended? Only direct indications in the Sūtras of the Aṣṭādhyāyī can provide such help.
