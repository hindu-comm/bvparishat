Namaste Deshpande ji

  

1\. Your statement responding to Prof. Saroja Bhates observation opens up several clinkers related to 'Sanskrit Research: Modern and Traditional'. as Primary theme and secondary research built on 'faulty premise- faulty text and teaching -pedagogy' !

  

 Your clarity of thought and honesty in expression is worth contemplating: \< **Here we are hitting the ultimate gaps in our knowledge of the original dhātupāṭha of Pāṇini.** \> 

  

   Now, your observation triggers series of major challenges for 
Bharateeya 'vidwans / Shishta / Vijna's of Bharath' to answer several logical constructs and deconstructs using 'Sanskrit texts from archieves and print-publications, distanced away from voice tradition' ! In this deliberation, one needs to stay calm without getting in to emotional fits and battle: tantrums. ( Jijnyaasaa- Tarka - Vaada  in Shaastra is different from Vitandaa and jalpa by those who want to win a ' brownie point and a medal of award/ or insult other side).

  

**So the questions are** :

\- What should be the standard ' Dhatu Patha' that should be used to understand what ' Panini-Patanjali- Yaska' , which is tagged and marked  as ' 'Vedanga' ? 

-What are pre-Paninian 'Vedic Grammars' ? ( Quotes from Ashtaadhyayi indicates their existence; but does not tell the pedagogy)

\- How did they disappear just after Panini ? No survivors of ' those veanga vyakarana traditions, where as ' Pratishaakhyas and Shikshas survive ??

\- Did Panini honestly consolidate the 'Vedic Language Grammar'? and Patanjali commented on that for a holistic construction ?

\- Did the traditional acharyas from Shankara ( circa 600 A.D - upper limit) to Acharya Madhwa ( 14th century) - Sayana - Bhattoji and others use a common 

 'Dhatu Patha' or used their 'preferred versions' ?? What needs to be reference here ? WHY ??

  

   Here is Maxmullers observation on Sayana Madhava using his own Madhaveeya Dhatu Vrutti  for his commentary on 'Veda'!

[Max Mullers observation on Madhaveeya Dhatu Vrutti for Veda Bhashya](https://archive.org/stream/RgVedaSamhitaVolIv/RgVedaMuller_IV#page/n131/search/sringeri)  

  

     **The detailed implications of such ' preferred Dhatu Patha/ vrutti' are analyzed in the Notes of Prof. Max Muller with examples
and line of argument -'I have edited it (Sayanas Veda bhashya) as if I had to edit Plato or Aristotle'** : Explore link : 
\<[https://archive.org/stream/RgVedaSamhitaVolIv/RgVedaMuller_IV#page/n145/search/sringeri
)](https://archive.org/stream/RgVedaSamhitaVolIv/RgVedaMuller_IV#page/n145/search/sringeri)


  

  

     This is not just my question ! This question was articulated by Prof. Maxmuller in 1892 -  Preface to the Sayana Bhashya - Rigveda; making an observation on how the 'Rig-Veda' text and ' Sayana Bhashya' were edited by him, using the principles of ' Greek and Latin
Classical Pedagogy', And why he 'doubted the version and interpretations which were provided by the then ' resident scholar of Shringeri'. Maxmuller reiterates that he did overrule the traditional text of Sayana held as authority by Shringeri;

  

Till date, this issue remains unquestioned and unchallenged. Which in other words means : The Sayana commentary held as sacrosanct and being used today has many ' filtering's' introduced by Chief Editor: Max Muller in the year 1892. And the deliberation will be intricately, integrally, internally connected with the ' reference of Dhatu- Patha' versioned Text of Rig Veda ! ***Summary***: If Sayana had missed /messed Panini-Patanjali- Yaska, and Sringeri used ' preferred versions of Vyakarna and Dhatu Patha' , then the tradition got ' Original Vedas' differently than what might have been ' original Panini period understanding' ! This opens the a flood gate of issues and defenses .

  

The research involved is humungous ! and stares at the very integrity and identity of ' Acharya Sampradayas of All Vedanta flavors'! Which ever way it may go, the hard hit and causality will be the ' Brahminical Vedanta Acharya Traditions touting Panini Sanskrit Scholarship to interpret and defend Vedas - Vedantas and a Cultural derivative of it called ' Hinduism ' !

  

2\.  Coming to your next observation \< ..Secondly, **the question of whether Pāṇini's original dhātupāṭha had meaning entries, or the available meaning entries are authored by someone named Bhīmasena is also not entirely resolved. So all one can say is that according to a particular version of dhātupāṭha, there are two separate roots** ji jaye and ji abhibhave \> .

  

   If , as traditional ' prAmANika's / ShishTa's  believe and hold, the ' Dhatu-patha / gana-pATha/ Dhatu Vrutti/ ' is to be the
foundation of ' 'VERB FORMATION OF WORDS' in Samskruth (and several other secondary nouns and other forms of words - Krut- Taddhita -Samaasaascha praatipadikaaha ; kvachit avyayani cha) is a ' DOUBTED DATA' , and a ' VARIBLE INPUT OF CONVENIENCE by the TEXT VERSION' preferred by the ' Academic Researcher', 

 AND

  This doubt of ' Text- Authenticity/ Corruption / Correction'
stretches over the vast historic time duration between ' Panini (circa 700 BCE) to a later writer 'Bhimasenacharya' ;

  

 ***THEN the logical corollary of this would be a series of valid doubts*** : like:

- 'WHAT WAS STANDARD SAMSKRUTH TEACHING -LEARNING- AUDITING pedagogy' by which masters who composed works on various Shaastras and commented on earlier works' stood by ?

\- What was Teaching of ' Samskruth' as 'Shaastra Bhashaa' at institutions like Nalanda …  all the way to Benares ? over a historic time line of a millennia at the minimum ?!

\- What was the ' linguistic connection of ' Prakruth's / Tamils to ' the ' Pedagogy of Samskrutham/ Bhashaa - Vyakarana aspect' which writers like Hemachandra adapted ?

\- What was the ' model of Samskrutham/ Bhashaa' to which volumes of compositions in Puranas, logical hair splitting arguments on 'Vibhaktyartha - Shaabda bodha ( Navya Nyaya especially from Gangesha and others) - Sphota vaada' et al; were built ? How did KAshikaa system and Bhattoji's Kaumudi prakriyaa system address the referential models of ' Dhatu/ Gana PAtha' for classical language and more critically for ' Veda / Upanishad Vyakhyanam'?

\- What would be the status of 'Sanskrit Dictionaries' like Shabda Kalpadruma and others ?? A confused mumbo jumbo using preferred derivation using roots of convenience ??

\- And Friends in Sanskrit Computtional Linguistics generating' Online - On the fly' Samskruth Verb forms - What is the base of ' DATA and RULES OF PROCESS' to ' ANALYZE THE PRAKRUTI DHATU- PRATYAYA- DHATU GANA' ? A DATA BASE OF Multiple entries and convenience of reference?

  

**In short, it puts the entire ' scholarship and pedagogy of Bharateeya Vidwat paramparaa Granthas' on a pedestal of' DOUBTFUL LANGUAGE PEDAGOGY'.**

  

This fact, was articulated even by insider traditionalists, as a ' matter of personal opinion / call it as a ego claim amongst' Pandits and Shastri's to argue out that ' I know more, better and secret issues than you !' The talk is ' Doubting the rule structure of ' Ashtaadhyaayi' itself, on the point of ' True Total Text Inheritance, Completely and authentically' as a  voiced / scripted tradition ! One such debate , unresolved has been : Did 'Ashtaadhyaayi have a 'Sa-Svara' paatha ?
If so, who knows it? IF not, is our learning of 'Vyakarna' down graded to that extent ?? For example: The last sutra of Ashtaadhyaayi (8-4-68)
speaks of two ' a' -s; Samvrutha and Vivrutha.; But does it cover the
udaata -anudaata -et al ? Which svara is on the first 'a' and which on second 'a' ? Obviously a meticulous mind like Panin-Patanjali- Kaiyyata- Bhattoji can not have brushed off this issue ? Does Maheswara sutra/ Pratishaakhya listing of 'Samskrutha varnamaala' carry 'Svara accents' ?? as Shikshaa shastra would suggest ??

  

The dangerous consequences of such ' insider - pedagogic questions , lurking around, free floating from the Schoalrs, distancing 'Samskrutham studies ' from ' VEDANGA' status and ' YOGA' pedestal, and still
remaining unanswered can be imagined by the learned. 

  

 ***IF*** 'Sanskrit grammar' ( Vyakarana) as the root anchor and shield of ' language of sacred texts of tradition (Called Vedas)' remains a free for all by academic license of freedom, stripped off from the ' Vedanga' attribute, a critical test criterion, pushed forward for socio-cultural convenience as a ' historic classical language of religion, to be promoted for street conversation use'

***THEN*** 

any and all interpretations of texts of past to construct fancy history are ' valid '

***BECAUSE*** 

there will always be ' some recension of Dhatu-Patha' and ' Some stretch of rule from Panini' to provide the fig leaf cover ! for the proposed theories..

  

  

3. The question raised by you \<but, to my knowledge, **we have no proof that such a distinction goes back to Pāṇini himself.** This takes us back to Professor Saroja Bhate's question. **If the meaning entries in the dhātupāṭha are post-Pāṇinian, how do we find out what Pāṇini intended?** Only direct indications in the Sūtras of the Aṣṭādhyāyī can provide such help. \>

  

 This precisely is the ' DOUBT Planted' in the Research Scholars mind ( By Colonial and Oriental Seekers of Knowledge) . The antiquity of university debate on this goes to 17 th century. The construct was ' Sanskrit modelled as language of ' Hindu Religion, the religion of migrating Nomads'  and using the ' Gods Revelation of Scriptures (Tower of Babel) model to study 'Vedas' and ' Language of Vedas' .

  

 Traditional Scholars have plausibly only one answer to such ' Vedic Language related academic engagements: \< Paramparaa = Unbroken Oral Tradition>  which rests on the hypothesis \< My Teacher Taught me Truly, Totally, Perfectly : मम आचार्यः सर्वज्ञः सत्यसंधः धर्मकामः अवतार-विशेषः …; शास्त्रमिदं सनातनं अविच्छिन्न=परम्परया रक्षितं …तपसा दृष्टं  etc;>

  

 The evidence of any kind of manuscript will not survive on an upper limit of one thousand year maximum; and is subject to Script evolution, conventions of script dynamics ( भारतीय -भाषाणां लिपिशास्त्र पद्धतिः) .
The vulnerability of depending on the Voiced tradition is well known. This is where the archeology evidence and script reading, dating the evidence of archeological evidence is held as forte of ' Western Academia's theories on Veda- Samskrutham- to ride over tradition'.

  

This leads to the shift in debate of Time line measure by evidenced history and archeology (carbon dating , mythology, and latest being the DNA studies !)  

If the traditionalists ' Yuga Cycle concept' can not beat over the scale of ' God Created the earth, for which the date of around 4000 BCE becomes Sacrosanct and ' Darwin's evolution theory over powers the ' Srushti Theories of Traditional texts' , with established evidence, the debate will be a loosing game.

  



  

4\. **Here below is what Prof. MAxmuller said about Panini in 1899. This can be a reference point to revisit and see: Have we inherited Truly and Totally, integrally and interconnected - the ' Six Vedanga based study and use of Vedas' ? The clarity on 'Dhatu Patha' will be a key issue to resolve this question. **
