Dear Rohan Ji,

  

  If you think for a moment, any transitive verb can also be used intransitively, if so desired by the speakers. Even for a common verb like खादति, the passive form खाद्यते can be used intransitively in भावे प्रयोग like बालै: खाद्यते. Similarly, one can have an intransitive बाला: खादन्ति and transitive बाला: फलानि खादन्ति. So, I do not see any absolute necessity to list two separate verbs जि/जि to allow transitive and intransitive usages. Perhaps, there is some other explanation that eludes us. With best wishes,
