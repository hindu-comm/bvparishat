I don't know the source of MW. However, you should check Whitney's book on Sanskrit Roots and Verb Forms, where he gives particular details of where the forms occur, such as Vedic or Epic Sanskrit. Whitney's description is not based on the prescriptive rules of Pāṇini, but on his observation of the occurrence of forms in Vedic, Epic and other Sanskrit literatures known to him. Many of these forms will be considered ārṣa in the traditional Sanskrit grammar.
