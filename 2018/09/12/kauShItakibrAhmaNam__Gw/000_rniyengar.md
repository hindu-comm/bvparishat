Dear Scholars,

  

Is a critical edition ofकौषीतकिब्राह्मणम् (not the Upanishad of that name) available? I am aware of the text edited by Lindner in 1887 or so. As per www. [vedicheritage.gov.in](http://vedicheritage.gov.in) (IGNCA) this text is equated with the शांखायनब्राह्मणम् of Anandashram series. Is this understanding correct? What is the basis for GoI to take texts with different titles to be one and the same? Is this equation attested by the traditional commentators and followers of Rgveda in India? I remember to have read somewhere that the कौषीतकिब्राह्मणम् has a commentary by Vinayaka Bhatta. Is this information correct and if so are there any online links for further details including manuscripts?

C. V Vaidya refers to the text in his History, but does not get into critical comparison. Thanks in advance...

  

RN Iyengar
