Iyengarji,

  

According to Ganga Sagar Rai & Jan Gonda Kaushitaki Brahmana is also known as Sankhayana Brahmana. Giving below link to the relevant page in Jan Gonda's Vedic Literature.

In the absence of critical edition, you may find Sreekrishna Sharma's edition of Kaushitaki Brahmana with Vyakhya of Vijaya helpful. It was edited on the basis of 8 manuscripts.
