Kaushitaki - The above name can be seen here:

  

<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/kst>

  

In the group of Upanishads published under the name 'उपनिषदां समुच्चयः' by Anandashram 1895, we have this Upanishad with the name 'कौषीतक्युपनिषत्'

  

The content of both the documents mentioned above is the same.
