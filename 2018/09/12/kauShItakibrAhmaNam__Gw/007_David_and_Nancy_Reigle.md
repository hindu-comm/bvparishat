It seems that E. R. Sreekrishna Sarma's careful edition of the Kauṣītaki-brāhmaṇa is not available on the web, or else Shankara-ji would have found it. It was published in 1968 by Franz Steiner Verlag, and is no longer listed on their website, so is apparently out of print. I have therefore scanned it and posted it here: <http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Hindu%20Texts/kausitaki-brahmana_1968.pdf>  

  

While at it, I have also added a few other Brāhmaṇa texts.  

  

For the various editions of the Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas published until about 1935, an extremely helpful guide is the Introduction by Viśva-bandhu to his *Vaidika-padānukramakoṣa or A Vedic Word-concordance*, vol. II, The Brāhmaṇas and the Āraṇyakas, part I, published in 1935, with a few additions in part II, published in 1936. This was the first volume published (vol. I, part 1, Saṁhitās, was published in 1942). So, for example, he says about the 1911 Ānandāśrama Sanskrit Series edition of the Śāṅkhāyana-brāhmaṇa: "a hopeless production, being full of textual errors and typographical oversights" (p. xix). All of these helpful comments were deleted in the "enlarged and revised second edition," published in 1973.
