Dear group members,

  

This sutra may put your doubt to rest:

  

तस्मिञ्छुक्ले याजुषाम्नाये माध्यन्दिनीयके मन्त्रे स्वरप्रक्रिया ।

This sutra makes these sutras specific to Shukla Yajurveda (so excludes other vedas including Krishna Yajurveda), to Madhyandin Shakha (so excludes Kanva Shakha or any other Shakhas of Shukla Yajurveda), to mantra (so excludes Brahmana).

  

The sutras are available at

<http://vedicreserve.mum.edu/shiksha/pratijna_sutram.pdf>  

  

but without any commentary.

  

  

regards,

Prakash
