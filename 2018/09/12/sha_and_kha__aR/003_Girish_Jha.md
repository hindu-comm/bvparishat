Dear Dr Vaasukeya  
For long I had heard the sutra"shah khas tum rite"as an excerpt of  
Shuklayajuh Pratisakhya but it is not found in the Vajasaneyi  
Pratisakhya edited by Mr Venkata Ram Sharma.Still I could find out the  
different source of it.It is mentioned in the Laghu Madhyandiniya  
Shiksha( 2)\[ Shiksha-samgrah-Sanskrit Univ.,Varanasi\] :  
"shakaarasya khakaarah syaat tuk yoge tu na bhavet".  
And also in the Keshavi Shiksha( 3)\[ Shiksha-samgrah - ibid. as:  
"shah khas tumrite ca".  
These said two excerpts have been quoted by many modern scholars.It is  
noteworthy that it is in practice during the recitation of  
Shuklayajurveda all over India.As many scholars repeatedly told long  
back it indicates there must have been a different reading edition of  
Shukla yajurveda/Vajasaneyi Pratisakhya which could not be available  
to me at present.It is also worth noting that it was practised only in  
Madhyandina Shakha.
