Namo Vidvadbhyaha

  

In Aruna Prasna of Yajur Veda in one place they say 'Apakraamata Garbhinyaha' and after some Mantras they say 'Yathaasthaanam Garbhinyaha'. Pregnant ladies must leave that place and come back after some mantras are finished. It means except some mantras causing miscarriage the pregnant ladies can listen to other Veda Mantras. I think if they are allowed to listen to Veda Mantras they are allowed in Yajnas also.
