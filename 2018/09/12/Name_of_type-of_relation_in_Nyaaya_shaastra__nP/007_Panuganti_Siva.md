Namaste,

  

In my opinion, the 'type-of' will be 'varga-upavarga bhava' possible in Sanskrit.

  

For instance we can observe such varga usage in Amarakosha and ayurveda lexicons.

  

Similarly, in Rasashastra (Indian Alchemy) the minerals are classified as rasa, upa-rasa, dhatu, upa-dhatu, ratna, upa-rasa etc.

  

This way, the 'type-of' relation can be addressed thru varga-upavarga bhava in Sanskrit.

  

Thanks

Siva
