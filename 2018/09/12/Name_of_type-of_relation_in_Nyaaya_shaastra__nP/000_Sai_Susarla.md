namo namaH,

In nyaaya (or any Indian shaastra), what is the "type of" relationship called?

  

For instance, what is the name of the relation between dravya and padaartha in  

"dravya is a type of padaartha",  

"aamra-vrkSha is a type of vrkSha"

  

In the same breath, if you could also let us know the following, it'd be even better:

instance-of => ???  

part-of => anga-angI bhaava?

  

Any quick response would be greatly appreciated, as we are stuck.

Thanks,

\- Sai.
