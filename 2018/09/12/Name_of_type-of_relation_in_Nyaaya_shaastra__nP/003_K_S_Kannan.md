We may have

***X = Y-abhidhAnakaH***

where

*Y = abhidhAna*, and

*X = abhidhAnin.*

*  
*

The "=" sign must be properly defined, of course.

*  
*

Will this help?

  

Sorry if I am wrong. I am writing from Chicago.

I woke up in the midst of my sleep due to jet lag and am writing

trying to induce sleep thereby.
