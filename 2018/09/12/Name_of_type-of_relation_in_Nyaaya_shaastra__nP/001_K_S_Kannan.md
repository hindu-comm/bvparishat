Typical sentence structure is as in:

*AmraH vRks"a**-vis'es"aH.***

*sim'haH prANi****-vis'es"aH****.*

*  
*

So, addition of**the expression *vis'es"a*

with a preceding hyphen

conveys the idea.

  

The structure could be generalised in BNF

(Backus-Naur Form, or more accurately PBF (=Panini-Backus Form))

\<*vyaktiH*\> \<*sAmAnya*\>**-** ***vis'es"aH****.*
