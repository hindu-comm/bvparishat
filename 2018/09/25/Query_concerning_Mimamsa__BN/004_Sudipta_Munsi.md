Dear Prof. Subrahmanyam,

  

Many thanks for being explicit about your source. I agree, the Mahaprabhulala Gosvami edition is full of misprints. This really calls for the preparation of a good improved text of the Mimamsadarsana along with its commentary and subcommentaries.

  

Thanks also for quoting the verse beginning with mahoksam va mahajam va in its entirety from the Yajnavalkyasmrti.

  

I will email you the volume of Mimamsakosa later today.

  

Please don't address me as Prof. Sudipta, because I am not a professor anywhere.

  

Best regards,

  

Sudipta Munsi
