Dear Prof. Subrahmanyam,

  

Thanks a lot for your fairly elaborate explanation.

  

The reading of the text that you quote is:सूर्याविदेव धूमवस्त्रं दद्यात्. However, the reading given in the 5th volume of the Mimamsakosa of Svami Kevalananda Sarasvati (p. 2970) is: सूर्याविदे वधूवस्त्रं दद्यात्। Could you kindly mention the edition or source that gives your reading? Could you also kindly mention in which part of India is / was the acara that had been blocked prevalent?

  

Regarding the source of the verse 'mahoksam va mahajam va': According to Essays in Classical and Modern Hindu Law, by John Duncan Martin Derrett, Vol. 1, p. 47, Sulapani, much in tune with Vijnanesvara, mention its as coming from the Vasistha Smrti IV.8. So it is in fact a verse from the Yajnavalkyasmrti. The Myth of the Holy Cow by D. N. Jha (p. 125) presents it as a quotation by R. L. Mitra in Indo-Aryans from a much later text called the Nirnayasindhu.  
  
Many thanks once again.

  
Best regards,

Sudipta Munsi
