Respected Gurujis and scholars,

  

I wish to know theअनूचानपरम्परा in detail. I have gone through the motto of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan which reads यो‌‌नूचान: स नो महान् । This

motto is an excerpt from a sloka of the shalyaparva in the Mahabharata.  

  

I humbly request all the Guruji and Scholars to throw some light on it.

  

Thanking you all.

  

With humble Pranams

G Surya Prasad
