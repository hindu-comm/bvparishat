We are delighted to inform you that Amrita Darshanam — International Centre for Spiritual Studies, in association with*Nārivāda*, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA),is organizing a three-day national workshop on“**Śakti Worship in India**” from September 21to 23, 2018 at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, Kerala.  

More than 25 scholars of renown will deliver invited lectures on the different aspects of*śakti*worship in India.During the course of the seminar,**two traditional rituals will be performed**:***Paḍayani*and*Kalamezhuthu Pattu*.**

[***Paḍayani*****](https://youtu.be/j9bmg1u3cDc)is amasked performance of an ancient ritual performedto appease the fierce Bhadrakāli after she kills Dāruka. According to the legend, it was first performed by Śiva’s*bhūtagaṇa*-s in order to pacify her anger which could, otherwise, destroy the worlds. It is unique to central Kerala — particularly popular in the districts of Kottayam and Pathanamthitta.

It will be elaborately performed in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, on **21 September 2018** by traditional artists (Making of*kollams*(masks) will be done throughout the day. Performance starts late evening, and will continue into the wee hours of the morning)

***Kalamezhuthu*** is a temple art of drawing very large pictures (*kalam*) on the floor as part of temple rituals (usually associated with *devi*, *nāga* or *sastha*) in Kerala. It has three stages — (a) drawing of the *kalam*, (b) worshiping of the *kalam* with lights called *thiri uzhichil*, and (c) erasing of the *kalam* *maykkal*.



It will performed in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, on 23September 2018 (Drawing of *kalam* will start in the evening; ritual will commence in the morning, and be completed in 12 hours)
