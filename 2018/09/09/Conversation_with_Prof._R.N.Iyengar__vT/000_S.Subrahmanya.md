Please watch this conversation with Prof. R.N.Iyengar.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeaXs1O9qGw>  

  

He covers a range of topics from dating the vedas, ancient indian astronomy, earthquakes, to ancient indian engineering.

You will definitely find this very interesting and illuminating.

Prof Iyengar is an incredible scholar and it is, of course, a great privilege to have him on this list.

  

Regards

S.Subrahmanya.
