Today being Teachers' Day, I was looking for the source citation for the popular Guru mantra, "गुरुर्ब्रह्मा गुरुर्विष्णुः गुरुर्देवो महेश्वरः । गुरुः साक्षात् परं ब्रह्म तस्मै श्रीगुरवे नमः ॥"

Found this: "A selection from 'Guru Gita' as given in Uttarakhand section of 'Skanda Purana' in the form of a dialogue between Shiva and Uma (Shakti)" (<http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1983/gjuly83/stotram.shtml>).

Is this the authentic source of the sloka?
