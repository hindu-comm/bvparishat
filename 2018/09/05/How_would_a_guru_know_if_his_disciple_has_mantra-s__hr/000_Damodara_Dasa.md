\|\|Hare Krishna\|\|  
  
In Jayākhyā Saṁhitā (Nārada-pañcarātra) 17.46 it is said:  
mantrasiddhistu vai tasya vijñātā guruṇā yadā \|  
guruṇā vai so 'bhiṣiktaḥ tataḥ śiṣyaḥ prasādataḥ \|\|  
  
Here onwards the chapter describes procedure of abhiṣeka to officially  
appoint his disciple to become guru. Thus to whom to select for  
abhiṣeka is described by the symptom of mantra-siddhi.  
  
So it seems that there are symptoms of one who has attained  
mantra-siddhi and thus guru is able to know such a disciple. I would  
like to know what are those symptoms, if anyone has any idea of it or  
have read such things.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
