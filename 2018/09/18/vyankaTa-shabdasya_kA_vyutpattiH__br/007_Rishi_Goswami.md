Namo Namah Abhyankarji Mahodaya.  
  
This was a very satisfactory speculation, but in the last one, I still have a doubt.  
  
I understand the para-savarNa, but what does अन् mean? Or from which dhatu has it (अन्) been formed?  
  
-----  
  
Can we use this etymology? वि+अञ्च्+कट?  
  
I'm thinking of another possibility.  
  
----  
  
अमु रोगे is a धातु, from which on doing क्विप् we can form अम् as a word. By Lakshana this can become vaachak of Duhkha, peeda, paapa etc.  
  
-----------  
  
And this I quote Apte dictionary also:  
अम् \[am\], ind.  
  
Quickly.  
  
A little. cf. also अं सुखं कश्मलं दुःखं पूर्णं दूरं गतं वरम्  
  
---------  
  
  
Vi+am would mean vishesham paapam/duhkham/peedaam vaa katati/hanti sah vyankatah . Sashchasau eeshah vyankateshah. Or this mountain also can be remover of pains, and it's lord is vyankatesha.  
  
Vyam+kat+अच्=vyankatah. This could be a possibility?  
  
------------  
  
Like the one in the Brahma Purana, as Vem means Amrita or Indira, let's consider it as an Avutpanna Pratipadika, and try this:- वेम् (अमृतम् इन्दिरां वा) कटति आवृणोति इति वेङ्कट: पर्वतः। तस्येश: वेङ्कटेश:।  
  
Can this be possible?  
  
Thank you.
