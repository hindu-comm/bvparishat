This is the fun about names.

  

After a certain period of usage, their etymological meaning or word origin looses significance.

  

Only the connotative meaning remains valid and holds value.

  

-------------------

  

With regard to naama (name) s of the devataa whose naamajapa or naamasankeertana is considered to have a spiritual efficacy, there are two kinds of naamas:

  

1\. naamas are guNa-descriptions : Etymology matters here

  

2\. naama is secondary the tattva/the deity indicated by the naama is primary: Etymology does not matter here

  

Venkates'vara Venkatanaatha etc. fall under #2 above.
