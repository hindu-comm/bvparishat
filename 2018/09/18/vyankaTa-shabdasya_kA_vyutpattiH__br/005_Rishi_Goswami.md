By manually searchng, i found a thread "the origin of the name balaji for the lord of tirupati" posted by Shri V Subramanian Mahodaya.

I went through the entire post and was very delighted to have a conclusion for the word Balaji, as a master (vallabha), a beloved (vallabha) or even a child, for his marriage with Devi Padmavati (aka Vedavati in previous birth) was organized by Shreenivas's mother-figure Bakula Devi (aka Yashoda in previous birth) as the legend goes. I'm not sure aboit authenticity in Puranas etc, but the story is which I've heard, so for Bakula Devi, Shreenivasa was a child.

Coming to the point,Venkata, I couldn't find any conclusive answer according to Vyakarana. Even Mahabhaga Subrahmanyam Koradaji agrees that if this word has been mentioned in Puranas, then it is indeed authentic and not an apashabda, but what is the vyutpatti?

Vem as a halant Sanskrit word, is very unseen. Which Dhatu could make it? Is it Avutpanna Pratipadika? If it is, Wjere has it been used? Or it means sin in Tamil/Telugu either languages and probably been adapted in Sanskritik texts.

Vem as described in Brahma Purana by Mahabhaga was Amrita/Indira and tam Vistarayati iti Venkatah, but does Kata mean to expand? I'm asking.

Still, I'm very hopeful for some scope in Kat meaning the hip portion, as we can see Shreenivas's left hand is one the hip portion. He's also known as Varada-Swami as his other hand is in Varada Mudra, Where he blesses his devotees.  
Can it be possible for Venkata being derived from Vi-upasarga (stands for vilambita) and some Nipaatnat Guna and Gnalaar addition in between? Or the word Vem should be kept as it is as an Avutpanna Pratipadika, rather been adapted from Tamil/Telugu also?

Thank You.
