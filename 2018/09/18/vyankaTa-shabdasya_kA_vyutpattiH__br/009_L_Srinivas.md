This seems very much like NammAzhvAr's phrase 'vEm kaTaGkaL' which is plural for 'vEm kaTam' meaning 'karma' (kaTam) 'will burn' ('vEm').

  

But I can't understand why a place name in Andhra has to have a Sanskrit etymology. In fact I won't be surprised if some place names in the north themselves dont have Sanskrit etymologies. Do places like 'Arrah, Ballia, Chhapra', have Sanskrit etymology? Even if they do I'm sure very few of the ṣoḍaśajanapadaḥ have proper Sanskrit etymologies.
