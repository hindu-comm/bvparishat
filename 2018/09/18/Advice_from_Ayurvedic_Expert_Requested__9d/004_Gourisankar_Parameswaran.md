Sir

**I Dr.P.Gourisankar, Professor, Vaidyaratnam Ayurveda College, Ollur, Thrissur, Kerala.**

**What I feel and my experience is expiry date is there for Ayurvedic medicines also.**

**Now a days Arishta and Asvas are also manufactured in such way that it is not possible to use after 1 year.**

**If you are manufacturing medicines for your practice it is the best way for results and efficacy.**

**Or purchase from good companies. Please do needful**

**Thank you.**
