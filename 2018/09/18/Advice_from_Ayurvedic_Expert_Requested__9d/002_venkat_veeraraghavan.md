Dear Sir,

  

I am no Ayurvedic doctor, but have experience using Ayurvedic medicines.

  

Herbs as mentioned have a short shelf life of 1 year and less.

The same herbs have a shelf life of 10 years when in the form of Arishta or Asava (medicinal alcohols)

Medicines containing rasa(purified mercury) and other bhasmas have no use-by date.

  

As for your elevated lead levels, check your water sources and give your daily medicines for a lab test. Only sure way of knowing where the contamination is from.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
