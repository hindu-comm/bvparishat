Dear Sir,

  

Few years back I bought ayruvedic medicines Churnas (powders) and roots in packed covers.

When I opened now I saw its expiry date as year 2017.

Do Ayuvedic medicines carry expiry date?

I just want to inform that the above said are dry medicines, not liquid medicines.

  

I have been taking ayurvedic medicines for migraine.

Recently when tested, my blood has lead(Pb) levels above the permitted levels.

The Englishdoctors could not understand how the lead has come.

When searched online, it is written that some ayurvedic medicines contain lead which is poisonous.

  

I solicitresponse from Ayurvedic expertson the above two matters.

  

Regards

Ramnana murthy
