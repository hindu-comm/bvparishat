Respected Scholars,

  

Though I am not an authority, I have a case to discuss regarding lead. It was discussed by managing director of a reputed pharmacy company who do chemical analysis once the drug is prepared.  

  

A pharmacy company found negligible amount of lead in preparations of Triphala Churna, although Triphala was not being prepared using lead instruments. After through checking, they arrived at a conclusion that probably the trucks travelling through near-by road might have damaged the plants and can be possible reason of lead going inside the fruits (It is their guess and not yet proved).

  

I have also heard that Ayurvedic preparations involve "Shuddhi" process when they deal with metals like lead, mercury, etc. If the process is not carried out with care, the preparations may harm. Unfortunately, the medical science blames Ayurveda since they do not approve such processes that occur at subtle levels.  

  

This is at present a highly debatable issue in Ayurveda. To add more to this, recently Govt. has banned usage of mercury for medicinal purposes. Most of the Ras-Aushadhis use mercury and give good results.  

  

Warm Regards,
