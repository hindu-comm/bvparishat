My grandmother used to tell us that काष्ठादि (herbal) medicines should not be used after one year (may be they rot out or would not be as efficacious as new herbs), and रासायनादि (having some metals or minerals as ingredients) may be preserved for indefinite period, She would not let the vaidya prescribe रासायनादि for us as she thought the रासायनादि medicines would do more harm, and must be used very sparingly.

  

regards,

Prakash
