I would like to share my experience. I am an MBBS doctor. Some part of the India have high level of lead/arsenic in soil/water. Some plants absorb more of these metals than other plants. Like rice absorb them more. So It is not always the case of added lead/arsenic but herb grown in soil which has more of these. Better to check the arsenic/lead level in water/soil in the laboratory.

  

thanks
