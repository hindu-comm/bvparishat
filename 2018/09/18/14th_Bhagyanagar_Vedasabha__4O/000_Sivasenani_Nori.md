**FAQs**

1.What is aVedaSabha?

It is an assembly ofVedicscholars, each one of whom knows at least oneVedacompletely.



2.Why is it conducted?

Vedaghosha and*Āśīrvacana*by the shcolars is auspicious. Our stated aim in conducting thissabhais*lokakalyaṇam*, for the general good of all. A secondary benefit is that, it serves as a public format for the display of the knowledge of the scholars.



3.What is the format?

The*parīkṣa*method is followed wherein in each round, the President and Vice-President of thesabhastart reciting from a random point in each*kāṇḍa;*the next pair of scholars continue from where the President and Vice-President stop; thereafter the third pair continue from where the second pair stop; and so on till all the scholars present complete chanting. There would be seven rounds to cover the seven*kāṇḍa*s of the Krishna Yajurveda and three rounds to cover the*Brāhmaṇa*, and two rounds to cover *Āraṇyaka*and *Upaniṣat*portions. At the beginning, there would be puja (10 minutes or less) to the Vedamātā, and at the end*Āśīrvacana*(30 minutes), followed by felicitation ofVedicscholars (30 minutes) 



4.Why do you follow the*Parīkṣa*format? Do you intend to test the scholars who attend?

No. Rather it is to demonstrate the mastery of these great scholars. It is possible to participate in such sabhas only if one retains the mastery obtained at an earlier stage in life. Anyone can dress as a scholar making people wonder about the actual scholarship; sabhas such as these dispel such doubts.



5.Would there be anything to eat?

Traditional lunch would be served between 1 pm and 3 pm.



6.Can I, then, call my friends / relatives / in-laws / parents for this? They might be interested.

Please do. The whole point of this event is to ensure that such people get a chance to witness and be blessed.



7.Do we need to contribute some money?

No. The trust would felicitate the scholars.



8.Is video recording or audio recording allowed?

Generally, no. It is allowed in certain cases. Please discuss with the organisers for the details.



9.Is there a dress code for the attendees or other restrictions?

No. We request you to be in a clean state. Whatever rules you follow in going to a temple, kindly follow the same.



10\. How long should we plan to be there? What is the best time to attend?

Your wish. You can be at the venue for half-an-hour or the whole day, depending on your interest. If you spend at least 45 minutes in the first half or second half, there will be a chance to hear the chanting of all the four Vedas (subject to attendance by scholars of Rig, Sama and Atharva sakhas). The *Āśīrvacana*towards the end (starting between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm) is also very nice with all the scholars present chanting together.



11\. Is there a facility to park cars?

If you come to Shankar Mutt from the main road, there is no parking on the main road. However cars can be parked in the inside lanes. The route to the back lanes is given here: <https://goo.gl/maps/nSVuQaJzKf62>
