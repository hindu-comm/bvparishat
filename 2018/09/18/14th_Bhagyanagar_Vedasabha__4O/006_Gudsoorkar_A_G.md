Congratulations Dr Senani.

It must be a really great event. I have participated and enjoyed earlier with full satisfaction.

  

In July, I have left Hyderabad and relocated at Wakad, Pune. I request you to to share such events with me in future also. I wish you all the success in promotion of Sansktit and study of Vedas.
