Sri Sivasenani garu,

  

This is a beautiful event you are organizing. People who have drifted away from our vedic roots, such as me, will find some measure of peace and purity by listening to authentic vedic recitation, if only for a day. I will make every effort to come. (Just for directions, the venue, Sankara Math, is near Vidya Nagar MMTS station, correct?)

  

Also, this is a long shot, and kindly take this query in the proper spirit, but is there any possibility that some of the visiting vedic scholars could also be experts in Yoga? After the recitation is over, if there is any such scholar who is kindly disposed to inquirers, I would want to speak to them about a couple of practice points. Any guidance you would care to provide in this matter, circumstances and occasion permitting, would be greatly appreciated.

  

best regards

Harsha Wardhan
