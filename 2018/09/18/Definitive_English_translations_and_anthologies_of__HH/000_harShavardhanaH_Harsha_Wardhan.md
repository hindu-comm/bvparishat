Namaskar to all,

  

This is a request to scholars who are involved in Samskrita and Indian language studies and mythology studies, and also to those who have an interest in these areas.

  

I am looking for translations and anthologies (in the English language) of Indian mythology, stories and folklore (excepting the puranas). There are many translations and anthologies available in the market today, but I am unsure of their completeness and comprehensiveness (being unfamiliar with this field). Hence this request for recommendations of preferably complete translations and preferably comprehensive anthologies.

  

I have, with me, the Arthur W Ryder translation of the **Panchatantra** and the A N D Haksar (Penguin Classics) translation of the **Hitopadesa** curently.

  

Could you kindly help me out with the following:

  

1\. **The Kathasaritasagara:** Tawney and the massive Penzer are available on [archive.org](http://archive.org), but I am looking for physical editions (actual paper-based books). Is there any other translation available, or perhaps an authoritative abridgment?

2\. **The Vetalapanchavimsati:** This is available in many watered down versions. I am looking for a translation faithful to the original.

3\. **The Jataka tales:** Again, same problems - watered down, abridged. Any recommended translation that's faithful to the original?

4\. **Anthologies of Indian folklore:**I have no clue here. Kindly recommend.

5\. **Any encyclopedia of Indian Mythology:** Somethingon the lines of the Puranic encyclopedia of Vettam Mani?

  

There are other topics in this field, I am sure, that I don't know I don't know. I would be grateful if you could guide me in this regard.

  

with kind regards

Harsha Wardhan
