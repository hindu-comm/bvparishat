\> **Anthologies of Indian folklore:**I have no clue here. Kindly recommend.

  

Since this has been one of my specialities in my career, I can tell you with confidence that the list of books is too big for an email thread. That is English.

  

If we include anthologies in regional Indian languages, it is even bigger.
