Dear Murthy Ji,

  

  I am looking at the edition of Vr̥ttaratnākara with the commentary of Bhaṭṭa Narāyaṇabhaṭṭa, Haridas Sanskrit Series, 1984, p. 75. First, the name of the meter is Śrī, rather than Strī, and the definition runs: बाणरसै: स्याद्भतनगगै: श्री:, and the Ṭippaṇī on this says: अस्यैव च्छन्दसो नामान्तरं मौक्तिकमाला इत्यत एतदुदाहरणं तत्रैव प्रदर्शयिष्यते । On both of these meters, the same Yati division is mentioned. Your question as to why these are given separately is still a good question.
Probably, two different names were common among different traditions, and the author wanted to make sure to provide definitions for both the known names. With best wishes,
