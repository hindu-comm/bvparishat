Respected Prof.Madhavji,

I am thankful to you for your fast response and suggesting a plausible explanation for the repetition of the same vRutta in vruttaratnaakara. I deliberately delayed my response waiting for any other guidance from other scholars.

I find that Kedarabhatta generally mentions the same vrutta having two different names or two different yatis in successive slokaardhaas. For example, in 14-syllable section

उक्ता वसन्ततिलका तभजा जगौ गः ॥ ४ ॥

सिंहोन्नतेति गदिता मुनिकाश्यपेन ॥ ५ ॥

In 15-syllable section

द्विहतहयलघुरथ गिति शशिकला ॥ १॥

स्रगिति भवति रसनवकयतिरियम् ॥ २ ॥

वसुमुनियतिरिह मणिगणकिरणः ॥ ३ ॥

refer to the same vRutta with differences in yati only.

Generally, Chandas is taught as an appendix to studying Kaavyas and does not get much importance. Yet, I do not like to believe that my trifling question, turns out to be a "good question" in the 21st century while Kedarabhatta wrote his masterpiece in the 14th-15th century.

I do hope that this is not due to the attitude of पुराणमित्येव हि साधु सर्वम् .

Warm regards,

Murthy
