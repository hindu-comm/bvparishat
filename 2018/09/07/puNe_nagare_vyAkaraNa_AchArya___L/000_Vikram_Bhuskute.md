Dear all respected scholar,

  

I am a beginner in SamskritVyakaran. I know this group is filled with elite scholars. Still, I beg your pardon for this email.

  

I am desperately looking for some वैयाकरणाचार्य in Pune from whom I can learn Vyakaran and other Shastras.

  

Preferably through the method by वैयाकारणाचार्य Pushpa Dixit. If not anyone who can take personal classes.

  

Please help me in finding one.

  

  

Regards,

Vikram Bhuskute
