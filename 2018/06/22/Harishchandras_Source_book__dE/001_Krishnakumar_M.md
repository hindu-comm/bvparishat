Namaste,

  

In Srimad Devi Bhagavata the Harischandra story is quite elaborate, running into 14 chapters (14 - 27, Skandha VII). Wiki says, it is also found in Mahabharata, the Markandeya Purana etc too. Not sure to what level of detail, the story is recounted in these tests.

  

Best regards,

  

Krishna Kumar
