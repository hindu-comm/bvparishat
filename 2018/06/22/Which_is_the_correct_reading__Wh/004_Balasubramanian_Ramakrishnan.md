Sorry, just realized that I made a typo in my previous mail. The Tamil smartas use the second reading नीलतोयदमध्यस्थाद्विद्युल्लेखेव भास्वरा ।The Dravida patha in the grantha text shows the former reading. The suktam itself is also different from the smArta reading in other places, including different words and even different sentences/order of sentences. The curious thing is the reading with the da-kaara is called Andhra Patha in TN, but looks like our Telugu members have a different reading.
