While on the topic, there seem to be two explanations of the word araNya.

1\. Not worthy of raNa रण

A forest land uninhabitable was not worth the war (in those days , today one may find other resources)

  

2\. Not easy to move about ऋ root for movement.

  

Any lights on the meaning of araNya?

And does that shed any light on the word AraNyaka? Is it that they are written for those living in a place not worth fighting for, hence peaceful; or they difficult to fathom the subtle meaning of?
