Namaskar to all

  

In the (Purva) Mimamsa Sutras, with reference to Jaimini's characterization of Sabda (word/Veda) as eternal,

  

1\. Is Sabda taken to be eternal because it is synonymous with "Idea", or "Knowledge", or "mental conception of an existing or imaginary entity", which pre-exists (or has always existed) before popping into a human's mind, or

  

2\. Is Sabda taken to be eternal owing to the definite mapping or interrelation done between (a specific) idea and (a specific) word that cannot be traced to any human agency?  

  

Any input or comments you'd care to provide would be gratefully received.

  

kind regards

Harsha
