नमस्ते ।  
  
शब्द is to संस्कृत what वेद is to reality.  
  
So, understanding शब्द is equivalent to understanding वेद, via संवर्तन. On the other hand, understanding वेद requires some mode of communication between the knower and the student; this media, again, is Sanskrit.  
This media couldn't have been Mathematics (despite its 'precision' and the fact that numbers system also came from the same Vedic culture) because Mathematics itself is communicated through -hence dependent upon- language (its symbols lose meaning outside that reference).  
Much of the Jaiminiya system points to this understanding as its ancient basis.
