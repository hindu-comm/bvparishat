Srimadbhagavatam has this sloka:  
  
etāvāḹ loka-vinyāso māna-lakṣaṇa-saṁsthābhir vicintitaḥ kavibhiḥ sa tu pañcāśat-koṭi-gaṇitasya bhū-golasya turīya-bhāgo ’yaṁ lokālokācalaḥ.  
  
SYNONYMS  
  
etāvān—this much; loka-vinyāsaḥ—the placing of the different planets; māna—with measurements; lakṣaṇa—symptoms; saṁsthābhiḥ—as well as with their different situations; vicintitaḥ—established by scientific calculations; kavibhiḥ—by learned scholars; saḥ—that; tu—but; pañcāśat-koṭi—500,000,000 yojanas; gaṇitasya—which is measured at; bhū-golasya—of the planetary system known as Bhūgolaka; turīya-bhāgaḥ—one fourth; ayam—this; lokāloka-acalaḥ—the mountain known as Lokāloka.  
  
TRANSLATION  
  
Learned scholars who are free from mistakes, illusions and propensities to cheat have thus described the planetary systems and their particular symptoms, measurements and locations. With great deliberation, they have established the truth that the distance between Sumeru and the mountain known as Lokāloka is one fourth of the diameter of the universe—or, in other words, 125,000,000 yojanas \[1 billion miles\].
