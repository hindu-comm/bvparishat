Two more Indian origin names Michael Reddy and Srini Narayanan figure in the publication:

A very important conclusion which brings in the relevance of the studies of Indian Aalankaarikas, in this publication is the highlighted portion (highlighting mine):

  

This volume is a contribution to the scientific study of how the human brain can give rise to the details of thought and language—in this case, metaphorical thought and language. ***Neuroscience alone cannot answer this question, since it does not study the details of thought and language. Cognitive linguistics does.*** Hence, this paper. Experimental embodied cognition research also contributes scientific research on this issue. And finally, neural computation of the sort pioneered by Srini Narayanan has allowed us to model the requisite neural circuitry and neural learning mechanisms.  

  

It is in cognitive linguistics that Bhatrtrihari's Vaakyapadiyam excels. In its application to Rasa cognition, Abhinavagupta excels.
