On a related note, I was saying that Anthropocentrism is typical of European world-view , that is why they have been talking of only human rights . Their talk of animal rights is just recent. Whereas our ancient texts talked of adharma towards bhootaani not adharma towards manushyaah separately.

  

Words such as bhootaani are more frequent in Sanskrit texts throughout, compared to words such as manushyaah in such contexts.
