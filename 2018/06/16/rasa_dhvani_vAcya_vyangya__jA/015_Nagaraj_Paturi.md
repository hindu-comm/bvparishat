What are the implications of Chomsky's validation by neuroscience for Sanskrit tradition, particularly Sanskrit grammatical tradition?

  

In the early days of Syntactic Structures (1957) by Chomsky, people compared the rule-based transformational and generative
structure/nature of AshTaadhyaayee with TG grammar. There were a good number of such comparisons those days.(My teacher H S Antanarayana compared (1970) Paninian Kaaraka system with Fillmore (1968)'s Case Grammar (which was a model within Chomskian theory)

  

But the psychological aspects of Chomskyan theory such as an innate/inborn LAD (Language Acquisition Device) being available in Paniniyan tradition too was not known by that time.

  

One deeper comparison between AA and TG Grammar than just the structure was done by Staal (1967), who said Paninian grammar is interested in both Competence and Performance in contrast to Meemaamsaa which is interested only in Performance.

  

Nagaraj Paturi(1987) brought out the fact that an innate/inborn LAD( Language Acquisition Device) is available in Paniniyan tradition too while showing that all such cognition /psychological (neurological) aspects of Paninian tradition were discussed in Vaakyapadeeyam and showed evidences for Paninian tradition's own claim agreeing with Staal's claim (regarding Competence and Performance) in that book.

  

In 1988 , when I was presenting some of these discoveries as a paper at ISDL's annual conference at Kanyakumari, some asked me whether Bhartrihari's claims belonged to a sound science paradigm as did Chomsky's. I said the human neurological aspects etc. in the paradigm to which Vaakyapadeeyam belongs were to be found in Ayurveda, Yoga, Saankhya etc.
