Nagarajji,

  

As you might imagine I am interested in its neurology and

not the descriptive definitions. Both the effects appear to me

to have similar origin. Let us wait if anyone else has a thought.

  

While talking about rasa, has anyone read the new reader by Pollock?

Any reviews? I just started. His language in the past tense makes him

one of those who wish not to be identified as part of the tradition. I am

reading under the assumption that he has an academic view. I have to

complete our work for Vancouver.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy
