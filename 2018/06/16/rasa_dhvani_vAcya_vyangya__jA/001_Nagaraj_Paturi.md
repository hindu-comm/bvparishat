Dear Prof. Misra,

  

Now that you say that you now have time for this, let us go back to the start.

  

\> The question would be to think how the metaphorical expressionsare created and where are they located.

  

---- Metaphorical expressions do not belong to either vaachya or vyangya that you say are interested in.

  

Metaphorical expressions are called laakshaNika expressions.

  

For Anandavardhana, there are three S'abdavrittis:

  

abhidhaa

  

lakshaNaa

  

vyanjanaa

  

Your vaachya(artha) is caused by the first. Your vyangya(artha) is caused by the third. metaphorical expressions communicate through the second.

  

dhvani belongs to the third. Often dhvani and vyanjanaa are used synonymously.

  

dhvani, among other things, explains how rasa is created in a sahridaya by a s'ravyakaavya.

  

Chomsky's recursion is not connected to this.
