A related “law” of aesthetics is peekaboo. ***In the ninth century A.D. Indian philosopher Abhinavagupta discovered this effect***, which Austrian-British art historian Sir Ernst Gombrich rediscovered in the 20th century. An unclothed person who has only arms or part of a shoulder jutting out from behind a shower curtain or who is behind a diaphanous veil is much more alluring than a completely uncovered nude. Just as the thinking parts of our brains enjoy intellectual problem solving, the visual system seems to enjoy discovering a hidden object. Evolution has seen to it that the very act of searching for the hidden object is enjoyable, not just the final “aha” of recognition—lest you give up too early in the chase. Otherwise, we would not pursue a potential prey or mate glimpsed partially behind bushes or dense fog.

Every partial glimpse of an object (*d*) prompts a search—leading to a mini “aha”—that sends a message back to bias earlier stages of visual processing. This message in turn prompts a further search and—after several such iterations and mini “ahas”—we arrive at the final “aha!” of recognition. The clever fashion designer or artist tries to evoke as many such mini “ahas,” ambiguities, peak shifts and paradoxes as possible in the image.

We have barely touched on more elusive aspects of aesthetics such as “visual metaphor,” a pleasing resonance between the visual and symbolic elements of an image. Between the aesthetics of gull chicks and the sublime beauty of a Monet, we have a long journey ahead to truly understand visual processing in the brain. Meanwhile our studies have given us tantalizing glimpses of what the terrain might look like, inspiring us to continue our pursuit.
