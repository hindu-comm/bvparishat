"This is a very ingenious and elegant approach to the problem," says neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran of the University of California, San Diego. But he says it doesn't quite show that sensory experiences are essential for getting metaphors. To rule out the possibility that the sensory activity is just an incidental byproduct, Ramachandran suggests the researchers try temporarily disabling the parietal operculum with a method called[transcranial magnetic stimulation](http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/11/overactive-neurons-may-tangle-th.html?ref=hp)to see if that interferes with people's ability to grasp metaphors. Sathian already plans to pursue this. "These are difficult experiments," Ramachandran says, "but the authors have paved the way."
