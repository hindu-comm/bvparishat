Dear friends,

  

Good morning.,

I had written about it earlier but I had to go away to create a public lecture.

The lecture is done and is posted now. It is an effort to explain ourselves

to the world.

I want to get back to the rasa and dhvani, particularly the manifestation

of vAcya and vyangya. I would like to look vyangya from the point of view

of recursion in language as observed by Noam Chomsky here in MIT.

The question would be to think how the metaphorical expressions

are created and where are they located. In Chomsky's theory recursion

is unlimited. Can we not think that the vyangya in principle could be

unlimited?

  

Please respond to me privately or you can post here if you like.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
