Right neurology follows right descritive definitions.

  

Aanandavardhana follows Bhartrihari.

  

Bhartrihari has neurological stuff.

  

Probably Anandavardhana thought that he need not reproduce all that.

  

Abhinavagupta (who is a commentator of Anandavardhana too) has cognitive explanations.

They can be taken into neurology.
