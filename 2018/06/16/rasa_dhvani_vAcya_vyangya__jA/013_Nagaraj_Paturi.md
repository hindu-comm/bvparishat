Prof. Sai Susarla, Dean, MIT (Maharashtra Institute of Technology) School of Vedic Sciences, Pune, a highly accomplished computer scientist, and Prof. Kanchi Gopinath , Head, Computer Science at IISC, Bengaluru, no need to see how accomplished he is in computer science,

  

are working on

  

modelling Indian Aesthetic Theories

  

including the Dhvani/Vyangya model of Rasa.

  

They recently organised a workshop where experts from Natyashastra, Sangeeta Shaastra ,Alankara Shastra and Sthaapatya and Vaakyapadiyam participated.

  

I helped them in gathering the Shaastra fraternity apart from representing Vaakyapadiyam.

  

They mentioned to me work on sentiment analysis etc. at Carnegie Mellon University etc. as examples of work being done in aesthetics/emotion-communication related areas. Both of them, as they are knowledgeable in Sanskrit and Shaastras too, are confident that our S'aastras can help a much better, much deeper and wider and much more robust work with the help of our S'aastras.

  

It is such computational and modelling understanding that helps in neurological understanding of the issue.

  

Prof. Sai Susarla is on this list.

  

I can provide the contact info of Prof. Kanchi Gopinath offline.
