A friend who wanted to purchase the Amarakosha CD tried to contact ASR from a phone number available on the net. He reported the following.

  

Academy of Sanskrit Research

Research center in Karnataka

Address: Melukote, Karnataka 571431

Phone: 082362 09178

  

I tried reaching the said number many times, but it looks like it doesn't exist. Any alternative number please?  

  

regards
