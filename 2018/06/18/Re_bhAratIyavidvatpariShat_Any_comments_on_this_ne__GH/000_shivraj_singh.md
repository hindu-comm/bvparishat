What a wonderful news! Thanks for posting this.  
  
There is a statement in the news article that is erroneous :  
"It is but a manifestation of the eternal nature of Sanatana Dharma that three people, a Maharashtrian Madhva, an engineer from Mathura and a Sanskrit Scholar from Nepal, were brought together on this quest to revive a millennia-old tradition, nearly extinct for several centuries.".  
  
There is nothing eternal about Sanatan Dharma. We just need to look at Iran. They also had a very ancient fire worship religion , Zoroasterinism, which was completely run over by marauding Arabs and followers of the ancient fire in Iran were converted at the edge of the sword. In India our religion was preserved because the kings here fought tooth and nail and kept fighting till everyone in their family was either dead or old. Some scholars have understood this but most have not. Here is some data:

I hope vasundhara raje's govt felicitates the two old teachers who have preserved these treasures of our Dharm and culture. Is it possible that renowned scholars of this group like Madhav, Ashok, Kannan, Korada , Iyengar, Pandurangi, Paturi, Bijoy, Rajiv and so many more send a letter to Vaunsdhara asking her to felicitate the two Mahatamas at Banaswada?
