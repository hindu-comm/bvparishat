Dear Prof. Sundareshwaran,

  

As per Jan Gonda in his "The Ritual Sutras", page 610 it is the work of one SubrahmaNya. He gives the reference in footnote 268, SubrahmaNya, gobhila-gR^ihya-karma-pradIpa, ed. by Purusottama Sastri and Suryanarayana Diksita, Benares 1905. He has not discussed the date of the author.

  

Ramakrishnan
