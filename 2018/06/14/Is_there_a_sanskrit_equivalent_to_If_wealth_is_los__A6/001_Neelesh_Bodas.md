not exactly what you are looking for, but this one fromविदुरनीतिः goes somewhat closer -

  

वृत्तं यत्नेन संरक्षेद् वित्तमेति च याति च। अक्षीणो वित्ततः क्षीणो वृत्ततस्तु हतो हतः ॥

  

Protect the character with efforts. Wealth will come and go. If wealth is lost, nothing is lost. If character is lost, everything is lost.
