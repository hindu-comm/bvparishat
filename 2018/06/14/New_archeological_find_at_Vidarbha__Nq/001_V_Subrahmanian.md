Thanks for sharing this. This information in the report is really interesting:

  

//An intact idol of Ganesha, without any ornaments, revealed that the deity was among the commonly-worshiped ones, and in this case, meant for private worship.//

  

The period of the dynasty is stated to be 250 - 550 CE. Ganesha being worshiped at that distant period is noteworthy.
