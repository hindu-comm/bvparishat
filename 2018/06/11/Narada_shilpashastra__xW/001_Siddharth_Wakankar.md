Dear Sir,

  

Pl.read and study our joint publication,viz.Naradashilpa,which is going to be out this week,as announced by Prof.R.N.Iyengar on bvp.

  

Myself and Prof.Iyengar started working on it in May,2011.My main task was to edit the Sanskrit Text and give its preliminary English translation, which I completed in June 2015,after leaving Bangalore. I edited the Baroda Ms.and Prof.Kannan who joined Prof.Iyengar after me edited and translated the Adyar or Mysore Mss.

  

I procured the xerox.copies of the MSS.of Naradashilapashastra from Adyar, Mysore etc.and provided the copies to Prof.Iyengar.

  

Initially,it was decided that we both-myself and Prof.Kannan-will edit and translate the Sanskrit Text and Prof.Iyengar will furnish the Technical or Engineering Notes etc.which he has done admirably,on the basis of the edited texts and English translation.

  

So,you are sincerely requested to study this publication and get yourself benefited from the technical output presented therein.

.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar
