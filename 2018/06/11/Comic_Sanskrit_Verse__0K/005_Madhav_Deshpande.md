Dear Lokesh Johri Ji,

  

  Sanskrit has two similar sounding verbs that have different meanings. भाषते means "to speak" while भषति means "to bark." The comedy in the Śloka is that the person who claims to have become a Pandit without studying पाणिनिस्य व्याकर्णम् \[not able to correctly say पाणिने: व्याकरणम्\], then uses भषामि and भषक to describe that he is speaking and is a speaker, without realizing that he is describing a dog and his barking. Best,
