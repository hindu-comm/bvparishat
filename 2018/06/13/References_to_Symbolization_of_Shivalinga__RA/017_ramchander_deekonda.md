Respected Scholars,

  

Whilst on the subject of Yonirlingam, I would like to bring to your notice that I have seen Phallus alone without any yoni (or paanapattam) being worshipped in an ancient temple in Mudimallam village, near Tirupati. It seems this phallus worship is/was a common phenomenon in and around Tirupati. A big phallus deity is on display in the Archaeological museum located within the fort of Chandragiri. Scholars can throw some light on this aspect too and enlarge our understanding.

  

  

Regards,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
