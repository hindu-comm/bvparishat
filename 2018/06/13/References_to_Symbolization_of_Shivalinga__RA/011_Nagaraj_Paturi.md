Is this interpretation of shiva linga and its supporting structure as male and female organs widely prevalent? Do all the devotees visiting temples with this structure as deity and worshipping it, view it with this perspective? Do all the people worshipping this sructure at homes view it this way?

  

or

  

Is it a secret understanding passed by a few enlightened gurus to a few fortunate recievers in a paramparaa?

  

My observation is that this interpretation is not widely prevalent at a popular level.Devotees visiting temples with this structure as deity and worshipping it, do not view it with this perspective.Common people worshipping this structure at homes do not view it this way.

  

If this understanding exists,it must bea secret understanding passed by a few enlightened gurus to a few fortunate receivers in a paramparaa. In such a case, it is possible that the secret is kept a secret and not documented anywhere.

  

From some of the previous posts, it appears that the gurus in the paramparaa revealed different things to different receivers : to some,
the 'penis' is actually protruding inside, not outside (this seems to be not even from guruparamparaa but Adhyatmika intuition) and for some
not in a inserted condition but they are kept together, the female symbol in the bottom and the male symbol above.
