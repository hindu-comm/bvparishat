Sir,

  

The discussion on the pair: linga and its peeTha

  

is completely different from

  

the discussion of linga alone.

  

This phallic interpretation of linga as a separate entity lead to highly heated discussion on BVP earlier:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

That said, the place that you call Mudimallam is in fact called Gudimallam.

  

This is the temple and the Shivalinga in it that are shown as the evidence for phallic view of Shivalinga.

  

Focusing just on the archaeological or art history aspect of this :

  

Archaeologists and Art Historians have always struggled to explain the fact that the so called realistic phallus shape Shivalingas are very small in number when compared to abounding number of shivalingas without those 'realistic' features and these few belong to a certain ancient date and none of the Shivalingas of the later date have these 'realistic' features. They come with an explanation that the 'realistic' images very soon evolved into abstract representations.

  

--------------

  

I may again be forgiven for discussing explicitly, -the topic itself and the details being brought in themselves are such-

  

\- since those who view the Gudimallam Shivalinga as a realistic representation of phallus, did any one check if there is an opening /slit on the top portion of the linga? If there is, that is really realistic. If it is not there, then the question of why the realistic sculptors did not cover this crucial realistic aspect remains to be answered.

  

----------------

  

The temple at Gudimallam is called Sri Parasurameswara temple.

  

What is the connection between the name Sri Parasurameswaraand the image of that deity inside?
