One Interpretation , may be totally different is This Shiv-Linga Style Object Represent some kind of Machine ( Manufacturing Unit ) used for Manufacturing - Possibly extracting Metals \[ In Harrappan ( Indus - Saraswati Civilisation ) Period \]. It was tradition of Passing know-how from generation to next but with keeping Some things secret so that only people in lineage can use such knowledge and be kept secret from others. Over Period such Object got converted to Sacred Form \[ Machine was anyway more sacred as it produced things which could fetch 'money ' for some \] and actual 'use; got lost ................what we have today is 'Formailised form' which may have more hidden aspect ..................
