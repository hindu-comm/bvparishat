Important point by Prof. Paturi. The Siva and Linga puranas do not talk about this aspect at all, as far as I know. The Siva Purana is explicit that the Linga worship is superior to worship with a form only because Siva is ultimately nirguNa, and according to the text the Linga tries to bring out that fact. The Linga purana in its origin stories does not talk about any phallic aspect at all.

  

Personal aside: A long time (20+ years) back, I was travelling to India and picked up some books at the bookstore to read on the plane. I was excited to find a book published by the SUNY press called Dreams, Illusions and other Realities by Wendy Doniger and I read the blurb which said it was a work about the yoga Vasishtha - a favorite text of mine. So I start reading the introduction in the plane and it has something like "the yoga vasishtha could have been written by Jung, just like the Linga purana could have been written by Freud"! I had a sinking feeling, had I just wasted $25, what is even the connection between Freud and Linga purana? Not a comment I would have expected from anyone who had even perused the purana, this is the level of stuff coming from U of Chicago and then getting published by a prestigious press. Of course my fears were borne right. So it's a welcome change to have forums like the bvparishat.
