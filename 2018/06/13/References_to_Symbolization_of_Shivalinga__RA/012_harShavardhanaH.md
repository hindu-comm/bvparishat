Sri Subrahmanian, thank you for the highly relevant article you shared. The article has gathered many original verses given in sruti and smriti.

  

I found the following points of interest (portions in italics are my views):

1.  the infinite jyoti/agni/jwala linga being the formless aspect of
    SthAnu (Siva/Rudra) identified with nirguna Brahman 2.  the skambha/sthambha (pillar) being so because it indicates fixity,
    motionlessness, changelessness, or is thought of as a fixed pillar
    supporting the universe - another way of indicating nirguna
    Brahman  
3.  Maheswara in the skambha aspect being identified with the susumna
    nadi or brahmanadi, with ida and pingala nadis being identified
    with Visnu and Brahma devas. *The central characteristic of the
    susumna nadi is stillness and balance. Hence the effort in Pranayama
    to send prana into the susumna.*  
4.  the skambha being a representation of the *straightened* kundalini
    that is *still and unmoving*, having reached the sahasrara chakra
    from the muladhara chakra (Siva+Sakti)  
5.  the skambha being the human body represented as ekastambham or a
    column or pillar in hatha yoga (Goraksa sataka 14)  
6.  *the skambha as the "rod of time" (KAla), spanning the past, present
    and future of creation, and extending infinitely further* (Skambha
    Suktam, Atharva Veda, X.7.9)  
7.  the skambha as the central axis of the universe, the tree-trunk
    which all beings betake to as branches etc (Skambha Suktam, Atharva
    Veda, X.7.38) \[**“kiṃ svid vanaṃ ka u sa vṛkṣa āsa yato
    dyāvāpṛthivīniṣṭatakṣuḥ \|\|” (Rig Veda 10:31:7a)**“What was the
    tree, what wood, in sooth, produced it, from which they fashioned
    forth the Earth and Heaven?”,**“braḥma vanaṁ braḥma sa vr̥kṣa āsīt
    \|\|” (Taittiriya Brahmana 2:8:9:6)**“Braḥman was the wood, and
    braḥman was the tree out of which they formed heaven and
    Earth”,**“naitāvadenā paro anyadastyukṣā sa dyāvāpṛthivībibharti
    \|\|” (Rig Veda 10:31:8)**“Not only here is this: more is beyond
    us. He is the Bull, the Heaven’s and Earth’s supporter”.\] 8.  the skambha as the drawn-out thread or string on which all beings
    are strung (Skambha Suktam, Atharva Veda, X.8.37, 38) (+ I think a
    verse from the BhagavadGita exhibits a similar concept)

Further,

1.  The Linga and Siva Puranas equate the linga with the agni skambha
    only, understanding the skambha as the representation of the
    infinite nirguna Brahman; they do not equate the linga with the
    genitals.  
2.  The Siva Purana again gives two forms of the skambha - sthula linga
    (for physical, ritual worship) and sukshma linga (inner mental
    conception, yoga). **Ref: aṁguṣṭhamātra puruṣa??** 3.  The Mahabharata also equates the linga with the Brahman aspect.
    **“sa eṣa rudra bhaktaś ca keśavo rudra saṃbhavaḥ \|
    sarvabhūtabhavaṃ jñātvā liṅge ‘rcayati yaḥ prabhum \| tasminn
    abhyadhikāṃ prītiṃ karoti vṛṣabhadhvajaḥ \|” (MBH 7:172:89-90)**
    “Kesava is that devoted worshipper of Rudra who has sprung from
    Rudra himself. Kesava always worships the Lord Siva, regarding his
    Linga emblem to be the origin of the universe. The God having the
    bull for his mark cherisheth greater regard for Kesava”.

*Perhaps the skambha concept was confused with linga as genital concept by conflating the outer shape of the stambha (Siva's emblem in the nirguna aspect) with the erect male genital (Siva's emblem in the saguna aspect; in sculptures, Siva is mostly seen with an erect linga).The issue may have been further compounded by the fact that linga also means the "mark" of the sexes ("linga" male and "yoni" female) in creation, and when you add to it the **pasupati concept and the purusa-prakrti concept**, the linga-embedded-in-yoni idea can emerge.**“rudro liṅgamumā pīṭhaṃ tasmai tasyai namo namaḥ \|\|” (Rudrahridaya Upanishad 23)** “Rudra is Linga. Uma is Pitha – Prostrations to Him and Her”.*

***Also, the linga-yoni concept can be seen to be derived from the copulation-as-yajna idea given in the BrhadAranyaka Upanisad. The altar is the yoni, the semen issuing from the linga is the libation.** Though it is clear that this concept is not related to the skambha concept, it is possible that somebody conflated it with the skambha idea.* (I may be mixing a Vedic idea with an Agamic idea here. Pls take it with a pinch of salt.)
