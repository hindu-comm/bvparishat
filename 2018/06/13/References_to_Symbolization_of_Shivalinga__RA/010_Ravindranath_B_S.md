Namaskara,

 I was very interestingly following this thread expecting a very good and simple answer, as I was also looking for the answer and I felt I am going to get the answer similar to mine,



 It is very simple the SI VA LINGA is symbol of male and female of the evolution which are common of every living being, and they are not in a inserted condition but they are kept together, the female symbol in the bottom and the male symbol above, and our ancients recognized it as very important,



 If we start looking for only written document for everything we will loose our life and our ancients didn’t look for written proof to live but they created one with valid activity, and they learnt the language from language and the language is sound (SHABHA) but today it learnt from the literacy so obviously this type of confusion are inevitable.
