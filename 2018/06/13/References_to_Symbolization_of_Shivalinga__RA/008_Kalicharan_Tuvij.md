Namaste,

While it is true that shiva-lingam cannot be confined to rigid ideas (that is true for all other deities, too), the basic representation principle still belongs to the one presented in the original post.  
The reason the 'penis' protrudes outside is that - well, it doesn't.  
Mother's existence is the existence of all realms - parA and aparA. So, the 'penis' is actually protruding inside, not outside.  
This understanding itself comes from Adhyatmika intuition (and is deeply vedic), and therefore should be left alone - if not respected (due to superficial vedantic overlay or some other reason).
