A circle extended in three dimensions in space should ideally take the form of a sphere, not a cylinder.

  

The puranic conception of the siva linga being of the form of an unending pillar of brilliance/effulgence fits the bill better, shape-wise. As to ***why*** this pillar concept has come into play is beyond my current understanding.

  

Also, I am in agreement with the refutal of the engorged penis-in-vagina interpretation based on simple common-sense by Sri Paturi. His refutation seems proper to me, unless we propound the idea that the glans penis is to be understood as being the base of the linga buried in the mound.

  

The issue is not simple.
