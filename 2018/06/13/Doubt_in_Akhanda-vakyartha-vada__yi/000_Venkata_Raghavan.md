Hello,

  

I am working on a text called śabda-vyāpāra-vicāra by Mammata Bhatta.

In this text, there is a very brief discussion of akhaṇḍa-vākyārtha-vāda. Mammata while setting forth this view says:

" kaśābhidhānātturagasya yathā preṣito'hamanena dhāvana iti pratibhodeti tadvatpratibhāvaśādviśiṣṭavākyātpratipattiriti saiva vākyārthaḥ \|" (Dwivedi, Chowkhambha vidyabhawan, 1974, p. 29)  

 कशाभिधानात्तुरगस्य यथा प्रेषितोऽहमनेन धावन इति प्रतिभोदेति तद्वत्प्रतिभावशाद्विशिष्टवाक्यात्प्रतिपत्तिरिति सैव वाक्यार्थः\|

  

I would like to know if this analogy (of comparing *pratibha* to the ability of a horse to understand a whip) is actually used by Bhartṛhari himself (or by his commentators)?

If not, is this a good analogy? Compared to the more famous "jeweller analogy" used to explain the comprehension of spoṭa how does this fare?

  

Sincerely

Raghavan
