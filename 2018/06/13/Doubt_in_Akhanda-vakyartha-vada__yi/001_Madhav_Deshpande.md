Please correctकशाभिधानात्तुरगस्य toकशाभिघातात्तुरगस्य. You have the correct readingकशाभिघातात्तुरगस्य in the edition by Rewa Prasad Dwivedi, while the Niryaya Sagara edition has the wrong readingकशाभिधानात्तुरगस्य. For parallel wording, See Puṇyarāja's commentary on Bhartr̥hari's Vākyapadīya II.118 \[Iyer's edition, p. 58\]:
