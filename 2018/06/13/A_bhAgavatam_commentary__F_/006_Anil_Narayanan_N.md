Historians refer the date of Raghavananda between 1250 and 1325 AD. This is based on the phrase *puṇyāṭvyām yatissyāt -* corresponds to 1314 AD

*Kṛṣṇpadī* is a Sanskrit commentary-Grammatical rules are elaborately discussed.

Vadakkumkur and Kunjunniraja opine that Raghavananda has written commentaries on *Mahābhāgavata, Laghustuti, Paramārthsāra* and *Mukundamālā*

  

Regards,

Anil.
