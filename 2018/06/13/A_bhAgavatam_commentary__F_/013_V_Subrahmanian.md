Thanks Anil for these details. It is very interesting to see the abundance of Sanskrit literature in Kerala. It looks like a lot of works has to see the light of print.

  

As an aside, is there any work about Shankaracharya (or on his works) by any Keralite scholar of the very early times, preceding Raghavananda (13 - 14 CE)? From the document you have shared I find that the Vishnubhujanga prayata poem has been commented by Raghavananda. That gives us an evidence of this work of Adi Shankara being recognized at that early times.

  

warm regards
