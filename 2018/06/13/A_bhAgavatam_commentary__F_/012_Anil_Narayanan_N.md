Pranams..

Kunjunniraja has given the date: 1566 – 1622 AD

Devanarayana alias Pūrāṭam Tirunāl Mahārāja was the king of Ambalappuzha in Kerala. He was the patron of Melputtūr Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭatiri (Nārāyaṇīya fame). Melputtūr himself has recorded that he was drawn to the royal court by the great qualities of the king (स्वगुणैराकृष्य सन्निधिं नीतम् ). Tradition gives many stories connecting these two. Melputtūr, at many instances, has given references to Devanarayana. e.g., in his*Prakriyāsarvasva,*

तिष्ठेत्येवानिलोपि प्रचरति गिरिरप्याज्ञया यस्य राज्ये

शत्रोः सर्वाभिसारे सति रचयति यस्तस्य सर्वापहारम् ।

सोयं निश्शेषशास्त्रश्रुतिनिवहकलानाटकेष्वद्वितीयो

भाति श्री**देवनारायणधरणिपति**र्मग्नचेता मुकुन्दे ।।

Devanarayana’s commentary on the very first verse of *Bhāgavata* called *Vedāntaratnamāla* has been noted by Raja. (CKSL, 1980, p.128).

Regards,

Anil.
