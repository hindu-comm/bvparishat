Pranams..

*Kṛṣṇapadī* commentary was published from Govt. Sanskrit College, Thripunithura, Kerala. Only the first, second and twelfth Skandha-s were published from the college in 80’s. It is almost out of stock. Last December, there were a few copies left for sale.(College phone number:0484 277 7444)

The fourth Skandha has been critically edited by Dr. Nidhessh from Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Puranattukara but not yet published.

Some researchers of Sree Sankaracharya University are preparing editions of 5^(th) and 6^(th) Skandha-s
