Dear Shankara jī,

  

Wonderful! I actually checked both archive and the Jain library. But unfortunately, I searched with different spellings. I should have tried with all possible spellings. I spelt 'Pancagranthi', 'Buddhisagara', Malayagiri, Supadmavyakarana etc and didn't find any result.

  

Anyways, it is really a great help.

  

With gratitude,

Deepro
