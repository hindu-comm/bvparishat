Namo Vidvadbhyaḥ,

  

I do not find certain traditional Sanskrit grammar texts in my university library. I need to read the sections on the varṇasamāmnāya urgently. I would be very grateful if you could share at least the varṇasamāmnāya sections from the following texts:  
  
1. Buddhisāgarasūri's Pañcagranthī Vyākaraṇa \[This text has been published byBhogilal Leherchand Institute of Indology in 2005\]

  

2. Malayagiri's Śabdānuśāsana \[edited by Bechardas Doshhi in 1967\]

  

3. Jibananda Vidyasagar's edition of Kramadīśvara's Saṅkṣiptasāra Vyākaraṇa \[I have looked at Saini's edition. But I did not find any section on the varṇasamāmnāya. Nor does the introduction to this edition clarify the problem. I am not sure if Kramadīśvara or Jumaranandin really enumerated the speech-sounds in their tradition. But the text does use the pratyāhāras and Jumaranandin refers to some of the pratyāhārasūtras at the beginning of Rasavatī\]

  

4\. Padmanābha's Supadma Vyākaraṇa \[This text has been edited by Saini in 1989 and published from Bharatiya Vidya Prakashan\]

  

Regards,

Deepro
