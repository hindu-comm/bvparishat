Namaste,

  

The audio of Balakanda to the extent it has been uploaded on the IIT Kanpur Valmiki Ramayana site is taken from the project on Srimad Valmiki Ramayana by Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati.

  

<http://rsvidyapeetha.ac.in/ramayana/aboutproj.html>

  

It says: "**Audio rendering of slokas:**Dr.Dwaramlakshmi, Reader in music, Sri Padmavati Mahila University, Tirupati.

**Music composed by:**Sri K. Krishna Mohan, Artist, All India Radio"

  

\- Pranav
