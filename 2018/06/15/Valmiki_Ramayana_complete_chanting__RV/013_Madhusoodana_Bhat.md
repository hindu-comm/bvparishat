Sir,

Rendering of Ramayana is downloadable 'sarga' by 'sarga' from IIT K website mentioned above. I have downloaded them and they are excellent. Thus, it saves the trouble of saving verse by verse.

  

However, they only 22 sarga's of Balakanda are available. Sundarakanda audio are also uploaded. However, it is not as melodious as renderings of Balakanda. (No offence meant to the singer. It is just my true opinion)
