**Einstein, Darwin and Brahman!**

Oneness of the animate and inanimate entities of the universe



**“Birds, today is my birthday!** Please sing happy birthday !” a two year old child on her birthday morning asks the birds that come every day in her backyard. “ Sorry chair, I hurt you” says at another time for pushing a chair and making it fall on floor with a big bang. In the child’s mind everything in its surroundings is full of life just as itself. Probably at that age, children truly believe that they are a part of the nature.

They must have a realization that whatever is in them is the same as what is there in the others and all the animate and inanimate objects in the world. They do not know about atom or atman but know that the entire universe is a united and belong to one, itself. This realization comes to them naturally in the beginning. Isn’t this what Einstein struggled to achieve – A unified theory for the universe? Isn’t this Darwin wanted to show we evolved from other primitive forms of life and thus we are all one, a unified living system? Isn’t this what the ancient Hindu sages mean, ‘I am Brahman’?



**Einstein’s Unified Field Theory**

After having become famous in early 1900’s for several brilliant breakthroughs in physics, including Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect, and the special and general theories of relativity, Albert Einstein spent the last thirty years of his life on a fruitless quest for a way to mathematically combine electromagnetism and gravity with the understanding of quantum mechanics into [a single elegant theory](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200512/history.cfm) – Unified Field Theory.



**Darwin’s Origin of Species**

Even though generally Charles Darwin was credited with the theory of evolution It is the Greek philosopher Anaximander (\~610 BC) who proposed that humans evolved from animals. After several centuries, the British naturalist Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection to make it stronger. Though evolutionary theory is taken for granted, Darwin himself had difficulty to accept it completely. [Therefore, he devoted a chapter titled difficulties on theory in his famous book – Origin of Species published in 1859](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species_(1859)/Chapter_VI).

**Inanimate and animate worlds**

Einstein wanted to derive a mathematically unified understanding of the physical world. Darwin wanted to explain the origin of all in the biological species. What these two attempted to do unsuccessfully, a two-year-old child does successfully and practically. In fact, one step beyond these two - unifying both physical and biological worlds.

What is common to the physical and biological worlds? Atoms! An [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom) is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element.
Atoms are extremely small; [typical sizes are a fraction of a nano meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radius) (a ten-billionth of a meter). A single [human cell is made of an estimated 100 trillion (10¹²) atoms](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-many-atoms-in-human-cell-603882). Human body has approximately same number of cells. So, a human being can be considered as collection a trillion trillion (10 ²⁴) atoms. [It is estimated that there are 10 ⁷⁸ – 10 ⁸² atoms](https://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/) present in the observable universe that is spread in about 46 billion [light years.](http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/how-far-is-a-light-year) A two-year child unknowingly experiences the oneness with both physical and biological worlds. But the child does not know about atoms. Therefore, there is something that binds the universe together in to one and a child can realize it, as an answer to, who am I?

**Hindu Sages and Brahman**

Who am I? This is the question that man has been asking himself from time immemorial. Hindu sages have done thought experiments to answer this question. From the Vedic literature available today we know their thoughts and answers. Vedic literature must be from some 3,000 years ago. Vedas are a part of Hindu scriptures. The Vedas are divided into four groups, Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda. The portions of Vedas interpreting the philosophy of the original texts constitute the Upanishads. Out of [108 Upanishads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muktik%C4%81) Isha, Chand yoga, Madyuka and Brihadaranyaka has specific postulations about this subject. The essence of knowledge is crystalized in the concept of Brahman. [Brahman as a metaphysical concept is the single binding unity behind diversity in all that exists in the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman). It is explained in [verse 6 and 7 of Isha Upanishad.](https://www.upanishads.iitk.ac.in/isavasya?language=te&field_chap_value=1&field_sec_value=1&field_mantra_no_value=6&ecsiva=1)
Further oneness of the world is elaborated in the verses [in section 10 Chandyoga Upanishad.](https://www.swami-krishnananda.org/chhand/Chhandogya_Upanishad.pdf) [A good modern source for this subject is at Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur, India.](https://www.upanishads.iitk.ac.in/)

In the modern context we can say the universe is made up atoms. Different atoms arranged in different forms can be different entities. This is how a two-year-old sees the world, probably. Therefore it can ask a bird to sing for its birthday and say sorry to a chair for hurting it.
