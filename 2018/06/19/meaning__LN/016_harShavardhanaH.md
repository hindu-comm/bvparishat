Namaskar all

  

Dr Sastry's post is full of important points, and since I have had the same thoughts for some time, I am butting in here, despite my many faults. My intention here is to gain clarity only.

  

I have always been surprised by the refutation of Samkhya and Yoga in the BrahmaSutras proper, and not just in the Advaita tradition. Granted, the issue of identity of Atma and Brahman divides the Samkhya-yogi from the Vedantin, but should that dialectical disputation be made to go to such lengths that such an important practical element as Yoga (based on Samkhya) is dismissed? This is a significant point of doubt for me, and I would appreciate any light scholars would care to throw on this. I am aware that the BrahmaSutras pertain to theory, not practice, but by refuting Samkhya theory, Yoga practice is automatically refuted. The granting of such parts of Yoga as are in agreement with the Upanisads seem to be in name only. I am talking exclusively from a practice angle here. By refuting Yoga in one breath, it is difficult to practice Yoga in another breath, as it were. This cognitive dissonance has informed vedanta throughout, and is the reason for the disinclination for the earnest Vedantin from taking up Yoga practices.

  

But by dismissing Yoga, the mumukshu is chopping off his own legs, as it were. Here, I draw your attention to an observation of Swami Vivekananda about the modern-day Vedantins (of his time). He remarked on the ill-health (sickness) of the Vedantin, who just repeats the mahAvAkyas like a parrot, unmindful of the deterioration of his mind and body (occasioned by the disregard of the Yoga practice aspect). The upshot of his observation is that merely "saying" something like 'aham brahmAsmi' etc is not proper Vedanta. Even when one repeats and contemplates the mahavakyas, one is still in the sphere of the mind, as it were. But Brahma is beyond the mind. Only by recourse to Yoga practices can the mind be stilled and realization of Brahma obtained (or realization of identity of Atma and Paramatma, depending upon personal viewpoint). \[Here, by Yoga practice, I refer to dhyana, which is the core of Yoga, according to Sri Krishna in the Bhagavatam (Uddhava Gita)\]. Perhaps somewhere down the line in history, in the frenzy of philosophical attacks and counter-attacks, some vedantins lost sight of their own points. Nididhyasana, which was earlier synonymous with Yoga-dhyana, became nothing more than sentence-contemplation, and sravana and manana became the whole of the Vedantic practice. I think this signified the core degeneration of Vedantic principles as far as practice is concerned.

  

The other point of doubt for me is the apparent sidelining of the syncretic viewpoint and prescribed practices of the BhagavadGita (in the advaita tradition). If the Gita is accepted as an important part of the prasthana-trayi, then its mass of slokas pertaining to the importance of Yoga practice should have found expression in the practice aspect of the AdvaitaVedantin. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, then the Gita has not been given its due by Advaita. The problem Vedanta has with Samkhya is understandable, but shouldn't the Yoga practices which have been explained in the Gita from a vedantic viewpoint guide the Vedantin in practice? I think sectarianism has prevented the AdvaitaVedantin from adopting a breadth of outlook.  

  

Vijnanabhikshu bemoans this very trend, and very bravely, in my opinion, seeks to harmonize Samkhya, Vedanta and Yoga with a practical eye. His robust presentation of the ancient BhedAbheda viewpoint, which he considers to be the true interpretation of the Upanisads and the BrahmaSutras, give him a strong basis.

  

Advaita did take philosophical dialectics to hitherto unreached levels, but it did so, it seems now, at the expense of the dilution of the practical aspect.

  

I would appreciate any guidance or pointers from the learned scholars in this forum.

  

kind regards

Harsha
