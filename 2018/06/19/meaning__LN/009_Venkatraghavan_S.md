Namaste,

  

Presumably the 'modern advaitin' in the comment below refers to the advaita prevalent in vijnAnabhikshu's time, and not the advaita of today? The latter would be an impossibility.

  

If it was a criticism against 'modern' advaita as opposed to advaita in general (that is, one that flowed from Sankara), then one would have to have seen a systematic loss of the role of yoga within advaita from Sankara's time to the time of vijnAnabhikshu. Otherwise it is a criticism of advaita as a whole, not necessarily modern advaita.

  

Regards

Venkatraghavan
