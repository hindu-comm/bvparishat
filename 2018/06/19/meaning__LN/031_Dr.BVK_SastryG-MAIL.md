Namaste





On \< Vedanta and Samkhya-Yoga differ fundamentally in their approaches to pramaana (proof, or valid method of knowing), which is the basis of all cognition and inquiry. \>



1. If you are starting from ‘ Pramana’ reference point, Then cross the border of ‘Ateendriya – Apaurusheya’ . Till then this discussion will be meaningless.



2. If you are starting from ‘Accepting Veda as Apaursheya - Ateendriya – Pramana’, then get to the ‘Vedanga Language Tools and applications’
first. This ‘Vedanga anchor coupled with practice of yogaangas ( PYS – second chapter’ helps the practitioner to come to the realm of ‘ Beyond One life/ Ati- Mrutyu’ before talking of ‘ Amrutatva’.



Till then all the rest of the discussions is mere verbiage. The line needs to be drawn clearly as ‘ Vaidika – Avaidiak’ / Aastika –Naastika / Yoga ( Theory –instruction analytics , practice) – Viniyoga ( Goal, application, utility) .



Yoga is the foundation of All Darshanas !
