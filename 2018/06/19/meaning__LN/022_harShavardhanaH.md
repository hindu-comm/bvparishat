Sri Subrahmanian ji,

  

Thank you for clarifying. Of course, Samkhya-Yogins themselves quote the Kathopanisad as their support, for it contains the earliest explicit upanisadic reference to the samkhya-yoga schema of senses-objects--mind-ahamkara-buddhi/mahat-avyakta-purusa, which is the basis of all Samkhya epistemology and Yoga practices. This puts me in the piquant situation of begging the question that if Yoga and Samkhya can be seen to have Upanisadic support, then why refute them in the first place?

  

(Perhaps we know the answer - the issue of plurality of purusas and identity of purusa and brahman, as also the nature of the material cause, the pradhana/mulaprakrti, is the point of contention plus the point of departure for Vedanta and Samkhya-Yoga. If that be the case, let us not get into any debate/discussion on that point. I am a student here, looking for guidance only.)

  

Since you are knowledgeable about the Vedanta tradition, I wish to ask for your response to the points made by Sri BVK Sastry in his post. Particularly, are you in agreement with his assertion that Yoga is the foundation of Vedanta?

  

Your guidance is much appreciated.

  

with regards

Harsha
