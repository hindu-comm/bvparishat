Sri venkatraghavan ji,, thank you for clarifying. Your position is also supported by a paper by Smt T S Rukmani, titled "Yoga in Sankara's Advaita Vedanta" published by BORI.

  

Here's the link:<https://www.jstor.org/stable/41692051?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents>

  

Also, I have studied the GudharthaDipika by Madhusudana Srasvati, which, in my view, has the merit of being the first major commentary on the Gita that explicitly takes the word "samyama" mentioned by Sri Krishna in the Gita to mean the technical term "samyama" mentioned by Patanjali as the triad of dharana-dhyana-samadhi in the Yogasutras. Therefore, the charge of not understanding or cavalierly treating Yoga does not stick to Swami Madhusudana Sarasvati at least.

  

Can you let me know what practices are prescribed to the Vedanta student by the advaita acharyas in the guru-shishya parampara today? I just wish to understand if Advaita is the poorer or richer for rejecting Samkhya-Yoga ontology yet, at the same time, adopting Yoga practices, if any.

  

  

regards

Harsha
