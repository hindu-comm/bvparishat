1. I agree \<
येनत्वंशेननविरुध्येते,तेनेष्टमेवसांख्ययोगस्मृत्योःसावकाशत्वम्; > .



2. On \< However, we have to call a spade a spade - there are basic differences between advaita and sAmkhya/yoga which cannot be overlooked if liberation is the ultimate aim. \> 

 This is the point for contemplation ! The differences between ‘Darshanas’ is by the sign posts that come across the road and the postulation of final goal ! These are ‘ exit’ points on the ‘High way of Yoga-Practice’.

If one has not touched or hit the ‘Yoga- High way’ , then the discussion is just checking alternate routes on the map, without taking the vehicle on road !



Then, is ‘ adviata’ a longer and final destination frontier in open ended scenario of exploring consciousness – a journey of different level and goal compared to other dashanas ? May be. It is a matter of how one perceives it.



Does such a perception give scope to an instant short cut to final goal, without touching the high way ( like Mahayana – Hina yana ? ) ?
Debatable issue. It is here that one needs the courage to call a spade a spade !
