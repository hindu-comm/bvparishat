Dear scholars

Can anybody through light on these sentences occuring in Vijñānabhikṣu's BS commentary under BS.I.3 (śāstrayonotvāt).

Bhikṣu criticizes modern day advaitins as follows: "te kāladoṣeṇa viparītatayā **tyaktānādisetavo'andhagolāṅgūlam gr̥hītvā.**...."

I fail to understand the phrase in bold. Will be grateful for any help.

Thanks

om

rukmani
