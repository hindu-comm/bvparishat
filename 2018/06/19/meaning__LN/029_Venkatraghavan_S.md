To add one point - traditionally, the teaching was done by the guru to the shiShya after the adoption of sanyAsa, in an Ashram. The idea was that the guru is physically present to ensure that the shiShya is on the right path and does not harm himself. This is especially true for yogic practice. The student to whom this was taught was tested first before such knowledge was imparted - for his own good.

  

That is why you will not see a one size fits all approach of prescribing yoga to all and sundry. This does not mean that it has no place within advaita, rather, it means that some aspects of it are taught to those that need it, in a regulated setting.
