Namaste,

Shankaracharya does not refute the yogic system of practice - in fact he says in the brahma sUtra"सांख्ययोगौहिपरमपुरुषार्थसाधनत्वेनलोकेप्रख्यातौ,शिष्टैश्चपरिगृहीतौ,लिङ्गेनचश्रौतेनोपबृंहितौ" - sAmkhya and yoga are well recognised in the world as means for the achievement of the ultimate goal, they are accepted by the shiShTas (people whose actions and views can be relied upon as authoritative and valid) and are supported by various indications in the shruti.

  

He goes on to add "निराकरणंतु—नसांख्यज्ञानेनवेदनिरपेक्षेणयोगमार्गेणवानिःश्रेयसमधिगम्यतइति;श्रुतिर्हिवैदिकादात्मैकत्वविज्ञानादन्यन्निःश्रेयससाधनंवारयति—‘तमेवविदित्वातिमृत्युमेतिनान्यःपन्थाविद्यतेऽयनाय’ (श्वे. उ. ३। ८)इति;द्वैतिनोहितेसांख्यायोगाश्चनात्मैकत्वदर्शिनः।"The refutation is limited to the view that liberation is attainable through the knowledge of sAmkhya or practice of yoga **independently**of the vedas. The upaniShads themselves refute the claim that it it is possible to be liberated with any knowledge other than the knowledge of the absolute unity of the self. 'Knowing Him alone, does one goes beyond death.There is no other path to traverse" (shve. up. 3.8) . The followers of sAmkhya and yoga are dualists and they do not perceive the absolute unity of the self.

  

येनत्वंशेननविरुध्येते,तेनेष्टमेवसांख्ययोगस्मृत्योःसावकाशत्वम्; The aspects (of these systems) that do not contradict (the veda), they are acceptable indeed, and their applications of the yoga and sAmkhya scriptures is in those aspects. He is invoking the sAvakAsha-niravakAsha principle of mImAmsa to say that one does not run into the charge of denying the validity of all sAmkhya-yoga scripture, for their utility in the advaita interpretation lies in those aspects that are not contradictory to vedAnta.  

  

That is the basic premise of this response - to say that advaita vedAnta has no room for yogic practice or sAmkhya theory is simply not true. There are several instances within the prasthAna traya bhAShyas where their practical / theoretical utility has been expressly acknowledged. However, the main area of differences are

1) The unity of the self in advaita versus the multiplicity of puruShas in sAmkhya-yoga

2) The acceptance that creation proceeds from a sentient creator (Brahman with mAyA shakti) in advaita versus the insentient, pradhAna led creation in sAmkhya

3) Ultimate reality of the one self (with mAya / avidyA as an ontologically inexpressible, anirvachanIya, principle depending on the self for its reality) in advaita versus the independent reality of the puruSha and pradhAna of sAmkhya-yoga (pluralism)

4) The means of liberation is the cognition of that independent reality in advaita whereas the means of liberation is the practice of the eight-limbed process of yoga

  

Is it possible to integrate yogic practice into advaita sAdhana? Absolutely so, and it has been acknowledged not just in AchArya's works, but in several works by post Sankara AchAryas - such as the jIvanmuktiviveka of vidyAraNya svAminah, guDArtha dIpika of madhusUdana sarasvati svAminah etc. The utility of these philosophies and practices in the preparation of the mind has been accepted within the broad advaita tradition.

  

However, we have to call a spade a spade - there are basic differences between advaita and sAmkhya/yoga which cannot be overlooked if liberation is the ultimate aim.
