Namaste



**On the expression : \< tyaktānādisetavo'andhagolāṅgūlam gr̥hītvā…> **



1. Devanagari Reading for convenience : **त्यक्त ऽ नादिसेतवो- अन्धगोलाङ्गूलम् गृहीत्वा.**

****

**2. त्यक्त (= Having dropped/ rejected / given up) - अनादि (=
ancient, beginning less, traditional ) -सेतवः ( = Bridge of Knowledge and practice) -- अन्ध (= Blind) -गो-(Cow) -लाङ्गूलं (= tail )
-गृहीत्वा ( = holding on to it) **

****

**3. Vijnana Bhikshu seems to be critically chastising ‘ modern advaitins’ (= ते ) of his context and time , who, have given up (=त्यक्त )the ancient tradition of understanding the texts , after having come under the influence of TIME (=काल-दोषेण ) inflicted by
evil influneces ( - विपरीततया -- has corrupted the pure stream of
knowledge). **

****

** Vijnana bhikshu seems to draw a veiled reference to the practice of ‘ giving a cow as ‘ daanam’ in the last rites (= anthyeshti). The belief is that the deceased will hold the tail of the cow and cross the river of death (= vaitarini) ; in other words, the cow will be the swim-boat for the decesased to cross over the tortuous deadly river called vaitarini . **

** So, the ‘ smart and intelligent ritual practitioner’ , performing the ritual here on earth, would give a ‘blind cow as a charity’ here. The logic is ‘ to swim across vaitarini, the cow does not need
physical eyes. And for the deceased, the blindness of cow here on earth does not matter in the journey to corss over vaitarini, as he/she
is holding to the tail of the (blind) cow ! The cow will take care of finding the right path to swim across and reach the other end of the river. **

****

** Like wise, the ‘ modern advaitin’ presents the ‘ blinded advaita- knowledge’ (अन्ध -गो ) teaching to the students and say ‘ The ultimate liberation is through the ‘ mahaa-vaakya- Jnana’ ( = symbolized the technical meaning of ‘गो’ ); Blindly Catch hold of the tail ( = लाङ्गूलं ) , the meaning of the mahaavaakya ( like ‘ I am That) and believe that this will lead to the ‘ final liberation’ ( Moksha / Jnana/ Nirvana / Kaivalya ). Such modern teachings and teachers have rejected the critcal importance of ‘ yoga-practices that need to be foundation of ‘ Swaadhyaaya’ practice ( PYS- 2-1) in the form of ‘ Tapas and Ishwara-Pranidhana’ augmented by diligent practice of yogaangas. This is ‘ Yoga-Shaastra- Yonitva’ of ‘ Brahma Jijnyaasaa (Vedanta Shaastra’. **

** **

****

Vijnana bhikshu , like many other ancient Master, wields word-swords, like hot-knife penetrating a mass of butter , very powerfully to defend the tradition from the ‘soft-peddlers’ through ‘ It’s OK ‘ approach ! Should this be called an expression of ‘ satvic anger or
arrogance’ is a personal judgment !
