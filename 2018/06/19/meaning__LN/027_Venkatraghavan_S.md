Sri Harsha ji,

Re your last question, the previous jagadguru of the Sringeri ShArada pITha, HH Sri Abhinava Vidyateertha svAminah was himself a yogi par excellence.

  

His life and experience (which you can read in this, frankly astounding, book - <http://svfonline.net/yoga-enlightenment-and-perfection.html>) is a testimony to the integration of yogic practice within the advaita tradition. I can safely say that there is no greater authority on advaita vedanta than the Sringeri jagadguru.

  

It was once explained to me by my guru that yoga is not stressed to some students because without a certain level of maturity, there is the temptation for one to get lost in the pursuit of siddhis, which once experienced are quite difficult obstacles to overcome. Thus, depending on the capability of the student, yoga is prescribed to those to whom it is likely to benefit most, and not prescribed to those that it is likely to harm.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
