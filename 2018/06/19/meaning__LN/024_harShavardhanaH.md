Sir,

  

It seems to me that Vedanta and Samkhya-Yoga differ fundamentally in their approaches to pramaana (proof, or valid method of knowing), which is the basis of all cognition and inquiry.

  

Samkhya-Yoga gives primacy to reasoning (anumaana) only, thereby propounding the (essentially 25 but practically - ) 23 tattvas (that other traditions accept), avidya as the beginningless cause of conjunction of purusa, the efficient cause, and pradhaana, the material cause.

  

Vedanta gives primacy to Sruti/Agama only, and uses reasoning solely to substantiate the statements of the Upanisads. Hence the propounding of Brahman as everything (existing in the beginning and the end, therefore in the middle as well), and the interpretations of phenomenal creation as illusion (Avidya due to Maya (adhyasa) - Sankara), seemingly-different-but-not-actually-different (visistadvaita - Ramanuja, bhedabheda - Vijnanabhikshu), or really-different-now-but-will-merge-finally (bhakti movements, dvaita systems). This difference in interpretation is because the Sruti (Upanisads) do not speak unequivocally (they say different things from various viewpoints). So basing oneself on the mimamsa maxim of taking the entire Vedic corpus as one sentence of settled/clear meaning, different acharyas have propounded different traditions in the overall Vedanta family to harmonize the differences in the Upanisads.

  

But Vedanta does not dismiss reasoning as long as it does not contradict Sruti/Agama, and Samkhya-Yoga do not dismiss Sruti/Agama (aaptavachana) as long as they are in consonance with reasoning. Then, taking the spirit of the RigVedic maxim "Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti" to heart, is it not permissible to accept/admit that both systems state the truth in different ways? I am aware that by saying this I am coming close to the Jain concept of Syaadvaada, but I am remiss to dismiss any system.

  

In my view, Vijnanabhikshu has done this very thing. In bhedabheda, he found the means to harmonize Sruti and anumaana, scriptures and reasoning, Vedanta and Samkhya-Yoga. Thus, there is no contradiction or diffidence any longer in admitting practices from Yoga tradition to ascend/conquer the tattvas from Samkhya tradition to attain/realize Brahman from Vedanta tradition. This presents a better picture to my mind than the rigid, unyielding kevaladvaita interpretation, which creates as many problems as it solves.

  

Your comments would be gratefully received.

  

regards

Harsha
