I have sometimes wondered if Brahmasutras 2.1.1-3 should be interpreted in this manner:

  

SUTRA 2.1.1 \[In case of Smritis conflicting on overlapping matters\]: If you say that there will be no scope left for the Smritis, we refute this because there will be no scope left for other Smritis as well. The Siddhanta-paksha idea is that Smritis like Bahrspatya etc. have distinctive viewpoints that are in conflict with analogous views of other Smritis like Manu Dharmashastra and Mahabharata. Therefore the Purvapakshin cannot hide behind the argument that our Smritis too must be admitted as authority.

  

SUTRA 2.1.2 \[In case of the distinctive doctrines taught only in the rejected Smritis\]: Of these other (doctrines unique to the rejected Smritis), we find non existence in the Shruti. \[The idea is that the distinctive doctrines not only contradict the Vedic Smritis, they also do not have any Shruti support. So one cannot hide behind the Purva Mimamsa argument that 'virodhe tu anapekshyam asati hi anumaanam'\].

  

SUTRA 2.2.3: Therefore, by this, the combination of the two sets of teachings in conflicting Smritis is also refuted. Or, we cannot treat the conflicting teachings as complimentary to each other in order to accept both the sets of Smritis. Therefore, I do not think this Sutra refers to Yogadarshana as such.

  

Thereafter, this Paada first refutes the Shishta Chaarvaakas who try to find a Vedic basis for consciousness. The Sutrakaara refutes their erroneous interpretations ('abhimaanivyapadeshaastu vishesha anugatibhyaam'). Thereafter, he summarily dismissions dhuurta chaarvakas who are not respected even by the learned or shishta chaarvaakas (etena shishtaaparigraha...). Shankaracharya things that this sutra (etena shishtaa...) refers to Vaisheshikas but that might not be so.

  

After this, the remaining portion of the Paada refutes Nireeshvara Samkhya. Interestingly, many of the Purvapaksha arguments in these sections can be seen as Siddhantas in the Yuktidipika commentary on Samkhya Karikas.

  

The Gudhaarthadipika is a very scholarly Bhashya on the Gita which should to be read along with the Shridhari Tika on the Gita. In the former. Madhusudana Sarasvati gives an extensive commentary on many Patanjala Yoga Sutras and subsequently towards the end (whereafter he stops elaborating on Patanjala Yoga), he clearly states that Ashtanga Yoga is of limited utilities to Paramahamsa Advaitins because they focus on meditating upon the Mahavakyas. This is a notable statement, in line with what Yoga Upanishads like the Shandilya Upanishad also declare - that there are two ways to meditate: the Vedantic, and that of Ashtanga Yoga. The Vaidiks accept the latter in so far as their object is meditation on Brahman, and the supreme goal is Brahman. Which is why in Smarta Yoga scriptures like the Brihadyoga-Yajnavalkya, most of the Angas are discussed with sometimes a distinctive twist, and combined with Smarta-Vaidik practices like Sandhya Vandana, Gayatri Japa. This mode of Yoga was apparently quite well accepted in the past, and Bhaskara Bhatta alludes to it repeatedly in his Gita Bhashya. He quotes verses from Yogashastra in his commentaries on Gita as well as Brahmasutra, but these verses are not available in any extant text. He refers to 'Yogashastras by Sanaka and others." The Patanjala Kaivalya is different from Vedantic Kaivalya. The Vedantic-ness of Gita lies in the fact that it relegates this state of merely going beyond the Gunas to a state of lower Moksha, and taking recourse to Prabrahman/ Akshara/ Uttama Purusha as the ultimate, higher eternal Moksha.

  

Apologies for responding to a question that was addressed to Dr B V K Shastry.
