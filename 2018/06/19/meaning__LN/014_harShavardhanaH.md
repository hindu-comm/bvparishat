Sriram ji, very apt quotation!

  

***The rosary-veil ever in hand, closing the eyes from time to time, prattling that “everything is Brahman,” these are the causes for instant confidence // giving immediate proof of efficacy.*** - trans. by Somadeva Vasudeva.

  

Swami Vivekananda touched upon something similar, when he said that on the path of religion 95% become cheats, and the rest 5% go mad - or something similar.
