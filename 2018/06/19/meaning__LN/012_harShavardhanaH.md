Madam,

  

If it is not inconvenient to you, kindly do consider sharing your paper with us when you have completed it. Till now, the English-speaking world's acquaintance with Vijnanabhikshu (VB) on the BrahmaSutras has only been through the medium of Andrew J Nicholson's summary of VB's bhedAbheda interpretation.

  

Also, Dr BVK's explanation of the sentence is excellent.

  

kind regards

Harsha
