Bhikṣu is writing in the age of bhakti i.e.16th century when bhakti was at its height. Even Madhusūfdana Saraswati as we know who lived more or less in the same period, accommodated bhakti in his advaita interpretation. Bhikṣu promotes a version of advaita called "avibhāga-advaita" and is opposed to Śaṅkarācārya's many advaita concepts like māyā/avidyā, pañcīkaraṇa, nature of mokṣa where Bhikṣu tries to accommodate Sāṁkhya Yoga ideas etc, etc. I am engaged presently in an annotated English translation of the first five sūtras of Bhikṣu's Vijñānāmr̥tabhāṣyam which is a commentary on the BS sūtras I.1.1-5 and it is quite a revelation.

Thank you all for your help and especially B.V.K. śāstriji for his detailed explanation.
