This is not a paper but will be published as a book when I have completed it. Meanwhile if you are interested in the approach of Bhikṣu to advaita philosophy please look at my two papers published in The ICPR journals titled "Vijñānabhikṣu: A Maverick philosopher"in Journal of Indian Council for Philosophical Research, Oct-Dec 2007, Vol. XXIV Number 4,  and "Vijñānabhikṣu: The Sāṁkhya-Yoga-Vedāntācārya "in Journal of IndianCouncil for Philosophical Research, July-Sept. 2010, Vol. 27pp 21-38.

Kanshi Ram also has a book on Bhikṣu; sorry cannot recollect the title.
