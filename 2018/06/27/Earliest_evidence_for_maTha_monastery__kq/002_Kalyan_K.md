In shAnti parva of mahAbhArata, it is mentioned that nara and nArAyaNa rishis were doing tapas for the sake of Vishnu at Badari ashram. Neither of them had a wife. There is also an account of the visit of nArada to this ashram in the shAnti parva. But this may not fall into the category of a maTha as there is no mention of any of their disciples.
