"maTha" in the time of Amarakos'a (3-4th cent CE) was only a residential school or hostel. मठश्छात्रादि निलयो (puravarga v.8). It is most likely the word acquired its extra meaning later as seen in the Vai. kosha of Yadavaprakasha (11th cent.). This text lists both the meanings; first in the (puraadhyaaya) as छात्रादिवास . Later in the (शेषकाण्ड लिङ्गसङ्ग्रहाध्याय ) मठी स्थाने तपस्विनाम् \|\| as a word that can be used in all the three genders. It would be interesting to know where in the Arthas'aastra the word is used meaning 'monastery'.

Thanks
