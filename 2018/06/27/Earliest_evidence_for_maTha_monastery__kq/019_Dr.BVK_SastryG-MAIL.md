Namaste



On \< संन्यास-योगात् - यतयः \> : Acharya is right in the commentary \< how it is commented: संन्यासयोगात् सर्वकर्मपरित्यागलक्षणयोगात्.. >.

 Acharya does not seem to bring the intention of ‘ Shruti’ to the ‘ varna-ashrama dharma shaastra social model and life style’.



1. IF ‘ Sannyasa’ in the given text passage is interpreted as ‘an aashrama’, THEN



1.1 ) ‘Ashrama’ is a life style status in a social/ family context , open for all ( i.e. in this case *chaaturvarnya* related Yoga guidance
on individuals aachaara – vichaara –vihaara – cheshtaa- karma – swapnaavabodha). What would then be ‘**Sannyasa- aashrama**’ for each ‘specific Varna’ ( - the contentious issue that comes here would be the Sannyasa for ‘ Shudra’).



1.2.) How will the Gita chapter-18 title be constructed : ‘Moksha Sannyasa Yoga’ ? 



1.3) What would then be the interpretation of the Gita passages like


 ‘yata indriya manaH buddhiH **muniH mOkSha parAyaNaH** \| vigata icChA bhaya krOdhaH yaH sadA mukta eva saH \|\| 5.28 \|\|



 kāmyānāḿ ***karmaṇāḿ*** nyāsaḿ ***sannyāsaḿ*** kavayo viduh (Gita 18-2) where ‘Sannyasa and Yoga are seen distinct ?

 and certainly not limited to ‘Ashrama –Dharma’ ?



1.4) What would the term ‘ karma – sannyasa’ in Gita 5-1 mean : 

 **sannyasam karmanam krsna, punar yogam ca samsasi , **

** yac chreya etayor ekam, tan me bruhi su-niscitam **

****

** Why Arjuna thinks there is a choice for a best amongst the three for a selection ?**



*Points to contemplate*:



Why Shruti tied together ‘sannyasa (Dharma)- Yoga ( anushaasanam)
and yati ( aashrama - anushthaana)’ ?



Why a locking binding pre-condition for ‘ yati’s to be ‘ Vedanta – Vijnana – Sunischitaarthah’ ?



When ‘ Dharma Shaastra specific meaning of ‘ashrama’ = a specific life style of observances, professions and is transported to a new shift and switch model of contemporary thinking as ‘ saffron wearing social worker, working for an institutional brand promotion, as a professional
and life style for profession, the meaning of ‘Shruti’ intended for guidance on appropriate ‘upaasanaa - saadhanaa- - aaraadhanaa’ (= Tapas, Swaadhyaaya, Ishwara-pranidhana, Kriyaa) gets lost !



This is the ‘ decadence of Samskrutham to Sanskrit ’ when the ‘ yoga component’ is disconnected. And for any sensitive person, it would be obvious that there is ‘ NO (Social or Institutional) BATTLE to RESTORE THIS SAMSKRUTHAM’ ! The focus of battle is directed elsewhere .



Samskrutham is Yoga- Refined and cultured Articulation, the ‘ Vak- yoga’.
