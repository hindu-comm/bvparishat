Namaste

  

We find today there are many maTha-s of all sampradayas. A maTha is headed by a Sannyasin. Advaitins, Vishsitadvaitins and Dvaitins have maTha-s. Madhva is said to have himself established eight maTha-s. So do Advaitins believe Shankara himself established maTha-s. Is there evidence for maTha-s in our earliest texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, or any other? The mention of Kanva ashrama, Bharadwaja ashrama, etc. are not maTha-s as they were headed by Rishis who lived with their wife.

  

Any information on this topic is welcome.

  

Thanks.
