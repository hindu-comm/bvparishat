\> Sri Adi Sankaracharya is quoted to have said "माठापत्यं मा भूत्" and the current Sankaracharyas refer to their monasteries as "आम्नायपीठाः". This makes me think that usages like "शङ्करमठः" could be of a later date and perhaps largely colloquial.

  

------- pITha and maTha are not the same or similar concepts.

  

S'aaradaapITha can be there and but not S'aaradaamaTha.

  

S'aaradaapITha and s'ringErImaTha can be part of the same organisational entity.
