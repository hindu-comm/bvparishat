Namaste,

  

Inआनन्दरामायण vide 10th sarga, there is an episode of Dog approaching rAmachandra. The dog admits that it got the dog's birth because it was a muttadhipati in previous life.

  

गच्छन्ति वै शुनो योनिं सत्यमेतद्वचो मम । मया **मठाधिपत्याञ्च** लब्धा योनिः शुनः स्वयम्

  

Though, there are several variants of this episode and many have mentioned here asकुलपती. However, considering the mention of muttadhipati, I have mentioned this. However, one can always give benefit of doubt to 'ananda-ramayana' about it's arvAcheenatva.

  

rgs,

sriram
