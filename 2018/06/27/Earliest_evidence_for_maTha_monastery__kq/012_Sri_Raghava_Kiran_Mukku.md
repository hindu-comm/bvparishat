Namaste

  

I am referring to the verse quoted by Vidvan Sri Shankara. I may be diverging, and pardon me for that, but Sri Adi Sankaracharya is quoted to have said "माठापत्यं मा भूत्" and the current Sankaracharyas refer to their monasteries as "आम्नायपीठाः". This makes me think that usages like "शङ्करमठः" could be of a later date and perhaps largely colloquial.
