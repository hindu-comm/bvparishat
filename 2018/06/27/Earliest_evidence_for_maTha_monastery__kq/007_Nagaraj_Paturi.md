In texts such as itihaasas and puraNas, maThas were not mentioned.

  

In douments such as inscriptions and in books such as arthas'aastra maThas are mentioned.

  

---------------------------

  

Did buddhists call their manasteries maThas?

  

If not, maTha must be a non-Buddhist terminology.

  

If the word and the concept are pre-Sankara and S'ankara used them, we can say S'ankara borrowed them from the non-Buddhist tradition that was prevalent.

  

It could be a post-S'ankara borrowing into Advaita tradition.

  

Since it was not an exclusively Advaitic concept , other Vedantic traditions too incorporated it. We can also say, since other Vedantic traditions too incorporated it, it was not an exclusively Advaitic concept.
