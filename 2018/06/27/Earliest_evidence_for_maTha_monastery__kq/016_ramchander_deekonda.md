Respected scholars,

  

I would like to share some information regarding a Sankara maTha that existed in Afghanistan (Kandhahar). It is known to many oldies of Hyderabad that there existed a Sankara maTha in Kandhahar region of Afghanistan. It is said that this was established by Sankara and the heads of this maTha were titled "Giris" of dashnami of tradition.

  

When Islam entered Afghanistan and Hindus and Buddhists were persecuted, oral tradition has it, that this maTha was relocated to Ujjain and later to Pune. This maTha had possessed enoromous wealth in the form of gold, precious diamonds etc. It is recorded that when the Peshwas eyed the riches of this maTha, the Giris fled and took asylum in the neighbouring Nizam's domain. The fifth Nizam, granted them several acres of land in the present Begum Bazar area of Hyderabad, where they constructed their maTha and temples.

  

Later, the disciples of this math accepted grihasthashram and built fabulous palaces in Hyderabad and Bombay and became industrialists.
They were conferred the status of nobles in the court of Nizams. Raja Dhanraj Gir and Raja Pratap Gir are well-known names of Hyderabad. They are also known as Gosais/goswamis.

  

The purpose of the above account is to highlight the fact that there were Sankara maThas outside the Indian sub-continent as well.

  

  

Regards,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
