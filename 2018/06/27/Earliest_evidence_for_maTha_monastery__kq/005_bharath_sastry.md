Namaste

  

As far I know,there are no references or existence of maTha-s in the olden period.

  

Even we don't find exclusive sannyasa ashrama in the vedic period. Maximum it was vanaprastha ashrama(being in the forests,only rishis used to stay),only after Sri Adi Shankaracharya's avatara he formalised sannyasa ashrama(dashanaami order) hence maTHa-s came into existence.

  

Regards

Bharath Sastry
