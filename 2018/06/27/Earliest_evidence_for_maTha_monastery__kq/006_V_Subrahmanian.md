Even I think so and would like to check out.

There is mention of sannyasa ashrama in the Veda/Upanishad. The famous
'न कर्मणा न प्रजया..... ‘वेदान्तविज्ञानसुनिश्चितार्थाःसंन्यासयोगाद्यतयः शुद्धसत्त्वाः’ occurs in the Mahanarayana and Mundaka Upanishads. The Jabala Upaishad that Shankaracharya cites also has 'मुण्डोऽपरिग्रहः.'
Now the question is whether they were strictly parivrajaka-s, nomadic monks, or were there monasteries to house them.

There is a belief that Shankaracharya revived this Ashrama (= sannyasa order).
