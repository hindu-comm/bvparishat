That said , let me ask aayushmaan Debarshi to take the help of senior members of the forum like Prof, Madhav Deshpande and Prof. Ashok Aklujkar who have hands on experience and knowledge in the issue that aayushmaan Debarshi is interested in.

  

Debarshi beta, you may contact these professors by taking their ids from the list.

  

Any other member who has expertise in guiding a student with such aspirations may also reach out to him and help him.

  

If you share your guidance on the list, that may help kids with similar aspirations.

  

--------------------

  

Aayushmaan Debarshi, you may have to pursue a PhD from an American or Canadian university even if you possess a PhD from here.

  

Usual jobs are teaching and research jobs in universities only.

  

As you know they are not that big numer as say IT jobs or Medical jobs. Competition could also be less.

  

----------------------

  

If you succeed in your efforts to join a PhD there, please don't succumb to any pressure to malign Sanskrit, India or Hinduism, if you face any.

  

Bring good name to you, your parents, your state in India, India, Sanskrit and Hinduism.

  

Best wishes,
