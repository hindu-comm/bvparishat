As a general note, just think of the analogy of saying " I want to buy a product suited for my requirement. I did not get it in India. Can you please tell me if I can get it abroad?" and the difference of this from saying " I want to buy some product from abroad. Can you suggest which product to buy and how to buy?"

  

Similarly you did not say "I am not able to get these studies in India. Can I get them abroad?" Your goal is to go abroad, study there and/or work there. How to use Sanskrit (related) studies for that purpose is the question you have.  

  

You are talking to a forum where highly accomplished Sanskrit scholars staying and teaching in India are the guiding spirit and are making "abroad" as a better 'brand' than India in this regard. Did you think of how it feels to the highly accomplished Sanskrit scholars staying and teaching in India?

  

It is a sad state of affairs that in the hierarchy of the contemporary social order, one of the criteria for any occupation/profession to get a higher position in the hierarchy it needs to be the one providing an opportunity to go abroad and live abroad. Thus for Sanskrit studies too, for it to be attractive to students, teachers must sell it using the criteria that it helps the students go abroad. Parents are to be persuaded on these lines. Students persuaded on these lines to join Sanskrit courses would naturally keep pestering the teachers who sold the courses that way, to provide that opportunity. In many cases, such mundane wishes are nursed secretly in their heart and love for Sanskrit etc., are projected outside. In cases like that of this boy, the idea is frankly, transparently and clearly expressed.

  

If these students say, your teaching here does not have such and such features that the teachers abroad have or your courses do not have such and such areas or aspects that the courses abroad have, Sanskrit teachers in India can try to change their teaching or courses. But if the fascination of the students is for the financial benefits and living conditions abroad , what can Sanskrit teachers do anything about it?
