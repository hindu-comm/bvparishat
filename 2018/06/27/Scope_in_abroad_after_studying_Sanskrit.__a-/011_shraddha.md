Respected friend,  

Debarshi Ji,  

I am Shraddha M Modi.  
  

Just like you i am also a student doing my PhD and i also had faced the same problems as you are facing..and i also have the same aspiration as you have.  
  

But trust me these problems give us the inspiration that we (Students like you and me who wish to bwcome professor in Sanskrit)  

should make it a point that the problems through which we suffered our next generation, our would be students should not suffer from the same.  
  

This group has many scholars and all are very supportive and affectionate and v are fortunate to have been able to get the blessings of all such great mentors..  
  

Dont be disheartened., stay positive as the darkness suggests that light is somewhere on its way and will reach to you soon.  
  

9510163881  

Is my whatsapp number, m sure together we can sail through easily.  

Regards.  

Shraddha.
