Acharya Nagaraj ji,

I prefer to do PhD in India. But want to go abroad for more research work. How do my dream become possible ??? Again Acharya, I heard that to go to abroad after PhD, I have to publish my articles in many reputed journals. I need a list of journals too as I can send my articles to the publishers. They do scrutiny and if everything goes smoothly than surely it'll publish. Please Acharya, show me a path.
