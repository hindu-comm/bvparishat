Sorry Sir, You just made my conception clear. I'll definitely upgrade myself with such valuable advices. Sir, honestly speaking, I was become frustrated when I didn't get books or informations that I need. But here I get a platform to share my thoughts. My language in English isn't good enough I know & I need to polish it. But NAGARAJ SIR, just don't take it by heart. I just want to know about this field. My intention isn't to hurt anyone. As an Student of everyone in this group, I am really sorry.

I am happy too actually as a member of this group . Everyone taught me very beautifully. Like a father taught his son or daughter making all conceptions clear. So please keep replying to my posts. I'll be very glad.

Special Thanks to Nagaraj Sir-

  

Regards

DEBARSHI
