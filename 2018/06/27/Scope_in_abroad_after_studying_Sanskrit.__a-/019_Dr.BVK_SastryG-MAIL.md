Namaste



The thread is addressing some intriguing issues which I need some help in understanding ‘Why and How of Sanskrit for 21^(st) century India ? How to groom next generation Sanskrit Schoalrs who are active team members of Battle: Sanskrit ?



The passages identified below with highlights ! How do we as ‘ team of Samskruth lovers find a VINIYOGA = Application Utility for the Language of Gods in the Global mortal market’? 



**Shraddha** : Just like you i am also a student doing my PhD and i also had faced the same problems as you are facing..and i also have the same aspiration as you have. But trust me these problems give us the inspiration that we (Students like you and me who wish to bwcome professor in Sanskrit) should make it a point that the problems through which we suffered our next generation, our would be students should not suffer from the same.



**Nagaraj Paturi** : 



(a) You are talking to a forum where highly accomplished Sanskrit scholars staying and teaching in India are the guiding spirit and are making "abroad" as a better 'brand' than India in this regard. Did you think of how it feels to the highly accomplished Sanskrit scholars staying and teaching in India?

(b) It is a sad state of affairs that in the hierarchy of the contemporary social order, one of the criteria for any occupation/profession to get a higher position in the hierarchy it needs to be the one providing an opportunity to go abroad and live abroad. Thus for Sanskrit studies too, for it to be attractive to students, teachers must sell it using the criteria that it helps the students go abroad. 

(c ) Parents are to be persuaded on these lines. Students persuaded on these lines to join Sanskrit courses would naturally keep pestering the teachers who sold the courses that way, to provide that opportunity. In many cases, such mundane wishes are nursed secretly in their heart and love for Sanskrit etc., are projected outside. In cases like that of this boy, the idea is frankly, transparently and clearly expressed.

(d ) If these students say, your teaching here does not have such and such features that the teachers abroad have or your courses do not have such and such areas or aspects that the courses abroad have, Sanskrit teachers in India can try to change their teaching or courses. But if the fascination of the students is for the financial benefits and living conditions abroad , what can Sanskrit teachers do anything about it?
