Namaste,

  

As perमन्त्रमहोदधिः:

  

सरसीरुहस्थं - Seated on lotus (there is also pAtha-bhEda as 'पद्मस्थं')

  

In right hands - ankusha & modaka pAtra (अंकुशमोदकपात्रदक्षयोः)

  

In left hands - pAsha & danta

  

While doing dhyAna, one should visualise the right hands and then left.
Also, I am told that order of hands is bottom-up approach (don't remember the exact ref. now)

  

rgs,

sriram
