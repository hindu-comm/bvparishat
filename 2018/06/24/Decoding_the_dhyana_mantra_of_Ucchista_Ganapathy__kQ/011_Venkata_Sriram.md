Sir,

  

There is no 'loss of tradition'. It is still vibrant in closed circles and I am personally aware of them who practice with pristine purity.
Shri.Sacchidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Mahaswamiji revived this upAsana in sringeri and is handed down traditionally.

  

Also, shrI chidAnandanAtha (shrIvidyA vAchaspati subramaNya Iyer) attained siddhi in this by doing japa in Thiruvarur. There is a ucchiSTa-ganesha temple inside the premises and I had great fortune of visiting that. The tradition of shrI subramaNya Iyer is still continuing till date.......

  

This specific ganeshOpAsana is done for vAk siddhi in astrological predictions and the master-brain behind 'Krishnamurthy Paddhati' did this upAsana.

  

rgs,

sriram
