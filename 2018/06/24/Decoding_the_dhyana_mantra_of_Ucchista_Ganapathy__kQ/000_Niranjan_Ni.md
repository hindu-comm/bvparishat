Dear List members,

  

I have 2 issues that need resolution. Please help.

  

In the attached file is an image of a dhyana shloka of Ucchista Ganapathy in Sanskrit and English.

  

My questions are as follows:

  

1\. Does Sarasiruhastham indicate seated in padmasana or seated on a Lotus? The ENglish translation in the attached image gives the former interpretation.

  

2\. Also, pAshAmkushau modaka pAtradantau is given without reference to which hands the pAsha, ankusha, modaka pAtra and danta are held in. The English translation seems to effortlessly approtion the appropriate instrument to the appropriate hand. Is that warranted or creative license?

  

3\. In such dhyana shlokas is there a schema to decide whether the left or the right tusk of Ganapathi is broken?

  

Thanks,
