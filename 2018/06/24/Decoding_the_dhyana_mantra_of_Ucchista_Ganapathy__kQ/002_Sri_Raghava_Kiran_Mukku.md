Namaste Shri Niranjan ji

  

Based on my understanding:

1.  सरसीरुहस्थम् means the one seating on a lotus, which could referto
    the seat of मूलाधारचक्रम् (Ref: मूलाधारक्षेत्रस्थितम् as referred
    toby Muttusvāmi Dīkṣita in his composition वातापि गणपतिं भजेऽहम्).
    I am not aware of any iconography where Ganapati is sitting in the
    Lotus pose (पद्मासनस्थम्).  
2.  पाशाङ्कुशौ and मोदकपात्रदन्तौ are held in the upper two hands and
    lower two hands respectively (going by the grouping in the
    word-compound). However, to me, what is held on the right side and
    what is held on the left is not clear from the verse. Different
    verses for meditation (ध्यानश्लोकाः) follow different conventions in
    describing the order of adornments/weapons held by various hands.
    For example, you may refer to the two contrasting verses
    मुक्ताविद्रुमहेमनीलधवलच्छायैः of गायत्री and शान्तं पद्मासनस्थं of
    शिव.  
3.  On the third question, or for that matter for any specific query on
    iconography, the texts of शिल्पशास्त्रम्need to be referred to. You
    may refer to oneŚrītattvanidhi of Krishnaraja Wodeyar to start
    with. Learned scholars on this list may provide pointers on other
    texts on the subject.
