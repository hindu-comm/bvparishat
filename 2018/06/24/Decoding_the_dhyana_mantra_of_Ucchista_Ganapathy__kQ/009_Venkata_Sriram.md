Namaste,

  

I don't have any experiences and experienced any miracles. My daily route is to do sandhya, brahmayajna, pArAyaNa of aupAsana mantras and devatArchana.

  

shrI bhAskararaya too mentioned (vide khadyota) about the mantra japa of ucchiSTa ganesha by eating modakaas. These are mantra shastra niyamas that are introduced for siddhi. For instance, once gets quick siddhi of shyAmala & mAtangi mantra when chanted with betel leaf (paan) inside the mouth and by conducting sangeeta kacheris, respecting with due rewards to musicians, veena players (vaiNikAs) etc.

  

The ucchiSTa-chaNDali mantra is yields quick results when women of chaNDAla-jAti are given due respect (also washerwomen).

  

However, the secret & esoteric essence of 'ucchiSTa' (the residue (शेष)) lies in decoding the 'ucchiSTa-sukta' of Atharva-veda. shrI gaNapati muni too demystifies the secret in 'herambopasthAnam'.

  

For gaNapati muni, the ucchiSTa-gaNapati is the 'vaikhari-vAk' that comes out in association with saliva and hence 'ucchiSTa-vAk-tattva' in the form of 'vaikhari'. This vAk can only come out with the help of tongue and has similarity with 'muSaka'. The entire anthropomorphic form of gaNapati with muSaka is nothing but 'vaikhari-nAda' in the form of creation.

  

rgs,

sriram
