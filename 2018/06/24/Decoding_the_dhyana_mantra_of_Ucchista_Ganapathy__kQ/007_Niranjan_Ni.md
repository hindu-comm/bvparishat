Thank you for your inputs Shri Raghava ji, Shri Nagaraj ji and Shri Sriram ji.

  

The photo in question is actually from the Mantramahodadhi by Ram Kumar Rai. I did notice that sarasiruhastham was interpreted as sitting on a lotus elsewhere and was written as padmasana in this hence the confusion.

  

By pAtha bedha you mean the core text has different words in dhyana shloka?

  

Since you seem familiar with the mantra, may I enquire if you have any experiences you can share and tips on do's and don'ts regarding worship of Shri Ucchista Ganesha?

  

It is clearly mentioned in text to chew on betel or laddus while doing japa, but generally in mantra practise, food is prohibited atleast 2 hours before and 1 hour after japa. I guess the idea is to activate the prana within muladhara by eating laddus?
