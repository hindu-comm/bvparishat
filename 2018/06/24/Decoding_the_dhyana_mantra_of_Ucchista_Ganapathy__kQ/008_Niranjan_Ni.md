Dear Sir,

  

If I was on speaking terms with Ucchista Ganapathi, I would not have bothered with this question.

  

I understand that the process requires panchopachara puja to a mentally constructed form of Ganesha that aligns with the dhyana shloka. If the end goal of mantra siddhi is reached, why would anyone bother with a mental construct?

  

The core idea is to align with the process as far as possible so that the end goal is not missed.
