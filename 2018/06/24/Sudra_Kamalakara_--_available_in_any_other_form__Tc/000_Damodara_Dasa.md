Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I have Sudra Kamalakara book (Link):  
<https://archive.org/details/Shudrakamalakara>  
  
It is a hand written manuscript. Is this already rendered as a printed  
book (either in sanskrit or even with translations)? It is difficult  
for me to read hand written manuscript as I am not practiced to it.  
  
Also if it is still not rendered as printed book, is there any other  
typed form available? Or if you know someone who can help me getting  
it scribed?  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
