Dr. Maheswarii is right Exoticindiaart.com are a reliable supplier. One does get out of print books with them. I have ordered with them them in the past and they are good.

There are a few more indological suppliers online such as <http://saujanyabooks.com/> <http://www.vedamsbooks.in/> also who are prompt and responsive. Recently <http://chaukhambabooks.in/> are very efficient. Off course they cannot beat the low prices sometimes offered by [amazon.in](http://amazon.in) or [flipkart.com](http://flipkart.com).
