Expecting the response of scholars on this issue. The prologues or prefaces of such texts just quote the references by tradition (parampara). How should the coming generation understand this.

Thanking you

1\. Even One colophon of Guru Gita manuscript refers Skanda-Purana.

2\. This same query was raised in 2011 in the same forum but there was no response for that. So forgive me to repost on the same subject.
