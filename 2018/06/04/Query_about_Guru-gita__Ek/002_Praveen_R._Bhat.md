AFAIK, the uttarakhaNDa of skandapurANa is lost but the tradition considers Gurugita as a part of the same. There are many a prayer to the Guru which is part of Guru Gita. I recall one publisher printing a note mentioning Guru Gita that they would reward anyone who can trace its source. Apologies, I forget which publication though; not that it would be helpful in this context!

  

Kind rgds,
