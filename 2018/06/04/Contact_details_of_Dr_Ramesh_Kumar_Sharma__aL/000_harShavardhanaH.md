Namaskar

  

I am trying to get in touch with Dr Ramesh Kumar Sharma of Delhi, the author of a new critical edition of the Yuktidipika, a commentary on the SamkhyaKarika of Isvarakrsna. He also conducted a workshop on the same subject at the Chinmaya International Foundation last year alongwith Dr Penna Madhusudan ofKavikualaguru Kalidasa Sanskrit University.

  

Any information about his coordinates would be much appreciated.

  

regards

Harsha
