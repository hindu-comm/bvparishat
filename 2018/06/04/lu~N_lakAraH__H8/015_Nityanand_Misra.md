Dear Prof. Deshpande

  

Yes, the Durghatavritti attempts to justify it as an optional form, but still believe it is non-Paninian. The Madhaviya Dhatuvritti lists अभैषीः alone, so do most standard grammar works.

  

<http://sanskritlibrary.org/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvscan/disp/index.php?page=439>  

  

Durghatavritti justifies many other non-standard forms. In my opinion the purpose is to show that the Paninian framework can explain those forms with परिभाषाs like आगमशास्त्रमनित्यम्, and not advocate uses of such forms.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
