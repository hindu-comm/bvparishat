Dear Nityananda Ji,

  

  Thanks for pointing to the discussion of this form in the Durghaṭavr̥tti. However, the Durghaṭavr̥tti citation of this form is not from a Purāṇic text and the Vr̥tti is trying to justify this form not as an ārṣa form, but as an optional form by saying: अगमशासनानित्यत्वात्.
Best regards.
