The Paninian form is मा भैषीः only.मा भैः is an आर्ष form which,as Prof. Deshpande has pointed out, occurs at many places in आर्ष वाङ्मय. This can be understood as follows.

  

When one looks at the form मा भैः (or अभैः in absence of माङ्), there are two things to ponder:  

  

1\) The root भी has gone वृद्धि. This वृद्धि has to be इगन्तलक्षणा वृद्धि which happens by the ruleसिचि वृद्धिः परस्मैपदेषु (७.२.१). That means there is सिच् present in the form अभैः. The सिच् occurs by च्लि लुङि (३.१.४३) and च्लेः सिच् (३.१.४४)

2\) The ईट् augment is missing after सिच् which happens by अस्तिसिचोऽपृक्ते (७.३.९६)

  

Usual process is अट् \[→ अ\] + भी \[→ भै\] + सिच् \[→ स् → ष्\] + ईट् \[→ ई\] + सिप् \[→ स्\] = अभैषीः

  

In absence of ईट्, the form is

अट् \[→ अ\] + भी \[→ भै\] + सिच् \[→ स् → ष्\] + सिप् \[→ स्\] = अभै + स् + स् = अभैः

  

The Durghatavritti discusses the form अभैः. See the attached images.  

  

Hope this helps.
