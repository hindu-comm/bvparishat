Dear Venkatraghavan garu

  

The concept of akhanDavaakyaartha is another instance of similarity between Advaita and Sabdaadvaita. It actually goes against varNavAda and shows the limitation of "vyayavahaare bhaaTTanayaH". Many critics like Vedantadesikan criticise Advaita based on this. If we adopt vaiyaakaraNanaya instead of bhaaTTanaya, such difficulties do not arise.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
