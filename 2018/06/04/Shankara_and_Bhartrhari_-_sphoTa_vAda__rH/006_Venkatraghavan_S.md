Dear Sir,

Thank you.

  

I agree with the view that the refutation of Sabdabrahman is to disassociate nirguNa brahman from Sabda, sparsha, rUpa, rasa, gandha guNas. However, does a refutation of sphoTa achieve that?

  

The context of the refutation of sphoTa vAda is based on the question of whether creation can proceed from shabda or not.

  

The vaiyAkaraNa holds that from the eternal Sabda, in the form sphoTa, the meaning emerges, which constitutes the world of actions, agents and results -तस्मान्नित्याच्छब्दात्स्फोटरूपादभिधायकात्क्रियाकारकफललक्षणंजगदभिधेयभूतंप्रभवतीति. The argument against varNavAda offered by the vaiyAkaraNa was that the letters (varNas) are themselves not eternal, and if creation sprung from such a source, the view that creation proceeding from eternal shabda would be rendered untenable.

  

The refutation by Shankaracharya is on the grounds that the non-eternality of varNa (and thus Sabda) on the basis of them having a beginning and end is flawed (on the grounds of recognition of identity of the varNas). Further, letters themselves convey meaning. His argument for this is quite ingenious - (not sure if this appears in kumArila bhaTTa's / Sabara svAmin's writings).

  

He says that the comprehension of the idea of a cow arises after the comprehension of the letters c, o, w, individually, on the basis of the letters as a whole and not on any other thing (ie sphoTa). In the comprehension of the word cow, the letter c is comprehended, but not some other letter, say d. If sphoTa, which is different from c, was the content of the comprehension, then like the letter d is ruled out from the word cow, the letter c also would have been ruled out. However, that is not the case. Thus the concept of the word meaning flows from the memory of successive letters together adding up to a whole, and not something that is extraneous to the letters themselves.

यतोऽस्यामपिबुद्धौगकारादयोवर्णाअनुवर्तन्ते,नतुदकारादयः;यदिह्यस्याबुद्धेर्गकारादिभ्योऽर्थान्तरंस्फोटोविषयःस्यात्,ततोदकारादयइवगकारादयोऽप्यस्याबुद्धेर्व्यावर्तेरन्;नतुतथास्ति;तस्मादियमेकबुद्धिर्वर्णविषयैवस्मृतिः।

  

Therefore, the crux of his argument seems to be that introducing the idea of sphoTa to convey meaning would be superfluous if the letters themselves can convey meaning(वर्णेभ्यश्चार्थप्रतीतेःसम्भवात्स्फोटकल्पनानर्थिका). Bringing it into the context of the devatAdhikaraNa, if letters are themselves eternal, and they convey meanings, the creation of devas (and the universe) from the eternal vedic words is possible.



By this much, it appears the necessity of sphoTa to convey meaning is being refuted. In fact, I would go on to say that the idea of(apparent) creation springing from Sabda (and thus Sabdabrahman) is reinforced in this bhAShya.  

  

Does the refutation of Sabdabrahman require the refutation of sphoTa, and does the refutation of sphoTa achieve the refutation of Sabdabrahman? It is not clear.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
