Sir

  

If we examine the ontology and epistemology of Mimamsa, Vyakarana and Advaita, it will be very clear that Mimamsa and Advaita are actually opposed to each other and that Vyakarana and Advaita ars extremely close, so much so that they could be said to the same thing. At any rate the difference between Advaita and Sphotavada is no more than the difference between Bhamati prasthana and Vivarana prasthana.

  

Also noteworthy is that the khanDana of Sphotavada occurs in the first adhyaya and not second adhyaya, which is reserved for paramata khandana.

  

Still it is beyond doubt that Sanakaracharya preferred Varnavada to Sphotavada (the adage vyavahaare bhaaTTanayaH came about later, first seen in Chitsukhee). What was the need? The answer is found in pratikopaasana in the fourth adhyaya. Amongst the various Brahmavidyas, Advaitins would have no problem in according Sabdayoga the highest place. The problem is that while Sabda can be a prateeka of Brahman, the reverse is not allowed. Then all sorts of avyavastha will result. People will hanker after gandhabrahman, rasabrahman, roopabrahman etc. Therefore rasaasvaadana in AlankaaraSaastra is Brahmaanandasahodaree but not Brahmaananda itself.

  

That this is to avoid proliferation of views about what Brahman is, is the traditional view that I learnt from my teacher Br Ve Prof Korada Subrahmanyam garu, who is a part of a long and unbroken paramparaa of vaiyaakaraNas.

N Siva Senani
