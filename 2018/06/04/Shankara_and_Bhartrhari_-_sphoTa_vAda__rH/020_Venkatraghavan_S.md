Dear Prof. Korada,

  

Thank you so much for your highly erudite reply. It has dealt directly with my questions, thank you.

  

I was under the impression that in vyAkaraNa, the unit of meaning was the sentence, and thus the idea of words and phonemes was merely a superimposition.

  

The idea that a group of sentences (in fact, the entire upaniShad itself) or one sentence (the prayogavidhi in the example below) is taken as a mahAvAkya, rendering the individual component sentences or other sentences as non-existent, is quite surprising.

  

The term mahAvAkya in advaita, on the other hand is used for akhaNDArtha vAkyas.

  

Further, sometimes in advaita, there is a classification of pramANa as tAttvika (mahAvAkya) and atAttvika (avAntara vAkyAni). The ontological statuses of the object of those two pramANas are different (tAttvika pramANa have pAramArthika viShaya, atAttvika pramANa have vyAvahArika viShaya), the ontological statuses of the pramANas themselves are the same (both vyAvahArika).

  

It appears from your email that in vyAkaraNa, the ontological statuses of the sentences themselves - mahAvAkya and avAntaravAkya - are different. The former is real, the latter a superimposition.

  

Very interesting. Thanks once again for your help.

  

Kind regards,

Venkatraghavan
