Dear Sir,

Thank you very much for the article - it cleared many of my questions. A very lucid presentation of the subject matter indeed.

  

It is unclear to me why Shankaracharya chose to argue from a varNavAda standpoint in relation to sphoTa. Is it merely a case of him putting into practice the old adage, vyavahAre bhaTTanayah, is it him following the footsteps of advaita pUrvAchAryas such as upavarSha, or is there something else - something fundamental incompatibility between sphoTavAda and advaita epistemology? That is the question that I am trying to get to the bottom of.



Kind regards,

Venkatraghavan
