In Advaita there is the doctrine of using words, shabda, (only) where there are jAti, guNa, kriyA and sambandha. And since Brahman is not endowed with any of these, no word, shabda, can be used with reference to it and thus it is avAchya. This idea of specifying where words can be used, I have heard, is as per the Paninian Vyakarana. I do not know where in the vyakarana shaastra this is stated, though.
