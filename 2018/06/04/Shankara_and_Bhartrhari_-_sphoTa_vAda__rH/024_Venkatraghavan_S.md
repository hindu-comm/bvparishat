Dear Subbu ji, Sri Sivasenani ji,

Yes indeed, the wholistic view of the entire vedic canon having ekavAkyatA, to serve as the means to attain the ultimate aim of moksha, through karma as a stepping stone, leading to jnAna as the direct means, is something that is well accepted in advaita.

  

The concept of akhaNDa vAkyArtha in vyAkaraNa, at least as far as I have understood it, is that the sentence or utterance is one unanalysable, divisionless meaning unit. Where the speaker and hearer are proficient in the language, both the utterance and the comprehension is as a whole sentence. Where the hearer is not proficient in the language, he hears sounds / words and tries to organise that into a whole which has meaning. Therefore, even though pada sphoTa and varNa sphoTa are recognised in vyAkaraNa, only the vAkya sphoTa is accepted as a real unit of speech.

  

However, the meanings of akhaNDArthavAkya and akhaNDavAkyArtha are different, at least as far as I have understood them. The former, according to advaita, is that (sentence) which being composed of non-synonymous words, reveals a valid cognition, solely through the recollection of word meanings and nothing beyond that (that is, no any relationships between the words comprising the sentence are revealed) - aparyAya shabdAnAm padavrittismArita atirikta agocara pramAjanakatvam akhaNDArthatvam says the advaita siddhi. The latter is the impartite meaning revealed by all sentences, according to vyAkaraNa.

  

Thus in advaita, only some sentences are akhaNDArthavAkya, ie only some sentence meanings are impartite, whereas in vyAkaraNa, every sentence-meaning is impartite, and thus every sentence has akhaNDavAkyArtha.

  

Kind regards,

Venkatraghavan
