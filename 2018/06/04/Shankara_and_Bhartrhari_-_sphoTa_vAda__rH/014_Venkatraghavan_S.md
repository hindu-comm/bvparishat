Dear Sir,

Thank you for the clarification - my questions have been answered. However, this is an area I need to study further. As Prof Deshpande mentioned, there are other areas of the bhAShyas where ideas from vyAkaraNa have been articulated, sometimes verbatim, by Sankara. The relationship between the two darSanas should be explored further.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
