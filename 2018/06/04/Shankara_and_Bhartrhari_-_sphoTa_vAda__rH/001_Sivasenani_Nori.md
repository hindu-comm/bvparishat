Sri Venkatraghavan

  

The short answers to your questions are as follows:

  

Sankaracharya has summarised Bhartrihari's position. The varNavAda position adopted is the same as what we see in Sabarasvamin and Kumarila.

  

The attached document may be perused for related details. (Please bear in mind that it is a non-paper, in the sense that it is a couple of iterations from being a proper paper and was given up by me - Section 5, the one covering your questions - is particularly sketchy. I decided that there is not enough interest for such a paper and did not complete it. So there will be a few typos or sentences needing some corrections).

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
