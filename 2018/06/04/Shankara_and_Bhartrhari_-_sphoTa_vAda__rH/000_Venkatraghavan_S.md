Namaste,

Could anyone please confirm if the sphoTa vAda that Shankara argues against in the sUtra bhAShya (1.3.28) is based on the lines of what has stated by Bhartrhari in the vAkyapadIyam?

  

If so, has Shankara quoted it verbatim or merely summarised Bhartrhari's position?

  

If it is not Bhartrhari's, whose position is it (e.g. is it maNDana miSra's position from the sphOTa siddhi)?

  

Is the varNa vAda position as advocated by upavarSha (and quoted by Shankara in the bhAShya) the same as Sabara and kumArila bhaTTa?

  

Apologies about the multiple questions -

Would not want to impose on anyone to provide a detailed answer, even a pointer to papers / books that discuss these would be gratefully received.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
