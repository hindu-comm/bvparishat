Thanks very much Nitya nanda ji for giving several references. And yet we have to decide the meaning of KviP, ifकर्तरि,उपनिषीदति/तः(it may have either शिष्य or both गुरु and शिष्य as कर्त्ऋ),or ,if अधिकरणे, उपनिषीदति शिष्यःअस्मिन् विद्याग्रहणविषये,that विद्या in regard to which the शिष्य sits close with his गुरु.
