The expression सदेर्धातोर्विशरणगत्यवसादनार्थस्य has the conventional style of restating the dhaatvartha from the standard dhaatvartha +saptamee - dhaatu tables.

  

The expression vis'araNa is already there in that expression.

  

Bhagavatpaada S'ankara is just reproducing the word and justifying it. So it is not usual to change the form in such contexts.

  

In संसारबीजस्य विशरणाद्धिंसनाद्विनाशनादित्यनेनार्थयोगेन, vis'araNa is not being equated with vinaas'ana.

  

'Since vis'araNa of samsaarabeeja *happens*because of Upanishad'

  

'or since vinaas'ana is ***done/caused by*** Upanishad '

  

can easily go together.
