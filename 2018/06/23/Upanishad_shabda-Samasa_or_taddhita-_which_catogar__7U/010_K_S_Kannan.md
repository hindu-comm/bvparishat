*upanis"aNNam asyAm \[param s'reyaH\] - ity upanis"at*

is also encountered as a *vigraha*.

  

This apart, I am sensing some issues in the *bhAs"ya* passage cited.

  

Would not the explanation have been more apt if it was given as

*samsAra-bIjasya vis'AraNAt,*

*  * rather than *vis'araNAt*  

(in order to clearly reflect the *Nyartha*?);

and again, why *vinAs'anAt*,

     why not *vinas'anAt*

*(*for the sake of symmetry with the previous - as sans *Nic,* that is)?

In other words, are not *vis'araNa* and *vinas'ana* synonymous?

  

Which, then, of *vis'araNa*/*vis'AraNa/*vinAs'ana*/*vinas'ana* *

is/are transitive,and which intransitive?

  

Or does *vis'araNa* itselfmean the same as*vis'AraNa ?*

*  
*

Also,is there *Nyantatva* in *avasAdayati*

(as the sense of *upa+ni+sad +Nic)*further on

(and in which case do we have the case of double *Nyantatva*

as the root itself already possesses*avasAdana* as its sense)?

  

I am not saying that the above dissolutions are good or bad.

While one may have freedom wrt*adhyAhAra-*s,

does one also have freedom - to take the root now as *Nyanta,*and now as not

while giving **multiple *vigraha*-s of the same word** exploiting its polysemous root?

  

Can somebody clarify?Are there parallels for such situations?  

*
