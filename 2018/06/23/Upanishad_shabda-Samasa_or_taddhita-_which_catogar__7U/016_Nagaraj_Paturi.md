Upanishad is one of such words which came down to us from a very ancient past as rooDha , with a given connotation. We know what the word refers to. That is enough for all practical purposes.

  

But when we try to look for a yaugika explanation for such rooDha words, particularly words like Upanishad offer interestingly big number of possibilities.

  

None of the attempts by various aachaaryas to make such a connection is of any lesser value than the other.

Regarding S'ankara Bhagavatpaada's proposal:

  

usually among the multiple table-listed meanings of the same dhaatu, only one stands out to be matching with the meaning of a given word derived from it.

  

But what the genius aachaaryapaadaah is doing here is that he is able to show justification for all the multiple table-listed meanings of the dhaatu.
