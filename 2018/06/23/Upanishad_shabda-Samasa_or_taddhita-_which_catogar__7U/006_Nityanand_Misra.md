Dear Prof. Paturi

  

I believe the etymology implied in Shankara Bhashya is not

  

उप नि सद् क्विप्

  

But rather

  

उप नि सद् णिच् क्विप्

  

The णिच् is not mentioned in the grammatical derivation, but the explanation makes it clear

  

1\) ब्रह्मगमयितृत्वेन (not ब्रह्मगन्तृत्वेन)

2\) प्रवृत्तस्यावसादयितृत्वेन (अवसादयितृत्वेन and not अवसदितृत्वेन)

  

Needless to say, in उप नि सद् णिच् क्विप्, the णिच् is elided by णेरनिटि.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
