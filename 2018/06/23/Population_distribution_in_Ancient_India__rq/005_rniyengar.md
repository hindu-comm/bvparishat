Please address your query to Prof.MD Srinivas, Chairman, Centre for Policy Studies, Chennai. He occasionally visits BVP also. He has collected authentic demographical data of pre-colonial Tamil Nadu villages from palm-leaf ledgers of 18th cent. village accountants. I heard him talk about this topic at a Conference in March, New Delhi.
