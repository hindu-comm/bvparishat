It is almost impossible to gather varna-wise population distribution.  

  

We can talk of landscape distribution and settlement patterns within them. i.e., we can say that cities were very very few. Towns were a little more. Villages were the majority of the settlements occupied the most space of human settlements.. Forests occupied most space. Tribal population were scattered here and there in these forests.

  

There were Brahmin settlements. Brahmins lived in towns and cities but in small numbers. Many villages had one or two Brahmin families. There were villages without Brahmins too.
