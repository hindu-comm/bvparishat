Respected vidvaj-janas,  
  
We are trying to visualize how a state with ancient type of varna  
setup would run with all different occupations. We are looking for  
some rough idea of how many percentage of total population would each  
of varnas (brahmin, ksatriya, vaisya, and sudras that include all  
others) constitute.  
  
If any information in this regard is available it will be helpful.  
Sources may be ancient diaries of britishers, moghuls, etc.  
Or from vedic literatures for instance mentioning that the kingdom of  
such and such king had these many brahmins, etc.  
  
One such thing I heard (source unknown) was that ratio is 1+4+16+64 = 85  
means 1 brahmin, 4 ksatriyas, 16 vaisyas, 64 sudras including all others.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
