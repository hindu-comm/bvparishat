What we found was that by 200BC profession-related guilds had developed

who were protected by the State through tax structure. The guilds had their

own settlements and product centers. I am attaching a PDF of a presentation

done by a member of our team.

There are many kinds of theories regarding who showed up and who were natives etc.

We would look more as we proceed to get more research.
