Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Professor Emeritus

  

Dear Friends,

  

June 1 was the beginning of my retirement from the University of Michigan. I have been informed by my department that from now on my status as "Professor Emeritus" has been officially approved by the University of Michigan. I just returned to San Francisco from a week in London, and during the 11 hour flight I composed 35 new Krishna verses. Will put them up once I get to translating them.
