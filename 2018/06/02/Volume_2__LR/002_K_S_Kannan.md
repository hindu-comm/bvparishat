Sure, will send both volumes.  
  

Your announcement on BVP reg. the Mimamsa Workshop is fine.  

The workshop will surely be a success.  
  

One small suggestion:  

Try to write about the credentials of each of the Resource Persons in the Workshop.  

A major audience of BVP might not have heard much about them.  

One or two paragraphs about the academic excellences of each should be sufficient.  
  

Wishing the best for the Workshop
