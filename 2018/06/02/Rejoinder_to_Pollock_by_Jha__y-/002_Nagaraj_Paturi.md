Just with the idea that we should not give opportunity to the pratipakshin to our argument to find holes and use them to obfuscate,

  

flag burning is allowed in US through the interpretations of the first amendment /free speech by their Supreme Court:

Of course, "idea of rights in each constitution should be in tune with the culture of the nation" is found in the human rights debates all over the world.

  

Many African nations have been arguing through protests that the so called "universal human rights" have many aspects of western worldview imposed on the rest of the world.

  

All this is a different question.

  

But congratulations to Prof. Jha for making his readers like Sri G S S Murthy say,

  

" Very dignified and balanced article indeed. My respectful congrats to Prof.Jha. "
