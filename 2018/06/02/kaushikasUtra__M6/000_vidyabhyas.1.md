Respected scholars

  

I want to understand the meaning of following verse -

  

  

अतिवृष्टरनावृष्टिः शलभा मूषकाःशुकाः ।  

स्वचक्रं परचक्रं वा सप्तैता ईतयः स्मृताः ।। 5 .38.9 कौ.सू

  

I also want to know that What is the difference between नक्षत्र उपचार and ग्रहउपचार ? are they considered same in astrology ?

Kindly Oblige

Kalindi
