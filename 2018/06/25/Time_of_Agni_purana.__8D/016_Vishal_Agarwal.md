Dr. Hazra held that the current Agni Purana is new and that the 'original' Agni Purana is actually the Vahni Purana, some manuscripts of which were accessible to him. He showed how all the Agni Purana quotations in ancient Dharmanibandhas were traceable to Vahni Purana, which he dated to 500 CE or earlier.

Recently, the first half of the Vahni Purana was published from manuscripts by the Asiatic Society, Kolkata. The second half comprising of a retelling of the Ramayana will hopefully also come out soon. (Incidentally, this also counters Wendy Doniger's spurious claim that ancient Puranas largely ignore Ramayana. The Vahni Purana version itself is about 5000 verses long).
