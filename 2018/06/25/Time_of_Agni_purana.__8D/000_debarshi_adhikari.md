When we studied about काव्यशास्त्रीयालोचना in the agni purana, than the time of agni purana becomes a controversial subject. Some of the scholars said that Agni purana was written after Mammata because the first examples of agni purana was found in SAHITYADARPANA.So please help me to find out the actual timing of agni purana or please suggest me a book where I can find the subject broadly.  
Hope I'll get my answer asap.
