Puranas are known to have evolved over time.Original versions authored by or ascribed to Vedavyasa were small.They contain all possible subjects as Ayurveda, Astronomy or Jyothisha,Vastu etc in addition to stories added from time to time .This happened to Mahabharata also which was known as Jaya originally which was small in size
