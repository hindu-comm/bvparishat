Debarshiji,

  

I am not an expert on this subject. Stil, I can give a few hints that would be helpful to you.

  

You can find out the time of Mammata and Visvanatha Kaviraja (author of Sahityadapana that you mentioned in your initial post) from Krishnamacharya's History of Classical Sanskrit Literature. From a quick search on Google, I find that they lived in 11th and 14th-15th centuries CE. So, Agnipurana is certaingly pre-Mammata.

  

You may also read R.C. Hazara's 'Our Present Agni Purana' here.

There is an article on the time of Agni Purana by P.N. Dvivedi. It is not easily available on the internet. Giving below its publication details.  

Dwivedi, P. N.   
Title: Agni purāṇa kā racanā kāla   
Language: Hindi   
Published In: AgraUJR 19,2, 1971, p. 75-86   
Year: 1971
