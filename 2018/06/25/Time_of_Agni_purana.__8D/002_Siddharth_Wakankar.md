Please refer to the book, Agni Purana-A Study, by Dr.S.D.Gyani.published some 50/60 years back.I forgot the name of the publisher.

  

It is the only book which deals exhaustively with the contents etc.of the Agni Purana and is supposed to be encyclopaedic in nature like the original Purana.

  

Best luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
