Dear Vaidhhya Mani Ji,

  

  Thanks for your congratulatory message. Yes, the early part of the Mādhavakarṇāmr̥ta had almost 50 verses in Āryā meter, and a few in Śārdūlavikrīḍita, Vasantatilakā etc. My previously composed Sītā-Rāvaṇa-Saṃvāda-Pañcāśikā is almost completely in Śārdūlavikrīḍita, with a few verses in other meters. Best,
