Friends,

This was my first analytic lecture on Indian Philosophy at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in 1997. The occasion was the inauguration of the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.

The lecture was sponsored by Templeton Foundation, chaired then by Harvey Cox of Harvard..

The video was posted in April and I was informed last week. Sharing..

You may find it of interest.

Best regards,
