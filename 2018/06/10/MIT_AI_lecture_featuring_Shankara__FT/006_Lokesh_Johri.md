This is an article based on a paper:<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100319210631.htm>

It talks about having theta waves in the frontal brain and alpha waves in the posterior part. I do not think there is evidence for "DC current activity in the brain hypothesis" under the current cognition research.

  

I think meditation is highly active brain process, it is just not goaloriented.
