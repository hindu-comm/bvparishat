Dear Sri Lokesh,

My extrapolation to zero was intuitive. I was creating a brain atlas those days.

I did further mathematical work on truth functions and then was forced to work

for US defense during the war. I am looking back into various aspects now.

You may send me any papers you might have. I plan to return to cognition in a

few years. Currently we are on speech, the articulation of language.

Best regards,

BM
