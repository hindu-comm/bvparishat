Namaste

' **Standards manual in traditional temple worship'** ???

1. For deliberating on this, one needs to establish the pre-qualification that the 'place of worship' deserves to be called as a 'Devalaya by aagama standards for specific devatas' and individual' officiating person is an ordained 'Archaka'!

 If one starts applying the rule book standards of any aagama to any of the Hindu Mandirs and current ' archakas' across the globe (including classical temples at India) , the pass marks would be obtained by probably less than 5% of establishments and practicing persons!

 Reality saddens. For Many devalayas have relegated ' Yoga and Samskrutham needed for Aagama authenticated professions of a ' Archaka'. The Government departments have taken over the authority on ' Who, how and why runs the devalayas ' !



 So wisdom of 'Shaastrakaara' is : Take guidance from Sadaachaara- Deshaachaara ( Practices of noble persons in a given context of time and geo- cultural context) as observed in community' and take the steps to provide a socially digestible, practical, '( even if diluted) norm for this ' yuga'. Naama-sankeertanam was the powerful, yet a diluted model that was provided for Kali-yuga.

2. On ' deity worship and cleanliness/ rules of ritual purity - methods and standards in Deity worship / Research for Varna-Ashrama :

 The rules of ' Devalaya - Poojaa- paddhati' with specificities of 'Varna- Ashrama' rules of ritual, ritual purity, Deity worship - may have to be looked at a combine of several resources beyond a classical frame of ' Dharma -Shaastra - Commentary on specific Smriti'. The key works to be looked at will be specific Aagamas and Tantras, along with the ' Sampradaya -sadachara'.

Example: The rules of ritual and rules of purity for accommodation of 'Matsya' as a food item / for nivedana varies even within the frame of 'Sadachaara - Sampradyaya' widely across the landscape of Bharath.

If the question is articulated and focused differently, it may read: Can there be way to frame a good-practices, global rule guidance and a 'culturally acceptable standards' implementable as a 'religion-corporate standard across all Mandirs' as a standard Hindu Mandir Practice?

The answer from a traditional perspective would be 'No way'!

What if one sticks to a narrow frame of 'cultural format-localized practice' as a standard ? Well, it could serve as a 'relic of museum by religion perspective'.

What would one rate the 'yajna' performance standards from meemaamsaa ? Is there no global standard ? The insiders of tradition know the rigid frame work and customizable parts as a part of ' Sadaachaara'.

2. On 'Say IF I am Pujari' - These are 'difficult and context-person- gender sensitive' questions' to deal with. The profession of 'pujari' ( Cf: Archaka) comes integrally with a personal life style commitment and needs a social sustainable model of operation to support its operation. If the 'Temple community and board' fail to recognize, support and honor the 'Archaka' ; on the contrary, if the person is treated as a 'employee' or as an 'agent - intermediary' doing a brokerage between devotee and the Divine, the work rules take precedence over the '
Smriti-aagama' rules ! Same thing applies to other professions also.

For a reference on good practices of ' Pujari's acrossdifferent devata -mandirs, it may be worth doing a research at the main mandirs : Tirupati (Vaishnava flavor), Shabari malia ( Ayyappa model), Dharma Sthala ( pluri- culture), Madurai Meenakshi temple.
