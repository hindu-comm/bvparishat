Dear Scholars,

  

Good morning.

  

I am researching on the ancient Bharath's history based on Puranas. In this regard I would like to get some reference books prescribed on the below subjects:

  

1\. Is there any book that deals with historical events extracted from the Puranas? \[ I came across one book, "Ancient Indian Historical Tradition- F.E. Pargiter";But looking for few more references similar to this\].

  

2\. When we say "abhivadaye" every family recites a set of rishi's names based on their genealogy. Is there any book/material which deals with various gothras/rishi lineages? from which these are derived? Any historical inputs related to this also if any?

  

3\. I am interested to understand the Rg Veda verses. Can you suggest any 'good' book which explains the meaning of each verse concisely (preferably in English or Tamil)?

  

Thanks in advance.

  

thanks,

ganesh.
