Resptected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
There is a lot of information available on daily life (from waking up  
to sleep) of a typicla brahmin in ancient India.  
  
But is there any such book about an ancient Indian farmer family?  
  
By ancient I mean in a society following vedic dharma and living a  
simple village life.  
  
If the source provide about their food habits, clothings, etc. that  
will be even more useful.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,
