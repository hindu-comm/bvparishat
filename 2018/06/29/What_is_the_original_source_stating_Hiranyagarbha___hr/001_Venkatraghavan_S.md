Namaste

The shvetAshvatara upaniShad says - यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्वंयो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति तस्मै।तं ह देवं आत्मबुद्धिप्रकाशं मुमुक्षुर्वै शरणमहं प्रपद्ये ।।  

Is this the original source. It depends on who asks.

For people like me who are of a traditional view, we cannot say that one part of the Vedas is the original, and another is later. Especially given that this Veda mantra itself says that Ishvara gave the Vedas to Brahma in the beginning. If Veda pramAna is accepted, this mantra itself is \*the\* original source for this view.
