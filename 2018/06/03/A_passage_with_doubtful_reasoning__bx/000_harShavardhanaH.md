Namaskar,  
  

The following passage by Swami Hariharananda Aranya in his Samkhyatattvaloka purports to show, through a process of reasoning, how the tanmatras originate from asmita or ahamkara or ego or I-sense. **This reasoning seems circular to me, as it postulates the existence of a mind as the originator of the tanmatras, and then, circularly, arrives at the same assumption as a conclusion.** This is not satisfactory to me.

  

I am giving both the original Samksrita text and its published English translation below: (Portions that seem defective to me are highlighted in red, with my comments in blue)

**तन्मात्रकारणं न वाह्यात्वेन प्रत्यक्षीभवति, तत्तु अनुमानेन निश्चीयते। योगिनां परमप्रत्यक्षपूर्वकं हि तदनुमानम्। तन्मात्रसाक्षात्कारे विषयस्य सूक्ष्मचाञ्चल्यात्मकत्वमनुभूयते, तत इन्द्रियाणामपि अभिमानात्मकत्वमुपलभ्यते। तस्य चाभिमानस्य ग्राह्याकृतोद्रेकाज्ज्ञानम्। यदभिमानं चालयति तदभिमानसजातीयं स्यादिति। तस्माद् ग्राह्यमभिमानात्मकमित्यनया दिशा ग्राह्यमूलग्रहणयोः सजातीयत्वं निश्चीयते। किं च विषयमूलं वस्तु क्रियाशीलम्। वाह्यक्रिया देशान्तरगतिः। देशज्ञानञ्च शब्दादेरविनाभावि। ग्राह्यमूले शब्दादेरभावान्न तत्र देशव्यापिनी क्रिया कल्पनीया। तस्मात् विषयमूलवस्तुनः क्रियाऽदेशव्यापिनी। तादृशी च क्रिया अभिमानस्यौव। तस्मादभिमानरूपं वाह्यमूलमिति।**

**The material cause of the tanmatras cannot be perceived. it is ascertainable through inference, preceded by its realization through samadhi by yogis.**

**  
**

**(The sequence is as follows:) In the process of realizing tanmatras, the yogi apperceives the innate subtle agitation in the knowables. *(Slightslackening of concentration from the state of arrest of the organs makes for reappearance of the external world. And the tanmatras are realized at the point of transition to and from that state of arrest. The yogi realizes that this method of realization of tanmatras succeeds because of intrinsic vibration in knowables.)* The yogi *(further)* realizes that the organs originate in his I-sense which is mutative. Knowledge of the material world arises as and when one's I-sense receives (an appropriate) external stimulation. Whatever excites the ego will have to be akin to it.(How? By what process of reasoning has this conclusion been arrived at?) In other words, mind *(which is not spatial, but)* which mutates in time can influence or excite another mind. (Again, how?) It follows that knowables *(which excite our I-sense)* must also have originated from some I-sense. Thus yogis by their direct realization through samadhi have inferred that the material cause of both the inert knowables and the sentient beings capable of apprehending them are similar in that both are based on ego or I-sense.**

**  
**

***(The common man, without possessing the yogi's power of concentration, can comprehend it by following the logic of the yogi's line of thinking.)* Our cognition of the knowables stems from their impact on our sense-organs whence we accept:)(// this seems to be a printing error //) The underlying cause of the knowables is in a state of flux.** External action is movement in space. (Granted.) Cognition of space, however, is associated with our knowledge of the five elemental principles. (Also, granted) And since *(as explained earlier*) (Where?) the underlying external reality (being of the nature of mind) (How did you arrive at this conclusion?) is bereft of sound, light, etc, its mutation cannot be spatial. Non-spatial (i.e. temporal) mutation takes place only in the mind, **which goes to confirm that the external reality is of the nature of asmita (I-sense).**

I request scholars to kindly give their opinion on the reasoning here and set me right if I am wrong in finding it circular.
