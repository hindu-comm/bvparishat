This is just for the understanding of the causes that brought the Samskrit based Education System to a halt : In 1817,English based Education was made compulsory and all Education in any Indian Language including Sanskrit was declared illegal by the British Government.English replaced Sanskrit

by the force of the British Indian Government.In that process initially very few children were sent to English schools.This resulted in illiteracy from which even now India suffers.Later,gradually most if not all scholarly families (Brahmin Sanskrit Scholars families) switched over to British Indian Government based English education .
