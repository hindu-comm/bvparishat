This pages are from "*Report Of The Sanskrit Commission 1956-1957*" so no wonder the observations could have highly political influence, based on the conclusion they already derived beforehand carrying out the research work.  

  

An excerpt from the attached sample page,

  

"*On the other hand, it was impressed on his mind that everything that was worth knowing in a particular subject had already been set forth in the ancient traditional text-books, and that there was no possibility of any new knowledge on that subject coming to light.*"  

  

So what is wrong in that, are we looking for troubleshooting an iPhone from the scriptures? Well, it could have some valuable data but certainly not worth relying exclusively on without taking help of some other source of authentic research.  

  

However, through this thread I would like to get any pointers of such legitimate reasons/write-up that shed more light on shutting-down of traditional educational system across the country. In this regards I've gone through (not studies well) the Dharampalji's "[The Beautiful Tree](https://archive.org/stream/DharampalCollectedWritingsIn5Volumes/3DharampalJiCollectedWritings-beautifultree)" and that has detailed records about how once a flourishing indigenous education system was systematically bring down to halt by Britishraj. I'm trying to seek answer for the fundamental question, why it was not noticed by scholars of that time? or if noticed why there was no defense to it?

  

This query is in view with lots of small and big organizations working tirelessly to reestablish indigenous/traditional education system but are we sure of the root cause of the defeat that time, have we plug the hole yet, are we prepared to face the same thing again?  

  

Dhanyoshmi,

Sunil
