Thanks Shankara

  

I see they withdrew the support from Sanskrit and Arabic Institutions and diverted the funds for English.

  

But does this make the statement " **Sanskrit was declared illegal **" valid.

  

Example: British made the "sati" tradition Illegal

  

My objection was only for the "ILLEGAL"

  

Rgds
