Namaskar Prof. Deshpande,

  

1st Congratulations for your appointment as Professor Emeritus.

  

My point in responding to the post was only to point out the difference between the term used, "ILLEGAL", "Withdrew the support for Sanskrit" from the text quoted. To me they do not mean the same thing. Using languages loosely totally alters the intended meaning.
