These observations are cent per cent fit to modern education system too.... Also the observer seems to be prejudist but wearing a coat of a balanced impartial judge.....Observing the patasala aducation as unsuccesful and unprofitable, actually one with a profit-focused eye,
places himself on a materialist's chair.... The status of sanskrit is highly in threat neither because of patasala-system nor modern system,
but the scarcity of inteligent students. More over, actually, Sanskrit in india in the modern-system is more pitious being it in the hands of lakhs of sanskrit teachers who do not know what is sanskrit and what is in it...so, a little pure sanskrit and the content put in it is safe in the traditional method.... So, hai! observer! Dont be over smart....
