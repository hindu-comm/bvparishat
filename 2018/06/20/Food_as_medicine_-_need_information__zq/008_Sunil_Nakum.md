Dear Srinivas Sir,

  

The Ahmedabad based PunarUtthan organization has published "Aharshastra" compiled by Sri Indumati Katdare and others. The division of book is something like 1) Purpose of Ahar, 2) Ahar mimamsa, 3) Taittiriya upanishad and Ann, 4) Ahar as per shastra and 5) Nutrition of Panchakosha by ahar.  

  

Hope you are looking for similar work.  

  

Dhanyoshmi,

Sunil
