Thanks Yadu ji for bringing up the Taitttiriya reference. In a line just before what you have cited, in the Bhashyam it is said as to why 'annam', food, is called 'auShadham': Mantra: अन्नं हि भूतानां ज्येष्ठम्। तस्मात्सर्वौषधमुच्यते। Bhashyam: तस्मात् सर्वौषधं सर्वप्राणिनां देहदाहप्रशमनमन्नमुच्यते ॥ The commentary of Sureshwara/Anandagiri/Vanamala clarify thus: When a person is in need of food, that is when he is hungry, the fire in the stomach, called 'jATharAgni', burns the dhAtu-s, the vital essence in the body. This burning is called 'ओषणम्'. When food is provided, in any form, like drinking, masticating, swallowing, licking, etc. the burning is curbed. Hence food is called 'औषधम्'.
