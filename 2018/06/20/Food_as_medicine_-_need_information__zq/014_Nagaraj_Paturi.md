1\. Ayurvedic knowledge of food as medicine percolated down to the common people in pre-modern India so much that people particularly elders even of my parents' generation used to easily talk about vaata, pitta, kapha, ushNa, s'eeta effects of both raw and cooked food.

  

2\. Probably this knowledge was region-specific because we have such a wide diversity of food habits all over India, but people of each region knew the vaata, pitta, kapha, ushNa, s'eetaeffects of their respective food.

  

3\. How such effects for the new food items which arrived from outside India were identified by Ayurvedic bhishaks is interesting to enquire.
