I have given a number of lectures on Ayurvedic approach to food,nutrition and lifestyle regimens but not sure if they are available online. You need to check. I am speaking on the same topic in Bangalore as well. These said,I dohave some published papers on this topic. If you think it would be of some use, I can mail them.

  

Warm Regards

Rama
