Namste:

  

I think this brings out TWO important points:

  

1. Definition of the term "FOOD"  

  

अद्यते तत् अन्नम् AND अत्ति तत् अन्नम्

  

2. Make Food your medicine, meaning the best delivery form for medicine is FOOD.  

  

This being a diluted form of medication (active Principle) body has sufficient time to deal with any adverse reactions, whatever, they may be.  

  

Too much or non-suitable food will destroy the one who consumes it.

  

Little bit fat is absolutely necessary for the heart muscle, because it derives energy through the Beta-Oxidation of Fat, however, it will create and block your arteries as well.  

  

3. Popular Prakashan Mumbai have published TWO volumes

  

Indian Materia Medica. Author Dr. K.M. Nadkarni

  

This has lot of good information.
