Sir, I add the following:  
  
- As mentioned by others, it does not take long.  
- Protecting agni 24 hours is not difficult - I've seen it done in a small upper floor veranda, in a pot. See - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkRYT-iTi2c> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkv8rZBOhtE> . One uses slow burning husks and (un)covers ash.  
- Even without saving agni for 24 hours, some folks do samit-samAropaNa or even Atma-samAropaNa regularly. In other words, they "upload" and "download" agni to/ from samit and oneself. In any case, the initial vichChinnAgnisandhAna is required.  

\- Even without aupAsanAgni, one can very well do vaishvadeva in laukikAgni. This is specially important part of 5 mahAyajJNa-s and lots of people (esp vaiShNava-s) practice it. This too is places very small time demands.
