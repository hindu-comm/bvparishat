CB Adi-khanda 3.12  
TEXT 12  
maha-jyotir-vit vipra sabara agrete  
  
lagne anurupa katha lagila kahite  
trns.:  
  
Then that great astrologer brahmana began to speak before everyone  
present about the symptoms of the various houses in the child’s  
horoscope.  
On this COMMENTARY  
  
Nilambara Cakravarti was a learned teacher of the science of  
astrology. Therefore he began to explain the various lagnas of the  
Lord’s horoscope to the people present there. The word maha-jyotir-vit  
is explained as follows:  

तैले तथा मांसे वैद्ये ज्योतिषिके द्विजे । यात्रायामथ निद्रायां महच्छब्दो न  
दीयते ।।  
  

shankhe taile tatha mamse vaidye jyotishike dvije  
  
yatrayam pathi nidrayam mahaccabdo na diyate  
  
But in this case it is to be understood that Nilambara Cakravarti was  
learned and expert in the science of astrology. The word  
maha-jyotir-vit may also indicate one who is learned and expert in the  
spiritual science.
