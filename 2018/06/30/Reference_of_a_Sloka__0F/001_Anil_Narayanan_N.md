Pranams..

The verse can be found in the second act of *prakāśa* commentary of *Mālavikāgnimitra* (ed. Ramachandra Misra, Chaukhamba Sanskrit Series office, Varanasi). While commenting on Gaṇadāsa’s statement “**mahābrāhmaṇa**na khalu prathamaṃ nepathyasaṃgītakamidam” , the commentator quotes the versefrom the *Bhṭṭitīkā* of Bharata.

Regards,
