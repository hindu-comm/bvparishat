Thank you for your feedback.

It seems that the subanta generator works on sanskritworld site, but is terribly slow. Will have to look into the potential error. tiGanta generator at<https://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/tiGanta.html> seems to work reasonably fast.

  

For those who want more finished frontend, they may find<http://ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/> interesting. You can drill down to root, click on the form of interest and get step by step derivation.

  

With regards,
