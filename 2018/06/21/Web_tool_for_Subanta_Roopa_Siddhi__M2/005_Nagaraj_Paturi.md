Sir,

  

This thread is about siddhi in vyaakaraNa, which you know.

  

Let me share with the readers that you were one of the early software persons to attempt to create software for siddhi of vyaakaraNa.

  

Now, there are a good number of successful software engines created.

  

The thread is discussing those tools which are now online.
