Dear and respected scholars,

  

Can you guide me to get information about Sri. M. R. Kale, the well known author of so many annotated classics of Sanskrit that are popular in the student world since a century. As my search in the internet went future, I am bothering you all.

  

With utmost regards

  

Ganesh
