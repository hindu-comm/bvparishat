One needs to be careful while conflating 2 different paradigms or in trying to explain one paradigm based on the principles of another. Doing so usually ends up in confusion.

While in current society the Y chromosome does indicate a male, it is not known with certainty if all males throughout the long history of humans retained that Y Chromosome *in the exact same form* it is found today. So trying to explain the gotra as a means to protect the Y Chromosome would be too limiting given the narrow definition of the Y as it stands today.

  

A general question among certain people is why the gotra cannot be carried in a woman's lines. A friend of mine who was born in a "non brahminical" gotra seemed to think it unfair that even though he married a "Brahmin" girl, his child would not be considered "Brahmin". I use " " because much of what is considered Brahmin by today's standards may not have been the standard during the era of Mahabharata as evidenced by Yaksha Prashna and the the BG.

  

To understand the rules of gotra it is useful to take analogies from nature which help in simplifying understanding and avoiding caste based posturing and the inevitable sniping and angst that comes with this territory.

The male seed or sperm that is responsible for reproduction may be thought of as a seed and the egg provided by the female may be thought of as the soil. Let us say mango seeds grow well on red soil, papaya grows well in brown soil and coconut in black soil. The above only gives an ideal scenario but does not preclude the seeds from growing in other soils. If a mango seed sprouts on brown or black soil, the resultant tree is still a mango tree. It does not become papaya or coconut.

Thus gotra is decided by who provides the seed. In this case, it ALWAYS is the man. The Gotra and pravara give the origin and branch of Rshi from whom the individual has come. In purely dharmic terms, this indicates which portions of the Veda shakha will be useful to the individual by a simple process of resonance. (The Rshi is ultimate Guru for that individual in that lifetime and may guide if sincerely approached.) Take the simple matter of Gayatri japa. A Rig Vedi's swara in the second pada differs slightly from the Yajur Vedi's. Continued from father to son to grandson, if maintained unbroken, this can lead to a magnifying effect by repetition across generations. This is why it is clearly mentioned that if a dvija gives up his nityakarma for 3 generations, they fall below the state of dvija. Dvija here would include Kshatriyas and Vaishyas who had their own method of sandhyavandana. Again the same gotra may be spread across different shakhas which is also possible. Also, the different sutras within the same shakha have given vastly different methodologies for performance of nitya and kaamya karmas based on which the sadhaka elevates himself.

  

There is significant multiplicity of process given the permutations of veda-shakha-sutra alone. Add to this the quirks introduced by migration, desha and kaala. This multiplicity that can be confusing for the outside observer can only be preserved through the system of Gotra particular to that branch wherein the knowledge is passed from father to son. When this transmission is not properly done, it can be mind boggling to align (if one is so inclined).

  

Hope this helps.
