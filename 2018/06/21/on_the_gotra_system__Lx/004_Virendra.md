Namaskar,

  

Gotra system is believed to have maintained genetic discipline in our ancestors.

I've been told this prevents diseases whose frequency aggravates due to in-breeding (apologies for lack of better words) that is, marrying within the gotra.

  

But today as a society we're a big, messy melting pot due to internal and external factors. Time changes and challenges everything.

Of all the places where this system has already broken down over the past centuries. Some witnessed a forceful application of it (like the khaps of Haryana),

But given that the genetic hygiene (pardon my limited vocabulary) is already gone, that forcing of rules is too later and turning irrelevant.

Wonder what can be done in this situation and how to proceed toward a better future.

  

Pranam,  
Virendra
