It is not possible to say with definite that the word neela in neelarudra refers to the name of color blue.

  

RV has ashyAma, 8 or 9 times, but not shyAma. ashyAma seems to refer to Divine. The word neela also appears 5 or 6 times as compound word, with neela as first word. It again one can't say with 100% certaintyif the word means the color blue.

  

Though one would think if the word today means blue, it must have meant something close to that color even in RV time, else when would such a transition happen from.one color to other or noncolor to color.

  

Thank you all for wonderful help.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
