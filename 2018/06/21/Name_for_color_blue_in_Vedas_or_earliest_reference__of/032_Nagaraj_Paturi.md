This is how Copper Sulphate looks.

  

If we go by the interpretation in the FB post in the previous post, there were such methods of referring to colours, like peacock neck for blue, too.

  

Since this reference is to particularly blue colour itself, this is more relevant here.

  

There may be other such references to colours. We can look for other such references to blue.
