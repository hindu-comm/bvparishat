Thank you Sathya ji.

  

Does the *neela* in this, refer to **blue** or **dark?**

**  
**The point of the link in my original post is that humans may not have been able to distinguish many colors, specially blue since no records of the word for color blue is found in a client literature Greek or Indian.

  

Hence the time of usage, and the exact meaning (color blue) are critical.  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
