Neelam is a Sanskrit borrowing (tatsama ward) into Tamil. Karuppu is a des'ya word i.e., a native Tamil word.

  

Similar is the situation in all the south Indian languages.

  

Neela is the root part in all the words for blue, which are all tatsamas in all these languages. There is a native word for black. nal(u)(pu), kar(r)(i) etc. in Telugu. kar(pu)>kappu in Kannada.

  

This observation may lead to the confirmation that originally speakers of the languages did not recognise blue.

  

But again, it may be noted that there were expressions such as nemili kannu rangu (colour of the centre of the peacock feather), nemileeka rangu (colour of the peacock feather) etc.
