Kannan ji,

I am looking for a use of the word to definitive mean the color blue.

The word *neela*appears in RV 6 times, and as a first part of samAsa words.

There too its meaning is not clearly for a color.

  

We now know neela to mean blue, but how old is this word? When was it first used to mean the color blue? Or did it earlier mean dark? Or something else?  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
