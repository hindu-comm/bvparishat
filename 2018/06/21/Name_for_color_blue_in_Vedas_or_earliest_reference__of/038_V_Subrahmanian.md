While noting the 'shikhi-greeva', we are reminded of a name of Shiva 'shitikanTha'. There is a variety of meanings for this, including peacock, of which one is 'blue-necked' and this is relevant in the case of Shiva because of his other name 'nIlakanTha', because of the poison:

I think Mahabharata or some other purana gives the reason why Shiva is called 'shitikanTha'.
