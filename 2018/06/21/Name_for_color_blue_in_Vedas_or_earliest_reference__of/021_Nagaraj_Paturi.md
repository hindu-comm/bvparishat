As Prof. Iyengar rightly indicated

  

1\. Whether distinguishing various colours is found in Vedas or not

  

is different from  

  

2\. Whether colour of the blue coloured objects, with whatever name, was identified in Vedas or not

  

is different from

  

3\. Whether 'Neela' is the word that was used to refer to blue colour

  

is different from

  

4\. From when did the word 'Neela' come to be used as a word referring to blue color

  

is different from

  

5\. What was the meaning of the word 'neela' before it came to be used in reference to blue colour.

  

-------------------------

  

But to conclude that the word 'neela' was used to refer to both blue and black colours because of the inability to distinguish between the two colours is a wrong conclusion. In the first place, was the word 'neela' used to refer to both blue and black colours?

  

------------------

  

Cognitive anthropologists found that colour perceptions are one of the most interesting cognitive cultural distinctions that different cultural groups have.

  

Close home, in Telugu pachcha is the word used in reference to both yellow and green. To distinguish between yellow and green , words are prefixed to pachcha. Aaku (=leaf) paccha for green and pasupu (=turmeric) pachcha for yellow.

  

But is such a situation found for the word neela?

  

---------------------

  

In any case, perceiving one colour in terms of the other is not viewed as inability to distinguish colours. That is understood as the cognitive distinction of the speakers of the language.
