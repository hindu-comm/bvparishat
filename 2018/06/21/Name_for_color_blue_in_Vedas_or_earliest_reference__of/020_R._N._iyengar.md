The question raised is intriguing. I find it hard to believe that ancient people were unable to recognize 'blue' colour. But it is true that what was meant by 'Neela' was most probably dark and not 'blue'. In the RV the poets might not have had occasion to refer to objects that were 'blue' in colour. In analyzing this issue the paper of Hopkins shared by Vishal ji is very interesting.The article shows a way for tracing probable ancient meanings of Sanskrit words that were used to mean differently in later times. But S'yaama and/or KrshNa are also used to mean 'dark' in many Sanskrit texts. One way to go about is to look for several colours juxtaposed and hence differentiated. In MBh six colours are mentioned in a string:

Here Krshna and Niila are differentiated as separate colours, still one may wonder whether Niila is blue! There are similar instances of contrasting Shyaama and Niila. Ex: In the dhyaana shloka of Saptarshis during Sandhyopaasana seven colours appear in a string.

श्वेत-श्याम-पीत-पिशङ्ग-नील-लोहित-कनक-वर्णोज्ज्वलाः \|

  

One would expect the blue-sky and the blue-sea to have been alluded to in Vedic texts. A serious search may provide some leads. However, the most ancient unambiguous reference to Niila as the colour of the Indigo-plant which is obviously blue occurs in PaaNini

In his *India as known to PaaNin*i the great scholarVS Agarwala writes:

Hence my submission: Word 'Niila' in the sense of 'Blue' should have been used by commoners at least from around 700 BCE.
