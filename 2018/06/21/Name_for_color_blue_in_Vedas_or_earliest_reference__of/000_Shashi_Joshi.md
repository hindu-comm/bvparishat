Respected members,

Do vedas have name for color blue?

Specifically used to mean the color.

What is the word for color of sky?

  

I found words neela and shyaama bit not sure if they mean the color.blue in the context.

  

What I am.looking for is the earliest reference to the name of color blue.

  

Neela is used in MB, we have neelotpala, neelakaNTha, neelakamala, but what is the earliest reference to the name of the color?

  

  

Here is a link that prompted me to think this.
