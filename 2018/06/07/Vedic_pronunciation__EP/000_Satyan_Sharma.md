What insight could we get about Vedic pronunciation of certain sounds like ‘r’ from dūḷabha (dur+dabha), ‘u’ from suṣṭuti, ‘i’ from viṣṭhita? In each case, the consonant that proceeds the aforementioned sounds, changes from dental to cerebral. Assuming that such changes happen to increase the ease in pronunciation, could we get a rough estimate of how ‘r’, ‘u’ and ‘i’ could’ve been pronounced during the Rigvedic period?
