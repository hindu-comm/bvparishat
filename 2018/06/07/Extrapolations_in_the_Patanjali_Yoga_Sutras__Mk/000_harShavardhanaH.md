Namaskar

  

I understand that a German scholar is said to have authored a paper on some extrapolatory verses in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. These verses are said to deal with the Isvara concept and are said to be later additions to the original sutra text.

  

I have not succeeded in my search for that paper. Any guidance or direction from the learned members here in this regard would be appreciated.

  

kind regards

Harsha
