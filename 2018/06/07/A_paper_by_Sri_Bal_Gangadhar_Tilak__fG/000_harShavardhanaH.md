Namaskar

  

Could the learned members help me in finding the following paper authored by Sri Bal Gangadhar Tilak: "***A Missing Verse in the Sankhya-karikas"***

***

I have drawn a blank on the general internet and also on [archive.org](http://archive.org). However there is a possibility this paper might be lurking on [archive.org](http://archive.org) with some other tags.

  

I'd appreciate any help on this matter.

  

kind regards

Harsha
