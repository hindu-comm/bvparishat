Dear list

  

Has anybody explained the unusual usage मा भैष्ट विद्वन् in the*Vivekacūḍāmaṇi*(verse 43 or 45, depending on the edition)?  

  

The expected form is मा भैषीः विद्वन् (singular) or मा भैष्टविद्वांसः (plural). मा भैष्ट is मध्यम पुरुष बहुवचन while विद्वन् is एकवचन. But मा भैषीः विद्वन् or मा भैष्टविद्वांसः would violate the metre.

  

The commentary by Swami Chandrashekhara Bharati (attached, thanks to V Subrahmanian for the link again) does not say anything on the unusual usage. In fact the commentary says भवान् मा भैष्ट \[??\]. Appears to be a typographic or editorial error as it should be be भवान् मा भैषीत् (भवान् takes the प्रथमपुरुष एकवचन form).

  

Thanks, Nityananda
