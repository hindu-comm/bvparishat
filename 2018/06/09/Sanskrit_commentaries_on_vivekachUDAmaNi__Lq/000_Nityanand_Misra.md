Dear list

  

Are any Sanskrit commentaries on the*Vivekacūḍāmaṇi* available online?

  

It appears the following book was available on the Digital Library of India. I cannot find it now

  

Viveka Chudamani., 1990030070667. Sringeri H.H. Jagadguru Chandrasekhara Bharati. 2005. sanskrit. RELIGION. THEOLOGY. 278 pgs.  

  

Thanks, Nityananda
