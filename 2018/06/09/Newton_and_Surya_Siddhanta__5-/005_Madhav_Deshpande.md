Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  You are making excellent points. To add to these, I would like to point out that the resistance to studying Sanskrit and ancient sciences came not from the British but from the Indians themselves, as known from several instances. The British wanted to use Marathi as the medium of instruction in the early Deccan College (1860s), but the students resisted this and insisted on English as the medium of instruction.
This is probably due to the perception of the job market at that time.
This is also similar to Lokamanya Tilak opening the New English School in Pune, rather than a Sanskrit Pathashala, as was the demand from some quarters. Tilak's belief was that without modernity, Indians will not be able to fight the British. So often it is not what the British did to us, but what the Indians themselves saw as being beneficial to them in those times. This is also similar to Venkaṭādhvari's critique of the Maharashtrian Brahmins in his Viśvaguṇādarśa that they have left behind the study of Sanskrit and the Vedas and are rushing to study Persian, because good jobs in those days required proficiency in Persian. The current demand in India for English education is also directly related to the wide-spread perception that only English education gets you a good job. How to change this situation is a big problem. Hope some solutions will emerge in the future.
