\> This is a video where an expert historian talks about how colonial British used Newton for friction-less dissemination of western knowledge into Asia, and to subjugate indigenous knowledge in astronomy (of India) by relegating it as unimportant and pagan.

  

                                   
              -friend of Dr K Aravinda Rao garu

  

------- What we have to note is that Newton is taught not just to Indians but to students of mainstream contemporary academics all over the world. So to imagine that Newton is was specially used against Indians, if that is the view here, is wrong. If the idea here is that the Britishers knew that there was great astronomical knowledge in India but did not include that in the Astronomy or Physics that they taught to Indian students, out of a conspiracy, even that is misplaced because it is the nature of contemporary academics all over the world that they don't include any indigenous alternative to the ideas of modern science in the courses on the respective modern sciences. But it can be argued that they could have, at least separately, taught Indic Knowledge Systems to Indian students. But why would they do it? It does not suit their political strategy and agenda.

  

( We, at MIT School of Vedic Sciences, Pune, have a course for our MSc students on the history of Sanskrit Studies in India , from the point of view of whether or not the departments of Sanskrit taught Indic Knowledge Systems, if no why, if yes, how etc.)

  

Sanskrit departments were conceived on the lines of language and literature departments such as departments of English in their own universities. As such, they focused on specialities such as saahitya, vyaakaraNa, nyaaya and vedaanta. S'aastras such as jyotisha were seldom covered under these.

  

For the youngsters studying Newton, Kepler, Ptolemy etc., even post-independence text books did not introduce Soorya Sinddhaanta and so on. Why did not we , even after Independence, introduce Indic Knowledge Systems, at least as parallel to the modern knowledge systems?

  

Let us focus on this.
