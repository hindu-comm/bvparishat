"This is a video where an expert historian talks about how colonial British used Newton for friction-less dissemination of western knowledge into Asia, and to subjugate indigenous knowledge in astronomy (of India) by relegating it as unimportant and pagan.

  

No wonder why we Indians always felt subservient and inferior to western science, the thought that was implanted by the colonial invaders. Even now, we can't seem to come out of that shell and make new discoveries/inventions!

Watch around the 30th minute of this rather long lecture, if you want to skip to the important parts. You may share this with your progressive thinking friends in India and outside".
