Respected Sri Madhav-ji,

  

Thanks for mentioning this information.

  

The point is exactly this; that the British were aware of the Astromical knowledge in Sooryasiddhaanta etc. The hypothesis /thesis being discussed is whether they used Newton to relegate this information to insignificance. I was saying that we need not go for a conspiracy theory of that sort because introducing Newton was part of introducing modern sciences in general just as pat of what was happening all over the world.  

  

"Were these "Useful" 'Hindu Sciences' taught to the students to whom Newton was taught?" -- is the question brought for discussion here. It is clear that they were not. Why were they not taught? The hypothesis being made in the text quoted in the thread initiating post is that they were not taught to the Newton-learning students with the intention of using Newton to play down the greatness of the "useful" 'Hindu science' in Sooryasiddhaanta.

  

--------------------------------

  

There are two points here:

  

There are some Indians who have a religiously strong conviction that it is waste of time and money to look for scientific knowledge in ancient Sanskrit literature. This conviction of them is rooted in their worship of the British and other western nations and their exclusive ability in doing anything scientific. But it is their 'gods' , the British who brought out the books mentioned by you. Hope these bhaktas of the British/west agree now with the factuality of scientific knowledge in ancient Sanskrit literature because the references cited by you show that their 'gods' brought out this scientific knowledge in ancient Sanskrit texts.

  

The second point is, if the British did not teach these to the students learning Newon, we can do it now. Let us do it.

  

is the point that I was making.
