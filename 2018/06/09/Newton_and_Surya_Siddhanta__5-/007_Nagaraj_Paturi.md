I don't know how and why we got digressed into medium of instruction, while our topic wss the content of the courses.

  

The famous book " The Beautiful Tree" already enlightened us all about how the indigenous schools which were huge in number were replaced by the British schools.

  

As far as Sanskrit studies were concerned, there have been traditional S'aastra paaThas'aalas before and after the British.

  

Venkatadhvari's lamentation that people were learning Persian not Sanskrit is similar to the present day lamentation that people are studying English not Sanskrit nor regional languages. These expressions are exaggerations is common sense. Not understanding that it is idiomatic to speak through such ecaggerations is what is making the western observers from distance think that Sanskrit is dead or there are no Sanskrit scholars or there are no scholars of classical Kannada or Telugu literature etc.
