Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  From the very early period of British rule, the British were deeply interested in the "useful" Hindu sciences, especially Dharmaśāstra and Jyotiṣa. Below I have listed a few of the early translations of mathematical and astronomical works.

  In setting up the Pune Sanskrit Pathashala in 1823, the British were clearly interested in promoting the "useful" subjects, especially Dharmaśāstra and Jyotiṣa. The salary for the teachers of "useful" subjects was higher than that for the teachers of Veda.
