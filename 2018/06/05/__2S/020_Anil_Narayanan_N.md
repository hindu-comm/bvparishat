Pranams..

Two words are repeated in this verse. One is सर्वदा and the other one is सन्निधिम्

1\. सर्वदा can be सर्वं ददातीति सर्वदा \[The Goddess who gives all/anything\]. This is an adjective (विशेेष्य) to Goddess शारदा

2\. The second सर्वदा is an indeclinable (अव्ययम्) means always.

3\. सन्निधिम् means सत् + निधिम् \[Meaning great wealth (of knowledge/culture)\]

4\. Again सन्निधिम् means presence \[स्यात् सन्निधिः सन्निकर्षणम् इति कोशः\]

Hence, the meaning of the verse can be

  

Let Goddess Saraswati whose face resembles a beautiful lotus of the autumnal season and who is capable of giving everything, always blesses with her presence and bestow great wealth (of culture), in our speech.
