Yes, Sri Subrahmanian, the original reference is from Brhataranyakopanisad only (V.2.1). I mis-remembered it as being from the Isopanisad. Thank you for the correction.

  

Also, the English translation copy-pasted by me is faulty.

  

Sri Sarvepalli Radhakrsnan gives it as follows:

  

***"That is full, this is full. From fullness fullness proceeds. If we take away the fullness of fullness, even fullness then remains."***

  

I wonder if historically anyone else has also used this verse as a devotional template, replacing 'purna' with the name of the chosen Ishta-devata, like Siva or Devi. It is an interesting thought.
