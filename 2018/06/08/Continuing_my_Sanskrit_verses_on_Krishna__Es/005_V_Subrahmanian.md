Sir, I think you have a point. The word*Bhavānītvam* or bhavanitvam is not there in the verse as such. Yet, the idea is that when a person utters भवानि  as sambodhana, what is generally heard by a bystander
is the word with the long i. (This happens with other words such as Saraswati, MrDaani, etc.) So, the poem goes on to imply that the Mother hears this and even before the devotee completes the sentence with the rest of the words after tvam, she is eager to bless him with
*Bhavānītvam.* 

  

And about what Sri Harshavardhan said:

  

//ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पुर्णमुदच्यते

पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥

*Om.That is full; this is full.This fullness has been projected from that fullness.When this fullness merges in that fullness,all that remains is fullness.*  
  

from the Isa Upanisad.//

  

Actually this mantra, though Shanti paaTha for the Ishavashya Upanishad (being a shukla yajur vedic upanishad), it is actually found in the 5th adhyaya, first brahmanam of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (shukla yajurveda), just before 'kham brahma....', the only mantra in that brahmanam. The Purnamadah...mantra is elaborately commented upon by Shankaracharya in that place.
