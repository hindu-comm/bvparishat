Gopalasundari-Tika on Saundaryalahari interprets quite interestingly विष्णुपक्षे so: भवति अस्माद् इति भवो विष्णुः। स एव अनः प्राणोऽस्य इति भवानिः विष्णुभक्तः। तस्य भावः भवानित्वम्।

  

The word भव can also be understood by an Advaitin as ब्रह्म (विभुत्वाद्विष्णुः or जगत्कारणं ब्रह्म) and then भवानिः would be अद्वयभक्तः leading to ब्रह्मत्वम् as the meaning of भवानित्वम् and thereby जीवन्मुक्तिः as being granted by the Divine Mother (who Herself is not-different from brahman).
