Dear Madhav ji,

  

This set is full of exalted Vedantic purport. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Sharing a couple of my thoughts below.

> O Kr̥ṣṇa, I beg for your dark hue, and I am willing to give everything > I have. Take everything, but give me just this one thing. O Mādhava, > what will you lose? >
>

This reminds one of a verse of Shankaracharya in the Soundaryalahari:

  

भवानि त्वं दासे मयि वितर दृष्टिं सकरुणां  
इति स्तोतुं वाञ्छन् कथयति भवानि त्वमिति यः ।  
तदैव त्वं तस्मै दिशसि निजसायुज्यपदवीं  
मुकुन्द-ब्रम्हेन्द्र स्फुट मकुट नीराजितपदाम् \|\|

  

"O Goddess, you, on this your servant, bestow a kind look"  
Thus intending to adore, no sooner one begins saying: "O Goddess, you..",  
You grant him that state of identity with you, \[भवानि त्वम्........भवानित्वम् \]  
The same as what Vishnu, Brahma and Indra accomplished by the waving of the bright lights on their diadems.

> > कृष्णमद: कृष्णमिदं कृष्णात्कृष्णमुदच्यते । >

This is simply marvelous. Purnamadah.....

This last two again reminds one of a verse from the Vishnu ShaTpadee stotram of Shankaracharya:

  

``` सत्यपि भेदापगमे नाथ तवाहं न मामकीनस्त्वम् । सामुद्रो हि तरङ्गः क्वचन समुद्रो न तारङ्गः ॥ ३॥ ```

Oh! Protector! Even with the difference (between You and me) passing off, I become Yours but You do not become mine. Indeed (though there is no difference between the waves and the ocean) the wave belongs to the ocean but nowhere (never) does the ocean belong to the wave. (3)

  

Thanks once again for this brilliant treat.

  

warm regards
