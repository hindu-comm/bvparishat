Also, the verse

  

कृष्णमद: कृष्णमिदं कृष्णात्कृष्णमुदच्यते ।

कृष्णस्य कृष्णमादाय कृष्ण एवावशिष्यते ।।३४४।।

*That is Kr̥ṣṇa and this is Kr̥ṣṇa.Kr̥ṣṇa arises from Kr̥ṣṇa.Having taken Kr̥ṣṇa from Kr̥ṣṇa, Kr̥ṣṇa alone remains behind.*  

  

is reminiscent of the following verse

  

ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पुर्णमुदच्यते  
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥

*Om.That is full; this is full.This fullness has been projected from that fullness.When this fullness merges in that fullness,all that remains is fullness.*  
  

from the Isa Upanisad.
