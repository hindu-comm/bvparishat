Dear scholars,

  

Can someone throw light on the writers of Sanskrit commentaries on the Ramayana? I am trying to know their historical details of Govindaraja, Ramabhirama Tilaka, Maheswara Tirtha and Sivasahaya. Govindaraja quotes Tirtha and Tilaka too.

I do have their commentaries but there are no details of them in the editions I have.
