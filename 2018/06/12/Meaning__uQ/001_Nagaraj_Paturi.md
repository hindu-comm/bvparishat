I is self-referral. Self is the third person form of the same.

  

Similar is the difference between aham and aatman in Sanskrit.

  

That is why English for aatman is self not soul etc.

  

Me is the dviteeyaa or karmakaarakabodhaka form or form for accusative case or form used to indicate the object of the verb for I. But it is in English it is an occasionall idiomatic expression used as a synonym for myself .

  

Myself is the reflexive form of I. It is used in the sense of 1. emphasis of I : I myself did it (no other person) or 2. with my own efforts, without any help from others: I did it myself (without help from others)

  

But 'myself' too, like 'me' , is used as the third person form of I.

  

"Me and my mom" = " Myself and my mother"

  

'Self' is not used in such contexts.

  

"Oh, Me!", "Me?" are some other usages where "Me" is used in the sense of "I".

  

Just as self is not usually used in sentences as third person expression of I, aatman is not used in sentences as third person expression of I.

  

But it is used in forms such as aatmaanam, aatmanaa, aatmani etc. and in compounds such as aatmakrita etc.
