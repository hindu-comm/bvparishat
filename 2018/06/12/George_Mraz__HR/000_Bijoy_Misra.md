Friends,

India's cause in the world would not be publicly known without the support and

assistance of people abroad. Many in outside world were influenced by the Indian

thoughts and some accepted them as a way of life. Emerson taught, Thoreau left

home. Swami Vivekanada came and made many disciples. US eventually helped

India to gain freedom from the British.

I met a man of extremely high caliber and diligent to the bone at the local

Ramakrishna Vedanta Society. He acted as the Manager in the Monastery and

served as an Assistant to Swami Sarvagatananda who had his own trail.

The Monastery became the nucleus of Indian scholarship and activism in Boston.

Swami passed away in 2009 and George Mraz left for an Elderly Home.

George passed away in a Nursing Home last month at 95.

I wrote an obituary for him and I am sharing.

Our salutations to the souls who nourish the world!
