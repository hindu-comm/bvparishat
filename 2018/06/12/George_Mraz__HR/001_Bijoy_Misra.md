Dear Jaidev,

I believe altruism is a human condition and we tend to suppress it under various pretexts, mostly in fear of survival.

It becomes difficult to imagine that our life is a gift to us and we don't have ownership. I called it India's discovery

and spoke about it last Monday in the Lincoln Academy lecture.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
