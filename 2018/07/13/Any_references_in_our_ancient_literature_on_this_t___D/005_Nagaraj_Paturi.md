Regarding Prof, Bharat Gupt

  

This is a report published in another list:

  

Prof**BharatGupt**, a classicist and dharma shastra scholar gave a talk at the Habitat Centre on Nov 25 on "Hindu View of Homosexuality."Heexamined the issue along with a fellow speaker and discussant Dr. Come Carpentier. He observed that talking about the Rights of theHomosexual/Gayindividuals seems to be one of the major agendas of social reforms in India today. Many people think that ancient Hindu ideas were entirely compatible with the views of modern European and American notions.



 Therefore it was imperative that one goes to see the classical texts to collect evidence on the status and life of homoerotic individuals in ancient India. One hears all the time, he said, the usual sentiment that as Hinduism is a very tolerant culture, thatit was totally open homosexuality and that it was more modern than the moderns. Many people argue,like the scholars of the HareKrishna order, that as Hinduism believes that everyhuman being is part of Supreme Being Brahma, homosexuals cannot be considered as beings of lower category. They also think, with out any evidence, that in the Vedic age, homosexuals were fully integrated into social and monastic orders. ProfGuptsaid that most of these sentiments are uninformed.



 Talking about the textual evidence,ProfGuptmentioned that the*KAMASUTRA*of Vatsyayana, does define a third order of humans called the*'tritiiyaa prakriti'*or third nature. Thisthirdnature persons areof two kinds, one of the female kind and the other of the male sort*("dvividhaa tritiityaaprkritih, striiruupinii**purusharuupinii ca."*2.9.1). Vatsyayana goes on to say that "she", who behaveslike a woman,is to be employed for oral sex ("*tasyaa vadane jaganakarma tadauparisht.akamm aachakshate"*2.9.3). She was a paid sex-worker like a courtesan (*'vaishyaavat charitam prakaashayet'*2.9.5) . For the male kind who has the desire for males but who cannot make her nature very evident, 'he' should take to the profession of massage-giver and thus coming into contact with males satisfy them throughoral sex (2.9.6-10). In this context the act of*auparisht.aka*is described in detail in the*Kamasutra*.



 The ancient Hindu society, as is evident here, did not consider the homosexuals as perverts or sinners.As the term,*tritiiya-prakriti*or third naturedescribes them,they are being themselves, they are being natural. Thisis the primary difference between the Christian and the Hindu attitude. Christianity did not accept the third nature and hence imposed a punishment on their activities.



 For the Hindu social order the homoerotic werenot expected to follow the heterosexual norms of behaviour. Sothey cannot be blamed for being what they are. And for this reason, accepting theirnature, theywere notexcommunicated or purged from human societies. Theyhad tobe given a place in it and they were to be protected and prevented from harm by the State. The*Arthashastra*prescribes a fine for those who persecuted a homoerotic person (3.18.4) and it does not prohibits making of eunuchs even in the conquered population by a kingby castrating captured males of the vanquished (13.5.13). Thus Hindu society accepted the third nature of persons who were born with it and did not want to replicate them for any purpose of social engineering. ProfGuptsaid thatChristians promoted homosexuals topractice religious castration and Muslimsprofusely castrated the vanquished populations to create classes of menial and warrior slaves.Dr. ComeCarpentier pointed outthat modern corporations want to promote homoeroticism as homosexuals not having the burden of familiesare great consumerists and hence great customers.



 While accepting the third nature persons, the ancient Hindus gave them a special place in the social order. They were designated to be part of the class of sex-workers and performers of music and dance. As till around the 10 century prostitution was a legal profession, taxed and protected by the State and enshrined as duty of the king in the dharmashastra texts, the homoerotics as part of the class of courtesans, musicians, dancers and performers had the legal protection and their incomes and their sustenance ensured. This position was certainly not respectable and was disadvantaged, as it was of a lower category. In fact, it was out of the*varna*order or*varnabaahya*. But they also had the freedom/advantage of not having any obligations of adopting/ raising any children or performing therituals for ancestor worship which was a majorobligation forthe*varna*Hindus. Difficult for usto imagine today, it was a free life in a major way.



 ProfGuptpointed out that ancient Hindu society envisaged marriage asprimarily devoted to procreation and raising of able and educated individuals who would contribute to society by performing duties to living and the ancestors. While pleasure (*rati*) was one aspect of sexuality,*dharma*(obligations) and*artha*(commerce) and moksha (liberation) were the other three. As the kinnars were not capable of doing obligations they were made into a special class and given a*jati*or guild. It may also be pointed out that many homoerotics, impotents or sperm-count deficient persons continued to be part of usual varnas and jatis. Ways were found to provide them heirsonemethod beingniyoga.



 Coming to the present day situation, ProfGuptsaid that historical developments have jumbled up the ancient solution. The Islamic intervention in the medieval period altered the status and social acceptability of the homoerotic class. The performing arts of theatre and dance were now taboo in urban life and prostitution lost its legal andrespectable statusthough still preserving itself as a repository of music and dance.However,homoerotics had a much greater employment in harems of Sultans and Rajas and a connection with espionage as of yore.



 It is the British who delivered the stroke of grace for the homoerotics. The Biblical and Christian prejudice against sodomy turned the kinnars of India into criminals. It delegitimizedthe profession they had earlier and prevented them from taking to a new one. As Indians have been too slow to alter the Criminal Procedure Code, the section stating punishmentfor homoerotic contact has not been still eliminated from Indian Law. It should be soon done away with the traditional freedom restored.But the dismemberment of these people from social order created by the British cannot be restored so easily.It would take some serious research to find out what are they now tending towards as professions. At a cursory glance one may say they are to be found a lot in fashion and film industry.



 ProfGupt, then commented upon the contentious issue seizing the arena of debate, whethergaymarriage should be legalized or not. He expressed his candid opinion that whilegaycohabitation should not be illegal, persecuted or even frowned upon,giving the samerights togaycohabiters as to the married heterosexuals couples is not advisable.Some difference betweengaypartnership and heterosexual marriage isnecessary. Heargued that children adopted by gaysare very likely going to acquire agaysyndrome. This is going to be unhealthy forthe institution of family which is already under many threats and is almost on the verge of extinction in Europe and America.



 Dr. Come Carpentier made the most revealing suggestion that Western fascination with homoeroticism is based on consumerism. Under the garb of providing equality the same right lobby is going to creategreater instability asgaymarriages do not hold any particular assurances of stability. He agreed that adopted children of gaysare verylikely to begayand thus we create unnatural gays. Putin has explicitly stated that Russia under a population decline and they need more childrenwhichgaymarriages are not going to provide.Dr.Carpentier said, that gays are asking asking for unrestricted cohabitation, then property inheritance and finally all the parity with non-gaymarriage.



 The talk was followed by a very animated and prolonged discussion. Many in the audience believed that there should be no discrimination and as increasing the population was no longer a necessity in the modern world,gaymarriages are in no way detrimental to society while others thought them bad for the instition named as family.
