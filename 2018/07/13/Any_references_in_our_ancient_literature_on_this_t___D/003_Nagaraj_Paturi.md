1\. As part of my career in Cultural Studies, I studied a practice where men live as women (as transvestites) indedication to the devataa Renukaa-Ellamma. This cult is prevalent in the area covered by Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and southern Andhra Pradesh. These individuals are called Jogappas. They are respected by the society around them and people are scared to make any adverse comment about them. Prof.Alf Hiitbeitel studied a parallel cult in Tamil Nadu called Aravan cult related to the story of Babhruvahana.

  

2\. All of us in India know that people called 'Hijras' (people bundle many shades of -beyond two gender behaviour- into that category), visit houses to 'bless' at the occasion of auspicious events at home and people do not ridicule them ;on the other hand donate to them significant amounts. Of course, nowadays , the behaviour some of these turning rash and people reciprocating the same rashness towards them has become common place. But the customs and norms of not hurting or offending them as far as possible prevail even today.

  

3\. I presented papers at the University of Chicago seminars highlighting how absence of such cults, customs and traditions added with the Christian attitude towards such aspects puts the 'queers' in the western world at the risk of social offence and how such cults, customs and traditionsshelter the Indian 'queers' saving them from social offence.
