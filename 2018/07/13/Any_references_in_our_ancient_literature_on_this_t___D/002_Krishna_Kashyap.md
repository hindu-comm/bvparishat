Garbhopanishat statement shows that such a nature is natural. it is not by choice they become like that. it is genetic.

  

It is well known that it is genetic. However semiticreligions condemn it and state that such people should be killed as it is a sin (this is in the bible etc.). extreme literal scholars believe in those statements and harass these people who are LGBT. in youtube you can see videos of extreme punishment to such LGBT like throwing them off tall buildings etc are there.

  

in kamasutrathe tritiya prakritiis discussed. it says kings should give protection and special kind of jobs to such people.

  

Many people who are against LGBT should be asked, if someone in their family, such an LGBT is born what would they do?

  

It seems the same question was asked to a person at work, who is from pakistan. That lady said, such people should be reformed using help of mullahs.

If that does not work, they should be killed. Many people have been killed with this kind of view.
