  I understand that there are some references such as -Prof. Bharat Gupt spoke in favour of    such behaviours on the basis of Kaama Sutras etc.

  

  Devdutt Patnaik wrote a book bringing support for such behaviours from our sacred narratives    (itihaasa-puranas)

  

   I have not read these books/papers.
