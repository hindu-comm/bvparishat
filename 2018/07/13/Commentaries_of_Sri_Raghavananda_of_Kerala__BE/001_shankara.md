Subbuji,

  

Paramarthasara with commentary of Raghavananda is available at [archive.org](http://archive.org). His commentary on Laghustuti is also there - TSS 60. I have not seen his Bhagavata or Bhujagaprayata commentaries. BTW, do you read Malayalam script? Sometimes, his commentaries in Malayalam script could be easier to trace.

shankara
