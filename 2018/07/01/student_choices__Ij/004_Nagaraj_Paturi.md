I said in a response to Aayushmaan Debarshi's post in the thread,

the hierarchy of the contemporary social order is the root of whatever is being discussed.

  

It is a world-wide situation not just limited to India.

  

Job-oriented, earning-oriented families and students world over prioritise earning giving that too more earning giving courses. Such families and students are very big in number compared to the families and students who are not job-oriented and earning-oriented. Greater and greater funding is received with greater and greater ease by Engineering, Medicine departments; next come the science departments; next come the Social Sciences; Humanities stand at the bottom. Language courses form part of the Humanities basket. Fate of Sanskrit is part of fate of Humanities itself. This was what Dr Yadu-ji and Prof. Madhav-ji found during their days. This is what prevails today. Describing this reality is not to insult the fields in the lower strata of hierarchy of contemporary social order. There have always been exceptions. Brilliant students all out of their choice pursuing sciences in preference in more earning giving Engineering and Medicine courses or Bright students all out of their choice pursuing social sciences or humanities has always been there. Such geniuses choosing Sanskrit also has always been there.How else did we get all the guiding figures of our list? But this has always been hard as it is swimming against the tide.

  

Even in the past, the equivalents of today's Humanities, pure s'aastras such as nyaaya or vyaakaraNa were pursued by the caste that was not earning oriented. All other professional skills which give good earning were the caste occupations of all other castes. Today people say that all the knowledge pursued by that caste was 'denied' to the other castes as if all other castes would have chosen the studies that are not rewarding in terms of earning.

  

While this is the situation to blame the current preferences of the society on the 'failure' of the Humanities' teachers in general and Sanskrit teachers in particular, particularly this blame coming from those who avoided the challenge of swimming against the tide is not fair.
