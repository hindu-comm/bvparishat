Yadu Moharir  

e\. When I was growing-up in India, all top students went to Engineering, Students who did not get admissions accredited themselves with 2 yrs of Biology courses and then then went to Medical Schools. Folks who could not get admissions continued their pure science degree (B.Sc., M.Sc.).  

  

Dear Sri Moharir,

I have seen postings from you before. But this was blatant.

I don't know where you grew up and when. India has been a home

of sciences. Raman, Bose, Saha, Bhabha were in the sciences.

What you wrote is a gross mis-statement. Some families did

push their wards to be get into Administration (I thought it was a waste).

Some insecure families pushed their wards to security of engineering and

medicine. Students did not choose them. Most students loved Physics,  

extremely bright students went to the languages. Student aptitude is

different from the call for survival. Indian students must look for much better

scholarship and interdisciplinary research than joining the service industry.

Please encourage new students to create a goal of pursuing unsolved

problems than somehow be able to pay rent! I understand the economic

pressure, but we remind ourselves that India has been a land of creativity

and inventions. Let the students strive for their fulfillment in the free nation!

Assuming you are a senior person, I am disappointed!
