Some of the situation in India that Dr. Moharir describes during his time as student matches my years of being a student in Pune. In my college classes in Pune, the proportion of boys to girls was something like 1 to 10, and it was the general feeling among families that girls do not have to worry about getting a job, and they can just get married and will be fine. On the other hand, many of my relatives expressed worries about my future. How was I going to make a living?
Fortunately, things worked out for me, but the general worry about finding a job with Sanskrit education was very much on the mind of the families in those days. It is a different matter that there were many exceptionally brilliant girls in the Sanskrit classes and found jobs in that field. I would like to know if the job market is changing these days in India for students of Sanskrit. I hope that is the case. My old impression was that the three-language formula that was adopted by the government of India essentially decimated the teaching of Sanskrit in most of non-Hindi-speaking area of India, and with that the school teachers' jobs pretty much disappeared. At some point, I remember that one could no longer do a B. Ed. with Sanskrit in Maharashtra, since most schools terminated Sanskrit teaching jobs. However, my impressions are not current, and may no longer be valid. Best,
