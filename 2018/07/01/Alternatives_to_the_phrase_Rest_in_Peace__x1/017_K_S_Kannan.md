I fully agree with 'Shankara'-ji, and Subrahmnian-ji.

  

It is because of the ***bhinna-ruci*** idea that attainment of specific *loka*-s were mentioned

(as governed, too, though by the *karman*-s of the *jIva*-s.

  

And co-planar with *s'As'vatI s'Anti*,

***s'As'vatam sukham*** was also mentioned in the sam strain in the *upanis"ad*-s.

  

"RIP" looks simple and desirable, but as 'Shankara'-ji shows,

it is laden with the Abrahamic assumptions

and shadowed by their apprehensions

that do not have a proper match with our conceptualisations and visions.
