Pranams,  

  

We find that Indians largely use the phrase 'May his/her soul rest in Peace' or simply 'RIP' when someone passes away, without bothering about the cultural connotations of the above phrases. The present generation is so much alienated from their own culture that they are ignorant of the concepts of Atma, Paraloka, Moksha, Punarjanma, etc.   

  

Though a discussion on this topic was initiated by Prof. Paturiji sometime back (link [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/phYRsGFBMLQ/HSI-RoB6nZAJ)), unfortunately there was not much response from esteemed members of BVP at that time.

  

I humbly request all scholars to suggest alterative phrases in line with Indian culture and tradition, that could be used in place of 'RIP'.  

  

regards  
shankara
