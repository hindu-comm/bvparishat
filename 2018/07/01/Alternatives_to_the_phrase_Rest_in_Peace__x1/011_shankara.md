Namaste,

  

Thank you. श्रद्धाञ्जलि is a good alternative.  

  

I was thinking of compiling all such alternatives in some place in public domain, where it would be accessible to all (in addition to BVP). So, I request again for more such phrases (they need not be in Sanskrit only, phrases in regional languages are also welcome).  

  

regards  
shankara
