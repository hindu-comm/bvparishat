Subbuji,

  

Thanks for suggesting alternatives to RIP.

Vedantic concept of शाश्वती शान्तिः and the 'Peace' in 'RIP' are not the same. Christians believe that the soul will lie in the coffin till the Day of Judgment when the Lord will awaken all souls and send the believers to the Heaven and the non-believers to the Hell. The phrase RIP is based on the above belief.  

  

regards  
shankara
