The concluding chapter of *manusmRti* provides a grand and panoramic vision of life as a whole

\- across, that is, the births past and future.

  

And suggesting a primary and vital motive of all action, it says there (12.23)

... *dRs"TvA jIvasya **gatIH*** ....

  

There is also the concept of "***gati**-cintana*" regularly used in respect the post-mortem obsequies.

  

Further, the Lord characterises himself in the *gItA* as

"***gatir** bhartA prabhus sAks"I nivAsas' s'araNam suhRt*".

  

Whether we intend the *jIva* to reach the Lord Himself in respect of an extraordinary life led,

or conceive of its itinerary in particular *loka*-s (and further *yoni*-s if any) as per its deserts,

the expression ***gati*** fits them all as a dignified cover term.

  

In the light of all these, I find the expression *sad-gati* for the departed as quite appropriate.
