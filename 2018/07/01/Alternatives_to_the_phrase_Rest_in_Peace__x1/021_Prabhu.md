Shankara-ji Very apt topic indeed.

  

RIP usage is a poster child of our peoples' "mindless eclecticism".
May "RIP" RIP !

  

**प्राप्नोतु सद्गतिं ध्रुवं**prApnotu sadgatiM dhruvaM

hopefully is not a mouthful :-)

  

I find "sadgati" very appropriate (and do use it...apart from**हरिपदं**and**परमं पदं**)

especially given sadgati is a shrI naama of bhagavAn:

**सद्गतिः सत्कृतिः सत्ता सद्भूतिः सत्परायणः**  

...

  

Also any of BG 2.17 - 2.30 may be invoked appropriately in such a shoka samaya.
