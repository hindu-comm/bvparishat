Sri Subrahmanyam-garu,

  

In your first mil you mentioned

  

given that vast vocabulary of Telugu is actually derived from Sanskrit,

the meanings for Sanskrit words can be found in Telugu dictionaries.

  

In the latest one also you are repeating

  

As good amount of Telugu vocabulary is derived from Sanskrit...... one can find meanings of Sanskrit words in Telugu dictionary category itself.  

  

While it is true that Telugu (like many Indian languages including Tamil) has a very big amount of words having origin in Sanskrit, such words have a very big amount of semantic change and as such, a meaning in Telugu dictionary for a Sanskrit derived Telugu word may not always be useful for a general Sanskrit user.
