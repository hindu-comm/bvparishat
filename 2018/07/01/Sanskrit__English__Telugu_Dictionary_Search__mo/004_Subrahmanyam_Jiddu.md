Namaste Nagaraj mahodaya,

  

As it is not intuitive for people to search for Sanskrit words in Telugu dictionary, I had emphasized this unstated feature for two reasons:

  

1. The "Vavilla Sanskrit-Telugu Nighantuvu (year 1943)" was included in Andhrabharati website in Telugu dictionaries category (probably because the original was in Telugu script but not Devanagari). Due to this, one cannot make use of it in Sanskrit dictionary category. Similarly, "Samskruta Nyayamulu (1939)" is also available in Telugu dictionary category only.

  

2\. Coming to your point... I agree that some Sanskrit words adopted in Telugu have a slightly different meaning as compared to original Sanskrit words (for example, "Tatha" in Telugu means grand father while it means father in Sanskrit, also "Alasyam" in Telugu means delay/late while in Sanskrit it means Laziness)... That said, i would call these as just exceptions and i think their number will be much smaller compared to the number of words where the meanings are same both in Sanskrit and Telugu. So, i feel, there is merit in looking up Sanskrit words in one's own native language dictionaries where one can get clearer meanings as compared to Sanskrit-English dictionaries, most of which are authored by foreign writers except for the Apte one.

  

Moreover, i would like to highlight the scholarship of the ancient Indian dictionary authors. If we lookup a few Sanskrit words where the meanings are somewhat different in Telugu, the authors have listed all the possible meanings of the given word and also called out the differences between Sanskrit and Telugu meanings for readers' attention. Kudos to them!

  

Regards,

Subbu
