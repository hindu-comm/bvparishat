Here is a very useful online Sanskrit \<=> English and Telugu dictionary search service that aggregates and searches through all the major dictionaries. The best part is we can search for Sanskrit words in Telugu dictionary itself because they have linked up the Vavilla Sanskrit-Telugu dictionary and also given that vast vocabulary of Telugu is actually derived from Sanskrit, the meanings for Sanskrit words can be found in Telugu dictionaries.

  

I found this of immense help to lovers of both Sanskrit and Telugu languages whenever difficult words are encountered.Ever since i chanced upon this website, i almost stopped referring to Sanskrit-English dictionaries and finding the authentic meanings of sanskrit words in Telugu dictionaries written by authoritative pandits of the past.Thought of sharing with you all so that you too may be benefited.

  

Regards,

Subrahmanyam
