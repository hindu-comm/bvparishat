As good amount of Telugu vocabulary is derived from Sanskrit and also the inclusion of Vavilla Sanskrit-Telugu dictionary in the Telugu dictionary category, one can find meanings of Sanskrit words in Telugu dictionary category itself. I am finding this unstated feature of Andhrabharati particularly useful.
