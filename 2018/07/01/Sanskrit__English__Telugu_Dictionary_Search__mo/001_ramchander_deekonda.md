I have been using this portal for the past 5 years. This is a marvellous contribution by "Andhra Bharati". Apart from more than 50 Telugu-Telugu and Telugu-English and 3 rare Urdu-Telugu dictionaries, this portal has several Sanskrit-English dictionaries including Monier Williams, Cappeller, Apte etc. Work is progress to include  
sabdakalpadruma, vacaspatya etc. Sanskrit nyayas are also available here.  
  
A great facility to all Sanskrit learners and lovers of Sanskrit, Telugu and Urdu.  
  
Regards,
