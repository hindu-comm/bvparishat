Namaste,  

  

All three editions of Harivamsa with TIka, that I mentioned are equally good, well proof-read and quality printing.

  

There is also HV with Tika published as part of the reputed 'Chitrashala' edition from Pune in 1936, which was later re-printed by MRML (Munshiram Manoharlal), if you are looking for hard-copy. Digital versions of all the older editions are available at [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

Link to Chitrasala edition of HV with Tika -

You will find a lot more information on Harivamsa translations and editions at Harivamsa Resources -

(I, somehow, forgot to mention this website yeseterday).  

  

regards  
shankara
