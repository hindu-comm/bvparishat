Rama Deekonda posted question on Allopanishada.

In five places in Kuran, "O people I picked up mountain and held as umbrella, keep faith in me". I took Kuran and met our muslim brothers in Houston. They say they do not have answers. Problem of Islam and his son-in-law said. "Divine fragrance comes to us from India. Before Prophet changed the calendar, Hindu Vijaya Dashami, Arab Ashura and Jewish Yom Kippur used to be the same according to the ancient Luni-solar combined calendar. When Prophet left Makka went to Madina, Jews were celebrating Yom Kippur. Prophet said to his followers this our Ashura day. Keep fast on this day. I think I posted this on BVP. Research is needed. Why my research-for Pandaaraka teertha created by Bhagvan Shree Krishna by his own hands. What happened there? N.R.Joshi.
