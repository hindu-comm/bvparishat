Namaste,

  

I'm looking for any earlier reference of Navagunjara (a form of Lord Vishnu, or another form of Vishvarupam of Lord Krishna) other than by Odia poet Sri Sarala Dasa.

  

All internet searches point to the Mahabharata edition writen by Sarala Dasa (around 15th century).  

  

Some archeological researchers "[From the Harappan Chimaeras to Navagunjara Two Composite Creatures at the Opposite Ends of the Iconographic Tradition of the Subcontinent - Dennys Frenez](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dennys_Frenez/publication/323548472_From_the_Harappan_Chimaeras_to_Navagunjara_Two_Composite_Creatures_at_the_Opposite_Ends_of_the_Iconographic_Tradition_of_the_Subcontinent/links/5a9c7189a6fdcc3cbacd5463/From-the-Harappan-Chimaeras-to-Navagunjara-Two-Composite-Creatures-at-the-Opposite-Ends-of-the-Iconographic-Tradition-of-the-Subcontinent.pdf)" also gave reference to this (Sarala Dasa) work only, nothing beyond that!  

  

This Navagunjara form is sculpted on Sri Jagannath Puri Temple as well as on the Neela Chakra (disc on top of the temple). So I wonder is there any reference to Navagunjar in any scriptures?  

  

Dhanyoshmi,

Sunil
