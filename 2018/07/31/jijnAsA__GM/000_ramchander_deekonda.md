Respected scholars,  
  
Linguists tell us that there is still extant a language (Brahui) among tribes of Northwest frontier region of present Pakistan. We are also taught that Brahui is akin to Dravidian languages. We know that our great Panini was a native of a neighbouring region of Swat.  
  
This being the case, I sincerely request the our scholars to enlighten me if there are any references by Panini in his works regarding this dialect.  
  
Regards  
Ramchander Deekonda
