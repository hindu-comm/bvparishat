One theory is that the Brahui are a[relict population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relict_population "Relict population")of Dravidians, surrounded by speakers of[Indo-Iranian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages "Indo-Iranian languages"), remaining from a time when Dravidian was more widespread. Another theory is that they migrated to[Baluchistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baluchistan "Baluchistan")from[inner India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_India "Mainland India")during the early Muslim period of the 13th or 14th centuries.^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahui_people#cite_note-6))A third theory says the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from[Central India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_India "Central India")after 1000 AD. The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) influence in Brahui supports this last hypothesis.  

  

Based on such hypothesis, there is no chance of Panini knowing this tribe.

Panini's focus is Sanskrit and its Vedic variation.

  

He did not cover other languages.
