Hari Om

  

I am looking for affordable editions (physical volumes) of english translations (with sanskrit text) of all available purana-s (and upapurana-s).

  

MLBD has a series of publications in this respect, but the prices, for an individual such as myself, seem a tad prohibitive. I think there must be other Indian indological publishers with their own series, which I don't know of.

  

Could scholars or researchers here kindly indicate any publishers who are publishing pouranik translations at affordable price-points?

  

regards

RK

  

P.S: Intending to start the collection with the major purana-s (if series are incomplete/costly). Can take paperback editions to shave cost. Thanks.
