Dear Friend,

  

Acharya Shriram Sharma,the noted Acharya of Gayatri Parivar,has translated some Puranas in Hindi,but, unfortunately,he has omitted many Sargas from the Puranas.

  

In olden times,Marathi translations of many Puranas were published from Pune etc.

  

You may inquire with the Librarian of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute,Deccan Gymkhana,Pune -411004-Maharashtra.Thry may be able to guide you.

  

Otherwise,only translations(will the Sanskrit Text) are also available.

  

Best luck in your search.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
