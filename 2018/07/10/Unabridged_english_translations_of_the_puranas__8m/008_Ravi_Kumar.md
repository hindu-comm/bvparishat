Gita Press: Except for Srimad Bhagavatam, they have not translated any other purana in english. (I have that edition). I also have their english translation of Valmiki Ramayana by the way. But I am searching not for itihasa but for purana-s.

  

TTD: They have done some abridged english translations of some puranas, so far as I can see from their ebooks catalog. But I am looking not for ebooks but proper physical hard copies. I could not find their physical publications catalog. If you have it by any chance, would appreciate if you could share.

  

As you can appreciate, this is a genuine query (i.e., not put in haste).
