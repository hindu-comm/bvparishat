Hari Om

  

I have a small doubt for the consideration of venerable scholars here:

  

Taking the Taittiriya Upanishad's specific instruction of guru to graduating student regarding marrying and not cutting off the family line (i.e. having children) as the discussion point, I am curious if there is any reason for the high emphasis in Indian dharma regarding marriage other than the karmic runa (debt) discharge idea. Is the triple debt to pitris, guru and parents the only impelling idea for marriage in Indian dharma?

  

Apologies if this is not germane to the main discussion.

  

regards

RK
