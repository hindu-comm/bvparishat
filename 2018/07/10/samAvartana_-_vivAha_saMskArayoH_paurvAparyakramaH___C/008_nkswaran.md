**अथ एतदपरं तूष्णीमेव तीर्थे स्नात्वा तूष्णीग्ं समिधम् आदधाति -- आप गृ सू 5-13-1**

**This सूत्रम् is for a person has got a विवाह fixed immediately after स्नातकम्** **।**

May l know how the cited sutra is interpreted to the effect that there should not be temporal gap between Snana and Vivaha. It simply enjoins an optional modus operandi for the performance of Snana samskara avoiding all rites accompanied with grhyamantra-s.
