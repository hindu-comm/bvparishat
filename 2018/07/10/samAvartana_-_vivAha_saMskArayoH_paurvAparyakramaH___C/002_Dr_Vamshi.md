Thanks for the detailed reply. The problem arising is about - अनाश्रमी न तिष्ठते दिनमेकमपि द्विजः। Yajnavalkya Smruti, Brahma Sutra Shaankara Bhashya quote this Vachana of Daksha.

  

This probably means to cut down the delay between the Brahmacharya and Gruhastha Ashrama - which would promote unruly psychology in adolescents/ teenagers/ free lancers.

  

Some overstretch the rule, stating that they can not be even travel in between these two Samskaras. Some even claim that Snaataka has to be completed within hours, before Muhurtam - which clearly contradicts the spirit of Snaatakam.

  

As per my study - Snaataka is a ritual of Guru Kula, where by the lad is relieved from the stringent rules of Guru Kula. Aapastamba has made it amply clear. Consult your peers take a considered decision.

  

What should be the prominence given to the suggestion/ stipulation of Daksha. Violation prescibesKruchchra.
