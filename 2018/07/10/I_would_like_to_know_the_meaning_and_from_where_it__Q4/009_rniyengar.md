The GhaTa-sarpa episode in Harivams'a seems to have a connection here: This is one case where Krishna's method did not work as per the epic. This was also the reason for him leaving Mathura and emigrating towards the west coast. I am posting here an extract available on line at

varddhituM naiva shakShyAma pure.asminniti keshavaH \|\|2-57-31  
apayAne matiM kR^itvA dUtaM tasmai sasarja ha \|

(vaishampAyana said: O janamejaya !) Considering that it is not possible to flourish in the city, keshava (kR^iShNa) decided to leave (mathurA) and sent a messenger to him (kAlayavana).

tataH kumbhe mahAsarpaM bhinnA\~njanachayopamam \|\|2-57-32  
ghoramAshIviShaM kR^iShNaM kR^iShNaH prAkShepayattadA \|

Then kR^iShNa put a terrible great black poisonous serpent, similar in colour to lamp black, in a pot.

tatastaM mudrayitvA tu svena dUtena hArayat \|\|2-57-33  
nidarshanArthaM govindo bhIShayAmAsa taM nR^ipam \|

govinda (kR^iShNa) sealed the pot and sent it through a messenger to the (yavana) king for seeing, to frighten the (yavana) king.

sa dUtaH kAlayavane darshayAmAsa taM ghaTam \|\|2-57-34  
kAlasarpopamaH kR^iShNa ityuktvA bharatarShabha \|

The messenger kept the pot for kAlayavana to see and said, O the best of bharata (janamejaya), (vaishampAyana said ) that kR^iShna is comparable to the serpent of time (kAla - death).

tatkAlayavano buddhvA trAsanaM yAdavaiH kR^itam \|\|2-57-35  
pipIlikAnAM chaNDAnAM pUrayAmAsa taM ghaTaM \|

Understanding the threat of yAdava-s, kAlayavana filled the pot completely with violent ants.

sa sarpo bahubhistIkShNaiH sarvatastaiH pipIlikaiH \|\|2-57-36  
bhakShyamANaH kilA\~NgeShu bhasmIbhUto.abhavattadA \|

The serpent bitten violently by many ants all over its body became powder at that time.

taM mudrayitvA tu ghaTaM tathaiva yavanAdhipaH \|  
preShayAmAsa kR^iShNAya bAhulyamupavarNayan \|\|2-57-37

Sealing the pot as it is, the yavana king, sent it to kR^iShNa to describe his abundance (of power).

vAsudevastu taM dR^iShTvA yogaM vihatamAtmanaH \|  
utsR^ijya mathurAmAshu dvArakAmabhijagmivAn \|\|2-57-38

Seeing that his strategy has failed, vAsudeva (kR^iShNa) immediately left mathurA and went to dvAraka.
