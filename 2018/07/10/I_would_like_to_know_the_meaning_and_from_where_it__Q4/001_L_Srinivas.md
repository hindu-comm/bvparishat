Dear Krishna,

  

You may want to check 'kulasekaraazvaar vaibhavam' especially the story of the necklace that was lost. This is also captured in the taniyan verse beginning 'aaram keDap paran anpar' , attributed to Manakkal Nambi (Sri Ramamisra). The phrase 'kuDap pAmbu' occurs in the taniyan verse, being an exact equivalent of the phrase in point 'ghata sarpa'.

  

Hope this is helpful,

  

Srini
