Respected Prof. Nagaraj ji,

Namaste ! I am thankful to you for giving me a chance to explain ( in few words ) about the use of " Reconstructed Text ".

1.  While giving a title ( =Subject ) in the email, I prefered to put
    it in brief. So I used one aspect of my edition. But actually in the
    book ( on second page ), I have used two words :- **Reconstructed
    and Restored text**. 2.  There are more then 50% dialogs in Prakrit. But most the Prakrit
    portion is available in Maharashtri Prakrit, which was not in
    existing at the time of Kalidasa ! So, I have to *Reconstruct* them
    in Shauraseni Prakrit. ( According to Bharat's Natya-shastra, &
    Prakrit-Lakshanam of Chanda Kavi, the oldest Prakrit grammar. ) 3.  After studing all five recensions of the drama ingreat detail, I
    have ventured to remove all interpolated portions / versesand
    irrelevant stage-directions ( floating here and therein all
    recensions ! ). and *Restored* different scenes of the drama in
    general, and of thethird act in perticuler.Regards, v m bhatt
