A learned review on the same:

  

*Philology and Criticism*is the ﬁrst book of its kind. Incisive in its analysis, this book undertakes a rigorous defense of the Mahābhārata critical edition. Following a prologue and an introduction, this book is divided into three chapters.**Each chapter states a problem and discusses key concepts and principles in textual criticism pertaining to it.**Thereafter, the authors guide the reader through a history of responses to the problem. Each response is posed as an argument (via citing the critic who raised it). The authors address each argument individually in a separate section. In each section, they consider whether the argument can be defended from some perspective. Once they establish that the argument is untenable, they state their conclusion. In this way, they**systematically work through contemporary criticisms of the critical edition**, focusing primarily on Andreas Bigger’s and Reinhold Grünendahl’s work.

The ﬁrst chapter addresses the view that the constituted text of the critical edition reconstructs merely a late stage of the transmission. Although several scholars advocate this thesis (James L. Fitzgerald, for instance, thinks the critical edition reconstructs a “Gupta-era archetype,” which he elsewhere calls a “written Sanskrit text” of the epic), the authors focus on the thesis’s author: Andreas Bigger. Bigger holds that the critical edition merely reconstructs a text he calls the “normative redaction” of the Mahābhārata, supposedly the result of “a uniform redaction” of the epic undertaken during its ﬁrst transcription from a ﬂuid oral tradition. Adluri and Bagchee demonstrate the circularity of this claim. The second chapter addresses the underlying assumption of Bigger’s work, though it also broadens the scope to include other Mahābhārata critics. The authors show that Bigger’s thesis appears plausible only because scholars assume an oral epic preceded the written Sanskrit Mahābhārata. The authors demonstrate that their arguments are not stemmatic and hence do not hold. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the so- called analytic approach to the epic. The authors argue that this approach is premised on an uncritical view of Indian history, whose origins they outlined in their book*The Nay Science: A History of German Indology*. The third chapter, the longest in this book, addresses a perplexing problem: How were the Mahābhārata manuscripts classiﬁed? Were they classiﬁed by script as Grünendahl argues? The authors convincingly demonstrate that they were not. As they show, script cannot play a role in classiﬁcation for it is an external marker. This chapter also addresses Grünendahl’s claim that extensive contamination makes a critical edition of the Mahābhārata unachievable as well as his claim that focusing on a regional recension would have led to a better edition. The conclusion provides a summation not only of this book but also of the authors’ ﬁrst book. It**presents a serious challenge to contemporary Sanskrit philology inasmuch as it relies on opinion rather than argument**.

While I disagree with the authors in some respects (most notably on the southern recension’s place in the Mahābhārata tradition),*Philology and Criticism*will stimulate debate. It poses a major challenge to scholars who have made unguarded statements about the Mahābhārata’s origins in an oral tradition. As I have argued since 2001 (*Rethinking the Mahābhārata: A Reader’s Guide to the Education of the Dharma King*),**the notion of an oral epic is a myth. The Mahābhārata is clearly a written text. In all likelihood, a small group of Brahmans created it..**T. P. Mahadevan identiﬁes these Brahmans with the historical Pūrvaśikha Brahmans. In spite of the text’s expansion and changes, no evidence exists that it was ever transmitted orally.*Philology and Criticism*conclusively vindicates this view. As I demonstrated in my review of Fitzgerald’s translation of Books 11 and 12 of the Mahābhārata (in the*Journal of the American Oriental Society*), those who resurrect the oral hypothesis do so for ideological reasons rather than because persuasive historical evidence exists. Relying on nineteenth- century views of the epic (whose assumptions Adluri and Bagchee criticized in their ﬁrst book), they overlook the fact that the archetype presupposes a written transmission. Adluri and Bagchee have staked their position, and scholars in the future will have to account for their view in some way.

I hardly need add that***Philology and Criticism*is essential reading for Mahābhārata scholars**. This book signiﬁcantly advances our knowledge of the critical edition. It is an essential reference work— not least because of its appendices, which enable scholars to consult details of the edition without carrying around all 19 volumes of the edition.*Philology and Criticism*also addresses a major lacuna in Mahābhārata studies today. It is the**ﬁrst work to explain what the Mahābhārata critical edition is, how it was created, what its merits are and why criticisms of the edition are frequently based on insuﬃcient knowledge of the principles involved**. Though aimed at an advanced audience, the analysis is clear and systematic, and the arguments can be followed by anyone who takes the time and trouble (and perhaps uses paper and a pencil). In that sense it is not a diﬃcult book to read, though its**scope is breathtaking. Few today in Mahābhārata studies have such a thorough grasp of the critical edition or are as qualiﬁed to speak to the issues of textuality, orality, the manuscript tradition, what can be reconstructed and what can be shown with philological methods.**In my assessment, the authors present a cogent interpretation of the critical edition. Their clariﬁcation of its overarching project is brilliant and makes a lasting contribution to the ﬁeld.
