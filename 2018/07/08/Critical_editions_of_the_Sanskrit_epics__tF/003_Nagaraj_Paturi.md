From Dr Sunthar Visuvalingam's Abhinavagupta list:

  

This book is a guidebook. That means it is intended for use**. The reader must make use of the tools presented herein to test for herself the validity and rigor of the arguments of contemporary Mahābhārata scholars.**This is all the more necessary as hardly a ﬁeld of scholarship existing today is as rife with competing and contradictory theories as contemporary Mahābhārata studies. \[…\]**Regrettably, Mahābhārata studies has long been a stronghold of neo-Aryanist ideology, anti-Semitism and Romantic fantasy. Thus, this book has had to be equal parts guidebook and polemical essay.**As such, it owes as much to the tradition of Nietzsche as to that of West. There is no doubt in our minds that the great editors of classical and medieval texts made enduring contributions to the study of texts and, in particular, to the canons of method that enable us to expunge centuries of error and dross and come closer to the authors’ original texts. There is also no doubt in our minds that these techniques are also applicable (with the necessary riders and adjustments) to the study of Indian texts. \[…\] In fact, there is an entire tradition of Indian editors (not only V. S. Sukthankar, to whom this book is dedicated, but also S. K. Belvalkar, P. L. Vaidya and others) who could rightfully take their place alongside the great editors in the classics. But (and we are no less convinced of this than of the applicability of textual criticism to the Mahābhārata)**textual criticism cannot and may not be used to promote ideological agendas.**\[… The reader\] will ﬁnd examples of circular reasoning, conclusions that do not follow from their premises,[arguments*ad baculum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_baculum)and appeals to inappropriate authority. And she will ﬁnd that**the only two constants among these theses, theories and dogmatic positions are that Indians are not capable of reading their texts critically and that priests are corrupt and mendacious.**This failure to engage with the theory of textual criticism has extracted a heavy price. It has meant that Mahābhārata scholars have not kept abreast of recent developments in textual criticism, whether in the areas of hermeneutics, literary criticism, structuralism, post- Lachmannian theories of critical editing or the study of[variantistica](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/variantistica)— in short, that entire ﬁeld that is today denoted by the term “[ecdotics](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecdotica)” and encompasses the study of textual cultures in the widest sense. It has meant that**scholarship on the epic, even considered as arising out of and responding to the documentary impulse, has failed to contribute in any meaningful way to a history of the text. Against this intellectually stunted and resentment- driven science, Sukthankar’s genius stands out all the brighter.**



Adluri & Bagchee, “Preface” to*[Philology and Criticism](https://www.academia.edu/36999444/Philology_and_Criticism_Open_Access)*





In two books now, we have found that**whenever Indologists say that their work is secular, scientific, philological, critical and the like, what they really mean is that they are interested in a separation of the*realia*from the meaning of the text.**This separation, however, is anything but secular, since the emphasis on the*realia*over the text’s philosophical meaning is a characteristic feature of neo-Protestant theology, corresponding to the belief that only a reconstruction of the historical conditions (not only the events and personalities but also the moral and social codes) prevalent at the time the books of the Old and New Testaments were composed can permit readers to represent to themselves the respective authors’ state of mind at the time and hence, in an act of sympathetic understanding or*Einfühlung*, feel or experience what the author felt or experienced when writing the book in question. This task was all the more urgent in the case of those books that were held to be divinely inspired, for at stake was nothing less than gaining access to the true meaning of scripture, which had become contentious in the wake of challenges to the authority of the church. Yet, if the*realia*truly hold the key to understanding the text—indeed, if only*they*permit a correct understanding of the text, as the Indologists contend—then,**in reading the German Indologists’ work, we also must focus on the historical*realia*. If knowing about cattle is important to understanding the Vedic mind, how much more important is it to know about the Indologists’ religious and political commitments, especially as these translated into positions of authority, state-sponsored salaries and the ability to make self-authenticating statements? In our next book, we plan to do exactlythis.**



Adluri & Bagchee, “Epilogue” to*[Philology and Criticism](https://www.academia.edu/36999444/Philology_and_Criticism_Open_Access)*(p.339)



This panel examines the remaining tasks for Mahābhārata studies following the completion of the Mahābhārata critical edition (CE). As several scholars have recently argued, the completion of the CE represents a “watershed” in Mahābhārata studies (Adluri 2013). This panel provides an**overview of contemporary debates concerning the CE’s reception and proper use.**Does it, as some argue, merely reconstruct a “normative redaction” such that “higher criticism” can reconstruct an earlier stage of the transmission (Bigger 1998)? Or does it, as others argue, offer a definitive text for exploring the Mahābhārata’s “literary design” (Hiltebeitel 2001, Adluri and Bagchee, eds. 2016)? This three-part workshop covers textual criticism and the creation of the Mahābhārata CE, the application of “critical” methods to the Mahābhārata and the Bhagavadgītā, and the Mahābhārata’s traditional reception. It is**intended as an introduction for students wishing to undertake research into the Mahābhārata**.
