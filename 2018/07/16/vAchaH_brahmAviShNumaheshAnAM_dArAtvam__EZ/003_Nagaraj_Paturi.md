This may provide more clues:

  

In the prasiddha Sarasvatee kshetra at Baasara in Telangana, the idol of Sarasvatee is given the VeeNaadhaariNee form only after abhisheka. The form during abhisheka is called Raajaraajeswaree. I heard from the priests during the kaivaaras and jayakaaras lines such as Vemulavada Raajaraajeshvara svaamiki jai alongside Raajaraajeswari maataa ki jai.

  

You know that Vemulavada deity is Shiva only.

  

I visited small neglected shrines of Mahaalakshmi and Mahaakaali in the close vicinity of the main shrine of Sarasvatee making the place a complex of the three shrines one of them getting extremely great attention.
