Karthik ji,

  

Do you automate the assembly of individual PNGs into the mega-PNG to be fed to Google?

And also, if the limit on PNG size is 2MB, how many pages did you manage to get into a single mega-PNG?

In other words, I'm trying to see how labour-intensive a 150 page doc is with your method and how it can be automated as much as possible.

  

Thank you,

Irene
