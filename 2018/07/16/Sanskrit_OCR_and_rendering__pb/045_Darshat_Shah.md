Yes agree with Sudarshan.

<http://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com> is hooked up to google cloud vision api. It wasn't working very well on handwritten docs a few months back. Lately the API seems to have improved a lot. As an example, it detects the text on the margin rotated by 90 in the attached image.

  

It also supports[batch](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/batch) mode (up to 2000 images) so if directly using the API then the mega merge approach should not be needed I think. The Vedvaapi team at IIITH are building a transcription/ocr platform with google ocr as one of the options. So hopefully everybody can use that platform -<https://www.vedavaapi.org/>
