Is it yajur, Rk or sAma? If it's Rk, you have many options. If it's taittirIya-yajur and you are extremely particular, then that'a a different story. I am not sure about sAman, but Wikner has very good support there. The phonology of taittirIya-yajur is extremely involved and you may have to resort to Wikner to produce high quality documents if they are to be used as recitation aids.
