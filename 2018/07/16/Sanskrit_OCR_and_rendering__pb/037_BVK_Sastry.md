Namaste



1. On \< The svara issue can be solved by treating each svara marking over or under the akshara as a separate symbol or separate state of the same symbol which would end up increasing the character set of Vedic Sanskrit by a factor of 3. \>.



Band-aid patch is not the total curative medicine ! I am asking the willingness to go for real medicine; and not the nice bandage .



2. On \< The issue of 200% accuracy I fear will never be unconditionally achieved and will always be dependant on the quality of the document.
As in all things GIGO (Garbage in Garbage out) applies. Even with machine learning algorithms this will not work without human scrutiny and interference. \> : 





You are conceding defeat even before stepping on war field and call for starting the war ! Typical first chapter syndrome of Gita and tenth chapter where seeing the cosmic reality Viswaroopa triggers fear before devotion !



This is because of two reasons: The existing education for becoming a IT Computer professional has transformed ' Human to work like a Machine'. 

The model I am proposing is ' become human' and 'Designing a machine that will be Human like/ supports human needs like a human / Humanizing the Machine'. This is ' Prana-Pratishtaa' principle' in 'shivo bhootvaa shivam yajet'. Make a machine to simulate human model.



Unless one is ready to see the shifts for the new paradigm, which is
endorsed both in tradition and being explored by the major IT corporate, one can remain happily at a traffic light, burning fuel, not moving forward, waiting for someone ahead to yield and move forward. The only comfort is listening to the noise from the neighboring vehicle or selfchosen music from own radio !



This situation is a result of double jeopardy : inaccurate understanding of the tradition for Purushartha- Vijnana and sold out to the ' alien model of machine over human' philosophy for the comfort of a system promoting lessened effort and lowered use of human faculties in the name of systems -organization !
