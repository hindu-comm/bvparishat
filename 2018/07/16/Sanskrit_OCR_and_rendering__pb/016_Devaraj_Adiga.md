Namaste

  

Both Google OCR (open source, but we need to upload each image files to Google-Drive and then right-click to choose the option "Open with - Google Doc" ) and Indsenz's SanskritOCR (commercial) won't recognize Vedic accents.

  

As Prof. Ambaji mentioned, we came up with a post-processing tool for Indic OCRs, which can be downloaded from [goo.gl/WqoVi2](http://goo.gl/WqoVi2).

  

For or all four Vedas, data in editable text format is already available.
