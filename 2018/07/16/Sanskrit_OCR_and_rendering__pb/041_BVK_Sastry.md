Namaste



\< Ajit (1) : Why should I upload what I scan to a third party sever ; Ajit (2) : Will google allow please write once google permits. \>



Irrespective of What Google does or does other wise, one is ready to share the documents to public and allow ' less than 100% scans' to be on the ' public global access' and then get on to \< the job of proof correction \> by manual mode'! with less knowledgeable editors!



Why not get in the first phase to get the right software designed ? Or encourage manual digital text entry in native language' scripts ?



The lure of going on Free and easy' has taken deep roots to drain out the desire for developing need appropriate tools. The saying is ' sab chaltaa hai, adjust maadikolli swamy' ( = Everything is fine and Ok; just make some adjustments !)



Does not work for Samskruth ; Does more damage and harm to the core tradition with all good intentions.



There is a beautiful meemaamsaa term for this : killing with mercy ( pashu maarana-yajna) ; good intentions to send the animal to heaven!'
