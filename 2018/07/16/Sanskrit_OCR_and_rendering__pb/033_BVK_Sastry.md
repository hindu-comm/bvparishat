Namaste



On \< None of these however seem to work with swara markings \> :



BECUASE



There is no clarity on SWARA CHINHAS on LIPI-SAMKETHA of Bharateeya-bhashaas as seen in manuscripts and print.



To achieve this a new paradigm shift needs to take place in HMI for Samskruth Language.



As of date, there are not many people who see any value in exploring and investing on these lines. This is a ' self contentment syndrome which drains the research initiative in Samskruth studies.



The model is : if kaupeenam is satisfying enough, why look for goodness and aesthetics of a 16 yards dhoti to wrap the body '?
Sorry if the simile hurts.
