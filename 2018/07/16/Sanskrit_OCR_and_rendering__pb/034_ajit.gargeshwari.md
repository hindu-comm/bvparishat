[https://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Focr.sanskritdictionary.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG_hHChF_QLYtzeU83QpwVdWoL_7w) is not suitable if you have large number of books which has to be OCRed. May work with around 90 or 95% accuracy for a few pages. If one wants to ocr 10 books and each has 200 pages The amount of manual work required would be very high. NO ocr tool is close to Abby fine reader which works nearly perfectly for Greek or Latin scripts.

I have been reading about all these developments but no good product has developed as a package which can be sold or kept free.
