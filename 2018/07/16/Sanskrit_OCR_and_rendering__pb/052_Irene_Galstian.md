Dear Pravesh Vyas,

  

How did you set up Camscanner to recognise Sanskrit?

I just downloaded it on my phone to try out. One thing I have to say is that this app has way too many button clicks to be suitable for large volume scanning. But even so, I'm curious to find out the setup for Devanagari OCR, even just for Sanskrit, since the languages displayed in the OCR section of the app don't include Sanskrit as an option.

  

Thank you,

Irene
