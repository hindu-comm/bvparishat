No serious statistics. In practice, I have tried out several (mostly good scans) pages, and barely get 1-2 mistakes per page --- some of them being difficult for the human eye too, like a faint anuswara etc.

  

Downside: cannot be automated -- have to paste every page manually. It bills itself as a "sanskrit snippet OCR", not as a book OCR though... it seems to be built on Google (default) and can use Tesseract too.  

  

Regards,

Karthik
