<http://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/> uses Google Vision and Tesseract.

I'm using the Vision API.  

We have a few scripts available which can automate the process. You need to register for Google API for Vision though.

For splitting pdf there are few python scripts.

  

Currently, I'm using two scripts to do OCR for big books.
