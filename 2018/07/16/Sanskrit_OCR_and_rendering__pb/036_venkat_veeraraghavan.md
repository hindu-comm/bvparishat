Dear Shri Sastry Garu,  

  

The svara issue can be solved by treating each svara marking over or under the akshara as a separate symbol or separate state of the same symbol which would end up increasing the character set of Vedic Sanskrit by a factor of 3.

  

The issue of 200% accuracy I fear will never be unconditionally achieved and will always be dependant on the quality of the document.

As in all things GIGO (Garbage in Garbage out) applies.

Even with machine learning algorithms this will not work without human scrutiny and interference.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
