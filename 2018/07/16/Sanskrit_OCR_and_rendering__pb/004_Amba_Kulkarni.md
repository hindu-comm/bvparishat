Hello Venkat,  
  

Recently at the World Sanskrit Conference at Vancouver, there was a paper by Devraj Adiga and others on OCR. The team at IIT Bombay have developed a wrapper on the existing OCRs, to improve their performance.  
  

The results look promising. The machine suggests the corrections for unrecognised words / letters.  
  

You may contact Devraj Adiga for further details, whom I've included in cc.  
  

With kind regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
