Regarding Sanskrit editors with Vedic accents, you can use the Omkarananda ashram itrans2003. You can find details in <https://www.oah.in/Sanskrit/Itranslt.html>

  

You can also try the Baraha software, which has a free and paid versions. Google baraha.

  

Unfortunately easy and good don’t go together as with everything else in life. All these have issues, especially regarding the samyutaakShara-s. If you want to come up with professional and high grade documents with Vedic accents, you do need to use Wikners skt package with LaTeX. You can get multiple font sizes, bold, italic, etc. This has been my experience. It all depends on how particular you are. You do need to be very comfortable with LaTeX and get out of the WYSIWYG mode though.

  

You can also use some other fonts such as chandas with LaTeX. The advantage is you don’t need to use a preprocessor as with Wikners font. You can use the polyglossia package with xelatex. Just google polyglossia LaTeX. However, I had some issues due to the need for making some modifications that I needed for generating “authentic” yajurveda documents, which I was able to do by hacking Wikners C code for the preprocessor. Again it all depends on how particular you are. I am extremely particular. If easy is the main criterion, go the Baraha route.
