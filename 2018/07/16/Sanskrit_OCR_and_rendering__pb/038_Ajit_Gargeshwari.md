To put things in a straight forward manner. I scan a 200 page Sanskrit book say in 300 or 600 DPI. I run an ocr I should be able to copy and paste most of what I have scanned on to a note pad or a word document. The more accurate is the recognition lesser will be the job of proof correction. Can I do that using any existing software? The answer is no . (OCR should be faster and more accurate than manual typing)

Software's using google interface are available but one will have to first convert the pdf to images upload the images one at a time download the image covert the image back to pdf. For a 200 page book I will have to do this process 200 times. Google software works up to 10 or 20 pages. Not all books are that small. If I have thousands of books to OCR can I complete within my life time?

I have a 200 page book scanned in English without diacritics I am able to copy most of what's scanned on to a word document or a note pad.

In short we don't have a good software to ocr Sanskrit books.

Now let me common back to[https://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Focr.sanskritdictionary.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG_hHChF_QLYtzeU83QpwVdWoL_7w). Why should I upload what I scan to a third party sever. I have already written about the limitations when one wants to OCR large books.

Everything what else what Prof Sastry have written I don't understand
