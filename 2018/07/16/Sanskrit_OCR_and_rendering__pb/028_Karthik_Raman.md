Namaste Bhat ji,

  

Pardon my ignorance! I just saw Google OCR on this thread, but hadn't used it. You saved some 50 hours of my time by suggesting this. I OCR'ed a 150-page document in about half an hour!

  

नमो नमः!

  

My current hack: put together a long image by appending PNGs (upto 2 MB) and load to Google Drive. Accuracy is OK --- anyway careful proofreading is always important.

  

If anyone has ideas to auto proofread and flag errorsin the text, kindlylet me know!

  

My pet project, which I've never gotten around to, is on Chandas-based proofreading -- I've found it very useful to flag errors in many encoded texts, doing it semi-manually.

  

Regards,

Karthik
