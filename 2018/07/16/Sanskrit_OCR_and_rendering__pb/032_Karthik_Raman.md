Namaste Irene,

  

Yes, the mega file creation is automated. Have put up the scripthere<https://gist.github.com/karthikraman/27e8c8f9fa5206d38fd1ecf702f3cc0a>

  

The script is quick and dirty but works. I have a folder with all the png files 001.png through 284.png and then create these long PNGs. Ended up with seven files like:<https://www.dropbox.com/s/eivwbeehugz9v4i/merged_001_016.png?dl=0> -- which can be fed to<http://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/>-- somehow, larger files didn't work. Had to restrict to \~600 kb.

  

Regards,

Karthik
