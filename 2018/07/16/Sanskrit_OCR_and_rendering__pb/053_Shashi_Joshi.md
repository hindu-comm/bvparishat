Irene ji,

You need to do a cloud OCR for this (100 free cloud OCRs allowed with free version).

For the paid version you can download it locally.

Please find the [attached PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18StdKJEZ4QE2Q9jw0Bd3XMwxCdvk-H1X/view) with screenshots of the process.

  

There is one screenshot missing, where it asks for a second time to do OCR.

  

The app is indeed very powerful, with lot of options, but if you want to bulk conversions, you will need to figure out a way to fix the camera above the book to be canned.

  

Once that is figured out,

\- the app allows a air bubble type of level meter, so you know it is perfectly horizontal.

\- it allows a bulk mode of scanning, where you can keep scanning and all those scans will become one page.

\- it does a decent job of straightening the scan part, identifying the 'useful' rectangle that has text. (May need initial 'training' after a few correction)

\- It allows post scanning corrections also.

  

It is worth the time to figure this app out, if you have the plans to go for the paid version.

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
