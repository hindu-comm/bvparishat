Namaste



I agree with the observation of Ajit Gargeswari.



***If I am to ask the question differently***: What quality standard of OCR is needed for Samskruth document ? if current OCR solutions are not satisfactory for what we want, what would be the call for Samskruth OCR ? for manuscripts which did not use computer-fonts ?!

I would set the quality standard expectancy at 200% accuracy ! This also answers why 90 to 95% accuracy is unacceptable.



**Why ? The ( narrated) story (from Ramayana) on ocean jumping may help to understand this demand for **OCR quality for Samskruth: A language sensitive for a 'change ( add / drop/ modification) of even a single swara (?!)-Varna ( ?!) - Maatraa ( ?!).





***Story (of Ramayana for Samskruth- OCR design)***: 



The vanara-sena ( with angada the chief, the wise old veteran Jambavan, the young enthusiasts nala- neela et al, and quiet hanuman ...) was on the sea shore.



Vanara-sena had the directive from King Sugriva to see and bring information and where with all report on Sita; and failure was marked with capital punishment ! It was death either way - jump in to ocean or return with failure in mission.



Vanara-sena had the information: Sita is captive in the city 'Lanka' on the other end of the sea, hundred yojanas away. But the tools to achieve the goal was the missing element.



The Vanara-sena TEAM started asking the question: Who amongst us is capable of jumping across the ocean and bring message about sita ?



Each team member carried out a self-assessment and declaration: I can jump one way - ten, fifty, seventy...ninety, ninety five ..miles.



The Chief, Prince Angada said: he can jump hundred miles and land on other side, but was not sure of jumping back to bring the information about the correctness of Sita at Lanka ! This could not be an acceptable option, for it involved not only not getting the information validated; but also risking their future king.



So the message was clear ! One way 100% jump ability is NOT enough for the work. The messenger needs to go , validate and return safe. That is the bar set for action is 200% plus. This situation lead the team even to kill themselves using various means like jumping to sea, starve to death et al.



At this time Jambavan is said to have stepped in and prompted the quiet Hanuman to undertake the work, using his dormant powers. Rest is the story in Kishkinda kaanda leading to Yuddha-Kanda !.



**How is this relevant to Samskruth- OCR** ? When Venkat Veera Raghavan noted: \< None of these however seem to work with swara markings\>, the challenge ahead is clear.

The current designs of OCR have not understood the ' Lipi-Shaastra' model of Devanagari Brahmi models. Contra , many of them are based on alien model of Roman script design.

The need for home team is to work abinitio with clarity on 'OCR for Samskruth, based on Brahmi language Native Design'- a feature which is
not present in the current standards of Unicode Devanagari glyph model script shape construction. The indology model of ' script evolution and scripting conventions in multiple scripts of india ' is an approximation of about 45 to 60% ! in reading the manu-scripts. 



Further deliberations on these points are clearly issues with commercial implications and technology oriented; not appropriate for free for all publicity- public forum debate.

I had raised this issue almost a decade ago on the need for advancing on the IPA diacritic model approach for Brahmi language scripts. This would call for ab initio rethinking on the use of ' Romanization approach and foundation for advancing the thought of 'Samskruth Programming language / Panini machine development'.



The goal is achievable, in real time line, given the ingenuity and capability of the current Samskruth -Computer related human resources.



The TEAM work can help to jump-start this ' Ocean jumping' ! Only if
Samskruth Teams get to ' Saha-Charyaa' - Co-working , Collaborated working- Common-motivation and Concurrent Objective' to revisit '
Language -Computing models' , 'Computational Linguistics Base and Basics', MT and AI goals.

The shift needed is to work with a new perspective of ' Language -Technology -Relation' using ' Panini in Vedanga Mode'. There is no need to discard what all has been done. But there is all the necessity to see what is needed for the Samskruth Language needs through Technology. This need not be the same as goal expectation as set or achieved / designed for english ! Each langauge has its own body and soul of its own unique nature.



Now, it all depends on the ' Karma-Samkalpa / shraddhaa': The interest and initiative to develop in house technology tools appropriate for Samskruth ?? And what about ' Purushartha- benefit'? And Who invests-supports ? For Punya and Purushartha ?



One is always free to make conscious choices of sacrificing the ' Punya and Purusha' for ' Artha'-gains !



Pl. Write to me off line if this interests with what your plans are.

[https://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Focr.sanskritdictionary.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG_hHChF_QLYtzeU83QpwVdWoL_7w) is not suitable if you have large number of books which has to be OCRed. May work with around 90 or 95% accuracy for a few pages. If one wants to ocr 10 books and each has 200 pages The amount of manual work required would be very high. NO ocr tool is close to Abby fine reader which works nearly perfectly for Greek or Latin scripts.
