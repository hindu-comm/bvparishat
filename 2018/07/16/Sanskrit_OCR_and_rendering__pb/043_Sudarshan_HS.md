This is an excellent idea to make mega PNGs, and great to know that they work. Will give this script a try. I have seen that the [sa.wikisource.org](http://sa.wikisource.org) team are manually concatenating page-wise outputs till now and this may be useful for them too.

  

BTW, we have tried the[http://ocr.sanskritdictionary.com/](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Focr.sanskritdictionary.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHNzwd0BDU5fbtI8Mr8DQBUUNoVFg)on handwritten text of devanagari & telugu lipis (including old manuscripts) and it now works much better than earlier. Though the quality is no where near to the handling of printed text, it appears that there is active work going on the backend; the handling of background noise, slanted lines, lipi variants, all have improved in the last 2 years.
