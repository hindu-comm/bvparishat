I'm registered already. As for scripts, I looked around briefly to see if any are available to use and modify but didn't find any. Hence writing my own. However, if you know of any publicly available ones, please post further information. It's good to have extra options. I mean the OCR itself here, not PDF splitting and other simple tasks.
