Ajitji,

  

I agree with you. As pointed out in the review shared by you, lack of demand from Sanskrit community is one of the resons the development of Sanskrit OCR nowhere near that of English.

Namaste Shankaraji,

  

90% accuracy is not good enough. [achive.org](http://achive.org) has four thousand books printed prior to 1923. On an average a book might have 300 or more pages. With the current software's it may not be possible to to do any serious OCR even if one spends their entire life time. After OCR the books have to be corrected for errors I am factoring that operation in.
