Dear friends,

Good morning.

I am sharing a personal view for your consideration. Sorry it is a bit long.

  

As I see BVP has been the first modern experiment in creating a bi-lingual medium

of information sharing on behalf of India and her literature. One part is the exchange

of technical ideas among the "practitioners" and the second is the outreach to others

who can be labelled as "learners" A "practitioner" may not be a researcher since he

or she might simply want to consolidate his or her practice rather than thinking about

teaching others. It is the latter task that I have felt as a value of the experiment.

  

Teaching is a process where the teacher and the student have a gradient of knowledge.

The teacher has an understanding what the student would need to know and creates a

method to deliver knowledge. This delivery compromises to the capacity of the student

in his/her language and prior understanding. The teacher tries his best to appreciate

the capacity and model the course of instruction.

  

The difficulty comes when the student may not know or has little time or interest in

leaning the language of the teacher. The teacher has a choice of rejecting the student

or try to render instructions in the language that the student can understand. In this

latter path, BVP has an important role in my opinion.

  

Through whatever reason, political or otherwise, the modern active students only understand

English more than any other language. This adds a whole new responsibility on the part

of the teacher to create a vocabulary and a syntax that can "represent" his or her cultivation

on the subject. Analytic rendering to create a mode of instruction is the new task. Hence

a teacher by definition has to be bilingual.

  

Bilingualism is not developing a skill in translation, it is the delivery of a thought in the new language. The words could be different, the meanings could be different. It is not a

convenient adoption but it is a conscious effort in information reconstruction. The latter

part needs a distillation process in the teacher's mind to be able to create conviction on

the concept before attempting to render it in the new channel.

  

It is a task on behalf of education in modern India. I take the opportunity to congratulate

the organizers of BVP to have assumed such task. It is the participants' role in creating

the distillation such that new rendering is not a distorted packaging, but a new creation

for the new world of students. It is a task to hold on to the essence and to redeliver in a

different language. Let me invite all to think.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
