Acharyaji,

  

Thanks for the information on Krishna Pandita and Kaivalya Dipika.  

  

I have come across English translation of Kaivalya Navaneeta by German scholar Carolo Graul published in 1855. The name of the author, the series and the year publication match with the informaton in your mail. This edition contains the Tamil text of Kaivalya Navaneetam, English translation and a beginners guide to Tamil grammar. It is available in Google Books. Attaching a PDF of the same with this mail.  

  

You may please verify whether a German translation was done by the same author.  

  

regards  
shankara
