It is a common sight with respect to sannyasins of Vishishtadvaita sampradaya that they are with pavitra always. One can see the swami with the pavitram in the right hand ring finger:

I have not seen sannyasins of other sampradaya to be doing this. This could be because in the Ramanuja sampradaya, shikha and yajnopavitam are not discarded during sannyasa.
