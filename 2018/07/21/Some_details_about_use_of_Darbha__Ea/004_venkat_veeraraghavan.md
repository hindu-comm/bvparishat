Dear Shri Korada ji-

  

Thank you for your reply. I was not sure of the source and in such a well read group of people who live the scriptures, I was hoping to either get a source or get it taken down. Thanks again.

  

That still does not clear the below doubts of mine. Using a pavitrafor nityakarmasis given in Brahmakarma Samucchaya. So it is well supported by both scripture and tradition.

  

\>\>I recently came across that even sandhyavandana has to be done with a darbha pavitram on the ring finger. There is also a difference of opinion between Tamil and Andhradesa on whether the pavitra can be worn while performing achamana. Tamils generally wear the pavitram only after achamana and remove the pavitra before performing achamana again. In Andhra I think this is not an issue and achamana can be performed with pavitra.  

  

I remember reading somewhere that the darbha pavitra can be used throughout a day's nityakarma. I think the Kurchena in the above refers to darbhasanas too.*How is the principle of discarding a darbhasana to be followed in this case ?*

  

*My final question is about devapavitra---Is this an equal replacement for a darbha pavitra?*
