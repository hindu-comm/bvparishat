*Dear Learned members:*

*  
*

*  
*

*I have seen the following (not sure of the root sources though);*

  

*Kusahastena yajjaptam danam chaiva kusaissaha \|*

*Kusa hastastu yo bhinkte tasya sankhya na vidyate\|\|*

  

He who meditates with Pavitra on his fingers, gives charity and eats sitting on Kusa mat will be blessed with meritorious acts.

  

\>\>I recently came across that even sandhyavandana has to be done with a darbha pavitram on the ring finger. There is also a difference of opinion between Tamil and Andhradesa on whether the pavitra can be worn while performing achamana. Tamils generally wear the pavitram only after achamana and remove the pavitra before performing achamana again. In Andhra I think this is not an issue and achamana can be performed with pavitra.

  

*Can you please throw light on this?*



*Angushthetu piturnaasah tarjanyaam maranam bhavet \|*

*Madhyame putranasascha kanuishthe sarvadoshakrit \|\|*

  

One gets his father killed by wearing pavitra on the thumb, gets his own destruction with the middle finger, gets his children killed with index finger and all these by the little finger (implying wear it always on ring finger).

  

*Kurchena va pavitrena yena karmaani kaarayet \|*

*tasya granti visrijjaiva karmaante tat parityajet \|\|*

  

One should discard Dharbaassemblythat was usedas pavitra or as seating after untying the knot when the Karma is done. Otherwise he commits a sin.

  

I remember reading somewhere that the darbha pavitra can be used throughout a day's nityakarma. I think the Kurchena in the above refers to darbhasanas too. *How is the principle of discarding a darbhasana to be followed in this case ?*

  

*My final question is about devapavitra---Is this an equal replacement for a darbha pavitra?*

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
