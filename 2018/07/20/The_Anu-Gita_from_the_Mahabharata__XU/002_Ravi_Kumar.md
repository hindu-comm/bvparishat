Thank you sir, I also downloaded it through a search on [archive.org](http://archive.org) separately. I actually meant 'translation of any commentary' not 'translation of the text' in the original post. Brain fog.

  

When it comes to translations of text, we have all those who have translated the Mbh proper. Such as Bibek Debroy, recently. I have that.

  

thank you
