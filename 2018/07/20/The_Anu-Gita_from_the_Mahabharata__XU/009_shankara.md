Venkatji,

  

Sorry for the confusion regarding your name.

  

I have heard of 3 Sanskrit commentaries on Sanatsujatiya by Acharyas Sankara, Vadiraja and Nilakantha.

  

Chaukhambha has published Sanatsujatiya with the commentaries of Sankaracharya & Nilakantha with Hindi translation. I have not seen it. Nor do I know if it is still in print.  

  

Sri Ramakrishna Math has publsihed Sanatsujatiya with Sankarabhashya and English translation by Swami Amritananda. This also seems to be out of print.

  

Gita Press has publsihed Sanatsujatiya with Sankarabhashya and Hindi translation. This must still be available in their shops or may be purchased online.  

  

Then there are English translations by KT Telang, KM Ganguli, Bibek Debroy, et. al. The last two are part of the Mahabharata translation,not independent publications.  

  

regards  
shankara
