Thanks for pointing out the broken link.

I have fixed it now. I have also added a link the Bharatasavitri in Chitrashala edition.

(you may have to do a refresh to get the updated MBh Resources Page)

  

This is a generic problem I am facing whenever I link to an external source. Sometime back ASI site went through some changes and all the links I had given to Mbh with Nilakantha commentary and Mbh Kumbhakonam Edition got broken.

Only yesterday I fixed the problem by changing the links to the files at Internet Archive.

  

Best
