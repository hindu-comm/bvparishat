Dear Shankaraji,

  

Thank you very much for the 2 articles. The request came to you from Venkatraman and not from Subbuji. I am in fact delighted to be mistaken for Subbuji of whom I am not even a pale shadow.

  

While on the subject I am looking for a good book on Sanat Sujatiyam. 
Web version is ok but a hard copy is preferable. Any help you or anyone else from this forum can give will be greatly appreciated. Regards,

  

Venkat

  

Thanks once again,

  

Venkat.
