**From Mukula Bhaṭṭa to Maṃmaṭa (readings in Sanskrit poetics)**



Organisation:

Hugo David (EFEO)

Alessandro Graheli (IKGA, Vienna)

Daniele Cuneo (University of Paris 3)



Dates: 23^(rd) July – 10^(th) August 2018 (11am-1pm / 2-4pm)

Venue: EFEO, 19 Dumas Street (Library Hall)



Description:

The purpose of this workshop is to produce a new critical edition of an important Sanskrit text on Alaṃkāraśāstra, Mukula Bhaṭṭa’s *Abhidhāv**ṛttamātṛkā*, written in Kashmir in the 9^(th) century, and of its critique by Maṃmaṭa, the celebrated author of the *Kāvyaprakāśa*, in a lesser-known treatise called *Śabdavyāpāravicāra*. Mukula is best known as an ancient adversary of Ānandavardhana’s theory of “poetic suggestion” (*dhvani*), and his treatise may be the first systematic investigation of “linguistic functions” (*v**ṛtti*) in the history of Indian poetics. Maṃmaṭa, in turn, systematically criticises Mukula’s views from the point of view of the *dhvani-*school*.* Both texts shall be read and analysed integrally during the workshop. Their new edition will be based on hitherto unexploited manuscripts from North India, in particular a precious 14^(th)-century palm-leaf manuscript from Rajasthan.
