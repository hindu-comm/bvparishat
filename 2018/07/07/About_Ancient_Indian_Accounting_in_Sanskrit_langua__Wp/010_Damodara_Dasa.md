Hare Krishna.  
  
It is a very good resourceful website. There are 1355 papers by  
Kalyana Ramanji. I feel they will be quite useful for our project  
development.  
  
Is there a way to download all of them together?  
  
Also how to contact him if I want to meet him? Does anyone has his  
contact details?  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
