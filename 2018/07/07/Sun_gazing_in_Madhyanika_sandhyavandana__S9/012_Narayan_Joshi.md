Dear Prof Korada, Thanks for your posting contribution to the discussion of Sun gazing. In my opinion, the following factors need to be given attention. (1) Skin color chemical in skins of white, brown and black people.(2) Filtering effect of atmosphere of the earth,(3) Ultraviolet rays and their effect on eyes. With regards, NRJOSHI
