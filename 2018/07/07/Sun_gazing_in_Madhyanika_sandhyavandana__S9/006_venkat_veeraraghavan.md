Dear Shri CSR Prabhu ji:

  

I would diasagree with you on the basis of personal experience of more than 2 decades. I have excellent eye-sight. The noon Sun can be gazed at but through the mudra for the 10 seconds or so it takes to chant the mantras.

More than that I am not sure.

  

Sri Nagaraj ji please see attached for the full mantra in madhyanika sandhyavandana.  
  

Regards,

  
Venkat
