Dear Shri Korada ji:

  

Revisiting this old thread, I have some questions that hopefully you can resolve for me.

  

Many of our puranas talk about our heroes and heroines performing panchAgni tapasya. Staying in the midst of 4 fires with the Sun on top.

Is this a special case or exception to the rules in Pu. Mi and in Dharma shastras?

  

On this subject what are the lakshaNAs for tapasya given in shastra?

  

I understand that the last question may not exactly segue on the stated topic and may require a fresh thread to do justice perhaps?

  

Venkat
