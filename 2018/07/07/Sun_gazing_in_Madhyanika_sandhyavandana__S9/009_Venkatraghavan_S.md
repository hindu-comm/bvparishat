Namaste,

I was taught that the mudra is called varuNa pAsha (ref: the sandhyAvandana book by 'Anna' Subramanium published by RK Mutt Chennai), so perhaps that (ie the association with varUNa, the lord of the waters) has a cooling effect and prevent damage to the eyes? In general, a worship of the sun is prescribed for healthy eyes at many places in the shAstra.

  

There seems to be some variation on when and how long the sun is seen during mAdhyAhnika. In the procedure taught to me, the sun should seen through the varuNapAsha mudra when jyok ca sUryam dRshe is uttered. Others say that the sun should be seen when pashyema sharadasshatam is uttered. Some others say that it should be seen through the entire portion - pashyema sharadasshatam...until jyok ca sUryam dRshe.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
