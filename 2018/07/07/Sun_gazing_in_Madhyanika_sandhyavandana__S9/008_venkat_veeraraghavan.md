Theoretically yes. Noon time Sun is at His brightest.

  

However, Rising and setting Suns should not be seen as per Manu Smriti (The shloka in the original post)--> The reasons for this are not very clear to me though.

  

Temporally one will be in Japa from when stars are visible to sunrise during prAtasandhya and from sun visible and approaching asta to when stars are visible for sAyam sandhya. Apart from this problem of opportunity, I am not sure if any other reasons exist for not gazing at the rising and setting Suns. If someone knows, kindlly do enlighten me.
