Dear List Members:

  

I have a doubt regarding the source for Sun gazing through the hastha mudra for madhyanika sandhyavandana.

  

Shri Venkat Sriram ji was kind enough to point me to the below verse:  

  

नेक्षेतोद्यन्तं आदित्यं नास्तं यान्तं कदा चन ।

नोपसृष्टं न वारिस्थं न मध्यं नभसो गतम् ।। मनुस्मृति (4/37)

  

But it only says not to look at the rising or setting sun. It does not explicitly ask one to look at the Sun at the apex point. I'd like to know if there is a source for the sun gazing bit.

  

Also given the above verse from Manu Smriti, what is the expert opinion of the learned ones regarding the culture of Sun Eating / Sun gazing i.e looking at the rising Sun in incremental units of time ie starting with 10 secs today, 20 secs tomorrow and so on. as propounded by modern savants like Sunyogi Umashankar and others?

  

There are some genuine Yogis like Prahlad Jani who photosynthesize, but the others I am not so sure of.

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
