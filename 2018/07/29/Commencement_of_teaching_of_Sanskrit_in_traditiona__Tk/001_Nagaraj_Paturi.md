There was this old thread on BVP concerning traditional Sanskrit teaching:

Respected scholars,

  

I would like to pursue one of my longstanding interests and to gather materials on the early modern/ modern “basic” education in Sanskrit (I am, as a matter of fact, interested in various aspects of the living tradition of Sanskrit scholarship, but for now I choose to concentrate on this topic).

For this, I would like to conduct (video) interviews with scholars who have either enjoyed traditional Sanskrit education themselves or, just possibly, who may be still engaged in teaching in a gurukulam-style (I would be also interested to visit pāṭhaśālā, who teach other subjects besides Vedic recitation).

In this regard, I would like humbly to request any help from the members of this list. I would be most thankful if any of the list-members would agree to participate at such interview for himself/ herself or, could point me to other people/ institution, whom I could visit/ contact in this regard.

I would be able to come to India during the coming August and September. The interviews should be conducted in Sanskrit (or, of course, in English).

  

In addition, I would appreciate any pointers to literature that treats basic Sanskrit education (I would be also interested in finding out the rationale behind the B.A. syllabus at Sanskrit departments and universities).

  

  

With many Thanks,  
Andrey
