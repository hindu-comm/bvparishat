Namaste,  
I am delighted to inform to all Sanskrit scholars and learners that from 1st August the teaching of Sanskrit in traditional way will commence in Pune in Abasaheb Patwardhan Vedashastra Vidyalaya.  
The two leaflets (in Marathi) are attached stating the purpose, rules, etc.  
Sanskrit will regain its glory only by traditional method of teaching.  
Nowadays, in various institutes and colleges Sanskrit people are attaining the glory and not the Sanskrit.  
  
Rectifications- On the second page of leaflet, the words सुरु and ...रित्या should be read as सुरू and ...रीत्या.
