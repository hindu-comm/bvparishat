Namaskara to all,

  

I have compiled descriptions of what is considered desirable/undesirable in a king. I have complied the descriptions from nine different texts where Rajadharma has been discussed. These texts are, Manu Smruti, Yajnavalkya Smruti, Vidura Neeti, Shukra Neeti, Kautiliya Arthshastra, Kamandakiya Neetisara, Sabhaparva, and Shantiparva and Ayodhyakanda.

I am curious if this exercise can be of use in understanding leadership in the modern context, since many Western theories have already discussed the traits of effective / ineffective leaders.

  

Under each description given in the form, I have presented the English synonym which is a working translation selected after considering the textual description, dictionary meaning, and its close alternative appearing in leadership literature. Thus, sometimes I may have been liberal in translation, and validation by language experts is necessary.

I request you to kindly take some time off to give your comments. If the working translation given under each description is not appropriate, please write an appropriate synonym in the space marked 'Other'.

  

I thank you in advance for your time and effort, and once the comments are compiled, I will share the findings.

With pranams,

margie
