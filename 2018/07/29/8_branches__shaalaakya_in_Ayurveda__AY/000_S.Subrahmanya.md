It appears that a Ayurvedic technique called 'shaalakya' went from India to China i.e. treating headaches with needles.

Also - there are supposed to be 8 branches of indian medicine that were taken to china :

shalya, shaalaakya, kaayachikitsa, bhuutavidyaa, kaumaarabhrutya, agada (??) , rasaayana

  

I will greatly appreciate any references that gives more details about this topic.
