Namaste

  

In the commentary of Shankarananda (12 -13 CE) for the Paramahamsopanishat, we see a citation of the Yogavasishtha:

In the works of Vidyaranya (admitted to be a disciple of the above author) we find the YogavasishTha cited profusely. To my knowledge Shankarananda is the earliest one to cite from this text. Has anyone seen this text cited by an author earlier to this one?

  

The reason for my search is that there are people who think that this work is a much later one and early Advaitins have not cited it.
Vidyaranya refers to the author of this text as 'Valmiki'. It is also known as VasishTha Ramayanam, Jnana VasishTham, etc.

  

Thanks and regards
