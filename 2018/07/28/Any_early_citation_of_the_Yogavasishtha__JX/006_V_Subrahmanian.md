Namaste

  

The two YV verses Mainkar refers to are:

  

<http://stotram.lalitaalaalitah.com/2014/01/yogavasishtham-vairagyaprakaranam-sarga.html>  

  

I.1.55,56:

  

शापव्याजवशादेव रजवेषधरो हरिः

*आहृताज्ञानसंपन्नः किञ्चित्ज्ञोसावभूत्प्रभुः* ॥५५॥

चिदानन्दस्वरूपे हि रामे चैतन्यविग्रहे

शापस्य कारणं ब्रूहि कः शप्ता चेति मे वद ॥५६॥

  

Maharshi tells the king that Hari (Mahavishnu), on thepretext of making true the curses (of his devotees), incarnated in human formas Rama, and though omniscient, took on the role of one with diminishedknowledge.
The King asks the Maharshi  
the reason for the curse on Rama who is of the nature of Absolute PureKnowledge (Consciousness).  

The various instances of 'shaapa' addressed to Vishnu can be seen in the above link, following the verses 56.

  

There is a Sanskrit commentary too to YV printed in the Motilal Banarsida edition. Taking the terms आहृताज्ञानसंपन्नः किञ्चित्ज्ञोसावभूत्प्रभुः of the verse and looking at the SS of Sarvajnatman,

![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/7caebbcd50ee2/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

there is a possibility of SS referring to YV. The word 'abhUt' is common to both the verses. The meaning of आहृताज्ञानसंपन्नःcan be seen to be annotated by SS as 'संकल्पपूर्वकम्...'

  

An inquiry into the Valmiki Ramayana to anything that could mean/amount to ' 'संकल्पपूर्वकम्..' on the part of Rama, due to any reason such as a 'shaapa', might yield more light in the matter.
