Dear friends,

Earlier in the month I had posted the video link of Ratha Yatra, the

annual public festival at Puri. Its origin and the use of chariots in

processional use has baffled me. I read last night in Majumdar's

history of Mahayana about the Huen Tsiag's reference to chariots

in festival use. Because I come from Puri, I had volunteered to

create a translation of the Jagnnatha legend for a book for the

Oxford University Press. Ed Bryant in Rutgers edited the book

Krishna - a Sourcebook. Here is a link of the book for your reference.

Mine is the fifth essay.

I would appreciate if anyone has thought about the deities and their rituals.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
