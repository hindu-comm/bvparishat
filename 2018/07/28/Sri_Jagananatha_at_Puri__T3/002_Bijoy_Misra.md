Madhavji,

The material is due to Sarala Dasa, the 15th century Odia poet.

With a goal of creating Mahabharata for the masses, he creates

a local version. The part of this process is to transform Sri Krishna

to Jagannatha at Puri after his life at Dwarika. This makes the

Temple a Vaishnava pilgrimage. Its early conception remains to

be fully studied. The Temple would not exist by the time of Shankara

but possibly discourses on tantra and conduct were popular.

There is not much archaeological work to dig the story of Puri

in the early Christian era. I posted to seek help as a native.

Best regards,

Bijoy
