Namaste

  

There is an entry in this page
<http://webcatplus.nii.ac.jp/webcatplus/details/book/9329129.html>

  

for the above work which contains many 'deepikaa-s' on various Upanishads by Sri Shankarananda (Vidyaranya's guru) of the 12-13 CE. The entry in the above page says it was published by Anandashram. Is it possible to download the book?

  

Also, the 'Advaita Vedanta Literature...' by Sri Thangaswamy, under the above author also mentions a book: shivagita vyakhya. This does not appear to be in the upanishad collection stated above, as this is not any upanishad. If this is also published by someone, can it be downloaded?

  

Kindly help me in this search.

  

Thanks and regards
