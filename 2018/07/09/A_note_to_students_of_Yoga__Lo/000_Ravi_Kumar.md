Hari Om

  

This is just a note I am dropping for the benefit of students of Yoga in this forum. I have just been reading a paper titled "Basic Principles of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras - an Integral Approach" by Swami Bhajanananda of the Ramakrishna Math, Belur Math. I find the paper to be an excellent descriptive summary of the ****principles behind**** Patanjali's theory of Yoga. The paper has illustrative diagrams of yogic concepts and useful notes on the correspondence between Yogic and Vedantic terms on equivalent topics.

  

The paper is available in a volume containing other useful papers on Yoga entitled "Some Responses to Classical Yoga in the Modern Period" published by the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata.
