duplication of work.

  

2.It is heard from the source that Padmanabha teertha's \[ disciple of work Madwacharya\] work called Madwa Vilasa's \[ valuable work on Madwachary's life\]

manuscript could be found in Germany's libraries. It's also heard that many Dvaita vedanta related manuscripts available in those libraries. We want to
