There are a few books written by a US professor Stephen Knapp on precisely the same subject raised by Sri Prabhu. We can see his talk on the you tube too. When I read a couple of his books I thought that a lot of further research is needed on all the points raised by him in his books. Some titles are '' Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence", Crimes Against India: and the Need to Protect its Ancient Tradition", "The Power of the Dharma" etc. They are seen on the net too.
