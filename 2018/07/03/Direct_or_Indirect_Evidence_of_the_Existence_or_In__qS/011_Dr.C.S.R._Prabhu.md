That is correct.That period was relatively recent .Correct?What I am saying is that even the European pre Christian Pagan,Celtic,Druidic and Middke Eastern Assyrian,Akkadian ,Sumerian snf the Persian Zorastrian religions are closely affiliated, if not just variations of the same Sanatana Dharma before their conversion to Christianity and Islam as the case may be ,very much similar to what happened much later in these far eastern countries as stated by you please.I have seen many evidences to that effect.
