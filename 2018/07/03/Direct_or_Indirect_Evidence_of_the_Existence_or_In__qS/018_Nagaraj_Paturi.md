Dear Sri Ravi Kumar-ji,

  

\> This is a very interesting anecdote Sri Nagaraj ji. Could you or Sri Ananthnarayanan perhaps guide us on the following:

  

\> For those of us who are not familiar with the notion that Vedic Sanskrit is different from the Sanskrit that we know, could you guide us as to the significant differences between them. Is classical Sanskrit a derivative or a modification of Vedic Sanskrit?

  

------ Sanskrit is one single language. The Vedic version of it is called Vaidika Samskritam and the version known generally as Sanskrit (treated as different from the Vedic language) is called Laukika Samskritam. Modern /western researchers treat these two versions as two different languages belonging to two different historical periods. We don't treat classical Tamil and modern Tamil or classical Telugu and modern Telugu or classical Kannada and modern Kannada as two different languages, do we? We can not prove that contemporary spoken versions of Tamil, Telugu or Kannada are 'derived' from their classical versions. In the same way, we can not prove that laukika Samskritam is derived from Vaidika Samskritam.
