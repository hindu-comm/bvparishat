नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Long ago ( in '70s) I have seen a book in V S Krishna Library , Andhra University , Visakhapatnam , Andhra Pradesh ,

that contains Hymns from Rgveda and their counterparts in Zend Avesta with Pictures representing Agnihotram etc.

  

The term ' zen' in Japanese and 'chan' in Chinese mean ध्यानम् ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
