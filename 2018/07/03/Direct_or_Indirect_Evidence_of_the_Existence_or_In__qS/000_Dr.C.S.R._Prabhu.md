Dear Learned Scholras,I invite your considered views and valuable opinions on the posdible existence or influence or relationship of Vedic and Puranic Hinduism or Sanatana Dharma in Pre-Christain Europe and Pre-Mohammefan Middle East .The Egyptian,Greek,Roman worship of Sun and other Plantes as Jupiter and the Moon,the Planet Worship at Mecca,Arabia and also the pantheon of Gods and Goddesses in Sumerian ,Assyrian,Akkadian Empires and Cultures in Iraq and the Fire Worship in Iran are easily traceable to either direct or indirect influence or relationship of Puranic Hinduism and also in parts to Vedic Hinduism.Even the reforms attempted in later Religions towards a formless Divine power becoming manifest in various forms of Devatas is traceable to the Vedic philosophy.Historically also,at the time of Mahabharata war,no other modern Religion existed globally .I seek the learned comments from Scholars.
