Dear friends and colleagues,

  

My EcoDharma Book Tour is currently in progress across India, supported by Indic Academy. After couple of more lectures in Bhubaneswar, I will be in MP, Rajasthan, Assam, Meghalaya, Delhi, and Mumbai, more than two dozen lectures on Dharma and Ecology at various colleges, universities, IITs etc.  

  

Please WhatsApp me at 001.214.724.5611 if you are in any of these locations for potential meeting or more lectures at your institutions/NGOs.

  

Thanks a lot,  
Pankaj Jain
