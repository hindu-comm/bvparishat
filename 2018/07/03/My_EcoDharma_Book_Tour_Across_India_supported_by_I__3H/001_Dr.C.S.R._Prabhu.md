I worked out a framework of Dharma Yoga as the Framework of Common Essential Principles of all Religions.Basicly it encompasses Dharma and Yoga together which can be shown to be the acceptable Common Essential Principles of all Religions.I presented this to scholars of different Religions through various Events organised by Henry Martyn Institute and also other Inter Faith Dialogues organizers like British council I.I received favourable resoinse.I invite the response from disinguished Scholars like you good self please.
