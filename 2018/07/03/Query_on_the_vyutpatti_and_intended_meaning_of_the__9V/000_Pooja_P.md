नमस्सदसे सदसस्पतये,

  

Recently I heard the word दमनित being used in a sabhaa with the connotation of "oppressed". I am curious as to how this word is formed? Is it a Nijanta form? How is it different from the word दमित? I am aware that it is from the dhaatu दमु उपशमे .

  

Which sutras are to be referred in this scenario?

  

सविनया,

पूजा
