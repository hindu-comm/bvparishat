I don't know the speaker's accomplishments that well.  

  

It was during the Masti Prashasti felicitation ceremony on Sunday - <http://www.samyukthakarnataka.com/1719379/Samyukta-Karnataka-Bengaluru-%E0%B2%B8%E0%B2%82%E0%B2%AF%E0%B3%81%E0%B2%95%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%A4-%E0%B2%95%E0%B2%B0%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%A8%E0%B2%BE%E0%B2%9F%E0%B2%95-%E0%B2%AC%E0%B3%86%E0%B2%82%E0%B2%97%E0%B2%B3%E0%B3%82%E0%B2%B0%E0%B3%81/July,-02,-2018,-Bangalore#page/2/2>

  

It was used by Mr. S.R.Vijay Shankar while giving a talk about the winners' works.

  

That aside, I am interested in the formation of this word. I request the scholars to kindly show me which sutras are relevant for the formation of this word.  

  

सविनया,

पूजा
