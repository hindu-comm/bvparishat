Dear Bijoyji,

  

What exactly do you find strange about my statement?

I have asked for a gist in English for my own understanding. My Sanskrit is very basic and in such an important matter I crave a little precision from learned people in the group.

  

Is that strange?

  

I am confused by your statement: "What other interests you have useful to the member here?"

  

Are you questioning my utility to the larger group? Or are you trying to sound out my competencies for your own understanding?

  

I can give you a clear reply once I understand your questions and their purpose better.

  

Warm Regards..N
