Dear Sri Ravikumar ji,

  

I wrote: "Sorry I dont understand Sanskrit. Can you please give the gist?"

  

Did you note the words please? and Sorry?

  

What do you expect me to add to that sentence to show that I am humble?

  

Would a flourish and a curtsy do?

  

Please do not read unwarranted things into other peoples' messages. It is to avoid precisely this that I asked for an explanation from Sri Bijoy ji.

  

Kind Regards,

  

N
