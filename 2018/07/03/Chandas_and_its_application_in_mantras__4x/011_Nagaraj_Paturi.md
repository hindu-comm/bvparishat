Sri Niranjan-ji,

  

It is not surprising that Prof. Bijoy Misra was surprised at your

  

\> Sorry I dont understand Sanskrit. Can you please give the gist?  

  

in a Sanskrit related forum.

  

Later, you said that your Sanskrit is basic.

  

If you said that in the beginning itself, this conversation could have been avoided.

  

Prof. Misra suggested to you to learn Sanskrit /improve your Sanskrit.

  

Please take it in the right spirit and please improve from your basic Sanskrit.
