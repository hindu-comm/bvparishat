Dear List Members,

  

With reference to the Ganapati atharvasirsha, the shloka mentions:

सैषा गणेशविद्या ।

गणक ऋषिः ।

निचृद्गायत्रीच्छन्दः ।

गणपतिर्देवता ।

ॐ गं गणपतये नमः

  

Can some one explain how this is nichrt Gayatri chandas? Thanks.

  

Also in many tantric mantras without sufficient aksharas mention is made of chandas as in virat / gayatri etc.

How does this work? How is this meant to be applied?

  

In Vedic pronunciation, there is a clear pause between padas divided on the basis of chandas thereby altering rhythm.

How does the same apply when there are not enough aksharas to justify the chandas?

  

Venkat
