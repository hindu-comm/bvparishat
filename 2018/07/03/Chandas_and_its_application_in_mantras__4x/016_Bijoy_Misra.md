The problem is not the question, the problem is to reduce a sound-driven comprehension

to homogenize in a different language. Sanskrit lives in its sounds and asking for a meaning

is what we need to avoid. The meaning would appear through listening.

This distortion has been the major part of reducing Sanskrit to a language as done in the west.

It is dhvani that we capture and interpret. It is natural human speech not by pre-made words!

  

But this is not the right discussion in BVP, in my opinion.
