BTW, the gAyatri is ekadantAyavidmahe vakratuNDAya dhImahi \| tanno dantI pracodayAt \| Not gaM or Om gaM. It doesn't look like the bhAShya link discusses the gAyatrI aspect, except to point this mantra out as the gAyatrI. (evaM gaNeshavidyAM pratipAdya gaNeshagAyatIM prakaTayannAha)

  

The meter is obtained by splitting ekadantAyavidmahe\| vakratuNDAya dhImahi \| tanno dantI pracodayAt \|

  

There is an alternative recitation tradition where the first two pada-s are chanted together and that's followed here. That's my understanding.
