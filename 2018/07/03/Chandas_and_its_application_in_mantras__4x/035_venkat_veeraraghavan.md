Dear Sri Krishnan ji:

  

the daivi gayatri is mentioned in pingala's chandashastra a book I saw at Sri Gowtham Sarmaji's home.

  

I am not clear how the 7 vyahritis are matched with 7 chandas and 7 Rshis.

In many commentaries the bhu, bhuvah and svah /suvah are matched with Rg, Yaju and Sama Vedas. It is possible *(I am speculating here)* that there are mantras in the chandas mentioned that correlate with each vyahriti. So the vyahriti is technically not a bija and cannot be subject to application of chandas rules for single syllable bijas. Again each vyahriti correlates to a particular loka/ plane of existence / experience. These would be the higher planes corresponding to the 7 lower planes: atala, vitala..patala.

  

In the SYV Madyandina shakha the schema of Rshis is different compared to KYV. Although Jamadagni is essentially Bhargava gotra there is significant re-arrangement in terms of which vyahriti is matched with which Rshi.

  

I would appreciate it if any of the vidvans in the list can throw more light on the above.

  

Wrt Tantra I have asked in this list before and have not received clarification on why they use vedic chandas like gayatri, anushtup, etc

  

The tantric mantras corresponding to these chandas however do not have the requisit syllables to justify that chandas.

  

One reason for this could be the difference in shiksha methodology: The Vedas follow Paniniya/ Naradiya/Mandukya shiksha while the tantric shiksha is received directly from mouth of Guru. Again this is speculative only.

  

Regards,

  

V
