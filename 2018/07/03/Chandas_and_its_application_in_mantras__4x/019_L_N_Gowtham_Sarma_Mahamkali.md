Sorry to say sorry to say but the discussion went in the wrong direction so Mr Venkata V Raghavan is asking about how the tantric mantras for the tantrik beaches can be stated as some Chanda without having the aksharas that meant to be as per the vedic chadas sastra. So the main question arises here does the vedic chandas apply to Tantra also?
