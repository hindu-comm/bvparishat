Thank you

Dear scholars whoever reply to this topic

Not only the vyharuthees but also the tanric beejas & moola mantras are given with the names of vedic chandas without having the syllabus count.

  

Anybody who had a good knowledge in both tantra and chanda should let us know what's the point.

Thankyou
