My observation has been that it takes about ten to fifteen years to develop comprehension of technical concepts.

Hence we have to narrow down what we can absorb such that we may immerse ourselves in the studies.

Superficial learning would sublimate easily. We should try to hold on to the concepts such that we may build some

internal understanding. Hence we need to develop focus about what we may acquire that we can retain. Learning

becomes useful when it enables us to contribute. Making efforts to contribute would exhibit us our internal inconsistency

leading us to further immersion. We learn not to jump but to walk diligent small steps.

These are my suggestions to new researchers..
