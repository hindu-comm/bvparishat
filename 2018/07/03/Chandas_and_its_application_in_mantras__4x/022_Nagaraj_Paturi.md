छदि संवरणे is Yaaska's etymology for Chandas.

  

छंदांसि छादनात्

  

As per this, the very function of Chandas is to hold/secure the देवता of the (वैदिक) मंत्र .

  

Tantra has its own ways of securing the देवता of the मंत्र .

  

If a Taantrika uses Vaidika mantras he usesChandas to hold/secure the देवता of the (वैदिक) मंत्र .But in the Taantrika part Chandas is not his way of holding/securing the देवता of the मंत्र.
