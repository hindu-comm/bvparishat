Dear Sri Nagaraj-ji,

  

I have no problems with learning Sanskrit at all. I merely asked for an elucidation of what was a very cryptic message to me atleast. It is my understanding that lesser lights like us get to learn about things we are not aware of from Vidvans who have read widely and have practiced. I did not anywhere find an expert understanding of Sanskrit to be a pre-requisite to membership at this group.

I was therefore nonplused when he wrote that cryptic sentence.

  

I am deeply thankful for the varied informed views being shared in this forum.

  

Regards,

  

N
