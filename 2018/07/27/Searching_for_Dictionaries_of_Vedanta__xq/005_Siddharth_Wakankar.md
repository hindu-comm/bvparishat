Dear Dr.Acharya,

  

You must have seen the Vedanta Dictionary by Ernest Wood and I think some other scholar.

  

Some South Indian Scholar gas also edited one such Dictionary in Sanskrit,which is blessed by the Revered Shankaracharyaji.

  

Some 10/15 years ago,I edited one very rare work known as Shataprashnottari,based on a single manuscript,deposited in Oriental Institute,Baroda.

  

It is a discourse between an inquisitive Shishya and his competent Guru in the form of 100 questions and their answers.It covers almost the entire gamut of Technical Words like Maya,Avidya etc.It is published by Oriental Institute, Baroda.

  

I shall send a copy if any is available with me.Otherwise,you have to contact the O.I.

  

Best luck in your search.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
