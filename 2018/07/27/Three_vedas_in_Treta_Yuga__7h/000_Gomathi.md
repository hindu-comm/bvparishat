Namaste.

Sorry for cross posting. We know that it is Bhagawan Veda Vyasa who divided Vedas into 4 in Dwapara Yuga.

But there is a reference in Sri Valmiki Ramayana as Lord Sri Rama mentioning Anjaneya as the knower of three (Rig, Yajur and Sama) Vedas to Sri Lakshmana.

  

How do they refer to it?

Thanks in Advance for all replies

Gomathi.
