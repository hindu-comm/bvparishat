The theory of division of Vedas is as following:

  

Vedas exist eternally and get revealed to the drashTas /Brahmarshis during each cycle of creation.

  

The division of four exists in Vedas eternally.

  

The criteria of recognising to which division each mantra belongs are indicated in the Vedas themselves and are discussed in BraahmaNas and AaraNyakas.

  

In each cycle of creation, the loss of memory among the reciting svaadhyaayees, of the division to which the mantra he recites belongs is what is called as loss of division.

  

Vedavyaasa (the word itself means classifier of Vedas) restores this lost memory among the reciters using his knowledge of the criteria of recognising to which division each mantra

  

belongs that are indicated in the Vedas themselves and are discussed in BraahmaNas and AaraNyakas. This restoration of the lost memory among the recitersabout the division to which

  

the mantra each reciter recites belongsis being called classification.
