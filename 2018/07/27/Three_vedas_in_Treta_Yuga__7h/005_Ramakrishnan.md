The Vedas were called the trayi (the three), to which the atharva was added as the fourth, the itihasas and puranas were then called the fifth.

  

But the original veda was always threefold, and all three were originally on one.

  
After the fourth was added, the Vedas are not commonly called as trayi these days but they were called that in the time Ramayana and Ashtadyayi were composed.
