Just google "Mohammed in Vedas". There is a lot of discussion on the internet.

  

All such attempts by the proselytisers in thetwo Abrahamic religions to create fake books, wrong interpretations etc. themselves show how desperate the two proselytisers are to convert people into their religion, how opportunistic (each lie for each target group) they can turn in this desperation.
