Respected scholars,  
  
I am touching a sensitive subject of utmost importance. It has become a routine for the Islamic prosylitisers to quote from an upanishad called Allopanishad and from Bhavishya purana to establish the legitimacy of Islam and the entitlement of Muslims to preach Islam to Hindus.  
  
I sincerely request scholars to give their valued opinion on this issue.  
  
Whilst on the subject, I would like to be enlightened as how a "Purana" that narrates the old stories of the remote past can contain "Bhavishya" future incidents.  
  
Regards
