Dear Guruvars  

  

Pranaam

  

You have said that for 5th bhava both punyakaryani and purvajanmapunyam should be considered in line with the logic of mimamsa.

Earlier Sri Ramkrishnanji has referred to –

भाग्यधर्मदयापुण्यतपस्तातसुतात्मजाः ।

In relation to navama bhava.

Therefore, can we conclude that the word punya in the above shlok refer to purvapunya also?

Do acharyas like Adi Sankara also refer to punya as something related to past births only?

  

Once again Pranaam
