I encountered an interesting fact of religious marks at the Sringeri Matha at Kalady. There was a man sitting in the administrative office there with chandana made sandal colour religious marks which look close/similar to the Maadhva/ Vaishnava religious marks all over the visible upper portion of his body. But some significant Maadhva marks were missing. I asked him and the people around about his Vedanta s'aakhaa affiliation. I was told by the people around that he was a local Keralite person subscribing to S'ankara philosophy only. The religious marks, they explained, were pre-S'ankara tradition. Many Keralaite Brahmin families, they said, continue the same religious marks irrespective of theirVedanta s'aakhaa affiliation.
