Hari Om

  

To my mind, Indian marks fall under two broad categories: religious, and classificational.

  

Tripundra of the saivites, urdhva pundra of the vaishnavites, dot/dash of the saktas come under religious marks. These have their individual sampradaya variations.

  

The other category of marks is interesting. These serve not only to identify the religious affiliation of the adherent but also declare the station or situation of the wearer. For ex, the number of threads in the yajnopavita indicate ashrama (as also the way one ties a dhoti/pancha), the sindoor/bindi of women or the lack thereof indicate marital status (with the toe rings as well), the shikha of the dwija and the tilak of the kshatriya indicates caste, type of rosary identifies an upasaka, and so on.

  

There is a third sub-category that suggests itself to me: the yogi's marks. While broadly falling under religious marks, the yogis have their own tradition in this respect. For ex, the Nath sampradaya yogis are called kanphata (split-eared) from their initiation ritual, the aghoris, descendants of pasupata yogis, have their rudraksha-bearing, ash-besmeared bodies, and of course, the relatively modern tridandis and ekadandis etc are well-known. Some avadhutas in the old scriptures are shown as naked with nothing to identify them (the digambara tradition of the very old Jaina dharma has parallels here)

  

Along with Sri Subrahmanian, I am also interested in hearing from scholars here about the marks of mimamsakas, naiyayikas and sankhyas. These three are agnostic traditions, or at least not religious in the bhakti sense. I suppose for these traditions there must not be much scope for marks.
