Are there any authentic photographs of 'early' images of Vishnu, Shiva, etc.? Similar images of humans, depicting Brahmanas, too will be interesting to examine for their marks.

By the time of Shankara we had all the major Puranas like Shiva Purana and Vishnu purana which he has cited in the VSN Bhashya. In the Brahma sutra and Upanishad bhashyas Shankara talks about temple, worship, archana with flowers, etc. So the popular worship as a practice was there well established. In the works of Shaiva Nayanmars who flourished just before and during the time of Shankara we read accounts of Brahmins being agnihotris, vedic scholars, worshipers of Shiva, with bhasma dharana, etc. Sureshwara says Shankara is from Atri gotra. We can reasonably assume caste marks were in use in Shankara's family. Also there are Upanishads that talk of what kind of bhasma is to be used by which Ashrama.

  

There are injunctions in the smriti texts like 'religious karma performed without the marks on the forehead do not give fruit, etc.' My question was on this aspect too: whether purva mimamsakas adhered to such injunctions and if yes, what kind of marks did they don.
