True. He is differentiating Shankara Acharya from the prasiddha Shankara, Shiva. This does not imply that the Acharya does not don ashes. The commentary Tattvadipanam only says: This Shankara, Acharya, on the other hand (this is the contrast), is devoid of the wealth-vibhuti. The tattvadeepanam does not either say or imply that Shankara did not don ashes. The Rujuvivaranam gives one meaning as 'without ashes' and another, devoid of wealth.

There is reason to speculate since the commentator is not on equal status with Padmapada, who alone has seen Shankara. The commentator can only speculate on this matter. That is why the further, natural meaning, 'not the way Lord Shiva is smeared with ashes' is offered to save the commentary. On philosophical issues one can say that the commentator brings out the heart of the original author but not on the physical appearance of Shankara Acharya.
