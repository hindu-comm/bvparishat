//He is differentiating Shankara Acharya from the prasiddha Shankara, Shiva. This does not imply that the Acharya does not don ashes. The commentary Tattvadipanam only says: This Shankara, Acharya, on the other hand (this is the contrast), is devoid of the wealth-vibhuti.

It is well known that Lord Shiva dons ashes. The author is saying that the purpose of this verse is to differentiate (Adi) Shankara from Lord Shiva, who is the prasiddha Shankara. If both of them donned ashes, there is no differentiation in this aspect. Therefore, it is implied that in contrast to Lord Shiva, (Adi) Shankara did not don ashes. This is my understanding. If you disagree, that is fine.
