//In the above translation the author says that Padmapada uses double entendre and ended up using both the 'entendres' to Shankaracharya.//  
  
  
The verse of Padmapada is a double entendre on (Adi) Shankara. Each phrase has two meanings or interpretations.  
  
1. One meaning contrasts (Adi) Shankara from (the well-known God) Shiva (who is also called as Shankara).  
  
2. The other meaning applies to (Adi) Shankara by himself.  
  
Both meanings are applied to (Adi) Shankara.  
  
So let us examine the verse.  
  
A) namAmi -  
  
I bow to  
  
B) abhogi parivAra sampadam -  
  
Meaning 1. (Contrast with Lord Shiva) one who does not have rich entourage of snakes (Shiva is accompanied by snakes and Adi Shankara is not)  
  
Meaning 2. (Directly applicable to Adi Shankara) one who is surrounded by people who have no desire for enjoyments  
  
C) nirasta bhUtim -  
  
Meaning 1. (Contrast with Lord Shiva)  
  
One who does not smear ashes on his body (Shiva dons ashes on his body. Adi Shankara does not don ashes on his body).  
  
Meaning 2. (Directly applicable to Adi Shankara)  
  
One who is devoid of wealth (bhUti) or one who conquered existence (bhUti)  
  
D) anumArdha vigraham -  
  
Meaning 1. (Contrast with Lord Shiva)  
  
One who does not have Uma (Parvati) as other half  
  
Meaning 2. (Directly applicable to Adi Shankara)  
  
One who has logical inference  
  
E) Anugram -  
  
Meaning 1. (Contrast with Lord Shiva)  
  
one who is not Ugra (another name of Lord Shiva)  
  
Meaning 2. (Directly applicable to Adi Shankara)  
  
One who is not fierce  
  
F) unmRdita kAla lAnchanam -  
  
Meaning 1. (Contrast with Lord Shiva)  
  
One who does not have the black mark on the throat  
  
Meaning 2. (Directly applicable to Adi Shankara)  
  
One who has conquered time  
  
G) vinA vinAyakam -  
  
Meaning 1. (Contrast with Lord Shiva)  
  
One who is without Ganesa/Vinayaka  
  
Meaning 2. (Directly applicable to Adi Shankara)  
  
One who defeated the Buddhists  
  
H) apUrva Sankaram -  
  
(I bow to the) New Shankara (who has been contrasted with the well-known Shankara, or Lord Shiva).  
  
  
// For “nirastabhUtim”, the explanation given is “bhasmarahitaM nirastaishvaryaṃ vA” (bhasmarahitam means without ashes, nirastaishvaryam means without wealth). Thus the RujuvivaraNam is  
saying that (Adi) Shankara did not don the bhasma OR he is without wealth. This commentator is not categorically stating 'Shankara was without bhasma' because he is considering another alternative meaning: 'nirastaishvaryam vA' = OR he is without the wealth / vibhuti of Lord Shiva'.//  
  
The author of Rujuvivaranam is giving two meanings because it is double entendre. Both meanings- without ashes or without wealth are equally applicable to (Adi) Shankara.  
  
  
//This one says - "prasiddha Shankara vilakshaNam paramahamsa parAyaNam ShankarAchAryam namAmi....". The commentary then goes on ....  

“vailakshaṇyamAha...."  
  
Thus the commentator is clearly differentiating the prasiddha Shankara (Shiva) from (Adi) Shankaracharya.  
  
For bhUtih, the commentator says -  
  
bhUtiḥ -- bhasitam (ashes), tadanuliptagAtraḥ saḥ (sah here refers to prasiddha Shankara or Shiva) । ayaṃ (this refers to Adi Shankara) tvaiSvaryalakshaNabhUtividhuraH” ( अयं (शंकराचार्यः) तु ऐश्वर्यलक्षणभूतिविदुरः)  
  

First he gives the meaning for the word 'bhūti' of the verse to apply to Shiva: bhūtiḥ=bhasitam. Then he says: tadanuliptāgāraḥ = Shiva is the one whose body is smeared with bhasma. Then the vailakshanya is brought out: Shankara, on the other hand, is devoid of the bhūti that is aishvarya. Nowhere does this mean that the commentator is holding that 'Shankaracharya is without bhasma.' //  
  
  
Please note here the author has explicitly stated in the beginning that (Adi) Shankara is being differentiated from prasiddha Shankara (Lord Shiva). Hence, it is already implied that Adi Shankara does not don ashes in addition to not being wealthy. As explained above, each phrase has 2 meanings.  
  
//Similarly, when it is said 'did not smear ashes', the context being the comparison of Shankara with Lord Shiva, it is only meant that 'not the way Lord Shiva is: with his whole body smeared with ashes' and not 'no ashes at all.'//  
  
With all due respect, this is pure speculation. When we have direct statement that Adi Shankara did not don ashes, there is no reason to speculate.
