Here is a question on the religious habits of purva mimamsakas of the very olden days, older than the period of Shankaracharya. The period of Kumarila Bhatta and his predecessors. What was their mark on the forehead? Was there any requirement in the shaastra (their shaastra, veda) about this requirement? Did they perform all their karma-s like sandhya, yajnas, etc. with nothing on the forehead and other parts of their body? Was there any requirement of arpana of the karma to any higher deity, like what we do in the present day: krishnarpanamastu/shivarpanamastu/narayanayeti samarpayami, etc. Is there any reference for these in the purvamimamsa texts? The question may be extended to naiyayikas, vaisheshikas, sankhyas, patanjalas too. \[I avoided composing this in Sanskrit so that many people can participate in this discussion, if it gets initiated.\]
