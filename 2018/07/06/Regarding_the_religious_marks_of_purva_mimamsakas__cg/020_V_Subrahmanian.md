Many Thanks Sri Korada ji, for the valuable inputs. Anulepanam I think is admitted by Purva Mimamsakas too as the bhasma of the agnihotra is considered sacred. Even non-Advaitins like Vaishnavas who practice agnihotra, agnikarya (samidhaadhaanam), etc. take a pinch of the bhasma and do anulepanam. They may not call it bhasmadhaaranam.

  

warm regards
