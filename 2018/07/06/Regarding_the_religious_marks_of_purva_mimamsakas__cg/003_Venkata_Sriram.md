Namaste,

  

Our vedic teacher used to say that it was urdhvapundra (shuddha jala / mrittika) first. The bhasma dhAraNa is after agni-kArya.

  

Generally, the vedic scholars belonging to Godavari / Krishna belt, apply urdhvapundra either with gopichandana / tulasi mrittika / shuddha jala and commence sandhya. After arghya, they apply bhasma and do resume again. This is what I follow. I apply urdhvapundra with gopichandana.

  

There is no scriptural reference for tilaka-dhAraNa (kumkuma) in shruti / smriti and has has crept in from shAkta sampradAya.

  

rgs,

sriram
