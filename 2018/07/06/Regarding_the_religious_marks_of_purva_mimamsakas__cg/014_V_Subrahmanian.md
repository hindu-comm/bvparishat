In the above translation the author says that Padmapada uses double entendre and ended up using both the 'entendres' to Shankaracharya.

  

  

There are two Sanskrit commentaries to the Panchapadika and here are the portions for that verse of Padmapada, particularly the word
'nirastabhutim':

  

  

1. RujuvivaraNam  
  
For “nirastabhUtim”, the explanation given is “bhasmarahitaMnirastaishvaryaṃ vA” (bhasmarahitam means without ashes,nirastaishvaryam means without wealth). Thus the RujuvivaraNam is  
saying that (Adi) Shankara did not don the bhasma OR he iswithout wealth. This commentator is not categorically stating 'Shankara was without bhasma' because he is considering another alternative meaning: 'nirastaishvaryam vA' = OR he is without the wealth / vibhuti of Lord Shiva'. The BG 10 chapter is called 'vibhuti yoga' which is a description, a sample, of the glories of Brahman.  
  
2. tattvadIpanam  
  
This one says - "prasiddha Shankara vilakshaNam paramahamsa parAyaNamShankarAchAryam namAmi....". The commentary then goes on ....  
“vailakshaṇyamAha...."  
  
Thus the commentator is clearly differentiating the prasiddha Shankara(Shiva) from (Adi) Shankaracharya.  
  
For bhUtih, the commentator says -  
  
bhUtiḥ -- bhasitam (ashes), tadanuliptagAtraḥ saḥ (sah here refers toprasiddha Shankara or Shiva) । ayaṃ (this refers to Adi Shankara)*tvaiSvaryalakshaNabhUtividhuraH” ( अयं (शंकराचार्यः) तु ऐश्वर्यलक्षणभूतिविदुरः)*

  

First he gives the meaning for the word 'bhūti' of the verse to apply to Shiva: bhūtiḥ=bhasitam. Then he says: tadanuliptāgāraḥ = Shiva is the one whose body is smeared with bhasma. Then the vailakshanya is brought out: Shankara, on the other hand, is devoid of the bhūti that is aishvarya. Nowhere does this mean that the commentator is holding that 'Shankaracharya is without bhasma.'  

  

  

Even taking the 'Shankara did not smear ashes' of G.C.Pande and the Rujuvivaranam's first alternative of 'bhasmarahitam', the meaning does not amount to 'absolutely no bhasma'. For there is an admitted method of Vyakarana as brought out here:

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/be9dl2fzYEY>  By Vidwan Sri Subrahmanyam Korada:  

  

सतः अविवक्षा -- अनुदरा कन्या ( it means a girl with slender waist) 
'anudaraa kanyaa' means literally: 'a damsel with no waist'. But this is impossible. What is intended by that expression is: a girl with a slender waist (as opposed to an obese one). Similarly, when it is said 'did not smear ashes', the context being the comparison of Shankara with Lord Shiva, it is only meant that 'not the way Lord Shiva is: with his whole body smeared with ashes' and not 'no ashes at all.' 

  

There are many examples for such usage. One is the famous Sri Venkateswara Suprabhatam line: श्रीवैकुण्ठविरक्ताय स्वामिपुष्करिणीतटे \| रमया रममाणाय वेंकटेशाय मंगलम्' \[It literally means: Glory to Venkatesha who having despised and renounced vaikuntha has taken up abode in the swami pushakarini pond and in union with Lakshmi. But this will not be the absolute state of affairs for the author does not really mean that Narayana has despised and vacated Vaikuntha. Such a situation is unimaginable for the school to which the author belongs. Hence it is only a glorification of the Tirupati kshetram and the Lord presiding there.\] 

  

Thus, the verse of Padmapada does not constitute the authority to decide on what Shankara wore as marks, or what he did not.
