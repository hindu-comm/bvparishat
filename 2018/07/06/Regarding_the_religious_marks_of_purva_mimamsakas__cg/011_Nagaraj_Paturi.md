There is a great possibility.

  

But the present iconised figure of Sankara with three horizontal white Vibhuti marks on the forehead and other parts of the body is also due to our great pride of India Raja Ravi Varma Chitra ttirunal Maharaj , a Keralite only.

  

Probably he was having the Sankaracharyas of mathas in mind.
