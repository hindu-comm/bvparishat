Hari Om

  

There is a lot of confusion and variation regarding the scientific dating of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The dates arrived at by researchers often vary widely wrt one another.

  

We all are aware, no doubt, that in the absence of archaeological data any dating is majorly an exercise in conjecture, but internal evidence and tradition also cannot be disregarded.  

  

With this in mind, could the learned members here direct us to the best possible dates of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata?

  

Thank you
