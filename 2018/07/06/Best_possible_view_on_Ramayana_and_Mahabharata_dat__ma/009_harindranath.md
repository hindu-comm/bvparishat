Since we are on the subject of dating Ramayana and Mahabharata, I am interested to know the opinion of the  

members of this group on a book published almost a century ago from Kerala.  

  

Title: The Permanent History of Bharata Varsha

Author: K. Narayana Aiyer

In two parts

self-published by the author in 1918. The author was the Superintendent of the School of Arts of the Maharaja of Travancore. Note the apparent contradiction in the title, which was intentional.  

Available at Google books.

The first part and a portion of the second part were reprinted by Cosmo Publications in 2001 in two volumes with (India) added in the title which totally contradicts the views expressed in the book. The author's name and "permanent" were also misspelled. Cosmo Publications also failed to give the earlier publication history of the book.  

  

The missing portion of the book was available at ASI site as a scanned pdf.  

  

The author's views are in conflict with almost all of modern scholarship.

Nevertheless I find the book extremely useful.
