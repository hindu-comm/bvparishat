Sri CSR Prabhu, if not inconvenient, could you give us any link/reference to the studies you mention pls.

  

The date arrived at by the study under discussion is 1504 BC after cross-referencing of internal astronomical data in the text. How do the dates 6000 BC and 3102 BC compare with the date 1504 BC in terms of internal textual consistency? Would appreciate your views.
