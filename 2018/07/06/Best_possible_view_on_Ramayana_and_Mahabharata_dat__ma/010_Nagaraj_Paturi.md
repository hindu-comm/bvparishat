There were similar books of the early 20th century.

  

Sri Kota Venkatachalam was one such author from Andhra Pradesh known all over India:

**Pandit Kota Venkatachalam Pakayaji**(1885-1959) known as a great Historian of yester years with his titles as ‘Bharata Charitra Bhaskara and vimarsakagresara’ is infact a versatile personality with diverse characteristics rarely seen in a single person. He was knowledgeable in Astrology, Astronomy and Geography. In order to appreciate the indepth study and research Sri Kota Venkatachalam has done with his thorough knowledge in the above subjects, one has to patiently go through his works like ‘Jamboo Dweepamu’, ‘Aryula Dhruva Nivasa Khandanamu’, ‘Brahmanda Srishti Viganamu’ etc., (Telugu) where in he profusely quotes our ancient Sastras, Rishis and Scholars right up to Bhaskaracharya.

  

His important historical publications include the following –

1. Ancient Hindu history Part I, 2. Ancient Hindu history Part II, 3. Chronology of Nepal History, reconstructed, 4. Chronology of Kashmir History reconstructed, 5. The plot in Indian Chronology 6. The Age of Budha, Milinda and Amtiyoka and Yuga Purana, 7. Indian Eras, 8. Historicity of Vikramaditya and Salivahana, 9. Age of War (Printed after his Sidhi) and many other books in Telugu. He took Sanyasa and ascended Abhinava Virupaksha Peetham on 8-7-1957.

  

Pandit Kota Venkatachalam has infact got printed clearly

  

a) Imperial Royal dynasties of Bharat after Mahabharat war ie. From 36 years before Kali or 3138 B.C. to 4295 Kali or 1193 A.D. (Vide Annexure – I attached to this article)

  

b) Statement showing the contemporaneity of Kings with their reigning periods in 3 of the States of Bharat namely 1. Magadha. 2. Nepal, 3. Kashmir (Vide Annexure II enclosed)

  

c) . He finally records with satisfaction the important dates in the history of Bharat which he has proved sufficiently. (Vide Annexure-III).

  

In his**An appeal to the Young Indologists**, Pandit Kota Venkatachalam states the following.

  

The history of India, particularly of the ancient period, as it is found in the Text books of schools and colleges and in the writings of research scholars of Indology, enquires through revision. European scholars, who attempted to construct our history, seriously erred in chronology.  
  
1. The false assumption that the Aryans came from outside India and the wrong identification of Chandra-Gupta-Maurya of 1534 B.C. with another Chandra-Gupta, the contemporary of Alexander’s time (326 B.C.) led to several errors in chronology and other aspects of our history  
  
2. The Puranas which are a storehouse of historical information were discredited as mere fiction. Several facts from the Puranas that do credit to our history and culture are entirely omitted in the historical writings of Europeans and their Indian followers.  
  
3. Some Indologists went to the length of interpolating in and otherwise tampering with the writings of ancient foreign visitors of India and with the Buddhist literature.  
  
4. Many ancient inscriptions like the Kumbhalghar Inscription (V. S. 1517) were destroyed  
  
5. The genuine Inscription of Janamejaya (Ind. Ant. Pp.333, 334) dated Kali 89 or 3012 B.C. has been rejected as being spurious. Several other important ancient inscriptions between 3138 B.C. and 300 B.C. were destroyed.  
  
6. Some coins and Inscriptions have been misread, misinterpreted, misapplied and misrepresented and some are forged so as to be used for supporting the modern theories.  
  
7. The Aihole inscription and others that establish correctly the date of the War (3138 B.C.) have been neglected.  
  
8. Some important dates which are supposed to be Anchor Sheets of Ancient Indian chronology have been arbitrarily determined, with no regard for or reference to ancient literature.
