Namaste,

  

I have been a long-time and satisfied user of Bhasha IME for typing in Sanskrit (devanagari and IAST transliteration), but now find that Windows 10 doesn't support it anymore. I am now using Google Input Tools to type in Devanagari for Word documents - it is extremely unsatisfying compared to Bhasha, but gets the job done. Is there an alternative to this for devanagari? Google Input Tools doesn't seem to have any option at all for IAST transliteration - what is the best way to do this with Windows 10?

  

Many thanks,

Priya
