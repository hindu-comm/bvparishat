Thank you, Prof. Paturi, for the suggestions. But Microsoft Bhasha India has nothing for IAST Unicode support for Windows 10 on their website. I did go through the other link as well, but it basically tells you to design your own keyboard layout, or do a tedious cut and paste job from a character map. I was hoping that others who have migrated to Windows 10 may have found some way around this problem.

  

Thank you,

Priya
