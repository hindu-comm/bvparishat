Dear Nityananda Ji,

  

  I checked Boehtlingk's dictionary and it only gives a reference to Pāṇini, and Mayrhofer's etymological dictionary does not offer any reference. Similarly, the Vedic Word Concordance of Vishva Bandhu only refers to Pāṇini and provides no reference to any other occurrence. It is possible that such otherwise unattested words, specifically provided by Pāṇini, occurred in the dialect of Sanskrit in his North-Western region around his locality of Śalātura in the Swat Valley. Most of Sanskrit literature that comes to us does not come from this region, and so some of the peculiarities of that region are lost in other regions.
There are some other examples of this that I have discussed in an old article.
