Namaste Shastry garu,

  

I understand your concern.

  

Unfortunately, nobody is working on the Speech, with focus on Sanskrit.

  

But let me tell you that there is a group of scholars who have taken the properties of phoneme into account, and are developing a generation system following Ashtaadhyayii. You may like to look at the works of
Anand Mishra from Germany, Peter Scharf on the formalising Ashtaadhyaayii and Samir Sohoni and Malhar Kulkarni on the implementation. All of them have defined a structure to represent a sound unit.

  

With kind regards,

Amba Kulkarni
