Dear Shri Krishna Kashyap Ji,

  

The Google translator has done a terrible job. Here is my oroginal Abhanga with my own English translation:

  

पंढरीच्या विठ्ठले केली मोठी चोरी

घरदार माझे लुटुनी नेले

The Vitthala of Pandharpur \[= Lord Vishnu\] committed a great robbery.
He looted my house and all my belongings.

  

राहिले होते थो़डे माझेचि मीपण

तेही त्याने नेले जाता जाता

A little of my sense of "I" had remained, but he took that away as he was leaving.

  

आता काय उरले काहीच कळेना

शोधूनि पाहाता मोकळा मी

I don't know now what still remains there. When I search for it, I am totally empty.

  

काय भगवंता तुझी ही करणी

माधवाची चोरी करी माधव

O Lord, is this your doing? Madhava committed a theft of Madhava.
