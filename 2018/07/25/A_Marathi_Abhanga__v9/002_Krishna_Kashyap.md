unfortunately

  

this is what I got from translation of marathiusing google translate:

  

  
The largest theft of Vitthal Pandharpur

Ludus into my house

They were thode my selfconceit

He also took on the go

Now nothing remains of what did not

I see a clear out

What is an act of God to thee

Madhavaci theft curry Madhav

  

  

I wish someone can correct this translation! so that I can understand the abhang.
