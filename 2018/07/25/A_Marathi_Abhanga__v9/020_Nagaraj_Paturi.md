\> When root language of ‘ Brahmi’ suffers in ‘ Computational Linguistics/ Sanskrit Computational Linguistics’, the root error permeates the rest of the analysis in understanding other Brahmi derived and branched out languages.

  

  

----- Sir, can you kindly tell us more about this root language of ‘ Brahmi’?

  

I know an ancient script called Brahmi. Also know that it is considered as the root of most of the scripts of Indian languages. Did you mean that script here?
