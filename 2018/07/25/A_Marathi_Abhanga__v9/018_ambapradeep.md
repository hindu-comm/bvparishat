First I would like to bring to your notice the usage: It is 'Sanskrit Computational Linguistics' and not 'Computational Sanskrit Linguistics'.

While it is to some extent true that Sanskrit Computational Linguistics is a sub section of computational linguistics, but it is also different from the computational linguistics.  

Sanskrit Computational Linguistics deals with two aspects: 1) Use of Computational Linguistics for the processing of Sanskrit texts, 2) Use of Indian Grammatical Tradition for computational Linguistics. It is this latter part which differentiates it from the Computational Linguistics. The second part draws insights mainly with the Ashtadhyayii, and the theories of Shaabdabodha. As of now, we have three well defined areas in which the work is going on under this sub division. The first one is the Sanskrit generator (major work is still in word form generation) following the Ashtaadhyaayii. The scholars are not only interested in building the generators, but are also interested in understanding Ashtaadhyaayii from computational view point. The second one is use of the concepts from Paninian tradition and the theories of Shaabdabodha for analysis of Sanskrit texts. And the third one is its use for analysis of other languages. For example, Tree banks for several Indian languages have been developed following the Paninian Kaaraka system.
