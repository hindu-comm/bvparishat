Namaste

  

1. Paturi garu:  On \< root language of ‘ Brahmi’?> and \<Did you mean that script here? \>

  

  I used the term \< Brahmi> in the sense described in Amara Kosha -' Brahmi to Bharati bhashaa'  ब्राह्मी तु भारती भाषा ' - in the limited sense of ' Languages of Bharath, more specifically Samskruth- Prakruths, Tamils, Apabhramshas , Apabhramsha and Desi languages. The generic terms used to describe this ' language family' is ABUDIGA , Aryan and Dravidian languages, Indic Languages... .,

  

 All these are ' Voice Primary', inter connected , dovetailed as portable across one language to another language with grammar rules ( like Tatsama - Tadbhava …).

  

 I meant languages with a feature of ' True scripting', which means
Writing follows the phonetic flow in speaking' ( उक्तस्य , उक्तानां उक्तिवत् लेखनम् , संकेत करणम् ) . And this feature is other wise called ' Non-Roman Script/ Non-English like' family of languages.

  

 ***A side issue***: To understand ' historicity and evolution of Indic languages, there can be an alternative to the Indo European linguistics mode and propositions. This proposal can as well get anchored to Rishbhadevas narration in Jaina texts on ' Origin of plurality of Languages and how they get coded'. The reference text is Siribhoovalaya, a text being explored by Central Institute of Indian Languages as well Computer programmers.

  

  In any case, History of Language and script evolution are
non-issues for researching in Computational Linguistics. Language Grammars and Dictionaries, Works on articulation of languages and literature do play the vital role.

  

  

  

2. Amba ji : On \< I understand your concern. **Unfortunately, nobody is working on the Speech, with focus on Sanskrit**. But let me tell you that there is **a group of scholars who have taken the properties of phoneme into account, and are developing a generation system following Ashtaadhyayii**. You may like to look at the works of Anand Mishra from Germany, Peter Scharf on the formalising Ashtaadhyaayii and Samir Sohoni and Malhar Kulkarni **on the implementation. All of them have defined a structure to represent a sound unit**. \> :

  

  

Thanks for recognizing the nature, long term implications and seriousness of the problem.

  

Working with ' voice dissection to get at the phonemic units' has a history of over five decades ( or more, starting with Bell labs / Turing Test et al) . Lead corporates like IBM are still working on understanding the ' Voice of the Word' to ' Define and program it for Human Machine Voice Interfaces as Spoken Language Systems' and deliver ' driverless vehicles' ! 

  

What is promoted as working solutions, seemingly for English is ' brute force driven model' creating an illusion of ' Intelligent
Thinking/ Thought comprehending Machines'. There is still a long journey ahead to see the reality of ' Star wars' model of West / and / or old ' mantra- astra/ mantra danda magic working with Sanskrit mantras.

  

So, the question and invitation remains: Can we the ' Samskruth Team' put our act together to develop Samskruth Language Appropriate Technology and find Voice Interface solutions for Non-English Languages ?

  

The work starts here, and with the refinement of ' old work horse QWERTY layout keyboard' !

  

OR

  

Do we allow every other team in world to explore and exploit the rich heritage of Samskrutham ( like it is being done for Yoga) and be for ever 'eternally yours faithfully and obedient' !
