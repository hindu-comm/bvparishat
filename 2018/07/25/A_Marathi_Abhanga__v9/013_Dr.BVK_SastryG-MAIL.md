Namaste Krishna Kashyap , Madhav Deshpande ji



1**. Thanks Krishna Kashyap**, for sharing the ‘ Google Translation’ of ‘ Contemporary Marathi Abhang’. Your experience is not a isolated one. Many have the same challenge.



 This is a good illustration for ‘ Computational Sanskrit Linguists, Machine Translation Experts, AI teams’ to examine carefully on where ‘ Techno-linguist programmers’ creating dictionaries and ‘ Rules for translation’ need to be revisited !



2. **May I request Prof. Deshpande** to provide his own ‘English translation of his composition’. This provides two benefits. (a) Authors intention in the abhnag ( b) A reference to check how far and by how much of deviation the Google Machine translation takes the reader !





Regards
