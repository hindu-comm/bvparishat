All:

  

I came across a reference to the book "Tarpana" written byChapekar (Narayan Govind Chapekar) in another book.

  

I am not able to find this book online/[archive.org](http://archive.org) or in amazon. Anybody has any idea regarding this?

  

Also it seems he has written few more books on Rg Veda. Please let me know if you have access to those...

  

Thanks,

Ganesh.
