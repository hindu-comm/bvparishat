Namaskars,

  

In my understanding sandhya-vandanam is not exactly the upasana of Surya but of the cosmic being Hiranyagarbha, as the Vedanta says. It is a samashti upasana as opposed to vyashti upasanas such as Hanumad upasana, Saraswati upasana etc. The vyashti upasana is similar to the viswarupa upasana seen in the chapter 11 of the Gita. Krishna himself tells Arjuna, 'Why are you interested in these small manifestations? See my cosmic form which is sarva-devatatmaka"(10-49).

The Aditya-hridayam too is a samshti upasana as we can see reference to all god-forms in it.

  

As you all know, the advaitic tradition of kara-nyasa (similar mantras for anga-nyasa too) says as follows:

  

Om, tat-savituh -Brahmatmane angushtabhyam namah,

varenyam -Vishnvatmane tarjanibhyam namah,

bhargo devasya -Rudratmane madhyamabhyam namah,

dhimahi- satyatmane anamikabhyam namah

dhiyo yo nah -jnanatmane kanishtikabhyam namah

prachodayat -sarvatmane kara-tala kara-prishtabhyam namah.

  

The Vedanta teachers say that this is referring to Satyam-Jnanam-Anantam Brahma which is beyond the thri-murthi-s. The first three are manifestations in Hiranyagarbha whereas the Brahman is the only reality.

  

I am sorry for not using the IAST.
