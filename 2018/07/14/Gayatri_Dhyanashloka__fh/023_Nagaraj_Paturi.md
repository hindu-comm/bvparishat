Shri Korada ji: I am still not completely clear about why gadAm is preferred to guNAm - do please explain this in layman's terms? Thanks. Also how do we apply traditional heuristics when a certain version has been given down by the rshis? (Was it? or was it a later addition?)

  

What Prof. Korada was saying was:

  

It can not be guNam because

  

guNa = bowstring

  

guNam + hastair vahanteem --> carrying the bowstring in hand

  

this description is not tenable because one holds bow not bowstring

  

it can be made tenable by arguing that holding bowstring means holding bow only because of metaphor (lakshaNaa)

  

but (such?) lakshaNaa is a dosha (defect of expression) as per poorvameemaamsaa.

  

Since we need to assume that the respected/ revered verse can not have a dosha, we have to infer that the word there is gadaam not guNam.
