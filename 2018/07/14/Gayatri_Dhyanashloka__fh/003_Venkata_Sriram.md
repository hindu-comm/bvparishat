Namaste,

  

Considering theseपाठभेदाः, it is always better to learn the anuSTAna, mantra-shAstra etc. from one's spiritual preceptor otherwise confusions arise.

  

I learnt Chandi Sapthasathi under a great sanskrit scholar. While learning, I used to compare with other books like Gita Press, Ramakrishna Mutt Publications, Chowkhamba, Sringeri Mutt Publication etc. Slight variations were there. I used to ask whether our pATha is correct or not. Our acharya used to nod that ours is absolutely correct and no need to worry and that's how he learnt from his acharya. Then I compared the meanings by referring Amarakosha etc. and found to be correct in meanings.

  

This is how the tradition is followed. Without tradition and acharya, one is bound to get confusions when one encounter pATha-bhEdAs. One should have sound knowledge of sanskrit and also have a good sampradAya teacher.

  

rgs,

sriram
