Dear Shri Venkata Sriramji:

  

Thank you for the sources.

  

Is there a dating for Gayatri Tantram and who compiled it?

  

Many thanks again.

  

Dear Shri Nagaraj ji --> Yajnopavita is also a valid interpretation given that the AvAhana mantra says "shatkukshih panchashIrshOpanayane viniyOgah" which some translators interpret as the Deity presiding over the Upanayana ceremony.

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
