"I was told" is not a reference based academic statement. It was a statement I heard as part of a general conversation.

  

The person who mentioned this to me , said that he observed it in the Sri VaishNava /Ramanuja paddhati Sandhyavandanam and his Sri Vaishnava friends mentioned to him that their gurus instructed them to use dhyeyassadaa for dhyaana s'loka.
