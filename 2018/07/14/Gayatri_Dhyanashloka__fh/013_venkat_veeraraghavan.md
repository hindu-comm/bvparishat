Thank you for the clarifications Shri Nagaraj ji and Shri Korada ji:

  

Shri Korada ji: I am still not completely clear about why gadAm is preferred to guNAm - do please explain this in layman's terms? Thanks. Also how do we apply traditional heuristics when a certain version has been given down by the rshis? (Was it? or was it a later addition?) Which is why it is even more important to find out the original source for this dhyanasloka.

  

The "dhyeyah sadA" dhyana sloka is basically one to Surya Narayana and is part of the upasthAna mantras in YV sandhya.

  

One of the reasons for guNa without dhanus could be that the sAvitrI unlike other mantras is an output routed back to the source in the sense that it is a prayer requesting Savita to stimulate our "dhiyah" so in that sense the devI provides the bow-string and the dhanus is provided by the sadhaka (just speculating here).

  

Please give a description of what else she holds along with the ankushah? It says: "ankushakashah"
