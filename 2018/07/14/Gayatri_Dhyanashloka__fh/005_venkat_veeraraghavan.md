Also what does She have in Her hands where it says ankushakashAh (elephant's goad and ? (I always thought that was the rope? ))...

Is there a root source for this sloka? There is a mention in Sarada Tilaka, but since it was a compendium the original source has to be earlier.

This begs the next questions:

  

1\. Why a dhyana sloka for Gayatri when the devata of the "gayatri mantra" is Savita?

2\. The rk 3.62.10 RV is called the Savitri and the mantra preceded by pranava and mahavyahriti is traditionally called Gayatri. But where does this unified form of "Gayatri" have its place/ significance with 5 heads 10 hands and different instruments in each hand?

  

Although in Narayana Up. the AvAhana mantra with AyAtu varadA devI...ending in the mantra with 7 vyahritis, the form of the Devi is not mentioned as in muktA vidruma...

  

Can you please write in detail about these points if possible?

  

Many thanks,

  

Venkat
