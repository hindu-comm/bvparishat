Dear Learned Members,

  

  

The attached Shloka of Gayatri is from the Bodhayana Brahmakarma Samucchaya.

  

There is some controversy on the correct shloka wrt guna/ gada (shubhram kapalam gunam/gadam)..

  

I am confused on whether Gayatri Devi is holding a gada or guna (what is this in terms of instrument?).

  

Can you please clarify which is the appropriate word here?

  

Many thanks,

  

Venkat
