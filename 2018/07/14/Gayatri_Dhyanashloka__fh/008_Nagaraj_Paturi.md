Regarding five faces

  

<https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/the-five-faces-of-gayatri-the-five-divine-sheaths>

  

seems to be connecting many fives with the five faces.

  

Among them, the following seems to be almost matching with the five colours.

  

**The Lord of space is Vishnu. The goddess of fire is Maheshwari power. The Lord of wind is Sun. The Lord of earth is Shiva and the Lord of water is Ganapati Ganesh. In this manner the 5 gods of our body are the Lords (existence) of the 5 elements (KAPILTANTRA).**  

  

 **Vishnu =**Pearl colour

  

 **goddess of fire**= Red colour

  

**Sun** = Golden colour

  

**Shiva** = Black colour

  

**Ganapati Ganesh** = White colour
