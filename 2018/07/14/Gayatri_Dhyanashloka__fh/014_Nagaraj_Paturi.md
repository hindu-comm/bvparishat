After getting enlightened that my conversation that I quoted was just a gossip I went in search of Srivaishnava sources and realised that muktaavidruma being replaced by some other s'loka is not factual, the Sri Vaishnava procedure does indeed have muktaavidruma in it.

  

But this search resulted in my getting to know of another interesting verse included in a text of Sri Vaishnava Sandhyavandanam procedure, that is very much similar to dyeyassadaa in viewing nArAyaNa as savitrmaNDalamadhyavartI:

  

arkamaNDala-madhyastham sUryakoTisamaprabham \|

brahmAdi-sevyapAdAbjam naumi brahma ramAsakham \|\|

``` Rama,

The following is taken from the Ahnika of Tirukkudandai Gopala Desikan (18th century), who set a standard for Vaidika anushThAna in the sampradAya. My sandhyA krama is nowhere near so detailed, and what I reproduce below is taken purely from my understanding 
of the text, so I apologize in advance for any errors. ```

``` After arghya-pradAnam and tarpaNam, the details for gAyatrI japa are as follows.

1) Rshi-chandas-devatA nyAsa for the prANAyAma mantra --
   praNava and vyAhRtis, then for gAyatrI, then for 
   gAyatrI-Siras (om Apo jyotIraso'mRtam brahma bhUr-bhuvas-suvar om)

2) bodily nyAsa (?) for the seven vyAhRtis
   bhU: -- feet
   bhuva: -- calves (jangha)
   suva: -- knees
   maha: -- thighs and belly button
   jana: -- throat, heart, and abdomen
   tapa: -- face
   satyam -- top of the head (mastaka)

3) Meditation on some particular forms. They are not named, but from
   the description, they are male forms, presumably of Narayana.

4) Now, first anga-nyAsa of just the gAyatrI (no vyAhRtis):
   up to savituh -- jnAnAya hRdayAya nama:
   vareNyam -- aiSvaryAya Sirase svAhA
   up to devasya -- Saktyai SikhAyai vaushaT
   dhImahi -- balAya kavacAya hum
   up to yonah -- tejase netrAbhyAm vaushaT
   last word -- vIryAya astrAya phaT

5) First part of gAyatrI dhyAnam -- muktA-vidruma...
   
6) vyApaka nyAsam using the gAyatrI-Siras 
   ("SiromantreNa karAbhyAm Sira:prabhRti pAdAntam 
     vyApakanyAsam kRtvA...")

7) "arka maNdala-madhyastham" -- meditation on Narayana
   within the orb of the sun 

8) 3 prANAyAmas 
   (So far, most of us would have skipped steps 2-7)

9) sankalpa for japa

10) gAyatrI AvAhanam with "AyAtu varadA devi"
   
11) Now, further gAyatrI dhyAnam, with
    the "prAtar dhyAyAmi gAyatrIm" sloka mentioned earlier ```
