It is our textbook on Patanjali Yoga Sutras, with all 4 padas and 195 (196) sutras translated.

It gives a crisp gist that is almost a literal English translation of the Sanskrit sutra.

More often than not, an English commentary is added to see how the sutra applies to us in a modern context.

  

In addition, for the Sanskrit enthusiast, each word in the sutra is clearly separated and given with cases.

Jai Gurudev
