With hundreds of barbarian and foreign kings such as shaka, tuShAra, darada, pArada, sR^i\~Ngala, khasa, pahlava and haimavata,

the yavana king, surrounded by the barbarian and foreign kings, like moths, with varieties of dresses and weapons, reached Mathura.

These tribes were from Northwest (bordering Afghanistan) area of the ancient India. The same tribes were described as coming to helpof Vashis'tha when Vishvamitra was taking Kaamadhenu forcibly. No soldiers appear from the body of Kaamadhenu (No chamatkaara). The place of Vashis'tha in the Northwest makes perfect sense helping Bharat tribe. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
