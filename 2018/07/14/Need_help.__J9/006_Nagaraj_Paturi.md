Recently one woman throgh one of my friends was asking for help in studying the 16 Hindu sanskaaras from Psychology perspective.

  

I was telling her that a Psychology study of the same was done as a PhD work by late Prof. E G Parameswaran of Osmani University.

  

Such rituals are called Rites of Passage or Life Cycle Rituals.

  

Cultural Anthropology is the discipline that studies them.

  

There is always a traditional interpretation of all these.

  

Beauty of 'Hinduism' /Vedic culture is that there is a rigorous logical 'scientific' explanation for its components from inside the tradition itself. I call it Auto-Anthropology of the Vedic culture.

  

Now tell us which rituals, which kind of explanation are you focusing on?
