The four shlokas 87-90 starting with "mAtApit^RisahasrANi" which appear in the 100 shloka Bharata Savitri presented at  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/giirvaani/giirvaani/bs/bs.htm>

are popularly known as Bharata Savitri and appear in the fifth adhyAya of Svargarohanaparva of Mahabharata as shlokas 60-63. But in his Bhavadipa commentary on Mahabharata, Nilakantha has not commented on these. He just says  

"sandhyAyAM bhArataM paThanIyamityuktam \|  

tatra paThanayogyaM bhAratasArasamgrahaM chatushlokIrUpamAha -- mAteti \|\|"
