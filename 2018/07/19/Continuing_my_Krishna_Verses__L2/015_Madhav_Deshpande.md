Continuing my Krishna Verses:

  

मा-माधव-संवाद-केलि:

Sanskrit Riddle: Playful conversation between Mā \[=Lakshmi\] and Mādhava

  

माधव उवाच -

Madhava said:

  

अयि मे! त्वयि मे चित्तं संलग्नं मयि ते यथा ।

माधवो रमते मायां रमते माधवेऽपि मा ।।४७१।।

\[tips: मे is the vocative of मा, मायाम् is the locative form, and मा is the nominative form\]

  

O Lakshmi \[= मे\], my heart is attached to you, as is yours to me. Mādhava delights in Lakshmi \[= मायाम्\], and Lakshmi \[= मा\] delights in Madhava.

  

मोवाच -

Lakshmi \[= मा\] said:

  

मयि माधव ते चित्तं संलग्नं त्वयि मे यथा ।

मया विना कथं जीवेन्माधवो मा विना त्वया ।।४७२।।

O Madhava, your heart is attached to me, as mine is attached to you. How can Mādhava live without me/Lakshmi \[मया = instrumental form of मा, OR अस्मद् \], and how can Lakshmi \[= मा\] live without you?
