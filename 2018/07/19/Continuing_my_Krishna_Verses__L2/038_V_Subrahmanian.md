The verse cited by you, with a variation, is found in the book 'Yoga, Enlightenment and Perfection..', a publication of Sri Vidyatirtha Foundation, as a verse told by HH Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahasvamin of Sringeri to his disciple, HH Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamin during his pre-sannyasa days, who became the successor to the Peetham:


  

दारा इमे मे तनया इमे मे गृहा इमे मे पशवश्च मे मे \|

इत्थं नरो मेषसमानधर्मा मेमेकरः कालवृकेण नीतः \|\|
