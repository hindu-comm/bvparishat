Thank you, Surya Prasad Ji,

  

  I owe this comic streak to my high school Sanskrit teacher Pt. Bhide. Every week he used to teach us some Sanskrit verses, many of them comic or containing some tricky readings, and I still remember many of them. While I had many different teachers in Pune, it was primarily Pt. Bhide who encouraged me to write verses in Sanskrit. He would check them and help me improve them. He did that for many years after I had finished my high school. Ashok Aklujkar is also a student of the same teacher.
