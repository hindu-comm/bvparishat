मधुर: श्वशुरालय:

Sweet home of Father-in-Law

  

प्रीति: श्वशुरजामात्रोर्दुर्लभा जगतीतले ।

न जहीतो यया बद्धौ कदाचन परस्परम् ।।४८३।।

The love between a father-in-law and a son-in-law, bound with which they will not leave each other, is rare in the world.

  

मया \[मा \> मया\] सह हरि: शेते क्षीराब्धौ श्वशुरालये ।

उमयापि महादेवो हिमाद्रौ श्वशुरालये ।।४८४।।

\[However\], Vishnu resides with Lakshmi \[= mā\] on the ocean, the home of his father-in-law. Shiva too resides with Uma on the Himalaya mountain, the home of his father-in-law.

  

महार्णवं परित्यज्य न मा \[ = लक्ष्मी:\] क्वचन गच्छति ।

हिमालयं परित्यज्य नाप्युमा याति कुत्रचित् ।।४८५।।

Lakshmi \[= mā\] does not abandon the ocean and go somewhere else.
\[Similarly\], Uma does not abandon the Himalaya and go somewhere else.
