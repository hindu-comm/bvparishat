Prof Madhav Deshpanday ji,

Humble Pranams.

The Krishna verses have been inspiring me. As Prof JSR Prasad sir mentioned, the following sloka is so nice...

  

चित्रमाचरणे तेषामन्यज्जानामि कारणम् ।

सर्वेषामेव देवानां मत्कुणेभ्यो महद् भयम् ।।४९११।।

  

And the slokas what is mentioned by Prof Prasad ji

(कमले कमला शेते हरश्शते हिमालये ।

क्षीराद्रौ च हरिश्शते मन्ये मत्कुणशङ्कया ।।)

is heard and learnt and our Gurujis use to tell that sloka to make us laugh after a tough grammar or Nyaya class. I could recall those days. Thank you sir.  

  

With humble Pranams,

Dr G Surya Prasad  
Assistant Professor (Education)
