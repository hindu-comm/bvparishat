Namonamah

  

Respected scholars

I am looking for the pramana on the following subject matter

1\.

**"Disciple initiating when his own guru is living"**

There are many historical evidences to support this. I am researching for reference from scriptures(purana.pancharatra agama etc.) which either support or object this practice.

**2.**

**pramana for guru appointing ad-hock initiating person on his behalf when guru himself can not travel due to old age etc.**

  

You can also suggest any book or paper on this subject matter.

  

Many thanks
