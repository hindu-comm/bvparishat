Hare Krishna.  
  
May be it could be made more specific (for point no.1), as I also  
asked the same question before in the forum.  
  
In the Vedic vidhi, upanayanam was given to all dvijas and that was  
considered initiation. So question could be --  
  
Is an acharya allowed to perform upanayana in presence of his own  
acharya still performing upanayana? What is the tradition in all  
vaisnava and sankara sampradayas? Also seek sastric references for the  
same.  
  
We can discuss for pancaratriki vidhi also. But I presume that the  
evidences will be more easily available for vedic vidhi than for  
pancaratriki vidhi, thus we may discuss first for vedic vidhi.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
