Respected Scholars,

Namaste. I have obtained a copy of the manuscript of Abhijnanshakuntalam from PATAN, North Gujarat . It is written for the Jain monk, Shri Guna-saubhagya Suri . So i would like to know the time factor of this Suri. Kindly help me.

( Google search shows the time of Hirvijay ji as 1525- 1556, when Akbar the great was ruling. This Guna Saubhagya Suri may be in guru-shishya parampara of Hir-saubhagy Suri. )

Thanks

Vasantkumar M.Bhatt
