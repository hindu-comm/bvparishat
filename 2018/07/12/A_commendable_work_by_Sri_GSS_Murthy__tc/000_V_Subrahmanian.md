I stumbled on a fine English translation of the Vishnu pAdAdi keshAnta stotram of Shankaracharya by Sri GSS Murthy, who, I am sure is member in this (BVP) forum. He has taken pains to give the anvaya, meanings for each word and also the overall purport in very good language. The work is available here:

My humble pranams to Sri Murthy.
