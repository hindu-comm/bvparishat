Śakti worship is a unique phenomenon in India. It is deified for highly evolved cultural, philosophical and social practices for the ultimate realization of the Atman. The Seminar aims to recognize and revitalize the significances of Śakti worship in Indian cultures and traditions across centuries, and to create a platform for meaningful dialogues and integration between experts, students and wider communities who are interested in this field for further researches and studies.
