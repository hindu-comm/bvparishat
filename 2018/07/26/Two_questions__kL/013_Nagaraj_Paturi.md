The discussion is about the etymology of a certain word s'udra.

  

Let us not get digressed into what we see around us.

  

The varNa descriptions in texts do not often correspond to what we see around us.

  

What we see around is castes. What Sanskrit scriptures talk about is varNa. S'udra is a varNa. It may or may not correspond to any specific cast(s) we see around us.

  

-----------------------------------------------

  

Sculpting /artisan communities, their Brahmin features, M N Srinivas calling that Sanskritisation etc., unnecessarily takes the discussion away from the etymology topic.
