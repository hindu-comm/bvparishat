I am not able to explain the linguistic changes but back to verbal derivative of nouns, could dra in the word be derived from द्राति , द्राति इति गतिकुत्सना, शुष्केण द्राति इति शूद्रः / (द्राति इति गतिकुत्सना -Yāska) . If this is acceptable then perhaps anybody who had a crooked gait was called a शूद्र, originally and so heredity was not involved. Just a random thought.
