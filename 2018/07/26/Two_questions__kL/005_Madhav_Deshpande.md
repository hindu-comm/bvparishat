I just checked Mayrhofer's Etymological Dictionary of Old Indo-Aryan for the word śūdra, and citing the lone occurrence of this word in the R̥gveda, he says:nicht befriedigend erklärt "not satisfactorily explained." So there is no good historical etymology. I don't know if anyone suggested Munda or Dravidian etymologies. Must keep on looking.
