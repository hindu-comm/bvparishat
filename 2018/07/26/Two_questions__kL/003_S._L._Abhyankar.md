This is about शूद्र. There is a कृत्-प्रत्यय र as in वि+इ+र = वीर. /

May I hence guess that शुध्+र = शुध्र / शूद्र => शोधनं करोतीति शूद्रः (?)

If this is a good etymology,शूद्र-s served a very, very important role.

In गीता 18'44 परिचर्यात्मकं कर्म शूद्रस्यापि स्वभावजम् \| To make others and all the localityचर्य pleasant for going around,परिचर्य wholesomely pleasant !

Very noble job !

And there are many professions -

-   the barbers and the tailors certainly make others presentable,
-   the sweepers and gardeners make the garden and the whole environment
    presentable and healthy,
-   the carpenters making the carts, chairs, cupboards make transport,
    seating, storage comfortable.  

परिचर्यात्मकं कर्म!
