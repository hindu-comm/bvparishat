Respected Scholars, Namaskar!

The reason I asked etymology of Shoodra word: One of the three ladies from "Asmat Samskrit' panel from WSC was discussing Shoodra status given to ladies in Hindu religion. From my previous postings on BVP, it is clear that I am not interested in current or the ancient social problems discussed in religious books. My clear cut interest is etymology only of Sanskrit words for the sake of my study of VarNavaada. I am satisfied with answers posted by scholars on this list. N.R.Joshi
