Irrespective of whether the word शूद्र refers to a caste or not, in the present day context, it may not be advisable to analyse the word even for an academic purpose. It may be misconstrued or even misunderstood and so I may suggest that we can stop this discussion in the portals of bvparishad. Such of those who are still interested may continue the discussion at the personal level through individual mail IDs. This is only a suggestion and does not merit arguments and counter arguments. It can simply be ignored also.
