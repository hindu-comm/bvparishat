The traditional nirukti of the word śūdra is given by the ūṇādisūtra:

  

शूद्रः \[शुच्-रक् पृषो˚ चस्य दः दीर्घः Uṇ. 2.19\]

  

However, linguistically it is difficult to accept the change of च् to द्. So, this etymology is not historically valid. The other interesting fact is that the word śūdra occurs only once in the R̥gveda, and has no Indo-European cognates, unlike the word dāsa, which does have cognates in Old-Iranian. This suggests that most likely the word śūdra is a Sanskritized form of some word in a non-Sanskrit local language in North-Western India around the time of the R̥gveda. Beginning with Yāska's Nirukta, there is a school that prefers to derive every word in Sanskrit from a dhātu, and the Uṇādisūtras are also a reflection of this school. But Pāṇini opted for the contrary view that not all nouns in Sanskrit are derivable from verb-roots, and that some are underived (avyutpanna). Historically, this is a more reasonable view, though Yāska's view has had more followers in the subsequent tradition.
