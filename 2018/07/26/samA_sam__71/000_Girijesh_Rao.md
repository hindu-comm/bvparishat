नमो विद्वद्भय :

  

I came across the meaning of the word \[समा, samā\] being weather also in line withArabic/Persian مَوْسِم‎ (mawsim), borrowed in Hindī as मौसम mausam. The source mentions Aitareya Br. , Kauṣ Br., Nirukta as source. I am uploading the screenshot.

However, I could find the usage of this word with meaning as वर्ष varṣa but could not the portions having meaning of this word as 'weather' or 'season'.  
  
Kindly help.

  

Best regards,

Girijesh
