Dear Colleagues,

Might anyone have any details about the journal mentioned in the subject line?

I am looking for a special number of it, published in 1912 with an article byJulius Laber of theV*ajjālagga fame:*V*ajjālaggam: a Prakrita poetical work on rhetoric with Sanskrit version /Fasc. 2*:Calcutta: Asiatic Society 1923.

The title appears in the "Search text contents"of Archive.org, without any entry into the Journal itself. It seems that the Jaina munis Vijaya Dharma Suri and Vijayendra Suri of Shivpuri might have been the editors.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

With many thanks in advance,

Jayandra Soni
