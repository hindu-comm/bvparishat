Namaste,

  

Thank you very much for the reply. It answers my second question. I'll certainly look into it and come back. Any update on the first query ?

  

Since you have answered, I am tempted to ask one more question regarding 9th century Nepālī manuscript of Skanda MP published by Groningen University, Netherlands which is very small compared to extant SMP. Do you have any update on that?

  

Best regards,

  

Girijesh
