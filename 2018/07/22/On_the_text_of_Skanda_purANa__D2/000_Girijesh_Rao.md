विद्वद्भ्यो नमः  

  

Very first instance, I'd like to clarify that I have seen the threads related to Sāttvika, Rājasika and Tāmasika Vibhāga-s of Purāṇa-s here. My question is limited to availability of some Śloka-s quoted inHazari Prashad Diwedi Granthawali-V-1-11, Volume 5, to be found in Skanda Purāṇa.

However, I could not find these in Skanda Mahāpurāṇa.

  

(1) The books mentions a Śloka from Kedāra Khaṇda without giving reference no. as :

  

अष्टादशपुराणेषु दशभिर्गीयते शिव: ।  
चतुर्भिभगवान् ब्रह्मा द्वाभ्यां देवी तथा हरि: ॥

I could not find this. Instead, I could find this only:

  

अष्टादशपुराणेषु गीयते वै परःशिवः॥

तस्माच्छिवस्य माहात्म्यं वक्तुं कोऽपि न पार्यते॥ १.१३ ॥



Is the previous Śloka in Skanada? If yes, kindly provide ref. no.

  

2\. The same articles mentions Śivarahasyakhaṇḍa and Sambhava Kāṇḍa in Skanda MP. and provides some Śloka-s (image attached). I could neither find Śivarahasyakhaṇḍa/ Sambhava Kāṇḍa, nor the Śloka-s.

  

Kindly provide publication details or ref. no. of the version of Skanda MP, containing Śivarahasyakhaṇḍa/ Sambhava Kāṇḍa and the Śloka-s.

  

धन्यवाद,
