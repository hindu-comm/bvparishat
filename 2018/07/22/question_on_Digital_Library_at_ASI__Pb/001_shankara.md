Harindranathji,

  

Though there is no mirror site of ASI collection, almost all books from this collection are now available at [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

The following link has around 200 Sanskrit books from ASI collection. Rest of the books are scattered all over at [archive.org](http://archive.org).

<https://archive.org/details/TFIC_ASI_Books>  

  

regards  
shankara
