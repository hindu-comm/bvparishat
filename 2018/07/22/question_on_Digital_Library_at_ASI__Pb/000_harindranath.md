ASI used to host a wonderful collection of scanned books at their web site.

I can no longer locate it at there..  

If it is still available somewhere else, please let me know.

I was able to find two among them, namely, Mahabharata with Nilakantha commentary published in 1901 and the original Kumbhakonam edition of Mbh at  

Internet Archive.

  

May be the rest are available there?

  

Thanks  

Harindranath
