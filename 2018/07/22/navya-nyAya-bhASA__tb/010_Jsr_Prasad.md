While you contact Prof. Madhusudan Pennaji and join for the workshop, you may be interested to watch a couple of lectures on line, on नव्यन्यायशैली/भाषा:

  

\- TARKSHYA project by Vedavaridhi Dr. P. Ramanujan (in Sanskrit)  

\- Navya Nyaya paathaaH by Prof. M.A. Alwar (youtube - in Sanskrit)

\- Technical Terms in Navya Nyaya by Prof. Sacchidananda Mishra (youtube)

  

All the above scholars are members of our forum.  

  

I do hope, you must be aware of the books by Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi (Knowledge Representation: Navya Nyaya and Conceptual Graphs) and Prof. Tirumala Kulkarni (The Language of Logic: Navya Nyaya Perspectives).  

  

Best
