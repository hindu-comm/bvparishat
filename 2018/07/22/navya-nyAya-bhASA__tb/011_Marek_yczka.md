Dear  
Jsr Prasadji

please could you link here these two:

  
- TARKSHYA project by Vedavaridhi Dr. P. Ramanujan (in Sanskrit)  

\- Navya Nyaya paathaaH by Prof. M.A. Alwar (youtube - in Sanskrit)

I couldn't find the sacond and about the first I am not sure is it only about 10 min. lecture?

  

Prof. Sacchidananda Mishra ji I know in person. He is so kind to talk
with me many times . Now I am going to visit him in Varanasi again. The two books you have mentioned I know well but looking for a soft copy of a recent paper of Prof. Amba Kulkarni: " Later Nyāya Logic: Computational Aspects" in:Handbook of Logical Thought in India pp 1-23 \|<https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-81-322-1812-8_12-1> Any chance to get a kind copy from the Author?  

  

Kind regards,

Marek
