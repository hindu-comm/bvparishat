OM!

Dear eminent scholars and all members of the group,

thanks a lot for your response. I am staying in touch with Prof. V.N. Jha-sir for many years now and as he wrote above the Foundation Course in Navya Nyaya has been shifted from Sep. to March 17 -28, 2019 at Aurobindo Ashram, Ramgarh, Nainital. This is the reason why I am looking for another one now, I mean in Sep/Oct.

Thank you also for links to a work of Maheśa Chandra Nyayaratna. It is so kind of you. But when I asked about navya-nyAya-bhASA I have meant not only this work but navya-nyAya technics and methods of explanation (pariSkAra),so it is navya-nyAya language (jargon) in general. That's why I am interested in any kind of workshop, course or personal training in that logico-linguistic area..

Sri Srinivasa ji, I will email your colleague Prof. Madhusudana Penna
to get more details...Thank you and hope see you soon :-)

  

Ps. A propos Maheśa Chandra Nyayaratna's navya-nyAya-bhASA-pradIpaH I have 3 questions:

\[1\] Does anyone here have access to edition and translation done byEberhard Guhe from 2014 (The full title: Maheśa Chandra Nyāyaratna’s “Brief Notes on the Modern Nyāya System of Philosophy and its Technical Terms”, Shanghai: Fudan University Press)?

\[2\] As far as I know there are 4 editions and translations done till now: a)Kālīpada Tarkācārya (1956/1973),b)Ujwalla Jha (2004/2010), c) Ramesh Chandra Das (2006), and c)EberhardGuhe (2014). Did I miss something?

\[3\] The original work was published in 1891? 1892? in Calcutta and bothKrishna Chakraborty Ganguly and LateKamaleswar Bhattacharyaclaim that that work as a paper wasread at the 9th International Congress of Orientalists 1891 (London?). Is is right? I am asking because I couldn't find any record about that in Post-congressproceedings...

  

Warm regards to you all,

Marek
