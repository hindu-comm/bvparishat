Dear Sri Marek,

  

You may contact eminent Nyaya scholar, Prof. V.N. Jha Ji, he's a member of this forum. He has been conducting workshops in Nyaya/Indian Intellectual Traditions, for the past 18 years. Coming September, he will be going to organize a workshop, I understood. I believe, 'Navya Nyaya Bhasha Pradeepa' would be one of the reading materials.  

  

Best wishes,

Prasad
