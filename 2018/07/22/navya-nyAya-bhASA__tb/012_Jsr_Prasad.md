it must be easy for one to navigate through the hyper links available in the left panel.

(thanks to Dr. Ramanujan ji for sharing this link in BVP)  

  

And here is the link to the first lesson of second reference -

As much as I could see, you may follow suggestions by you tube to get remaining 40+ lectures.  

I vaguely recall, seeing some audio recordings on Nyaya, in the [archive.org](http://archive.org) website.  

  

Prof. Amba Kulkarni ji, is a member of this forum. Indeed, I am not aware of the paper that you referred to. I think, you can certainly write her about your requirement.  

  

Best wishes,

Prasad
