Regarding Interest in navya-nyaya for \< navya-nyAya technics and methods of explanation (pariSkAra),so …. >





**Observation 1**: Classical text and teaching of ‘ Navya- Nyaya’
as ‘Darshana/ Parishkaara’ is aimed at ‘ Padaartha – Dharma Jnana’/ Moksha goal. The total acquaintance and grasp over ‘language of Gods’ (devabhaashaa) and ‘pramANa- paribhashaa - paddhati’ ( Not easily translatable) - is a critical need and integral part of such exploration. I am not even touching the vyanjanaa of kaavya / and accent of Vedas !



 A narrowed focus on ‘ logic’ sans ‘ precision and excellence of linguistic expression for analytics, provided in Panini system’ will not take the student towards the desired goal.



How would anglicized expression translate the subtle / or / absurd
difference between the \< logico-linguistic> sentence : पर्वतो वह्निमान् धूमात्, ( न धूमेन) which translation can not easily point to.







**Observation 2**: If one were also to look at the ‘ Nyaayas’ ( common sense laws; accepted conventions to derive the proof) used in the
technical analysis, or extend the navya-nyaya to meemaamsaa texts, the outcome will be disastrous.



How are the course instructors taking care to address and highlight these issues in the introductory programs ? pl.
