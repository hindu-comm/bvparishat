Dear All,

  

I was looking for videos of the recently concluded 17th World Sanskrit Conference at Vancouver, BC, hosted by the UBC Department of Asian Studies. There are a few scattered videos on youtube. But none of the plenary sessions and other important speeches. Does anybody have any idea where they may be found? Please share some of the videos, as a a matter of general interest.

  

The weekly Sanskrit magazine of Doordarshan did cover it at some length. It has many clips of popular interest. Here's the link to the telecast. The coverage starts around 6:45 - includes a clip of Prof Aklujkar rendering a Urdu couplet into Sanskrit.

Enjoy,

  

Srini
