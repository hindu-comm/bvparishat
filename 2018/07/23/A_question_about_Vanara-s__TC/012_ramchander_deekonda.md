Vidvan Subramaniamji,

  

It is well known to all Ramayana readers that Valmiki tells us that Vaanaras had tails and exhibited all the characteristics of monkeys. There is no dispute regarding the Tail and their monkish behavior. I,as a non-specialist, think that the word Vaanara could be from this phrase nara-vA-nara. Human or/tailed-human. The vaa maybe the shortened form of Vaala, tail. Hence it could mean humanlike beings with vaala (tail)

  

Please forgive me for my understanding.

  

Regards,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
