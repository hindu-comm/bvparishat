\>How could the '***early form of man***' could undergo the study of 3 veda-s (Rg, yajur & sAma) and 9 grammars

  

Exactly, there is no evidence or proof for monkeys being the early form of man. After all Darwin's theory of evolution is utter non-sense as told by Brahmasri.Sengalipuram Damodara dikshitar in one of his upanyasams.

Punch " darwins theory is nonsense" in google, it seems he himself accepted but we are taught the same stuff.

It is time to change our system of present Macualy form of education and switch back to our traditional system which has firm roots in sastras, vedas and samskriti
