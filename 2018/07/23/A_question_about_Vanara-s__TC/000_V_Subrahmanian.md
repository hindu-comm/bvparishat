In this Wikipedia page there is information about Vanara-s:

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanara>  

  

  

Is there any reference in Ramayana or other texts about Hanuman walking on four legs? Are Vanara-s really entities who were like humans, walking on two legs? There is a description in the Ramayana of vanara-s devastating a forest on their way back along with Hauman after locating Sita. Was their behaviour akin to monkeys? Is there any reference to this species in the Vedas?
