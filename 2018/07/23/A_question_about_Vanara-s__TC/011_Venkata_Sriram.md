In the words of ShrI.T.Sundarachariar :

  

...........................

Valmiki seems to have been a pen-name. The story of his having been a robber is quite 'apocryphal' and 'deserves to be rejected'. If he had been abandoned by his parents early and had taken to the life of highwayman, when did he acquire all the learning & mastery of language to which rAmAyaNa bears the witness ? The name certainly enshrines the fact that he was regarded as a great yogi who could forget the world for a long periods of time. The great Vedanta Desikan interprets the term 'vAlmIki' very differently. According to him, 'valmIka' is NOT an ant-hill, but ear of earth deity. And he relied upon a vedic passage in support of his view

  

श्रोत्रं ह्येतत् पृथिव्या यद्वल्मीकः  

  

The term 'vAlmIki' would mean one born of the ear of the Earth. Born thus, he has the 'audition par-excellence'. He hears all the tones & notes of the earth's experience and is able to render them into immortal poetry. The ear, even more than the eye, is accordingly to Vedanta Desikan, is the secret of the true poet.

The above interpretation appealed my intellect.
