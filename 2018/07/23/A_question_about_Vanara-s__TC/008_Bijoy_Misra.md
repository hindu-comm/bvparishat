My preliminary take on Hanuman

<https://www.dwarkamai.com/vidyapeeth/articles/136-reflections-on-valmiki-ramayana-xxi-hanumans-search-of-sita-in-lanka>  

i would considervānara an early form of man with strong legs to travel by hops. Animals with large sacs can be imagined to change shape.

The description byvālmīki does not look to me totally out of order.
