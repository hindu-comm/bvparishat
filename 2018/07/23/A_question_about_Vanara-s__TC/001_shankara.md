Subbuji,

  

Scholars are of varying opinions regarding the Vanaras of the Ramyana. HD Sankalia in his 'Ramayana in Historical perspective' (page 71), considers Vanaras to be ordinary human beings who lived in the Vindhya hills and forests. Link to relevant page is given below.

There is also a long article on the Vanara race by MN Ray published in Saraswati Bhavana Studies vol 5, page 19-73.

Attaching pdf of 'Vanaras in the Ramayana Age' by SN Vyas extracted from Modern Review 1966. He too considers Vanaras were as much a human tribe as any other.

shankara
