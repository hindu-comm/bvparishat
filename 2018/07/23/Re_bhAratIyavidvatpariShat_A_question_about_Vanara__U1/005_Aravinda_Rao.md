The etymology for vaanara is 'naro vaa iti vaanaraH' - meaning 'is he a human? Such a doubt is said to arise on seeing them. So they appear to be some type of humanoids, following the Vedic culture. We know that in Valmiki's Ramayana Rama too complements Hanuman for his erudition in the Vedas. When Vali dies, the funeral ceremonies take place as per the Vedic culture. Again during Sugriva's coronation similar rituals are followed and even Brahmins are engaged. BUT ironically Rama justifies killing Vali on the ground that it is proper to kill a shaakhaa-mriga even in a stealthy way.

Ramayana is too complex.  

  

It appears proper to assume the vaanaras to be some ancient tribe, powerfully built and fairly civilized.

Kumbhakarna's words are illustrative of his dismissive attitude to them.
