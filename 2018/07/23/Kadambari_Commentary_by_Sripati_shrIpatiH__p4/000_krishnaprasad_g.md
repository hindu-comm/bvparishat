Dear all

  

I want to know the details (Mss, or published whereabouts) of commentary by Sripati, on Kadambari.

  

I found this name referred bySri Haridasa Siddhanta Vagisha onKadambari Purvabhaga By Mahakavi Sri Banabhata.

  

Why am I searching ?

To Publish the work because

Sripati's commentary seems to be more rational than Bahnuchandra

  

  

For instance in Kadambari

भगवतो नारायणस्यानुकरोति

Here Bahnuchandra says the genetive case ending according to कृञः प्रतियत्ने which is very far from the context. Where as Sripati says संबन्धसामान्ये षष्ठी otherwise which actually had taken accusative

  

Thanks

Krishna Prasad
