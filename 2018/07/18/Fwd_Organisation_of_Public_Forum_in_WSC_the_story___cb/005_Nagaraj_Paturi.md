Respected Prof. Varakhedi,

  

Glad to see your post on BVP after a long gap.

  

----------------------------

  

Let me just share the facts with regard to the issue of "political" ; the difference between our perception and perception in the west with regard to the same.

  

We in India here have this strong attitude of avoiding "political" in academic discussions.

  

But is it not a fact that the books and articles of Prof. Sheldon Pollock such as his "Death of Sanskrit", his articles on Ramayana, all begin with the direct mention of the name of a political party called BJP? Is this looked at as a bad feature of his academic output in that country? No. Moreover, this is looked at as a very good feature of his academic output there. This is looked at as his ability to bring/prove contemporary use/relevance to Humanities in general and Indology/Sanskrit Studies/South Asian Studies in particular.

  

There was a recent discussion on this forum about the lowest place to Humanities in the value/status hierarchy of contemporary social order. It is not India-specific. We have it world over. In US too funding for Humanities in general and Indology/Sanskrit Studies/South Asian Studies in particular is drastically decreasing. Every time a new alarm is raised about the crisis of funding toIndology/Sanskrit Studies/South Asian Studies, academicians in the field advocate for not reducing funds on the basis of the argument that 1. India is politically important for US 2. understanding India's past can help understand contemporary Indian society and politics.This is the reason , they mention names of Indian political parties in their 'academic ' articles without any iota of hesitation. Moreover such a blatant discussion of politics is what is considered to be bringing great value and relevance to their academic writing.

  

There is another use of the word "political" in the current academic particularly university academic discourse. It is the influence of post-modern studies, Cultural Studies etc. which are the 'latest' and fashionable in the university Social Sciences and Humanities academic circles. Here "political" is not limited to electoral party politics. It is the 'power' relationships at family level , say, for example, between husband and wife, or gender-based power relationships at various societal levels etc. Prof. Sheldon Pollock's literature borrows words and concepts profusely from this literature.

  

As such discussing "politics" in academics is not as bad an idea for the western universities, Humanities departments of JNUs and HCUs as it is for Sanskrit scholars without such a background of the western academics or the background of theHumanities departments of JNUs and HCUs.

  

This post by me probably helps many members of the forum get an answer to their frequent question " what is the benefit to the western academicians from doing "politics" about Sanskrit, India, Indian culture etc.

  

As such our suggestion not to discuss "politics" in academic forums not only seems out of date but even laughable to them.

  

Just wanted to explain the 'intriguing' 'obstinacy' on their part in not stopping to discuss "politics" in academic forums.
