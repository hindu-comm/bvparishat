Namaste  

I was searching the web and looking for the video upload of the eventअस्मत्संस्कृतम् at WSC so that the discussion that happened can be heard and directly critiqued upon.

  

But it was not found. But what I found was very interesting. Neither the title or the discourse is new. There is a 2014 Article by Ananya Vajpayee in the Same topic in the Hindu.

**The Story of My Sanskrit - <https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-story-of-my-sanskrit/article6321759.ece>**

  

**Also I found a recent youtube interview by one of theWSC panelist Dr.Kaushal Panwar - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO2lVLv5ong>**  

  

As I was present in the WSC conference this time and listened to the अस्मत्संस्कृतम् panel discussion in person, I can state that the script remains unchanged.  

  

regards

Jayaraman
