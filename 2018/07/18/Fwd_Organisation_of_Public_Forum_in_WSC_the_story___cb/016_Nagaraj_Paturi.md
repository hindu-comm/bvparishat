>There is a 2014 Article by Ananya Vajpayee in the Same topic in the Hindu.**The Story of My Sanskrit -<https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-story-of-my-sanskrit/article6321759.ece>**

  

---- This article was discussed on BVP immediately after its publication during 2014 itself.

  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

The title of the article, "The Story of My Sanskrit" is a copy of an older article which as an extract from the autobiography of Kumud Pawde called Antasphot. This article of Smt Kumud Pawde-ji has drawn significant attention in " Dalit Feminist studies".

  

Smt Kumud Pawde-ji's difficulties as mentioned by her are rooted in her social conditions of being born into a community that was treated as untouchable, associated poverty etc.

  

For Ananya Vajpeyi , there are no such problems.

  

" Seeing the name of Prof. Kapil Kapoor took me back to my days as an M.A. student in English and Linguistics at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Prof. Kapoor first introduced me and my classmates to traditions of literature, language philosophy, literary analysis, poetics, semiotics, grammar and aesthetics in Sanskrit."

  

" But encounters with other scholars like the philosopher Arindam Chakrabarti, the Panini expert George Cardona, and the Sanskritist, and eventually my doctoral supervisor, Sheldon Pollock made me decide to pursue more seriously the path that I had glimpsed in Prof. Kapoor’s classroom: I took up the study of Sanskrit for real. "

  

She had the opportunity to all these encounters.

  

" At Oxford, I wrote an M.Phil thesis about how the study of Sanskrit had shaped the ideas of Ferdinand de Saussure, the father of modern linguistics in Europe."

  

(She had the opportunity to do MPhil at Oxford). This topic shows that she was during that stage still in the path inspired by Prof. Kapil Kapoor. )

  

She all of a sudden realises " the sheer wall of prejudice that blocked the access of someone like me to the particular aspects of the history, ideology and politics of Sanskrit that I was interested in. "

  

What is the wall of prejudice?

  

"female, a north Indian in south India, a student enrolled at a foreign university, a Hindi-speaker, and only tenuously and dubiously of a caste that pandits considered acceptable."

  

a north Indian in south India! Did anyone face any such north Indian -south Indian problem in Sanskrit studies?  

  

a student enrolled at a foreign university! I have seen how people offer red carpet to scholars for this reason.



a Hindi-speaker! Did you ever notice any such prejudice?  

  

Caste, she mentions her being from Brahmin caste here and there is no scope for prejudice here as she herself admits.

  

None of the reasons for the wall of prejudice except 'female' have any semblance of being true.

  

Regarding 'female', she selectively mentions one scholar who said"that only “perverted women” became scholars". This statement , if true, shows that the scholar himself was a big pervert. But interesting thing is that she had several months of readings with him.There is no wall of prejudice here too. If there was , several months of reading would not have happened.  
This perverted comment is not a typical or representative behaviour of Sanskrit scholars towards their women students.

  

" They were bitter and resentful, and the occasional interloper like me — that too someone with an obviously critical agenda — had to face the brunt of their frustration. " She masks the negativity in her agenda with the word " critical". So, here lies the secret of what she wants to blame on a non-existing wall of prejudice. ***It is this negativity in her agenda, that probably created problems for her.***No wall of prejudice, no discrimination on gender-basis. While identifying that traditional scholarship is facing problems during modern times, in stead of identifying the true causes of it sympathetically she deliberately misdiagnoses it and consciously misdirects her readers by tracing it to " demeaned by democratic politics and secular public life that stigmatised their orthodox beliefs, threatened by gender equality that resisted the patriarchy inherent in their practices".

  

People are giving the name Paushpee Paddhati to a certain method of teaching Sanskrit/AshTaadhyaayee just after the name of a woman's scholar.

  

There have been a considerably big number of women Sanskrit scholars at all levels and activities.

  

OK. Where are the difficulties comparable to those described by Smt Kumud Pawde here?

  

Then why that title?

  

Agenda!

  

She already made it clear.

  

The agenda of maligning Sanskrit, traditional Sanskrit scholarship, her akshraabhyaasaka upanetaa and foundational guru Prof. Kapil Kapoor, S'aastras, India and Indian nationalist politics and of acquiring sympathy by imitating the title of a woman author who could have faced real difficulties.
