Namaste



You have raised the right questions.



The crux of the issue is the emerging new phenomenon in India / Languages / Sanskrit studies - ‘ noted as **‘ infect the political body with a political agenda ( for Languages) ’.**

****

**This** is a result of multiple level failures:

 (i) Institutional failures to stay by the dictum of tradition for Samskruth language studies

And

 (ii) Scholars making conscious choice to use –substitute alternatives in studies using the umbrella term ‘academic freedom’ !



 The traditional schools have a term for this outcome : **‘
vaanee -** ***dur-vyaakhyaa – visha - moorchanaa***’ ( borrowing Mallinathas terms). Language studies in stupor by poisoning standards of Scholar ship which affects text-interpretation.



**What could be the plausible diagnosis for this scenario ?**



a) Traditional schools not addressing properly and taking action to set right the ‘ **political interpretation of Indian literature’**

 - The records of oriental conferences bear enough evidence for this ‘ ahimsaa - tolerance’ of ‘ political interpretation of Samskruth based Literature at India’.

 The monumental example of such tolerance of ‘political interpretation with an overcoat of Religion and Theology’ is seen in Ramayana and Mahabharata studies.

 This ‘ political interpretation of Indian Literature’ is at the root of Society divide in India, politically labelled as ‘Dalit groups’ !



b) Why **people feel free to pursue such interpretation in their own campus** ?



 - Because the docile nature of the ‘ Traditional teams’ did not get in to from action in defending the ‘ sacredness and purity of languages of texts’ ! It is not ordinary people who do such ‘ free interpretation’ .

 It is the agenda driven, academic scholar desiring a benefit who makes such ‘ interpretation sandwiches in the name of research’. 



 To address such social aberration, the traditional scholars went on ‘ Paanditya lane’ to find a ‘ linguistic explanation to justify the same text interpretation by use of language modeling as
‘polysemy – multivalent meaning terms –Abudiga language’ et al, in linguistics parlor. With the sole goal to defend , justify, consolidate a plurality of view points and hold together the ‘ Tradition’ ! Language ( Vak/ Bhashaa) which was designed to lead to ‘ (Shabda) Brahma –Darshana’ was used differently ! The oriental scholar using the western linguistic methods found this difficult to justify intellectually , logically and with manuscript evidence !



 **The question to contemplate here, would be** : Why did traditional schools forget to defend the Samskruth Language position using the anchor of six binging disciplines ( Saanga- Shadanga) and several application –usage disciplines ( Upa-Veda- Shaastra – Vdyaa)
and clarity on ‘Shaastra – Kaavya- Vyavahara’ usage ; and arrest the Samskruth language decay to allow ‘ free interpretations’ ? even on their own campuses ? A-Shaastreeyataa became the foundation for ‘language corruption’ and consequent downfall of culture, Identity and inviting the suffering.



 **The answer rests in the Socio-political dynamic history and leadership transforming Colonial Bharath to Independent resurgent India** where ‘Political interpretation of Indian literature -Sanatana Dharma Documents in Samskrutham’, has been free to be interpreted by all and sundry , especially Media for entertainment and social outreach/ TRP ratings/ Political aspirations at Nations level.



The million dollar question is : What would India studies be for beyond India in such a scenario, where ‘ political interpretation of Indian literature’ is the roadmap to explore India as land of emerging economy in this side of the continent?



What is traditional schools answer beyond the ‘ Sanskrit and Yoga at Mandir’ ?
