Dear friends,

I wanted to share this observation.

In the west Sanskrit is viewed as a dead language and as an archaeological tool

to calibrate the past.. There no understanding or respect to the Sanskrit sounds.

Sanskrit is converted to another language for interpretation. This translation is

inherently flawed because of faulty mapping and the built-in cultural bias..

Back in India, Sanskrit is used as a tool for religious practice.
Because of the latter

there is verbatim adherence leading to dogmatic conservatism. The complexity of

appreciating a world of sounds reduces to a world of mechanical words.
That Sanskrit

is the natural scientific expression of the human voice is lost in the slogans.

To investigate and appreciate the construction of sound in human voice should be

the new goal in Sanskrit studies. It is not the examination of the past, but it is the

investigation that human voice is a biological evolution and has the capacity to

render information in translating thoughts. Though it is hard, it is as interesting as

any field of advanced research. Its beauty lies in its cosmology. 

I would invite new researchers to get into these areas of research.
Funding will

show up once we show promise of work.

Best regards,

BM
