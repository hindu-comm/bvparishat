Dear Sri Jayaraman,

  

Thank you for the post. I am just wondering if these people only talk about the perceived wrongs perpetrated upon them and the shortcomings they see in India, Indian religion and Indian society or if they also advance a solution, a balanced, equitable solution to the problems they seem to have identified.

  

Criticizing is easy, giving a proper solution is hard. if somebody is only criticizing and not solving, then their motives are suspect.

  

So far, I have yet to see any proper solution coming from these types.
