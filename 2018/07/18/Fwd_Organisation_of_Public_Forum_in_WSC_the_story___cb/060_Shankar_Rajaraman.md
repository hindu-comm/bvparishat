According to Truschke, the only way Gangadevi characterizes the Sultanate or the Muslim people as different is through their use of the Persian language.

However, at least twice in the same canto, there is a description of the द्विजs being chained and imprisoned. (द्विजशृङ्खलिकाखलात्क्रियाभिः कुरुते राजपथः स्वकर्णशूलम्; द्विजबन्दीनयनाम्बुदूषितानि). I don't think such a description figures in the context of Hindu kings. Champaraja is not described as tormenting the द्विजs.
