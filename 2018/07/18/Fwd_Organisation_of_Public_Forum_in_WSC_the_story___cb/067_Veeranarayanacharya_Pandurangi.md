My own family in the year 1590, led by Narasimhacharya fled from punatambe on the banks of godavari in the present day Ahmed Nagar district to save itself from the Muslim invasion.

I quote my own work "history of Pandurangi family"

  

"There was a Muslim invasion of Punyastambhapura. This is recorded in Rashtraudhavamshamahakavya. Narasimhacharya (later became Vidyadheeshatirtha Svamiji of uttaradiMatha) (along with Anandabhattaraka?) had to flee that town with his family and disciples. He went to Nasika Tryambaka and lived there for two years. Later Dattapandita the son of Naganatha invited him to Sangamner and Paithan. This Naganatha Dattapandita was a subedar at Paithan under Shahaji the father of Shivaji. He later became the subedar of Bangalore."

  

This Muslim seems to beShahzada Murad Mirza(8 June 1570 – 12 May 1599) son of Akbar. He seems to have attacked Punatambe around 1590 or 1595 when on the orders of Akbar he attacked Ahmednagar. He was the governor of Deccan for some time. प्रतापशाहक्षितिपेन सार्धं ततः परं शाहमुरादवीरः। खेटानि मार्गे परिलुण्ठ्य पुण्यस्तम्भाभिधानं नगरं समेतः।। प्रतापशाहक्षितिपालसिंहस्तत्रापि गोदासलिले निमज्य। भूदेवतेभ्यो बहुदत्तवित्तो विश्वेश्वरं प्रीणयति स्म भक्त्या।। अथ प्रवृत्तेषु पुरस्य पुण्यस्तम्भस्य दाहाय महारथेषु। प्रतापशाहः करुणार्द्रचित्तो न्यवारयत्तान् विविधैरुपायैः।। अनेकभूदेवनिकेतनानां संरक्षणं यत्कृतमादरेण। गङ्गावतीसूनुरगादुदारं तेन ध्रुवं मन्दिरदानधर्मम्।। पलायिताशेषजनं पुरं तद्भटास्तदा हन्त हठादलुण्ठन्। प्रतापशाहः प्रचुरप्रतापो न चाहरत्तैर्थिकमर्थलेशम्।। 20. 44-48. राष्ट्रौढवंशमहाकाव्यम्.

  

राष्ट्रौढवंशमहाकाव्यम् is published by baroda.

  

“Rastraudha vamsa kavya” was published by Janardan Sakharam Kudalkar, M. A., LL. B., Curator of State Libraries, Baroda, for the Baroda Government, and Printed by Bamchandra Yeau Shedge, at the ‘Nirnaya-Sagara’ Press, 23, Kolbhat Lane, Bombay in 1917. It was English version of Original work in Sanskrit 1518 (1596 A. D. )"

  

Thus we are now in Karnataka. Who can deny the destruction of punatambe a city of learne? Even Bhattoji dikshita is said to belong to punatambe before migration to Varanasi.
