Truschke in the Scroll article says people and communities were not often defined by the god(s) they worshipped. चन्द्रशेखर in his सुर्जनचरितमहाकाव्य (which is one of the works she consults) calls the यवनs सुरद्विषः क्रव्यभुजः (hating the devatas and eating raw flesh, 5.1). Isn't this identification as सुरद्विट् based on the gods they don't respect?
