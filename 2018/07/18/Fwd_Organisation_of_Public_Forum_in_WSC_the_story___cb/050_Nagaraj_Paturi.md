\> Another point to be condemned is the use of the term Brahminical (texts)

  

---------------------------------------------------------------

  

\>We must send memorandum to WSC to ban the term in its deliberations.

  

---- Dr.S.Ramaratnam

We can not ask for the ban of the term. We can only ask for the ban of its use in the contemporary divisive political sense.

Because

  

We had

  

Brahmanism

*noun*

1.  

    

    

    

    

    the complex sacrificial religion that emerged in post-Vedic India
    (*c.*900 BC) under the influence of the dominant priesthood
    (Brahmans), an early stage in the development of Hinduism.

## Brahmanical

    Of or belonging to the highest Hindu caste, originally that of the
    priesthood.

# Brahmanical Hinduism

David Fowler

  

Brahmanical Hinduism represents the elite, lettered, and Pan-Indian religious culture of the Sanskrit language that bases its religious authority on the Vedas (“knowledge”)—a body of revealed Sanskrit scripture—as well as the authority of those who preserve such scripture—the Brahman priesthood. Nevertheless, the term*Brahmanical Hinduismis a scholarly construct *and is/was not the label of a self-described group of religious practitioners either now or in India's ancient past. Rather, the term is a convenient scholarly label for a collection of religious ideas, extrapolated by scholars, from a body of Indian religious and socio-normative texts(Highlighting mine)  

  

---------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Indian scholars should have been protesting the terms right from the time of their coinage and use during the colonial, orientalist days. Now these absurd terms have come to stay through prolonged use.
