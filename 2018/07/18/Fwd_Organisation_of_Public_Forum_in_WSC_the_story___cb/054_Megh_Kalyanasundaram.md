@\~27:47-29:04 “…Hindu dynasties, you know, decimate Muslim ones and vice versa. **And, one sort of thing I do throughout the book is I grapple with this, this violence, and the literary use of it.** Because Ganga Devi, like any good Sanskrit poet, she celebrates and praises gore on the battlefield, right, and if you are not familiar with, with Sanskrit poetry concerning battles, right, you need a real strong stomach to read this stuff. There is, you know, there is corpses all over the place, there is rivers of blood, there, you know, headless corpses wandering around, sort of tripping over dead bodies, right, it is pretty intense stuff. **And this was poetry {pause) seemingly for emphasis)}, in Sanskrit**. So in other words, Ganga Devi, she treated the annihilation of a dynasty, and a mass amount of death, to be fodder for beautiful literature. **I argue in the book that this praise of violence—both against Muslim-led dynasties and enacted by them—is actually a strategy of inclusion.** **And so it is not about making them out to be particularly violent, it is about including them, as, more or less like other Indian kings**. **And this is because in Sanskrit literature you praise a King, in part, by saying that he is quite violent, right, this was a praise, it was a good thing.”**{Transcribed as heard; almost verbatim if not fully so; Emphasis added}

In a talk about a book concerned with texts (many Sanskrit ones) from the period c. 1190-1720, one also got to see a reference to 17th World Sanskrit Conference (image 1 below) and Twitter Jack's "Smash Brahminical Patriarchy" (image 2 below).

  

Dr. Truschke can be heard saying:

  

(@\~17:15) : "The conference in July of 2018 featured sexist treatment of female speakers and straight-up heckling of a Dalit Sanskrit scholar by upper-caste scholars. The conference also hosted a BJP politician. **This is indicative of the World Sanskrit Conference's intellectually compromising and totally inappropriate links with the Hindu right-wing.**" {Transcribed as heard; almost verbatim if not fully so; Emphasis added}

  

(@\~42:36): "...**Smash Brahminical Patriarchy is essentially a human-rights slogan**..." {Transcribed as heard; almost verbatim if not fully so; Emphasis added}

PS: This post should be seen for what it is: it contains, as should be obvious, a link to a video and what I heard Dr. Truschke say in that video, with some emphasis (bold) added. The reason for posting it in this thread should be obvious to at least some.
