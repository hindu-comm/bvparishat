4\. Vikram Zutshi, March 12 2021, The Hindu:*[The curious case of controversial historian Audrey Truschke](https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-curious-case-of-controversial-historian-audrey-truschke/article34050315.ece/amp/?__twitter_impression=true).* Some excerpts below:

  

> 
> > "In one tweet, Truschke referred to Rama as a “misogynist” and used a > slur after the word. When asked to justify this claim, she cited a > translation of the Ramayana by Robert Goldman. When Prof. Goldman was > contacted, he said: “I find it extremely disturbing but perhaps not > unexpected to learn that AT (Audrey Trushcke) has used such > inappropriate language and passed it off as coming from Valmiki. > Neither the great poet nor we used such a vulgar diction and certainly > Sita would never have used such language to her husband even in the > midst of emotional distress. Nowhere in our translation of the passage > do we use words you mention AT as using… she is in no way quoting our > translation but giving her own reading of the passage in her own > highly inappropriate language.” >
