Am extremely sorry for my very delayed response.

Certain preoccupations, and more particularly a spasm that I suffered,

disabled my normal functioning for quite some time.

  

I fully endorse the views of Prof. Varakhedi, as I was fully present for the torturous and degrading session showcased at WSC.

The session seemed all belabouring to cry hoarse that ours ("*asmat"-samskrtam*) has always been a horrendous civilisation.

One rarely witnesses such taking pride in self-flagellation, in one's earnestness in washing one's dirty linen in public.

  

It is evidently a pastime with some to engage in mud-slinging about India,

and that academics, pathetically Indians themselves, too indulge in this does not bespeak highly of them.

While one need not turn a blind eye to the faultlines in one's own heritage,

to disparage the same with great gusto, coupled with ensuring that there will be absolutely no provision

for presenting other sides of the issue thus espoused, is, to say the least, very cheap and demeaning.

It smacked, without doubt, of political overtones - inflicted via subterfuge rather than through plainspeaking.

  

Prof. Varakhedi's essential point should be, I feel, given serious consideration in the future conferences.

  

There is also the issue, to be noted alongside, of the utter unconcern of the organisers

in regard to helping scholars out with assistance/guidance in procuring the visa for attending the conference.

  

Yet another serious lapse on the part of the organisers was that

pretty long before there were any tidings of the visa provided/denied,

the last date for the cancellation of the registration was announced loudly - and implemented ruthlessly.

Undoubtedly many have been inconvenienced and suffered a loss - for no fault of theirs whatsoever.

Some may have even resolved never to attend a conference abroad in future.

  

As if all this was not sufficient, the indifference and inaction of the Canadian Embassy was, to say the least, deplorable.

To suspect scholars - endeavouring to attend a conference - of seeking to overstay or never to return

is adding insult to injury.

  

(And it attains ludicrous dimensions - to see a nation going all out to suspect and prevent Indian scholars

seeking to present their papers in a Sanskrit conference,

as against refugees from other countries, who have even established their nuisance value all over, time and again,

being welcomed with open arms.)
