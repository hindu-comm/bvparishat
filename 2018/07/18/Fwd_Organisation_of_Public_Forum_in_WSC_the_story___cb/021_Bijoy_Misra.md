Dr. BVK,

  

You have analyzed the points very well. I cannot comment on the gurukula style of training

since I didn't undergo one. I think the appreciation of sounds are important and necessary.

The discovery or the education that the sounds are constituted of varṇa compounding is

another matter. i do not know if this is done as discovery or as instruction. In the original

model of gurukula it possibly did not matter since thevarṇa dissection need not be a part

of the instruction. Themāheśvarasūtra could be used as a tool ofpratyāhāra, as I see.

There are more learned people in this forum who might educate us in the subject.

  

My scientific proposition is to discover the origin of Paninian sounds.
As we wrote in

our recent paper they should be considered as units of speech and are not as units of

manifested sounds. As units of speech they would be universal and biological. But

then how we quantify them in their individual signature? How are the signatures different

and what causes the difference? What mechanism translates a thought to speech? 

  

Ours is a modest preliminary effort. As you say, the problem has many aspects.

The fundamental proposition would be to inquire the origin of a thought and the

possible segmentation of thought in the brain for analysis and storage.
We have to

design new experiments to explore this. There has been some lingering statement

through psychology that a thought is rooted in a word. That the word is a construct

while a thought is analog has been missing in the psychologists' argument. This is

where the analysis of yoga would come in. I do not know if there is research on the

analysis of thought, not Freudian, but cittavṛtti.

  

It is interesting, but can get immediately complex and people give up!.
Please keep

thinking and generate courses. Decades of work by many schools might lead to

some scientific conclusions. It would be science at its best, not outer space, but

the inner space! it is not the realization of the Brahman but the analysis of śakti,

the potential

  

Best regards,

BM
