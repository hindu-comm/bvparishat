Presently there are more than 700 students studying in the Gurukul who come from 12 different states of India. All of them stay in the Gurukul. We have a team of 30+ experienced and dedicated teachers to impart education and supervise the students at all times. They help them to realize their intellectual potentialities and make them cultured and disciplined as per the teachings of Vedas and Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati.  

  

There is an imposing Yagyasala in the Gurukul Campus, which signifies the spirit of sacrifice and self-effacement. This edifice infinitely adds to the charm of the Gurukul. All the brahmacharinies assemble here along with the principal and the teaching-staff to perform Agnihotra. Amidst musical Vedic chants they perform Brahmayajña for self-purgation and Devayajña for environmental purification. This is done during early morning hours and at sunset regularly.  

  

Students are trained in all the subjects till the 10^(th)standard such as English, Science, History, Geography, Mathematics, Computers, Home-Science, and Drawing etc.*** After 10^(th)standard, students mainly focus on Sanskrit-grammar, Philosophy, Upnishad, Literature, Moral-scriptures (Dharmasastra) etc.***
