**Gangadevi**, also known as**Gangambika**, was a 14th century princess and[Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit")-language[poet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet "Poet")of the[Vijayanagara Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayanagara_Empire "Vijayanagara Empire")of present-day India. She was wife of[Kumara Kampana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumara_Kampana "Kumara Kampana"), the son of the Vijayanagara king[Bukka Raya I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukka "Bukka")(c. 1360s-1370s).^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangadevi#cite_note-1))

Gangadevi chronicled the story of the victory of her husband, over the[Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims")in[Madurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai "Madurai")in the form of a poem. The title of the eight chapter poem was*[Madhura Vijayam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madura_Vijayam "Madura Vijayam")*, also known as*Veerakamparaya Charitram*.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangadevi#cite_note-ganga-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangadevi#cite_note-MaduraVijayamPDF-3))

At the beginning of*Madhura Vijayam*, Gangadevi eulogizes several Sanskrit poets of the[Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language "Telugu language")-speaking region, and particularly admires Tikkaya (identified with[Tikkana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkana "Tikkana"), the author of*[Andhra Mahabharatam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Mahabharatam "Andhra Mahabharatam")*). This suggests that she was from a Telugu-speaking region.^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangadevi#cite_note-4))
