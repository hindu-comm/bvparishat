\> could you guide us as to which scholars, works, etc one could update oneself on regarding the issue of countering anti-Indic bias in western and indian scholarship. I am aware of Swadeshi Indology, and not much more.

  

You already mentioned Swadeshi Indology conferences. That itself is a huge work.

  

That as you know has the background of Sri Rajiv Malhotra's works and his Infinity Foundation. You know how game-changing it has been.

  

You have a huge network of organisations under[www.indicacademy.org](http://www.indicacademy.org/).

  

Dr Sunthar Visuvalingam runs several active lists including

Abhinavaguptaabhinavagupta@[yahoogroups.co](http://yahoogroups.co)m

He himself is contributing an inormous amount of countering while hosting and encouraging many others.

Prof.s Viswa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee are doing powerful work in their chosen specific areas :<https://hunter-cuny.academia.edu/VishwaAdluri>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Balagangadhara> is working in his own way.  

Why? BVP itself is hosting a lot of countering work on its platform.

There is a lot more happening on several different platforms in several different ways.
