I guess a new word needs to be coined for  

**hatred/contempt/dislike/distrust towards Hinduism and (by corollary) Hindus**  

\- modelled after this perhaps:

**"Misanthropy** is the general [hatred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatred "Hatred"), dislike, [distrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distrust "Distrust") or [contempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt "Contempt") of  

the [human species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_species "Human species"), [human behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior "Human behavior") or [human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature")."  

(A **misanthrope** or **misanthropist** is someone  

who holds such views or feelings.)

The word's origin is from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") words :  

[μῖσος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%E1%BF%96%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:μῖσος") *mīsos* 'hatred' and

[ἄνθρωπος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CE%BD%CE%B8%CF%81%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:ἄνθρωπος") *ānthropos* 'man, human'.
