Dear Dr BVK,

You spoke my mind. I have to tell an anecdote.

In 1990 my daughter started her undergraduate studies at Harvard

and i imagined a graduation when Sanskrit would be recited. Harvard

has a tradition of Greek and Latin oratory, so I thought I could engineer

the students to create a Sanskrit oratory. This is the time I discovered

that the sounds were not taught and the job was in textual interpretation.

Disappointed I started the Harvard Sanskrit Conversation Table which

stayed popular. Actually Krishna Shastri did visit me in 1994 when he

was organizing Sanskrita Bharati. The Conversation Table did not

produce oration and in had to experiment through the temples. The job

of Sanskrit oration at Harvard remained incomplete. Prof Aklujkar revived

the interest during his visit in 2002 but things did not move and the Infinity

program collapsed.

Now, the Brain Initiative. I was involved in the Human Brain project in

the '90s purely for anatomical mapping.
<http://www.hms.harvard.edu/research/brain/>

The new research would be to check how does speech carry and convey

neurological information. it could be intuitive and speculative,

but we have to create the scientific basis. We did some preliminary work

for the last WSC to show that the syllables are independent neurologically,

but then what gives them the quality of sound?

When we go to shabda-brahma we go to a neuter description of perception.

My thinking is the sound is alive and they are capable of recreating a scene.

I am experimenting with Valmiki, but I don't have a model yet!

We need some text that might have analyzed the depth of the sky in terms

of speech sounds such that a blind can visualize the depth. In principle, it

should be possible through our speech faculty, so is the thought. I am a

novice on old Sanskrit texts, I fetch as I go. We need more seasoned

people who have a better inventory of information to engage people in

research. We should not pay much attention on the source of funding

as long as we may be able to freely expand human knowledge. I have

not tried new funding yet. We are toying the word "rasa".

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
