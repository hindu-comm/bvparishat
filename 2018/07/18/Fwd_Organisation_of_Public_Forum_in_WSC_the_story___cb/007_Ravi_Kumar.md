I just want to make a couple of points here that might seem somewhat removed from the main discussion but are actually not.

  

It seems to me that what the West is doing is amoral but right, if seen from a strategic perspective, a utilitarian perspective. That has been their entire pattern of action if we look at history - they organize, they take the initiative, they attack, they occupy, they take. If they lose, they have what they have always had; if they win, they get to gain what's someone else's. That is a sound utilitarian principle, an effective operating principle.

  

They don't have too much reverence for the past, and they look at Nature as something to be milked, not something to be revered and kept unsullied. And who is to say their worldview is wrong? Their worldview is what has shaped this modern world, and is what is going to shape the future too. They dominate everywhere. They have the military strength, they have the mighty corporations, they have the scientific and business know-how. While we have what? Monuments and Temples? Palm-leaf manuscripts?

  

(Of course this take-everything outlook leads to ruin in the long run, but that's a long way away; and we won't be around to witness that - the victorious outlast the defeated. And whats more, in the long run, everyone is dead, as a famous Westerner has said. Pertinent words.)

  

We just wring our hands and try to defend, and bemoan, and basically do nothing much of substance while we sit on our moral high horse and slap ourselves on our backs and tell ourselves what a fine culture we have, what an excellent history we have. We are sitting on a horse - in this jet age.

  

A paradigm shift is what is needed, a radical change in our operating principles and in our worldview is what is needed. We need hunger, we need ambition, we need desire, we need to set aside morality for a while and just organize ourselves on utilitarian lines, we need to out-organize everybody else in every department (including academics, yes) if we wish to be relevant.

  

We maybe on the right path since Independence, but we are damn slow, that's for sure. We are on the highway to progress but with our snail-speed we are practically stationary when compared to the rest of the world, a world that is moving faster than us. Need proof? Forget US, forget EU. Just look at China and South Korea, in our own backyard, for starters.

  

We are in danger of becoming a footnote in history if we don't change our ways. Given out lethargy, it is a miracle we have survived so far.
