Dear Sri Raviji,

I do communicate to many who have similar cursory interest.

My suggestion to all capable people would be to spend at least an hour

a day in analytic thinking and studying on a topic of interest.

We should make a principle not to "assume" or take things on face value.

Massive questions should appear and one has to calmly handle them.

it is easy to go superficial on these subtle areas where we have been

flooded with gross theories of convenience and bias.

i will send you our paper privately. I recommend not to skip but

understand the concept internally. You can ask further questions

when ready to dedicate time. Some analytic grammar training would be

extremely useful in your legal work also.

Best wishes,.

BM
