Dear Prof Varakhedi,

Thank you for sharing this note. In the west, there are people who do political interpretation of Indian literature. 

While people are free to pursue such interpretation in their own campuses, to infect the international body

with a political agenda is a new phenomenon!

I am glad that you are speaking up! I missed the meeting because of a family situation. I expect to get

a first hand report tomorrow. WSC unfortunately does get political color possibly to support itself!

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
