Thanks, Dr Shankar Rajaraman.

  

If you can do a more detailed such review, let us publish it. Dr Ramesh Rao is ready to publish it on Indiafacts.

  

Other members may contribute their observations too.

  

My line of argument is :



just as the Sanskrit literature in praise of the British and Sanskrit scholars working in collaboration with Europeans does not disprove the wealth drain or many other harms that rule caused to India, its people and culture, the Sanskrit literature in praise of the Mughal rulers and Sanskrit scholars working in collaboration with Mughal courts can not disprove the theory of the harm caused by some or all of the Mughal rulers to India, its people and culture.
