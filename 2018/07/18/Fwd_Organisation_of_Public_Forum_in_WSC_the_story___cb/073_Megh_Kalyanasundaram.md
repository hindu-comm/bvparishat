In point 4 of the 08:47 hrs post (<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/cbthNAM0jNc/m/8ccRwynDAQAJ>; also in trail below), I had included 3 excerpts fromVikram Zutshi's Mar 12 2021 article in the*The Hindu*titled*[The curious case of controversial historian Audrey Truschke](https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-curious-case-of-controversial-historian-audrey-truschke/article34050315.ece/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)*and I am glad to see Dr. Mahulikar has chosen to express a view in response to that article. I thank Dr. Patruri for bringing singular attention to the above article.
