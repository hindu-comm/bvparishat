<https://www.britannica.com/topic/Brahmanism>  

  

During the 19th century, the first Western scholars of religion to study Brahmanism employed the term in reference to both the predominant position of the Brahmans and the importance given to*brahman*(the[Sanskrit](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sanskrit-language)terms corresponding to Brahman and*brahman*are etymologically linked). Those and subsequent scholars depicted Brahmanism either as a historical stage in Hinduism’s evolution or as a distinct religious tradition. However, among practicing Hindus, especially within India, Brahmanism is generally viewed as a part of their tradition rather than as a separate religion.
