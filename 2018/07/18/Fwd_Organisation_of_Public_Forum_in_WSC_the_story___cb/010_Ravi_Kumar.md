Yes sir, I agree. And I think you also understood that what I said in my post was in the nature of praudhivaada, a bold assertion.

  

While we are on the topic, could you guide us as to which scholars, works, etc one could update oneself on regarding the issue of countering anti-Indic bias in western and indian scholarship. I am aware of Swadeshi Indology, and not much more.
