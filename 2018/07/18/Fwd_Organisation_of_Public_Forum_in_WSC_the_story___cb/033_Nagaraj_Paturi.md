Misra-ji,

  

This seems to be in reference to Mandakranta Bose-ji's book /article.

  

I did not recommend the book to the list.

  

The thread is discussing the three women Sanskrit scholars who were on the WSC public forum on अस्मत्संस्कृतम् Our Sanskrit (a sarcastic title).The panelists wereProf. Mandakranta Bose, Dr. Koushal and Dr. Ananya Vajpeyi.

  

The invitation describes the event as a sharing of personal experiences of three deprived ladies  

  

After showing howDr. Ananya Vajpeyi's self-projection as a womanwho was deprived Sanskrit is fake, I was trying to see the background of Prof. Mandakranta Bose. Unable to trace her article similar to the one by Ananya-ji, I was citing the book's contents to show that she doesn't seem to be as Hinduphobic.
