SAdara praNAm,

The very name Hindu is that which was thrust upon us by foreign invaders just to distinguish us from them.

It seems to be time we start using our own name *SANATANI.*This will be enough to create quite amisunderstanding amongthem and against what they are actuallydoing to us.

Knowledgeable Vidwaans may please think about.

Namaste.

  

*Prof. Sivakumar*
