I concur with Dr. Varakhedi and Dr. Kannan. There was no real good stuff in that meeting in WSC which I attended. Another point to be condemned is the use of the term Brahminical (texts). I raised my voice at least on three occasions in the deliberations. We have astika darsanas and nastika darsanas. We have vaidika darsanas as well as avaidika darsanas. We may refer to sesvara concept or nirisvara concept. Nowhere in our tradition is mentioned brahminical or otherwise. What is its definition ? When I raised this point the western scholars kept quiet but an Indian scholar rose up and said that it is defined in some encyclopaedia compiled by some western scholar. Is he a rsi? Is his encyclopedia veda to merit authority? The term is deliberately coined to cause division and ill feelings among Hindus. All Indian scholars should join together to fight against such divisive forces. We must send memorandum to WSC to ban the term in its deliberations.
