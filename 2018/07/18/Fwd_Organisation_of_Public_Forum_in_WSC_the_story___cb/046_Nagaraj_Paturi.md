The word " Dalit" comes from the Sanskrit root " Dal" meaning to split, to break. But the word has been being used in the sense of oppressed community or depressed classes in the Indian political discourse, in reference to the communities that are in terms of the Indian constitution are called Scheduled Castes and in Gandhian terms were/are called 'Harijan'. The first use is variously attributed to Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Dr B R Ambedkar. Since both these were Marathi speakers, it is interesting to check if the semantic change from 'split'/'break' to 'deppressed/oppressed' is due to semantic change during borrowing from Sanskrit to Marathi.

  

While SC (Scheduled Castes) is official /constitution-based term, the word 'Dalit' gained currency later to 1970 and by now it has become THE word for the context in general discourse.
