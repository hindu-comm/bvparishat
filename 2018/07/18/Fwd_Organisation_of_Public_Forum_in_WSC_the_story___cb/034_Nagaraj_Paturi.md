By citing the web pages of Arya Samaji Gurukula Vidyalaya's I was showing how the allegation of women being deprived of opportunities to learn Sanskrit is fake news /false information.

  

Here in Hyderabad itself there are around 50 fine women scholars of Sanskrit produced by **Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya. **Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya was founded on March 4, 1902 by Swami Shraddhanandaji****

Arya Samaj has been advocating women’s education since the day it was founded. As part of its policies for the up-liftment of women in the country, Kanya Gurukula Campus, Dehradun was established in 1922 by**Acharya Ramdevji**as a second campus of women’s education. To give real shape to the dreams of Swami Shraddhanandaji, Kanya Gurukula Campus, Hardwar was established in 1993.****
