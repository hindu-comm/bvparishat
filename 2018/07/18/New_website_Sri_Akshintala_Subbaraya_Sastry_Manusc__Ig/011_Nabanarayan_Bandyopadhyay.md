Dear Akshintala Raghava Krishnaji,  

A lot of thanks for launching the mentioned website containing the excellent family collection of the scanned & digitised copies of many valuable Sanskrit manuscripts. Hearty congratulations for this great endeavour. Scholars interested in manuscriptology and paleography will be benefited much from this attempt.

With warm regards,

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
