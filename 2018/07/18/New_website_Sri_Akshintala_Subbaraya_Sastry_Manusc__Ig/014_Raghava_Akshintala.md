Respected sirs,

  

Thank you for your feedback, and I will work on implementing these with the information I have, viz. add more details for the books. Sri Shankara-ji's suggestion is very helpful, and I will work on setting up a shareable Google spreadsheet template for the manuscripts, so that work on identifying the books can take place in a collaborative manner and there is no duplication of work.

  

With namaskaarams,

Raghava
