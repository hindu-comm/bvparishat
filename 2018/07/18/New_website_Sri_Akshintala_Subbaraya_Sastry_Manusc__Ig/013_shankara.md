Raghavaji,

  

It would be good if you create a catalogue template on Google docs where everyone who wishes to help in identifying the manuscripts can fill in the [sl.no](http://sl.no)., title, author, name of commentary, author of commentary, etc. Thus, the progress made in identifying the mss would be there for everyone to see and there would not be any duplication of work.  

  

regards  
shankara
