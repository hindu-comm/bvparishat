Respected scholars and members of this group,

  

With the blessings of my pujya guru-ji, elders and well-wishers, it is my privilege to announce the website <https://sassmc.wordpress.com/> containing scanned copies of several manuscripts that are my family heirloom for over 250 years. Most of these manuscripts were collected by Sri Akshintala Subbaraya Sastry, who lived during the latter part of 1700's.

  

Most of these manuscripts deal with the following subjects:

-   mīmāṃsa  
-   tarka (nyāya)  
-   navya-nyāya  
-   vedānta  

  

All these manuscripts are in Devanagari, & Telugu scripts with a small portion in Bengali script.

  

We request scholars to peruse these manuscripts and hopefully identify content that may be of use for further study.

  

Pages in most of these manuscripts are jumbled, and some books seem to be incomplete. While digitizing, we have presented the books in the same order as we have found them. Each bundle (a separate set of papers enclosed between wooden planks) has smaller books / sections tied together separately.

  

I request scholars interested to identify, segregate and re-order the contents of these manuscripts, and kindly let me know so I can modify the website and hopefully release these as separate books in PDF or any other suitable format.

  

With regards,

Akshintala Raghava Krishna
