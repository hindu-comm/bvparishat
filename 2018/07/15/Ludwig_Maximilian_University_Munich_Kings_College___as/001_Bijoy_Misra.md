I just heard part of the first episode. It is just flawed. For some reason the individuals go

into comparative work, without understanding what the work is. Since India is older,

they need to map other ideas with India as a reference. The intellect does not measure

and broadcast happens! But they do have an English language audience.

Pseudo-colonialism.., Sorry for my negative thinking..

A lot of research and editing would be required before it gains value..
