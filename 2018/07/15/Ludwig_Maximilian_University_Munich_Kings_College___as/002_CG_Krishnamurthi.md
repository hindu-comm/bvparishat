Precisely that's the idea of posting this.

  

We need to understand how the Westerners are looking at our Dharshana. Our drishti and their drishti are entirely different and the political class and westernized educated people are buying those theories wholesale. There is no point in just getting bits and pieces of their views, these 60+ video lectures cover all most all dharshana and our traditional people should see each and everyone and understand how these are getting interpreted with different narratives and also with a subtle colonial undertone. Else, we can continue to ignore these things as they're false and wait... This is certainly not for those who are in the path of adhyaatma.
