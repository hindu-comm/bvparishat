thanks for help. what happened with this bad reprint of good book is itself worth wondering where we are going. it is indicative of our difficult times.

at present I am engaged in teaching my 10 year old daughter all these texts. first we used 4 books published by Samskrit Bharati Bengaluru. these books are well designed, well printed. moreover, most importantly
clearly printed, so elementary students can read them clearly. these books give good introduction to samskrit. later we started with Prathamadarsha. this is a very good book series. we have had benefits of reading the whole series. I bought the full series available in local book store. but the problem is after seeing number of reprints based on reprints, the books is not not at all readable. letters get mingled with adjacent letters. sometimes there is blank linear line where no letter is printed. my daughter is struggling with this bad reprint. how can a first time student guess these pages. the published is reprinting the reprinted again and again without understanding what he is doing. he does not care even to print the book name correct. it is printed प्रथमातर्शः in the recent book. no other publisher can print it for the fear of copyrights.

what I want to point is- where the indian Samskrit studies is heading? we are not even able to print good books for elementary students. our own university books Prabha vibha and shubha contain numerous print mistakes.

only God can help us.
