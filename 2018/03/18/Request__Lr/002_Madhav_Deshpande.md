Dear Shankaraji,

  

  Thank you so much for tracing this article by P.K. Gode on Gāgābhaṭṭa's work Samayanaya. These days we are watching a Zee-Marathi serial on Sambhaji, the son of Shivaji, and in one of the shows they depicted Gāgābhaṭṭa arriving at Raigad fort and dedicating his work Samayanaya to Sambhaji. Gode's article mentions that there is a copy of the manuscript of this work at BORI in Pune. I will try to get a photocopy of this manuscript during my next visit to Pune. Thanks once again.
