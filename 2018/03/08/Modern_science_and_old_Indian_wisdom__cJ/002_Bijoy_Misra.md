It is a mistake when people try to compare the "modern science" with the " indian analytic science".

On psychology, language, grammar, comprehension and expression, there is no comparable work

in the west yet. It has to do with cosmological speculations in India centered in "life." Apparently

those inquiries are very ancient and original to the land. It has to do with the appreciation of "mind"

as an important organ and the principal component in doing an activity.
Its enunciation must be

pre-vedic. (I have not encountered the document on its discovery. It seems as "given".)

  

On physical sciences (objects and interactions), we see empiricism.
This has to do with observational

astronomy, experiments in nutrition, discovery of medicinal use of herbs, practice of basic ballistics,

heat treatment of materials, production of alloys and dyes, cotton and silk. Certainly mathematics and

geometry developed strongly to help in architecture and construction of massive stone structures.

Sushruta gives many surgical concepts, which are used these days with refined tools.

  

Some of our people here are looking into the political economy. It seems India succeeded in creating

a stable society that was prosperous as well as learned. Our people will report in our seminar here on

April. I will post the slides.
