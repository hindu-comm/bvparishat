BM:"There is a philosophical difference in the approach to science in India and in the west.

India appears to be concerned with the cause and not a therapy. All causes cannot

be discovered and they would invoke supernatural. But the approach that an event

would have an origin is fundamental to scientific thinking. Discovery of cause through

yoga needs more detailed analysis".

  

On the other hand, sir, there is a clear perception of

the scheme of causality, and its proper utility.

  

See*Vyāsa-bhā**ṣya*on*Yoga-sūtra*2.15.:

***yathā cikitsāśāstra****ṁ****caturvyūham -***

***rogo, roga-hetur, ārogya****ṁ****, bhai******ṣ**ajyam ity***

***evamidam api śāstra**ṁ** caturvyūham eva ...***

  

The concepts of *heya, heya-hetu, hāna,* and *hānopāya*  

in *Yoga-sūtra*-s 2.16, 2.17, 2.25, and 2.26

give a clear indication that even in yoga they were not talking mumbo-jumbo

but taked sense (and the very language of science).
