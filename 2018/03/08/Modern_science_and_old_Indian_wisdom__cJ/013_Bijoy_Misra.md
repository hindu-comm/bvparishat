There is a philosophical difference in the approach to science in India and in the west.

India appears to be concerned with the cause and not a therapy. All causes cannot

be discovered and they would invoke supernatural. But the approach that an event

would have an origin is fundamental to scientific thinking. Discovery of cause through

yoga needs more detailed analysis.

  

Fundamentally, then the question is to point to a cause externally or analyze it internally.

When Charaka says that "a good recovery needs a healthy mind" is a deeply scientific

observation, though might not be easily achieved. Recovery here leads to prevention

than a transient treatment.

  

Cause in physical sciences is object interaction though one may say that there hides

spirituality in each object etc. The latter is subtle and there is no tool to measure it.

The broad gross universe can be explained by gross interactions, not caring if the

activity had any "intent".
