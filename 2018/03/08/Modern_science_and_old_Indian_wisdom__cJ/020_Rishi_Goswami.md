Dear karveji, the concept of evolution is not the dashavatar. It is not been so vividly edplained in the scriptures or i haven't experienced it as for now.

The Hiranyagarbha upanishad and vishnu puran 1st amsh itself talks about the creation of the universe.

We should not forget that, each have 3 roopas, aadhibhautik, aadhidaivika and aadhyaatmika.  
Brahma had created the oshadhyayah from his pores, as mentioned in creation process, also we practically look at the oshadhyayah and vanaspati beimg sprouted from prithvi.

So, evolution can be understood in the same way. Humans may have been physically evolved from apes, but were also the sons of Manu Maharaj. It may seem contradictory, but it is possible. This is what my observations are.

Regards  
Rishi.
