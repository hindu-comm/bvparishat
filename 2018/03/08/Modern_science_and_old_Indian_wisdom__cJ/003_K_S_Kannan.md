I thank David Reigle, Dr Ramanujachar, CGKrishnamurti and Bijoy Mishra for their kind responses on my ideas regarding science in ancient India.

  

A science like chemistry can be considered a "hard science" (or "exact science"), whereas the study of language (and for that matter, even medicine) is a "soft science". David Pingree has prepared a multi-volume census of some of the former sciences in ancient India giving a conspectus of Indian progress in those realms, and I need not repeat them here.

  

But ancient India took up the harder issues of the study of softer sciences like the study of language and study of mind. The kind of exhaustiveness of their study, and the compactness of their formulation and formalisation, is best illustrated in the works of Pāṇini and Patañjali. The entire work of Pāṇini (Vyākaraṇa-sūtra-s)runs to hardly 50pages if printed continuously in a demy-sized book. And that of Patañjali (Yoga-sūtra-s) to less than 10 pages. And yet what an amount of information/concepts and issues they handle! Even with thousands of engineers working on Natural Language Processing, have they been able to devise a grammar of a(ny) language with such sharpness and compactness? History has not witnessed Pāṇini-2 yet.

The world is opening its eyes only now to the merits of yoga. Rajiv Malhotra has shown how numerous concepts of the Hindu/Buddhist/Jain studies of mind in their works on yoga/tantra/ āgama-s have been usurped, processed, rehashed, and relabelled by Western psychologists without a word about the source of their ideas, and brazenly used for encashing the ideas. A good many of the recent books by Westerners on linguistics have blotted out the name of Pāṇini or the Indian contributions to the field and sought to project the ideas as their own.

  

The realm of spirituality is another I do not want to dwell on here.

  

It is a matter of shame (ignorance + inferiority complex) that we are struggling and endeavouring - to *somehow show* that we too had *some* knowledge of science in the past. India excelled not only in the realm of the sciences, but even the Science of sciences. The havoc on the environment consequent to the splurge on science and technology running riot, and the innumerous new illnesses that they are giving rise to - are not taken stock of by anyone. The great strides in medical sciences of modern times should not make us turn a blind eye to the negativities.
