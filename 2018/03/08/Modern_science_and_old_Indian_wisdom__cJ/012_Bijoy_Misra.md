Dear Sri Kalyan,

I do not know your background. In case you have studied Panini and

are tracking the developments in natural language processing, you

would have known your answer. What we need is to develop strong

Panini scholars who are also in neurology and in artificial intelligence.

I assume you have some interest in the field. If yes, I can guide you

to the literature. Strong academic research is lacking. Hope you

would be able to contribute.

Best regards,

BM
