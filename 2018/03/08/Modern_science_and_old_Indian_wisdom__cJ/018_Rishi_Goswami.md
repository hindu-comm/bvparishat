Respected Schollars,  
Namaskaram.

In respect to physics, most of the kmowledge of western science, especially the Einstein's general and special relativity can be partly traced in nyayashastra.

As per ShriKannanji's views, I completely agree that we do not need to proge ourselves and derive those scientific theories by molding the words using vyakarana and nirukta, but I would just like to state my observations, which are pretty evident and do not need any type of molding.

Kaal, is described is "sa chaiko vibhurnityashcha" in tarka sangraha, which ridicules the ideology kaal being "three". Kaal is just 1, but the 10 lakars or the three kaals, are just used for "vyavahara". Aakash isn't a dravya, when it is ahochara, atindriya and is just space and the absence of any other dravya. As we know, aakash cannot be the adhikaran of any other dravya, so why not call it as abhav?

We can't, simply can't as it's a dravya and samavayi karanatvam dravyasamanya lakshanam. It has to be a samavayi karan as it's a dravya and it is samavayi karan of samyog. Kaal and aakash have nitya-sanyog! This is just as Einstein stated - the spacetime continuum.

There is no authenticity of the big bang. As scientists are still unable to configure what caused the big bang. It's just the "best guess" they have reached until a better theory comes forth. As it leaves many questions unanswered. Instead, the Vishnu Puran seems more scientific. It has Vishnu pre-existing as Pradhan(energy), Purush(matter, paramanu), Vyakta(moola swaroop) and Kaala(time), these four forms. Plus, the universe isn't created but just emerges from it's seed form - Hiranyagarbha, which is a tejah punja that gradually expands itself into the universe which we observe now.

Its pretty convincing that if there was a tejah punja, the universe was obviously dense, hot which gradually cooled down. Secondly, the expansion of the universe is also clearly written, it's written that it expands itself 10x and then 100x, so there isn't any need of the big bang.

Many such theories such as time dilation of special relativity can be proved easlily without any molding or use of nirukta. The only reason why we did not coin these things, as we paid more attention to the parabrahma, the paramatma rather than basic science. After realization of the paramatma, why will anyone want to discover some creation? What is samsara when you've reached the paramtatva?

All shastras, yoga, nyaya, meemamsa had only one purpose - better understanding of the vedas and hence brahmajnyaana!

Thankyou.  
Regards

Rishi.
