Dear Prof. Kannan,  
  

Your post in the thread on "surgical procedure in Valmiki," was highly appreciated by me. So much so that I am copying it in a new thread specifically on its topic.  
  
What impressed me was your clear analysis of the problem and your forceful statement of it. To think that modern science, which is physical science, is the be-all end-all, when India has always been the leader in spiritual science, is indeed unfortunate. A truly objective observer can see that the sages of old India have produced the most advanced spiritual science of anywhere on the planet. This can be demonstrated objectively by the fact of the presence and use of reasoning in all three spiritual traditions of old India, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, while this is absent in or not a feature of the other religions of the world. Of course, this is to say nothing of the depth of insight found in the old Indian religions in comparison with the other religions of the world.  
  
So I greatly appreciated your post, and was very glad to see it.  
  

Best regards,  
  

David Reigle
