What is science after all? It is a description of natural phenomenon as a relation between two entities with respect to the product supposedly called cause and effect. Is this description not a stuti of natural phenomena.

  

Within this framework the Vedas are a science which describes man's relation to nature in the form of stuti. 'Fire thou are our protector' contains a statement regarding the acknowledgement that this invention if we may call it to be so transforms human life no different from how an android phone changes modern life.

  

What the west is now realising in terms of how modern advancement damages the environment was well envisioned in Vedic times by saying that with all the potentialities that have been endowed on man it is his responsibility to protect nature.
