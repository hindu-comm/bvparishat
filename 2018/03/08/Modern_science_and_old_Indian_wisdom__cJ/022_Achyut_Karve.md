## Evolutionary interpretation[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dashavatara&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Evolutionary interpretation")

Some modern interpreters sequence Vishnu's ten main avatars in a definitive order, from simple life-forms to more complex, and see the Dashavataras as a reflection, or a foreshadowing, of the modern[theory of evolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_evolution "Theory of evolution"). Such an interpretation was first propounded by[Theosophist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy "Theosophy")[Helena Blavatsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky "Helena Blavatsky")in her 1877 opus*[Isis Unveiled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis_Unveiled "Isis Unveiled")*, in which she proposed the following ordering of the Dashavataras:^([\[33\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara#cite_note-Nanda-33)[\[34\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara#cite_note-Brown2007-34))

-   Matsya - fish, the first class of vertebrates; evolved in water
    (Indicates origin of Fishes in[Silurian
    Period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian_Period "Silurian Period")) -   Kurma - amphibious living in both water and land; but not to confuse
    with the vertebrate class amphibians)(Indicates origin of Amphibians
    in[Devonian
    Period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian_Period "Devonian Period")) -   Varaha - mammals, wild land animals (Indicates Mammals origin
    in[Triassic
    Period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic_Period "Triassic Period")) -   Narasimha - beings that are half-animal and half-human (indicative
    of emergence of human thoughts and intelligence in powerful wild
    nature) -   Vamana - short, premature human beings -   Parasurama - early humans living in forests and using weapons -   Rama - humans living in community, beginning of civil society -   Krishna - humans practicing animal husbandry, politically advanced
    societies -   Buddha - humans finding enlightenment -   Kalki - advanced beings with great powers of destruction.

This interpretation was taken up by other[Orientalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism#Orientalism_and_religion "Orientalism")and by Hindus in India, particularly reformers who sought to harmonize traditional religion with modern science.[Keshub Chandra Sen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keshub_Chandra_Sen "Keshub Chandra Sen"), a prominent figure in the[Brahmo Samaj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmo_Samaj "Brahmo Samaj")and an early teacher of[Swami Vivekananda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda "Swami Vivekananda"), was the first Indian Hindu to adopt this reading. In an 1882 lecture he said:^([\[33\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara#cite_note-Nanda-33))

> The Puranas speak of the different manifestations or incarnations of > the Deity in different epochs of the world history. Lo! The Hindu > Avatar rises from the lowest scale of life through the fish, the > tortoise, and the hog up to the perfection of humanity. Indian > Avatarism is, indeed, a crude representation of the ascending scale of > Divine creation. Such precisely is the modern theory of evolution.

Similarly,[Monier Monier-Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monier_Monier-Williams "Monier Monier-Williams")wrote "Indeed, the Hindus were ... Darwinians centuries before the birth of Darwin, and evolutionists centuries before the doctrine of evolution had been accepted by the Huxleys of our time, and before any word like evolution existed in any language of the world."^([\[35\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara#cite_note-Brown-35))[J. B. S. Haldane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane "J. B. S. Haldane")suggested that Dashavatara gave a "rough idea" of vertebrate evolution: a fish, a tortoise, a boar, a man-lion, a dwarf and then four men (Kalki is not yet born).^([\[36\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara#cite_note-36))[Nabinchandra Sen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabinchandra_Sen "Nabinchandra Sen")explains the Dashavatara with Darwin's evolution in his*Raivatak*.^([\[37\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara#cite_note-Sen2010-37))[C. D. Deshmukh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._D._Deshmukh "C. D. Deshmukh")also remarked on the "striking" similarity between Darwin's theory and the Dashavatara.^([\[38\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashavatara#cite_note-Deshmukh1972-38))
