In case of astrology:

\(1\) How do you cast a horoscope when a child is born in space (say in an aeroplane flying at an altitude of 35000 feet) ?

\(2\) How are you going to give predictions with such a horoscope ?

  

In case (1) above, Mr K.M. Khareghat did give some formulae, which were published in the Astrological Magazine long back. But I don't think, enough research has been done regarding this with practical data.
