\<\<4 . With the Sidereal time of birth known, we can go ahead and map the positions of planets and the ascendant. Or simply input the above values in a reliable software and cast the chart. \>\>

  

Sir,

  Even if the sidereal time is known, the present softwares don't take into account the height into consideration. So the position of ascendant will be obviously wrong, because the eastern horizon will shift earlier to the computed one. If the method other than equal house division is used for casting the horoscope, other cusps of different houses (except the 10th and its just opposite) will also change. The tables are prepared for finding different cusps assuming negligible height at which a child is born. I am not aware of any new software that takes into account the height also.
