Dear Shri Narayan Prasad,  
  
a) For casting an horoscope, all we need are the three info:  
1. DOB (Date of Birth)  
2. TOB (Time of Birth)  
3. POB (Place of Birth)  
  
*Let's go one by one*:  
1. For DOB, a person inside the aeroplane can note the date at the exact moment of birth keeping in mind whether the plane is crossing the IDL (International Date Line) or not.  
  
2. For TOB, he can note the time in his watch (let's assume it's in IST : Indian Standard Time). He has to convert the time appropriately for the longitude at which the aeroplane is flying and then based on that corrected birth time, he can calculate the Sidereal time of birth.  
  
3. For POB, generally the place cannot be accurately known while flying in the aeroplane but at any instant, we can know the GPS coordinates which gives Lat-Lon (Latitude & Longitude). Since the longitude info is very important for the step-2, we can surely go ahead and calculate the sidereal time.  
  
4. With the Sidereal time of birth known, we can go ahead and map the positions of planets and the ascendant. Or simply input the above values in a reliable software and cast the chart.  
  
b) Coming to the Predictive part, it's as same as any other horoscope.  
  
c) Enough research cannot be done on practical data as most of the airlines discourage / do not allow women in advanced pregnancy to travel due to risk involved. Hence, this can be more of a hypothetical situation than the actual one.
