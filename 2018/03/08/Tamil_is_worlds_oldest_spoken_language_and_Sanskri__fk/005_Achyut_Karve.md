What are the characteristic features of a language away from that of a dialect?

  

Primarily however humans evolved speech with the help of the nascent physiological abilities endowed to him by nature and hence on the other side we may say that language is as old as humankind himself. Here the form that it takes becomes immaterial.

  

Unfortunately western history starts with written history. As if there did not exist any history prior to that. That humankind can transfer knowledge through an oral tradition is what these historians cannot think of. They forget that a language is first spoken before it is written. The level of evolution of a language can be fathomed by 1) its script and 2) it's grammar.

  

These should have been the aspects that the video must have presented.

  

The best way to counter such videos is to present a critique of the video on YouTube with the same heading so that the layman will not be misguided by such videos.
