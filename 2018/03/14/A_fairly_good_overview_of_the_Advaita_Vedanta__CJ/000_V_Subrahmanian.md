Namaste

  

I just read the Anandagiri vyakhyanam for the very first mangala shloka of Sureshwaracharya's Brihadaranyaka Bhashya Vartikam. I felt extremely amazed at the great depth of meaning the verse conveys. Anandagiri Acharya has brought out the deep purport of the verse in many ways. A study of just the vyakhyanam, a lengthy one indeed, will surely be rewarding. One can get a fairly good overview of the Vedanta shaastra. The schools that are opposed to Vedanta are given a referencewith the particular words in the verse that refute them. That way one gets to know the essence of those schools. The prameya and pramana bhaaga of Vedanta is very beautifully brought out in the vyakhya for the very first verse. The anubandha chatushtayam too is briefly stated to make the discourse a complete one in all respects. I am posting the vyakhya, in several images here for those interested to savor the dish.  

  

I have shared the images, five in number, constituting the vyakhyanam on Facebook and here are the links to those images, in that order:
