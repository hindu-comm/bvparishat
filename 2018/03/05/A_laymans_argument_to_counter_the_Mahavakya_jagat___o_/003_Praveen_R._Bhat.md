Namaste Ramana Murthy mahodaya,

  

Although जगन् मिथ्या is not an exact Shruti statement, I get where you are coming from. So I'd say that it is important to define both terms सत्य and मिथ्या before being used. You have used them as if सत्य is exactly opposite to मिथ्या and vice-versa. They are not so.

  

How is that a dream-lion wakes up a person into a waking world by a dream leap on a dream person on a dream run? The dream lion should not cause fear and sweat in the waker, but it does!
