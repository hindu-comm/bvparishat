Respected Scholars,

  

Here is a layman presentation to counter the MahaVakya: जगत् मिथ्या (World is pseudo or false or does not exist)



Let us start from background.



We might have studied Geometry in High School. Many hypotheses can be provied by Indirect method.



**Indirect Proof or Proof by Contradiction:** A method of proof where the conclusion from a hypothesis is assumed to be false (or opposite of what it states) and then a contradiction is reached from the given or deduced statements.

The steps to follow when proving indirectly are:

-   · Assume the opposite of the conclusion (Hypothesis) of the
    statement.  
-   · Proceed as if this assumption is true to find the
    contradiction.  
-   · Once there is a contradiction, the original statement
    (Hypothesis) is true.  

  

Mathematical Example:

**Hypothesis (To Prove):** There can not be more than one right angle in a triangle.

**Assumption:** A triangle ABC has two right angles ∠Aand ∠B.

**Proof:** right angle = 90 degrees

∠A = 90 degrees

∠B = 90 degrees

∠A + ∠B = 180 degrees



Since sum of angles of triangle must = 180, this means that ∠C = 0 degrees.

Since the angles of a triangle must be greater than 0 degrees, this is a contradiction meaning that the triangle cannot have more than one right angle.

The Hypotheis is provided by indirect or contadictory method.

 \*\*\*\*

Metaphysics Example:

**Hypothesis:** जगत् सत्यम् । This wolrd of names and forms is real and existing.

****

**Assumption: **जगत् मिथ्या. This world of names and forms is unreal/ dellusion and does not exist. It is false and pseudo.



**Proof:** Since this world does not exist, everything in this world is false / untrue and does not exist. The Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, mountains, rivery … everything do not exist because they are part of the world. Since Whole does not exist, the Parts also do not exist. Even countries US, UK, Singapore, India do not exist. They are false/untrue. Technology also does not exist. Even mobile, internet, this BVP forum also do not exist because all these in the world which does not exist as per our assumption. Even the Vedas do not exist because they are also part of the world. Now we have reached a state where Mahavakya (जगत्
मिथ्या) is implying that Vedas do not exist. But this Mahavakya is coming from Vedas itself.

 So we reached a contradiction or absurdity. Why we have reached this absurdity? Because, we have assumed that जगत् is मिथ्या.

So the assumtion “जगत् is मिथ्या.”is wrong. Hence the opposite of this assumption( i.e.. जगत् सत्यम्) is true. So our Hypothesis is proved.



Sir, this is layman argument. Is there any blooper in this arugment? Please validate it.



Regards

Ramana murthy****
