Dear Sri Ramana Murthy Bathala garu,

  

You titled the thread as "a layman's argument to counter the Mahavakya".

  

Interestingly , not only the 'counter', the 'assumption' in the structure of the 'counter' itself sounds an uninformed layman's understanding.

  

"Assumption :जगत् मिथ्या. This world of names and forms is unreal/ dellusion and does not exist. It is false and pseudo."

  

Sri Praveen R Bhat has already pointed that out by saying, "You have used them as if सत्य is exactly opposite to मिथ्या and vice-versa. They are not so."

  

You seem to understand जगत् मिथ्या as " The world does not exist" . But in fact , जगत् मिथ्या actuallymeans " The world is not as it appears to be". Brahmatva of Jagat is Jagat's true reality. Jagatva of Brahman is only Brahman's apparent reality.
