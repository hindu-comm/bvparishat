Namaste

  

Many have tried this logic method. But this logic is not applicable when you are mixing two levels of Satya. Jagat Mithya is from Paramarthika Satya level. Not from Vyavaharika Satya level. In Vyavahara the sentence Jagat Satyam is correct. In Paramartha there is only One Satya known as Brahman. Therefore there can be no second Satya like Jagat there. With this meaning the Acharyas said Jagat Mithya.
