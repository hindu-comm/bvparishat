namaste,

  

Proof by contradiction is not a universally valid method of proof, not even objectively, even within mathematics. Proof by contradiction depends upon the fact that the truth values of a proposition can only be either "true" or "false", a notion that is formalised in propositional logic as the 'law of excluded middle' (LEM). The LEM essentially says that for any proposition (what you called a hypothesis), it is either true, or it is false. There are systems of logic in which the LEM is not tenable. A very important example in modern mathematics is smooth infinitesimal analysis - calculus depends on infinitesimals, which are to this day problematic to define completely rigorously within any simple framework of propositional logic.

  

I copy below an answer to a question about the LEM which may throw further light on what bloopers may afflict your above application of proof by contradiction. The source is<https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1209852/systems-without-the-law-of-excluded-middle/1209906> .

The statement

  

> Since Whole does not exist, the Parts also do not exist



reminds one of quantum mechanics - complete knowledge of the whole state of a system consisting of two parts does not guarantee complete knowledge of the parts (in fact, it can be zero knowledge in some cases). Indeed, for pramANa, Erwin Schrödinger's in a 1935 paper on the state of quantum mechanics, while studying quantum entanglement, states*"the best possible knowledge of a whole does not necessarily include the best possible knowledge of all its parts".* This is only tangentially related to the discussion at hand, but hopefully illustrates that assumptions such as existence of parts implies existence of a whole, or existence of a whole implies existence of parts, cannot be made very lightly - this is not even abstract at this point, we are talking about real physical systems such as electrons and photons, which can be manipulated and observed in labs.



In the end, the takeaway for me personally is that the real import of statements like jaganmithyA is experiential, personal, and subjective. Hair-splitting exercises in external/objective science are great fun and commendable, but of no use unless some internal progress can be squeezed out of them. If one's goal is to only analyse the validity of a statement within a given system of logic, it is always possible to choose a system where the statement can be proven false. The very reason that the scriptures say often that things such as brahman and self-realisation defy description is to emphasise the fact that exercises restricted to purely one domain of thought and experience (formal logic, for example) cannot lead one to them. Axioms and propositional logic, physics and mathematics, grammar and chemistry are all parts and elements of life, but life does not appear to be any one of them or even their sum.

  

These are my humble and still-forming opinions. I apologise for posting potentially very obtusely and only tenuously related material. Thank you for your patience in reading.

  

Humble regards,

Sathya
