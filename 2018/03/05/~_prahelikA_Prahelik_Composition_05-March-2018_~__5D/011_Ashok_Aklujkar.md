Dear Shri Hari Parshad Das,  
  
As suggested by others you should continue to compose verses like the one you have shared with us.  
  
In addition to the verse that Prof. Deshpande has shared with us, there is the following verse (Śārṅgadhara-paddhati 527), of which your quarter ‘b’ is reminiscent: केशवं पतितं दृष्ट्वा द्रोणो हर्षम् उपागत: / रुदन्ति कौरवा: सर्वे हा केशव कथं गत: ।। (some annotation available in Subhāṣita-ratna-bhāṇḍāgāra p. 186)  
  
“vai” is not necessary in the third quarter. How about changing that quarter to कं संजघान धर्मात्मा?  
  
Best wishes.  
  
a.a.
