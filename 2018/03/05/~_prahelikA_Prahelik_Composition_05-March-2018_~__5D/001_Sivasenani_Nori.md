Sri Hari Parshad Das

  

Very nice attempt! And very enjoyable. You should try more of this.

  

If some honest feedback be tolerated, the second half is very good. The first half kind of sounds forced, even accounting for the fact that when one employs Slesha, there will be some turgidity in the flow.
