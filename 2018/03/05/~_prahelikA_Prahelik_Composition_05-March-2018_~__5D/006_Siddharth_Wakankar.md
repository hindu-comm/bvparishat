Dear Shri Nori,

  

Thanks for the magnanimity of accepting the wrongness of the form.

I can understand your problem in using the older and more popular reading in your own spontaneous composition.

Do continue to write such couplets to enlighten us.

Some fifty years back,we had a great Sanskrit Scholar in Mumbai, Shri Shri.Sham.Navare,who used to compose such simple Sanskrit verses and publish in the Marathi Newspapers.

Best luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
