I will simply say that Dr Shonaleeka Kaul gave at the ICHR conference a scintillating presentation (abstract attached), in which she broke fresh ground by showing the misinterpretations of colonial, nationalist and Marxist scholars as regards *Rajatarangiri* and did a fine epistemological analysis of how the text views history as inextricably linked with ethics or imbues history with values. I briefly interacted with her and wish we had many more such young historians with solid scholarship, strong cultural roots, and the daring to chart out a new perspective. That she has been able to achieve this in her career at DU and (more recently) JNU is all the more commendable. That is my personal opinion; please judge her on her publications (I have seen all three):



-   2018, *The Making of Early Kashmir*: *Landscape and Identity in the
    Rajatarangini,* Oxford University Press, Delhi -   2013, *Cultural History of Early South Asia: A Reader* (edited
    volume), Orient BlackSwan, New Delhi. -   2010, *Imagining the Urban: Sanskrit and the City in Early India*,
    Permanent Black, Delhi.

Regards,



Michel

Has anyone read her earlier work, pls? Heard that her book on Kavya is anti-Hindu in stance.



Nageswara Garu, you are right.There is a need toascertain her ideological orientation.

That means she accepts that Polllock's hypothesis is a rule for which she provides an important exception through her research on Rajataringi. Or am I reading her differently?



In any case it would be better people who are in this group and know her personally should clear doubts about her ideological orientation if any.

My current research closely examines the relationship between language and expressions of space in early medieval India, arguing for moving beyond the influential binary of ‘cosmopolitan’ and ‘vernacular’ literary cultures authored by Sheldon Pollock. I revisit Kalhaṇa’s*Rajatarangini,*the iconic 12^(th)century chronicle of the royal dynasties of Kashmir. I draw attention to how this classic literary representation of regional space is in the ‘cosmopolitan’ Sanskrit and not in the vernacular language, thereby providing an important exception to Pollock’s hypothesis.

As read I through her interview, I could not but be impressed by erudition and brilliance of Dr. Shonaleeka Kaul. However, when I went through her CV available at

[www.du.ac.in/du/uploads/Faculty%20Profiles/2015/History/Aug2015_His_Shonaleeka.pdf](http://www.du.ac.in/du/uploads/Faculty%20Profiles/2015/History/Aug2015_His_Shonaleeka.pdf)



I get a suspicion about her ideological orientation. I only wish that she is not a Sheldon Pollack in making. People in this group who know her may please confirm.



For various reasons including and most important being the inadequate academic rigour on RW side, the youngsters get easily attracted to left-liberals leading to drain of best brains to the enemy camp from the Hindus.
