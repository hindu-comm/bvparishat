Please correct “syllable "ṣ” to "syllable “ṣi” in the following.

  

Dear Ajit,

  

Thanks for your concern with accuracy, especially at a time when this forum is citing examples of gross carelessness in the writing of Sanskrit.

  

The alternative reading should also be improved by adding “c” between “ṣi” and “chando” as I suggested earlier. Otherwise, the syllable "ṣ” will not become guru and the metre will limp.

  

Sanskrit needs more persons like you.

  

Best wishes.

  

a.a.
