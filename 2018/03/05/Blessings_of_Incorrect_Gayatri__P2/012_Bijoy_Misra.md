These distortions are rampant in various volunteer-driven efforts in the temples,

events and in institutions. It is a pure function of reproducing something in

script that people hear. There is no editing process, because there is none

to edit. Any transfer of sound to script would have its error.
Possibly huge

effort was involved in early creation of written manuscripts. I have wondered

if punctuation in script is also a necessary part of grammar. It is not clear

to me why it was not thought. Is it purely using maximum space on writing surface?
