Sir,

  

Now a days,many Sanskrit scholars don't understand that they are making grammatical mistakes,spelling mistakes etc. and just want to parade their love or better Abhinivesha for using it in any form they find,without bothering about the correctness or otherwise of what they write.This is evident in newspapers and television screens also.

This Blessing seems to be like that only.

  

ओं शांतिः शांतिः शांतिः
