Obviously, the image is full of blunders.

  

It may be interesting /pertinent to investigate into the source of "ignorance of texts".

  

The person who sent it to Prof. Deshpande is ignorant, otherwise he would have discarded the image, not shared it.

  

The person/group who created it -even if it were to be seen as the printing personnel's wrong, - is ignorant, otherwise it would have proofread it well and would have allowed it to go public only when the image without mistakes got ready.
