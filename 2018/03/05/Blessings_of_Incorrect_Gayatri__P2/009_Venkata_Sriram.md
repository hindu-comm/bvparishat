Dear Venkat,

  

Vidyatirtha Foundation, Sringeri has published a book on sandhyavandanam with tamil commentary. This was approved by Shri.Abhinava Tirtha Mahaswamigal.

  

.................

  

<https://www.sringeri.net/2008/12/31/publication/book/sandhyavandanam.html>  
  
................

  

It is explained whereवरेणियम् is chanted. It says "पाठकाले वरेण्यं स्यात् जपकाले वरेणियम्".

  

So, during vedic chanting, parayana and arghya,वरेण्यंis used but during japa & homaवरेणियम् is used.

  

I specifically asked Shri.Bharati Tirtha swamigal as what should be chanted during Japam. His Holiness clarified statingवरेणियम् should be

used during japa, andवरेण्यं should be used during arghyaM.

  

rgs,

sriram
