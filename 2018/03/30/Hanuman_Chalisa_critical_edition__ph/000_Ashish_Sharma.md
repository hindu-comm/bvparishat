Dear Learned Scholars & Guruvars

Pranaam  

  

I'm searching for critical edition of Hanuman Chalisa as there are so many variations for different words.

  

I even tried critical edition of Pujya Guruvar Rambhadracharya Ji but still not satisfied with that (found बल बुधि instead of बल बुद्धि,).

  

Please guide me for the same.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

Ashish Sharma
