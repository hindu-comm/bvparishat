Dear Learned Scholars & Guruvars

Pranaam  

  

I'm searching for critical edition of Hanuman Chalisa as there are so many variations for different words.

  

I even tried critical edition of Pujya Guruvar Rambhadracharya Ji but still confused with that (found बल बुधि instead of बल बुद्धि,). If someone explain rationale then also it will help me to understand it properly.

  

Please give details from where I can get correct Hanuman Chalisa.

Some says, Gitapress is best hence requesting you all to give proper light on this issue.
