On बल बुद्धि/बल बुधि, the resolution is rather simple

1\) The *tatsama* word बुद्धि has three matra-s

2\) The *tadbhava* word बुधि has two matra-s

  

The first part of each*dala*(line) of the*doha*metre must have exactly 13 matra-s (the pattern is 13-11 13-11 for a*doha*). The reading बल बुद्धि बिद्या देहु मॊहिँ has fourteen matra-s, while the reading बल बुधि बिद्या देहु मॊहिँ has thirteen matra-s, as demanded by the metrical rule for the *doha*metre. Therefore the reading बल बुधि बिद्या is correct and not बल बुद्धिबिद्या. By the same metrical requirement, it is clear that the correct reading in the first *dala*of the *doha* is बुद्धिहीन and not बुधिहीन.

  

The Gita Press edition and the edition by Jagadguru Swami Ramabhadracharya Ji both have बुद्धि in the first *dala* and बुधि in the second.

  

You may please refer the attached images. The first two images are from my the appendix on Prosody in my expanded and annotated translation of the *Mahaviri*(2015: Niraamaya Publishing, ISBN 978-8193114407) while the third is from the Gita Press edition (Gita Press ID 1528)
