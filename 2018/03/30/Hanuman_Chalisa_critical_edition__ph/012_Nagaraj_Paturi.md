Jagadguru Sri Ramabhadracharya ji Maharaj's edition is the best critical edition so far.

  

Any pronunciation guidance or any help like that can be taken from Sri Nityanand Misra-ji.

  

Please remember that the avadhi language used and all other critically required questions are all thoroughly researched by them.

  

What more do you need?

  

What are you waiting for?
