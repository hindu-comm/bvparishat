Tools of writing history need to be well understood. It is based on "evidence" that is available now. So, the oldest piece of writing known is from clay tablets (there is an entire epic of Gilgamesh, maybe roughly thought of as the Sumerian equivalent of Arjuna, found on a clay tablet); Harappan seals are again clay seals; most other forms are on stone. The oldest known piece of textile is from a tomb. In fact tombs and burial sites are a rich source of history.

  

In a culture which does not believe in permanence of mere things, in which dead people are mostly burnt, which flourished in a tropical country (where a lot of micro-organisms which eat media of writing flourish), where learning through listening prevailed and actually continues at least two thousand after the known use of writing, there is bound to be lack of such evidence.

  

Absence of evidence (whether it be horse bones or samples of writing) is either confused as evidence of absence by historians, or is deliberately painted so (just check out the politics of naming Rhodesia as Zimbabwe and the way the history of Zimbabwe was distorted by Western historians - the very same forces were at work, if anything, more powerfully when history of India was being written by the very same English).

  

The only accurate statement that we can make is that we do not know



\* if Prakrit was written before the time of Ashoka

\* if Sanskrit was written before the time of Rudradaman I

  

Since this is a very unsatisfactory state of knowledge, Historians complete the picture for rest of humanity. So, they conclude that absence of evidence for over two hundred years, must mean that evidence of absence and present their "completed" version of what might have happened in the past. They have done this so many times that they no longer feel the need to add a disclaimer: "Please note that what is contained in this book contains a fair amount of speculation of the author."

  

Not merely history, but historical linguistics, is also similarly based on speculation. One can still understand it as an attempt to build a model from the few available fragments, if the methods of history were uniform.

  

In all this speculation and demand for evidence, the standards are hugely different. For instance there is no record of Pythagoras writing down his theorem. The earliest surviving record in the Western world about Pythagoras Theorem is about 800 to 1000 years after Pythagoras, yet no proof is demanded there. Similarly while the contents of Indica (written by Megasthenes - which plays a pivotal role in dates in Indian history; only fragments of this book are available) are taken as valid notwithstanding the numerous incongruities, the same sympathetic reading is not extended to Puranas. It is not merely Westerners who are like this; many Indians - scholars and otherwise - apply these differing standards. What makes the Pythagoras Theorem issue worse is that we have a clear statement from Bodhayana giving the exact statement of the theorem and yet it remains the theorem of Pythagoras.

  

There is a need for Indians to understand these methods of historiography and keep an open mind about the "received" version.
