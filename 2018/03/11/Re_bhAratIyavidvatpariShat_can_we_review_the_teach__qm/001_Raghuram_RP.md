I would call upon anyone wanting to learn how we teach Sanskrit are welcome to visit our school Purnapramati in Girinagar, Bangalore.

We start teaching Samskrita at the age of 3. We adopt a mixture of gurukula and Montessori system to teach samskrita, English and Kannada. We have prepared some materials and trying them on students. We have had seen some amazing results
