Dear sir,

  

I was going through the link:<http://sanskritlibrary.org/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvindx/disp/mdhv_index.html>

  

I found the the rootरुष (दिवाद्) is not included in the Index list.

  

But it is in the Madhaviya Dhatu Vrutti book. Please find the screenshot

I would like take this to the notice web administrators. But I could not find their contact details.

  

Can someone help me in taking this to their notice.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
