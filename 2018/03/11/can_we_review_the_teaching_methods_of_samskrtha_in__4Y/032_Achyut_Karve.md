If we can have 1st to 7th text books of all subjects with verbatim English Translations and Guides that will help grand parents like me to take through grand children through the primary syllabus. By the time the children go into 8th Std they will have become independent.

  

This will also help the child to decide for itself the robustness of the Sanskrit language as a medium of instruction.
