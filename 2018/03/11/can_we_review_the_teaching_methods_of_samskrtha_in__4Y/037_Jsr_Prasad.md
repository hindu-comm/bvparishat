A laudable decision, Dr. Malavi ji! You may want home-school your children up to some time. May be from 5th or 7th standard onwards, you would put connect them with Board exams, privately. Is this the idea? I am not sure, whether ICSE or CBSE has this sort of private study and later one can attend final exams. [NIOS](http://www.nios.ac.in/) has private study facilitated at secondary and senior secondary levels, which will take longer time to reach out the SSC/SSLC certificates for college study.
