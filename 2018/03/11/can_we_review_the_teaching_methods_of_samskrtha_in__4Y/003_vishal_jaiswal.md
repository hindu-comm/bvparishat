The environment for Sanskrit simply does not exist as yet - be it spoken or written. I mean the simple stuff - the gap between ground zero and literatur. Darshanas, etc is entirely another higher level than this.  
Sure, there is a trickle (samskrita bharati) but it does not replace or even approximate a torrent.  
As you rightly mentioned, how many sanskritists can process sanskrit natively without resorting to translation as they would with their mother tongue or english ?  
I remember that a bala sahitya parishad was set up some years back in Pondicherry. I have not seen much output there as yet. Still waiting.
