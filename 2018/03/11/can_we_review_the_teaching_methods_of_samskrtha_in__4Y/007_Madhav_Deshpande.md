When I was a highschool student in Pune (from 1956-1962), each student had to study four languages, namely Marathi (State Language), Hindi (National Language), English and Sanskrit (Classical Language). This four language policy was later changed by the central government to a three language policy (tri-bhāṣā-sūtra), and with that began the decline of the teaching of Sanskrit in most states. To my knowledge, only in the Hindi speaking states Sanskrit continued to be included in the three-language policy. I am not familiar with the current policies.
