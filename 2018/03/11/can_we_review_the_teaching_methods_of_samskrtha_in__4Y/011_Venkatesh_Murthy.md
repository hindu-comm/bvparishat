Namaste Raghuram

  

I appreciate and admire your efforts. But at the same time look at the situation now.

  

Every home in many areas of cities like Bangalore has minimum one or more persons working in IT or other lucrative job and going abroad OR they know somebody in the extended family with these qualifications.

  

This must change to this situation -

  

Every home must have minimum one person with Sanskrit MA or PHD OR they know somebody in extended family with these qualifications.

  

How far are we from the goal? You know the answer. I don't have to write more.
