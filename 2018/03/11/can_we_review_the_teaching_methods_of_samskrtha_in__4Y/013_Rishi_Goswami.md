I completely agree with Raghramji.  
I'm not in the favour of teaching by writing. When I passed cbse school, my father initiated me in sanskrit studies and that is when my guruji started teaching me. We never studied through periods, we never used a notebook or a blackboard. There was no homework, onpy revision. Instant revision was encouraged and rote learning of sutras.

The concept of western schools was not to make us study, but to mold our brains into a system where we just learn to follow orders, make us like robots. The british needed clerks and workers then, this education system was a boon to them and a curse to our 3 generations, probably even the 4th now.

We need to have a 2nd common language as a communication tool, within akhila Bharata. State language should be compulsory. But English imposition is useless. Teaching Englsih to each and every person, is not worth it.

Today, we have boards, state boards etc. We need to divide schools and classify education for everyone. If we teach trignometry and arithmetic and physics to everyone, their inclination will be towards commercial and scientific fields, which is the case today. This will result in unemployment, which is also prevalent in engineers. If everyone pearns through this system, who will choose to become a farmer, fisherman, electrician, plumber, salseman or milkman? Only the poor who couldn't afford education?

They should be given education according to their requirements. All the state's works should be in the State's own language for it becomes very difficult for certain people to understand English. We live in a country where English has become a necessity, rather than a choice. Any job, any sector, only the English learned men are given privileges and no Hindi/bharatiya bhasha jnyaani is considered as a vidvaan. What will sons of farmers and fisherman do by learning trignometry and chemistry? Why are we hellbent on anglicizing our society?

There should be certain schools, where the first language be the hindi, sanskrit as the second and english as 3rd. Others can have the third language hindi and first english. These schools are for vocatioal jobs. These schools will certify potters, weavers, artisans, fishermen etc. These will give proper recognition to them. This will insure a balance of all sectors in society and also proper functioning.

Sanskrit can be introduced from grade 1 after hindi. English from grade 2.

For those, who want to learn english and pursue it in their careers abroad, other private institutions exist. We should not be dependent on a foriegn language for making a career in our own state.

Sanskrit is not in demand, that is the reason the supply is limited. We need to have to maje jobs and commercialize it. Unless it is "rozgaar ki bhasha" it will never become "rozmarre ki bhasha".

Thankyou  
Regards  
Rishi.
