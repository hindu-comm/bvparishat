Madam,

If home schooling means studying things in a different way from the standard in addition to attending a regular school, fine. If it means home schooling alone without attending a regular school, I would suggest that caution is called for. Brilliant children will do well whichever way they are taught. But for mediocres a standard schooling I believe is preferable.
