From our part we are giving training to our samksrita pandits in ncert syllabus from pre-primary to 6th grade(modern subjects). It is being quite well received. Our aim is also to produce text books and teach those subjects in samskrita.

We are also trying integration wherever possible (Darwin's evolution and bhagavattha creation, dharmashastras and Constitution, modern concept of time and shastriya concept of time )
