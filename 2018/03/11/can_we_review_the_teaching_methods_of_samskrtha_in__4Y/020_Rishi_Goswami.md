I really appreciate Raghuramjis sentence. It is important for children to learn.

I want to translate english novels in Sanskrit, I don't have that much experience or practice, still I daily write a few pages for my personal benefit, to improve my Sanskrit vocabulary.

Once I become mature enough, I will certainly fulfill this taks also, which is my dream too. I want children in buses and playgrounds reading popular Sanskrit literature as recreation, not religion or academics. I will have to improve myself first, for which I have to struggle alot.

I am unable to translate many usages exactly into Sanskrit for which I plan to visit this place in Bengaluru, I wish so, one day I will. I am very fascinated by your attempts to preserve this language. Sanskrit, if translated into popular literature, especially the ones for which movies have been made, people can easily relate to it. As most of the characters are familiar to them, they won't need an introduction to the plot and their details. Readers can enjoy reading this, and this will be very helpful for those who are learning.
