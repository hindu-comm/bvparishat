When I started taking tutions of children from Std 5th to 10th (all subjects) I frequently faced a situation that children would forget what they had learnt in the previous stds. It was then that it occurred to me as to why do Sanskrit scholars not compose Sanskrit verse so that once it is put to memory by the child it would be permanent.
