Namaste. Prasadji, in our homeschooling venture, we will be targeting the NIOS for 10th exams. (CBSE does not support private candidates, but IGCSE does).

As mentioned in an earlier thread about modern science and ancient Indian wisdom, we are having to face an alarming decrease in the*saṁskṛta*education standard when done through a school or college because we try to make it as secular as possible. However, we can never see*saṁskṛta*in its full glory without the spiritual dimension. School teachers or college lecturers are very afraid to make any reference to these dimensions in their classes. So they are having to resort to a secular mode and this naturally results in bringing down the standard even without our realising it.*Ādhyātmikacintanam*is the*vṛkṣa*here. We have to ensure that the*latā*namely *vidyā*(education) uses this tree alone for its support. If we fail to provide the support of*ādhyātmikacintana*-*vṛkṣa*to the*vidyā-latā,*the result is total chaos, as we see it today – secular views, westernisation and what not; and this is because*vidyā,*being a creeper, needs the support of a tree and cannot stand alone. If we do not provide the proper tree, it will find its own way to other undesirable trees.**

Even from basic lessons, we are made to read about garden, school or village etc. Instead, we should try to incorporate lessons attached to*purāṇa*-stories - an example of a few lessons on Prahlāda, Dhruva etc by Sri. Krishna Premi Swamigal is attached. It would be relevant to state here that he has authored many kāvyas and*śāstraprakaraṇa-granthas* with a twin aim - 1. achieving good*saṁskṛta*knowledge/*śāstra*knowledge 2. The path to knowledge is designed such that the*ādhyātmika*factor is kept in mind and *bhagavadviṣaya*plays a dominant role. Anyone interested may contact me individually to get details of his 50+ such granthas, because providing further details here may be misunderstood as exploiting this mail group as an advertisement platform, which is not my intention at all. I am just referring to them to say that we shouldtry to incorporate those texts (whoever the author maybe) in the syllabi in which we may read about the author in the*laṭ-lakāra*or atleast,*luṅ*or*laṅ;*and not always in*liṭ*, as is the case, at present. This will help us to fight with full vigour, allegations from Western scholars, who claim that Sanskrit is dead. Kālidāsa is what he is to the*saṁskṛta-*world today only because the*saṁskṛta*scholars of his day generously accepted him. ‘आपरितोषाद्विदुषांन साधुमन्येप्रयोगविज्ञानम्।

बलवदपिशिक्षितानामात्मन्यप्रत्ययंचेतः॥‘bears testimony to this. I request scholars not to treat this arguement as impertinent.

It is doubtable whether Kālidāsa himself intended his*Abhijñānaśākuntalam*for study in a classroom. Can’t we just leave those works for personal reading? The same is the case with the*Pratāparudrīya*or*Kāvyaprakāśa.*If we require examples for the erotic sentiment to explain certain features of the*sāhityaśāstra,*can we not resort to *divyasṛṅġāra*, as this will lead to both intellectual and spiritual enrichment? The*Ācāryas*themselves relish this as in -राधा-सरस-वपुरालिङ्गन-सुखो जगन्नाथः स्वामी नयन-पथगामी भवतु मे (Śrī. Ādisaṅkara in *Jagannāthāṣṭaka*); Śrī. Vyāsācārya in many instances in *Śr**īmadbhāgavata*; Śrī. Jayadeva’s *G**ītagovinda *etc



Regards,

Malavi N **
