If Christains can study the bible in school and muslims the quran because they are minorities how is it that we have forgotten to learn our own scriptures for which studying Sanskrit is absolutely necessary.

  

What Deshpandeji is saying is true but if we want to really bring Sanskrit back we need to start teaching the child right in the 1st Std itself. It is the age at which it is easy to make the child multi-lingual. Further the school curriculum for the Stds 1st to 4th primarily focus on developing the lingual skills of the child in addition to learning the primary operations on numbers. Thus by the time the child is in 5th std. he will have become Sanskrit literate.
