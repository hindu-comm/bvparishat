Mahoday,

Yes these are the exact thought process which we delved upon and are working on.

Children start learning samskrita at the age of 3. Hwre the focus is on varnamala (no writing) , spoken samskrita and vocabulary enrichment. When they come to 1st grade, we start bhagavath geeta and samskrita writing. By the end of 4th, all 18 chapters are memorised. In parallel samskrita vyutpati gnana is developed following baaladarsha and some materials which we have generated. Of course kosha, sutras, shabda and Dhaatu memorization is also done. A new concept like 'karaka' is presented , then children use various books/materials to further strengthen the learnt concept. Then the next concept is taught. By the end of 6th grade most of the children would have got good vyutpati gnana. Till 6th grade there is no mass teaching. The concept is taught
to a group of children who are ready for it and then they can practice. We don't have structured 40 minutes periods and children are allowed
to work as long as they wish on a subject. From 7th grade , Prathama, Kavya and sahitya exams (conducted by Karnataka samksrita university) are taken to further enhance their basics.

3 language policy has always been followed in Karnataka. When children learn samskrita is there a separate need to learn Hindi ? (Experts have to answer)

I would request experts to visit our school, see and give feedback on how to improve.
