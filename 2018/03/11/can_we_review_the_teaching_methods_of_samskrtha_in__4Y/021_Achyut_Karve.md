The question is why did these languages go out of vogue? The point I want to make is languages such as French, German, Japanese Chinese, and the like still continue to be languages of knowledge in their respective countries because new modern literature is generated in these languages as well as many important works are translated into these languages.

  

Let alone Sanskrit is such work done even for Hindi? I doubt.
