You see that Greek as a language was studied outside the church as a classical language. However Latin was a language of the church just as Arabic of the Muslims.

  

How do you view Sanskrit?

  

English became a language of the world because all secular literature was translated into English from other languages.  Have we attempted to translate scientific or literary works into Sanskrit? On the contrart we boàst that many Sanskrit works have been translated into other languages. This itself is a sign of Sanskrit going out of vogue as a language of knowledge.
