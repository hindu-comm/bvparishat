Namaskar,

  

Me and my family have no background in Samskrta, except the cursory 2-3 years of learning in school. Of which I had hardly remember anything now.

But I do admire the language, its science. My belief is that Samskrta is all there is to true Samskara. My belief is that it opens doors for one to become an evolved, consistent being.

Once that is built in your blood, all mundane life achievements (that we crave/aim/demand) would naturally follow through. No need of sheep flocking at them as we do today (no offence meant for our parents generation. Different times, different struggles)

  

It is my goal to see that my child (20 months old) gets quality Sanskrit education in proper manner.

However, I don't know where to start. Any guidance would be highly appreciated. I think the sooner they start the better.

  

What can we do as parents?

When and what should be outsourced (pardon for using this word) to a qualified Guru?

Where/How to find such a Guru?  
  
All such questions keep bugging me. Apologies for opening my personal pandora.

I'm basically looking for guidance to chart out a masterplan to academically and spiritually groom my progeny into better, evolving dharmic beings.

There, I said it. Such an easy task :D :D

  

Regards,

Virendra
