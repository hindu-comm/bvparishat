First of all, I appreciate the arguments raised Malavi Narayanan. Happy
to see many eminent saṃskṛta scholars responding to the same. Sri Venkatesh Murthy ji, Sri GSS Murthy ji and Sri Karve ji - all these scholars have contributed and still contributing to the cause of saṃskṛta. I don't think, they are unaware of their own questions! Partially their questioning of the use of saṃskṛta was answered by the thread initiator.  
  

Sri Raghuram ji's timely response is a solace for the questions raised initially. Bangalore is such a place, where one can find Purnapramati kind of schools which not only reflects our concerns but has concrete solutions. Once again, all our congratulations and best wishes to him and his team at the concept school. I was desperately searching for such a school in Hyderabad, but in vain. May be, all like minded should join and collectively start such a project here, is the only solution as I see now.  
  

Regards
