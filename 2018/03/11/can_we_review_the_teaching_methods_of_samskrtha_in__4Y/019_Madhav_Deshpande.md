Dear Shri Karve,

  

  If you read history books carefully, you would not make a statement like "However Latin was a language of the church just as Arabic of the Muslims." Latin was the official language of the Roman empire centuries prior to it becoming the language of Roman Christianity, and Arabic was the language of the Arabs since long before the emergence of Islam, and even after the emergence of Islam, Arabic has not been the language only of religion, but of entire Arabic populations till today.
