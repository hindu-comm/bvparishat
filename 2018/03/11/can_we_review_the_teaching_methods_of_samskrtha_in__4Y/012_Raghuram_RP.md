Yes mahoday the situation is present currently, but how do we change the situation, if we start now it may take a generation to change.

We can't simply sit and wish it away. The children we are building now will change the situation in future.

I am only saying that we need solutions and not restating the problems. Every one knows the problems. I am not saying this with ahankara but with satisfaction that a team effort is being made at our school to change the situation

And to add to my last mail, we give the same importance to modern subjects.
