Namaste

  

The bitter reality has not changed. The mindset of average people is they are always attracted to good career and earning money. In the old ancient days Kings used to give financial support to Vedic and Sanskrit Sastras. Parents and children had a secure future in following Sanskrit studies. But look what has happened now. There is a stupid democracy in India and it is ruled by corrupt politicians. They give more importance to vote banks to help them to get power and stay in power. There is no goal to betterment of society. You tell them something and they will only think about how it can help them in getting votes.

  

If you can give a guarantee of a fat salary for Sanskrit degree holders like in IT jobs of MNC companies young people will come and stand in queues to study Sanskrit. They are prepared to pay lakhs of rupees in fees also. Why not? They want to see the money and career prospects.
