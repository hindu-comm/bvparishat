Sri Raghuramji,  
  

I thought of writing to you personally, but it would be injustice not to appreciate such a noble and important work you and all the involved people doing at Purnapramati, publicly.  
  
Sri Rishi Goswamiji correctly pointed out "*Sanskrit is not in demand, that is the reason the supply is limited.*". There will definitely be a day when Sanskrit will be in great demand. I'm not into academics, but even in current days, isn't a proficient Sanskrit learned person (say a post-graduate) get a good paying job? If anybody is hell bent to compare it with IT jobs, please take account of the long and odd working hours and so called on-site opportunities that are breaking apart the already broken family structures, current nuclear to atomic and sub-atomic level. (There are families in which farther is working in Germany, mother working in India and baby of 1 year in Creche). I'm sure many of us have see it happening around.  
  
To understand why Sanskrit is not in demand, probably the Mr Macaulay has the answer. What he said before eradicating indigenous self-sustained education system of our country.  
(reference: Minute by the Hon'ble T. B. Macaulay, dated the 2nd February 1835., link: <http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html>)

I admire this person's intelligence, and personally believe he was the Chanakya of England. What a great plan he crafted and implemented, that what I see around today is the precise result this guy has projected nearly 200 years back. This is not the change in culture by chance.  

  

It will take time to restore our lost education system, a life time, may be generations to change the trend but fortunately there are people who have voluntarily accepted this seemingly impossible challenge and tirelessly working for it. I should at the least believe in them and let them work on their mission, rather than doubting them.  

  

Throughout the history, it's observed that the path of Dharma is never crowded. One needs to do lot of struggle (Sangharsha is apt word) to walk on it, and that is the aim-of-life of few righteous persons.  

  

Regards,  

Sunil
