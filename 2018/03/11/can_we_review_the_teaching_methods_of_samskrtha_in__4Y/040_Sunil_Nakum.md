Malavi ji,  
  
Since the topic of choice of Boards for Home Schooling (in India) has discussed, and I have valuable inputs to provide.  

  
I've been studying the options for Home Schooling (rather the better term Alternative Schooling), since we are contemplating it for our child. As per current norms and the knowledge I've gathered so far, and you also quoted that the CBSE and ICSE boards do not entertain home schooled students (i.e. Private Candidates). So most obvious way is to go for NIOS, IGCSE or State Board. Since I reside in Pune, I've gone through rules and regulations pertaining to Maharashtra State, upto the admission to various professional degree colleges. There are few pitfalls like the recent (Aug 2017) public notice by Medical Council of India (MCI) announcing they will not accept NIOS students for UG-NEET exams (luckily it was taken back after much oppose) and the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) not accepting home schooled children, etc. These things are nicely put together with supported links at [this blog](https://schoolalternatives.wordpress.com/2018/03/16/which-board-for-home-schoolers/). <https://schoolalternatives.wordpress.com/2018/03/16/which-board-for-home-schoolers/>  
  

Dhanyoshmi,
