Thank you Sri Subrahmanyam ji and Sri Kannan ji for a very satisfying response. The analogy is now clear to me with all the inputs you both have provided. My particular question was answered by this line: 
धूमार्थः वह्निः =धूमकारणकः वह्निः इष्टं वा अनिष्टं वा फलान्तरं तृणादिकदहनरूपं उत्पादयति, for, I had asked this very question in my earlier post 'is any ishtapraapti achieved by the grass burning?'

  

In fact this concept stands demonstrated, though unintended, through this short discussion: I had asked the question with a view to understanding the analogy. However, while that purpose was served, the other 'phalam' of knowing about the several meanings for 'artha', which was unexpected though, especially 'nivrtti', was produced, which is certainly ishta for me. 

  

warm regards
