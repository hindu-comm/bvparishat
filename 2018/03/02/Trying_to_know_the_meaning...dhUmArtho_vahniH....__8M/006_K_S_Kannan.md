As to -artha:  

We must care for the idiom of the language.  

We cannot deduce false equations.  
  

As a school boy, I had argued that in Sanskrit,  

*ku* has no meaning.  

My teacher differed, and asked me why I say so.  

I said - *kusuma* means flower,  

 *suma* also means flower.  

QED !
