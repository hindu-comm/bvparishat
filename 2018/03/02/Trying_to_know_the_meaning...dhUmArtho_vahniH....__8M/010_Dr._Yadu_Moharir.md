Namste Prof. Korada for a wonderful elaboration of the usage.

  

This helps us understand why during गणेश न्यास we say ॥ हृदये धूम्रकेतवे नमः ॥.

  

I discussed this term and it's usage in my Book : "*GaNesha 360 - The Science of Smart Living*".

  

Surgeon general of US mandated the deceleration on all Cigarette packets, ***"Smoking is Harmful for Your Health"*** in 1969 after evidence for harmful effects associated with smoking was presented almost 7,000 research papers to the NIH after .  

  

India followed the suit sometime in 1975.

  

I regards ॥ हृदये धूम्रकेतवे नमः ॥ as the "विनियोग" by our ancestors that fits perfectly in the विघ्नकर्ता model of गणेश. After-all, all knowledge is for the living and no matter how great the philosophy it has no value after I am dead.  

  

Again thanks you for the elaborations.

  

Rgds
