Thank you Sri Kannan ji for the response. Even I had thought of smoke as the mosquito repellent. The 'nivrtti' meaning for artha is interesting. I have a question on this:

  

How do we express this in words? धूमनिवृत्त्यर्थम्? Is there not the requirement to use two 'artha's there? Even if we say धूमनिवृत्त्यै still there is the 'artha' meaning for the chaturthI there.

  

Returning to the example in the original question, will there be an apekshaa of the grass being burnt in the process which is considered as a prayojanam, though not wished for originally? In other words, will a person who has ignited fire to flush out smoke feel also relieved that some grass was also burnt out? I am still not fully able to conceive of such a situation.

  

regards
