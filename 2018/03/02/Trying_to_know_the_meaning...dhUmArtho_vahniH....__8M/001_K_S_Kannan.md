Says the *kos'a*:

*artho'bhidheye rai-vastu-prayojana-nivRttis"u*.

  

The first four senses are clear.

What does *nivRtti*, the fifth sense mean?

  

It means to repulse, to nullify.

Example : ***mas'akArtho** dhUmaH*.

You smoke mosquitoes out.

The smoke was ***for repelling*** the mosquitoes.

  

When there is *Ardrendhana-samyoga*, we have lot of *dhUma*.

On the other hand, if there is fire added to it

(by way, say, of pouring some ghee or even adding some camphor),

the smoke is 'smoked out', which is to say 'is dispelled'.

  

While your intention was doing away with smoke,

you had a by-product: the grass in the vicinity got burnt too.

Naturally.

  

Quite like

*grAmam gacchan trNam spRs'ati*,

you had an unintended action also taking place in addition.

And naturally so - i.e. without any conscious effort on your part.

  

Even so,

you bring the divinity to memory for some specific purpose,

but the unintended result - viz. warding off impediments - is also taking place.

And taking place naturally: with hardly any focus, that is, on this happening.

  

(Cf. *anicchayApi samspRs"To dahaty eva hi pAvakaH.)*

Does my explanation look too far fetched?
