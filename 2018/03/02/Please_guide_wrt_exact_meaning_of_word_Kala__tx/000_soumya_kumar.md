Respected scholars,  
  
I have doubt about one of the sutras of Jaimini Maharshi on jyotisha. In 1.1.10, he says that: आत्माधिकः कलादिभिर्नभोगः सप्तानामष्टानां वा. The problem I am facing is with the word is कलादि:. Kala as we know is minutes. However by and large all translators or commentators presume that the word minutes includes degrees. For example, Prof P S Shastri in his Jaimini Sutram says as follows:  
“Among the seven planets from the Ravi to Shani, or among the eight including Rahu, the planet which has attained the highest number of degree becomes the Atmakaraka” (Sastri, P S 2006 (Revised Edition) Ranjan Publications, New Delhi, P. 16).  
However, recently I came across an argument that the word kalA refers to just minutes and therefore only minutes have to be considered and degrees are ruled out as Jaimini has not used the word “amsa”. Can this Sutra be interpreted in this manner?  
Kindly guide as to which usage is correct and help.  
  
  
With pranams
