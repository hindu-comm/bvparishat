Dear List Members:

  

Many learned say that a samhita patha of a mantra has a power indice of 1, pada has 2 krama 4 jata has 1000 and so on. Can some one give a reference for this assertion?

  

Key question:

  

If say 100,000 japas of a mantra is required, does 1 jata or a ghana constitute 1000 or ? repetitions of the mantra or is the assertion above merely hyperbole?

  

Please clarify.

  

Also, I am not too sure of how the vikrutis above krama work can someone kindly explain the schema in lay terms?

  

Thanks,

  

Niranjan
