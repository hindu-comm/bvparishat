In prayoga, only prakritipaaTha is effective, vikritipaaTha does not count. The అర్ధ ఆదా about them being x times more powerful is for the last mixed purpose of rakshaa. Similarly, a multiplier effect is stated for japa on akshayatritiyaa, during grahaNa etc. Basis this, one cannot do a fraction of the ordained japa during this golden periods, say for a nakshatraSaanti.

  

SishTaacaara is the pramaaNa here.

N Siva Senani
