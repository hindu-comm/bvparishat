Dear List members:

  

How does one construct a sankalpa starting (mamopathha samastha duritha etc..) or are different formats of sankalpa available?

  

Also how would one construct a sankalpa citing jitendriya (conquering one's senses) and conquering hunger, lust and sleep?

  

Thanks,

  

Niranjan
