Namaste



Just focus on what the word ‘ means’ and the act associated with it is intended for as ‘ yajamanasya ishta-kaamanaa –siaddhyartham’- ‘ an act , following a procedure as prescribed in the books to accomplish the desires of the performer’:



a) \<Sam – Well, Excellent> + \< kalpa - procedure, method and system appropriate for the context and desire of the performer> .



 a-1) Kalpa – here is explained in the context of ‘ six vedangas’ which list ‘ kalpa’ as ‘ yajna- vidhi- vidhaana’.



 a-2) Sam – is explained as the upasagra and understood in Samskrutham. It also resonates with the meaning of the upasagra \< Pra>



b) If \< pra> is substituted in the place of \< Sam>, the result is \< Samkalpa = Pra-Kalpa>. Then \<prakalpa/ prakalpanaa> means the open ended desire statement of the seeker. Following the \< \> is for good of the practitioner and the society. Other wise, the outcome would be
\< raakshasa –samkalpa> ! Let the ‘Guru’ decide what is \< Sam>- \<Kalpa>:: Good desire and Procedure for the shishya.



The procedural format emerges from it. If this is to be said in a modern idiom, there is an occasion, a place and a civic culture on where to wear a Jeans and where to wear shorts ! ( A Gruhastha and Sanyasi have different formats, models and purpose in making a samkalpa).

The first word of सङ्कल्प is time and space, eg अद्य इह = अद्येह । and then toponym eg your geographical or location identity. अक्षांश and देशान्तर । then witness and other things of promise.

नमो विद्वद्भ्यः



are different formats of sankalpa available?



Also how would one construct a sankalpa citing jitendriya (conquering one's senses) and conquering hunger, lust and sleep?



                                   
    ---- Vidvan Niranjan



संकल्प has got only one format .



Why should one construct a different संकल्प than the one accepted as शिष्टाचार ?



कालः , नाम , गोत्रम् (धर्मपत्नीसमेतः) - are to be mentioned . Even if one is a यति / संन्यासी the same is the procedure .



No विशेषणs are to be added to the नाम / गोत्रम् etc.



Someone may want to add something else - then there will be अव्यवस्था ।



These issues need वेदशास्त्रप्रामाण्यम् and प्रयोजनम् ।
