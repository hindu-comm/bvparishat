Namaste

  

Sankalpa has three parts. First is Desha Kala Uccharana. You say which Desha and Kala you are situated. Second is - what is your goal? Third is - How you will reach your goal? If Jitendriyatva is your goal you also must say in Sankalpa how you will get it. In Puja we say Desha Kala first and then Chaturvidha Purushartha Siddhyartham AmukaDevataaPoojaaraadhanaKarma Karishye. In this Chaturvidha Purushartha Siddhyartham is second part. We want to get the four Purusharthas. This is the goal. AmukaDevataaPoojaaraadhanaKarma Karishye is the third part. We will get the four Purusharthas by doing the Pooja. This is how we achieve success in goal.
