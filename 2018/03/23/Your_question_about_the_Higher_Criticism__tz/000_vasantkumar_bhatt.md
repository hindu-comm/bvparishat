Dear Dr. Somnath Sarkar,

Namaste !

Thank you for your email. You are saying that "So far I know the higher criticism is the introduction and lower criticism contains the variants in case of a critical edition.", But it is not so. Any text-critic is suppose to give details about his sources of manuscripts, their numbers, size, scripts, folios etc. in the introductory part. This is, technically speaking, called "Critical Apparatus". ( This is not a higher criticism. ) Second thing :- to provide available variants in the foot-.is NOT a lower criticism ( i.e. that which is given in foot-notes /at below of a page ). But Lower criticism contains three stages,(a) Heuristics , (b) Recensio, and (c) Emendation. After a critic isdone with these 3stages, he will think something about the Intrinsic probability, peculiar style of a poet, sources of a poet & external evidences etc. before deciding the oldest / most probablevariant. - This is Higher Criticism. Here a critic should not give any weight to manuscript evidence. 1. time of manuscript, 2. numbers of manuscripts etc. ) According to my experience, one should try to find-out the "Journey of various text-traditions"first. ( = History / chronological order of available variants. And should try to go back in the past,as far as possible... near and nearer to the original. )

This is what I understand by Higher Criticism. I am open to correction,rather I will be obliged by any new = logical inputs.

May I suggest you to read my book in detail first. I hope that any question regarding the textual criticism will be clear /you will be convinced.

Thanks,

Vasant Bhatt
