Namaskar,

  

I am not clear about the relevance of the triguna theory (sattva, rajas, tamas) in Samkhya philosophy.

  

The entire development of this doctrine of trigunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) in the traditional Samkhya texts proceeds from the assumption or foundation that these gunas are a given. There is no information as to the origins or the logical development of this theory of trigunas.

  

I am not clear as to why this theory of trigunas was introduced in the first place in Samkhya. Why was it necessary to propound the triguna trifurcation of padhana/prakriti/mula prakriti/avyakta? There seems to be no logical development for this theory in a philosophy reputed to be strictly logical.

  

I am unable to reason backwards to arrive at the point of origin of this theory.

  

It also doesn't help that the definitions of gunas is also on a weak wicket. The word "guna" itself is defined in two ways at least - as " secondary strings or threads", and as "attributes or qualities". This leads to a situation of two definitions for one theory which is unsatisfactory for me. (As an aside, are you aware of any criticism the Nyaya philosophers have made regarding the theory on this point?)

  

Be that as it may, if I could get a handle on why the theory of trigunas was propounded in the first place, perhaps the situation might be clearer.

  

I would appreciate any guidance you could provide on this matter. Thank you.
