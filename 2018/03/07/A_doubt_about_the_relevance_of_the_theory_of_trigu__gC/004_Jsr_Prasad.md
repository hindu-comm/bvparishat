Sri Harsha garu,  
  

I appreciate your initial home work on the subject in question. Thanks for clarifying your further views. Good to see the interesting reply by Dr. Larson, which might have raised quest in you with regard to the very etymology of 'guna.'  
  

There could be further discussions.. however, it is appropriate to respect your response and I too stop here.  
  

Best regards,  

Prasad
