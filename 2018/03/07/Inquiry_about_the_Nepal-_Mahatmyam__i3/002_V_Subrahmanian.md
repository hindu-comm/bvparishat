The following book contains a foreword by a venerable scholar Vidwan Sri Rajeswara Sastri Dravida, the maternal grandfather of Vidwan Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal. I am told that he was a very accomplished scholar in the Nyaya Darshana, had authored a few books, edited many others and brought to light a few books that had never been published.
