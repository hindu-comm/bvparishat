Sir,

  

I did listen to the excellent arguments put by Mishra ji for exposing the shallowness and hollowness of Devdutta Pattnayak,a totally misled and misinformed scholar,who is systematically misleading the general innocent masses to believe in him and his so.called scholarship in Mythology, Puranas and Sanskrit Literature in general. We need scholars like Nityanand to uphold our culture and traditions against the onslaught by the westerners and their blind Indian followers.

Thanks for this link.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
