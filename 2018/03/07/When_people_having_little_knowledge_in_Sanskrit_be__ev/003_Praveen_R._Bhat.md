Thank you, Nityananda Mahodaya,

  

Its unfortunate that today even nonsense (असम्प्रदायविन्मूर्खवदुपेक्षणीयः) cannot be ignored and has to be refuted by scholars, because the masses get fooled otherwise! I liked what you said "its so funny that its tragic". Of course, the intention of such people is suspect too.
