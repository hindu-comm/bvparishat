Namaste

 The discussion seems to be on a perceived difference of (i) svaras in Vedic and Tantric systems ( ii) lacking clarity on what 'svara' stands for. The other dimension is use of inappropriate colonial model of 'sanskrit' imposed on Vedanga- Vyakarana' studies and practice.

1. 'Svara' , by technical connotation ( nirukta/ nirukti) is 'svato raajante'- self standing, self illuminating, unique units of vak. 

1.1. Svaras are part of 'varna' total set of Vak: Yoga-Samskrutham (varNa-samAnaaya, varNa-akshara -samaanaaya, varNa-maalaa)- (varnaH svaraH; mAtrA balaM). 

**1.2. This technicality will be understood by contemplating on why ' Maheswara Sutras' are called ' Pratyaahaara' generators. **

The term ' pratyaahaara' is not just for making cryptic formulae as 'samjnaa' in Vedanga Vyakarana.

 1.3. The term 'pratyaahaara' is fifth step of yogaanga; and Vyakarana is Vedanga and also Yogaanga in Vangmayama tapah (Gita 17-15).

1.4. Colonial and Oriental models of teaching, research and translation of language/s regulated by Paninian grammar studies using
sanitization ( dismembering/

disconnection) of 'language' from ' (Yoga and Yogaanga) - (Veda and Vednaga)' does not lead to the understanding of practice instructions from texts of Veda or Tantra.

1.5. This unified guidance of Vedanga- Yogaanga for study of 'Samskrutham', used in tradition for millennia is called ' muni-traya' -Vedic tradition. This is authorized from the

vedic mindfulness yoga-meditation guidance and techniques in aitarēya brāhmaṇa (3-1 to 4), śākala saṁhitā of Rig-Veda. 'Vang-me manasi pratishthitaa'.

 1.6. The term ' muni' is a part of the ' vedic-yoga' sampradaya. (Gita: Chapter 5: Karma-yoga - sparsan krtva bahir bahyamscaksus caivantare bhruvoh; pranapanau samau

krtva nasabhyantara-carinau ( 5-27) yatendriya-mano-buddhir **munir moksa-parayanah** vigateccha-bhaya-krodho **yah sada mukta eva sah** (5-28). 

There is deep connection of gita (17-15)and Patanjali yoga sutra (2-29: yama niyama-asana pranayama **pratyahara** dharana dhyana samadhayo-'shtavangani \|\|29\|\|).

1.7. 'Pratyaahaara, is prescription after Praanaayama'. When 'Pranayama' in current yoga -practice is limited to the practice of ' nasal breath regulation', using limited

translation of 'prana= air / oxygen' connotation, the higher level of 'Prana in Vak' needed for 'Tantra- Practice' will never get revealed.

1.8. What will be 'Vak / uccharana' in ' pratyaahaara' mode of yogaanga- vedanga ? This is 'Tantra' guidance which a guru teaches a shishya, depending upon the need.

1.9. Such instruction and practice helps practitioner to consciously control, regulate and modify Body internal functionality by status and energy.

This gets reflected in tangible measures of breath rate change, blood sugar changes, Blood oxygen, pulse change, neural signal transmissions, brain waves, perceived release

of stress in body and mind leading to relaxation. This is outcome of modern research of MRI and other bio-medical studies on yoga-practitioners of different brands ( mainly

TM) over forty years. Popularly known as Mantra-Yoga- Meditation research ! The social benefit of Spiritual Vedic Tradiitons/ the vedic religiosity/ the faith -practice/ the

karma-kanda.

1.10. The advanced practices here leads to the next stages of ' ashta siddhi's' which are considered by scientists as ' violation of natures laws / miracles' ! But for Yoga

deliberation, this is just a small segment of 'Yoga-Prayoga- Viniyoga' covered in third chapter of Patanjali Yoga sutras. Modern medical-science research and current Yoga -

 studio model instructions are still in the limits of
'baahya-prayatna' phase of body-posture- breath regulation model Yoga.

So the teaching of Veda- Tantra stays far beyond the reach of current tools of language used for deliberating/ translating the texts of tradition. 

The use of the advanced terms of Veda-Tantra for lower level practices is ' arhta-vaada' in sanskrit!

The English term proximate to this is: euphony (noun; plural: euphonies) - the quality of being pleasing to the ear. The tendency to make phonetic change for ease of

pronunciation. ( usage: "the poet put euphony before mere factuality")

 1.11. The understanding of 'svara-varna' and their 'krama-vishesha' depends upon the layer of consciousness from where one is operating. The chanting of rudra-prashna

carries the reference for this understanding, especially for krama-patha of veda ( naarudrah krama paathakah). 

**1.12. The tag of consciousness layer associated with the \< varNa svara-mAtrA> decides the \< bala- atibala> :: the strength and effort of the 'svara'. **

The differences in strength and effort are also associated with 'sthAna-prayatna' in shareera and manas.

In shareera, it is ' Praana- Vayu ' movement of organs, neural signal strength et al. In manas, it is 'vivakshaa- vivakshita-artha ' intention and purpose of articulation.

If the intention is to articulate the vision of Truth (satya darshana , say as you see/ saw/ as heard), it is shruti, vedic.

If the intention is to use the 'VEDA-Shruti' for a human intended purpose of matter-transformation, it is application; it is technique; it is Tantra.

 **1.13.** **If 'Veda' is ' Vision by Yoga', Tantra is application for benefit, the Utility- Application ( Viniyoga)'.**

This is one of the key points that Dr. Yadu keeps repeating in his posts about the proper utilization of Samskruth.

This is the vedic directive from Shaunaka, Yaksa : avidita -aarsheya- chando -daivattani mantrani... **paapeeyaan bhavati** ....sthanurayam bhaarahaarah,...yatha kharah chandana

bhaaravaahee...'.

 **1.14:** This key directive is Totally, intentionally violated in colonial model works of translation, teaching and claimed research.
This has not been addressed for reclaim by

Guru-Kuls. This is not questioning the premise of modern research.

This is request for review of propriety and appropriateness of current Sanskrit- language -research tools, which seem like use of
straw where the need is for a spoon.

**Prof. Koradas several posts on Veda- Vedanga , Jyotisha as Vedanga, highlight and endorse this position which is anchor of traditional studies. **



I hope this helps.
