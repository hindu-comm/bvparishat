Respected Scholars:

  

How is ‘ Viniyoga’ (Utility aspect not just "vidhi-vidhaana") connected with the Karma (Action) in Sandhyavandanam?

As I understand, Sandhyavandanam is a ‘nitya karma’. Especially in the light of current discussion of "gaayati japa"  

  

Thank you all in advance  

  

Dr Yadu
