In order to try to maintain the focus for my query;

  

I am trying to understand difference between two expressions in sandhyavandanam – ‘ which starts with ‘ aham ( brahma- karma) karishye’ \[= I undertake this action related to Brahma \] and then progressively leading to the mantra japa part where the gaayatri-japa meditation
statement is with the instruction and intent as ‘ mantra- jape - viniyogah’ . Hope, scholars will elaborate on the aspects; but not from this focus of ‘progressive set of instructions with in one act of Sandhyavandanam’.

Thx

  

Dr Yadu
