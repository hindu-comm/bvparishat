Thank you for for those pointers !  
By fluency, I also meant to include original, creative writing in sanskrit.  
Also I assume that the kaumudi is a proper subset of the ashtadhyayi  
so all your observations are equally valid and applicable for the  
same.  
Given what you have explained so far, generally speaking (outside of  
my goals), what benefits (direct or indirect) does the mastery of  
Ashtadhyayi offer ?  
Is it for knowing how the language itself is engineered, and other  
such abstract theoretical purposes ?
