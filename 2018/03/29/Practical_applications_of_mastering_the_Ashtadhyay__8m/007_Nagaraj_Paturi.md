Yes, it has enormous other intellectual benefits.

  

Any discipline modern or ancient , western or Indian should be learnt /taught for giving the brain the training of a rigorous thinking /reasoning method, That training can be used creatively in problem-solving in the fields beyond the one from where they are learnt /taught.

  

From this perspective Ashtadhyayi provides a highly rigorous method of 1. Sutra system typical of Indian S'aastras 2. highest degree of brevity in articulating description in general, linguistic description in particular. 3. complex recursion methods of coding required for such extremely concise description 4. a very good brain-drill of executing a machine-like mathematically accurate razor-sharp derivation routines etc.

  

The same mastery acquired through Mahabhashya adds an ocean of philosophical depth to this understanding.

  

When the summary of the spirit behind this whole tradition namely Vaakyapadiyam gets added to this, an ecstasy of exuberance of spiritual experience of linguistic introspection and extrospection!!
