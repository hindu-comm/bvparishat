Sir,

  

Are not the words 'pustakam, granthah,etc', and the depiction of Saraswati as pustakapaani, etc. evidences of the practice of writing/printing/embossing, etc. for the earliest times? The Bhagavatam has Rukmini writing a letter to Krishna. Of course the Bhagavatam could be argued to be of a much later origin. We could look for evidences for occurrences for words like pustakam, etc. lekhanam, the dhaatu for writing, etc. in works like the Mahabharata. Humorous statements such as 'Brahma's lalaata lekhanam' etc. are also in this group.

  

'गीती शीघ्री.....तथा लिखितपाठकः...' is a verse on the wrong way of the vedic student. Is this verse also of later origin? We may search.
