**Dear colleagues.**

**It appears that there might have been some mis-understanding of my deposition. I made a suggestion without any urge to accept it and to reject any other view. The fact that one sees pusta- instead of puÀ¶a raised some doubt in me. Contrast duÅ +ta> duÀ¶a, ku+stha \> kuÀ¶ha. This raises doubt about whether pustaka is at all a vyutpanna or avyutpanna word. A loan word may not follow any P¡¸inian rule; from the P¡¸inian point of view it is as good as an avyutpanna word. **

**In any case the suggestion had been meant to give a solution. There Is no**

**intention of rejecting others’ view or any urge to accept my view.**

**It may be recalled that Sanskritists find it difficult to explain the word *hindu*.**

**Some have suggested h¢n¡n d£Àayati iti hindu. Acceptable ? As is**

**wellknown the word occurs in Old Persian inscriptions in the sense of Indian.**

**With thanks and regards **

**DB**
