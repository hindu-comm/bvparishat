All the statement "..

Pāṇini solely deals with the spoken language. We don't even surely know ifwritingwas in vogue during Pāṇini's time. Perhaps, in the contextof the written language, the word 'virāma' carries some extra meaning which is out of the scope of Pāṇini's grammar. .." is a gross misconception.
