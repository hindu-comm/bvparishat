"bindu" is similarly an otherwise difficult Sanskrita word. According to one view, hindu and bindu both are mutations of "indu" - one mutation happened outside the subcontinent, the other within; further, some other branches of IE kept designating the inhabitants of the subcontinent as "Indians" that is closer to the original "indu".
