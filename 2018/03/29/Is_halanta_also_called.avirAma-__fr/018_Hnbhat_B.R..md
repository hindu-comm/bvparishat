I think Depro's question is related with the signs of hal without vowel in Devanagari script like क् for k and he calls it halant sighn and viram is used for the sighn for fullstop/danda in devanagari. I have not seen anywhere these two confused. Virama is not used for 'virama' sign as no commentator has commented as such any sanjna as relating to script and in particular script. It is not certain whether Devanagari script was in use at the time of Panini if he wrote Ashtadhyayi.

  

"The Nagari script has roots in the ancient[*Brāhmī*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C4%81hm%C4%AB_script "Brāhmī script")script family.^([\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#cite_note-6))Some of the earliest epigraphical evidence attesting to the developing Sanskrit Nagari script in ancient India, in a form similar to Devanagari, is from the 1st to 4th century CE inscriptions discovered in[Gujarat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat "Gujarat").^([\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#cite_note-gazett-1))The Nagari script was in regular use by the 7th century CE and it was fully developed by about the end of first millennium.^([\[4\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#cite_note-kathleen-4)[\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#cite_note-salomon1000-7))The use of Sanskrit in Nagari script in medieval India is attested by numerous pillar and cave temple inscriptions, including the 11th-century Udayagiri inscriptions in[Madhya Pradesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh "Madhya Pradesh"),^([\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#cite_note-8))and an inscribed brick found in[Uttar Pradesh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh "Uttar Pradesh"), dated to be from 1217 CE, which is now held at the British Museum.^([\[9\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#cite_note-9))"
