Namaḥ Abhyaṅkara-mahodayāya,

  

Thanks for sharing this essay. But the arguments could not still satisfy me. Anusvāra and ma-kāra are not just written with two different characters,they are actually two different sounds. And, the orthographical 'avagraha' mark is not mentioned by Pāṇini. In old manuscripts, we hardly find this symbol. I would be glad to see some stronger arguments in support of the antiquity of Sanskrit/Prakrit writing.

  

Regards,

दीप्रः
