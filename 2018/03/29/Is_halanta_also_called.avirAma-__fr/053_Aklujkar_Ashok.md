As indicated earlier, I will not extend the present thread.

  

I have not yet understood if Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya wishes to refute statements made in my first post in the thread. If he indeed wishes to refute, he may do so, privately or on the forum. I will be happy to get his thoughts on Indo-European and/or Indo-Iranian linguistics.

  

With good wishes to you both,

  

a.a.
