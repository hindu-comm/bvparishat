'Indic scripts : script-symbol names are the same as the phonemes denoted by the script symbols'  

  

Is the same not true of the virama symbol too. How has it got mixed with the halanta marking?

  

Can the sutra तपरस्तत्कालस्य provide an answer.

  

For example what is the difference between phonating

तक तऽक्

A halant marking need not mean or in fact does not mean a virama. The two are quite different both in purpose and phonation.
