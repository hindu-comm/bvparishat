Namo vidvadbhyaḥ,

  

According to the Sanskrit-English dictionaries by Monier Williams, virāma is "*Name of*a small oblique stroke placed under a consonant to denote that it is quiescent *id est*that it has no vowel inherent or otherwise pronounced after it (this mark is sometimes used in the middle of conjunctions of consonants;but its proper use, according to native grammarians, is only as a stop at the end of a sentence ending in a consonant".Apte also mentions it as "A small oblique stroke placed under a consonant, usually at the end of a sentence".

  

This is there in the [Devanāgarī Unicodetable](http://unicode.org/charts//PDF/Unicode-4.0/U40-0900.pdf) too.

  

The word 'halanta' is a typical Pāṇinian term and therefore may not be universally accepted. I wonder if there is any reference to the term 'virāma' in the sense of 'halanta' in any texts or traditions.

  

It would be nice to know what this symbol is called in other languages. It is called 'hasanta' in Bengali, probably because of the popularity of Vopadeva's Mugdhabodha in which the initial and the final consonants are listed as 'h' and 's' respectively.

  

Regards,

Deepro
