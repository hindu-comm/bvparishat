Namaḥ Abhyaṅkaramahodayāya,

  

Thank you so much for this nice explanation. But I was more concerned about the use of the word 'virāma' as the 'halanta' sign.

  

'Halanta' is a widely popular term for this symbol in North India (Ihave noidea what it is traditionally called in South India). But people studying the scripts in Europe call it 'virāma'. I found that many of them don't even know that this symbol is called 'halanta' or 'hasanta'. Some English and German Sanskrit grammar books call the symbol 'virāma' only. But in North and East India, we hardly use the term 'virāma' to refer to the glyph.

  

Regards,

दीप्रः
