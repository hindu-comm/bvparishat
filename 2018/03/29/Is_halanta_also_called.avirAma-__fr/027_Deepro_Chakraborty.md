I think we can hardly find anything about the script in Sanskrit grammar which is entirely silent about the written form of the language. Inscriptions and manuscripts would also be of no help as these do not refer to the name of graphical symbols. There must be some base for the usage of this term 'virāma' as 'halanta'/'hasanta'because the dictionaries and Sanskrit grammar texts written in European languages and the Unicode charts of all Indic scripts all support this.

  

I just checked the [Unicode charts](http://unicode.org/charts/) of some of theBrāhmic scripts. In almost every case, the sign is mentioned as Virāma. Sometimes specific appellations are mentioned too. Here are the preferred names mentioned there:

Devanāgarī --> halant

Telugu --> halant

Modi--> halant

Kannada --> halant

Tirhuta --> halant

Bengali --> hasanta

Newari --> tutisaalaa

Malayalam --> candrakkala

Tamil --> pulli

  

In case of Śāradā, Gujarati, Grantha, Gurmukhi, Odiya, Khudawadi, Bhaikṣukī, Saurashtra, Takri and Siddham, only the word 'virāma' is mentioned.  

  

In case of the following scripts the term 'virāma' is mentioned as an alternative

Sinhalese --> al-lakuna

Syloti Nagari --> hasanta(here the terms 'halant' and 'virāma' both are given as alternatives)

Batak --> Panongonan

Sundanese --> Pamaaeh (there is another separate symbol which is called virama)

Javanese --> Pangkon(here the term virāma is given as an alternative)

  

Interestingly, in case of Khmer, the sign is called Viriam (very close to Sanskrit virāma) although this symbol is mostly obsolete today. Thai Character Phinthu is somewhat similar to this virāma and according to the Unicodechart, Phinthu is called 'virāma' in Pāli.
