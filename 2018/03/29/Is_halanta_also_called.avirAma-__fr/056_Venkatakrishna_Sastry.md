Namaste

  

The Paninian Grammar argument prescribing the pratyaya '  '  -
seems to have been drawn too much out of orbit in these arguments.

  

Professor A.A. seems to have pinned the argument in

\<I was questioning the validity of Mayrhofer’s (half-heartedly) acceptedconclusion that pustaka was of Iranian origin \> .

  

Is there any difficulty in giving some credibility to the fact that Samskruth Vocabulary could and did exist on its own merits and without any need for

' borrowals' ?

And even where it had a need to borrow, the base term would be accepted as raw input for ' further processing'; not left as it was introduced 

\<Sanskrit etymology but has pre-Sanskrit etymology. \> needs to show the entire process of prakruti -pratayay- prakriyaa consistent with the known usage. ?

where did any one set a rule for free wheeling addition -split of the ' Taddhita prataya' ??

  

My reasoning noted below:

  

Would appreciate scholars to critique this:  

  

a\) 'Pustaka' - as a ' prakrtui shabda' ( = given word) in the meaning of a 'book'  is prevalent in usage; and not questioned for its further break down or loan from other languages !

b\) Sarasvati stotra ( undated obviously enough, but usage goes to at least few hundred years ) contains the usage of pustaka as a ' document ( book or grantha) - माला पुस्तक -धारिणीम् .

c\) Subhashita usage ' पुस्तकस्था तु या विद्या , मस्तकस्था न चेत् यदि .....does not make any confusion on the split of मस्त -क ;

  Nor does similar words -  तिलक ( face mark ) as तिल (sesame seeds) -क ( related)  , तक्षक ( serpent by that name) -तक्ष ( carving, wood cutter) -क ( related) ; जंबुक जम्बु- क

d\) Dictionary listing shows it as a full prakruti and not as a derivative .
