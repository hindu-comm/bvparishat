Dear Prof. Nagaraj Paturi,

  

I accept that I did not dig much into the recent studies in this field. I should have obviously done that. However, my actual question was not related to the antiquityof writing in India.

I incidentally became curious about it intending a shortcut way (without studying the literature).

  

Regards,

Deepro
