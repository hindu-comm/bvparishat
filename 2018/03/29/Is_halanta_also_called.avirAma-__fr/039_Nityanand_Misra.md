In Hindi, the symbol is called हलन्त commonly. At my school, Hindi and Sanskrit teachers would say "म के नीचे हलन्त लगाओ" etc. I have also heard "हल् का चिह्न" being used, which I find a more precise expression and hence I use it. So when I was teaching Sanskrit to a grade V student using Hindi as the language of instruction in 2016, I would say "म के नीचे हल् का चिह्न लगाओ".
