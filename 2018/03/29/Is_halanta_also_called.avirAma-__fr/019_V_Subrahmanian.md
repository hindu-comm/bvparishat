There are old documents running to several pages, whole books, in Devanagari without the 'danda' type of punctuation anywhere. It would look like that end to end it is just one loooong sentence! Maybe that was the style in which people wrote those days. I have often wondered as to how indeed readers made the correct sense, the vivaksha, of the author, out of such documents.
