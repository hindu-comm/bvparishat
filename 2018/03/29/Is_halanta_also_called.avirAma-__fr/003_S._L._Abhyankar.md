नमस्ते दीप्रो-चक्रवर्ती-महोदय !

  

There is a सूत्रम् विरामोऽवसानम् (1'4'110) which gives some meaning to whatविराम is.

  

As you have rightly pointed out, in Apte's dictionaryविरामः 1 (*a*) Cessation, discontinuance; सुधां विना न प्रययुर्विरामम् Bh.2.8; प्रवृत्तस्याविरामे भवन्ती शासितव्या Mbh. (*b*) Rest, repose.**-2**End, termination, conclusion; आरामः कल्पवृक्षाणां विरामः सकलापदाम् Rāma-rakṣā.16; रजनिरिदानीभियमपि याति विरामम् Gīt.5; U.3.16; Māl.9.34.**-3**Pause, stop.**-4**The stop or pause of the voice; वर्णानामपि मूर्च्छनान्तरगतं तारं विरामे मृदुम् Mk.3.5.**-5**A small oblique stroke placed under a consonant, usually at the end of a sentence

  

Connecting this with what is mentioned at the link given by you,

094D $Õ DEVANAGARI SIGN VIRAMA = halant (the preferred Hindi name) • suppresses inherent vowel  

it seems it matches well with the above meaning in dictionary. The sign makes the हल् end there itself, makes the हल्experience the अन्त.

Usual interpretationof हलन्त as in हलन्तः शब्दः is हल् अन्ते यस्य सः हलन्तः (शब्दः) by बहुव्रीहि-विग्रहः. But here हलन्तः is हलः अन्तः इति हलन्तः (षष्ठी-तत्पुरुषः) So विरामः is that चिह्नम् which signifies अवसानम् of a हल्, hence gives no scope to add any vowel. Inबहुव्रीहि-विग्रहःहलन्तis adjectival. Byषष्ठी-तत्पुरुष-विग्रहः it becomes a noun, name of theविराम-चिह्नम्.

  

So whetherहलन्त is to be taken with its adjectival meaning or as a noun, will depend on the type ofविग्रह applicable in the context.

  

I would think that your question should be read as asking, NOT whatविरामः is, but asking whatहलन्त is. And certainly there are two different meanings ofहलन्त, as adjective and as noun.
