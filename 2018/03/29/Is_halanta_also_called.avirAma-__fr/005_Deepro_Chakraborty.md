Dear Prof Bhattacharya,

  

Thank you very much for your explanation. I fully understand that the term 'virāma' used by Pāṇini has nothing to do with the graphical symbols. Pāṇini solely deals with the spoken language. We don't even surely know ifwritingwas in vogue during Pāṇini's time. Perhaps, in the contextof the written language, the word 'virāma' carries some extra meaning which is out of the scope of Pāṇini's grammar.

  

Regards,

Deepro
