‘Is there any study of how phonetic entities were resolved into epigraphic structures by the ancients. Moresoever when we cannot recreate how the ancients spoke? Have any evolutionary studies been made in this regard?’



Standard and recognised studies were made by Diringer. G.S.Ojha, A.H.Dani and others.

The Brahmi script originated in the Phoenician script. It is surmised that traders who went to Babylon invented the Brahmi script in the 8^(th) century BC. Monier Williams’ Sanskrit English Dictionary shows the similarity of Asokan Brahmi with the 8^(th) Cent BC Phoenician script.
