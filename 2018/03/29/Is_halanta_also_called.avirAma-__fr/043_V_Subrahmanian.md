I am pleasantly surprised by a word 'suutra' in the image given in the post by Ashok ji, in the meaning of the word 'pustakam'. This is because, in Tamil, the literary, very old, word for a book is: nool (நூல்). In Tamil, this word also means a 'thread'. We now enter into another similarity: In the Brahma sutra bhashya

Shankaracharya says, at the very beginning, for the very second sutra:
वेदान्तवाक्यकुसुमग्रथनार्थत्वात्सूत्राणाम् । वेदान्तवाक्यानि हि सूत्रैरुदाहृत्य विचार्यन्ते । He is using the word 'sutra' (Brahmasutra) to mean a 'thread' that connects, puts together, ties together, the Vedanta (Upanishad) vaakyas. While the Brahma

sutras have come to give us the nirnaya of vaakyas wherever samshaya is there, the 'tying' them into a garland to make it a one complete book is evident. And we also know that a 'grantha' is that which

is a 'bundle' of ideas tied up into a whole.

  

Thus we have the words 'pustakam', sutra, nool (Tamil) thread, book, grantha, etc. all meaning ultimately the same entity.
