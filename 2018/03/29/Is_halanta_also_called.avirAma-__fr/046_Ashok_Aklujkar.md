Dear Prof. Bhattacharya,

  

I did not say or suggest thata word of Iranian origin is not a loanword (at least in the context of present knowledge and generally accepted systematization/classification, Iranian would be foreign and a possible source of loans).

  

I was questioning the validity of Mayrhofer’s (half-heartedly) acceptedconclusion that pustaka was of Iranian origin—a conclusion you unqualifiedly or confidently accepted/articulated.

  

If you can give convincing reasons in support of the conclusion and establish that confidence is indeed warranted, I would have no problem in saying that pustaka is a word of non-Sanskritic origin (= is a loan word in Sanskrit).

  

Best wishes.

  

a.a.
