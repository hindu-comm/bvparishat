Is there any study of how phonetic entities were resolved into epigraphic structures by the ancients. Moresoever when we cannot recreate how the ancients spoke? Have any evolutionary studies been made in this regard?



As far as Sanskrit is concerned the phonetic entities had been individually resolved thus to resolve these entities into script seems obvious. However man does not innovate without need. As far as Sanskrit is concerned when was this need felt. Surely this need was felt when literary material could no longer be composed in verse.



Why no reference has been made to Sutra विरामोवसानाम as yet? Is the word virama being used in this post anything to do with the Sutra?
