Dear Colleague.

Does not the statement “virāma is the ‘Name ofa small oblique stroke placed under a consonant to denote that it is quiescent *id est*that it has no vowel” require modification. The Paninian definition *vi¡mo* ’*vas¡nam *has nothing to do with the written stroke. It means the final consonant in speech that is oral.

Best
