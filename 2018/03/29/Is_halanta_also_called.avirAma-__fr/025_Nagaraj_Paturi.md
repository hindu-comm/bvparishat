It is not certain whether Pāṇini used writing for the composition of his work, though it is generally agreed that he knew of a form of writing, based on references to words such as*[lipi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipi "Lipi")*("script") and*lipikara*("scribe") in section 3.2 of the*Aṣṭādhyāyī*.^([\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#cite_note-solomon11-23)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#cite_note-24)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#cite_note-25)[\[note 2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#cite_note-32))
