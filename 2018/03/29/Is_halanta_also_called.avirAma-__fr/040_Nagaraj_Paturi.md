\>It would be nice to know what this symbol is called in other languages. It is called 'hasanta' in Bengali, probably because of the popularity of Vopadeva's Mugdhabodha in which the initial and the final consonants are listed as 'h' and 's' respectively.

  

It is called pulli in Tamil. Pulli is a dot. Halanta in Tamil is in the form of a dot on the symbol of a consonant. Interestingly, in this script it does not (only) occur at the end of a word. It is used for the purpose of denoting the previous consonants of a cluster (also).

  

The name is as old as Tolkappiyam.

  

Iravatham Mahadevan, an Indian epigraphist, argues that epigraphy sets an[upper limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_post_quem "Terminus post quem")of around the 7thcentury CE on the date of the Tolkappiyam, on the basis that the Tolkappiyam is familiar with the use of the*puḷḷi*– a diacritical mark to distinguish pure consonants from consonants with aninherent vowel– which does not occur in inscriptions before that time.  

  

In Telugu, it is called pollu (probably pollu \< pulli)

  

But in Telugu, it is not required in the middle of a word as in Tamil. It is found at the end of the words only. It is in the form of the common top portion of the following : వ్ న్ ల్

It is found in very ancient inscriptions (6th /7th Century CE) too of course, in an older shape.
