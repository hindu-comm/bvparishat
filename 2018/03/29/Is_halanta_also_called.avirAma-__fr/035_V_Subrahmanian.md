There is also a widely held belief that Veda Vyasa had Ganesha as his scribe and there are stories about this too. While some say that this is not in all the editions of Mahabharata, yet many, even the Madhva school subscribes to the belief. This, if true, can be an evidence for writing being very old, even much earlier than BCE.
