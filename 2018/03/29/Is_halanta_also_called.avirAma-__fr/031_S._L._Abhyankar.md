भाषासु शब्दविज्ञानम् इत्यस्मिन् विषये विचारयति मम मनसि आगतौ द्वौ विचारौ diphthongs तथा conjoint consonants. गूगलन्वेषणे प्राप्यते

-   Diphthong =>
    

    

    a sound formed by the combination of two vowels in a single
    syllable, in which the sound begins as one vowel and moves towards
    another (as in*coin*,*loud*, and*side*).

    

    

    

    -   

        

        

        a digraph representing the sound of a diphthong or single vowel
        (as in*feat*).

        

        

        

    -   

        

        

        a compound vowel character; a ligature (such as*æ*)

        

        

        

    
-   The automatically assumed inherent vowel in a consonant may be
    nullified by adding a vowel-suppression marker or by
    constructing*conjoint consonants*where a consonant gives up the
    inherent vowel by ligaturing to another consonant  

Can we find अष्टाध्यायी-सूत्राणि detailingthese concepts both in speech and writing. Actually the speech aspect is very much clear in allसूत्र-s relating to अच्-सन्धयः, हल्-सन्धयः and विसर्ग-सन्धयः. What remains to be explored is the writing aspect.
