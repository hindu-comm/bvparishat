Can we make such an unqualified/confident statement? Note*Wahrscheinlich*‘probably’, etc. in Mayrhofer’s \_KEWA\_ summation reproduced below. Secondly, accepting early Iranian evidence as necessarily coming before early Sanskritic evidence is a questionable procedure at least until the arguments made by Talageri (\_The Rigveda and the Avesta: The Final Evidence\_, 2008\], Kazanas, Elst, et al. are fairly refuted. What I have seen so far from Witzel, et al. amounts only to ducking, obfuscating and discrediting through such general remarks as ‘X does not hold an academic position at an institutiion of higher learning’ — as if holding such a position alone or necessarily makes one a good historian (this is not to say that some amateur or part-time historians do not deserve such brushing aside), The only scholar who has truly engaged with the non-main-stream scholars is probably Hans H. Hock, but he usually addresses only a small part of the argument or a relatively minor detail in the argument made by Talageri, et al. His examination leads to a more detailed or sophisticated discussion, but not to any refutation of the opponents’ central argument.

  

The syllable ka at the end of pustaka can be alpārthe or svārthe. What remains of the word, namely pusta, does not come across as a non-Sanskritic form; cf. asta (with several prefixes), ā-yasta, śasta, hasta, srasta, dhvasta, ā-śvasta, etc. The only remaining problem with *pusta* then would be about the intended meaning of *pus* or the grammatical meaning/function of*ta.*Uncertainty or diversity of scholarly opinion regarding that will not necessarily make the basic word form non-Sanskritic, especially when that form has attracted a well-attested Sanskrit suffix -ka.

  

Please note that I am not saying that there are no language families or that all comparative-historical linguistics is unreliable. I greatly value the achievements of comparative-historical linguistics. We need more Sanskritists like Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya who are aware of them. However, not everything in comparative-historical linguistics should be accepted as settled. Several conclusions seem, in particular, to suffer from circularity.

  

Given my other commitments and limited competence, i will desist from further discussion, but I hope others will give us the benefit of a critical re-examination of Indo-European/Indo-Iranian linguistics as it pertains to history of Sanskrit.
