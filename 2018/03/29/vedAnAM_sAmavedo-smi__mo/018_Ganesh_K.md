Dear Acyut Sir,  
Humble request if you are interested in serious research and study on sama,please learn it guru mukha. You will easily realise that the blind western theory that sama is derived out of changing the ways of chanting Rk , itself will be bursted easily when you see it in practical application. Eg. The same Rk in Gaushuukta and aashvasuuktaa calls agni and shukra seperatly through its nidhanastobha while residing inside the aindrakaanda . How different the meaning and application can be when it gets sung as per the tradition laid down!.  
Best regards,  
Ganesh K.
