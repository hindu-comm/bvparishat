Dear Sir,

  

Could you kindly provide direct or circumstantial evidence from Samhita, BrahmaNa and other Vedic texts to your inference that Soma juice is intoxicating. Are there references to abnormal behaviour among the hotr, adhvaryu, udgatr or other participants after Soma drinking?

Thanks

RN Iyengar
