Shree Krishna himself was ''Sam Vedi ". In Chandogya Upanishad allusion of Shree Krishna '' Krishna, son of Devki, had gone to Ghor Angiras Rushi, who told Krishna one vidyā " This son of Devki is Shree Krishna. Chandogya Upanishad is part of Sam Ved.  
One more interesting thing is, in Gita Bhagwan Shree Krishna said ' वृष्णीनां वासुदेवोऽस्मि'' means historical Shree Krishna is also a part (अंश) of Gita's Bhagwan Shree Krishna. There will be no meaning if we took both same.  

  
Acharya Vinobaji expalin this as '' there is more semantics to word ऋक , यजुस & साम as ज्ञान ,कर्म & भक्ती ."  

बृहत साम is called great among what ever सामे in Sam Veda.Two Shloka's of बृहत साम are from *Rigveda. बृहत means big, large but it is only वाच्यार्थ .But what is लक्ष्यार्थ or गूढार्थ ?  
साम = समत्व = भक्ती लक्षण ,  
बृहत साम = ब्रह्म साम्य = To look every one ब्रह्मस्वरूप .*
