'What I am trying to understand is the reasoning "WHY !?" as justification for the statement?'

  

The answer to the question 'why' is crucial. 

  

I tried to give an answer. However it appears that that scholars have opined that it is too amateurish to be taken seriously.

  

Is it not widely accepted that the Sanskrit alphabet is the most exhaustive? If this be the case has the Sama Vedic recitation not added a new dimension to the alphabet.  We need to be aware that Sama Vedic recitation is not singing as we concieve it today. Each of the note except for the flat and the sharp notes of the octave have been defined in the Yagnyavalka Shiksha. I have not only reiterated it but have taken ita step further to include the flat and the sharp notes.
Further I have also tried to explain how notes are produced with the help of the human voice in continuation of the the phonation of the Rik alphabet.

It is possibly for this reason that the Geeta opines that Sama is superior to Rik.
