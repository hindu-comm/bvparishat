In the past I had discussed on this forum the parimAna rule which says:  
One word of Veda = One sentence of Upanishads = One upAkhyAna of Purana.  
  
Gita as we know, though a part of Purana, is designed at a higher resolution matching that of the Upanishads.  
  
So, Gita's parimana is "sentence level". This means that when Krishna says वेदानां सामवेदोऽस्मि, he only means, "I am the best".  
  
Since Gita isn't designed at word level parimana, it is pointless to ask :  
"How is Samaveda the best among the Vedas?"
