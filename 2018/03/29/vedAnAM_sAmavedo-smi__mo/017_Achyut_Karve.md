----------------------------------------THIS TOO IS NOT A POST ---------------------------------

  

The fact that the Ruchas of the Rig Veda form the Sama Veda itself
signifies that the reason for the statement"वेदानां सामवेदोऽस्मि"
lies in the recitation and hence in the phonetic aspect of the Sama Veda recitation..

  

1)  the internal effort remains the same, i.e., air is expelled with the help of the diaphragmatic air expulsion mechanism and the tongue is drawn backward while sounding the various musical notes.   

  

*This is an important aspect of Vocal Indian Classical Music too.  The Nabhi or naval is said to be the place from where speech sounds emanate.*

  

2)  What happens when a अण् vowel is lengthened? When a अण् vowel is lengthened the time interval between voicing two successive letters becomes twice that of the time interval needed to voice a short vowel and hence the ear in addition to appreciating it as a lingual vowel can also appreciate it as a musical note.

*  
*

3)* * it was found that all the lengthened अण् vowels are phonated from their respective velar places*.*

*  
*

*The migration of the अण् vowelswhen lengthenedfrom their pharyngeal position to their velar position is unique to Sanskrit. The place of constriction at the time of sounding the long vowels shifts from the pharynx to the velar.. (I hope this answers your where?) The Velar has only four points where the long vowels can be voiced. The places of phonation of each letter have been dealt with in detail in the main body of the book.*

*  
*

4)  Indian Classical Music uses modulation of lengthened vowels to produce different notes.

    Shloka 7 of Yadnyavalkiya Shiksha -- उच्चौ निषाद गांधारौ नीचावृषभधैवतौ शेषास्तु स्वरिताज्ञेया:षड्जमध्यमपंचमा. Such modulation is not used in other forms of music.  

  

5) The swarita notes सा, म and प can be distinguished as plain आकार, nasalized आकार and stressed (consonantal) आकार respectively. In the case of flat and sharp notes it is achieved by unintonating the vowel at the same place. 

  

6) Four ways in which one can modulate a note to produce different musical notes, viz.:1)Nasalization;2)Stress;3)Intonation; and4)Unintonation.

  

7)  The name i.e. Sanskrit, given to vedic language is apt not only because of the structure of the language in terms of syntax, but also because of the **artistic and diligently choreographed use of the human voice organ.**

  

The above shows how Indian classical music which has its origins in Sama recitation has evolved from Rig Veda recitation.

  

The process of modulation of speech sounds to generate musical notes is unique. This cannot happen unless the speech sounds themselves have completely evolved.

  

Having evolved from vedic speech sounds the Indian classical musical notes are different from those of the tempered scale which is in vogue today in all other forms of music.  It was for this reason that the harmonium until recently was not allowed as an accompaniment to vocal classical music on All India Radio as its notes do not resonate with those of the different ragas presented in Indian Classical Music.

  

Lastly the concept of meend i.e.going from one note to another without break in classical Indian vocal music echoes Sutra 1-4-109 of the Asthaadhayi, viz., (परः संनिकर्षः संहिता)

  

All this shows that musical evolution in India though standing on the shoulders of Rig Veda recitation has evolved further than merely stopping at using speech sounds for language. **It has evolved further to encompass music the pinnacle of human speech.** Creating it's own method of rendering and literature.
