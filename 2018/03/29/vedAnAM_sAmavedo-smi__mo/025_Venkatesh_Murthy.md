Namaste

  

Could one more reason of Sama Gana in Yajnas be this? Sama Gana happens in Yajnas after drinking Soma Juice. It is intoxicating but not alcohol. In intoxication a person cannot change his habit of singing suddenly to Eka Sruti. Therefore he will sing exactly like he has learned without any change. The singing will increase the intoxication mood also. Today also we can see many singers sing nicely when they are intoxicated.
