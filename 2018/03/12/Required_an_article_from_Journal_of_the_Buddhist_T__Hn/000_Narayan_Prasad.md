Dear Members,

  

  A friend of mine requires a soft copy of the article“The story of Sundarī and Nanda” by Vidyābhūṣaṇa, Satis Chandra, published in “Journal of the Buddhist Text Society of India”, 4.3–4, pp. 20–28 in 1896.

  

  If you have an access to it, could you kindly send it to me ? If the Journal itself is downloadable from somewhere, kindly give the link.

  

  Thanks and best regards

  Narayan Prasad
