Two Brilliant presentations of Two important temples of Kanchi  

  

The Tamil Heritage Trust organizes lecture series on various topics including Temples of Tamilnadu by well learned professionals. Here are two such talks:

  

1\. Talk, in English, by Ms.Chitra Madhavan, on the 'Vaikuntha Perumal Temple':

2\. Talk by Gopu Rangaratnam in Tamil on the 'Kailasanathar Temple'.

Both the talks are about 1 hour each. It is very much worth the sit-through as one gets to know a lot about the temples, their history, architecture, sculpture, epigraphy, etc. etc.

  

I wish there are similar initiatives to cover temples in other parts of the country. Maybe they are already there.
