Dear Prof.Dr.Saroja Bhate,

  

I am very happy to know that you have resumed your work on Cat. of
Mss.in respect of Sciences in Ancient India.

  

Best luck to you and your team for early completion of this gigantic and very important project.

  

I would prefer to get some details of MSS.about Dhanurveda and the places where they are housed.

  

Thanks in advance.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
