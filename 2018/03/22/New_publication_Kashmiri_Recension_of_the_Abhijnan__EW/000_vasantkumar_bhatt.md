Respected Scholars,

Namaste ! I am happy to inform you that the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Delhi has published my critical edition of the Kashmiri Recension of Abhijnanshakuntalam Naatakam in March 2018.

This is the fifth and oldest Recension of this drama; it preserves the most authentic text, which is proved by higher criticism at length for the first time.

The popular Devnagari Recension of Abhijnanshaakuntalam is a production of 16th century. ( which is again a stage version only ! ) But the text, transmitted into the Shaaradaa script, is presenting the text of 7th century. And it is supported by the Aalamkaarikaas at many places.

Thanks

Vasantkumar M.Bhatt
