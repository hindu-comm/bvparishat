Dear Prof. Bhatt,

  

This is a wonderful achievement. Before your critical edition, we just had Somadeva Vasudeva's English translation (2006) of the Kashmir recension.  
I listened to yourlecture on the issues related to the textual recensions of the Abhijñānaśakuntala at BORI and understood why Kashmir recension was the closest to the original.

I hope this new publication would replace students' textbooks which are currently based on the Devanāgarī recension.

  

Last year, I had to give a brief class presentation on the recensions of the Abhijñānaśakuntala. Your other book on textual criticism of Abhijñānaśakuntala, which you kindly shared with us was extremely helpful for its preparation. I made a brief list of all important editions of the various recensions. I'm sharing that here.  
  

Kashmir Recension:

--Roman transcription of Sarada ms published from Germany (from Buhler’s collection)

--S. K. Belvalkar (Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi) No reference to mss.

--The first complete translation: Somadeva Vasudeva’s edition from Clay Sanskrit Library in 2006

**(your edition will be added here)**

  

Mithila Recension:

--Based on a ms in Tirhut script with the commentary of Śaṅkara and Narahari

Published by Ramanath Jha from the Mithila Institute, Darbhanga in 1957

  

Bengal Recension:

– Oldest editions are based on this recension

– Jone’s translation (1789) is based in this edition

– Most of the old European translations follow this

version

– Sakuntala: an Ancient Drama, Critically Edited in the

Original Sanskrit and Prakrit of the Bengali Recension

by Richard Pischel in 1876.

– Krishnanath Bhattacharya’s commentary (1869) is

based on this edition

– Dilip Kumar Kanjilal (A Reconstruction of

Abhijñānaśakuntala published in 1980 from

Calcutta) argued that Bengal edition is more

authentic providing quotations found in Sanskrit

texts on poetics

  

Devanāgarī Recension:

--Otto Bohtlingk’s German Edition (1842

--Monier William’s translation in 1843

--P. N. Patankar’s The Abhijñānaśakuntala(The Purer Devanāgarī text) with English translation

  

South Indian Recension:
