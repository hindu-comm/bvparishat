Respected Prof. Madhav Deshpande ji,

Namaste ! Thank you very much for your congratulations and best wishes for my new academic work! I should also acknowledge your various and most useful help during this project. I cannot forget it. I have also mentioned this in my कृतज्ञता-ज्ञापनम् । Without your ( and Dr. Saroja Bhate ji's )kind help, perhaps it would not have been possible for me tostart it. No sufficient words to express my feelings.... केवलं भूयांसि नमांसि विनिवेदयामि ।।
