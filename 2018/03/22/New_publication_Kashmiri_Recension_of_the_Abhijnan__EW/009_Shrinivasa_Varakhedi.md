Respected Prof Bhat,

  

It is a historical accomplishment. The Sanskrit fraternity is grateful to you for this contribution.

  

At least all Sanskrit universities should start using this for comparison in the PG research programs. And then it will percolate to the UG levels.

  

We look forward to a complete publication on textual criticism with reference to this recention by you. I am ignorant of the idea if earlier work by you on the variant readings of AS covers this aspect also. A response in this regard is appreciated.

  

We will procure copies for our personal as well as institutional collections.

  

Warm regards,

SV
