Respected Prof. Nagaraj ji,  
Namaste !  

Prof. Romila Thapar's study ( or any conclusion ) may not be acceptable for a text critic. Because, "Kalidasa's Shakuntala" means what ? Is it that Shakuntala, which is depicted in Devnagari Recension ?, Or Bengali Recension etc. ? If I have to say generally, I can say that Sanskrit teachers, students and Sanskrit loving people does not know that there are five versions of one and same drama, called " Abhijnaana-s'akuntalam". I say sorry, if I am wrong .  
During my comparative study of all these five versions, I came to know that - 1. गान्धर्वेण विवाहेन0 ( अंक-3 ) । shloka is not there in Kashmiri recension, 2. This shloka has been interpolated by Maithili recension for the first time !, & followed by other three recensions, 3.In that perticular shloka, Dakshinatya recension has converted the word - मुनिकन्यकाः, in to राजर्षिकन्यकाः । 4. And the king Dushyanta is addressed by Shakuntala as प्रियवयस्य in Kashmiri recension, but Bengali recension has started him to address by the word - महाराज । There are many more differences amoung all these five recensions. So, it is very difficult to arrive at conclusion for " Kalidasa's Shakuntala" !!! इति दिक् ।।

Respected Scholars,  
Namaste ! I am happy to inform you that the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Delhi has published my critical edition of the Kashmiri Recension of Abhijnanshakuntalam Naatakam in March 2018.  
This is the fifth and oldest Recension of this drama; it preserves the most authentic text, which is proved by higher criticism at length for the first time.  
The popular Devnagari Recension of Abhijnanshaakuntalam is a production of 16th century. ( which is again a stage version only ! ) But the text, transmitted into the Shaaradaa script, is presenting the text of 7th century. And it is supported by the Aalamkaarikaas at many places.  
Thanks  
Vasantkumar M.Bhatt
