Respected Prof. Saroja ji,

Namaste ! Thank you very much for your congratulations. It was you,
who have asked the manuscript-department of BORI. to locket the manuscript No. 192 for me !!! Without getting that Brich-bark manuscript, it was not possible for anybody to finalize this Critical edition. Thank you again,

Regards,

vasant bhatt
