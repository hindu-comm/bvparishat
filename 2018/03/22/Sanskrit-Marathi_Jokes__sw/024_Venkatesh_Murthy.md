Namaste

  

I was told there are humorous Slokas in Valmiki Ramayana also. I am not able to find one humor Sloka when Rama is returning to Ayodhya with Seeta after the war. It seems Vanara females like Taaraa and others wanted very much to see Seeta the cause of the war with Ravana. How beautiful She must be to create a war for Her sake? But when they saw Her they said 'God has made Seeta's every limb very beautiful but there is also one defect. She is missing a tail'.

  

I cannot find which Sloka is saying this in Valmiki Ramayana. Requesting scholars to kindly find it.
