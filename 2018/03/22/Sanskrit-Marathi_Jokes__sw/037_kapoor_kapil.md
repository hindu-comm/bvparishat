'Taddhita'=secondary derived nominals - so, abstract nouns (Hindu-tva, Indian-ness) and derived nominals/adjectivals (bhu-tal, (of) earth-surface)) are TADDHITA, even in most languages today. Patanjali says north western people are aakhyata-priya and dakshinatyas are taddhita- priya.

 It holds in today's speech as well.
