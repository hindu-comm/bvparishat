Kannada corruption

This was told by my uncle to me very long back and others may be knowing. No offence meant. In Vishnusahasranaamam

"व्यासंवसिष्ठनप्तारं" gets corrupted to "व्यासं वसिष्ठ स्नफ़् तारम्" Vyaasa asks VasiShTha for snuff

"मौक्तिकैर्मण्डिताङ्गः" gets corrupted to "मूग्तिकै र्मण्डि ताङ्गः" ( When a person slips while walking) "nose gets rubbed and the knee gets scraped"

Regards,

Murthy
