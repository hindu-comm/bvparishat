I recall a pauraNika detailing the meaning of

  

शुक्लांबरधरं विष्णुं शशिवर्णं चतुर्भुजं ।

प्रसन्नवदनं ध्यायेत् सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये ॥

  

शुक्लांबरधरं = (maami takes ) the liquid laden with a white cream (milk) ,

विष्णुम् = (and takes a ) dark colored 'decation;

शशिवर्णम् = (mixes them and gets a) dark-brown liquid (coffee) ,

चतुर्भुजम् = (mamii handing it over with her two hands and 'maamaa'
receiving with two hands, thus

        handing over process involving ) four hands

प्रसन्नवदनम् = (Having tasted the 'nectar' , maamaa's) face becomes pleasant and bright

सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये ध्यायेत्: = (and if you pray maamaa at that time \] all your hurdles get easily resolved.
