**ज्योक्(स्)-जीवन्तु  
  
**my take on this thread -  
  
मूर्धन्या अपि विद्वांसो बालभावसमन्विताः।  
विनोदकणिकाश्चक्रुः **ज्योक्** ते जीवन्तु भूतले॥  
**  
Meaning**  
Very senior scholars, with their child like nature, have shared(made) some jokes here.  
Let the they live long in this world.  
Alternatively, (following the trend of this thread) let those jokes be alive in this world.  
  
(ज्योक् is a Vedic term that means - for a long time)  
  
regards  
Jayaraman
