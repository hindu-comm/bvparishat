Namaste

  

This is not a Marathi joke but still a good one.

This Joke told by Sri KS Narayanacharya in a Bhagavata lecture. Once they were doing some Homa and he asked a boy to quickly go to Pooja shop and get Dashangam to put in the Homa. When burned it gives good fragrance. The boy went and came back with 2 Panchangams. The priest was surprised and asked why he brought Panchangams to put into Homa instead of Dashangam . The boy said the shopkeeper did not have Dashangam. He gave 2 Panchangams because he thought 2 Panchangams = 1 Dashangam.
