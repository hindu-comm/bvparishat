Dear Prof.Sundareswaran,

I am responding to your query again after more than one year. Your question was uppermost in my mind all these days. Fortunately I could locate the verse

अर्थत्रयेण विप्रर्षे पूर्वेवत्स्याद्विसप्ततेः ****

पृथग्दोःकोटिवर्गाभ्यां कर्णवर्गोनुषज्यते

This is the 10th verse in the seventh chapter of the Gargasamhita (manuscript no.VVRI 2069; Ref: Pingree: CESS A2,118). The Sanskrit text is in Malayalam script. Recently I was able to acquire (after several attempts stretching over 3-4 years) the Mss and a friendread the text for me. This Gargasamhita is not same as the Vrddhagaargiaya Jyotisha that I am editing. However, since there are several manuscripts (on
different subjects) attributed to Vrddhagarga/Garga I was curious about this Mss. Luckily I came across the so-called Pythagorean relation. This is an interesting part-Samhita, part-siddhanta text yet to be studied and understood. M.Yano has written briefly on this work of Garga(See:Geslani, M., Mak, B., Yano, M. and Zysk, K.G., Garga and early astral science in India.*History of Science in South Asia*,5(1) 2017.; pp.151-191.)

  

Regards

RN Iyengar
