There is another quotation from Gargasamhita in Nilakantha's commentary (In the Kalakriyspada;p.14 of TSS 110 - see attachment). The second half of the same verse has been quoted again in Golapada(see the second attachment given by MDS).

  

It is doubtful whether these are ascribed rightly to Garga (Vrddha Garga or Gargasamhita) by tradition. For, some of the verses ascribed by Nilakantha to Garga (in the Golapada - see again the second attachment by MDS) are seen in the Brhatsamhita also. For instance the verses अविदित्वैव .... , मुहूर्ततिथिनक्षत्र .... , नगरद्वारि लोष्टस्य .....are available in Brhatsamhita (2.16, 2.9 and 2.17)

  

Moreover Nilakantha quotes a half-verse सिसृक्षुणा पुरा सृष्टं वेदानेतत् स्वयम्भुवा with the remark अन्यत्रापि स्मर्यते immediately following a citation from Gargasamhita in the beginning of Ganitapada. This means that he is of the opinion that this is authored/said by somebody else. The same half-verse ( with a slightly variant reading)
is seen ascribed by himself to Garga in the golapada (see again the second attachment by MDS).
