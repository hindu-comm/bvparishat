Dear Prof. Iyengar,  
  

In his Bhashya on Ganitapada of Aryabhatiya, Nilakantha cites Vrddhagarga in the beginning (on p.2 of the printed text enclosed). He later cites the part of the verse cited by Prof. Sundareswaran ascribing it to Gargasamhita (p.6 of the printged text, enclosed).  
  

Best regards  
  

M D Srinivas
