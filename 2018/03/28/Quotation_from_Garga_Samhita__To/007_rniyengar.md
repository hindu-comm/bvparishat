Dear Prof.Sundareswaran,

Have you come across Vrddha-garga-samhita (aka Vrddha-gaargiiya-Jyotisha; or other variant names) in manuscript libraries of Kerala? Please share such information whatever be the script. Your query and the clarification by Prof.MDS has increased my curiosity about availability of VGJ manuscripts in South India. If Neelakantha in 16th cent. CE were to quote Vrddhagarga perhaps he had access to the text attributed to Vr.Garga. Such a manuscript might have survived the ravages of time and stuck in a collection somewhere. This may be of course wishful thinking !

Thanks

RNI
