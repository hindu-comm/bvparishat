Dear Sri Kannan ji,

  

My first post with the image has this content:

  

// Here is one instance, of the many, of the usage:

  

<https://sa.wikisource.org/s/10xo> \[This is not Shankara Bhashya\]:

  

१६७ काठकोपनिषद्भाष्यद्वये २॥३॥९ निमित्तमिति चेत्तदपि न । //

  

In fact even before posting the topic on this forum I had first checked in the Shankara Prasthana traya bhashya which is searchable through Advaitasharada resource and ruled out this nyaya's usage therein. Only after that I made the request on this forum. On an internet search I saw the above and immediately recognzied that it is not from Shankara's bhashya. Yet since the nyaya was used there I cited it.

  

In my second instance I only clarified by posting the actual Shankara bhashya for that mantra to make sure that the earlier one was not the bhashya. 

  

Trust this clarifies.
