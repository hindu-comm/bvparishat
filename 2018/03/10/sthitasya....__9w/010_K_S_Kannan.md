When I began my last response, I had not read the citation given by Sri V.Subramanian-ji.

I am not surprised by the presence of *kathamapi* therein,

whereas I had asserted *kathan"cit* as understood.

  

I guess Prof. Korada's explanation is not *s'AstrIya*at all.

Please correct me if I am wrong.
