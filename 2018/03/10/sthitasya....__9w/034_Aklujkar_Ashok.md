Sorry for having missed the distinction Shri V. Subrahmanian had in mind. I will retract my earlier conclusion "that the sentence {sthitasya…) is at least as old as the time of the Śāṅkara-bhāỵa on the Kāṭhakopaniṣad.”. More effort is needed to find out what the earliest occurrence is, unless it is already there in the articles mentioned by Prof. Isaacson (I have not yet had time to read those articles).

  

Thanks to Prof. Harunaga Isaacson and Shri Sivasenani Nori for the additional information they have provided.
