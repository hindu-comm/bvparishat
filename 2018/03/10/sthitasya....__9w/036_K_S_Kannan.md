Dear Dr BVKS,

  

No personal criticism meant or intended.

  

The issue is very simple. Vedic literature has many usages which are not exactly "grammatically sound".

Yet it is possible to make sense generally after some "adjustments".

"*Ars"atvAt sAdhuH*" just means, were it not *RSi-prokta*,

the expression would have been labelled *asAdhu*or *apa-s'abda.*

And as it is the utterance of a *RSi*, nobody calls it *apas'abda.*

No *AcArya* or *veda-bhAs"ya-kartR* would label it so. Nor I.

  

As Sanskrit is not being spoken now by and large,

we sometimes fail to notice the grammatical deviation easily,

which is to say - as easily as does a native speaker.

"Grammatical deviation" is something a native speaker

would naturally recognise - as jarring on his years,

even if he is not able to explain why or how.

We have lost that sensitivity and sensibility.

The discussion on *s'is"Ta*-s in the*MahAbhAs"ya* is worth pursuing here.

  

This is the case with *tAm yogam iti manyante*.

Had the word *yoga* been neuter, the problem would not have arisen.

Or if it was *laukika* Sanskrit,

*tAm yogam manyante,* or

*tAm yoga iti manyante*

would be the "normal" expression.

But it is not *laukika* Sanskrit, so we would not like to

call it *apas'abda,*or emend the text.

  

The issue of *sthitasya gatiH cintanIyA*is thus one of struggling

to somehow cover up what has come down to us, or

to make it look sensible, or

to make do with what we have

\- rather than, exactly, altering the original,

or just discard the handed down text.

  

I hope you realise that I am only reiterating the "traditional position",

and nothing else.
