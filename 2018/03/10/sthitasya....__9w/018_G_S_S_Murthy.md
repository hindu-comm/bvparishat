This expression occurs at several places in the Commentary of Govindaraja on Valmiki Ramayana. I am not able to locate them now, but my impression is that he has used it in connexion with an inaccuracy in narration or a lapse in Grammar. If there is a searchable text of Govindarajiya on the web the instances could be located.

Regards,

Murthy
