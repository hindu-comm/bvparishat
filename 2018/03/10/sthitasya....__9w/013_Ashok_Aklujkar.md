In my experience of commentaries, the sense of sthitasya gatiś cintanīyā means ‘a way out (an escape route) for what stands i(in front of us), should be thought about’; in other words, the author wishes to convey to his reader: ‘We have a problematic situation. I have dealt with it as best as I could. Others may have a better solution.”  
  
Here gati has the same sense as in the exclamation kā gatiḥ, or the adjective agatika Because the sentence appears (usually? more frequently?) in textual explanation, sthita, in effect, acquires the sense of ‘the text as it stands, the reading as it has come down to us,’ etc.  
  
In our times, we can in many instances acquire manuscripts of a text from different parts of the world and can relatively easily decide, following the criteria of textual criticism, which reading is objectively strong, that is, older or likely to be genuine. The traditional Sanskrit commentators were not ignorant of this possibility or of the lectio difficilior criterion. Probably because of this, they almost never took liberties with the text that they found in the manuscripts of their commentandum. They could in many instances probably guess what the reading contextually should have been, but they almost never actually changed a reading in the text of which they were commenting. Unless the reading was obviously unacceptable (through lack of grammaticality, etc.), they would interpret around what they had and provide the contextually needed content in different words.  
  
In note 11 of my 2008 publication, “What more can the editors of Sanskrit texts do?” (attached), I had touched upon the proverbial saying.  
  
I also recall a verse part ‘sthite tv etat samarthanam,’ useful in understanding the sense of sthitasya gatiḥ, although I have forgotten where exactly I came across it.
