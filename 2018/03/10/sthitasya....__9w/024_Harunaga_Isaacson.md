Many thanks to Prof. Aklujkar for his messages and the attached PDFs of his relevant publications.  
  
For those who read French, another publication which could be worth looking at on this matter is:  
  
Gerdi Gerschheimer: Sthitasya gatiś cintanīyā ? À propos de la « Glose concise » (Laghuvṛtti) du Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya de Haribhadra. In:  
  
**Colas, Gérard** \[u.a.\] (Hrsg.)  
*Écrire et transmettre en Inde classique* / sous la direction de Gérard Colas et Gerdi Gerschheimer. - Paris : École française d'Extrême-Orient, 2009.  
  
pp. 287-305.  
  
(I shall try to attach a PDF of this article to this message.)

This sounds like sthiteṣv etat samarthanam in the Kāvyaprakāśa (not part of a verse, apparently,  
though it could indeed fit as a second or fourth pāda of an anuṣṭubh verse).
