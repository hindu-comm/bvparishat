The gist of the text cited by Sri Subramanian-ji is clear.

The Upanis"ad (*KaTha* here) presents a construction which is grammatically not valid.

The Upanis"ad should have said

either **tAm yogam manyante**

or **tAm yoga iti manyante.**

  

If you use *dvitIya*, where is the need of *iti*?

Or if you wanted to use *iti*, use *prathamA*.

  

The point is -*iti* itself can do the *abhidhAna* of *karman*.

How can *dvitIyA* come when there is *abhidhAna* already?

That is why the *vibhakti* section has to begin with

*anabhihite* as the primary condition.

Else, the default *prathamA* can take care.

  

The conclusion is that the text is grammatically indefensible.

However, it is a *s'ruti* text. So to rail against it is unbecoming.

So it must be explained away via other ruses.

  

So call it *chAndasa*, and be done with it.

  

And did I not speak of such a context as this

right in my first post in this regard

saying - typically *Ars"atvAt sAdhu* instances?
