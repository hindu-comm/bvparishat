Subbuji,

Im wondering if the meaning of gati can be taken as avagati, ie comprehension, understanding, intended meaning?(similar to gati sAmAnya = avagati sAmAnya).

  

Thus sthitasya gati: chintanIya can be the intended meaning conveyed by the existing (here, text) must be considered. Given the context is chintanIya, the use of gati to mean 'understanding' is perhaps more appropriate than path / route / movement.

  

Prof Kannan's point about the inapplicability of chintanIya as an instruction to worry, is well made, but in my view does not absolutely rule out the interpretation suggested by Prof. Korada.

  

If the literal meaning of the nyAya is taken as 'Worry about the present', the true import is 'do not worry about the future and past'. Like a reverse of nahi nindA, an instruction to worry about the present ought to be taken as an instruction to not worry of things not present now.

  

Having said that, it would be useful to see examples of the usage of this expression in such a context.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
