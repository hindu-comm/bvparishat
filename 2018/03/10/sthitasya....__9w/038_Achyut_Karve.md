If there happen to be some flaws why not correct them. Of course by giving reasons there of. Secondly we are dwelling on hand written manuscripts not necessarily written by distinguished people. Do manuscripts necessarily carry the name of the cartographer. There is a possibility that mistakes must have inadvertently crept in. It because of this possibility that the west has developed aids like spell checks and syntactical checks. Further it is wrong to believe that the intent of the speaker is cent percent reflected in the spoken word and still less in the written.

  

I have come to believe that discussion are being lengthened because the flaws are not being corrected under the excuse that they are sacred cows. 

  

Do such type of discussions also take place with regard to ancient texts of the west? Why they don't take place is after the juice is milked the chaff thrown away.  

  

I am working on scripting an oral tradition. If one has to do it astutely one has to do a lot of homework before one is able to do justice to the work one has undertaken.

  

What is happening is that the written word is taken for the spoken resulting in the generàtion of many opinions. If this situation has to be overcome we need to build specific context so that the written word becomes intelligible in a contemporary context. Grammar should be used positively to buttress a position and not negatively to discard another.

  

People in an oral tradition tend to formulate their ideas in as short a way as possible. Obviously the listener has to do a lot of work before he can reach the intent of the speaker in making such a statement.

  

For example our Tabla Ustad Ahmedjan Thirakwa who believed in a oral tradition and who was not exposed to reading and writing used to say यह तबला स्वर का बाजा है. The word स्वर can mean a vowel or a note.
After a lot of deliberation on the statement I concluded that what he intended to convey was that the tabla was an instrument which illumined the vowels in the composition and not a note even though the tabla is tuned to a particular note.

  

By scripting the oral tradition one does not necessarily overcome the unique conditions that led to their creation. 

  

For example I could not pick up the relevance of the idiom quoted by Kananji viz., 'Bertrand Russell's comment on Aristotle  
regarding the number of teeth women have.' in terms of the discussion in the thread. Possibly I am not qualified to understand such nuances or that I am not sufficiently well read or well informed.
