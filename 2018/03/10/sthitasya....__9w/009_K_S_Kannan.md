I am a bit surprised by the explanation attempted by Prof Korada.

In no way does it tally with the kind of application(s) I have heard it used for

\- in common contexts, though, but by traditional scholars.

  

The citation from *SiddhAnta KaumudI*would be very helpful.

  

Given the common polysemy of Sanskrit words,

*sthiti* and *gati* (stability and movement) can be sometimes used in opposite senses.

But that is not intended here at all.

  

And *gatam* can be used in the sense of *gatiH,*

as there is scope for *kta* in *bhAvArtha*.

Not needed here, again.

  

*cintanIyA,*or better,*cintyam* is often used in the sense of

"something being questionable", or "being in need of revision".

Even this sense is not relevant here.

*cintanIyA* is used here in the sense of "found out"/"worked out",

or as a corollary, "devised"/"designed".

  

I do not find the faintest hint of "worrying", of*cintA*, here.

Two at least of the *subhAs"ita*-s cited as corroborative assert rather the opposite:

worry not.

  

The sense of worrying would have been apposite,

had the intention of the words *sthita* and *gati* had been,

"something that is \[with us \[till\]now\]"(*sthita*), but there has been "a loss" (*gati*),

and one is *asked to bother about* it.

This is not the case, however.

  

*cintanIyA* is used here clearly**in the senses of *samarthanIyA -*

"to be substantiated somehow",

"to be ratified in some manner", or

"to be justified through some method"

(*kathan"cit* being somehow understood)

\- alone seems to make sense , in my humble opinion.

  

I would be thankful to any scholar who can present its usage in a contrary sense.
