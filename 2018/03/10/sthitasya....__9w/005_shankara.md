Namaste,

  

It seems there is a slightly different version of this nyaya - स्थितस्य गतिः समर्थनीयः, which was found in Google search results. Either versions of this nyaya are not listed in any of the Nyaya Anthologies inlcuding GA Jacob's Laukika Nyayanjali and Bhuvanesa Nyaya Sahasri. It is surprising that such popular nyayas *(assuming that this is a popular Nyaya)* are not included in any of the published Nyaya anthologies.  

  

Hence, I request scholars to explain citing examples from Sanskrit works.  

  

regards  
shankara
