I am glad that actual instances of the use of sthitasya gatiś cintanīyā/samarthanīyā are being located. I will mention them (with thanks) if my articles shared with this forum are again published.

  

We can now say that the sentence is at least as old as the time of the Śāṅkara-bhāỵa on the Kāṭhakopaniṣad.

  

I am not surprised by the absence of the sentence in nyāya collections. A typical nyāya refers to a specific instance or a compressed story which has a general message hidden in it. It creates a semantic situation which is very much like that of arthāntara-nyāsa according to Kāvya-śāstra, although the ‘general’ part is not expressed — is left to the erudition of the reader. Pronouncements like vyākhyānato viśeṣa-pratipattiḥ orsthitasya gatiś cintanīyā have the potential to be applicable in a wide variety of contexts or branches of learning. In that respect they are *like* nyāyas, and one can understand why some compilers would feel like including them in nyāyas, but they are not exactly like nyāyas; they can remain at the level of dictums/dicta.
