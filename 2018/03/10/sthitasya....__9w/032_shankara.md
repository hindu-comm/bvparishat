Kannan-ji,

  

There is a minor correction. SP Pathank's Balabodhini, which was quoted by Subbuji, is a sub-commentary on both Sankara as well as Ranga Ramanuja bhashyas on Kathopanishad. So, Balabodhini for each verse consists of 2 parts that begin with the sub-headings 'Saankarabhaashyam' and 'Prakasikaa' (the commentary of RR).

  

Link to the relevant page of the printed book is given below.

<https://archive.org/stream/Kathakopanishad.with.Sankara.Bhasya.and.Ranga.Ramanujas.Prakasika#page/n188/mode/1up>

  

I hope this clears the confusion created by the sub-heading 'Saankarabhaashyam'.

  

regards  
shankara
