Namaste KSK



1. Thanks for the clarity and confirmation on common intent of convergence in this discussion ‘ samvaada’ ! We can always discuss more on this in person meetings.



2. I agree on



2a) \< No personal criticism meant or intended. \>



2b) \< I hope you realize that I am only reiterating the "traditional position", and nothing else.>



2c) \< We have lost that sensitivity and sensibility. The discussion on *s'is"Ta*-s in the*MahAbhAs"ya* is worth pursuing here.>



3. What we seem to differ is in the ‘ modes of expression of intent’ and ‘connecting it to the points held sacrosanct by tradition.

 What constitutes tradition for Samskruth Language study beyond Muni-traya /Patanjali Sampradaya (? – a debated between Rushi’s of
Past in the East and Rushi’s of Orient currently in post colonial era ) ’. 



 I look for position clarification beyond a ‘ compromise statement’ by ‘ prathame vidvaamsah vaiyaakaranaah’ on restoring the ‘sense and sensibility’ in Samskrutham grammar studies and application, per standards set by Muni-Traya / Patanjali tradition as ‘ unified rules for Samskruth language study as ‘ Vedanga and Pada-Shaastra’ i.e. Vak-Yoga Sampradaya or Yoga-Samskrutham approach.
