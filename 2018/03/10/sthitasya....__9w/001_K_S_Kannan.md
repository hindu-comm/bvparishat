Sometimes you come across some statement which is not heartily acceptable, or is not stated the best way.

Yet, coming as it does from some author who is generally respected,

you do not like to alter the expression. So you make some adjustment in its meaning/usage.  

*gati* is a way out - of a problem/irresolution.

  

So the adjustment (*gati/nayana=leading*) made to what exists(*sthita*)

in order to render the *sthita* defensible/make sense is where this is applicable.

A typical example could be instances of *ArshatvAt sAdhuH.*

*  
*

(One may perhaps apply the *nyAya* to the wordings of the very*nyAya*.

*gati* could more easily/famously mean going away.

But then, we do not change the word, we resort instead to

a different, even if less famed, sense ofthe word if that can help and serve our purpose).

*  
*

What applies to *vyAhAra*can apply to *vyavahAra* also.  
  

MimAmsA should have stock examples for such items.
