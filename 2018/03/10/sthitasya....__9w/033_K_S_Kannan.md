It is good that you clarified now at least.  

You could have resolved the contradiction in that very mail with this brief clarificatory note.  

  

A good many standard expresions are couched in simple words,  
and that can be the cause of a lot of confusion. Heavy duty words, as they are called,  

they can sometimes give rise to totally unconnected ideas.  

This is true of all languages.  

This happens even to proverbs sometimes.  

It is only *sampradAya* that can resolve the issue best.  

And if the *sampradAya* has had some disruptions in the course of history,  

(Cf. *bhras"To vyAkaraNAgamaH*) many variant interpretations can arise.  
  

Just to illustrate: As simple an expression as  

*mahAjano yena gatas sa panthAH*  

has led to pages and pages of discussion - and at the hands of giants!  
  

In any case, the use of the maxim under discussion has been consistent throughout literature,  

and **has had but a single sense : the one I pointed out in my very first post**.  

That is why I ask(ed) scholars to provide *even a single instance*  

where the usage is at variance with the sense I suggested.  
  
The situation is as simple, perhaps, as Bertrand Russell's comment on Aristotle  
regarding the number of teeth women have.  
  

There is little need to struggle to reinterpret something which has had a uniform usage,  

\- simply on grounds that the words are polysemic, and we are endowed with skills of interpretation.
