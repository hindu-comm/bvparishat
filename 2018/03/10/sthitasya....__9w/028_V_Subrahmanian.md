It would be interesting to see the use of this nyaya in the works of Ramanuja and Madhva schools. Those who are familiar with the literature pertaining to these schools may share the instances so that we can form a better understanding or confirm our present understanding. I have already searched in Shankara prasthana traya bhashya and in the Bhamati. No results for this nyaya.
