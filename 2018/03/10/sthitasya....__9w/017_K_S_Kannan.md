Prof. Ashok Aklujkar has thrown more and valuable light on the issue.

  

We also have *agatika-gati-nyAya,*

comparable somewhat to

"The sinking man catches hold of a straw".

  

And as I said earlier, the *nyAya* has more, or more frequent, applications in *vyavahAra*,

both in the technical and non-technical senses of the word,

(apart from *vyAhAra*, general utterances)

which is why *smRti*-s and *mImamsA-s'Astra* is likely to have

many instances of its usage.
