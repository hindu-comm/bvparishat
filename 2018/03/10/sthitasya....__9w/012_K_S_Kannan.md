The text cited resorts to either of the two ruses again as

\- *madhyama-pada-lopi-samAsa*

*- pan"camI-samAsa.*

*  
*

These are also aimed at somehow supporting/justifying

the text (as obtains) of a *s'ruti* text,

rather than declare that it is ungrammatical.

*  
*

By the way, the text pasted is too full of typos.

Looks like a poorly rendered OCR.
