Dear All,

  

Sri Subramanian ji has acknowledged replies by scholars for the question that he's raised. Eminent scholars helped novice members to understand the dynamics of this context. Locating this nyāya in other śāstras including govindarījīyam would be quite helpful for the current discussion, than deviating from the present context.
