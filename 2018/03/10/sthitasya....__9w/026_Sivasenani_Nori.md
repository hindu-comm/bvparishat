The French article of Gerdi Gerschheimer refers to two discussions on स्थितस्य गतिश्चिन्तनीया - one, is his discussion with his teacher Sri K. Venugopalan and two, the article of Gerard Colas, (also cited by Prof. Isaacson in his email below), which has been translated into English as "The Crticism and Transmission of Texts in Classical India" by Jean Burrell and made available at<https://www.scribd.com/document/149813244/Gerard-Colas-The-Criticism-and-Transmission-of-Texts-in-Classical-India> . Within that article, the paragraph relevant to the present discussion is reproduced below:

  

"The scholars of classical India took up two positions, the first in favour of preserving readings as received, the second in favour of altering them where there was good reason. The topical maxim: ‘It is necessary to consider the situation of what is there’ (*sthitasya gatiścintanīyā*) led to a preference for interpretation over alteration. It exhorts the reader or commentator to explain the reading as received, rather than correct it. This was a double-edged sword which, although it meant that justified *lectio difficilior* were preserved, alsoperpetuated recent errors and lent them the lustre of ancient readings."
