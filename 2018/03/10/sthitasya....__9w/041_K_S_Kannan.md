Dear Karveji,

  

You seem to have no idea about the Veda-s as sacred texts.

The texts are not (to be) altered.

  

Scribal errors, if confirmed to be so, may be emended,

but not the original texts, generally (even if they are not Vedic).

  

One does not apply Spell-check to Shakespeare's works before printing.

It is licit to do that to Charles Lamb's, for example,

before submitting it to the press for a reprint.

  

The issue here is far from one of just spoken tongue versus written text.

  

The allusion was to Russell's comment on Aristotle's assertion

that women have less teeth than men

(typical of the general procedure of the Greek - of deductions from their grand theoretical constructions

in lieu of or in preference to plain empirical verification even where it is easy).

  

Hope things are clear.
