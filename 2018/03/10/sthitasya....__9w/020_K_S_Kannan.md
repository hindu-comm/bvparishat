Dr BVK Sastry is struggling hard to convince all that he does not read mails carefully.

He need not take so much of effort..

  

\*\*What is our position, credential and authority to assess and amend the ‘ Shruti - Darshana’?\*\*  

  

Dr Sastry thinks he is attacking me.

Actually he is attacking Sankara, as I have done little else than paraphrase Sankara's position.

(It is not that other commentators have not noticed the grammatical deviation here in the Upanis"ad.

All Vedic commentators have struggled with the abundant grammatical deviations in the Vedic literature.

A good many times, *Ars"atvAt sAdhuH* is the only resort they have).

Nobody is amending any *s'ruti* here, please.

  

The problem here is that when all is solved - in the sense that

Prof Ashok Aklujkar has concluded giving authentic citations and the sound traditional interpretation,

Dr BVK thinks that it is all but solved.

  

(Prof AA has conspicuously pointed out how

our commentators took care never to emend the sacred texts.)

  

A worrisome case verily of

*gatasya sthitiH cintanIyA!*
