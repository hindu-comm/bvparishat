## History Of Linguistics 

## Earlier history

## Non-Western traditions

Linguistic speculation and investigation, insofar as is known, has gone on in only a small number of societies. To the extent that Mesopotamian, Chinese, and Arabic learning dealt withgrammar, their treatments were so enmeshed in the particularities of those languages and so little known to the European world until recently that they have had virtually no impact on Western linguistic tradition.Chineselinguistic and philological scholarship stretches back for more than two millennia, but the interest of those scholars was concentrated largely onphonetics,writing, and lexicography; their consideration of grammatical problems was bound up closely with the study of logic.

Certainly the most interesting non-Western grammatical tradition—and the most original and independent—is that ofIndia, which dates back at least two and one-half millennia and which culminates with the grammar ofPanini, of the 5th centuryBCE. There are three major ways in which theSanskrittradition has had an impact on modern linguistic scholarship. As soon as Sanskrit became known to the Western learned world, the unravelling of comparative Indo-European grammar ensued, and the foundations were laid for the whole 19th-century edifice ofcomparative philologyandhistorical linguistics. But, for this, Sanskrit was simply a part of the data; Indian grammatical learning played almost no direct part. ***Nineteenth-century workers, however, recognized that the native tradition of phonetics in ancient India was vastly superior to Western knowledge, and this had important consequences for the growth of thescienceof phonetics in the West.*** Third, there is in the rules or definitions (sutras) of Panini a remarkably subtle and penetrating account of Sanskrit grammar. The construction of sentences,[compound](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compound)nouns, and the like is explained through ordered rules operating on underlying structures in a manner strikingly similar in part to modes of modern theory. As might be imagined, this perceptive Indian grammatical work held great fascination for 20th-century theoretical linguists. A study of Indian logic in relation to Paninian grammar alongside Aristotelian and Western logic in relation to Greek grammar and its successors could bring[illuminating](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/illuminating)insights.
