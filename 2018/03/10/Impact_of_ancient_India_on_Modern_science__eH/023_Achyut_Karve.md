More than what our ancients have to offer to the world is it not the time to sit back and think what we have to offer to the world today when we are a part of that tradition itself. Are we today only worth digging the graves of our ancients for information.

  

The so called scientific method of observation hypothesis experiment and statement is no more in vogue even in the west today. The system of shistas have taken their place. People in the west no more talk of science in the sense they used to in the 18th 19th and the beginning of the 20th century but of a scientific community who indulge in metalanguages specific to their own community just as Sanskrit itself was used in days bygone. (Research papers are peer reviewed) The concept of cause and effect being established through experiment has been replaced by statistical correlation. 

  

In such a scenario we need to look at our ancient literature from the point of view of modernizing it so that it can be put to use just as the west did with Greek literature in the 17th century.

  

What I got from our ancients is their ability of abstract thinking when they had no experimental apparatus to fall back on. The way they used language itself as a tool to further knowledge. What facinated me most was the concept of sphota laid by Bhartrahari. What does he mean when he says that a letter is a sphota, a word too is a sphota and so too is a sentence?   

  

I think we need to share what we individually reaped in the process of going through our ancient literature rather than just sharing information regarding that literature.
