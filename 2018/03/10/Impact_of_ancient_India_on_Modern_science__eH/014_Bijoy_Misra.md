Dear Sri Kalyan,

I would suggest that you segment your thoughts.

Take a topic that you can help develop.

Once we have focused discussion, we learn.

Best regards,

BM

  

PS. Looks like you have ideas on vedanta. You can phrase the question as "Has Vedanta influenced modern science?"

If mathematics is the forte, then "How much of the early Indian mathematical ideas are in use in modern Mathematics?"

You can expand these further. I suggest to avoid random discussion.
Let each word/phrase be understood in its depth.
