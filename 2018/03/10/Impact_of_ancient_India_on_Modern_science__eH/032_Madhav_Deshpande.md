Dear Paturiji,

  

  On the Hathi Trust Library, I see a recent English translation of John Wallis's work:

  

#### Grammar of the English language: with an introductory grammatico-physical Treatise on speech, or on the formation of all speech sounds.

byWallis, John, 1616-1703.

Published197

  

This is not a downloadable work. However, Hathi Trust Library allows searching in this book, and I did not find the word "Sanskrit" in this translated book. Will see if I can find this English translation in the library of the Stanford University where I go once a week.
