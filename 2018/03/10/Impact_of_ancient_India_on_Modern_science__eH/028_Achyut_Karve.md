Is it necessary that we each time question the source not to be genuine?

  

This can be considered as a criticism of the use of the roman alphabet to write English which by far is very clumsy. This classification can also be taken as starting point for writing shorthand which may have gone through various stages before pitman's shorthand writing became the standard.

  

The question still remains whether this thread at generating a phonetic script similar to the devnagari was the the main reason. This because there was no need to preserve oral literature because they had none.
The invention of the Morse code and later of the typewriter provide clues to such a need.
