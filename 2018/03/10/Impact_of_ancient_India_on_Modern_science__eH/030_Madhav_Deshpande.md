Dear Paturiji,

  

  John Wallis's, Tractata de Loquela (1652)appears to be too early for any Western knowledge of Pāṇini and Bhartr̥hari. It is possible that he may have been familiar with some missionary grammars of Sanskrit. I do not know of any missionary grammars of Sanskrit prior to 1652, but a few came our within that century:

  

  Grammatica Grandonica: the Sanskrit grammar of Johann Ernst Hanxleden S.J. (1681-1732) \[introduced and edited by Toon Van Hal & Christophe Vielle, with a photographical reproduction of the original manuscript by Jean-Claude Muller\]  

  

  Heinrich Roth's Sanskrit grammar, that he had completed by 1660 in Latin language under the title*Grammatica Linguae Sanscretanae Brachmanum Indiae Orientalis*(the manuscript of which is preserved today at the[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Central_Library_(Rome) "National Central Library (Rome)")in Rome) and that was augmented by preliminary studies for a complete Sanskrit-Latin dictionary, made him a pioneering scholar in modern Sanskrit studies in Europe.

  

  One needs to look for European sources on Sanskrit prior to 1652.
The Portuguese were in Kerala and Goa and the earliest knowledge of Sanskrit probably was transmitted by Portuguese missionaries to Europe.
May be useful to trace a copy of John Wallis's work for further references.
