There is much to explore here. It's quite interesting to know how time works.

Time travel has been stated at many places, also the oneness of time has also been confirmed through various pramans id like to provide.

ShreeGarga uvacha "Bahooni santi namani roopani cha sutasya te" . This shlok of shrimad bhagawatam itself is praman. He says, "santi" that's present. While Krishna is just born, he hasnt lifted Govardhan yet, not killed kamsa or became king of dwarika yet, so how does he say this?  
Two reasons, 1 is leela nityatva vaad and 2nd is kaala nityatvavaad.

Also, when Kaala is 1, why it seems to be different at different places?

Theory of causality has been suggested as karyakaranavaada of nyaya and vaisheshika. We see relativity taking place here. This effect of causality, when observed by Einstein, suggested him to proventhat light is constant.

Let me explain: Time is one, but not absolute, its relative. Time in Brahmaloka is different from time in prithviloka, even though there is only 1 time. Also, according to causality, time can only move in one direction, that is forward. If it can't move backwords, and it has to tick in different speeds, there has to be some constant right? That's light. Light is therefore constant.

In classical physics, an effect can't occur before its cause. In the theory of relativity, causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause which is not in the back (past) light cone of that event. Similarly, a cause can not have an effect outside its front (future) light cone. These restrictions are consistent with the grounded belief (or assumption) that causal influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time. In quantum field theory, observables of events with a spacelike relationship, "elsewhere", have to commute, so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other. -wikipedia.

So, we can easily say that the base of relativity is nyayashastra. Nyayashastra is not dealing with relativity, but inderectly stating it at various places.

Time, is one, relative, always subjected to causality and imperishable. That means, one can timetravel, but for that one needs to have one more self or another universe.

Timetravel isn't possible due to the grandfather paradox, but, if all events take place at once? For eg, kurikshetra battle took place in the past. Right now, there is someone playing cricket. If we combine both events at the same place coexisting together? That means there is an infinite no of events taking place at the same place? That means, there are infinite swaroopas of that same kurukshetra existing together, in spacetime, its not so easy to imagine a 4d universe!

We can also time travel through sukshma ling. As aatma is sarvavyapi, sukshma ling through yoga can travel through various mediums within spacetime.  
That means, we can look at our own selves in the past, as our own form. We can't experience those events that have happened in the past, and those events which are to be exexuted, as we are in another universe, a 3d one. This, would be entirely different for the devas, living in 4d universe, where they can travel through spacetime. Reach any destination at the speed of light probably. For them, or yogis like Shiva, three times and each event can be looked upon at once, making them trikaladarshi.

Even though yogis travel through sukshma linga, they cannot change any event that takes place. If they do that, the event bever took place in the first part, so the yogi didn't travel to the past so the event took place \~ the yogi travelled and so on. The gf paradox as it is.

  
Thankyou
