Back in 2015 I had written an article for the first print issue of Swarajya on The Story of Our Numbers, and provided timelines of math development. It is clear from it that for 18 centuries there was no new developments in math in West, and after an Indian contribution was rediscovered did we start having 100s of new mathematicians a century.

  

Please read my article here

For rhinoplasty, the reintroduction in West is well documented. See the 18th century part of this link<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rhinoplasty>

  

Apparently an Italian army surgeon read the article, 10 years later, published in Gentlemen's Magazine in 1794, and carried out a succeful rhinoplasty only from reading the article.

EIC surgeons Cruso and Findlay had an illustrator with them when they visited the procedure done by a cobbler who was part time rhinoplasty surgeon in Pune.

  

That speaks a lot. Not only Sushrut was doing it, it was alive till 1794 and so common and easy that a cobbler did this as part time job. I am unable to find the link to this story of cobbler, but you may search for it on net.

  

Will post if I find the material I had downloaded some 10 years back.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
