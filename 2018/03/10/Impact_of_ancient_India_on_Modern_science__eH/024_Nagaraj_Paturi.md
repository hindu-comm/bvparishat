My focus is the image I shared from John Wallis's so called " early precursor of the IPA chart.".

  

How can that glutteral, palatal and labial be so much similar to kaNThya, tAlavya and OshThya. Within each of these categories, how can that be in the same order unvoiced, voiced and nasal p, b, m ; c,g, n with \~ on the top, and t, d, n (that would have been retroflex or dental for us but palatal because of the English pronunciation)?

  

varNamAlA learnt by all children of Indian languages has the same order glutteral, palatal, retroflex, dental and labials for consonant stops.

  

We have the same glutteral, palatal and labial order in vowels too. The same order is found in John Wallis's.

  

How can this much of closeness or even one can say exact equality be just coincidental?

  

We can say that John Wallis borrowed it from ancient Indian sources of articulatory phonetics.
