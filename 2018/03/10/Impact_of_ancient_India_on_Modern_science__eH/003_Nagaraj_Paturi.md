Brilliant editorial by Prof.RoddamNarasimha  

  

The third controversy concernsplasticsurgery, which  
seems to have been driven in several parts of the world  
by the need to repair broken noses (apparently an ancient  
and common punishment worldwide), cleft lips, etc. The  
first records go back to Egypt in 3000–2500 BCE. In the  
6th century BCE, Suśruta consolidated Indic ayurvedic  
knowledge in an encyclopaedic and foundational text  
called the Suśruta Samhita. This included the practice of  
plasticsurgery, in which India clearly remained well  
ahead of the rest of the world. Thus the first major rhinoplasty  
in modern West was performed as late as 1815 by  
a Britishsurgeonwho had served in India for 20 years,  
and was triggered by British press reports about how  
Maratha soldiers who had lost their noses in the Anglo-  
Mysore wars were surgically set right in Pune. There was  
no European competition to so-called ‘Indian Nose’, so  
Indic claims onplasticsurgeryseem to be on solid  
ground.
