Panini has been accepted as the father of BN form and well. It wasn't taught so in Compiler Design theory when I did my BTech in late 80s, but even later read that Chomsky suggested that BN form should be called BNP form. Donald Knuth also gives credit to Panini.

Even otherwise, the very fact that there was nothing called linguistics before 200 years except Panini should suffice.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
