**Place Value Numeration System**

  

Only three cultures, as far as we know, invented a place value numeration system: the Mayans, the Babylonians, and the Hindu people of India. The current, almost planetary wide, place value numeration system is derived from the Hindu system. It was transmitted to western Europe by the Moslem world.
