//As I indicated before you should state the context of such a question  

and your preparation on the subject.  

Please express your viewpoint clearly in a paragraph.//  
  
  
  
I am not sure I exactly understand what you are asking me to write about, but I will give it a try. I asked a question whether any ancient knowledge of India had an impact on modern western science or technology. It is said that Heisenberg or Schrodinger (one of them, I dont remember which one, both are pioneers in quantum mechanics) was inspired by advaita vedAnta. Oppenheimer quoted from the bhagavad gIta when he saw the atom bomb explode. Quantum mechanics is one of the strangest theories of Physics and it reminds me of the anirvachanIya mAyA of advaita vedanta (though I am personally not comfortable with the logical foundation of advaita). However, it may not remind others of the same. The role of observer and what constitutes an observer in quantum mechanics, might be weakly connected to advaita vedAnta's drishTi-srishTi vAda, IF conscious observers have any special place (this is by no means guaranteed). I have also heard that the idea of innoculation against deadly diseases like smallpox was present in ancient India.  
  
  
Meanwhile, in the field of Mathematics, the medieval Kerala school of Mathematics made lot of progress, though I dont know whether these developments reached Westerners. It is also said that the ancient Indians knew that the number pi is an irrational number, though once again I cannot confirm this. It is well known that the modern numerals including the concept of zero came from ancient India. (The importance of this cannot be understated). Unfortunately these are called Arabic numerals because the Arabs took them to west and we are working in a Euro-centric framework.  
  
These are some things that I can think of immediately.
