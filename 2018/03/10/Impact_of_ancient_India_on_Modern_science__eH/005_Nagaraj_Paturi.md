### [The Indic (or Indian) Contribution to Grammar, Linguistics, and the Philosophy of Language](http://ratiojuris.blogspot.in/2017/09/the-indic-or-indian-contribution-to.html "Permanent link") [“Pāṇini’s work became known in 19th-century Europe, where it influenced modern linguistics initially through Franz Bopp, who mainly looked at Pāṇini. Subsequently, a wider body of work influenced Sanskrit scholars such as Ferdinand de Saussure, Leonard Bloomfield, and Roman Jakobson. Frits Staal (1930–2012) discussed the impact of Indian ideas on language in Europe. After outlining the various aspects of the contact, Staal notes that the idea of formal rules in language– proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in 1894 and developed by Noam Chomsky in 1957– has origins in the European exposure to the formal rules of Pāṇinian grammar.In particular, de Saussure, who lectured on Sanskrit for three decades, may have been influenced by Pāṇini and****Bhartṛhari; his idea of the unity of signifier-signified in the sign somewhat resembles the notion of*sphoṭa*. More importantly, the very idea that formal rules can be applied to areas outside of logic or mathematics may itself have been catalysed by Europe’s contact with the work of Sanskrit grammarians.”  ](http://ratiojuris.blogspot.in/2017/09/the-indic-or-indian-contribution-to.html "Permanent link")
