Its a bit diverting from this thread but it is of the topic of Bharatiya influence over the west.

Do we have a creation theory of the sun? Do we have something that says what or how was the sun created?  
I've observed that there are 12 adityas, most commonly used as paryayas to surya in loka. But there has been nothing in common with Agni. I do not think that there is any relation of Surya with Agni.

But, we find the dvandva - mitraavarunau, in Vedas and even sometimes in Loka. Mitra refers to one of the Adityas and Varun refers to water. How are water and sun connected possibly?

\*\*\*  
Initially, it was believed for millenniums that the sun is a ball of fire, but nobody was sure about it. After the quantum revolution, we came to kmow about the fact that the sun is a very large ball of hydrogen plasma, which produces energy by fusing light nuclei into heavier nuclei. It is hydrogen and helium together causing nuclear fusion resulting in huge amounts of energy.

Also, sun cannot be fire as there isn't any oxygen in it.

Can it be that mitraavarunau is a hint to helium and hydrogen perhaps? Varun is water, so is H20 right?

If it permits, I'll post this into a new thread or perhaps not?

Regards.  
Rishi.
