Just some observations...  

  

The usage of Ginger as a supplement is different from using it as a medicine. Meaning the usage in 'wet form' and 'dry form' are totally different. Except in Ayurveda - that too very rarely, except as part of fresh tonic /anupaana, wet ginger is used. In TCM and in Thai medicine only the dry ginger (respective gingers of each country) is used and not the wet ginger. I have collected Galangal (Thai ginger - dry), American Ginseng, Chinese Ginseng and also Ling zhi (Reshi) - using any one of this for culinary purpose is not advised because these are meant for medicine.

  
Indian ginger = (Food) = Zingiber officinale

Indian turmeric = Curcuma longa  

Indian turmeric = (skin application) = Curcuma aromatica (Kasturi Manjal in Tamil)  

Chinese ginger = Boesenbergia rotunda

Thai ginger = Galangal = Alpinia galanga

Thai turmeric = Kha min = Curcuma domestica

  

Even though all the above are Rhizobium and contains Curcumin as one of the main ingredient - all are not same and certainly in one's place another can't be used even for cooking and how can one be used in another's place for medicine.

  

As per Ayurveda - when one can't use आर्द्रिका (wet ginger) in the place of शुण्ठी (dry ginger) - example in त्रिकटु.

  

In some folk systems of medicine in India in the past, tobacco was used as anesthesia during surgery and in some other place "Ganja" was used as I head; whereas in Kerala the "Leach" was used primarily (the famous Nelluvai Dhanwantari temple in Kerala depict Bhagavan with a Leach in one hand - signifying Surgery)

  

Therefore as per Dr. Nishteshwar (one of the well known Dravya-Guna expert) - we should not attempt compare or equate our medicine systems, ingredients, principles one-on-one with the Western medicinal systems - the purpose, philosophy and usage - all differs.

  

Thus I second Dr. Kannan's views

  

Thanks.
