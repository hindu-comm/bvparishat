Dear Prof. Paturi,  

  
What you say is quite true.  
  

But even more basic is the flaw in thinking - that whatever modern science declares or certifies is alone the truth, or the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; or the one that can be most useful and helpful, and one conducing most to human welfare.  
  
And worse - that our ancient sages were struggling to discover, and give expression to, *the very truths* that modern science is unravelling; whence even simple truisms that may bear the barest of similitude to the statements of modern scientists is imagined to give us a boost, and make us proud! "Oh, we too had science, you see" - attitude, which puts our pundits under pressure to *somehow* show that there is so much of science in Sanskrit; as if it goes without saying : "or else, all our ancient sastra-s are but a bundle of superstitions, after all"!  
  

This terrible - actually horrible - inferiority complex has to go. (And a good many of us cannot differentiate between science and technology!)  
  

A saner attitude would perhaps be :  
Our sages worked on *what they thought were important* in life; sure, some ideas in science or mathematics as we know today had occurred to them too; and if they eschewed further development of knowledge in certain directions, it was possibly consciously - for the reason that such developments did not conduce to what they perceived as essential to *dignified* human life, to not squandering our resources. And well, if some of the sages could hypothetically visit our present state of "civilisation" and "progress" today, they would only have been repulsed by, spurned, and indicted some of the current "developments" - and with inordinate indignation; but no, we would rather cherish what they would never relish, than get damned "You are no equal to the West!  

  

Ignoramuses as we are, we behave as though we have nothing else to be *really* proud of about our past. What if our sages did not discover the Laws of Motion stated by Newton, or what if there is nothing (for or) against the Theory of Evolution in what they wrote? Should we be compelled to insinuate some String Theory in our ancient texts? Or equate Sphota Theory with the Big Bang! Or that we discovered *everything* **before** others did *any*where else?  
  

Our capitulation began when our pundits moved heaven and earth - to *somehow* establish that we were not idolators (because our colonisers claimed they were not), or *somehow* show that we knew the Steam Engine or electricity: "*I am smart enough to re-interpret* Vedic texts (with the force of vyAkaraNa and nirukti) to *yield* these (or any) meanings or modern ideas!" Or the *anxiety* to show that we too had our communism (even if it was so crude, unfortunately)!  
  

"Be Yourself", was the message Coomaraswamy gave India when India got Independence!
