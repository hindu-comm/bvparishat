Dear Dr. BVK Sastry ji,  
  
You have brought to light two very interesting incidents, thank you.  
  
However, in case of Shishupala, the Ashareera Vani itself had told about the mere touch curing the deformities. Therefore, knowing the divine powers of Lord Krishna, only his mere touch would have cured the deformities. Hence, possibility of Lord Krishna performing some sort of Ayurvedic Surgery can be surely ruled out.  
  
Coming to the case of Jarasandha, even here any Ayurvedic (surgery) involvement can be ruled out through sheer logic: Jara, the Rakshasi who joined both the parts by accident could not have possibly used any Ayurveda because if that's true, then when Bhima separated his body into two parts, it used to join back again automatically till Lord Krishna signalled Bhima to separate the body parts and put it in reverse so that they can't join back together. Therefore, no Ayurveda was ever used even by Jara or by Bhima as Bhima was trying to kill him; hence split him and surely he would not have any intention to join back the body parts.
