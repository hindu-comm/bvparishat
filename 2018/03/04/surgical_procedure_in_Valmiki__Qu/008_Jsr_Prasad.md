Respected Dr. Murthy garu,  
  

In that sense, each one of us will have our own predispositions and prejudices on each and every literary piece that we encounter. Is it possible to generalize our beliefs based on our intuition. Aesthetic, ontological, epistemological, metaphysical meanings would have been brushed aside if you just consider the 'technical' aspects of the verses. Everyone need not be satisfied, but some शिष्टs should be convinced in order to generalize one's beliefs, which is perfectly fine.  
  

Regards
