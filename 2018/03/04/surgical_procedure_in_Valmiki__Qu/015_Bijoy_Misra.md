The particular sarga might appear discontinuous from a storytelling point of view, but

is a brilliant poetic addition. Such insertion of poetic elements on occasion seems like

a signature of the genius. He ends the previous Chapter with Trijata and a glimmer

of hope that the dream communicates to Sita. Then the poets describes the state

of Sita to help create the poetic contrast. I loved it and then finally I encoutered

the stanza that I cited. I thought it was brilliant. It is a story of any hostage anywhere

who is lonely, caged and terrorized. Valmiki's characterization has psychology in it.

We know many women are threatened in the world, but nobody has written about

their mental state under the threat conditions. I do admire the effort immensely.

I also wonder if it reflects any social condition that the poet wishes to educate.

  

My father was a poet. He wrote about the social conditions. Valmiki's Sita

is a woman who is typical probably of all women anywhere in the world.
Women

are speaking out and resisting the threats lately. Some should also describe the

mental state under threat. It would be a great educational story. Valmiki is a

champion of the women in cages. The case in point is a social mystery to me

as i see my granddaughters coming to age.

  

The surgery in the womb would be a pure empirical process. Discovery that

dead tissues are injurious is due to Sushruta. You can burn them (heat treatment),

dry them out (air treatment), wash them off (water treatment) or physically

remove them (शल्यक्रिया). The latter has instruments involved in cutting to pieces

for the removal process. Various instruments of different shapes resembling bird beaks

apparently were in use. As I observe, such mapping is insightful and empirical. 

It is "linear" in the sense of human civilization.
