Yes, on parameters the sarga is said to be a प्रक्षिप्त?

  

So far, we use to have the comfort of claiming -



\- Ancient Indians do know some 'science'

  
- Highly evolved medical science was evidently found in ancient times

  

\- Surgical procedures and several instruments were part of that science.

  

\- A fully flourished scientific branch of metallurgy
