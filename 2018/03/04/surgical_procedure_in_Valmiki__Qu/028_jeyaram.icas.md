I agree. However, there appears to be a qualitative difference between the ghee spoken highly in the scriptures v/s what we consume today. Perhaps, the scriptures meant the ghee prepared from the **A2-Cow's milk** (Desi Cow) which had Proline compared to **A1-Cow's milk** (dairy cow) which has predominantly histidine.
