hariH OM,

  

When the question of one tract being prakShipta or not is being discussed, the scholar introduces extra material (unproven prakShipta-ness of AdityahRRidaya) and assumes that everything is understood.

  

One cannot accept this as responsible scholarship.

  

In fact the Tiikaakaaras across schools of thought have devoted a great amount of explanation to AdityahRRidaya and it is the most dilated-upon tract in the whole of vAlmiiki rAmAyaNa.

  

To insinuate prakShipta-ness to AdityahRRidaya is mere scurrilous scholarship.

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
