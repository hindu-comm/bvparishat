Respected Scholars,

With all humility may I submit that the matter of whether a particular portion of text is "prakshipta" or not cannot be decided to every one's satisfaction. A scholar's mindset also plays a part. When I read this sargaalong with the previous and the succeeding one I see some sort of a discontinuity in narration and style, a discontinuity not unlike that of "Adityahrudaya". If that is not sufficient reason to declare it to be "prakshipta', I am wrong.

Regards,

Murthy
