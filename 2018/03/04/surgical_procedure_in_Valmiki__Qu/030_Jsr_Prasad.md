Yes! We compare गवय, a bovine animal, with domestic गौः while describing upamāna-pramāṇa. Similarity is the common feature here. A1 Cow's milk looks like A2 cow's milk. Only there is a rūpasādṛśya but not 'guṇasādṛśya,' in the said milk. Cow means 'Desi Cow' only. Sri CG Krishna murthy's explanation on nuances involved in context of ginger even go further in to the pharmaco-dynamics of the same dravyas.
