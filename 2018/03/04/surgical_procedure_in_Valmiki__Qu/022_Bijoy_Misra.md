This looks like a story. It is like Kunti giving birth through mnatra etc.

Preservation of tissues in ghee was probably practiced. The dead

body of Dasaratha is stated to be preserved for Bharata to show up

for cremation. I have heard that application of ghee heals wounds.

Charaka talks about it.
