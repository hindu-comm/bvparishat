I am not sure if "dismiss" is the right strategy.

It depends upon where one puts Sushruta in chronology.

There are many other topics that could be discussed

In the particular case, removal of an aborted baby for the

survival of the mother could be the concept.

It is a standard procedure now as I encounter mothers in the Temple..
