What is the difference between story telling and history?

  

Would the epics and such historic texts in Sanskrit stood the test of time had they been composed the way modern histories are written?

  

The epics and more particularly the Mahabharata have tried to reveal the inner dynamics of history which mainly is the result of the reflections of individuals on the main stage. In this sense the epics deal more with personalities than events. This brings universality of time into history.

History is also called the mother of all sciences because here you find clues to the level of development of technology. For eg. Bows, arrows, chariots and the like. How were the injured treated in those days would have been a more interesting topic for the thread.

  

The aspects being dealt with in this thread do not appear to be the main intention of the epics. For epics to stand the test of time the compilers must surely appeal to the imagination of the reader so that relationship between individuals are put into focus. 

  

How would those sages of yester years describe the conditions emanating in the middle East or the most recent developments in Korea? Do leaders and their personalities not play crucial roles in the outcome?
