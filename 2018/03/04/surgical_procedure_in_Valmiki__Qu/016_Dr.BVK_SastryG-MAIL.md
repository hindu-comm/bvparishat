Namaste



May I request and suggest for a reframe of the issue debated here :



***Focus of Issue As Debated***:



"Oh, we too had science, you see" - attitude, \< we discovered *everything* **before** others did *any*where else? \> ? \< "a*subconscious*aspiration to"live up to" the expectations/standards of the modern/Western critics ?"Lest they disapprove....">



***Suggested as below for Reframing for deliberation***:



“ Can we stand up and establish what our texts say, and show why \< Sages worked on what they thought were important in life’> ? \< as essential to *dignified* human life \> , and make us \< really proud of our past> ? Can we find a Genetic Engineering Technology that can produce a second ‘ Rama-bhakta Hanuman’ who would match up to the statements made in ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ ?





***To get back the Comfort of** : ***



\- Ancient Indians do know some 'science'

  
- Highly evolved medical science was evidently found in ancient times



\- Surgical procedures and several instruments were part of that science.



\- A fully flourished scientific branch of metallurgy





***And AVOID blaming ‘ PUNDITS’ and Figure out positive helpful
ways to improve the lot of ‘ Guardians and load carriers of Texts of Tradition ( including the prakshiptas) ’** ? ***



Who have suffered for over three centuries from Colonial scholars in the pre-independence period and ‘ Oriental Scholars ( - the native successors and guardians of Colonial Scholar ship) of post independence era who ignored to unify the two statements of
tradition ‘ Jnanam Vijnana Sahitam’ and ’ tadviddhi pranipathena, pariprashnena sevayaa, updekshyanti te jnanam. Jnaninah Tatvadarshinah’.



Instead of this, the oxymoron model of research adapted is ‘ hybridization of material , social, linguistic and anthropological studies with a social slant from west , carrying layers of complexity drawn from ‘Theological and Teleological backdrop’
yielding a seamless knowledge of Continuum of Cosmology – Consciousness- Life Matter relations, Body- Psyche- Spirit disconnects ’ and ‘ challenges of Bad, poor and motivated translations’. Added to this is the spice of chauvinism and evangelical attitude .





It is an enigma as to Why modern scholars ( Nootana – Rushi’s - ?? ) fail to have clarity on HOW TO AVOID MAKING INAPPROPRIATE COCKTAIL
MIXING of focus of each individual science- Knowledge Disciplines with the nomenclature as ‘ Vedas, Upavedas, Itihasa, Purana, Tantra, aagama, Jyotisha, Kavya, Shaastra ‘ – All using ONE LANGUAGE STANDARD
called ‘ SAMSKRUTHAM ! In this specific case, issue of ‘ Ayurveda’ as ‘ upa-veda’ is tagged on to ‘ surgery’ of modern medicine. Do we see clearly the paradigm of Ayurveda is ‘ Veda – Mantra- Aushadha’ in restoring the ‘ chopped off limb’ and this paradigm is NOT present/ NOT accepted / NOT acceptable to the modern science ? Why ? Ayurveda works on the elementals of ‘ Panchabhoota – Saptadhatu- Prana’ , and uses ‘Shareera – Jeeva ‘ concepts which are totally alien to the ‘philosophy and Practice of Modern Medicine and Pharma models of health care and surgery’. 



No one in the sane-sense in modern sciences would make an argument
with mix up and mess up on goals of different disciplines of sciences
and go to pass a judgment statement that the goal of ‘physics / Veda ’ as a science – knowledge discipline is same as ‘goal of chemistry / Upa-Veda ’ as another science- knowledge discipline; and mixes up the
‘ postulates of matter from quantum physics ( Cf: Veda using Atmaa – Kosha Chaitanya) to bio-pharma chemistry formulations ( Cf: Ayurveda using Panchabhjoota – Prana –Sapta dhatu- Naadi)and medical practice ’.
When Harvard uses the term ‘ Energy Medicine’ it all becomes acceptable !

Google and explore ‘ Harvard Energy Medicine’ leading to the You-Tube link <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfOQDJOm1-4> . A comment on the channel reads : “ Did you know Harvard Medical School has one of the largest energy medicine programs in the world? Something that is often touted as meaningless is being studied deeply at one of the most prestigious schools in the world. CE News talks to Natalie Trent about her work at Harvard in energy medicine.”





Would this shift in ‘ Point of View’ ( Darshana- Pradarshana Sthaana)
help to channel the research resources in the direction of ‘ Proper UTILITY ( VINIYOGA) of Traditional Samskruth-Resources of Bharat ‘ -
as Dr. Yadu keeps pointing in his posts ?
