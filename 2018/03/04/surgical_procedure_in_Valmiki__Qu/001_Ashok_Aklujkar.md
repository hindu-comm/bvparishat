Vālmīki-rāmāyaṇa Sundara-kāṇḍa, sarga 28, verse 6 in the edn. with Govinda-rāja’s commentary. Other edn.s may have this verse in sarga 26.

  

If “surgical procedure” is taken in a rudimentary sense, then there is a reference to surgery here. As Govinda-rāja correctly indicates, the reference is to a cutting done by a barber because the life of a delivering woman will otherwise be lost — in a kind of 'sarva-nāśe samutpanne ardhaṁ tyajati paṇḍitaḥ’ situation.
