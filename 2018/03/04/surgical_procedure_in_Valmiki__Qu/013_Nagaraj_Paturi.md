Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

It is not always "a*subconscious*aspiration to"live up to" the expectations/standards of the modern/Western critics ?"Lest they disapprove...."

  

Some of us believe religiously only in***a linear development of knowledge***- which means**:**newer knowledge has to be better , older knowledge has to be poorer , if knowledge better than or equal to the modern knowledge is claimed to be /seen to be in older texts, the claim of that knowledge in that text or the antiquity of the text must be suspected

  

 If you say that knowledge that is believed to be only a modern discovery /invention is found in ancient in Sanskrit texts, for these believers in ***linear development of knowledge*** -, then immediately the "prakshipta" view comes very handy to brush aside knowledge better than or equal to the modern knowledge that is claimed to be /seen to be in older texts.
