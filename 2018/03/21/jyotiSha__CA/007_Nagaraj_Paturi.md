There are interesting issues in the areas connecting phalita jyotisha and siddhaanta jyotisha.

  

The highly fundamental question of whether vaidika phalita jyotisha is of purely Hellenistic in origin or are there Indian roots of it too is an open and high impact research topic.

  

On another list, there was a long discussion on this topic. Some of the discussants were themselves practitioners of astrology. From their frequent posts I understand that they make use of a very big number of
Sanskrit sources. Yet, they insist that " Vedic Astrology" is a wrong nomenclature.

Raahu and Ketu is another interesting topic.

  

There was a discussion here:
