While we are happy to note a sudden spurt in membership requests to BVP, we would like to request the applicants for membership to use the link:

  

<https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/subscribe>  

  

in stead of writing individually to the moderator(s).

  

Apart from the extra work to the moderators which can somehow be managed, this makes the memberships requests getting overlooked over a period of time as moderators are not at the moderating desk 24/7 and by the time they sit in front of the system, there can be many mails to be attended by them.

  

<https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/subscribe>  

  

places all the requests in a queue in the moderating panel. There is no chance of oversight by the moderator.

  

Of course, suspicious, identity hiding, membership requests are rejected during scrutiny.

  

Except those all other requests are approved just in a click.

  

Applying through

  

<https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/subscribe>

  

is quick, easy and oversight-proof.
