Patañjali describes the Brāhmins as "gauraḥ, śucyācāraḥ etc.", while he says that a person sitting in the market and looking as dark as a heap of black lentils (māṣarāśivarṇa) would not be identified as a Brahmin.
There are also some rules about different complexions of different characters in drama given in the Nāyṭyaśāstra "śakāstu gaurāḥ kartavyāḥ etc.".
