**THE VATA SKIN TYPE**

**Vata**skin in general is dry, thin, cool to the touch, easily gets dehydrated, and is very vulnerable to the influence of dry, windy weather. Theymay become excessively dry, rough or flaky, or be subject to dry eczema or skin fungus when out of balance.

This type of skintends to wrinkle more as it ages, due to the dryness of Vata dosha. It can take on a grayish or dull quality if your digestion is not in balance. If you have Vata skin, you are particularly sensitive to mental stress, which tends to show up in a tired, stressed look.

If you have Vata skin, your skin doesn’t retain as much moisture as other skin types. For that reason,***adding moisture is your priority.***For Vata skin to stay youthful, skin care products used should be very nurturing. They must include some essential oils or herbs in combination which can nourish the skin and rehydrate it; otherwise, it may be susceptible to wrinkles and premature aging.

A Vata-pacifying lifestyle — like going to bed on time, eating three regular meals, and following a regular daily routine — are essential components of a holistic approach to Vata skin care, as are eating foods that help balance Vata and nourish the Vata skin.  
**THE PITTA SKIN TYPE**

**Pitta**skin is more fair or rosy in color, soft, warm to the touch, and of medium thickness. These qualities, along with blond or red-colored hair, correspond to the warm, fiery Pitta dosha. When out of balance, Pitta skin types can suffer from skin rashes, breakouts, acne, liver spots or rosacea. Pitta skin is usually more sensitive. Emotional stress can cause you to blush when embarrassed, or experience breakouts, canker sores or rashes when under stress.

Also, the Pitta skin type tends to have more breakouts, photosensitivity, less tolerance to hot food, and less tolerance to fieriness in temperament. It tends to be more prone to freckles and moles than the other skin types.

If you have Pitta skin, your treatment program should focus on***calming your sensitive skin***. You’ll want to stay away from excessive heat and too much direct sunlight. Tanning salons, steam facials and long hours in the sun can damage your skin.

The Pitta skin type needs both cooling and nurturing. Use skin care products that help enhance resistance to the sun.

The ayurvedic herb***Flame-of-the-Forest***can help protect Pitta skin from photosensitivity. But like other ayurvedic herbs, Flame-of-the-Forest needs to be used in combination with other herbs.  
**THE KAPHA SKIN TYPE**

**Kapha**dosha is predominantly water and earth. Kapha skin tends to have all the qualities of water and earth. It can be greasy, thick, and more tolerant of the sun. It is cool to the touch and is thicker, softer, oilier and smoother than the other two types.

People with Kapha skin don’t tend to form wrinkles until very late in life. When out of balance, Kapha skin can suffer from excessive oiliness, enlarged pores, blackheads, pimples, moist types of eczema and water retention.

***Proper cleansing is the most important thing you can do for Kapha skin.***Frequent deep cleansing should be the basis of your beauty regimen. You’ll also want to avoid eating foods that are excessively oily and heavy. Eat more light, astringent and bitter foods, such as cooked vegetables prepared with Kapha-pacifying spices. Olive oil in small quantities is a good cooking oil for Kapha types. It is light and easy to digest. Make sure you exercise every day to keep your body’s detoxification and digestion systems in good order.

Kapha skin, because of its thickness and oiliness, is more prone to accumulate ama (toxins) under the skin. People with Kapha skin need to do detoxification on a regular basis — both internal detoxification and external detoxification to flush toxins from the skin.

Scrubbing the skin with a gentle exfoliating clay such as bentonite clay can help external cleansing. Kapha skin types may also need to take herbal formulations to cleanse the skin from within.



**THE “COMBINATION” SKIN TYPES:**

1.  **Vata-Pitta**, skin that is both dry and sensitive; 2.  **Kapha-Pitta**, or oily and sensitive skin; and 3.  **Vata-Kapha**, skin that is generally dry with some oily zones.

The ayurvedic approach to caring for combination skin takes into account environmental and seasonal factors.

For example, a person with Vata-Pitta skin would follow the recommendations for Pitta skin in summer and Vata skin in winter. The Kapha-Pitta type would follow Pitta recommendations in summer and Kapha recommendations in winter. The Vata-Kapha type would be best served by generally following Vata guidelines, with extra cleansing of the oily zones.
