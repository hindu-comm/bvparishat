Dear Colleague,

An unprofessional Sanskritist whose name might have been Johnson, a military man as far as I remember, compiled an Upanishadic anthology that was reprinted by a Delhi publisher. Please enquire at MLBD.

I am living temporarily without my library, so I cannot give the full information

Best wishes

DB
