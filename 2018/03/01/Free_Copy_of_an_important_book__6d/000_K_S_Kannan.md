Dear All,  
  

Happy Holikotsava!  
  

As you are aware, Infinity Foundation India has been holding a series of conferences entitled Swadeshi Indology Conferences. The primary concern of these conferences is to present the Indic/insider perspective as a contrast to the writings of many of the Indologists who are used to evaluating or presenting Indic heritage through an essentially Western lens.  
  
Select papers presented at the conferences are being published as a series of volumes of which I am the editor.  
  
Many in our list had made specific enquiries regarding the publication and availability of the Proceedings of the conferences. Only recently, Volume 1 entitled *Western Indology and Its Quest for Power* (277pp., Demy 1/8) has been published.  
  
The book is priced nominally at Rs. 175/= and is available from Amazon.  
  

However I have received a few copies of the book for **free** **distribution**. Those among you who may be interested in procuring a free copy (and are residing in India) are welcome to write to me privately with **your postal address**.  
As the copies are limited, I can gift them only on a first-come-first-served basis.  
  

Again, please note : DO NOT reply to bvparishat id (unnecessarily spamming the group)  
**Write to me directly at [ks.kann...@gmail.com]()**

  

Regards for all
