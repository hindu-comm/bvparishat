I have heard from my father that Kal vaitha vaaram ( கல் வைத்த வாரம்) had been conducted as a ritual in temples and public religious functions. If the stones are spread somebody should successfully recite exactly 250 words with all the वेषण 's and without any पुनरुक्ति. Scholars participate in the competition in turn till someone successfully completes the task. I have heard from our elders that such a ritual was conducted in our village (agraharam) called Nochur in the Palakkad district of Kerala. My father Brahmasri N. R. KRISHNA SASTRI has won Kal vaitha vaaram. He is no more. But what I understand is that this examination does not spread for several days. I may be wrong.
