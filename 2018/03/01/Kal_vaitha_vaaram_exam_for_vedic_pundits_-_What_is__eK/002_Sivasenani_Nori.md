Very interesting.

  

In the undivided AP, there is a tradition called zillasabhalu. Used to happen for 3 days in 90s with the last day having many adhyaapakas and the candidates who passed the test earlier. For the last 12 years we (Nori Charitable Trust) have been conducting a Vedasabhaa modelled on the sabhaa of the adhyapakas. In that all scholars sit in pairs in a circle. Adhyaksha starts with a ghana panasa (Telugu word for group of 50 words). The next pair continues. It goes on till all GhanapaaThis finish. Then the KramapaaThins pick it up and continue. If there are scholars of Rigveda in the sabhaa, they start. Suklayajurveda scholars follow the Krishnayajurvedins. Samaveda and Atharvaveda are recited last. In this manner twelve rounds are conducted: 7 for samhitaa, 3 for braahmana and one each for aaraNyaka and upanishad.

  

The adhyaksha starts at a random place in every round. So only those with complete mastery participate. Any deviation in a single akshara or svara is immediately known because apart from the designated pair, others are also usually reciting.

  

This sabhaa happens on the first Sunday after vinaayakachaviti, usually at Sankaramatham, Nallakunta, Hyderabad.
