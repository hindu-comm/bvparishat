There is a practice of 'samhita parayanam' where just the samhita, end to end, will be recited, sometimes over a few days. There is also another '(samagra) veda parayanam' where up to aranyaka (upanishads) too is recited, which will also take a few days to complete, even when done morning till evening, with breaks for food, anushthanam, etc. A person known to me had this done in his house a few years ago for Krishna Yajur veda. The scholars stayed in his house till the end.
