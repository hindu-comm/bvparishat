Namaste



1. Just highlighting one very significant passage and line in the post of Ramesh Kn which the fast readers may miss ! Those days are not millennia or centuries ago ! It is just decades that still persist with living scholars and active tradition alive. But the tragedy is this ‘ traditional excellence’ is turning out to be a ‘museum piece of
scholarship of a past period ’ . How are traditionalists planning to transmit this veda- learning and practice excellence to be relevant for the current society and provide a ‘ decent livelihood’ for ‘ graduating students at these gurukuls’ ? What supplemented education is needed to make these ‘veda- vrata –snaatakas’ to have a ‘decent livelihood’ beyond recourse to ‘ paurohitya / archaka vrutti’? and pass on the baton of Vedic learning to the next generation.



Beyond lip sympathy and occasional honor, what actions are there to restore’ Saanga - Shadanga –Vedanga adhyayana’ and become a ‘Shrotriyam Brahmanishtham’ - either at Gurukuls or the Universities ? In other words, beyond a faith endorsed profession, what is the relevant profession for a ‘ Shrotriya Braahmana after snaatakam at veda- Gurukulam’? 



**In the video, Brahmasri. Sathanur Ghanapadigal himself explains I exceeded about 15 padams on one day, which scholars did not accept. Then Mahaperiyavaa recommended to them quoting in normal maths exam if a pupil answers 12 questions instead of 10 questions will you not give more marks.. **

****

**Scholars did not relent and told mahaperiyavaa this is not maths exam. This is a vedic exam.. **

****

**Such is the strictness with which veda samrakshanam was done those days.**



2. If one needs to take this as a reference of Traditional Vedic Examination Standard for which the Guru-Kul training is meant / was meant, where would one position the ‘Scholar-ship of Vedas at the Universities’ ?



A point on which I seek the opinion of concerned scholars pl
