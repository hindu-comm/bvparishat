Apropos the Vedarambha ceremony in the Upakarma, l had raised a doubt some time back in this forum. It stands unanswered. May l repeat the same. Among the vedas and vedangas the Itihasa ( i.e. the beginning portion of ltihasa) is also recited. We the Tamil Iyers of Palakkad region recite a passage as the initial section of Itihasa which runs as follows : वृषा दर्विकुलं हवि: शिबि कुलं बभूव। तस्यायमितिहासः कुलविद्या बभूव। New generation priests may not be knowing this passage. I remember vividly this passage. My question is this : Has any one come across such a work starting with the said passage and known in the name of Itihasa?
