नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

What you said is akin to ब्रह्मयज्ञ (extended form) prescribed in स्वाध्यायब्राह्मणम् of तैत्तिरीयारण्यकम् -- पञ्च वा एते महायज्ञाः ....।

  

As per the tradition , the first मन्त्र / सूत्रम् / श्लोक is recited . For इतिहास , it will be the first verse of रामायण and

महाभारत । भगवद्गीता added following ब्राह्मणवसिष्ठन्याय ।

  

What you have quoted is prose and the same is not recited / known elsewhere . So it may be from a text that was popular

and used as a ग्रन्थ for पारायण by शिष्ट s around Palakkad . May be it was treated on a par with इतिहास due to some semblance

of structure / contents of both the popular works.

  

तस्यायम् इतिहासः कुलविद्या बभूव -- here the term इतिहास is लाक्षणिक - ’ कुलविद्या ’ - is उपोद्बलकम् of it .

  

Had it been known , anyone from the galaxy of scholars would have certainly answered your question .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
