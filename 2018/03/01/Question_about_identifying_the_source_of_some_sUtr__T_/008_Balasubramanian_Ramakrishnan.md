Dear List members,

  

Thanks to everyone who replied. It’s interesting to know that about the brahmayajnam in Andhra. The Tamil Apastambins say only the beginning of the 4 Vedas. It’s only during upAkarma many other things are recited. May I ask which sUtra you follow? In many cases Bodhayanas have a much longer ritual than Apastambins in Tamil Nadu. But, I don’t know about the brahmayajnam of Bodhayanas in Tamil Nadu.

  

Ramakrishnan
