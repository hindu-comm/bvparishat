Sir

  

These words (for they are words, not sootras), are a part of the Brahmayajnam (one of the five mahayajnas) and occur in the Upaakarma because the entire Brahmayajna part occurs in the Upaakarma. Brahmayajna itself refers to svadhyaaya. This is required to be done everyday to repay Rishi-riNa. As a part of it, mantras from all the Vedas (the starting ones of the saMhitaa; in our case, mantras from all the four bhaagas of TaittirIyaSaakha are included), Vedangas, six Darsanas, Manusmriti, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavata and Tantra are included. Vedangas are represented by Niruktam. According to Sayanacharya, Niruktam starts with the list of words mentioned by you; but according to Lakshman Svarup, manuscript evidence names the first five adhyaayas containing lists of words as nighaNTu and the latter twelve adhyayas containing explanations as Niruktam. Following this nomenclature, the Nighantu - in the first three chapters - lists words of the same meaning together (according to the tradition of Nirukta, there can be no complete synonyms, so "same" should be understood as roughly the same); thereby, the meanings of all the words are known, if the meaning of at least one is known. This list is said to be compiled by Kasyapa Prajaapati, to help the latter day people understand the meaning of Vedic words. Yaska wrote a commentary on it which is now called the Niruktam (strictly speaking, then Niruktam cannot be a Vedanga because tradition preserves - and Sayanacharya asserts to it - that Niruktam starts with the very list of words starting this post). Not going into the issue about the name, in the commentary of Yaskacharya, the entire first adhyaaya and the first three sections of the second adhyaaya are devoted to a discussion of the philosophy of Nairuktas and principles of etymology (in the main; but other issues are covered and many etymologies are given). The commentary proper starts in the fourth section of second chapter, with the word gauH and ends in the seventh section of the second chapter (with the sentence इतीमान्येकविंशतिः पृथिवीनामधेयान्युत्क्रान्तानि।).

  

On a separate note, I don't think I am qualified to answer the query of Sri NKS, but since the topic came up, let me add the relevant part. In the Brahmayajna that is recited in AP, Telangana amongst the Taittiriyas, the representative of Ramayana is तपःस्वाध्यायनिरतं तपस्वी ... and that of Mahabharata is नारायणं नमस्कृत्य ....
