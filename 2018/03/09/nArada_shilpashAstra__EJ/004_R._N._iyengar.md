Dr.Wakankar, I do not yet have the finalized cover page. I will certainly post the same once it is ready. What I have received so far is the publicity material. Perhaps the image was too large and hence it did not get displayed properly. I have condensed the size and hope this time it will appear correctly on your screen. I will share further details about date of book release, price, ISBN no etc as and when they become available.
