Narayana ji,

Can you share specific location and nearby landmark, Google maps location if possible.

There seem to be two locations for Jain University Jayanagar.

  

1. <https://goo.gl/maps/UHbGHmP9fcm>

2. <https://goo.gl/maps/bAQaihjPATy>

  

  

  

I don't want to miss it due to confusion.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashikant Joshi
