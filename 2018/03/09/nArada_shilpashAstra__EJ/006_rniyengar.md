Dear Dr.Wakankar,

Thanks for your kind words. In my eagerness to share the information with you and others I posted the draft sent to me by the press. You might have noticed an unnecessary s' in the English title. I am getting it corrected. I don't know how over Sanskritization (if it can be called so) happens at the hands of the designers! The figure you see on the cover page is a representation of नाटकशाला of Lesson 65.

  

Regards

RNI
