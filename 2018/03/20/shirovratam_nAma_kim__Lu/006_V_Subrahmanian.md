Dear Sir,

  

Many thanks for this information which looks like we are very close to the answer. If we are able to get at any vyakhyana/bhashya for these portions, if any, then more light may be available. What is interesting is the word 'paasupatavratam' too included in the list, which is legitimately, as we have seen, is there in the Atharva Shira Upanishat, which Sri Appayya Dikshitar has alluded to. So, A bhashya, of Sayana or any other, for this portion stated by you would be most helpful, I think.

  

warm regards
