namaste,

  

shri animesh nagar (blog: <https://animeshnagarblog.wordpress.com/>) writes that the paashupata vrata referred to in the rudra atharva sheersha is also called the shirovrata, and has shared the attached image of a tract therein (which appears to be what the the original post mentions as being quoted by appayya dikshitar).

  

The following are some related posts in the advaita list, in case they might have been missed:

There is also this mention -

in the[Śivārkamaṇidīpikā](https://github.com/gsireesh/CU-SARIT/tree/master/%C5%9Aiv%C4%81rkama%E1%B9%87id%C4%ABpik%C4%81):

bhaTTa bhAskara seems to mention shirovrata in the bhASya on the taittirIya samhitA. This document has it on the second page:

Hope these might be useful!

  

Humble regards,

Sathya
