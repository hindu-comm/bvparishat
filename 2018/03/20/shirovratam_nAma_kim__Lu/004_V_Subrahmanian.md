Thanks for the attachment that contains the paashupata vratam in the Atharva Shira upanishat. In many prints the words in the fifth mantra appear thus: 'यस्माद्व्रतमिदं पाशुपतं भस्म नाङ्गानि संस्पृशेत्' \| I checked in another edition which correctly gives the words as
'यस्माद्व्रतमिदं पाशुपतं भस्मनाङ्गानि संस्पृशेत्' which alone will give the correct meaning: one should apply bhasma in the various body parts: bhasmanaa angaani sampsprushet.

  

It now appears that the term shirovratam appears in at least three known sources: Devi Bhagavatam, Skanda Puranam and the Taittiriya Samhita bhashyam. The one that is not yet discovered by us is in the Atharva Veda that Shankara alludes to in the Mundaka Bhashyam. While the first two look like usage of bhasma and no fire, the third has use of fire but no bhasma. The Atharva veda source too appears to involve use of agni (and no bhasma).
