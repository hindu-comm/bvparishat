Thanks for the response and the references. The line stated by you in the Bhattabhaskara bhashya is:

  

![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/60565939fb75f/image.png?part=0.2&view=1)  
  

Taking it further, in the next page of the pdf is this line:

  

![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/60565939fb75f/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  
  

There is a term 'आतिथ्य' which might have a special meaning in the context of the yajna. This ' आतिथ्य is stated to be the शिरस्स्थानीय' of the yajna. It looks like the aatithya is figuratively called 'shirah' being its superior, primary, status in a yajna. Something like 'tarkashiromani' where the scholarship is very high. In the second image we have 'शिरस्स्थानीये आतिथ्ये तेजो दधाति स्थापयति. This appears to mean that 'aatithya' is some vessel or contrivance used in a yajna and agni is placed in it.

  

By a stretch of imagination one may connect this to Shankaracharya's commentary: शिरोव्रतं =शिरस्यग्निधारणलक्षणम्। यथा आथर्वणानां वेदव्रतं प्रसिद्धम्।Here we have the word 'shiras' and 'agnidhaaranam'. If by 'shiras' he figuratively meant the aatithyam of the above bhatta bhaskara bhashya, then the dhaaranam of agni in it, sthaapanam as said in the bhatta bhaskara bhashya, then there seems to be a connection.

  

Yet, Shankara bhashya says clearly that this ritual is 'prasiddha' among Atharvanika-s. Also Shankara's words give one the feeling of a literal bearing of fire on one's head. If all these are sorted out, maybe we arrive at a solution. Still, an explicit reference in the Atharvana Veda/samhita/brahmana for Shirovrata with the vidhanam as said in the Shankara bhashya यैश्च तत् चीर्णं विधिवत् यथाविधानं, then a clear picture will emerge.

  

Thanks once again for providing this Tai.Sam. bhashyam reference. Maybe a corresponding Sayana Bhashya for this very same portion will throw up some interesting thing.

  

I have also gone through the discussion links you have provided. I also wrote to Sri Animesh privately but have not got a reply yet.

  

warm regards
