You may check the Madhaviya Dhaturvritti it lists three meanings अदने आदाने अदर्शने. As per Ksirasvamin it is निरसने.

This seems to be a rare root. The word स्नसा seems to be derived from this root. It is explained by Hemachandra as स्नायु (cited in Vachaspatyam and Shabdakalpadrumah). One may refer the work by Hemachandra's lexicon and see how commentaries have explained the word.

  

Would be useful to see any other usages from this root.
