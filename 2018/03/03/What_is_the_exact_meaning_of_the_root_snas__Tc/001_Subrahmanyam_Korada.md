नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

One thing should be noted --

  

Panini did not assign any meaning to the roots of धातुs -- it was भीमसेन and others who offered some meaning .

  

धातूनाम् उपसर्गाणाम् निपातानां च अनेकार्थत्वम् - इति नियमः ।

  

One has to depend upon the usage and व्याख्यानम् for the meaning .

  

मृषः तितिक्षायाम् , परौ भुवो’वज्ञाने ( पा सू) etc are प्रमाणम् in stating that धातूनाम् अनेकार्थत्वम् is acceptable to Panini .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
