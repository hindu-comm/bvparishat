I was away in a place where wifi and data signals were not accessible consistently, when I saw this post in one of the flashes of access.

  

Now back at my place, I could read the article.

  

As always, Sri Nityanand-ji gave us a very good article with references to the Holi -related words and ideas and the festival of Kamadeva (Madana Mahotsava) with throwing of coloured water and coloured powder.

  

This[article](http://pravriddhayan.blogspot.in/2014/02/blog-post_4.html)
which is not as professionally written tries to give some references.

  

Sri Nityanand-ji earlier wrote an article on Holi songs and it was discussed[here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/RXJgBMG8xtY/n45Y3saZBAAJ;context-place=msg/bvparishat/LdQx9W2dYdU/VxAowmjXAQAJ)on BVP.

  

I recently shared my recent article[here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/LdQx9W2dYdU/VxAowmjXAQAJ;context-place=msg/bvparishat/RXJgBMG8xtY/n45Y3saZBAAJ)on BVP.
