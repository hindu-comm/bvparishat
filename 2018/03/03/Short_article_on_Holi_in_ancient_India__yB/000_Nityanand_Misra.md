Dear list

  

Some of you may be interested in my short article on Holi in ancient India published on Firstpost yesterday.

  

<http://www.firstpost.com/india/holi-in-ancient-india-from-kama-sutra-to-the-vedas-playing-with-colours-has-always-been-part-of-holi-festivities-4373243.html>  

  

Your comments and feedback are welcome.

  

Please note

1\) My title was "Holi in ancient India", the longer title was chosen by the editors.

2\) My preferred translation of *sveda* (as in the thirteen *sveda*-s in *Charaka Samhita*) is “sweat treatment”. My draft earlier had “steam bath” which I later edited to “sweat treatment”. The editors chose to retain “steam bath” in the para title and “sweat cleanse”.

  

Thanks, Nityananda Misra
