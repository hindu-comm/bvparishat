Dear Nityanandji,

  

An excellent and well. researched article. Congrats.

  

Sometimes,I feel that the Sanskrit field is deprived of persons like you,who are competent to undertake solid research,though,you are an asset to the field of banking.

Again congratulating you on your wonderful academic endeavour.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar
