I learned just now that the Vaidika Samshodhana Mandala publication is from 1988, and would not be out of copyright.

  

Chowkhambha Sanskrit Series published commentaryon chapters 1 to 20 in 1915. This would be out of copyright and I would be grateful if anybody can point to a digitized version of this publication.

  

The attached snapshot of the three publications is from<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2rL1RtLr2KkC&pg=PA46>
