The rudra-kalpa is supposed to be a text which gives details about the R^iShi, chhandas and devatA of each mantra along with the dhAyana shloka and the purashcaraNa vidhi. While I haven’t seen this text, these details are available from rudrabhAShya of abhinava shaMkara. A quick scan through the book does not however yield any references to this rudra-kalpa.
