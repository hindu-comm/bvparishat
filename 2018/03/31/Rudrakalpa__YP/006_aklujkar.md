When I read the verse, I took the second clause as meaning “That (= the praise of the Rudrādhyāya) will be given expression (by me) at length in the Rudra-kalpa.”

  

Must the Rudra-kalpa be a physically separate text — a self-standing text distinct from a subsequent part of Sāyaṇa’s Rudra Bhāṣya? Is there a part of the Rudrādhyāya which has kalpa as its theme/focus? Does Sāyaṇa praise the Rudrādhyāya while commenting on it? (I do not at present have access to the commentary to which you are referring.)

  

It is also possible to take *tad* as standing for ‘the sizeable (*bahu*) praise of the Rudrādhyāya which exists in the Smṛtis, Āgamas and Purāṇas’. In that case, my question would be: Is there a subsequent part of Sāyaṇa’s Bhāṣya, the commentandum of which has kalpa as its theme and which has citations from the Smṛtis, Āgamas and Purāṇas that praise the Rudrādhyāya?

  

(I consider the first understanding of the reference of tad to be preferable.)

  

If your answer to either question is in the negative, then only, it seems to me, we must look for a self-standing text different from the Rudrādhyāya that was called Rudra-kalpa. When commentators make a reference with a future tense form, they usually mean their own work or the commentandum of that work (the former, their own work’, more likely if the verb is passive as it is in the present case.
