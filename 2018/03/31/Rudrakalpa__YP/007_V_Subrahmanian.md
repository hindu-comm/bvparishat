Thank you Sri Aklujar, even I agree with the possibility that you have raised, by noticing the word 'abhidaasyate'. I am, with that possibility in mind, looking for a book by Sayana where he has cited

those references from the various scriptural sources that praise the Rudra adhyaya. Certainly his present book, a bhashya on the Rudra adhyaya, does not contain such references at all excepting that

(the Kaivalya and) Jabala Upanishads explicitly mention the Rudra Adhyaya as a means for moksha, which Sayana himself alludes to in his very introduction:

The above is followed by a paragraph that summarizes the entire Rudra adhyaya by showing its application in karma kaanda:

and so on. After this comes the real commentary on the Rudra adhyaya.

  

The book is available for download here:
