I am particularly interested in looking at the 'prashamsanam' of the 'rudraadhyaaya' that Sayanacharya says is abundantly available in the Rudra Kalpa. In the purashcaraNa vidhi, however, a lot of shlokas are given in praise of the God Rudra, the method of doing the homa/japa/dana/bhojana for brahmanas, etc. But the actual praise of the Rudra Adhyaya, the Vedic hymn, which is also called Rudropanishat, that Sayana says is contained in smritis, aagamas and puranas, are not discernible in the purashcharana vidhi portions. Hence my search for a supposed text called 'Rudra kalpa.'
