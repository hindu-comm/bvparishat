By the statement रुद्रकल्पेभिधास्यते it seems that Sayana is not referring to Srautakalpa. For, he quotes the relevant text of Apastambasrauta for the citihoma immediately after this prefatory statement.

In the next verse which follows the verse cited by Subramanian ji , he states that in the succeeding portion of the commentary, he intends to give a literal meaning of the mantra so as to facilitate one to understand the application of the mantra according to the Brahmana texts. (इह कर्माङ्गता यादृग्वर्णिता ब्राह्मणेन ताम्। बोद्धुं शब्दार्थमात्रस्य विवृतिः क्रियते स्फुटा।।) .

It seems that he refers to a separate work/tract of verses, a *kalpa* ( a practical manual) dealing with Abhisheka or Puja. There are such *Kalpa*-s in the गृह्यशेषसूत्र of Bodhayana.(Like Dugakalpa, Sreekalpa, Vishnukalpa, Ravikalpa etc.). In fact, there we get a रुद्रप्रतिष्ठाकल्प and a रुद्रस्नानार्चनाविधि.

By the verse cited by Subramanian ji he means this much : स्मृत्यागमपुराणेषु रुद्राध्यायप्रशंसनं बह्वस्ति। तद् विस्तरेण रुद्रकल्पे अभिधास्यते।

This स्मृत्यागमपुराणेषु रुद्राध्यायप्रशंसनं is indicated by Bhattabhaskara in his introductory remarks (to the commentary on Rudradhyaya) by citing many a praising statement.
