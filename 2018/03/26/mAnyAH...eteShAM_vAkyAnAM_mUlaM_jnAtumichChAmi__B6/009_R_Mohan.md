Namaste!

  

कार्त्तिकमहोदयाः - गारुडवचनं प्राचीनतममिति मन्ये ।

  

सुब्रह्मण्यमहोदयाः - I apologize for the fact that I presumed the earlier portion in the snapshot to be with the commentary but I just realized that actual commentary is as below and the one I had attached previously was in fact ब्रह्मसिद्धि’s prose and verse. But I have noticed that in many other places, मण्डनमिश्राः would use अत्राहुः, अत्रोच्यते, स्यादेतत्, अथ मतम्, …. before prose/verse when propounding his own statements / explaining / elaborating / clarifying / summarizing his previous statements. I have, therefore, to believe in म.म. कुप्पुस्वामी शास्त्री’s erudite analysis when he does not consider the said text to have its origin elsewhere.

Regarding शङ्खपाणि’s date, the only estimate that seems to be have been done is that he lived after आनन्दपूर्णः (14th century), who wrote भावशुद्धिः on ब्रह्मसिद्धिः. Since no other works attributed to शङ्खपाणिः have been discovered yet, the estimate has not progressed further.

  

Kind regards,

Mohan
