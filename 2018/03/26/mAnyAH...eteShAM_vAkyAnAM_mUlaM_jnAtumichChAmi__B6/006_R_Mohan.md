Namaste!

  

By “तत्राहुः” is meant, ‘here is the answer’ (to the point previously made). The snapshot is from the text, inclusive of the commentary by शङ्खपाणिः. I am not entirely sure whether these words are from the author or his commentator. What follows that, numbered 105 and 106, are definitely the ब्रह्मसिद्धिकारिकाs.

  

As a matter of fact, म.म. कुप्पुस्वामी शास्त्री, in the appendix to his compilation of ब्रह्मसिद्धिः along with the said commentary, says शालिकनाथः in his प्रकरणपञ्चिका and आनन्दबोधः in his न्यायमकरन्दः quote “अविद्यास्तमयः …” from ब्रह्मसिद्धिः.

  

Furthermore, शास्त्रीji also provides the original sources for those instances when मण्डन himself has quoted from other works like वेद, गीता, पुराण, शाबरभाष्य & others. But the above statement is nowhere else to be found.

  

Kind regards,

Mohan
