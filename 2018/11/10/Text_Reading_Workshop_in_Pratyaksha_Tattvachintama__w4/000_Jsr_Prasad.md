Dear Members,

  

Namaste.

  

Navya-Nyaya has a significant place in the Shastric domain. Gangesopadhyaya's Padartha-tattva-chintamani brought a revolution in the neo-logician's thought and the style has been subsequently adopted by many of his successors, irrespective of Shastra. Some prakarana granthas in Vedanta, Vyakarana etc., cannot be comprehended easily without conceptual understanding of Navya-Nyaya jargon.

  

Kavikulaguru Kalidasa Samskrita University is going to organize a 1 week text reading workshop on the Pratyaksha Tattvachintamani Vimarsah authored by legendary scholar, Prof. N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya Ji, who was a Guru and guiding light for many stalwarts and Scholars in Nyaya, other Shastras. A galaxy of scholars, including my Guru, will grace the occasion and teach the text in interactive mode.

  

I found that the registration, boarding and lodging are free, which is quite encouraging to many aspirants. Hope, all Shastra learning aspirants will utilize this great opportunity. Congratulations and thanks to Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi ji, the Vice Chencellor for this great initiative.

  

More details can be had from the attached flyer.

  

With regards,

Prasad
