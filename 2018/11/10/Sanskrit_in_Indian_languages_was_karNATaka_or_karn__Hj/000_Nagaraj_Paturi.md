Sir

  

I have also read de-Sanskritisation of Malayalam is going on now. Earlier Malayalam language had high percentage of Sanskrit words. Nowadays they are moving away from Sanskrit. In Kannada also many people and poets have asked why we are using Sanskrit language so much in our motherlanguage. In Hindi TV and films they are using high percentage of Urdu words, not Sanskrit or pure Hindi Tatsama and Tadbhava words.

  

This is very bad news for Sanskrit because influence of Sanskrit is decreasing on the languages of India. Many speakers are using many English words directly in local languages. If this trend continues in some centuries Sanskrit influence will be reduced very much and we will have lost our cultural heritage. Nobody will speak about Kalidasa and Bhasa. In schools they teach Shakespeare but not Kalidasa.
