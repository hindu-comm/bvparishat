Hari Om everybody,  
I came across two paatas of 2nd stanza as below. Request help on which is correct:

करुणावरुणालयपालय मां  
भवसागरदुःखविदूनहृदम्।  
रचिताखिलदर्शनतत्त्वविदम्  
भवशङ्करदेशिक मे शरणम्।।

The more common paatha has 1st word in third line as रचय. Reading as

रचयाखिलदर्शनतत्त्वविदम्

1\) रचय is लोट् मध्यमपुरुष. What exactly the verse means with this word?

2\) Is there any derivation for the word रचित? What is the verse meaning with this paatha?

Dhanyavaadaah,  
Kaushik.
