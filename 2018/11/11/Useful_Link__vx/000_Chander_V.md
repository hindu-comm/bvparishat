Dear Acharyas, Scholars,

Pranams to all of you.  

All of you may already know about this site but still I thought there may be a novice-amateur dabbling like me.

  

<https://www.panditproject.org/>

PANDiTis a digital humanities project with a unique and ambitious task: to create a database for the vast world of South Asian letters. The name stands for the Sanskrit title of a virtuoso scholar with full mastery of traditional knowledge systems, but as an acronym it also states the projectâ€™s main objective: the creation of aProsopographicalDatabase ofIndicTexts. Broadly stated,PANDiTseeks to store, curate, and share reliable data on works, people, places, institutions, and manuscripts frompremodernSouth Asia, in addition to relevant secondary sources, and to do so across period, language, discipline and subject matter. It is designed as an interactive web-based repository that scholars of every South Asian specialty and interest can contribute to and as a basic tool on which they will routinely come to rely.

Best regards to everybody,
