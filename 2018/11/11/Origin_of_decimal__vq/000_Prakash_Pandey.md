Pranam to all Learned Scholars,

  

At present we use a point (.) to represent decimal, I am to eager to know about its origin and spread. Is the word दशमलव of ancient origin or a translation coined to mean decimal? I am sure to receive guidance from the group.

  

(I have heard people saying दश-मलव instead of दशम-लव =tenth part).
