Dear scholars,

   I recollect having seen, about 20 years back, the second half of the workकविशिरोभूषणम् (अहोबलपण्डितीयम्) - a commentary on the आन्ध्रशब्दचिन्तामणि (a Telegu grammar on the model of Panini), published in 1966 or so. कविशिरोभूषणम् has been published in the devanagari script as well.

   I searched it on the net for a soft copy. But could notfind it.

   Anybody having access to it ?

  Thanks and regards

  Narayan Prasad
