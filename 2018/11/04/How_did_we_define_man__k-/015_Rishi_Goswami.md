I find the definition "shirahpANyAdyAkritimAn" the most accurate definition by far.

As, humans have 2 legs,two hands and this type of Aakriti can be used, but even monkeys are similar with 2 hands and legs, but they do not have a vertical erect back bone which is unique to humans and thus their highly developed brains.

By the Aadipadam, we can take rijupriSHTHatvam as a unique feature for Humans.

"Shirah-pANipAda-rijupriSHTHAdi-Akritimattvam manuSHyatvam"

Or, "karmajnAnAdhikAritvam manuSHyatvam" is also a very accurate definition, as animals don't have the freedom of choice as to choose between gopd and bad Karma, they don't have the knowledge, nor the capability, hence this adhikAra is unique to humans, the knowledge and the ability to choose between gopd and bad, just and unjust, right and wrong.

If one argues, that what if a Man is Manda like a Bull, and doesn't have the knowledge or capability, then still the lakSHaNa isn't duSHTa as we have used adhikAritvam, means that humans have the right, but not all humans are knowledgeable and capable, they are the only species who have been given this right or special power by God, hence this lakSHaNa is also accurate.

Thankyou once again for the help.
