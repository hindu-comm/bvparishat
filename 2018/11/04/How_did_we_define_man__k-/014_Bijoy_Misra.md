I agree, the etymological definition is different than an analytic definition.

Your quote definition was excellent. But a generic statement may be

there in the darshanas, particularly Sankhya. I recall reading in

Vachaspati Misra's commentary, but can't locate, don't have time.

Some darshana scholar might help.

  

As we proceed in our India discovery project, we try to summarize our

analysis in a pair of words. The following pairs have come, the latest at

the end.

  

Indus - "Industry and innovation"

Vedic - "Language and Organization"

Classical (700BC-200BC) - "Literature and Conduct"

Golden (200BC-500AD) - "Aesthetics and Analysis"

Hindu (500AD-1500AD) - "Creativity and Diversity"

  

Through our studies, we find that creativity is a built-in trait of the humans.

It manifests through self-expression and proliferates through security.

We have not examined what parameters are required to make a human being

feel secure. We think food and family, but have not reached a conclusion.

India provided food, but gradually the land was taken away etc.

With reduction in food, family got disrupted.

  

I may say more in six months.

  

Best regards.

Happy Diwali.
