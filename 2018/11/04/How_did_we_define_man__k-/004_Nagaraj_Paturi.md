Excellent and apt quotes from Prof. Bhat.

  

\> जन्तूनां नरजन्म दुर्लभम्  

  

shows that nara has been treated as part of jantus only. Vivekachudamani does not belong to a period after our exposure to " Man is a social (or whatever) *animal* " etc. So no scope for claiming influences.

  

आहार-निद्रा-भय-मैथुनश्च सामान्यम् एतद्पशुभिर्नराणाम्।  
धर्मो हि तेषाम् अधिको विशेषः  

  

makes the view even clearer. Human specificity is addressed in this verse.

  

Bhartrihari says human specificity is part of the specifities of each of the living species:

  

स्वरवृत्तिं विकुरुतॆ मधौ पुंस्कॊकिलस्य कः /

जन्त्वादयः कुलायादि- करणॆ शिक्षिताः कथम् //वाक्य\_२।१४९ //

आहारप्रीत्यपद्वॆष- प्लवनादिक्रियासु कः /

जात्यन्वयप्रसिद्धासु प्रयॊक्ता मृगपक्षिणाम् //वाक्य\_२।१५० //

  

for that matter, he treats the specifities of living species too as part of ripening /cooking of all materials:

  

यथा द्रव्यविशॆषाणां परिपाकैर् अयत्नजाः /

मदादिशक्तयॊ दृष्टाः प्रतिभास् तद्वतां तथा //वाक्य\_२।१४८ //

  

  

Do all those who think - looking at life processes or biological processes as part of broader material chemical processes is a new post-enlightenment awareness - notice this awareness in a 5th century AD author in India?

  

Humans usually are treated as part of भूतानि , though there is always an awareness of human specialities.
