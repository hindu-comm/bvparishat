Thank you for response respected schollars.

I don't know if it's accurate, bit I tried make a LakshaNa that may be free of 3 doSHas: avyApti, ativyApti and asambhava.

vAgvyavahArAdikushalatvam manuSHyatvam.

The one who has ability of speech/communication and other social forms and from Aadi we can take many things like reasoning,questioning, logic or debating or revenge (exclusive in humans), music, art and many types of vyavahAras.

One may say that even a parrot can speak, if taught to but he cannot do other vyavahAras like humans, and even he speaks, he doesn't know what he's speaking. So we should redefine vAk as "sajnAna-vaktritvam" because he knows what he is speaking unlike the parrot.

So the final Lakshana maybe:

SajnAnavakrtritve sati anekavyavahArakushalatvam manuSHyatvam.

Or maybe to put it simply: sambhASHanadi-anekavyavahArakushalatvam manuSHyatvam.

As I am searching for a definition which maybe applicable to all humans, regardless of Dharma/Morality. I know not all humans are Moral and have the virtue of Dharma, so they aren't fit to be called humans, but keeping that aside, if we were to define Man, how we would we define it in such a way, the definition is fit in the entire specie?
