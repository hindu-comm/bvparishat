I'm sorry Nagarajji, I made the question because I had thought like Goh SAnsnAdimattvam, there might be some Lakshana for manuSHya as well, therefore the question.

I lately realized the definition was Dharmaparaka, so Immoral/Non-righteous Humans may not have been considered to be worthy enough to be called Humans.

My abhiprAya of asking was what maybe the definition of human where 3 doSHas don't occur, the manuSHya Yoni.

He vidvan!

Mukatve'pi vyavAhareSHu sAmarthyam vartate eva, atah "vaktritva" iti lakSHaNam duSHTam. Atah mUkasyApi sambhASHaNe sAmarthyam, hastAdikriyayA vyavaharati mUko'pi atah tasya sambhASHaNam (communication iti tAtparyam) bhavati,atah "sambhASHaNady-anekavyavahAra-kushalatvam manuSHyatvam" iti lakSHaNam doSHariktam pratIyate.

Na jAne yadi kimapi doSHasAmmukyam syAt.

DhanyavAdAh.
