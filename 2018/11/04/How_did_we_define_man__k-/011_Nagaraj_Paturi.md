Dear Sri Rishi-ji,

  

Dharma being mentioned as the characteristic feature of humans as an implication, an individual without Dharma being called 'not human' but an 'animal' is a value-loaded view, where " 'not a human' but 'an animal' " is a curse-expression, and like all curse expressions, has metaphor, lakshaNA involved in it.

  

-----------------------------------------

  

But this issue of human being treated as an animal , an animal alone nothing more, or essentially more than an animal has far more implications than one might realise.

  

For example, in Psychology , all studies trying to understand human psychology as part of animal behaviour or through the study of animals were rooted in the definition of human as an animal, an animal alone.

  

Freud's Psychoanalysis too makes id , the aggregate of instincts, the drives shared by human with animals as the fundamental aspect of human psyche and super ego, the aspect close to Dharma-awareness as a post-natally acquired aspect.

  

Marx and the entire Cultural Studies /post-modern intellectuals treat dharma-like 'ethical' etc. aspects as social/class constructs. Marx considers economic drives like hunger as fundamental to human making human as an animal alone.
