The definition may exist in Sankhya literature, though I can't locate a line. search may be required.

The recognition of mind an "indriya" with its psychic functionalities would distinguish a man from an animal.

I have also read analysis in Shakara's litreature but can't point to a line from memory.

Kant analyzes pretty late in western traditions to declare "man thinks.".

Thinking as a function would entail recollection, imagination, organization and applying intelligence.

The discovery of "manana" as a brain function needs to be tracked in literature.
