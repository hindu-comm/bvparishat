Aristotle said that Man was a rational animal, as he was born with the sense of reasoning and speech.  
  
Plato was applauded for his definition as "Man is a featherless biped" but then Diogenes showed up with a shaved off bird and said, "Here is Plato's Man." By this, this Lakshana is Dushta through ativyapti.  
  
Here's the link where many philosophers have defined who is a Man: <https://www.the-philosophy.com/man-philosophy>  
  
How did we define Man?  
  
मनोर्जातावञ्यतौ षुक्च may define it as मनोर् अपत्यं (जातिः) इति मनुष्य:।  
  
But is there any other definition, Lakshana?
