One has to be on a farm to understand this.

  

A ripe cucumber falls off with even a gentle tap to the stalk.

An unripe on, will not come off without a fight and maybe with a knife.

  

So the prayer is that when at death I have to go, may I go like a ripe cucumber, without pains of separating from the bond of this world. Let the separation be painless.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
