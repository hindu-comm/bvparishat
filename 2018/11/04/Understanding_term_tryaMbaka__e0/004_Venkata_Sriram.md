सायण says as:

  

त्रयाणां ब्रह्मविष्णुरुद्राणाम् अम्बकं पितरम् - ie., the father of Brahma, Vishnu & Rudra.

  

This mantra bestows good health, longevity and removes the akAla-mrityu dosha.

  

Swami Sivananda Saraswathi Ji of Rishikesh used to advice his

disciples to chant this mantra 108 times during one's birthday. I have developed this habit of chanting 108 times on my birthday after doing rudrAbhisheka.

sriram
