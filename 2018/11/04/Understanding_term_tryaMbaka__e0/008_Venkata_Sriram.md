Dear Subbu ji,

  

Pls refer to the 59th सूक्तं of 7thमण्डलं fromऋग्वेदः .. The Rsi for this sUkta isमैत्रवरुणिः वसिष्ठः .

  

There are 12 Rks in this sUkta and the 12th (last) Rk is calledमृत्युविमोचनी ऋक् ie., a verse which frees the devotee from death.

  

Pls refer to the sAyaNa bhASya here (vide pg. no. 503)
