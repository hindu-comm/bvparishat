Respected scholars,

  

mahaadevashaastri joshi in bhaaratiiya samsk^iti kosha explains the term त्र्यंबक as follows:

  

त्र्यंबक is derived from (meaning) पिता, this which means त्र्यंबक was son of three fathers.

  

He further states पृथ्वी, आकाश and द्यू refers to them as being theपितृस्थान for अग्नि.  

  

For some reason folks forgot this meaning of त्र्यंबक and theलौकिक meaning of अंब got established as eyes.  

  

Any elaboration this would be appreciated.

  

Rgds,

  

Dr Yadu
