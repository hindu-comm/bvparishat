Hi All,

  

My grand uncle had a collection of Sanskrit Chandamama from 1970s and 1980s which I had referred during high school. Unfortunately they are almost lost now. Now I dont find those copies anywhere, I searched many second hand book shops in bangalore but could not find them.

  

If anybody has some ideas of how to procure them, please let me know.

  

Regards,

Harsha
