Looks like you are looking translation from Kannada to English/Telugu.

One can get some rough translation at \<<https://translate.google.com/#kn/en/%E0%B2%85%E0%B2%AE%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%AE%E0%B2%A8%E0%B2%BF%E0%B2%97%E0%B3%86%20%E0%B2%A8%E0%B2%BF%E0%B2%AE%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%AE%E0%B2%A6%E0%B3%87%20%E0%B2%95%E0%B2%A8%E0%B2%B8%E0%B3%81>\>

For example I tried the last line

ಅಮ್ಮನಿಗೆ ನಿಮ್ಮದೇ ಕನಸು

and got the translation as \<Mom's your dream>

The dialogue invites improvement of the translation.

I may suggest \<Mother dreams for (or about) you only.>

The passage, actually seems to be a poem, is quite long 14 long lines. Will require patient perseverance.
