Dear Vandanaji:

  

When a woman is rajasvala, apana vayu is exacerbated. This causes 2 issues:

  

1\. Asoucha /ritual impurity (Men have a similar issue in case of emission of bodily fluids--hence the seemingly excessive soucha vidhis in shastra regarding mala/mutra visarjan etc....bath 3 times a day etc)

  

2\. When a woman chants in this state, her already deranged prana gets deranged further which is not a desirable consequence.

  

Point 1. is a continuous issue over 3-4 days that cannot be washed away with a bath..hence the advice to take rest and avoid physical/mental chores.

  

The real important issue is certain devatas (not all) do not like the smell of menstrual fluid. Devis and Devatas "eat" through their sense of smell and their gaze....so on this account it would be improper----more importantly every Devi/Devata has a parivara that consists of certain types of spirits / yaksha ganas etc.

  

When chanting in a ritually impure state there is the danger of attracting one of these ganas (without the beneficial presence of the Deity)...This may end in possession etc if the karmas of the vessel and entity align.

  

Even in case of a Purascharana when even a gap of even 1 day is not allowed for men, women have a relaxed rule in this regard. They can take rest and continue the anushthana after the ritu snan without violating the rules of purascharana.

  

Hope this helps..

  

Regards,

  

Niranjan
