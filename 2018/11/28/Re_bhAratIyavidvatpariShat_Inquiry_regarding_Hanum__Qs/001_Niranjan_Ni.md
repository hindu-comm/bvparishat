Dear Divyaji:

  

There is no restriction gender based in worship of Hanuman. There is however a restriction based on bhava and rasa. Amorous love like that for Krishna will not work since Hanuman is a nitya Brahmachari.

  

Maatru bhava (treating Hanuman as your child) will work very well...or identifying with Sita if you can...nothing like it.

  

  

If you can get initiation from one who has perfected / practiced for a long time (NOTHING LIKE IT).

  

But if unable you can chant by yourself. Just make sure to get the pronunciation right.

Sanskrit if mispronounced can turn a boon into an astra directed at self.

So beware.

  

Many popular versions by Paudhwal etc may/will not be phonetically correct.

  

Get your pronunciation sorted first and then start on a Saturday/Tuesday. Make a sankalpa to chant a minimum number and stick to it ...offer some Naivedhya at the end ...do not change the naivedhya (for the sake of variety)....

  

Avoid worship on days of rajasvala...(DO NOT even chant the mantra mentally) ...

  

Personal advice: DO NOT ever constrain a deity with specific sankalpas/ prayogas (promotion, pass exams, kill this person or that, shatkarmas). A small mistake even will boomerang horribly.

  

The shatkarmas were mainly meant for esoteric use and occasional use to save a kingdom. Not for personal gain.

  

Always trust in the wisdom and munifiscence of the Deity to do what is good for you....That might include short term pain.

  

Most importantly learn to enjoy the journey..

  

All the best.

  

Niranjan
