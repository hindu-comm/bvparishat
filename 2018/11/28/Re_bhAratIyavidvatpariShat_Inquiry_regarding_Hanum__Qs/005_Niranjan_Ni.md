I forgot an important proviso:

  

Maintain strict Yama and Niyama--Brahmacharya is paramount, Satya is non-negotiable.

  

Maintain mauna if possible. This accelerates the process.

Most importantly during sadhana if things in your life turn ugly,

  

DO NOT give up your sadhana thinking you did something wrong....This is the sign that your Devata is approaching you. Control anger and speak sweetly.

  

After every round of anushthana, feed young boys (unmarried, prepubescent) with whatever you have every week after invoking Hanuman in them.
