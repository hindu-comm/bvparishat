Hello all,

  

Does any one have any contact details of 'HH Maharaja of Bikaner Manuscript Library'?

Its Catalogue was published in 1880. Prepared by R. Mitra. It is available on google archives.

  

But we could not find any current details of the collection.

  

It will be of great help for us if anyone gives information about the same.

  

Thanks and Regards,

Shrutbhavan Research Centre
