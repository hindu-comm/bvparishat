Pl.write to the Director, Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute, Rajendra Marg, Jodhpur, Rajasthan.

  

It is the head office of the seven branches of RORI and all the correspondence is to be addressed to them for getting info.or copies of MSS.from any of the seven branches of ROTI.

  

As far as I know,now there is no Sanskrit scholar who heads any of the seven branches and they are managed by personnel from Rajasthan Administrative Service.

  

You may try your luck.

  

Best luck in your search.  

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
