Niranjan ji,

  

This is a noble endeavour and such projects are need of the hour.

  

A few articles have already appeared in online portals on Mohit Bhardwaj's work.  

<http://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2018/7/19/extinct-tradition-Shankhayan-Shakha.html>

  

<http://indiafacts.org/after-millenia-tradition-reborn-vaidika-bharata/>

  

  

There are some grey areas on which I could not find any info from any of the articles or the official website of the Trust.

  

a\. His team is said have established **Vaidik Bharat Trust** for the digitization of manuscripts and allied goals. Since they have a trust formed for this purpose, why is the fund raising done in an individual's name? Donations can be directly made to the trust's bank account, so that the donor's can avail IT excemption.

  

b\. What happens to the digitized manuscripts? I hope the scans are made available in the public domain for the benefit of Vedic and Sanskrit scholars.

  

c. <http://vaidikabharata.org/#our-projects> mentions that the team is working in association with egangotri trust in certain centres. This fact is not mentioned in the appeal for fund raise at [milap.org](http://milap.org).  

  

regards  

shankara
