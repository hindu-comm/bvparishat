Dear All

  

Please find the response from Mohit on these questions. For further questions please email at [mo...@vaidikabharata.org]()

namaste bhratah!  
  

Very happy to know that the vidvan-s of bvp are satisfied by our work. I hope my replies below clear the air. I'm also CCing my friend shri chetan pandey ji, founder of egangotri trust.

  

*a. His team is said have established Vaidik Bharat Trust for the digitization of manuscripts and allied goals. Since they have a trust formed for this purpose, why is the fund raising done in an individual's name? Donations can be directly made to the trust's bank account, so that the donor's can avail IT excemption.*

------------------------

The structure of milaap is such that donations first reach a staging account created by milaap only. It is not my personal account in any sense of the word. This is especially important because vaidika bharata doesn't have FCRA, and almost half of the donations from milaap page are in USD (verifiable from the milaap page). Also, vaidika bharata doesn't have tax exemption yet, I tried but the bribe + CA fee was too much for that time, now with help of a dharmika CA, have initiated the proceedings again.

  

  

*b. What happens to the digitized manuscripts? I hope the scans are made available in the public domain for the benefit of Vedic and Sanskrit scholars.*

--------------------

Scans from sites other than banswada and melukote are uploaded on[archive.org](http://archive.org/), via egangotri's and other accounts. For ex.<https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22eGangotri%22>

  

Chetan ji, founder or egangotri, marked in this email, can share all the links.

  

For banswada and melukote, we do not have the permission of the inheritors of the MSS to share them publicly. In melukote, we're also legally bound to not share without the permission of the Academy. However, for both banswada and melukote, data can be shared on individual requests.

While I agree that it should be public, but since I/vaidika bharata aren't the owners, we have to abide by the conditions set by the owners. We're hopeful that our next endeavours won't have this hurdle.

For now, we keep one copy and one copy is kept with the institue/individual.

  

  

*c.<http://vaidikabharata.org/#our-projects>mentions that the team is working in association with egangotri trust in certain centres. This fact is not mentioned in the appeal for fund raise at[milap.org](http://milap.org/).*

-------------------------

I should not have missed it, but as the writer notes, our website and twitter handle has posted the same regularly (an example:<https://twitter.com/vAIdikabhArata/status/1021358338775363586>).

The whole campaign has been in knowledge of chetan ji since inception.

vaidika bharata has been financially assisting egangotri since february 2018 as is evident also from the individual MSS images uploaded by egangotri.
