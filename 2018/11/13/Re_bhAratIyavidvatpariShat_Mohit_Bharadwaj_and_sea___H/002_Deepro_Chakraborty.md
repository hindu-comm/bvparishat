Namaskāraḥ Niranjan ji,

  

They are doing a very commendable job. But I am worriediftheyhave againdigitized the same manuscripts whichMr. Chetan Bhagat's E-gangotri teamdigitized. Mohit Bharadwaj's team is documentingthemanuscripts of libraries such as RaghunathTemple Library,Jammu; Sri Krishna Museum, Kurukshetra andBhuri SinghMuseum, Chamba. TheE-gangotridigitized many manuscripts fromtheselibraries. It wouldhave beengreat ifthese two organizationscouldcollaborate.

  

A big problem oftheE-gangotriproject is itsterriblybadcataloguingthatmakes thisgreatservice almostuselessto thephilologists. I hopethis teamwould payattention tothissalientissue.

  

Moreover, it would be useful to know how people can accessthese documents.

  

Regards,

Deepro
