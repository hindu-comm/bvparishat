Thank you Misra ji for sharing the link. The lyrics cannot be identified from the rendering. Maybe the acoustics was the problem. If the lyrics were displayed in Devanagari or English alongside the rendering, the effect would have been better.

  

A couple of years ago a week long rendering of Shankaracharya's compositions by noted artists in musical discourse style was presented in Bangalore, Gayana Samaja. While each number was rendered, simultaneously on a screen on either side, the lyrics were displayed in Kannada and Devanagari script for the audience to relate to. This made the overall hearing experience a very pleasant one.
