Dear Mr. Subrahmanina,

  

We were experimenting on dhvani, we avoided giving the lyric. Our goal is to try out

the song in bigger audiences, more heterogeneous.

The modern opera singing is done in this principle. Of course it takes an audience

who understands Italian and know the words. Our audience handled it well. It

had mixed literary experience. The check is to find if we connect the pitch to emotion

to create the effect.

  

Please send me any recording that you have. That will be a big help.



Thank you.

BM
