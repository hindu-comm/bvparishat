Dear Sri Subrahmanian,

I had noticed one in these. My personal interest has been in the tonality of a syllable,

which is the information transfer through its acoustics. You may like to review

our paper on Paninian alphabet to appreciate the cognitive part of acoustics. We look

at the acoustic syllable is an information unit irrespective of the language. I can send

you the paper if you would like tocheck it out.

Best regards,

BM
