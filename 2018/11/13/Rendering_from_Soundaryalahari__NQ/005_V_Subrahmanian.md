Dear Sri Misra ji,

  

It is nice to hear from you about the work you are doing in the area of cognitive acoustics. As I am not exposed to the Paninian grammar I would not be competent to review the paper you are referring to. Someone in this forum who is qualified in this area and also interested might review the paper.

  

warm regards
