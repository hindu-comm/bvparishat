Dear Sri Subrahmanian,

Understanding through meaning or through reading is very western in its concept.

Speech and sound are not textual. The texture is our endowment. Most of India's

science has been dedicated to discover this texture. If truth ever manifests, it

does in sound! If you are into computers, you can dig into the information theory

and the fabric of data transmission.

Best regards,

BM
