Namaste

  

In the book 'The Puranas' by L.Rocher, 1986, on p.158 (pdf 83) under Brahmandapurana we have:

The foot note 130 is:

We get the impression from the above that the stated Purana in the Lalitopachyana there does exist the Lalitasahasra nama. At the end of the LS, in the printed versions, we seeइतिश्रीब्रह्माण्डपुराणे,उत्तरखण्डे, श्री हयग्रीवागस्त्य संवादे, श्री ललिता रहस्यनाम साहस्रस्तोत्र कथनं...

  

I have seen some persons saying that none of the editions of the Brahmandapurana has the LS. Can anyone please confirm whether the Brahmanda purana has the LS. Sri C.L.Prabhakar's name appears in the above footnote. I think he is a member of BVP.

  

Thanks and warm regards
