Namaste

  

Even I could not find LS in Lalitha Upakyanam.

  

I referred a good book on Lalitha Upakyanam translated into Kannada by a kannadika named " Motaganahalli Sri Subramanya Sastry" noted person published by Sri Vidya Ganapathi Prakshana,Tyagarajanagar, Bengaluru.

  

LU deals with samhara of bandasura and his team,varahi & matangi different naamas and shodashi mantra Rahasya & manidweepa varnanam, but not LS.
