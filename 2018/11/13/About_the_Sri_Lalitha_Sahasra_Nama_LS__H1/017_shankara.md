Paturiji,

  

It seems the chapter and verse numbers given in Joshi's book were wrong. When I searched for 'sahasranamadhyaye' in the GRETIL text I found the verse in 20th chapter whereas according to Joshi's book it is in 4th chapter. sahasranāmādhyāye occurs only once in the LP text at GRETIL. So, most probably the chapter & verse numbers given in Joshi's book are wrong.  

  

regards  
shankara
