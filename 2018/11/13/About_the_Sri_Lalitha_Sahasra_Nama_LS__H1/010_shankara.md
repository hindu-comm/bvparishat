Namaste,

  

Lalita Sahasranama is not found in the Lalitopakhyana published by Nirnayasagar Press and a Malayalam edition published by Shreepuram Tantric Research Centre in Kerala. Moreover, Lalitopakhyana is divided into 40 chapters in all available editions of Brahmanda Purana. I coudl not find the 7 khandas mentioned by SV Radhakrishna Sastri in any of the Lalitopakhyana texts published separately or as part of Brahmanda Purana.  

  

In addition to this, I checked Brahmanda Purana Khemraj edition as well as MLBD. LSN is not found in them. There might be some rare edition of Brahmanda Purana that contains LSN.  

  

regards  
shankara
