Sri Shankara-ji,

  

You seem to have copied the verse from the GRETIL site.

  

Did Sri L M Joshi-ji mention the number of the verse and you copied it from GRETIL site based on that?

  

Did Sri L M Joshi-ji quote the verse with number and the GRETIL version matched with the version of the verse and number quoted by Sri L M Joshi-ji ?
