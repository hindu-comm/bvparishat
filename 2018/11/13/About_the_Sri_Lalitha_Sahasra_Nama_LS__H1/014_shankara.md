Paturiji,

  

I have great regard for late S.V. Radhakrishna Sastri, the author of Tamil commentary of LSN of which some pages were shared by Gopalji. I am sure that Sastryji would have seen the rare edition of Br. Purana that contained LSN and also Lalitopakhyana divided into 7 khandas. Still, it is a pity that he did not mention the details of that rare edition of Br Purana.  

  

regards  
shankara
