Namaste,

  

There is an internal evidence in Lalitopakhyana (LP) chapter 20 verse 68 which shows that LSN is part of LP.

  

tāsāṃ nāmāni sarvāsāṃ daṇḍinyāḥ kuṃbhasaṃbhava /  

sahasranāmādhyāye tu vakṣyante nādhunā punaḥ // BndP_3,20.68 //  

  

This is mentioned in 'Lalita Sahasranama, A Comprehensive Study' by L.M. Joshi page 17 in the chapter - 'The date, home and authorship of Lalita Sahasranama'.

shankara
