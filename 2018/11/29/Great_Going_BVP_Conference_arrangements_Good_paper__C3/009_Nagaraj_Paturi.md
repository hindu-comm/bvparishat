Dear members,

  

We at BVP work under the visionary guidance and leadership of Prof. Srinivasa Varakhedi.

  

He encourages diversity of views and approaches as long as they have a respect for the subject matter of our field of study i.e., Sanskrit language and literature, Shaastras, India, Indians, Indian culrure etc.

  

Even if the views are otherwise, a polite presentation of the views with a preparation to accept and participate in a debate/discussion within the norms of propriety and etiquette of an academic forum, such views are welcome.

  

Thanks and regards,

  

Nagaraj
