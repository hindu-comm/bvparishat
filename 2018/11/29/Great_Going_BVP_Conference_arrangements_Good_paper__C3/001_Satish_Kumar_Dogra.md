Paturi Ji,  

I would like to present a paper, but I am not sure whether it fits the themes of the conference. So, let me share with you, so that you could take it up with the organisers and let me know.  

  

The title of my paper will be Sanskrit and Sanskriti and it will focus on the tides against Sanskrit and the steps needed to tackle these tides.  

  

The first part of the paper will focus on how Sanskrit is not just a language, but also the carrier of a culture with a well-defined core. This part of the paper will give details of how the cultural core is getting eroded and why and in what way it is necessary to integrate Sanskrit with people' lives to protect and strengthen this core. The discussion will involve some sensitive issues, such as the issue of religious conversion, Dravidian politics sustained by the creation of fear that Tamil and other South Indian languages are in danger of being washed off by the advance of Sanskrit, and the risk that focus on Sanskrit and Sanskrit-based sanskriti tends to produce an unwanted fallout of Hindu chauvinism among some organisations and extreme superstition among some others. So, the paper will strive to suggest the fine line that needs to be drawn to achieve the goal of integrating Sanskrit with people's daily life without producing the negative fallout highlighted above.  

  

The second part of the paper will focus on the risks of simplifying Sanskrit to make it a language of day-to-day communication. This effort at simplification, while it increases the number of persons reading and writing the language, can gradually take away the unique feature of Sanskrit which makes it different from other languages by giving it a compactness missing in other languages. The paper will explore the entire issue of whether there is need to have Sanskrit as a language that sprawls a wide spectrum, being almost a Sanskritized Hindi at one extreme, where it is available to the common user, and a dense and Sandhi-based language at the other extreme where it acts as the most powerful medium of poetic expression.  

  

The third part will straddle across the first two parts and suggest a sort of social action where selected mantras can be used to popularise Sanskrit.

  

Kindly let me know your thoughts.  

  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai.
