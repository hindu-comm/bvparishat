Prof. Pandurangi is working hard to put the panels together. Getting in touch with panellists.

  

Learned scholars may volunteer to join as panellists or members may suggest names of various learned scholars for different panels through offline/individual message to Prof.

  

Pandurangi.  

  

There was a question on deadline for abstracts. Please keep sending the abstracts. Follow it up with full papers. Organisers need time to sort, slot and schedule the papers into

  

sessions. So the process can not be endless. Be as quick as possible.

  

Looking at the papers coming in and panellists joining and the arrangements going on, you may expect great discussions, a great conference and a great decennial celebration.

  

Cheer up and gear up to join!
