Paturi Ji,  

I somehow did not save the original post calling for papers. Now, I have a question and a request:

  

My question is: can the note sent by me be taken as the abstract, and can I send the paper directly? Or do I need to send a formal abstract? In case I have to send one, will about 500 words be enough, as is the usual practice?  

Secondly, what is the deadline and word-length for the paper?

  

If you could forward me the details of the conference again, I shall be grateful.  

  

Regards,  

Dogra.
