Dear scholars,

  

I also have one query about a Jyotisha work titled,लंपाकशास्त्रं.

  

We have manuscripts in the Oriental Institute, Baroda,of this title/text mentioned under the heading of Jyotisha.

  

Will anybody enlighten me on this strange title/ work and its nature?

  

Thanks in advance.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
