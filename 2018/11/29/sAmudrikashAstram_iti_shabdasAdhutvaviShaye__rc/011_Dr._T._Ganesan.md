The word लम्पाक occurs also in the 12th century Alamkara text प्रतापरुद्रयशोभूषणम् also popularly known as प्रतापरुद्रीयम् composed by Vidyanatha. There while describing the valour of Prataparudra the poet uses the expression: लम्पाक किं कम्पसे in a verse of which I do not remember the beginning lines.
