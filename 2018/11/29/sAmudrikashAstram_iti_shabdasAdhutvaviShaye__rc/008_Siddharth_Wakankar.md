Dear Prof.Korada.ji and Venkatesh.ji.

  

Many thanks for your important inputs.

  

Hope,you will be able to shed some light on this shastra.

  

I do know that it is not a Sanskrit word and must be a borrowed one.

  

I would be very thankful if I get any authentic information about this.

  

Thanks and regards.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
