Dear Prof.Iyengar,

  

Many thanks for your answer,giving a very important clue.

  

Years ago,I did try to read and understand that text,but,....

  

No scholar including Jyotisha scholars visiting our Institute could tell anything about that text, hence,I put this query here and I did get the answer.

  

Many thanks to one and all.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
