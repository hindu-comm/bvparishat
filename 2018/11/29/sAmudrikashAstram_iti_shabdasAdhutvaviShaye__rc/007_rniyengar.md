Lampaaka is the name of a country in NW India. I remember Markandeya purana or Shabdakalpadruma mentioning this name along with a few other countries. The place is famous as having an Ashokan Edict in Aramic script, carrying the word Devanampiya. The manuscript under discussion is perhaps a divination text based on portents or phala-jyotisha book similar to Taajika originating out of Taajiksthan. This is of course just a guess, without seeing the manuscript.
