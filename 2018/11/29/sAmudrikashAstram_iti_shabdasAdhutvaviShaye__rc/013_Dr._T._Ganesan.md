This line is part of a verse which lists out kings of various countries who were vanquished in battle by Prataparudra. The poet counts each one of them and the king of लम्पाक is one vanquished king.

It shows that probably even in 12-13th centuries the लम्पाक country was known.

As this thread is about लम्पाक I cited this reference from प्रतापरुद्रयशोभूषणम्.
