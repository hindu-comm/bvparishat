नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Prof Siddharth

  

I checked with , पाणिनीयधातुपाठ , उणादि etc and also all the six निघण्टुs of ज्योतिषम् , major works such as

मुहूर्तरत्नाकरः, बृहज्जातकम् , कालामृतम् etc but did not find the term - लम्पाक ।

  

I am certain it is not a Sanskrit word but a word/term borrowed from Greek / Persian as we come across

such terms - अनफा , सुनफा , दुरधुरा (योगाः) in this शास्त्रम् - a unique feature when compared with other

वेदाङ्गs and दर्शनs .

  

There may be some reference to this word in the work itself ( or similar other works on ज्योतिषम् , that are

available with your Library.

However , I shall let you know , if , during the course of time, I come across this term.
