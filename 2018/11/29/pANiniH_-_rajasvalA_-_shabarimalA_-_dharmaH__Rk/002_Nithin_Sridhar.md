Namaste Korada ji,

  

Thank you for sharing the relevant verses about menstruation and how to understand them. This is a topic of huge interested to me. A few years back, I had written an article series titled Hindu view of Menstruation-<http://indiafacts.org/hindu-view-menstruation-ii-menstruation-ashaucha/>

  

My upcoming book titled "Menstruation Across Cultures" which would be in market by December end would focus on this issue in Sanatana Dharma as well as other cultures and religions across the world.

  

Regards,

Nithin
