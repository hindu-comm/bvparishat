नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

धर्म is a thing that cannot be decided by everybody . ऋषिs are called प्रत्यक्षधर्माणः ( महाभाष्यम्-पस्पशा / निरुक्तम् )

as they only , due to their तपश्शक्ति , are able to discern the real form of धर्म ।

  

In this context , it is so happening that some 'people' who do not admit this land to be a कर्मभूमि and do not know the

meaning of सनातनधर्म / सदाचार , have started creating chaos simply for no reason . Such people have already entered

different institutions and started imposing their whims which led to violent backlash from the people , both ladies and

gents, who , for no reason , follow the वैदिकधर्म - this is one of the आर्यधर्मs described by Patanjali , in महाभाष्यम् (6-3-109).

  

Here we take the extended आर्यावर्त that spans from Kashmir to Kanyakumari .

  

Let us take a look at the often discussed धर्म / अधर्म that is associated with रजस्वला --

  

रञ्ज रागे - भ्वादिः -- मत्वर्थे वलच् ’ रजःकृष्यासुतिपरिषदो वलच् ’ पा 5-2-112 - रजस्वला ( ’ तसौ मत्वर्थे ’ पा 1-4-19 इति भसंज्ञया पदसंज्ञायाः

बाधनात् न रुत्वम् )।

  

No doubt , it is a मासिकधर्म , but कृष्णयजुर्वेद itself says that ladies during this period ( four days) have to take rest and

should not do anything that would affect the पवित्रता ।

  

Panini earmarked a सूत्रम् to analyze this paragraph ( and other such examples too) that speaks about रजस्वला --

  

चतुर्थ्यर्थे बहुलं छन्दसि (2-3-62) -- ' षष्ठ्यर्थे चतुर्थी ’ , ’ योगविभागात् सिद्धम् ’ - are the वार्तिकम्s .

  

Here is the text ( I have put the punctuation marks, which otherwise is संहिता ) --

  

या खर्वेण पिबति तस्यै खर्वो जायते । यां मलवद्वाससं संभवन्ति यस्ततो जायते सो’भिशस्तः । यामरण्ये तस्यै स्तेनः। यां पराचीं तस्यै ह्रीतमुख्यपगल्भः।

या स्नाति तस्या अप्सु मारुकः । याभ्यङ्क्ते तस्यै दुश्चर्मा । या प्रलिखते तस्यै खलतिरपमारी । याङ्क्ते तस्यै काणः । या दतो धावते तस्यै श्यावदन् ।

या नखानि निकृन्तते तस्यै कुनखी । या कृणत्ति तस्यै क्लीबः । या रज्जुं सृजति तस्या उद्बन्धुकः । या पर्णेन पिबति तस्या उन्मादुकः जायते । अहल्यायै

जार मनाय्यै तन्तुः ।

All the above sentences are called आर्थवादs - this is discussed in पूर्वमीमांसा -- in order to encourage a person to do something

(विधिः) there will be स्तुत्यर्थवाद (sentences of commendation) and in order to restrict someone from indulging something that is unwanted ( निषेधः) there will be निन्दार्थवाद ( sentences of condemnation) - and **one should not take the literary meaning of these sentences.**

This is clearly stated by Hari in वाक्यपदीयम् (2-321) --

  

व्यघ्रादिव्यपदेशेन यथा बालो निवर्त्यते ।

असत्यो’पि तथा कश्चित् प्रत्यवायो विधीयते ॥

  

Just like a child is arrested by saying - ' there is a tiger ' etc , although not true , it is said - ' something untoward will happen

if you do so' .

  

Most of the interpretations are going wrong as the scholars did not study पूर्वमीमांसा which is essential to decide the meaning

of a sentence / discourse and also they do not have considerable command on व्याकरणम् ।

  

The वेदमन्त्रs mean ---

  

The रजस्वला , who drinks with a baked vessel , will give birth to a child who will be short . If a man sleeps with a रजस्वला

then there will be a child who carries a false allegation . If such a union takes place in a forest then a thief will be born.

If she feels shy or is inadvertent during the union then there will be a child who feels too much of shy or is gullible .

If she takes bath then there will be a child who would commit suicide by drowning .If she takes oily bath then there will be

a leper . If she does some painting then there will be a child with bald head or who may die suddenly . If she applies some-

thing in the eyes then there will be a child blind in one eye. If she brushes her teeth then there will be a child with black

teeth . If she cuts her nails then there will be a child with bad nails . If she cuts sticks then there will be an impotent child.

If she makes a rope then there will be a child who will commit suicide by hanging with a rope.. If she drinks with a leaf then

there will be a mad child .

  

So the overall suggestion is that a lady should be careful during those four days --

  

पञ्चमे’हनि शुद्धिः स्यात् दैवे पित्रे च कर्मणि (स्मृतिः)

  

पञ्चमे’हनि शुद्धा स्यात् हव्यकव्यादिकर्मसु ।

चतुर्थे’हनि भर्तुस्स्यात् शुद्धा संभोगकर्मणि ॥ -- मुहूर्तदर्पणम्

  

In ceremonies related to forefathers and deity she can participate from fifth day onwards . However she can approach

her husband from fourth day itself .

  

There is a problem being faced by many ladies -- the periods are not
regular , i e always do not complete the thirty day

cycle . It is due to anxiety / fever / tension and other reasons .

If a lady , has an irregular period due to health problems , then **it need not be considered as a period at all** --

  

रोगेण यद्रजः स्त्रीणाम् अत्यर्थं हि प्रवर्तते ।

अशुद्धास्तु न तेनेह तासां वैकारिकं हि तत् ॥ -- आपस्तम्बस्मृतिः , अध्या 7 श्लो 2

  

धन्यो’स्मि
