Namaste

  

1\.    Professor Korada has clarified many obscure and confused/ misrepresented facts on this sensitive topic.

  

2\.    The key to get this clarity is in integrated understanding of ' Traditional Wisdom-Visioned ( Veda-Mantra) ' with 'Health-Wellness Applications ( Ayur-veda/ Ayur-yoga) and explaining the technical terminology using Vedanga- Vyakarana.

  

3\.    The rule base from Panini invoked here shows how Samskrutha Vyakarana needs to be studied- Taught in the understanding/ Translation of Vedas and Upa-Vedas. This traditional Unified pedagogy of
(Vak-)Yoga approach to  teach-practice Upa-(Yoga) -Veda and Mantra - Yoga is completely destroyed by constructing 'Samskrutham as Historical Religion and Social language: Sanskrit with multiple layers of evolution stretching over at least a millennia.

  

     Sanskrit has become a language about which some researchers assert : -' Panini, the compiler of Ashtaadhyaayi, was distanced out and confused on the nature, usage and purpose of Language: Samskrutham. Therefore, he takes recourse to the rule ' bahulam chandasi' ( Any thing can go as deviation under the tag of 'Chandas'.

  

  

For contemplation please.
