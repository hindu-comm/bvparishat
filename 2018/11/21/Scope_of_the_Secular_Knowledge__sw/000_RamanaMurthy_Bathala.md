Dear Sir,

  

What happens to the secular knowledge, that we get during our life, time after leaving this world?

Will this be carried over to the heaven/hell we go?

  

Is the knowledge we gathered here in this world, will be useful to the other side of the grave?

There was a great poet śrīnāthuḍu.

  

It is said that he composed the below poem just a few minutes before leaving this world:

  

భాస్కరుడు మున్నె దేవుని పాలి కరిగె

గలియుగంబున నికనుండ కష్టమనుచు

**దివిజకవివరు గుండియల్‌ దిగ్గురనగ**

**నరుగుచున్నాడు శ్రీనాథు డమరపురికి**

**  
**

if the last two lines are translated liberally, it goes like this: The poets in the heaven are scared/worried because they are going to get a new competition from poet śrīnāthuḍu.

  

If we take the face value of the poet’s last words, it is clear that the secular knowledge (poetry, singing, computer programming skills, etc.) would be carried over to the heaven or hell.

  

My two questions:

  

Q1: Are the skill and knowledge gained by a man during his life time are bound to his mortal body or immortal soul/mind?

  

Q2: If the skill and secular knowledge are bound to the soul, then this knowledge can be carried over to heaven as claimed by the poet śrīnāthuḍu. Also the same can be carried over to next life also Since the soul is carrier of the acquired secular knowledge, I should have medical knowledge assuming I was a doctor in the previous life.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
