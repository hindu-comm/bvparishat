Namaste

  

I would love to share my take on your question, only after I learn from you the following:  

  

a. Is there any knowledge that is useless ?

  

b. Whether giitaa was narrated to arjunaa as a philosophical narrative to impress him or was it possibly for his use at that time for his benefit ?

  

IMHO: All knowledge is for the living. As I have stated & emphasized in my GaNesha Book, ***"No matter how so ever great the philosophy may be, I have no value for it and after I am dead."***
