Dear sir,

  

Thanks for the reply.

a. Is there any knowledge that is useless ?

Ans: I believe any knowledge can be put to use at some point of time or space. In Telugu, there is something like this: కాదేది కవతకనర్హం... Nothing is unfit as poetic material.

b. Whether giitaa was narrated to arjunaa as a philosophical narrative to impress him or was it possibly for his use at that time for his benefit?

Ans: Pardon me. I do not have competency to answer this query.



My limited point is the scope of the secular knowledge we gather in this world. Let me explain.

1) Spiritual Knowledge: The goal of the spiritual knowledge is Moksha or Nirvana (I am not using the word Salvationas advised by the respected Scholars).

तत्र तं बुद्धिसंयोगं लभते पौर्वदेहिकम् ।

यतते च ततो भूयः संसिद्धौ कुरुनन्दन ॥६-४३॥

Suppose that We start from Alphabet A ... and Alphabet Z is the final goal i.e., Moksha or Nirvana. Suppose that I have not reached the final alphbet z (Moksha or Nirvana). After reaching upto the alphabet M, I leave this world. What happens to my spiritual knowledge in the next life. Should I again start from the scratch i.e. from Alphabet A or is it possible to continue from alpohabet M?

To the above question, the answer from Krishna is: "You need not worry about this. You will start from where you left in the previouslife. That means the journey can be continued from letter M, not from A."

The spiritual knowledge is "incremental." That is my understandingof the above sloka.



2) Secular Knowledge: Next let us come to the secularKnowledge. Secular knowledgeI mean the knowledge relative to this world. It may be language proficiency, poetry, Singing, computer skills, sports etc...



Suppose that My goal is to reach Ph.D. I started from LKG and reached upto 8th Standard. Then I leave this world. What happens to my knowledge acquired upto 8th standard. Can I carryover this to next life. Should I start my next life from LKG or can I continue from 8th Standard?



In the previous post, as mentioned the The great poet claimed he is taking his poeticexpertise to the Heaven to challenge the poets there (దివిజకవివరు గుండియల్‌ దిగ్గురనగ నరుగుచున్నాడు శ్రీనాథు డమరపురికి).



If we take whateverhe said in his poem is correct. The secular knowledge obtained in this world can be taken to the Heaven. Then what stops us from carry over to the earth again in the next life?



Regards

Ramana murthy
