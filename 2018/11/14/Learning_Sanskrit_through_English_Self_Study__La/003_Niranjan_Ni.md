Dear Sir,

  

Thank you for your pointers, but isn't the ashtadhyayi a little too advanced for a beginner? I have frequently seen many learned ones opine that the Ashtadhyayi is best used as a reference tool rather than a text book.

  

I have seen many scholars such as Sri Nityananda Misraji and others break Panini's seminal work out as a means to explaining a word's meaning wrt grammatical context.

  

I might not have put my original question in proper light:

 **In what order should books be studied so that a holistic and nonconfused perspective and knowledge can be gained by a beginner attempting to gain expertise in the Sanskrit language?**

**  
**

I am hoping to gain enough expertise to read with proper undertstainding of context, the epics R, MB and the works of Abhinavagupta. Atleast that is my endgoal.

  

Thanks...
