\<\<I am trying to learn Sanskrit through Self study from basics. Can the scholars here suggest good reliable books with English as the medium of teaching?I am familiar with the devanagari script.>\>

  

Rama Nath Sharma - The ASTAdhyAyI of PANini - in 6 Vols.

Publisher: Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Lts, New Delhi.

  

If you can mangage to read Hindi, you can better start withपं॰ ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासु, "अष्टाध्यायी (प्रथमावृत्ति)", 3 Vols.; Publisher: रामलाल कपूर ट्रस्ट

I tried with the 2nd, although I have easy access to the 1st. The first one is too lengthy and may be boring for a beginner, esp. because the Skt texts (except the sutras) are also written in Roman.

  

If you can't manage in the beginning with any one of the two, try with a beginner:
