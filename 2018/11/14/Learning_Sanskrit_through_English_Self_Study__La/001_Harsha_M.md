I am not an expert in Sanskrit. But I can understand enough Sanskrit to understand Gita,Upanishads,Subhashitas, Mahabharatha and Ramayana.

  

Whenever I find difficult words, first I see if it can be split as per Sandhi/Samasa rules, if it is not possible or even after splitting if I find it difficult I refer to online sanskrit dictionary
:<http://spokensanskrit.org/>

  

As an online learning site, I felt this very useful:<https://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/>

  

As a grammar book, I find M R Kale's High School Sanskrit Grammar (explanations in english) very helpful.

  

Hope this helps as well.

  

Regards,  

Harsha
