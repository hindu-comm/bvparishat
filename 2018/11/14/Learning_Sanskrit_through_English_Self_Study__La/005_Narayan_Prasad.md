I think, example is better than precept.

Let me give an example of a foreigner (a Russian) who expressed his desire to be able to read the commentary of a highly advanced Skt text in the सूत्र form (not the अष्टाध्यायी) in the original Sanskrit (and not in Russian/German/English translation).

  

I told him that for this purpose he would have to study Panini in depth and should first accustom himself to be able to read directly in devanagari (and not in Roman). He became ready for that. He took about 6 months to develop his own software to type in devanagari. He did not have any background of any Indian language. After that I suggested him to start directly from अष्टाध्यायी and he did the way I instructed him.(BTW, initially he had learnt from some people to start from लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी. I had to dissuade him from doing this and by cross-questioning him I could convince him that without taking resort to the अष्टाध्यायी, one cannot learn anything of Panini in his whole life. ) And see for yourself, what sort of derivational history he gives (after studying अष्टाध्यायी for just one year) for a sample excercise given by me !

I was also an adult beginner of Panini. Here, I have given my own experience of learning Panini through books. For me there was no time to attend classes.
