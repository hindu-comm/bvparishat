\<\<I am hoping to gain enough expertise to read with proper undertstainding of context, the epics R, MB and the works of Abhinavagupta.>\>

  

As an adult learner of Panini, my aim was also sth like you. I started learning Panini by reading the whole of the Astadhyayi with the Hindi commentary of Pt Brahmadatta Jijnasu (3 Vols). In about one year I completed that. Later I devoted much more time to theतिङन्त प्रकरण which is considered to be the backbone of Skt grammar. Side by side I read the Mahabharata (with Hindi translation, published by Gita Press) and also some other Skt texts. I tried to derive the verb-forms taking the help of the Astadhyayi, theव्याकरण चन्द्रोदय of पं॰ चारुदेव शास्त्री, andमाधवीया धातुवृत्ति. I consulted other works only when I faced some problem.

  

Consider, for example, the verb-forms ब्रवीहि which occurs frequently in MB along with ब्रूहि,कुर्मि (in place of करोमि), ध्यामि (in place of ध्यायामि) etc. You will not find the derivation of such verb-forms in any Kaumudi works. If you study the Astadhyayi, these are a very simple matter.

  

Best wishes
