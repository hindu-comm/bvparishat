The English book,Sanskrit Svayam Shikshak,by Pt.Satawalekar,is quite easy to understand and not at all pedantic or highly technical.Very simple sentences and generally every Indian has some background in his mother.tongue,which helps him to know and comprehend easy Sanskrit.

  

Best luck in your efforts.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
