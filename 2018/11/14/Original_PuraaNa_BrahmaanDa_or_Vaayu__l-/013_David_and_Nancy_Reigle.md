Dear all,

  

In support the view that the Brahmāṇḍa and Vāyu purāṇas were originally a single purāṇa, a comparison of their contents was made by Willibald Kirfel and published as charts in the introduction to his 1927 book, Das Purāṇa Pañcalakṣaṇa, pp. xii-xiii and pp. xv-xvi. Even though the book is in German, the charts can be used without knowing German. The first several pages of his introduction were on these two purāṇas, which he regarded as originally being one purāṇa. S. P. L. Narasimhaswami had started his comparative studies of the purāṇas in 1910, which eventually led to his reconstructing the lost original Purāṇa-saṃhitā. This was largely reconstructed from the extant Brahmāṇḍa and Vāyu purāṇas, which he also regarded as originally being one. When he came to know of Kirfel’s book, he wanted to know what Kirfel said in the introduction to that book. So Narasimhaswami asked his brother, P. V. Ramanujasvami, to translate Kirfel’s introduction from German into English. This was published in two installments in Journal of Sri Venkatesvara Oriental Institute, 1946 and 1947. I attach my scans of these here.



As I mentioned in a previous post, Narasimhaswami died without his reconstruction of the Purāṇa-saṃhitā being published, and I wondered if anyone might have contact with his family where his manuscript might still be preserved. The article by his brother gives at the end his full name as S. P. L. Narasimhaswami Ayyavaralugaru, and where he lived as Vizagapatam. Possibly this information may be of some help in locating his descendants today.
