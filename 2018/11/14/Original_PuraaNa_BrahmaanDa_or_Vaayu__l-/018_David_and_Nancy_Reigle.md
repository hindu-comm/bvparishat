Dear Prof. Iyengar,



Your discovery of how the Vedic number 3339 leads to the 18-year eclipse cycle, with the help of material found in the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa (“Eclipse Period Number 3339 in the Ṛgveda,” <https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol2_2005_01.pdf>), shows the importance of the purāṇas for understanding the Vedic texts. As you say about the purāṇas, “preceding Sāyaṇa by more than 1500 years” (p. 142): “These texts are the prime claimants for having preserved ancient traditions outside the canonical Vedic literature.” The fact that the key verse giving the number 3339 is found only in the published edition of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa shows the need for critical editions of the purāṇas. This verse should be in the Vāyu-purāṇa, but as you noted, it is not; that is, it is not in the published Bibliotheca Indica and Veṅkaṭeśvara Press editions and the editions that are based on these two. This verse is found in the Ānandāśrama edition of the Vāyu-purāṇa (chapter 52, verse 63, p. 168), although not correctly.



Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa 1.23.68, Veṅkaṭeśvara Press edition:

trayaś ca triṃśataś caiva trayastriṃśat tathaiva ca \|  
trayaś ca trisahasrāś ca devāḥ somaṃ pibanti vai \|\|



Vāyu-purāṇa 52.63, Ānandāśrama edition:

trayaś ca triśataṃ caiva trayastriṃśat tathaiva ca \|  
trayastriṃśat-sahasrāś ca devāḥ somaṃ pibanti vai \|\|



In the first line, the Vāyu-purāṇa verse from the Ānandāśrama edition gives the better reading triśatam for the reading triṃśataḥ found in the published Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa. But the reading it gives in the second line, trayastriṃśat-sahasrāś ca, instead of trayaś ca trisahasrāś ca, will not result in the Vedic number 3339.



As you wrote, variants of this verse are found in the Viṣṇu-purāṇa and the Liṅga-purāṇa, but they yield the number 36333 rather than 3339. This verse is of much importance, so I have checked the śloka indexes of all the eighteen (or nineteen) major purāṇas for it. It is also found in the Matsya-purāṇa (126.62-63 in the Veṅkaṭeśvara edition, 126.63-64 in the Ānandāśrama edition) and in the Agni-purāṇa (120.34-35, Bibliotheca Indica and Veṅkaṭeśvara editions), but again only yielding the number 36333. Of these purāṇas, we at present have a critical edition of only the Viṣṇu. We would expect some old manuscript of the Viṣṇu-purāṇa to have the needed readings of this verse to yield the number 3339.



Of the nearly 275 Viṣṇu-purāṇa manuscripts listed in the New Catalogus Catalogorum (University of Madras), the editors selected 43 to collate. After collating these 43 manuscripts, it was found that several were merely copies of older manuscripts that were collated. After eliminating these copies, 27 manuscripts remained, from which full variant readings were given. Surprisingly, none of these 27 best manuscripts had any reading for this verse, 2.12.7, giving a different number than 36333.



Interestingly, although the verse in question as found in the Liṅga-purāṇa, 1.56.11-12, yields the number 36333 rather than 3339, there are three other verses in this purāṇa that give the number of devas as 3339, in different contexts. These are 1.72.85, 1.100-21-22, and 1.102.21-22, in the Veṅkaṭeśvara edition. I did not find these verses in any other of the major purāṇas. R. C. Hazra found that the extant Liṅga-purāṇa differed so much from the early descriptions of its contents and the quotations from it found in the old smṛti-nibandhas that he could not regard it as the original Liṅga-purāṇa. Yet we see that it still contains important verses that are now found in no other purāṇa.



Thank you for the further information about S. P. L. Narasimhaswami, that: “The letter P in the initials of Narasimhaswami stands for ‘Paravastu’ a well known family title among South Indian Śrī-vaiṣṇavas.” I hope that his manuscript of the original Purāṇa-saṃhitā that he laboriously reconstructed can be found.
