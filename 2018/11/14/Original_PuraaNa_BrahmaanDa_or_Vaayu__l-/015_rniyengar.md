Dear Sri David,

You have posted so much of useful information; it takes considerable time to assimilate the material in perspective. The paper by Gonda posted by Sri Gopal has also been helpful. Some of the doubts and confusions I had about****Brahmāṇḍa and Vāyu are getting cleared.The letter P in the initials of Narasimhaswami stands for ‘Paravastu’ a well known family title among South Indian Śrī-vaiṣṇavas.He also wrote ‘Cālukya-caritam’ in Sanskrit, (Ref:Archives.org) perhaps the first such work on matter-of-fact history based on reading inscriptions, which was an area of his expertise. Hopefully, scholars from Andhra/Telangana will be in a position to trace his manuscript on the Purāṇa-samhitā.

My interest is not so much on the structural form of the earlierPurāṇas but on the internal consistency of astral theories and sky pictures contained in them.

regards

RN Iyengar
