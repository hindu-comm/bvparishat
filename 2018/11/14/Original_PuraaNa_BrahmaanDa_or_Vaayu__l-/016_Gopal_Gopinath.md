I am going thru the book Agama tirta - five studies in hindu balinese religion by C. Hooykaas. I am attaching the content page herewith. It is interesting to see that, in siva puja rituals practiced in Bali, the author was drawing parallels and similarities between the rituals described by Agora Sivacharyar in Tamil Nadu and texts he studied from Bali. Agora Sivacharyar was supposedly the royal acharya for veera rajendra chola or kulothunga 1 - between 11th and early 12th century AD. His works remain as the gold standard and the master reference for many rituals that are used even now in saiva agama temples and households in Tamil Nadu and may be Sri Lanka. It appears the rituals pre-date his works.  

  

That brings a layman question about the influence of saiva siddhanta together with siva purana on the religion practiced in Bali. If the Balinese Brahmanda purana version is dated to 10th century, did it co-exist with other puranic texts? I am sure something is missing in my thinking but I request the learned scholars to point out the gap in my understanding.
