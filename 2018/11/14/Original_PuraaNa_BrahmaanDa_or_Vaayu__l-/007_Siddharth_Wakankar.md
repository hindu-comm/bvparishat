The Deccan College published A Cultural History of Vayu purana by [Dr.D.R.Patil.It](http://Dr.D.R.Patil.It) may be profitably referred to along with the book on the Vayupurana by V.R.R.Dikshitar.

  

I found both the books to be excellent expositions some fifty years back.

  

Both these books are available in the Library of the Oriental Institute,Baroda and I read them some 45 years back.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
