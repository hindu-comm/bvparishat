Further to whether the Brahmāṇḍa and Vāyu purāṇas were originally a single purāṇa:

  

As past scholars have noted, the Veṅkateśvara Press edition of any particular purāṇa is often little more than a printed version of an individual manuscript, with all its unintelligible readings due to scribal errors. The Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa seems to be a representative example of this, even though it alone has preserved some crucially important correct readings, as noted here by Prof. Iyengar. Every edition of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa that I have seen since the publication of the Veṅkaṭeśvara Press edition in 1906, whether printed or digital, seems to be copied from this edition. All this gives the impression that what we have in these is THE Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa. Now that some purāṇa manuscripts have become available online, we are able to compare the printed edition(s) with a manuscript.



A manuscript of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa from the Raghunath Temple Sanskrit Manuscript Library, Jammu, is now available at:

Comparing just the first section, the prakriyā-pāda, we find that there are considerable differences in the numbers of verses per adhyāya. The numbers of verses in the manuscript of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa tally closer with the numbers of verses in the printed editions of the Vāyu-purāṇa. The Veṅkaṭeśvara Press edition of the Vāyu-purāna, 1895, is apparently based on the Bibliotheca Indica edition of the Vāyu-purāṇa, 1880-1888. The Ānandāśrama edition of the Vāyu-purāṇa, 1905 (apparently copied by the Gurumaṇḍala edition, 1959), differs from these two in its numbers of verses.



Here is a listing of the numbers of verses in each adhyāya of the prakriyā-pāda. First is the number of verses in the manuscript of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa, followed by the number of verses in the printed edition of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa. These are then followed by the number of verses in the Bibliotheca Indica and Veṅkaṭeśvara editions of the Vāyu-purāṇa, and last the number of verses in the Ānandāśrama edition of the Vāyu-purāṇa.



1. Brahmāṇḍa ms. 211; Brahmāṇḍa printed 174; Vāyu B.I./Veṇk. 185; Vāyu Ān.Āś. 205.

2. Brahmāṇḍa ms. 44; Brahmāṇḍa printed 48; Vāyu B.I./Veṇk. 41; Vāyu Ān.Āś. 45.

3. Brahmāṇḍa ms. 25; Brahmāṇḍa printed 0 (this whole adhyāya is missing in the printed ed.); Vāyu B.I./Veṇk. 22; Vāyu Ān.Āś. 24.

4. Brahmāṇḍa ms. 93; Brahmāṇḍa printed 38; Vāyu B.I./Veṇk. 82; Vāyu Ān.Āś. 92.

5. Brahmāṇḍa ms. 52; Brahmāṇḍa printed 34; Vāyu B.I./Veṇk. 50; Vāyu Ān.Āś. 54.

6. Brahmāṇḍa ms. 104; Brahmāṇḍa printed 141; Vāyu B.I./Veṇk. 73; Vāyu Ān.Āś. 79.



As may be seen, in numbers of verses this manuscript of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa, in the prakriyā-pāda, is closer to the printed Vāyu-purāṇa editions than to the printed Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa edition. This, of course, is not surprising if these two purāṇas were in fact originally one, as seems to be the case. We will know a lot more when the forthcoming critical edition of the Vāyu-purāṇa is published.
