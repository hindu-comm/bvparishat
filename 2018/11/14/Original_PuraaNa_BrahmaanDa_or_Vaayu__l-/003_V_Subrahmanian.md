Namaste

  

In this connection I would also request the scholars to throw light on the Vayu-Shiva purana identity. There is a 'Vaayaviya samhita' in the Shiva Purana. Is this a kind of integration of the Vayu Purana into the Shiva Purana? Sridhara Swamin in his commentary to the Vishnu Purana 1.8.has named 'VaayuukteH' and cites two verses which are actually found in the Shiva Purana.
