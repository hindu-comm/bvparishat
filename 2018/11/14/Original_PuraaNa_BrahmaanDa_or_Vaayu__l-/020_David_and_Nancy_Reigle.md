Dear Prof. Iyengar,



It really is of great importance, your discovery that the enigmatic Vedic number 3339 leads to the 18-year eclipse cycle. As you have noted, the 18-year Saros eclipse cycle has always been regarded as a discovery of the Chaldeans or Babylonians. Until your 2005 article, no one knew that it is also found in the earliest Vedic texts. The number 3339 there is established beyond any doubt, because of the great accuracy with which the Ṛg-veda was preserved, and because the verse giving it is also repeated in other Veda saṃhitās. Glad to see the additional references to it that you gave from the Nivid and the Bṛhad-devatā. The reference to this number found in the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa was not unknown, but was not understood until you showed how it clearly yields the 18-year eclipse cycle.



There is another published edition of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa, in Bengali script, that I have not seen. It was edited by Pañcānana Tarkaratna and published by the Vaṅgavāsī Press, Calcutta, in 1908, titled Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇam. This edition may have been based on a previous Bengali edition, edited by Devandranātha Vasu and published by the Viśvakośa Office, Calcutta, in 1895. The 1908 Tarkaratna edition was apparently reprinted in 1989. These two editions include Bengali translation. I have not found either of these online, but if a digital version exists, Shankara-ji can find it. I would also be glad to buy the 1989 reprint if anyone knows where it is available. The bibliographic data given here is from the 2005 article by Christophe Vielle, “From the Vāyuprokta to the Vāyu and Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇas: Preliminary Remarks towards a Critical Edition of the *vāyuprokta Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa*,” which I have attached.



The eagerly awaited forthcoming critical edition of the Vāyu-purāṇa has been under preparation at the Oriental Institute, Vadodara. I think that Dr. Sweta Prajapati, Director of the Oriental Institute, is a member of the BVP. Perhaps she can let us know when we might expect this critical edition to be published. It will be so helpful for ascertaining as exactly as we can what is in this very old purāṇa.
