Respected Siddharth Wakankar MahodayaH,

  

The link given as "Dr.D.R. Patil" in your mail is not working. The book "Cultural History from the Vayu Purana" by Dr. D.R. Patil can be downloaded from the following link -
<https://ia801602.us.archive.org/19/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.279903/2015.279903.Cultural-History.pdf>  

  

I presume that the book on Vayu Purana referred to by you is "Some Aspects of the Vayu Purana" by Shri V.R.R. Dikshitar. The link for this book is given as under.  

<https://ia600805.us.archive.org/15/items/SomeAspectsOfTheVayuPuranaDikshitar/Some%20aspects%20of%20the%20vayu%20purana%20Dikshitar.pdf>  

  

With regards,

Nagarajan K.
