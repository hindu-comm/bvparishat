Dear Subbu-ji (if I may),  

  

The verse that Śrī Śaṅkarācārya cites in his Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma-bhāṣya is not found in either the now extant Vāyu-purāṇa or in the now extant Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa, according to the śloka indexes that were added to the Nag Publishers reprints of the Veṅkaṭeśvara Press editions. Śrī Śaṅkarācārya in his bhāṣya attributes it to the Liṅga-purāṇa. It is not found in the now extant Liṅga-purāṇa, Veṅkaṭeśvara Press edition. But it is found in the now extant Śiva-purāṇa, as you said in your post, in its Vāyavīya-saṃhitā, 7.1.32.36. R. C. Hazra in his 1953 article, “The Problems Relating to the Śiva-Purāṇa,” says on p. 269 of its 1985 reprint: “The Vāyavīya-saṃhitā expressly names the Liṅga-purāṇa as its source in some matters.” So it would seem that this verse was found in the Liṅga-purāṇa that was available to Śrī Śaṅkarācārya, and may have been copied from there into the now extant Śiva-purāṇa.



Hazra in that article tells us that the Calcutta Vaṅgavāsī Press edition of the Śiva-purāṇa differs widely from the Bombay Veṇkaṭeśvara Press edition, having in common only three saṃhitās. The Calcutta edition has three more saṃhitās that are not found in the Bombay edition, and the Bombay edition has four more saṃhitās that are not found in the Calcutta edition. The Vāyavīya-saṃhitā is found in both editions of the Śiva-purāṇa. It so happens that the verse in question is also found in the Kailāsa-saṃhitā, at 6.9.14 of the Bombay edition. The Kailāsa-saṃhitā is also found in the Calcutta edition. 



Here is some additional information about the Vāyavīya-saṃhitā from Hazra’s article:

p. 272: “A careful study of the Vāyavīya-saṃhitā shows that it is a distinct work written by a person different from the authors of the other Saṃhitās. Hence, its date should be discussed separately.”

p. 273: “Hence the Vāyavīya-saṃhitā cannot possibly be dated earlier than 800 A.D.”

p. 273: “It is remarkable that none of the Smṛti-writers of Bengal is found to refer to or quote verses from the Vāyavīya-saṃhitā. On the other hand, this Saṃhitā was drawn upon by the South Indian scholars first of all, and it was much later that it came to be utilised by the Smṛti-writers of Orissa. So, this Saṃhitā seems to have been written in Southern India.”

  

I must defer to Hazra's expert knowledge of the purāṇas, but I still think it is quite possible that there was a genuine old Śiva-purāṇa.
