Dear Sri David,



It is heartening to know that half the world away someone is interested in the meaning and origin of the number 3339 on which I have spent considerable time and continue to do so. Your searches and the notes provided are all informative and helpful. Thanks for reading my 2005 IJHS paper. It needs further revision. In my shock and awe of having found the meaning of the RV number in the BP, quite unexpectedly, I quickly wrote up the article. Since then I have consulted severalPurāṇa versions. Initially I was under the impression VP, MP etc might have tried for longer periods, but this was not so. I purchased the VP critical edition from Baroda ORI only to find, as you have rightly noted, no variant reading is reported in the foot note.Liṅga Pu is certainly interesting but the variant readings have to be sorted out properly.

I feel in the initial stages of handling large numbers (in the Puranas) transition from an earlier additive approach to a later multiplicative approach is seen. In some places the two are perhaps mixed up causing confusion to later readers and copyists alike. We see a similar confusion in the interval number between the 26-Comets of Parashara (Ref: Brhatsamhita: Ketucara).This wild chase, in my case, was due to the MB. Since Gāndhārī foretells (or curses Kṛṣṇa) the end of Yādavās as after 18 x 2 = 36 years from the War, I was searching whether this was used to predict eclipses, but could not find any direct evidence. Thus, I went back to the Vedic texts and I am still studying them! The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad has a discussion on the number of Devas. This is said to be:

  

*'As many as are mentioned in the Nivid of the hymn of praise addressed to the Visvedevas, viz. three and three hundred, three and three thousand*.' (Max Mueller’s Transl.)



If taken literally this turns out to be 303+3003=3306. But we know the Nivid in the RV has 3339. Fortunately the Bṛhaddevatā has preserved the details and explains the Saucīka-agni legend at great length to conclude with the total count of Viśvedevas as the sum of three numbers, namely 3000, 309 and 30.

Hence I took BP to be the closest Purāṇa to Vedas as far as the astral contents are described. The questions that arise further are too many and also too subtle. How was this large number counted? Why the Saucīka hymns (RV X.53-2,4) are prescribed in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa rites? Is there reference to a lunar eclipse here? I will send you privately some work I have done on such questions.



I share your concern about the necessity of bringing out a critical edition of the *Vāyu-prokta* *Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa*, at least the Pūrvārdha.



Best regards
