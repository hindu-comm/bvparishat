Dear Prof. Iyengar,



Thank you for your very informative post. This topic is of much interest to me. What you found in your astronomical researches, that important information is found only in the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa, is highly significant. Especially so, regarding the information pertaining to the so-called 18-year Saros cycle. That this information is missing in the Vāya-purāṇa (at least in the few editions now available, while we await the publication of the critical edition), puts a different angle on the question of the original Purāṇa-saṃhita. The attempts to reconstruct this original core text so far have based themselves on the 7,557 verses that the two purāṇas have in common. To these, S. P. L. Narasimhaswami added 826 verses from the Vāyu-purāṇa that fill in two gaps in the corresponding Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa accounts. However, he did not take any verses from the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa that fill in gaps in the corresponding Vāyu-purāṇa accounts. Your research would show that this is necessary. From this core of 8,383 verses he reduced this number to the 4,000 verses that the original Purāṇa-saṃhitā is said to have consisted of. After spending decades of his life reconstructing the Purāṇa-saṃhitā, he died without it being published. This is highly unfortunate. I wonder if anyone might have contact with his family, where his manuscript might still be preserved. I attach his 1945 article, “Purana Samhita.” I also attach the other relevant article on this, “Original Purāṇa Saṃhitā,” by V. S. Agrawala, 1966.



Regarding the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa, I am not aware of any work being done toward a critical edition. We basically have only the 1906 Veṅkateśvara Press edition. As noted about it by F. E. Pargiter in his 1913 book, The Purāṇa Text of the Dynasties of the Kali Age, p. xxx: “It professes to be based on several MSS, yet gives variant readings only rarely, and leaves on my mind the impression that it has been silently emended at times; . . .” As for the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa preserved in Bali, the early notices about it are a bit misleading. It is in the Kawi language, not in Sanskrit. The original Sanskrit was loosely translated or paraphrased into Kawi about a thousand years ago. It is also abridged. This Kawi text has been translated into English by I. Gusti Putu Phalgunadi and published in 2000 under the title, The Indonesian Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa (Sundeep Prakashan, New Delhi). It had earlier been edited in Kawi and translated into Dutch by Jan Gonda, Het oud-javaansche Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa, 2 vols., 1932, 1933. Gonda did publish an English article on it, “The Old-Javanese Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,” in the journal Purāṇa, vol. 2, nos. 1-2, July 1960, pp. 252-267. This Kawi Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa quotes a number of Sanskrit verses throughout. Some of these are found only in the now available Vāyu-purāṇa, not in the now available Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa. Since only the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa came to Java and Bali, not the Vāyu-purāṇa (or any other purāṇa), this provides additional evidence that a thousand years ago these two purāṇas may have been one.



Your observation that the Viṣṇu-purāṇa has embellished or altered the accounts from the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa matches the observations made by other researchers. Both Pargiter in his collation of 63 manuscripts for his study of the dynasties of the kali-yuga (p. vi), and Narasimhaswami in his comparative work toward reconstructing the Purāṇa-saṃhitā (p. 56), note that the Vāyu, Brahmāṇḍā, and Matsya purāṇas closely agree with each other and contain the old verses unaltered, while the Viṣṇu and Bhāgavata purāṇas have re-phrased these verses in newer language, often condensing them. Narasimhaswami found that many of the old verses were also found in the Harivaṃśa, which also became an important source for his work in reconstructing the original Purāṇa-saṃhita.
