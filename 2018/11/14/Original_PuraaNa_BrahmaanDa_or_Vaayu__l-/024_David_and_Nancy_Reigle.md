Dear Sri Sudarshan,  

  

Thank you for letting me know about K. D. Abhyankar's follow-up article, "Eclipse Period 3339 in Rgveda--In Support of R. N. Iyengar's Thesis." I had not seen this article, and am glad to know about it. It is good that Prof. Iyengar's findings on this important matter have been supported like this.

  

Best regards,
