Dear Sri Subrahmanian and all,



Regarding the question of the Vāyu/Śiva purāṇa identity, since no-one has posted any reference to newer studies, it seems that the results of the older studies have been taken as correct by most writers. Now that the BVP has over 2000 members (!), there are probably some who are not familiar with the older studies. So here is some information on these. The unusual length of my reply is partly due to the encouraging words of Sri Gopal Gopinath, whose strong interest in purāṇa matters I share, and who I thank for providing a digital copy of Gonda’s article on the Old-Javanese Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa.



The acknowledged expert on comparative purāṇa studies was Rajendra Chandra Hazra, who published the results of his research in his 1940 book, *Studies in the Purānic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs*. He compared the contents of the now available purāṇas with the descriptions of the contents of the various purāṇas given in some of them, and he checked the now available purāṇas for a large number of purāṇa quotations that he found in the various smṛti-nibandhas. So he focused on the material on “rites and customs” that now makes up a large percentage of the contents of the purāṇas, rather than on the classical purāṇa pañca-lakṣaṇa-s like his predecessors had (F. E. Pargiter and S. P. L. Narasimhaswami were most interested in vaṃśa).



Hazra found that only seven of the eighteen major purāṇas that are now available more or less fit the early descriptions of their contents, and have in them the passages that are quoted from them by the early smṛti-nibandha writers. These seven are the Mārkaṇḍeya, Vāyu, Brahmāṇḍa, Viṣṇu, Matsya, and Bhāgavata purāṇas, and, with reservations, the Kūrma purāṇa (see pp. 57-75 on this one). The eleven that do not fit the descriptions or do not have matching quotations, and therefore must be regarded as minor purāṇas rather than major purāṇas, are the extant Vāmana, Liṅga, Varāha, Padma, Nāradīya, Agni, Garuḍa, Brahma, Skanda, Brahma-vaivarta, and Bhaviṣya purāṇas. As may be seen, he does not include the Śiva-purāṇa here. This is because he regarded the extant Śiva-purāṇa as only an upapurāṇa, and the Vāyu-purāṇa as the real major purāṇa. He wrote in his 1940 book, pp. 13-15:



“The character of the Vāyu as a Mahāpurāṇa has sometimes been called in question. The cause of this doubt is the use of the title 'Śiva' or 'Śaiva' for 'Vāyavīya' in the majority of the lists of the 'eighteen Mahāpurāṇas'. But this substitution, which has been taken wrongly in favour of the comparatively late sectarian Upapurāṇa called 'Śiva-purāṇa', is based on the Śaiva character of the Vāyu.”

“That the Vāyu was more important in the eyes of at least the Nibandha-kāras is shown by the fact that almost all of them quote verses from it, whereas the Śiva-p. is drawn upon by a very few of them. Hence it seems that the attempt to raise the Siva-p. to the status of a Mahāpurāṇa was due to a comparatively late sectarian zeal.”



We notice that Hazra has taken the references to the Śiva-purāṇa in the majority of the lists of the eighteen mahāpurāṇas as actually referring to the Vāyu-purāṇa under another name. Other writers have taken the Vāyu and Brahmāṇḍa purāṇas as originally being one (so did Hazra, see p. 18), and therefore that the presence of the Brahmāṇḍa purāṇa in the list of eighteen included the Vāyu-purāṇa under another name. This leaves room in the eighteen for a genuine old Śiva-purāṇa, even if the one that is now available can be shown to be a later production.



Some years later, when R. C. Hazra was working on the upapurāṇas (unfortunately the third of his three projected volumes, Studies in the Upapuranas, which would have included the Śaiva upapurāṇas, was never published), he wrote this article: “The Problems Relating to the Śiva-Purāṇa,” *Our Heritage*, vol. 1, 1953, pp. 46-68; reprint in *Dr. R. C. Hazra Commemoration Volume*, 1985, pp. 246-281. In the reprint, the Vāyavīya-saṃhitā of the Śiva-purāṇa is summarized on pp. 270-273. About it, Hazra wrote, p. 270: “It is a purely Śaiva work extolling the worship of Rudra in his different forms.” Its contents do not have much in common with the Vāyu-purāṇa.



One of the first writers to deal with this question extensively was Sashibhusan Chaudhuri, in his article: “On the Siva and Vayu Puranas,” *Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society*, vol. 15, 1929, pp. 183-194. He there concluded: “that the Vāyu Purāṇa of the Asiatic society is a genuine Purāṇa, belonging to a very early age, and as such it has got a greater claim than the Śiva Purāṇa to be reckoned as one of the original eighteen mahāpurāṇas.”



Later, in agreement with both Chaudhuri and Hazra, A. D. Pusalker wrote an article: “Vāyu Purāṇa versus Śiva Purāṇa,” *Journal of the University of Bombay*, vol. 10, 1941, pp. 148-155; revised reprint in his *Studies in the Epics and Purāṇas*, 1955, pp. 31-41. He concluded (p. 41): “In the present state of our knowledge it seems safe to conclude that the printed *Vāyu Purāṇa* is a genuine Mahāpurāṇa, and that the *Śiva Purāṇa* is a late work not fit to be called a Mahāpurāṇa, but is only an Upapurāṇa.”



So there was a consensus that the now available Vāyu-purāṇa rather than the now available Śiva-purāṇa should be counted among the eighteen mahāpurāṇas. Of course, this does take away from the value of the now available Śiva-purāṇa for those who find inspiration in it.
