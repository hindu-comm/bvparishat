गुपू, धूपू both are correct in the dhatupatha. The same is changed into गोपाय and धूपाय in usage in लार्वधातुक लकार only and in आर्धधातुक both are used. In लट् you have गोपायति from गोपाय, but in लिट् you have both गोपायमास and जुगोप. So you have to keep both according to grammatical requirements and you cannot expect to keep both or keep one according to your will.
