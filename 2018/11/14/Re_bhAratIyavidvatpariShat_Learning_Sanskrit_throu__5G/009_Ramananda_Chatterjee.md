The only best book available either for self study or with a teacher is, First Book of Sanskrit and Second Book of Sanskrit. By RG Bhandarkar. M R Kales Higher Sanskrit Grammar. This is a challenge, there is not a single topic left in practical grammar. There is not a single famous word left in its vocabulary.

  

I have lost more than 10 years of my precisous life because of self study misconception.
