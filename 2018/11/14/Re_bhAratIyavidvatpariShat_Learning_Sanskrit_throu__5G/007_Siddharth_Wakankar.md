Dear Sanskrit Lovers,

  

In July 2011,some Trustees of the Svadhya Mandal visited me at Vadodara.We planned and contacted some younger Sanskrit scholars to translate into English the Vedic works of Pt Satavalekarji.

  

The scholars also were very enthusiastic and a couple of meetings was held in Pune.I,however,could not attend those meetings.The monetary part was taken care of,but, unfortunately,nothing tangible has been done,for reasons not known to me.

  

If some influential person takes up this responsibility,then,that task could be achieved.

  

Best luck in that direction.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
