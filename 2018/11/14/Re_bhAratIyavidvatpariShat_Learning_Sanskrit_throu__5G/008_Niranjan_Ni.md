Sir:

  

The Satvalekar book only seems available in Hindi any English versions?

  

Also has anyone tried<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/msp/courses.htm> ?

  

This looks promising, but this includes other courses like history etc along with Sanskrit.

  

Has anyone tried this?

  

Or should I try a new post?
