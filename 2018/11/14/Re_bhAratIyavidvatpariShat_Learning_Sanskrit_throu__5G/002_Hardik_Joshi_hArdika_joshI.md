Dear Niranjan Ji,

  

Recently, Govt of India has launched an online learning portal [swayam.gov.in](http://swayam.gov.in).

  

There is a short term course in learning Sanskrit offered by IIT.The link for the course is:<https://swayam.gov.in/courses/4790-july-2018-introduction-to-basic-spoken-sanskrit>

  

They might offer a new batch soon which is based on weekly study.

  

Dr. Y N Rao and Shri J S Sastry also conduct online email based coaching which is a year long course. The last batch started in Feb 2018.

  

Best regards
