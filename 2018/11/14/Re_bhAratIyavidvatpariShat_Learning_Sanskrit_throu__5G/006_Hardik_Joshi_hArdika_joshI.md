Respected Scholars,

  

I had visited the place (Swadhyay Mandal - Kila Pardi) in the month of June. Unfortunately, the work of Pandit Satawlekar is facing monetary troubles. They do have lot of land near Valsad, Gujarat but could not manage it. Most of the scholarly work remains unpublished and few books have gone out of print. Luckily I managed to buy few books which were in not so good condition.

  

They also have a small Gaushala and residential Gurukul for Vedic studies. Fewattempts are being made by the trustees to legalize the courses and get funds from the state Govt. I think the same status might be for all Gurukuls across India. As of now, there is support of RSS upto some extent.

  

It will be a great service if any of us can help them to restore the work of Pandit Satawlekar. The trustees are helpful and would be happy to get help from any of us.

  

Best regards,

  

Hardik Joshi
