Harih Om,

  

 Sir, thank you **SO MUCH** for this message !



 I purchased in 1989 "A Short History of Sanskrit Literature" (1984), published by RS Vadhyar & Sons. This small book has covered in so brief almost the entire Skt Literature. It was very very useful for a working person like me and not having any time to attend Sanskrit classes and no guide that time to suggest good books in Skt.

  

 Namaste and best regards

 Narayan Prasad
