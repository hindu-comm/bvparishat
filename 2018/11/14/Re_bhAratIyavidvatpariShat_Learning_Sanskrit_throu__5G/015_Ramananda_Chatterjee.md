You should not certify yourselves. First drawback of self study is dur ahankaara.

1\. He is asking about sanskrit not panini.

2\. Writing article is different than understanding difficult verses lines in sanskrit is different. And writing flawless sanskrit.

3\. Even though a traditional method used in Tenali vyakarana examinations, the certificate proclaiming Vyakarana Ratna is faulty with respect to grammar like pareeksaayaam utteerNaha. Traditional scholars are making mistakes Kimuta self study

  

I simply don't agree with any panditakeeTaas or with you.
