Namaste Ramanada Chatterjee

  

1\.  Thanks for reading my post to at least 10 lines ( if not till the end of the post).

  

2\.  The Sutra - Sloka - sangraha of my post is placed below:



      अशास्त्रीयं योगहीनं लिपिमात्रशरीरकम्  \| 

      भाषाध्ययन - पाण्डित्यं हन्ति पाणिनि भारतीम् \|\| 

   

Every one is not as learned as you, Chatterjee ji.I hope this four liner in Samskrutham satisfies your expectation.

  

3\.  While your comment on my long post is well taken, you may also contemplate how many pages have been written on one sentence of three words' Athato Brahma Jijnyasa'- And why ? 

  

    After 15 posts, the primary issue raised by Nityanada misra ji reading as follows is not addressed. \< We are in an age where one of our greatest fears is what will happen to Sanskrit in the next generation. Will we have the such ‘pandit’-s, as we had in the past, for whom ‘vidya’ is ‘kanthastha’?

  

4\.  Many are going tangential and responding the answers- action points as ' Avataar, Prodigal child, Kaliyuga, lamenting on how and what current children are not learning / ought to learn ( if some one is there to teach and get them aligned to aa job-profession need), Sanskrit Institutionalism on western religion language models …….
