What Sri Krishna Kashyapa said has been clearly stated in our tradition long ago:

*bahu-śāstra-kathā-kanthā-*

*   romanthena vṛthaiva kim?/*

*anveṣṭavyaṁ prayatnena*

*   mārute jyotir āntaram//*

  

At the same time,

*svādhyāya-**pravacanā**bhyāṁ na pramaditavyam//,*

and more importantly,

*svādhyāya-**pravacane** eveti nāko maudgalyaḥ*

*- **taddhi tapaḥ***

  

Without *pravacana*-s who will know, and how?

*Pravacana*-s must, of course, ultimately inspire one to endeavour towards

the inner search.

  

That such a small boy is able to achieve even this amount of skill and scholarship

is extraordinary.
