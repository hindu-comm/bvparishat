Dear Krishna Kashyap,

  

You are absolutely right.

  

Very few of our boys and girls do any regular tapas like the pranayama etc.

  

In fact,in followers of almost all the religions,the same is a problem.

  

My Zoroastrian friend,Dr.Phiroz Kotwal,the 86 year.old Chief Priest of the Tata Parsi agiary in Mumbai,says the same thing about the followers of his religion.

  

There is decadence everywhere, possibly,due to our mentality which is more influenced by western ways and culture.

  

How to remedy this situation is a very grave problem.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
