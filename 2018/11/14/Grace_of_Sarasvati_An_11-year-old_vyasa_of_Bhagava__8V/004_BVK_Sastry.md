Namaste



1. On the most haunting daunting writing on the wall question articulated by Nityanand Misra ji \< **one of our greatest fears is what will happen to Sanskrit in the next generation** \> :



2. Outcome to proliferate ‘Bala- Vyasa /Shuka’ - depend upon what the current generation opts to do now and implements in the next three years. Just wish list articulation and battle cries will not resolve the issue. I place below the several options and the logical outcomes based on current operational models. What I see is two things: (a) The current options are all deviating from the Panini- Patanjali- Yaska set ‘Vedanga / Yoga Samskrutham unified approach. (b) Apart from a ‘Common ground Concern of Fear, there is NO COMMON COURSE OF ACTION, or intention to join hands to resolve a remedial solution. Each team seems to be happy pushing a partial solution ! 



3. Following options are currently available according to the state of art scenario in Sanskrit teaching models: ( *Where almost every model misses out the vital soul of Samskrutham as ‘ Uccharanam’ – Articulation per rules of Vedanga Shikshaa shaastra*.)



**Option 1: Sanskrit status learning it as a Classical language** : **The learning of language gets more and more anchored to SCRIPT**
promoting the Harvard-Oxford models as the standard, and dropping out the ‘ Paninian tradition of ‘ Vedanga’ - Articulation of True Sounds Varna Svara Shuddhataa / approach ( The SCRIPT-Basic and Base approach
isolated from ‘Articulation is the key issue; it does not matter
whether it is calligraphy or Typography or keying in for the Manuscript, Print, Computer font based Document). The ‘VOICE’ of Sanskrit gets muted or Automated machine Generated. Should this be called ‘ Latinization or Romanization of Sanskrit’ can be a point
for scholarly debate.



**Option 2: Sanskrit status learning it as a Spoken language** : The dilution of Spoken Sanskrit with reference to the Panini: Language Grammar gets further diluted. It is not because of the Paninian rule base slackness or shortcoming ! It is plainly ‘Speakers opting for easy button mode’ sacrificing the ‘ Precision and Perfection’. Outcome will be one more ‘ Prakruth variation of Bhashaa aspect of Sanskrit, rich osmosis with English and several other non-indic language ‘ prakruti- padas’- primary words. We saw one such illustration in the ‘ nishkichanah – saichanah’ terms. Should this be called ‘ Prakrutization Or Global Anglicizing of Sanskrit’ can be a point
for scholarly debate.



 This is a practical lane analyzed as ( **Tvaritaa Vakttarah**) - using Patanjali’s expression from Paspashaahnika, debating the question: Why (which also cover How) to Study Samskrutham in the frame of Rules of Grammar ( Kimartham adhyeyam (Samskrutha -) Vyakaranam ? )
We become Fast Speakers of a tongue: Sanskrit !



**Option 3: Sanskrit status learning it as a Literary language** ( using Translation/ Transliteration schemas): Sanskrit would get freezed to the classical royal court poetry model, ornate, pedantry, stylish but out of normal public usage . This surely a model for becoming a contender for ‘ National Literary Awards in less spoken / Classical languages’ ! as a ‘Heritage watermark preservation’ .



 The much debated work called ‘“King David in Oudh: a Bible story in Sanskrit and the Just King at an Afghan court” and Bible translation to Sanskrit present such models. 

 ( Ref for King David in Oudh story :

**Option 4: Sanskrit status learning it as a Foreign language** :
Sanskrit will enjoy the language –league companionship of several languages in endangerment ) Both at India and Worldwide) ! . This surely a model for Global Knowledge Treasure hunt on ‘ Indiana Jones – Ancient (forgotten) Language Manuscript - map-decoding ’ model ! See Endangered Languages projects globally and India government UGC sponsored projects ! UNESCO defines four levels of language endangerment between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct": : Vulnerable, Definitely endangered, Severely endangered, Critically endangered. One can make some effort to identify the passing phase and pace of Sanskrit using the ‘ Statistical survey details from Government of India’. Explore links below:

**Option 5: Sanskrit status learning it as a Religion-Ritual
language** : The ‘Vedic Gukul’s’, Hindu Religion institutions will show case this model as a path way to generate the output of ‘ pride’ called ‘ Vedic Scholar/ Purohita’ - a ‘ young boy, half body dressed , shining head with a tuft’ and across thread’. The roadmap is already defined since 17^(th) century and there is nothing to rediscover / invent here. Here, the Sanskrit study goal is building ability to simulate and beat a ‘ recorded voice playback device on demand’ combined with ingenuity to perform / address indigenous cultural- faith appropriate ritual. This is the hall mark signature of profession. Critical and Important. Necessary but not sufficient condition. Scholarship of Text in this model is a non-issue.



**Option 6: Sanskrit status learning it as a Historical Rule bound Artificial language useful for Sanskrit Computational linguistics **:
A new filed under exploration as ‘ Techno-linguistic Scholarship’.
Here the study of Sanskrit language-grammar is for any other purpose than ‘ Samskrutham as it was intended’. The new goals are like : Machine Translation, Extraction of Language independent rules from specific Sanskrit grammar texts and usages, Parsing constructions et al. This surely a model for goals of Building Intelligent Computer programs for Language Automated Translation : A Treasure hunt path of ‘ Language related Human Neurology and cognitive processed :: A stepping stone to build the Humanised Robots of future ! !
