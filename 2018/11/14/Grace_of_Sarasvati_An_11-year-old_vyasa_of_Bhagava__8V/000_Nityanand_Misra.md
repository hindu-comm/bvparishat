Pranama-s to all list members.

  

We are in an age where one of our greatest fears is what will happen to Sanskrit in the next generation. Will we have the such ‘pandit’-s, as we had in the past, for whom ‘vidya’ is ‘kanthastha’? Amidst these fears, it is heartening to come across ‘bala-vyasa’-s of the ‘Bhagavata Purana’, which is considered the gold standard for Sanskrit scholarship (विद्यावतां भागवते परीक्षा).

  

A few days ago, I chanced upon a news report on one such ‘bala-vyasa’: Ayusha Krishna Nayana (Ayusha Nautiyal) from Uttarakhand. The 2017 report said that this ‘bala-shukadeva’,who was ten years old then, has been delivering ‘katha’-s on the Bhagavata Purana since when he was just six years old!! The report stated that he has committed the entire ‘Bhagavata Purana’ and other Puranic literature to his memory. I watched some of his videos and realized that the claims are true. This walking example of Sarasvati’s grace knows the entire ‘Bhagavata Purana’, many other Puranic texts, and the ‘Ramacharitamanasa’ by heart. In his ‘katha’ performances, mellifluous Sanskrit verses flow out from his mouth like the flow of the Ganga. They are followed by lucid explanations as the audience hears in rapt attention. The voice is that of a child, the delivery is that of a seasoned ‘katha’ artiste, and the content is that of a *pāradṛśvan* of the ‘Bhagavata Purana’.

  

Here is an example of his ‘katha’ performance: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S28lrY11VRo>

  

Here is his interview from last year: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddZrz89em_0>

  

Hoping many more such child prodigies are born in India and inspire people to study Sanskrit literature and Hindu texts.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
