Thanks Dr. K.S. Kannan.

  

I agree with your post 100%. thanks for pointing out the importance of svAdhyAya and pravachana.

  

I am not referring to Bala Vyasa issue at all. I do appreciate the young boy's mastery of our scriptures.

  

I just once asked my srivaishnava friend, what percentage of Srivaishnava community folks do you think meditate on a regular basis?.

The answer was : about 1 percent.

I said I think at least about 10% to 30% of the buddhist community people meditate regularly. . This is what I meant as slow deterioration of vedic values of tapas etc.

  

I am not trying to compare Buddhism versus Vedic systems at all. This is just to make a point.
