You make some valid points, but is that not the effect of kaliyuga?

As para vani degrades to vaikhari, this is what will happen.

  

When the original Srimad Bhagavatam was spoken, the vakta and the srotas were both adhikaris of the highest order.

We do not have that privilege due to lack of tapasya and constant infighting.

  

The vakta of today cannot be choosy in giving medicine. And youtube is the media one has available to use.

  

It is not for us to wonder about the inner culture or lack thereof wrt the upanyasaka.

In any case no true man or woman of God will ever beat their own drums.

  

"bade badai na kare, bade na bole bol, Rahiman hira kab kaha lakh taka mero mol"

  

So the real question is what qualities are required within the srota to identify whether the vakta has inner culture or not?
