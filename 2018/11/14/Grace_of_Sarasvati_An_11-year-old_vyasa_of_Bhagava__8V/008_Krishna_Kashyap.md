I am not writing this only in reference to this bala-vyasalectures. In general, regarding any lecture, though I appreciate the fact that people who turn towards God in some ways are superior to money minded people, one other issue that bothers me is:

  

The focus of the Upanishads was to directly gain experience of Brahman. Gaining experience here was the focus. Most upanyasa, lectures etc. focus on academic knowledge of itihasapuranas. I know these lectures are guiding millions of followers. I do understand the value. Of course, I am not against them, as itihAsa purANabhyAm vedam samupabramhayEt - states they are important for understanding Vedas. I am not against bhakti, since, all Acharyas have stressed the need for bhakti in one way or the other. However, the focus is on the bAhya or external worship rather than Antara or internal experience. Even the katopanishad states:nAyam Atma pravachanEna labhyah" (Brahman is not attained by lecturing). This shift of focus from internal to external over thousands of years is causing deep degradation and our Vedic system is deteriorating to a pure "faith-based" system. We are losing the core of the system which is "vedanta vijnana", ie. it is a science and itcan be experienced, as indicated in "pratyakshAvagamam dharmyam- Gita". Even in daily aradhana or prayers, the mAnasika arAdhana is taking very low priority versus the bAhya, which involves incense (dhoopa), arati etc. Of courseArati etc. are supposed to guide an aspirant into inner experience. I am not belittling external worship. However,if that becomes 99% and mAnasika worship becomes 1%, it is going in the wrong way.

  

I am not the only person who thinks like this. Many of my teachers have expressed this in different ways.
