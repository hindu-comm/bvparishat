Friends,

  

These are the instances of the punya collected through past Avataras.There is no other explanation as to how Jnaneshvara could compose his work at the age of 16 and how Shankaracharya could achieve this much in his tender age.

  

India is blessed with such prodigies.

  

Salute to them.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
