The thread initiating post was by aadaraNeeya Sri Nityanand Misra-ji.

  

He is not a scholar who approves of any scholarship just like that. He is a great scholar of the matters that he found in the child scholar. If he has admired someone, it is never without a basis. He is discerning enough to distinguish between rote learning and a proper understanding.

  

The child whose verse-recitation I shared too is reciting verses of classical Telugu with proper breaks, pauses intonations etc., that reflect a clear understanding of the content. Particularly in languages like Telugu and Kannada, there is a very interesting and wonderful tradition of verse reciting technique. The child picked it up well at that tender age is what amazed the news channel people too.

  

At a time when we are all lamenting the fact of waning interest among the next generation children in things classical , to find children of such calibre in classical literature and scriptures is really heartening and reassuring about the future of classical studies in the country.
