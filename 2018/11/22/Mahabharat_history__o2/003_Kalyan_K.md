The Mahabharata has something in it for almost everybody.  
  
Those who want to read it for pleasure, can read it as a story with a lot of sub-narratives.  
  
Those who want to read it for philosophy can read the Bhagavad Gita, Sanat sujatiya, Anu Gita, Moksha dharma etc. The Vishnu sahasranama also has beautiful philosophical import behind each name, as is brought out by its various commentators. Samkhya, yoga, vedanta, pancaratra are all present in the Mahabharata.  
  
Those who want to read it for devotion can read the devotional sections. While primarily focused on devotion to Vishnu/Krishna, there are significant sections that focus on devotion to Shiva also.  
  
Those who want to read it as a moral tale, have plenty of sections catering to them.  
  
Those who enjoy reading about descriptions of war, can read the war sections.  
  
The Mahabharata can be read by anybody irrespective of caste or gender.  
  
  
PS: I have so far read the Adi parva and Sabha parva translations by van Buitenen and till now I have not faced any problems of disunity or disputes in my family.
