I also was told in my childhood some 65 years back that the Mahabharata book should not be kept in the house, otherwise,it will create fueds in the house. That was the way of thinking in those days,at least,in some orthodox,so.called god fearing, families.

  

After we grow,we come to know the importance of the Mahabharata and its contents,though in earlier life,we were under the influence of the general मान्यता.
