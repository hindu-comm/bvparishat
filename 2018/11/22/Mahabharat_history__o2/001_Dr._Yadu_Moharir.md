Dear all:

  

a. Have Indians learned anything from Mahabhaarata ?

  

b\. Do we follow anything from the take home message of bhaarta saavitri ?

  

ūrdhvabāhurviraumyeṣa na ca kaścicchṇoti me \|  
dharmādarthaśca kāmaśca sa kiṁ arthaṁ na sevyate \|\| 89  

  

What is the use of any critical edition of this is not understood or followed !?  

  

Best Rgds

  

Dr Yadu
