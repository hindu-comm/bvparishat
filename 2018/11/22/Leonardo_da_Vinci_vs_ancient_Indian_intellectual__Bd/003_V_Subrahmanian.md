I think two luminaries of the medieval period can be considered:

  

# Works of Sri Vidyaranya

Sri Vidyaranya’s literary contributions comprise works on Vyakarana, Mimamsa, Smriti, Purana, astronomy/astrology, Mantra Sastra, music, Darsana and Advaita Vedanta.

  

Here are his works listed:<https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/sri-vidyaranyas-complete-works>.
He was a pioneer administrator, having founded and guided a Kingdom.

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidyaranya>

  

**Vidyaranya**([IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAST "IAST"): Vidyāraṇya) is variously known as a[kingmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingmaker "Kingmaker"),[patron saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint "Patron saint")and[high priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_priest "High priest")to[Harihara I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harihara_I "Harihara I")and[Bukka Raya I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukka_Raya_I "Bukka Raya I"), the founders of the[Vijayanagara Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayanagara_Empire "Vijayanagara Empire"). He was the 12th Jagadguru of the[Śringeri Śarada Pītham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sringeri_Sharada_Peetham "Sringeri Sharada Peetham")from 1380-1386.^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidyaranya#cite_note-1))

Vidyaranya helped the brothers establish the empire sometime in 1336. He later served as a mentor and guide to three generations of kings who ruled over the Vijayanagara Empire. Vijayanagara ([Hampi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampi "Hampi")), the capital of the empire, had a temple dedicated to Mādhavācārya.

He was also a reputed[Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit")-language author.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidyaranya#cite_note-2))He is identified as**Madhavacharya**,^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidyaranya#cite_note-3))the author of the**Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha**, a compendium of different philosophical schools of[Hindu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy "Hindu philosophy")and*[Pañcadaśī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchadasi "Panchadasi")*, an important text for[Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta "Advaita Vedanta").

  

Sri Vedanta Desika

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta_Desika>  

  

**Sri Vedanta Desikan**(**Swami Desika**,**Swami Vedanta Desika**,**Thoopul Nigamaantha Desikan**) (1268–1369)^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta_Desika#cite_note-College_2001-1))was a[Sri Vaishnava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Vaishnavism "Sri Vaishnavism")guru/philosopher and one of the most brilliant stalwarts of Sri Vaishnavism in the post-[Ramanuja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanuja "Ramanuja")period. He was a[poet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet "Poet"),[devotee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti "Bhakti"),[philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher")and master-teacher (desikan).

  

He composed over hundred works in the following genre:  

• 28 devotional poems in Sanskrit such as Hayagriva-stotram, Kamasika-ashthakam and Gopala-vimshati

• 24 devotional poems and treatises in Tamil such as Gitartha-sangraham and Charama-sloka-churkku

• 11 philosophical treatises such as Shata-dushani, Mimamsa-paduka and Tattva-mukta-kalapam

• 10 commentaries on the works of previous acharyas such as Stotra-ratna-bhashya , Chatus-shloki-bhashya and Tatparya-chandrika

• 5 Narrative poems such as his magnum-opus, the Paduka-sahasram, and the epic poem called Yadavabhyudaya which rivals the decorative poetry of Mahakavi Kalidasa’s works, and the Hamsa-sandesha

  

## Desika's expertise in sciences, technology and the arts\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vedanta_Desika&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Desika's expertise in sciences, technology and the arts")\]

Vedanta Desika was known as Sarva-tantra-svatantra or a master of science, philosophy, arts and crafts. His knowledge in these fields were frequently put to test by those who could not comprehend how a single mind could be so competent in so many diverse fields of knowledge. A few episodes from Desika’s life will illustrate this.

### Masonry\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vedanta_Desika&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Masonry")\]

A mason challenged Vedanta Desika to construct a well by using bricks with uneven dimensions. The Shilpa Sastra, an ancient treatise on arts and crafts from India says that bricks which are uniform in size, have square corners, have a specific size, and are red in colour are the best for construction. Even though the bricks given to him did not fulfil these requirements, Desika used his extraordinary acumen to arrange these bricks in a unique sequence and plastered them to form the circular periphery of the well, which can still be seen in Tiruvahindrapuram.

### Sculpture\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vedanta_Desika&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Sculpture")\]

Once a sculptor asked Desika to make an image out of panchaloha (a mixture of five metals - copper, tin, lead, silver and zinc) on a condition that the image had to exactly fit on the base provided by him. Desika not only sculpted an immaculate image but also pointed out the defects in the base structure provided by the professional sculptor.

### Food science\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vedanta_Desika&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Food science")\]

The Vedic scriptures categorize food into three – sattva, rajasa and tamasa. The sattva food promotes serene mind and long life whereas the rajasa and tamasa foods promote anxiety and laziness respectively. Taking cues from the Vedic scriptures, Vedanta Desika has provided a detailed catalogue of food which should be consumed to maintain a healthy mind and a disease-free life.

### Behavioral science\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vedanta_Desika&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Behavioral science")\]

Vedanta Desika wrote an allegorical drama called Sankalpa Surodayam which beautifully portrays the different aspects of human character and their interplay which can lead a man towards a higher goal - Salvation (moksha), or to a lower goal – the infinite loop of birth and death. Here ‘sankalpa’ is the divine will of the compassionate God to protect humans by granting them salvation and ‘suryodaya’ is the sunrise that dispels the inner darkness of man. The main character in this play is Man with two forces acting on him: (i) divine and (ii) demoniac. The divine forces aspire to attain salvation whereas the demoniac pull him into the unending cycle of birth and death. Vedanta Desika, the mighty genius in poetry and drama, personifies these forces into kings and queens who in turn seem to be assisted by their own armies (the human qualities that drive these forces). Desika, with his subtle wit and deep insight, portrays how these characters debate between the good and the evil propensities as he goes on to establish the divine destiny of Man through them.

### Mathematics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vedanta_Desika&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Mathematics")\]

It was in early 18h century that the great mathematician, Leonhard Euler investigated the Knight’s tour problem where the knight had to tour the entire chess board without any repetition. But, who would have imagined that this was not just solved by Vedanta Desika, but was woven with intricate poetry and philosophy back in 13th century. In the 30th chapter of his composition, the Paduka Sahasram, Vedanta Desika had used several types of poetic imagery. Chaturanga Turanga Bandham was one such imagery through which the knight’s tour problem had already been solved elegantly, 500 years before Euler.

Desika showed his knowledge of the arts and sciences through other works Silpartha-saram , a guide on sculpting, and Bhugola-nirnayam – a research text on the formation of the earth.
