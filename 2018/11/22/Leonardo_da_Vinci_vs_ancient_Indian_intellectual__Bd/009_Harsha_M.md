Vidhwan Sarvatra Poojayet

  

Leonardo Da Vinci is an all rounder, brilliant, engineer, painter, and a person to be respected and perhaps followed as well.

  

So no problems if the school is named on him.

  

However, if you want an Indian counter part, you can see the wiki of Shivarama Karanth from Karnataka.

  

A scholar

A writer who got Gnyana Peetha award.

A science enthusiast who wrote science encyclopaedias for children in kannada.

An environmentalist and ecologist, you should read Prani Prapancha written by him.

Reinvented and encouraged Yakshagana in Karnataka.

A person who created a nature-school in his home for children, called Balavana.

He was a journalist who started his own printing press to reduce costs.

  

If you are from karnataka and you want a local person similar to Leonardo, you dont get a better person than him.
