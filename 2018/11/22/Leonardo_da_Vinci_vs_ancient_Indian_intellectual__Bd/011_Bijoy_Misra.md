I don't think one looks for a name equivalent to Leonardo da vinci.

Take p person who has contributed locally wherever the school is located.

The name is what the students can relate and accept as a cultural role model.

It can be very local, that brings character and creativity to the student's mind.

Relationship is very important for the young education.
