Dear scholars,  
Namaste  
I have a question for you! One of my friend wants to name his school on the name of **Leonardo da Vinci**  
Is there any Indian scholar exists who is in the comparison of Leonardo da Vinci . I want to suggest him that he should name his school in the name of an Indian intellectual.
