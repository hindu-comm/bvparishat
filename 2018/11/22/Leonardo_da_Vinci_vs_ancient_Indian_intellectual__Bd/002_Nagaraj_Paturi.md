Depends on what aspects of the Italian polymath that he is impressedwith.

  

Then we can look for the equivalent polymath, thinker etc.

  

**Leonardo da Vinci**is a renaissance time figure.

  

So equivalent could be from Indian modern time or renaissance time.

  

Someone like Sri Aurobindo?
