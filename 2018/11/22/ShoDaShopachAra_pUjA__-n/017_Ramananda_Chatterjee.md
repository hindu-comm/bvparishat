AvAhan is a procedure inviting god from our heart to pratima, for saligram this is not required. After the puja performance , god is taken back to our heart.

  

Ehi (y)ehi mama hrtpadmastitha sripurusottam\|

AvAhayAmi pithesmin pratimAyAm ramApate\|\|

Whereas PraN Partisth is the thing done on first day of puja for a new pratima.

  

AvAhan is done with six mudras

AvAvhito Bhav sannihito bhav samsthapito bhav saniridho bhav avaguntito bhav sammukho bhav suprasanno bhav after inviting from our hrday kamal.
