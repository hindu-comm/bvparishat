Namaste Vidvadvarenya

  

If you are using Shalagrama Shilas for Puja you don't have to doआवाहन at all. God is present in the Salagrama always and will never leave it. Every God in the Panchayatana Puja like Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, Devi or Shakti and Surya has His own Salagrama. We have to keep them in a particular arrangement and then do Puja. Vishnu has black Salagrama. Shiva has Baana Linga. Ganesha has Red Sonabhadra. Devi has Swarnamukhi. And Surya has crystal.

  

The arrangement is four Salagramas are placed in the four corners of a square and one in the centre of the square. The Central Salagrama is the main Devata. Therefore there can be Shiva Panchayatana if you place Baana Linga in the centre, Vishnu Panchayatana, if you place black Salagrama in the centre, Shakti Panchayatana if you place Swarnamukhi in the centre, Ganesha Panchayatana if you place Sonabhadra in the centre, and Surya Panchayatana if you place crystal in the centre. But you have to place the 5 Salagramas in a particular order. This order is given in the below article-
