Dear Scholars,प्रणामाः ।

  

षोडषोपचार पूजा, the process of praying in sixteen steps has its's first step known as आवाहन. As I am given to understand,आवाहन is the process of inviting a fraction of the universal energy into the idol that we are praying to.  

  

In this context, I have two questions.

  

1\) What is the difference between आवाहन andप्राणप्रतिष्ठा ?

2\) If the first of the 16 steps is आवाहन, then shouldn't there also beनिर्वाहण as the last step (The process of saying goodbye to the invited fraction and sending it off back to the universe)?

  

It seems a little illogical that we do the षोडषोपचार पूजा, doing आवाहन day after day, but not निर्वाहण at all. May be I am missing the right meaning of आवाहन.

  

Thanks

Neelesh
