In Saurastra-somnath area we observe as below

1) here is never visarjanam on गणेश पूजने, this has logic that Ganesha ji is always on earth ( त्वं मूलाधार स्थितो सि नित्यम्) among five atharva suktas only Ganesha is addressed that tvam moolaadhaar sthito si nityam,

2\) five panchayatan worship also never visarjayet,

3\) instead of five different shalgrama linga, idol and a black shalgrama as a panchayatan also worshipped, even in my home a durga panchayatan having only black shalgram, parad linga and idols of sun, Devi, Ganesha,

Learned scholars kindly enlight more
