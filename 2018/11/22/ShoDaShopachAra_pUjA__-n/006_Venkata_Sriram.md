Namaste,

  

Simple logic:

  

प्राणप्रतिष्ठा is 'infusing life force' into the upAsya-murti. Pls note that before infusion of life force, it is just an ordinary stone. Once, the life force is infused with mantra-s, it is as good as the devata-murti vibrant with prANa-shakti. He becomes an elderly gentleman / lady for us that requires utmost respect & care from us.

  

Now, when elderly gentleman / lady, knocks our house or stands at the threshold of our house, don't we welcome them inside our house saying 'स्वागतम्...सुस्वागतम्' in our language. The same concept is applied in pUjA also as you are now in relationship with the most-respected gentleman / lady of your family who is ready to receive your worship.

  

The act of bidding farewell with utmost respect isविसर्जनं / उद्वासनं .

  

Even in our daily sandhya ritual, we welcome Mother Gayatri with 'आयातु वरदा...." and bid farewell with 'उत्तमे शिखरे जाते....'. We bid farewell to Him / Her and ask them retire to the same place where they reside. Our guruji used to utter the mantraहृद्पद्मे मुदा because, the deity whom we worship, infact, reside in our heart. We do prANa-pratiSTa into the deity by infusing our prANa into it and perform the udvAsana with the act ofप्रविलापन into our heart again.

  

This is the logic. Now, for some of the idols that are used for daily worship, the visarjana / udvAsana need to be made. Once, prANa pratiSTa is done, they reside in our worship room and receive our prayers / obeisance daily with naivedya.

  

rgs,

sriram
