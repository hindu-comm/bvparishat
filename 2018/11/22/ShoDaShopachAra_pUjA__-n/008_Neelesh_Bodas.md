Definitely. Thanks to all those who already expressed their views.

  

When I was a kid, I was taught that the daily pooja of our household idols is to be done in 16 steps, commonly known asषोडशोपचाराः. They go as follows -

(Taking example of Ganesha, one can substitute any god here, or even the पञ्चायतनम्).

  

1\. श्रीगणेशाय नमः , आवाहयामि = Invite the energy into the idol

2\. श्रीगणेशाय नमः, आसनम् समर्पयामि = Give the energy a place to sit

3\. श्रीगणेशाय नमः, पाद्यं समर्पयामि = Welcome with a little water on feet

etc etc up to

16\. श्रीगणेशाय नमः, मन्त्रपुष्पाञ्जलिं समर्पयामि ।

(The exact names / operations could be a little different. [This list](https://www.sanatan.org/hindi/a/5174.html)more-or-less matches to the sequence that we follow).

  

In addition, for special occasions (Ganesh Chaturthi / Navaratri), when a separate idol (usually made of soil) is brought home, we do -

1\) प्राणप्रतिष्ठा on the first day = Inviting the prana (again the energy?) into the idol

2\) 16 upachar from first to last day as a part of daily pooja

3\) विसर्जन on the last day (Followed by immersion of the idol in water).

  

In this context my question was two fold -

  

1\) Just like प्राणप्रतिष्ठा is "logically compensated" by विसर्जन, should not आवाहन be compensated by something (like sending back)?

2\) What is the difference between प्राणप्रतिष्ठा and आवाहन ? Is the meaning written above correct?

  

And now after your question, I think this approach may not be common, so I also want to ask the scholars that what is the correct way of doing the pooja of household idols everyday? Is there a recommended book etc ? (I follow Maharashtrian method, if that matters).



Thanks for all those who responded so far.
