I am not sure whether the 16 upacharas have been identified in this mail string.

As a person with some remnants of purohit genes, I recall a verse which is found in the text books used by purohits.

The sixteen upacharas are

आवाहनासनं पाद्यम् अर्घ्यमाचमनं तथा।

स्नानवस्त्रोपवीतानि गन्धपुष्पे च धूपकम्।

दीपं नैवेद्यतांबूले प्रदक्षिणविसर्जने॥

All these seem to have been explained by scholars.
