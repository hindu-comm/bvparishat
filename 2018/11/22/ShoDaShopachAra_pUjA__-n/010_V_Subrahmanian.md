The idea here is: We believe a certain devata resides in its abode, somewhere. So we do aavahana of the devata to our place and after puja we say: kshemaayaa punaraagamanaaya cha. So there is logic in avahana and visarjana. Even in pitru tarpana we do aavahana and at the end do 'yathaa-sthaanam pratiShThaapayaami.'

This is because they live in their own abode and only we call them here for our purpose. Even in shraaddha the brahmanas are given avahana and at the end visarjana.
