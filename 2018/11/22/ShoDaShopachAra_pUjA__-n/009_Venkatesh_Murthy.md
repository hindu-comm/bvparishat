Namaste

  

आवाहन is like inviting a Guest to our house. When you invite the Guest and serve him with hospitality food and other nice things will you say 'Now you can leave'? No. We never ask Guests to leave. They will leave wheneverthey want. Therefore there is no logical compensation forआवाहन. Butप्राणप्रतिष्ठा is different. We are filling Prana Shakti into the idol. Before we immerse the idol into water we must take out that Prana Shakti and return it to original place. This is returning to our own Prana Shakti. This is also showing Brahman is ultimately the Shakti for allप्राणप्रतिष्ठा. That Brahman is residing in our own heart. That is why we sayअहं ब्रह्मास्मि. We are worshipping Brahman residing in our own heart and also present in the idol afterप्राणप्रतिष्ठा.
