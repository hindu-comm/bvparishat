Namaste

  

In the following pdf of the Yajnavalkya smriti, the Mitakshara commentary is what is available from the beginning. The Ballambhatta commentary is not available from the beginning. It is inserted in the middle for the shlokas occurring there. Is there any edition that has the complete Ballambhatta commentary, right from the start of the Yajnavalkya smriti?

Thanks.
