Dear Scholars,

  

It gives me pleasure to place before this honoured forum,

Volume 4 of the Proceedings of the Swadeshi Indology Conference Series entitled

***Western Indology on*Rasa*: A*Pūrvapakṣa**

(Ed: Dr. K.S.Kannan

Pub: Infinity Foundation India, Chennai

Pp 284/ Price: Rs.175/)

  

This volume deals with the theory of*Rasa*,

the time-honoured Indian thesis that captures the quintessence of all art

\- but at the root of which Prof. Sheldon Pollock stoops to attempt to strike.

  

The volume contains over half a dozen articles mostly by young Indian scholars

that go to show the hollowness of the key arguments of Prof. Pollock.

The articles deal with not just the politics behind the polemics of the denigrators of the Rasa Theory,

but also the theoretical and practical issues involved in any serious consideration of the famed theory.

  

I may draw attention to one article that lays bare the pitiable inanity and incompetence of

a good many established Indologists in translating delicious and delicate Sanskrit verses,

and another that critiques in Sanskrit just the Introduction of Pollock's*Rasa Reader*.

  

As the editor, I have given (pp13-35) not only a synoptic view of *all* the papers,

but also a Sanskrit synopsis of the Sanskrit paper.

  

**Attached are the cover page and contents page ofthebook.**

  

Those who would like to purchase a soft copy (Kindle version)

of the book may do so from Amazon.

  

Even the hardcopy is priced low, and can be purchased from Amazon in India.

However, as the editor, I have a few copies of the book

which I can send free of cost to those who request for it.

  

Those in India who require a free copy of the book may

please send their address to me by a separate mail (so as not to spam the group).

(And they are requested to please acknowledge the receipt of the book when they get it).
