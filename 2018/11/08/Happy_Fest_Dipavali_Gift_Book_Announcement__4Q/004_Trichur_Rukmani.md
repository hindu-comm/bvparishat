Dear Kannan,

You have been very kind by sending me the earlier volumes. Please send me this one as well.Thank you.

By the way I have some Sanskrit books which I do not use any more. I will be very glad if you think you can use them. You can come some day and look at them and take them if you want them. I would be happy if some one like you can use them.

om
