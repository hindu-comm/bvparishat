Some of the readers made (four) enquiries about this volume on Rasa :

\- about the book (Advance Praise by some scholars)

\- about the nature of the contents (as some of the authors are not renowned),

 (hence the two Volume Editorials giving an overview of the papers),

\- about the authors cited/commented upon, and

\- about the ISBN Number..

  

**1.** The book has two volume editorials

\- **one in Sanskrit**(slightly improved than shown earlier)

**4. Advance Praise for the work :**

*Padmavibhushana Prof. R. Nagaswamy*

(Former Director of Archeology, Govt. of Tamilnadu; Expert of world renown in archeology, epigraphy, temple culture and history)

Infinity Foundation India is making this great nation rediscover itself. What is being done now is what should have been done much earlier, and that is in the area of Swadeshi Indology. The only prayer that is lived for the past 5000 years of history is on the tongue of every Indian who says "give me critical intellect" - *dhiyo yo nah pracodayat* - and that is being resurrected.

  

*Dr. Pappu Venugopala Rao D. Litt*

(Scholar, Poet, Musicologist, Sanskritist, Ashtavadhani, Author and Dance Theoretician)

I find 3 different kinds of scholars today. Scholars who quote text out of contet... Scholars who learn from our traditional scholars here and translate that into English and attack the same gurus who taught them. And there is the third variety of scholars - who never read the original texts, read some second-hand or third-hand translations, come back from Western point of view and criticize us without ever reading originals. This is the background of many of today's scholars. This myopic view must be set right. *Yādŗsībhāvanāyasya siddhirbhavati tādŗsī*.

  

The books will be sent in about a week or so.

Therefore, **those in India** who may want to get a **free copy** of the book

may write to me by separate mail.

(No need for those who requested a few days ago for a copy of Vol 4 to repeat their request).

Pl. provide the address to which the book needs to be sent.

(Some have asked for the book **without sending their address!**)
