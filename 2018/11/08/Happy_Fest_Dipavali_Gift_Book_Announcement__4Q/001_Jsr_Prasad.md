Dear Sir,

  

Some of our members were inquiring about these edited volumes. Congratulations to Infinity Foundation, you, and your team, as your hard work being materialized in the series of such valuable books.

  

Informing the same to forum using your excellent poetry skills is a nice gesture.

  

Regards,

Prasad
