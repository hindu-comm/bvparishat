Dear friends,

Happy Diwali.

In preparing for the India discovery seminar we hosted last Saturday,

I went through the text Bṛhatsamhitā by Varāhamihira.

It appears that he makes effort to compile all known physical,

chemical and astronomical information known at the time. It is a

comprehensive documentation of facts and engineering.

I enjoyed to note the documentation of deducing remote information

through simple terrestrial experiments and noted the documentation of

preparation of alloys, pastes and glues for engineering application.

He spends enormous effort in discussing astrology as a causal science.

Predicting a sky event through earth based visibility observations did

help produce ingenious mathematical techniques in algebra, trigonometry

and geometry. But connecting an astronomical event to the events on earth

also becomes an obsession.

One could make a scientific statement that all objects in the universe are

causally connected and that any activity anywhere could affect processes

elsewhere. Sky objects can be considered different because of their illumination..

While the Vedic scholars connected sky events to auspicious moments of hosting

events on earth, Varāhamihira tries to create a predictor of human conditions

and geophysical processes on earth. There is reason to believe that most of

these correlation connectors came to India from the Greeks via the Arab

traders.

Lately in editing some of the Conference papers from India, i see the "research"

on earthquakes with the applications of charts and correlations. This bothered

me and am writing this note. i would like to hear from our friends about the

thrust of astrology as a scientific predictor as practiced today. You may elaborate

any known rationale as appropriate. I am afraid that the practice and authentication

need analytic examination.

Please help.

Thank you.
