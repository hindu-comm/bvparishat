I should have stated. Varahamihira also talks about natural disasters like cyclone,

drought and earthquakes. Making correlations from the sky events need re-examination.

The British had instituted long term weather forecast in India on some regression

connecting the water in the Nile and the rate of elephant reproduction in Thailand.

While some empiricism is required where there is no physical data, my question

is whether people should tie their life and processes to empiricism.

The bible talks about astrology directly, the Ramayana does not.
Dasaratha is stuck

with some coronation timings, but timing is Vedic. It is not a connector to events.
