Respected scholars of vidvat parishad I request you to please give clarity to me. Being a civil services aspirant iam interested in the social issue of sabarimala verdict. I request you please clarify these doubts of mine. 1. Was Ayappa described in the puranic texts? If yes please provide the details along with chapter numbers and the purana. 2.Ayappa was worshipped in the GURUNATHA PONGALI VRATA by indian women. If it's allowed to worship ayyappa by women in vratas then when sabarimala can't allow worship. 3.There is an entry restricted by saying that the ayyappa being a naisthic brahmachari but I heard that in kaliyug it's not allowed to follow naisthic brahmacharya isn't it? 4. If he is a naisthic he should stay away from 8 forms of maithuna but in the saranu ghosa the devotees are saying PUSKALA sameta swami ye saranam ayyappa is a questionable one ! If the Lord worshipped as pushkala sameta and brahmachari a controversy may arise on his naisthica vrata. 5. The history says that a prince who find the way to sabarimala later disappeared in the forests with an interest to follow yogic path . It means that the naisthic and the Lord are different. If they are different then why this restriction on entry of women? 6. There exists a previous issue on the sabarimala in which MAKARA JYOTI described as the form of ayyappa with self lighting later turned to be a manual work and a fake publicity to attract tourists. In the same manner can't we doubt the present issue . 7.In tantra every one is allowed to worship but why women of gae between 10 and 50 are disallowed - any tantric texts saying such restrictions please provide them . Thank you
