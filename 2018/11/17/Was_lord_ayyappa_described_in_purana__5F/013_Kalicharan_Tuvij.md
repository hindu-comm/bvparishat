Namaste.

Sometimes a lack of documentation in Sanskrit texts (purana - par excellence) can be due to specific reasons also. Here are some speculative points (not so speculative if one believes in ancient Vaidika roots of South India, as I do)-

1\) Ayyappa's legacy (harmony of all knowledge systems). Surely troublesome for later sectarian traditions (that loved neat boundaries).  
2) A deity who was called hara by Shaivites, and hari by Vaishnavites, but later thus shunned by the orthodoxy.  
"hari-hara" nomenclature proved rather more, not less, obnoxious.  
3) If this deity is seen as nearer to a Lord Vishnu phenomenon, then it connects the following dots -

3.1) Explains extraordinary following of bhakta-s. Also explains why the temple is under constant attack - a similarity evidenced vis-a-vis rAma and kriSNa mandir-s.  
3.2) Can be scientifically understood as Vishnu's avatarNa in "Laxmi's mode". This results in -  
3.2.1) The "avatAra" not seeing the need to marry.  
3.2.2) The deity manifesting more as a guru character (sastha, or dakshinamurthy like) than in the more usual rakshasa-slayer one.  
3.3) Also fills in the conspicuous gap between rAma and kriSNa avatAra-s in the list of ten pramukha avatAra-s. This gap is otherwise deliberately filled with Buddha or Balarama.  
3.4) Why was Sri Parshurama involved with this deity's life (we know it from sketchy accounts available to us)?

The main point, however, I want to make here is that we simply don't understand what is going on, what is at stake here, and what troubles (of ancient roots, really) are brewing in our combined subconscious.
