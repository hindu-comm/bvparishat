// 6. There exists a previous issue on the sabarimala in which MAKARA JYOTI described as the form of ayyappa with self lighting later turned to be a manual work and a fake publicity to attract tourists  
  
----- 'Fake' is a false allegation. It has been time and again clarified that Makara jyothi and Makaravilakku are two different concepts. //  
  
  
I am stating my personal observation here. Before the makara jyothi (or whatever name they had for it) was admitted to be man made, a lot of Ayyappa devotees used to claim that it was a divine light that appears in the hills. A fire lit due to a tribal celebration, was portrayed as a divine event among the general public and by media.
