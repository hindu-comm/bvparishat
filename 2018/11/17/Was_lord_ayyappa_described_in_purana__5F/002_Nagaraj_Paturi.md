1\. Was Ayappa described in the puranic texts? If yes please provide the details along with chapter numbers and the purana.

  

------ There are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of kshetras that do not find mention in any puranas. Mention or no mention in the puranas does not affect the devotion of the pilgrims to those places.   

  

  

. 2.Ayappa was worshipped in the GURUNATHA PONGALI VRATA by indian women. If it's allowed to worship ayyappa by women in vratas then when sabarimala can't allow worship.  

  

GURUNATHA PONGALI VRATAhas nothing essentially to do with Ayyappa. My family has the vrata as the family custom. It is always a family custom. Not all families have it. In my family we treat it as Dakshina Murty worship. There could be family customs that are related to Ayyappa worship. I never heard from any GURUNATHA PONGALI VRATAfollowing family any association with Ayyappa.

  

3.There is an entry restricted by saying that the ayyappa being a naisthic brahmachari but I heard that in kaliyug it's not allowed to follow naisthic brahmacharya isn't it?

  

-- I do not know from where you heard. From wherever you heard, did the source tell you deities in Kaliyuga can not have naishThika brahmacharya or conditions in kaliyuga are not generally conducive for humans to follow naishThika brahmacharya?  

  

4. If he is a naisthic he should stay away from 8 forms of maithuna but in the saranu ghosa the devotees are saying PUSKALA sameta swami ye saranam ayyappa is a questionable one ! If the Lord worshipped as pushkala sameta and brahmachari a controversy may arise on his naisthica vrata.

  

-- A similar question I heard from a TV channel anchor in a mocking tone about Kartikeya. Similar questions can be raised about Hanuman and other devata forms. This is just an indication of how baffling 'Hinduism' is to those who do not have the deligence and patience of grasping the intricacy of the insider perspectives of a culture suspending their 'rational' learning. Kamakshi and Meenakshi are one and at the same time different. Viswanatha of one temple is different from Jambukeswara of another temple but they are the same Siva. Karthikeya with Valli and Devasena is different from Brahmachari Karthikeya. Balasubrahmania is different from Subrahmania. But they are all one and the same Karthikeya. " wives' /consorts of Devatas are allegorical to use a modern/English parlance.

  

5\. The history says that a prince who find the way to sabarimala later disappeared in the forests with an interest to follow yogic path . It means that the naisthic and the Lord are different. If they are different then why this restriction on entry of women?

  

The expression " history says" sounds like Veda says. Veda says is a 'religious ' expression. Those who say 'history says' consider themselves to be non-religious or even anti-religious and scientific. 'Women entry' issue is not related to 'history' (which 'says' ). It is based on the non-historical sacred narratives in which those who believe in the restriction believe. Two kinds of narratives can not be mixed.
  

  

6. There exists a previous issue on the sabarimala in which MAKARA JYOTI described as the form of ayyappa with self lighting later turned to be a manual work and a fake publicity to attract tourists

  

----- 'Fake' is a false allegation. It has been time and again clarified that Makara jyothi and Makaravilakku are two different concepts. Makaravilakku is the word that refers to the shine of the Sun on the makarasankramaNa day/moment. Makarajyothi is the word that refers to the fire lit by the tribals as part of their celebration of the makarasankramaNa (whatever is their local name/view of that seasonal phenomenon. )Fire being lit during the makarasankramaNa festival is part of the customs of the festival in different parts of India.
