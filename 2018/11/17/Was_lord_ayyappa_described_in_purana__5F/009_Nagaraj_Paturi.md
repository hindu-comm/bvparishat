\> Paturiji, the question and the answer are addressing different points. The question was whether Ayyappa was mentioned in any of the puranas. The answer talks about kshetras. Yes, all kshetras are not mentioned, but that is not the question. The question does not concern about kshetras, on the face of it. You could have said - Ayyappa is considered as Sastha who has been mentioned in brahmanda purana...

  

--------- My answer was a methodological one.

  

It is a question whether it is reasonable to raise such questions in such cases.

  

Bhootanathopaakhyaana of Brahmanda Purana being related to Ayyappa is now being brought into discussions.

  

The point is, the question of the autonomy of the local traditions, the validity or lack of validity of such traditions being dependant on their mention in written texts.

  

Currently our traditions are turning into victims of textualism.

  

Details found in texts even if not found in reality are falsely alleged to be found in reality.

  

Lack of documentation of orally transmitted texts/ideas/thoughts is used to invalidate them.

  

Both these are consequences of the methodological flaw of what I call Textualism.
