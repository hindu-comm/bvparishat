Nagaraj Paturi  
//1. Was Ayappa described in the puranic texts? If yes please provide the details along with chapter numbers and the purana.  
  
------ There are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of kshetras that do not find mention in any puranas. Mention or no mention in the puranas does not affect the devotion of the pilgrims to those places. //  
  
  
Paturiji, the question and the answer are addressing different points. The question was whether Ayyappa was mentioned in any of the puranas. The answer talks about kshetras. Yes, all kshetras are not mentioned, but that is not the question. The question does not concern about kshetras, on the face of it. You could have said - Ayyappa is considered as Sastha who has been mentioned in brahmanda purana...
