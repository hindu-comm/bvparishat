Dear Dr.Dhaval, The collection and its organization at Archives is user freindly. I could serach under the subject groups for manuscripts of my interest. I find your collection has manuscripts of Vayu, Matsya, Vishnu and several other puranas that are being discussed in another thread. On Vedas and Jyotisha also there are many interesting mss that are to be read carefully. An advantage is that the mss are in Devanagari and hence accessible to non-specialists for browsing to decide whether or not to download. The collection has Gargasamhita which is not Vrddhagarga-jyotisha or -samhita that I was looking for. In case you come across the Vrddhagarga manuscript kindly keep me posted. Hearty congratulations on makinga large body of primary sources accessible to interested Sanskrit researchers.

Regards

RN Iyengar
