Firstly, praying won't help to save Sanskrit.

Secondly, the media today is highly unreliable. Don't just accept what is out ....There is no doubt that Sanskrit is given step motherly treatment in its own land but using such headlines" Dying" etc is non sense.

Thirdly, the moment everyone starts thinking of its revival in full swing, no one can stop then. Each one of us can do our bit to propagate it.

We have to first believe that we will not believe media always, then what steps can be taken by each one of us to.propagate it?

I have started learning Sanskrit at the Age of 40. My kids of age 7 yrs and 13 yrs started today.

There is always a hope. Pls start learning and teaching. It will come back with venegence again.

Read books by Shri Rajiv Malhotra Ji about "Battle for Sanskrit" ,.....you will be inspired how one man single handedly fought for it ...get inspired and trash negativety.

  

Dhanywaad.
