You are right,madam.

  

Whatever appears in the newspapers is not absolutely correct.It is coloured as per the convenience of the owner and his/her partial inclination.

  

Every body has to play a positive role for the revival of Sanskrit as per his/her capacity.

  

Best luck in this arduous task.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
