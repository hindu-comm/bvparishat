Why Sanskrit schools are dying in the land where itâ€™s an official language \| India News - Times of India <https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-sanskrit-schools-are-dying-in-the-land-where-its-an-official-language/articleshow/66662621.cms>

  

Sorry to share this news here. But want to spread it. I strongly pray to flourish Sanskrit institutions and get again the glory of the language and many students can get opportunity to learn Sanskrit.

It is painful to know about the condition, contrast to this, Western countries are showing much interest in Sanskrit and schools are actively teaching Sanskrit.

Excuse me BVP if anything wrong in my writing.

Thanks and regards

Dr. L. Sreelatha.
