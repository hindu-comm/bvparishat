Subbuji,

  

The Bhagavata Mahatmyas from Padma and Skanda Puranas are not included in other volumes except vol 12 which has a different Mahatmya from Skanda Purana.  

  

Another feature of this edition is the **adhyayartha samgraha slokas** (one verse containing the essence of each chapter of the skandha) given in the beginning of each skandhas. The name of its author is not given.  

  

regards  
shankara
