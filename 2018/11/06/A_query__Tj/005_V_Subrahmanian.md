Shankara ji,

  

I think one more special feature of this edition is: It includes the 'Bhagavata maahaatmya' contained in the Padma and Skanda Puranam. I saw this in the contents portion of the first volume. I guess the other skandha-s too have this appendage.

  

Thanks for mentioning this invaluable edition here.

  

regards
