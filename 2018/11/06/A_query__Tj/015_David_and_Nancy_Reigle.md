Dear Shankara-ji,

  

Thank you very much for the information about this Tirupati edition of the Srimad Bhagavata Purana and the links to it. I only knew of (and have) the B. J. Institute critical edition prepared from manuscripts. It is possible that volumes 3 and 11 of the Tirupati edition have not yet been published, according to this library catalogue link:

<http://melvyl.worldcat.org/title/srimadbhagavatamahapuranam/oclc/24093445&referer=brief_results>  

  

The links given for vol. 11 are actually to other scans of vol. 10. Yes, as you said, it would be good if any member of the BVP has soft copies of volumes 4 and 5 that could be shared. Any information about whether volumes 3 and 11 have yet been published would also be helpful. Thanks.  

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle
