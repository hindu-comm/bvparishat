I happen to have the excellent book referred to by Mr Aklujkar. It is not only a wonderful short version of the original story but also a very valuable aid to learning Sanskrit. Please find below the screen shot of the first page of the book.

  

I bought the book several years back from Jayalakshmi Indological Books, Mylapore, Chennai. It should be available with them even now.

  

Regards,

Venkat
