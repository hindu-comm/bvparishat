As I recall, the late Prof. V. Raghavan prepared a short version of the Mahābhārata main story, in which a literal English translation of the core verses appears under the verses. It is published in pocket-book size. It is ideal also for those who wish to develop their reading ability in Sanskrit.  
  
My guess is that, for most members of this forum, retellings like those of R. K. Narayana or transcreations like those of P. Lal would be less than rewarding and, at places, even misleading.  
  
Someone from the Sanskrit Education Society, Madras/Chennai may be able to lend greater precision to the above information.
