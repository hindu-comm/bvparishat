P. Lal says the following in the beginning of the preface to his translation of the condensed version of MB.

  

"There are many condensed versions in English of the Mahabharata of Vyasa (the Bibliography at the end of this volume lists them all), but the only one that can be called a translation is Dr V. Raghavan's rendering which, by shortening the 100,000-shloka epic to about 2,000 shlokas, is microscopic in its compression. My aim has been to re-tell the story of the Kurukshetra war at greater length but always in V)[d.sa](http://d.sa)'s own words, without simplifying, interpreting, or elaborating. I have selected only such ihlokas as formed a continuous narrative, leaving out the large clutch of sub-stories, legends, peripheral digressions and other tangential material that is fascinating by itself but not absolutely relevant to the tale of the Kaurava-Pandava conflict."
