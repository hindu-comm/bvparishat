Dear Prof. Nagraj,

  

I hope you have had a good start to the week. My name is Sumant and I am a member of the BVP Group. You added me to the Group after I attended the excellent talk on the Mahabharata by Prof. Vishwa Adluri and Prof. Joydeep Bagchi at The Daspalla, Hyderabad, and requested to be kept informed of such talks in the future. I work as an equities trader and am based out of Hyderabad.

  

I write-in to you regarding the recent thread on the Mahabharata on the Group. Prof. V. Raghavan's book, "*The Mahabharata : Condensed in the poet's own words*" was mentioned quite a few times in that thread and the ever-resourceful Shankara ji even provided a link to the soft copy of the book.

  

Further to this, I looked up Prof. Ragahavan's book online and came across his Centre (<http://www.drvraghavancentre.com/index.html>), and the contact of his illustrious daughter, Ms. Nandini Ramani (marked in this mail) :

I contacted Ms. Nandini and she was most kind to let me purchase the book, which she couriered across to me. I received the book yesterday (Monday, 26th November). I have attached a few pics of the book with this mail.  

  

I requested Ms. Nandini if I could let you know about the availability of the book for purchase for members of BVP / others who might be interested, and she has most kindly offered her consent. She has also sent me a WhatsApp message regarding other books available that members of the Group might be interested in and also 3 other books that are mentioned in her message that haven't yet been added to the list. I shall forward you that message and the list of books available in separate mail.

  

Thank you for your stalwart leadership of the BVP Group, Prof. Nagraj, and my congratulations and very best wishes for all your endeavours at the Indic Academy.

  

With best regards,

Sumant.
