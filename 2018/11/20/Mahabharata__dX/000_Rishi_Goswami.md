Haraye Namah

Namaskara Vidvajjana.

I had a book request to make. In English translations of the Mahabharata, most sat KMG and BORI are authentic.

So I suggested a person to read any of them. But he seems to ask some concise version of Mahabharata. But I don't know any authentic concise version in English. He doesn't know how to read Hindi properly even though he can speak Hindi as his mother-tongue.  
I feel many people are like him, who are interested in Sanskrit Epics but can't read or understand complex Sanskritized Hindi.

Please suggest me a concise version of Mahabharata in English which is authentic.

Regards  
Rishi.
