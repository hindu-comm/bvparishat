Sri Nagaraj Sir

  

What you said on Dharma Baddha Daampatya is very interesting. We can even now see old couples become like best friends to each other. In this relationship the Rati element has become replaced by Sneha or Maitri. Husband and wife are supporting each other in mutual friendship. In this friendship if there is a common desire to follow Dharma it becomes really a very great relationship. My elders used to tell us the relationship between husband and wife matures from a physical relationship to spiritual relationship with age. This is absolutely a fantastic discovery.
