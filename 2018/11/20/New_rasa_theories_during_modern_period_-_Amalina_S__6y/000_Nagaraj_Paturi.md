Namaste Sri Nagaraj Sir

  

Thank you for the interesting message. I have a question.

  

Very interesting is the Amalina Sringara Rasa. Is it like 'Platonic Love' ? It is non-sexual.

  

I found some info -<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love>

Nagaraj's response:

  

Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy-ji,

  

As you were able to see in the Wikipedia page the idea of platonic love itself is believed to have undergone a transformation

  

If we avoid, all those complications and take only the following working definition,

  

"Platonic love in its modern popular sense is an affectionate relationship into which the sexual element does not enter, especially in cases where one might easily assume otherwise."^([\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love#cite_note-9))  

  

Yes, Sri Rayaprolu Subba Rao garu's Amalina S'ringara has similarities to Platonic love in some aspects.

  

Because of such similarities, there were intense discussions in Telugu literary criticism with regard to this question of similarity between the two.

  

It has been found/ realised that what is called as Platonic Love forms a part of what is covered by Amalina S'ringaara.

  

Amalina S'ringaara covers dharma baddha daampatya S'ringaara too. Even in this case, sthaayee bhaava is not the conventional Rati which gradually turned out to be essentially sexual love. Even for daampatya s'ringaara as part of amalina s'ringaara, sneha is sthaayee bhaava.

  

Another interesting aspect of this theory is that the theoriser Sri Rayaprolu Subba Rao connects it to his Sri Vidyaa.
