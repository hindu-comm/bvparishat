The whole Indology process has been to see India as the third person.

For people of Indian descent, the process is either first or second.

An Indologist understands a text through translation, a person of

Indian descent absorbs the information by hearing!

The translated texts have made a literature of their own and are then read

by people in descent to learn about their own culture! This is history.  

BVP helps in providing an empowerment of this weakened population!

I admire the zeal and enthusiasm of many who keep the knowledge dissemination

in this forum. We explore knowledge. We don't read canned translations!

Rajiv had coined the phrase "open architecture". I love it!
