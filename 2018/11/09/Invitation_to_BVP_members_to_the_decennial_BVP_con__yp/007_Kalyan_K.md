Already, the invitation on the Indology list has received negative comments from one Walter Slaje. The gentleman in question selectively gives some quotes from BVP to show the "ideological" direction which "things" are taking at present. (Here, I am struggling to remember what ideology I hold). He either forgets or is wilfully ignorant of the fact that members here represent diverse viewpoints and we are in general not blindly anti-non-Indian. Nor is every member here a scholar (example: myself). It appears that for people like Walter, swadeshi is a bad word which needs to be looked down upon with all the condescension that it deserves. Too bad for Walter, the days of colonialism are long gone.
