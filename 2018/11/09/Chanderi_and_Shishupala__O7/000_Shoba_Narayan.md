Namaste:

  

I was researching the origin of Chanderi sarees and came across this mention. I was wondering if this has any merit.

  

"Chanderi is known to have its origin back in the Vedic Period, and is believed to have founded by Lord Krishnaâ€™s cousin, Shishupal."  

  

Thank you for your time and explanations.
