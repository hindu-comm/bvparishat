In our tradition face towards east is must during pujanam of devatas, while offering tarpanam to pitar devata face preferred to south, same time sacred thread also being changed from left to right shoulder, we call thisसव्यम् नीवितम् अपसव्यम् I think south north middle India have little variation but overall the purpose of the shraadhdham is same
