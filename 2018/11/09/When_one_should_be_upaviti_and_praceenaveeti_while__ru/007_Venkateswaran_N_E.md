Namaste.  
  
During shraddham the general rule is that all activities for vishvedeva and Mahavishnu should be in upaviiti and all activities for pitru should be done in prachiinAviiti.  
  
Note : All the points below are as per Apastamba pArvaNa shraddha prayoga.  
  
The following are the exceptions when the karta should be in upaviiti in a shraddham :  
1. Offering Asanam for bhoktas  
2. While doing pAdaprakshAlanam (washing the feet) of all bhoktas, vishvedeva, pitru and Mahavishnu.  
3. Agnimukham - setting up agni  
4. While doing aupasana just before Shraddha homam  
5. While keeping paridhi and AgAra samit, (agni parishechanam should be in prachiinAviiti and anti-clockwise direction)  
6. Brahma varaNam (but Ajya samskaram and darvi samskaram should be in prachiinAviiti)  
7. prAyaschitta homa  
8. svishtakRt homa  
9. During abhishravaNa recital, when food is being served.  
10. While calling the crows after offering vAyasa piNDa  
11. Namaskaram  
12. Pradikshnam  
13. During AshirvAdam  
14. While following the bhoktas when they depart  
15. Giving dakshina to Acharya and person who did abhishravaNa. (dakshina - both bhukta dakshina before eating, and final tripti dakshina to pitru-sthana bhoktas should be in prachiinAviiti only)  
  
The pramana should be available in works like smRti muktAphalam (aka vaidyanatha diikshitiiyam)  

  
"While doing gnataagyaada homam , the last one after 2 riks each for pitr,ptiamha and prapitamaha, 2 sets of annam in one stroke and 2 aajyam but you should do some gymnastics of putting your hands in between the yajnopaveeta while holding the anna in left hand...that is highly confusing"  
..."  
  

Regarding your above statement, the following procedure applies :  
  
After 2 ahutis (rice and ghee) each, for pitru, pitAmaha and prapitAmaha,  
next comes one ahuti to ज्ञाताज्ञात pitrus.  
  
The process is same as for the earlier ahutis.  
1. PrachiinAviiti  
2. Keep big darvi on left hand; holding the small darvi on the right hand, take some ghee and pour into the big darvi.  
3. keep small darvi down, take one pinch of cooked rice (caru) from the middle of the plate with your right hand and put it into big darvi  
4. Take another pinch of caru from the east side of the plate and place it in the big darvi. (For kartas who have 5 pravara rishis, eg. srivatsa gotra, they have to do the above step third time picking the caru from north side of the plate)  
5. While still holding the big darvi in your left hand, wash your right hand with the prokshani water, then take ghee with right hand in small darvi, and pour into the big darvi.  
6. Keep the small darvi down, transfer the big darvi into your right hand, touch the caru plate with your left hand, offer the caru into the agni, with the appropriate mantras.  
  
Even though the procedure might look cumbersome, if you understand these simple rules, it'll all be clear.  
  
1. While filling the big darvi, it should not be kept down, hence kept in left hand  
2. Offerings should be taken only with right hand, never with left. Hence take ghee in small darvi and caru with your right hand only.  
3. After touching cooked items one should wash hands before touching ajya, samit etc  
4. Ahutis into agni should always be with right hand, hence you transfer the big darvi into your right hand.  
  
Now coming to the ahuti to ज्ञाताज्ञात pitrus :  
The procedure is same as the above, upto Step 5.  
  
Then comes extra Step 5b.  
As this is the last ahuti with caru (rest of the homam is with ajya only), we purify the leftover caru in the plate, with one more offering of ajya using small darvi, but this has to be done with upaviiti.  
  
Then step 6 - prachiinAviiti, then, transferring the big darvi to your right hand for offering the ahuti into agni for ज्ञाताज्ञात pitrus.  
  
Performing this extra ajya abhigAra from small darvi to caru plate with your right hand while your left hand had the big darvi with caru, and changing from prachiinAviiti to upaviiti and back to prachiinAviiti looks like a bit of gymnastics.
