That s a common rule.. Thanks.

How about for maha vishnu....?

How one should do upachara for viswe deva & for pitrus , I mean which direction?

How about aajya samskaram, brahma aavahanam, pradakshina namaskaram, aseervadam, abhisravana patanam, svishta kruta homam, sapatate agne... , upasthanam, paridhyanjana lepa kaaryam etc?

While doinggnataagyaada homam , the last one after 2 riks each for pitr,ptiamha and prapitamaha, 2 sets of annam in one stroke and 2 aajyam but you should do some gymnastics of putting your hands in between the yajnopaveeta while holding the anna in left hand...that is highly confusing...
