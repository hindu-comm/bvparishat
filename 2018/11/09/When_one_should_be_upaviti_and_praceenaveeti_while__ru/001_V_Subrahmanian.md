One can consult a good purohitar for this. They perform shraaddham day in and day out. On several occasions the yajnopavita wearing change takes place. One common observation is: when offering anything to vishvedeva brahmana, it is in upaviti. When it is to the pitru sthaana brahmana, it is prachinaviti.
