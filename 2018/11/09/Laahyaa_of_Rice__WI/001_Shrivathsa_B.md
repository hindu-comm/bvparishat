It is a yaj\~niiya dravya. I am sure it has some Ayurvedic RRitucaryaa significance because it is used at about the same time across bhaarata.

  

In the kaartikapuurNimaa celebrated in daxiNa bhaarata the same puffed rice is used for making prasaada. It is called "malar" in tamizh, "bhattada araLu / araLu" in kannaDa. It is got when whole rice seed (paddy) is heated in heated sand.

  

The same is made on the spot in a yaj\~na and pounded and made into puroDaasha.
