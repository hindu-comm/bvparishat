Dear Researcher,

  

You may profitably refer to the different volumes of the History of Dharmashastra by M.M P.V.Kane.

  

You may go consult different volumes of the New Catalogus Catalogue for information about commentaries on various works.

  

Best luck in your search and research.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
