I do not think they will be collecting any fee for this. I guess so because the newspaper report says that some 6000 people are estimated to attend the event. It is likely that they have a system of issuing passes for those who want to attend and one will have to contact the organizers. Please check the newspaper report once again and/or make an google search. //Shri Nakoda Parshwanath Shwetambar Mandir Trust in Bengaluru..//
