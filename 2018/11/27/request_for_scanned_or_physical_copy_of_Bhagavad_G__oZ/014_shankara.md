Namaste,

  

I have uploaded a scan of 'Bhagavad Gita with Brahmanandagiri vyakhya of Venkatanatha' to [archive.org](http://archive.org). The scan was prepared from an old photocopy of the book.

Link to an article on Venkatanatha, the author of the commentary in 'The Preceptors of Advaita'.

shankara
