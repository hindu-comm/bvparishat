A request to all members who are pursuing this topic of 'Annambhatta...' verse. The header of the thread is: // **request for scanned or physical copy of "Bhagavad Gita : with the commentary BrahmaÌ‚nandagiri of Sri Venkatanatha"//** and a discussion not pertaining to this thread is going on under this header. When we see the header in our inbox, we think that someone is responding to the request about the Venkatanatha commentary. But when the mail is opened, a different post is there. With this in mind I have changed the header for the 'annambhatta' discussion.

  

Thanks.
