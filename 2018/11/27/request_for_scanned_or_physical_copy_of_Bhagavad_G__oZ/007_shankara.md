Divyaji,

  

Thanks for the info. I checked CIF website, but could not find any update on the encyclopedia. Anyway, I don't need searchable electronic text and already have a photocopy of the commentary, though I would be glad to get a scan of the 1912/13 edition of the book.  

  

regards  
shankara
