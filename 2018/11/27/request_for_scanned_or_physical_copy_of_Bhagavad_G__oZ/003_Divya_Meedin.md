Namaste Anish-ji and Shankara-ji,

  

According to <https://www.chinfo.org/index.php/easy-sanskrit-course/8-chinfo/60-academic-plans>, there was a proposal a few years ago by the Chinmaya International Foundation to compile an electronic encyclopedia of the Bhagavad Gita also containingBrahmananda Giri of Venkatanatha.

  

I couldn't find out if the actual project has been completed. Perhaps, you may contact them to find out.  

  

Regards,

Divya
