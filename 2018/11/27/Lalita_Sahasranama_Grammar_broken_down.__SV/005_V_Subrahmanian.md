Shankara ji,

  

How about the Soubhagyabhaskara of Bhaskararaya makhin? Here is a sample. Here too we see vigraha vakyas given most of the times. As an aside, the study of this commentary will give a lot of insights into many puranas, tantra texts, whose authenticity, comparison, etc. can be a research effort by itself. Quite interestingly there is a mention of the shaariraka bhashya, Brahma sutra bhashya. Which commentary has mentioned the 'other two'?
