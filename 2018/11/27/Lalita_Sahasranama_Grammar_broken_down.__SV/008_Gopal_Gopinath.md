Hari om, vivekji,

  

Until now I have not seen such a work on LS or LT. Such a detailed analysis I have come across with samskrita bharsti's gitapravesha multivolume course materials recently and in some work on ramayana a long time back. I may be wrong and would like to be corrected. Like shankaraji and subbuji mentioned, reverse engineering the grammar based on detailed meaning should be possible and an exercise in contemplation. Maybe, SB's Gita pravesha could map out a method to do that based on Gita slokas and one can \*\*\* try \*\*\* to apply that to each naama. Please correct me if I am wrong,
