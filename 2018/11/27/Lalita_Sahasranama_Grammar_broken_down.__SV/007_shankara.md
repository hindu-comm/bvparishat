Subbuji,

  

I quoted from Chandrika commentary merely because it was easily available to me at the time. I didn't mean to compare it with Saubhagyabhaskara.

  

Of all the LSN Sanskrit commentaries avaialble to us, the ideal commentary for beginners seems to be 'Balatapa' published along with Saubhagyabhaskara from Sampurnananda University. Balatapa, true to its name, is a short commentary that gives only the vigrahavakya of the names.  

  

Larger commentaries like Saubhagyabhaskara, Jayamangala and Chandrika provide detailed explainations. A beginner in Sanskrit might find it difficult to identify padachcheda from these commentaries.

  

In the case of 'Sudhasagaramadhyastha', Chandrika commentary also quotes the same Brahmasutrabhashya passage. Both commentaries are almost identical for this mantra.

shankara
