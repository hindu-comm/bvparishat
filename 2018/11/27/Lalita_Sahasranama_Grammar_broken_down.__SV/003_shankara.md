Namaste,

  

None of the available commentaries on LSN in English provide Padachcheda ('breaking down each name'). Usually Sanskrit commentaries give vigrahavakya of each name. For example, the vigrahavakya for मलयाचलवासिनी (457th name) is मलयाचले तदाख्यशैले वसतीति तथा in Chandrika commentary of Vaidyanatha Dikshita. From the vigrahavakya we can understand the padachcheda as well as the purport of the name.  

  

Some LSN commentaries in regional languages have word-by-word meanings of long mantras. If you know Malayalam, Kandiyur Mahadeva Sastri's commentary will be helpful to you. Similar commentaries would be there in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and other languages.
