He has clarified in a later message that he wanted to know whether व्यायामि is used in the meaning"व्यायामं करोमि".

  

"व्यायाम इति पदस्य वि+आङ्+यम्+घञ् इति व्युत्पादनं पश्यता मया "व्यायामि" इति पदेन "व्यायामं करोमि" इत्यविवक्षिषि"

  

Without seeing this Prof. Kannan deliberated व्यायम् depending on earlier explanations on his earlier request. He himself was not sure about what to ask.

  

According to his later clarification,"व्यायामं करोमि" he had to use णिच् "तत् करोति तदाचष्टे" and resultant verb form would have been व्यायामयामि and not"व्यायामि" as suggested by him. As suggested by Narayana Prasad it would be from या गतिप्रापणयोः"व्या+या+मि".
