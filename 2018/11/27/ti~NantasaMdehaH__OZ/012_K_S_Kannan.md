As clarified/confirmed by Subramanian,

the *vivaks"A,* right from the beginning, obviously was *kartrabhiprAyaka-kriyAphala*.

Hence my suggestion - that *vyAyacche* is the right word - stands vindicated.

  

(I guess the construction*vivaks"A**vivRNItA*of Subramanian

 needs to be changed to*vivaks"A**vivRtA*).

  

I could not grasp what Prof. Bhat meant,

but I guess he noticed that I provided the correction in two stages.

I first wanted to show that *yAmi* was not possible from Root*yam*,

and thought that this was *enough clue* for the questioner to work on it.

  

When neither the questioner nor any other member

(including Narayan Prasad-ji who gave an important comment,

nor others who commented *subsequent to* *my clarification* that*vyAyacche* is the form required)

carried it to its logical conclusion,

I then took the next step of showing that

the possible wrong deduction of *vyAyacchAmi (*from**my initial suggestion of *yam>yacchati)*

must also be categorically ruled out.

  

*vyAyAma* in the senses of *kalaha/yuddha/vipratipatti* is also attested,

(in the *vaidika* as well as *laukika* usages) in which all cases,

Root *vyAyam* is invariably Atmane only.

The epic usage cited is also to the same effect.

  

In the light of the famous usage supplied by Narayan Prasad-ji,

which shows the validity and normalcy of the usage of *kAvyam karomi*,

(though in the words of a "layman"), and despite the fact that*kavayAmi*

(available in the same verse and in the same sense) is also equally possible/natural,

(and used by the same "layman"), I would not think that *vyAyAmam karomi* is an odd/unhappy construction.

  

Of course, such usages are not very welcome if used as a repeating pattern,

and so regularly used in lieu of *tin'anta* forms.

The criterion of "elegant variation" as a mark of sound diction

ought to be deployed by diligent users.

  

The possibility of the Parasmai usage was hinted at by me in the statement viz.

"(But if you choose a*nAma-dhAtu*form, things can be different.)".

  

While the grammarians' verdict is *s'irodhArya (*as it must surely have some basis in usage),

I am not aware of any attestation in literature of

*grantham vyAyacchAmi/vyAyacche*,

and would be thankful to anyone who can indicate such attestation.
