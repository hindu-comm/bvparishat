Hi All,

  

I have downloaded Pullela Sri Ramachandrudi gari Valmiki Ramayanam which gives sanskrit shloka and corresponding pratipadartha-thatparya-vyakhyana in Telugu from this page.

  

<https://archive.org/details/VRPullela12356>  

  

In the Balakanda, pages numbered 3 and 4 are missing in the scanned copy (which cover shlokas 2 and 3). Can someone who has this book, kindly take a scan or picture of these two pages from your mobile and send it across.

If you can point me to the soft copy of Balakanda, that also will help. I couldn't find it any where on the net except the above page. Hence the request.

  

Dhanyavadah,

Subrahmanyam
