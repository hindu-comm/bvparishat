**Shrimad Rajchandra**(11 November 1867 – 9 April 1901) was a[Jain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism "Jainism")poet, mystic, philosopher, scholar and reformer. Born near[Morbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbi "Morbi"), he was a prodigy and **claimed to have recollection of his past lives at the age of seven. He performed*Avadhāna*, a memory retention and recollection test that gained him popularity, but he later discouraged it in favour of his spiritual pursuits**.. He wrote a large number of philosophical poetry including*[Atma Siddhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atma_Siddhi "Atma Siddhi")*. He also wrote a large number of letters and commentaries and translated some religious texts. He is best known for his teachings on Jainism and his **spiritual guidance to[Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi "Mahatma Gandhi")**. \[…\]



[*Avadhāna*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avadhanam "Avadhanam")is a difficult **test of attention and recollection in which a person attends multiple objects and activities at a time**. In 1884, Rajchandra came from Vavania to Morbi where he saw Shastri Shankarlal M. Bhatt performing eight*Avadhāna*at a time. Gattulalji Maharaj was performing the same in[Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay "Bombay"). He saw the performance and quickly picked it up. **Just two days after the performance, he performed it in front of his friends and later in public**. Initially he performed 12*Avadhāna*in public in[Morbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbi "Morbi")but later he performed 16*Avadhāna*in audience of two thousand in[Wadhwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadhwan "Wadhwan"), which was praised in newspapers. He performed 52*Avadhāna*in[Botad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botad "Botad")in a private meeting with his friend Harilal Shivalal Sheth which included playing*[Chopat](https://en..wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopat "Chopat")*game with three players; playing cards with three players; playing chess; keeping count of the sound of a small gong; mentally computing arithmetic sums involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (4); keeping count of the movement of beads along a thread; solving eight new problems; **composing verses on eight diverse topics selected at the time and in the specific[metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry) "Metre (poetry)")chosen by various members of the audience** (16); rearranging 400 words of various languages spoken in random order including Greek, English, Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, Latin, Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Maru, Jadeji, in the right order of subject, predicate (16); teaching a student; contemplating various figures of speech (2); all at one time. He performed*śatāvadhāna*(100*Avadhāna*) at Sir Framji Cowasji Institute in Bombay on 22 January 1887, which gained him praise and publicity. He was awarded gold medals by institutes and public for his performances as well as title of ‘Sakshat[Saraswati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati "Saraswati")’ (Incarnation of the Goddess of Knowledge). Rajchandra believed that **the publicity gained by such*Avadhāna*s may became an obstacle in spiritual pursuits, so he gradually discouraged the performances and stopped it completely by age of 20**. The performances attracted wide coverage in national newspapers.In September 1893, **when in Chicago,[Virchand Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virchand_Gandhi "Virchand Gandhi")mentioned this feat at the[Parliament of the World's Religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_World%27s_Religions "Parliament of the World's Religions")**.



[Shrimad Rajchandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimad_Rajchandra), Wikipedia



Several Jain Avadhanis **displayed the art of Avadhanam in front of Mughal emperors and their[Subahdars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subahdar "Subahdar")(governors)**. Nandivijay, a disciple of the monk Vijayasen Suri, performed the Ashtavadhana in front of[Akbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar "Akbar"). Akbar was very impressed with the art and conferred the title of*Khushfahm*(one of a brilliant intellect) on Nandivijay.Siddhichandra, a disciple of the monk[Hiravijaya Suri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiravijaya "Hiravijaya"), performed the Shatavadhana in front of Akbar where he performed 108 simultaneous tasks testing his miraculous memory. Akbar conferred the title of*Khushfahm*on Siddhichandra as well. Siddhichandra **stayed in the Mughal court till the last days of[Jahangir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangir "Jahangir")**. Yashovijay Suri, the author of the work*Jain Tarka Bhasha*, performed several Avadhanams at Ahmedabad in the 17th century, including 18 Avadhanams **in the presence of Mohabat Khan, who was the Subahdar of Gujarat under[Aurangzeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb "Aurangzeb")**. \[…\]

Friends,



Though the influence of Jainism on Mahatma Gandhi’s advocacy of ‘non-violence’ (*ahiṁsā*) in mass political movements is well known, few are aware that had it not been for the epistolary advice of his trusted counselor Shrimad Rajchandra, the Hindu Gandhi-ji would have converted to either Christianity or Islam while in South Africa. I make it a point to take visitors to Chicago, sometimes directly from O’Hare airport, to the Jain temple (which is also the organizational center of their North American diaspora) and show them the large basement shrine to jeweler Rajchandra. What I have only just learned about, however, is the strong tradition of Jain *avadhāni*s to which he too belonged. What better way to convince those skeptical of the powers (*siddhi*) conferred by the ascetic practice of *yoga*, than a public display of such ‘superhuman’ feats of concentrated intellectual retention and agility. Note that these Indic religious savants were hosted and patronized by Muslim rulers even under Aurangzeb!



As I have shown in my work on the ‘great brahmin’ jester of the classical theater, the genre of the ‘riddle play’ (*vīthī*) that had its ritual roots in the Vedic enigma-combats (*brahmodya*) was transposed onto the vernacular (*prākṛt*) for entertainment. Though this Sanskrit literary cuture pervaded and inspired all of India’s regional traditions based on their distinct languages (including Gujarati, etc.), it has, for sociohistorical circumstances that remain to be fully clarified, blossomed especially in Telugu. Virtuosos, such as Medasani Mohan, to whom we had the privilege of listening yesterday, draw upon their oral mastery of traditional (religious) lore to improvise spontaneously in (humorous) response even to contemporary (trick) questions relating to the most profane trivia. What better proof could we ask for (pace TM Krishna) that the classical Indian arts were never divorced from popular culture, nor hemmed in by religious sectarianism or linguistic register, but constituted a perennial unifying backbone.



Enjoy!
