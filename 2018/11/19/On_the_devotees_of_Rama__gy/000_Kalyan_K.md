Namaste  
  
(I am not sure whether this question is appropriate for this list, so I leave it to the moderator's judgment on whether to post it or not.)  
  
I have noticed that among my acquaintances, those who are devotees of Rama (I am excluding Vishnu, Krishna and other incarnations) in particular, tend to face a lot of challenging problems in life. Among people known to me, who are sincere devotees of Rama, one person lost her young son, another was left by her husband and had to bring up her 3 children as a single parent, another had sons who developed complicated health problems at an early age and yet another had children with congenital defects. Add to this the story of Bhadrachalam Ramadasu, an ardent devotee of Rama, who spent about 12 years in prison. (Even in the Ramayana, Rama, Sita, Lakshmana themselves had unhappy lives. Dasaratha died an unhappy man, Kausalya was unhappy at the banishment of her son, Bharata too was unhappy. Wondering who among Rama's aides really had a happy life).  
  
All this leaves me wondering whether devotees of Rama are more prone to facing particularly challenging problems in life. I understand that we should look at things statistically and these cases may not be representative, but still I cannot eradicate this feeling of mine. Members may kindly comment on this.
