Dear Dr Aravinda Rao garu,

  

The concept of Dharma Veera Rasa is indeed interesting.

  

Aalankaarikas identified more such sub varieties of Veera such as Dayaa Veera, Daana Veera, Yuddha Veera, Tapo Veera etc. What is popularly understood as Veera is Yuddha Veera as per this sub classification.

  

You might want to read "Number of Rasas" by Prof. V. Raghavan available at

  

<https://archive.org/details/TheNumberOfRasas>

  

for more details.

  

(Incidentally , yesterday while responding to this thread, I just finished my visit, let me say pilgrimage, to Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute which is the Alma Mater of Prof. V Raghavan.)

  

--------------------------------------------------------

  

It is not Abhinavagupta who says Dharma Veera is the Angi Rasa of Ramayana.

  

It is my guru Prof. G V Subrahmanyam who made that proposal.

  

What Abhinava Gupta says is that Dharma Veera is a kind of S'aanta Rasa only. This he does in Abhinava Bharati not Lochana. The context for this discussion is his elaborate argumentation to establish S'aanta's eligibility to be a Rasa. He refutes the arguments that S'aanta need not be an independent Rasa because the central emotions of what is called as S'aanta are just utsaahas (utsaaha is the sthaayee bhaava of Veera) of Daana Veera or Dharma Veera. He argues that Daana Veera, Dharma Veera etc. can be viewed as sub varieties of S'aanta not the other way round.

  

Well accepted position among scholars about Angi Rasa in Ramaayana is that it is S'anta Rasa. It is out of respect for the highly venerated Anandavardhana Acharya. (There are also views that Angi Rasa in Ramayana is Karuna Rasa )

  

Because of that well established nature of the position among scholars that S'anta is the Angi Rasa of both Ramayana and Mahabharata, my teacher had to face a highly stiff resistance to his proposal that Dharma Veera is the Angi Rasa of the two epics.

  

He had to argue in what can be called as modern versions of Vaakyaartha sabhaas to debate with scholars in various fora to defend his proposal. One such sabhaa in Nellore declared him victorious in his vaada.

  

( Those in the west, some in India too who have a blinded understanding of Alankara studies in modern India should know all these developments in modern India to get to know that allankaarika vaadas did not, as these blinded observers consider, stop with pre-modern period and newer and newer theories , arguments etc. have been forwarded by modern Indian scholars too. There is a proposal of a new variety of S'ringaara Rasa called Amalina S'ringaara rasa with Sneha as sthaayee bhaava by Sri Rayaprolu Subba Rao garu, the great harbinger of 'modern' poetry in the form of 'romantic' poetry in Telugu. But that is for another day. But the point is the simplistic, frog in the well understanding in theories such as " Death of Sanskrit")

  

I attempted to bring a compromise between the two sides, my guru and his prativaadins, by reminding them that from a certain understanding, in certain aspects, as per Abhinavagupta Dharma Veera is not different from S'anta Rasa .

  

My guru Prof. G V Subrahmanyam went to the extent of propsing that " Dharmaveera eva rasaanaam rasah" on the lines of Bhija's "S'ringaara eva rasaanaam rasah"

  

Thanks for reminding me all this.
