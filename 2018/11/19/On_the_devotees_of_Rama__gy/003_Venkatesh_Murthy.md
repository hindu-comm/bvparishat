Namaste

  

The difficulties of devotees of Rama are so great they cannot even build a nice temple in His birthplace. Therefore I am devoted to Lord Venkateshwara. He is divorced from His wives but He is getting all the money. In human life a man has to pay alimony to his ex wife after divorce. Just trying to make a humorous remark.
