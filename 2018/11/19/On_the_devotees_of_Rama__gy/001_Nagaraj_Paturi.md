Sri Kalyan-ji,

  

This is an uncharacteristic post from you.

  

Usually you try to be rational and logical in your posts.

  

This one reflects the other side, the not rational , not logical side of your thoughts.

  

The pattern of difficulties in life for the characters in itihaasas and puranas need not be limited to the naayaka and naayaka side characters of Ramayana. Even the naayaka side characters of Mahabharata have the same pattern of difficulties throughout their lives.

  

People for generations looked at this feature in both the most popular epics of India as the depiction of perseverance as an ideal in the naayaka side characters. This perseverance is what is viewed as heroic in the naayaka side characters rather than their heroics in the form victory in the fight with the pratinaayaka. Abhinavagupta uses the word Dharma veera in reference to this kind of heroism in dharmadeekshaa. My guru theorised that dharma veera is the angi rasa (central rasa) of these epics. (Ananda vardhana says S'aanta is the angi rasa. Abhinavagupta , at some point, says S'aanta is the same as Dharma veera. )

  

Rest, linking difficulties of 'devotees' with the 'deity' of their 'devotion' etc. are the modes of thinking which are results of viewing and evaluating deities in terms of the perceived trend of misfortunes of individuals or attributing the misfortunes (only) not the other side aspects of life to the deity.
