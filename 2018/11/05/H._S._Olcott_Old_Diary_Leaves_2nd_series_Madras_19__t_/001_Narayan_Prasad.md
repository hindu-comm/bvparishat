Namaste.

  

Actually this book has been referred by:

De Silva K.M. (1981): A History of Srilanka; p.340.

in connection with the debate between Christians and Buddhists that took place in August 1873 in Ceylon. The Buddhist party was victorious.

  

The summary of discussion has been presented by Ivan Minayev in his "Sketches of Ceylon and India" (1878), pp.49-57.

  

The reference under the subject is mentioned in "A History of Srilanka" for details about the Buddhist monk Gunananda (1823-1890) presented by his contemporary H.S. Olcott (1832-1907).

  

After a long search on the net, I came to know that there were three editions of the above book - published in 1900, 1928 and 1958.

II\. Old diary leaves : the only authentic history of The Theosophical Society by Henry Steel Olcott. - London ; Madras : Theosophical Publishing Society ; Theosophist Office, 1900, 1928, 1954. - (Old Diary Leaves ; Second Series, 1878-83).

When I could not trace the 1928 edition, I tried for the first edition and I could find it.

<http://blavatskyarchives.com/theosophypdfs/olcott_old_diary_leaves_volume_2_1900.pdf>  

  

I found the detailed passage related to Gunananda on the same page 157, which is mentioned for the 1928 edition.

Col. Olcott describes Gunananda thus: 'the terror of the missionaries . . . more wrangler than ascetic ... the boldest, most brilliant and most powerful champion of Sinhalese Buddhism ... the leader of the present revival'.
