The search for the book ( requested by Dr Iyengar) gave me also much knowledge on the history of Indian Maths.

Now that you too found the refs interesting, I have taken the liberty to share what other things I skuimmed:

===============================================

1)A popular writing on Sulba Sutras:

[https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/017/09/0884-0894](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/017/09/0884-0894)

  

=========================================================================

2) What made "Vedic Mathematics" evolve:

  

<https://www.mum.edu/mathematics/maharishi-vedic-mathematics/>

  

(topics from this link are about *what is needed for Maths -- Intutition* (which was abundant in Bharatha Varsha, Bharatha Khanda/Looks like "" Intutiton / 'Cosciousness' in Maths" is a hot topic for Reasearch)

  

<https://www.mum.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gorini_frontier91594.pdf>  

  

Search for "Geometry at Work by Gorini" on Googe books. or Click

<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Eb6uSLa2k6IC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false>  

  

In this collection of invited papers, two simple papers on Geoemetry in "Vedic Civilization" -- Sulba Sutras, is completely readable on-line".

==================================================================

3) For more exploration on the History of Indian Maths:

  

On <http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Indexes/Indians.html>, one can see "Articles on Indian Mathematics".  Select the 5th topic to see another gem.

  

On<http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/Pearce/index.html> a History on all topics of Indian Maths (including Vedic, Jain, Kerala Maths).

  

Some Historians had understood contributions and prowess of Real Vedic Maths ; which some other Math Historians had attempted to smear. See below::

  

"......The first translation of the manuscript was carried out by **G R Kaye, however he was quite unscrupulous** in his work and attempted to date the manuscript as 12^(th)Century **in order to justify Arabic and Greek influences on the text**. Kaye even went as far as to **question the Indian origin of the manuscript.******

However the vast majority of his translation and suggestions made about the origins of the manuscript **have been debunked by less biased (and more accurate) translations.** G Joseph further criticises Kaye and comments:

> *...It is particularly unfortunate that Kaye is still quoted as an > authority on Indian mathematics.*\[GJ, Ps 215-216\]..." >
> I think I should stop here ..........
