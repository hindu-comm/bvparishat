Dear colleagues and students  

  

Shri Rajiv Malhotra ji is giving a talk on the "Future of Indic Studies" at 11am in our school. The talkwill focus on India's contributions to the west in S&T and future prospects in the field. Dr Sanjay Mishra from Dept of Science & Technology (DST, Govt of India) will be the chair.

  

The details are as follows -

  

Speaker - Shri Rajiv Malhotra

President, Infinity Foundation, Honorary Professor, Center of Media Studies, SSS, JNU

Topic - Future of Indic Studies

Chair - Dr. Sanjay Mishra, Advisor/Scientist G, DST, Govt of India

Date - 6/11/2018

Time - 11 am

Venue - Conference room, School of Sanskrit and Indic Studies

  

*Abstract*: This talk will first summarize Indian contributions to one specific Western scientific discipline. These are well documented and acknowledged in the West, but have not been organized into a systematic body of knowledge in the *History of Science*. Worse still, this influence is barely taught in India. Then the talk will discuss some of the frontiers of scientific & technological research that can revolutionize the future of humanity. These research pursuits can be seen as "moon shots", meaning high risk and very high impact areas. The speaker will address: How do Indic traditions relate to these issues and how could we contribute to them? Are these threats or opportunities for us, or both? Are Indian researchers going to participate constructively, or become consumers of Western discoveries?  

  

Tea & snacks (and special chocolates for Diwali) will be served

  

All are welcome
