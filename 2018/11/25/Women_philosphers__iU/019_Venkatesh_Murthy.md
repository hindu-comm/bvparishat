Namaste

  

It is true Adi Sankara has said in the beginning of Vivekachudamani 'Jantunam Narajanma Durlabhamatah Pumstvam Tato Viprataa'. I heard one commentary saying Masculinity is preferred

but this Masculinity should be mental. Some women like Gargi, Jhansi Lakshmi Bai showed they are more masculine than modern men. Many men like Ravana and

Duryodhana showed they are mentally weak and feminine because they are slaves to passion and arrogance.
