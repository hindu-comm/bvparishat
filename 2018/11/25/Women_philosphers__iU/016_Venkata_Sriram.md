Namaste,

  

We have many philosophers, poets across India from other languages too ! Unfortunately, some didn't come to limelight due to lack of patronisation, recongnisation from local rulers / kings etc. Their greatness lied in balancing of household activities, serving in-laws, husband, guests and at the same time engaging in philosophical studies.

  

In Andhra, among many, we have Molla (the author of famous Molla Ramayana) and Tarigonda Vengamaamba, the great yogini and bhakta of Tirumala Venkataramana. Their contributions to telugu literature is amazing....but the poor ladies bore the brunt of then-existing social customs and ire of village heads.

  

Presently, I can recall Ms.Pushpa Dikshit whose contribution to sanskrit literature is amazing and carved out a niche for herself with 'paushpi-paddhati'.

  

My pranams to such Mothers !

  

rgs,

sriram
