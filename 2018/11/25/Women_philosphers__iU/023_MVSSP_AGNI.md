Respected scholars , 1.what is meant by philosophy here? Is it only the astika darsana part or all darsanas or excluding tantric darshan or includes the tantric darshan and other vaidik and avaidik vidyaas too. If philosophy includes tantric darshan too we know about the BHAIRAVI BRAHMANI who taught tantric vidyas to rama krishna paramahamsa. 2. I heard in a pravachan of maha sahasravadhani sri GARIKAPATI Narasimha rao that there exists a women who is a housewife has told a vyakhyana of vedanta . She belongs to Raja mahendram of Andhra Pradesh but I don't remember her name.  3.Maithreyi who is a wife of Yagnavalkya got brahma vidya I don't know her contribution later on??? 4. Devahuti the mother of kapila even got it by maharshi kapila . 5. There are some women in the yoga vashistha achieved brahmi sthiti. I remember only one or two the stories there the first one is the mother of maharaja Alarka and there is another women who helped his husband in achieving brahmi sthithi too. By these I got a new question Is contribution means only a written work these works done by women are counted or not ? Respected scholars please clarify. Thank you.
