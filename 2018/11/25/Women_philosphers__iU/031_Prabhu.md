From the book “Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts” by Pandit Parameshvara Aithal Curator, Adyar Library  
  
Kalyanadevi: She was the sister of Trivikramapanditacarya (a.d. 1258-1330) and is said to have remained unmarried. The Laghuvdyustuti (3104) is traditionally ascribed to her. (See B. N. K. Sharma, A History of the Dvaita School of Vedanta and Its Literature, vol. I, p. 280.) But in the printed edition of this Stotra {Stotramahodadhi, pp. 249-50) the name is given as Kalyanadeva. If the tradition ascribing the Stotra to her is correct, this is the sole case of a Stotra by a woman author found in the Library. In the Stotramahjari (p. 473) her name is given as Kalyanidevi which seems to be more appropriate.
