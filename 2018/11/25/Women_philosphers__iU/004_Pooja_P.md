Since I hail from Karnataka I am aware of Akkamahadevi, but my question was of a different nature.

  

We all know how complementary - roles of the genders have been in our ancient civilization (Which example better than Vachaspati Mishra and his devoted wife Bhamati?). The point of my post was that the title itself is erroneous and misleading - philosophy itself deals with shedding of the concept of gender and such silliness and going beyond - as our phillosophers have shown. Then the point of a "woman philosopher" and a "man philosopher" is a fanciful oxymoronic language construct meant to be highlighted anddissolved appropriately.
