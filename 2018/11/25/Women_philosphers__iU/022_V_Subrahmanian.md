//The brightest star in the sky of Advaita Vedanta is the 18th century woman sage Avudai Akkal of Tamil Nadu, henceforth referred to as Akka, who used the mode of song to expound Vedantic philosophy to women in general, and Brahmin widows in particular, having personally experienced the oppression and humiliation to which they were subjected. The brilliant metaphorical play in her compositions weaves together the two fundamental requirements for the practice of Vedanta: viveka, discrimination between the Real and the unreal, using systematic self-inquiry as a methodological tool; and vairagya, dispassion or withdrawal from all things one is familiar with and attaches to (house, family, progeny, property, possessions, work domain, identity, community etc.).//
