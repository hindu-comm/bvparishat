The Tamil literary history records the name of Kaarikkaal Ammaiyaar:

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaikkal_Ammaiyar>

  

**Karaikal Ammaiyar**(meaning "the revered mother from[Karaikkal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaikal "Karaikal")"), one of the three women amongst the 63[Nayanmars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayanmar "Nayanmar"), is one of the greatest figures of early[Tamil literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_literature "Tamil literature"). She was born at[Karaikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaikal "Karaikal"),[South India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India "South India"), and probably lived during the 6th century. She was a devotee of[Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva "Shiva").^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaikkal_Ammaiyar#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaikkal_Ammaiyar#cite_note-2))

  

I have heard of a Tamil woman Advaitin who lived in an earlier century who has composed some Vedantic poems. I do not remember the name and details.
