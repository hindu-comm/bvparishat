Long time ago, (possibly tthirty years), a church affiliated with a reputed Indologist from Harvard

invited me to give a lecture on "Women characters in Indian Epics".

Those days were the beginning of the feminist movement and Cambridge was an activity center.

There was wide spread media perception that Indian society had to be characterized by women

exploitation and women subjugation.

I took the invitation with a scholarly interest and thought to study Ramayana to understand the

issue.

As I read, it gradually appeared to me the story was written around Sita's character. It was she

who was found, it was she who had the wedding, it was she who was determined to move out

with Rama, it was she who counseled Rama on nonviolence, it was she who was abducted,

it was she who paved the path of recovery by dropping her ornaments, it was she defended herself  

all alone and it was she who left the earth with her dignity.  

To me Ramayana was Sita's story. Rama was reacting, not acting anywhere.  

I still do not know what prompted Valmiki to compile the story. It is a tribute to the women, their

poise, diligence and conviction. I would think all knowledge rests in women though they may

not write it as men do!
