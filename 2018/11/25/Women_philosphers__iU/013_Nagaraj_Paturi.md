Is the content of the debate between Yajnavalkya and Gargi philosophical or not?

  

Aren't texts ( BrihadaaraNyaka Upanishad etc.,) mentioning her 'philosophical' debates very ancient or not?

  

How can a person participate in a debate without taking a position? If one is taking a position, can't that be called her philosophy?

  

Isn't Gargi menioned as the Rishi /mantradrashTa of Veda mantras or not?

  

Aren't mantradraShTas philosophers?
