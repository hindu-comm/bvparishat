Two of them are:

  

### Princess Hemalekha

Hemalekha(mentioned in Tripura Rahasya) was Guru to her husband (Prince Hemachuda), her Mother-in-law and many others. She slowly and beautifully takes her worldly husband on the path of Brahma Gyan. Such was her power that in time the entire city was full of Brahma Gyanis, where even the parrots spoke of renunciation and Gyan.

### Queen Chudala

QueenChudala(mentioned in Yoga Vasistha) became Guru to her Husband, King Sikhidhwaj. She attained Brahma Gyan soon after instructions from scholars. Her story is detailed in Yoga Vasistha.
