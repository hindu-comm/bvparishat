Is Basava a philosopher in his own right? Akkamahadevi is similar, independent of him. She is a philosopher in her own right. Particularly the gender aspects of her argument would not have come into existence but for her.

  

Do we consider AaLvaars as philosophers who have contributed to Vaishnava bhakti philosophy ? aaNDaal is one of such philosophers alongside the aaLvaars.
