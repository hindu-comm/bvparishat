Despite these articles and the information about Sita is true, these point out the fact that these women were respected and treated as equals in Bharata. It shows their acceptance in an elite group.

  

But what were their contributions? Can any of the scholars of philosophy point out? Which woman has "actually" made any tangible individual contribution to philosophy? Forget the vedic period, even beginning with Shankaracharya to the latest stalwarts like Radhakrishnan and M.Hiriyanna, which woman philosopher can we boast of? I think such articles are well proof of our hallowed past yes, but of a rarified one in terms of actual content.

  

So, let's not kid ourselves. I have been taught about Vachaknavi Gargi since my school days. But what is her contribution? I know of Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhwacharya and Abhinavaguptapadacharya's contributions. I know about Radhakrishnan's works and have enjoyed reading Hiryanna. I love Yajnavalkya's Ishopanishad. But what \*is\* Brahmavadini Gargi's contribution? It is clear that they were knowledgeable, but no extant quantitative information is available - Whether their contributions were meagre or was it forgotten in the flood of time - who is to say!

  

Please forgive a neophyte for this haughtiness, but facts speak for themselves while emotions do not.
