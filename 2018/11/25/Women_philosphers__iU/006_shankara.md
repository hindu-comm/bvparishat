Namaste,

  

This is a subject that deserves to be studied deeply before we reach a conclusion. It would not be fair to say that women philosophers have not contributed at all to philosophy, especially in India. A name that I can cite now is of Kamakshi Amma (1852-1920), who wrote original works as well as commentaries on Advaita and Nyaya works.  

  

The following are her works that are available to us.  

  

1) [Advaitadipika](https://archive.org/details/Acc.No.6382Advaitadeepika1910)  
2) Srutiratnaprakasa tippani  

3) Srutimatodyota tippani  

4) [Nyayabodhini Nilakanthiya Vishayamala](https://archive.org/details/NyayaBodhiniNeelakantheeyaVishyaMalaByKamakshiAmmaKamakshiAmma)  

  

There is also Pranamanjari who wrote [Sudarsana commentary on Tantrarajatantra](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.283802), that was edited and published JB Choudhury in 'Contribution of Women to Sanskrit literature' 7 volumes set.
