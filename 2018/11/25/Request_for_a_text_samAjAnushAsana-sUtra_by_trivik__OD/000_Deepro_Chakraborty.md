Namaskāraḥ,

  

I found a reference to the following book in NCC (vol. 38. p. 1) and also in the [Sanskrit Books Catalogue of India Office Library (Vol. II, Part I, Section IV, p. 2262)](https://archive.org/stream/IndiaOffice_CatalogueOfSanskritBooks/Nath%20and%20Chaudhuri_Catalogue%20India%20Office%20Sanskrit%20Books%20S-Z_1957#mode/2up):  
  
Samājānuśāsana-sūtra by Trivikramatīrtha Svāmin, Varṇāśrama-viveka-sūtra-sametam.

Śrītrivikramatīrtha-svāmi-caraṇaiḥ saṃgrathitam. pp. 62. 17X11 cm.

KarnatakPrinting Press, Bombay \[1922\].

  

I don't find this book even on [www.worldcat.org](http://www.worldcat.org)

  

Can anyone share a copy of this book?

  

Regards,

Deepro
