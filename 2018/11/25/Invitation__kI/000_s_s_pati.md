Respected Scholar/Researcher,

Greetings and Namaste from Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth! It gives us great pleasure to invite you for the next edition of our International Conference ‘New Frontiers in Sanskrit and Indic Knowledge’ (NFSI), to be held next month, from 17^(th) to 19^(th) December 2018.

The NFSI conference was started with the aim of setting a new agenda for research in the fields of Sanskrit language and grammar, traditional Indian philosophy and literature, and other related disciplines. We hope it can provide a platform where thought leaders, academicians and student researchers in these domains can engage in constructive debate and discussion.

This year’s conference, NFSI-2018, is titled ‘Śastra and Discipline – Towards a Meaningful Dialogue’. True to this theme, our focus this year will be on exploring the idea of a śāstra as a knowledge discipline which defines the practices of each tradition and school of thought. We invite you to participate in this discourse and help contribute to research in this area.

We have attached a soft copy of the brochure giving further details of the conference. You may register for the conference online by following this link:

Sincere regards,

NFSI-2018 Programme Committee
