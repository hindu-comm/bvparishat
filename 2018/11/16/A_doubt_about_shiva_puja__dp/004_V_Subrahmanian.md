I do not think this should be a problem. Each person involved will get the phalam destined for him as per his sankalpa and bhaavana. Take the instance of many people simultaneously having the darshana of a Temple vigraha and doing stotra individually. They might be doing different chants but all these are directed at the same deity. Each person will get the phalam as per his bhavana. The Archaka will also get the phalam if he too performs his job with bhakti.
