Particularly i noticed this practice in telugu people.

Despite of the size the lingam.... One sadhaka doing abhishekam another one doing neerajanam, the other is giving nivedana upacharams to the same lingam is kind of weird to me.

This is happening only with siva linga pujas i.e. multiple pujas at a time.

So I am curious to know this practice should have a pramanam for doing so.
