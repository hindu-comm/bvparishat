A puja kriyaa is a combined exercise when the situation demands. For example when Ekaadashavaara Rudra japa is involved, there may be two or three or six or eleven persons involved in the japa part of it. The sankalpa itself says: 'anyonyasahayena....' 

  

If the Lingam is small, household, only one person will do the abhisheka. If it is a huge temple lingam, more persons will pour water or milk simultaneously on the lingam.

Thus there is no limit on the number of persons doing the abhishekam or archana. Sometimes, the purohita who officiates asks the grahastha, a dampati, to do the abhisheka and archana together. See attached video for Thanjavur Brihadeeswara Abhisheka.
