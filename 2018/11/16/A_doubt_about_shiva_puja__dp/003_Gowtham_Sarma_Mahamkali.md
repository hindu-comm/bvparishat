Thank you for your reply.

But 11 or more members doing archana and abhishekam with single sankalpam is fine and comes under "anyonya sahaya". What if 11 sadhakas doing rudra abhishekam to one lingam with single anyonya sahaya sankalpam and another sadhaka doing the same abhishekam with his own sankalpam to the same lingam. It's like doing 2 or more pojas of the same lingam. We see this all around. Is this ok or have any pramanam.?
