Great idea!

Those in charge of temples should build the tradition of having the tri-color in every temple. India is the centre of Hinduism. The nation and the religion would receive an identity if every temple has the tri-color. At the base of the tri-color there can be a small idol of Bharatmata. Those who worship other gods and goddesses should also worship Bharat Mata. Also, abhishekam should be done for Bharat Mata as for other gods and goddesses.
