\<\<There are not many good textbooks which purports to teach in the Ashtadhyayi method. The prathamāvṙtti while being authoritative is rather cryptic. It is meant to be used as a text by kids who are taught in the vyakarana bootcamps by a shastriji.>\>

  

It is the prathamāvṙtti that I used to study Astadhyayi as an adult learner without getting by heart the complete sutrapatha. LSK may supply all the anuvRttis, but a learner cannot understand from where they come all of a sudden, whereas the anuvRttis are quite obvious in the prathamāvṙtti. Had I used the**bhaimivyākhyā**and even if patiently read it to the end I would have learnt only about 1270 sutras out of about 4000. Instead of that using prathamāvṙtti, I learnt the whole of Astadhyayi within one year.

  

I tried to get by heart the sutrapatha and succeeded in mugging up a few chapters. This much also helped a lot. Please see my experience about this exercise inअष्टाध्यायी कंठस्थ कैसे करें ?

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
