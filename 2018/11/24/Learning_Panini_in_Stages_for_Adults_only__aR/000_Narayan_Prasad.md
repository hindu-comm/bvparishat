Learning Panini in Stages (for Adults only)



There are many people who want to learn/study Panini after their student life and getting occupied with some professions, but do not have time to attend classes. To such interested people, who do not have any guide in this regard, and who think it hard to directly go into the complete Astadhyayi in the initial stage, I would suggest the following stages in learning Panini.

Prerequisites:

(1) You must know at least one Indian language properly.

(2) You should have read at least some very basic Sanskrit texts, e.g. those prescribed for the CBSE students. If not, it is better to have first a look at them without bothering about Skt grammar.

(3) Keep with you some Skt texts along with commentary in a language that you know, such as, Hitopadesha, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Bhagvadgita, or texts of any other subjects in which you are interested (e.g. medicine, astronomy, astrology, yoga, etc). You should note down esp. the verb-forms encountered in these textbooks.

You may start with the Astadhyayi sutras covered in the following books, in stages, if you find it very difficult to directly study the Astadhyayi. **It must be kept in mind, however, that the meanings of the sutras are to be learnt in the Astadhyayi order, and not in the order of the prakriya works (as in the Kaumudi works), otherwise you will not understand anything without the help of teachers.** This I assert on the basis of my own experience.

BTW, I have contacted the administrator of the [website related to the Astadhyayi](http://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/) to include the sutras selected in these works.

The books are in the increasing order of the no. of sutras selected.



(1) TEMOLATS (संस्कृत पठन-पाठन की अनुभूत सरलतम विधि) (453 सूत्र)

(2) परम-लघु-सिद्धान्त-कौमुदी (467 सूत्र)

(3) सार-सिद्धान्त-कौमुदी (681 सूत्र + 32 वार्तिक)

(4) लघु-सिद्धान्त-कौमुदी (1270 सूत्र + 114 वार्तिक)

(5) अष्टाध्यायी-प्रकाशिका (about 1400 सूत्र)

OR संस्कृत पठन-पाठन की अनुभूत सरलतम विधि, Vol.2

(Total 1429 सूत्र including those of Vol.1)

(6) मध्य-सिद्धान्त-कौमुदी (2315 सूत्र)

BTW, I have not counted the exact number in the work (5) above. The book itself does not mention the exact number of sutras.

Those who can read Hindi, the **संस्कृत पठन-पाठन की अनुभूत सरलतम विधि in 2 vols are sufficient.** Thereafter, you may go straight away to study the Astadhyayi.



Best wishes
