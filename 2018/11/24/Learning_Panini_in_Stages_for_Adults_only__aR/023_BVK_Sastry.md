Namaste Narayana Prasad ji



1. Your interest in Samskruth studies is well appreciated.



2. The heart of the problem point is highlighted precisely by you in \< But if the syllabus itself does not cover it, what can be done?\> .
Beyond ' vishaada' ??



Who is responsible for promoting, guarding, implementing this truncated model of teaching 'traditional linguistics' and 'making
nation-society - schoalrly community and next generation' to be deprived of real language scholarship needed to properly deploy the ' samskara'? get a good grounding on cultural heritage of nation?



Is it an internal break down? deliberate ? Does it require an 'avataar to come and set right this defect? What seems to be preventing
the lovers of Samskruth to take action- invest -demand the right teaching of Panini ? Why distorted teaching and research is being tolerated ending only in lamenting for promotion of Sanskrit resurgence ?

I presume that illustrations are not needed to explain these points.



 Precisely the area to be reconstructed and restored is ' Panini- Muni-Traya Sampradaya' and fit this in to Samskruth language using professions. Bring out the VINIYOGA of YOGA-Samskrutham as given by Patanjali ( Viniyoga concept has come up for discussion several times on this forum; thanks to Dr.Yadu).



 We need to see what should be the 'pre-qualification standards ( yogyataa - adhikaara-saamarthya)' even to undertake a preliminary talk
to pass a line of observation and judgment on Panini, the first of
Muni-traya sampradaya. When this pre-qualification is not built in to syllabus and training, much less the practice, how may we be justified in making outpours on Panini? in oriental/ modern sanskrit academia.



 If we don't understand, If we have not been taught the right approach to decode Panini, does the fault-blame go to ' Panini-Patanjali- Kashikaa kaara / Bhattoji deekshita'? 

Yaska said -' Naisha sthanoraparaadhah, yedanm andho na pashyati it'.



***To see specific points ( as you invoked Ph.D, gurukula, ****अष्टाध्यायी (with sutrasकंठस्थ) and* *महाभाष्य**** , ****सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण (grammar) of* *भोजदेव**** **bhoja deva, ***:



1. Panini's framework is NOT a class room syllabus. So is the work of Bhoja deva.

2. Panini's work is a consolidation and continuation of a long standing vak-yoga tradition of Rig-Veda for ' Vision of Language (Vak)- Processes (Prakriyaa). So is the work of Bhoja deva for Aamkara- shaaastra presented as 'Rasa-Shaastra'.

3. Panini's work-focus and basics is NOT about ligature, font. 

Panini is First- Voice ( Shikhsaa , Uccharana). 

Current technologies of computing, computational linguistics architecture are no where closer to Panini's Voice First design for Communication.

4.Paninian rules are for 'Pada- nirmiti - nishkarsha' for uccharana and Vakya -prayoga. It was not designed for ' lipi-samketa- lekhana- roopa karana'.



5. The positioning of Vyakarana itself is limited in the frame of ' Pada-Shaastra (Word generation and validation)' and 'Vedanga- architecture' and specific benefits. 

When this happens, Vyakarana as 'Pada shaastra expands itself backdrop to Vakya shaastra, Pramana Shaastra'.

This is NOT the design of 'word Processors' or 'Semantic Web' or ' IoT, Big Data analysis'. AI and Expert systems come on the border lines towards Panini, but not sufficiently, as Samskruth-Cognitive science research background is lacking in these areas.



6. Vyakarana is built on the foundation of 'Shikshaa' ; the outcome ' pada' is passed on Vakya and Pramana Shaastra and ' Nirukta- Vedanga'. Nirukta and Kosha are not Thesaurus or lexicons of word-meaning equivalence for translation replacements using a table. The exercises of MT / NLP find a difficult terrain here with Panini.



7. The cross discipline connections are horizontally and vertically
integral and internal , with forward and backward compatibility.

'Pada' is specifically integral to 'Chandas' and Swara-shaastra.
For Bhashaa, the rules of ' Chandas' is appropriately scaled down. For Prakrits, a slackened rule set is given.



8. The goal of Vyakarana is to help right understanding of the ' vivakshita -bhaava in the pada' leading to 'Rasa-anubhava'.

In Sahitya , it is kaavya rasa; In Chandas, it is ' raso vai sah'- the parabrahma/ Shabda-Brahma.



 This is what Bhoja deva reiterates in the famous sutra ' rasa-bhava- nirantaram' explaining 'ahamtaa and shringara relations' in the context of ' advaita-bhaava'.

This aspect of ' Rasa-Bhaava- Yoga' is not sensitized in poetics teaching . That is seriously, a different story !



 'Literary critic and job of literary criticism as book/work review as an analyst' many times ends as listing of ' pada- vakya -bandha shareera of kavya' and illustrate how many alamkaaras in the work
following what rule criterion.

The standard of ' Kavya - Vyaakhyaa is set by Mallinatha; the sensitivities of Kavya- Vimarsha are seen in alamkaara shaastra lakshana samanvaya debates on distinguishing 'Rasa-dhvani'. Why is ' nishesha chyuta chandanam' debated so much or prakruth verse ' atta etta nimajjayi... ? Any ethical issue or erotic overtones ?





9. This architecture and design of teaching -practicing Panini Vyakarana was the hall mark of Gurukul education and training system. Modern academia has dismembered this 'head (Shira) ' of tradition and carrying the dissected body of literature split as ' Vedic' and Classical Sanskrit literature' using the framework provided by the indologists as ' Religion and Classical poetry'.

10. Getting back to the starting point now, \< But if the syllabus itself does not cover it, what can be done?>

What action should be the proposed for course correction? if what we were taught was a syllabus which messed the basics of the discipline ?
