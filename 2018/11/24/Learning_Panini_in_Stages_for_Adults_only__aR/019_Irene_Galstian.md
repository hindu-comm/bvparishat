Leṭ's then make an experiment. Let the list members who start with these books proceed with their best intentions. 3 months later, let's meet on this thread again and share honestly what has been accomplished.

Perhaps that would show that in a matter like Panini's work, finding a teacher, even online, and studying with this teacher, is by far quicker than going through this material alone. Not to mention that the presence of a reasonably experienced guide would save learners from incorrect derivations that seem correct because of exposure to a limited number of sutras and unfamiliarity with the overall structure of the Astadhyayi and its tricky parts.

The nature of the material is such that an experienced teacher is needed to teach beginners, otherwise it's like going against a tank with a plastic fork. Panini is vast. It's possible to get together without a teacher, talk and discuss, seemingly profitably - yet progress little, if at all.

If, on the other hand, what's required is to understand the derivations of grammatical forms, Kaumudi will give that, with much less suffering, and many excellent teachers have gone this route. I don't suggest for one moment that Kaumudi is easy, however.

Since we are on a forum with many Indian scholars as members, would it not make sense to respectfully ask teachers to make themselves known, then form small groups (even online is OK), and study with the teacher regularly?
