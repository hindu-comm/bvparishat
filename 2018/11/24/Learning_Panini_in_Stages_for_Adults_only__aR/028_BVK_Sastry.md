Namaste Deva Pattanayak



1. Thanks for your interest in exploring the structure of Paninian language, the Deva-Bhashaa.



2. There is total truth in the statement and position : \<the structure / architecture and structural process of generating Sanskrit word (Samskrutha-Pada Nirmiti/ Prayoga) by Paninian grammar standards, validated by Patanjali, has close relation to the brain functioning as ' Neuro-physiological base of Consciousness .



The unlocking of this code is part of Consciousness research titled Brain-initiative research programs in science.> .

Would there be a TEAM to support this as ' Yoga-Samskruth Initiative' for Yoga-Science Samskruth text decoding> ? - A question to ponder. Please write to me off line if this interests you.



The following links would show why, how and how much of contemporary
global interest with multiple benefits are there in researching in this area.

 Traditional texts of Shikshaa, Ayurveda and Mantra-Yoga shaastras have provided the road map for exploration, experience and experimentation on these points.



3. What seems to be missing is a clarity and exposition of these technicalities in the language and modalities of modern science and idiom, measure and models for Productization and deployment.



4. This situation is an outcome of several setbacks which have disrupted the Patanjali guidance to study 'Samskruth as language of Yoga (=Vak-yogah is vedic original name of language: Samskrutham).



The other distractions blocking this research progress are :



(a) Application of inappropriate pedagogy of using Socio-historic model of Language studies for study and analysis of Yoga-science technical language. This is called 'Romanization / colonial model of studying Panini. 



(b) Dismembered study of Paninian rule book for Samskrutham and limiting 'Sanskrit scholarship to ' Bhashaa' part and leaving out 'Chandas' part. This is called ' claim for excellence of language scholarship by partial study of 40% of rule base in the text and leaving out 60% of the rest, resulting in disconnected, disjointed understanding of ' muni-traya tradition of Samskrutham'. This in traditional terms means ' Samskruth studied as 'Sanskrit is not meeting the Vedangataa - Saangataa' standards for scholarship.



(c ) Modern Researchers unscientific exploration of traditional texts using inappropriate translations of works related to Yoga-Science texts of traditions:

 Like Ayurveda, Vastu, Jyotish. The disciplines which require the use ' entirety of Panini with clarity on technicality of language -generic ( by Vedangataa- Saangataa of Panini) and Discipline specific technicality of Vocabulary in each application science = ' Shaastra - Prayoga- Viniyoga-Paribhashaa' . This is called 'claim to exercise the academic research scholars freedom' to violate any norms of any and every kind in any traditional discipline and pass freewheeling observations.



5.I have written elaborately on this issue in some of my earlier posts explaining what is Vak-Yoga: The yoga way of studying Samskrutham:The language of Yoga. About translating this pedagogic principle to products i have some work done. Please write to me off line for sharing.. If you share a number to call, I will call you and we can have a better understanding.
