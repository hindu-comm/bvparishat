\<\<What is prathamāvṙtti?\>\>

  

The cover page of this book for Vol.1 is attached. Similarly, for Vol.2 (ch.4-5), Vol.3 (ch.6-8). The detailed commentary and notes are in Hindi.

This is the best book for beginners of Panini, beginners in the sense that cross-examples have not been dealt with. I am not aware of similar book in any other language better than this.

  

Best wishes

Narayan Prasad
