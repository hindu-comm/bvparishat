\<\< We may also add Laghu Paniniyam by Rajaraja Verma. With about 1700 sutras and written in simple Sanskrit with very clear concepts.>\>

  

Thank you very much Alok Kumar ji for the suggestion of this book that I came across for the first time. I had a look at it. It has 1775 sutras (not counting the additional serial number allotted to 4.1.76).

I find its presentation much better than any of the three shorter forms of the Kaumudi works(PLSK, LSK, MSK), even better than the SK that covers complete Astadhyayi.

BTW, has there been any reprint of the 1911 edition of this book?

I have already prepared the excel file of the sutra nos. covered in it. There are many printing mistakes. While sorting the sutra numbers in the Ast. order, many more mistakes were found. I have corrected whatever I could detect. Later this work also will be kept on the site [astadhyayi.com](http://astadhyayi.com) (hopefully by the next month).

Regards

Narayan Prasad
