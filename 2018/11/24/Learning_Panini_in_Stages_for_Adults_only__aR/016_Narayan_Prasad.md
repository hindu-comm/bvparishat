\<\< If truly one is short on time, finding a teacher is by far the most timesaving option.>\>  

  

Of course, if one finds a teacher nearby, a lot of time can be saved by his guidance. But the teacher himself must have studied Panini in the Astadhyayi order of sUtras.

  

What I aimed at was: if at all somebody wanted to study Panini with limited no. of important sutras (to be decided by the frequency of their use), say about 500, or 700, or 1400, or 2000, how to select such sUtras? Whatever be the books selected, these should be studied first in the Astadhyayi order and not in the Kaumudi order. After having studied the Astadhyayi first, one may use later any Kaumudi works, if one likes. The idea behind this is that one should fully understand the meaning of the sutras derived from the sutras themselves with all the anuvRttis taken intoaccount and this is impossible if one starts with any Kaumudi work.

  

If one likes about 1400 sUtras to be studied first, one can useअष्टाध्यायी-प्रकाशिका.
