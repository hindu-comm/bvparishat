Friends,

I wanted to ditto the statement by Sri Prasad:

**It must be kept in mind, however, that the meanings of the sutras are to be learnt in the Astadhyayi order, and not in the order of the prakriya works (as in the Kaumudi works), otherwise you will not understand anything without the help of teachers.**

Like many, I delved with grammar to deal with the texts. I banked on my earlier training and also picked up Kaumudi. A friend

and scholar suggested to study Ashtadhayi. Then we formed a small group and met three hours every week for about five years.

It is important not to bypass or to assume. The rigor of looking at each sound is important. In that sense, my adulthood and scientific

training helped.  

It can be a mammoth exercise, but you would be rewarded if you are curious and analytic in nature. Panini was a scientist of a very high order who ever walked on earth. While he creates a structure to speech, there are philosophical issues of what we convey when we speak

or the more fundamental question who speaks. I would encourage anyone with some scholarly mind, to deal with Panini to understand

and appreciate the basic principles of analysis. Be regular and commit yourself. (It would be easy to be sloppy!)  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
