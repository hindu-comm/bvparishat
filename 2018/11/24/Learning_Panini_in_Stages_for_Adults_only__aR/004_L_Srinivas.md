It's a great roadmap for the aspiring grammar student. The prerequisites have been carefully articulated. I love that. I've frequently seen MIT type elite institution grad students crowd the free online Panini classes. Most have hardly read any Sanskrit prior to that. But they want to learn vyakarana because they have heard that it is computer science.

  

However I do have two problems with the study guide outlined by Shri Prasad. I feel it doesnt address aspects of student's motivation and correct learning.

  

1\. Self learning student's motivation flags frequently unless he/she sees the utility of his/her study. This will happen if he learns sutra after sutra especially in the first two adhyayas.

2\. A good textbook should be read. A self learner can not just learn using the sūtra and the vṙtti. He will mislearn, badly learn, stop learning etc

  

Also, praising the ashtadhyayi sequenced works as opposed to the kaumudi sequence is a chestnut of the Arya Samajis. This has most recently been articulated rather forcefully, if not vehemently, in the Introduction to the prathamāvṙtti. For nearly 300 years, the whole Sanskrit world has been educated using Siddhāntakaumudi. Does that count for nothing? Also, the paragraphs in the preface to the prathamāvṙtti giving the Kaumudi texts a bad rap is immediately followed by a para titled, ' kuto janāḥ saṁskṙtadhyayanāt palāyante'? I never cease to be amused by this.

  

In any case, the late lamented Pt Brahmadatt Jigyasu-ji and his follower, Pt Yudhishthir Mimamsak ji insist, if not compel, that any student using their method must have the whole ashtadhyayi 'kaNThastha' in the first few months. Shri Prasad wisely does not mention this requirement. (Arya Samaj's rejection of the kaumudi texts is certainly in keeping with their attitude to Hindu texts other than the Vedas. Be that as it may. ) Nowadays all the enthusiastic young men who give sūtrapāṫh in their blogs and websites ensure that their resources are mobile enabled :) 

  

There are not many good textbooks which purports to teach in the Ashtadhyayi method. The prathamāvṙtti while being authoritative is rather cryptic. It is meant to be used as a text by kids who are taught in the vyakarana bootcamps by a shastriji. In contrast to this, the **bhaimivyākhyā**which is a series of lectures on the laghukaumudi is a delightfully conversational text which not only mentions anuvṙttis to every sutra but discusses the motivation of the sutra, how the sutra applies, and how to avoid frequently misunderstood aspects of the sutra. In many cases, advanced issues are discussed/indicated in footnotes. I agree following this book will be slower progress but success is assured. But by its very nature this text is more appropriate for the self learner. This text also gives many citations from proper literature whereas most grammar texts generally tend to give artificial/contrived examples. I may also mention that the author of the Bhaimivyākhyā himself was taught vyakarana in the Arya Samaja method. He has not only chosen to write in the prakriyā method. His work does not omit mention of his disagreement with a few of the interpretations, yogavibhāga done by Swami Dayananda Saraswati himself.

  

In the ultimate analysis, to each his own. But the Arya Samaji bad rap of Siddhāntakaumudi has to be taken with a large dosage of salt.
