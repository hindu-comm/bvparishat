Namaste Dr BVK Sastry.

  

  

\<\<How many sanskrit universities have graduated 'Vyakarana Vidwans' who have fully studied all the sutras of ' Panini' OR 'Complete Maha-bhashya' ? Are we still doing it in the Sanskrit Universities - India or else where ?



*Why am I getting this doubt*? Most respected late Vidwan Ranganatha sharma used to lament : Post 1980's, the vyakarana vidwat syllabus all over India, contained itself to the learning of ' Bhashaa Prakarana' part of Kaumudi. and at best to ' sections of Mahabhashya' ( mainly paspasha ahnika).\>\>

  

I am not the proper person to comment on this, because I do not have any degree in Sanskrit from any University. I am an IIT graduate. I studied Sanskrit as one of the subjects up to High School.

The rest I have done only out of interest (from August 1987) on my own through self-study. I studied the whole of अष्टाध्यायी and then started study of सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण (grammar) from 1991 and referred to the
महाभाष्य, wherever required for research related to it. I have already posted one case regarding the svara prakriyaa on BVP and referred also the महाभाष्य.

  

BTW, two students visited my residence when they were doing PhD, from a reputed University, inसरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण (grammar) of भोजदेव. Both had studiedअष्टाध्यायी (with sutrasकंठस्थ) and महाभाष्य from some Gurukul. Both are now employed, one in a university and another in a college. They can teach अष्टाध्यायी very well. But if the syllabus itself does not cover it, what can be done?
