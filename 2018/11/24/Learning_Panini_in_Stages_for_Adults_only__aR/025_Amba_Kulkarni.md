I agree with Shivasenan ji.

I have also found the students trained in Gurukula far better than the students graduated from the 'modern' universities, who have not studied Ashtadhyayi.

  

Since the students from Gurukula undergo rigorous training in Ashtadhyayi, I noticed that they are good at logic.  

Also, they could grasp programming quickly.

  

However, these students do not have any exposure to the Navya Vyaakara.na, and thus many a time I found them weak in Arthi-pak.sa

  

With regards,

Amba Kulkarni
