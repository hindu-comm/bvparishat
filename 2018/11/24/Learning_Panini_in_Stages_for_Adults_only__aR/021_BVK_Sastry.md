Namaste



A side question, may be curios:



Narayan Prasad ji: You said \< But the teacher himself must have studied Panini in the Astadhyayi order of sUtras. ..... >



How many sanskrit universities have graduated 'Vyakarana Vidwans' who have fully studied all the sutras of ' Panini' OR 'Complete Maha-bhashya' ? Are we still doing it in the Sanskrit Universities - India or else where ?



*Why am I getting this doubt*? Most respected late Vidwan Ranganatha sharma used to lament : Post 1980's, the vyakarana vidwat syllabus all over India, contained itself to the learning of ' Bhashaa Prakarana' part of Kaumudi. and at best to ' sections of Mahabhashya' ( mainly paspasha ahnika).



The 'Vaidika swara -prakarana' was decorative piece in the syllabus. There were no competent teachers who had multiple scholarship across disciplines to deliver Vaidika swara prakriyaa with the illustrations of Vedas with voice. The Veda department had very little interest or interaction to augment the vedic learning with 'Vedanga - Vyakarana' learning.



Paninian Samskrutham seems to have been cut to size to the limit of ' Bhashaa Panditya' (40% of text) MINUS vedic (Chandas) part which is 60% of main work (as Vedanga Vyakarana). 





Digital tools help quick and easy access -referencing ( allowing for all the online text entry errors to be condoned; and technology challenges of font rendering- breaks, insertion of unwanted spaces et al. But they do not substitute for learning.



Just wanted to know why such a steep downfall is taking place in the 'Paninian Scholarship' ? No offense, No hurt meant. It is an outpour of 'samskruth-vishaada- yoga' chapter 1 - for revival action.
