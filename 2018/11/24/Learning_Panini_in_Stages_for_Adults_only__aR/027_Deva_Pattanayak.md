Dear Shastri-ji

Thank you for your very illuminating reply and a exposition of your knowledge on Panini’s work on the structure of Sanskrit language with an aim to create a bhabha or rasa through its varna,pada,chhanda,dvuani including allowed sandhi.

The current interest in Panini is related to the hypothesis that the structure of Sanskrit and that of the brain are somewhat related. Also I believe that

the Sanskrit slokas/ucaranas are so designed that it is sometimes difficult to know if one or two and more persons are singing or speaking. Almost perfect unison and synchrony. That makes me believe that Sanskrit often called deva bhasha is developed with a select number of normal modes (varna) or natural oscillations of the auditory organs/body which minimizes distortion related to the different capability of a human brain and consciousness.

I am interested in any work or commentary by you and others post Panini reference to which will be greatly appreciated.

  

Thanks

Best regards

Deva
