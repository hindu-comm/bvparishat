\<\<the requirement that one should memorize and study the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī from the beginning was too tall an order.>\>

  

Sir,

 In my article "[अष्टाध्यायी कंठस्थ कैसे करें ?](http://narayan-prasad.blogspot.com/2010/08/9.html)" I have given the reference that says that even up to the beginning of the 20th century there was a tradition to memorize the sutrapatha even for those who studied Panini throughसिद्धान्तकौमुदी (the relevant portion attached herewith).

 So far studying Panini through self study for adults is concerned, I have indicated the prerequisites in my first message. I studied the basic Sanskrit up to High School and had already read Skt text of the level ofहितोपदेश. So I did not face much problem in studying Panini directly even through self study. Of course, I did find Skt grammar books written in Hindi (e.g.व्याकरण चन्द्रोदय by पं॰ चारुदेव शास्त्री) which I found much more helpful compared to the Kaumudi works.

  Best regards

  Narayan Prasad
