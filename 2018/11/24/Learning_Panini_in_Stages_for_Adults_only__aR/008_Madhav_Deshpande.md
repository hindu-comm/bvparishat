In this connection, I have seen a booklet from the Arya samaj titled सिद्धान्तकौमुदी की अन्त्येष्टि. I have to look it up again for the specific arguments it makes against the Siddhāntakaumudī. I think the fact that several abridgments of the Siddhāntakaumudī were made (madhya-, laghu-, sāra) and were in use in teaching Pāṇini suggests that introductory manuals were necessary for beginners, and the requirement that one should memorize and study the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī from the beginning was too tall an order. Do we have any data for the past few centuries about the curriculums for Vyākaraṇa at various levels in different Pāṭhaśālās in Banaras and elsewhere? That should give some historical context and content to this discussion.
