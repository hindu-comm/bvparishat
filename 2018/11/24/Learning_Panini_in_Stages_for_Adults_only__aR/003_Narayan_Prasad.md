\<\<A friendand scholar suggested to study Ashtadhayi. Then we formed a small group and met three hours every week for about five years.\>\>

  

You were lucky that you could get some scholar for suggestion and also lucky enough to get people to form a group for discussion. I was alone, there was nobody to guide me. Just by knowing the name of Laghusiddhantakaumudi from somebody, I purchased it and the very first sutra in it (हलन्त्यम्) and a bit later the sutra पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् convinced me that this was not a proper book to start with, because it assumed the knowledge of the Astadhyayi that I did not have. I wrote to MLBD to send me the Astadhyayi along with a commentary in Hindi. I did not know the name of any author. But luckily MLBD sent me the commentary of Pt Jijnasu. This is the type of book I wanted. It was August 1987. In about one year I studied the whole of the Astadhyayi and gained sufficient confidence in Skt grammar. I devoted more time to the verb-forms which is the backbone of Skt grammar.

 Side by side I read also the Mahabharata and tried to derive verb-forms myself (e.g.ब्रूहि / ब्रवीहि; करोमि / कुर्मि). I did consultव्याकरण चन्द्रोदय which I found useful.

  I also readसंस्कृत व्याकरणशास्त्र का इतिहास by पं॰ युधिष्ठिर मीमांसक. In it the grammatical work सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण (SKA) has been highly appreciated. Dr K.C. Chatterji has called it a great revised edition of Panini.

  In 1991 I became Life Member of BORI library. I found a copy of SKA there. That year itself I started studying it and from 1993 I started publishing my articles on it.

  Nobody will understand सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण unless one has first studied Panini. But more about it under separate heading.
