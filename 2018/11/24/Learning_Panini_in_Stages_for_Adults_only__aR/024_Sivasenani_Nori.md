With respect to the specific question of 'who studies Ashtadhyayi and not Kaumudi', in the gurukulas run by organizations affiliated to Arya Samaj, Vyakarana is first taught using the Ashtadhyayi order and what they call the prathamaa vritti. Veda is taught after the Vedangas.

  

While I disagree with some of the interpretations of Veda and Sastras by Arya Samaj, some of the best young scholars I met are the students of these gurukulas. If a general description be offered, they are very strong in Vyakarana, recite poems choosing a raaga appropriate to chandas, know quite a few Suktas of Veda, know enough Yoga to teach it and earn pocket money if required, not wise to the ways of the world and gravitate towards sahitya rather than Sastra. Women also wear the yajnopavita and recite Vedic Suktas. Caste is not formally recognized though the persons themselves are acutely aware of caste, and use caste certificates to obtain the benefits of reservations, where applicable and available.

  

As a generalization, these gurukulas (I keep hearing about the one in Kangdi) are producing the best scholars of Sanskrit at graduate level, not the old Oriental Colleges.
