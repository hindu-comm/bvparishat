Dear Vidvans,

  

Is there any resource paid or free where I can get Taittriya shakha (Krishna Yajurveda) recordings by 1/2 artists at the most which can be indexed with the accented text for easy traceability?

  

For RV check out the following:

I am looking for something along those lines and with compareable quality.

  

Thanks

  

Niranjan
