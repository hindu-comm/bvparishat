Namaskara to all Respected Vidvajjana

I have started my Nyaya classes recently and before Tarka Sangraha, Aacharyaji has started giving notes on Sabdabodha. (Like Chaitro Ghatam janati Shaabdabodha, or Dhoomena Vahnim Anuminoti Shaabdabodha etc) Currently, my classes are haulted as he has gone to his native place in South, he will return after a month.

In the meanwhile, I was hoping to get to know some Hindi/English/Sanskrit books on introduction to Sabdabodha in Navyanyaya. I stumbled upon a book on Scribd uploaded by Maananiya Shri Krishnamurti ji who is on our group as well, which I am planning to read. (Here is the link: <https://www.scribd.com/document/213700905/Sabdaboda-and-Knowledge-Representation>).

I am fluent in Hindi and no problem understanding Sanskrit. If possible or available, can schollars suggest names of books on Sabdabodha I can buy? Or, If link (English also fine), please provide.

It will be of very much help to me in the meantime. I have studied Navyanyaya Bhashapradipa suggested by Shri VNJha Mahodaya, which was of much help to me. Cleared many doubts and misconceptions. If I can get some books on Sabdabodha, that will also be very helpful.

Thank you  
Regards  
Rishi.
