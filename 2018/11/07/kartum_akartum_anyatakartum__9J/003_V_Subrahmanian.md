In this context, the meaning is: Brahman, the jagatkaaranam, being the master of the Mayashakti, is spoken of as 'being capable of creation in any way It chooses, or not do at all. ' This statement would only convey Brahman's complete svAtantryam in creation. This is more of an arthavAda than a fact. For, creation is dependent on karma of jivas and it cannot be done away with resulting in the jivas' unfructified karma being lost.

  

If you had mentioned the upanyasa-context, I would not have presented the Brahmasutra bhashya, etc.
