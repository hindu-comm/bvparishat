As I have seen, it occurs in the context of differentiating between karma and jnana. For example Shankaracharya says in the Brahmasutra bhashya:

  

पुरुषाधीनात्मलाभत्वाच्च कर्तव्यस्य।कर्तुमकर्तुमन्यथावा कर्तुं शक्यं लौकिकं वैदिकं च कर्म ; यथा अश्वेन गच्छति, पद्भ्याम् , अन्यथा वा, न वा गच्छतीति। तथा ‘अतिरात्रे षोडशिनं गृह्णाति, नातिरात्रे षोडशिनं गृह्णाति’ ‘उदिते जुहोति, अनुदिते जुहोति’ इति।

  

Here, an action, worldly or scriptural, is open to: doing or not doing or doing differently. When faced with the prospect of, say, going to some place, one has the options of going by walk or going by horseback or any other means or not going at all. Examples for vedic actions too can be given, as above.

  

On the other hand, knowledge, being about an already existent thing, does not offer options; it has to be known correctly as it is by applying the appropriate pramana.

  

Hence alone action, karma, is person-dependent, purushatantra, for its accomplishment and jnana is object-dependent, vastutantra.

  

The Vedanta holds that there is no action involved in Brahman, that is already everexisting . In dharma, which has to be produced, there is action involved. One can choose to produce it or not produce it or produce it differently. There is no way we can know Brahman differently; it has to be known as it is. For this just the operation of the appropriate pramana, veda, is required and no more action. To know the picture on a poster it is enough if I see it. In dharma I have to know what it is, how to produce it and execute the method and only then the intended dharma is produced. Jnanam is not so; it already exists and just knowing it is sufficient and no action is required thereafter to produce it; the fruit of knowing is had.

  

ध्यानं चिन्तनं यद्यपि मानसम् , तथापि पुरुषेणकर्तुमकर्तुमन्यथावा कर्तुं शक्यम् , पुरुषतन्त्रत्वात्। ज्ञानं तु प्रमाणजन्यम्। प्रमाणं च यथाभूतवस्तुविषयम्। अतो ज्ञानंकर्तुमकर्तुमन्यथावा कर्तुमशक्यम्। केवलं वस्तुतन्त्रमेव तत् ; न चोदनातन्त्रम् , नापि पुरुषतन्त्रम् ;  

  

This passage explains what I said above. Jnanam is generated by a pramana. And a pramana has for its subject an already existing thing. (for example the eye is a pramana that has for its subject some form or color that already exists I cannot use the eye to see/know something that does not exist as of now.)

  

Hope the above helps in addressing your question.
