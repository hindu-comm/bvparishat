Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

  

I had a small question reading this old thread regarding the often used Sanskrit phrase--***kartum, akartum, anyatha-kartum.***

  

Subrahmanian ji has nicely shown how Sankaracarya uses this phrase in his Sariraka Bhasya. However, I want to know if this phrase is used by acharyas previous to Sankaracarya or is it also found somewhere in sastras? i.e. **I want to know the original source of this phrase.**

  

Thank you,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
