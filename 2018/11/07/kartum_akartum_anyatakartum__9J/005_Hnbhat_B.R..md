I think the meaning is crystal clear "to do to not to do or do otherwise" and the conte,t only decides the doer of the action and what action to be done. For understanding the phrase, and the components, a little grammar knowledge is necessary. Mr. Subramanian has offerred the context he knows and you have to find all other references you think it is possible to use the phrase.
