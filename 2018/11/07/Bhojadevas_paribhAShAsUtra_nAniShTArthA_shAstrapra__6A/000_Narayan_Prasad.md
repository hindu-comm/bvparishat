Respected Scholars,

 Namaste !

  

 Renou has given an excellent review of the first three chapters of the Trivandrum edition of SKĀ (सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरणम्) in his ‘Le Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa’, pp. 121-127 in Vol. III of ‘Études Vediques et Pāṇineennes’ (1957, in French).

He remarks: "One also finds the maxims of Bhāṣya which have not been brought under special treatment, such as नानिष्टार्था शास्त्रप्रवृत्तिः (123)".

 

 The maxim "नानिष्टार्था शास्त्रप्रवृत्तिः" occurs inमहाभाष्य underपा॰6.1.2 वा॰3.

  

 I would like to know whether there has been more research on this subject.

  

 Thanks and regards

 Narayan Prasad
