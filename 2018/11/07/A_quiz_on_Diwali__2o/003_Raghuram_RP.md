One basic question about crackers . What technology was used to burn crackers . Why would rig Veda bother about bursting crackers? It really looks naive to me. I don't know if it's the quiz master's interpretation or the real meaning . In which mandala does the mantra occur. I am sure our rishis who are no less than scientists would have come up with such non-sensical idea of bursting crackers. Diwali is the most misunderstood and the most unscientifically celebrated festival of Bharatha desha resulting in astronomical rise of air, sound and water pollution during those 3 days
