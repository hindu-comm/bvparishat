Respected scholars,

If a chess knight starting from a corner of a vacant chess-board is moved such that it visits each and every square once and once only, the path of the knight is known as the Knight’s Tour. RudraTa in his Kavyalankara, Bhoja in SarswathikathaabharaNa and Vedanta Desika in his Paadukaasahasram have successfully composed anushtup verse-twins such that one verse is written row-wise (4 rowsx8 syllables in a row) and the other verse appears if syllables are read serially as per Knight’s tour \[The knight’s last position will be such that the latter half of the board can be covered, by repetition\]. I am aware that unsuccessful attempts at composing such verse-twins have been made by Raajaanaka in Haravijayam and Venkatadhwari in Lakshmisahasram.

I am requesting scholars to let me know either directly or through this forum if such verse-twins have been successfully composed by other poets in Sanskrit. Details requested are the name of the poet, name of the work, chapter No., twin-sloka Nos., publication details and a reference to a software-copy, if available. Help given will be duly acknowledged.


Thanks and regards

Murthy
