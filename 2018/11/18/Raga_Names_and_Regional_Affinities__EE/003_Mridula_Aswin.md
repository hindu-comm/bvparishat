Namaste.

We do have ragas both in the Karnatic and Hindustani traditions that seem to denote certain regions of Akhanda Bharata.

Some other additions would be:

Maayaa'**malava-gowla**',

Reeti-**gowla,**

Naaraayana-**gowla,  
**

**Kedaara-gowla,**

**Kannada-gowla,**

**Maalavi  
**

Maarva-dhanyaasi  
**Sauraashtram,**

**Ragas ending in Kambhoji, like Hari-Kambhoji and Yadukula-Kambhoji.  
**

**There are ragas deriving their names from rivers too, like Ganga-Tarangini, Gaangeyabhooshani, Yamuna-Kalyani, Saraswathi, Sindhu-Bhairavi, etc.**

**The usually accepted theory is that these ragas were popular in those regions and hence got such names.**

**  
**

**This list is not exhaustive. I may have missed some more in oversight. If scholars could shed more light on this interesting topic, I would be grateful.**
