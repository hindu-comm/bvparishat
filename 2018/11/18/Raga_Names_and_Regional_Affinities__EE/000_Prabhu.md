Certain raga names seem to suggest a connection to a specific place/region in either what is currently India or Bharata of antiquity.

  

Do the following raga names (Karnatik as well as Hindustani) suggest any such regional connections:

gauLa / gauda

Malava / Malvi

Sindhu Bhairavi

Ahir Bhairav

Kambhoji

Kedar

Yaman (?)

Multani

Jaunpuri

Brindavana Sarang (?)

Pahadi

  

Any other suggestions from either Karnatik, Hindustani or both?

  

Regards

prabhu
