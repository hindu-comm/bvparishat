I think WhatsApp would be effective as there we could have larger no of presence  
  
And on telegram less no of people are available.  
  
To attach bigger files we can upload the to Google drive and share the link that would be ok I guess  
  
  
If needed we would even shift to telegram.  
  
I would request once again to those who haven't joined the WhatsApp group yet  
  
The link to join the group is as here,
