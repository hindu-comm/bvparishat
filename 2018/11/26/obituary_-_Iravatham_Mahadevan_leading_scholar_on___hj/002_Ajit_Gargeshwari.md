Dera All,

  

I agree with Romila. He was a gentleman, and we kept good relations, even where we did not agree (on the “reading” of the “Indus Script’)
(such as during my visit to his institute in Chennai in 2009).

  

I vividly remember his visit to my Department in 2003, when we released his great Tamil Brahmi book: as I said then, his presentation was extremely clear and much better than that many of "established colleagues"...

  

His contribution to the field of South Indian Studies will be well remembered.

  

I had been in contact with him and his family when he was recovering, but sadly he passed away the next day…
