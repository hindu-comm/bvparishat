The anuShThAna-s during those days can be particularly intense and demanding for gRhastha-s (who might happen to be AchArya-s). Mainly, fasting on the parva day followed by an iShTi in case of AhitAgni-s or sthAlIpAka otherwise; and possibly an aShTaka + anvaShTaka or even a mAsi shrAddha on the eighth.
