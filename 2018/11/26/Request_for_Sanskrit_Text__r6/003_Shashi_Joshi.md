And what could be logical reason for such command? Of course, with respect to the time and space of the time it was said.

All *mythological* stories are metaphors which again have an underlying message or reason. We may have lost the thread over the millennia is understandable and sometimes has to be simply accepted, but just in case ... if there is some reasoning available here.

  

E.g. guru also means brihaspati , as well as remover of darkness.

Moon is also remover of darkness, specially at night, and on amAvasyA it is killed.

  

Similarly, do other words have other meaning? And perhaps the three examples together refer to something more?
