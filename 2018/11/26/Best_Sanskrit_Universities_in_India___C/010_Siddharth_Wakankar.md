Dear Shri Shivasenani Nori,

  

Congrats for highlighting the other side of the coin.  

  

Excellent arguments bringing the truth to light,which is quite known and accepted.

  

The point was the bad influence on the educational institutions, mainly due to political or non.academic elements.Nobody will ever doubt the integrity of character shown by the worthy scholars. We salute them for their achievements and contributions in various fields.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
