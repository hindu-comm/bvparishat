Sri Niranjan-ji,

  

Since you addressed moderators, let me respond.

  

1\. This member has been kept under 'moderated' members only because we thought there is a need to stop some of his mails from getting posted which do not deserve to get posted and to allow some of his posts which deserve to get posted only.

  

2\. During an earlier episode, I narrated how I did not allow some of his posts , how he sent individual messages to me pressurising me to allow those posts and I committed the mistake of allowing them at some point and all the consequences later. During the sequence of events then, he even said 'he hates me'. At that stage, it was thought that he was disgruntled at some development of hiring and firing at some organisation and he was expressing that.

  

3\. His mails in this thread show that his frustration and its expression by him in the socially unacceptable forms is not limited to that particularsubject but it is his general trait. Example is his comments about Dr Sivasenani Nori , a great scholar and a well behaving member of the forum. One good aspect of this conversation is that the member by whom you are aggrieved was gracious enough to withdraw his words towards Dr Nori in public postings.

  

4\. But that he was continuing his harassing behaviour towards you in individual mails to you came to our notice only through your recent mails to the group. Until you brought it to our notice , there is no scope for calling our response as 'silence'. As a general suggestion , you always have a scope to block mails to your Inbox from certain email ids. But since the harassment to you originated from a conversation in the list, we too feel we have a role to play in this regard. We can not stop him from sending individual mails to you. You can. We can stop his participation in the discussions in the group if needed. Your information can certainly be one of the bases for taking such an action whenever it is taken.

  

Thanks for your understanding.

  

Regards,
