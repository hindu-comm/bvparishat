Dear Shri Ramananda Chatterjee:

  

Please see your attached fan mail to my personal email account.

  

You have a history of picking unnecessary fights by unnecessarily needling people.

  

You wrote that you did not bother to read past 10 lines of Dr. Sastry's posts, you were needlessly aggressive on both Sri Narayan Prasadji who gave his perspective on self-study and on Sri Sivasenaniji's "political" opinions.

  

Now it looks like you have decided to get personal with me.

  

I am forced to share the email chain after you refused to parse my response in this message chain properly.

  

I am totally NOT responsible for your assumptions and patently wrong interpretation of the following message:

  

***"Just to be clear.***

***Totally not interested in certificates. I have enough certificates most of which I cannot locate now.***

***  
***

***Only Knowledge is important."***

  

  

Sir: You have issues with aggression that you will need to address privately.

  

This forum and its members are not punchin bags or therapy bunnies to be used as per your whim.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Niranjan
