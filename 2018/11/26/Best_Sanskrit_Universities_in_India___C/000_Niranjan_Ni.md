Dear Vidvans,

  

I have a parallel thread about best resources for learning Sanskrit through self-study. Some of the discussions there got me thinking that it would me a good resource for future seekers to complete the resource base by collecting the learned ones' opinions about the best institutions to learn Sanskrit in.

  

1\. Dear List members kindly contribute your thoughts on the best Universities in India that teach Sanskrit.

  

2\. Also in fields like science and engineering we look at number and quality of publications to separate the elite institutions from the ones that are not so elite.

  

In this case, how do we go about the task of separating the good ones from the bad?

  

Please give deep thought and contribute to both questions here.

  

Thanks you all..

  

Niranjan
