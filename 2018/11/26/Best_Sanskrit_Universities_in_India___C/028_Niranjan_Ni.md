Dear Shri Paturigaru,

  

Thank you for your clarification.

  

By silence of good people, I meant not just the moderators but the rest of the long suffering recipients of this gentleman's "attentions".

  

This member has had quite a long list (even within recent history) of obnoxiousness and uncalled for aggression towards Sastryji, Sivasenaniji and Narayan Prasadji.

  

The last straw was him totally misreading a statement of mine and beating me with his misconception.

  

What amazed me was there was nothing semantically or linguistically complex in my message to be misconstrued in such delirious fashion.

  

I am always happy to see different views in a forum. It becomes problematic when people like this start delusional trench wars upon nonexistent adversaries.

  

I am aware that I can block him, but I felt the need to publicise this gentleman's other side so that people in this forum can beware and members can post their views without fear of being attacked willynilly.

  

Life is too short to depend upon your own experience to fuel one's growth. The experience of others saves us so much time and energy, that I see each one of the helpful members of this forum as a Guru.

  

Hence this is also to me personally an issue of Guru-aparadha when a person attacks respectable people whose only desire is to help.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Niranjan
