There are many good Professors. There are a few who are good with everybody, the truly great ones; there are quite a few who are simply not good; but the majority are good to those that they deem deserving and ignore those they deem undeserving. This is exactly how the general population is. There is nothing significantly different amongst Sanskrit Professors. Personally, I benefitted a lot (yes, a few insults came my way, some of them deservedly, but it was the same in other academic institutions that I attended) from the University system and the Professors teaching there.

  

Regarding the best places, some of the fourteen Sanskrit Vidyapeeths under RSS ought to occupy a high place; rest depends on subject. For instance, Prof. Kapil Kapoor did significant work in JNU in Indian Intellectual Traditions; in University of Hyderabad we have an apara Agastya, Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam and a lot of interesting work happening in computational linguistics; Sampoornanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya used to have great Sanskrit scholars; Prof. V. N. Jha is doing stellar work in teaching Navya Nyaya (and Vyakarana and Mimamsa) by and large outside the University system; Chinmayananda University is publishing some great books, especially the English translations of Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi; Pune University has a vibrant Department of Sanskrit and Prakrit; Prof. Ramanujam of CDAC, Bengaluru has done some amazing work on Krishna Yajur Veda; we have newer foundations coming up, one in which Prof. Paturi is actively involved (Indic Academy) and another in which Prof. Kannan is taking the lead (Swadeshi Indology); Dr. Dhaval Patel IAS is doing a lot of heavy lifting outside the University system (corpus of e-texts, manuscript digitization, development of tools) and so on. The list is really long (and apologies for missing out many more - it only shows my weak memory and narrow interests and reading). One has to but have the interest and inclination and one finds that the vast majority of scholars are ready to teach, share and give with great generosity.

  

On the other hand, there are a few - like this lady who was interested in Dharmashastra, approached traditional pundits, learnt what she wanted and then bad mouthed the very same gurus for their narrow-mindedness (their sin was to believe in Dharmashastra and what Sastra says about eligibility or otherwise of women for many things) in newspaper articles. Of course she also propagates the idea that Sanskrit is a vehicle of oppression, if not the main tool; and that everything about ancient India is bad and so on. Such people are plain bad. We also have such persons inhabiting the Sanskrit world.

  

But then this is the exact mixture we get in life in general.
