It is most unfortunate that the earnestness and dignity of the words of Prof Siva Senani

have been so misconstrued and misinterpreted. Prejudiced minds can misread or vitiate

the most innocuous statements.

  

I am reminded of a wilful misrepresentation by a leftist group in Bangalore long ago of

one of the most dignified Upanishadic statements:

*yAny asmAkam sucaritAni tAni tvayopAsyAni, no itarANi.*

The malicious misinterpreter accused the sage of hypocrisy and double game!

  

*indum nindati taskaraH!*

*olladavanige mosarallU kallu!*
