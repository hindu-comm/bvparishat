I may say that most of the Sanskrit and other academic Institutions also are manned( or should we say womanned) by politically patronised academicians who are more loyal to the patrons rather than their own subjects.

  

It is a very sad affair,but,we cannot deny a fact even though it annoys us.

I do subscribe to the view of Shri Ramanandji.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
