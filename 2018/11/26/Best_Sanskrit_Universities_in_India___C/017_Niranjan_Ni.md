Dear Shri Siva Senaniji:

  

Thankyou for your point about there being many good apples left.

  

Where there are people there will be politics. This was as true in Tretha and Dvapara as it is now. So the important issue is to isolate the good apples and focus on those alone.

  

Sri Ramananda Chatterjee ji: I meant even willing to go to Kashi as a figure of speech intending that I was willing to relocate. I am also aware of how to meet and greet a man of learning. But thank you for the pointers anyway.

  

I appreciate some of the pessimism coming in this thread as a cautionary note, but where is the needto make it so full blown as to blow any sincere seeker away for good?  
  
If we really we believe that the situation is irredeemable, what exactly are we doing on this group?

  

Kindly temper any advice relevant to the topic with cautionary tales instead of giving the caution as the whole message. This might send the wrong signal to newbies who are scared away for good. Now that will not be good for either the institutions or Shastra. For without new students there will be no future for either.

  

Please do not misunderstand:

  

Again can you please answer my original question?

  

1\. Which universities are best for Sanskrit education (divided by vyakarana, sahitya, mimamsa etc..)

  

2\. How do we measure quality in this field? (Science has paper publishing, peer review etc to add a measure of quality)

  

I intend this mainly as a resource for new students to make an informed choice.

  

Niranjan
