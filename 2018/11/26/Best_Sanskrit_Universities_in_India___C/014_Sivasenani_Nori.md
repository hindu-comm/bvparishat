While I understand your cynicism, having myself worked as a Sanskrit lecturer in a prestigious college in Hyderabad for one year and having sort of walked away from academic institutions due to disillusionment, I strongly refute your assertion that my statement referred to above is a political statement.

  

Having received so much from so many people, in an overall uninspiring environment, I came to realise that acknowledging the contribution of such Teachers and Professors and Researchers is very important, as it is pretty much the only thing we can do in return. So for me, missing out on acknowledging contributions is a big thing. Like not repaying a debt.

  

Let it be most emphatically known that it (my above statement singled out by you) is an earnest statement and not a political one. My vivakshaa cannot be stated more clearly. If some still want to understand what they want to, against the tenets of Sastra and against the maxims of Paul Grice, then I can't do anything about it.

  

I also protest the personal disparagement. Has my previous conduct led you to believe that I make such "political" statements? Or, has there been any provocation whatsoever from my side for you to indulge in such disparagement? Or, is this being harmful to anyone, or hurting anyone?

  

This is absolutely needless. I hope it does not recur.
