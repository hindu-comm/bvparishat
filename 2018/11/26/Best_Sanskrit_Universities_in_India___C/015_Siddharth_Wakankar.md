Shri Noriji,

  

I did get your point correctly and congratulate you on that.If somebody is not comfortable with it,let it be so.You have rightly answered it.Opinions differ.

  

Pl.continue your yeoman services to Sanskrit, despite such criticism and enrich our fields.

  

Best luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
