Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} request for scanned or physical copy of "Bhagavad Gita : with the commentary Brahmânandagiri of Sri Venkatanatha"

  

Namaste,

  

I have got an old photocopy of this commentary (title page is missing, I guess it must be 1912 edition). I can get it scanned. But, it would be best if someone has a scan of the book itself. When we scan the photocopy, scan quality will not be optimum.  

  

I would also like to know whether this commentary was ever re-printed (other than in the Gita with 11 commentaried ed. by. GS Sadhale.  

  

regards  
shankara
