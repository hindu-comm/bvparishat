Again can you please answer my original question?

  

1\. Which universities are best for Sanskrit education (divided by vyakarana, sahitya, mimamsa etc..)

Since you like Kasi , I first give Kasi info, later South India since it is near to you.

For Nyaya Sachchidanand Misra Kasi, Rajarama Shukla Kasi , the former is in BHU. Later is VC in SU.

Pune Deccan College, And Pune Vidyapeeth, and V N Jha I don't know where is he affiliates.

Calcutta Gangadharkar Nyayacharya,

Nagpur Shrinivas Varakhedi and Madhusudan (I am not able recall names exactly)

One scholar in RSVP tirupati, he was teaching Vyaktivivevka in 2005 is a good scholar.

Mysore Sanskrit College

Bangalore Sanskrit college both affiliated to KSU, there Gururaja Mathada, Viranarayan Pandurang,

In mysore some retired scholars like Varadacharya and HV Nagaraj

ORI S Jagannath not retired.

Kerala Chinmaya inst there Rama Krishna Pejattaya, Singer RSS, Udupi Sanskrit College Mahesh Bhat, Bangalore university Radha Krsna

Delhi Balaram Shukla

Chennai Sanskrit College Mani dravidasastri his students who located in many institution. Students of Devadatt Patil located in many institution.

  

  

2\. How do we measure quality in this field? (Science has paper publishing, peer review etc to add a measure of quality)

There is no such method here. ChaatreNa Gurum Adraaksheet.

चतुरुदधिशास्त्रमुष्टिन्धयानां परभणितिपरीक्षा युज्यते.सज्जनानां

  

I think I enough wasted my time.

Ha there are few who keeps on posting on BVP, I don't remember their names, but few, I can tell

  

One person I don't know his name but to find out there is a clue is he is from Kerala he recently replied to Madhav Deshpande Ji as भूयासम् . I don't know where he works.

Narayan from Kerala currently in Mumbai RSS. Nityanand Misra I don't know in which institute he works.

Lalita lalita is a sudra sanyasi he lives in Chennai.
