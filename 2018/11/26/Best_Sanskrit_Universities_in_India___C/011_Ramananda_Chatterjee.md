Going to Kasi becoming a pandit, we see in old books inspire us very much. Be practical. (Many I have seen who went to Kasi, who are back to square one after the भ्रमनिरसन) But don't worry,

Chennai is one of the best places in this world to be a samskrtajna and Shastrajna both, because of Mani Sastrigal. Approach directly to him, and request him to suggest a any sanskrit teacher from, among his students group. (Don't ask him to teach sanskrit). And do not forget to Namaskaar and give DaksiNaa when you visit also when you are taught.

The below is a mere example of political statement.
