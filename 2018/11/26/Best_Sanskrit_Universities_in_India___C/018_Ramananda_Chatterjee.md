Sir I said it's is an example. I am sorry if you felt it is too personal. क्षम्यतां And I take back my words. But when I made such statement it is most important to know the reason.

  

I am fed up with these academic politicians.  

I will give few examples.

It is a very normal behavior that, if I start praising, for example, Mr X, then I will be noted by Mr X and get benefits by him.

  

I have seen umpteen number of examples.

  

There are other पंडिताभासs around, who simply like, रामाय स्वस्ति, रावणाय स्वस्ति. For instance, Rajiv Malhotra is criticising one of my scholar firends in his videos by taking names which is available on FB. That one scholar who doesnt even know to speak properly अनुनासिकैकोच्चारणः, शास्त्रगंधशून्यः, आमरणान्तकालिदासकृतिमात्रपाठना(अ)कुशलः तदेवोपजीव्यकः, भ्रष्टः, नीचः कुटिलबुद्धिः स पंडितंमन्यस्तथापि अतिविनयं प्रदर्श्य नानादिग्देशे
महाविद्यालयं प्रति समाहूतः, क्वचिच्चाष्टावधानकार्यक्रमेष्वपि. । is taking advantage of both my scholar friend and Rajivmalhotra. He simply keeps on praising my scholar friend to make him fool.

And there are some other fake scholars who make politics behave like sanskrit scholars, but they never write in sanskrit but shows the fake expertise in English language who make people belive they are scholars.

  

There are other scholars, who simply to get themselves notified , who keeps on writing to each and every silly matters, and they reply to a particular post, supporting some famous person as praising him ,that , he is great etc, only because they would get invitation to some seminars or make them chair in fake institutions owned by that particular person who got appreciation.

  

There are other scholars who are real, but they keep supporting the fake scholars. Only to get their work done.

  

Fake scholars are praising fake scholars each other and this is like,

  

**उष्ट्राणां च विवाहेषु गीतं गायन्ति गर्दभा: परस्परं प्रशंसन्ति अहो रुपमहो ध्वनि:**.

Among all these sometimes I am not able to identify the genuine person like you.

  

No hard feelings please.
