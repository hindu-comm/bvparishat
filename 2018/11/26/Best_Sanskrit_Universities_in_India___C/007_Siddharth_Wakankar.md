There do exist such persons or scholars,but,they are in microscopic minority, without any voice or choice and their dissent does not carry any weight,as they are overpowered by the majority.

  

I do hope you realise the gravity of this precarious position and the plight of these really sound and unbiased scholars.

  

Best luck in our sincere efforts.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar
