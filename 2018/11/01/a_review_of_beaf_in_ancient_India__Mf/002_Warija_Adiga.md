Respected sir,

Thank you for sharing this information and link to the book.

  

I have not gone through the book , but reading a few pages, makes it clear the author is clearly showing how meat-eating was not part of Vedic culture. If it is the case, how do we interpret Annaprasaham as described in Ashwalayngrihyasutram -

"अाश्वलायनगृह्यसूत्रम्", षोडशीकण्डिका, अन्नप्राशनम् - अजमांसान्नाशनम्, तित्तिरिमांसान्नाशनम्, घृतौदनाशनम्"

  

Is it fair to assume that like during Mimamsa period itself, mis-interpretation of Shruti happened, and meat got included as part of the rituals? It may be interesting to find which all grihyagnisutras have included meat in "karya" . For example, in Nepal, animal sacrifice is part of Dussehera festivals. Except for cows, most of other animals like goats, sheep, buffaloes are sacrificed during festival season. It was assumed that, being a land-locked country and extreme cold weather, the practice of eating meat was added and used as part of the rituals. Or they may be following a particular shakha, which took the wrong interpretation of the Vedic mantra as described in the book.

  

In my opinion, it will be a good idea to trace, if possible, where all these kinds of changes in interpretations happened. This itself may become a good research topic.

  

Once again, thank you for sharing this information. Thank you for teaching us Ashwalayangrihyasutras in the class as well.

  

Regards,

Warija Adiga
