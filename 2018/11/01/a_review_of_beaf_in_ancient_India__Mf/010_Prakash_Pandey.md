Pranam of all learned scholars,

  

I think "interpreting" texts is one aspect and "observing" the practice another one. (Or, may I say, we may differentiate between a "hermeneutic" study and an "ethnographic" one.) And those who practice sacrifice animal or shun this practice, do so by citing the "authority of texts." So instead of labeling one or the other as the "misinterpretation" of the texts, I am in favour of accepting both schools of interpretation as valid ones.
