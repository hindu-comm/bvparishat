Schlorars, प्रणमामि,

I will request the group to refer a book (author name and publish are out of memory, pardon) - book name is " क्यों" has two big volumes and number of references regarding beat eating is not part of vedic culture, almost all major aspects regarding Hinduism are described in this book with references from various texts of Hinduism,

Regards to all scholars
