Dear All,  

recently there was thread on whether Rama was vegetarian or not. that seems closed. It was discussed earlier too, at least twice, I remember. I thought I should write a paper on cow eating prescribed shastras. I was too under impression that Ancient Indians ate it.

I prepared to write that. and as usual, I stumbled on earlier writings on Cows, sent to me by Ajit Gargeshvari, especially this one by Gita Press. I dropped my plan to write again on it. it is 100% clear.

  

this book has cleared my doubts whatsoever. I hope you all will be able to read this book before comments.  

I could not be attach it because of excessive size. But here is the link

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
