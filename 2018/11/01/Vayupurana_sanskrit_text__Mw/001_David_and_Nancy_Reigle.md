Dear Sri Mansukh Moliya,

  

Thinking that others might reply to your query, I did not do so right away. Besides the three Sanskrit editions of the Vayupurana that you mentioned (I had not heard of the edition published by Sahitya Sammelan Pragat) there is the Venkatesvara Press edition. It was originally published in 1905, and reprinted a number of times, in recent decades by Nag Publishers, Delhi (Śrīvāyumahāpurāṇam, or The Vāyumahāpurāṇam). A critical edition of the Vayupurana is being prepared by the Oriental Institute, Vadodara.  

  

As you probably know, the Vayupurana has been regarded as the oldest purana now extant. This is because of (among other things) its old four-part structure, which it shares with its twin purana, the Brahmanda. Since it has a few thousand less verses than the Brahmanda (the Vayu has a little under 11,000 and the Brahmanda has a little over 14,000), and therefore is a little closer to the lost original Purana Samhita in 4,000 verses, it has been regarded as the oldest extant purana.

  

Because the Vayupurana has been regarded as the oldest purana now available, the critical edition of it being prepared by the Oriental Institute, Vadodara, is of the greatest importance. It will make possible real research on the lost original Purana Samhita, closer access to the core ideas of the puranas. I much look forward to its publication.

  

Best regards,
