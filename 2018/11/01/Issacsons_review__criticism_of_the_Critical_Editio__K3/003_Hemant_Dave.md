Thanks Professor Soni for replying.

  

Yes, Issacson did not submit his piece for publication.

  

As Petteri Koskikallio wrote in <http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2006-October/124649.html>

  

"It is a pity that Harunaga Isaacson's Helsinki paper will not be among the articles to be published (in 2007) in the Puranic volume of the 12th WSC Proceedings. He simply did not submit it for publication."

  

Once I hear from Issacson, I will let the forum know about the status ofthe article.

  

Best,

H
