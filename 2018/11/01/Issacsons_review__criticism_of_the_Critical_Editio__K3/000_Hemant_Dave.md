Respected Scholars,

I learnt about Harunaga Issacson's review/criticism of the critical edition of the Shrimad Bhagavata Purana which he presented at Helsinki WSC.I searched on the net but I couldn't find it if it is published. I will greatly appreciate any help in this matter.

I wrote to Issacson ([harunaga...@uni-hamburg.de]()) but I have not heard from him. I don't know if the email is correct or not.

Thanks.
