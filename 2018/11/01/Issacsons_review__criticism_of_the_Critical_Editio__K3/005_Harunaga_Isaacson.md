Dear Hemant Dave (and others who have expressed an interest),

  

The paper was given, but indeed was never submitted for publication.

  

It was not exclusively about the critical edition of the Bhāgavatapurāṇa, but rather about the enterprise

of critically editing Purāṇas in general. It discussed the then rather recent critical editions of the

Bhāgavatapurāṇa (from Ahmedabad; my remarks were based on the study of the first volume of it alone) and of theViṣṇupurāṇa, as well as the then recently begun  

(and still not finished!) critical edition of an ancient Skandapurāṇa (sometimes referred to as Ur-Skandapurāṇa, sometimes as 'the old Skandapurāṇa'), by a team from Groningen,

the Netherlands. \[Incidentally, at the time of the conference I was still part

of that team; since then, mainly because of too many other activities and duties, I have not been an active part of it. Though I continue to take an interest in the project, and, generally, in the Purāṇas, I lack the time to invest in the extremely time-consuming work of the critical edition. A very competent team continues; since my teacher Prof. Hans Bakker's retirement, the main active members are his other students Prof. Peter Bisschop and Prof. Yuko Yokochi, and the project is mainly based in Leiden,

not Groningen. Others too are involved: see the project-page at <https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/humanities/the-skandapur%C4%81%E1%B9%87a-project#tab-1> .\]

  

Of course there are earlier editions of Purāṇas which can be (and have been) called critical; these were the three most recent such projects I was aware of.

  

My main aim was to argue that critical editions ofPurāṇas are not impossible/futile, as some scholars

had called them, but are very worthwhile, even though such editions, just like critical editions of other types of texts, are never 'final' or 'definitive' (although they are sometimes called the latter).

  

As far as I can reconstruct, I expressed admiration of (the first volume of) the critical edition of theBhāgavatapurāṇa (and the critical edition of the Viṣṇupurāṇa); at the same time I pointed out a few minor problems in it. The most important one, I think, was the fact that the critical apparatus, which was negative rather than positive, makes it hard to see clearly which manuscripts have the readings that were adopted. I also remarked that it was a pity that the first volume of the critical edition of the Bhāgavatapurāṇa did not make use, for whatever reason (likely the editors were not aware of it), of the birch bark manuscript inŚāradā script of the Bhāgavatapurāṇa currently preserved in the State and University Library inGöttingen, of which a facsimile was published in India as early as 1976 (Heinz Bechert (ed.): *The Bhagavata Purana: The Birch Bark Manuscript in the State and University Library in Gottingen with a Concordance by Maheshwari Prasad*. New Delhi: International Academy of Indian Culture,

1976\. Śata-Piṭaka Series vol. 228.) Although this is not likely to be the oldest manuscript (as it was called by Ludo Rocher on p. 139 of his *The Purāṇas*. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1986.

A History of Indian Literature, Vol. II, Fasc. 3), given that its estimated date is 14th-15th century, while the manuscript D1 used in the first volume of the critical edition, and usually followed in that edition, is apparently 'probably dated Saṃvat 1181 = 1124–25', it does seem to be an important manuscript (incidentally, it has quite a bit of interlinear and marginal annotation).

  

With best regards,

  

Harunaga Isaacson

PS Apologies if a message sent to my Hamburg University address was not replied to. I have problems

in responding to all my e-mails, in general, I am sorry to say; and there are also regularly some technical problems with that address, which has relatively little storage space. I prefer to use Gmail.
