Dear Colleagues

Please see below the list of publications, as given in IASS website under publications:<http://www.sanskritassociation.org/about-us.php>.

A quick check of the contents available to me did not show any article by Professor Isaacson. I too am interested whether he had submitted his article and I hope you get a reply from him soon. To the best of my knowledge the \*Pending\* volumes are not forthcoming, but shall check this again.

In the hope that this helps,

J. Soni
