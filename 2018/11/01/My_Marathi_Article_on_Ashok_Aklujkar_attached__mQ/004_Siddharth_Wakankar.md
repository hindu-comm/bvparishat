Dear Prof.Madhavrao,  
  
Congrats for an excellent academic biography of Prof.Ashokbhau.

  

In view of his all round scholarship and achievements in different fields,I jocularly,of course,in a very gentle and personal way, describe him as a person,अक्कल लूज कर, whose scholarship makes others lose their arrogance due to intelligence.

  

Though a Vaiyyakarana,it is difficult for me to give exact translation of these Marathi words,but,those who know Marathi, will know it and appreciate my apt remark about his outstanding scholarship.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
