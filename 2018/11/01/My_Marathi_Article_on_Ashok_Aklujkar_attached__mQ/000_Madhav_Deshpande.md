Dear Friends,

  

  I have attached the pdf of my Marathi article on my friend and colleague Ashok Aklujkar. It introduces his life story and his accomplishments. This article was published in the November 2018 issue of the Newsletter of the Brihan Maharashtra Mandal \[Association of Maharashtra Mandals in North America\].
