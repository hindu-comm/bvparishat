Dear Shri Kalicharanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<3) point 2 above implies that ancients considered makara sankranti to be when surya entered makara ("nirayana"), which is the same as the start of pausha mAsa (subject to precession corrections).  
Uttarayana has therefore got nothing to do with days or nights or seasons\>  

No, sir, Uttarayana is not the start of Pausha Masa but it is the shortest day of the year as per the Vedanga (Yajusha) Jyotisha 7th mantra itself!

धर्म वृद्धिरपाँप्रस्थः क्षपाह्रास उदग्गतौ।। दक्षिणेतौ विपर्यस्तौ षण्मुहूर्त्ययनेन तु।।

"During the sun'snorthward journey the day increases by one prastha-measure of water and the night becomes short. During the southward journey, the conditions reverse. The increase (of time) during an ayana is equal to six muhurtas"---S B Dikshit's translation.

That means Uttarayana is the shortest day of the year when it starts increasing in length!

It is thus very much a phenomenon of seasons and has everything to do with day and nights!

The same thing has been repeated in all the Puranas and siddhantas, where Makar Samkranti itself is the shortest day of the year, clubbing it with Uttarayana! For example, Vishnu Purana 2/8/6/65-68 has said

दश पञ्च मुहूर्तं वै अहर्वैषुवतं स्मृतं \|\|65\|\|

वर्द्धते ह्रसतेचाप्ययने दक्षिणोत्तरे \|अहर्तुग्रस्ते रात्रिं रात्रिर् ग्रसति वासरम् \|\|66\|\|

शरद्वसन्तयोर्मध्ये विषुवं तु विभाव्यते \|\|तुला मेषगते भानौ समरात्रिदिनम् तु तत् \|\|67\|\|

कर्कटावस्थिते भानौ दक्षिणायनं उच्यते \|\|उत्तरायणमप्युक्तंमकरस्थे दिवाकरे \|\|68\|

"On the day of Vishuva, i.e. the Vernal Equinox day is of fifteen muhurtas. The days go on increasing in Uttarayana and decreasing in Dakshinayana respectively. Thus in Uttarayana, days go on engulfing the nights whereas in Dakshinayana the nights go on engulfing the days. (Another) Vishuva (the Autumn Equinox) is in between the (seasons of) Sharad and Vasanta Ritu. When the sun is in Tula or Mesha, the days and nights are equal them. When the sun enters Karkata it is known as Dakshinayana and when it enters Makara Rashi, it is known as Uttarayana."

Thus whether it is the Vedanga Jyotisham or the Puranas or the siddhantas, Uttarayana is the shortest day of the year and Dakshinayana the longest day of the year, and Vishuvas are the days when they are equal to nights!

I may repeat here for the umpteenth time that I have yet to find in any Purana or Siddhanta the definition of a Makara Samkranti which has not been declared as the shortest day of the year or a Karkata Samkranti that is not the longest day of the year and so on.

As such, all the Rashis of the Puranas and Siddhantas are linked with the phenomenon of seasons in an in-separable manner and one cannot be delinked from the other without erasing the letter as well as the spirit of our shastras as well as siddhantas!

*Thus nirayana Samkranits are really niraadhar!*

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
