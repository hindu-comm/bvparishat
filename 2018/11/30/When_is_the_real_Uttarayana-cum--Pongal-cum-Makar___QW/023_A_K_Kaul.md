Dear Shri Narayan Prasadji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your mail.

\<If the Hindu calendar is to retain the luni-solar months, viz. Chaitra, Vaisakha, ... Magha, Pahalguna, these will not remainअन्वर्थक with time. This matter has been discussed in details by Pt. S.B. Dixit in his Marathi bookभारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास (I don't know whether any complete translation of this book has been published from anywhere).>

S B Dikshit's book is available in English on the net. It has been translated by R L Vaidya in a very competent manner.

There is also a Hindi edition available in the market translated by Shivnath Jharkhandi. The earlier edition was a translation of the original book in full, but the later one published by Uttar Pradesh Hindi Samsthan, Lucknow, in 1990 has been tinkered with! The "Aadesha Patra" of Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Dwarka advising to celebrate "sayana" festivals has been removed and replaced in this edition by a useless topic "Jyotish Shastra per aadhunik vichaar" by some Shivnath Mehrotra of Varanasi! I have not been able to find this book on the www.

I am attaching the original Aadesha Patra in Marathi that you had uploaded in HinduCalendar forum quite some time back and also its English translation for perusal of the esteemed members of this forum that the movement of "Calendar Reform" has been going on in India for quite sometime and even the revered Jagaduru Shankarcharya was of the view, as back as 1892 that (the so called) nirayana festivals (including Makar Samkranti) are not as per any shastra!!

\<So what do you suggest about months' nomenclature ? If the Vedic nomenclature is followed, what about the festivals based on constellational months ?>

Regarding the nomenclature of lunar months Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. vis-a-vis the constellations and their name-sake solar months, I have studied the topic in detail and will revert to it after the discussion of Makar-Samkranti vis-a-vis-Uttarayana is over so that we start celebrating Chaitri Navratras also on correct days instead of as per whims and fancies of some "Ayanamshawalas".

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul

PS

Btw, I really miss a scholar like you from HinduCalendar forum. I am sending you an invitation separately to join the same, and it will be a pleasure to welcome you back there.
