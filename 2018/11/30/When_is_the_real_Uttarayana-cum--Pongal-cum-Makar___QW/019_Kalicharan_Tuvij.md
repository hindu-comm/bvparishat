स्वराक्र्मेते सोमार्कौ यदा साकं स्वासवौ \| स्यात् तदादियुगं माघं तपः शुक्लो अयनं ह्युदक \|\|  
प्रपद्येते श्रविष्ठादौ सुर्यचन्द्रमसावुदक \| सार्पार्धे दक्षिनार्कस्तु माघ श्रावणयोः सदा\|  
  

This only further proves my point. It says that uttarayana starts when chandra "ticks" surya in dhanishta nakshatra.  
Now, dhanishta is at the conjunction of makara and kumbha rashi-s in the sky. So, this implies:  
  
1) The knowledge of nirayana rashi-s is implicit in hindu panchanga's earliest refrerences.  
2) Uttarayana starts with surya entering into kumbha ("nirayana") that is also the very same as the start of mAgha mAsa (subject to precession/ yuga mismatches).  
3) point 2 above implies that ancients considered makara sankranti to be when surya entered makara ("nirayana"), which is the same as the start of pausha mAsa (subject to precession corrections).  
  
Uttarayana has therefore got nothing to do with days or nights or seasons.  
  
Instead of repeating myself I think I should stop here unless ofcourse some actual argument is brought forth in support of the solar thesis.
