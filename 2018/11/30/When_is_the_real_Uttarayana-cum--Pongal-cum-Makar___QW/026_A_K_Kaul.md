Dear Dr. S R Ivaturiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<According to Sayana system Uttarayana and Makara Sankramana (both are one for astrological purpose) falls on 21/22 December every year. But according to the Nirayana system which is in vogue throughout India for calculation of ayanas, festivals etc. Sankranti will be on 14/15 January. \>

There are at least half a dozen "Makar Samkrantis" in the fray! However we will consider here the two main "nirayana contestants":

1\. The one that is being celebrated on January 14/15, (Punya Kala January 14, 2019 at 19-51 IST) is based on Lahiri Ayanamsha, which he "invented" because it was the best fit for Grahalaghava Ayanamsha in early 1940s or so!

"The Saha Calendar Reform Committee" in 1955 recommended it with great constraints and with the rider on page 7 of the "Report"

Quote

"This recommendation is to be regarded only as a measure of compromise, so that we avoid a violent break with the established custom. But it does not make our present seasons in the various months as they were in the days of Varahamihira or Kalidasa. It is hoped that at not a distant date, further reforms for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted".  

Unquote

As is clear from the above, the entire purpose of the "Calendar Reform Committee" of streamlining the Hindu calendar in accordance with the corresponding seasons has been defeated since we continue to follow the
Ayanamsha/Rshichakra "invented" by late N. C. Lahiri on which the Rashtriya Panchang and all the other nirayana panchangas are based. That is why I call it "almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha!

2\. The second is Surya Siddhanta Makar Samkranti advocated by Panchangas like the "Kashi Vishwa Panchanga" from BHU, Varanasi etc. etc.. It is also believed that the Mutts of Pujya Shankaracharyas also follow the same panchangas!

All these/such panchangas are actually following anything but the astronomical principles of the SS since it has made it very clear that only (so called) Sayana rashis are to be used for determining Samkrantis etc.:

In Bhugoladyaya, it has said  

मेषादौ तु सदा वृद्धिरुद्दगुत्तर्तो अधिका \| देवांशे च क्षपा हानिर्विपरीतं तथासुरे   \|\|57\|\|

तुलादौ द्युनिशोर्वामं क्षय वृद्धौ तयोरुभे \|देश क्रान्ति वशान्नित्यं तद्विज्ञानं पुरोदितम् \|\|58\|\|

"When the sun is in the signs Aries etc., the increase of the length of the day and the decrease of the length of the night becomes more and more (until the sun arrives at the tropic of Cancer and then they become less and less) at the regions of the Gods; but at those of Asuras, the reverse of this takes place. (57)  

But when the Sun is in the signs Libra etc. the decrease and increase both of the day and night are the reverse. The knowledge of this (increase or decrease) at every day from (the equinoctial shadow of the given place and the Sun's declination is described before (in the 61st shloka of 2nd chapter) " (58) (Bapu Dev Sastri translation)

In "Maanadyaya" it has said further

भचक्रनाभं विषुवद्द्वितयं सम सुत्रगं \| अयन द्वितयं चैव चतस्र: प्रथितास्तु ताः   \|\|7\|\|

तदन्तरेषु संक्रान्तिद्वितयं द्वितयं पुनः\|\| नैरन्तर्यात् तु संक्रान्तेर् ज्ञेयं विष्णुपदीद्वयम् \|\|8\|\|  

भानोर्मकर संक्रान्तेः षण्मासाः उत्तरायणम् \|\| कर्कयादेस्तथैव स्यात् षण्मासा दक्षिणायनं \|\|9\|\|

द्विराशिनाथा ऋतवस्ततॉपि शिशिरादयः \|\| मेषादयो द्वादशैते मासास्तैरेव वत्सरः \|\|10\|\|

''In the middle of the starry sphere, the two equinoxes are diametrically opposed, so are the two solstices (in the ecliptic); these four points (of the ecliptic) are very common. (7).............

***From the (time of) the Sun's entrance into Capricorn the six solar months are the Uttarayana (the northing of the Sun); in the same manner from the time of the entrance of the Sun into Cancer, the six solar months are Dakshinayana (the Southing of the Sun). (9)***

From that time (i.e. the winter solstice) the periods, in each of which the Sun remains in the two signs are the seasons Shishira (the very cold season) etc. and the twelve periods in which the Sun remains in the 12 signs Aries etc. are the solar months and a year is equal to the aggregate of these months"

So the SS advocates to celebrate Makar Samkranti on the day of Uttarayana! Obviously, nothing nirayana about it!

\<If anyone wants to follow the Sayana calendar for him Dec 22 is the date of Sankramana as given in the ephemerides.>

It is not only Pongal-cum-Makar Samkranti that is being celebrated on wrong days, actually all the Samkrantis whether Meshadi or Malyali New Year or muhurtas like Dhanurmas/Kharmas etc. etc. are being celebrated on wrong days, so much so that the entire Hindu community is "celebrating" Pitramavasya on the day of actual Dipavali and so on, thanks to nirayana "inventions"!!

Thus we have to put a full stop to all such adharmic interpretations of our shastras!

With regard and Jai Shri Ram!
