Dear Shri Abhayankarji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your response.

You are absolutely right when you say ,"मकरसंक्रमण is more related to the position of the earth in its orbit around the sun".since the sun is a star and therefore stationary! Thus astronomically there is absolutely no question of any solar "sankraman" whether Makara or Karkata or any other!

So theRA, longitude etc. of the sun as indicated in the attachmentwith my mail is actually a superimposition of the longitude etc.of the earth on the sun.

About your statement "Did you mean "latitude" when mentioning "longitude ?" the latitude of the sun, as per the same attachment is -0.0000378 which means virtually zero degrees South latitude, whereas the longitude is about 270 degrees!

Then again, the twelve equal divisions known asMesha, Vrishabh etc.Rashis, of the imaginary circle called ecliptic are also astronomically impossible and therefore non-existent, since the divisions, whether equal or unequal, of an imaginary circle i.e. ecliptic can never be real!

That is why we do not find any mention of Mesha etc. Rashis in any of the four Vedas.

Coming to the "sankraman" of earth instead of the sun, I am attaching a paper showing the longitude, latitude, RA, declination and constellation of the planet earth.

The heliocentric longitude of the earth as on December 22 is less by almost180 degrees than that of the sun as it is about 90 degrees and the constellationto which it is aligned thenis Tau i.e. Taurus instead of Capricorn/Capricornus!

Thus technically it is the Dakshinayana of the earth and therefore it is in so called Karata Rashi instead of Makar Rashi!

The situation is hardly different on January 16, 2019 since the longitude of the earth on that date is around 114 degrees which comes to about nirayana138degrees after adding Lahiri/Chitra/Sarkari ayanamsha of about 24 degrees.

So we do not get a "Makara Samkramana" on January 15, 2019 either of the earth or of the sun!

  

You have said further

Quote

मकरसंक्रमणwould happen on a fixed day, every year, on January 15th 2019. मकरसंक्रमणis*substantially*independent of the geographical location of a place, especially when looking down at or when looking at a "PLAN" view of the earth's orbit, with the sun at the center of the orbit.

Unquote  

No, the (so called) nirayana Makara Samkramana is not fixed on January 15 at all! The Ayanamsha goes on increasing by one degree every seventy-two years which means about 150 years back, the Lahiri Makara Samkramana was on January 13 instead of January 15. That is why the "two zodiacs are supposed to have coincided" --- whatever that may mean, in 285 AD, the zero year of Lahiri-cum-Chitra-cum-Sarkari Ayanamsha!

Now that we know that there are no Mesha etc. Rashis in any of the four Vedas nor in the Mahabharata nor in any of the siddhantas of Pancha-siddhantika except for the Surya Siddhanta, it is obvious that these Rashis came much later into India, and were directly correlated to the Madhu, Madhava etc. seasonal solar months of the Vedas.

This will be evident from the attachment "Madhu=Chaitra" which says quite unambiguously in Vishnudharmottarapurana

तुला मेष गते भानौ विशुवद्दिनमुच्यते \| धनुअन्तो मिथुनान्तश्च अयने सो अस्य दक्षिणे ......

Similarly, in the Vishnu-Purana (attachment VP1" it has been declared about "Makara and Karkata Samkranti" etc.

तुला मेष गते भानौ सम रात्रिदिनम् तु तत् \| कर्कटस्थिते भानौ दक्षिणायनमुच्यते \| उत्तरायणम् अप्युक्तं मकरस्थे दिवाकरे \|\|  

The meaning of both these "quotes" is very simple: "When the sun is in Tula or Mesha, the day is equal to night and when it enters Karkata that is the start of Dakshniaayana, whereas with the entrance into Makara the six months of Uttarayana start"

I could go on quoting almost all the Puranas like Srimad Bhagavata, Shiva Purana, Vamana Purana and so on but I think the above proofs are more than sufficient for the time being that the so called nirayana Rashis starting from April 14/15 as Mesha (Mesharambha) etc. are really
"niraadhaar"- निराधार---as they have no basis whatsoeverfrom any shastra or purana or even siddhanta, much less any of the four Vedas or the Vedanga Jyotisham!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
