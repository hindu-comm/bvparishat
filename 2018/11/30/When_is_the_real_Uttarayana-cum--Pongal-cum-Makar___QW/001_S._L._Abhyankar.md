Dear Mr. Kaul,

  

Did you mean "latitude" when mentioning "longitude" ?

  

By my understanding, उत्तरायण and मकरसंक्रमण are two different astronomical phenomena.

  

The उत्तरायणis more related to the latitudes - and influences period of day-time, which, at the commencement of उत्तरायण is shortest in the northern hemisphere and accordingly longest in southern hemisphere, (e.g. in Australia, New Zealand)

  

मकरसंक्रमण is more related to the position of the earth in its orbit around the sun. The 360 degrees of the earth's orbit are divided into 12 राशी-s, so 30 degrees per राशी and मकर is one of them. So, मकरसंक्रमणwould happen on a fixed day, every year, on January 15th 2019. मकरसंक्रमणis *substantially* independent of the geographical location of a place, especially when looking down at or when looking at a "PLAN" view of the earth's orbit, with the sun at the center of the orbit.
