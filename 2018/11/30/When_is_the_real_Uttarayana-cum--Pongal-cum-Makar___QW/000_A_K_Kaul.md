Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,  

Jai Shri Ram!

A very important festival viz. Pongal -cum-Makar Samkranti is approaching fast.  

The million dollar question is as to when should it be celebrated.

My views are as under:

Shri T V Sivaraman, a Tamilian Brahmin,has said in his website at  

<http://reformedsanathancalendar.com/>  

that Makar Samkranti-cum-Uttarayana is on Friday December 21, 2018, at 27 hrs. 53 mts IST, which means 22 hrs 23 mts UT.  

The same thing has been confirmed by Shri Darshaney Lokesh in his Shri Mohan Aarsha Tithi Patrak in Hindi.

I am attaching a couple of printouts from NASA/JPL interactive ephemeris for December 20 to 23 on a half hourly basis.  

On December 21, 2018, you will see that the Declination of the sun keeps on increasing to 23.43541 degrees South when it becomes "steady", till 22 hrs. 23 mts. UT whereas the longitude of the sun is [269.9945179](tel:(269)%20994-5179) at that moment. As soon as the sun reaches 270 degrees (at 22 hr. 23 mts.) the Southern declination of the sun starts decreasing, that means it starts "turning" towards north.
And hence that is the real moment of "Uttarayana" cum Sidddhantic-cum-Pauranic Makar Samkranti since the longitude of the sun is 270 degrees then.

Such a phenomenon does not take place again till December 21/22, 2019.

Besides, while studying in tenth class, I had learnt it in geography text books in the chapter on phenomenon of seasons that Uttarayana (known as Winter Solstice in English) takes place every year on or around December 21 because that is the shortest day of the year throughout the Northern latitudes.

And since the phenomenon of seasons is impervious to the effects of precession, geography text books are not going to change the definition of the same at least for the next few centuries!

Thus that phenomenon also does not take place again on any other day till December 21/22, 2019.

As such, there cannot be any other Makar Samkranti as per any shastra since all the puranas and siddhantas announce in one voice that Makar Samkranti is the shortest day of the year, Karkata Sanmkranti the longest day of the year and Mesha and Tula Samkrantis when the days are equal to nights!

All these facts can also be confirmed from NASA/JPL interactive ephemeris as well as any geography text book or even from any siddhanta or Purana, there being no Mesha etc. Rashis in the Vedas!

It is also worthwhile to see the following link for the same

<http://www.pragyata.com/mag/when-should-pongalmakar-samkranti-be-celebrated-and-why-434>.  

To sum up, the so called Makar Samkranti of January 16, 2019 is neither as per any siddhanta, nor Purana nor any geography text book.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
