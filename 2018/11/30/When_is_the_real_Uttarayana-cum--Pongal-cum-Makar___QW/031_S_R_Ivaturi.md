Respected Scholars!

A few points for consideration:

1\. According to Sayana system Uttarayana and Makara Sankranti will be usually around 21-22 December.

2\. Kumbha Sankranti according to Sayana will be around January 19/20, Sun's ingress in Dhanishtha takes place usually around Jan 13/14. This coincides with Nirayana Makara Sankranti. So When you speak of Sayana Dhanishtha (not exactly Kumbha) ingress of the Sun, it coincides with the Nirayana Makara Sankranti. So both point to the same thing with different nomenclature adopted by the seers as per their system?

3\. According to the Puranas, though the Sun enters Makara or reaches the end point of his southern path, his chariot has to be turned around for the northern journey. The day when the chariot is turned around is called Ratha Saptami which falls on the Magha Sukla Saptami. Bhishma waited for this day, and not for just Uttarayana. Hence he left his body on the next day. The immediate Ekadasi is called Bhishma Ekadasi in his commemoration. Sometimes Ratha Saptami will be as early as on January 24 (as happened in 2018) or as delayed as on Feb 12 (as in 2019) or may be farther. (During Bhishma's last days, may be Uttarayana and Ratha Saptami were very nearer coinciding with Sayana Kumbha Sankramana).

4\. This is because of the lunar Adhika masas. So Magha masa as such has nothing to do with Uttarayana.

  

So some confusion may be because of two systems trying to interpret the same event in their own way!
