Sir

According to Sayana system Uttarayana and Makara Sankramana (both are one for astrological purpose) falls on 21/22 December every year. But according to the Nirayana system which is in vogue throughout India for calculation of ayanas, festivals etc. Sankranti will be on 14/15 January.

If anyone wants to follow the Sayana calendar for him Dec 22 is the date of Sankramana as given in the ephemerides.

  

Regards

  

Dr S R Ivaturi
