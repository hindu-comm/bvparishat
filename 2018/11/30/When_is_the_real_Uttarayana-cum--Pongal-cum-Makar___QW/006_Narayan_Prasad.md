\<\<The image would make it clear, how मकरसंक्रमण is related to the sun entering the मकरराशि and is hence an almost fixed annual event, soon to occur on January 15, 2019.>\>

  

Which मकरराशिdo you mean here ? Of the moving (सायन) zodiac or the fixed (निरयन) zodiac ? Definitely the fixed (relative to the constellations) one. And if it is the fixed zodiac, this event cannot be a fixed annual event in terms of the Roman calendar which is based on seasons, i.e. on the moving zodiac.
