द्विराशिनथा ऋतवस्ततोपि शिशिरादयः \| मेषादयो द्वादशैते मासैस्तैरेव वत्सरः  
  

And this information can be used to determine the age when this particular text was written.  
  
Any text other than Veda is a mix of temporal and eternal knowledge. The temporal can be used to determine the age of the text.  
  
So any reference in a text (e.g. Mahabharata/ Ramayana etc) that relates a seasonal (temporal) data to panchanga framework should be used to determine its age, rather than to cast confusion all-around.
