Respected Shri B V K Sastryji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<3.\<Reg. mesh, vrishabh etc rashis opines that these rashis are not in Vedas, Mbh. Etc ancient literature>, the understanding of post colonial period and pre-colonial period transaltion of texts, concepts and practices need a thought review and research. A fundamental, flawed error of translation equating \< graha> - as \< planet> ; and building ‘ Graha-Ganitha/ laaghava)>

Several decades back I borrowed from Delhi Public Library, Delhi, a book "History of Indian Astronomy" by the one and only Shankar Balakrishna Dikshit (Published by India Meteorological Deptt., New Delhi) under the impression that it would "unravel" all the mysteries of "Vedic astrology"!

I was, on the other hand, shocked to read the following lines on page 108 of the same:

Quote

The author has read the whole of the Mahabharata from point of view of astronomy, and an important thing which he noticed is that we do not get in it any reference of seven week-days and 12 rasis. It can therefore, be said beyond doubt that the astronomical references in it point to a period prior to the time (whatever that time be) when the week days and rasis got introduced in our country."

Unquote

Further on page 139 Dikshit has said emphatically

Quote

It is therefore impossible that the terms Mesha etc. were known in our country before these dates, the mean of these dates being 579 BC.
Another important fact is that the time when Shravanadi system described by the Mahabharata came into vogue has been proved to be about 450 BC, and the Mahabharata does not contain any references about Meshadi terms; hence it can be safely inferred that these terms were unknown in our country before 500 BS.

Unquote

Dikshit concluded on page 147 of the same work

Quote

The names of Rasis (Mesha and others) came into vogue at about 500 B.S. (Before Shaka Era i.e about 4th century BCE ). The names of week days came into use before then, and have been borrowed from foreign countries.

S B Dikshit had actually written that book in Marathi in 1896, more than 120 years back. It was translated into English and Hindi by India Meteorological Department in around 1968 or so and is available freely for download!

Dikshit was a staunch Chitapavan Brahmin from Maharashtra. An erudite
Vedic scholar who had studied astronomy both siddhantic and modern to sift grain from the chaff! Also judging from his "History", even his opponents cannot say that he was under the influence of the foreigners and therefore misinterpreted the Vedic or siddhantic material.

As I was born and brought up in an atmosphere where astrology was supposed to be a divine science and people feared "Shani Devta's Sade-sati" more than Yamaraja, his asseverations were a rude shock to me!

I therefore went through the Mahabharata cover to cover with a tooth comb and was disappointed to find that there were really no Mesh etc. Rashis in the same!

\<2.\<If so the dalit jyotish**has no scientific basis**.>
Before asking for \< phalit Jyotish> , let the debates take place on the right understanding of basics of Vedanga Jyotisha; namely Graha, Kala, Punya, Karma and the like; How sciences perceive and postulate this.
Going by popular opinion in a scientific deliberation does not lead to right ends.>

Regarding Mangal, Shani etc. planets they have been mentioned innumerable times in the epic but they were/are conspicuous by their absence from the Rigveda, Yajurveda (both Krishna and Shukla) and the Sama-Veda or the Brahmanas or eve the Vedanga Jyotisham, the ancient most astronomical work of 1400 BCE!!  

In fact, the definition of "Jyotisham" as per the Vedanga Jyotisha--the Alpha of the Indian astronomy--(RikJyotisham 36th and Yajusha Jyotisham 3rd mantra) is not predictive astrology but sort of calculation of "panchanga"

वेदा हि यज्ञार्थम् अभिप्रव्रिताः कालानुपूर्वा विहिताश्च यज्ञाः \| तस्मादिदं कालविधान शास्त्रं यो ज्योतिषं वेद स वेद यज्ञान् \|\|

The Vedas have indeed been revealed for the sake of performance of the sacrifices. But these sacrifices are dependent on the (various segments of) time. Therefore, only he who knows the lore of time viz. jyotisha, understands the performance of the sacrifices fully! (K V Sarma's translation).  

(A copy of the Vedanga Jyotisha by Acharya Lagadha is attached in pdf format! Anybody can check from the same that Mangal, Shani etc."grahas" and Mesha etc. "Rashis" are really absent from the same!)

Surprisingly, Bhaskaracharya-II of twelfth century AD has more or less repeated the same words in his Siddhanta Shiromani--the Omega of Indian siddhantic astronomy--- Graha-ganita, shloka 9:

वेदास्तावत् यज्ञकर्म प्रवृत्ता यज्ञा प्रोक्तास्तेतु कालाश्रयेन \|\| शस्त्रादस्मात् कालबोधो यतः स्यात् वेदाङ्गत्वम् ज्यौतिषस्योक्तं अस्मात् \|\|  
Thus right from the Alpha to Omega of Indian astronomy, we find the definition of "Jyotisham" as "kaala-vidhaana-shastra" instead of "phalita-shastra"!

It cannot besaid, by any stretch of imagination, that Acharya Lagadha and/or Bhaskaracharya had misinterpreted the Vedas!

What is all the more surprising, we find in the Gita 10/24 and 37 Brihaspati being referred to as Devaguru and Shukracharya as Üshna Kavih" instead of planets! Similarly, Kartikeya is the "Commandeer-in-Chief" of the gods instead of "Bhoomi-Putra Mangal"!

In fact, planets are conspicuous by their absence even from the Bhagvadgita! Similarly, Bhishma Pitamaha was waiting for Uttarayana instead of Makar Samkranti!

Regarding Rahu/Ketu, they are all absent from the Vedas since they are just mathematical points---nodes of the moon---without any real existence at all astronomically!

Thus we have really to do a lot of rethinking about the "Sarkari Makar Samkranti" vis-a-vis Pongal-cum-Uttarayana!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
