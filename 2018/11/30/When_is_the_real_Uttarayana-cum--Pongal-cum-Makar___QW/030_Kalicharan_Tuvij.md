You may need to rephrase the sentence (hint: remove the two "not"s).

One cannot directly refute a hypothesis. One can only refute the results produced by the hypothesis. You have not done that.

These are merely assertions. Again attempting to directly refute the opponent hypothesis.

Both Bhishma ashtami and Bhishma ekadashi are celebrated in the mAgha+kumbha combinatorial.

  

It is reasonable to suggest that Bhishma died on a day that was the eighth day into uttarayana (eight the number associated with Bhishma).

No confusion. February 16 is Bhishma ekadashi in 2019. And this what I meant by evaluating the results of a hypothesis rather than childishly shouting down the hypothesis itself.

Sloganeering?

And the same text has also clearly defined uttarayana as dhanishtha (kumbha) sankranti. So, the above need to be understood with this definition in mind rather than arbitrarily attributing meanings.

In Hindu luni-solar panchanga mAgha has always started around kumbha sankranti, not makara sankranti. Much in the same way as pausha has always started around makara sankranti. This is a built-in feature.

Rashi-s are merely offshoots of nakshatra-s. It doesn't matter when did they gain their own popularity. Mathematically speaking, it doesn't matter.

Ayanamsha denotes a regression formula used to predict day to day skymap without needing to look at the real sky. Modern scientists also use regressions since multibody gravitational motion can't be solved in a closed form.

The topic of regressions is irrelevant to the hypothesis I presented. If you have difficulty understanding why, just imagine observing the sky directly.

Lahiri or Ramana or any other regression formula will not work over such large time spans.

And as stated earlier the mention of nakshatra-s is mathematically equivalent to the mention of rashi-s. It doesn't matter if rashi-s were in fashion then or not.

Please check your references. Almost all of your quotes seem to have one or the other error.

It is shravishtha, not shravana. Shravishtha (i.e. dhanishtha) is consistent with 3000 BC Mahabharata.

Dhanishtha is same as kumbha sankranti.

No. Varahamihira is under delusion that uttarayana means winter solstice (WS). So he is making the observation that WS coincided with makara sankranti in his time. Just as WS coincided with kumbha sankranti in 3000 BC. And just as WS occurs in margashirsha in 2018.

I don't follow Lahiri or others. All I have to do is to have a look up the sky.

I don't think Lahiri or other such regressions will be the correct tool to go that far back. But primafacie these dates (compilation of purana-s as written docs) seem ok to me.

One man's adharma is another man's dharma.

Moreover, like a majority of Hindus I don't follow Shankaracharya(/s) either.

As stated before, regression formulas are irrelevant to the paksha I have presented. I suggest you take some more time to study it.

Don't worry about that. Hindu luni-solar panchanga system is inert to such upheavals.

If you put efforts understanding Hindu panchanga (which is much more complex than your present ideal), you should be able to calculate it yourself. Yuga-s, too, are an inbuilt feature.
