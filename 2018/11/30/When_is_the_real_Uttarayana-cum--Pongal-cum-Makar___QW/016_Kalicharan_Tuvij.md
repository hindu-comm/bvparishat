भानोर्मकर्संक्रान्तेः षण्मासा उत्तरायणम \|  

Thanks for pointing this out. This says, "uttarayana spans from makara sankranti to the next six mAsa-s onwards.  
This confirms the point I made earlier that the makara sankranti coincides with the start of one of the mAsa-s (pausha here).  
Second, uttarayana starts from the "makara sankranti mAsa" onwards, i.e., from the start of mAgha, to be exact.  
  
uttarayana concerns itself with the motion of surya against the cosmic backdrop, i.e. against the constellations.  
  
Uttarayana had got nothing to do with which hemisphere of Earth the Sun is closer to.  
  
"Uttara" or "dakshina" have very definite connotations in our knowledge traditions. This discussion is out of scope for the present thread.  
  
As to why Veda doesn't mention rAshi-s, it is similar as to why a text book on quantum field theory doesn't mention Netwon's laws of motion.  
  
Thanks.
