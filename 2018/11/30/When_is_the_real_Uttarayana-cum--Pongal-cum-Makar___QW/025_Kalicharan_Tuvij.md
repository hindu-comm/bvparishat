jai shri Rama -- AKK-ji,

Perhaps I have not made my points very clear to you. So here are those (yet again, and hopefully for a final time):

1\) makara sankranti is NOT the start of uttarayana.

2\) uttarayana starts when surya enters kumbha constellation (dhanishtha) near mAgha mAsa. Kumbha+mAgha (i.e. uttarayana) is celebrated as mAghi kumbhotsava throughout North India, and in particular at prayAga.

3\) uttarayana originally meant -- the year half that increased dharma/ "light"/ "day". An in-depth discussion, as stated before, is beyond the scope of the present topic.

4\) A literal understanding of the above resulted in conflating uttarayana-onset with winter solstice.

5\) The chief cause of the above misfortune was-- winter solstice coinciding with the real uttarayana i.e. with kumbha sankranti (and mAgha mAsa) at the very start of the present kaliyuga. (nothing unusual about it though : equinoxes and solstices have marked sankranti-s at the yuga transits)

6\) The pauranika/ paurusheya texts, for example, which state "uttarayana" (wrongly understood as winter solstice) as coinciding near makara sankranti, simply present the fact: the winter solstice no longer coincided with kumbha sankranti, that is, the literal uttarayana no longer coincided with the real uttarayana.

7\) As stated before, we can calculate the age of such texts from their mention of the literal uttarayana occurring in makara sankranti.

8\) As mentioned by a poster before, people are free to follow any calender (or religion, or film star, etc) that suits their taste. We already have purnimanta, amanta, angrezi, sarkAri, etc going on so we can have more.

9\) The Hindu luni-solar panchanga is a natural framework that maps seasons not in a one-on-one fashion with time but as in a two dimensional matrix having yuga as one extra "y-cordinate". It is only natural that if pausha is today winter then the same should be the summer for people in the far opposite end of the yuga chakra. This y-cordinate charts out a natural itihAsa, simply to be gleaned from the surviving narrations of people from the past yuga-s.

10\) Not relevant to the current thread, but just in case someone is wondering -- in my (limited) understanding kaliyuga started near Krishna's departure (\~3000 BC) and will continue upto \~3500 AD.
