Dear Shri Kalicharanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Makara Sankranti is designed to be aligned with the start of Pausha. Now, due to precession, there is a (well-understood) mismatch between the two, and the panchanga (amanta/ purnimanta) that has the least mismatch should be the correct panchanga for that yuga.>

The Surya Siddhanta Manadhyaya 9-10 is very clear:

भानोर्मकर्संक्रान्तेः षण्मासा उत्तरायणम \| कर्क्देयादेस्तु तथैव स्यात् षण्मासा दक्षिणायनं\|

द्विराशिनथा ऋतवस्ततोपि शिशिरादयः \| मेषादयो द्वादशैते मासैस्तैरेव वत्सरः\|\|

Bapu Dev Sastri has translated these as follows:

"From the time of sun's entrance into Capricorn, the six solar months are Uttarayana (the northing of the sun). In the same manner, from the time of sun's entrance into Cancer, the six solar months are Dakshinayana (the Southing of the sun). 9

From that time, i.e. the Winter Solstice, in each of which the sun remains in two signs are the seasons Shishira (the very cold season) etc. and the twelve periods in which the sun remains in the 12 signs Aries etc. are the solar months and a year is equal to the aggregate of these months".10

The Surya Siddhanta is in fact full of all such references as talk of a tropical year, since it has linked it to the the six months of gods and demons (Attachment SS0) which can never be a sidereal year.

Same is the case with all the other siddhantas, including Bhaskaracharya's Siddhanta Shiromani---All of them are talking of a tropical year, linking Mesha etc. Rashis to seasons and not to any "constellation"! Even Varahamihira has talked of a tropical year and Rashis throughout!

That means the Panchangas that are in vogue these days are neither as per the Surya Siddhanta nor Siddhanta Shiromani nor any Purana nor even the epics!

Thus Uttarayna is a synonym of (solar) Magha, and as per the Vedanga Jyotisham, it was the start of a new solar year as well as Shishira Ritu. All the siddhantas also have linked Makara Samkranti to the month of Magha and Shishira Ritu.

In fact, in Kashmir, Makar Samkranti is (was!) known as Shishira Samkranti! And if we continue to celebrate "Sarkari" Makar Smrkanti instead of the Pauranic or siddhantic Makar Samrkanti, a day will come when it will coincide with Vishuva i.e. the Vernal Equinox, known as (so called) sayana Mesha Samkranti these days!

So there is absolutely no so called nirayana Makar Samkranti at all!  

We must certainly do something about such a messy situation!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
