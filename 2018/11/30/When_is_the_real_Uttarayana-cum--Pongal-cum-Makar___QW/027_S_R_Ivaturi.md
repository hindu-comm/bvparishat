Sri Kaul ji

I agree with you.  

My guru Dr. Ekkirala Krishnamacharya advocated the Sayana system saying that was the true Vedic (or better Sanatana ) system. But later on the nirayana system entered and it was not scientific. But what he said was that as many people are following it, in order not to confuse them, let us follow that calendar. But while fixing muhurtam etc. we take the nirayana muhurtams given in the panchangam and check them according to Sayana chart and select whichever is good as per Sayana chart so that people will have the satisfaction that we followed the Panchang. 

However his disciples follow the Sayana system only and thus perform Dhanurmasa Puja from Nov 22 to Dec 22 only which is the Sayana Dhanurmasa.
