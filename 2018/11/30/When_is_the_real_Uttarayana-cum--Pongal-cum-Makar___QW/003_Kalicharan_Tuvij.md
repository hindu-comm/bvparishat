Namaste.

There is more depth to the panchanga luni-solar system than usually meets the eye. In very short, here is my reading:  
Makara Sankranti is designed to be aligned with the start of Pausha. Now, due to precession, there is a (well-understood) mismatch between the two, and the panchanga (amanta/ purnimanta) that has the least mismatch should be the correct panchanga for that yuga.  
This is a naturalistic system that eventually results in the start of rains in shravana (overlord being Indra) -- a prominent feature of the design (there being other even more prominent ones).  
Makara Sankranti has got nothing to do with 21/22 December.
