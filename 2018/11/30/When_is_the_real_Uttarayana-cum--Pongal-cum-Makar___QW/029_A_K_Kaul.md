Shri Kalicharan Tuvijji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your mail, as it has given me a chance to clarify the important issues thoroughly and ''once for all"!

\<1) makara sankranti is NOT the start of uttarayana>.  

I have not been able to find even a single shloka in any siddhanta or Purana etc. that does not club Uttarayana with Makar Samkranti. If you have come across any such shloka, pl. quote the same.

\<2) uttarayana starts when surya enters kumbha constellation (dhanishtha) near mAgha mAsa. Kumbha+mAgha (i.e. uttarayana) is celebrated as mAghi kumbhotsava throughout North India, and in particular at prayAga.>

Uttarayana means when the sun turns "North" and not when it enters Kumbha constellation or Dhanishtha Nakshatra etc. It is always the shortest day of the year from times immemorial and will continue to be so for quite sometime to come! It has been referred to in the Vedas as the Devayana whereas Dakshinayana is known as Pitrayana!

It was what Bhishma was waiting for as the Gita 8/24 has said  

अग्निर्ज्योतिरहः शुक्लः षण्मासाः उत्तरायणम \|\| तत्र प्रयाताः गच्छन्ति ब्रह्म ब्रह्म विदो जनाः \|\|

"(Of the two paths) the one is that in which are stationed the all-effulgent fire-god and the deities presiding over daylight, the bright fortnight, *and the six months of the northward course of the sun* respectively. Proceeding along it after death Yogis who have known Brahma, being successively led by the above gods, finally reach Brahma"
(Gita Press translation).

*Btw, it is also not clear as to how you presume Uttarayana starting with the entrance of the Sun in Kumbha "constellation", since that can happen only on February 16 these days as per*  

*<https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/dates-of-suns-entry-into-each-constellation-of-the-zodiac>*

*whereas Uttarayana, the shortest day of the year, is on December 21/22 every year these days! Some confusion?*

\<3) uttarayana originally meant -- the year half that increased dharma/ "light"/ "day". An in-depth discussion, as stated before, is beyond the scope of the present topic.>  

Uttarayana always meant the shortest day of the year whether as per the Vedas or Puranas or the siddhantas! It is thus a synonym of the Winter Solstice!

The Vedanga Jyotisham ----the earliest indigenous astronomical work of 14th century BCE--- has said in the 7th mantra of Yajusha Jyotisham:

धर्म वृद्धिरपांप्रस्थः क्षपाह्रास उदग्गतौ \| दक्षिणेतौ विपर्यस्तौ षन्मुहूर्त्ययनेन तु \|\|

"During the sun's northward journeythe day increases by one prastha-measure of water and the night becomes short. During the southward journey, the conditions reverse. The increase (of time) during the ayana is equal to six muhurtas".

In the sixth mantra of the same work, it has been said that Uttarayana always takes place in Magha and Dakshinayana in Shravana!  

Similarly, Bhishma Pitamaha was also waiting for Uttarayana-cum-Magha!
These two seasonal phenomena could not be clubbed with any Mesha etc. Rashi then since they were non-existent in India!

\<4) A literal understanding of the above resulted in conflating uttarayana-onset with winter solstice.>

As clarified above, Uttarayana is nothing but a synonym of the Winter Solstice!

The confusion of nirayana versus sayana has arisen because of a mismatch in the calculated longitudes vis-a-vis the astronomical principles of the Surya Siddhanta, Aryabhatiya etc.! Munjal had suggested Ayanamsha corrections in tenth century AD to remove these anomalies and it was followed till the advent of Makaranda and Grahalaghava etc. till about 17th century AD!

\< 5) The chief cause of the above misfortune was-- winter solstice coinciding with the real uttarayana i.e. with kumbha sankranti (and mAgha mAsa) at the very start of the present kaliyuga. (nothing unusual about it though : equinoxes and solstices have marked sankranti-s at the yuga transits)>  

This is what Alberuni ---who was in India in 11th century AD---has said on page 366-67 of' ''Alberuni's India"

Quote

For Punjala (i.e. Munjal) the author of 'Small Manasa' (i.e. Laghu Manasa) says that in the year 854 of Shaka Kala the real solstice preceded his calculation by 6° 50', and that this difference will increase in future by one (arc-)minute every year.

These are the words of a man who either was himself a most careful practical observer, or who examined the observations of former astronomers which he had at his disposal, and thereby found out the amount of the annual difference. No doubt, also, other people have perceived the same or a similar difference by means of the calculation of the noon-shadows. Therefore (as this observation was already much known) Utpala of Kashmir has taken this theory from Punjala (i.e. Munjal).

Unquote

So to remove the mismatch between the calculated Uttarayana (Winter Solstice) and the real Uttarayana, Ayanamsha corrections, which were known as beeja corrections, were started. But nowadays we use these Ayanamsha corrections to make correct longitudes incorrect!

Even if we consider your statement, just for the sake of argument, that Winter Solstice coincided with some Lahiri or Ramana etc. (nirayana) Samkranti in about 3000 BCE, you are putting the cart before the horse since we do not find any Mesha etc. Rashis in the entire Mahabharata, which has undergone several "revisions" the last one having been in around 400 BCE, when the Uttarayana took place in Shravana nakshatra!

As per Ashvamedha Parva , Adyaya 44

अहः पूर्वं ततो रात्रिर्मासाः शुक्लादयः स्मृताः \|\| श्रवणादीनि ऋक्षाणि ऋतवः शिशिरादयः\|\|2\|\|

As during the Mahabharata period a solar year started with Uttarayana,
and Shishira Ritu like that of the Vedanga Jyotisham, we find here a reference to the Winter Solstice in Shravana nakshatra whereas in 1400 BCE it was in Dhanishtha. Thus we arrive at the conclusion that the "revision" in the Mahabharata was in around 400 BCE, but still there were no Mesha etc. Rashis there!

\<6) The pauranika/ paurusheya texts, for example, which state "uttarayana" (wrongly understood as winter solstice) as coinciding near makara sankranti, simply present the fact: the winter solstice no longer coincided with kumbha sankranti, that is, the literal uttarayana no longer coincided with the real uttarayana.>

No sir! There are no references in any siddhanta or Purana etc. that the Uttarayana i.e WS coincided with Kumbha Samkanti! in 505 AD, Varahamihira has said in his Brihatsamita 3/4-5

अप्राप्य मकरमर्को विनिवृत्तो हन्ति सापरां याम्याम् \| कर्कटमसंप्राप्तो विनिवृत्तश्चोत्तरां सैन्द्रींम् \|\|

उत्तरमयनमतीत्य व्यावृत्तः क्षेम्सस्यवृद्धिकरः \| प्रकृतिस्थाश्चप्येवं विकृत्तिर्भयकृदुष्णांशुः \|\|

Ïf the sun should change his (Northern) course before reaching Makara (Capricorn) he will bring evil on the West and South; and if he should do so before reaching Karkata (Cancer) he will bring evil on the north and East. (Chidambaram Iyer translation).

It means that Varahamihira, like every other astrologer/astronomer, expected the Winter Solstice to coincide always with Makar Samkranti and Dakshinayana with Karkata Samkranti, since there was not much of a mismatch between the SS/Aryabhatiya calculated Makar Samkranti and the "real Makar Samkranti" viz. Uttarayana in 505 AD!

\<7) As stated before, we can calculate the age of such texts from their mention of the literal uttarayana occurring in makara sankranti>

If you are a follower of ''almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha, then (Lahiri) Makar Samkranti coincided with Uttarayana in 285 AD. If you want to go by the SS Makar Samkranti, it is supposed to have had zero Ayanamsha in 499 AD. Thus SS (calculated) Makar Samkranti coincided with Uttarayana in 499 AD!

That means all the Puranas and siddhantas or any other text that says that Makar Samkranti coincided with Uttarayana must have been compiled in either 285 AD or 499 AD!

Is that what you would like us to believe that whether it is the Bhagavata Mahapurana or Vishnu Purana or Shiva Maha Purana or Vishnu-Dharmottara Purana or any other Purana among the eighteen Puranas, they were all compiled by some-one in either 285 AD or 499 AD?

Similarly, you want us to believe that whether it is the Surya Siddhanta or Aryabhatiya or Siddhanta Shiromani etc. , they were are compiled in 499 AD since their Makar Samkrantis are supposed to have coincided with the Uttarayana then?

\<8) As mentioned by a poster before, people are free to follow any calender (or religion, or film star, etc) that suits their taste. We already have purnimanta, amanta, angrezi, sarkAri, etc going on so we can have more.>

The concerned "poster" has clarified in a subsequent mail as follows:

Quote

My guru Dr. Ekkirala Krishnamacharya advocated the Sayana system saying that was the true Vedic (or better Sanatana) system. But later on the nirayana system entered and it was not scientific.

Unquote

This august forum viz. BVP is a forum of scholars well versed in the shastras and even scientific disciplines. Thus if the members of this forum cannot sift grain from the chaff, I wonder if anybody else can!
Why should we therefore, like an ostrich, bury our head in sand and continue to wallow in the mud of adharma by celebrating all the festivals, fairs and muhurtas on wrong days?

We must not forget the admonishment of the Gita 17/23

यः शास्त्र विधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः \| न ससिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम् \|\|

"Discarding the injunctions of the scriptures, he who acts in an arbitrary way according to his own sweet will, such a person neither attains occult powers, nor the supreme goal, nor even happiness" (Gita Press translation)

We must also not forget that the revered Shanakracharya of Dwarka had declared more than a hundred years back that niraayana is not based on Dharma-shastras!

So why do you want to us to continue to follow adharma?

\<9) The Hindu luni-solar panchanga is a natural framework that maps seasons not in a one-on-one fashion with time but as in a two dimensional matrix having yuga as one extra "y-cordinate". It is only natural that if pausha is today winter then the same should be the summer for people in the far opposite end of the yuga chakra. This y-cordinate charts out a natural itihAsa, simply to be gleaned from the surviving narrations of people from the past yuga-s.>

As clarified above, as per the Gita (and all the other shastras including the Vedanga Jyotisham) the six months of Uttarayana and Dakshinayana consist both solar as well as lunar months! They are not separate from the two Ayanas! Thus it is clear that whether it is *Chaitri Navratra* or *Sharadiya Navratra* or *Pitra Paksha* and so on, we the Bharatavasis are not celebrating even those festivals on correct days as instead of linking them to seasons, we are linking them to "Lahiri" or "Ramana" or "Raivata" and so on Ayanamshas galore!

We are literally turning our dharmashastras upside down!

The narration of the past "yugas" also tells us that we have always been following a seasonal year right from the Vedic period within which were subsumed the solar as well as the lunar months/ festivals! There was no Lahiri or Ramana or Fagan Year and so on then, which they call euphemistically "sidereal year"!

\<10) Not relevant to the current thread, but just in case someone is wondering -- in my (limited) understanding kaliyuga started near Krishna's departure (\~3000 BC) and will continue upto \~3500 AD.>

Nobody knows for sure as to when the Kaliyuga started actually or when it will endl! It was Aryabhata, who in his Aryabhatiya 3/10 had said

षष्टयब्दानां षष्टिर्यदा व्यतीतास्त्रयश्च युगपादाः \| त्र्यधिका विम्शतिरब्दास्तदेह मम जन्मनो अतीताः \|\|

"When sixty times sixty years and three quarter yugas (of the current yuga) had elapsed, twenty three years had then passed since my birth". (K S Shukla translation, INSA edition).

This ''event" of Aryabhata turning 23 had happened on March 21, 499 AD. By subtracting 3600 years from the same, we get 499 minus 3600 = -3101 AD i.e. 3102 BCE.

Prior to the same, in 1/3-4 Aryabhata has given the number of planetary revolutions in a ''Yuga" and stated that except for the apogee and node of the moon all the planets were having zero degrees of mean longitude at the start of the current ''yuga".

When we calculate the mean longitudes of the Aryabhatiya, we find they were really zero at 6 am on February 18, 3102 BCE. And that is said to be the start of Kaliyuga though actually it is not so since the mean longitudes of none of the planets were zero then!

However, since this mail has already become quite long, and since the Yuga duration is an entirely different thread, I shall revert to it later separately!

In the meantime, pl do celebrate Pongal-Cum-Makar-Samkranti -cum-Uttarayana tomorrow i.e. Saturday, December 22, 2018!

My best wishes for the same!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
