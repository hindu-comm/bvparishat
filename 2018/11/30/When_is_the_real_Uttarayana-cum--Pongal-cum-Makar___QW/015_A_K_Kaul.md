Dear Shri Abhyankarji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<In my image I have added the arrow, showing the direction of rotation of the earth and also an arrow from a point on earth, across the center of the sun into the zodiac and the **constellations**.>

A couple of things have to be borne in mind!  

There are actually about 88 Constellations as per modern astronomy out of which thirteen (fourteen including Ceti i.e. Cetus meaning a “Whale”) are the major ones of the zodiac i.e. the constellational belt “hovering” around the ecliptic.   

Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis are entirely different from Aries and Taurus etc. constellations. The English synonyms Aries etc.(so called) Sayana Rashis also are different from constellations of the same name.

The names of constellations are of Greek origin. In the early centuries of CE, both the Greek constellations and Western "Rashis" almost coincided with one another, though technically it can never be so since the "Rashis" are twelve divisions of equal length whereas constellations are quite unequal to one another. With the passage of time, because of precession, the constellations got entirely de-linked from even the Western Rashis!

Thus the twelve equal divisions of Rashis whether "tropical" or "sidereal" are really non-existent astronomically. Even the "divisions" known as constellations are "effect" of the sight since there are no "Crabs" (Karkata/Cancer) or "Bulls" (Taurus/Vrishabh) or "Lions" (Leo/Simha) etc. in the sky moving anywhere in the zodiac! Some divisions of stars looked like "lions" etc. in the past, but because of precession even those groups got dissipated!

And that is the reason why we do not find any mention of Mesha etc. Rashis in any of the four Vedas, nor in the Vedanga Jyotisha nor in the Atharva-Jyotisham nor even in the Atharva-Veda Parishishta nor in any of the Siddhantas of the Panchasiddhantika except for the Surya Siddhanta!  

\<This would help to understand in which राशि, more precisely in which नक्षत्र, still more precisely in which चरण of the नक्षत्र the sun can be said to be in, to an observer on earth. depending upon his time and place of observation.>

Now coming to nakshatras, we find mention of the same times without number in the Vedas and Brahmanas etc.

Here also when the Vedas talk about them, they qualify it with statements like "देवगृहा वै नक्षत्राणि, कृत्तिका प्रथमम् " (Taittiriya Brahmana 3/1/2/2). which means "Gods reside in nakshatras. Krittika is the first among them". That means the nakshatras started with Krittika instead of Ashvini as is happening these days!

And we find twenty-eight nakshatras instead of 27 (including Abhijit) in the Atharva-Veda (19.7).

In the Shatapatha Brahmana 2/1/2 we find

एकं द्वे त्रीणि चत्वारीनि वा अन्यानि नक्षत्रान्यथैता तु भूयिष्ठायत्
कृत्तिका .....एषा ह वै प्राच्यै दिशोन च्यवन्ते सर्वाणि ह वा अन्यानि नक्षत्राणि प्राच्यै दिशश्च्यवन्ते.."

"Krittikasalone consist of many stars, other asterisms (consist of) one, two, three, or only four stars. ...Kritttikas are the only stars which do not 'deviate' from the east while all others do..."

Several things are very clear from these statements. As per the Vedas

1\. Naksatras are "homes of gods" instead of imaginary equal divisions and sub-divisions of an imaginary ecliptic.

2\. Nakshatras during the Vedic and the VJ period nakshatras started from Krittikas instead of Ashvini.

3\. There were twenty-eight instead of 27 nakshatras during the Vedic period.

4\. Nakshatras consisted of stars in which Krittika nakshatra is supposed to have the maximum number of stars---more than six---whereas the other nakshatas had one, two, three or even four!

5. Krittikas never deviated from the east whereas all the other nakshatras do deviate!

6\. Since there is no mention of any Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in the Vedas or the Vedangas, Vedic nakshatras are quite independent of any such Rashicha-kra, whether so called sayana or so called nirayana, not to speak of the Greek constellations!

Clubbing the nakshatras, that too twenty-seven equal nakshatras, with twelve "nirayana" Rashis is therefore a very unscientific attempt withoutany sanction from any shastra.

\<Since the angle subtended by the sun is only 0.53 degrees, and also because the earth traverses through less than 1 degree of its orbital path in 24 hours, it does not really make a big difference, even if the observer would want to note राशि, नक्षत्र and चरण, when it is night time at his place.>  

FYI, the sun will ''enter" constellation "Capricorn" around January 19 and not January 15 !

So whichever way we look at it, the Makar Samkranti of January 15 is not even a constellational Samkraniti much less a scriptural or siddhantic Samkranti!  

The earlier we set such anomalies right, the better for the Hindu community as a whole!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
