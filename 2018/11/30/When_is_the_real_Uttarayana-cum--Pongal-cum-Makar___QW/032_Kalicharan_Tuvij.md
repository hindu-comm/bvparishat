I'm afraid there cannot be a term like "sayana dhanishtha". Nakshatra-s by definition are fixed stars. If sayana hypothesis ends in results such as this, then this is simply unacceptable.

Aping Western zodiac system (which were themselves borrowed from somewhere else without an understanding of the deeper motivations) is even more unacceptable because even if we were to adopt a tropical system, the winter solstice had better coincide with aquarius boundary rather than capricorn's in order to somewhat reflect the deeper structure of the original zodiac.

Ratha saptami is another evidence that uttarayana is the same as magha sankranti. There is a one-to-one correspondence of magha mAsa with kumbha rashi so both can be interchangeably used.

Though to be precise, uttarayana indeed starts with the start of magha. And if we average out the co-occurrences of magha with kumbha, it should be around the center of kumbha.

If we look at the sky map near 3000 BC (rider: I've not gone through the regression formula inside such softwares) this is exactly what we see: winter solstice (WS) falling in the centre of kumbha (N.B. centers are easier to mark). So on the average WS used to fall at the very start of magha. And because magha start is uttarayana, we see that WS and uttarayana were one and the same in 3000 BC.

Let us understand this very clearly:

The coocurence of uttarayana (= magha sankranti) with WS can happen only during a yuga transit. It is not a normal yearly phenomenon. This was a problem for those who had simply copied a 3000 BC zodiac from somewhere else, we have better things to do.

The cooccurence of WS with dhanishtha gives us a date of 2500-2100 BC. This gives us a fair idea of the period when mahabharata was still undergoing redaction/ retelling.

It is not that everything is fine with the Hindu panchanga today. We need to put the zero year at the start of kaliyuga.

Also, I must confess that I don't completely understand our panchanga system (designed for fun's sake by people far superior to me); and if the definition of especialist (expert) is by how many man-hours he devoted to a subject (some say 10,000 hours) I am certainly no expert (a generalist only at best).

I also sincerely encourage everyone to follow their hearts / calendars; but evangelism of any kind cannot be tolerated.
