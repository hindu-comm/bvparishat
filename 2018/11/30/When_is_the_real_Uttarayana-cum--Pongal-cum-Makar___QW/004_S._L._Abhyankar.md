I am glad that I have been able to compose an image as below, using an image at \<<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac>\>

  

In my image I have added the arrow, showing the direction of rotation of the earth and also an arrow from a point on earth, across the center of the sun into the zodiac and the constellations. This would help to understand in which राशि, more precisely in which नक्षत्र, still more precisely in which चरण of the नक्षत्र the sun can be said to be in, to an observer on earth. depending upon his time and place of observation. Since the angle subtended by the sun is only 0.53 degrees, and also because the earth traverses through less than 1 degree of its orbital path in 24 hours, it does not really make a big difference, even if the observer would want to note राशि, नक्षत्र and चरण, when it is night time at his place.

  

The image would make it clear, how मकरसंक्रमण is related to the sun entering the मकरराशि and is hence an almost fixed annual event, soon to occur on January 15, 2019.

  

Obviously, मकरसंक्रमण is not related to day of shortest day-light.
