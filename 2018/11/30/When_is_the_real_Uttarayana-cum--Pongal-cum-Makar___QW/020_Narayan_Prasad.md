Namaste.

  

If the Hindu calendar is to retain the luni-solar months, viz. Chaitra, Vaisakha, ... Magha, Pahalguna, these will not remainअन्वर्थक with time. This matter has been discussed in details by Pt. S.B. Dixit in his Marathi bookभारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्राचा इतिहास (I don't know whether any complete translation of this book has been published from anywhere).

If the national Hindu calendar suggested is followed, although seasons will recur in proper months, but the months' nomenclature Chaitra, Vaisakha, ... Magha, Pahalguna related respectively to Chitra, Visakha, ... Magha, Phalguni will have nothing to do with these constellations (nakshatras) with time.

  

So what do you suggest about months' nomenclature ? If the Vedic nomenclature is followed, what about the festivals based on constellational months ?

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
