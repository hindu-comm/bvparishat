Namaste



1. \< dalit /phalit> - If so the dalit jyotish has no scientific basis. --- I presume it is a typo and you meant \< phalit – jyotish> ?? 



2. \< If so the dalit jyotish **has no scientific basis**. >
Before asking for \< phalit Jyotish> , let the debates take place on the right understanding of basics of Vedanga Jyotisha; namely Graha, Kala, Punya, Karma and the like; How sciences perceive and postulate this.
Going by popular opinion in a scientific deliberation does not lead to right ends.





3. \<Reg. mesh, vrishabh etc rashis opines that these rashis are not in Vedas, Mbh. Etc ancient literature>, the understanding of post colonial period and pre-colonial period transaltion of texts, concepts and practices need a thought review and research. A fundamental, flawed error of translation equating \< graha> - as \< planet> ; and building ‘ Graha-Ganitha/ laaghava) Astronomy related issues over ‘Vednaga Jyotisha as Jyotir-Yoga-Darshana Shaastra’ has yielded many research outcomes that are technically flawed. Example: Astronomy would posit one nodal point separated by 180 degrees for Rahu- Ketu.
And phalit jyotish uses only one Rahu –Ketu pair. But there are Jyotish works which explain several ketus with different results. All such views need to be reexamined critically .
