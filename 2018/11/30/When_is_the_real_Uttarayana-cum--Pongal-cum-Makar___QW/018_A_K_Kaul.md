Dear Shri Kalicharanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<This says, "uttarayana spans from makara sankranti to the next six mAsa-s onwards.

This confirms the point I made earlier that the makara sankranti coincides with the start of one of the mAsa-s (pausha here).  
Second, uttarayana starts from the "makara sankranti mAsa" onwards, i.e., from the start of mAgha, to be exact.\>

You are absolutely right! Uttarayana has always been the shortest day of the year from times immemorial. It has also been the start of the(solar) Magha/Tapah as per the very first indigenous "astronomical work" viz. The Vedanga Jyotisham, a work of about 1400 BCE

स्वराक्र्मेते सोमार्कौ यदा साकं स्वासवौ \| स्यात् तदादियुगं माघं तपः शुक्लो अयनं ह्युदक \|\|

प्रपद्येते श्रविष्ठादौ सुर्यचन्द्रमसावुदक \| सार्पार्धे दक्षिनार्कस्तु माघ श्रावणयोः सदा\|

As and when the sun and moon join together in Dhanishtha, that is the start of a new (five year) yuga, the Shukla Paksha of the month of Magha and Tapah. ....Uttarayana always starts with the month of Magha and Dakshinaayana with the month of Shravana (Yajusha Jyotsiham, 6th and 7th mantra).

  

As and when Makar etc. rashis came to India, it got linked in a seamless manner with the month of solar Magha since in Greek astronomy/astrology, the sun is supposed to enter Capricorn when it is the shortest day of the year. It has continued like that and the Julian/Gregorian calendar had to undergo many transformations for aligning months ("rashis") with seasons!  

In India also the same trend continued till about sixteenth century, since we find mention of Vishuva as Mesha Samkranti and a year consisting of two Ayanas etc. in the Tatparya Prakasha commentary of Anandabodha Yati on the Yogavasishtha Maharamayana. (Attachment Yv-Ayanas).

It was works like Graha-Laghava and Makaranda and Sarvananda-Laghava etc. which gave rise to nirayana mayhem, since the Surya Siddhanta of (so called) Maya Mahasura has talked of nothing but Mesha being the Vernal Equinox and Tula the Autumn Equinox and Makara being the Uttaryana and Karkata being Dakshinayana and so on.

The same has been the case with even the Siddhanta Shiromani of Bhaskaracharya-II.

Besides, I have yet to find an independent existence of Makar Samkranti in any of the Puranas or Siddhantas, which is bereft of being coupled with the shortest day of the year! It means we have to go by seasonal Samkrantis and not be imaginary niraayana ones. Nirayana is really niraadhar!

निरयण सचमुच ही निराधार है !

We must therefore set the records straight!

शुभस्य शीघ्रं \|\|

Regarding "As to why Veda doesn't mention rAshi-s, it is similar as to why a text book on quantum field theory doesn't mention Netwon's laws of motion",IMHO it is simply because there was no predictive astrology then! On the other hand it was

.उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत \| क्ष्युरस्य धारा निशिता दुरत्यया दुर्गं पथस्तत्कवयो वदन्ति\|\|(Kathopanishad 1/3/14)

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
