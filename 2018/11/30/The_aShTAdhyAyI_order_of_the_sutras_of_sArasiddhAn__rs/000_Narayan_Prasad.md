Dear Scholars,

 Namaste.

  I came to know of the सारसिद्धान्तकौमुदी (SSK) of वरदराज (edited by Dr G.V. Devasthali) only very recently (12 Nov. 2018) when I was searching a book with the same title translated into Chinese (cover page attached). I was curious to know how Pāṇini has been translated into Chinese that does not have any alphabet of its own. While leafing through it, I found that on p. xix the above work edited by Devasthali has been mentioned. I searched a copy for it and got it in BORI library itself. Later I found another book edited by पं॰ हरेकान्त मिश्र (cover page attached). This last one gives 681 sūtras against 723 rules in Devasthali’s. The main difference lies in the fact that हरेकान्त मिश्र has allotted sūtranos. only to the Aṣṭādhyāyī sūtras, whereas Devasthali has allotted serial numbers along with the sūtras also to the varttikas and one उणादि sūtra. This is not all. Even three unique sūtras have been allotted multiple serial numbers as SSK rules, e.g. यस्येति च (P.6.4.148) get three different numbers: 209, 220, 624.

 The [reviewer](https://vdocuments.site/sarasiddhantakaumudi-of-varadarajaby-g-v-devasthali.html) of the SSK (edited by Dr G.V. Devasthali) remarks (JAOS, Vol.90, No.2, 1970, p.408):

*“In the edition, each sūtra of the Sārasiddhāntakaumudī is followed by the corresponding number in the Aṣṭādhyāyī; but there is no direct way to see how many and which sūtras of a given chapter of Pāṇini’s grammar are preserved in the Sārasiddhāntakaumudī. It would also have been interesting to have a concordance of sūtras in the three abridgments by Varadarāja.”*

 Attached herewith is an excel file prepared by me giving the SSK sūtras in the Aṣṭādhyāyī order. During its preparation I found many printing errors in the SSK (1968) edition. All those have been corrected during preparation of this excel file.

 While the concordance of LSK is already available online, I do not know such thing about MSK.

 BTW, Neelesh Bodas ji has kindly agreed to host this excel file in the convenient form at the website [astadhyayi.com](http://astadhyayi.com).

 Best regards

 Narayan Prasad
