The 'sārasiddhāntakaumudi' and the 'anubandhas of Pāṇini' work by GV Devasthali are both published by Unipune and still available. Please see:

I got my copies of these two works and a few others way back in 2003. The former work is printed in sepia colored and rather crumbly paper. The page gets sharp creases and breaks apart. But the latter work as well as works such as 'anuvṛttis of pāṇini' by SD Joshi are all printed in relatively better and whiter looking paper.

  

All these seem to be still available there.
