Good to hear. I had done some work on this. Shaaradapeet is around 15miles north west of kargil and in POK. The key hurdle is that if Bharath govt accepts the offer then it implicitly accepts pok to be part of Pakistan. Not sure if anyone has smart solution to this puzzle. Maybe there [will.be](http://will.be) progress like building a structure at private level..with both govts supporting from the sidelines.
