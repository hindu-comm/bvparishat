Minister) @ImranKhanPTI for opening of SharadaPeeth in Kashmir, Katasraj & other shrines too this will certainly bridge the gap & usher peace in region," Mehbooba said in a tweet.

Her tweet came in response to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's interaction with Indian journalists, in which he reportedly said, "We can consider other proposals, including opening up travel for the Sharada Peeth in Kashmir, Katasraj and other Hindu shrines too."

Mehbooba, later issued a statement, in which she said her party is sure that the offer will elicit a positive response from the Indian government.  
The PDP president said the hawks on the either side must be sidelined so that a new beginning in the Indo-Pak thaw could be made possible.

"The prime minister must lead this process personally so that the hawks are not allowed to disrupt this new atmosphere of peace. Such initiatives of offering peace through these channels are worth to hail," she said.
