The PM says - न प्रकृत्यर्थव्यतिरेकेण अपरं विध्यादिकम्. The different vidhyadi artha that gets generated by "प्रकृत्यर्थव्यतिरेक" (transformation or negation of a different prakriti) is not allowed to be expressed. So, only these six (or those which are clear synonyms of these) are allowed.

Yes. It means that these six verbs (or other verbs with this exact meaning) cannot get the ling pratayay, it will just be प्रतिपत्तिगौरव (ref. nyaas) That is, same thing said twice).

Actually 1 and 3 are kind of opposite -

1 says - six verbs can get ling but not others  

3 says - others can get ling but not these six.

  

Scholars may correct if wrong.
