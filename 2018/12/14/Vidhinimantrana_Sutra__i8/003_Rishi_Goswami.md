I am very grateful to both of you helping me out, but i would still have some confusions. 90% is clear, but 10℅ still ambiguous. I'll write down what I have understood in each Paksha, maybe I'm wrong and have misunderstood. Please help me out there. \_/\\\_

FIRST says that Vidhyadi artha can be substituted for the kriya. Means kriya can only be something which represents 6 arthas, as in Bhoo can't be the kriya for ling because Bhoo doesn't fall under these 6 meanings. So by next Sutra, we can't have Ichha artha for ling, Ichhet will not be possible because it doesn't represent the 6 vidhyadi meanings.

Ambiguity: Does this mean only these 6 words or the other verbs which fall under Vidhyadi, say AamantraNa artha can be represented by Aavahana as well. So can ling be added as lakar in \[ Aa (upapada) Hu dhaatu? \]  
  
By this written by Neeleshji, I think it isnt possible.  
【And even there, the application is limited to the verbs that directly represent these six meanings, and not for the verbs that represent these six meaning using negation or other qualifiers (because the vidhi-etc must characterize the actual dhatu, and not its visheshana).】

SECOND paksha is much clearer.  
  
Pratyayartha can only represent either karta karma or bhaava which can't be Vidhyadi arthas. And as you said the Dvivachana/bahuvavachana issues as well occur.

THIRD paksha says that (I maybe wrong)  
  
Prakrityarthavisheshanam means the lakar will only be used as additional VisheshaNa to dhatu, but lakar wont represent actually, the same dhatu, that is, it can't represent itself.  
  
\_\_\_\_  
  
Means Lakara can represent Vidhi artha as an adjective for Bhoo. I used ling in Vidhi artha Visheshana for Bhoo, and made it Bhavet. But i can't use the same Dhatu (Vi upapad Dha dhatu) in the same Vidhi meaning. Means Vidhi artha wont be adjective for the same Prakriti, that is itself? Am I correct?

FOURTH is also clearer.  
  
We can say that Vidhyadi is just adjective of the Pratyay so it is just additional support in the kartadi artha of the Pratyay. And it can have no issues of prakriti, because it is not going to hinder it or have any sorts of baadha.

PS.  
I respect Koradaji and his (your) vidvatta very much for margadarshan. It is difficult to find such vidvans today, tha ks to Hari and internet approach for connectivity.  
  
Also, Neeleshji, why don't you post this on some blog of yours and add link to [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com) site? Or post this in the english meaning section? That site has been very helpful for me. I now and then refer to it, once all Sutras are updated, i feel it will be a great achievement in Sanskrit Jagat, especially for struggling students like me. Thank you for taking so much effort in making it. \_/\\\_.
