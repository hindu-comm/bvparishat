Namaste to all Schollars.  
  
I'm not understanding the 4 types of Pakshas in this Sutra. Prakrityartha, Pratyayartha, Prakrityartha-visheshanam and Pratyayartha-visheshanam. What do these 4 Pakshas mean and why is Pratyayartha-visheshanam accepted?  
  
This Shastrartha has not been addressed in Kaumudi, but in Kashika and Padamanjari. Kashika says:  
विध्यादिष्वर्थेषु धातोः लिङ् प्रत्ययो भवति। सर्वलकाराणाम् अपवादः। विध्यादयश्च प्रत्ययार्थविशेषणम्। विध्यादिविशिष्टेषु कर्त्रादिषु लिङ् प्रत्ययो भवति।  
  
Even though I read Nyasa and Padamanjari many times, I couldn't really understand it properly.  
  
Please explain to me it's meaning.  
Regards  
Rishi.
