Thanks Sri Sundareswaranji:

  

I will search in MS too.

  

But I am positive it is part of the main text of the Padmapurana since it comes in all editions the original and the verse by verse translations.

  

The mantra appears as part of a series of conversations between Brahma and Narada.

The exact position is 145th verse of the 46th chapter.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
