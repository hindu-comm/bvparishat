Dear Shri Venkat,

I presume that the passage quoted by the puranakara is not a mantra, but one of the remembrance(r)-passages that are usually attached at the end of a unit ( अनुवाक, खण्ड, प्रश्न etc.) in the Vedic texts. This is usually made by heart in the oral tradition. I further venture to make a conjecture that this particular passage is from Maitrayaniya Shakha.

This is only an अभ्यूह. Still I suggest that an attempt may be made in this direction.

nks
