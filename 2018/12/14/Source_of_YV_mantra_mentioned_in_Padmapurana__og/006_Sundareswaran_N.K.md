But I am positive it is part of the main text of the Padmapurana since it comes in all editions the original and the verse by verse translations.

What is meant is not that the Padmapurana passage is not a part of the main text. The mantra the source of which you are searching may not be apart of any Vedic text proper, that is what I meant. And what I apprehend is that it may be a passage outside the proper text of some Vedashakha, probably Maitrayani. In the Vedic tradition, for remembering the sequence of several units of Vedic texts, Vaidikas construct some passages with the initial words of each unit. Such passages are appended to the Vedic text proper even in the printed texts. And they are made by heart by Vedic Pandits.
