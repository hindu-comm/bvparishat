When I was working on my MPhil dissertation I went to Mr. Lokesh Chandra's house in search of this book. The book is out of print. Mr. Chandra showed me the only copy of it that he had. But he was for some reason reluctant to allow me copying it.

  

Fortunately, I found the book in Kalanidhi, the library of the IGNCA. The library doesn't allow photocopying a book entirely. I have the photocopy of some parts of it.

  

Sudip contacted me on Facebook. I sent him the image of the page he required.
