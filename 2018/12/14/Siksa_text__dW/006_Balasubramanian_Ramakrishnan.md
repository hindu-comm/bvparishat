The siksa-sangrahaH is a collection of texts asscociated with the shuklayajus. Venkatji may be more interested in the kRShNayajus. We talked about Lokesh Chandra’s book a while back when I asked a question about the sarvasammata sikShA. Prof. Deshpande had a description of the contents. I had also provided a link to google books, not very legible. At that time Deeproji had also participated in the thread.
