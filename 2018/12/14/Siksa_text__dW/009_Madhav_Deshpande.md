Lokesh Chandra's book is titled "Sanskrit Texts on Phonetics." The book was published from New Delhi in 1921 in the Śatapiṭaka series, and the cover page says: "reproduced by Lokesh Chandra from the papers of the late Prof. RaghuVira." It is photographic representation of hand written copies of 17 Śikṣās \[some with commentaries\] from manuscripts. A book of 696 pages is useful, but gives no details of the original manuscripts from which these copies were made. From the changing hand writing styles, it appears that copies were made by several different individuals. I have the print copy, but not a pdf to share. \[I think my previous message did not go through because the included picture of the contents page made it too large.\]
