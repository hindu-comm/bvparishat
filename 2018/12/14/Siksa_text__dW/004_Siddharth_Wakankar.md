Deepro regularly writes on BVP and his surname is Chatterji or Chakravarti or like that.

  

He is my student and he must have finished his work on Shikshas.

  

The other scholar apart from Dr.Nirmala is our regular member,Dr.Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay from Kolkata.

They will be in a better

position to guide us.

  

Best luck in your search.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
