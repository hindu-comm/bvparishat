Could anyone please identify the source of this 'subhashita' shloka?  

  

क्षुत्तृडाशा: कुटुम्बिन्यो मयि जीवति नान्यगा: \|

तासामाशा महासाध्वी कदाचिन्मां न मुञ्चति \|\|

  

Hunger, Thirst (Trut) and desire (Aasha) are like man's three wives. Until he is alive these three will never leave him or go elsewhere. In comparison of the three, desire (Aasha) is a 'MahaSaadhvi' because it NEVER EVER leaves the man. Unlike hunger and thirst which disappear for some time after eating /drinking, desire is the thing which never disappears from man's mind.

  

Thanks
