In the Vishnupurana Amsha 6, chapter 7, occurs a verse:

  

तदेकावयवं देवं चेतसा हि पुनर्बुधः ।

  

कुर्य्यात्ततोऽवयविनिप्रणिधानपरो भवेत्।।

  

The number of the verse differs across editions, though.

  

The above reading is found in the commentaries of Sridhara Swamin and Vishnuchitta (Vishsishtadvaita). However, a different reading is found cited in the ancient Vachaspati Mishra's Tattvavaisharadi on the Patanjala Yoga darshanam (see the last shloka cited here):

The above is verified in two other editions of the Tattvavaisharadi and also confirmed by another book on the Vallabhacharya doctrine:

  

VACHANAMRIT BRAHM RASAYAN BHASHYAM PART 1 SECTION 2: SANSKRIT  
By SWAMI KRISHNAVALLABHACHARYA GUJRAT

The above book even elucidates on the 'aham' upasana in this verse.

  

It is evident that the verse has undergone change/s over a period of time. Could scholars here share their opinion on this? Vachaspati Misra is admitted to be of the 8 or 9th century CE. Sridhara Swamin is of the 13/14 CE.

  

Thanks and warm regards
