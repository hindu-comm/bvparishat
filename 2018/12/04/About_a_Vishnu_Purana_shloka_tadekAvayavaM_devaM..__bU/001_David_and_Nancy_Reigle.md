Dear Subbu ji,

  

The variant reading for the verse from the Vishnu-purana that you found as quoted in Vachaspati Mishra's sub-commentary (on Yoga-sutra 3.6) makes an interesting question. I have checked the critical edition of the Visnupuranam, edited by M. M. Pathak and published by the Oriental Institute, Vadodara (2 volumes, 1997, 1999). The verse as you gave it at the beginning of your email (= Venkatesvara Press edition, 6.7.90) is the same in the critical edition (there 6.7.89). None of the variant readings given there have the aham phrases. So none of the old Visnu-purana manuscripts used for the critical edition have the version quoted by Vachaspati Mishra. Rather surprising.

  

Best wishes,
