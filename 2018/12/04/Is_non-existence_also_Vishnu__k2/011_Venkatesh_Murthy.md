Namaste

  

In Advaita Vedanta this is well known. For a dull person the Universe is Sat, Real and for a inquisitive person Mumukshu the Universe is Anirvachaniya, not Sat and not Asat. But for a realized person the Universe is finally Asat only. The All pervading Vishnu is both Sat and Asat means He is Brahman-Sat and He is Universe-Asat also. This means He is Brahman but He is appearing as Universe.
