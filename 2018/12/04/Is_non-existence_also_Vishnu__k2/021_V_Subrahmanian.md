One instance of 'asat' to denote that which has not manifested, in the Taittiriya Upanishad, Brahmanandavalli 7th anuvaka:

  

असद्वा इदमग्र आसीत्। ततो वै सदजायत। तदात्मानं स्वयमकुरुत।

  

**English Translation By Swami Gambirananda**

।।2.7.1।। In the beginning all this was but the unmanifested (Brahman). From that emerged the manifested. That Brahman created Itself by Itself.

  

The Bhashya there is:

  

असद्वाइदमग्र आसीत्। असदिति व्याकृतनामरूपविशेषविपरीतरूपम् अव्याकृतं ब्रह्म उच्यते ; न पुनरत्यन्तमेवासत्। न ह्यसतः सज्जन्मास्ति। इदम् इति नामरूपविशेषवद्व्याकृतं जगत् ; अग्रे पूर्वं प्रागुत्पत्तेः ब्रह्मैव असच्छब्दवाच्यमासीत्। ततः असतः वै सत् प्रविभक्तनामरूपविशेषम् अजायत उत्पन्नम्। किं ततः प्रविभक्तं कार्यमिति - पितुरिव पुत्रः ? नेत्याह। तत् असच्छब्दवाच्यं स्वयमेव आत्मानमेव अकुरुत कृतवत्...

  

**English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda**

।।2.7.1।।.Asat vai idam agre asit, in the beginning all this was but the unmanifested (Brahman). By the word asat is meant the unmanifested state of Brahman as contrasted with the state in which distinctions of name and form become manifested. Not that absolute non-existence (the root meaning of the word, asat) is meant, for the existent cannot come out of the non-existent. Idam, this standing for the manifested world possessed of the distinctions of name and form; agre, in the beginning-before creation; asit asat, was but Brahman that could be called asat. Tatah, from that-from that Unmanifested; vai, indeed; sat, that which is distinguished by manifested name and form; ajayata, was born. Is the effect entirely separate from that (cause), just as a son is from the father? The answer is being given negatively: Tat, that which is called the Unmanifested (Brahman); svayam, Itself; akuruta, created; atmanam, Itself.
