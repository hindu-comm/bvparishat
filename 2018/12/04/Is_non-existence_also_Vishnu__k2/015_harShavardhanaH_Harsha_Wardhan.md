Respected scholars,

  

Here in the instt case, Vishnu is taken to be synonymous with Brahman  

  

In the light of the main issue, a related point that troubles me is this: etymologically, the word Brahma(n) approximately means "that which grows" (1)  

  

Vedantic exegesis takes Brahman to be the alpha and omega of everything. So, Brahman can also be understood as "that which contracts" (2)

  

The Vedanta implies (1) + (2) = two aspects of Brahman (Sat and Asat) (Manifest and Unmanifest) (NOT in the Samkhyan sense)

  

Given this, what is the most proper definition of the term Brahman?

  

regards

Harsha

  

  

  

So, does the characterization
