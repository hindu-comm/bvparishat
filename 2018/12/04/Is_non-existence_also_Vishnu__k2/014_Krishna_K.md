I just searched across my files. There are other instances of 'sadasat' prayoga as samahara:

Bhagavata 10th skandha :kathaM charanti shrutayaH sAxAt \*sadasataH\* pare

2nd skandha:shashvat prashAntam abhayaM pratibodhamAtraM shuddhaM samaM \*sadasataH\* paramAtmatatvam

Garuda Purana:paraH kAlAt paro yajnAt paraH sadasatashcha yaH

  

Regards,

Krishna
