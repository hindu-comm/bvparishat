//Actually vyakta and avyakta cover only the totality of creation in its manifest and unmanifest form. The case of pot....is within creation and they are transacted by the terms sat and asat: asti ghaTaH and nAsti ghaTaH. //  
  
  
asti ghaTaH - the ghaTa is manifest at certain place and time.  
  
nAsti ghaTah - if the ghaTa is not created yet, it is not manifest currently (again, sat kArya vAda implies, ghaTa is not asat).
