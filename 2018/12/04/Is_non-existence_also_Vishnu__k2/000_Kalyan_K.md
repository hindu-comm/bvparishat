In the Adi parva of Mahabharata, we find the following verses on Vishnu, pregnant with meaning -  
  
आद्यं पुरुषमीशानं पुरुहूतं पुरुष्टुतम् \|  
ऋतमेकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्यक्ताव्यक्तं सनातनम् \|\|२०\|\|  
  
असच्च सच्चैव च यद्विश्वं सदसतः परम् \|  
परावराणां स्रष्टारं पुराणं परमव्ययम् \|\|२१\|\|  
  
मङ्गल्यं मङ्गलं विष्णुं वरेण्यमनघं शुचिम् \|  
नमस्कृत्य हृषीकेशं चराचरगुरुं हरिम् \|\|२२\|\|  
  
  
Van Buitenen's translation -  
  
//I bow to the Primeval Person the Lord, widely invoked and lauded, who is the True, the One-Syllabled Brahman, manifest and unmanifest, everlasting, at once the existent and the nonexistent, Creator of things high and low. I bow to Him who is the Ancient One, supreme, imperishable, blissful and blessing, the most desirable Visnu, faultless and resplendent, who is Krsna Hrsikesa, the preceptor of all creatures, those that move and those that move not; the God Hari.//  
  
  
It is understandable to say that Vishnu is existent. But the verses praise Vishnu as both existent and non-existent. (Here non-existence cannot be avyakta or unmanifest, since that is already mentioned separately.) How do understand the saying that Vishnu is both existence and non-existence?
