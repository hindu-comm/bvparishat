Namaste  
  
Any explanation that says "sat" refers to brahman, in this context, is unsatisfactory in my opinion, since brahman is already mentioned in the verse.  
  
ऋतमेकाक्षरं \*\*ब्रह्म\*\* व्यक्ताव्यक्तं सनातनम् \|\|२०\|\|  
  
Any explanation that says "asat" refers to universe is also unsatisfactory to me, since the universe is covered by vyakta and avyakta.  
  
May be sat means true? asat means false? Here I use true and false as epistemological terms and not ontological terms. But if sat means true, then the question is what does Rtam mean?

Kalyan
