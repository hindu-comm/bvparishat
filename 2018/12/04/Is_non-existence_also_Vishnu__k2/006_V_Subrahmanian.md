I am not saying that the two words mean manifest and unmanifest. What I have meant is:

  

13.13 I shall speak of that which is to be known, by realizing which one attains Immortality. The supreme Brahman is without any beginning. That is called neither being nor non-being.

  

In the commentary Shankara says:यद्धिइन्द्रियगम्यंवस्तुघटादिकम्,तत्अस्तिबुद्ध्यनुगतप्रत्ययविषयंवास्यात्,नास्तिबुद्ध्यनुगतप्रत्ययविषयंवास्यात्।इदंतुज्ञेयम्अतीन्द्रियत्वेनशब्दैकप्रमाणगम्यत्वात्नघटादिवत्उभयबुद्ध्यनुगतप्रत्ययविषयम्इत्यतः‘नसत्तन्नासत्’इतिउच्यते॥

  

That which is perceptible, like a pot, can be either 'sat' (when a pot has been produced, it is spoken of 'the pot is'.) or 'asat' (when the pot is destroyed/or not produced yet, it is spoken of 'it is not.'). Brahman is neither of these since the possibility of 'is' and 'is not' in the above sense does not arise at all.

  

The above is different from manifest-unmanifest pair.

  

This seems to be the best fit for the MB verses.
