Dear Subrahmanian sir  
  
If I understand you correctly, you are essentially saying that "asat" here means "unmanifest" or "avyakta". I am aware of such an interpretation, having been familiar with Shankara bhAshyas. However, such an interpretation does not look convincing to me in this context, since vyakta and avyakta are already mentioned separately in the verses, as I observed in the original post.
