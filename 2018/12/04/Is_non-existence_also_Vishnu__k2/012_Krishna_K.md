Namaste,

  

असच्च सच्चैव च यद्विश्वं सदसतः परम् \|  

can be interpreted as

yadvishvaM sachhaiva asachchaiva, tatsadasataH paraM (brahma)

  

That Universe, which comprises sat (existent) and asat (non-existent) - Brahman is superior / different from that sadasat (universe).

VB's interpretation seems to have ignored 'sadasatah param'.

  

It is also possible to interpret sat as saadhu (sadbhAve sAdhubhAve cha sad ityetatprayujyate - gita 17.26) or mUrta.

  

Regards,

Krishna
