//That which is perceptible, like a pot, can be either 'sat' (when a pot has been produced, it is spoken of 'the pot is'.) or 'asat' (when the pot is destroyed/or not produced yet, it is spoken of 'it is not.'). Brahman is neither of these since the possibility of 'is' and 'is not' in the above sense does not arise at all.//  
  
  
Isn't it the case that in sat-kArya vAda, which Shankara subscribes to, the effect is already existent in the cause? The pot is therefore not "asat" before it is produced, since the pot is already existent in its cause. (In nyAya terminology, the pot has prAg abhAva before its production.) The pot is only avyakta, as it has not manifested itself before its production.  
  
Moreover, you say brahman is neither of these, whereas the Mahabharata verses that I quoted say that Vishnu is both sat and asat.
