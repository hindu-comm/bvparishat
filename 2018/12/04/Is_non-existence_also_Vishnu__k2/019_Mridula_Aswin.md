An upādāna-kāranam is a cause, that being inherent in its effect, also exists independently. Since Brahman is the upādāna-kāranam of jagat, it is at once both sat and asat, since jagat is known through these two concepts. At the same time, Brahman is also beyond these. This is elucidated by Bhartrhari in the following kārikā from Sambandha Samuddesa, Padakānda, Vākyapadīyam:

नाभावो जायते भावो नैति भावोऽनुपाख्यताम्।

एकस्मादात्मनोऽनन्यौ भावाभावौ विकल्पितौ।।६१।।
