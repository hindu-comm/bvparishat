Namaste Sri Krishnaji  
  
//can be interpreted as  
yadvishvaM sachhaiva asachchaiva, tatsadasataH paraM (brahma)//  
  
Dont you have to supply an extra word "tat" here, which is not present in the verse?  
  
  
//It is also possible to interpret sat as saadhu (sadbhAve sAdhubhAve cha sad ityetatprayujyate - gita 17.26) or mUrta.//  
  
If you interpret sat as sAdhu/good, then asat will become its opposite, bad. But the verse says, Vishnu is anagha/faultless. How do you reconcile this?  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
