श्री गुरुभ्यो नमः।  
Firstly I profusely thank Vidvan Subramanian mahodaya for giving the relevant extracts from Sānkarabhāshya of Gītā and Prasnopanishad, which shed light on the variant interpretations of sat and asat.  
In this connection I wish to put forth the theory of atyanta-abhāva according to the Navya-Naiyāyikas. Most scholars consider only the absence known through the locative case, as विशेष्य-विशेषणभाव, as atyanta-abhāva. Then the etymological meaning, i.e. अत्यन्तं - सर्वथा - absolute absence or non-existence would be contradicted.  
Since Navya-Nyāya deals only with real cognizables, and absolute non-existence which is not cognized in the physical realm, it automatically is considered as unreal, viz., शशविषाणं, वन्ध्यापुत्रः etc. Such purely intellectual (bauddha) padārthas warrant discussion in another thread.  
This idea finds expression in Sankarācārya's bhāshyam, when he says that the parabrahma is both sat and asat. Here asat is not absolute non-existence. It is only of the form of prāk/pradhvamsa/anyonya/viseshyaviseshanabhāva abhāva.  
The same concept may be extrapolated to the Nāsadīyasūktam, where an absolute nothingness before the moment of creation is incomprehensible by the mundane intellect.  
I request Acāryas to kindly give their valuable insights in this context.
