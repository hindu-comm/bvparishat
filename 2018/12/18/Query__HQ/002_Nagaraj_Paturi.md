Your inclination and potential is one factor.

  

But you should first check past research on Agnipurana. It is a highly researched and discussed Purana. So you might end up reinventing the wheel or working on a beaten track if you don't check.

  

Ideally , never start with a specific book and start looking for a topic.

  

You might have come across some intriguing aspects during your studies.You must check if those questions are already answered. If they are not answered or if the answers given so far to them are not satisfactory, they become your ideal research topics.
