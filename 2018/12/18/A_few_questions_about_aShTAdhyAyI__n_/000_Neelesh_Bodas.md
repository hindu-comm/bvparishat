नमांसि विद्वांसः !

  

I have a few questions onअष्टाध्यायी of Panini, scholars may please throw some light.

  

1\. Was the name अष्टाध्यायी given by Panini ? Or did he use the word शब्दानुशासन and then someone else (who?) started using the term अष्टाध्यायी?

  

2. Is it correct that अष्टाध्यायी was designed as a संहितापाठ? If so, who divided the work into 8 अध्यायाः \* 4 पादाः ?

  

3\. Was entire अष्टाध्यायीrecited as एकश्रुति (as per युधिष्ठिर मीमांसक) ? If so what does स्वरितेनाधिकारः mean? And who added the swara markings?

  

  

Thanks

Neelesh
