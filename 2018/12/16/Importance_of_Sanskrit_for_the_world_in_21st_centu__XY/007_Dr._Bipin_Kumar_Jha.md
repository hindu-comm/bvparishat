Thank You sir for such bifurcation initially.

I have lectures for foreign students who are not aware with Sanskrit at all but they are interested. I have read several articles and viewed several interviews of the great scholars. of course they glorify the language but I am not satisfied. I belong to the Sanskrit family, I could understand the spirit but I wish to convey the message which will
join their heart to Bharatbhumi as well Sanskrit.
