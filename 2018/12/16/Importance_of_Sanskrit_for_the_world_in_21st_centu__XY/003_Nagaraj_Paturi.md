Dear Dr Bipin Kumar Jha,

  

You need to distinguish between

**  
**

1\. importance of Sanskrit (as a) language for the world in 21st century

  

and

  

2\. importance of texts (written and oral) or knowledge expressed in Sanskrit for the world in 21st century

  

-----------------------------------------

  

Though there is a scope to talk about #1 above too and though other members may add their views on that

  

we can tell you that we are bringing out a lot of material in terms of #2 above.

  

I shall respond further once I know your specific interest among the two above.
