Namaste

  

The religion and philosophy of the Aajivika seems to have been quite vibrant: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80j%C4%ABvika>

  

//**Ajivika**([IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAST "IAST"):***Ājīvika***) is one of the[nāstika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80stika_and_n%C4%81stika "Āstika and nāstika")or "heterodox" schools of[Indian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy "Indian philosophy").^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80j%C4%ABvika#cite_note-natalia-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80j%C4%ABvika#cite_note-james-3))Purportedly founded in the 5th century BCE by[Makkhali Gosala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makkhali_Gosala "Makkhali Gosala"), it was a[śramaṇa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Arama%E1%B9%87a "Śramaṇa")movement and a major rival of[early Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Buddhism "Early Buddhism")and[Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism "Jainism").^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80j%C4%ABvika#cite_note-4))Ājīvikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete communities.^([\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80j%C4%ABvika#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBasham1951145-146-5))

Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost.//

  

A question arises as to why this system has not been taken up for refutation in the Vedanta sutras of Badarayana, especially while the Buddhist and Jain systems have been. Has any Acharya who has commented on the Brahma sutras spoken of the Aajivika? To myknowledge the commentary of Shankara does not.
