The Ajivika are believed to have possessed a collection of [scriptures](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Scripture), based on references made to such a collection in Jaina sources.[\[1\]](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ajivika#cite_note-0)Of these purported scriptures, the only surviving portions are scattered verses in Buddhist and Jain sources that seem to represent quotations from the Ajivika scriptures.[\[2\]](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ajivika#cite_note-1) The Ajivika scriptures were ever committed to writing, and their contents are unknown outside of these fragmentary quotations. Additionally, there are lists of Ajivika titles recorded in non-Ajivika sources.[\[3\]](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ajivika#cite_note-2)  
  
One such list collected by a Jaina commentator identifies the primary collections of Ajivika texts as follows:  
Divyam (of the divine)  
Autpātam (of portents)  
Bhaumam (of the earth)  
Āngam (of the body)  
Svāram (of sound)  
Lākşanam (of characteristics)  
Vyāñjanam (of indications)[\[4\]](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ajivika#cite_note-3)
