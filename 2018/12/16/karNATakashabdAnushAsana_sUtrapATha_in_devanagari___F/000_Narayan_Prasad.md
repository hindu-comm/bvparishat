Dear scholars,

 Please find attached the कर्णाटकशब्दानुशासन सूत्रपाठ. कर्णाटकशब्दानुशासन, although a Kannada grammar, was composed in Sanskrit by Bhattakalanka Deva in 1604 AD. It contains 592 sutras and स्वोपज्ञ वृति called भाषा-मञ्जरी and the व्याख्या called मञ्जरी-मकरन्द. It was published (in Kannada and Roman scripts) first by B. Lewis Rice in 1890. It was re-edited and published (in Kannada script) by R. Narasimhachar in 1923.

 I came to know about it first through a lesson in "कन्नड भाषा प्रवेश" (1973) \[page attached\].

 Hope, it will be useful for some researchers.

 Regards

 Narayan Prasad
