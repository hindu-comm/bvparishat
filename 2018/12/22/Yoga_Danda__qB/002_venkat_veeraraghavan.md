Dear Shri Harshaji:

  

Thank you for the information about Yogadanda.

  

Swara shastra clearly indicates that continued flow of swara in one nostril can result in disease or worse. So please bear that caution in mind.

  

I hope you have someone to guide you in this space and you are not on some personal unsupervised quest (these usually don't end well).

As for the danda itself buy any that is slightly smaller than required and you can adjust the required height by placing a cloth under or on top of the staff as required.

  

Venkat
