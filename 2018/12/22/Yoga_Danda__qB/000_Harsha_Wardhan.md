Namaskar to all,

  

The Yoga Danda is a T-shaped wooden stick used by yoga practitioners to balance nostril-dominance in pranayama practice. Photos below:

In order for it to be properly useful, it has to be custom-made according to the exact sitting height of the practitioner concerned.

  

There are some commercially available ones in India, but they come in standard sizes which reduce their utility. I have spoken to a few, and they do not do custom pieces.

  

Now, this is a long shot, but do you know of any manufacturers in India who manufacture yoga dandas to custom specifications? In or around Hyderabad, preferably?  

  

And the last alternative is to engage a carpenter locally, of course.  

  

Any guidance would be gratefully received.  

  

  

with kind regards

Harsha
