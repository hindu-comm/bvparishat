I chanced to see a verse in the YuddhakaaNda of the Valmiki Ramayana which appears to be a variation of the above unidentified verse :

  

``` 6082024a रुद्रो वा यदि वा विष्णुर्महेन्द्रो वा शतक्रतुः
```

6082024c हन्ति नो रामरूपेण यदि वा स्वयमन्तकः

  

The verse appears in the Piramal Publication of Yuddhakanda in the 94th sarga:
