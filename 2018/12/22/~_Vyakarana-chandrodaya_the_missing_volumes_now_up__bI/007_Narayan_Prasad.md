\<\<A person who studies Kaumudi, is it required for him to read these 5 books?>\>

  

So far as प्रक्रिया is concerned, presentation of grammar is much better inव्याकरण चन्द्रोदय compared to any कौमुदी works.

If smb is not interested in knowing the rules and hurriedly wants to know the word forms, one can also do it by just mugging up from the tables provided (esp. in Vol.3, dealing withतिङन्त, and vol.4, dealing with सुबन्त).

  

Best wishes

Narayan Prasad
