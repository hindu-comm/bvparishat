Again - end of a sentence versus in the middle. Please listen carefully to the Chellakare brothers chanting rudram starting at 4:07 point:

  

"si_vaa "sa!ra_vyaa! yaa tava\_ tayA!no rudra m.r.daya \|

See if you are able to distinguish the last "a" which sounds vivR^ita due to euphony. You cannot elongate and at the same time maintain sa.mvR^ita. I have seen some older amateurs, especially who read some sUtra-s at the same time as trying to learn some vedas, trying to pronounce the last as sa.mvR^ita with disastrous results. I have found that you just cannot correct these people, they just refuse to listen, because they have read sUtra-s you see. Again this carries over to single words.
