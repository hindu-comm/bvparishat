The issue is between halant(a) and ajant(a) pronunciation while reciting Sanskrit verses.

  

The thread initiator's observation seems to be about pronouncing Sanskrit verse-lines such as

  

सर्व मंगल मांगल्ये

  

as

  

सर्व् मंगल् मांगल्ये

  

It is indeed observed in the pronunciation of Sanskrit verses in Hindi movies , Hindi serials etc.
