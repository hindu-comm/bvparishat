नमस्ते

  

Sorry, if this question has already been discussed, however I could not find how to search this in our group for older posts.

  

My question:

  

Why is that some people pronounce the words like राम as राम् , कृष्ण as कृष्ण् ? Is this the correct pronunciation?

  

Is this pronunciation same in Sanskrit and Hindi for the word राम and कृष्ण?

  

  

  

धन्यवाद,
