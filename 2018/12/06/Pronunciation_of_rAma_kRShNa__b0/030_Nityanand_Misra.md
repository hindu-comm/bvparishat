Yes, but the -n and -m suffix are commonly used with Sanskrit names in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Just like the non-Sanskrit suffixes -appa and -aiah are commonly used with Sanskrit names in some parts, e.g. Shivappa, Nijalingappa, Virappa, Ramaiah, etc.

Could there be linguistic reasons also? What is the frequency of terminal vowels in native (non-Sanskrit) words in say Telugu? Does the hrasva a have a high frequency? I have heard and observed many Telugu words end with -u.Even Sanskrit words are adapted to reflect this effect, for example *veda* becomes *vedamu* and the Telugu translation of Ramacharitamanasa of Tulasidasa published by Gita Press is calledశ్రీరామచరితమానసము (श्रीरामचरितमानसमु) and not శ్రీ రామచరిత మానస (श्रीरामचरितमानस). Perhaps some analysis of statistical frequency of terminal vowels might help here?

I do not think the discussion is on pronouncing Sanskrit verses, but on Sanskrit words. Sanskrit verses are completely different as they are metrical and usually chanted/pronounced with a rhythm, and so the pronunciation is more likely to be correct. For example, while pronouncing/singing श्रीराम राम शरणं भव राम राम, if any of the occurrences of राम is mispronounced as रां/राम्, the chanter/singer will be out of sync. The same is applicable to metrical poetry in Awadhi and Hindi. While reading/chanting/singing the Awadhi line राम राम कहि राम कहि राम राम कहि राम (Manasa 2.155), experienced readers/chanters/singers will pronounce राम correctly (Mukesh sings with the correct pronunciation in his rendition of the Ayodhyakanda). Similarly, while reading the प्रिय प्रवास of अयोध्या सिंह उपाध्याय 'हरिऔध', a verse in the द्रुतविलम्बित metre like the opening verse दिवस का अवसान समीप था will be recited/sung correctly by a Hindi poetry reader otherwise the rhythm will be broken. The discussion is on pronunciation of Sanskrit words in non-Sanskrit languages. Why would my name be spelled Nityanand and not Nityananda in official documents(in my books I spell it as Nityananda) and your name be spelt Nagaraj and not Nagaraja in official documents if it were not for schwa syncope in Hindi and Telugu speakers?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
