Dear Sir,

  

The अ a in राम can be omitted in pronounciation but अ a in कृष्ण can not be omitted as ष्ण is conjunct letter.

  

Here is a famous Hindi Bhajan song:

  

कृष्ण गोविन्द गोपाल गाते रहो ।

  

In the below song, Swamiji has clearly sung as कृष्ण retaining अ a.

Also अ a is retained in गोपाल also in the song.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
