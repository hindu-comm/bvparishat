NamaskaaraDr S R Ivaturi ji,

  

      Your examples do **seem** correct, but I am sure no Hindi speaker drops अ in नमक. So the rule needs to be stated more precisely. I do not work in the area of speech, though I was aware that second अ is dropped in जनता.

  

      By the way I know a Telugu person named रामबाबु who writes his name in Telugu which turns out to beequivalent to रांबाबु ! I do not think that Hindi speaker pronouncesरामबाबु asराम्बाबु . My conjecture would be that in such cases Hindi speakers pronounce something like हृस्व-हृस्व अ. Would you agree?

  

Regards
