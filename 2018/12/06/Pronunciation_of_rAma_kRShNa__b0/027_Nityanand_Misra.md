The phenomenon of schwa deletion, due to which Sanskrit राम is pronounced in many northern languages without the terminal vowel as राम्, is not limited to Hindi. It is seen to a great degree in many northern and western Indian languages and perhaps even in the east. It is well documented and there is a Wikipedia article onSchwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages which one can read. In this post, I would like to point out that this phenomenon of schwa syncope is, contrary to views expressed by some members in this thread, also seen in southern Indian languages today, in both spelling and pronunciation. I do not know the history of when and how schwa syncope started in the south, but when it comes to Sanskrit names, the phenomenon is pretty obvious today.  

  

Let us start with Kerala. Sanskrit names are often suffixed with a terminal n, e.g. Raman, Gopalan, etc. Where they are not, they are many a time written (and pronounced) by dropping the final a. Here are examples, taken from the current list of MLAs in Kerala. Examples where the final a is dropped: I. B. Sathish, O. Rajagopal, V. S. Sivakumar, G. S. Jayalal, M. Mukesh, K. B. Ganesh Kumar, Chittayam Gopakumar, Adoor Prakash, R. Rajesh, Ramesh Chennithala, N. Jayaraj, K. Suresh Kurup, M. Swaraj, V. R. Sunil Kumar, C. Raveendranath, V. S. Sunil Kumar, Anil Akkara, U. R. Pradeep, K. V. Vijayadas, V. T. Balram, A. P. Anil Kumar, A. Pradeepkumar, T. V. Rajesh. Note how Sat\[h\]ish, Kumar, Ganesh, Sunil, etc are spelt exactly how they would be spelt in northern India. Now let us take the example of V. T. Balram. The name is obviously the Sanskrit word*balarāma* (बलराम or ബലരാമ). His name is written in Malayalam on the Malayalam Wikipedia as ബൽറാം (बल्रां). Not ല but ൽ and not മ but ം. Schwa deleted in both*bala*and*rāma.*

  

Now move on to Tamil Nadu. The famous journalist of Kasturi family spells his name as Narasimhan Ram. Not Rama, but Ram. On the Tamil Wikipedia, his name is spelt as ராம் (राम्), and not ராம (राम). This thread started with how राम is pronounced, and here is an example from the south where the name राम is written \[and pronounced\] as राम्. Look at the list of members of the Tamil Nadu assembly and you will either see an m or n added to the final a in Sanskrit names or the final a being dropped, for example in case of names like Vijayakumar K S, Jayakumar D, Sekar Babu P K, Mohan M. K., Nataraj R., Aravind Ramesh S., Sundar K., Nandakumar A. P., and so on.

  

In Karnataka again, the phenomenon is common. The busts of the late thespian Dr. Rajkumar are installed at many places in Bengaluru. Everywhere, his name is spelt in Kannada as ಡಾ. ರಾಜ್‌ (राज्) or ಡಾ. ರಾಜ್‌ಕುಮಾರ್ (राज् कुमार्). I have not seen the spelling ರಾಜಕುಮಾರ being used for him. One can easily infer how the name is pronounced. Looking at names of members of Karnataka assembly, one will find Aihole Duryodhan Mahalingappa, D. S. Suresh, B. C. Nagesh, S. Suresh Kumar, G. B. Jyothi Ganesh, Jayaram A. S., R. Shankar, and so on. In Kannada, the name Suresh is spelt \[and pronounced\] as ಸುರೇಶ್‌ (सुरेश्), Nagesh as ನಾಗೇಶ್‌ (नागेश्), etc, on the official website of Karnataka legislature. The terminal a of the Sanskrit word is deleted in all these cases in writing and pronuciation.

  

Finally, come to Telugu speaking states of Telangana and Andhra. Going through names of Telangana MLAs one would see Diwakar Rao Nadipelli, Allolla Indra Karan Reddy, Gaddigari Vittal Reddy, Ashannagari Jeevan Reddy, Srinivas Reddy Parige, Bigala Ganesh, Gangula Kamalakar, Tammannagari Ram Mohan Reddy, etc. Note the spellings Diwakar, Karan, Vittal, Jeevan, Srinivas, Ganesh, Kamalakar, Ram, Mohan. Pawan Kalyan spells his name in Telugu as పవన్ కళ్యాణ్ and not పవన కళ్యాణ. Google search for "పవన్ కళ్యాణ్" gets 22 lakh hits, that for "పవన కళ్యాణ" gets 317 hits. Winners of the Andhra Pradesh assembly election in 2014 included names like Ashok Bendalam, Gouthu Syam Sunder Sivaji, Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar, Pendurthi Venkatesh, etc.

  

The difference I see with the terminal schwa syncope in south is that it is reflected in the script also. So Sanskrit names are both spelled and pronounced incorrectly while the phoneticity of the script is preserved, while in the north and west they are spelled correctly but pronounced incorrectly, compromising the phoneticity of the script.

  

Perhaps members of the list can shed more light on how and why this phenomenon started in the south.
