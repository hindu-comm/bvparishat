Dear Sir,

  

Here is the video of Kannada movie.

  

<https://youtu.be/XbFV7wCcEFM?t=2137>

  

at 35:55 min ramesha (रमेश) - अ a retained

at 36:19 min ramesh (रमेश्) - अ a omitted

  

If we watch a few minutes, we find that sometimes Ramesha and sometimes Ramesh is used

  

There is no consistency in using the vocative case of proper nouns.

  

Regards

Ramana Murthy
