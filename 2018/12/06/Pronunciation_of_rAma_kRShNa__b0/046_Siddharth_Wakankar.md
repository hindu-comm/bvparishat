Dear scholars,

  

I give my first hand observation.

  

In Maharashtra also,many people. pronounce the words Rama and Krishna as halantas,but,the persons hailing from Karnataka, invariably pronounce as full ma and shna.I used to recognise such Kannada.speaking persons because of this peculiar pronunciation of theirs.I think,this is a roodhi and we need not bother about its grammatical correctness or otherwise and remember the adage,शास्त्राद्रूढिः बलीयसी.
