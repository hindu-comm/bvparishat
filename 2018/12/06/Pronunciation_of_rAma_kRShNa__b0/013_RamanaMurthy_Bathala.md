Dear Sir,

  

If there is any incorrect understanding of the my previous post due to wording, I am going to repost with different words.

  

Both Hindi and English are not phonetic languages.

  

Phonetic Language: A language in which pronunciation and spelling are exactly same. In other words, what is written is pronounced exactly and vice versa.

  

English is not phonetic language: We write psychology but while pronouncing the letter "p" is silent. Hence pronunciation and spelling are different. Hence not a phonetic language.

  

Hindi is not a phonetic language: we write राम raama and we utter राम् raam while speaking. Hence speaking and writing are different. Hence not a phonetic language.

  

I hope my explanation is now clear.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
