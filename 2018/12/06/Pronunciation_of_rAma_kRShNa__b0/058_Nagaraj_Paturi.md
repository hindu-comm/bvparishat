Yes, Mr Ken. But it is , I would not say common sense, but easy to see why your 'half letters' I think you mean, pure consonants are no taught.

  

It is not easy to pronounce pure consonants. So it is for the ease of pronunciation that a vowel usually samvrit 'a' अ is added while teaching Devanagari script.

  

It is not true to say that children are not taught about का being क् + आ or कु being क् +उ etc.

  

Most teachers, while teaching बाराखडी or बारहखडी use words like आ की मात्रा, उ की मात्रा only.
