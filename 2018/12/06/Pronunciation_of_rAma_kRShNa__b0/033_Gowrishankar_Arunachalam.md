Dear Sri Nityananda ji,

Names of individuals are their choice. As Sri Bhat ji mentioned influence of English and Hindi has prompted to modify their individual name.

But while writing and speaking about Rama or krishna the tamil inflection by adding an, Raman Krishnan are adopted by all. In case of Ram it is Ramukku instead of Ramanukku. Writing and speaking in coloquial Tamil is still with Raman and Krishnan etc.

  

I am sure it is the same with Telugu or Kannada. It is Sudhakara or Sudhakar as chosen by an individual as his name.
