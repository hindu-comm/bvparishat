I will make two points:

  

1. The transliteration of a word in English has its own variations because of various reasons.

  

2. We are making an observation here on the use of an end vowel to express emotion.  

 We do not know if such endings have cultural implications. Our thinking is all expression is neurologically induced.

  

I can say more in a year.
