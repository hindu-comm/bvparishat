There is no elongation of a or anything else by at least properly trained Sanskrit chanters from the South. If there is a hrasva at the \*end of a sentence\*, it is generally pronounced longer than eka-mAtra for reasons of euphony. If there is a sudden stop at the end with a hrasva, it does not sound good. This is quite evident in Vedic recitations in the South. For example, the a-kaara at the end of the sentence in "tava\_ tayaa!no rudram.r.daya \|" will be very \*slightly\* elongated compared to the a-kaaras in tava. \*Properly\* trained chanters will similarly pronounce the dIrgha vowels \*at the end of a sentence\* very slightly more than 2 mAtra-s to avoid confusion. This carries over in their normal speech when South Indians say single words like rAma, nArAyaNa, etc. Chopping off the vowel itself as in Hindi is quite a different phenomenon.

  

People get hung up on mAtra definitions from sUtra-s etc., without properly understanding euphony etc., which can be learned \*only\* guru-mukha. I have seen people trying to do an exact eka-mAtra at the end of some of these Vedic sentences after going through sUtra-s with quite cacophonous results. A little knowledge is indeed very dangerous.

  

There is the case of some Carnatic singers rendering some shloka-s, etc. There the rules of mAtra are flouted all over the place, but that's something else.

  

In this regard, the second verse of the laghuvR^itta-ratnAkara, which provides the option of treating a hrasva at the end of a pada as dIrgha, may be applicable or at least interesting:

  

eka-mAtro bhavedhrasvaH dvimAtro dIrgha ucyate \|

sAnusvaro visargAnto dIrgho yuktaparashca yaH \|

vA padAnte tvasaU gu vakraH j\~neyo.anyo mAtrikaH l R^ijuH \|\|
