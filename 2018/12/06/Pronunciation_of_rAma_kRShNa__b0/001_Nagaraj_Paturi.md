It is well known that राम , कृष्ण are in the form of रामः , कृष्णः and they are considered to be अकारांत शब्दाः and not as हलंंत शब्दाः.

  

If a Hindi speaker while speaking Hindi pronounces राम as राम् , there is nothing wrong, since that is the way it is in Hindi.

  

But if a speaker of Hindi or any other north Indian language, while speaking Sanskrit, pronounces हे राम as हे राम् , that can be considered as a mistake committed due to mother tongue influence.
