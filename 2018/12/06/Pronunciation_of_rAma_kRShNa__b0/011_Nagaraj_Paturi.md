Dear Sri Ramana Murthy-ji,

  

If you are interested in understanding these issues scientifically as you seem to be interested in /attempting to do, you need to study /learn linguistics.

  

Statements like "English is a phonetic language" are not the established understanding in that discipline.

  

"Hindi is a phonetic language like English" is consequentially a similar not the established understanding of the discipline.

  

If you explain what you mean by a phonetic language and "English is a phonetic language" and "Hindi is a phonetic language like English", I may be able to help you.
