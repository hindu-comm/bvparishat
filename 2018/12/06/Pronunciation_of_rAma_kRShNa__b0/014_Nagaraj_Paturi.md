The term " phonetic language" in the sense in which you use them here does not exist in any established academic discipline.

  

For that matter, the term " phonetic language" does not exist in any sense in any established academic discipline.

  

Let us remember that script is not the essential feature of language. Hence script or relation between script and pronunciation can not be the basis of classification of languages.

  

But conversely scripts can be classified on the basis of how each script symbol or grapheme in that script relates to the pronunciation in that language.

  

In most Indian scripts, each grapheme represents a syllable of that language. All such scripts are called syllabic scripts.

  

In English to represent a syllable of that language one needs a sequence of graphemes. Each of those script symbols or graphemes represents a phone or phoneme of the language. Hence English script can be called phonetic/phonemic script.

  

In Devanagari, Telugu script etc., a syllable is represented by a single script symbol.

  

But In Tamil script, while representing clusters, you need a sequence of more than one script symbol. So we can say that Tamil is partly a ponemic script.

  

------------------------------------

  

In English you have consonant ending syllables. Words in English too are mostly consonant ending.

  

There are some consonant ending syllables and words in Hindi.

  

That could be the similarity that you noticed.
