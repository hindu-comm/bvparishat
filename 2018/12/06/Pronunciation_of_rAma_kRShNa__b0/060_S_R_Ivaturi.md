In South Indian languages if they pronounce a word as halanth they write it as halanth, and they write as ajantha and pronounce as ajantha. In Northern languages they write as ajantha and pronounce as halanth. We have to take it as the flavour of the language.

When a vocative has a-ending in Southern languages it is the native ajantha word. If the same is pronounced as halanth it is the halanth variation of the word.

For example the proper ajantha Telugu name is Pawana Kalyana or Pawana Kalyanudu (to be more specific). The evocative for this is Pawana Kalyana/A with the last a elongated (can be not elongated too). But now in Telugu names are used as halanth i.e Pawan Kalyan. Then the vocative will be Pawan Kalyan only. Of course even then you can use the elongated vocative Pawana Kalyana/A as it is native Telugu.
