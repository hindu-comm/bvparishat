Namaskaara Ravikishore Annadanam ji,

"At that time, a guru from Haridwar has delivered भागवत कथा. During that time he mentioned " राम् , कृष्ण् are the correct pronunciations, however south Indians tend speak राम, कृष्ण which is not correct. ". However after learning basics of संस्कृत I have realised the other way around. He had also mention that कृष्ण means Drupadi."

  

   I think the guru mast have simply pronounced the concerned words and the transcription is yours.

  

   First let me present my observations as a North Indian:

    When I hear South Indians their pronunciation of "राम" sounds to me as "रामा"!

    I also understand that we North Indians if we are not alert about it we pronounce it as "राम्"

    But I also think I can correctly pronounce "राम".

  

   I discussed these observations with my South Indian Linguist friend and have reached the following conclusion:

   1. South Indian are quite sensitive about मात्रा or duration of the vowel.

     But I think their pronunciation of vowel "अ" is ह्रस्व but not संवृत्त but rather विवृत्त.

   2. North Indians in general can easily pronounce "अ" correctly but when it occurs at the end of word they clip it

     which is of course wrong.

  

  The guru must have said "कृष्णा" means Draupadi.

  

Regards
