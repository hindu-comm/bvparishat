May we know more about this journal, whether it is run by professional linguists, or board of referees /editors contains professional linguists, is the author properly trained in linguistics etc.?

  

I gave you the reason for why classifying all the languages on the basis of script is not correct. In any discipline, a theorisation that has a limited application within the corpusof its focus is not considered to be not a correct theorisation.

  

Classification of languages in this language is not a correct theorisation of linguistics since it covers only languages with script which are only a meagre percent of languages.
