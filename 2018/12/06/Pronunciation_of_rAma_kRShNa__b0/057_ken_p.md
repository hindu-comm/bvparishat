Mr.Paturi,  
First of all I am not a linguist.  
Yes, children are taught traditional full lettered consonants in Devanagari alphabet with sounds but not half lettered one with partial sounds.  
if children are taught to write राम , कृष्ण (र ा म ।क ृ ष् ण ) this way then they may never think about these hidden sounds ie र्‌+आ+म्‌+अ, क्+ ऋ +ष् +ण  
Still these newly added Devanagari sounds ऍ/ॲ,ऑ are not taught to children in schools. Also अं /ȧ has dual sound in words ie अंबर ,अंदर  
So it will be better to write conjunct letters in Devanagari scripted languages as shown in above Bhāgavat Kathā link. ie कृष्‌ण
