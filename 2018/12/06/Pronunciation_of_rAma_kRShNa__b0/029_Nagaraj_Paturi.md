Regarding consonant ending names in the south, there are two different aspects here.

  

-an ending in Tamil and Malayalam names has no syncope involved. It is masculine singular suffix native to those languages

  

-aaL , the feminine singular suffix

  

and

  

-ar , the masculine and sometimes gender-neutral human plural suffix are also found in these two languages.

  

These two suffices too are native to these languages and like -an have nothing to do with Sanskrit.

  

But the cononant ending Sanskritic names is a different animal

  

It is obviously a modern time development in south Indian languages and is obviously a North Indian influence. Like many North Indian influences on south India, this too is received and viewed as modernity in culture .

  

This is different from pronouncing Sanskrit verses
