It is similar to the issue of pronouncing गणेश as गणेशा or शिव as शिवा, कृष्ण as कृष्णा in southern parts.

But it is corrected when a word follows these in a samAsa. E.g. गणेशवन्दना शिवसूत्र कृष्णलीला

  

It is the vowel at the end issue.

  

In Hindi, like English and many other languages, the last short vowel 'a' is clipped.

In South, the last short vowel 'a' is elongated.

This is indeed how different languages are formed, along with other changes in pronunciation.

  

English IAST contributed to this as well. Śrī was written as Sri by ordinary typewriters or folks, and then श्री became pronounced as स्री

  

And many more.

  

  

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
