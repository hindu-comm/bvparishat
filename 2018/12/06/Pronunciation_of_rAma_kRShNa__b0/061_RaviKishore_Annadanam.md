Dhanyavaad to all.

  

So, just to reiterate my final understanding on this, all the Indian languages, including Sanskrit will be written as they are pronounced, while it is not the case only with Hindi (halantha is pronounced, while ajantha is written).

  

As I do not have much idea about earlier/older north Indian languages such as awadhi, out of my interest I'd like to ask. Are those languages (such asawadhi) also were written as they pronounced, or not?

  

  

Dhanyavaad,

Ravi Kishore Annadanam
