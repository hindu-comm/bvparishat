Deviations from Siksha across are more than the one instance noted. Some others are (if stated in a generalised manner):

  

\* South Indians seem to not pronounce mahaapraanas properly, with many making them indistinguishable from alpapranas

\* श, ष, स — seem to be more mispronounced than correctly pronounced. श, ष being barely distinguishable in North, श, स in South and West, all three in East and so on.

\* ksha seems to become khya in East

\* ज्ञ,ऋ seem to be incorrectly pronounced all over the country

\* ङ, ञ, ण seem to have become the anusvaara (influence of Prakrit)

\* pha seems to have become fa (Persian influence)

\* ह्ण, ह्न, ह्म, ह्ल, ह्व - these have their own specific issue

\* then there are stylistic corruptions like namashkaar.

\* and so on

  

In all the above, the correct traditional stance is to note the pronunciation of SishTas (which is good across the country and any seeming deviation is supported by Praatisaakhyas) rather than the common pronunciation. The non-normative pronunciation that modern linguistics studies, suffers from nebulous boundaries. There is the old saying that language changes every kos. What is called Hindi is split into some 55 languages by the census. In Telugu, the dialect changes from district to district and there are many changes within a district seen in the district-wise dialects studied and recorded by the Telugu University. Language changes with the socio-economic class (read Bernard Shaw's Pygmallion for the situation in London a hundred years back), age, time, place, situation and so on. So when we say "generally" whose language do we mean? The commoners, so to speak, hugely outnumber the elite, if we are to go by mere numbers. And the term commoner can include hugely wealthy, successful or powerful people. In Telugu speaking states, many successful/wealthy/powerful people (film stars, ministers, businessmen) write their names as सुरेष्, महेष्, वेंकटेष्, हरीष्, etc.

  

Keeping all this in mind, Patanjali in the Mahabhashya advises study of saadhuSabdas and says it is not possible to give lakshana of apaSabdas.

  

So, in summary, if at all an open-minded opinion is to be stated, it would be wider than the one stated and would specifically recognise the imprecision (of geographical and class boundaries) in the ooinion. Wiser thing would be to recognise what Patanjali said so many years back.
